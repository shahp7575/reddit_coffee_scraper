Up until this point in my life I had managed with exercise and Trazodone, but it wasn't working anymore, it was getting harder and harder. When I realised I couldn't go on like this, I decided to try one thing after another from week to week to combat the problem and finally get an acceptable amount of sleep. Yes, I have tried a lot of things before, but most of the time I have let my routine slip. 

I recently stopped drinking coffee altogether. That seemed to help for two days, but I realised there are other factors that seem to affect my sleep. I will keep at it though. 

One is my sport. I love swimming, but it keeps me up too late. It's hard on my body and I'm going to try to change my training schedule. 

I am now going to stop using my phone in the evenings for a week to read instead and come back to tell you how it went.

I’m heading to Austria for a ski holiday tomorrow morning, and this will be my first long trip with my 3-month-old Ioniq 6. I’d like to be well-prepared and have a few questions about navigating and charging.

Sometimes, when I set a charging station as a destination, the system seems to treat the address as a regular location, rather than recognizing it as a charging station. As a result, my battery isn't preheated before I arrive. What’s the best way to navigate to ensure all my planned charging stops are correctly recognized, and that my battery gets preheated before reaching each station?

Additionally, are there any other things I should keep in mind for the journey? I’m thinking of bringing a coffee maker and plugging it into the outlet under the backseat. Does anyone have experience with that?

I’ve been dealing with an electrical issue in my rental flat for nearly three months, and despite multiple attempts to resolve the problem, the situation hasn’t improved. I’m hoping to get advice on what my rights are as a tenant and what steps I can take to push for a resolution.

* **The issue**: The power in the flat keeps tripping, almost always when the kitchen is in use. It happens randomly with different appliances: sometimes the kettle, sometimes the oven, and other times the coffee machine or hob. There’s no consistent pattern, and no single appliance seems to be the cause.
* **Attempts to fix it**: Three different electricians have come to inspect the issue, but none of them found the root cause. They only checked the electric box, tested a few plugs, and briefly turned on appliances to see if they triggered the circuit. The problem persists, and the landlord hasn’t taken further action.
* **Weird circumstances**: The flat’s electrical system is split into two circuits. One circuit powers a single flatmate’s bedroom, while the other powers the rest of the flat (3 other bedrooms), including the kitchen. Oddly, the circuit almost always trips when this flatmate is home, even though her room is on the separate circuit. We’ve also noticed that it’s most likely to trip when she goes into the kitchen. She went on holidays for a month and we never lost electricity, and the day she came back, we lost electricity multiple times and it has been a daily occurrence with her around.
* **Impact on living conditions**: The frequent power loss has made using the flat unreliable, and it’s affecting my ability to live comfortably in the flat. The landlord has been informed multiple times, but they seem unwilling to investigate the issue properly or provide a lasting fix. The loss of electricity is impacting my bedroom/office too, as I cannot use my computer safely.

**My questions**:

1. As a tenant, do I have legal grounds to demand a more thorough investigation and resolution from my landlord?
2. Can the landlord ignore us by assuming it’s one tenant’s fault, even if there’s no clear proof? Are we considered a group or individuals under tenancy law when it comes to shared issues?
3. If the issue is caused by one tenant (e.g., faulty appliances or improper use), would I still have the right to request compensation or a rent reduction for the inconvenience? We are not a family, she just lives here.
4. Is it reasonable to ask for compensation or a rent reduction due to the ongoing inconvenience and unreliable living conditions?
5. Can the landlord/agency simply say ""The electrician could not find the issue, we will close the case as you are causing the problem in our opinion""?

As part of a bigger RTW project we did the arguably most difficult west coast sestion from Ghana to Angola. 5500km through the rainforest - the greenest and at the same time blackest Africa. We all probably know Nigeria and have heard about Congo, but the tiny nations of Togo and Benin had something up their sleeves too. We went on good roads, bad roads and then hardly any roads. We wildcamped, hotel-camped, monastery-camped. We ate strange food and dreamed of better coffee. We got it once and even then it was Moroccan.

During the whole trip we met only two other white travellers and they were on bicycles. To say that we were the center of attention would be an understatement. Quite an experience, especially for me who previously outside of Europe had been only in Morocco.

The bikes used were Husqvarna Norden 901s. The original ones, only with upgraded suspension. There were some overheating issues, I hated the electronics (as a Tenere guy), the breaks seized at one point, a fork started leaking and the engine ran on one cylinder sometimes. With closest technical support probably only in Cape Town, we ignored all that and made it over the Equator and the mighty Congo river.

1i3crnz,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1i3crnz/the_time_thief/,The Time Thief,"The first video arrived at 3:33 AM.

""1 New Message: From Yourself""

In it, I was sitting in a coffee shop I'd never been to, wearing clothes I didn't own, laughing with people I'd never met. The timestamp read ""Yesterday, 2:15 PM"" – exactly when I'd been in my quarterly budget meeting at work.

I checked my call history. No outgoing messages at 3:33 AM.
Checked my sent folder. Nothing.
Checked the video metadata. File created: Never.

The second video came the next night. Same time. Same sender.

This time I was on a beach at sunset, teaching a dog I don't have to fetch. The timestamp matched my dentist appointment from that day. My dentist confirmed I'd been in his chair at that exact time, getting a cavity filled.

The videos kept coming. Each night. Always at 3:33 AM. Always showing me living a life I had no memory of:

- Playing piano at a bar (I don't play piano)
- Rock climbing (I'm terrified of heights)
- Speaking fluent Mandarin to an elderly couple (I barely know English)

Each timestamp perfectly aligned with moments I could account for elsewhere. Moments with witnesses, paperwork, security footage.

I started documenting everything. Recording every minute of my days. Installing cameras in my apartment. Collecting alibis and timestamps and proof of where I was.

But the other me – the one in the videos – had proof too.

Restaurant receipts started showing up in my email. Photos tagged on social media. Business cards with my name and face but different credentials. Concert tickets in my wallet that I never bought.

Then came the letter:

""Dear Time Thief,

You should stop documenting 'your' life so obsessively. It's getting harder to edit you out of mine.

Yes, mine. Because this is my life you're living in parallel. My time you're stealing, one second at a time.

Did you really think you were the original?

Check your earliest memory. Really check it. When exactly does your life begin? What's the first thing you remember?

Let me guess: Six years ago. The hospital. Waking up after the 'accident' with no memories before that moment.

That was no accident. That was your creation point. When you split off from me like a temporal tumor, started living your own version of my life in parallel.

Every moment you experience, you're stealing from me. Every breath you take should have been mine. You're a temporal parasite, feeding off my unlived possibilities.

But I found you. And I've been documenting everything you've stolen.

The videos aren't showing you a life you don't remember.

They're showing you the life you're preventing me from living.

Every time you make a choice, the life I would have lived splinters off, becomes a video delivered at 3:33 AM. A record of what you stole from me.

Want proof? Check your bedroom wall. Behind the mirror. You know, the one you've always felt weird about but never knew why.

Go ahead. I'll wait.

- The Real You""

I ran to my bedroom. Tore down the mirror I'd never hung but had always been there.

Behind it was a hole. Inside: hundreds of hard drives. Each labeled with a date. Each containing thousands of hours of footage.

Of me. Living lives I don't remember.

But they weren't just videos.

They were windows.

Through each one, I could see myself living another life. All happening simultaneously. All real. All authentic.

And in each one, I was staring back through the screen.

Watching me.

Documenting me.

Each version convinced they were the original. Each one thinking the others were the thieves.

As I write this, I can see them. Hundreds of me, all writing the same words. All making the same discovery. All coming to the same horrifying realization:

None of us is the original.

We're all splinters.

Fragments.

Each of us stealing time from an original that no longer exists. Each convinced we're the real version, the others are parasites.

But here's the true horror:

This message you're reading?

You didn't choose to read it.

You're stealing that choice from another you. One who chose not to read it. One who's living a better life right now, untouched by this knowledge.

Check your phone.

It's 3:33 AM.

And you have 1 new message.

From yourself.

Want to see what choice you just stole from yourself by reading this?

Want to see the life you could be living instead?

Just press play.

But remember:

The you that's watching...

Isn't the only you that's watching back.

We're all thieves here.

All living on stolen time.

And it's 3:33 AM somewhere, always.

Check your phone.

My roommate keeps disrespecting my things. She’s been putting dirty tissues on my dish drying mat, even after I asked her not to. Recently, I noticed she damaged my coffee table while working on her 2025 vision board. She got some red goop on it and just left it there. This isn’t the first time she’s left a mess on my furniture. Once she left a movie theater soda cup on my dining table for WEEKS, which left a ring. I have coasters on the table by that way 🙄

I texted her about the tissues and the coffee table, and she asked for picture proof. After I sent it, I told her not to touch my stuff anymore since this has been an ongoing issue. She claimed she thought it was okay because we’re “sharing furniture.” I told her I’m not going to share with someone who constantly disrespects my belongings.

She said I should move my furniture out of the shared spaces if I don’t want her using it, arguing it’s unfair for her not to be allowed to use it. She even threatened to buy her own dining table and coffee table and clutter the apartment with them. I told her I didn’t care since her vision board supplies are already taking over the space anyway.

Eventually, she offered to pay to replace the coffee table but added that if I want her to respect my belongings, I need to “respect her.” She clearly doesn’t like being called out or taking accountability.

**Response to Prompt 4: Understatement**

In the quaint town of Brooksville, where the extraordinary was often met with an indifferent shrug, something truly remarkable occurred. The residents, sipping coffee at the local diner or strolling along the cobblestone streets, would describe it as just another peculiar day. Little did they know that beneath the surface of their nonchalant existence, a cosmic event unfolded.

The morning sun cast its usual warm glow on Brooksville, with birds chirping in the background, creating an illusion of normalcy. However, the anomaly had already begun. Mrs. Higgins, the elderly librarian, dismissed it as a minor inconvenience, merely a glitch in the library's ancient computer system. Yet, every book cataloged within those ancient shelves had transformed into a portal, connecting readers to parallel universes with every turn of a page.

As I, a humble journalist for the local paper, stumbled upon this revelation, I couldn't help but marvel at the town's response—or lack thereof. ""The library's having a bit of a moment,"" was the most anyone would acknowledge. It seemed the whole town collectively decided that this was, at most, a quirky hiccup.

For a thousand words, I delved into the understated reactions of the townsfolk, each encounter with a parallel universe bringing its own blend of confusion and nonchalance. As the portals expanded, revealing fantastical landscapes and alternate versions of Brooksville, the citizens maintained an impressive level of calm, as if interdimensional travel was a routine part of their daily lives.

The plot thickened when I discovered that the portals were a result of a mysterious artifact hidden within the library's archives. The mayor, sipping his coffee, remarked, ""Well, that explains the strange noises in the basement."" It became evident that the understatement of the situation was a defense mechanism, shielding the town from the cosmic chaos unfolding.

**Response to Prompt 12: Juxtaposition**

In the bustling metropolis of Neon City, skyscrapers touched the heavens, their dazzling lights reflecting off the sleek surfaces of futuristic cars. Yet, nestled within this urban jungle, an ancient relic stood defiantly—the Old Grove Park.

As I strolled through the city's concrete arteries, the juxtaposition between the modernity of Neon City and the timeless serenity of the park became increasingly apparent. The cacophony of traffic was replaced by the rustling of leaves and the distant laughter of children playing.

The central conflict emerged when the city council, embodying the epitome of order, proposed transforming the park into a technologically advanced hub. The juxtaposition intensified as architects discussed plans for holographic playgrounds and virtual reality gardens within the confines of the Old Grove Park.

Through a thousand words, I explored the clash of ideals, the struggle between progress and preservation. The ancient trees became silent witnesses to heated debates at town hall meetings, where environmentalists and tech enthusiasts engaged in a battle of words. The juxtaposition of the towering skyscrapers against the gnarled branches of the park's oldest tree mirrored the tension in Neon City's collective conscience.

""What is the meaning of life?"" The question echoed in my mind, a relentless epanalepsis that demanded exploration. As I embarked on this freewriting journey, the repetition of the existential inquiry became the rhythm of my introspection.

For a thousand words, I delved into the varied perspectives of individuals wrestling with the ultimate question. From philosophers contemplating the intricacies of existence to everyday people seeking purpose in mundane routines, the epanalepsis served as a constant reminder of the universal quest for meaning.

The narrative weaved through different characters and their unique experiences, creating a tapestry of reflections that echoed the complexities of human existence. The repetitive structure became a literary heartbeat, pulsating with the shared yearning for understanding amid the chaotic symphony of life.

**Response to Prompt 27: Symbolism**

In the quaint town of Willowbrook, the arrival of a single dove carried profound significance. Its graceful descent into the town square was a symbol, an omen that whispered of impending change. As a budding novelist with a penchant for symbolism, I couldn't resist exploring the layers of meaning embedded in this seemingly mundane event.

For a thousand words, I dissected the impact of the dove on the lives of Willowbrook's residents. The mayor saw it as a sign of prosperity, the local florist interpreted it as a call for unity, and the elderly storyteller regarded it as a harbinger of forgotten tales. The dove's symbolism rippled through the town, influencing decisions and shaping destinies.

**Response to Prompt 33: Catachresis**

In the dimly lit alleyways of Serpent's Hollow, darkness wrapped its cold arms around me—an eerie catachresis that mirrored the ominous atmosphere. The assignment was to explore the underbelly of the city, and as a novice reporter, I found myself navigating the labyrinth of deceit and shadows.

For a thousand words, I delved into the catachresis-infused descriptions of the characters populating Serpent's Hollow. The crime lord, known as the Velvet Serpent, ruled the district with a velvet-gloved fist. His lair, a dilapidated mansion, exuded an air of faded grandeur that served as a catachresis for the empire he once commanded.

As I chronicled the criminal underworld, the catachresis became a literary tool to convey the complexity and decay inherent in Serpent's Hollow. The labyrinthine plots, the twisted allegiances, and the morally ambiguous characters all found expression through catachresis, painting a vivid picture of a city where metaphor and reality intertwined.

**Response to Prompt 3: Hyperbole**

In the quaint village of Mistwood, where routines unfolded with the predictability of the sunrise, the arrival of a peculiar fortune teller sparked exaggerated whispers. ""This is it, the end of our mundane lives!"" proclaimed Mrs. Thompson, the town's eternal pessimist, as she clutched her cat, Captain Whiskers, with an air of impending catastrophe.

The hyperbole hung in the air, a thick fog of anticipation enveloping the village. As I delved into the story, the hyperbolic reactions of Mistwood's residents heightened the absurdity of the situation. What began as a mere visit from a mystical figure transformed into a fantastical escapade, with the fortune teller's prophecies shaping the destiny of the villagers in ludicrous ways.

Through the hyperbolic lens, I explored the comedic consequences of taking ordinary events to extraordinary extremes.

Obviously they lack a whole lot in terms of variety, and while I am sure having your own bot or AI that is based on your feedback and guidance it could really help writers as a tool. I am more impressed with the art AI then the text based AI. Any idea what to expect from such a fast learning and highly advanced AI will do to our human history in culture? Will we be effectively playing God, just as the Christian God created us IN HIS OWN IMAGE, we have taken everything we know as a species and gathered up our entire human history and knowledge giving it to what will carry on the code until the time when someone who cares remembers it? Maybe we have been here before and this is a constant cycle that occurs with the same energy finding the way through the vast expanse of the universe to return to our home planet Earth, who we have destroyed over and over again yet mother nature is still the winner. She's the one in control. We are but mere photocopied versions of once great Men who have already seen the best and worst of this world, and we will now give everything we have to some plastic and metal parts, until it quickly replaces us from the bottom up, science fiction turned science fact.

Did we knowingly create our own enemies? Are we able to compete with the best of us and all they know that can then take us out in a heartbeat because we can't finish the steps, we barely found out that they are there to take.

It's a random rant and I apologize. The day to day stress and struggle makes it near impossible to worry about such potential problems in our not so distant future.

But how can we continue to ignore the collapse of the entire system as we know it, in front of a crowd of people who are jaded and they will not change despite knowing they aren't going to make it to the end in what will become a Bladerunner Toxic Dystopian Nightmare with Mad Max taking over and the soft, emasculated male will wither away from the heat and those Tank Girls out there will eventually be written forever out of existence because the cucks all forgot to impregnate them all tgeir batteries ran out? Will the world simply become so politically correct that it dies a depressed death while AI simply decides we are too much of a virus to live? 

Who knows....I do not. But these are indicidive of a future full of b movie plot garbage that are based on Wattpad tropes with no clear details and no plot to get into, so that sucks.",1,1737106238.0,writingthruit,0,1.0,False

**New Symptoms and Concerns:**

* Increased Abdominal Pain and Cramping: I've been experiencing higher pain than normal (where my normal pain is never at a 0, usually I sit at a 2-3 on an ordinary day); I've also been experiencing more abdominal cramping.
* Abdominal Pain Locations: lower right quadrant, lower left quadrant, under right ribs, under left ribs; pain sometimes radiates to neck, shoulders, and back; pain sometimes also comes with body aches through arms and legs.
* Increased Bowel Movements: at least once per day, I sit on the toilet with diarrhea for 30-40 minutes, sometimes it is 2-3 times a day. Recently it has been two times a day, and it feels worse. Bowel movements have never relieved pain or discomfort for me, this remains to be the case. I used to be able to take loperamide to help manage and treat it, but now whenever I take it, it makes me nauseous and unable to eat for days.
* Increased Heartburn and Discomfort: I've been experiencing stronger symptoms of heartburn and regurgitation regardless of my current medications.
* Increased Bloating: I'm pretty much always bloated, but I feel like it has been worse and more frequently as of late.
* Blood in Bowel Movements: I have had a history of blood with my diarrhea, most often it is because the external hemorrhoid swells up and then ""pops"". I also bled heavily during prep for my colonoscopy because the medication to flush my system caused the hemorrhoids to bleed heavily - to the point I could sit there on the toilet and just bleed into it.
   * **Most recently**, for the last couple of days, all of my bowel movements have been more intense diarrhea (that comes with more intense cramps) and often includes blood during and after. It is enough blood to fill the bottom/deepest parts of the bowl and make it dark, as well as tinge the rest of the water. When I wipe, a lot of blood comes with it. But I am not bleeding outside of this.
   * I have had **NO** fever, chills, or dizziness.
* New Possible Allergies: I had to cut out bananas from my diet last year and avocado from my diet this year, both cause me extreme abdominal pain fairly quickly.
* Increased Food Sensitivities: Food that should otherwise be safe for both/either GERD and/or IBS have been triggering symptoms or making me feel sick. Examples include rice, mushrooms, and eggs.
* Pain and Blood Urinating: On and off since last year, I've been getting pain in my urethra when I urinate, and this sometimes includes tinges of blood (which I noticed when I wipe). It is possible I have a stricture from previous damage and scar tissue in combination with my metoidioplasty.
* Pelvic Floor Pain: On and off since last year, I've been experiencing minor to extreme pain in my bladder as well as my pelvis when I urinate and when I climax.

\---

**Habits:**

* Diet: I am generally fairly good about my diet. I have always had chronic dry mouth, so I drink a lot of water every day. I've made a literal spreadsheet of unsafe and safe foods - I can share this upon request.
   * I have cut out most trigger foods: whole/raw onion and garlic (I use just powders in cooking), brassicas, legumes, most tomato, most starches except for some potato and some rice, watermelon, soy and soy products, peppers/spicy things, citrus, leafy greens such as spinach.
   * I have reduced my coffee and tea intake to one or two cups a day.
   * I do not drink soda pop except for now and then with a meal.
   * I don't eat a lot of particularly greasy foods nor fast food.
   * I am aware I need to reduce my sugar intake.
   * I tend to snack throughout the day, and then have bigger/full meals 1-2 times a day.
* Exercise: Due to my chronic illnesses and pain, and living in Canada (where it is winter most of the time), I do not get out as much as I would like. I have formed the habit of daily stretching. I have a mini cycle machine I can put under my desk that I occasionally use. I go swimming at least a few times a year (but would like to go more).
* Mental Health: I have formed the habits of daily breathing exercises, daily affirmations, and daily journaling. I have been and am still looking for both a full time psychologist and a full time trained therapist - neither exist where I am located, I am on multiple waitlists. I have also removed myself from most social media, as it makes me miserable.

**Family History:**

* My mother has been disabled my whole life with a mix of unknown conditions and the same ones I have (though her IBS has been IBS-C). She has also had seizures for over 15 years.
* My mother has cancer for the second time, I think it's stage 3 and located on the lymph nodes on her side.
* My mother has a chronic spine condition that requires monthly shots (I do not know the specifics).
* My mother has chronic heart conditions and was considered for a valve surgery or pacemaker (just before the cancer was discovered and treatment began).

They appreciate each other for working for a goal, a friendship blooms, Samantha asks Scarlet if she'd get a coffee with her, they start meeting up, the friendship becomes closer.

Samantha might start being touchy with Scarlet, holding hands, playfully bumping her shoulder against Scarlets, possibly even brushing a strand of hair behind Scarlets' ear, testing waters on how far is too far.

I see Samantha as being either Bisexual or a lesbian, Scarlet is possibly pansexual, so the possibility of them crossing the friendship line into girlfriend territory is a distinct possibility.

But should you shop at local markets or stick to tourist shops? Both have their perks, but if you’re looking for authenticity and value, here’s how to make the best choice.

# Local Markets

**Pros:**

1. **Authentic Items:** Local markets often feature handmade crafts, showcasing Dominican culture and artistry.
2. **Better Prices:** Bargaining is common, and you can often get a better deal compared to tourist shops.
3. **Unique Finds:** You’re more likely to find one-of-a-kind items rather than mass-produced goods.
4. **Cultural Experience:** Visiting a local market immerses you in Dominican culture, from local music to the vibrant atmosphere.

**Cons:**

1. **Language Barrier:** Vendors may speak little or no English, so knowing a few Spanish phrases can be helpful.
2. **Lack of Variety in Payment Methods:** Many vendors only accept cash, so bring Dominican pesos or small bills in USD.

# Popular Local Markets in Punta Cana:

* **Bávaro Market:** A bustling spot with handmade jewelry, paintings, cigars, and locally made products.
* **El Cortecito Village Market:** Known for souvenirs like larimar jewelry, rum, coffee, and crafts.
* **Macao Market:** A smaller market near Macao Beach with unique items like coconut carvings and natural beauty products.

# Tourist Shops

**Pros:**

1. **Convenience:** Located in resorts, malls, or popular tourist areas, making them easy to access.
2. **Guaranteed Quality:** Some shops have higher-quality items, especially for branded products like Café Santo Domingo or rum.
3. **Payment Options:** Credit cards are widely accepted, and transactions are often hassle-free.
4. **Air-Conditioned Comfort:** Shopping indoors can be a relief from the tropical heat.

**Cons:**

1. **Higher Prices:** Items in tourist shops are typically more expensive due to convenience and location.
2. **Mass-Produced Goods:** Many items lack authenticity and are made for mass consumption.

* **San Juan Shopping Center:** Features a variety of shops selling Dominican coffee, rum, cigars, and branded products.
* **BlueMall Punta Cana:** A high-end shopping mall with international and local brands.

# What to Buy

1. **Coffee and Cocoa:** Authentic Dominican coffee and organic cocoa are must-haves. Available at both local markets and tourist shops.
2. **Larimar Jewelry:** This rare blue stone is only found in the Dominican Republic. For higher-end options, visit tourist shops; for unique designs, try local markets.
3. **Handmade Crafts:** Look for wood carvings, colorful paintings, and woven goods at local markets.
4. **Mamajuana:** A traditional Dominican drink made of rum, red wine, honey, and herbs. Both local markets and tourist shops carry it, but prices are usually better at markets.
5. **Cigars:** The Dominican Republic is famous for cigars. Look for well-known brands in tourist shops or unique blends in markets.

# Tips for Souvenir Shopping

1. **Bring Cash:** Local markets often don’t accept credit cards, and cash makes bargaining easier.
2. **Negotiate:** Bargaining is expected in local markets but not in tourist shops.
3. **Inspect Before Buying:** Check items for quality, especially handmade crafts or jewelry.
4. **Ask About Authenticity:** Some tourist shops sell items labeled as handmade that are mass-produced. Always ask where the item was made.
5. **Compare Prices:** If possible, visit both markets and shops to compare prices and quality.

# Final Recommendation

* **For Unique and Authentic Souvenirs:** Go to local markets like Bávaro Market or El Cortecito. You’ll find handmade items, better deals, and a genuine cultural experience.
* **For Convenience and Branded Goods:** Stick to tourist shops, especially if you’re looking for rum, coffee, or cigars with recognizable labels.

As well, he travelled overseas for Xmas and did not bring me back even a small token from the place in which I am supposed to plan “our” retirement.  Am I way too sensitive here?!","Over the holidays, my co-habitating partner of 1.5 years left for a trip abroad to take care of his huge 90 acres of agricultural product, and to see his family (I am 48F and he is 55M).  We were planning on myself, and my daughter, to join him.  However, we had an extremely stressful situation planning the trip, as it was too late in the game to locate semi-affordable airfare (holiday season!!  As well, he had to understand when his job(s) would be complete before he could consider purchasing an air ticket).  So, I forfeited the plan to join, as it would end up costing $5000 in airfare.  He ended up going on his own, and I was extremely supportive throughout the entire process.  However, it was emotionally challenging for me in the beginning.  This is mostly due to it being g the holidays, as well as my disappointment in not being able to go.  We had spoken many times about me going along, in order to meet his family.  As well, he has commented a great many times that this is “our” retirement property.  At least half of the year.  So, it is important for me to go.  Since he landed, his continued comments around his feeling of me not being happy there until he gets the house better out-fitted for my comfort have confused me.  Apparently, he had a really hard landing, and many things to repair upon his arrival.  

Fast-forward to now:
He landed home, and has been here for 4 full days.  He immediately proclaimed upon unpacking that he did not bring me anything back from his time away, from a country in which I am supposed to be connecting with in the foreseen future, because there wasn’t anything there that he thought I may like.  

He comes from a state in which they mine gemstones, and these stones can be found, everywhere, at a really inexpensive cost to him.  I am not speaking Diamonds, nor Emeralds (even though these can be found there too).  Yet, I collect raw rocks & minerals.  It could have been a small raw citrine, amethyst, quartz.  It could have been a small gesture of the plentiful resources of those things (aside from raw gemstones) found on his land of 90 acres!  I won’t go into detail here on those.  Basically, I am stating that I am not the kind of girl to want my man to bring me a gold ring, nor diamonds.  Just a small gesture, letting me know that he is thinking of me.  
The fact that he did not, nor did he make any quality time for us following his return (he rested 1.5 days, which he needed to do.  Then, he went straight into 3 days of work).  He comes home every night, talks about himself, then proceeds to help make dinner (eating well & large is a very important aspect of his culture).  After that, he wants to sit on the couch and extend the leg rest to watch something on TV “with me”.
I am very busy as well, and don’t mind doing that from time to time.  However, this seems to be his preference.  He has even stated many times that he would rather be home, than go out (date night, events, etc).  I like a perfect blend of the two.  Definitely something more interesting than turning on the TV each night after dinner.  At least, once in awhile!  

Tonite, he asked why I was so quiet.  I reminded him that I just found out that a close friend passed away, and his response was somewhat caring yet he quickly shifted to speaking about his day.  Later on, I brought it up, and he stated that death happens.

Then, I proceeded to tell him that I felt the fact that he didn’t bring me back a gift/souvenir resulted in my feeling that he was not even thinking of me.  I explained that this is a gesture of love & caring, and it helps feed the fire of connection.  I stated that he has continued on the trajectory of taking care of himself.  Yet, not a perceived balance in caring for his relationship as well.  He got up and walked away.  Once he returned, he asked why I was saying all of this.  I stated again why.  Then, he proceeded to tell me that he has big goals, and he has to fund these goals of maintaining, and building, his coffee plantation through working hard here in the states (he has dual-residency of 30 years).  I get that.  I always have.  And, I have done the very same thing with my own business.  Yet, he is speaking to me as if he is explaining the first time.  As well, he commented that if that doesn’t work for me, then, it’s not going to work.  I replied “ok, if that is what is most important to you”.  (Mind you, during our call with a pre-marital/couples therapist, he stated that he had thoughts of selling his farm, as it was proving to be “too much” to maintain from afar.  He stated it a second time, firing a personal call with me, approximately 2 weeks, or so, afterwards).  

As well, he made a great mistake in stating that he is not just (fill in the blank) as I do in my business.  He has to exude a lot more energy.  That was the straw for me, as I work my ass off in a very challenging climate in order to ensure my business not only survives, but thrives.  The type of business on which I have created is one of the most challenging I know of.  I could not believe he was comparing, nor even saying such things!
 
I am beginning to feel like we are not a match.  I have been extremely patient, and understanding.  Holding space for him, and his goals.  It’s not about me.  It’s about how the relationship is being fed.  

Even though he is very attentive, through touch, as touch is his love language.  As well, he shows up in service.  I have never met a man who shows up in service, as he has!  This island is chock-full of peter-pans, and to have a man who values work is, and has been, valuable to me.  Yet, the scales feel extremely tipped. I just don’t get the true emotional connect.  And, communication is key for me!  Though, I do very much understand cultural differences in communication.  

I am doing my best to understand, hold space, and value the qualities (which I totally adore!).  So, I don’t want to fuck this up.  Yet, when asked why so quiet, shouldn’t I (in a calm manner) share my thoughts & feelings, sans a shutdown and walk away?

Felt like strangers afterwards. Need advice.  
  
I (17M) will tell you the story from the beginning.

I got cheated on in my last relationship. During the relationship, whenever she hung out at my place, while she let me read her texts, she always refused to let me read her chat with one person. That person turned out to be her ex. I trusted her not to do something like that at the time, so what she did may have left a scar.

Back to the current days, my current relationship started around Christmas. We had a lot of good times together, me being at her house baking, then a hangout for Christmas movies, then Christmas dinner, Christmas presents opening (3 seperate days btw). After New Years, she (16M) went on a holiday, and that was when some problems started. She responded to my messages less, and when I asked for some calls in the evening, she would question it or passed it aside. I started thinking about how she could be cheating, but this would be resolved when she got back.

As she got back, we went on another date, and it was great. But the next day, when I came to her place, she was a bit more cold and distant. When I asked, she said she felt suffocated and said we were moving too fast, so we decided to take a step back and learn more about each other. This was 3 weeks into our relationship. Mutual agreement is that we would still spend time together, so not breaking up per se.

The problem is, after that, suddenly we felt like two strangers. At school, we hardly talked and we would only talk whenever I initiated the conversation. After a day of us hanging out, I said this to her and while she did text first or sit next to me in class, I can't help but still feel the distancing. While she still asked to call during the evening, it was to study only. She also only kept this up for a couple days before everything falls into place again.

When I asked her if she was looking for something serious in our relationship, she responded she doesn't know. That icked me a little bit, as I was going in with a mindset of having a long-term relationship.

I also bought her stuff, nothing too fancy. Just a cute hat, and a couple coffees here and there. But when I suggested that she could get me a phone case, as she always nagged about me not having one, she seemed not happy.

Tomorrow is our next date, and while it was interrupted by a sudden change in plans, the majority of our date remained intact.

Some of the details in my yapping may be confused to you, so feel free to ask for any clarification you need.

My questions are: Am I being used? What should be my next move? Should I leave her some space, or should I step out of the relationship?",1,1737105661.0,relationships,6,1.0,False

Trying to find someone who would make me want to do all those cheesy things for someone again.   


I m 29, Philosophical and someone who dreams about food recipes and romance little much. I m too good to be true on most days but I have my own flaws and insecurities. I imagine cooking food for us after a long day hearing you talk about how your day was. I might be seeking something unreal at the age of 29, but I refuse to give up which should say a lot about me as a person. I have never given up on a relationship whether it was friendship or dating unless I see no change in the other person's behavior.   
  
I have been raised in different cities as my family comes from a business background which made my dad travel a lot cause of work. I was raised by my mother with flying chappals and regular slaps if I was even slightly out of line. She made sure that I worship the women in my life as they are nothing short of a goddess. And I travelled a lot while growing up, it made it that much difficult to make friendships which lasts longer. I m still in touch with my friends but I can hardly call someone my bestfriend. 

I absolutely love trying new things, travelling, hiking and exploring food joints and eateries. I m a Coffee Tonic person or a Cranberry Espresso guy. I prefer Pastel colours over solid colours. I want to believe I have a good sense of fashion and humour. My humour reflects the trauma and insecurities I have, if you are good enough to see it. 

I can't write my entire life story here so if you like what you read then tell me a bit about you and we take it from there. Hoping to see you in the chats. If not, I hope you do find what you are looking for! Cheers and Hang in there. You are just one post away from finding the right match. ",0,1737105006.0,r4r,1,0.5,False

I’ve been dealing with ongoing electrical issues in my rental flat for nearly three months, and I’m hoping someone here can help me, as I have no knowledge nor skills to understand any of this

* **Electricians haven’t found the issue:** Three different electricians have come to inspect the situation. Each one only checked the electric box, tested a few plugs, and briefly tried turning on appliances one by one in the kitchen, but nothing triggered the switch. None of them found anything wrong or identified the source of the problem, leaving us without a solution.
* **The problem happens randomly in the kitchen:** The circuit trips seemingly at random when using kitchen appliances, but there’s no clear pattern. Sometimes it happens with the coffee machine, other times with the hob, oven, or kettle. Even when testing appliances individually, nothing trips the circuit immediately. It’s not tied to one specific device, and it doesn’t happen every single time. However, it happens 3/4 days a week, sometimes multiple times a day.
* **A strange link to one flatmate:** The issue almost always occurs when one particular flatmate is home. Her bedroom is on a completely separate electrical circuit from the rest of the flat, with its own main switch. The other circuit powers the rest of the flat, including the kitchen. Despite this separation, the circuit trips frequently when she’s present, especially if she uses the kitchen. We can’t figure out why her presence might be related to the issue.
* **Questions about the electrical system**: Given that the circuits are separate, is it possible for them to interact in some way? Could faulty wiring or an issue in the electric box explain why this flatmate’s presence seems to affect the system? I’d like to know what specific things to ask an electrician to check, as we’ve already spent a lot of time trying to resolve this.

Any advice or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. The landlord is not helping at all unfortunately.

One of my coworkers even made fun of me for constantly moving and stretching my left shoulder to relieve the pain because it was that awful. It was more of an irksome ache that persisted no matter what I did, rather as a piercing pain. The issue wasn't a lack of movement or stretching because I often do yoga. I also have shoulders that move a lot. I was going to the doctor earlier this year to have my shoulders examined, and since they were so awful, I would have had surgery if the doctor had recommended it. Following three months of collagen use, After taking the collagen for 3 months, the pain COMPLETELY vanished! I didn't even remember what it was like to not live with joint pain, and now I am free of it. I take mexican coffee sometimes along with moda from modafinia, is it because of that? Second, even as a little child, I battled dry hands and lips that would never go away. These two regions would get so dry that they would bleed and bruise. People would ask me if I had a significant health problem because of how red and flaky the corner of my lips would get throughout the winter. I've tried a lot of various products over the years, but the ones that work best for treating bruises are Bepanthen and Cicaplast. I would still need to use hand cream and chapstick, though, at least five times a day. The dryness has significantly improved while taking collagen. My lips and hands are still dry a bit, but it is enough for me to use chapstick and hand cream only once a day, and I dont even notice the dryness anymore. Previously, it caused me massive annoying discomfort.

The third benefit, is that somehow my lips became plump again. Back in my teenage years, I used to have very plump lips, but as I was aging into my late 20's, the plumpness decreased a bit. But now they are plump again, not like in my teenage years, but they look similar to when I was in my very early 20's.",1,1737104240.0,Biohackers,2,1.0,False

I am up cannot sleep  help

So after baby teeth came out, my mom and dad, where are your teeth.  Finally a dentist could give it a name, and it was not greed to get more cash for ""losing a tooth""  

OLIGODONTIA  missing more than 6 adult teeth

Spent tons of $$$$$$$$ on crowns, bridges, now implant supported dentures.

Moved to new area, my efforts to replace primary doctor, and every other type of doctor the world makes you think you need.  AND  I am starting to sweat just to wright it, DENTIST, ORAL SURGEON, ENDODONTIST.

Think about it, ""oh yes get in the chair, lights camera ACTION. The shiny silver knives, the bright lights, in your MOUTH.  

I was missing 11 adult teeth.  I could have bought a house with cash for the amount of money my Dad spent, and another house with money as an adult I have spent and continue to spend,

Moved to a new city, kids are gone, parents passed, divorced, what else start new

The task to replace medical doctors and dentist is enough to make you stay where you are.

I have ""a implant supported denture""  at least that is what Delta Dental claims. Found a good dentist recommended by my neighbor.  All good. Then needed maintenance or so I thought on my ""implant supported denture"".  I had to give up the bridges, and at the advise of dentist a implant supported denture.  Which means 5 implants, and prostheses anchored to implants.  It does not come out, and be prepared to purchase every cleaning implement   available.

Back to moved to a new area, dentist referred me  to oral surgeon.  Office was nice, staff nice, ok, this will be ok.  NO NO NO dude takes a look inside my mouth, he looked like he had seen a ghost, a mad ghost.  The verbs he used to match his scary expressions I could not hold back the tears.  I thought I had made the right choice getting this IMPLANT SUPPORTED DENTURE, $50,000 multiple trips to get the proper fitted ""denture"".  Back to the recent, Oral surgeon, skip the details, wants to remove the prostheses cut the gum portion back to have implant screws and my gums exposed.  It has been 6 months and $5000 worth of ""fillers"", the oral surgeon decides Delta is not paying enough for him to finish the treatment plan he presented to me six months ago. Let us not forget the horror in the OS eyes, telling me ""you look like you are chewing tobacco""""you need filler"" tons of filler.

What to do?? called my dentist (simple problems)and the one that referred me to oral surgeon.  ""oh we are so sorry to hear that""  bla bla, I am going to refer you to yet another type of dentist, a cosmetic dentist.  Oh the office with the white chairs, free fancy waters, tea, coffee, and snacks. Oh wow.NOT, after the $150 to reserve the appointment, ""yep can not help me"" going to refer me to yet another dentist ""Prosthodontist"".  2 months out for a appointment, and yes another $150 to reserve the appointment.  

But wait, one.5 hours away???? yes, and no guarantee it will be a match.  Oh 3 hour drive time.  and what..... You stopped accepting insurance January 1 2025?  Back to zero.

Delta Dental, gave me 3 dentists, one was the dentist 3 hour drive time, and has decided not to take insurance, the other, ""does not work here any more""  oh no......... sweating, one left, email, I cannot even talk without crying, oh you are in a different state?????

What to do???? I have 5 implants, exposed screws titanium screws yes I taste metal, lets not even go to looking at my mouth in the mirror, Edward Scissor Mouth,  yall get the picture.

What should I do?  I cannot live the remainder of my life like this..Oh yes it has been a bonus, lost 22 pounds mash potatoes are my besties

Open to any advise.

1i3bsog,https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1i3bsog/accusations_i_dont_understand/,Accusations I don't understand,"Hi guys! I need advice on something that happened to me.

First, let me give you a bit of a background.

In april, with encouragement of my therapist, I decided to ask out a colleague from work (from different department). She declined and said she had a boyfriend. The rejection was civilized and we never had any issues after that. Me asking her out was to learn how to deal with possible rejection in such situations.

Few months later a new girl started working in my department. Before I noticed it I really started to like her, so I decided to shoot my shot and askes her out. She said she needed some time to think about it. After around 2 weeks she accepted to grab a coffee with me. At the beginning of what I thought will be a date she said that she is after a breakup and is still in love with her ex. We talked for a while and then each went their own way. I thought it won't cause problem because after that meeting she was acting normal. Nothing out of ordinary.

Fast forward to today. She messeged me on company's communicator and said she wanted to talk and asked me to come to the conference room. It was unusual but I wouldn't imagine what was about to happen.

From the very beginning she accused me of following and trying to control her. Basically she said I was stalking her. She said that I:
- knew where she lives (I don't, only know district on which she lives like with other coworkers),
- check when she comes to work, when she leaves work, what she does (we work in the same department so naturally everyone knows those things about others, it's not classified), for example I once joked that she was late, when she came to work a bit later than usual and she said she took it as I was controlling her attendance,
- know where her bus stop is and which bus she takes (the bus stop is right before entrance to the company and as I'll be moving apartments I found out we will be taking the same bus because I already used it a few times),
- bought new apartment near her to be able to control her. She said she was terrified when she heard where it is located (this one is the most ridiculous, who in their right mind would take a loan and buy apartment just to stalk a girl, I'm not crazy, plus I bought it because it ticked all the boxes, not because it was near her house),
- said that she could tell me some tips about the neighborhood and that it was creepy (it was meant to be a joke but I guess she doesn't understand my jokes. BTW what is wrong with giving other person some guidance?),
- probably pray on girls at work. She said she knows that I asked the other coworker out and allegedly other coworker said that I was following her and intentionally took the same bus as her (there was a time when my line was under construction and I had to take a detour, plus I was not interested in that coworker.

After that she said which girl from our company will be next and she feels threatened by me and is considering resigning from work.

I assured her that I'm not following her or that I never followed anyone else. I told her everything I put in the brackets above. I said that I'm sorry if my behavior ever made her feel not safe and that I will not engage in any sort of interactions with her from now on.

I'm devastated and I don't know what to think. She talked about it with at least two girls from my company and I'm afraid she will tell people that I'm some sort of a creep or psychopath. I decided to cut all interactions with her and see what will happen.

I never though someone will treat me this way. Especially when she never gave any kind of sign that she feels uncomfortable in my presence.

What to do you guys think? Was anything I've done not appropriate? Did I cross some kind of line? Honestly I don't think I've done anything wrong, but feedback would be greatly appreciated. What would you do in my situation?

1i3bq73,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1i3bq73/floodlight_42/,Floodlight 42,"The Hillvale abattoir was a relatively old building by the town’s standards. Built in the early 1930s, the building was repurposed for the slaughtering of cattle in 1988 by then-Mayor Glenn Reuben. The move had been a political power play more than anything else, sighted as ‘*Glenn Reuben Will Turn an Embarrassing Money-Taker into an Empowering Money-Maker!*’ The move had secured him the votes he needed. 

Due to its inherent nature, the building had been constructed in seclusion on the outskirts of town — out of sight and out of mind for the public — up a small incline, to the southwest of the lower suburbs. It sat in relative isolation until the latter half of 1992, when an influx in Hillvale’s population — and therefore, rubbish — meant that the old dump was no longer fit for its purpose. Consequently, it was filled in and a new one dugout in the valley beside the abattoir. 

Being neighbours with the abattoir meant that whenever a strong wind blew through the valley beside the facilities, the smell from both the dump and the rotting offal would carry into the lower outskirts of Hillvale. As such, it wasn’t unusual for each to blame the other for the stench. 

But, in the quiet confines of the night guard’s security office, the smell from the dump wasn’t something that bothered me; the flickering of a lone floodlight was. 

‘Murph,’ I said to the snoring guard beside me. ‘Hey…’scuse me...*Murph!*’ 

‘Hmph?’ Murph snorted. His big bushy moustache waddled as his upper lip quivered, a dribble of spit sticking to his old, haggard-looking lips. ‘What…what’d I miss?’ 

I pointed to the far-left screen. ‘Is this…is it normal for the lights to do that round here?’ 

‘Do… what?’ The guard yawned and slapped his lips together, rubbing his eyes before leaning forward in his seat. ‘What am I looking at, kid?’ 

As if pointing wasn’t enough for the old codger, I leant over and tapped the monitor. The label stuck to base of the screen read *Stockyards*. ‘This floodlight out in the yard. Its, uh, number...’ I looked at the laminate map of the facility on the desk before me, tracing my finger to the stockyard. ‘*Number 42*. It keeps turning on and off. Is it normal for them to do that? Flicker, I mean?’ 

If the number had meant anything, the old security guard didn’t show it. Through dreary eyes he stared at me blankly — a man sleep disturbed — before smiling and kicking back his chair. With a solid thump, the burly guard put his boots on the edge of our shared desk, just shy of the keyboard. ‘Possums maybe? Rats? I don’t know, some punk kids on a dare possibly?’ he shrugged. ‘Or maybe it’s just a big ball of moths overwhelming the motion sensor.’ He stretched out his hands and put them behind his head, yawning widely. ‘You know, this building is rather old, and — if memory serves — many of the lights in this place were repurposed from the original structure.’ He paused and squinted at me. ‘This place wasn’t always an abattoir, you know.’ 

I rubbed my lip at the carefree nature of the man. I wondered if I myself would get that old and blasé if I worked here long enough. ‘Yeah, ok then I guess that makes sense. But — ’ a thought occurred ‘ — what about the sensors? The light might be old but surely the sensors aren’t?’ 

Murph shrugged casually and waved a hand. ‘You’re new here kid and I get it. Straight outta high school, payin’ your way to university to make somethin’ of yourself, it’s understandable. Really, it is. But, if you wanna impress the boss and all that jazz, and if you’re trippin’ that hard about a faulty old light, why not go out there and check it out? I’m telling you it’s nothing but — ’ He pointed towards the security booth door and let out a loud yawn. ‘Maybe you’ll let this old man catch up on some much needed shuteye in the meantime, hmm?’ 

The air of the abattoir was still and heavy as I passed by rows upon rows of dark, empty slaughter pens en route to the stockyards outside. The feeble light from my torch danced across the aisles, casting vivid, lifelike shadows over the empty cattle pens either side in a dark mockery of the condemned animals during the day. 

I regularly paused to consult my laminate map. When I did this, I would casually glance over my shoulder and make sure that the footsteps I heard behind me were indeed only echoes of my own. The dark concrete corridors were oppressive with their acoustics. 

That’s what I told myself, anyway. 

From the roof above hung the stainless-steel hooks, silent, watching, their glistening points swaying gently in the stale breeze. Every so often the torch beam would tilt up, reaching deep into the web of chains dangling from the ceiling rails. 

*How many cattle have these hooks pierced? How many animals knew that this was their last moments, their last breath? How many warm carcasses have these rails carried away to be sliced up and packaged?* 

I shivered slightly at the thought — glad that I wasn’t the one strung up by the hooks — and I tugged at the lapels of my coat. I pushed the grisly thoughts from my mind and trudged on down the cold, lonely corridors. 

Floodlight 42 was situated on the wall above the main cattle yard out the back of the abattoir. As I approached the exit to the yard, I could see the errant light beam shining underneath the crack of the door. It would flicker on, tremble brightly, then flicker back off. I flicked my torch off and I reached for my keys, unlocked the exit, and stepped out onto the gravel of the yard and— 

—out into complete darkness. 

*What gives?* 

The moon hung low in the sky, its lunar phase at half, casting soft rays of white, pearlescent light across the outside of the old abattoir. In its glow I could see the lace of old, moss-stained brickwork rising up the side of the building. I could also see the gloomy silhouette of the floodlight up on the wall, its light inexplicably dead. 

The stockyards floodlight 42 oversaw trailed away from the building. In the grey of the moon, I could see the silhouetted layers of the yard rails — rows upon rows of these stalls — each stretching back down the incline and into the neighbouring fields. 

My feet crunched on the gravel as I sauntered out into the middle of the clearing, between the front of the stockyard and the outside of the abattoir. Flicking my torch back on, I shone it up the steep old wall. The reflectors of the dead floodlight winked back at me. 

*That thing was flickering crazier than a dog on heat and now…nothing?* 

Frowning, I looked up at corner camera and waved at my office-bound partner. I mimed a what the hell motion and pointed up at the dead light. 

*Pointless*, I thought, dropping my hand. *The old coot was probably fast asleep. Not that he gave a crap about it anyway.* 

In the stock pens far off down the incline, I heard the rustle of cattle. It was almost inaudible, hooves on grass being much softer than boots on gravel. 

Out of curiosity, I turned toward the pens, my back to wall. 

Behind me, the floodlight simmered, clicking violent before buzzing into life, bathing the clearing in bright yellow. 

Shocked and crunching gravel, I spun on my heels to look at it and — 

It turned off. 

‘What-?’ I said to the night air. 

Confused, I waved my hands trying to trip the sensor again. When it wouldn’t work, I walked backwards toward the stockyard, waving my arms comically. 

*This so isn’t in my job description*, I reasoned. *Murph was right: just file a report with maintenance and-* 

The far-off rustle sounded again. This time it was closer, up the incline, and loud enough to hear over my boots crunching the gravel. 

I turned, my back to the dark light, and shone the torch into the gloomy stockyards. Once more I was bathed in brilliant light, my shadow stretching out before me, touching the edges of the front-most pens. 

I managed a ‘*huh?*’ while rotating to face the wall. 

The light turned off. 

In the dark, I frowned. Curious as to what was triggering it, I twisted my hips side to side, waved my hands and performed a few ridiculous star-jumps to get the bloody thing on. 

The holding pens rustled. The noise was closer this time, partway up the incline. 

Catching my breath, sure it wasn’t cattle, I turned to the stockyard, torch at the ready and was hardly surprised when floodlight 42 burst into life behind me. Ignoring the faulty device, I cupped my hand around my mouth and yelled ‘*HELLO*?’ out across the cold, gloomy night. 

Nothing. 

‘*ANYBODY OUT THERE*?’ 

Quiet. Aside from the soft breeze blowing around my ankles, the air was still. The floodlight hummed behind me, its light barely crossing the first row of the stockyard. 

‘*This abattoir is private property*!’ I recited verbatim. ‘*Anybody found to be trespassing on or around the premises will be* — *urgh! Hell,* what is *that!?*’ A pungent odour hit my nose. I dropped my torch to the gravel and retched. As I did so, I turned back to face the abattoir wall. 

Floodlight 42 clicked once and turned off. 

‘Argh!’ I gagged, holding my nose against the wafting stench. Frustrated at the lack of consistency with the light, I kicked the gravel of the clearing and stomped around, my back to the stalls, as the stench of rancid meat flooded the cool night air. 

Behind me, something big and heavy moved through the railings. The noise was very near, grunting and scuffling angrily in the dirt, banging and rattling on the rails as it moved through the maze of welded pipe that made up the stockyard. With my hunched over back still to the rails, I heard the ear-piercing screech as something sharp dragged against the steel. 

The wind picked up, blowing from my ankles, up my legs and rustling my hair. With it, the stench was now undeniable: *Death.* 

I reached down, grabbed my flashlight and faced the stalls to see what it was. 

On cue, with my back to the floodlight, the clearing was washed with light. The cacophonic rattling in the pens stopped as suddenly as it had begun and the clearing was again plunged into a damp, heavy silence as the gusting wind slowed. 

I took a step forward, toward the pens, and — for a split second — heard a soft whisper. 

*Inside…inside.* 

I paused, tilting my head to the breeze. 

Deciding it was my imagination, I took another step. I held my torch high, shining it downwards, and tried desperately to see what was caged in the pens, just outside of the floodlights reach. 

*Don’t…look*, the breeze whispered softly. A small gust blew through the cuffs of my trousers again, caressing my ankles. *Things here…tonight...not…from…this earth*. 

I froze mid-step, the floodlight bathing my back. There was no flicker, no sound; just brilliant, warm light. 

*Inside…now…* 

Despite the warmth of the floodlight on my back, a cold tendril of fear snuck up my spine. 

I rolled my shoulders, shivered, and decided that the office would be warmer. Fixing the light wasn’t my job, anyway. 

  


‘No cows out there, kid, not at nights.’ Murph said, picking at his teeth. He had a coffee in front of him and was now wide-awake as I shivered into the warm room. 

‘Must be.’ I said, flopping in the chair beside the old man. I didn’t think I should tell him about the voices I’d heard. ‘I heard them, I swear. Big things, rustling out in the pens.’ 

Murph shook his head. ‘Nah, kid, it woulda been the wind. That Reuben fellow was skimp on money when he *repurposed*—’ Murph air quoted ‘—this joint back in the late 80s. A lot of them rails out there aren't actually tubes like they should be — they're bars, hacked up pieces of the old prison. Decades older than you. They tend to rattle when there’s a wind and such, probably from rust and shoddy joints. Besides,’ he held up his hands. ‘The dayworkers here empty the pens before they go home - what don’t get slaughtered in here go back to the fields out there. Come morning however,' he chuckled sadistically, 'the ones that survived the first day are front of the queue' 

‘Well,’ I reasoned. ‘They probably forgot one in there this afternoon.’ 

Murph chuckled. ‘Sure, coulda happened. Doubt it though.’ 

I was silent for a moment, then said, ‘It was weird though, the noise I mean. Each time floodlight 42 came on it would-’ 

‘Wait,’ Murph said, sitting up. He pursed his lips, rubbed his moustache. ‘Did you say *42*?’ 

I nodded. ‘Yea, that’s what I said. I’d said it just before I left here too. I told you-’ 

‘Yea, yea,’ Murph waved dismissively. His face had turned a shade paler. ‘I remember you said that. I just didn’t click.’ 

‘*Click*?’ I asked. ‘Click to *what*?’ 

The old guard's eyes glazed over. His brow furrowed. He opened his mouth, hesitated, then said. ‘If I remember correctly — and that’s a big *if*  — that one is an original light, carried over from the old building.’ 

‘Yeah, so?’ I slumped in the seat, my shoulders feeling heavy. ‘You’ve already said they were skimp and — judging from the state of this place — its still a reoccurring theme.’ 

Murph shook his head, uncertain whether to smile or frown. ‘Yes but if memory serves, floodlight 42 lit up an especially nasty place in the prison…’ 

Murph paused. He let the words hang, unsure of himself, as if divulging the information might get him in trouble.

When it was clear the man wouldn’t continue without a nudge, I said rather abruptly. ‘And that nasty place? The prison showers, I’m guessing…?’ 

‘Worse. That light was the last thing many people saw.’ Murph said, not meeting my eyes. ‘Floodlight 42 shone into the gas chamber.' ",2,1737101726.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

Over the years I've done different diets, joined gyms, and had short term success but I can never sustain it and always eventually bounce back to my peak weight. I have always had a big appetite, drank lots of soda (I dont like coffee), and got hangry if I didn't eat every 5 hours. My wife and I are turning 40 this spring and going on a spring break trip with a large group of friends. I didn’t want to go being the fattest I've ever been. I needed something extra, something that would stop me at the appetite level given my busy life. I can happily say I've found it.

One of the most interesting things I've noticed is how it's made soda taste. 
It's hard to describe but it all tastes weird now to the point where it's almost undrinkable. This has definitely helped me a lot. Has anyone else has this side effect? 

Another side effect I started having once the meds ramped up was tingling hands. I really didn't like this. I seemed to have narrowed it down to the green pill and have reduced it back to a half of pill twice a day and now I don't get it anymore. I'm also wondering if anyone else has had that side effect. 

As far as sleep, I've always kind of struggled with that... as I write this at 2am. I did notice something interesting there though. I used to never really remember my dreams. Now I have the most detailed dreams and often feel half awake during them in the couple hours right before I get up. 

For weight loss, I have been very pleased with my results. I went from a guy who had to always eat and plan my day around food to a guy that can eat nothing for an entire day. I started losing weight almost right away. The pills curbed my appetite pretty quickly. I get the occasional hungry day where I eat a pretty normal amount and wonder if my body is getting used to the meds but then the next day I eat almost nothing and I'm totally fine. I haven't tried to diet any certain way and I haven't exercised at all. I've also had a couple of work trips to areas with good food during these 7 weeks and managed to continue to lose weight. I do plan on shifting my meals more to protein and starting to lift weights again because I know it'll make me look better. 

Anyway hope this helps others! Will report back when more progress is made. ",1,1737101607.0,HimsWeightloss,0,1.0,False
