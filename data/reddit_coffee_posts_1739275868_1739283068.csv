Hey everyone! So I've been taking with this guy for a while know, and we hit it off very well, went on dates and pretty much talk everyday.

So we were joking about this photo he was to do for work, and I jokingly said for him to do something sexy and he replied by saying ""to seduce HR?"" and I said ""if she's cute as me then sure! Maybe you can get some benefits!"" He said ""she's cute but not as cute as you tho, but those benefits sound good""

We kept joking about it, and I said in a voice note ""go get those benefits!"" and he then replied in a voice note too ""she actually told me we should go for coffee, and I said why not, and I promised her I would, so I'll do my best to get them laughs""

He asked some other things, and i replied very dry and he texted me again. I dunno I just felt weird about it.

Well maybe I'm too sensitive but that just sounds like a weird thing to say to someone you're getting to know... am I wrong? Should I just move on or it's just him being honest and joking around?",1,1739282300.0,Bumble,0,0.67,False

I’m moving to Surat in a coupel of months and I’m currently looking for reliable furniture and appliance rental services in the city. I’ve checked out famous services like Furlenco and Rentomojo, but they don’t seem to be available in Surat. I’ll need essential furniture like a sofa, coffee table, dining table, wardrobe, and possibly a few smaller items, along with appliances like a  TV and microwave.

I'm not looking to buy furniture (not even second-hand), just rent. Does anyone know local rental services or businesses that offer both  furniture and appliances for rent? Any recommendations on where I can find good deals and customisation like Furlenco or tips to where to look?

But sometimes I’ll mobile order my coffee so that if there is a long drive through line it’s ready for me inside. 
Sometimes though, traffic is amazing and there’s no drive through line, so I end up pulling up to the drive through window less than 5 minutes after I place my order. 
This has happened like 3 times and each time at different Starbucks they make kind of a big deal (nicely of course) about me having JUST placed the order and if I would give them 5-10 minutes after placing it before coming in or driving to the window, or just wait to order at the window because that would be “faster”. 
My question is- do yall have to do mobile orders in a specific order? Can you not just take mine out and work on it if I get up to the window and it isn’t ready yet? Why is this any harder than me just ordering at the window? It’s not ready yet either way.
Truly just want to know. I want to be respectful if it is somehow truly making things harder.

The transmission is incredibly determined to run in the highest possible gear at all times.  It will almost always be running the motor at ~1100-1200 RPMs when cruising at in-town speeds, to the point where the whole truck will just be shuddering while I'm driving around, like its lugging the motor.  Even going up smaller hills it won't downshift until super late after the motor sounds like a coffee can full of marbles.  I know LSPI is more common in DI turbo motors, is there a way to distinguish if that's what is happening?  Even if it is, can I do anything about it?  

I had been running 87 octane fuel for most of the life of the truck, but tried a couple tanks of 93 to see if that would help and it makes no difference.  I always just use the standard driving mode, obviously changing into sport it behaves differently but I don't want to have to do that manually every time and that's the extreme other end of the spectrum.  A friend has mav with the same drivetrain and his acts similar, but doesn't seem quite as aggressive as mine about staying in a high gear.   

This also seems to be more noticeable the colder it is for whatever that's worth.

Is this normal and appropriate behavior?  Do I need to worry about LSPI and premature engine failure?",2,1739281950.0,FordMaverickTruck,1,0.75,False

Para sa peace of mind sinabi ko sa kanya na baka pwedeng mag seperate Taxi na sila papunta at pauwi sa restau na isshoot vv. Nagalit siya sakin kasi sayang daw ang ₱950.00 na pamasahe. Sabi ko kahit ako na magbigay, para sa peace of mind ko. 
Kung tutuusin yung 950 na pamasahe barya lang sa kita that day. 

Here's why I don't like the model. 
• One time tumawag ako sa kanya, sinabi niya sino mga kasama niya pero di niya nabanggit na nandon din ang model. 
• Nag yakag kumain ang isa niyang tropa, kasama yung model. Sabi ko, pwede bang mag pass ka? Di ako kampante sa babae na yan. Nagalit siya sakin at sinabihan niya na sinasakal ko siya at kontrolling daw ako. Sabi ko kelan ako naging kontrolling sayo? Noong araw lang daw na 'yon.  Hindi ko alam na nasa labas na siya, kasi nakikipag talo pa din siya sakin. Bigla niyang sinabi ""naririnig ako ng mga ibang tao WALANG KONTROL ANG BUNGANGA MO"". Then nalaman ko nandon na pala siya sa lunch out with the model. 
• Naka react siya sakin mga tagged post sa babae, pero di daw sila friend sa fb. Na check ko naka follow siya sa IG ng babae.
• Palagi siyang may tinatambayan na coffee shop, palagi kaming mag kausap kahit nakatambay siya don. Kahit may kausap siyang iba hinahayaan niya lang na open phone niya. So sanay na akong ganon, isang taon na siyang ganon e. One time, di kami mag kausap noong pumunta siya sa coffee shop, tumatawag ako sa kanya. Napansin ko kada tatawag ako nag lalakad siya palabas or palayo sa table. Which is hindi normal na ginagawa niya. Sabi niya sakin ""ano ba sa tingin mo may babae dito? Wala kang tiwala sakin? Palagi mo na lang akong binabantayan!"" Hindi ko pinag hihinalaan na  may babae don, that time anxious lang ako kasi mahina ang gig. Gusto ko lang siya makausap sana. Then nakita ko that time, naka story sa babae na nadon din siya sa shop. 

• Ngayon, kinuha niya yong hand model. Tapos nagulat ako alam niya ang buong background ng babae, wala daw pambayad sa renta ng bahay. Walang trabaho, walang sweldo. Ganito katagal na walang work. Sabi ko pano mo nalaman? Sabi niya nakwento lang sakin ni kaibigan 1. Sabi ko aahh. Sagot niya sakin ""ano ibibigdeal mo yan?"" Mataas na ulit ang boses niya. Sabi ko hindi ok lang. 
Bakit ako nag tataka na bakit tanda ng asawa ko ang details tungkol sa babae? Siya yung tipo ng tao, na nasabi ko na ang mga bagay bagay di niya palagi maalala lagi niyang reason sakin ""alam mo naman makakalimutin ako"" o kaya ""alam mo busy ako"" ultimo errands ko, check up ko di niya maalala.

He arrived Sunday, and while we have plans to travel to the capital city together on Thursday, I am still working until then. Not even a few hours go by yesterday until a local guy that I met for a coffee date once messages me on Instagram, asking if I saw this new profile that popped up. Sure enough, it’s the guy visiting me. I wasn’t at all bothered by his being on Grindr, but my acquaintance tells me that this guy has been online all day, beginning with my departure to work. Today, I get back on grindr myself, and I checked it about once an hour. Sure enough, he’s online constantly, only disappearing for about an hour at one point (and of course my mind jumps directly to him finding a hook-up). 

I message him, asking if he found anything interesting. He tells me that nobody wanted to meet him for a coffee. I tell him that I find that strange; why would he be looking for dates while 
visiting a guy he supposedly really likes? He says that he just wanted company. Again, this answer makes me even angrier, but at least he’s honest (to my knowledge). 

Am I overreacting? Listen, if this were a friend, I would be fully supportive. But no, he came under romantic and sexual pretenses, and I just really don’t find this type of behavior to instill trust.

I have a fairly healthy diet, I’m a vegetarian, I drink one caffeinated drink a day, usually coffee. I am on my period which seeing the comments may be a trigger!

My ex-girlfriend broke up with me two years ago almost exactly. The relationship lasted for one year, She blindsided me, told me she loved me but was not in love of me out of nowhere, and left. She treated me like she loved me from the beginning ot the end, and she is the one who was asking me to tell her how i love her because i was not very expressive for the first few months, although i told her when i felt like so and she was happy, she also was the one who convinced me that i needed to move with her to another city the next year because she was gonna move there and i quote ""i don't want to lose you because i love you so much"". Fair. Although i guess the last ten days i had felt something weird but nothing alarming or at least not to the extent that she was gonna leave me, i thought she was stressed and that was it. I was devastated, i didn't plead or beg but i suggested that we could see each other less frequently in order to reignite whatever it is that was there because i loved her. She started crying and told me she almost made a huge mistake, we cuddled, but 30 min later she said that she in fact decided to leave, so she left. I had told her that i was not gonna contact her but if she wanted to contact me, she was free to do so.

I texted her two months later asking for a coffee date, she declined and sent me a screenshot of the two texts we exchanged (weird, i thought at the time that she wanted to send the screenshot to a friend of her or maybe another dude to show him that her ex contacted her... i did not answer and left her on read, probably a mistake from her part...)

i never contacted her again, and she never contacted me again, which hurts even more. How can you jsut dump soembody you spent one entire year with, convinced that you love him o the extent he sacrificed some of his own goals, and then proceeded ot dump him like a piece of shit and never look back ? It 's crazy. I didn't go in to all the details because want you to stay focused and interested while reading this, but i thought about her and all the memories of her breaking up with me and what i've done to deserve that every day since then. Every day. I felt anger every day, sadness other days. It did not matter if i met an objectively more amazing woman, or if i succeeded in any of my endeavors, i thought about her and was sad or angry, more angry than sad to be honest most of the time. So angry that my face , i'm frowning all the time now. People who have not seen me since before i was with her told me i looked way more mature now and cold. I do not care anymore about what anybody thinks because i feel deep inside that she actually left me because she thought i was ""too nice"" which i was with her but only because she was with me and not because i wanted to gain anything from her ? Anyway, that's just a feeling i had but i might be wrong...

Meanwhile, i met a lot of women with whom i had amazing sex and even more good things. I traveled a lot, i started my own company, i made more money than i had ever made before. I'm a gym guy, and i'm closer to my final form than i've ever been.I met amazing people, i started going out of my comfort zone, i gained so much confidence in my self, i introspected and gained a lot of emotional intelligence, i feel like i'm closer to the man i always wanted to be than i have ever been. THis trauma changed my brain structure i believe, it is crazy. I was so afraid of public speaking before, it was my number one fear. I do not care the slightest anymore, i can talk for hours in front of thousands of people. I was so afraid of first dates also, or to show my sexual interest in a blatant way, i am not anymore. It's like a switch flipped and now i am my real self.

However, a few weeks back, i starting thinking about her again but a lot more than like i did every day since two years. I had thought i was maybe not over her but at least somewhat to he extent i never would think about contacting her again ever. But I thought about her so much that i stalked her on the internet (she does not have any social media, we only texted at the time and she's completely out of the internet) and i found her profile on linkedin. I got her email and since then i' have been thinking to email her everything i have been thinking and feeling in detail. I feel like i can''t just keep all of this to myself anymore. I feel that it's not fair that i never got the time to first process my emotions and then tell her everything, whereas she manipulated me while she was with me to deal with the break up ( she told me so) and then just left. I understand that everybody advises not to seek for closure within the other person, but only within one self, but deep inside my heart doesn't feel the same.

I was driving to work from home a few hours ago, it's a 30 minutes drive. I broke down and started crying for thirty minutes out of nowhere. For the whole thirty minutes like she just had broken up with me, for no reason although i had been feeling down because of what i told you right before these pas few days. I have no reason to cry other than this in my personal life, i'm in good shape and have everything i wish for. I decided to type this as soon as i reached the office. As i type this, i can feel anger, because the main theme that haunts me is her thinking i'm some sort of ""nice guy"" whose love i showed her was a sign of weakness out of not wanting her to leave me, which it was not even though at the time i did feel lonely because of some external circumstances that i had in my life and that had nothing to do with her, and i saw her multiple times a week for emotional support, but i never was clingy or anything like that. I just told her once that i didn't want to lose her over a petty argument we had that was of no significance objectively, two weeks later she was gone. I don't want to get into more details because this text is getting too long and i want your answers and your rational advice so i'm gonna stop here and if you want more details , just let me know.

IN summary, the relationship was nothing short of excellent, she blindsided me two years ago, i never stopped thinking about it every day since then, tomorrow is her 25th birthday and I'm contemplating writing her an email where i tell her everything i feel, that i actually love her and that i do not care if it inflates her ego or not, that, that is what i feel and i'm doing it for myself, that i do want to see her, hug her and kiss her and that is what i have been feeling and that i'm ready to do so even if she's more or less far from where i live (i don't know where she might be but probably 200km away at most). I want to let her know that i did everything in my power to be the man i always wanted to be, that even though she didn't see the value in me at the time, i did see it in her and that i think it's a ""right person, wrong time"" moment, and that after a lot of self-reflection i think i genuinely love her as a human being and want to see her before i die. I don't want to die before seeing her again.

Do you think i am crazy ? DO you think i am being emotional ? i don't agree with the general advice that ""she's an ex for a reason"". I really don't as i saw with my eyes that some people just drift apart and then reunite years later and live happily ever after or at least, don't hold grudges and stay friends and make genuine human connections. I'm surrounded by very ambitious and proud people who are not toxic by any means but very self-centered and have a big opinion of themselves and they all advised me against what i want to do. But their only reason is always ""you're gonna inflate her ego, she's likely to be very flattered that you still think about her and that she left this much of a huge impact on you and she won't respond or respond in a cold manner that will leave you absolutely shattered into pieces"". I understand where this reasoning comes from but... so what ? I don't care. I'm doing it for me. I genuinely know my value. I know where i stand. I know i do not need her. I accomplished many things in life and i'm gonna keep doing so until the day i die. I do not really care if she thinks I'm weak because it's actually what's been hurting me since the breakup, so it is not gonna change anything, however, i can see now that i am not and that her opinion of me is not who i am, so i do not care. i do however care about this human, it's the truth, why lie to myself ? I do love this person and feel this innate desire to hug her and tell her that everything is gonna be ok, and make her feel safe, secure and loved the same way she made me feel when we were together. What's wrong with me feeling this and expressing this even if she does not feel the same way if i send the email ? I feel like even if she never answers or answers and tells me that she does not love me at all and that the past is the past, or that she has another man in her life, i would feel relieved. Maybe i'm wrong ? I don't know, i'm lost. I'm sad, i am angry and at the same time i want to tell her i love her. What do i do ?

I understand that i'm currently very emotional and i need you to put some rationality in me, please. Thank you ! Sorry, english is not my first language",2,1739281672.0,ExNoContact,4,1.0,False

We don’t have much space, as it’s a 2 bedroom apartment with one large kitchen/living area.

The issue is, my gf wants more of a say over how the place is organized and decorated so that she feels at home. I’ve told her I’m fully behind whatever she wants to do, as long as our roommate is cool with it (not an issue, she’s pretty chill). We just haven’t got a lot of money for furniture or decorations since we only recently moved in, so these plans haven’t really advanced in the last few weeks.

That sets things off again, as my gf chews out my roommate for sticking her nose in our business, while I’m trying to calm everyone down. Door slams, she goes out to get a coffee and clear her mind or whatever. I’m left there mortified at our roommate being witness to this.

Any advice on how to not make it weird?,"TLDR:   Likely to see a colleague M50 with whom I’ve had a connection and year-long long distance flirty exchanges with in a few months.  I’m nervous but looking forward to it.  I’m over-thinking it - but any do’s or don’ts before we meet up?  Or while we are together?

Over the last 3 years, I’ve gotten to know a professional contact (50M) and we see each other in-person about once a year at an annual conference.  Two years ago, we had a connection but nothing happened.  And last year, we spend an unexpected amount of time together. 

Last time, we spent a full day together as tourists, had a few coffees, late night chats and went out dancing one night.  Afterwards, he called and emailed with flirty messages often.  

We have fallen into a pattern of talking or emailing about once a week - we both have kids, hobbies, other responsibilities and live 7 time zones apart.   (I’m in the US, he’s in Europe - so often talk on his drive home / during my lunch break). He has become a kind, supportive and close friend over the last year. I suppose developing feelings for him. 

Now we’re in touch with other colleagues about planning this year’s meeting.  I am looking forward to seeing him - but am also terrified. 

I’m new to dating again after a 20 year marriage.  He’s been asking about my travel plans and hotel choice.  I don’t want to read too much into it.  

Worried that I’m just vulnerable or that I’m imagining our connection. So trying to figure out whether he feels similarly and whether I should say anything to him before we catch up in person.

**Liquides Imaginaires - Blanche Bete:** Milky, sweet, fairly pleasant but unremarkable. It smells like coffee creamer, if I’m being honest. 5.5/10

*Notes: Top notes are Milk, Ambrette (Musk Mallow) and Mystikal; middle notes are Tuberose, Jasmine, Incense and Mahonial; base notes are Vanilla, Musk, Tonka Bean and Cacao*

.

**Serge Lutens - Chergui:** A very unique scent. It’s slightly sweet from the honey, a little powdery, a little musky, and the tobacco really sings on the dry down. The incense note adds some intrigue. Surprisingly, I do also pick out the hay note, and it totally works. 8.5/10

*Notes: Top Notes are Iris and Rose; Mid Notes are Honey, Tobacco Leaf, Hay Absolute, Leather; Base Notes are Amber, White Musk, Tonka Bean, Incense, Sandalwood*

.

**Serge Lutens - L’Orpheline:** Oh, this one is nice. It sits close to the skin, but it’s not a skin scent at all. It’s spicy and incense heavy. It’s a mysterious scent that reminds me of rainy nights in, writing poetry and burning incense to set the mood. 9.5/10

*Notes: Black pepper, Dry woods, Incense*

.

**Strangers Parfumerie - Sweet Farewell:** First sniff gives me an almost nutty richness that I think is the rice powder. As it dries down, I get the creamy coconut milk, Tonka bean, and woody notes. I was worried this would be too sweet for me, but it’s well balanced. I’m a little obsessed with rice notes lately and this one does not disappoint. 8.5/10

*Notes: Coconut Milk, Nipa Palm Leaves, Vanilla, Palm Sugar, Cedar, Rice Powder, Sandalwood, Musk, Pandan Leaves, Tonka Bean, Cashmeran, Ebony*

.

**Diptyque - Eau Duelle:** Immediately I get a hit of herbaceous juniper. The vanilla then starts to come through, but it’s not front and center like it usually is. The cardamom adds a layer of interest, while the woody vetiver gives it depth. This scent is proof that vanilla doesn’t have to be gourmand. Diptyque is quickly becoming one of my favorite houses. I could see myself owning a full bottle of this one. 10/10

*Notes: Pink peppercorn, juniper berry, cardamom, cypress, frankincense, calamus, Black ceylan tea, cistus, Bourbon vanilla, vanilla pod, vetyver, cypriol, ambroxin*

.

**Imaginary Authors - Fox in the Flowerbed:** This is not a typical scent for me, but I wanted to try something different. This is very flowery, with the slightest hint of sweetness from the honey. The pink peppercorns give it a sharpness that I’m not sure if I like or not. Overall, a pretty if not simple scent. It’s not for me. 5.5/10

*Notes: Jasmine, Tulips, Frankincense, Wildflower Honey, Pink Peppercorns, Silver Thistle, Alpine Air*

.

**Masque Milano - Lost Alice:** This reads as a little medicinal at first, but after a couple minutes, the steamed milk accord starts to shine through. I find the carrot note really interesting, and it blends surprisingly well with the tea note. Although it’s not something I’d wear, I appreciate the complexity of this one. 7.5/10

*Notes: Bergamot, Ambrette Seed, Clary Sage, Black Pepper, Carrot, Orris, English Tea, White Roses (Painted Red), Sandalwood, Broom Absolute, Fleur de Lait (Steamed Milk Accord)*

.

**Andrea Maack - Pavilion:** On the opening, I could’ve sworn there was a leather note, but there isn’t. There’s a richness here I can’t quite place and it may very well be the oud—this is my first fragrance with oud, so it’s just a guess. This scent feels busy, like passing through a crowd of people on a sidewalk. I get hints of the saffron and rose, but they’re not too strong. The praline and honey add just a touch of sweetness. I do like this one, but again, not one I’d personally wear. 7/10

*Notes: Praline accord, Honey, Saffron, Rose, Rose essential, Patchouli, Vanilla, Amber, Oud accord*

.

**D.S. & Durga - Amber Kiso:** The wood notes here are exquisite. They work remarkably well with the leather and maple. This brings back memories of cabin stays in the mountains, taking in the morning air on the deck after a restful night’s sleep. There’s a familiarity to it that I dig so much. The patchouli is not super strong here, which I appreciate in this instance because it lets the other notes really shine. 9.5/10

*Notes: Japanese cedar, incense, cypress, maple, patchouli, iris, hinoki, leather, treemoss*

.

It was like I had stepped into a carefully curated, pre-packaged ‘hipster experience’ rather than a city with an organically grown alternative scene. Has anyone else felt this way?

A few things stood out:

* The street art in the ""alternative"" districts wasn’t spontaneous—it was funded by the same guy who owns a major hostel (*Fabrika*). The graffiti didn’t reflect Georgia’s history or current issues; instead, it was Westernized, featuring Anne Frank and the last white rhino. It felt weirdly disconnected. You would think there is enouph going on..
* Many ‘hipster’ venues (cafes, bars, shops) seemed to have popped up all at once, following a template rather than developing naturally over time.
* The coffee shops had 12 dollar Espresso Martini's but little engagement with local wines, which are amazing btw. Even the books on the shelves were just decorative—literally just empty covers.
* Vintage stores had absurd prices: €50 for a used Zara jacket, while a brand-new jacket in a local shop would cost a fraction of that. These places clearly weren’t meant for locals.
* Food was sushi and generic ‘trendy/avocado type’ dishes, but where were the modern takes on actual Georgian cuisine?

**I’ve been posting a lot about my law school journey here, and this might be my last. I’m at a crossroads and could use some advice.**

**A little backstory: I’ve always wanted to become a tax lawyer since my work has always been in the tax field. But the past semester was brutal. I got sick during midterms, flunked my exams, and while I managed to recover in the finals, it wasn’t enough to make it in three subjects—something that has never happened to me before. 😞**

**Now, I’m reminiscing about my life before law school. After corporate work, I actually had a comfortable routine—watching the evening news, sometimes having coffee with friends, then sleeping by 10 PM. Now, as a freelancer, I had to let go of a few clients to focus on school, and while I still earn, my income is lower compared to last year. Meanwhile, law school demands keep piling up, and I’m wondering: is this still worth it?**

**It’s already the first week of classes, and I still haven’t been able to get the pump going. I don’t feel as motivated as before, and part of me is really questioning if I should keep going.**

Short Devotional about Networking and relationship building

Introduction
------------

Networking and relationship-building can feel overwhelming at times. However, when pursued with the right heart, the connections we foster can be a tremendous blessing in our lives. Just as a small seed grows into a magnificent tree, a simple introduction can blossom into a lifelong friendship or a fulfilling collaboration. As we journey together through this devotional, let us discover how our faith can inspire us to forge strong and meaningful relationships.

God created us to live in community. No man or woman is an island, and we need one another to thrive. In building relationships, we have the beautiful opportunity to reflect God’s love, grace, and compassion. Today, let’s explore how we can enter conversations and connections with the intention of glorifying God and serving those He places in our paths.

Bible Verse
-----------

Proverbs 27:17 (NIV): “As iron sharpens iron, so one person sharpens another.”

Meaning
-------

The essence of Proverbs 27:17 highlights the transformative and beneficial nature of relationships. Just as iron sharpens iron, interactions with others can refine, challenge, and strengthen us. In the sharpening process, friction is involved, much like the ups and downs we experience in relationships. However, these challenges are a crucial part of growth, drawing us closer to the likeness of Christ.

Relationships rooted in genuine love and support add immeasurable value to our lives. They provide opportunities to learn, grow, and become better versions of ourselves. By engaging with others, we can expand our wisdom, share our burdens, and celebrate mutual successes.

Moreover, God calls us to build each other up, offering encouragement, accountability, and love. By fostering these fundamental elements in our interactions, we help sustain and nurture not only our faith but also the faith of those around us.

Actions to Take
---------------

– Reach out to someone today with a word of encouragement or gratitude, acknowledging the impact they have had on your life.

– Make time in your schedule for coffee or a meal with a friend, aiming to foster deep and meaningful conversation.

– Join a community group, fellowship, or network to connect with people who share common interests and values, seeking opportunities to grow and learn from one another.

– Offer your skills or resources to help a friend or a group in need, opening doors to build relationships through service.

– Be intentional in your listening, focusing on understanding the needs and experiences of those you meet.

Journal Prompts
---------------

– Who in my life has been like iron sharpening iron for me? How have they influenced my life positively?

– What are some areas in my relationships where I can offer more encouragement and support?

– Reflect on a relationship that has taught you a valuable lesson. What did that experience teach you about yourself and others?

– How can I incorporate prayer into my process of building and nurturing relationships?

– What steps can I take to nurture new connections that align with my values and beliefs?

Prayer
------

Dear Lord,

Thank You for the gift of relationships and the ways they enrich my life. I pray for wisdom and grace to build deep, meaningful connections. Help me to be a source of encouragement and strength to others, just as You have provided for me. May my interactions reflect Your love and compassion, and may they bring glory to Your name. Guide me to the right connections that will mutually sharpen and inspire growth. In Jesus’ name, Amen.

Social Posts
------------

– “Just like iron sharpens iron, let’s build each other up and become stronger together. #TogetherWeGrow #Proverbs27v17 ❤️”

– “Nurturing meaningful relationships is a beautiful reflection of God’s love. How are you connecting with those around you? #FaithfulConnections #CommunityLove 🙏”

– “In the beauty of life’s connections, we find strength, love, and purpose. Let’s cherish and nurture our relationships! #IronSharpensIron #BlessingsInCommunity 🌟”

– “Your interactions today could be the start of something wonderful. Who will you connect with? #BuildRelationships #DivineConnections ✨”

– “Grateful for the love and support that community brings. Let’s continue to grow together in faith! #CommunityStrength #Proverbs27v17 💪”

Conclusion
----------

In our journey of networking and building relationships, we are called to reflect the light of Christ in every interaction. With intentionality and love, our connections can become sources of growth, comfort, and inspiration. As you continue to nurture your relationships, may you find joy and fulfillment in the beautiful tapestry of community God has woven around you.

Has anyone else experienced something similar? 

Let me explain:

* I noticed that many of the trendy spots (hostels, cafes, street art) all seemed to have appeared around the same time. The graffiti in the ‘alternative’ districts was sponsored by the owner of a popular hostel (Fabrika). Did you know that? It felt orchestrated, as though it was all part of a commercial plan rather than emerging organically from the local culture.
* The graffiti didn’t reflect the real culture or issues of Georgia. Instead, it was filled with clichés and western perspectives, referencing things like the last white rhino and Anne Frank – topics that seemed disconnected from the real challenges and stories of Georgia. It just felt out of place and not genuine.
* Despite all these ‘hipster’ spots, the food wasn’t local at all. They served sushi and international options, but there was no innovative take on traditional Georgian cuisine. No vegan twists on local dishes, no influence from the rich flavors of Georgia. It just felt… generic.
* I sat down in a few coffee shops that were supposed to be trendy. But when I picked up a book, it was literally just a cover. No pages inside. Second, I don't really believe lokals are looking for a 12 dollar Espresso Martini. 
* I went into several vintage stores, but the prices were insane. A used Zara jacket for €50? That’s more expensive than vintage shops in Amsterdam. A new jacket there costs about €10 if you go to the city centre. Clearly, these shops aren’t catering to the locals. It felt like the goods were placed there purely for tourists with money to spend, not for the residents.

How has no one noticed that Tbilisi has turned into this hyper-commercialized, fake ‘hipster’ bubble?",0,1739280402.0,tbilisi,9,0.45,False

I'm not in a rush and I wanna take time knowing someone so I prefer chatting first to get a vibe of someone before actually meeting up. Around a week or so can be ideal to do it. 

So, about me...
• I've been single for almost two years and it's been a year since I went out on a real date and I miss doing fun activities and getting to know someone.
• I work in the food industry (graduated BS Food Technology in PUP) and also has a side hustle of freelance c0nsultancy. I'm passionate about my job and career and I hope my future partner would support me along the way. 
• I'm 4'11"" and 4'11.5"" on a good day. Overweight BMI based on Asian standard (since most people here are obsessed with BMI so I'm putting it here to filter them lol)
• People would say I look younger than my age.
• I'm inked in several parts of my body.
• I'm an only child but I've been independent basically my entire life and have been living alone for almost 15 years in Manila (my parents bought the apartment but I've been paying all the bills since I started working).
• I have two adorable but chaotic cats, both were adopted and strays. They are my entire life even if they bite and scratch me XD
• Photography is my hobby and I like taking photos of basically anything except myself.
• I cook decent foods but my specialty is adobo which my friends love (I make it extra spicy by request).
• Into horror and psychological movies / series so basically into A24 movies & Junji Ito masterpiece (I'll let you guess my fave horror movie)

With just a handful of ingredients and simple preparation steps, you can create a dish that feels both indulgent and satisfying.

# Why Choose Beef for Your Croissants?

[Beef](https://glonfo.com/tag/beef/) is a versatile and flavorful protein that works beautifully with the creamy richness of Swiss cheese and the buttery layers of croissants. It’s an excellent alternative to pork, offering a hearty and savory bite that pairs perfectly with the other ingredients. By using thinly sliced smoked deli beef, you’ll achieve that tender texture and smoky taste that elevates this dish to gourmet levels.

# Ingredients for Baked Beef and Cheese Croissants

Here’s everything you’ll need to make 12 [delicious mini](https://glonfo.com/these-mini-air-fryer-potato-skins-are-the-ultimate-comfort-food-cute-delicious-and-so-easy-to-make/) croissants:

* **⅓ cup unsalted butter**, at room temperature
* **2 tablespoons Dijon mustard**
* **2 green onions**, thinly sliced
* **1 tablespoon honey**
* **½ teaspoon sea salt**
* **¼ teaspoon black pepper**
* **12 mini croissants**, halved horizontally
* **1 pound thinly sliced smoked deli beef**
* **12 slices Swiss cheese**, diagonally sliced
* **1 large egg white**
* **2 teaspoons poppy seeds**

# Step-by-Step Instructions

Follow these simple steps to create your [baked beef](https://glonfo.com/beef-bacon-and-baked-pasta/) and cheese croissants:



1. **Preheat the Oven** Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Lightly oil a 9 x 13-inch baking dish or coat it with nonstick spray to prevent sticking.
2. **Prepare the Butter Mixture** In a small bowl, combine the softened butter, Dijon mustard, green onions, and honey. Season the mixture with sea salt and [black pepper](https://glonfo.com/black-pepper-chicken/) to taste. This spread will add a burst of flavor to every bite.
3. **Assemble the Croissants** Slice the mini croissants in half horizontally. Spread the prepared butter mixture evenly on both sides of each croissant. Fill each croissant with a generous layer of smoked deli beef and a slice of Swiss cheese. Close the croissants to form sandwiches.
4. **Arrange in the Baking Dish** Place the assembled croissants in a single layer in the prepared baking dish. Make sure they are snug but not overcrowded.
5. **Prepare the Egg Wash** In a small bowl, whisk together the egg white and 1 tablespoon of water. Brush this mixture over the tops of the croissants to give them a golden, glossy finish. Sprinkle poppy seeds on top for added texture and flavor.
6. **Bake Until Golden Brown** Place the baking dish in the oven and bake for 15-18 minutes, or until the croissants are golden brown and toasted. The cheese should be melted, and the beef warmed through.
7. **Let Them Rest** Once out of the oven, let the croissants stand for about 5 minutes before serving. This allows the flavors to settle and prevents any overly hot bites.
8. **Serve Warm** Serve these baked beef and cheese croissants warm for the best experience. They pair wonderfully with a side salad, fresh fruit, or even a cup of coffee or tea.

# Tips for Perfect Baked Croissants

1. **Use Fresh Croissants:** For the best texture and flavor, use fresh mini croissants from your local bakery or grocery store. Stale croissants may not achieve that perfect flakiness.
2. **Customize Your Cheese:** While Swiss cheese adds a classic touch, feel free to experiment with other cheeses like cheddar, provolone, or Gruyere for a unique twist.
3. **Don’t Skip the Egg Wash:** The egg wash not only gives your croissants a beautiful golden color but also helps the poppy seeds stick to the top.
4. **Make Ahead Option:** You can assemble these croissants ahead of time and store them in the refrigerator until you’re ready to bake them. Just add a few extra minutes to the baking time if they’re chilled.

# FAQs

# 1. Can I use regular-sized croissants instead of mini ones?

Absolutely! If you prefer larger portions, use regular-sized croissants instead of mini ones. You may need to adjust the baking time slightly to ensure they are heated through and golden brown on top.

# 2. Can I substitute beef with another protein?

Yes! While this recipe uses smoked deli beef, you can substitute it with [cooked chicken](https://glonfo.com/do-italians-cook-chicken-pasta/), turkey, or even vegetarian alternatives like grilled vegetables or plant-based deli slices for a meat-free option.

# 3. How do I store leftovers?

Store any leftover [baked croissants](https://glonfo.com/berry-croissant-bake/) in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat them in a preheated oven at 350°F (175°C) for about 10 minutes to restore their crispiness.



# 4. Can I freeze these croissants?

Yes! Assemble the croissants as directed but don’t bake them yet. Place them in an airtight container or freezer bag and freeze for up to 3 months. When ready to bake, let them thaw in the refrigerator overnight before baking as instructed.

# 5. What can I serve with baked beef and cheese croissants?

These croissants are versatile and pair well with many sides such as a fresh [green salad](https://glonfo.com/spicy-green-salad-smoothie/), roasted vegetables, potato wedges, or even a bowl of soup for a complete meal.

Baked beef and cheese croissants are a simple yet elegant dish that’s perfect for any occasion. With their flaky exterior, savory filling, and cheesy goodness, they’re sure to become a favorite in your household. [Try this recipe today and enjoy the irresistible aroma and taste](https://glonfo.com/potato-bake-recipe/) of freshly baked croissants!Baked beef and cheese croissants are the ultimate comfort food—a delightful combination of buttery, flaky pastry, gooey melted cheese, and savory beef.

1imyfew,https://v.redd.it/ad5nbm6ngiie1,Self Development is Something to do in VA!!,"Hey yall!

Today's post is a super simple post shouting out two coffee shops that I've been to to get some work done: Sweet Beans Coffee and Roastery in Carrollton and Gather in Chesapeake.

It's a friendly reminder that 'something to do' doesn't have to be anything crazy or extravagant or even just for the fun of it to be honest. It could be a passion project.

You as a Virginianite can choose to do something with a purpose. You can choose to do something that will inevitably improve your life and/or the lives of others.

If you're ever bored or find yourself mindlessly scrolling on social media, I'd like to encourage you to shift to focusing on something that will improve your quality of life.

Perhaps that comes in the form of reading a book, taking a course, attending a seminar, going to a networking event, talking to influential people, forming a book club, writing some poems, learning a trade.

The possibilities are endless!! And the beautiful thing about self development is once you unlock a new skill, get a new certification, or produce something, no one can take that away from you!!

One of the best byproducts of working on yourself and becoming a better version of you is that it also improves our community here in the great, great state of VA!!

Think of the positive impact you can have on the youths and people around you when you make it through the trials and tribulations and level up!! Your success and your perseverance can inspire others to work on themselves in turn, creating an ecosystem of consistent improvement!!

So I'd like to ask you, how are you working on yourself right now? What personal project are you working on? What are you building? How are you growing?

I can't wait to see the next wave of positive change makers and global impactors spring up all around Virginia!!

Remember, it's yet another beautiful day here in VA!

-Dinnie in Virginnie

So I headed to the washroom situated at the lobby, slithered into a cubicle and proceeded to unleash the kraken without a second thought. I mean, this is Sri Lanka right, we all use the bum gun.

Mission accomplished, I reached confidently to my right for the bidet spray. Nothing. “Hmm, maybe it’s on the left”, I thought, reaching over. Nope. No bidet. Just a lonely roll of toilet paper staring back at me like it was judging my life choices.

“Oh shit” I thought (literally) “how do I fix this?”. I look at the toilet paper and look at the cistern compartment. A light bulb went off in my head. I grabbed handfuls of toilet paper, dunked them into the cistern water like I was making some kind of sad, soggy sandwich, and then proceeded to wring it out onto my butt a couple times like a DIY bidet. 

Let me tell you, the level of self-disgust I felt in that moment was unimaginable. I felt violated. Betrayed by Kingsbury. Abandoned by the gods of hygiene. I emerged from that cubicle a broken man, questioning every life decision that led me to that point.

Distribution of contraband modifications, Calico assumed, or usage thereof. There wasn’t much else you could get executed for anymore: the line between acceptable and certain death grew thinner with the day.

Whami sat in his room, practicing with his drum kit. He hadn’t shown his face in several days - his YouTube channel, his dream of content creation, everything he had known for the past seven years had been dead for weeks as fans and creditors alike searched everywhere for him, be it wanting to know how he is or wanting him to pay his dues.

Life couldn’t go on as normal for much longer. The radio continued to blare out, louder than Calico was hoping for. “*Drug stores now being raided at a weekly basis as citizens riot for medical supplies… riots in the auction house causing it to be shut down temporarily…*” People like him consistently landed themselves into significant debt, debt that they couldn’t even think to pay off. For some ungodly reason, though, Whami still seemed to have kept his optimism from before.

Calico picked up the phone and dialed Whami’s number, before brewing himself a black coffee. His Abiphone XIII Pro, while highly sought after upon release, had, like pretty much any product, plummeted in value. *Ring, ring, ring.* He always picked up on the third ring.

“Listen, Whami. How’s everything? I’ve brewed myself a coffee, if you’d like to come over to my house, I don’t think it’d be too much of a problem - ”

Whami’s excited voice rang out from the other end. “Hihi! Sure, I don’t think it’ll be a problem at all! :D”

Oh, sweet summer child. Even amidst everything that was happening, Whami hadn’t lost his innocence. Calico silently wished the same applied to him.

The radio continued to blare. “*The museum, bazaar, and travelling zoo have all been closed temporarily in anticipation of a global recession. Gather as much supplies as you can, and make sure they last -* ”

Well, that was quite enough of that pessimistic shit. Even if it was true, it didn’t make it all the much more pleasant to hear. Calico pressed the off button and got up from his sofa.

——————

Whami stepped up to the doormat, carefully wiping his shoes on the rug, before gingerly ringing the doorbell. Footsteps pitter-pattered over to the door, as it opened to reveal Calico’s face. Dark, messy hair, obscured by an indigo cloak, with blue, brooding eyes and a mouth that hadn’t smiled for as long as it could remember, a perfect contrast to Whami’s: scruffy but orderly purple hair, with an equally purple shirt and a gentle smile.

“Is that coffee I see on your desk? Smells really nice, you have a talent for brewing,” Whami grinned to Calico before setting himself down on the floor.

“I guess I am.”

“Life’s been quite tough, to be honest. I’m still trying to find the guy who scammed me. I’ve just - sometimes I wake up, and I try to think of a reason to get out of bed, or even a reason to breathe.”

“We’ll find him, don’t worry. We can make your money back, and you can make the apology video. Your fans trust you! They’re worried about you. You were all over the news yesterday.”

“Yeah, I noticed.” Whami forced a smile sarcastically.

“Don’t be so down, Whami. Everything will be fine. Have some coffee.”

Whami took a gentle sip, before a twinkle appeared in his eyes. “HOLY - this isn’t like any coffee I’ve had before.”

“You won’t be able to sleep for days,” Calico teased.

“Why sleep when you can drink coffee?”

Slowly, a smile formed on the edges of Calico’s lips, before he burst out into laughter. It felt nice to be able to have fun again.

I’ve got plenty of friends, im not going to beg and it’s totally fine to not be that close to people so I kind of got over it yk. I’ve hosted 3 events recently (one a proper thing the other 2 more casual) and invited them and they’ve not come to any of them. I want to invite the other couple and the 2 girls to my birthday game night but it would mean I’m inviting the whole friendship group and not them. I am keeping open the option to afterthought invite them if they kick up a fuss cause they can come if they really want to. WIBTA if I did this? ",3,1739279258.0,AmItheAsshole,9,0.8,False

I never realized how much I needed a high-quality water filter pitcher until I tried this one. The first thing that caught my attention was the compact 6-cup size, perfect for a small refrigerator or even a crowded shelf. It’s lightweight, easy to handle, and fits snugly into tight spaces. The turquoise color adds a pop of personality, which is a nice touch for something as practical as this.

The SmartLight filter change indicator is a feature I didn’t know I needed. It’s incredibly convenient, with its green, yellow, and red light system that tells me right away when it’s time for a filter change. No more guessing or trying to remember how long it’s been! This water filter pitcher came with one Standard filter, and the instructions were straightforward, making the setup a breeze. I’ve tested both the Standard and Elite filters, and while the Elite lasts much longer (up to six months), the Standard does the job well for about two months.

I live in an area where the tap water has a noticeable chlorine taste, so I was keen to see how this pitcher would handle it. After the first use, I immediately noticed a difference. The water tasted clean and fresh, without the harsh chemical aftertaste. It also removes copper, cadmium, and mercury impurities, which is reassuring for my peace of mind and my family’s health.

The lid design deserves a special mention. The easy-fill locking mechanism is genius, preventing spills and making refilling stress-free. I’ve used some other pitchers where the lid would awkwardly flop off during use, but not this one. The pouring spout works flawlessly, with no drips or leaks. However, the small size does mean I find myself refilling it quite often, especially when I’m entertaining guests or during a busy day with the kids running around.

**Pros**

* Compact and space-saving design ideal for small fridges.
* SmartLight filter indicator simplifies maintenance.
* Removes chlorine, copper, cadmium, and mercury for better-tasting water.
* BPA-free materials with no plastic aftertaste.
* Easy-fill locking lid prevents spills during refilling.

**Cons**

* Limited 6-cup capacity requires frequent refills.
* The filter indicator relies on a battery, which may need replacement over time.
* Standard filter lifespan could be longer compared to competitors' filters.

**Comparison to Competitors**

When I compared the Brita Metro to similar water filter pitchers, a few things stood out. For instance, the ZeroWater pitcher offers additional filtration stages, but it’s bulkier and doesn’t fit easily in a small fridge. The PUR filter pitcher, while comparable in price, lacks the SmartLight indicator, making it harder to track filter changes. Additionally, the Brita’s design feels more durable than the competition, and the ease of use with the locking lid is a clear advantage. However, if you’re looking for a larger capacity, the PUR Ultimate Dispenser might be a better choice, though it sacrifices portability and compactness.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money**

In terms of value, the Brita Metro is worth its weight in gold if you’re looking for a compact, efficient solution to improve water taste and quality. While it doesn’t boast the highest capacity or the most advanced filtration system, it offers an excellent balance between functionality, convenience, and affordability. The included SmartLight indicator alone justifies the investment, especially for busy households. The filters themselves are reasonably priced and easy to find, which adds to the product’s overall value.

The Brita OB11/OB06 Metro Water Filter Pitcher has seamlessly integrated into my daily life. Whether I’m making coffee, filling the kids’ water bottles, or just grabbing a glass of refreshing water, it’s always reliable. I’ve even found myself recommending it to coworkers who were looking for an eco-friendly way to cut down on single-use plastic bottles.

1imy46h,https://www.reddit.com/r/Friendzone/comments/1imy46h/i_friendzoned_him_after_he_friendzoned_me/,I friendzoned him after he friendzoned me,"This is mainly just an vent. Okay, so I (20F) met this guy (20M) in high school a few years ago. We became friends, and over time, I developed a crush on him. I acted on it, and it led to a situationship. We never slept together, but we spent a lot of time cuddling and having deep conversations about feelings and other personal things. At the time, we were both 18. One night, while we were cuddling in his bed, watching a movie, I asked him what we were. His response? ""We're just friends, and nothing more."" Okay? I didn’t really question him—I just took a step back and kept our interactions strictly friendly. After that, our connection naturally faded.

Now, after two years, he suddenly reached out, wanting to meet up. I agreed, since we had been friends before. To be honest, when we met for coffee, it was pretty boring. At first, I thought it was just because the connection had faded over time, but as we talked, I realized he hadn’t really moved on in life since high school. He still had no real goals or direction, and it felt like he was stuck in the same place. Anyway, it wasn’t that bad, and I was surprised when he wanted to meet up again so soon after. At first, I declined—honestly, I just didn’t have the time—but he kept asking until we finally found a date that worked for both of us. This time, we met at a game café and played some board games. It was actually kind of fun—until I started getting the sense that he was testing the waters and trying to flirt. I didn’t respond to it in any way, which should have been a clear sign that I wasn’t interested. Thankfully, he didn’t push it.

The third time we met, he started asking things like what my ideal type was and whether I had a Valentine. I told him that I wasn´t looking for an relationship right now, but instead of getting the message, he panicked and asked if I had ever had feelings for him in the past. I told him that at one point, I thought we could have been a possibility, but he didn’t feel the same way, and I haven’t thought about it since. That’s when he claimed he had no memory of us ever having that conversation—then followed it up by asking if I would be open to something between us in the future.

I asked him what he meant by that. He started talking about how, in the past, he thought I wasn’t mature enough for him and that he had just wanted closeness. Then he went on about how he enjoys talking to me now and how much I’ve changed. So, am I just enough for him now, or does he actually have feelings for me? When I asked him directly, he told me that he did have feelings for me—then added that I should really think about my answer before giving it to him. He wanted me to be his ""life long partner."" I made it clear that I only saw him as a friend and that nothing more was ever going to happen between us.

Later that day, he sent me messages saying he didn’t see the issue. He told me that he struggles with opening up but was willing to face that fear for me. He also wanted me to explain my thought process behind my decision. So, I told him. I pointed out that he talked a lot about why he wanted me, emphasizing that I was more mature now than I was in high school. But based on his words, his idea of maturity seems to be just about living alone—when in reality, it also includes emotional intelligence and having real goals in life. If he had actually bothered to get to know the person I am now, he wouldn’t have started the conversation by asking if I used to have feelings for him. It was clear that he didn’t really care about what I wanted. When I tried to explain that if I were to spend my life with someone, I would need them to show me that they genuinely wanted me in their life, he seemed completely confused—like he couldn’t understand why simply saying he wanted me wasn’t enough. I also told him that if he has trouble opening up, he should work on that for himself—not for me, and not for anyone else. I told him that I was looking for something different, but I hoped he would find someone who wants the same things as he does.

He responded by saying that he needed time to gather his thoughts and that he had a lot to say. He mentioned there were some misunderstandings he wanted to clear up but that he couldn’t put them into words just yet. He told me he would give me an answer sometime next week... Wtf?

1imy449,https://www.reddit.com/r/feminineboys/comments/1imy449/femboy_fat_loss_101/,Femboy Fat Loss 101,"*Haii pookies!* So you wanna lose weight but feel like every guide out there is either ""eat salad, cry, repeat"" or written by gym bros who don't have the same goals as you? I feel you. I went from **85kg to 78kg** (still a work in progress—goal: 70kg twink lol) using science-backed strategies *that actually work*. Here’s everything I know:

---

### **Step 1: Calorie Deficit (Without the Suffering)**  
*There is more to it than ""Eat less, move more""*  

#### **What You NEED to Know:**  
- **Fat loss = Burn more than you eat**. Simple, but *how*?  
  - Your body burns calories by:  
    🔥 **Existing** (yes, breathing counts).  
    🔥 **Moving** (walking, fidgeting, putting ur thigh-highs in the bottom drawer).  
    🔥 **Digesting food** (no, that doesn't mean we can nom TwT).  
    🔥 **Exercising** (duh).  

- **Calculate Your Deficit**:  
  Use any calorie calculator to find your daily burn.  
  - Eat **300-500 calories LESS** than that number.  
  - *Example*: If your burn is 2500, eat 2000-2200.  

#### **Pro Tips:**  
- **No starvation**: Cutting too hard = hangry gremlin. Slow and steady wins the race.  
- **Track with apps**: MyFitnessPal or Lose It! 
- **Weekly average matters**: Eat 1800 one day, 2200 the next? *No stress*—balance it out.  

---

### **Step 2: Lift Weights (But Make It Femme)**  
*Road to Mewtu build.* >:3

#### **Your Gym Routine:**  
- **Squat Variations**: Leg press, hack squats, Bulgarian split squats. *For the front of ur thighs*.  
- **Hip Hinges**: RDLs, good mornings, back extensions. *For the back uf ur thighs and lower back*.  
- **Glute Focus**: Hip thrusts, kickbacks, glute bridges. *Because twinks deserves a huge dumpy*.  
- **Core Work**: Dragon flags (if you’re a masochist), weighted sit-ups, leg raises. *Flat tummy + ABS*.  

#### **Why Strength Training?**  
- **Preserve muscle**: Calorie deficits can eat your gains. Lift to stay toned, not floppy.  
- **Boost metabolism**: Muscle burns more calories than fat—*passive twinkification*.  

---

### **Step 3: Protein (Your New BFF)**  
*You have to eat ur ikea shark :c*  

#### **The Rules:**  
- **Aim for 2g per kg of body weight** (≈140g if you’re 70kg).  
- **Too much math?** Just prioritize protein in every meal.  

#### **Femboi-Friendly Protein Hacks:**  
- **Greek yogurt + sprinkles**: Yes, sprinkles. I know I eat like a child.  
- **Protein waffles**: Top with fruit and *zero-sugar syrup* (it’s a thing!).  
- **Shrimp tacos**: Low-cal, high-protein.  
- **Cottage cheese**: Mix with cinnamon and Splenda. Sounds cursed, tastes like cheesecake.  

*Pro Tip*: If you only hit 100g today, the world won’t end. Just do better tomorrow. 💕  

---

### **Step 4: Hacks for Hunger Management**  
*""I’m hungry AND want to look snatched. Help.""*  

#### **The Emergency Kit:**  
1️⃣ **Caffeine**: Black coffee or tea *10 hours before bed* (hunger suppressant + you’ll sleep).  
2️⃣ **Chew Gum**: Trick your brain into thinking you’re eating. *Mint flavor = bonus fresh breath*.  
3️⃣ **Shirataki Noodles**: 0 calories, 0 guilt. Toss ’em in soy sauce + chili flakes.  
4️⃣ **Zero-Speedrun Drinks**: Diet soda, sparkling water, *sugar-free MONSTER* :3 (we don’t judge).  
5️⃣ **Intermittent Fasting**: Eat all your calories in 8 hours. *Big meals = happy brain*.  

#### **Extra Magic:**  
- **Ditch liquid calories**: Juice, Soda, Shakes—replace with food you can *chew*.  
- **Volume Eating**: Load up on veggies (air-fried vegetables >>> sad salads).  
- **20-Minute Walks**: Do them after meals to curb cravings + debloat. (Walking in thigh-highs burns 5% more calories)

---

### **Final Note: You’re a Work in Progress (And That’s Okay)**  
*Look*, losing weight is hard—especially when you’re juggling femininity and AMAB biology. You’ll have days where you eat a whole pizza and days where you feel like a goddamn Greek statue. *Both are valid*.  

**Remember**:  
- **Hydrate**. Water flushes bloat + stops fake hunger.  
- **Progress > Perfection**. Lost 1kg this month? That’s 12kg in a year. *YAYYY*.  
- **Reward yourself**: Hit a goal? Buy those fishnets. You’ve earned it.  

Now go forth and conquer, cutie! And if you relapse? *We’ve all been there*. Just come back here, reread this guide, and stay adorable. 💖  ",4,1739279125.0,feminineboys,0,1.0,False

Unfortunately (but also understandably) most of all of those places close at around 8PM-10PM.

1imy1jr,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBeanReviews/comments/1imy1jr/best_coffee_scoop_perfect_pod_a03020_review_does/,Best coffee scoop Perfect Pod A03020 review: Does it really deliver?,"Using the Perfect Pod A03020, a coffee scoop with an integrated funnel, has been a surprisingly pleasant experience. As someone who starts their day with a cup of coffee brewed from reusable K-Cup pods, I initially underestimated how much convenience a simple tool like this could add to my routine. The product claims to save time and reduce mess when refilling reusable coffee pods, and honestly, it lives up to that promise in many ways.

The first thing that caught my attention was its lightweight but sturdy design. Made of durable plastic, the scoop is not only dishwasher safe but also easy to handle. Its two-tablespoon capacity is perfect for standard K-Cup pods, eliminating the guesswork that often leads to under- or over-filled pods. The integrated funnel is the real game-changer. I no longer have to worry about spilling coffee grounds all over my counter, as the flip-and-pour mechanism makes the process virtually mess-free. Even my clumsy teenage nephew managed to use this without turning the kitchen into a coffee ground disaster zone.

Back to the multi-purpose aspect of this scoop, I decided to put it to the test beyond coffee. The results? It works well for scooping protein powder, baby formula, and even loose tea leaves. While not its primary use, it's nice to know I can grab this tool for other kitchen tasks if needed. [Check Perfect Pod A03020 price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/product-reviews/best-coffee-scoop-perfect-pod-a03020-review-b099cq4m7v/)

Getting into the nitty-gritty, the product is not without its flaws. The snap closure mechanism, while generally effective, feels like it might wear out over time. I also noticed that if you're not careful when holding it, the scoop can accidentally pop open and spill its contents. This issue might not be a dealbreaker, but it's something to be mindful of, especially when you're in a rush. Additionally, the funnel’s size is optimized for standard reusable pods, so if you’re using a larger, non-standard pod, you might find this tool less useful.

**Pros**

* Integrated funnel eliminates mess during coffee pod refills.
* Two-tablespoon capacity is perfect for standard pods.
* Multi-purpose use for other kitchen tasks like scooping protein powder or tea leaves.
* Lightweight and dishwasher-safe for easy cleaning.
* Durable plastic build ensures longevity.

**Cons**

* Snap closure feels less reliable with frequent use.
* Potential for accidental spillage if not handled carefully.
* Limited compatibility with non-standard pod sizes.

When comparing this scoop to competitors, such as the OXO Good Grips Coffee Scoop or the Chef Craft Measuring Spoon Set, the Perfect Pod A03020 excels in its unique funnel integration. Neither of those alternatives offers the mess-free convenience that this product brings to the table. However, the OXO scoop does feel more premium in terms of build quality, and the Chef Craft set provides better value if you're looking for a multi-size measuring solution. Where the Perfect Pod stands out is in its specific design for K-Cup users, making it a great niche tool for those who rely on reusable coffee pods.

From a cost perspective, the Perfect Pod A03020 sits comfortably within the price range for specialty coffee accessories. Given its unique feature set and time-saving capabilities, it feels like a worthwhile investment for coffee enthusiasts. That said, if you’re on a tight budget and don’t mind a bit of mess, a standard scoop might suffice. For those who prioritize convenience and speed in their morning routines, this tool justifies its cost.

In daily use, the Perfect Pod A03020 has become a staple in my kitchen. Its simplicity and practicality have made my mornings a little smoother, even if it's not entirely flawless. While it may not replace more versatile measuring tools, it does an excellent job at what it’s designed for—refilling reusable coffee pods efficiently and cleanly.

1imy0di,https://www.reddit.com/r/writers/comments/1imy0di/constructive_criticism_please/,Constructive Criticism Please,"Would apprecitate some feedback from this excerpt on a short story I am writing. 

A neon sign buzzes overhead, casting my shadow in a sickly pink glow. The letters shift when I try to read them, flickering between languages I almost understand. They hum, like insects, like whispers in the dark. And somewhere behind me, or maybe ahead, or maybe inside my own skull, someone laughs—a dry, knowing laugh, as if they’ve seen this all before.

The alley spits me out into an opening, though the air still hums with the same strange electricity, the feeling that the world is folding in on itself in ways I can’t quite see. A warm breeze carries the scent of damp paper and old ink, the kind of smell that lingers in places untouched by time.

A bookshop stands at the corner, its wooden sign creaking softly as it swings in the breeze. Bookworm, it reads in faded Italic letters, the edges of the carving softened by years of rain and sun. The glass panes are fogged with a thin layer of condensation, blurring the rows of books stacked haphazardly behind them—towers of spines and covers leaning precariously, as if they might topple at any moment and spill their stories into the world. The doorway is narrow, framed by deep green shutters weathered to a dull patina. One shutter hangs slightly loose on its hinge, swaying gently with each gust of wind.

She sits just outside, on a low wooden stool, one leg crossed over the other, a cigarette held loosely between her fingers, its ember pulsing like a slow heartbeat. Her knee-high socks are patterned, the kind that suggest she found them somewhere rather than bought them. Thick boots, scuffed and worn, planted firmly on the cracked pavement. The blazer—faded, frayed at the edges—hangs off her like it was once something formal but has since forgotten its purpose.

She doesn’t look up immediately. She exhales smoke like a secret, the kind you only tell once, and then only if you’re sure the other person won’t misunderstand. The coffee cup in front of her is nearly empty, the last swirls of dark liquid tracing lazy circles in porcelain.

I slow my steps without thinking, drawn in like the air is thicker here, pressing me forward, making the space between us something tangible, something I have to step through carefully. The city noise thins in this pocket of time. Motorbikes murmur in the distance. A radio plays something old and scratchy from deep inside the shop. The light from the paper lanterns strung above shifts as if watching.

She shifts, just slightly, just enough for me to know that she knows I’m here. Not an invitation, not a dismissal—just an acknowledgment. Like a page turning. Like a test I haven’t yet realized I’m taking.

The second our eyes meet, something flickers—curiosity, recognition, or maybe just the weight of passing time—but I break it first. A moment severed before it can take root. I step past her, through the narrow wooden door, into the bookshop’s dim, dust-laden air.

Inside, the place is a labyrinth of towering bookshelves and carved wooden cubicles, partitioning the shop into sections like a forgotten archive. The walls are thick with peeling pastel paint—once a vibrant yellow, now aged into something softer, a memory of color. The ceiling, low and arched, carries the lingering ghosts of French colonial hands that built it, their craftsmanship worn but defiant against time. Stained glass windows filter light in fractured reds and blues, casting colored shadows on the checkered tile floor.

Hyper-Local Blogging: How to Build a Community-Focused Platform
---------------------------------------------------------------

In today’s digital age, hyper-local blogging has emerged as a unique way for individuals to build community-focused platforms that engage local readers while also creating earning opportunities. By addressing the specific interests and needs of your local area, you can establish a loyal following that values your insights and expertise.

So, how do you get started? First, identify your niche. Consider what’s happening in your community and what topics resonate most with your audience. This could range from local events, food reviews, outdoor activities, small business highlights, or neighborhood news. Pinpointing your niche is essential, as it helps you carve out a space for yourself and attract readers who are genuinely interested in your content.

Next, here are some key steps to building your hyper-local blog:

- **Choose the Right Platform:** Decide whether you want to use platforms like WordPress, Wix, or Medium. WordPress offers flexibility and a wide range of features, while others might be easier for beginners.
- **Focus on Local SEO:** To maximize visibility, implement local SEO strategies. Use keywords relevant to your community, such as local landmarks, events, and businesses, to enhance your search engine presence.
- **Produce Engaging Content:** Create valuable content that speaks directly to your community. This might include informative articles, interviews with local leaders, or profiles of local businesses. Remember to write in a way that's engaging and easy to read.
- **Incorporate Visuals:** Photos, graphics, and videos can significantly enhance your blog. Visuals not only make your posts more appealing but also help convey messages more effectively.
- **Network with Local Influencers:** Connect with other local bloggers or social media influencers. Collaborations can help expand your reach and attract new audiences who share similar interests.
- **Encourage Community Participation:** Invite your readers to share their stories, experiences, or opinions. Consider hosting guest blogs or Q&amp;A sessions to foster a sense of community.

Another important aspect is to leverage social media platforms. Utilize Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and even TikTok to share your blog posts. Engage with local community groups where you can share your insights and drive traffic back to your blog. When you share your content, always use relevant hashtags to improve visibility.

As you grow your blog, think about ways to monetize your efforts. Here are some effective strategies:

- **Affiliate Marketing:** Promote local businesses or products you love and earn a commission for every sale made through your unique link. This can be a great way to support local businesses while making money.
- **Sponsored Content:** Collaborate with local businesses or services for sponsored blog posts. Make sure the content is authentic and aligns with your audience’s interests.
- **Ad Revenue:** If your blog sees significant traffic, explore options like Google AdSense to earn money from ads displayed on your site.
- **Offer Services:** Use your blog to promote your skills, such as photography, writing, or event planning. This can lead to freelancing opportunities within your community.

Don’t forget the importance of consistently updating your blog. A regular posting schedule keeps your audience engaged and returning to your site. Consider setting a frequency that works for you, whether it’s once a week or twice a month. Quality over quantity should always be your mantra.

Building a hyper-local blog dedicated to your community can be a fulfilling endeavor. It's about more than just blogging; it’s about creating a space where local stories and voices can be heard. Remain authentic in your writing, engage with your audience, and continuously seek out fresh content. As a result, you’ll not only build a faithful readership but also unlock new avenues for income and community connection.

Embrace the opportunity that hyper-local blogging offers to make a difference in your community while pursuing your passion for storytelling. Together, you can cultivate a vibrant local platform that helps everyone connect and thrive.

Here are some compelling ways to earn money through your hyper-local blogging efforts.

### Affiliate Marketing

- Choose local businesses that align with your blog’s niche.
- Write honest reviews or create engaging stories featuring those products.

- Create a media kit detailing your audience demographics and traffic stats.
- Set clear pricing for different ad placements.

Approach your community with a value-first mindset; offer something that makes membership worthwhile.

Hyper-local blogging not only enhances local culture but also establishes you as a vital part of your neighborhood’s narrative, all while creating opportunities to earn money and share your passion.

Creating Compelling Content: Capturing the Essence of Your Community
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Creating rich, engaging content for your blog is not just about filling up pages with words. It's about capturing the essence of your community. Whether you're in a bustling city or a quaint town, your community has unique stories, voices, and experiences that deserve to be shared. Here are some strategies to help you create compelling content that resonates with your audience.

### Know Your Audience

Understanding who you are writing for is crucial. Your community is diverse, and each group within it has its interests and needs. Take some time to consider the following:

- Demographics: Age, gender, and economic status can greatly influence what type of content resonates with your readers.
- Interests: What hobbies or activities are popular in your community? Consider local events, sports, arts, or nature.
- Concerns: Addressing issues that matter to your audience can cement your blog as a valuable resource.

### Highlight Local Events

One of the simplest ways to engage your audience is by featuring local events. Create content that showcases:

- Upcoming festivals, fairs, and markets.
- Local workshops or classes.
- Community service opportunities.

By providing details such as dates, locations, and what people can expect, you make your blog a go-to resource for community happenings.

### Tell Personal Stories

Personal narratives are powerful. They connect people on a deeper level and evoke emotions. Consider sharing your own experiences or those of community members. Ask yourself:

- What funny or inspiring story do you have related to your town?
- Can you interview a local who has an interesting tale?

By weaving stories into your blog, you're not just informing; you're inviting readers into the heart of your community.

### Feature Local Businesses

Supporting local enterprises can foster a sense of community. Write about businesses that deserve recognition. Some ideas include:

- Interviews with owners about their journey and challenges.
- Reviews of products or services offered by local shops.
- Spotlighting special promotions or events they are hosting.

This not only benefits the businesses but also builds relational bridges within your community.

### Use Visuals Effectively

Images and videos can enhance the storytelling aspect of your blog. People are drawn to visuals, and they can make your content more vivid. Consider:

- Taking pictures of local events or scenic spots in your community.
- Creating video interviews or walkthroughs of popular locations.
- Using infographics to present interesting local statistics.

Visuals not only break up text but also provide a richer user experience.

### Stay Authentic and Relatable

This is perhaps the most important aspect of creating compelling content. When writing, remain true to your voice and experience. Avoid jargon that may alienate readers. Instead, aim for a conversational tone that allows your personality to shine through. Here are ways to maintain authenticity:

- Share your honest opinions and feelings.
- Encourage feedback and discussion within your comments section.
- Be vulnerable; sharing failures as well as successes can make you more relatable.

### Encourage Community Interaction

Your blog should not just be a platform for you to share content; it should also engage the community. Foster interaction by:

- Issuing calls to action, prompting readers to share their own stories or suggestions.
- Creating polls or surveys about local preferences or interests.
- Encouraging readers to submit their photos or stories to feature on your blog.

When readers feel like a part of the narrative, they are much more likely to engage with your content.

By capturing the essence of your community through compelling content, you not only strengthen local ties but also create an engaging platform for conversation and shared experience. As your blog grows, so will your connection with your neighbors and fellow community members. Start today by celebrating the uniqueness of your surroundings and let your voice be heard!

Engaging with Local Businesses: Building Partnerships for Success
-----------------------------------------------------------------

In today’s competitive market, local businesses are constantly seeking innovative ways to grow and thrive. One effective strategy is to engage with other local businesses to build partnerships that lead to mutual success. Collaborating with other entrepreneurs not only enhances your visibility but also fosters a sense of community. This approach can create opportunities that benefit everyone involved.

To start building these partnerships, it’s essential to identify local businesses that align with your values and goals. Consider the following steps:

- **Understand Your Brand:** Clearly define what your business stands for and what you can offer to others. Knowing your strengths will help you find compatible partners.
- **Research Local Businesses:** Explore your community to find potential allies. Look for establishments that share a similar customer base or target market.
- **Reach Out:** Once you’ve identified potential partners, reach out to them with a friendly and engaging message. Introduce yourself and explain how you can work together.

When approaching a local business, always present a win-win proposition. It’s important to convey how the partnership can benefit them as well. Here are some successful collaboration ideas:

- **Cross-Promotion:** Promote each other’s products or services through your social media channels, newsletters, or in-store displays. This can dramatically increase visibility for both parties.
- **Joint Events:** Host events together, such as workshops, contests, or community gatherings. These events generate excitement and draw in crowds who may not have been familiar with either business.
- **Special Offers:** Create exclusive promotions that encourage customers of one business to visit the other. For instance, a cafe could offer a discount on coffee to customers who show a receipt from a nearby bookstore.

Building a partnership involves nurturing a relationship over time. Here are some effective strategies to maintain this collaboration:

- **Regular Communication:** Keep the lines of communication open with your partners. Schedule regular meetings to share success stories, challenges, and new ideas.
- **Feedback Loop:** Establish a process for collecting feedback. This helps in understanding what’s working and what needs adjustment in your partnership.
- **Celebrate Wins:** Acknowledge and celebrate successes together. Whether it’s hitting a sales goal or successfully executing an event, recognition fosters a positive working relationship.

Engaging with local businesses is not just about making connections; it’s about creating a ripple effect within your community. When you collaborate, you strengthen not only your business but also the local economy. Customers tend to support businesses that contribute positively to their neighborhood. Here are some additional benefits of building partnerships:

- **Broader Network:** Each partnership expands your network, introducing you to new customers and business opportunities.
- **Shared Resources:** By collaborating, you can share resources such as marketing platforms, which reduces costs and increases effectiveness.
- **Enhanced Credibility:** Aligning with reputable local businesses boosts your credibility. Customers are more likely to trust and engage with businesses they see collaborating within their community.

As you engage with local businesses, remember to stay genuine and focused on building relationships. Each partnership should be built on mutual respect and shared goals. As you navigate these connections, stay open-minded to new ideas and strategies that can enhance your collaboration. Emphasizing authenticity will resonate well with both businesses involved and their respective customers.

Remember to showcase these partnerships in your marketing efforts. Share successes on social media, include partner stories in your newsletters, and promote joint events or offers. This visibility not only highlights your collaboration but also encourages other local businesses to engage and explore partnership opportunities with you. With the right approach, engaging with local businesses can turn into a powerful strategy for success in your community.

Utilizing Social Media to Amplify Your Hyper-Local Blog Reach
-------------------------------------------------------------

In today’s digital landscape, a hyper-local blog can serve as a powerful tool to connect with your community while earning money. But, to truly maximize your blog's potential, integrating social media strategies can prove invaluable. By effectively utilizing platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and others, you can amplify your blog's reach and engage with your audience on a more personal level.

### Identify Your Target Audience

Before diving into social media, it's essential to define who you want to reach. Ask yourself:

- What demographic groups live in my area?
- What interests and needs do they have?
- Which social media platforms do they use most?

By truly understanding your audience, you can tailor your posts to resonate with them. The key is to create content that addresses local interests, events, and issues that matter most to your community.

### Choose the Right Social Media Platforms

Not all social media platforms will serve your blog equally. Consider these popular options:

- **Facebook:** Ideal for fostering community groups and sharing local events.
- **Instagram:** Great for visually appealing content; use images to showcase local businesses, events, or attractions.
- **Twitter:** Perfect for real-time updates and engaging in local conversations.
- **YouTube:** Use video content to showcase interviews with local figures, events, or tutorials on community engagement.

Pick the platforms where your audience hangs out and focus your efforts there. By concentrating on a few channels, you’ll maintain quality over quantity.

### Create Engaging Content

Content is king, especially on social media. Here are some strategies to create engaging posts:

- **Local Stories:** Share stories that reflect your community’s history or current happenings.
- **Interviews:** Feature local business owners, artists, or activists to spotlight their contributions.
- **User-Generated Content:** Encourage your followers to share their experiences in your community, then repost their content with their permission.

Engagement boosts visibility, so ask questions or create calls to action, such as encouraging followers to comment on their favorite local spots.

### Use Hashtags Effectively

Hashtags can improve your blog's discoverability on social media. Create and use local hashtags that relate to your area. Combine general tags with specific ones, for example:

- **\#YourCity** - broad visibility
- **\#LocalEvents** - niche relevance
- **\#YourBlogName** - branding

Don’t overdo it, though. A few relevant hashtags are often more effective than a long list.

### Engage with Your Community

Social media is not just a broadcasting tool; it's a platform for conversation. Respond to comments, share followers’ posts, and participate in local discussions. You can:

- Attend local events and share your experiences live.
- Engage with local businesses by sharing their posts or tagging them in relevant content.
- Join local groups to discuss issues and share your blog content where appropriate.

This two-way interaction builds trust and loyalty among your audience and can lead to increased traffic to your blog.

### Monitor and Adjust Your Strategy

Regularly check the performance of your social media efforts. Look at metrics like engagement, shares, and follower growth to evaluate what's working. Adjust your strategy based on these insights. Use tools like Google Analytics and the built-in analytics from social platforms to track your blog’s referral traffic and audience engagement levels.

Through consistent engagement and strategic content creation, your hyper-local blog can thrive in your community. Not only will you build a dedicated following, but you will also discover ways to monetize your blog through local sponsorships, advertising, and affiliate partnerships. Keep the conversation going, and always be open to feedback. The beauty of a hyper-local blog is in its ability to bring people together, and social media can help make that connection stronger.

### Conclusion

Embracing hyper-local blogging offers a unique opportunity to connect with your community while earning money. By building a community-focused platform, you create a space that resonates with local residents and fosters a sense of belonging. This approach allows you to generate content that captures the essence of your neighborhood, whether it’s highlighting local events, sharing stories from residents, or covering hidden gems.

Monetization strategies further enhance this venture, allowing you to earn through affiliate marketing, sponsored posts, or local advertisements. By authentically engaging with local businesses, you can establish fruitful partnerships that benefit both your blog and the local economy. These connections often lead to cross-promotional opportunities, generating additional visibility and support for your hyper-local content.

As your blog grows, utilizing social media becomes crucial for amplifying your reach. Platforms such as Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter can be powerful tools to share your posts, connect with readers, and draw in new followers. By creating engaging content and actively interacting with the local community, you position your blog as a vital source of information and entertainment.

I'm still not using straws or vaping(and I'm pretty grumpy about that to be honest lol) so I at least want a hot cup of coffee to restore some of my sanity here. Post op instructions actually say I could start vaping again 3 days but I was told a week so I'm not doing that until tomorrow at the earliest but I'm still frustrated with all these different answers to the same questions. Why is there no universal guidelines on any of this stuff? Why tell me one thing then hand me a sheet of paper that says a different thing? I feel like I'm taking crazy pills trying follow instructions when instructions are all over the place.

Imagine if Gwanhee had cuddled with Minji in bed, being affectionate with her, holding her close (for 2 nights in a row)—and then the very next day invited Hyesun to his last date in Paradise because he was still ""unsure."" Be honest: wouldn’t everyone be saying, *poor Minji—how could he do that to her after spending the night like that?* And would they not be accusing him of leading Hyesun on?

Now, take it a step further. Imagine that during the date, Hyesun tells him she felt upset just from seeing Minji rest her head on him. That alone gave her mixed feelings, making her question whether she was really into him. But instead of reflecting for even a second, Gwanhee brushes past it, still acting interested, still playing the “I’m just confused” card.

But come on—if something *so* small made Hyesun doubt her choice, wouldn't it be fair for him to come clean and say, *actually, I was even more intimate with Minji?* Sian is free to do whatever she wants—she’s single, no one owns her—but let’s not pretend she didn’t intentionally withhold the full truth because she knew it might make Jungsu reconsider his feelings. That’s not just keeping her options open; that’s leading someone on.

And then—*after all that*—imagine Gwanhee still lets Hyesun give him a foot massage, lay next to him in bed, and hold his hand. What kind of mixed signals are these? And also, imagine he still locks eyes with her right before the final selection, making it seem like she might be his choice when he already knows he’s not picking her?

Wouldn’t this behavior be *immediately* called out if the roles were reversed? If a man did this, he’d be ripped to shreds for stringing two women along. But Sian? She gets a free pass. Are we really just letting this slide because she’s a woman? It looks to me that she might want o assure having 3 men after her in the finale.

And the panel? *Dead silent.* They had no problem dragging Taewon when he was out of line, but when it comes to Sian, suddenly they pretend they don’t see it. The elephant in the room was impossible to ignore, yet no one said a word.

Is it just me? I’m a woman, and if I were in Junseo or Jungsu’s shoes, watching this back would make me furious. I’d feel like a complete fool. Like I was treated like a doormat.

Also, one more thing. When she said there were others who chose her and she wasn't the one choosing them, but Jungse was always her first option. Please, let's be real—she was the one who chose Junseo for the coffee date, and then both Junseo and she chose each other right after Jungsu said he was going to go after her only. Sure, he wasn’t convincing, but let’s not lie and be honest. Don’t lead people on.",43,1739277942.0,Singlesinferno2,36,0.8,False

***Safeguarding the minerals supply chains for advanced technologies in strategic industries is an economic and national security imperative. Yet significant vulnerabilities continue to exist in the supply chain, despite the ongoing efforts by government and businesses to address them. Policymakers now face the immense task of fortifying supplies of everything from lithium and graphite for advanced battery chemistries to tungsten and rare earth elements for the next generation of warfighting technologies. The United States will need to strengthen both its mission clarity and its execution with a comprehensive strategy focused on domestic resource development, advanced processing and recycling technologies, international partnerships, and sustainable practices.***

***This edited volume brings together the analysis and policy recommendations of 15 experts, led by editors Dr. Gracelin Baskaran and Dr. Duncan Wood, to bolster U.S. competitiveness and leadership in these areas. It is intended to be a resource for policymakers in the new U.S. administration and Congress. The volume shows that resilient mineral chains have never been more important for U.S. security than at this critical juncture.***

# [Launch Event: Critical Minerals and the Future of the U.S. Economy | CSIS Events](https://www.csis.org/events/launch-event-critical-minerals-and-future-us-economy)

Critical mineral security is recognized as a cornerstone of national, economic, and energy security. The U.S. faces immense mineral supply chain challenges and vulnerabilities, as China weaponizes its stranglehold on mineral processing and refining to restrict and ban the export of crucial materials for advanced technologies in the energy, defense, and electronics sectors. The administration and Congress must take decisive action now to implement a comprehensive strategy for critical mineral security.  

Join the CSIS Critical Minerals Security Program for the **launch** of a new policy book, **Critical Minerals and the Future of the of the U.S. Economy**, on **February 27, 2025** from **2:00-5:00 pm ET**. This edited volume brings together the analysis and policy recommendations of 15 policy experts in the critical minerals space, led by editors Dr. Gracelin Baskaran and Dr. Duncan Wood. This event will convene policymakers, industry experts and thought leaders to discuss policy recommendations for the most pressing challenges facing minerals security. 

The event will feature keynotes from **Senator John Hickenlooper** (D-CO) and **Senator Todd Young** (R-IN), remarks from CSIS CEO **Dr. John Hamre** and CSIS Critical Minerals Security Program Director **Dr. Gracelin Baskaran.** Panel discussions with experts will focus on how the U.S. can pursue policies to build mineral production and processing capabilities, strengthen international minerals diplomacy, and enhance government coordination under the new Trump Administration to strengthen national, economic and energy security.

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — [Ukraine](https://apnews.com/hub/ukraine) has offered to strike a deal with U.S. President Donald Trump for continued [American military aid](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-military-aid-kyiv-biden-9b926a275c235c59d591a649e2450746) in exchange for developing Ukraine’s mineral industry, which could provide a valuable source of the rare earth elements that are essential for many kinds of technology.

Trump said that he [wanted such a deal](https://apnews.com/article/trump-ukraine-europe-rare-earth-russia-war-9af06a9f17dbaa49a05dcba3a3363977) earlier this month, and it was initially proposed last fall by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as part of his plan to strengthen Kyiv’s hand in future negotiations with Moscow.

“We really have this big potential in the territory which we control,” Andrii Yermak, chief of staff to the Ukrainian president, said in an exclusive interview with The Associated Press. “We are interested to work, to develop, [with our partners](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-lammy-uk-98d5d741bee9481ea4c2f49ea4f636e7), first of all, with the United States.”   (Article continues...)

Think shelves, light fixtures, coffee tables, or even just accent pieces with that raw, mech vibe.  

Honestly, I’m kinda obsessed? It looks super clean and modular, but I’ve got zero hands-on experience. Wanted to ask:  
- Anyone here actually own or build something like this? What’s the vibe—durable? Lightweight? Or does it feel too “cold” or industrial for everyday use?  
- Any downsides? I’m guessing scratches/dents on aluminum might show easier than wood?  
- If you’ve tried it, where do you even source those linear shafts? McMaster-Carr? Random hardware stores?  

Also, hot take: Is this trend just a Pinterest fad, or does it actually hold up functionally? Drop pics if you’ve got ‘em—I need to fuel my weekend project procrastination.

The company posted adjusted earnings per share of 55 cents, beating the expected 52 cents, while revenue reached $11.54 billion, exceeding the forecasted $10.68 billion. Net income rose to $2.20 billion, or 51 cents per share, compared to $1.97 billion, or 46 cents per share, a year earlier. Organic revenue climbed 14%, primarily driven by price hikes, though demand also contributed. Unlike rival PepsiCo, Coca-Cola saw an increase in unit case volume, which grew 2%, with notable strength in China, Brazil, and the U.S. This growth reversed a previous decline, signaling improved consumer demand.

Coca-Cola’s core sparkling soft drinks category grew 2%, with Coke Zero Sugar seeing an impressive 13% volume increase. The water, sports drinks, coffee, and tea segment also reported 2% growth, with gains in water and tea offsetting declines in sports drinks and coffee. However, the juice, dairy, and plant-based beverage division saw a 1% volume decline, impacted by weaker sales in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. Looking ahead to 2025, the company expects organic revenue growth of 5% to 6% and comparable earnings per share to rise 2% to 3%, though foreign currency exchange is projected to be a headwind of 6% to 7%. Despite macroeconomic challenges, Coca-Cola remains confident in its ability to sustain growth through strong demand and strategic pricing adjustments.

I'm sure there are ""help me pick a machine posts"" on almost all days that end with y.   
  
 I'm kind of struggling to find a machine that I'm confident will be at worst a side grade for my wife, and meet what I'm looking for.  It seems I can find one or the other but not both, with one exception ""Nespresso-Vertuo-Lattissima-DeLonghi"" seems like it might but requires an app. That's pretty much a non starter with my spouse, and something I like as a convenience but hate as a requirement.  Even if I think I've found something amazon reviews put in in doubt (Found one review asserting CitiZ DOES allow the reusable pods and one that it DOES NOT).   While my wife is willing to accept a slight downgrade (just so no one gets the idea she's unwilling to compromise) I'm unwilling to mess up a routine that is clearly working for her so I'm not going to get anything that messes up her morning routine. 

My wife currently uses a little K-Cup machine with reusable pods, and primarily just goes for a mug of straight coffee. 

I have a coffee shop habit and am on an insanely low carb diet, I go for Breve Cappuccinos, and that's about it.  (Though i drift back to lattes when I'm on a diet break). 

SO I'm looking for a coffee machine that makes those two drinks as simply and easily as possible, with the next most important feature being easy to clean, and the third most important being a reasonable size profile.  Once all those are checked off I'll worry about other features and price.

Thank you for any help cutting through the noise.

That came later though.

To me, I struggle with a split. I was raised as a boy by my alt mother, and that was very different from most families, which I didn't find out until later. Our family was matriarchal, and while I hated that at the time and never in a million years would have ever believed anyone if they told me men like trump existed, after being returned to my biological parents from my mother (the person I call my mother isn't, or wasn't at first biologically related to me, caveat for bone marrow transplant and experiments she did) I was over sheltered and only let out much later.

So that was a rude awakening for me and I had to learn very fast why the world was much the opposite of what I had grown up around, but essentially I forgive my mother and even thing because of my sex her and my older sister had every right to treat me the way they did and that while other families with women in charge would probably be less abusive, women should be the leaders to where even a daughter of 5 has more power than the father of 50 60 70 or for all I care 1000, purely because, yeah, the female sex is superior to the male one, which is designed to follow, not lead, and shouldn't have any say in things which concern the mind or it's use or the heart and it's relations, purely physical - only women sexed people should have any right to learn or use their mind or feelings, express them, etc, and have every right to be in situations of physical expertise but no obligation like men and boys should.

I struggled with it for a long time, but if the world can't just be peaceful for everyone, then I would rather the tyrants be female than male, or the sexes swapped like it was with my family, because even after being raped and beaten up growing up by my mother and sister, after seeing Trump and ""macho"" men like him, from business clean-cut suits and ties to tech-chad wannabes to construction workers and military people, all of those men make my stomach churn and wanna throw up even now, thinking about it (might be no breakfast and just coffee and adderall since I just got up and had no sleep, plus the heater here in my new place in MKE is an old one that I don't know how to work, so it's cold) but it doesn't make me with women like that.

For me, it's also not the place of anyone with male parts to act tough and mighty, even before my mother raised me, I was shy and reserved from the start - while other kids were playing with toy dolls and houses and cars, I was the one by the windowsill with plants and books looking outside and having all the existential questions. I think she liked my wonder and could wonder through me and also teach, and liked that I wasn't like the others. Even out of the womb I was said to be difficult by my bio mom, took me 4 days and nights to be born and they had to take me out, and I was resistant, but I was also quiet, and was said to have an age to my eyes that she told me the nurse had never seen before.

Anyway, in my family my mother wanted boys to be shy and meek and quiet, but to what they were told, rough it and go without while serving. She blew all kinds of money on Claire, clothes and stuff she wouldn't even use, but I had to wash and food I always cooked but was left only with leftovers and whatever came out the other end, which was mean, so I starved and had no clothes of my own, which weren't even allowed in the home, for me to wear anything, and when we did go out, I wasn't allowed shoes or socks, always barefoot, including when told to kill bugs I was afraid of but they weren't even bothered by.

Anyway, the point is that the physical toughness should be just physical not an attitude, which should be a submitting one. 

Anyway...

With going she/her, that's new territory and I don't know how to handle that, but with how I was raised that's a template that's easy to go by and safe, so is it weak and selfish to want that?

Back in late 2015 i connected with this beautiful Finnish girl on Facebook , she was a single mother of two beautiful daughters.
Eventually we fell for eachother and decided to meet in August of 2016, she helped me with most of the travel expenditure (:my low paying job), but due to political tensions in my country all flights were grounded and a oppressive ban on telecommunication (No calls ,No Internet, No TV/Radio). After 3 months i finally decided to leave the country and hitchhiked out of the borders , our bond grew stronger over the period and we finally met in January 2017, she insisted me to get a masters degree for my own good because my bachelors didn't get me through my own expenses, eventually i got into one, around this time i did a lot of odd jobs to pay for my Uni and bills and graduated by the end of 2019, i couldn't give her the time and attention she needed, 2019 was harsh on us ,we both tried our best, she was tired, she needed stability, and that's not wrong to demand considering she was there for me all this time, supporting me financially wherever she could, providing good life to the babies.
The idea of letting go wasn't mutual i became toxic , was calling & texting her from different numbers after getting blocked , tried showing up in person in 2021 it was all gone. I did work from home for a while then i landed some good paying jobs, went back to my country in 2023 and got a chance to set-up a coffee shop which turned out good , named it after the youngest daughter. Around this time she met a good looking guy who's also technically her age and after a lot of stalking i found them both happy, happier than she ever was with me and living their best life , i want the best for them all 🤍

Yesterday,10th of February, there was a nice snowstorm overnight which rendered our coffee shop without electricity and the backup dying. I Fueled up the generators and the coffee shop became an absolute hotspot for tourists to warm up and charge their devices.
It was so random so unexpected , as i was entering the shop after clearing the pathway, there i see her standing , absolute beauty, they were all there only because of the shops name. I didn't get to talk a lot but she said it was their first surprise trip together and she couldn't say no to the guy and she least expected me to be there.

In November, a guy hit on me and asked me out on a date. He seemed nice, so I said yes, and we went out together. We clicked pretty well and both agreed that we should go on more dates. We liked the same things, we only had positive things to say about each other. So we met again, and on our second date, we talked about wanting something serious and getting to know each other better.

Now, in February, another woman mistook him for someone else and started talking to him. She quickly realized her mistake, but he still suggested going for a walk with the dog or grabbing a coffee together. She asked what he was looking for, and he said something serious. And that he wanted to get married.

Of course, he has every right to date another woman. I’m on Tinder myself and talking to other people, so that’s not the problem.

But! That same day, I asked if he might want to go to a hockey game with me. He then said he wasn’t really ready to date right now. He was okay with meeting up for something sexual but understood if that wasn’t what I wanted.

He said that things could absolutely develop into something more, like a relationship, and that he likes me and thinks I’m a great woman.

When I asked why he suddenly wasn’t ready for something serious—since he had previously given that impression—his explanation was:
	•	That he didn’t feel mentally ready.
	•	That he couldn’t give enough of himself.
	•	That his mother is sick, which exhausts him, and things are very up and down for him.

Why would he say one thing to me, whom he has known since November, and something completely different to a woman he chatted with for two minutes?

My productive time in a day was maybe 4 hours. The rest of it i can't even tell you what I was doing. 

I got my job which is pretty demanding. I work 9 hours a day with a 2 hour commute. I get home pretty tired but surprisingly, I have been doing a lot when I get home too. I've been working on my side business, as well as writing articles for journals. I am surprised by my focus and work ethic since. It has only been 2 weeks, but I hope this continues. I do feel a bit sleep deprived but that is also because I've been drinking more coffee (i wake up at 4.45 am) and have trouble falling asleep.

I’ve been going through some of life’s dramas and been feeling quite down in the dumps lately which is why I’m looking for someone I could game and chat with. I mainly play on PS5 and own a Switch. I don’t play too many things but games I enjoy are:

•Monster Hunter World (I’m hyped for Wilds!)
•Monster Hunter Rise & GU (Switch)
•Baldur’s Gate 3
•Elden Ring
•Ark Survival Ascended
•Nioh 2
•Palworld
•Borderlands 3
•Terraria
•Pokémon
•Super Smash Bros Ult
•Path of Exile 2 (still new)
And some more.

Some facts about me would include being a 5’2 shorty, love gaming (obviously), loves coffee, likes all things fantasy, scifi, horror, love to cook and hate spiders! There’s probably a lot more. 😂 I’m quite timid and bit of an introvert so I apologise if I do not jump on mic very fast until I’ve gotten to know you bit more.

Hey there!  

I’m a 25-year-old from India, currently living in Italy—because apparently, I thought surviving on pasta and coffee alone was a solid life plan (no regrets so far). Living abroad has been a great journey of self-discovery, mostly realizing how much I miss home-cooked food and how bad I am at folding fitted sheets.  

A bit about me—I’m into sports, movies, and TV shows, and I have a ""slightly"" obsessive love for Formula 1. If you also enjoy high-speed drama and questionable Ferrari strategies, we’ll probably get along great. If not, don’t worry—I promise I can talk about other things too. Like how pineapple on pizza is an unresolved international debate.  

But honestly, I think good connections are built on more than just shared interests. I value meaningful conversations, mutual respect, and the kind of banter that makes you laugh at your phone like an idiot in public. Quality time is super important to me—whether it’s sharing a meal, exploring new places, or just having a deep conversation about life (or which fictional character had the worst plot arc).  

Speaking of food, I love cooking. I wouldn’t call myself a *chef*, but I can definitely make something edible, and I promise to only slightly judge your taste in food. If you think cereal counts as a meal, I won’t argue. Probably.  

So if you’re up for a chat—whether it’s about life, movies, or just debating whether naps should be considered a sport—drop a message! Looking forward to meeting someone who’s down for good convos and maybe some friendly roasting along the way.
