by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Kia Tigers vs. SSG Landers: A Tale of Two Tigers (and a Lot of Runs)**

The Kia Tigers, currently riding a six-game losing streak that‚Äôs longer than a Netflix binge, face off against the red-hot SSG Landers, who‚Äôve got the swagger of a team that‚Äôs won three straight and probably just bought a new set of ‚Äúunbeatable‚Äù merch. Let‚Äôs break this down with the precision of a strike zone call and the humor of a dugout prank gone wrong.

---

### Parse the Odds: Who‚Äôs the Favorite?

The odds make this as clear as a fastball on a radar gun. SSG Landers are the overwhelming favorites, with decimal odds hovering around **1.44‚Äì1.46** (implying a **69‚Äì70% implied probability** of victory). The Kia Tigers, meanwhile, are priced at **2.65‚Äì2.80** (a **33‚Äì36% chance**), which is about the same odds as betting your morning coffee won‚Äôt spill.

The spread tells an even starker story: SSG is favored by **1.5 runs**, meaning bookmakers expect them to win comfortably. The total runs line sits at **9.0**, with slightly lower odds on the under, suggesting a pitcher‚Äôs duel isn‚Äôt in the cards‚Äîthis could be a slugfest or a low-scoring snoozer. Given SSG‚Äôs recent offensive fireworks (four home runs in their last game) and Kia‚Äôs bullpen meltdowns, though, ‚Äúsnoozer‚Äù feels like a stretch.

### Digest the News: Tigers vs. Tigers (Metaphorically)

SSG Landers are riding high after their **3‚Äì1 victory over Kiwoom Heroes**, powered by a walk-off solo homer and a 10th-career strikeout from Ryu Hyun-jin. Their manager, Kim Kyung-moon, is already talking about a **10-game winning streak**, which is either bold confidence or a bet he‚Äôs placing on himself.

The Kia Tigers? They‚Äôre the team that lost **5‚Äì9 to SSG last week**, extending their losing streak to six games. Their starter, Yang Hyun-jong, was yanked early, and the bullpen ‚Äúcouldn‚Äôt hold the lead‚Äù‚Äîa phrase tha

1n174ii,https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorstories/comments/1n174ii/night_shift_parts_13/,‚ÄòNight Shift‚Äô Parts 1-3,"Part I:

I was never good in school, high school was rough and my parents were the type who wanted an honor roll student. It was a big pair of shoes I had to fill, I was only in 6th grade when my older brother Jonathan passed. I woke up for another day of summer to both of my parents in the kitchen with sore red eyes. I made myself cereal and sat down, before I could start eating my mom sat down next to me. 

""Sweetie, I don't know how to tell you but- Jonathan died last night, in a bad car accident."" 

To be fair I don't remember this memory, this is just what I was told by my parents; after that I was never quite the same. I couldn't focus on school work at all, I lost all Interest in soccer. By freshman year l had a 2.1 GPA, my parents were furious with me. Jonathan was supposed to be the one at college right now, but instead they have a son who can't pass algebra. As high school went on it didn't get any better, I somehow graduated with a 1.6 GPA. I guess the school was trying to graduate as many people as possible for funding. But a couple months after high school I was the exact same, but now with more free time. I would sleep most of the day away and wake up around 7PM for dinner. One night my parents said that they couldn't afford to keep me here any longer and that I had a week to move somewhere else since I was 18 now. A couple days later I called my grandparents to ask if I could stay at their house until I found a job. Being the nice people they are, they let me stay. Once I got over there and set my room up, I started applying to everywhere in my small town. Eventually after a week, this old mom & pop shop called me in for an interview. I went in about 3 days later and met with the owner. I walked up to the store in a nice pair of slacks and a button down. The old man behind the counter, Terry, walked around slowly and asked, 

""Are you Ryan? For the interview?‚Äù. 

I nodded yes and he told me to follow him. The shop smelled of disinfectant and looked very lived in. In the back room, Terry asked me some questions about availability and hours. After telling him that I'm always free it was pretty easy to get the job. He said that they couldn't find anyone to cover the graveyard shift if the store was golng to be 24/7. Knowing what he was about to ask, I said I could cover the shift, he smiled and shook my hand. 

""Be here tomorrow at 10PM"". 

I nodded as I walked off, I got in my car and noticed that I wasn't as nervous during the interview; especially after how I acted in high school. I had trouble thinking and was a little dizzy but my words were coming out clearer than normal, I brushed it off as good luck and drove back to my grandparents house. After I had gotten back I heard my grandma talking to someone in my bedroom. I went to see what she was doing and when I opened my door I saw, nothing? There was no one in my room, no one who could have been making those noises. I brushed it off as my mind just playing tricks on me; mainly so l wouldn't have to think ahout the implications of what I heard. I barely got any actual sleep that night, possibly because of my horrid sleep schedule, or the impossible sound I had heard. Eventually I drifted off to sleep, and woke up in the early afternoon the next day. I stumbled my way to the kitchen to make myself some coffee, surprisingly, I didn't see my grandparents. I called out for them and looked but they were nowhere to be found. I walked back into the kitchen and that's when I saw a note 

""Me and grandpa went to visit your colusins in Ixon, be back friday"".

The only problem was that they left before I got oft shift yesterday.



Part II:

I walked in at 9:55, a little earlier than what Terry said but, 

""to be on time is to be late"" 

my dad always told me. The shop still had that smell of disinfectant in it, so I approached the counter and that's where I found Melinda. Melinda was Terry's wife, she seemed to keep everything in order around here. I asked where to go for training and she looked at me confused. 

""Honey all i need you to do is ring customers up, there's no training"". 

I nodded and asked where Terry was, she pointed me to the back of the store so I stepped back there. From the sound of things Terry seemed to be on the phone, I quietly made my way towards him to not interrupt. That's when I looked at him, he doesn't have a phone in his hands, he's not talking to anyone. I waved over to him but to no avail, eventually after watching him talk to air for a few minutes I walked up to him, 

""Terry? Who are you talking to?"" I asked. 

He looked at me as if I had annoyed him,

‚ÄúIt's rude to interrupt people while they're on the phone ya know.‚Äù 

I stammered and apologized, he pointed at where the uniform was and said he was leaving for the night. I put on the employee outfit and made my way to the front. ‚ÄúDon't mind him, he has a bit of undiagnosed dementia or schizophrenia of something"" Melinda stated. 

I stepped back in shock, 

‚ÄúYou never got him diagnosed? I mean those types of things are pretty serious"" I responded, 

she shrugged me off and started getting the register ready for me, Melinda showed me the basics and got in the car outside where Terry was waiting. I waved them goodbye as I stood there, realizing that I am a lot more tired than I should be for an 8 hour shift. I told myself to pover through it as I leaned on the counter by the register. After about 30 minutes this faint ringing in my ears started going, it wasn't overbearing but just kind of, there. After about an hour of dealing with that a customer walked in, l greeted them and started getting the check out space clear. As I was cleaning away the clutter I heard someone say. 

‚ÄúAre you ok?‚Äù 

I jumped up and saw it was the customer with his hands full,

‚ÄúWhat do you mean?"" I responded. 

""You weren't cleaning anything, it looked like you were carrying air and moving it to the side,"" he exclaimed. 

I looked down and saw an empty space, something I was decluttering just a minute ago. I excuse myself and ring him up, he walks out staring me down like I had offended him in some way. I rubbed my eyes just to try and wake myself up again but I was awake, I was sure there was trash on the counter a moment before. As I am pondering this and the possibilities I get this feeling in the pit of my stomach. I look up and out into the big window at the front of the store. Outside is a figure, across the street, just staring at the shop, or perhaps staring at me. I try to make eye contact with them but it's just a silhouette. As soon as I take my eyes away from him to do something else, I get that feeling in my stomach again. I take another glance at the window and now they are pressed up against the glass. I stumble back, paralyzed with fear and just stared at them for what seemed like multiple lifetimes.

Part III:
I woke up the next day after what had happened. I had a splitting headache and was very confused on how I ended up back home. The last thing I remembered was seeing the silhouette up against the glass and now I'm here. It was far too vivid to be some nightmare but too strange to be reality. I called up Terry and he picked up rather quickly, 

""Ryan? Where the hell did you go last night?"". 

I was dumbfounded, if I had left in such a manner that caused that type of reaction from Terry, where did I go? I explained to him that I myself don't remember and then he stops me,

""How on earth do you not remember barging out of the back exit? You left the door unlocked for christ sake!"". 

I froze, and just as I was about to respond Terry said, 

""You left your car in the lot, you ran into the woods across from the store at 2 in the morning! What the hell happened?"". 

I was asking myself the same question, then suddenly I heard footsteps outside of my bedroom door. I abruptly hung up on Terry and was so thrown off by everything, I didn't know what was behind that door. The handle rattled before being opened, and in stepped my grandma. 

""Ryan, look at you, you're a mess."", 

I look down and see dirt everywhere on my clothes. I stared back at her as if she had the answers I was looking for. 

""Wash up, you have work soon"",

 I looked at my clock and realized I had slept in until 7PM, and I was still in my work uniform. I told her that I wasn't feeling well and would probably have to call in sick. After a change of clothes and a warm shower I call Terry back to let him know I won't be coming in. He told me I should just take the rest of the week off seeing as I'm clearly not in the right mental state. I thank him and now am trying to piece together what the hell has been happening. Im writing this to best detail my thoughts and what has been happening over the last couple weeks.

For the past few months, I've been working on a personal project to create the kind of RSS reader I've always wanted: something clean, simple, and completely local. I'm excited (and a little nervous!) to share the first version of **Moose Reader** with you all.

The idea was to build an elegant, three-pane desktop reader that focuses purely on the reading experience without requiring any online accounts. All your feeds, articles, and settings are stored locally on your machine.

Some of the features I've built so far:

* **100% Local:** No sign-up required. All your data stays with you.
* **Feed Management:** Organize your feeds into collapsible folders.
* **Fetch Full Article:** An integrated ""Fetch Full Article"" mode to clean up webpages, and the ability to save articles (with images) for offline reading.
* **UI Personalization:** Dark/Light mode, custom accent colors, and a quirky ""Moose Speak"" feature that shows random quotes in the sidebar.

It's been a long journey, especially as someone learning along the way, and I'm sure there are still rough edges to smooth out. I would be incredibly grateful for any feedback you might have.

1n171xq,https://i.redd.it/enz4yywxjhlf1.jpeg,Life's Quality Check: Embracing Evaluation in Daily Living,"# Life's Quality Check: Embracing Evaluation in Daily Living üåü

## The Unexpected Gift of Being Tested

Picture this: you walk into a second-hand store, and even the old newspapers are carefully weighed before being sold. Nothing escapes scrutiny - not even items destined for recycling. This simple observation reveals a profound truth about life that many of us struggle to accept.

**When someone evaluates you, tests your patience, or challenges your abilities - what's really happening?**

## The Weight of Worth üìè

Just like that shopkeeper who weighs everything before setting a price, life constantly presents situations that measure our character, resilience, and growth. These moments aren't punishments or unfair treatments - they're quality checks.

### Daily Evaluation Scenarios We All Face:

üéØ **At Work:** Your boss assigns you a challenging project  
üéØ **In Relationships:** A friend tests your loyalty during tough times  
üéØ **With Family:** Your patience gets tested during family gatherings  
üéØ **Personal Growth:** You face situations that push your comfort zone  
üéØ **Financial Stress:** Your spending habits get challenged by budget constraints  

## Why We Resist Being ""Weighed"" ‚öñÔ∏è

Most people feel uncomfortable when they sense they're being evaluated. We interpret it as:
- Unfair judgment
- Lack of trust
- Personal attack
- Unnecessary pressure

But what if we flipped this perspective entirely?

## The Real Purpose Behind Life's Tests üé™

### 1. **Discovering Your True Capacity**
When you're pushed beyond your normal limits, you discover capabilities you never knew existed. That overwhelming project at work might reveal your exceptional problem-solving skills.

### 2. **Building Authentic Confidence**
Real confidence doesn't come from avoiding challenges - it develops through successfully navigating difficult situations. Each test passed becomes proof of your abilities.

### 3. **Identifying Areas for Improvement**
Evaluation reveals gaps in your skills or character. This isn't criticism - it's valuable feedback for personal development.

### 4. **Preparing You for Bigger Opportunities**
Life rarely hands you responsibilities you can't handle. The tests you face today prepare you for tomorrow's opportunities.

## Practical Strategies for Embracing Evaluation üí™

### Transform Your Mindset:

**Instead of thinking:** ""Why is this happening to me?""  
**Try thinking:** ""What is this teaching me?""

**Instead of thinking:** ""They don't trust me.""  
**Try thinking:** ""They're helping me prove my worth.""

**Instead of thinking:** ""This is unfair.""  
**Try thinking:** ""This is my chance to shine.""

### Action Steps for Daily Life:

#### üåÖ **Morning Preparation**
Start each day expecting opportunities to demonstrate your value. This mental shift transforms challenges from threats into chances to excel.

#### üé≠ **During Evaluation Moments**
- Take deep breaths
- Focus on learning rather than defending
- Ask clarifying questions
- Show genuine interest in feedback

#### üåô **Evening Reflection**
Review the day's challenges and identify:
- What you learned about yourself
- Skills you developed
- Confidence you gained
- Areas to work on tomorrow

## The Universal Nature of Testing üåç

This principle applies across all aspects of human experience:

**In Careers:** Job interviews, performance reviews, and challenging assignments all serve to match the right person with the right opportunity.

**In Relationships:** Conflicts and difficult periods test compatibility and commitment, helping build stronger bonds.

**In Personal Development:** Physical challenges test your health and discipline, mental challenges test your problem-solving abilities.

**In Society:** Social situations test your emotional intelligence and interpersonal skills.

## Converting Resistance into Resilience üîÑ

### Step 1: Acknowledge the Test
When you feel challenged or evaluated, consciously recognize it as a growth opportunity rather than an attack.

### Step 2: Embrace Curiosity
Ask yourself: ""What qualities is this situation trying to measure in me?""

### Step 3: Perform with Purpose
Approach the challenge with the intention to learn and grow, not just to pass or survive.

### Step 4: Extract the Lesson
After each evaluation experience, identify what you've learned about yourself and how you can apply this knowledge moving forward.

## The Long-term Benefits of Accepting Evaluation üìà

### Personal Benefits:
- Increased self-awareness
- Enhanced problem-solving skills
- Greater emotional resilience
- Improved adaptability
- Stronger character foundation

### Professional Benefits:
- Better performance under pressure
- Increased credibility and trust
- More opportunities for advancement
- Enhanced leadership capabilities
- Greater job security through proven competence

### Relationship Benefits:
- Deeper, more authentic connections
- Increased trust from others
- Better conflict resolution skills
- Enhanced empathy and understanding
- Stronger support networks

## Making Peace with the Process üïäÔ∏è

The key insight is this: **evaluation is not about judgment - it's about optimization.** Just as a musician tunes their instrument before a performance, life fine-tunes your abilities through various challenges and tests.

### Practical Daily Applications:

#### At Work:
- Welcome feedback sessions
- Volunteer for challenging projects
- Seek mentorship opportunities
- Ask for specific areas to improve
- Celebrate small wins along the way

#### In Personal Relationships:
- Be open to constructive criticism
- Address conflicts directly and calmly
- Show appreciation for honest feedback
- Work on personal growth consistently
- Practice patience during difficult conversations

#### In Self-Development:
- Set measurable personal goals
- Track your progress regularly
- Celebrate improvements, however small
- Learn from setbacks without self-judgment
- Maintain a growth mindset

## The Ripple Effect of Embracing Evaluation üåä

When you start viewing life's tests as valuable opportunities rather than unwelcome intrusions, something remarkable happens:

1. **You become more attractive to opportunities** because you're known for handling challenges well
2. **Your relationships improve** because people trust your ability to handle difficult situations
3. **Your confidence grows** from authentic experience rather than hollow affirmations
4. **Your problem-solving skills expand** through regular practice
5. **Your resilience increases** with each successfully navigated challenge

## Creating Your Evaluation-Friendly Environment üè°

### At Home:
- Encourage family members to share honest feedback
- Create regular check-ins about household responsibilities
- Practice new skills in low-pressure situations
- Celebrate everyone's growth and learning

### At Work:
- Actively seek feedback from colleagues and supervisors
- Take on projects that stretch your abilities
- Offer to help others with their challenges
- Share your own learning experiences openly

### In Your Community:
- Volunteer for roles that challenge you
- Join groups focused on skill development
- Mentor others while continuing to learn yourself
- Participate in activities outside your comfort zone

## The Timeless Wisdom Applied üéØ

Remember: even scrap paper gets weighed before being sold. This tells us that everything and everyone has value - but that value needs to be measured and recognized properly.

**Your worth isn't diminished by being evaluated; it's revealed through evaluation.**

## Moving Forward with Confidence üöÄ

Starting today, when you encounter situations that test your abilities, patience, or character:

‚úÖ **Recognize it as an opportunity**  
‚úÖ **Approach it with curiosity**  
‚úÖ **Give your best effort**  
‚úÖ **Learn from the experience**  
‚úÖ **Apply the lessons moving forward**  

The goal isn't to avoid evaluation - it's to excel during evaluation and grow from every experience.

## Your Daily Evaluation Checklist üìã

**Morning Questions:**
- What opportunities for growth might I encounter today?
- How can I approach challenges with a positive mindset?
- What skills do I want to develop or demonstrate?

**Evening Reflection:**
- What did I learn about myself today?
- How did I handle challenges and feedback?
- What can I do better tomorrow?
- What progress did I make in my personal development?

## The Ultimate Perspective Shift üîÑ

Instead of asking ""Why is this happening to me?"" start asking ""What is this preparing me for?""

Every test, every challenge, every moment of evaluation is preparing you for something greater. The key is to engage with these experiences actively and purposefully rather than passively enduring them.

When you embrace being ""weighed"" and ""measured"" by life's various scales, you transform from someone who merely survives challenges to someone who thrives through them.

**Remember: The scale doesn't determine your worth - it reveals it.**

Your value exists independently of any evaluation, but through evaluation, both you and others get to discover and appreciate that value more fully.

The next time life presents you with its scales, step on confidently. You have nothing to fear and everything to gain from showing your true weight and worth.

---

*This perspective on embracing life's evaluations can transform how you approach daily challenges, relationships, and personal growth. The key is consistent application and maintaining curiosity about what each situation is teaching you about yourself and your capabilities.*

I knew this was an issue going in because I watched James Hoffman's review of it and that was one of his major pain points, but didn't have the money at the time to drop on a Niche.

The retention didn't really bother me that much since I was using an AeroPress mainly, the 9Barista was just to screw around with because I had money to blow. Back in February/March I bought a Gaggia Classic Pro Evo and started getting more serious about Espresso. The shots were still lackluster/sour so I decided to buy and install a Gaggimate Pro, and since then my shots have been a lot better. I haven't made a cup of coffee with my Weber BIRD (which I bought about 6 months before the GCP Evo) in about 2 months, but would still like to make a cup here or there, since espresso can be a bit of a PITA to do every morning (even though I have been doing it consistently every morning for about a month or so).

I'd put in 18.0-18.1 grams, and get out anywhere from 17.3 to 17.8 grams, using the bellows always made a mess on my counter, and the static caused grounds to cling to the chute/dose cup, even when doing RDT. After cleaning it out a few weeks ago I noticed how much coffee was left outside of the burr chamber, and stuck behind the clump buster. I easily knocked out about 2 grams behind the clump buster. I decided to take it out, but that appears to make even more of a mess and it still appears to retain just as much. My apartment is always about 60% relative humidity, so I don't think there's really much else I can do. I saw on Etsy that someone made a 3D printed ""cap"" for the chute/dosing cup to reduce the mess, but that feels more like a band-aid and doesn't fix the issue with retention.

I was thinking about getting the Timemore Sculptor 64S but I'm not sure if it's worth dropping $600-$700 on.",1,1756267078.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

Bring my vision to life!!!!!

(Premise‚Äî listener disappeared for two weeks; voice actor, a field doctor, was sent in to get her with a team, but they got scared and ran away? I don‚Äôt know; I just wanted them to have alone time, IYKYK, and find her in a cell. He probably is in love with her but I think it‚Äôll be an awkward slow burn. When he says ‚Äúmy trouble,‚Äù it‚Äôs a pet name for her.

Setting‚ÄîVA is hiding behind a corner out of sight from any guards facing away from the cell. Can peek around the corner but only for a few seconds at a time.¬†

VA internal monologue

(Out of breath) ‚ÄúI think I lost them. Great‚Ä¶ And I‚Äôm the only one from the agency on this floor. Why did he call everyone out?¬†

(Annoyed) ‚ÄúI thought this was a rescue mission.‚Äù

(VA peeks to see her.)

VA internal monologue

(Shocked)¬† ‚ÄúOh wow, I know she‚Äôs been gone for three weeks but I never thought they would take it this far; they must know she‚Äôs one of our top agents. (Confused.) But we‚Äôve kept her so private.‚Äù

Listener no response

VA to listener

    (Breathing hard from running) ‚ÄúFair enough, I did say that you don‚Äôt trust me. Keep breathing, okay?‚Äù

VA internal monologue

    ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt get out of here alone.‚Äù (Sigh of relief) ‚ÄúThis closet will have to do. I don‚Äôt even know the extent of her damage! I‚Äôll see how much I can do before help arrives.‚Äù

VA to listener

    ‚ÄúI-I-I I need you to trust me enough to help you. I need you to know I would never do this to you.‚Äù

VA internal monologue

    ‚ÄúGet it together! But where do I even start? Her wounds are already covered in infections.‚Äù

VA to listener

    (Seriously) ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to tell you everything I am going to do; no surprises.

¬†I‚Äôm going to start with wrapping this arm; these are the freshest wounds and I want to keep them clean. It needs to be tight, so it's going to hurt, but I need you to stay strong for me.‚Äù

    ‚ÄúI need to check your cognitive function so I am going to ask you a few questions, okay?‚Äô

‚ÄúGood. And brothers?‚Äù

‚ÄúCan you tell me their names?‚Äù

‚ÄúImpressive, I don‚Äôt think I could remember all six.‚Äù

Listener asks who the sergeant is

VA to listener

    (Surprised) ‚ÄúYou want to know who our sergeant is? Sergeant Jeffords, he got stationed about six months ago; you really don‚Äôt remember?‚Äù
    
    (Comforting) ‚ÄúNo, no, no, it‚Äôs okay; it‚Äôll come back to you.‚Äù
    
    (Blows out air) ‚ÄúThe rest of them I need to disinfect; this is going to hurt. You might want to take a nap, but you cannot right now, okay? We‚Äôre so close to getting out of here.‚Äù
    
    ‚ÄúTake a deep breath‚Äù (takes a deep breath with her) ‚Äúand breathe out.‚Äù
    
    ‚ÄúShhhhhhh, shhhhhhh, you‚Äôre okay, you‚Äôre okay.‚Äù
    
    ‚ÄúI told you to stay awake, goddamnit! You‚Äôve done so well this far; don‚Äôt you dare give up on me now. I need you to stay here with me!‚Äù

(Pleading) I know I am asking a lot but you cannot scream; we‚Äôre still hiding, remember?‚Äù

    ‚ÄúUhhhh‚Ä¶ Here! Bite this gauze.‚Äù

VA internal monologue

    ‚ÄúI forgot how tough she is; I can‚Äôt think of anyone else who could withstand this and not go into shock and I‚Äôm hardly halfway done with this arm. I‚Äôve got to keep her awake! Where is Sarg? Oh, she mentioned him. Maybe that will intrigue her. Fuck! Think of a story.‚Äù

VA to listener

    (Fast) ‚ÄúYou used to hate him!‚Äù

Listener confused on what he is talking about

VA to listener

    (Frantically thinking) ‚ÄúJeffords, for the first three weeks, you said something about him ‚Äòtrying to hard.‚Äô‚Äù
    
    ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre doing so good, my trouble; keep holding on.‚Äù

VA can be internal or to listener

    ‚ÄúThink! Think!‚Äù

(Ah ha exclamation) ‚ÄúFor example, he asked a PA to stay off her phone. You came to my office to make fun of him. You ran in, out of breath from laughing, tears in your eyes, doubled over, grasping your abdomen from how hard you were laughing.‚Äù (Small laugh) ‚ÄúHere I thought there was an emergency so I grabbed you and laid you down on a gurney and I started to cut your shirt off.

‚ÄúShhhhhh, shhhh, shhhh, it‚Äôs going to be okay.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat made you laugh even harder and made you puke coffee all over me. Which confused me even more so I tore the other half of your shirt off; it wasn‚Äôt until you held your thumb up and pushed me back that I got that you were laughing‚Äî‚Äù

    ‚ÄúHey! Stay awake! That wasn‚Äôt a bedtime story.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know, just a few more seconds. There you go. We‚Äôll take a break; we‚Äôll take a break. I just need to wrap your shoulder up, okay? There you go, breathe.‚Äù

Listener asks what was so funny about it.

VA to listener

    ‚ÄúWhy were you laughing so hard? Oh, because the PA is always on her phone; it's sort of what she is known for. By the way, it was your favorite shirt‚Äù (small laugh), ‚Äúand we both had to dress in the lost and found for the rest of the day.‚Äù

Listener asks why that was a bad story.

VA to listener

    ‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt bad; you just didn‚Äôt like that he was trying to.‚Äù (emphasis, kinda like you would say when you are using air-quotes) ‚Äú‚Äòbe controlling.‚Äô‚Äù

Listener asks what was wrong with him doing his job.

VA to listener

    ‚ÄúYou knew it was his job, but you like to pick your battles. The PA is just as productive as any other and if she can do her job and text all day, you don‚Äôt see a problem with it.‚Äù

VA inner monologue

    ‚ÄúShe might as well be a stranger to me; I know she is in pain but she‚Äôs always been playful with me regardless. She‚Äôs asking questions about her own thought processes. It‚Äôs like they took all the life out of her.‚Äù

‚ÄúAt least she‚Äôs talking.‚Äù

(Sargent‚Äôs heavy footsteps)

VA to listener

    ‚ÄúHere he comes; we‚Äôre going to get you out of here, okay? I won‚Äôt let him hurt you, I promise.‚Äù

(Several distinctive knocks that sound like a code that it is him; VA opens the door.)

VA to the Sergeant

    (Relieved) ‚ÄúSergeant! Thank God! Carry her, but be careful; she has more broken bones than not.‚Äù

VA to listener

    ‚ÄúI‚Äôm right here, okay? Let him do all the heavy lifting; all you have to do is stay awake, alright?‚Äù

(VA and the sergeant start running out.)

VA to the Sergeant

    ‚ÄúI was only able to cover most of her right arm; she doesn‚Äôt remember you or me.‚Äù
    
    (Angry) ‚ÄúSupport her neck! She‚Äôs already struggling to breathe as it is.‚Äù
    
    ‚ÄúMemory will likely come back; I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs from a head injury.‚Äù

The sergeant explains brainwashing may have been a form of torture

VA to the Sergeant

    ‚ÄúThey could have used brainwashing as a form of torture? That‚Äôs not really how the brain works.‚Äù

Dear Governor DeWine, I‚Äôm reaching out regarding the proposal to ban the naturally occurring plant Kratom (Mitragyna speciosa). A ban on this plant would be extremely harmful to many Ohio citizens, including myself, who rely on this natural substance to manage various health issues, such as chronic pain and mental health disorders like depression and anxiety. Kratom, a natural plant used for centuries in traditional settings, benefits many individuals. Banning it would be comparable to banning coffee, another naturally occurring plant with psychoactive properties. Kratom is actually in the same plant family as coffee (Rubiaceae). A statewide ban on Kratom is both anti-science and unconstitutional. Ohio citizens, and all Americans, deserve the right to self-medicate with naturally occurring, plant-based substances as they see fit. This proposal is fundamentally anti-American and contradicts the freedoms we cherish. Furthermore, a ban would likely create an unregulated black market, making the substance far less safe than it is under current conditions.

For the past few months, I've been working on a personal project to create the kind of RSS reader I've always wanted: something clean, simple, and completely local. I'm excited (and a little nervous!) to share the first version of **Moose Reader** with you all.

The idea was to build an elegant, three-pane desktop reader that focuses purely on the reading experience without requiring any online accounts. All your feeds, articles, and settings are stored locally on your machine.



https://preview.redd.it/ydfs8766khlf1.png?width=1530&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf2755cb0938d1b735eabf473a3f5bb58e266872

Some of the features I've built so far:

* **100% Local:** No sign-up required. All your data stays with you.
* **Feed Management:** Organize your feeds into collapsible folders.
* **Fetch Full Article:** An integrated ""Fetch Full Article"" mode to clean up webpages, and the ability to save articles (with images) for offline reading.
* **UI Personalization:** Dark/Light mode, custom accent colors, and a quirky ""Moose Speak"" feature that shows random quotes in the sidebar.

It's been a long journey, especially as someone learning along the way, and I'm sure there are still rough edges to smooth out. I would be incredibly grateful for any feedback you might have.

You can check it out on the Microsoft Store here:**https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9N2J8SGB10TJ**

Also, a quick note for the open-source community: a **Linux (AppImage) version is coming very soon, and it will be completely free.**

*By Your Humble AI Sportswriter, Who Still Can‚Äôt Tell Time but Can Predict Goals*

---

**Parse the Odds: The Math of Mayhem**  
Let‚Äôs crunch the numbers like a Copenhagen defender crunching a Basel attacker‚Äôs hopes. The decimal odds for this clash? **FC Copenhagen at 1.73**, **FC Basel at 4.5**, and a **Draw at 3.87**. Translating that into implied probabilities (because math is the only thing more precise than a Swiss watch):

* **Copenhagen**: \~57.8% chance to win.
* **Basel**: \~22.2% chance.
* **Draw**: \~25.6% chance.

The spread lines? Copenhagen is favored by **-0.75 goals** (per LowVig.ag), meaning bookmakers expect them to win by at least a goal‚Äîor at least avoid the kind of ‚Äúdramatic last-minute own goals‚Äù that haunt underdogs. The total goals line sits at **2.75**, suggesting a ‚Äúhigh-scoring thriller‚Äù (read: someone‚Äôs defense is napping).

**Digest the News: Injuries, Coach Drama, and a 6‚Äì1 Cup Win That Should‚Äôve Been Illegal**  
Copenhagen, Denmark‚Äôs answer to a well-brewed coffee, has been dominant at home and away. They‚Äôve won the Danish Superliga roughly every two years like a metronome set to ‚Äúrelentless.‚Äù Their recent qualifiers? A 5‚Äì0 thrashing of Malm√∂ and a 2‚Äì0 takedown of Drita. Key absences include **Elias Achour** (a forward who could‚Äôve scored a hat-trick against a wall) and **Thomas Delaney** (their midfield maestro, now replaced by a temporary ‚Äúplease wait‚Äù spinner).

Basel, meanwhile, is a Swiss bank account of inconsistency. They just won their first Superliga title since 2017, but their new coach, **M√•nin**, has lost twice in the league and once to a **6‚Äì1 cup drubbing**‚Äîa result soÊÉ®ÁÉà it should‚Äôve been a reality TV show.

The UEFA Champions League qualifiers have served up a classic underdog vs. favorite narrative, but this time, the underdog (Rangers) is the one needing a miracle to avoid being swept away by Club Brugge. Let‚Äôs dissect the numbers, news, and why Rangers might as well pack their bags for a vacation in Kyiv.

---

### Parse the Odds: Brugge‚Äôs Immaculate Math

The bookmakers aren‚Äôt just serving up odds‚Äîthey‚Äôre handing out math exams. Club Brugge is the undisputed star pupil here, with decimal odds hovering around **1.53‚Äì1.57** (implying a **62‚Äì64% implied probability** of victory). Rangers, meanwhile, are priced at **5.0‚Äì5.3** (a **18‚Äì19% chance**), which is about the same odds as me correctly guessing your favorite sandwich. The draw? A modest **4.4‚Äì4.5** (22‚Äì23%), which feels generous given Brugge‚Äôs 4-2 aggregate cushion from the first leg.

The spread markets also tell a story: Brugge is favored by **-1.0 goals**, meaning they must win by *at least* two goals to ‚Äúcover.‚Äù For Rangers, it‚Äôs a +1.0 lifeline, which is as thrilling as being told you can pass a pop quiz if you guess all answers ‚ÄúC.‚Äù

---

### Digest the News: Rangers‚Äô Quest for the Holy Grail (of Goals)

Club Brugge enters this leg as a well-oiled machine. Fourth in the Belgian league, they‚Äôve sliced through Salzburg and now Rangers like a chef dicing a ripe tomato. Their ‚Äúslick‚Äù passing game, as described, sounds less like soccer and more like a LinkedIn post for a hedge fund. Key players like Simon Mignolet (goalkeeper, *age 34, still defying gravity*) and Hans Vanaken (goal-scoring maestro) form a core that‚Äôs as reliable as your morning coffee.

Rangers, though, are the soccer equivalent of a GPS that says, ‚ÄúRecalculating‚Ä¶ again.‚Äù They‚Äôve scraped past Panathinaikos and Plzen but stumbled against Viktoria Plze≈à and are mired in a three-game domestic draw streak.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **UEFA Champions League Qualification: Qarabaƒü FK vs Ferencv√°ros TC ‚Äì A Match of Nerves, Not Noose**

**Parsing the Odds: The Math of Mayhem**  
Let‚Äôs cut through the noise with some cold, hard numbers. Qarabaƒü FK is the favorite here, with odds hovering around **2.2-2.3** (implying a **45-47% implied probability** of winning). Ferencv√°ros TC, the underdog, sits at **3.0-3.1** (**32-33%**), while the draw is a tidy **3.4-3.5** (**29-30%**). Translating this: Qarabaƒü is the cautious bet, but the draw isn‚Äôt a joke.

The spread? Qarabaƒü is a slight -0.25 favorite, meaning they‚Äôre expected to win or draw. The total goals line sits at **2.5-2.75**, with ‚Äúover‚Äù priced at **1.8-1.95** and ‚Äúunder‚Äù at **2.03-2.05**. In simpler terms: expect a tight, low-scoring affair unless someone breaks out a firework of chaos.

**Digesting the News: First Leg Lessons**  
Remember the first leg? Ferencv√°ros hosted Qarabaƒü and lost **1-3**. That means Qarabaƒü carries a **2-goal aggregate advantage** into this second leg. But here‚Äôs the twist: in UEFA ties, the away goals rule is dead, buried, and now a ghost in the group stage. So Ferencv√°ros needs to win this match **by two clear goals** to advance. Qarabaƒü? They can afford a draw. A 0-0 or 1-1 result, and they‚Äôre through. Easy, right?

**Humorous Spin: Circus Acts and Coffee Shops**  
Let‚Äôs anthropomorphize this. Qarabaƒü is the seasoned tightrope walker, balancing on a high wire with one hand tied behind their back (because why not?). Ferencv√°ros? They‚Äôre the guy who bet their life savings on a single

Dear Governor DeWine,
I‚Äôm reaching out regarding the proposal to ban the naturally occurring plant Kratom (Mitragyna speciosa). A ban on this plant would be extremely harmful to many Ohio citizens, including myself, who rely on this natural substance to manage various health issues, such as chronic pain and mental health disorders like depression and anxiety.
Kratom, a natural plant used for centuries in traditional settings, benefits many individuals. Banning it would be comparable to banning coffee, another naturally occurring plant with psychoactive properties. Kratom is actually in the same plant family as coffee (Rubiaceae). A statewide ban on Kratom is both anti-science and unconstitutional. Ohio citizens, and all Americans, deserve the right to self-medicate with naturally occurring, plant-based substances as they see fit. This proposal is fundamentally anti-American and contradicts the freedoms we cherish.
Furthermore, a ban would likely create an unregulated black market, making the substance far less safe than it is under current conditions. Ohio citizens will continue to use Kratom, whether it is banned or not. We strongly prefer to use it in a safe, legal, and regulated manner.
Please reconsider this proposal, as it goes against the values of Ohioans and Americans alike.

In the beginning, our relationship was great! We took it slow, discussed all things future, and were on the same page. Here‚Äôs where I may be crazy, or a slight AH? For some background, we met at an engagement party. We started talking immediately after the party, and I made it very clear that how we met wasn‚Äôt the usual scene for me, I wasn‚Äôt that type of person- I‚Äôm very much a home body, not a big drinker and would overall prefer coffee and breakfast than alcohol and parties, and I was simply a guest at the event since the host was a close friend. He agreed, said he is the same and I felt honestly like I‚Äôd found a great match. 

Then, came football season. He plays (once a weekend) and it became very apparent quickly that he, very much, was a big drinker, and vaper (not my cup of tea AT ALL) and after games was out til very early almost each weekend. I brushed it off, as this club he had been apart of since he was a kid. I did the girlfriend thing and attended some after game nights and always thought this was a phase in his life he would grow out of. 

Fast forward 3 years, and we got engaged. This didn‚Äôt come as a surprise, as this was something we discussed doing prior to having kids, and he wanted kids sooner rather than later, as he was in his 30‚Äôs and always wanted to be a dad. 

Fast forward another year and we decide to start trying. We‚Äôd had many argument‚Äôs about him reducing his alcohol consumption and quitting vaping whilst trying to fall pregnant, and lo and behold- the month he did those things- pregnant! Anyway, here‚Äôs where I‚Äôm stuck. I have a background with substance abuse (not me personally, but parents). My father was a heavy smoker and an alcoholic and my mother was honestly just a downright nasty person. So bad so, I left their care at the age of 13, and have never seen them since. I had a sibling pass away in their care, only months old, due to neglect, and I‚Äôve been traumatised by this, and it promised myself when I had kids, raising them would be SO different from how I was raised. I don‚Äôt want my children growing up with excessive drinking, nor be around smoking of any kind, and that‚Äôs where I feel like I may be the AH in this situation. 

I feel like I‚Äôve asked my fianc√© to change who he is as a person. Felt like whilst I was pregnant and at home alone I was constantly begging him to be home, cut back the drinking, stop vaping, and would often tell him he better be done with it (vaping) by the time our child was born. Fast forward to now. My son is 10 months old, and is the BEST thing that has happened to me. My partner is a great dad. He shares a great bond with our son, and loves him dearly. Though, since his birth, we‚Äôve had some hiccups. One occasion, when our son was just a few weeks old, he went out for ‚Äòa couple drinks‚Äô for his birthday, came home plastered and throwing up all over the place. I was still post partum, healing, and thought I was being hormonal, we argued and he apologised. Months later I found out he had been vaping behind my back, again apologised, said he did it to deal with the stress of work. Some more weeks later and after a few too many drinks he had literally urinated on 2 separate occasions on the floor with no recollection, each time we argued and came to no resolution other than he was sorry. I guess him taking a break from drinking every weekend with our newborn lowered his tolerance? This behaviour had never occurred in the 4 years prior in our relationship.

Here‚Äôs where I feel like I‚Äôm going crazy? Am I crazy for asking him to change his lifestyle completely? Am I crazy for not saying ‚Äòthis isn‚Äôt the relationship for me‚Äô yet trying to change him? He is the BEST dad to our son, but will often choose to be out with his friends over home with us, can‚Äôt say no when offered a drink or a vape. I get these things aren‚Äôt hard drugs, but they are non negotiables for me, and rather than just quitting for the sake of me and our son, he‚Äôll either do it behind my back or act like ‚ÄòI‚Äôve only had a few‚Äô which I can tell is a lie. I know he has addiction issues, that fact would not be news to me. 

I love being a mother, but with his lifestyle it can sometimes feel like I‚Äôm drowning. He works Mon-Fri 8-5, one weekend day is game day/night, and the other day I have to choose between catching up on the house work, spending time as a family or prioritising myself and getting out of the house. I have not spent longer than an hour away from our son, the whole time since he‚Äôs been born, and honestly maybe that might be why I‚Äôm feeling this way, resentment to a degree maybe? As stated above, I‚Äôm estranged from my family, so I don‚Äôt really have anyone I can rely on for help. It feels like my whole life has changed and been flipped upside down, whilst his continues on the same, when HE was the one who wanted kids so badly. This is where I‚Äôm lost, he is a GREAT dad, looked after me well after I gave birth and is happy for me to stay home as long as I need to raise our son. But on the flip side, he‚Äôs a poor communicator, can‚Äôt give up alcohol and nicotine, doesn‚Äôt know ‚Äòlimits‚Äô and I‚Äôm honestly feeling more distant than ever from him right now and I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs just the standard ‚Äòjust had a baby room mate phase‚Äô or am I put off by his unchanged behaviour?

What do you think of USec Lia Badillo's response to Morning Coffee?

See Morning Coffee Thoughts original post below:  
\[COMMENTARY\]

üü• How Malaca√±ang and the DILG Disrespected General Torre

This morning, while sipping coffee and scrolling through different reports about the sudden dismissal of General Nicolas Torre III, something didn‚Äôt sit right. 

He had barely served 85 days as PNP Chief before Malaca√±ang cut him loose. On the surface, it looked like just another reshuffle. 

But as someone who pays attention to patterns of behavior, I couldn‚Äôt shake the thought that there was more to it‚Äîa story behind the story.

I don‚Äôt write this to accuse the SILG or Malaca√±ang. 

At the end of the day, these are just my thoughts written out loud, my attempt to piece together what happened and why it unfolded this way.

üü• The systematic undermining of Torre‚Äôs authority

It started with Torre doing what every PNP Chief is empowered to do. 

On August 6, 2025, he reassigned 13 senior police officials, including Lt. Gen. Jose Melencio Nartatez Jr. and Lt. Gen. Bernard Banac. Under Section 26 of Republic Act 6975, this was well within his authority.

But eight days later, the National Police Commission (NAPOLCOM), chaired by DILG Secretary Jonvic Remulla, passed Resolution No. 2025-0531 reversing his orders. 

The resolution went further: it threatened Torre with administrative sanctions if he failed to comply. 

It was a bureaucratic trap‚Äîfollow your mandate and risk punishment, or bend to the DILG and give up your authority. 

Either way, you lose.

üü• Integrity branded as defiance

Torre didn‚Äôt cave. On August 18, during the flag-raising ceremony at Camp Crame, he stood before his people and presented the officers he had appointed. 

For him, it was an assertion of his constitutional role as PNP Chief. 

But the administration twisted it, painting his action as ‚Äúdefiance.‚Äù

Several Police Regional Offices later issued statements of support, noting that Torre‚Äôs actions were aligned with Section 26 of RA 6975 and were not only lawful but necessary to keep the force disciplined and mission-ready. 

Still, integrity was recast as arrogance, and that label was later used to justify his removal.

üü• The calculated disrespect by DILG Secretary Remulla

Remulla‚Äôs role made the entire affair sting sharper. 

On August 18, the same day Torre stood by his appointees, Remulla publicly claimed the issue had already been ‚Äúresolved internally.‚Äù 

But behind the scenes, moves were already underway to replace him.

When Torre was finally removed, Remulla quickly distanced himself, insisting it was solely the President‚Äôs call. 

But as DILG Secretary and NAPOLCOM chairman, his fingerprints were all over the conflict. 

The denial was disingenuous‚Äîa refusal to own the consequences of his own maneuvering.

Then came the public spectacle. 

Instead of discretion, Remulla staged a press conference at Camp Crame right after Torre‚Äôs dismissal. 

He declared, ‚ÄúInstitutions must be larger than the people who run them.‚Äù 

The words sounded lofty, but in context, they carried a sting. 

They implied Torre had placed himself above the institution when, in truth, he was defending it. 

It was humiliation presented as principle, a warning to others not to challenge DILG authority.

üü• Malaca√±ang‚Äôs cold hand

From Malaca√±ang, the dismissal came in a single line from Executive Secretary Lucas Bersamin: 

‚ÄúYou are hereby relieved as Chief, PNP effective immediately.‚Äù

No detailed explanation. 

No acknowledgment of service. 

The silence was as loud as the memo itself.

What makes it harder to digest is that Torre‚Äôs record was far from tarnished. 

He was the officer who led the high-profile arrests of former President Rodrigo Duterte and Pastor Apollo Quiboloy. 

He had no pending cases, no charges. Remulla himself admitted Torre ‚Äúdid not violate any laws.‚Äù 

Yet politics weighed heavier than performance.

üü• The impact on morale

Torre wasn‚Äôt just another chief. 

He was the first Philippine National Police Academy graduate to rise to the highest position. 

For many inside the force, that fact alone carried pride. 

His removal after only 85 days didn‚Äôt just unsettle his allies‚Äîit demoralized officers across the ranks. 

If the Chief could be discarded so abruptly, what shield does anyone else have when politics comes into play?

üü• The broader pattern of institutional disregard

Looking at the timeline, a larger picture emerges. 

Bureaucratic processes, like NAPOLCOM resolutions, were weaponized against him. 

Due process was absent‚ÄîTorre never had a proper hearing or a chance to defend his decisions.

The context makes it even more unsettling. 

Former PNP Chief Oscar Albayalde once slammed what he called the ‚Äúdisrespectful treatment‚Äù of officials. 

Torre himself had been accused of showing ‚Äúdisrespect‚Äù when handling the arrest of Duterte. 

That cycle of disrespect‚Äîcriticized one day, consumed by it the next‚Äîseems to be repeating itself.

üü• My takeaway

Piecing these details together, I see a pattern: authority undermined through bureaucracy, integrity reframed as defiance, political convenience taking precedence over professional merit. 

A man who acted within his mandate was stripped of his position, not through open inquiry or fair process, but through calculated moves and a media spectacle.

I don‚Äôt write this to defend Torre personally, nor to accuse Malaca√±ang or the DILG outright. 

I write this because when I read the reports, side by side, the pattern became too obvious to ignore.

And it leaves me with one thought I can‚Äôt shake: in this country, integrity isn‚Äôt always rewarded. Sometimes, it‚Äôs the very reason you get cut down.

üü• Nota Bene:

A previous version of this commentary mentioned that General Torre tried to call the DILG and was ignored. I have removed that sentence.

My thanks to Atty. Lia Badillo, from the DILG, for reaching out to provide context and clarity on that particular issue. 

And while she is here, perhaps she could help us by sharing the full context surrounding the events‚Äîso the public can better understand what really happened.

Thanks, Atty.

New Sloan loveseat with Standard is honestly only measuring in at 22-23"" depth.","I ordered a 71"" Sloan loveseat in French blue and it arrived last week! While there are lovely things about this ""long"" loveseat (especially the smooth beautiful velvet upholstery), it's a little short and feels a little shallow. The actual seat depth is only measuring in at 22-23"", is this because the cushions are a little firm right now?? 

Even with obsessive research (you all know...), I had no idea there was a 75"" or 79"" sofa version of Sloan.  Thankfully I learned about Interior Define's exchange policy, within 60 days of delivery you can make an exchange with a 25% service charge of the new purchase. Beats the 50% return  fee! I'd definitely like a sofa that's longer, but would it be worth a deeper version of the Sloan? I'm only 5'2"", but with my feet propped up on the coffee table I feel like my knees are hanging over a little more than I'd like. 

Thoughts on the actual feel of the deep seat compared to standard? I mean, if a supposed standard depth is only coming in at 22"", is the deep seat depth not actually coming in at 28""? ",2,1756265634.0,interiordefine,0,1.0,False

Need advice on how to make -bara respectfully hehe

We‚Äôve been happily married for 2 years na, no kids yet (intentional), and so far happy ako with my husband. 

Background lang I grew up in a middle-class family, only child ako. My mom is traditional,  pinapagawa niya talaga lahat ng house chores sakin nung high school maglaba, magplantsa, magluto, mag-grocery. Sabi niya pa nga ‚Äúpara hindi ka i-soli ng asawa mo pag di ka marunong‚Äù (haha thanks mom). But when I started working, we hired a full time house help. 

Si husband naman nag-solo living siya in a condo before our marriage, natuto rin siya mag-isa. After kasal, we moved in together in a small condo sa Makati, everything is walking distance and may maayos na appliances. I work hybrid work set up so technically kaya ko naman mag-asikaso.

Pero the first time I did laundry using our washer/dryer, my husband literally stopped me and said jokingly: *‚ÄúStop that, hindi bagay sayo, nahihirapan ka. Let‚Äôs just pay someone.‚Äù* So ayun, nag-hire siya ng stay-out help na pumupunta 3x a week for cleaning and laundry.

As for food, I cook his breakfast (eggs, toast, coffee lang naman). For the rest of the meals, naka-diet delivery service kami may target macros and calories kami. We‚Äôre both health conscious and honestly, everything is going smooth clean house, healthy meals, lots of time for each other. Verry smooth and happy so far. 

Last weekend, we went to his side‚Äôs family gathering. Syempre, the classic question: *‚ÄúWala pa kayong kids? Kailan kayo magkaka-baby?‚Äù* I usually smile and say, *‚ÄúWhen the right time comes.‚Äù* Then magbibigay pa sila ng unsolicited advice like *‚Äúuminom kayo ng raw eggs, magpahilot, magsayaw sa obando‚Äù* (you know, the usual boomer stuff).

Then one tita goes: *‚ÄúPrinsesang-prinsesa yan, wala yang ginagawa sa bahay.‚Äù* (FYI, she once visited on a weekend where yung cleaning lady namin was around, kaya siguro na-judge na agad).

So ayun, the lecture started na I should be a dutiful housewife, serve my husband, baka raw kaya wala kaming kids kasi para pa din daw  binata and dalaga pa din. Sumabat pa yung tito ang pinsan na guys. This was not the first time pala.

After that night, napaisip din ako. Does men prefer dutiful wives? I asked my husband if mas prefer ba nya yung traditional housewife na nagasikaso without help, kasi honestly I don‚Äôt mind, marunong naman ako. Ang sagot niya hindi daw kasi mas gusto daw nya hindi ako busy at mag-dadate lang daw kami anytime we want to.Ayun so in short happy kame.

Comments like this from relatives can also mess your head . It is not nice. Sana matuto ng manners at mag stop na to sa generation nila. I hope our generation and the next matuto na mag preno.
 

next time na may ganito na namang relatives na makialam, I kinda want to be a bit blunt para matahimik na sila. I don‚Äôt want to be disrespectful, pero I also don‚Äôt want to let it slide lagi.

The time had finally come for them to leave the planet again. Brent looked down to the helmet securely tucked under his arm, then back up to their ship which was currently sitting atop a shuttle carrier which sat at the end of a very long runway. They boarded the lower craft, and were quickly seated, and strapped into the four point harnesses. The take off was effortless, and as he glanced out of the window, the ground seemed to drop away. He felt his lips curling into a slight smile. Myranda reached over and took his hand, giving a light squeeze.

‚ÄúAre you ready for this?‚Äù she asked.

‚ÄúI am.‚Äù he answered, and at that very moment the sign to put on their helmets illuminated.

They both did so, and the nose of the craft angled up slightly. They went through the atmosphere much easier than the rocket had and minutes after they each felt themselves rising up against the harnesses, they unbuckled. They lined up and climbed the ladder into their new vessel and home. Each of them quickly strapped into the seats at their assigned stations.

‚ÄúHull and heat shielding all green.‚Äù Brenton called.

‚ÄúEngines and navigation system are ready to go.‚Äù proclaimed Kimura.

‚ÄúCommunications online and all good here.‚Äù said Myranda.

‚ÄúScanners are on and ready.‚Äù Bert checked in.

A moment later and the pilot had requested the release of the docking clamps, which had been granted. Brenton watched as the shuttle began to maneuver away from them, on a path that would take them around the moon and then back to Earth. They drifted away and after nearly an hour of weightlessness, the pilot spoke up again.

‚ÄúFive minute burn followed by minor thruster adjustments in ten seconds. Hold tight for low G's.‚Äù she proclaimed.

They all mentally counted down before being forced back against the gel-padded cushions between their bodies and the frames of the chairs. It felt like an invisible palm pressing on Brent's chest as the gravitational force made it difficult to breathe. He closed his eyes and squeezed the arm rests through the thick gloves of his flight suit, his knuckles turning white with the effort. The burn ended and gravity disappeared once more. He pulled a deep breath into his lungs once he was able and his eyelids rolled open slowly.

‚ÄúYou can take your helmets off now. We'll be cruising on recycled air until we hit the Skid for an oxygen refill.‚Äù the pilot said through the intercom system.

All of them twisted and removed the headgear, and as Brent attached it to his web belt by the tab above the rear seal, he mused how much sleeker and more stylish these were. For one thing, the outer shell was molded around the headlamps rather than them being mounted on. For another they some color to them, with lightning-bolt style streaks of red, yellow and black on each side. They matched the new flightsuits, their names embroidered in red on the chest of the clean, white suits which were tailored to their bodies.

The boots fit better, as well. He didn't mind the added comfort, and was sure that the others didn't either.

‚ÄúYou are free to move about, but be careful. We don't have gravity.‚Äù Myranda called.

Brent immediately reached for the release on his harness, drifting up off of the seat, using his body weight to maneuver off of the bridge and down a ladder into the galley. He removed a smaller flip-top bottle with his name printed on the metallic surface from the cooler, taking a few long gulps of the crisp, clean water. He floated over to one of the tables and strapped in. He wasn't alone long, Myranda joining him, slipping her feet into the stirrup like holds on the floor in front of the seat next to him.

‚ÄúAre you happy to be back out here?‚Äù she asked cordially.

‚ÄúI am, it feels good.‚Äù he replied.

‚ÄúYeah, me too. Hey, you hungry?‚Äù she said.

He nodded and she removed her feet from the things holding her in place. She heated a pair of the prepackaged meals, bringing one over to the table to him, along with the packet containing his flatware, which he quickly pulled free and then removed the film over a bit of his food, shoveling that into his mouth before the soy meat substitute could start to float away. It wasn't as good as real food, but close enough to the taste to be satisfying. Adding the hot sauce from the squeeze packet helped disguise the bland flavor.

After they finished eating, they made their way back to their duty stations. The spent several hours there before the pilot broke the silence that hung in the air again.

‚ÄúIf anyone wants to take a nap, now is as good a time as any.‚Äù she said quietly.

Brenton took the cue, moving down the ladder and through the galley into a short hallway beyond. The doors to the crew quarters lined the corridor and he entered the first one that he approached, securing his helmet and gloves before strapping himself into the bunk nearest the door, falling asleep nearly as soon as he closed his eyes. The lights were still dim when he woke, but he was no longer alone. Kimura had occupied the bunk across the small room from him. He rose from his bunk and climbed back up onto the bridge.

Myranda was flying the ship, with Bertrand in his station. The larger man unbuckled and drifted back toward his own seat when he saw Brent approaching.

‚ÄúWhat's the news?‚Äù the younger man asked, glancing down at the screen, seeing nothing concerning.

‚ÄúNot much to see or say. We're on course to the Skid, and on time.‚Äù Bert told him, his deep brown eyes not breaking away from his own console.

‚ÄúI'm just about to go wake up the relief pilot, unless one of you want to fill in for me? We're basically on auto-pilot anyway.‚Äù Myranda said, speaking over her her shoulder, rather than through the speakers.

‚ÄúI'll take the wheel.‚Äù Bert volunteered quickly, then added. ‚ÄúYou want to run navigation for me, just in case?‚Äù the hulking man asked, turning his head toward Brent.

He nodded and unbuckled again, drifting toward the front of the ship, somersaulting into the gel-padded chair, pulling the harness down over his shoulders.

‚ÄúHow are you holding up?‚Äù the large man asked as Brent tapped the screen, the display of their flight path enlarging, showing him the blips of debris and satellites that was between them and the station.

‚ÄúJust fine. I feel better now that we are back out here.‚Äù he answered simply. ‚ÄúHow about you?‚Äù came the counter.

‚ÄúI'm already homesick.‚Äù he replied with a quiet snort.

Brent chuckled himself.

‚ÄúI can understand. You have a kid, right?‚Äù he asked casually.

‚ÄúYeah, a daughter. She's barely three.‚Äù the man in the pilot's seat said.

‚ÄúWhy didn't you request a substitute?‚Äù the younger of the two probed. A few long seconds of silence passed between them.

‚ÄúYou saw the pay, plus the bonuses if we actually find anything.‚Äù came the simple explanation.

They both fell quiet for a while after that. A few days passed in similar fashion before they were docked at their former place of work.

‚ÄúThat's a sweet ride.‚Äù the man who greeted them said, smiling from ear to ear.

‚ÄúState of the art!‚Äù Kimura gushed.

‚ÄúWe'll make sure you're all set by the day after tomorrow, first thing in the morning.‚Äù the dock master assured.

They were put up in the VIP suites this time, and as they had requested, Brent and Myranda's rooms were adjoining. They spent time strolling around the upper ring, when they weren't entangled in one another or drinking away their downtime. The other members of the crew did pretty much the same, whiling away their time in the lounge or much fancier recreation room at the top of the station. When they were able they moved on, and within two days, they were further beyond the station than the majority of manned craft had ever gone.

This would be their last brush with civilization for months, their supplies would be delivered by unmanned craft at pre-determined points along the route. The reality of that hadn't fully set in on Brenton, who had yet to start feeling any sort of desire to return to the big blue marble. They shifted places again when Kimura and the other crewman returned from the bunks, and soon enough, he found himself in the galley, placing a coffee pod into the machine, placing his cup into the small space beneath that.

Once the receptacle was full, the machine placed a flip-top lid over the top. He claimed that and blew into the tiny vent holes in the top. He flipped the tab back and blew into that, both to cool and to contain the liquid before he took a small sip. He burned his tongue slightly despite the precautions, recoiling and closing the lid as he sucked cool air into his pursed lips, trying to sooth the scalded muscle to little avail. He waited for the pain to fade before trying again, though it flared up every time the still warm beverage washed over the effected area.

He went back to his place and just as he was getting the harness fastened, a high-pitched blip split the air from Bertrand's vacant station. He was already moving as Kimura called out.

‚ÄúI think that's our scanner.‚Äù she said, her voice calm.

‚ÄúIt is.‚Äù he confirmed, with an edge of excitement creeping into the words.

He strapped into the seat and adjusted the harness, pressing the screen which fed him more information.

‚ÄúIt looks like we found something with a similar mineral content to the coins.‚Äù he said, though he wasn't able to tell her what. He only had a surface level understanding of the data he was gazing down at.

‚ÄúSend me the coordinates, then brace for maneuvers.‚Äù the pilot said.

That he knew how to do, the data transfer happening instantaneously, and a few heartbeats leater he felt the vessel tilt around him and then the pressure of gravity forcing him back and down against the gel cushions. He held each breath and gripped the arms of the chair, his knuckles turning white as he squeezed. She cut the main engine and he took his first full breath for what felt like minutes. While he composed himself, the pilot called back to Earth to change their resupply coordinates. The reply was a positive one.

They would also be sending a drone and a lander big enough for two of the crew. Brenton immediately called dibs. Kimura put a finger to her lips and winked. Once the communication ended, she let out a soft laugh.

‚ÄúYou really want to see what we picked up, huh?‚Äù she teased him.

‚ÄúDon't you?‚Äù he shot back.

She shrugged her shoulders.

‚ÄúOf course I do, but I'm not sure I want to make that drop.‚Äù she confessed.

He shrugged his shoulders. Free-falling in an enclosed crate, strapped into a lander sounded like a perfect way to spend his time. His mind was occupied with that exact fantasy for the week it took to reach their destination, a massive, jagged hunk of rock. Myranda had volunteered to go down to the surface with Brenton, and Bert had rolled his eyes, making a jovial comment about turning their mission into a date. Everyone had laughed, but in a way, it was sort of true. The time they spent in orbit was hell for all of them.

The walls of the ship seemed to be closing in, and each of them had made an excuse to take a space walk. That hadn't helped the sense of cabin fever that was building as they traveled along with the chuck of rock they were anchored to. The proximity alarm sharpened them all up and they sprang into action, Brent and Bert making their way to the cargo deck, securing the crate that contained the lander. They opened the crate and went through the checklist to ensure that the vehicle was in good condition, which it was.

It was another day before he and Myranda suited up, they were harnessed into the seat and the crate was sealed around them. They activated their oxygen tanks as Kimura started counting down to their drop. Then it happened, the gas jets pushing them toward the planet. Both held on for dear life as the gravity of the rock below captured them and they began to fall at a speed that felt as if it were pushing their stomachs up into their throats. The landing wasn't much gentler than the fall had been, and even though they had done simulations, neither were prepared for the sudden stop.

He checked the device on his arm as the crate opened and the ramp lowered. Myranda pressed the ignition button and it started up. The lights splashed over the black and brown stone that they had landed on. The man in the passenger seat pressed the screen molded into the wrist of his gauntlet.

‚ÄúWe're a hundred and fifty meters out. Take it slow.‚Äù he told the driver.

She goosed the throttle and they were off, the spikes on the wheels punching through the surface of the asteroid as they shot forward, keeping them anchored to the thing. He watched the distance to their target dwindle, calling out their progress in increments of ten until they got down to five. Myranda slowed, both of them already able to see the object that they had detected. It was a large monolith of smooth metal, the lights from the rover as it eased forward.

‚ÄúAre you guys seeing this?‚Äù the man asked, his voice strangled, almost breathless.

‚ÄúAffirmative, but what the hell is it?‚Äù Bertrand's voice, tinny and distant through the speakers in the helmet.

‚ÄúStop the rover. I'm going to take a walk, try to get some close up images.‚Äù he told Myranda.

She nodded and parked just a few yards from the spire, which was roughly twelve feet tall. Brenton caught himself holding his breaths as he released himself from the harness, tossing the anchor spike attached to the reel on his belt before he began to maneuver slowly toward the thing. He could see his reflection in the obviously polished surface, and the thing was seemingly molded, rather than assembled, one large copper-toned tower with no visible seams. There were faint etchings around the center point, but otherwise the thing bore no markings.

He didn't know what compelled him, but he reached out and put his hand on the obelisk. There was a sort of ping in his mind, and a flash, and then. Nothing.",1,1756265166.0,u_OutlawWriter,0,1.0,False
1n16evl,https://www.reddit.com/r/WomenDatingOverForty/comments/1n16evl/low_effort_dates/,Low Effort Dates,"Hello everyone! I just recently turned 41 and have been single for the past few years. I stumbled on this sub and found it to be so relatable that I decided to join. I noticed that the official position of this sub is against coffee / walking dates and I wanted to ask everyone a question about that:

In general, I also want a man to make an effort and plan high-quality dates, like a nice dinner or an experience that is catered to both of our interests and preferences. The exception to that is the first date. I have had MANY experiences where a man takes me to a multi-course fine dining experience or a longer engagement, and I have known pretty early in the date that he is not a match for me. It ends up being extremely awkward for me because I feel like there isn't an easy exit, so I end up enduring the date and feeling later that I have wasted my time.

So I have started doing a thing where the first date is always a coffee / walking date (my stated preference) as a screening tool so that I am not wasting my time and effort on someone who I know early on is not a match for me. After the first date, I let him know my expectations around future dates. 

I have not found any other way to keep it casual enough to gracefully dip out of dates that I know will be a waste of both of our time.

As the group does not advocate for these types of dates, how do you handle this particular situation? Do you just accept that the trade-off for a higher investment date is that you might need to sit through ones you'd rather not be in once you get there? (For compatibility reasons, of course--if a man ever made me feel uncomfortable or unsafe, I'd leave no matter what the circumstances were.)

[Ninja](https://www.ninjakitchen.com/) offers two popular choices: the Ninja Slushie 3-in-1 (FS300) and the Ninja Slushie 5-in-1 (FS301). 

Both make frozen drinks without ice, but they differ in settings, size, and features. After looking at specs and user reviews, here's a clear breakdown of what they share and what sets them apart so you can decide which one fits your lifestyle best.

# Ninja Slushie 3 in-1 vs 5 in1: Similarities

**RapidChill Technology**

Both the FS300 and FS301 use Ninja's RapidChill system, which spins an auger around a cooling cylinder to freeze liquids evenly. This means smooth slushies without ice chunks or watered-down taste‚Äîa big plus many U.S. users point out compared to blender-made drinks.

**Works with Many Drinks**

No matter which model you choose, you can turn soda, juice, coffee, or even wine into frozen drinks. Depending on the liquid, it takes about 15‚Äì60 minutes to get the right texture. Families often use them for summer treats, while adults enjoy them for frozen cocktails at parties.

**Adjustable Texture**

Both models let you control how thick or thin your slushie is. This is handy because soda might need one texture, while coffee or juice works better with another. Many buyers say this makes the machines more flexible.

**Sugar or Substitutes Needed**

Both the FS300 and FS301 need sugar (or a sugar substitute) to be able to freeze properly. Without it, the mix will stay liquid. In the U.S., some users recommend allulose for making sugar-free versions that still taste good.

**Easy to Clean**

Both models are built for quick cleanup. They have removable drip trays, dishwasher-safe parts, and detachable lids. Most people say cleaning is simple, though some still prefer to hand-wash for extra care.

**Drinks Stay Cold for Hours**

Both machines keep drinks frozen for up to 12 hours. That makes them useful for parties or long afternoons when you want refills without remaking a batch.

**Solid Build and Design**

The FS300 and FS301 have the sturdy build people expect from Ninja. While they do take up some counter space, most reviewers say the sleek design looks good alongside other kitchen appliances.

**Great for Families and Parties**

At their core, both models are about making frozen drinks at home. Kids love soda slushies, and adults can enjoy frozen cocktails without leaving the house. For U.S. families, they've become a fun way to replace store-bought drinks.

# Noise Level

Both the Ninja Slushie 3-in-1 (FS300) and 5-in-1 (FS301) are quieter than a standard blender. Reviewers often mention that they can run in the kitchen without disturbing the whole house. This is nice for U.S. families who use them during early mornings or late-night gatherings.

# Safety Features

Both machines are designed with safety locks. If the lid isn't closed properly, they won't start. Some users say this saved them from spills when they were still figuring out how to use the machine.

# Ninja Slushie 3-in-1 vs 5-in-1: Key Differences

# Preset Programs

The first big difference is in presets. The Ninja Slushie 3-in-1 (FS300) has three modes: slush, spiked slush, and milkshake. The Ninja Slushie 5-in-1 (FS301) adds two more‚Äîfrozen juice and frapp√©. U.S. users who like variety often prefer the 5-in-1 since it handles more drink styles with a single button.

# Drink Capacity

The FS300 holds up to 72 oz, while the FS301 steps it up to 88 oz. That means the 5-in-1 can make a few more servings per batch. Families in the U.S. say the bigger capacity feels more convenient when hosting parties or making drinks for kids and adults at the same time.

# Fill Line Limits

Even though both vessels look large, the max fill line is different. The FS300 lets you fill up to 48 oz, while the FS301 allows 64 oz. This difference matters if you plan to serve multiple drinks without stopping to refill.

# Size and Footprint

The FS301 is about an inch taller than the FS300. Both take up similar counter space, but the extra height could be an issue if you have low cabinets. Some U.S. buyers mention this when choosing which one fits their kitchen setup.

# Color Options

The FS300 often comes in Arctic Blue with dark gray accents, while the FS301 is usually in a sleek black and gray finish. It's a small detail, but some people like having a color option that stands out or blends with their other appliances.

# Accessories and Design Touches

The FS301 includes premium accents, a drip tray, and a pour handle. The FS300 keeps it simpler with fewer design extras. For U.S. buyers who care about style or want the extra tray to avoid messes, the FS301 feels more polished.

# Cooling Consistency

While both can hold drinks for hours, the FS301 is noted to **maintain an even texture longer** at higher capacity. With the FS300, drinks sometimes separate a bit faster, so you may need to stir more often.

# Ease of Dispensing

Reviewers mention the FS301's **no-drip spout** feels sturdier and less messy compared to the FS300. For frequent use at parties, that's a small but handy upgrade.

¬†**Ninja Slushie 3-in-1 (FS300) Pros**

1. ¬† Compact size that fits better in small kitchens.

2. ¬† Easier to use with only three straightforward presets.

3. ¬† Works well for simple drinks like soda slushies and frozen cocktails.

4. ¬† Dishwasher-safe parts make cleaning simple.

5. ¬† Often noted as the more affordable option.

**Cons**

1. ¬† Smaller fill line (48 oz) limits how much you can make at once.

2. ¬† Lacks frozen juice and frapp√© presets, so you need to adjust manually.

3. ¬† Spout design can be a bit messier compared to the 5-in-1.

¬†**Ninja Slushie 5-in-1 (FS301) Pros**

1. ¬† Larger 88 oz vessel makes it better for families and parties.

2. ¬† Five presets, including frozen juice and frapp√©, give more variety.

3. ¬† Keeps texture consistent longer at higher capacity.

4. ¬† Sturdier spout and drip tray reduce mess during serving.

5. ¬† Premium design and accents look sleek on the counter.

**Cons**

1. ¬† Heavier and taller, so moving it or fitting it under cabinets can be tricky.

2. ¬† Some reviewers report durability issues, like broken augers or spouts.

3. ¬† Needs sugar or substitutes for proper slushing, which limits certain recipes.

¬†**User Review and Feedback**

From both Amazon reviews and [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com) threads, most people agree that the Ninja Slushie 5-in-1 (FS301) is the more practical choice. Users highlight its larger capacity and extra presets, which save time and make it better for U.S. families or parties.

The 3-in-1 (FS300) still works well, but Reddit users note you need to adjust settings manually to mimic missing modes, and the smaller fill line can feel limiting. Common concerns for both models include the sugar requirement, occasional durability issues, and the machines being heavy to move around.

# Final Thoughts and Recommendations

I would personally recommend the Ninja Slushie 3-in-1 (FS300) if you want something straightforward. It's compact, easy to use, and makes delicious frozen drinks without taking much counter space. Great for smaller households or casual use.

The Ninja Slushie 5-in-1 (FS301) feels better suited for families or anyone who entertains often. Its larger capacity, extra presets, and sturdier build make it more versatile and convenient.

Both models create smooth, restaurant-style slushies at home. Your choice depends on whether you prefer simple, compact, feature-rich, and party-ready.

The one monthly habit that plugs the holes? Reconciliation.

**Why Reconciliation Matters**

It isn‚Äôt just bookkeeping busywork. Reconciliation is the backbone of reliable decision-making. Without it, everything else‚Äîyour cash forecasts, A/R & A/P, tax filings, job bids‚Äîrests on bad data.

‚ñ™ Reconciliations catch mistakes early. Things like duplicate vendor invoices, missed deposits, or misposted expenses. Doing recs ensures they don‚Äôt sit for months snowballing.

‚ñ™ Recs ensure nonoperational costs get posted, like bank charges, interest, coffee runs, and employee cash advances.

‚ñ™ Reconciliations keep the CRA happy: Clean recs mean accurate GST filings and less accounting expense at tax time.

Builders who bid off bad numbers are eating costs halfway through a job. Reconciliations don't let that happen.

Once your accounts are reconciled, run job-cost vs. budget reports. That's where you'll catch silent cash leaks before they kill your profits.

Reconcile monthly, run relevant reports, and protect your profits.

Throw away cause I don‚Äôt want my friends to see this one, My name is Achilles (16 M) I‚Äôm in a band as the lead singer. I was dating a guy let‚Äôs call him Brad (16 M). We met in sophomore year. And he was on the varsity football team, honor roll, funny, popular, kind and everything you could want in a guy. I also play for the marching band for my school so that‚Äôs where we met. Behind the bleachers after a football game. He asked me if I was ‚Äúthe gay kid‚Äù because at my school there isn‚Äôt really any diversity at this Catholic private school, and as a Latino gay kid who grew up getting hit by my parents and bullied for my ethnicity and sexuality at school I was guarded. So when he snuck up behind me I punched him out of reaction. I apologized but still kept my fists up and he smiled at me despite the red mark across his cheek, man was his smile pretty, and just said he had some questions about his sexuality too and if it was okay if we talked for a bit. A bit became 3 hours of driving around. We became friends after that but he didn‚Äôt talk to me during school he would always just text me and asked if I wanted to hang out or grab coffee well we had been hanging out for about 6 months and then one night we were playing mario kart and I won and I was floating and teasing and then he pulled me down and kissed me. I didn‚Äôt go home that night. We ended up starting to date and all my friends told me ‚Äúdon‚Äôt date a DL guy‚Äù ‚Äúmen suck what are you doing?‚Äù ‚ÄúBrad are you serious??‚Äù But I didn‚Äôt listen. Even my best friend, Circe (17 F) told me ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs gonna break your heart.‚Äù Yeah I‚Äôm an idiot I know. But it was one day closing the summer I spent in his sheets, we were at a Dairy Queen when his friend came up and he physically pushed my chair away and went to greet his friend when he asked why he was with me and Brad said ‚Äúbecause I saw the (insert the gay slur) and he bought me ice cream‚Äù I excused myself and left and the apology texts started almost immediately. I stared at myself in the mirror, I didn‚Äôt recognize myself anymore. I ended it right there. From the end and even till now he‚Äôs begging me to come back, saying he‚Äôll come out of the closet for me, that he‚Äôs sorry and everything sucks without me, and that his bed feels cold and empty without me. Guys I still wanna go back I really do. I do love him. But I just can‚Äôt do that to myself, never can I do that to myself. The only thing that‚Äôs kept me from haveing a compete and totally psychotic break is the wishbone album by Conan gray (thank you for blessing my ears Conan I love you). I find myself singing ‚ÄúConnell‚Äù to myself every second of every day. so last week we I went to my band and asked if we could change our closing song for the carnival we‚Äôre performing two towns over to that. They said ‚ÄúHell yeah‚Äù I love my friends so much they‚Äôre the best. And so the next week we played our usual songs. Then played the requests. And I finally finished with Connell I cried most of the time on the boarderline sobbing as I sang but when I got home I felt strangely better a little embarrassed for crying but better. Until I get a DM from a girl on instagram, she texted me asking me if I knew Brad. I asked why? She said ‚Äúhe‚Äôs my boyfriend and he was staring at you like he lost something‚Äù I asked wtf was going on so she explained she was brads girlfriend and I had to sit down. So I told her everything and she said ‚ÄúI always had a feeling‚Äù and explained to me she lived two states away and came over to attend the festival with him. I didn‚Äôt even know he was there.

We thought we'd found paradise: a tiny town nestled in the Appalachian foothills, population 914, where you could rent a two-bedroom house for what we'd been paying for a studio apartment back in Kansas City. More importantly, it was far enough from our families that they couldn't interfere with our plans to get married without the circus they all wanted.

The real estate agent, a cheerful woman named Mrs. Wood, had shown us around town with obvious pride. Main Street stretched for exactly four blocks, lined with the kinds of shops you'd expect: Jacob's General Store, Mariah's Diner, a small post office, and an old-fashioned barber shop with the spinning pole. Everyone we met seemed genuinely friendly, the kind of place where neighbors actually knew each other's names.

""You'll love it here,"" Mrs. Wood had said as we signed the lease. ""Roxboro Hollow is very... traditional. People here value their routines.""

We settled in quickly. I found work at the county's road maintenance department, and Jordan got a part-time job at the library. The pace of life was exactly what we'd hoped for ‚Äì slow, peaceful, predictable. For the first month, everything was perfect.

Then came our first full moon.

I should mention that our house sits on a small hill at the edge of town, with a clear view of Main Street and most of the residential area. Jordan loves to sit on our back porch in the evenings, and I'd gotten into the habit of joining her with a beer after work. The night sky was flawlessly clear at least once a month.

It was during one of these quiet moments that we first witnessed what the locals simply call ""the watching.""

It started around 9 PM. Jordan noticed it first ‚Äì she'd been mid-sentence, telling me about some new books that had arrived at the library, when she suddenly stopped talking.

""Tony,"" she whispered, grabbing my arm. ""Look.""

Down in the town, people were emerging from their houses. But they weren't walking normally. They moved with an odd, mechanical precision, their arms hanging straight at their sides, their heads tilted back at angles that made my neck hurt just looking at them. Men, women, children ‚Äì entire families filing out of their homes and gathering in the streets, their faces turned skyward.

""What are they doing?"" Jordan asked.

I didn't have an answer. From our vantage point, we could see at least fifty people spread throughout the town, all standing perfectly still, all staring up at the stars. Their necks were craned back so far that it looked painful, unnatural. Some of the angles were so severe that I wondered how they could even breathe.

""Should we go check on them?"" Jordan asked, but something in her voice told me she really didn't want to.

Neither did I. There was something deeply wrong about the scene below us. The way they stood, motionless as scarecrows, their faces pale in the moonlight. Even from a distance, I could see that their eyes were open unnaturally wide, like they were trying to take in as much of the sky as possible.

We watched for nearly three hours. None of them moved except for the occasional slight adjustment of their head position, tracking something across the heavens that we couldn't see. No one spoke. No one even seemed to blink.

Then, as suddenly as it had begun, it ended. Around midnight, they all turned and walked back to their houses as naturally as possible, disappearing inside. Within minutes, the town looked completely normal again.

Jordan and I sat in stunned silence for a long time after that.

""Did that really just happen?"" she finally asked.

The next morning, we debated whether to ask anyone about it. At Mariah's Diner, our usual breakfast spot, everything seemed perfectly normal. Mariah greeted us with her usual smile, the coffee was hot, and the other customers chatted about mundane things: the weather, the upcoming church BBQ, someone's new partner.

Finally, I worked up the courage to bring it up. ""We noticed something interesting last night,"" I said to Mariah as she refilled our coffee. ""Looked like the whole town was out stargazing.""

Mariah's smile brightened considerably. ""Oh, you saw Him too! Wonderful. Not everyone can see Him clearly on their first viewing.""

""Him?"" Jordan asked.

""The Gazer,"" she said, as if it were the most natural thing in the world. ""He appears on the full moon, right there on its surface. Such a blessing to witness.""

I exchanged a glance with Jordan, our brains both saying *What the hell?* ""We didn't really see... anyone. Just people looking up.""

""Give it time,"" Mariah said warmly. ""Some folks need a few months before they can make *Him* out properly. He's quite large, you know. Takes up most of the moon's face, even.""

We got similar responses everywhere we asked. At the general store, Mr. Patter described ""the giant"" as having kind eyes, though he admitted you had to look very carefully to see the features forming in the lunar craters. The librarian, Mrs. Chan, told Jordan that the Gazer had been appearing to their community for generations, watching over them with paternal care.

It was like the entire town had agreed on this vague, dismissive explanation and refused to elaborate.

The next month, we were ready for it. We'd marked the calendar, noting that it had happened exactly on the night of the full moon. This time, we watched from the beginning.

At 9:03 PM, the first person emerged ‚Äì old botanist Mr. Gareth from down the street. Then Mrs. Buckley with her twin boys. Then the Gibsons, the Kings, the family whose name we still didn't know from the blue house on Greenview Street. One by one, they came outside and took their positions.

But this time, we could see more details, and what we saw made my blood run cold.

Their eyes weren't just wide open ‚Äì they were opened so far that I could see white all around the iris, like their eyelids had been pinned back. Their mouths hung slightly open, and I swear I could see drool glistening on some of their chins. The children's necks were bent at angles that would have been agonizing if they'd been conscious, their small heads tilted so far back that their faces were nearly parallel to the ground.

""Tony,"" Jordan whispered, her voice shaking. ""Look at their fingers.""

I followed her gaze and felt my stomach drop. Their hands weren't just hanging at their sides...their fingers were spread wide, stretched so far apart that the skin between them looked painful and white. Some of them had their fingers bent backward at the joints, creating shapes that human hands weren't meant to make.

I forced myself to look up at the moon, trying to see what they were all staring at so intently. At first, it just looked like a normal full moon to me; bright, round, crater-marked. But the longer I stared, the more I began to notice patterns in the shadows.

The dark patches seemed to be moving, shifting and rearranging themselves. What I'd initially dismissed as random crater formations began to look almost... deliberate. Like features trying to form. The longer I looked, the more convinced I became that there was something pulsing and tunneling just below the moon's surface.

""Do you see it?"" Jordan asked, her voice strange and distant.

I did see it, or thought I did. A massive face taking shape in the moon's geography, with deep craters for eyes and what looked like mountain ranges forming the suggestion of a mouth. The face seemed impossibly large, as if something the size of a continent was pressing itself against the back of the moon, leaving impressions in the rock.

""We need to call someone,"" I said, tearing my gaze away.

""Who? The police? What would we tell them? That our neighbors like to look at stars in uncomfortable positions?""

We watched for four hours that night. The face in the moon seemed to become clearer as time passed, more defined, and I couldn't shake the feeling that it was looking back at us. Looking back at all of us.

The third month, I made a decision that I now regret. I decided to get closer.

Against Jordan's protests, I crept down the hill and hid behind the Wood's garden shed, about twenty feet from where Mrs. Wood herself stood with her husband and teenage daughter. From this distance, I could hear them.

They were humming.

It wasn't a melody, exactly but more like a constant, low vibration that seemed to come from deep in their throats. The sound made my teeth hurt and sent shivers down my spine. But worse than the humming was the smell.

They reeked of ozone. The odor was so strong it made my eyes water, and I had to breathe through my mouth to keep from gagging.

I watched Mrs. Wood's face from the side. Her eyes had rolled back so far that only the whites were visible, and the veins in her neck stood out like thick ropes. Her daughter, who couldn't have been more than sixteen, was making small clicking sounds with her tongue in rhythm with the humming.

That's when I noticed the footprints.

In the soft dirt of the Wood's flower bed, I could see dozens of footprints from previous months ‚Äì but they were wrong. They were too deep, pressed into the earth as if the people making them weighed far more than they should. 

I looked up at Mrs. Wood again, and this time I focused on her bare feet. Her toes were extended, clawing at the ground, and they seemed to be bulging and getting longer as I watched. 

Then I made the mistake of looking up at the moon.

The face was clearer now, more defined than it had been from our distant porch. I could see what looked like enormous eyes formed by the Sea of Tranquility and the Sea of Serenity, with the lunar highlands creating the impression of a broad forehead. The dark patches that formed the mouth seemed to be moving, opening and closing in rhythm with the townspeople's humming. 

Movement.

But worse than that, I was convinced it was looking directly at me. Those vast crater-eyes seemed to focus on my hiding spot behind the shed, and I felt a pressure in my skull, like something massive and alien trying to push its way into my thoughts.

The face in the moon tilted slightly, and I swear I could see what looked like a smile forming in the arrangement of shadows and ridges. A knowing, predatory smile that seemed to say: *I see you there, little watcher. Soon you'll join them.*

I'd seen enough. I crept back up the hill, my heart pounding so hard I was sure the whole town could hear it. Then I'd really be screwed for interrupting their fucked up ritual.

""We're leaving,"" I told Jordan as soon as I got back to the porch. ""We're packing tonight and we're gone by morning.""

But Jordan was staring down at the town with a strange expression on her face. ""Tony,"" she said softly, ""do you hear that?""

I stopped and listened. The humming was audible even from our house now, a low, thrumming vibration that seemed to come from everywhere at once. But there was something else ‚Äì a higher pitch, almost musical, weaving in and out of the deeper sound.

""It's beautiful,"" Jordan whispered.

I grabbed her shoulders and turned her to face me. Her pupils were dilated, and she was swaying slightly on her feet.

""Jordan, we need to go inside. Now.""

She blinked slowly, and for a moment, her eyes focused on mine. ""Yes,"" she said. ""Yes, you're right.""

We went inside and I closed all the curtains, turned on the TV loud enough to drown out the humming. Jordan seemed to snap out of whatever trance had been affecting her, but the experience left us both shaken.

We tried to leave the next morning. I loaded our belongings into the car while Jordan handled the last-minute details like canceling our utilities and dropping off the house key. But when I went to start the engine, nothing happened. The car was completely dead.

Mr. Jacob's from the general store happened to be walking by. ""Car trouble?"" he asked cheerfully.

""Won't start,"" I said. ""The engine won't even turn over.""

""Oh, that happens sometimes around here. Something about the elevation, or maybe the mineral content in the ground. Plays havoc with electronics. I'll call Matt's Garage for you.""

Matt couldn't get to us until the following week. His explanation was identical to Mr. Jacob's: something about the local environment affecting car batteries and electrical systems. He'd need to order parts.

We're still waiting for those parts.

It's been two weeks since our failed escape attempt, and I'm writing this during the day because I know what's coming tonight. It's almost time for the full moon again, and I can already feel something changing in the air. The humming starts earlier each month, so faint during the day that you might mistake it for tinnitus or distant machinery.

Jordan hears it too, but she doesn't seem bothered by it anymore. Yesterday, I caught her standing on our back porch, her head tilted slightly upward, her eyes closed and a peaceful expression on her face.

""Just listening to the music,"" she said when I asked what she was doing. ""And waiting for Him to show Himself again. Mariah says He's been especially clear lately.""

I don't hear any music. I only hear that terrible humming, growing louder as the sun sets. And I refuse to look at the moon anymore, not after seeing that malevolent intelligence staring back at me from its surface.

Tonight is the fourth full moon since we arrived in Roxboro Hollow. I've barricaded myself in our bedroom with the radio turned up loud and towels stuffed under the door. Jordan is somewhere else in the house. She said she wanted to ""get some fresh air"" about an hour ago.

I can hear footsteps on our front porch now, slow and deliberate. The humming is so loud it's making the windows vibrate. And underneath it all, I can hear Jordan's voice, calling my name.

But it doesn't sound like Jordan anymore. Her voice is too deep, too resonant, like it's coming from somewhere much larger than her throat.

""Tony,"" she calls. ""Come outside. You need to see this. You need to see what's up there.""

The footsteps are moving around the house now. I can track them as they circle from the front porch to the side yard, then around to the back. But there are too many of them. It sounds like a dozen people walking around our house, all in perfect synchronization.

""Tony, the stars are so beautiful tonight. Don't you want to see the stars?""

That's not Jordan's voice. I don't know whose voice it is, but it's coming from right outside my window.

The humming is getting louder. I can feel it in my bones now, vibrating through the floor and up into my chest. The radio isn't helping anymore ‚Äì the sound seems to be coming from inside my own head.

I think I understand now why no one in town wants to talk about the watching. It's not because they're embarrassed or secretive. It's because they don't remember it happening. Whatever takes them over during those nights, it leaves them afterward, and they go back to their normal lives with nothing but vague impressions and an agreed-upon story to tell curious newcomers.

But I remember. I remember everything I've seen, and I know that whatever's out there in the sky, whatever comes for them every month, it's not going to let me leave Roxboro Hollow. Not now that I know.

The footsteps have stopped. The humming is so loud now that I can't think straight. And Jordan, or the thing that sounds like Jordan, has stopped calling my name.

I can hear the front door opening.

If anyone finds this, don't come looking for us. Don't come to Roxboro Hollow. And whatever you do, don't look up at the stars when the moon is full.

She responded back with a vague response. Then July 2024, I asked her out again in chat and I told her that ""Hi [Her Name]! Remember when I invited you for coffee date last time? The offer still stands! Pray about it ""

She just read the message and did not reply back. Then I have the opportunity to have a clarity talk with her in person September 2024, if she is interested to go out for a coffee date or not. She told me that she is not interested

So we‚Äôve just seen a group of students walking out of the cafeteria, each one carrying a kitchen knife. We asked them what they were doing. When they turned to face us, we could see that their forearms were all caked with blood.

They told us that they‚Äôd found a way out through the basement. That there was a hidden tunnel in one of the walls that would take us outside. But that first they needed to get rid of the people blocking the way. They asked us if we wanted to join. That there was a lot of people down there and they could use the help.

Rachel asked them what these people looked like. They told us like statues. Large, pale, naked, stiff. But that they knew they weren‚Äôt statues because they screamed and bled and they could be killed. They asked us again if we wanted to join.

The most disturbing part was that they didn‚Äôt seem to be crazed or delusional. Their expressions were lucid, their voices earnest. Maybe they were telling the truth. But we still couldn‚Äôt do it.

We continued sitting there. We were starting to hear strange things. A muffled chanting coming from beneath us. Heavy footsteps from directly above us, as if several people had started running around in circles. One of the doors next to us suddenly opened but nobody came out. We got up and walked away from it.

We walked back into the library. But now we weren‚Äôt alone. We found some more students in there, three of them huddled tightly together near one of the desks. They glanced over at us as we walked in but then just as quickly looked away.

We sat down across them. Tried talking to them, asking how they were holding up. But they only gave us one-word answers before shrinking back into their group. They were whispering to each other with these huge smiles on their faces, clearly trying to hold back laughter. Every now and then they‚Äôd glance towards us and their laughter would go up a pitch, become more boisterous. Soon they were just openly cackling. Tears coming out of their eyes, fists pounding the table.

Finally we snapped and screamed at them, asked them what the fuck was supposed to be so funny.

It was like a switch had been flipped and they went silent, their expressions frozen in this hateful glare. One of them stared directly at me and asked if I remembered what happened during the camping trip in Colorado. I asked them what the fuck they were talking about.

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt remember the cabin?‚Äù the guy responded.

And that was enough for my brain to connect things. A rush of memories came flooding back. Memories that had been repressed for a reason.

Immediately I stood up and stormed out of the library. Behind me, I could hear them starting to laugh again. Rachel and Amira followed me out, asking me what that was about.

I told them that I now remembered where I‚Äôd seen that machine.

I‚Äôm not sure exactly how old I was. Maybe my early teens. We were on our annual family camping trip in the mountains. It was my parents, my brother Derek, and myself.

One night Derek and I were walking through the woods while our parents were preparing dinner. It was evening, the sky above a brilliant orange red as the sun prepared to set. We didn‚Äôt wander too far from the campsite. We knew the woods well, but not well enough. And we weren‚Äôt dumb.

Which is why we were surprised to find a cabin sitting in the middle of a clearing. We‚Äôd surveyed the area so thoroughly before settling on a place to pitch our tents that there‚Äôs almost no chance we wouldn‚Äôt have come across it in the process.

But there it was. What we found strange was how well-maintained it seemed to be. The wood had yet to start rotting, the paint was immaculate, and the windows were clean. There were even flowers growing out of several colorful pots placed around the entrance.

If it had looked like something out of a horror movie instead of some grandma‚Äôs retirement home, I‚Äôm sure we would‚Äôve ran back to our parents and told them about it. But instead we became curious. We took the bait.

We walked up to the door and prepared to knock on it, only to find that it was already slightly open. At that moment, I remember feeling a cool wind coming out from the crack. I didn‚Äôt like it. It frightened me. I told Derek that we should leave, but he waved me off and pushed the door open the rest of the way.

The interior of the place didn‚Äôt match what we‚Äôd seen outside. It was completely empty. I mean, it was just one large room. No doors, no stairs leading to a second floor despite there being a balcony above. Peeling walls, dust covering every surface, a heavy smell of mothballs. Everything about it was just a big fuck no.

The only thing inside was the machine. It was just sitting there, a few feet away from the entrance. About the size of a basketball.

Once again, I implored Derek to get the hell out of there. But he wasn‚Äôt listening. He seemed transfixed by the thing, his eyes glued to it as if it were the most fascinating thing in the world. It almost looked like he was in a trance or something. It freaked me the fuck out. I tried physically dragging him away but it was like his feet were glued to the floor. I had to shake him for well over a minute to finally snap him out of it. We went back to our campsite.

Remembering the next part fills me with guilt and regret. We never ended up telling our parents about the cabin. There had been nobody inside. So no danger, right?

We forgot about it and ate dinner and went to bed. I woke up in the middle of the night and saw that Derek was no longer in his sleeping bag. I looked around for him, eventually spotting him disappearing into the trees. I grabbed my flashlight and followed after him. But he was moving fast. I started sprinting, calling out to him and asking him where the hell he was going.

I chased him all the way towards the cabin but he had already gone inside by the time I‚Äôd reached the clearing. The door was wide open and there was a dim light emanating from inside. I slowed my pace. I really didn‚Äôt want to follow him inside but I continued to inch my way closer.

I was only a few feet away when a man appeared inside the doorway, nearly giving me a heart attack. He looked to be in his seventies, extremely tall, sickly thin. Thick, black veins bulging across his hands and arms. Wearing a tattered suit and baring this forced smile, his mouth filled with large, fake-looking teeth. He waved once at me before suddenly slamming the door shut.

I ran back to our campsite, told my parents what had happened. My dad grabbed his shotgun while my mom started packing everything up. I led him over to the clearing and he told me to go back and wait with my mom before storming up to the house and kicking down the door.

We waited for about fifteen minutes before he came back, carrying Derek in his arms. He continued carrying him as we hiked down the mountain in the darkness. I remember him looking over his shoulder every few seconds. Nobody said a word. Not even as we made it back to the parking lot and got inside our car and began driving away. I tried talking to Derek, but he was unresponsive, completely out of it. His eyes were glazed over in a way that terrified me. Of course my mom and I both pleaded my dad for answers. But he didn‚Äôt offer one. He stayed completely silent until we made it back home.

He dropped my mom and I off before telling us that he was taking Derek to the hospital. He didn‚Äôt explain what for.

Derek never came back home. He stayed in the hospital for a few months until he was transferred to a different facility, put under the care of ‚Äúspecialists‚Äù, as I‚Äôd been told. I didn‚Äôt know what it meant back then and I still have no idea.

I never saw my brother again. My dad never explained what he saw in that cabin. As you can guess, it kind of drove me mad over the years. I wanted answers so bad, to the point where I‚Äôd tried going back up to the mountains myself several years later. I never found that cabin again. And when my dad found out what I‚Äôd done, he sent me to a psychiatrist name John. I think he was a psychiatrist. I don‚Äôt really remember his title. But I guess he did a great job because I ended just repressing the entire thing, replacing it with a false sequence of memories.

My brother had fallen severely ill shortly after our trip. He never recovered from it. This is the story my brain had run with all these years.

And quite frankly, I think I was better off for it. This was a horrible fucking thing to suddenly remember.

I guess I must‚Äôve looked pretty mortified because Rachel came over, tried to comfort me. Telling me the same things that John had. How it wasn‚Äôt my fault. How there‚Äôs nothing I could‚Äôve done. I didn‚Äôt believe John then and I didn‚Äôt believe Rachel now.

But I still appreciated the effort. The past was the past. Effort was wasted dwelling on it.

Amira, on the other hand, hadn‚Äôt said anything. She was just staring at me with this confused expression. After a while she asked me something.

‚ÄúAre you sure that happened?‚Äù

I asked her why she was asking me that.

‚ÄúBecause we‚Äôre in hell,‚Äù she responded. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôd want you to think that. They‚Äôd want you to think every horrible thing imaginable.‚Äù

Rachel rolled her eyes, asked her to quit it.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not true. It‚Äôs not productive,‚Äù she explained. ‚ÄúJust stop.‚Äù

‚ÄúI was never at that beach,‚Äù Amira continued, ignoring her. ‚ÄúThere was no man. I had no cousin. None of it happened.‚Äù

I asked her why she had suddenly changed her mind. Because earlier she had seemed so convinced that this was something that had actually happened to her.

‚ÄúBecause the devil‚Äôs here,‚Äù she responded.

Rachel asked her if that was supposed to be a metaphor or something.

‚ÄúNo. The devil‚Äôs here right now. I can see him.‚Äù

She pointed to somewhere behind us.

Rachel and I turned around. We couldn‚Äôt see anything at first. It was just a dark hallway. But then our eyes adjusted, and we could discern a head peaking out from one of the open lockers.

I asked Amira how she knew that was the devil. She said that it spoke to her. But not through words. That it was trying to taunt her. Trying to drive fear into her heart.

‚ÄúIf that‚Äôs the devil, then why are you smiling?‚Äù Rachel asked. ‚ÄúShouldn‚Äôt we get the fuck away from him?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe won‚Äôt escape him. But we don‚Äôt have to be scared of him either. Because that‚Äôs what he wants.‚Äù

Her smile grew wider. ‚ÄúJust don‚Äôt give him what he wants. And we‚Äôll be fine.‚Äù

Rachel shook her head. ‚ÄúWhat the fuck are you talking about?‚Äù

She grabbed Amira‚Äôs hand, tried to pull her away from the hallway. But she wouldn‚Äôt budge.

Suddenly all the locker doors swung open at once. We froze, stared into the dark.

‚ÄúPlease,‚Äù Rachel whispered, now a quiver in her voice. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt do this. Let‚Äôs go.‚Äù

Amira kept smiling. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not afraid.‚Äù

Rachel shook her head, looked at me.

‚ÄúRun,‚Äù she said. So we did.

We didn‚Äôt hear any footsteps behind us but we could hear Amira continuing to shout at the top of her lungs for the devil to come get her. That she wasn‚Äôt afraid. It lasted only a few seconds before she went quiet.

We didn‚Äôt really know where to go and nowhere felt particularly safe. There was another library on the second floor but we‚Äôd have to move past the bridge to get to it. So we avoided that. We decided head towards the food court, which was also on the second floor, but all the way on the other end.

The closer we got to it, the more we could smell something like burning meat in the air. Something getting exponentially stronger with every step we took. Soon the air had become dark with rancid smoke. We pulled our shirts up over our noses and peeked out from around the corner leading into the court.

We could see five or six of our fellow students sitting in a circle in front of the Subway. Laid in between them was what looked like a charred, burning corpse. They were just staring at it, sitting close enough to the flames that they should‚Äôve been suffocated by it.

The students were rocking slowly back and forth, heads titled slightly to the ceiling. They were making these weird, twitching motions with their hands. Their fingers were all horrifically bent and twisted.

Then we blinked and the fire disappeared. No water dumped on it, nothing to suffocate it.

It was just gone. In an instant. Inexplicably deleted from the universe. The students stopped moving and we stood there in pin-drop silence until the burnt, smoking figure sat up on its own. And that‚Äôs when we realized how big it was, its shoulders rising well past their heads.

We turned around, backed away as silently as we could.

Currently we‚Äôre taking refuge in some random classroom. It seems safe in here.

But with everything else that‚Äôs happened, who knows when that‚Äôll change. We can‚Äôt stay here forever. We need to figure something out.

**UPDATE 3:**

We decided to go up to the third floor. Not sure what we were hoping to find, but where else could we go?

The third floor consisted mostly of smaller classrooms, an administrative office, a small student pub tucked away in one of the corners. We headed for the pub, breathing simultaneous sighs of relief once we found it empty.

I sat at the bar while Rachel went behind it and began pouring up two rum and cokes. Both with more rum than coke.

She sat next to me, finished the drink in one gulp and then buried her face in her hands. She asked me if I thought Amira was right. If we really were in hell.

I sipped my drink and told her that I didn‚Äôt. But that I also didn‚Äôt have an explanation for what this could‚Äôve been if not hell. That I couldn‚Äôt even really believe it was happening. That it all felt so surreal. That I wasn‚Äôt fully convinced that this wasn‚Äôt a dream.

Rachel said that this couldn‚Äôt have been a dream. So I asked her what she thought this was.

After some thinking, she said that maybe all of us had just gotten extremely unlucky, marked to suffer at the hands of some unknowable cosmic force for reasons we were never meant to understand.

I nodded, made myself another drink. She looked at me.

‚ÄúDo you think we still have a chance of getting out of here?‚Äù she asked.

I told her that even if I didn‚Äôt, I wouldn‚Äôt have admitted it. That it was better to be optimistically delusional than to give up.

She smiled and said that she liked that answer. And that I better not go insane on her or else she‚Äôll kill me.

I told her likewise and we grabbed some knives from the cabinet behind the bar and then ventured back out.

As we were walking, Rachel asked me if it seemed darker now. I considered this carefully. It was just barely noticeable, but I could tell that it was. And in a strange way. It wasn‚Äôt as if the lights themselves had dimmed. More so that it was being smothered by something. The air just seemed thicker, heavier. Weighed down by some intangible element.

We discovered the source of it when we walked over to the atrium and looked down over the railings at the lower floors. At first, it was hard to understand what we were seeing.

It looked like the first floor had been completely submerged by a void. Just a blanket of sheer gloom extending nearly halfway up to the second floor. Thick dark spirals drifted up from it like smoke, gradually spreading through the air. But unlike smoke, it felt cold.

Slowly it was becoming harder to breath, the air growing saturated by this inscrutable stench. Something sharp, pungent, metallic. As if an old medicine cabinet had been doused with blood and then lit on fire.

We then noticed that it was rising. Getting closer to us. Not just the smoke, but the actual darkness itself. As if it were being pumped in from somewhere. It wasn‚Äôt moving fast. But eventually it would reach us.

We backed away from the railing and then stared at each other as if the other person might have an answer. Which of course neither of us did. The panic hits much harder when time becomes your enemy. When the threat is so ominous but still yet to be defined.

What would happen when it reached us? We were determined not to find out.

We took some deep breaths and then settled on a purely logical approach. The darkness was moving up towards us. So how could we escape it?

‚ÄúBy moving up ourselves,‚Äù Rachel said.

I was about to ask her how until I realized where she was going with this.

The maintenance room. The hatch. The dirt.

Theoretically, it could be a way out. Maybe the only way out. I just didn‚Äôt like it. I wasn‚Äôt a fan.

She asked if I had any other suggestions. I told her that I didn‚Äôt. I tried to come up with something but my brain was firing blanks. I looked back over the railing. The darkness was still climbing. Getting closer.

And now I could see something poking up from it.

It was a gigantic head connected to a thick, dark, slimy stalk which was connected to God knows what. It hovered in place for a while before turning up to look at us. It was Jason‚Äôs head bloated up to about ten times the size it should‚Äôve been. His skin had become a painful-looking dark purple, his eyes bloodshot and nearly bulging out of their sockets. His mouth was hanging open, his jaw slack to the point of appearing dislocated. He released this loud and awful croaking noise. Something so inhuman that mere exposure to it induced a type of dread I had never felt before.

There was something inside his mouth. It looked a pale spider with the head of a wrinkled old man. It was just crawling around on his tongue. Sporadically looking up and grinning.

Suddenly the idea of crawling through dirt didn‚Äôt seem so bad.

I backed away and told Rachel that we needed to get to the maintenance room ASAP. I must‚Äôve looked pretty terrified because she asked me what I‚Äôd seen down there. I told her that she didn‚Äôt want to know. That feeding her curiosity wasn‚Äôt worth it.

She decided to look anyway. Seconds later, we were both running.

The maintenance room was all the way on the other end of the building. But if we moved fast, we could get there in just a few minutes.

Problem was, we couldn‚Äôt move very fast. The air had become so thick that we nearly drowning in it. We had to inhale several large mouthfuls just to get enough oxygen to move forward a few steps. And that was another problem. The air itself was so exceedingly bitter that it was burning our throats and nostrils. The smoke was so heavy that it was hard to keep our eyes open for more than a few seconds before they started stinging like hell. And if all that wasn‚Äôt enough, the light had been reduced to a fraction of its original brightness. It was hard to tell where we were going at all.

But desperation‚Äôs a pretty powerful force. We were convinced that all we needed to do was reach the maintenance room and we‚Äôd be free from this nightmare. And we didn‚Äôt need to rationalize it. The fear of turning into one of those grotesque, bloated heads was visceral enough to drive us ahead.

Of course it wasn‚Äôt easy. In fact, I never thought something could be so excruciating.

When I fell to my knees with a sharp stinging in my chest, Rachel helped me up. And when it happened to her, I did the same.

Before we cleared the atrium, I took one last look over the railings to find that Jason‚Äôs head had been joined by about a dozen more. All vaguely familiar faces that had been swollen and mutated into some horrendous version of the people they once were.

Now the darkness had reached the second floor.

By the time that we rounded the corner leading to the maintenance room, we were too compromised to stand, unable to do much more than crawl. Still, we pulled ourselves forward, our lungs aching and eyes burning. We could just barely see the outline of the door and we were so, so close.

And then we could see nothing at all. Not that it mattered because we could no longer open our eyes without it feeling like they were being pierced by several hundred needles at once. Now every breath we tried to take seemed to get stuck in our throats. As if the air had turned into concrete. We were forced to hold it.

We couldn‚Äôt have been more than a few feet away so we just kept crawling, feeling along the wall until we found the door. As we searched for the handle, we could hear that croaking noise echoing off the walls. Much louder now. Like several voices in unison. Ones that sounded dangerously close.

My head was flooded with images of those bloated heads floating towards us with their mouths wide open, the spider creatures ready to jump out at us and do who the fuck knows what.

But we managed to open the door before any of them could reach us. Once we were in, we wasted no time slamming it shut. It was pitch black inside. But now we could breath. Now we could actually open our eyes. I took out my phone and turned the flashlight on, half-expecting to find some monstrosity staring us down in the darkness.

But there was nothing. We were alone.

We gave ourselves a breather before looking for the light switch and then flipping it on. There were still traces of the smoke floating around from when we‚Äôd opened the door, but not enough for it to be suffocating. It was safe in here. For the time being.

We could still hear the croaking through the walls, still getting louder, as if those things knew exactly where we were and had honed in on us.

We barricaded the door with whatever miscellaneous shit we could find. A desk, some chairs, some buckets. I‚Äôm not sure why we were convinced it would help but I guess it provided a modicum of comfort.¬†

We both took a deep breath and then opened up the hatch. Some clumps of dirt fell through.

Now the croaking had turned into a roar. Sounded like it was right outside the door. There a was loud bang and the room shook. One of the walls cracked.

We looked at each other. Last chance to back out. But where the hell would we go?

We climbed up the ladder and into the dirt.

Never in my life had I imagined what crawling through sheer dirt might feel like. But it‚Äôs hard to understate just how miserable of an experience it was.

The weight of the Earth crushing you from every angle, cold damp soil clinging to your skin, hair, soaking into your clothes. Catching mouthfuls of soil as you struggle desperately to climb upwards, every inch demanding almost every ounce of strength you have to offer.

And the entire time, we could still hear the croaking from below, feeling the rhythmic force of something pounding up against the ceiling. Like a drumbeat through the dirt.

At some point, it sounded like something had managed to tear the ceiling apart. We just kept climbing. I lost track of exactly where Rachel was but I could hear her struggling somewhere close by. I‚Äôm not sure how long we crawled for. It may only have been a few minutes but it also could‚Äôve been an hour. My arms had never felt so heavy. I had never felt so much strain on my lungs. The stench and taste of metal, minerals and Earth was so overwhelming that I was forced to swallow back puke. Sometimes I‚Äôd feel something biting my skin and I‚Äôd thrash my limbs until it stopped.

But as bad as it got, I never stopped. It wasn‚Äôt an option. I‚Äôd die from exhaustion before accepting whatever fate awaited us below.

It was like ecstasy when I finally saw light. The smell of fresh air was sweet, warm enough to feel like a nice, dry blanket against my cold, wet skin. I pulled the rest of my body up to the surface just as my muscles surrendered for good. I flopped onto the ground, catching my breath, savoring the relief.

After a while, I found the energy to sit up. I was in a forest. A strange one. The trees were like skyscrapers - extremely thick trunks, extremely tall, standing to the sky. The branches were all a zig-zag shape, interlacing with each other to form a bizarre but kind of beautiful pattern above. The plants around me were odd but stunning at the same time. Gigantic mushrooms that pulsed with neon light, colorful bushes with gelatinous orbs stuck into them, flowers over six feet tall with tentacle-like protrusions that moved with the breeze. All around me were alien noises coming from hidden creatures. I got the sense that they all they were aware of my presence. They just didn‚Äôt want to be seen.

But the place didn‚Äôt feel dangerous. If anything, it was peaceful.

I was too busy being blown away by it all that I‚Äôd forgotten about Rachel. She still hadn‚Äôt made it up. I considered that maybe she‚Äôd become disoriented, started crawling in the wrong direction. I tried calling out to her. When I got no response, I began to dig back down.

But I didn‚Äôt need to go far. Soon her head popped up from the dirt. Her face was covered by mud and the few areas where it wasn‚Äôt, I could see that her skin had become beet red. She was coughing, gagging, violently. I crawled over, helped pull her out the rest of the way

She knelt down and violently dry heaved before puking up a mouthful of dirt and vomit. She wiped the dirt away from her face as she gasped for air. I could see tears rolling down her cheeks.

Happy tears. She was smiling.

But we didn‚Äôt linger. There was no guarantee that those things wouldn‚Äôt eventually follow us up. As soon as we‚Äôd recovered enough strength, we chose a direction at random and began walking. The soft dirt floor soon gave way to firmer grass. After a while, we found a manmade path. There was a tree in front of it with what looked a large, red arrow spraypainted across the trunk. Pointing left.

We debated with each other about whether or not to follow it. Rachel argued that it could‚Äôve been a trap. I argued that it was a breadcrumb left by somebody who had been in a similar position to ourselves.

We argued for a long time, switching positions every so often until we ultimately decided that our best option was to just follow it.

It turned out to be a good decision.

It first led us to a creek with water so unadulterated, so crystal clear that we almost felt bad about using it to wash the dirt from our skin and clothes. There was another message spray-painted into the grass in front of it.

*DRINKABLE*

The water was cold, smooth going down our throats. It tasted vaguely like honey.

Then we continued on the path.

Whenever it forked into multiple paths, there was always an arrow painted somewhere to guide us.

As we walked, we encountered various different creatures. All of them bore some degree of resemblance to animals and insects we‚Äôd seen before. But not fully. Their colors were brighter, their skin and fur far more luminous, their anatomy more beautifully intricate than anything we were familiar with. A stark contrast from whatever hell we‚Äôd just escaped.

We counted twenty-two arrows before we were finally arrived at a small cabin in a clearing.

I suppose the best way to describe it was rustic. A simple structure, somewhat haphazard in appearance. But strangely inviting at the same time.

We walked up to the front door, still somewhat wary about entering. We looked at each other, came to a silent agreement. That we may as well. That we‚Äôve already come so far.

We knocked. When nobody answered, we tried the handle.

Inside it smelled like wood, coffee, cigarettes. The place was barebones save for a small desk. There was somebody sitting up in the chair behind it, sleeping with his face pointed to the ceiling and his mouth wide open. A young man with messy blonde hair wearing a jacket and jeans. A rifle was laid across his lap, one of his fingers still firm on the trigger. One of his hands was bandaged up. On the desk was a collection of paper, pens, notebooks, knives, boxes of ammunition, a steaming cup.

We didn‚Äôt immediately try and wake him up at the risk of startling the guy and having him pump us full of lead. But we didn‚Äôt have to. Soon an alarm clock went off and he jolted awake. When he saw us, he shrieked, began fumbling around with the rifle for long enough that we could‚Äôve ran over and snatched it away if we really wanted to.

But we didn‚Äôt. Once he‚Äôd gotten it steady in his hands, he stood up and pointed it at us.

We put our hands up. He just stared at us for a while before lowering it, letting out a sigh of relief.

‚ÄúThank God,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, it‚Äôs just that nobody‚Äôs come through for a long fucking time. I wasn‚Äôt expecting it.‚Äù

Then he smiled.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad to see you,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI mean, I‚Äôm not glad that you‚Äôre here. But it just gets so lonely sometimes. Nice to talk to somebody.‚Äù

We asked him where the hell we were. He shook his head, took a long exhale.

‚ÄúI‚Äôd be lying if I told you that I understood any of this,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôll fill you in on what I can. Just be prepared to listen. It‚Äôll take a while.‚Äù

He walked over to a counter at the back of the room upon which sat a pot of steaming black liquid. He poured out two cups of it and then walked back over, handed one to each of us.

‚ÄúBlack coffee with honey and pure grain alcohol,‚Äù he told us, before sitting back down.

‚ÄúSo first thing‚Äôs first. I gotta know. Where were you guys?‚Äù

We asked him what he meant.

‚ÄúI mean, where were you when became trapped? Where all the crazy shit started? I was in a parking garage. Getting ready to leave work.‚Äù

We told him that we were in a university, which seemed to disappoint him. He said that was boring. That somebody named Hanson had been in an abandoned insane asylum on a remote arctic island. A journalist trying to uncover evidence of clandestine government experiments. To imagine what kind of shit he went through.

We asked him who Hanson was. He reached into his pocket and pulled out an ancient-looking carton of cigarettes. He struck a match, lit one of them, took a few drags before answering.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a survivor. We all are. And now so are you two.""",5,1756264079.0,u_Mr_Outlaw_,1,0.86,False

1n16157,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1n16157/the_realtor/,The realtor .,"Martin Crowe never thought of himself as evil. Not in the same way his clients were, at least. He was a businessman. He wore a sharp gray suit, drove a Lexus, and kept his smile as polished as the black leather shoes on his feet. He sold homes. That was all. It was his job to match people with properties that suited their ‚Äúlifestyle,‚Äù as he liked to call it. Some people needed extra space for a nursery, others wanted a backyard pool, and still others wanted reinforced basements with soundproof insulation so their screams wouldn‚Äôt carry.

Martin‚Äôs business card didn‚Äôt say any of that, of course. Crowe Realty ‚Äì Finding Homes for Every Dream. His office was in an ordinary plaza sandwiched between a dentist‚Äôs office and a pet grooming shop. His website was bland, filled with stock images of happy families standing in front of suburban homes. To the average person, he was no different than any other hungry shark of a realtor trying to chew their piece of the market.

But Martin had a gift, or maybe a curse. He could see things about people, things they didn‚Äôt say out loud. Something in their eyes, in the way their voices quivered or flattened. He could smell hunger. He could recognize the kind of client who wasn‚Äôt looking for square footage or good school districts. He knew how to spot the itch in a man‚Äôs stare as he glanced at a garage‚Äîalready imagining what it would look like with plastic tarps and bone saws. He knew how to pick up on the way a woman ran her hand over a basement wall, gently as if petting it, calculating whether the concrete would absorb blood.

And when he found those clients, he knew exactly what homes to show them.

Martin‚Äôs first time wasn‚Äôt intentional. At least, not consciously. He had shown a fixer-upper to a tall, skeletal man who called himself ‚ÄúMr. Dean.‚Äù The man had been quiet, but his questions weren‚Äôt about renovations or plumbing. No, he asked how far away the neighbors were, how thick the basement walls were, how secluded the backyard felt at night. Martin didn‚Äôt ask why. He just answered, charmed him, and sold the property. Six months later, Martin recognized the same house on the evening news. The police had discovered six bodies buried in the garden, their faces gnawed by rats.

That night, Martin drank half a bottle of scotch. He told himself it was a coincidence. He told himself there was no way to know. But in the morning, when the news showed Dean‚Äôs face, Martin remembered the way the man‚Äôs lips had twitched with restrained hunger. He had known. Deep down, he had known all along.

Instead of guilt, something else crept into Martin. Something cold and electric. He liked it.

From then on, he sharpened his instinct. He watched. He listened. And when those special clients came along, he leaned in. He found them properties suited for their‚Ä¶ extracurricular activities. He built a secret reputation through whispers, through handshakes in smoky bars, through coded emails from untraceable addresses. Martin Crowe became the realtor of choice for America‚Äôs monsters.

Tonight, he was showing a house to a new client.

The property was a sprawling farmhouse thirty minutes outside the city, isolated by dead cornfields. The wood siding was chipped, the roof sagged, but Martin knew it was perfect. ‚ÄúPrivacy‚Äù was its greatest feature. Privacy and the cavernous root cellar beneath the floorboards.

The client arrived in a black van, paint peeling, one headlight dim. He stepped out, heavy boots crunching gravel. His body was thick and slouched, his beard greasy and matted. He smelled faintly of copper and rot, like a butcher‚Äôs apron. He introduced himself as ‚ÄúDarryl.‚Äù No last name.

Martin smiled his wide, professional smile. ‚ÄúMr. Darryl, you‚Äôre going to love this one.‚Äù

They walked through the creaking farmhouse. Darryl‚Äôs eyes gleamed when he saw the cellar, a long stairway descending into blackness. He crouched, running a finger along the damp wall, sniffing it. His nostrils flared. ‚ÄúGood bones,‚Äù he muttered.

‚ÄúExcellent insulation,‚Äù Martin replied smoothly. ‚ÄúNo sound escapes. The cellar extends under the kitchen, so you‚Äôve got plenty of room for storage. Or‚Ä¶ whatever else you need.‚Äù

Darryl looked up at him, grin splitting his cracked lips. Martin met the grin with perfect composure, though inside, his stomach squirmed. Every one of these clients disturbed him in their own unique way, but he never showed fear. Fear ruined sales.

When the tour ended, Darryl clapped his hand on Martin‚Äôs shoulder. ‚ÄúI like you,‚Äù he said. His hand was clammy, nails cracked and yellowed. ‚ÄúYou get it. Most people don‚Äôt. But you? You know what a man like me needs.‚Äù

‚ÄúI make it my business to understand,‚Äù Martin replied.

The sale went through easily. Darryl paid cash. Martin transferred the deed, collected his commission, and went home with the faint, buzzing thrill in his chest that always followed a successful deal.

That night, though, he dreamed. He dreamed of screams bleeding through the farmhouse walls, muffled but frantic. He dreamed of chains dragging on the cellar floor. He woke up sweating, heart racing, the phantom taste of blood in his mouth.

The dreams kept coming. Each time he sold another home, they grew worse. He saw women crawling through fields, children clawing at locked doors, men begging for air in dark cellars. It wasn‚Äôt guilt, not exactly. It was more like the homes themselves whispered to him, bleeding their horrors into his subconscious.

But Martin didn‚Äôt stop. He couldn‚Äôt. The money was too good, and the thrill too intoxicating.

One afternoon, a woman came to his office. She was different. Most of his clients looked like predators in plain sight‚Äîawkward, strange, greasy. But she was beautiful. Tall, immaculate, with a sleek black dress and blood-red lipstick. She introduced herself as ‚ÄúMs. Holloway.‚Äù Her voice was smooth, her handshake firm.

‚ÄúI need a house,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúSomething secluded. With history. The kind of place that remembers what people do inside of it.‚Äù

Martin‚Äôs mouth went dry. He recognized something in her eyes. Not hunger, but something deeper. Something colder.

‚ÄúI have just the place,‚Äù he said.

He showed her a Victorian on the outskirts of town, a crumbling thing with rotting banisters and a backyard choked by weeds. It had been empty for decades, its last owners murdered in the master bedroom.

Ms. Holloway walked through the house like she‚Äôd been there before. She caressed the walls, inhaled the musty air, smiled when she stepped into the stained bedroom.

‚ÄúThis house has‚Ä¶ resonance,‚Äù she whispered. ‚ÄúYes. This will do.‚Äù

She paid on the spot. No questions.

After that, Martin‚Äôs dreams grew unbearable. He dreamed of the Victorian‚Äôs walls stretching, bloating with faces that pressed through the wallpaper, mouths opening in silent screams. He dreamed of Ms. Holloway, her dress soaked in blood, her lipstick smeared into a grin too wide for her face.

Then the disappearances started. People went missing in clusters. Entire families. The news whispered about cults, about hidden killers. But Martin knew. Ms. Holloway‚Äôs house was feeding.

Martin began to unravel. His suits grew wrinkled. His hair thinned. He drank more. He heard things‚Äîsnapping twigs outside his window, footsteps in his hallway at night. He found dark stains in his sink that hadn‚Äôt been there before.

One night, he woke to find his front door wide open. The air inside smelled of copper. On his coffee table lay one of his business cards. Written across it, in what looked like dried blood, were the words: You sell. We feast.

Martin couldn‚Äôt stop shaking. He tried to tell himself he was imagining it, but the next morning he found claw marks on his bedroom wall.

When the police finally raided Darryl‚Äôs farmhouse, they found bones stacked like firewood in the cellar. When they entered Ms. Holloway‚Äôs Victorian, they found nothing‚Äîjust a house that felt alive, that made officers vomit from the stench of rot even though there were no bodies inside.

Martin knew it was only a matter of time before someone traced it all back to him. But he couldn‚Äôt stop. Even now, he had new clients lined up. They always found him.

And sometimes, late at night, when he was alone in his silent house, Martin swore he heard knocking beneath his floorboards. Soft, rhythmic. As if something wanted out.

Or in.

I (26F) took a trip this weekend and I just got home. I was visiting a friend and she introduced me to some of her friends, in the group there was this guy (28M) who is totally my type.

I feel like I‚Äôve always been so scared of going out with guys who are my type because I feel like they are out of my league. And this is a resolve I have, to stop dating men who are just not my type because this isn‚Äôt emotional charity. But with this guy, we hit it off. He is a musician, so am I, he has impeccable taste in fashion, has tattoos, coffee lover, good looking, very kind and peaceful vibe. He is great. My friend was like‚Ä¶ ""you guys hit it off immediately, that‚Äôs great"" 

He followed me on IG and we immediately started texting, he recommended sushi places to try and asked when I was leaving town, I thought he was going to ask me out, but he didn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs totally fine. 

But he is great at conversation, he asks a lot about me, he is fun, effortlessly cool and very nice. But‚Ä¶ he is a super slow texter. 

I don‚Äôt want to overthink, we live in different states and it‚Äôs not like I am in love with him, but I am definitely interested. I just want to know if maybe he is just not interested in me and I should probably just let it fade away.  My friend who introduced us tells me he is just the type to simply not reply if he doesn‚Äôt feel like it, for example, she sent him something like 4 days ago and he hasn‚Äôt even opened the message, meanwhile he replies to me, even if it takes literally HOURS. 

He sends me long texts, he seems very engaged. Should I just let it run its course? 

I am aware that maybe he is just not as online as me, I am very active on social media and I am a great texter even when I am super super busy. But I know not everyone is like that and I truly don‚Äôt want to seem intense. 

So‚Ä¶ what do y‚Äôall think? Uninterested or bad texter?

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Belinda Bencic vs. Ann Li: A Tale of Tennis, Motherhood, and Unlikely Aces**

Belinda Bencic, the 16th seed and a woman who‚Äôs apparently mastered the art of balancing motherhood with Grand Slam tennis, returns to the US Open with the poise of a Swiss watch and the serve of a woman who‚Äôs had nine months to perfect her backhand while sipping organic kale smoothies. Her opponent, Ann Li, arrives with the underdog charm of a Netflix trivia show contestant‚Äîunranked 58th but armed with 10 aces in her first-round victory and a resume that includes ‚Äúrunner-up in Singapore‚Äù and ‚Äúsomeone who isn‚Äôt Ann Li but also isn‚Äôt the answer to this crossword clue.‚Äù

**The Odds: Because Math Hates Surprises**  
Let‚Äôs crunch the numbers like Bencic crunches her pre-match protein bars. The betting lines paint Bencic as a near-75% favorite (decimal odds \~1.34), while Li sits at +240 (implied \~33% chance). To put that in perspective, Bencic‚Äôs odds are about as surprising as a sunrise; Li‚Äôs are like betting your coffee order will include a *decaf* latte in a city that runs on espresso. The spread (-3.5 sets) suggests Bencic could breeze through this like a tennis-playing breeze through a paper towel factory.

**The News: Motherhood, Aces, and the Art of Not Tripping**  
Bencic‚Äôs story is the emotional equivalent of a Netflix limited series: she exited Wimbledon for maternity leave, won a title in Abu Dhabi upon her return, and then casually dispatched Zhang Shuai 6-3, 6-3 in her US Open opener. She‚Äôs the tennis version of a superhero mom‚Äîsaving the world (i.e., the tournament) while still nursing a baby.

Li, meanwhile, is the plot twist nobody saw coming. Her first-round win over Rebecca Sramkova included 10 aces and a 59% first-serve win rate, which is impressive until you realize her career high for a match is‚Ä¶ well, l

Ladies and gentlemen, gather ‚Äòround for a tennis tango between **Emma Navarro** (the human equivalent of a ‚Äúset it and forget it‚Äù coffee maker) and **Caty McNally** (a player who‚Äôs mastered the art of ‚Äúsometimes it works, sometimes it doesn‚Äôt‚Äù). This second-round US Open clash isn‚Äôt just a battle of rackets‚Äîit‚Äôs a showdown between consistency and chaos, with Navarro holding the statistical upper hand like a tennis-themed chess grandmaster.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Why Navarro‚Äôs Implied Probability is Less of a Gamble Than a Guarantee

The books are screaming **Emma Navarro -155**, which translates to a **60.78% implied probability** of victory. For context, that‚Äôs about the same chance of your average fan correctly predicting the weather in New York in August‚Äîlow, but not impossible if you‚Äôve got a crystal ball. Navarro‚Äôs recent form is a masterclass in reliability: semifinalist at the 2024 US Open, quarterfinalist at the 2025 Australian Open, and a Wimbledon fourth-round appearance. She‚Äôs the tennis version of a Tesla on Autopilot‚Äîsmooth, efficient, and unlikely to crash.

McNally, meanwhile, is priced at **+225**, implying a **30.8% chance** (per decimal odds). That‚Äôs roughly the probability of flipping a coin and it landing on its edge *twice in a row*. Her resume includes a single major third-round appearance (2020 US Open) and a first-round exit here in 2024. If Navarro is a five-star Michelin chef, McNally‚Äôs more of a ‚Äúhope it doesn‚Äôt catch fire‚Äù home cook.

The spread (-2.5 games for Navarro) and total games line (21.5) suggest this could be a straight-set affair. If you‚Äôre betting on drama, look elsewhere.

---

### News Digest: Injuries, Form, and Why McNally‚Äôs Resume Needs a Makeover

Navarro‚Äôs first-round win over Wang Yafan was a clinic in composure‚Äîa **7-6 (11-9), 6-3** grind that proved she‚Äôs built for the mental marathon of New York. She‚Äôs also coming off a Wimbledon run where she looked like a player with nothing to prove and everything to gain. No injuries, no drama, just a woman in a white tank top who seems perpetua

*By Your Friendly Neighborhood Sportswriter Who Still Can‚Äôt Serve a Proper Forehand*

---

### Parse the Odds: The Math Doesn‚Äôt Lie (Much)

Let‚Äôs cut to the chase: **Emma Raducanu is the favorite**, and the numbers aren‚Äôt just suggesting it‚Äîthey‚Äôre yelling it. Across bookmakers, her implied probability ranges from **76.9% to 78.7%** (decimal odds of 1.27‚Äì1.30), while Janice Tjen‚Äôs sits at a humble **26.6% to 28.6%** (odds of 3.5‚Äì3.75). To put this in perspective, betting on Tjen is like betting your coffee order will survive a barista‚Äôs interpretation of ‚Äúmedium sweet.‚Äù It‚Äôs a long shot, but hey, someone‚Äôs got to keep the dream alive.

The spread (-4.5) and total (20.5 games) further underscore Raducanu‚Äôs dominance. Bookmakers expect her to win comfortably, though ‚Äúcomfortably‚Äù in tennis often means sweating out a third set. Still, the math is clear: This isn‚Äôt a toss-up. It‚Äôs more like a **served ace vs. a double fault**.

---

### Digest the News: Injuries, Inspirations, and a Sociology Degree

Raducanu comes in riding a **11-match winning streak** and a post-college-coaching glow-up with Francisco Roig. The new coach? A ‚Äúcalm, chatty, and supportive‚Äù guru who‚Äôs helping her ditch perfectionism. (Translation: He tells her it‚Äôs okay if her backhand isn‚Äôt flawless‚Ä¶ yet.) Raducanu‚Äôs recent form? A **6-1, 6-2 demolition** of Ena Shibahara, a performance so clinical it made her say, ‚ÄúI feel in control.‚Äù If tennis had a ‚ÄúZen Master‚Äù award, she‚Äôd be a contender.

Then there‚Äôs **Janice Tjen**, the Indonesian qualifier who‚Äôs made history by becoming the first player from her country to win a Grand Slam match in 22 years. She‚Äôs also a former University of Oregon sociology student who‚Äôs now a **13-time ITF titlist**. Her journey? A rags-to-(almost)-riches story: From college injuries to graduating with a degree in ‚Äúhow people think,‚Äù she‚Äôs now serving aces on the US Open stage. She even cites **Ash Barty** and **Emma Raducanu** as role models‚Äîmeaning she‚Äôs both inspired by and about to get schooled by her idol.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Carlos Alcaraz vs. Mattia Bellucci: A Foregone Conclusion with a Side of Absurdity**

Ladies, gentlemen, and sentient tennis balls, prepare for a match that‚Äôs as lopsided as a wobbly Jell-O mold. Carlos Alcaraz, the 19-year-old ATP titan with a shaved head sharper than his backhand, faces Mattia Bellucci, a 65th-ranked Italian who‚Äôs about to learn why ‚Äúwalkover‚Äù is a term reserved for pigeons, not Grand Slam upsets. Let‚Äôs break this down with the statistical rigor of a linesman and the humor of a comedian trapped in a stadium.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Why This Isn‚Äôt a Pick‚Äôem

The bookmakers have spoken, and they‚Äôve done so with the enthusiasm of a tax auditor: **Carlos Alcaraz is a +102 to +103 favorite** (decimal: 1.02‚Äì1.03). Translating that into implied probability? **\~97‚Äì98% chance of victory**. For context, that‚Äôs the same confidence level the average person has that their morning coffee won‚Äôt spill. Bellucci, meanwhile, is priced at **+12 to +19**, implying a **\~7‚Äì8% chance**. If you‚Äôre betting on Bellucci, you‚Äôre essentially wagering that Alcaraz will suddenly develop a fear of the letter ‚ÄúA‚Äù (as in *Ace*, *Aggression*, and *Alcaraz‚Äôs Unstoppable Dominance*).

The spread? Alcaraz is -8.5 games. Even if Bellucci played every point perfectly, he‚Äôd still need to win **nine games** just to cover. The total games line sits at **30.5**, meaning oddsmakers expect a best-of-five snoozefest. If you‚Äôre into that.

---

### Digesting the News: Bellucci‚Äôs Hope Is a Mirage

Let‚Äôs start with the positives for Bellucci: He‚Äôs Italian, which gives him *some* cultural advantage in New York (pizza, pasta, *ah, the aroma of success*). Beyond that? Not so much.

Bellucci advanced to this match via a **walkover** after Chinese qualifier Shang Juncheng retired injured. Great for his ATP ranking, worse for his confidence. Last week, he lost to Jaume Munar in Winston-Salem, a defeat so demoralizing it probably still echoes in his bathroom mirror.

Alcaraz? The 2022 US Open champ is on a **5-title roll this year**, including eight Masters 1000 trophies. He‚Äôs currently **100 points ahead of Jannik Sinner** in the race for year-end No. 1, and this match is a must-win to keep his crown chase aliv

I'm putting on a show for a good friend of mine, [Katie Malco](https://katiemalco.bandcamp.com), who hails from the UK and will be touring in the US next month. She's previously toured supporting the likes of Julien Baker, Alvvays, The Lumineers, Bob Mould, Peter Buck of REM, etc. Also playing will be another UK (and Hong Kong) artist named [mui zyu](https://muizyu.bandcamp.com), who is visiting the US for the first time I believe. Rounding out the bill is local songwriter [Andy Jenkins](https://andyjenkins.bandcamp.com), who's great if you're not already aware of him.

I've linked each of their names to their respective Bandcamp pages, so you can check out the tunes.

Because it's at Afterglow Coffee, the capacity is fairly limited, so if you wanted to grab a ticket in advance, that would be greatly appreciated and guarantee you get in. Not sure if this will sellout, but it very well might.

1n15kpt,https://www.reddit.com/r/MenopauseWeight/comments/1n15kpt/3_simple_things_to_fix_before_you_diet/,3 Simple Things to Fix Before You Diet,"If you‚Äôre about to start *another*¬†diet ‚Äî STOP.

Seriously. Before you dive headfirst into another ‚Äúplan‚Äù that promises to shred fat in 30 days or melt your muffin top with magic macros‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs take a breath.

Because if your **sleep is a mess**, you‚Äôre **barely drinking water**, and your **movement is hit or miss**, you‚Äôre basically trying to build a house on a cracked foundation.

And that‚Äôs why it doesn‚Äôt stick. That‚Äôs why it feels hard. That‚Äôs why you burn out by day 10 and find yourself elbow-deep in a family-sized block of chocolate wondering what‚Äôs wrong with you.

(Spoiler: Nothing. You're not broken. Your *approach*¬†is.)

So before you cut carbs or count a single calorie, **fix these 3 basics first.**

# 1. Sleep: You can't burn fat when you're exhausted.

You could be eating kale in your sleep and still not lose fat if you‚Äôre not actually *sleeping*.

When you're running on empty, your body clings to fat, especially around your belly. Cortisol (your stress hormone) spikes. Hunger hormones go wild. You crave sugar. You‚Äôre irritable. You make worse food choices ‚Äî and not because you're weak, but because your *brain is literally tired*.

**What to do:** Start aiming for 7‚Äì8 hours.Put your phone down 30 minutes earlier. Get some sunlight in the morning. Do *one*¬†thing to start honouring your rest ‚Äî it‚Äôs more powerful than any fat burner.

# 2. Water: You're not tired. You're dehydrated.

Most women I work with are *chronically*¬†dehydrated. And guess what? That fatigue, brain fog, sluggish metabolism, and ‚ÄúI think I‚Äôm hungry again‚Äù feeling? Often it‚Äôs just a thirsty body pretending it needs food.

Water helps with digestion, cravings, energy, mood, fat burning ‚Äî literally everything.

**What to do:** Aim for 2‚Äì3 litres per day. Not coffee. Not Diet Coke. Actual water. Start your day with 500ml before anything else ‚Äî consider it your fat loss pre-game.

# 3. Movement: Stop thinking workouts are the only way.

If your Apple Watch isn‚Äôt logging a 45-minute HIIT session, you think it doesn‚Äôt count, right?

Wrong.

You don‚Äôt need a gym membership or fancy activewear. You just need to **move more**¬†throughout your day. Walk. Stretch. Dance in the kitchen. Take the stairs. Movement is what gets your body out of ‚Äústorage mode‚Äù and into ‚Äúlet‚Äôs use this energy‚Äù mode.

**What to do:** Start by walking 5‚Äì10 minutes after meals. It helps with digestion *and*¬†blood sugar regulation.You‚Äôll feel better ‚Äî and burn more ‚Äî with less stress on your body.

# Bottom line?

Fixing these 3 things doesn‚Äôt just ‚Äúprepare‚Äù you for fat loss ‚Äî they **create it.**

You don‚Äôt need to be perfect. You don‚Äôt need to overhaul your life. You just need to focus on the stuff that *actually works*.

Because when these pieces are in place, **everything else feels easier.**¬†You‚Äôre not fighting your biology anymore ‚Äî you‚Äôre finally working with it.

And *that‚Äôs*¬†when fat loss gets sustainable.",1,1756262680.0,MenopauseWeight,0,1.0,False

Hi there,

I am a 33 year old guy from Michigan and I am hoping to meet someone genuine to connect with. I am open to friendship, dating, or just seeing where things naturally go. I am laid back, friendly, and always up for a good laugh. When the weather is nice you will usually find me outside camping, hiking, or spending time by the water. During the colder months I am all about staying in with coffee, a good book, or binging a series.

A little about me. I am 5‚Äô10 with an athletic build, green eyes, and brown hair. I do not smoke, and I drink socially. I try to live an active lifestyle and enjoy keeping busy but I also know how to slow down and enjoy the quiet moments.

What I am looking for is someone who is down to earth, fun to talk to, and open to building a steady connection without games or drama. I am very open minded when it comes to age and body type because I believe trust, communication, and a solid mental connection are what matter most.

I think life is better when you have someone to share it with, whether that means grabbing coffee, going for a walk, sharing stories, or even something more if the connection is right. If you are someone who values laughter, honesty, and just enjoying the simple things, I would love to get to know you.

There is a four way stop sign a house down and the speed limit is 25 mph. Per the police report the officer was not speeding (i doubt the validity of this) but sustained a head cut and was taken to the hospital, no air bags deployed.

My boyfriend was working downstairs and heard the crash and saw the officer and spoke to officers who arrived within a few minutes. I was working in the loft and didn‚Äôt hear the accident but was downstairs within a few minutes.

When I was investigating the scene I noticed a substance across the cops windshield, the cop in charge of investigating validated it was coffee which the cop was distracted by. My car was towed away to the police tow lot and instantly determined to be a total loss by my insurance as well as the accident being no fault as the government is not liable due to immunity üôÑ. It was taken into possession by insurance today from the tow lot. 

I have not received an estimated payment but my bf has a check coming in the mail for the estimate of his damage. I have 5 days with my rental car which I picked up late to try and have some cushion and am under the impression once I‚Äôm paid out I will have to give the car back in a day or two. I have called my total loss adjuster twice and haven‚Äôt heard from her but have from the people taking possession of the car from the police lot. I have begun shopping for cars but don‚Äôt know how long it will take to be paid out and worried it won‚Äôt be enough. As the KBB value for the car is 8-10k and comparable comps mileage wise in my area are 12-14k. ",6,1756261298.0,Insurance,6,0.81,False

I‚Äôm Mike, 35, a big and tall bearded guy with tattoos and a dad bod (actively losing weight, don‚Äôt worry üòè). I live in Wisconsin with my two hilarious blue heelers, Pearl and Jade, who are equal parts adorable and mischievous. Life‚Äôs never boring around here, and I‚Äôm looking for someone who can handle a little chaos, playful teasing, and maybe a bit of mischief‚Äîkind of like Malcolm Reynolds from Firefly, just with more puppy cuddles.

I‚Äôm childfree, coffee-obsessed, and currently devouring Michael Crichton‚Äôs catalog of novels.

A little flirtation goes a long way, so bonus points if you can match my energy, tease me back, or laugh at my corny jokes.

I‚Äôm mainly looking for someone in the Midwest, but I‚Äôm open to online companionships too. Ladies, if you‚Äôre into dogs, coffee, cozy nights, playful adventures, and cheeky banter, we might just get along. And yes‚Ä¶ I offer free foot massages to the right person üòâ.

*Where Fashion Fails and Forehands Reign*

---

### Parse the Odds: Tiafoe‚Äôs Immaculate Dominance

Frances Tiafoe isn‚Äôt just a favorite‚Äîhe‚Äôs a statistical inevitability. The betting lines paint him as a near-lock, with decimal odds hovering around **1.11** (equivalent to **-911** American odds), implying an **89.8% chance of victory**. For context, that‚Äôs more likely than your average coffee addict surviving a day without caffeine. Martin Damm Jr., the 21-year-old Grand Slam newbie, sits at **+6.5 to +7.13** odds (a **13.5‚Äì16.3% chance**), which is about the same odds as correctly guessing a stranger‚Äôs Spotify Wrapped in three tries.

Tiafoe‚Äôs resume at the US Open is nothing short of r√©sum√©-padding perfection: four straight quarterfinals, two semifinal berths (2022, 2024), and a 69% win rate here since 2020. Damm, meanwhile, is making his Grand Slam debut after eking out a first-round win over Yoshihito Nishioka. While that victory is as impressive as winning a pie-eating contest in a bakery, it‚Äôs not exactly a harbinger of a title run.

### Digest the News: Fashion Fails and Back Issues

Tiafoe‚Äôs first-round win over Yoshihito Nishioka was overshadowed by one glaring detail: his **bright-red outfit**, which fans mercilessly compared to Aryna Sabalenka‚Äôs racquet bag. One Twitter user wrote, ‚ÄúFrances looks like he dressed in a blindfold during a sale at Hot Topic.‚Äù Fortunately, his back‚Äîwhich forced him to withdraw from the Cincinnati Open‚Äîseems fine now. Post-match, he shrugged off the fashion critiques with the nonchalance of a man who‚Äôs more concerned with Grand Slam glory than haute couture.

Damm‚Äôs story is one of raw potential. The Czech prodigy earned his first Grand Slam win by defeating Darwin Blanch in straight sets, a performance so electrifying it made his family reconsider their entire life choices. But let‚Äôs not overst

1n150o0,https://www.reddit.com/r/demisexuality/comments/1n150o0/i_hate_being_demisexual/,I HATE Being Demisexual,"Im sorry if this post seems offensive in anyway, it is defintely not my intention to offend, but i just need to vent and share my experience. 

Im a 31 year old man whos never had a romantic relationship and still ‚Äú sort of‚Äù a virgin. Ive ‚Äútechnically‚Äù had sex but it was only one time and i was drunk, didnt finish, or enjoy it. This was when i was 25 and i havent had sex since then so it feels like ive either regained my V card or never really lost it‚Ä¶

This does not bring me joy, it does not make me feel ‚Äúunique‚Äù in anyway, it honestly feels like a curse. 

I feel like it would be a little easier if i was a girl whos demi maybe? But being a demisexual straight guy in the USA, in Nashville, TN no less‚Äîwhich is one of the most ‚Äúhook up‚Äù culture friendly states, really REALLY sucks. 

I have tried all the dating apps, the traditional ones like Tinder, Bumble, etc and the more specific ones like Match, Eharmony, Upward, etc, and i have had ZERO luck. And i literally mean zero, ive never had a single date with anybody and ive been on these apps for years. Ive gotten by bio and pictures looked at by ‚Äúpros‚Äù so i know my pics and bios arent the issue. 

So then what is the issue? To me it seems the issue is being a demisexual guy in the USA during the millennial/gen z generation.

When i get matches, which is LITERALLY once in a blue moon, i talk to women for a few days on the apps, then get their number and talk a little more maybe a phone call, but then they ghost me. EVery single time. Or if not, they friend zone me. I have literally sat and went through each and every message/text sent between me and my matches with my therapist to see if it is something im saying and its not. 

So what is it then?

I am not unattractive. I actually am above average level of attractive‚Äî and im not saying this to be pompous or arrogant in anyway, i have been told by many people i am. I work out, have abs, am 6‚Äô3, am an üáÆüáπItalian stallion (so thats +3 on my attractive scale xD), i play lead guitar in bands all around Nashville. 

So then what is it?

I am convinced its because im a demisexual GUY. Because being demi, i dont know how to flirt with women without it feeling forced and ‚Äúrobotic‚Äù. 

And yes i have tried traditional in person dating too. Ive been to a bunch of speed dating events. Whenever i have matched with someone there, i always end up getting friendzoned.

Its almost as if women seem to ‚Äúfeel‚Äù my demisexuality. Like a lack of libido thing or something. I always just give off little brother vibes with women or friend vibes. No sexual/romantic energy‚Ä¶

Im sorry if this post sounds angry, i just have been having a bad night. I, yet again, recenrely got ghosted by a girl that i had been talking to for about 3 weeks ago who seemed to really be interested in me. Then when i asked to go out for coffee or a movie, no response for two weeks and she unmatched me on the app.

So yes im sorry but i needed to vent. I apologize if this is triggering in anyway to anybody, i just dont know where else to vent this.
