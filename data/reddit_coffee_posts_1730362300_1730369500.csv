I believe my soul left with him. We started our ""normal"" day as always. I was bringing his coffee & saw him stagger. When I got to him he collapsed in my arms. I am a registered nurse & when I looked into his eyes I knew our life was over. The next 2 hours I can't remember until the ER nurse came to tell me the CPR had reached 30 minutes & I needed to come into the trauma unit. When I reached him it was if my soul ripped out of my body. I dropped to my knees & could only tell him he was the love of my life. 

I can't quit shaking. Sleep is impossible. Eating is impossible.  The adrenaline rush is over. I retired early to spend these last 6 years with him after he had suffered a heart attack. We had the ""perfect life"" on a beautiful farm. 

I went to the kitchen this am & found myself making him coffee. That was my heart breaker that cut off my autopilot denial. I could only stand there clutching his coffee cup & violently cry. I'm not sure I can survive not being able to touch him, talk to him, or just see him again. 

Everyone says ""you had 45 years."" We could have had 700 years & it wouldn't have been enough. My world died when his blue eyes closed.",1,1730369378.0,widowers,0,1.0,False

""You don't believe me when I tell you that I like the noises you make when you sleep,  
And I don't believe you when you tell me that my voice is your favorite sound,  
Not when you can sing like that.

One of your exes names tastes like stale coffee in my mouth,  
And the other one burns as if I've swallowed a scalding pot.  
You don't understand why I don't discuss my first love with you,  
But how am I supposed to tell the Sun that i once fell for the moon?

If I could, I'd pay rent for the spaces between your fingers,  
So if anyone else tried to intertwine their hands with yours,  
They would be trespassing.

I'm very good at useless metaphors,  
And very bad at telling people how I feel,  
But on our worst nights, you're snow in the month of March  
and even though I'm sick of winter,  
I will never stop appreciating the beauty of a blizzard.""",1,1730369300.0,Poetry,0,1.0,False

Hey coffee lovers!

My dad is a huge coffee fan, and I’m looking to surprise him by setting up a way for him to enjoy cafe-style, smooth coffee at home. Since it’s Diwali today, I’d love any quick recommendations on what I should get him. I’m hoping to keep things relatively budget-friendly but don’t mind investing a bit if it makes a real difference.

A few specific questions:

	•	Equipment recommendations: What’s essential for brewing smooth, rich coffee at home?
	•	Quality vs. Budget: Are pricier machines/equipment worth it, or can we get good results with more affordable options?
	•	Time & Cleaning: How much time does brewing typically take, and what’s the cleaning process like?

Would love advice from anyone who’s had a similar experience or who has practical tips to share. Thank you, and happy Diwali to everyone celebrating!",1,1730369165.0,delhi,0,1.0,False

I’ve been living in Antwerp for over a year now, but I don’t get out too much and I don’t have a wide social circle here. 
I’ve never been to Amsterdam and have been wanting to go. So I planned to go this Saturday with two friends(?), I even purchased all 3 train tickets so they could pay me back later. 

Now those two have backed out, so here I am with 3 (non-refundable)train tickets to Amsterdam and with no other friends to ask to come with me. I just want to see some of the city, visit coffee shops and have yummy food, maybe check out some museum, take cute pictures etc.

ich habe eine Frage an die Schwarmintelligenz, die mir letztes Wochenende im Buchladen durch den Kopf ging. Ich hatte den Roman von Mai Mochizuki sowohl in der deutschen (Das Mondscheincafé) als auch in der englischen Übersetzung (The Full Moon Coffee Shop) in der Hand. Grundsätzlich versuche ich Bücher in der Originalsprache lesen und bei deutschen oder englischen Büchern fällt mir dies auch leicht. Dieses Buch erschien jedoch auf japanisch und diese Sprache beherrsche ich überhaupt nicht. Ich musste mich also zwischen den beiden Übersetzungen entscheiden.

Am Ende habe ich mich für die englische Ausgabe entschieden – hauptsächlich, weil mir das Cover einfach besser gefallen hat. 

Jetzt frage ich mich aber, wie andere hier solche Entscheidungen treffen. Geht es euch um die beste Übersetzung, die optische Aufmachung, oder wählt ihr eher die Sprache, die euch am angenehmsten ist? Meine erste Tendenz würde sich nach der Qualität der Übersetzung richten, aber wie kann ich als sprachlicher Laie das beurteilen?",1,1730368965.0,buecher,0,1.0,False

  I don’t really know where to begin this. I am a 22 year old gender queer person writing this. I had a crush on my best friend (21 now, F) when I was in high school, Lets call her *Robin*. *Robin* was my best friend through high school, I never told her how I felt though I think she knew and I think she may have liked me back because she would say things like “man if a guy asked me out like that then I would definitely go out with him” and then make eye contact with me (no I never asked he out, I don’t know why). This was roughly 5/6 years ago (BTW I was still M at this time). Senior year of high school I graduated into Covid19 the world shut down, I didn’t move out of state for college, (this is a lil important) my plan was to move to NY for school. I thought “well this gives me more time with my friends” for a time that’s what it was, I would call and talk to my friends almost every day including Robin, slowly people started answering less and less including Robin, we still texted just not as frequently. The year moved on I got diagnosed with depression and Anxiety things happened that I can’t go into detail about. Tried to reach out to people, no answer, kinda slumped. Eventually I got a hold of her while at work we talked for a bit. I told her “I was  upset that I hadn't heard from her, and it felt like she didn’t care”. She said “she didn’t like me trying to push her for communication when she was not ready for that. She was dealing with her own things at this moment and didn’t have the capacity for much more at the time.” all reasonable things on her part. I wish I could say I ended this conversation in a mature way but I didn’t. I said “well I guess you’re mad at me and I’m mad at you and that’s that.” I try to give myself grace for that conversation. I was 18 and dumb, but I still should have been smarter and less of an insensitive prick. 

Anyways,

  We didn’t talk much after that, we would sometimes send a text to one another every few months but that was it. I ended up leaving for college the next year (summer of 2021) during this time I moved, I made new friends who I am still quite close with, I came out as pan-sexual. I moved on with my life. 4 years later I graduate college, I move back home, get a job and I start reaching out to old friends to just get together and grab a coffee to catch up. Robin Is one of those people. I didn’t go into this reunion expecting our old friendship. I knew how much I had changed over the years, I knew she would have as well. After that we continued to hang out now and again. We got hired for a job together last year shortly after I had moved back by an old director of ours and we ended up spending more time together, since then we have hung out a fair bit of times. We’ve had a conversation about the disagreement we had, I apologized for being an ass hat, she said she barely remembers. 

  We have been hired again to do a job together and I find myself in the uncomfortable position of catching feelings again which is extra dumb because I know she’s in a relationship, she’s been in one for a year now. But I can’t help it if I like how she can laugh about anything or her determination in face of any hardship. She is truly one of the strongest women I have ever met, her smell, her smile, her empathy openness is unmatched, she is also probably the smartest and most talented people I have ever had the fortune of meeting. I don’t want to be the asshole friend that complicates everything. I’m afraid I know myself and I know how I have felt for her in the past and I don’t want to go through that pain again. 

Communication is important in any relationship whether it be romantic or not. I don’t want to be living in a friendship where I am not being truthful.

To conclude

 What should I do? 

Pretend everything is normal and hope that my feelings fade. Do I try to somehow move on again? Do I tell her the truth and hope she takes it in stride?

I am really struggling in my new workspace and I don’t know what to do.

When I started out fresh out of school I was fetching coffee and drafting in Autocad for the project leads and the licensed architects in an office of 25 people. I stayed in that job for one year thinking this must be the grind then moved to another office, again of 20 something employees in total and two directors. There, I was lucky to be given more and more tasks and after three years I made it as co-lead with one of the directors as project manager. It felt amazing and I grew a lot but sadly due to circumstances I had to quit and move cities so onto another office.

I then landed a job in a smaller office of only 5 but had to quit after two months because the director started sexually harassing me and when I turned him down he fired me on the spot. Long story short, a month of depression and endless searching and found another office- semi corporate this time, 40 people and it all seemed good at the first. But one year in, I feel extremely unhappy with the workspace. Although I am not being harassed I reverted back to drafting work and being given unimportant tasks by people even my age who are in leading roles. They keep shuffling me around as support in different projects where I spend weeks designing toilets or outdoor stairs or patching up a section or a facade someone else already drawn, barely touching any plans or technical details. Needless to say I was never on a construction site on a project I actively worked on.

I raised those issues twice during my performance review and they all nod and agree but I am never placed on a project from beginning to end, never given enough information and still passed around as support from team to team. I watch with great frustration as people younger than me get responsibility and I am just there patching up their drawings. I constantly try to come with ideas, offer suggestions, offer my help but it never makes a difference. In that one job I had I was seen as having potential, loved to learn and was given a chance to be in a leadership role. But since then I am just a background face in every meeting. It is starting to make me depressed as it feels I will never find better than what I had at that company.

I want to quit again and find another office but I am afraid I have been job hopping too much.

I am not sure if all this means architecture is not for me and I should try something else or should I make peace with being forever a support.

If anyone has any suggestions I would love some feedback.

A few weeks passed and one night i tell him if we could be exclusive in sex and he thought it was a bit early to ask about this but he agreed. After i asked him if he was seeing other people and he said no, he asked me the same.

I never asked him directly what he was looking because even myself i was trying to figure out, but after seeing him a couple of times i realised I am interested in him and want to keep seeing him to get to know him well (i expressed this, and he told me he takes a lot of time to engage with a person and goes very slow) 

one night i went out to a club with my friends and he did as well with his and casually we met at this club. I was pleasantly surprised but a bit anxious at the same time because i was not ready to introduce him to my friends. He came casually to say hi but after that his behaviour was very strange. My friends left us alone for a bit and i could see he was not engage with me. He was talking and asking a lot of questions of how was my day but at the same time his body language was disconnected and he seems distracted. Sometimes when we were moving from one room to another he was walking so fast in front of me he didn’t even noticed i was behind him or not, and at the end i felt so unwanted and uncomfortable that hat i just 
decided to say bye and stay with my friends the rest of the night, he did the same with his. 

i had a call with him to talk about this and he said he was happy to see me there but that was a night with some friends he has not seeing in months so he didn’t want to spend that much time with me as he wanted to be with his friends and i understood that. He apologised for the behaviour. 

I left for a 2 weeks trip with my friends in another country, and we keep the contact almost everyday. the conversation seem a bit forced at the beginning due the last encounter we had in that club but after it seemed normal again. However my gut told me something was still off so I asked him if everything was ok. 

He replied saying that he is very sorry and he was waiting for me to have a conversation once i’m back in person because he feels we are not in the same vibe and he is not mentally there. I was already sad reading the message and ready to be ghosted but he asked to meet in person to talk about this. I don’t know what to interpret as i don’t understand him. In public he seems cold and distant, in private he is very touchy and caring. We can talk about everything and share very similar values.

When he told me this i felt immediately that i don’t want to see him again. Because if we don’t shared the same vibe why so we need to talk about it. However i agreed to meet for a coffee to talk about it.

1ggaij5,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1ggaij5/her_friend_laughed_while_i_was_asking_her_out/,Her friend laughed while I was asking her out ,"So I have been seeing a girl in this cafeteria near my college for a while. For the past 3 months, it was probably exchanging looks and catching each other glancing at each other. After asking around, I came to know she was single. So I decided to man up and ask her out. 

Yesterday afternoon, as she was leaving , I somehow made myself walk towards her . For the record, I have never asked a girl out before .I gathered all my courage and I approached her and said 'hey, I have been seeing you around for a while'. And then her friend burst out laughing. Even she started to giggle but then suppressed it and I got nervous and defensive and I said ' I'm sorry if I'm making you uncomfortable. But maybe if you are free now or any time, we could grab some coffee or something '. And she said she had some work to take care of and left the scene. 

I mean, I wouldn't have worried if she called the cops on me or called me a creep, but her friend laughing out was not something I expected. In my mind it wasn't even that bad of a starting line. And I don't look that bad at all. MY friends would rate me 7 at any time of the week. I still don't understand what was funny about it. I haven't talked to a single girl since covid(that's the kind of field I'm in ) and, this is probably the first time I ever ask out and this happens. 

I am not even bothered by the rejection. But this insufferable memory keeps playing over my head every 2 minutes and I can't cope enough. I have had some minor self-esteem issues but this thing is eating me alive. Not sure how to get this out of my head. ",1,1730367216.0,offmychest,2,0.99,False

I live in the boonies, out in the woods no light, so I immediately called my boyfriend thinking it was a ghost lol! Of course he didn’t believe me. 

Next day, we had gone on a little morning coffee date, got back to the house, was sitting in the car talking and once again someone is talking through my speakers! He believed me that time!

It was a woman just going “Hello? Hello?!”
I feel like she might have been just as confused as us. I looked down at my phone, no calls, bluetooth off. He looks at his, the same. 

I look at my UConnect, and you can really quickly tell there is nothing connected just by flipping through the menu options. I even checked my volume and it was at 0!!

I had to really power through snoozing my alarm, even when I woke up and was getting ready I still felt like not going(imposter syndrome maybe?) 

Fueled by a coffee, a banana and a lucozade, I Drove to the pool, got there and saw it was pretty much empty. 5 lanes with 1 person in each. The lane I joined I had to myself for 90% of the workout, hardly ever happens int he evening. 

Swam my 1km, practiced some extra things like flip turns and dolphin kicks and then was time to get ready to start my day and get to the office. the endorphins high is still going on and I feel like one of my main tasks for the day has been completed. 

TLDR: 
Pros - lane to myself, no traffic to get there, uninterrupted swim session, endorphins throughout the day

Cons - not much time to prep or warm up outside the pool, getting ready to go to work rather than to sleep

# Inszenierter Terror made in Germany: Willkommen in der Oper des Angstmachens 🎭💥

Ein inszenierter Terroranschlag, um das Herz der Republik Berlin zu erschüttern? Wir kennen das Szenario: Eine herrenlose Tasche, achtlos am S-Bahnhof Neukölln zurückgelassen, bringt die Sicherheitsmaschinerie in Gang. Binnen Minuten sind Spezialkräfte, Bombenentschärfer und Polizeihubschrauber am Start, und die Pressestelle hält die Zuschauer auf dem Laufenden – könnte ja schließlich ein „Terroranschlag“ sein. Aber nehmen wir uns doch einen Moment Zeit und fragen uns: Wie real ist die Bedrohung, und wie viel davon könnte Inszenierung sein? 🕵️‍♂️📢

\[Primärquelle: Mann ließ Tasche an Berliner S-Bahnhof zurück: Es war Terror-Sprengstoff!

  Aus \[BILD: 31.10.2024 - 09:26 Uhr\] <[https://www.bild.de/regional/berlin/mann-liess-tasche-an-berliner-s-bahnhof-zurueck-es-war-terror-sprengstoff-672329a3f7653a077c0e88a1](https://www.bild.de/regional/berlin/mann-liess-tasche-an-berliner-s-bahnhof-zurueck-es-war-terror-sprengstoff-672329a3f7653a077c0e88a1)\> 

Oh, die Strategie der Spannung – ein Meisterwerk moderner Machtsicherung und vielleicht die eleganteste Art, eine Bevölkerung in ständiger Paranoia zu halten, um sie schleichend in eine neue „Normalität“ des Gehorsams zu führen. Was benötigt es dafür? Eine Prise inszenierter Terror, eine Handvoll medial ausgeschlachteter „Schreckensmeldungen“ und das immergrüne Versprechen der totalen Sicherheit – falls man natürlich bereit ist, ein paar Rechte und Freiheiten abzugeben. Die Strategie der Spannung ist im Wesentlichen ein schmutziger Krieg, der ohne offenen Waffeneinsatz geführt wird, aber mit einem Arsenal psychologischer Manipulation, orchestrierter Bedrohungsszenarien und dem gezielten Einsatz von Angst. Die Mittel? Regelmäßig eingestreute Bedrohungen und „vereitelte Terrorakte“, oft inszeniert durch Agent Provocateurs – jene unsichtbaren Hände, die aus dem Verborgenen für Chaos sorgen und so den Eindruck erwecken, dass die Nation ständig am Abgrund steht. Und das Timing dieser „Ereignisse“ ist bemerkenswert präzise: Immer dann, wenn sicherheitspolitische Gesetze oder Budgeterhöhungen anstehen, taucht zufällig ein neuer „Fall“ auf, der die vermeintliche Notwendigkeit genau dieser Maßnahmen unterstreicht. Heute: 

# 🎒 Die vergessene Tasche: Vom verlorenen Eigentum zur Staatsbedrohung

Der Ausgangspunkt dieser „Operation“ klingt banal: Ein Mann lässt seine Tasche am Bahnhof stehen und verschwindet eilig. Ein Missgeschick, denkt man. Doch was passiert? Sekunden später wird der Fund zur Staatsaffäre. Angeblich enthält die Tasche Kabel und graues Pulver, das sofort als das gefährliche TATP identifiziert wird – bekannt als „Mutter des Satans“. Ein Begriff, der Katastrophenszenarien in den Köpfen heraufbeschwört. Die Frage liegt auf der Hand: Wie wahrscheinlich ist es, dass sich ein halbes Kilo dieses brisanten Stoffes einfach so in einer herrenlosen Tasche an einem Berliner Bahnhof findet? Und entdeckt von einer zufälligen Taschenkontrolle, die sich auf Verdachtsmomente stützt, die aus dem Drehbuch eines Spionagethrillers stammen könnten.

🎒💣 Natürlich wurde der Agent Provocateur nur entdeckt durch zufällige Taschenkontrolle von Ausländern, die gemäß der Storyline regelmäßig mit Sprengstoff rumlaufen, man weiß ja nie, was für ein Glück im Unglück, dass anlasslose Taschenkontrolle - vielleicht sogar Gedankenkontrolle und Gehirnscan - möglich sind.

https://preview.redd.it/k85ezwye72yd1.png?width=1092&format=png&auto=webp&s=031c053cf3a86dc58859d854168e5b05dd1efb93

🚨 Der Einsatz: Bombenentschärfer und Feuerwehr auf dem Plan

Mit einem solchen Fund ruft man natürlich die Spezialeinheiten auf den Plan. Alles wird abgeriegelt, Einsatzkräfte sind vor Ort und zur Beruhigung des Publikums wird die Tasche in die Luft gesprengt. Die Stadt gerät in einen Ausnahmezustand, die Bevölkerung beobachtet in Sorge. Aber wessen Interessen dient diese „Show“? Für den Sicherheitsapparat ergibt sich jedenfalls ein perfektes Szenario: Man zeigt, wie wachsam die Polizei ist und dass nur ihre unermüdliche Arbeit die Bevölkerung schützt. Ein schöner Nebeneffekt: Die Leute denken, sie leben ständig am Rande eines Terrorszenarios – und genau das befeuert die gewünschte Alarmbereitschaft. 💥🚔

🕶️ Desinformation? Hauptsache „Terrorgefahr“ bleibt präsent

Warum denn so kompliziert denken? Da ist ein polnischer Ausweis – natürlich gestohlen, wie praktisch! Und auf Überwachungsvideos entdeckt ein para-normaler „Super-Recognizer“ sofort, dass der Mann auf dem Pass vermutlich gar nicht der Verdächtige ist. Ein para-psychologischer Super-Recognizer, ernsthaft? Das klingt nach Hollywood, aber vielleicht funktioniert es ja: Die Bevölkerung weiß nicht mehr, was sie glauben soll, und bleibt lieber auf der sicheren Seite – nach dem Motto „Lieber zu vorsichtig als zu nachlässig.“ 🤦‍♂️🎥 Die armen Sicherheitsbehörden: Müssen auf Parapsychologie und andere esoterische Konzepte wie Remote Viewing oder extresensorische Wahrnehmung setzen, weil die keine Super-Technik einsetzen dürften, um uns alle zu unterdrücken, zu knechten und ewig zu binden und für uns allerlei Verwendung finden im Rahmen der Versklavung und Knechtung. Natürlich steigt durch medial inszenierte Sprengungen von durch einmalig genutzte Agenten platzierte Sprengstofftaschen die Akzeptanz für Anti-Terror-Maßnahmen. Wie viel Geld bekommt der Agent, der irgendeinen geklauten Ausweis bewusst platziert oder gemäß der vorherigen Absprache zufällig fallenlässt vom Verfassungsschutz für die einmalige Aktion? Oder ist er auch Teil der paramilitärischen Gruppe, die den Umsturz und Bürgerkrieg in Deutschland will?

https://preview.redd.it/22dnmk7i72yd1.png?width=1161&format=png&auto=webp&s=e41d68d22fa585b0a57ab060bd9323e43550ee33

🤹‍♂️ „Terrorgefahr“ als Mittel zum Zweck?

Interessant, wie oft solche Fälle wie bestellt auftauchen, sobald der Staat gerade an Sicherheitsgesetzen oder Budgeterhöhungen für die Polizei bastelt. Ist es nicht praktisch, dass solche „Funde“ wie TATP, der Lieblingssprengstoff der Terroristen, genau dann auftaucht, wenn es den Behörden passt? Während die Bevölkerung ängstlich zuschaut, wird hintenrum an neuen Maßnahmen gebastelt, die Überwachung erweitern, mehr Budget für die Polizei garantieren und natürlich noch mehr Kontrolle ermöglichen.

So sehen wir, dass der Feind überall lauert, v.a. Menschen aus Ländern: in Taschen, Thermoskannen, Coffee-to-Go-Bechern und vielleicht bald auch in Einkaufswagen – man weiß nie, wo der nächste Rucksack sich als Bedrohung entpuppt. Die Lösung? Noch mehr Sicherheitstechnologie und am besten alle Bürger\*innen durchleuchten, überwachen und bei Fehlverhalten sofort auf die Liste der „Gefährder“ setzen. So könnte man schließlich das hehre Ziel erreichen: absolute Kontrolle, und all das mit einem simplen, aber wirksamen Taschenspielertrick. Ein Hoch auf die kreative Terrorabwehr made in Germany – bald in jedem Bahnhof und Stadtpark!

💡 Fazit: Eine Show für das Sicherheits-Budget?

Dieser Fall könnte so typisch sein für inszenierten Terror: Alles auf die Bedrohung, Sirenen und rote Absperrbänder konzentriert. Die Bevölkerung wird so in einem Angstzustand gehalten und wünscht sich beinahe die starke Hand, die durchgreift und alles „sicher“ macht. Eine unsichtbare Hand führt dieses Stück, und wir applaudieren wie auf Kommando. Schließlich, so die Message, sind diese Maßnahmen ja nur zu unserem Besten. 👏🔐

Also, ein Hoch auf die Taktik des Unheils, die uns alle beschützt – und dabei ganz nebenbei alle, die nachdenken, mundtot macht. Denn wer will schon Freiheit, wenn er stattdessen auch den warmen, autoritären Griff der Sicherheitsbehörden im Schritt spüren kann?



Wichtige Begriffe in diesem Zusammenhang:

Hier ist ein Glossar mit kurzen Erläuterungen:

Strategie der Spannung

Die „Strategie der Spannung“ bezeichnet eine politische Taktik, bei der gezielte Gewalt, Desinformation und Inszenierungen genutzt werden, um die Bevölkerung in Angst zu versetzen und einen permanenten Ausnahmezustand zu rechtfertigen. Durch diese Strategie sollen Bürger ihre Abhängigkeit von Sicherheitskräften und autoritären Maßnahmen akzeptieren und in Krisenzeiten weniger kritische Fragen stellen. Bekannt wurde das Konzept in den 1970er Jahren in Italien, als staatliche und paramilitärische Kräfte mutmaßlich an Bombenanschlägen und anderen gewaltsamen Aktionen beteiligt waren, die kommunistischen Gruppen in die Schuhe geschoben wurden, um so die Öffentlichkeit gegen linke Strömungen aufzubringen.

Schmutziger Krieg

Unter „Schmutzigem Krieg“ versteht man verdeckte, oft illegale Operationen von staatlichen oder geheimdienstlichen Akteuren gegen politische Gegner, die meist als Bedrohung für das bestehende Regime gelten. Ziel ist die Zerschlagung oder Schwächung dieser oppositionellen Gruppen durch Einschüchterung, Entführung oder Ermordung. Besonders bekannt sind die schmutzigen Kriege der Militärdiktaturen in Südamerika, etwa in Argentinien und Chile in den 1970er und 1980er Jahren, in denen der Staat systematisch gegen vermeintliche Feinde vorging und tausende Menschen „verschwinden“ ließ.

Agent Provocateur

Ein „Agent Provocateur“ ist ein vom Staat oder von anderen Interessengruppen eingesetzter Undercover-Agent, der sich als Mitglied oder Sympathisant einer Gruppe ausgibt und gezielt dazu anstiftet, Straftaten zu begehen. Durch das provozierte kriminelle Verhalten kann die Gruppe dann öffentlich diskreditiert oder rechtlich verfolgt werden. Der Einsatz solcher Provokateure gehört zu den Methoden verdeckter Operationen und wurde vielfach in politischen Bewegungen oder Protestgruppen dokumentiert, um unliebsame Gruppen zu spalten oder gegen sie vorzugehen.

She is quite introvert and seems of good character. So I was quite heartbroken but I try doing different antics to impress her but she just laughs them off(not irritated) She has a very good male friend (another classmate) , who is tall+attractive. I always suspected that they both are together but he is in a relationship with some other girl and she doesn't go out with boys alone.

Now the main story is. 2 days ago, when our classes ended for the day, I saw them sitting in her car together and I got jealous AF so I put my scooty after them at a safe distance. They stopped outside some small house and went inside the gate. Now you can imagine my fury. I parked some yards away, and waited for a few minutes then climbed the wall.. I wanted to get inside the house at any cost, so I devised a quick plan and knocked on door. Till he came outside to check, I went to the back and hid there. He went back inside and then I knocked again and this time both of them scared and furious came outside and tried to check everywhere, leaving the main door open. I slowly slowly crawled away from wherever they were checking and when both of them were in backyard, I went inside the door. It was one bhk home, so I went quickly inside the only room and hid myself in the cupboard. They both came back and were in the living room. He was playfully teasing her. And she was saying that why he was with that other girl and didn't recognized her love earlier. Both were talking very sensually. (imagine my fury). Then she told him to be gentle as it was her first time and he said that he bet she wouldn't be able to walk on her legs afterwards. (imagine my fury). Then she asked him to wait there and she came to the room. She wore a very se#y make up and a sizzling bikini, and then asked him to come to the room. Then what i saw i couldnt believe my eyes, that she is the same naive girl. She danced for him on a really sensual song, and was literally behaving like a [wh@re](mailto:wh@re). I peeked in from the cupboard all the time and boy oh boy. For the next 4 hrs, he literally busted every hole that she had in multiple positions and not once gently, and she was enjoying it AF. She kept moaning and screaming loudly and he kept banging her from left, right and centre. Especially when they were trying the ""other hole"", she literally bled. And even then he pounded her in that hole one more time. On the bed, on the couch, leaning on wall from behind.. in missionary, in doggy,.. THEY TRIED EACH FUC\*ING THING...she even jokingly said to him ""forget walking, i wont be able to sit properly for weeks now""...thats the level of pounding she had recieved....

I was like where the F did that introvert and shy girl has gone whom I loved. I used to be very respectful and gentle around her but during all this episode he wasn't once gentle with her and even slapped her hard when she was blowing him. So after all this (4 hrs had passed), they both went to the attached bathroom and she was literally not able to walk properly. After a minute or two, her moans started again. Here I was in the cupboard, with teary eyes and a huge boner. I quietly came outside and sneaked outside the main door and then climbed the wall again and got home. All the night I was having the worst wet dreams of my life involving both of them. Yesterday in the class, both of them arrived separately as usual and were behaving like nothing had happened. She was still not able to walk properly. She was with her female friends, and I was feeling the very urge to talk to her. So I asked her for notes and she gave me those. I couldn't control myself and asked if she would like a coffee in the Cafe and she smiled and said that I've told you earlier, I don't go out with boys alone. I kept quite.. But wtf bro... Tell me straight away that you don't like me rather not wanting a relationship with anyone.

I don't know if I'm horny, sad or heartbroken since 2 days. Probably a mixture of all feelings. This event has probably given me a trauma for whole life... I can't even eat or sleep properly... She was the only girl whom I had ever loved in my life... Does this happen with all nice guys??,

This story is true AF. May sound over dramatic but I can't assure you people using anything else.. Needed to take it out somewhere so using this account I made a month ago for browsing .... Feel free to share your thoughts..",0,1730365160.0,AITAH,8,0.42,False

Really really long shot. I used to follow his account on TikTok but now I cannot find him whatsoever. 
His videos mainly consisted of him wearing suits, walking up to his workshop (tailors) with a outside table and chair, he’d talk for a bit about whatever he was doing, what pocket square he was wearing at the time which were mainly Italy oriented (beach, Rome, Venice etc etc) he’d sit down sip his coffee and grab his book filled with suit materials from brands such as Loro piana. He’s also an older man if that helps anything. He’d always start his videos with “bonjourno”

Was visiting some family in west of Ireland, and was awake before everyone to take my 40mg lisdex. 

There’s no protein heavy foods so I walk into town. Only place open is the American Embassy, McD’s!

I order a egg sausage McMuffin and “enjoy” it in a totally empty - but for the staff - restaurant.

When I’m done I put my rubbish in the bin, shout cheers to the staff and make my way to the exit.

As I go through the automatic door at the entrance, I don’t notice the metal that it rests on is soaked from outside rain leaking in.

I yell a high C note as I stumble and come crashing down full weight on my knee (I’m pretty slight, but it hurt alot).

I pick myself up and hobble to the counter where I make eye contact with the manager and wave, clearly I’m in pain…nothing! A few other staff members ignore me completely and then a girl eventually offers me some napkins. Bless her, but I’m not bleeding or crying (at least I don’t think…maybe I had a big bogie sticking out of my nose).

I suggest they put a sign up to warn other customers, & the girl just walks away without acknowledging it. 

I laugh under my breath, hobble to the coffee shop nearby for a peppermint tea.

An hour later my knee is the size of Jupiter and I can’t walk 😂 I phone a family member to pick me up. THEN begin the 6 hour journey home cooped backseat in a tiny car to get to my local A&E as advised by my GP when I called them for advice.

They kept telling me the next 6 weeks are gonna be tough as I’m immobile (luckily no fracture, but badly damaged soft tissue), and to get plenty of ibuprofen to manage the considerable pain. Until I mention the lisdex and it terrifies them all and they tell me to stick to paracetamol 😂

Anyway, just ranting! I’ve been enjoying my titration process (mostly), mainly as it’s encouraged me to walk 10k a day…but I guess that’s out of the window for now!

This Dubrovnik Travel Guide is your ultimate companion,"# Ah, Dubrovnik! The Pearl of the Adriatic, a UNESCO World Heritage site, and the backdrop to countless films and TV shows (King's Landing anyone?). This Croatian gem boasts stunning medieval architecture, crystal-clear waters, and a vibrant culture that will leave you utterly charmed. But navigating a new city can be daunting, so we’ve crafted this Dubrovnik Travel Guide to be your trusty sidekick.

We Are [**NorthernWanderers.com**](http://NorthernWanderers.com) Your Travel Guide to the World.

# Brief Overview

Dubrovnik is a city on the Adriatic Sea in southern Croatia. It's known for its distinctive Old Town, encircled with massive stone walls completed in the 16th century. Its well-preserved buildings range from Renaissance fountains to Baroque churches. I found it captivating to wander through the maze of marble streets, taking in the sights and sounds of this historical hub. Dubrovnik is also a popular filming location, most notably for the HBO series Game of Thrones.

https://preview.redd.it/bjhipqdp22yd1.jpg?width=1440&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=983581b137bf25ffdef53e85bbf37529b77932d5

# Best time to visit

The best time to visit Dubrovnik is during the shoulder seasons – **April-May** and **September-October**. You'll enjoy pleasant weather (perfect for exploring on foot), fewer crowds, and lower prices compared to the peak summer months. However, if you don't mind the hustle and bustle, July and August offer the warmest weather and the liveliest atmosphere, but be prepared for higher prices and lots of fellow tourists.

# Getting around Dubrovnik

Dubrovnik is a very walkable city, especially the Old Town, which is entirely pedestrianized. You'll find yourself happily getting lost in the charming alleyways and stumbling upon hidden gems.

While a car isn't necessary within the city itself, it can be handy for exploring the surrounding areas, such as the Pelješac Peninsula known for its wineries, or venturing further afield to Montenegro or Bosnia and Herzegovina. Several car rental companies operate at Dubrovnik Airport and in the city centre.

# Things to see and do

Dubrovnik is bursting with things to see and do. Here are a few highlights to add to your itinerary:

Take a ride up Mount Srđ on the Dubrovnik Cable Car for breathtaking panoramic views of the city, the Adriatic Sea, and the nearby islands. It's truly a sight to behold, especially at sunset. You can even grab a bite to eat at the Panorama Restaurant at the top.

Walking the entirety of Dubrovnik's Old City Walls is a must-do. These impressive fortifications offer a unique perspective of the city and provide incredible photo opportunities at every turn. Be prepared for a bit of a climb, but the views are worth every step. I recommend starting early in the morning or later in the afternoon to avoid the midday heat.

Known as ""Dubrovnik's Gibraltar"", Fort Lovrijenac is a detached fortress guarding the western entrance to the city. It's a dramatic sight, perched on a 37-meter high cliff overlooking the sea. Game of Thrones fans will recognize it as the Red Keep in King's Landing.

The Old Town Port is a bustling hub of activity, with fishing boats bobbing alongside excursion boats ready to whisk you away to nearby islands. It's a great place to soak up the atmosphere, grab a coffee, or watch the world go by.

https://preview.redd.it/ilylw69q22yd1.jpg?width=1900&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a94c4c745c48b88b3fa16c19fb4f5a7769e26756

Escape the city buzz with a short ferry trip to the idyllic island of Lokrum. This lush island is a nature reserve, home to peacocks, rabbits, and a saltwater lake known as the ""Dead Sea"". You can explore the Benedictine monastery ruins, relax on the beaches, or enjoy a picnic in the shade of the pine trees.

The Franciscan Monastery is a peaceful oasis within the Old Town, home to a beautiful cloister and one of the oldest pharmacies in Europe, dating back to 1317. It's a fascinating place to delve into Dubrovnik's history and find some respite from the bustling streets.

Simply wandering through the Old Town's labyrinthine streets is a joy in itself. You'll discover hidden courtyards, charming shops, and delightful cafes tucked away in every corner. Don't be afraid to get lost – that's part of the fun!

Dubrovnik has a number of interesting museums to explore, including the Dubrovnik City Museum, the Maritime Museum, and the War Photo Limited. They offer insights into the city's rich history, maritime traditions, and the impact of the Croatian War of Independence.

Croatia is becoming increasingly known for its wines, and Dubrovnik is a great place to sample some local varieties. Several wineries offer tours and tastings, or you can simply enjoy a glass of Croatian wine at a bar or restaurant.

For a unique perspective of Dubrovnik, try sea kayaking around the city walls and nearby islands. It's a fun and active way to see the city from a different angle and enjoy the beautiful Adriatic waters.

# Where to stay

Dubrovnik offers a wide range of accommodation options to suit all budgets. Within the Old Town, you'll find charming boutique hotels and guesthouses. Outside the walls, there are larger hotels, apartments, and villas.

https://preview.redd.it/c3eoj4vs22yd1.jpg?width=1619&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=468db0cd489124b7570abf3763db8c75cf5e5ecd

**Here are a few recommendations:**

* **Hotel Excelsior:** A luxurious 5-star hotel with stunning views of the Old Town.
* **Pucic Palace:** A beautiful boutique hotel located within a 17th-century palace.
* **Villa Orsula:** An elegant hotel with a private beach and panoramic sea views.

# Where to Eat

Dubrovnik's culinary scene is a delightful mix of traditional Croatian dishes and modern Mediterranean cuisine. Fresh seafood is a staple, and you'll find it featured on most menus.

**Here are a few must-try dishes:**

* **Crni rižot (black risotto):** A flavorful risotto made with cuttlefish ink.
* **Peka:** Meat or seafood slowly cooked under a bell-shaped lid.
* **Brodet:** A fish stew made with various types of fish and shellfish.

Dubrovnik's cafe culture is thriving. You'll find plenty of charming cafes and bars where you can enjoy a coffee, a glass of wine, or a refreshing cocktail.

**Here are a few popular spots:**

* **Buža Bar:** A unique bar built into the cliffs outside the city walls, offering spectacular sea views.
* **Bard Bar:** A lively bar with a great atmosphere, located in the heart of the Old Town.
* **Cafe Festival:** A popular cafe with a terrace overlooking the main street, Stradun.

# Getting to Dubrovnik

Dubrovnik is well-connected by air, sea, and land.

Dubrovnik Airport (DBV) is located about 20 km southeast of the city centre. Regular flights connect Dubrovnik with major European cities. From the airport, you can reach the city by shuttle bus, taxi, or rental car.

Dubrovnik has a well-developed bus network connecting it with other cities in Croatia and neighbouring countries. The main bus station is located just outside the city walls.

Driving to Dubrovnik is a scenic option, but be prepared for winding roads and potential border crossings if you're coming from another country.

Ferries connect Dubrovnik with the nearby islands and with other coastal towns in Croatia. You can also arrive in Dubrovnik on a cruise ship.

# Good to know

Here are a few practical tips to make your trip to Dubrovnik smoother:

Much of Dubrovnik, especially the Old Town, is paved with marble streets. These can get quite slippery, especially when wet. Pack a pair of comfortable and waterproof sandals for exploring the city.

The Croatian sun can be strong, especially during the summer months. Be sure to pack sunscreen with a high SPF to protect your skin.

A wide-brimmed hat will provide extra protection from the sun and keep you cool while exploring the city.

Croatia uses 220V electricity and European-style two-pin plugs. If you're travelling from a country with a different voltage or plug type, you'll need an adapter.

The official language of Croatia is Croatian. While English is widely spoken in tourist areas, learning a few basic Croatian phrases will be appreciated by locals.

**Is Dubrovnik expensive?**

Dubrovnik can be more expensive than other parts of Croatia, especially during peak season. However, you can still find affordable options for accommodation, food, and activities if you plan your trip carefully.

I recommend spending at least 3-4 days in Dubrovnik to fully explore the city and its surroundings. If you have more time, you can easily spend a week or more enjoying the beaches, islands, and nearby attractions.

Dubrovnik is a very safe city with a low crime rate. However, as with any tourist destination, it's always wise to be aware of your surroundings and take precautions against petty theft.

I can still remember how his face resembles
Whenever my heart ensembles
He's tall, yet he's short
Sometimes I call him dork
We are sexually compatible
The smell of coffee through his mouth
The mocha I can still taste, I doubt
Why do I feel this way?

When he touches my waist
I felt the electric touch, running through my cortex
All the things I felt for him, just for a sex
I thought we were on the same page
But I was in a blank page
No context

He asks 'Are you free today?'
I immediately respond
So that I can never change his mind
My people pleaser ass cannot resist his presence

His skin fits my pants
My heart does not fit his wants
I cut my skin just for him
I did not receive anything in return
I did not ask for something, neither did I waited
Maybe I am just infatuated

I don't need a xanax 
To feed my anxiety
His skin is my medicine
But turns out I ran out of it
I built him a castle, a cardinal
Yet it was elemental

Now I leave here hanging
Still waiting for his text...

I need some advice as I don't know if this is normal or not.

I am 20f, have 1 sibling 22m and I live at home due to college. My mum is constantly saying stuff like "" you are so disrespectful and horrible"" - ocassion I had just got out of bed (not even awake 5 mins) went to get coffee and then to the bathroom. When I came back she was in my room rummaging for an item that I told her wasn't there and was in a different room in the house (I will admit I was a little grumpy but at the same time I told her on several occasions that this wasn't in my room but she still went in) 
This isn't the first time she's done something like this. 

Another thing was a few days ago my parents asked me to clean up after dinner and I spoke to the calmly and when my sibling wasn't there "" why can't x do the kitchen I have been doing it all week?"" And she retorted with ""it's not that hard to do what I ask"" she then gone up and started slamming plated into the washer. I said ""u know I would have done that tonight but I wanted to talk to you about how x dosent do anything to help out eg. Washing clothes, cleaning the bathroom, vacuuming etc (which is true), I was just wondering if u could talk to them to get them to help a bit more as I'm constantly tidying after them"" she then escalated the conversation came back with the same response that I get every time I talk to them ""I'm tired, I don't want to hear about it, you always go on about stuff, just stop complaining"" and I will admit I responded meanly by saying ""you never listen, you never care, every time I try to talk to u, u brush me off""

I know I made a huge mistake in life by having an affair when married to my wife, and we both (myself and woman I had affair with) felt really unhappy as we cheated our respective partners and I am also feeling very sorry about my children and wife who doesn't even know that the affair existed.

I met her back 3 years ago, in a birthday party. It was the birthday party of a friend of my son. She was the birthday boy's mother. While I saw her for the first time, I was amazed and stund by her beauty. She was having a wavy salt and peppered hair, she was very fair, her eyes were like the petals of Lotus and they sparked like bright stars at the night, she was a 38, but very young woman . I can't look at anything except her, and even never bothered about her husband standing nearby and was in a state of excitement. I was thinking about her the whole week. I got a chance to meet her again in a parents and teachers meet held at my son's school.

She smiled seeing me, and I can never forget her smile even today. It is a wine, that never faded away from my mind, it just became more overwhelming. I was having a long conversation with her on that day for the first time. People call me funny and we both were laughing hard and I never missed a chance to appreciate her beauty that day. She herself asked for my number and we began to chat, not always but once in a very long time.

Days rolled and she badly needed a favour from me as her husband was arrested in an issue. I got involved, I know some influential people across the town and I backed her husband and was instrumental in his release. For that she gifted me a new watch, which I am wearing write now while writing this answer, only this watch was with me when I was with her. Then we became very close. She used to call me whenever free talked some stuffs. Later on, as both myself and her worked in the same locality, we started meeting up for coffee and dinner sometimes.

Slowly she too felt she was attracted. She started flirting with me. I became more open, both flirted as well as credited her beauty, She blushed everytime when I did that.

Something I even today feel really bad for... happened 😔. That day, as her husband was away for a working trip, she invited me for some paper work she had and needed my help. It was about 11 am, first we watched a movie together and then I went on to work for her. I can feel both us were unable to control our lusts. Suddenly she said she has fell in love with me and hugged me tightly. That was the first time, she hugged me. I was not on earth and was floating around at that moment, I too hugged her and kissed her on forehead. I should have stopped atleast at that moment, but we ended in that act that day, she was the only woman other than my wife with whom I slept. I took a bath and went home but that time I wasn't happy and I took a decision: to never do that damn thing again.

Next day, both of us apologized each other, and we were together again. She became pregnant due to my act but took pills to abort it, she had health issues but she never blamed me for that. We started travelling to many places. Visited theatres, parks, malls and many more. I took her to parties and we danced together, gave each other passionate kisses, sometimes locked our lips and I never went to more extend again.

She was my biggest support, even more than my wife. She supported me emotionally. Aided me by doing some financial helps. She showed me true love that I only saw from my mother.

Days passed, and one day we met for one last time. Both our sons completed their tenth standard, and I went to her house and she was alone. She invited me to say a good bye as her husband was transferred to some other city and her son was willing to study there and wanted to move on to a good school.

Our eyes completely turned wet. She was crying and her eyes became red. I hugged her very tightly and she held my shoulders and we were holding each other tightly for more than some minutes and were crying hardly. My shoulders became wet of her tears and finally we locked our lips for a while. 

TLDR: As she left, she tried to contact me again. But this time, I never gave her that chance, blocked her and brought a new sim card so that she would forget me, move on and so that the affair would end. I know it would be painful and harsh but later on I got used to it, and my two years of colourful life came to an end. Though even today I can't forget her but still I did that for the future of my sons and my family. Got to know from a friend of mine that she is having a very good time with her husband, but I know she would be in pain, atleast somewhere at the bottom of her heart. But sometimes it's better to enjoy the pain for making people around us happy. Right??

I somehow beat the True Ending's final boss with my [Nightfall Vidar](https://www.reddit.com/r/armoredcore/comments/1gfgasj/been_playing_again_and_this_build_has_been/). Took about a handful of tries and a whole lot of coffee. 

Anyway, time for a new run so I thought to switch to another preset-only-but-not-really AC. Chose the Ortus this time but ditched its weapons save for the slicer. Inspired by the Adeptus Custodes from WH40k, paintjob-wise. Toyed a good while with the gold color before deciding on this one. It's getting me through the game predictably well.

PS: The red decals are mine(still learning how to make really cool ones) but the permet lines are *not*. I just downloaded those a while back and had them laying around so I slapped them on there. ",2,1730362447.0,armoredcore,0,1.0,False
