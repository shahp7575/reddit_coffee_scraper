Breville have said its out of warranty..it is by 3 months. So all they can do is offer us 40% a new machine.
The machine it's self works perfectly apart from this bit. So it seems a bit wasteful but I can't find any information online about having it repaired and I cant find that part.

I started grinding finer for my new beans and this is what every puck looks like.

6 holes in a circle pattern.

I use 18g of coffee and WDT. I am still learning how to distribute, but it is very strange that this circle pattern always forms.

Any idea what this could be? I read somewhere that it is not necessarily channeling, but that it is formed at the end because of pressure.

Any idea?

Thanks!

1jh97ze,https://www.reddit.com/r/psychopath/comments/1jh97ze/saturday_philosophizing_old_timer_talk_about/,Saturday Philosophizing - Old Timer Talk about Camping and Generations,"I’m older so I started life with close to no media. Sure we had a tv with rabbit ears and an outdoor pole that got channels if you rubbed it just right on a sunny day, but there was no internet till my 20s.

By the time internet really made a dent in peoples lives I was 30s, so 00s.  Somewhere in their the smartphone came along and life drastically changed.  The generations below me, I watched as they got disconnected from reality.  

I can describe it happening.  I go to extended camping festivals in the woods for decades.  It’s survivalist, primitive camping deep on the forest started by hippies.  All of us there came with lots of knowledge.  Our parents threw us out the door all day and we’d taught ourselves how to make it.  

Then came 00s and a full flush of hipsters all showed up in their scruffy beards, claiming they loved gourmet pancakes, chopping wood, and designer coffee.  Standing their in their name brand camping clothes, oiled beards, even carrying axes, they certainly looked the part.  Except most of them didn’t even know how to fix a pancake, how to chop wood, nor even how to dig a hole to poop in it.  

**Their identity was based on their online presence. **

They had joined their virtual tribes.  They’d shared in their virtual echo chambers.  They’d clung together online.  The worst part?

The worst part was most of them had no interest in learning.  There came to be a bit of tension as they clung together not integrating with the rest of us. This went on a few years. 

I recall perfectly one sunny morning, they invited everyone to one of their group camps.  It was a perfect blue sky Michigan morning so I grabbed my mom from the tent, I said let’s go.  It was a huge lovely ring of them sitting in tender flowers.  We will resolve this, I thought.

Except we didn’t.  Year was now 2010s and new era was being ushered in.  There was no breakfast.  Breakfast they said was bad for us, they passed around some bland coffee and nuts in a bag if we wanted them and then proceeded to lecture us for over an hour about what bad people all us older people are and we need to do things their way- the non-bigoted way. 

I realized new era dawned that day.  Gone were the Millenials that had had a few members like us and in where the younger Millennials who literally said to us, “the planet would be better if we all day because we failed to make a better world and had been greedy.”  

I looked around the circle that day. I realized they were no longer dressed “as fake campers” but were something that all looked like Kurt Cobain remixes.

I lived through campers of the 90s who all sorts looked like Kurt Cobain remixes.  We smoked banana peels, sang poetry from top of our lungs, guitars strummed and we sang Velvet Underground lyrics together,, clanged drum into the morning and night.  

I sat awaiting several hours and realized all they were going to do was complain as they lay spread out.  When it came time to smoke weed, they left and went in little young groups among themselves. Good bless old weed circles!!! We smoked them all or none for anyone!

I returned home and watched as the new dawn was going to be people patrolling the the internet.  The goal?  Well, the words virtue signaling got invented and it became clear humanities new hobby was going to be finding things to get mad about.  

Now this virtue signaling is all based on the premise that other people care about you and that you actually have the power to change them through words harped online.  

All these people have all these fucks to give cause they think it all matters so damn much.   They actually are thinking people give a shit about their opinions. 

As a psychopath,  I know for sure that other people do not give a fuck about me.  It’s a given.  Two way street.   I always felt the same way back. Silent agreement.  

What’s left?

Oh for sure, the thing any psychopath worth a grain of salt knew all along.  You live your life to the fullest.  You go have a great time.  You go gravitate to those having a great time and partake in it with them. 

The thing is…it doesn’t seem like that exist anymore.   

That’s the end of my lament. Don’t bother telling me it doesn’t have anything to do with psychopathy.  I don’t care.

1jh97u3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenAdvice/comments/1jh97u3/how_do_i_stop_caring_about_women/,How do I stop caring about women?,"*Not in the ""I hate women"" way, obviously.*

I (27m) lost my virginity at 24 and hated everything about being a virgin. I've had sex twice, only one date and never had a girlfriend. I also have no female friends.

The sole reason is because I don't meet enough women, like at all. This has lead to being constantly anxious, shit confidence and extremely low self-esteem.

It's got so bad that I don't visit my local coffee shop anymore due to the attractive women who work there, as I'm always a jittery mess.

Alcohol in bars also don't help, as I feel the sadness overcome and often cry myself to sleep. For this reason alone, i no longer drink alcohol.

Despite keeping myself busy with friends, family, work and hobbies, women are always on my mind, specifically how I've never had any luck and that I hate myself because of it.

My number one goal in life is to stop thinking about dating, relationships, sex and women in general. I'm 99% certain my life would be better off.

I hear the stories (and see proof) of what my friends get upto, and it makes me extremely jealous, but I've never shown it while with them.

I already know that some people will label me an incel, but I'm not an incel as they blame others for their problems, while I'm blaming myself.

It's been said numerous times that casual sex won't make you happy, but it sure as hell makes you more confidence, which in turn will make you feel happier, it's an upwards spiral.",1,1742652450.0,AskMenAdvice,2,1.0,False

1jh92x4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jh92x4,[Routine Help],"Hi! Hoping for some constructive input

I was on spironolactone for ~10 years for help with acne and possible PCOS. After some lab work my primary said my potassium levels were “dangerously high“ and they said to stop all potassium supplements and a follow up with my derm about the spironolactone. I was about to go on vacation out of the country, couldn’t get a hold of my dermatologist so I panicked and stopped taking the spironolactone cold turkey. I didn’t have any issues until my cycle this month. I broke out in inflamed, acne all over my face. And some deep almost cyst like blackheads. My skin was not perfect even on spironolactone. I would still have one or two cystic pimples around my cycle, and still had blackheads. I was still fine-tuning my routine. But nothing like this. I’ve been on Tretinoin for ~2.5 years, on 0.05 for the past 9 months and had worked my way up to 5 nights a week, and TO SA mask the other 2 nights. I switched from sweet almond oil to rose hip oil bc of the benefits for aging skin about a month prior to this. Nothing changed in my routine around the exact time of the breakouts, and the only things I’ve changed since are: added TO SA serum to mornings bc the mask seemed to help calm this down, increased BP wash to 2x a day and let sit for 10 min. And switched in vaseline for aquaphor, adding it in the mornings under eyes, and any dry spots. I realized that elevated potassium was at the same time I was on a lentil kick and was eating a shit ton of lentils lol so that likely caused the potassium spike. My diet hasn’t changed, I eat healthy, nutrient dense foods and only drink water and coffee. I just started back on spironolactone and have an appt with my derm on April 12th. Any input to help until then is greatly appreciated because this is driving me crazy. I’m 34 and feel like I’m back in highschool 😭

1jh92i8,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1jh92i8/my_28m_morther_in_law_47f_is_attempting_to_pit_my/,My (28M) morther in law (47F) is attempting to pit my girlfriend (25F) against me. What to do?,"My (28M) MIL (47F) keeps making slight attacks against me whenever we visit them (They live 10 minutes away from us). I work home-office and the most common comment she murmurs is ""What a beautiful day to work! Especially outside! How the sun shines! Perfect for some garden work!"". Further they constantly ask me to help them out (they live in a house) and I've always been more than happy to. Whether it's to chop down a tree, help with carrying something, help with some renovations etc. Now here's where I think the problem started. 7-8 months ago they asked me to help them paint one of the rooms, and I was under a lot of stress from work, trying to catch-up on deadlines etc. So I refused and told my SO (25F, we've been together for 2 years) that I can't always give up my free time to help them and that I need to relax or do something to ease my workload. She shared what I said with them and since then - their behavior has completely changed. 

I ignored it for the most part, as I do not like to burden myself with other people's emotions and what ""THEY"" want to do.   
  
Several months ago me and my SO got into a heated argument, due to her distancing herself (We live together) and not sharing anything with me, looking extremely grumpy etc. She then shared that her parents (MIL AND SIL) have been telling her to dump me and find a new man, attempting to bribe her with vacations for her if she dumps me, telling her how she deserves more and how I don't respect NEITHER them nor her, which is BS.

Till this day they fake smile (which they think I don't catch up on lol) and ""welcome"" me whenever we visit them. When I first met them I did the old school approach - Whiskey for her father, flowers and sweets for her mother, I've never raised my voice, nor said anything harsh. I've also never disrespected them or their opinions. I haven't agreed with everything they say, but I politely explain the difference in our ways of thinking. Further from the start of our relationship, until this incident I've been mainly the one that suggests we surprise them with a visit, go for coffee or even sleep there etc.   
  
Now I don't suggest such stuff, but I do not deny it either. Whenever she wants us to visit them - we do.

After that argument, I asked my SO if she had anything  against me checking her messages, out of curiosity, to see what exactly they think of me. She agreed and I went through it with her. We have a strict No Lies and No Hiding rule, yet she attempted to clumsily delete all chat messages, which I caught up on and she began crying. She explained what was deleted, however I do not think this was everything.

Since then her parents are constantly nagging that we don't visit much and suggesting that it's because of me, which she neither confirms nor denies. Her father is about to go crazy etc. However they are most likely unaware of the fact that we USED to visit them so much, due to me suggesting we do it.

Her mother constantly puts remarks such as ""Don't let anyone stop you from doing what you love, from visiting us"" etc., which I take as an attack toward me, due to the fact that she doesn't really communicate with anyone else. I have NEVER stopped my SO from doing what she loves, or visiting them as previously mentioned. In fact I have been supporting her constantly and trying to help her. Her mother also keeps sending 'memes' that I take as sort of agressive, such as If your husband isn't behaving well - I will come and punish him and many more others which I can't really remember at this point.

Since we don't visit that much anymore, her mother sometimes comes to our place (we live in a flat), but never comes up to the apartment, instead she parks her car and calls my SO to go down, meet her and talk a bit.

Her mother also kept asking me to mow their lawn and learn how to clean the pool, which I found ridicilous and politely declined.   
  
Continuing down the line - we go to the Gym 5-6 times a week and we resumed going a month ago, when the temperatures were still not for t-shirts. My SO loves walking and insists we do, but when her mother learned of this she said and I quote ""Make him start the car and take you both to the gym instead of walking"" this isn't the only remark she's made about such things, but is the only one I can think of from the top of my head.  


My relationship with her father was absolutely perfect, until the incident, when I can only assume her mother pitted him against me as well. Until then I was the son he never had (He has 2 daughters from a previous marriage) helping him with renovations and so on.

I've thought about suggesting therapy to my SO for these things, as she CAN'T see anything wrong with her mother's behavior. I am also a bit terrified to bring up the topic, as any time I express that she didn't stand in my corner (As they are her family and when they attack me she doesn't deny nor confirm anything, doesn't come in my defense but USED TO talk against me before the incident) so I am terrified to say anything as any time something like this happens she starts feeling bad about herself and starts thinking about us splitting up.

I am not the type of person to constantly do what everyone else asks of me such as mowing their lawn, cleaning the pool or helping with renovations, which I can only guess my MIL wants of a SIL. I help those who help and respect me and my time.

Nowadays whenever we visit, mostly it's because her mother had been asking her for over a week or two, and they want us there at EXACTLY 6PM (Or if we go at 1PM even better) however as I'm the only one with a driving license I drive. Her mother has never told me me when we are expected, neither has my SO in the end you can guess who's to blame if we arrive late.

My SO is currently unhappy with her job and I've suggested that we open a business together (we both specialize in different fields, however I've had an idea that can work) and told her I want us to build something for us, for our future children. She felt bad and wanted to drop the idea, stating that she wants to work for a major company in her field instead of having our own business, because she needs to communicate with people.   
  
Some time later (Can't say exactly how much), I was feeling down and she suggested I read the chat to see her parents are no longer against us. But what I found was that she and her mother were mocking me for suggesting something like this, calling me names and generally laughing at the idea, suggesting that I do it myself if I want a business so much.

Also, when I read the chat (At the time of the incident) - she had been talking against me as well, suggesting that she sees the good in people and gives chances, and she does not want to rush that decision, but was still talking nasty stuff about me.  


This whole situation had happened before with a friend she had met, while working abroad. When she came back, she used to talk about me to her, insult me and say how she will leave me if I don't ask her more personal questions (She spent 5 months abroad, and we had split up for a bit). When I saw this we had another heated argument, but afterward she had blocked her on all social media and is no longer in contact with her(yes I'm sure, I checked) I had my suspicions of her cheating on me, but she denies all of this and I am not really in the correct headspace for such discussions (Context - I've been cheated on multiple times in the past, my parents also split up due to one of them cheating. And yes - I train and do get compliments of how I look body, face and mind, I'm not a troll or whatsoever). I do believe her, as I asked her many many times about this, but the friend was much like the best friend she never had (Yes I do know about best friends, please don't bring this up)



Before anyone asks - I do love my SO with all my heart, and I do want things to work out, however I am not feeling emotionally okay with her mother's actions 

I'm a patient man, however I'm growing more and more tired of this behavior and the constant attacks launched at me, at the constant attempts to split us up for whatever reason. 

This whole situation confuses me and I don't know what to do.  
So reddit, what approach is best for my SO and MIL to 1. My MIL to back off our relationship. 2. My SO to finally start being in my corner and refusing to let anyone from her family's side talk shit about me?",1,1742652044.0,relationship_advice,0,1.0,False

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

One time his friends stood outside waiting for an hour while he woke up, took a shower and made coffee, just to find out he doesn't want to come. I had to try to get him to communicate and play the guessing game whether or not he will go out with them once he's ready.

Everyone is sick of it and it casts a shadow on an otherwise fun evening when he does this. He won't really communicate about it and seems to believe he isn't doing anything wrong. When he does end up hanging out with us/them, he has fun and doesn't seem at all uncomfortable.

Although his friends clearly care about him, I'm worried that they will eventually stop trying and he will be completely alone. And I don't want to be his secretary/spokesperson either. Any advice? How to get him to fix this behaviour without annoying him and flaring up his ODD?",1,1742651912.0,ADHD,1,1.0,False

I met someone naturally as a friend through a car group; we are enthusiasts of the same car. we are both middle eastern, im 26 and he is now 30.

he Is such a respectful gentleman. over the time ive gotten to know him under the pretence as friends, im slowly developing a crush because he is mostly what I look for in a partner. at car meets he’ll hang around me and make sure im okay and when trucks/cars are passing by he’ll even move me out of the way. recently he’ll call me here and there and we speak for about an hour on the phone each time, and he’s opened up to me about some emotional/deep things. 

well, in one of these phone calls he said he wanted to meet for dinner, and that I wouldn’t have to worry about driving and that he ‘d pick me up, and that he’d throw a rock at my window so that i know that he’s there (I thought that was so cute omg). mind you, we met for coffee and dessert a few times before this and he would pay every time. every time we hang he's always staring at my lips - does this mean anything? and when we went out for dinner and he wouldn’t let me pay, and on our way back home we were sharing and exchanging our music tastes, and he kept taking detours and the longer way back home so that he would listen to my favourite tunes. during this meeting he told me he was getting a lot of pressure to get married from his family.

well, fast forward to today, I post a cute prayer on my instagram story saying that hopefully by next year we’re all with our spouses in houses filled with love and blessings. he replied to it saying “We need to find you a husband!” and I was so shook - what could he mean by that???

and, was the above meeting a DATE? is he interested in me? I genuinely cannot tell. please help me out! or should I just emotionally move on from this due to the lack of clarity :(",1,1742651810.0,datingadvice,1,1.0,False

I use the MIO energy water flavoring. I drink sweet tea still, Alani, Celsius, Reign, whatever. I can drink an entire energy drink and fall asleep.... while simultaneously taking my prescribed stimulant medications (taken as prescribed). One of my medications is supposed to not mix well with caffeine and I've never had a problem with that. 

I do drink about 12 cups of water at least a day if not more. 

I drink coffee and energy drinks for the taste only, not to stay up. I don't really like soda much. 

Anyways, my husband jokes that there's something wrong with me. Am I the only one who seems to be immune to caffeine? Is this a thing or do i have a SERIOUS addiction that I need to address?

Most methods out there are drum roaster specific and roasting on the SR800 is much different than on a drum roaster. For those who do not know me I bought the 800 when it first came out in 2019. I was a SR500 user since 2013. So moving to the SR800 was a natural progression for my coffee roasting. 

In 2015 I also purchased the Behmor 1600 plus and used that until the end of 2024 when I sold it to a local coffee shop for him to use inside. I replaced it with the Sandbox R1. Also the best coffee that I have made has come from the SR800. 

I have the standard chambe that I seldom ever use, the OEM Extension chamber with a 12 inch probe and the chaff extension mesh kit from Razzo on Etsy and also the version 5 of the Razzo 12 inch chamber with the temp probe built into the lower part of the chamber.

I have Artisan but in all honesty I prefer not using it and just tracking my temps  ( ror ) manually with a new coffee to find its roast profile. 

The thing I enjoy the most with this roaster is like the popcorn poppers I learned on you use your senses while you roast with sight, smell, color, sound etc...... And with the temp probes you can follow the roast much easiier and over time it becomes second nature/insticts take over from experience with the machine and you know what to look for as the roast progresses. 

  
Thats a little backround about me and there are lots of helpful learning videos on Youtube from Captians Coffee, Virtual coffee labs and Sweet Marias. 

Maybe one day I will dive into making some videos if and when I learn how to edit lol.

1jh8rei,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1jh8rei/blocking_a_two_year_situationship/,Blocking a two year situationship.,"I (22M) blocked a 32M (bisexual) I was emotionally stuck on for 2 years. It was a situationship that never really began, but consumed me completely. But I still feel bad for blocking him as I don't want him to think badly of me.

I met him on Bumble. He was handsome, confident, a bit older, and from a social circle that felt intimidating - fashion influencers, models, people who seemed “above” my world. From the very beginning, he said he was only into hookups, and yet our chats were warm, thoughtful, and even profound. He was in another city. We were connected for six months before meeting. But he would often reach out, constantly check up on me, ask about studies, university. Helped me a lot during my internship as well. 

Eventually, we met in person. Our first date felt like magic - coffee, good conversation, respectful gestures. He said this was the first time he had taken someone on a date and I looked even beautiful in person. I was flattered. But right after, he ghosted me. I broke that silence myself after some time. He said he was on vacation and was eagerly waiting to meet again. 

I visited his city several times after that for some work and would subtly post stories that I was around. He’d say we’d meet soon, ask if I had place for him to come over (I was at my uncle's so I didn't) and then… nothing. I was heartbroken the first time and went back. Still, he texted that he missed me and had flirty conversations or sexting here and there, but it was always on his terms.

Once, I visited specifically hoping to meet him again and I had place. He made loose plans and then backed out at the last minute, saying he had to take his mother home. I waited until 2:30 a.m. for him. The next day, he said he regretted not coming but never followed up. He said we will meet over coffee. I waited the next two days there but there were no signs of him. That visit ended with me crying, physically unwell, and eventually on anxiety medication after a psychiatric consultation.

I blocked him from everywhere - but I forgot to delete my WhatsApp number from our Insta concert. A month later, he messaged me there. I panicked and blocked him again. Seven months passed, and on Eid, I got a generic message. I stupidly replied. He said he was glad to finally hear from me and that he will visit my city. He didn’t.

Fast forward to this year. He finally came to my city for his work. Contacted me on the way that he will reach in two hours. I went to his hotel. We talked a bit, made out, and I rested my head on his chest - something I had dreamed about for two years. He didn’t bring up the past. I texted him a polite thank - you after I left, and he said he wished I’d stayed longer. I said I didn't want to overstay. Then… nothing. I thought it'd be different but now a month has passed, he didn't contact again. I waited, just like I always had.

So I finally blocked him again. For real this time.

I feel like I’ve been emotionally chained to a fantasy. I thought we had a connection. I thought the deep chats meant something. I thought if I improved myself - hit the gym, worked harder, looked better - he’d finally see me. But he never did.

I still miss the idea of him. I still imagine sleeping on his chest sometimes. Since the last two days after blocking, I have been regretting it that maybe I should have just accepted the reality but everytime there is some hint of him around me, I loose focus and go back to the same downward spiral. Therefore, I block him to have peace. Still, I don't know why but I don't want him to think badly or me or hate me.

TL;DR: I (22M) was stuck in a 2-year on-and-off situationship with a 32M who ghosted me repeatedly. Despite my efforts and emotional investment, he stayed inconsistent. We met again recently, but nothing changed. I’ve finally blocked him to protect my peace but I feel bad now. ",2,1742651084.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

My husband’s 90 year old grandma is in the hospital. She’s getting better and will hopefully go home soon. She went in last weekend to a really bad hospital. My husband and I offered for my in laws to come stay with us (we live 1.5 hours away) and bring her to a better hospital (best in the state) that’s walking distance from our house. We have a guest room with its own bathroom at our house. They said no which I understand but then it was very stressful at the hospital they went to- at a few points she ran out of oxygen and my FIL had to adjust the air flow himself, track down a nurse to get her a new tank which took hours, etc. My MIL doesn’t visit bc his grandma doesn’t like her much. 

My husband works long hours all week and finally can visit today. He drove the 1.5 hours and will stay for a few hours I assume. But his parents want him to go to their apartment nearby the hospital and stay for lunch or for the day or something. A lunch would add at least 2 hours to his visit. I asked my husband if he could please just go to the hospital and come home. We drove to their apartment to visit twice in the past month and his parents have been at our house the other weekends. 

We have 2 under 2 and on the weekends I can finally clean, cook, shop and rest. We offered for my MIL to come to our house today but she laughed at the offer bc apparently it’s a ridiculous idea. 

Am I being unreasonable by asking my husband to just stick to visiting his grandma and coming home? He’s really annoyed that I’m asking this, and I think he might go to their apartment anyway and stay for coffee and lunch anyway.  

It kind of strikes the chord of them retreating to themselves and cutting me out. My husband is their only child and his dad is his grandma’s only child and it can feel a little enmeshy sometimes. ",4,1742651002.0,JUSTNOMIL,2,0.75,False

1jh8phl,https://www.reddit.com/r/bidforautos/comments/1jh8phl/troubleshooting_common_car_problems_a_friendly/,Troubleshooting Common Car Problems: A Friendly Guide,"Troubleshooting Common Car Problems: A Friendly Guide

Cars are great—until they’re not. When your vehicle won't start or makes an unusual noise, it's natural to be worried, but luckily, most problems have straightforward solutions.

This guide will walk you through the most common car issues and how to fix (or at least identify) them, whether you're dealing with a stubborn engine, strange noises, or mysterious dashboard lights.

So, grab a cup of coffee, get your hands a little dirty, and let’s solve this mystery together!


---

1. Car Is Unresponsive

When you turn the key (or press the button) and nothing happens, it’s one of the most frustrating things that can happen. Here's how to figure out what’s going on:

Red Flags:

Clicking sound when you turn the key

Engine cranks but doesn’t engage

No noise or lights at all


Potential Issues and Fixes:

Dead Battery – The most common cause is a dead battery from leaving the lights on or an old battery.
Quick Fix: Try jump-starting the car. If it starts, the battery likely needs charging or replacement.

Bad Starter – If you hear a single click but nothing happens, the starter might be worn out.
Quick Fix: Gently tap the starter with a tool (carefully!) to bring it to life temporarily. If this works, you’ll need to replace the starter soon.

Ignition Switch Problem – If nothing happens at all when you turn the key, the ignition switch or wiring might be the issue.
Quick Fix: Try jiggling the key or pressing the start button a few times. If the car eventually starts, the switch may need to be replaced.


---

2. Check Engine Light Comes On

Seeing the check engine light can make you feel like you’re in trouble, but it’s usually not that bad.

Potential Issues and Fixes:

Loose Gas Cap – A loose or damaged gas cap can trigger the light.
Quick Fix: Tighten the cap until it clicks. If the light stays on, you might need a new cap.

Oxygen Sensor Issue – A faulty sensor can affect fuel mixture and emissions.
Quick Fix: A code reader (available at auto parts stores) can confirm the issue. Sensors are easy to replace yourself.

Catalytic Converter Trouble – If the light comes on and your car smells like rotten eggs or seems sluggish, the catalytic converter might be clogged.
Quick Fix: Unfortunately, you’ll need a mechanic for this one.


---

3. Engine Overheating

If steam is coming from under the hood or the temperature gauge is in the red zone, your engine is overheating. Overheating can cause serious damage, so don’t ignore it.

Potential Issues and Fixes:

Low Coolant – Your engine needs coolant to stay cool.
Quick Fix: Check the coolant level when the engine is cold and top it off if needed.

Leaky Radiator or Hoses – Look for green, orange, or pink puddles under the car.
Quick Fix: If you spot a leak, use radiator sealant as a temporary fix until you can get it repaired.

Broken Thermostat – If the car overheats shortly after starting, the thermostat might be stuck closed.
Quick Fix: This is a mechanic job, but it’s not too expensive.


---

4. Unexplained Engine Sounds

Weird noises coming from the engine are never a good sign. If your car sounds like a rock concert or a dying animal, it’s trying to tell you something.

Potential Issues and Fixes:

Knocking or Ticking Noise – This could mean low oil or poor oil circulation.
Quick Fix: Check the oil level and top it off if needed. If the noise continues, you might need an oil change.

Squealing When Starting or Turning – A loose or worn serpentine belt is the likely cause.
Quick Fix: Tighten or replace the belt.

Grinding or Rattling – This might be loose engine parts or a failing pulley.
Quick Fix: Check under the hood for anything visibly loose. If you can't find it, have a mechanic take a look.


---

5. The Vehicle Is Hesitating or Pulling

If your car feels like it’s drifting or resisting you, don’t fight it—fix it.

Potential Issues and Fixes:

Tire Pressure Imbalance – Uneven tire pressure can cause pulling.
Quick Fix: Check and adjust tire pressure to the recommended levels.

Wheel Misalignment – If the car consistently pulls to one side, the alignment might be off.
Quick Fix: A professional alignment will fix this quickly.

Suspension Issues – Worn or damaged suspension components can also cause pulling.
Quick Fix: If alignment and tire pressure don’t fix the problem, have a mechanic inspect the suspension.


---

6. Brake Issues

Brake problems should never be ignored since they directly affect your safety.

Potential Issues and Fixes:

Soft or Spongy Brake Pedal – This could mean low brake fluid or air in the brake lines.
Quick Fix: Top off the brake fluid. If the issue persists, you might need to bleed the brakes.

Grinding or Squealing Noise – Worn-out brake pads make noise when they’re down to the metal.
Quick Fix: Replace the brake pads immediately to avoid damaging the rotors.

Vibration When Braking – This usually means warped brake rotors.
Quick Fix: Resurfacing the rotors can help, but replacing them is usually a better long-term fix.


---

7. Battery Keeps Dying

If your battery keeps dying, you likely have a charging or drain problem.

Potential Issues and Fixes:

Parasitic Drain – Lights or electronics staying on can drain the battery overnight.
Quick Fix: Make sure everything is turned off when you leave the car.

Bad Alternator – If the battery dies after driving, the alternator might not be charging it properly.
Quick Fix: A mechanic can test and replace the alternator if needed.

Old Battery – Car batteries typically last 3–5 years.
Quick Fix: If your battery is more than five years old, replace it.


---

8. Transmission Trouble

Transmission issues can feel scary, but they’re often manageable.

Potential Issues and Fixes:

Low Transmission Fluid – Slipping, hard shifting, or delayed acceleration can be due to low fluid.
Quick Fix: Check the fluid level and top it off if needed.

Clogged Transmission Filter – A dirty filter can interfere with shifting.
Quick Fix: Replacing the filter isn’t hard if you’re comfortable with tools.

Worn Clutch (Manual Transmission) – If the engine revs but the car doesn’t move, the clutch may be slipping.
Quick Fix: This is a mechanic’s job, but it’s a common repair.


---

Final Thoughts

Cars are machines, and machines break down sometimes. But with a little patience and some basic troubleshooting, you can handle most problems without calling a tow truck.

Regular maintenance—like checking fluids, tire pressure, and brake pads—goes a long way in preventing these issues from happening in the first place.

When in doubt, don’t hesitate to reach out to a trusted mechanic. And remember—you’ve got this!

The only thing that’s getting in the way is the fact that I have a HUGE APPETITE, I am always thinking about my next meal, get hungry so easily, and my food noise is so loud. I’ve tried natural remedies like drinking coffee and even nicotine but it doesn’t make a difference honestly. Anyone know any otc supplements I can use to help me decrease my appetite?

She once said she can't have fun because of not having a boyfriend.,"On a Friday night were out at a coffee shop with another mutual female friend. My LO called a girl friend of hers who was out with her boyfriend for dinner and made plans to go home with this friend after they were done with dinner.

After the call she sighed and said all of her friends are having fun. I asked ""what's holding you back?"".
She said ""not having a boyfriend!"". Immediately after that she changed the topic.

This is what burns me up a lot. She is single AF and looking to date. She's not on dating apps (she deleted them after a day). She socializes a lot but doesn't have a boyfriend yet often cribs at not having one. And then she says she can't find one worthy of dating.

I don't know if she wants me to make a move on her. She has refused to hang out with me one on one on a few occasions. I guess she has high standards and I don't meet those. The fact that she's single and looking to date but she doesn't like me back is very depressing for me.

1jh8mn9,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jh8mn9,impressions of long term ownership of 8j competition,"i don’t know what struck me to make this post today but my gf is still sleeping and i’m having a coffee so here we are. 

i have owned my 2013 TT for almost 8yrs. that is nearly twice as long as any car i have ever owned.

i bought the car as second owner with 62xxx kms on it in pristine condition (except for at times during the first year the faint smell of cigs) with a complete and comprehensive service history. car was previously leased by a chinese student who went back home post uni (i know this because i worked for the dealership - i had actually worked on the car twice). 

in the first year of ownership i had a friend who owns a custom exhaust shop make me a stainless 3” downpipe with a 200 cell race catalyst (like the ones used at the end of system on the TCR racecars). 3” stainless pipe continued and then reduced to the stock rear box. this ended up being pretty loud(turns out the rear box does nothing). a 4” stainless resonator was fitted mid system a few weeks later. low rumble and no raspy tones on throttle. no droning, mild burbles on decel and the WOT shifts are like gunshots. it’s perfect imho.

shortly after this i did the unitronic stage 1 tune. 

braided brake lines were fitted and i’ve gone through trying a few different performance pad sets up front (i do lapping days). otherwise all brake components are OEM. these cars are not super fast and are effectively momentum cars so big brake kits are truly not needed on the tracks i have run it on (CTMP/mosport GP track and the DDT) imho. no brakes, no mistakes they say lol. (***edit: i know someone will comment that big brake kits are required and that’s fine but consider i am an audi master tech of two decades as well as having worked in motorsports for many of those years and then full time as a car chief in professional sportscar racing after leaving the dealer network. additionally, many of my friends are actual active professional racecar drivers and i have many hours of coaching from them. by comparison, i am mediocre but i am far from an average track day guy)

i think in the third year i did a full refresh of every ball joint and bushing and installed bilsteins.

after melting the continental tires the car came with i have only run michelin pilot sport 4S (i am aware other tires exist but i like these tires a lot for a multitude of reasons) on the stock 19x9 rotor wheels for summers. i think i am on my 5th set now. 

i have two sets of winters: 18x8 audi sport wheels with nokian hakkapelita R5s and 19x8 RS3 winters with studded nokian hakkapelita 10s (i go to northern quebec for work sometimes and have needed these. also was able to drive the car on frozen lakes before - pretty cool experience if you can have it).

a couple years ago i decided that my wheels were looking a bit tired and the black was a bit too ‘boy racer’ for someone in their 40s now. i had them professionally powder coated in the correct audi paint code to silver like on the TTRS. 

from a maintenance and mechanical standpoint, the car has been near flawless. i keep up with maintenance and have had only a few small issues with the car that were solved easily. i would say it has cost me no more than ownership of a basic VW golf.

all of the above said, my favourite part of these cars is the interior. it might just be perfect. i can wax poetic about the seats and the wheel being directly pulled from the first gen R8, how the build quality is nearly unrivalled at this price point and how the trims after so many kilometres are still quiet with no cabin rattles(except the rear seat speaker grilles but you can solve that by fitting some foam in them)

my car now has 258xxx kms on it. 
i’ve had a lot of fun in this car. i drive it year round. it’s taken me lots of places. oddly, it has become an important part of my life even tho it is just a car. it’s a metaphor for some big changes that came for me around the time of purchase and i’m never going to part with it. one day the engine will die and i’ll just get her another one because it’s like family now. that sounds really dumb but in a weird way it’s true. 

tl;dr - i like my car. it’s good. ",6,1742650681.0,AudiTT_Mk1_Mk2_Mk3,1,1.0,False

There are periods when i am feeling better and then there are periods where it gets really, really bad and really hard to deal with. To make long story short, i’ve been mostly fine until few months ago when mostly thanks to my gastric issue my anxiety returned. I’ve been having heart palpitations and what feels like fluttering in my diaphragm and left side, sensations that feel like a heartbeat skips and staying out of breath for a second. Went to few doctors and they said that it’s because of my eating, weight and gastric issues. I would have almost constant acid, sour feeling in the mouth, burping, pain in the stomach, left side and even upper back… But like i said it started getting worse.
One thing that i can’t figure out is this sudden tingling sensation i get, usually on the left side of my head/scalp. I am not sure should i, but i am connecting this to my stomach/left side issues and i feel like it somehow comes from there (large intestine?) and is giving me this sudden sensation usually on the same, left side of my head. It doesn’t seem to be a single spot, sometimes it will be more on the front left part, sometimes in the back and it lasts for few seconds. I feel like i usually get it if i have a coffee and when i am being anxious and having this weird feeling in my head and eyes area.

I know that this might sound maybe strange to some of you, but i just wanted to ask was anyone ever dealing with something similar and what can i do to figure out what is the cause of this exactly. Like i said, i am also very anxious and dealing with other issues too, like sinuses, heart palpitations, panic attacks that i am trying to deal with but my main problem have been gastric and stomach issues that have been going for too long and that i guess are also getting much worse thanks to my anxiety and stress.

Day 1 -

Landed in Dublin at 530am. Immediately drove towards Cork City. Stopped in Cashel for a small walk, coffee and bite to eat. Arrived in Cork, and explored the city on foot... absolutely loved it. Dinner at Prosby's.

Day 2 -

Spent the full day in Cork, went to the old jail, markets, the university, cathedral, and pub hopped. Dinner at Woodford.

Day 3 -

Leave Cork, stopped at the Blarney Castle for a couple hours. Head to Caherdaniel which was about mid-way around the Ring of Kerry. Absolutely beautiful and had dinner at the Blind Piper.

Day 4 -

Leave Caherdaniel to complete the Ring of Kerry, and head towards Galway. Stop at the Cliff's of Moher on the way and checked into Galway on March 16th (St Paddys). Checked out the shenanigans, pub hopped. Dinner at John Keog's Gastropub.

Day 5 -

St Paddys parade in Galway, breakfast at Ard Bia at Nimmos (brilliant), and walked around some of the St Paddys chaos. Dinner at Kirwan's Lane.

Day 6 -

Head to Dublin. Stop in Athlone for lunch. Drop off rental car, and walk to the Guinness Storehouse, drink at Temple Bar. Dinner at Little Pyg (top 100 pizza in the world).

Day 7 -

Walk around Dublin, quick toastie for lunch. Headed to Howth by train for a pier walk and dinner at Octopussy.

Day 8 -

Fly home.

I share all the dinner spots because everything was absolutely delicious and I'd recommend any of the above restaurants.

We ranked our favorite to least favorite stops. #1 Cork City, #2 Caherdaniel/Ring of Kerry, #3 Galway, and #4 Dublin.

Galway was hectic for St. Paddys. But, that is expected.

Driving wasn't terrible and we didn't feel like we drove ""too much"". It was a great balance, and gave us time to see everything we wanted to.

It was not like anything I had ever experienced before including because it was totaly unexpected, subject call length, her intensity and my interest in her all combined.

We met for coffee only half a day later and are getting along fine. However, she now says she is no longer interested in anything. I told her I was disappointed. No one else was involved and she is not seeing anyone.

I asked her why she called me and just got a blank face, with no answer. To me, she now looked guilty and had no answer including respectful to say to me.

What was the purpose for either her or me, she never laughed at the time if it was a joke. It seemed genuine to me. I do not know now if I should see it as a compliment or a piss-take. It depends on how I am feel at any moment. I have messages and asked but no reply on this subject. Do I deserve a better answer apology? We have met up since and been are normal selves.

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

A café in Berlin. A dingy table with an empty plate sits in the middle. The smell of stale coffee lingers. Marx, Hegel, and Simone de Beauvoir sit around the table.

**Marx:** (gesturing to the waiter) I’ll have the sandwich, but no mustard on it, please. 

**Waiter:** (nods and leaves)

Hegel looks at Marx intently, his glasses gleaming in the dim light.

**Hegel:** (pontificating) You see, Marx, the absence of mustard represents a contradiction. The sandwich, as a synthesis, relies on all components—mustard included. By rejecting the mustard, you disrupt the dialectic!

**Marx:** (gritting his teeth) I didn’t ask for mustard, Hegel! It’s my choice, my labor, my sandwich!

**Simone:** (leaning forward, exasperated) You’re both missing the point. It's not about mustard or philosophy. It's about the structures that make you believe the mustard matters. 

The waiter returns, presenting a sandwich—no mustard. Marx looks at it with disdain.

**Marx:** (to the waiter) You’ve failed me.

**Hegel:** (gesturing grandly) This is the moral dilemma! You, Marx, are complicit in the failure of this system. 

**Simone:** (rolling her eyes) You’re both idiots. (grabs the sandwich) It’s simple: you speak of oppression, but what you need is agency. (she adds mustard to the sandwich) There. Now, enjoy your sandwich without guilt.

Marx and Hegel stare at each other. Slowly, they lean in, lips meeting in an unexpected kiss. They’re tonguing each other with reckless abandon, slobbering all over the table. 

**Marx:** (pulling back) I think I understand now.

**Hegel:** (smiling) The synthesis is... sweet.

**Simone:** (smirking) Finally.",2,1742650100.0,badphilosophy,0,1.0,False

recently bought a nespresso vertuo machine and got a reusable pod that i’ve been filling up with pre-ground espresso from different makers.

i like to just let the coffee run until it fills up the whole cup and have never had any issues with the crema build up on other machines until this one.

the crema is so thick that by the time i scoop it all out, only half of the cup is full. this happens when making and brewing smaller quantities as well, like in a smaller espresso cup.

So to give context my bf (18M) ( 19 this year) and has his own place, his house is a one bed room and is currently in the middle of being done up, there’s no doors on their hinges right now, all of that does not bother me atm as it takes a little time for these things to get fixed BUT his mum comes to stay at his house regularly, with no bed, no sleeping bag, simply on the floor with some wee fold out mattress looking thing that she bought for his house, a duvet and pillow because his couch isn’t quite big enough for her to sleep on. last night she decided she wanted to stay at my bfs house, me and my bf were asleep and she woke us up at 2AM to tell my bf that the T.V was to loud in our room and she could hear it… like yeah there’s no doors but okay(the volume was at 4 out of 100 at the time) then this morning at 7 Am she woke us up again with excessive banning while trying to do my bfs dishes. Safe to say I was not a happy bunny but to top it off while my bf went to ask her to be quite because she woke us up, he then proceeded to make his mum a coffee (after she asked him) with the coffee machine that’s also SO loud. I don’t do well with no sleep (as you can probably tell) and by this point I was fkng raging, They are currently now away shopping so hints why I’m writing this in my sleepy raging state in bed lmao (but not really). 
Some other things for context, this is the same women who had a melt down aka had a go had a go at my bf last year for bringing me out with them too much in the car when she came over to visit. She apparently ended up saying some thing along the lines of “how would u feel if I got a boyfriend and brung him every where” and I think that’s when the some red flags started popping up for me. I eventually started noticing that she would face time and call him every day multiple times a day and I mean like 5- 10 phone calls a day and there would also be a consistent stream of messages everyday on top of that (which we have discussed together as a couple a few weeks back as I started to worry for his mental health and it appears to have gotten better but I won’t get to much into that as that was a very personal issue for my bf.) she now only phones him when she goes to work, when she comes from back work, at night times to say good night and the occasional morning aswell it’s been like this for pretty much our whole relationship (we’ve been dating for about a year and a half). I’ve also heard this lady times say things like “awk your so handsome you look so much like your dad” things like “mammies here now I’ll tidy for u”. I have never been in a relationship before where my partner was this close with his mother and at first I thought it was really sweet but now I’m begging to wonder if it’s actually unhealthy and a bit strange. She’s not with his dad anymore and hasn’t been for years and doesn’t seem to engage with any friends ever, she just likes to work and spend time with her son and family. (She Is a lovley women)but I’ve tried to bring up this topic up but it’s definitely not an easy one when it come to someone’s family and really I think she maybe be struggling mentally and due to an extremely sad situation in the family that happened middle of last year but I can’t get into for privacy reasons. When I did present some issues that made me feel a bit uncomfortable for example his mum sleeping on the floor with no doors in the house, I was met with some unstanding and then a “I know it’s a little bit strange but it’s not” I literally just face palmed and said nothing more. I need some serious advice as I’m begging to feel uncomfortable and a bit intruded in my relationship, Do I bring up the way I feel ? And if I do what are the possible solutions ? or am I genuinely just being Silly as me and my parents have never been this close and I’ve never known any of my friends to be this close to their parents either, so maybe the reason why it’s not sitting well with me is because I’m not used to it?

# 🕔 6:00 AM - Wake Up

* I try to wake up at the same time every day to keep my circadian rhythm in sync. No snooze button! 😴
* I take a few minutes to stretch and drink a glass of water (staying hydrated is key).

# 🧘‍♂️ 6:05 AM - Meditation (10 minutes)

* I use a guided meditation app (Headspace or Calm) to clear my mind. It helps me get centered and calm before the chaos of the day starts.

# 🏋️‍♀️ 6:15 AM - Quick Workout (15 minutes)

* I do a combination of bodyweight exercises like push-ups, squats, planks, and jumping jacks. It’s a quick but effective way to get my blood flowing and wake up my body.

# 🛀 6:30 AM - Shower & Freshen Up (10 minutes)

* A quick shower to feel clean and refreshed. I use this time to mentally prepare for the day.

# 🍳 6:40 AM - Healthy Breakfast (15 minutes)

* I keep breakfast simple: oatmeal with berries and nuts, or a smoothie if I’m running short on time. I also make sure to have a coffee or green tea to kickstart my energy.

# 📒 6:55 AM - Plan the Day (5 minutes)

* I spend a few minutes reviewing my to-do list for the day and prioritize the most important tasks. I also set one ""big goal"" for the day so I stay focused.

# 🚪 7:00 AM - Ready to Go!

# Tl;dr Ranking

**Zara - A Sweet Pastry in Paris** \- Worst lemon note of the lot, too sweet and too astringent at the same time - I think this is closest to Akro Bake which has a better blend (though Zara came first!) - **4/10**

**Dolce & Gabanna - Devotion** \- Quickly veers into sickly sweet due to a prominent orange blossom note that isn't to my personal taste - **5/10**

**Theodoros Kalotinis - Lemon Tart** \- Muddled with 'Pledge' lemon, poor performance but this gets the 'pastry' note right- **6/10**

**Liis - Choux Choux -** Super creamy, airy and lactonic, very poor performance- **7/10**

**Akro - Bake** \- The most realistic gourmand of the lot but still very 'wearable', poor performance- **7/10**

**Xerjoff - Lira** \- The richest and most complex of the bunch, good performance- **8/10**

**Kerosene - Unknown Pleasures**\- Beautiful aromatic lemon tea cake, perfect level of sweetness, good performance - **9/10**

**Lush - Chelsea Morning**\- Super rich sticky toffee pudding with a squeeze of lemon, amazing performance (& good price) - **9/10**



# Xeroff - Lira (2011)

**Notes:**

**Top:** Blood Orange, Bergamot, Lavender

**Middle:** Cinnamon, Licorice, Jasmine

**Base:** Vanilla, Caramel, Musk

I LOVE the vanilla/caramel combo on the opening, a toned down [Bianco Latte](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Giardini-Di-Toscana/Bianco-Latte-64757.html), though the caramel quickly blends.

The next phase has a lot of licorice and lavender notes. I love licorice in sweet perfumes as I feel like the anis accord controls them from becoming sickly (see: [Pink Sugar](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Aquolina/Pink-Sugar-975.html) which I think is a misunderstood masterpiece)

I also pick up the citrus throughout- nearly every review of this says the blood orange note smells more like lemon but it's blood orange to me, tied to the caramel and licorice notes. This is rich, decadent, though not as 'cakey/gourmand' as some say. I pick up a sillage of orange vanilla which feels more creamsicle than cake..

The drydown has a lot of depth and richness, sticky caramelly orange.

On my first wear of this I thought the performance wasn't great but I wore this for bed a couple of times to use up the sample and I still smelled it in the morning - so lovely to wake up to!

**8/10**



# Kerosene - Unknown Pleasures (2013)

**Notes:**

Lemon, Caramel, Vanilla, Earl Grey Tea, Bergamot, Honey, Tonka Bean

This is a fresher, lighter take on this trend - opening is very bright, full of freshly squeezed lemon, and the earl grey tea note adds an aromatic, yes, tea-like vibe. 

The honey is in there too, smells like a set New Zealand clover honey rather than 'runny' honey.

The drydown is a tea-infused lemon cake, the caramel is different to what I am used to with caramel notes too, this isn't super sweet.

I think this is so beautiful and it lasts - there is something SO familiar to me in this, I think it is powdered pistachio turkish delight, which is unexpected - not the taste but the smell, nutty with lots of powdered sugar!

I love this take on the citrus vanilla trend - lighter and more aromatic but still sweet and yummy - this is a huge winner for me. It's so beautiful. It would be full bottle worthy if it was in my budget! The scent lasted all day for me, I'm so impressed. 

**9/10**



# Zara - A Sweet Pastry in Paris (2020)

**Notes:**

**Top:** Lemon

**Middle:** Sugar Cane

**Base:** Vanilla

*Note that this is the recent rerelease rather than the original.* 

The lemon is overwhelmingly strong on first spray and unfortunately I do get the 'toilet cleaner' vibe from this lemon note - this is a clash of sweet and astringent/screechy on opening.

I kind of hate the drydown of this - reviews say it gives a buttery pastry note in the drydown but I'm not getting that. Possibly a reformulation on rerelease. It's just too much sugar and toilet cleaner lemon.

I love Zara perfumes but smelling this after smelling more expensive takes on this scent profile, I'm not a fan. Shame as I don't think Zara was trying to dupe anything with this release.

**4/10**



# Theodoros Kalotinis - Lemon Tart (2023)

**Notes:**

Lemon Zest, Lemon, Vanilla, Whipped Cream, Butter, Sugar, Tartine

Opening is, surprise, a super realistic lemon tart! - the citrus notes feel more like sweet lemon curd or lemon candy rather than freshly squeezed lemon juice - then there's pastry in there too, like a buttery shortcrust pastry, or shortbread. I think this is the first time I've ever got a 'buttery' vibe from a butter note. 

There's an aromatic note at the back but I am not sure what note that is. Smells a bit like cardamon.

Drydown is a sugared lemon, which sits pretty intimately. I don't really sense the lactonic notes that I was expecting from this. The lemon is a little astringent an 'toilet cleaner'. This does fade and ends up a caramelised lemon zest scent after an hour. Everything I like in the opening leaves this scent pretty quickly.

This also didn't last long on my wrist- a couple of hours.

**6/10**



# Dolce & Gabbana - Devotion (2023)

**Notes:**

**Top** \- Candied Lemon

**Middle -** Panacotta, Orange Blossom, Rum 

**Base -** Vanilla

*My bf & I always quote the ad for this where the Italian grandma sees Katy Perry & goes 'bella!' - told him I am testing the 'bella!' perfume. I am going to Italy next month and will be very upset if an Italian grandma isn't entranced by my beauty & calls me 'bella!'.*

I like the lemon in the opening, there's always the 'toilet cleaner' danger with these perfumes (& I'm not really sure how to describe the difference between 'good' lemon and 'toilet cleaner' lemon, just seems to be vibes-based so take what I say with a pinch of salt - maybe you use better toilet cleaners than me) but this is a very sweet lemon, the note is 'candied lemon' and I definitely smell that - a tiny bit of tartness on first spray but quickly turns into sweet limoncello citrus.

This feels like the most teen-leaning version of this trend, which isn't a negative comment, I have plenty of perfumes that are popular with teens, I can just imagine this being my signature scent as a teen.

I got up to grab a coffee about half an hour into spraying and the sillage was so noticeable to me - definitely projects well on my skin BUT there is a note that is bothering me and I think it's the orange blossom. It's so noticeable and sickly sweet to me, reminds me a bit of Kilian's Love Don't Be Shy which I also struggled with (much to my disappointment, it was the first sample I ever ordered!). 

Not a scrubber but that orange blossom note is way more prominent to me than I was expecting- it takes over the vanilla.

This lasted ages - sillage around 4 hours, could smell on my wrist after 8.

I do love sweet perfumes, but this kind of sweetness was a bit sickly for me - orange blossom lovers will like this but it was too much for me.

**5/10**



# Akro Bake (2023)

**Notes:**

**Top:** Lemon Zest, Rum 

**Middle:** Whipped Cream, Praline

**Base:** Bourbon Vanilla, Brown Sugar

This feels far more of a realistic gourmand than Lemon Tart - I think the most realistic lemon note I've smelled on opening from this set of samples, avoids screechiness and blends right from the first sniff. 

This scent is so so yummy, smells like lemon curd and pastry as it's being baked - the vanilla note smells like vanilla extract, adding to the 'baked' vibe.

The brown sugar note comes out in the drydown, which is really yummy with good sillage- I smell just like a lemon cake.

This is sweet but avoids sickly, a lot of reviews compare this to Devotion but it feels like a different beast to me - I think this is a 'wearable' (for me) gourmand. It takes me back to my childhood - I grew up in a place called Shrewsbury, the home of 'Shrewsbury Biscuits' (literally just lemon zest biscuits) and this reminds me of making them with my Mum. 

The name really matches the scent - feels like the essence of baking a cake, I think this is a beautiful and well-blended scent.

Unfortunately this doesn't last - 1.5 hours in and I can barely smell on my wrist, my skin ate this up!

**7/10**



# Liis - Choux Choux (2024)

**Notes:** 

**Top -** Whipped Cream, Lemon Zest

**Middle -** Vanilla, Caramel, Salt

**Base -** Sandalwood, Cocoa, Mocha

I love this opening - super creamy, lactonic whipped cream and sandalwood, with lemon in the background that then pushes forward- this definitely feels like a 'zest' note, slightly waxy and a lot more 'part of the blend' rather than feeling separated like some of others I've tested (the citrus was also well-blended in Lira). 

Though zesty, the lemon isn't tart - this is so soft and pillowy - not really picking up on the cocoa and mocha base notes. There's definitely vibes of [Zadig & Voltaire This is Her](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Zadig-Voltaire/This-is-Her-39358.html) as this dries down, I pick up the same sweetness and creaminess. I do love a dominant whipped cream note and that's what I am mostly picking up.

However, the lemon completely disappears around 15 mins in, just a slight tartness in the drydown - probably the weakest lemon note I have experienced so far. I actually get a bit of coconut in the drydown, this feels like a soft coconut milk scent, airy and fluffy.

My one issue with this perfume is the performance. It is very soft with intimate projection on my skin, and it hardly lasts - gone in three hours.

**7/10**



# Lush - Chelsea Morning (2024)

**Notes:** 

Toffee, Lemon, Vanilla, Tonka Bean, Fenugreek, Myrtle

You have to give this one a little time as I have found with Lush perfumes, the opening feels a bit 'much' - tonnes of strong tart lemon, but the magic starts a few minutes in - as the lemon blends in, this turns into the most gorgeous sticky toffee pudding scent. Sticky toffee pudding is a popular dish in the UK, and this reminds me of the 'posh' versions they sell for two quid more in the supermarket - these ones tend to be made with chopped dates in the sponge, I get date-infused toffee sponge with a squeeze of lemon on the top. 

This IS undeniably sweet but it's the sweet I like - it doesn't feel sicky to my nose, I wonder if the fenugreek and myrtle is what is adding a slightly aromatic base to keep the sweetness under control. 

This is perfect for cold weather, it has a depth and richness that I wasn't expecting and it lasts all day - 8+ hours easy. Incredible performance for an excellent price.

I did end up buying a 30 ml bottle of this - I find very few true gourmands like this 'wearable' (especially outside my flat) but I have worn this around people a few times now and I always get positive comments from friends. This is also my boyfriend's favourite perfume that I wear. Great purchase!

1jh85fd,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1jh85fd/best_caffeine_replacement_adaptogens/,Best caffeine replacement - adaptogens.,"I have been caffeine free for more than 6 months now, and not only I don't want to go back to it, but also I don't see any reason to. This is because I found something that is successfully solving the same problem that caffeine was solving for me - **adaptogens.**

I really wish I knew more about them  when I just started the decaf journey and was going through withdrawals, specifically about their stimulating effects and potential to fully replace caffeine. 

Let's be honest, we all love the energy boost the caffeine gives. Otherwise this sub wouldn't exist. That is why it's such a struggle to get off from it, especially in the beginning when the withdrawals hit. Not to mention lots of people also have underlying health issues - anemia, obesity, etc., which makes it even more complex. And that is why I can't recommend enough integrating adaptogens to your routine to help through all the struggle and potentially fully replace caffeine. Here are some of the things I've tried and work well for me. 

•**Siberian ginseng.** Great for daily use, boosts energy levels, improves physical and cognitive performance. Is milder than some of the other adaptogens, works well if you're sensitive to stimulants.

*Note, that it's important to cycle adaptogens, since they stack up in the body and can cause tolerance or side effects like sleep issues. I cycle ginseng like this - 4/5 days on and 3/2 days off. There are other cycling regimens as well.*

•**Rhodiola rosea.** Very potent, not only boosts energy levels, but also acts as a natural antidepressant, improves mood and cognitive performance. Works very well for physical performance as well. I do long distance running and can say it gives atleast a 20% improvement to my pace and overall ability to cover longer distances. 

*Might be too strong for sensitive individuals, I only take it when I have some intense physical activity planned.*

•**Ashwagandha.** Known by many, increases energy levels but isn't stimulating as the other two. Might cause lethargy if not balanced. Great for grounding down the more stimulating adaptogens. I take it together with ginseng daily. 

In my opinion, adaptogens are severely underrated for their potential to provide stimulation. They are amazing because unlike coffee they give a steady energy boost throughout the day without any crashes. And what's important - they have a very high safety profile, they don't create a dependance and you can stop taking them at any time without any side effects. They also reduce systemic inflammation in the body and help combat stress. The worst thing they can do to you is mess with your sleep for a day or two, if you do too much or don't cycle them. They have completely replaced everything that caffeine was solving for me, and more. 

Disclaimer: I'm not a scientist or a physician or a dietician. I'm just a fitness enthusiast and sharing personal experience. Adaptogens might not be safe for everyone and can even cause hormonal imbalances if used in the long term. Please do your own research.

49.

Willa knows where Avery, his Mistress, keeps her sanitary towels. He has tidied her drawer many times when cleaning the Master bedroom.

He needs it to stop the sloppy semen dribbling from his anus where Mr Hunter had so savagely taken him. At the thought of Mr Hunter’s hard body crushing him against the wall, Willa slowly lowers his eyelids, feeling it difficult to breathe.

He emits a sweet little gasp before opening the drawers and locating the large sanitary towels still wrapped in polythene.

Once he has cleaned himself up and had the oddly satisfying experience of pressing the tampon home, he settles on his bed in his maid’s bedroom.

Wow.

Just, wow.

A man has just taken him, and there is no other phrase for it. He has been taken.

Mr Hunter didn’t seek permission or say what he was going to do. He just, well, took Willa.

Willa closes his eyes and draws his hand to his lips.

He has a man’s seed inside him. Actually pumped deep inside.

A part of a man is now part of him and there is nothing he can do about it.

It feels like he has been owned by Mr Hunter, as if the masculine photographer has taken part of him away.

It is scary and delightful. Weird, yet comforting.

Oh my!

He knows he has to return downstairs, but how can he face a man who has done this to him?

Minutes pass like a slow breeze on a summer’s day.

Eventually, he walks downstairs and sees Mr Hunter busying himself in the sitting room with the boxes he brought in.

Electrically, their eyes catch.

Willa needs to say something.

Mr Hunter seems as tall and solid as ever. Something so manly and powerful about his muscular arms.

Willa swallows and says brightly, “Would Sir care for a cup of coffee?”

The photographer stares for a while before saying, “Yeh. That’ll be great.”

Gratefully, Willa rushes to the sanctuary of the kitchen, which, along with his maid’s bedroom, is his own area.

After placing the finished coffee on the table in the sitting room, Willa squeaks, “Sorry, Sir. I have things to do. Bye, well not bye, just see you later. Oh, unless there is anything else you might want …oh! Sorry. I mean coffee. Not that! … I didn’t mean … well, perhaps toast, maybe? I mean …”

Mr Hunter laughs.

His laughter relaxes Willa, who closes his eyes and grins at his own foolishness as he feels his cheeks grow dark red.

“Maid, you are so wonderfully dumb.”

A relaxed Willa giggles, “Thank you, Sir.”

Mr Hunter waves a hand over the boxes, “I’ve got stuff to do here before Marvin and your wife get home.”

“Yes, of course, Sir.”

Again, he performs that odd little bob when someone gives him instructions. It is like half a curtsey. He has performed it before Master when given instructions and now automatically enacts the same motion before Mr Hunter.

Odd.

Willa busies himself with cleaning and tidying around the house, spending a good deal of time on the ensuite in the Master bedroom.

Every now and then he has to stop his housework and just think about Mr Hunter’s sperm inside him. It is a crazy feeling. He needs to chat about it with his Mistress. She must feel the same about having a man inside you.

But can he?

Oh, what will she say?

Nerves make him close his eyes. Will his wife be cross with him?

Master and Mistress return home with the usual sudden energy increase in the house. Also, as usual, they are all over each other.

As a nervous Willa approaches, the Master turns his back so the maid can pull his coat from his shoulders more easily. His Mistress automatically does the same. It is a ritual Willa performs without thought.

“Marvin, you old bastard,” Mr Hunter says from the sitting room.

“Hey!” the Master of the house bellows. “How’d the pictures look?”

Avery rushes into the dining room, “I’ve got to see this!”

Willa hangs the coats in the closet and asks, “Would Master and Mistress like any drinks?”

Marvin doesn’t even turn around. “Yeh, maid. Be a good girl and fetch us all coffees.”

“Yes, Master.”

Again, the little bob. The knees bend, with the body quickly jerking down.

Willa has to make a new coffee pot for everyone and takes a moment to wipe down the counter surfaces with a warm cloth.

“How long’s he been here?”

Avery has entered, closing the door behind her firmly, and is grinning impishly at her blushing maid.

“Oh, well, I don’t know.” Willa feels flustered. “He arrived before ten and …”

“Oh? That randy sod has been with my poor innocent maid for almost two hours? Alone?”

Avery has a huge grin, but Willa stares at the floor, feeling a twist of guilt in his tummy.

“Well, yes, I guess so.”

Avery grabs hold of her maid’s hands and squeezes them.

“So? He say anything? About yesterday and taking advantage of my little maid?”

“Oh Mistress!” Willa so badly wants to share the confidence with his wife, who is becoming his best girly friend. “I, well, I …”

“Come on! I want to hear everything.” Her eyes flash with eager anticipation, urging on her maid. “So he rings the doorbell and then the maid of his dreams appears and … come on!”

Her tone is low as if they are engaged in a conspiracy.

“Oh, Mistress. It wasn’t my fault!”

Suddenly, Avery is concerned. “What did he do?”

“Oh. Well, I said to him to come in. I told him I had to let him in as in my contract it says I must obey all guests. And he is a guest. So …”

“Whoa!” Avery leans in closer, her own cheeks tinged pink with amused shock. “You told him that you had to obey him?”

“Yes, Mistress. Well, it does say so in the contract.” He pauses, wrinkles his nose, “I suppose I shouldn’t have said that.”

“And? Come on. I need to know.”

His Mistress is practically bouncing in her heels.

“Well, he tells me to put my hands on my head.”

“And?”

“Oh. Well, I did so. Honestly, Mistress. I didn’t disobey him.”

Avery laughs. “I bet the randy dog loved that! Then?”

Willa’s cheeks glow hot with shame but he finds himself urged on by his wife’s need to know.

“He tells me to wiggle.”

“Oh, my God. I bet you loved that! And …?”

“Oh. Mistress, he ordered me to turn around. Oh, and to keep wiggling.”

“Jesus Christ! I’d loved to have watched that! So I bet he couldn’t keep his hands off you!”

The door bangs open, Marvin looks grumpy. “Maid. Coffees! You two airheads could gossip all night.”

Avery smiles at the hunk in the doorway. “It’s okay, Sir. Just girl talk.”

For some reason, that satisfies the Bull, who nods and closes the door on the chattering pair.

“Willa, honey. Come on. What he do then?”

It is as if his wife’s enthusiasm for his adventure breaks down all his inhibitions.

“Mistress. He pushed me up against the wall and he …” Willa’s voice falls away into concerned silence.

Their eyes meet. Avery stares at her maid until she laughs, fully understanding what happened without any more chat.

“Oh, my God. He didn’t?”

Willa nods, smiling at his excited wife’s reaction.

Avery grabs her maid and whispers, “He really fucked you? Fucked my maid?”

“Yes, Mistress.”

Stepping back and retaking her maid’s hands, Avery nods her head to one side with a soppy smile. “So now you know what it’s like. When a man completely takes you. You will never feel the same again.”

It is such a relief to share the intimacy with his wife that he feels his entire body relax.

Tears come to Willa’s eyes.

“Mistress, it was so amazing.”

Avery finds her own tears as she shares her maid’s joy.

“Now you know,” Avery sniffs. “Oh my God, you and I are going to have a long chat when we are alone and there’s no men around. So much to share.”

They embrace feeling mutual deep love and understanding.

Avery steps back, growing serious.

“Oh! You must not share any of this with Sir!”

“No, Mistress,” Willa says. No way would he want that bully to know what happened to him.

“Men feel like they own us. Well, you probably feel owned now by Jackson. But for the man of the house there is something proprietorial about the women in his home. Your Master will be worse when one of the twins is a teenager and gets her first boyfriend. It is like they own us and have to protect us. Which is kinda of nice but can be annoying.”

Willa feels aggrieved. “But, Mistress, I am not his daughter or his girl!”

“Babe, you have so much to learn about men.”

Willa smiles. Silly Mistress, she forgets that he is really a man. But he just says, “Yes, Mistress.” Before kissing her on the cheek.

50.

This is turning into an unusually good day for Willa, and good days are cherished by maids.

Becoming closer to his wife, despite being his wife’s maid, is electrifying. He had never felt she was that aroused by him when he was a man.

And now, there was the crazy idea that Mr Hunter found Willa attractive when Willa was dressed as a maid.

Wonderfully, he could gossip with his wife, Avery, about every detail.

Heaven can’t come close.

So when he picks up the tray, made heavy by three mugs of coffee, there is a spring in the maid’s high-heeled footsteps.

As soon as he smiles his way into the hallway, he sees Mr Hunter drilling a section of wall on one side of the mirror. On the other is the adorable picture of Willa, as William with his wife Avery on their wedding day.

Everyone who calls at their home comments on what a wonderful couple they are!

Willa walks into the sitting room, places the tray warily on the table lest he spill any coffee over the cup’s brims, before returning dreamily to the hallway.

He pulls back his shoulders, feeling the straps of his corset tighten around his shoulders and announces, “Coffee is served in the sitting room.”

Everyone ignores him, which makes him roll his eyes.

The attention of his Master, his wife and Mr Hunter is on the section of wall the photographer had just drilled, close to the hallway mirror. Mr Hunter is already raising a large framed photograph into place to hang on the hook he had set into the wall.

There is something pleasing, maybe arousing, about watching Mr Hunter drill the wall and hang up the picture.

Avery is snuggled up in Marvin’s arms, but her eyes are studying the picture intently.

Avery says, “Pull the left hand side down a little. Yeh. That’s it.”

Willa steps closer to see what the picture arousing everyone’s attention is about.

He gasps so loudly the three people turn to see if something is wrong with the maid.

The photo is a perfect family picture of a husband holding his arm around his wife’s shoulder, whilst she holds her baby in her arms. Two grinning six year old children are crushed up to them, beaming with the joy of being in a happy family picture.

But, the children are Willa’s own, Heather and Amy. The wife is Willa’s wife! Avery! And the baby is his.

In his place as husband is Marvin, now Master of the house.

Is this a joke?

A shaken maid wanders towards the door to check his marriage day picture, which is on the other side of the mirror and next to the front door. It is the one all their guests comment upon.

In the picture, Avery is nuzzled up, safe and secure, under the arm of the Bull. They both appear deliriously happy.

“No!”

It is a moment before Willa realises it is he who has shouted out.

He presses his hands hard onto his apron.

“Master! No!”

There is a feeling of sharp fear in many nightmares. That point is when the full horror strikes the sleeper. Only right now, Willa is wide awake. That stab of horror is actually happening.

He has been erased as a husband from the photo in the hallway. Not just as a husband but as a member of the family.

This is going too far.

As his rage steams up through his body, so the corset tightens around his waist in an ever harsher manner.

“I don’t like this!” Willa blurts out. “No!”

The sudden flareup surprises both the Master and Mistress of the house.

It is a moment before Marvin tilts his head to one side and says, “Hey maid. You forgetting? No speaking unless spoken to.”

Folding his bare arms under the small boobs created by the girdle, Willa says. “This is all going too far. The kids will be home soon and …”

A granite hard, stern expression on the Bull’s features brings Willa up short.

Suddenly Willa is defensive, “Master, it’s just this wasn’t discussed. It’s going too far.”

Marvin speaks quietly, his lips barely moving, “I can see one young lady getting the bottom tanning of a lifetime if she’s not careful.”

Avery whispers, “No, Sir, not in front of Mr Hunter.”

Oh my! Willa is suddenly aware of Mr Hunter staring with astonishment at the maid. The last thing he wants is to be spanked in front of Mr Hunter after what had happened between them earlier.

Avery rubs her maid’s arm, “It’s just a little too much for you, right now? Isn’t it Willa? A bit of a shock.”

Her husband’s eyes are unblinking under the spidery false lashes.

“Mistress. This is ridiculous. Like, well, we never talked about … I mean, well, I don’t know. It is all wrong!”

Avery is aware that her maid is playing up in front of two men. She feels foolish and knows she has to stamp her authority on the maid or forever look weak.

“Maid,” she says, stroking her maid’s bare arm, “I know this is difficult for you to process, but I need you to pick up the old pictures of us and carry it down to the garage. You’ll then put them in the large waste container ready for the bin.”

Eh? Willa stares at his wife as if no longer recognising her.

“But, Mistress. Please. He is doing something horrible and …”

Raising her eyebrows Avery’s expression is cold, her lips grow thin. “He? Who is ‘he’?”

It is a moment before Willa realises what she is asking.

He bows his reddening cheeks, “Well. Master. I meant Master.” Then his pleading eyes come back up to fix on those of his wife’s. “But Mistress …”

“Maid. You have been told to carry down the old picture of us to the trash. They belong in another lifetime. You are the maid, and my lover is the Master of the House. You wanted this. This is what is happening.” She softens with an intake of breath. “I know this is hard for you, Honey. But I will not be disobeyed in front of guests. So, be a good girl and take the old unwanted picture down to the rubbish.”

At that moment, Willa feels alone in the world. Trapped. Lost. He is being erased from his family’s life as the male and being replaced by the bullying Marvin.

For a moment there is a stand off, but then, Willa slowly lifts up the picture, which is heavier and more awkward than he realised.

He checks his wife’s face for a reprieve.

There is none and he cannot bring up his eyes to meet those of Marvin or Mr Hunter. He carries the picture down the stairs to the garage where the bins are arranged near the outer double door.

In the cold of the concrete parking area, he finds himself struggling to breathe. There is a tremor of panic hovering nearby. He places the picture over the open bin, staring at the loving couple from another time.

He cannot do it!

Avery is so beautiful in her white wedding dress, with the tight bodice around her body.

He thinks about hiding the picture behind one of the cars, but fears Master will have a check down here later.

He places the framed photo gently in the bin so that it rests against the plastic casing.

Now the hard part: returning upstairs and facing them. A totally defeated maid.

He stood up to his wife and lost. He completely lost face in front of his Master and Mr Hunter.

As his guts swirled around in humiliation so his little dick pushed up against the spike sin the cage. Oh, why he is he like this!

He rests at the top of the stairs near the door, leans against the wall and pushes his fingers beneath his skirt to rub at today’s frilly panties. His back arches as he groans. Somehow his penis doesn’t push out any more, as if at home on its confinement.

He spurts with a little oooh. He then pulls himself together as best he can and opens the door back into the house.

They are no longer in the hallway, but laughing voices reveal they are in the sitting room.

He doesn’t want to go in and let them see him as aroused as this, but a faint hope lingers that they will ask him to bring the picture back. Maybe he can suggest that the picture is simply stored in the garage until they need it again.

Somehow that gives him the courage to enter the sitting room to see Master and Mistress tight together on the sofa drinking their coffees while Mr Hunter is slumped in the chair, his coffee mug on the table before him.

As their voices fall silent, he says breathlessly, “Mistress, I was wondering if we could keep the picture safe for later when …”

Her smile is soft, regretful. “Honey. Listen up.”

He stands to attention, with his hands lightly held before his apron.

“There are the pictures from around the house just next to you on the floor. They are also going into the trash.”

He looks down to see a pile of frames of varying sizes. He has been so used to seeing them around the house that it is odd to see them on the floor, in a scruffy pile. They appear so strange now. Unrecognizable.

Avery curls up her long legs while snuggling into her lover’s body.

“And be a good girl and do it straight away. Let your Master see how well behaved you can be.”

With his stinging tears in his eyes, he complies. The corset grabs him as he crouches down and picks up the pile of framed pictures. The top one shows them all on holiday with the girls in their swimsuits together and him in his bathing shorts holding his sexy bikinied wife.

He has lost it all. All because of his damned fetish!

He lifts, them as delicately as he can, as if they are precious, delicate memories.

His pink lips move but no words emerge, and he silently goes back down to the garage.

This time, despite his care, the pictures crack and then smash as they tumble into the bin.

Now the hot tears roll down his cheeks.

This is so unfair!

He wants Master and Mistress to see how upset he is and sniffs his way back to the sitting room, with the tears fresh on his pink cheeks.

As soon as she sees him, Avery bounces over to him to give him a squeeze.

“Aw maid. Not like you imagined, is it? Being a maid is more than wearing a pretty outfit and swishing around the house in front of everyone.”

“But Mistress …”

In front of Marvin and his friend, Jackson Hunter, Avery becomes a firm loving parent to her foolish maid.

She stares hard at her maid, defying Willa to answer back as she says, “We want these new pictures up so that everyone can see our love for each other.” From where has she gained the sadistic streak? She hears herself say, “and I think you should be thanking your Master for allowing you to remain in his home.”

The tears stop with a jolt.

Willa holds his breath at his wife’s words:  ‘… in his home?’

But this is  their home! Avery and his. His tummy revolves. No, he is now the maid here, and nothing more. It is crazy and ridiculous. And Avery is right, it is what he agreed to.

A cold panic sweeps his mind.

“Mistress,” Willa turns to the Bull, “Master, please. I think this should stop right now.”

Willa is pleased with his confident delivery. He may have been dressed in this adorable rose pink maid’s uniform, with the flouncy apron and heels, but he can, when he wishes, make his views known.

A wicked smile pushes up one side of Marvin’s mouth, and immediately all self-confidence evaporates from the maid like a dead bird falling to earth.

“Maid,” Marvin says in that terrifying even voice that always makes Willa’s heartbeat faster, “Be a good girl and fetch my training shoe from the bag in the coat cupboard. I see we have some naughtiness in front of my guest.”

Willa’s embarrassed quick look at Mr Hunter is sufficient for Willa to know that Mr Hunter doesn’t understand what is happening.

“Erm, Master, if I may say, perhaps we should do this later.”

Marvin shrugs. “Sure. Yeh. When my kids get home.”

“No!” Willa squeals. “Sorry,” he lowers his voice before fixing his eyes on the floor, “I mean, perhaps alter they have gone to bed, and when Mr Hunter has left.”

Avery squeezes up tight to her lover and smiles, “I am sure the maid is very sorry for her silly outburst.” She looks to the man she married who appears anything but a husband with him squirming so entertainingly in his maid’s uniform. “Tell your Master how grateful you are to be allowed to live in his house and serve him and his children.”

As we have seen, in situations of fear, when Willa can actually taste the bile in his mouth, the poor thing’s mind goes blank.

He wants to speak and yet he doesn’t want to.

Marvin says, “Quickly girl. I haven’t all day.”

“Thank you, Master.”

“For what, girl?”

“Oh. Well.” Willa swallows hard. “For allowing me to stay in your home, with your children.”

Like an automaton, Willa makes the few steps to open the hall cupboard door and leans in to unzip Master’s leather sports back. The expensive trainers, the Brookes Ghost16, lay on top of the pile of shorts and shirts.

On returning, Willa, with his pretty pink mouth as circular and open as his eyes, hands one of the trainers to his Master.

Avery says to her Bull, “Perhaps we can wait until Mr Hunter has gone?”

But she speaks without conviction, wanting to see what her man will do next.

Marvin wrinkles his nose.

“Your maid has to learn that if she is naughty in front of guests then she gets punished in front of our guests.” He sighs, as if regretful. “Honestly, it is the best way for her learn her lessons.”

Avery’s tongue darts up to touch her tongue. Why does Marvin’s bullying of her husband so arouse her?

Willa cannot raise his heavy head to look at either his Master or Mistress, and certainly not at Mr Hunter. He feels the hot flush of shame tickle his very soul.

“Of course,” Marvin says, “If the maid wants to resign ...”

He leaves the words ominously floating in the air.

Avery squeezes her eyes, “What do you mean, Sir.”

Marvin is magnanimous.  “If the maid doesn’t like my rules, then I will sort out an apartment for her in the city.”

As the maid gasps, so Avery says, “I don’t get it?”

“If she wants to resign,” he says, as if it is the most logical thought in the world, “then she can remain as our maid and simply travel here by bus every morning from her new apartment.”

Willa speaks quickly, “No Master. Master, you can’t do that. I live here.”

“Well,” Marvin says casually, “so can your replacement maid live in my home with my children and my woman.”

Loving the look of shock on the dumb maid’s features, he rubs it in further. “Don’t worry. Your Mistress or me will call around every couple of days to remove your cage for cleaning. You can keep all your maid clothes there.”

A frantic whirl rushes through the maid’s mind. “Master. No. Please. No!” He turns to his wife, his face open with pleading. “Mistress. He can’t do that. This is our home and  …” he can’t think of anything more to add, so maintains his eyes fixed on his Mistress to help rescue him from this new plight.

Avery wants to burst out laughing at her terrified maid. God! She looks so cute when upset.

“Well,” the hotwife says slowly, “your Master has to make the decisions here. I guess you’ll have to get up an hour early to make the trip over in the morning.”

Willa’s mouth hangs open as if the jaw is broken.

Avery smiles, “I tell you what, why not tell your master how obedient you are and how much you deserve a severe spanking for your naughtiness?”

The escape hatch is opened and Willa dives through.

“Please, Master, please, spank me for being so naughty. I didn’t mean it. Really, honestly. I promise to behave in future.”

Marvin shakes his head in thought as if mulling over the maid’s penitence.

Just as Avery feels she will explode with laughter, Marvin speaks.

“Well, all right then. I will spank you and keep you. How does that sound?”

Willa feels a stone lighter. “Oh thank you Master. Thank you, so much.”

His knees weaken, ready to collapse, and he kneels in gratitude before the bullying lover of his wife.

“Of course,” Marvin says, “I’ll have to keep an eye on you.”

“Yes, Master. Of course, yes. Shall I bend over the chair for you?”

Marvin settles on the sofa, “Over my lap on this occasion. Like the naughty child you are.”

“Yes, Master, of course, Master.”

Willa slides over his Master's thighs, feeling his smooth skirt against the man of the house’s rough trousers.

“I am so grateful, Master.”

Avery needs to get a good view of this and races over to stand next to Mr Hunter’s chair. Mr Hunter also rises, wanting to get a good look at the sexy arse of the maid.

The skirt is raised, and the frilly panties pulled down the maid’s already sore bottom.

Willa knows it will be a harsh spanking, and that it will be before Mr Hunter, but the pain and shame will be worthwhile to show his Master how contrite he is.

Now the spanking is harsh, with stinging slap after stinging slap from the Bull’s trainer, but an odd thing happens after about six spanks.

Marvin orders his maid to keep his head up and look directly at his Mistress and Mr Hunter.

This is obviously soul destroyingly shameful, but, and this is the curious part, as Willa’s eyes rise up he sees Mr Hunter push his thumb into the waistband of his trousers, with his finger spread downwards. He is obviously pulling his jeans forward from his waist.

And then Willa sees it, and for a moment, the pain in his arse vanishes.

There is a long thick bulge in Mr Hunter’s pants. It looks huge.

Willa can hear his wife explaining to him how his interactions with men will change as he learns that men can bring him to orgasm with their thick tools screwing him. A girl or a sissy can’t help but cum when being screwed by a penis. There is nothing they can do to stop it. The man has full control.

Willa emits a low growl, which Marvin mistakes for the sound of his maid crying at her spanking.

The Bull detects an odd rhythmic bucking on his lap, which he assumes is the maid trying to evade the trainer's strokes.

As lovelorn and lustlorn sissies throughout the ages have experienced, Willa spurts a sticky mess into his chastity cage.

He groans again. And again.

Avery puts her fingers to her mouth. Is her maid cumming from being spanked over the knee of her lover?

Oh my God. She and her slutty maid have so much to gossip about once the men have gone!

She can see from hazy expression on Willa’s face that her maid is definitely shaming herself by cumming over the lap of her tormentor. Well, Avery thinks, he can’t ever again complain about he is treated. Because he is loving it!",3,1742649172.0,cuck_femdom_tales,2,1.0,False

I (28FTM) have a couple of neighbors that live on the other side of my duplex. They were fine for the most part aside from the occasional proselytizing, but over the last 5 months they've become almost insufferable. The wife is always knocking on my door, I made the mistake of letting her in once and we had coffee until she started talking about judgement day. After a few minutes of that I asked her to leave and she prayed over me for like 30 seconds while I stood there tapping my foot waiting for her to shut up. The husband is more malicious. I have a doormat that says ""everyone is welcome here"" with little pride flags along the top and bottom, and once I came home to find him rolling it up. When I asked what he was doing he said that it was ""unsightly"" and he was ""doing the neighborhood a favor."" 

I don't know how they found out I was trans, I've been on T for like 12 years and look indistinguishable from a cis guy except for downstairs. But I left for work one morning to find a pamphlet on ""the dangers of HRT"" on my fucking porch. I ripped it up and put it back on theirs. Part of me wanted to light it on fire but that could come with criminal consequences so.

Last week was the last straw. We share a bedroom wall, and for the past week they've been having really, REALLY Christian sex very loudly almost every night. What I mean by that is that I'm kept awake every night with by the wife screaming her head off and saying shit like ""fill me up with God's light"" and ""bless me with your seed."" Fucking nauseating. The only upside is that it usually only lasts for five minutes, lmao. I left them a note asking them to keep it down, and I came home to it ripped up on my porch 🙃. Half the time I don't think they're even fucking. I think they're just yelling through the wall at me.

Here's where my hypothetical comes in. I have a boyfriend, Jesse (30M). We don't live together, and we can get pretty loud during sex as he is very, very good at it and I'm very lucky. Usually we have it at his house out of respect for my neighbors. But I've lost this respect entirely.

WIBTA if I invited my boyfriend over to stay the night and we had really loud, raunchy sex to piss off the neighbors? I asked him and he thought it was hilarious and agreed to do it, but I still feel like a bit of a jerk.

PS. I don't have an issue with Christians in general. I have an issue with Christians who act like this and still claim to be Christian. You know, dickheads.",4,1742649032.0,AITAH,11,0.67,False

We ended up going to get drinks together that night as well as coffee together the next morning. I had a really great time, we got along really well and happened to have a lot in common (including that we both happened to be from the same country, just lived in different states).

We’ve still been occasionally messaging each other and in passing he has mentioned flying over to my home town. I’ve spent maybe a collective of 10 hours with this person. He said he has a few months booked off work to travel and has the first month planned, but after that nothing is set in stone. He’s mentioned that he’s never been to my state so thought it would be a nice chance to see it and me at the same time. I’m not opposed to him coming here, like I mentioned before I had a really great time and really enjoyed his company. He seems to be a very sweet guy and also super respectful. But I thought I’d get opinions from other people to see if this is a bad idea or if I should give it a shot and see what happens. I don’t think he has any plans on crashing at my place, probably stay at a hotel at first and see what happens. 

Also just to add to the general vibe of our meeting, there wasn’t much of a physical aspect to it. At the end of both hangouts he kissed my cheek but that’s the extent of it, but he spoke in a way that hinted more romantic than friendly intentions.

My eating is not the best, I consume about 50g sugar a day from coffee and other snacks / sources.  As you can see there is a drastic change in the last 12 months. I was also working out the day prior to the test. Would like to know your thoughts.

Hopefully this is ok here, posted at /coffee and well, yeah, they don't seem to like any posts at all that aren't from mods...

Anyhoo, my wife surprised me with this beauty for my birthday and I am unsure about a few things - mainly what sort of vintage it might it be, what's it made of, how would I go about cleaning it and lastly, where would I find replacement rubber parts...

It's Swiss made Odette CH-8810, same as this one here, but with a silver finish.

I mainly want to give it a good clean, but don't want to use anything on it that may damage the finish. It's heavy, but is non-magnetic, so not sure what it would be made of. Also the boiler section does not come apart, so what might be the best way to clean inside? I was thinking just put some cafiza and hot water in it and let it soak?

Lastly, the seals on the siphon tube and fill stopper are way past their use-by date. Where on earth would I manage to find replacements? There is an ebay seller that has these, which look like they might be suitable, but I am not sure about actual replacement. There appears to be now way to separate the components, so I assume new seals would be compliant enough to just stretch over and into place? The spigot appears in good enough condition to not require replacement.

How often to water vegetable plants and with how much water?,"I bought two tomatoes plants and a jalapeño plant at Costco 3 weeks ago. All three said full sun and keep soil moist. When I bought them, they were flourishing. Now they seem to have shrunk. The tomato plants are growing tomatoes, though.

I think the planters that came withe the plants is gallon-sized or maybe just over. The planters have an addition that provides like three vertical supports. I did not transfer the plants to a flower bed or larger pot becuase I think the plants may need vertical support given the weight of the tomatoes and jalapenos.

I initially put them on my front patio but I started to question how much sun was full sun, especially in South Florida. I think it was too much because they seemed to be in shock by day 3. 

Then I moved them behind the front patio wall (still too much direct sun) and later moved them under the front patio shade. They seem to be doing better.

I've been watering them every other day with 20 ounces of water each (and spraying them with about 3 to 4 ounces of water on the days I do not water them). On the full watering days, the water coats all of the top soil and some will run out of the base. 

I am cutting off leaves that look wilted (dead or dried out) and leaves that look like a criter has eaten them. I am also checking to make sure no spiders have invaded them.

I added some garden veggie fertilizer and plant food stuff each Sunday from homedepot and add in the used coffee grounds every 3 to 4 days. Then I water them.

They still seem to look deflated. The jalapeño has not produced any jalapeños. Both tomatoe plants are producing tomatoes. But all 3 seem to look a little sad. 

How much sun is full sun in South Florida? Am I under or overwatering? Do I need to water them daily? Should I move them to larger pots and add new soil (won't that traumatize them and how do i make sure they have vertical support)?

I (32M) was engaged to Olivia (30F) for almost two years. We'd been together for five years total, and I genuinely thought she was the person I'd spend my life with. We had the same goals, similar interests, and our families got along great. Everything seemed perfect.

About eight months ago, I came home early from a business trip (cut short by a day) and found Olivia in our bed with her coworker, Jake. I stood there frozen in the doorway while they scrambled to cover themselves up. I didn't yell or throw things - I just felt this overwhelming numbness wash over me.

When Jake left, Olivia broke down crying, saying it had been going on for months and that she'd been feeling ""trapped"" in our relationship. She told me I was ""too predictable,"" ""too safe,"" and that she needed more excitement. Then she hit me with, ""You'll never find someone like me again, Tom. Nobody will ever understand you the way I do.""

I packed my stuff that night and stayed with my brother. The next few months were hell - depression, therapy, the whole nine yards. I lost 15 pounds and barely left my apartment except for work. My sister was worried enough that she started showing up with groceries and forcing me to eat.

Fast forward to last month. I've been slowly putting myself back together. I started going to the gym again, reconnected with friends, and even joined a local hiking group to meet new people. That's where I met Megan.

Megan is nothing like Olivia. Where Olivia was loud and always needed to be the center of attention, Megan is thoughtful and listens more than she speaks. Where Olivia criticized my ""boring"" job in finance, Megan finds it interesting and asks genuine questions about my work. It's only been a few weeks, but there's something there that feels real.

Yesterday, I ran into Olivia at a coffee shop downtown. She looked surprised to see me, especially since I was obviously doing better. She asked if we could talk, and against my better judgment, I agreed.

She told me she'd broken things off with Jake and made a huge mistake. She said she missed me, missed us, and wanted another chance. Then she repeated that line again: ""You'll never find someone like me, Tom.""

I looked at her and said, ""You're right. I won't ever find someone like you again. And thank god for that.""

We ended up going to get drinks together that night as well as coffee together the next morning. I had a really great time, we got along really well and happened to have a lot in common (including that we both happened to be from the same country, just lived in different states).

We’ve still been occasionally messaging each other and in passing he has mentioned flying over to my home town. Is this a red flag? I’ve spent maybe a collective of 10 hours with this person. He said he has a few months booked off work to travel and has the first month planned, but after that nothing is set in stone. He’s mentioned that he’s never been to my state so thought it would be a nice chance to see it and me at the same time. I’m not opposed to him coming here, like I mentioned before I had a really great time and really enjoyed his company. He seems to be a very sweet guy and also super respectful. But I thought I’d get opinions from other people to see if this is a bad idea or if I should give it a shot and see what happens. I don’t think he has any plans on crashing at my place, probably stay at a hotel at first and see what happens. 

Also just to add to the general vibe of our meeting, there wasn’t much of a physical aspect to it. At the end of both hangouts he kissed my cheek but that’s the extent of it, but he spoke in a way that hinted more romantic than friendly intentions. ",1,1742648503.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

1jh7wgj,https://i.redd.it/k5wskf1fo8qe1.png,The Science of Gratitude: How a Simple Practice Builds Resilience and Reduces Stress,"**TL;DR:** Gratitude isn’t just a feel-good exercise—it’s a research-backed tool that enhances resilience, reduces stress, and even rewires the brain for more positive thinking. Studies show that gratitude improves mental health, strengthens leadership effectiveness, and fosters stronger relationships. This post explores the science behind gratitude, its impact on stress and resilience, and practical ways to incorporate it into daily life.  

---  

### **Gratitude Is More Than Just a Nice Idea—It’s a Science-Backed Tool for Resilience**  

When life and work get stressful, it’s easy to fixate on what’s going wrong or what’s next. But what if the key to handling stress more effectively wasn’t pushing harder, but *shifting perspective*?  

Research shows that practicing gratitude can significantly enhance resilience, lower stress levels, and even rewire the brain to be more adaptive and solution-focused. Leaders, professionals, and anyone navigating high-pressure environments can benefit from integrating gratitude into their daily routines—not as an empty platitude, but as a mental fitness strategy grounded in neuroscience.  

Let’s break down how gratitude impacts the brain, why it strengthens resilience, and how to build a sustainable gratitude practice.  

---  

### **The Neuroscience of Gratitude and Resilience**  

Gratitude isn’t just about feeling good in the moment—it has measurable effects on brain function and long-term mental well-being. Here’s what the science says:  

- 🧠 **Increased Dopamine and Serotonin Production:** Practicing gratitude triggers the release of dopamine and serotonin, the brain’s ""feel-good"" chemicals. This enhances mood and promotes long-term emotional resilience. [1]  
- 🏋️‍♂️ **Strengthened Prefrontal Cortex Activity:** Gratitude activates the prefrontal cortex, the part of the brain responsible for decision-making, emotional regulation, and future planning. This means that people who practice gratitude regularly tend to handle stress and setbacks more effectively. [2]  
- 🔄 **Neuroplasticity and Habit Formation:** Engaging in gratitude rewires neural pathways over time, making positive thinking more automatic. This can be especially helpful in breaking cycles of chronic stress and anxiety. [3]  

Beyond brain chemistry, gratitude has been linked to tangible benefits that directly impact resilience. A 2023 meta-analysis of 64 randomized clinical trials found that gratitude interventions led to:  

✅ Lower stress and anxiety levels  
✅ Improved sleep quality (which directly supports cognitive function)  
✅ Enhanced problem-solving and adaptability under pressure  
✅ Stronger social connections and support networks [4]  

These aren’t just *nice-to-have* benefits—they’re critical for anyone in leadership or high-pressure roles who needs to maintain clarity, focus, and emotional resilience.  

---  

### **How Gratitude Builds Resilience**  

Resilience is the ability to navigate stress, setbacks, and uncertainty without being overwhelmed. Gratitude plays a direct role in strengthening this ability by:  

- 🔹 **Reducing the impact of stress:** A gratitude practice helps reframe challenges, allowing people to focus on solutions rather than becoming stuck in negative thought loops. Research shows that gratitude reduces cortisol (the stress hormone) and lowers overall stress levels. [5]  
- 🔹 **Improving sleep quality:** Leaders and professionals often struggle with sleep due to stress, but gratitude has been shown to help. One study found that writing down things you’re grateful for before bed significantly improves sleep quality and duration. [6]  
- 🔹 **Enhancing social resilience:** Gratitude strengthens relationships, fostering a sense of connection and support. People who express gratitude regularly build stronger personal and professional networks, which serve as critical resources during difficult times. [7]  

These benefits aren’t just theoretical—countless professionals and executives who integrate gratitude into their leadership style report improved decision-making, stronger teams, and reduced burnout.  

---  

### **Practical Ways to Build a Gratitude Practice**  

If gratitude is so beneficial, why don’t more people practice it? Often, it’s because they assume it has to be a big, time-consuming effort. But the reality is, small, consistent actions can create lasting change.  

Here are five evidence-based ways to incorporate gratitude into your routine:  

📝 **1. The ""Three Good Things"" Exercise**  
Each evening, write down three things that went well that day and why they mattered. This simple practice has been shown to improve mood, increase optimism, and reduce symptoms of depression. [8]  

🚶 **2. Mindful Gratitude Walks**  
Instead of just walking from point A to B, take a few moments to notice and appreciate your surroundings—whether it’s fresh air, a favorite coffee shop, or a quiet moment alone. Engaging your senses in this way strengthens the neural pathways associated with gratitude.  

💬 **3. Expressing Gratitude to Others**  
Telling someone you appreciate them—whether it’s a colleague, friend, or mentor—has a dual benefit: it strengthens relationships and reinforces your own sense of gratitude. Studies show that expressing gratitude to others increases happiness levels for both the giver and the receiver. [9]  

🔄 **4. Gratitude Habit Stacking**  
Pair your gratitude practice with an existing habit. For example, take a moment to reflect on what you’re grateful for while brushing your teeth, drinking your morning coffee, or shutting down your laptop at the end of the day. This makes it easier to stay consistent.  

🌙 **5. Gratitude Body Scan Before Bed**  
Before falling asleep, mentally scan through your body and express gratitude for each part—your hands for the work they do, your legs for carrying you through the day, etc. This practice has been shown to promote relaxation and improve sleep quality.  

---  

### **Final Thoughts: Gratitude as a Leadership Strategy**  

For leaders, executives, and professionals, gratitude isn’t just a personal well-being tool—it’s a leadership strategy. Leaders who practice gratitude:  

✔ Foster stronger, more engaged teams  
✔ Make better, clearer decisions under pressure  
✔ Build resilience that prevents burnout  
✔ Strengthen relationships that support long-term success  

If you’ve ever felt like stress and negativity dominate your thinking, incorporating even a small gratitude practice can create meaningful shifts. And if you’re reading this on a weekend, take it as a reminder to log off, step back, and reflect on what’s going well.  

What’s something—big or small—that you’re grateful for today? Drop it in the comments!  

---  

**TL;DR:** Research shows that gratitude isn’t just about feeling good—it actively strengthens resilience by reducing stress, improving sleep, and rewiring the brain for more adaptive thinking. Leaders who cultivate gratitude make better decisions, foster stronger relationships, and prevent burnout. Simple practices like writing down three good things, taking gratitude walks, and expressing appreciation to others can make a significant impact. What’s something you’re grateful for today?

1jh7riw,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1jh7riw/blocking_a_two_year_situationship/,Blocking a two year situationship.,"I (22M) blocked a 32M (bisexual) I was emotionally stuck on for 2 years. It was a situationship that never really began, but consumed me completely. But I still feel bad for blocking him as I don't want him to think badly of me.

I met him on Bumble. He was handsome, confident, a bit older, and from a social circle that felt intimidating - fashion influencers, models, people who seemed “above” my world. From the very beginning, he said he was only into hookups, and yet our chats were warm, thoughtful, and even profound. He was in another city. We were connected for six months before meeting. But he would often reach out, constantly check up on me, ask about studies, university. Helped me a lot during my internship as well. 

Eventually, we met in person. Our first date felt like magic - coffee, good conversation, respectful gestures. He said this was the first time he had taken someone on a date and I looked even beautiful in person. I was flattered. But right after, he ghosted me. I broke that silence myself after some time. He said he was on vacation and was eagerly waiting to meet again. 

I visited his city several times after that for some work and would subtly post stories that I was around. He’d say we’d meet soon, ask if I had place for him to come over (I was at my uncle's so I didn't) and then… nothing. I was heartbroken the first time and went back. Still, he texted that he missed me and had flirty conversations or sexting here and there, but it was always on his terms.

Once, I visited specifically hoping to meet him again and I had place. He made loose plans and then backed out at the last minute, saying he had to take his mother home. I waited until 2:30 a.m. for him. The next day, he said he regretted not coming but never followed up. He said we will meet over coffee. I waited the next two days there but there were no signs of him. That visit ended with me crying, physically unwell, and eventually on anxiety medication after a psychiatric consultation.

I blocked him from everywhere - but I forgot to delete my WhatsApp number from our Insta concert. A month later, he messaged me there. I panicked and blocked him again. Seven months passed, and on Eid, I got a generic message. I stupidly replied. He said he was glad to finally hear from me and that he will visit my city. He didn’t.

Fast forward to this year. He finally came to my city for his work. Contacted me on the way that he will reach in two hours. I went to his hotel. We talked a bit, made out, and I rested my head on his chest - something I had dreamed about for two years. He didn’t bring up the past. I texted him a polite thank - you after I left, and he said he wished I’d stayed longer. I said I didn't want to overstay. Then… nothing. I thought it'd be different but now a month has passed, he didn't contact again. I waited, just like I always had.

So I finally blocked him again. For real this time.

I feel like I’ve been emotionally chained to a fantasy. I thought we had a connection. I thought the deep chats meant something. I thought if I improved myself - hit the gym, worked harder, looked better - he’d finally see me. But he never did.

I still miss the idea of him. I still imagine sleeping on his chest sometimes. Since the last two days after blocking, I have been regretting it that maybe I should have just accepted the reality but everytime there is some hint of him around me, I loose focus and go back to the same downward spiral. Therefore, I block him to have peace. Still, I don't know why but I don't want him to think badly or me or hate me.

TL;DR: I (22M) was stuck in a 2-year on-and-off situationship with a 32M who ghosted me repeatedly. Despite my efforts and emotional investment, he stayed inconsistent. We met again recently, but nothing changed. I’ve finally blocked him to protect my peace but I feel bad now. ",1,1742647958.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

I don’t know if the two are related and I’ve reached out to the Dr who prescribed but just looking for peer support/advice in addition to clinical. 
I’ve been diagnosed with generalized anxiety and previously panic disorder which I no longer meet the criteria for (yay) but that’s causing me to worry - maybe prematurely. 
I hadn’t had a panic attack in tbh I’m not sure how long anymore that I couldn’t pin down the exact reason for (way too little sleep was a common cause for me) but this week I’ve had two that I can only describe as constant violent waves of anxiety and panic for an hour straight each. 

Has anyone experienced this with Ritalin and a history of anxiety? What did you do?

Just for context it’s been a few weeks of meds, steady increase, I’ve been sleeping better than I have in my entire life, really watching caffeine intake drinking mostly decaf because I simply love coffee rather than caffeine and just doing my best to be mindful of my mental state and taking extra care etc.

DO NOT HIRE Lauren Bri Photo + Film – Unprofessional, Dishonest, and Unreliable

I’m devastated to be writing this, but I feel a responsibility to warn other couples before they make the same mistake I did. My experience with Lauren Thompson/Lauren Etheridge of Lauren Bri Photo+Film out of South Carolina was a complete nightmare, and months later, I still have zero fully edited wedding photos or a proper video—despite paying her in full and waiting well beyond the contracted deadline. I paid almost $4000 to her and still don’t have what I paid for.

Completely Unprofessional Behavior on My Wedding Day
 • She brought her 3-year-old son to my wedding without informing me. He was there from 1:00 PM until after my ceremony (around 4:20 PM). She never asked for my approval, never apologized, and never even acknowledged it.
 • My wedding coordinator was forced to watch her child because he was running around and dancing in the getting-ready space without a parent in sight. I didn’t even know whose child he was until after the wedding.
 • She later admitted that her babysitter canceled last minute and that she almost didn’t show up at all, leaving me without a photographer on my wedding day.

Rude and Disrespectful to Staff

While she was polite to my face, multiple vendors reported that she was rude and unprofessional to them. This is completely unacceptable for someone working in the wedding industry, where professionalism and kindness should be a given.

Did Not Deliver Photos & Videos on Time (Or At All)
 • Her contract stated that I would receive my full wedding gallery and videos within 6-10 weeks. I received nothing within that timeframe.
 • At the 10-week mark (February 1st), I reached out, and she immediately started making excuses:
 • First, she said she doesn’t upload photos on Saturdays, so I gave her until Monday.
 • On Monday, she told me she had the flu and wouldn’t be able to send them.
 • A week later, she said her computer overheated while trying to upload them.
 • After pressing her, I discovered that she had barely edited any photos at all, despite telling me multiple times that the gallery was “done.”
 • At 11 weeks post-wedding, I demanded a sneak peek gallery by the end of the day—and she agreed. But again, nothing was delivered.

The Photos I Did Receive Were NOT What She Advertised
 • The few photos she actually did edit (maybe 75 out of 2,000 total) were not even close to the quality of work she displays on her website and Instagram. They are okay, but not what she advertised. Even the ones I’ve put on my Facebook have been edited myself on my phone. The cross in my photos is crooked in almost every single one. There were photos from the reception that no flash was used so they’re completely unusable. BUT don’t worry, she took quite a few pics of her husband taking our wedding video, so at least she got that. 

**this really is the least of my worries, as I know I can get them re-edited elsewhere, but just another thing that happened. I’ll put a comparison of her Instagram versus what I received. Again, it’s not horrible, but another thing that added to the frustration. 

 • Her online portfolio is clearly misleading, and after speaking with two other brides, I found that they had almost the exact same experience. She is scamming couples by advertising one level of work and delivering subpar, rushed, and incomplete edits or even none at all. One bride I spoke with has nothing and her wedding was in SEPTEMBER. And the other had to threaten with a lawyer to receive hers.

Failed to Deliver the Wedding Video as Requested
 • I specifically requested one uncut, full-length ceremony video so we could rewatch our vows.
 • Instead, she delivered 30 separate one-minute clips and did not even attempt to put them together.
 • This is a massive failure to deliver what was agreed upon, and at this point, I have no usable wedding video.

Refuses to Refund or Release the Raw Files
 • After discovering that she had barely edited my photos at all, I requested a refund—which she refused.
 • I then asked her to simply send me the unedited files and sign a release so I could have another photographer edit them. That was 5 weeks ago, and she still has not signed the release.
 • It has now been 17 weeks since my wedding, and I still have no professional photos or video.

Hiding Negative Reviews
 • She has disabled Facebook reviews, which is a huge red flag and likely an attempt to hide negative feedback.
 • The fact that I have personally connected with two other brides with nearly identical experiences proves this isn’t a one-time mistake—it’s a pattern of dishonesty, missed deadlines, and unprofessionalism.

Taking Legal Action

As of now, I still do not have a fully edited gallery. Only a gallery of unedited photos and she won’t sign a release to let me get them edited elsewhere, even after giving her 5 weeks to sign it and 17 total weeks of time post wedding to complete my gallery or process a refund. I have given her more than enough time to make this right, and she has refused. I will be pursuing legal action against her within the next week. 

If you are considering hiring her, please reconsider. I would never want another couple to go through this stress and heartbreak. If you’ve already hired her, I would recommend looking for someone else. Wedding photography is one of the most important investments you’ll make, and hiring the wrong person can leave you with nothing to remember your day by. 

Thank you for reading this far.

1jh7pz2,https://www.reddit.com/r/starwarsbooks/comments/1jh7pz2/star_wars_library_organization/,Star Wars Library Organization,"How does everyone organize their Star Wars library? I have many bookshelves and my organization is not really in any particularly standardized order.  I have everything from children's books to hardcover novels to paperback novels to art books to oversized coffee table books to magazines. 

Some ways I organize my library is by media format. So for example I have all my magazines together and all my audiobooks together. In some cases I put all my Clone Wars stuff mostly in one place. All of my art of books that Disney's put out look good all together so I do that. Most of my junior novels are all in one place. 

I thought about organizing it by era and subject. For example, putting all of my Return of the Jedi era stuff in one place. Maybe doing the entirelibrary chronologically by this method. 

I have a section with just Timothy Zahn hardcover novels but no other sections are by author so I feel like I should maybe break that up and put it in some other order. 

Some books crossover between everything like Star Wars Year by Year and I wouldn't even know where to put that except maybe having a section for general Star Wars books. 

Maybe there is no good way of doing it and it's whatever kind of works at the time, but I'm curious what everybody else does.

1jh7pxe,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantBreakUps/comments/1jh7pxe/so_hurt_by_ghosting/,So hurt by ghosting,"My avoidant ex broke up with me 3 months ago, blindsided me, reasoning back then was that he felt anxious, overwhelmed and guilty in the relationship, that he thought he’s incapable of love, he’s broken.

 So we kept talking for the next 3 months, short distant conversation. We had coffee 6 weeks in and after that he started answering faster and more. I asked him to go out and he said maybe because he had a trip the next week (it was casual, not a date) and might have no time. Suddenly, when I rechecked on that invite he ghosted me. 

 He’s now been ghosting me for 3 weeks, I sent him a message yesterday on instagram telling him it made me feel small and confused and I want to talk, he didn’t even open it, and has been just avoiding logging on instagram at all. I asked him if he was going to throw out the crochet things I made him, no answer (I’d want them back if so)

 He won’t block me or unfollow me anywhere. I just don’t understand what’s going on. I feel so hurt and confused about why he suddenly decided to do this. Can someone relate with this? How do you cope with being ghosted like this? I feel like I’m being erased, like he wants to forget I ever existed and it hurts so much. It’s even more painful than the break up.

## Types of Leather for Storage Ottomans: A⁤ material Deep‌ Dive

When shopping for a leather storage ottoman, understanding the different types of⁤ leather is‍ crucial. The type of leather substantially affects the ottoman's price, appearance, durability, and maintenance requirements. Here's a breakdown of ⁢the most common types:

*   **Genuine Leather:** ‍This is a broad term⁢ that can encompass various grades of‌ leather. technically, anything called‍ ""genuine leather"" is made of real leather, but the quality can vary widely. It's typically more durable and looks‍ better than faux or bonded leather. However, the term ""genuine leather storage ottoman"" doesn't guarantee top-grain or full-grain leather.
*   **Full-Grain Leather:**​ Considered the highest quality leather,‌ full-grain leather retains the natural markings and imperfections of the hide.‍ It's incredibly durable and develops ‌a gorgeous patina over time. A full-grain leather storage ottoman ⁢is a premium investment that will ‌last for generations.
* ‍  **Top-Grain Leather:** This is the ⁤second-highest quality ⁣leather.The top layer of the hide is sanded and finished‍ to remove imperfections. Top-grain leather is more uniform in ‍appearance ⁢than full-grain leather but still offers excellent durability.
*   **Bonded Leather:** Bonded leather is made from scraps of leather that are shredded, mixed with adhesives, and then bonded together. It's the least‌ expensive type ‍of real leather and ⁤is less durable than full-grain or ​top-grain leather. A bonded leather storage ottoman might be an ⁤option for budget-conscious buyers,but it won't last as long.
*   **Faux Leather (Vegan leather):** Faux leather, also known as vegan ⁣leather or PU ‍leather, is a synthetic material made to resemble real leather. It's typically more affordable than genuine leather and is a good option for those who are ethically opposed to using‌ animal products. ⁤A faux leather storage ottoman can ⁣be a stylish‌ and budget-pleasant choice, but it's⁢ not as durable as real leather.
*   **Leather Match:** ""Leather match"" typically means that the parts of the ottoman you touch (the seating surface, armrests, etc.) are made⁤ of genuine leather, while the sides and back are made of a matching vinyl or faux leather. Leather match⁣ helps to⁤ save money while still providing the leather‍ surface for the​ user.

I am an English teacher here in Frisco ISD with 23 years of experience. This summer, I am considering starting small literature circles based on age for students to read and discuss books from an AP list. Along with discussion questions students would engage in, they would be given short answer response questions which would be evaluated each evening and provided with my personal feedback via a Google doc. 

I envision groups meeting everyday for a week to two weeks depending on the novel. (This is flexible as I know students are busy.) This could be virtually or in person at a local coffee shop so students can experience the adult version of discussing literature ☕️. 

The price I am considering is $200 a week, per person, with groups being no larger than 5, in order that each voice can be heard. 

I’m putting this out here to see if parents would be interested so I can plan logistics.

In the ever-evolving world of Bitcoin and blockchain, the smartest moves aren’t just about HODLing or perfectly timing the market (spoiler: you probably won’t). No, the real genius lies in **automation and efficiency**. And if you’re running a business, a crypto service, or any kind of Bitcoin-related platform, integrating our **Bitcoin QR code generator API** is one of the highest IQ moves you can make. 💡🚀

Let’s dive into why using our [Bitcoin QR Code Maker API](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com/bitcoin-qr-code-maker-api-and-widgets/) is the smartest thing you’ll do all year!

# The Problem: Manual Bitcoin Transactions are a Hassle

Let’s be real—manually copying and pasting Bitcoin wallet addresses is like trying to defuse a bomb with your eyes closed. One wrong character, and boom! Your BTC is floating somewhere in the blockchain void, never to be seen again.

Now imagine this happening on a larger scale:

* **An e-commerce store** manually sends BTC payment addresses to customers 🤯
* **A freelancer** struggles to collect payments from international clients 😵‍💫
* **A crypto donation site** loses potential contributions because the process isn’t smooth 💸

If your business depends on Bitcoin payments, efficiency matters. That’s where a **Bitcoin QR code generator API** comes in to save the day.

# What’s a Bitcoin QR Code Generator API? 🤖

Nobody likes waiting. If your customers have to manually enter payment details, they’re more likely to abandon the transaction. A simple **scan-to-pay QR code** means they can complete their purchase in seconds, increasing your conversion rate.

Mainly how as you get older you can injure yourself, seemingly by just existing, out of nowhere, without even doing anything to warrant said injury.

Perfect example..

I just went to the kitchen to fill up my coffee cup, and there was only a little bit left so I took it in the living room to top off my uncle's cup for him as well.

Well, as I just so ever slightly bent over to pour the coffee, I had a sharp stabbing pain accompanied by a few hard jerks in my back muscle right below my left shoulder blade.

Then when I go to straighten up it feels like that muscle is just being twisted or pinched or something.

I guess it's not as bad as the ""I woke up like this"" back injuries that happen while we're sleeping, that I'm sure we all have from time to time.

Anyway, that's about it. Getting older sucks.

Jordan Peterson sits in a leather chair, notebook in hand, while Rust Cohle slouches on a couch, staring at the ceiling fan as it rotates with a low hum. The air smells of old paper and coffee.**

**Jordan Peterson (leaning forward, hands clasped):** Let’s start with why you’re here, Rust. You strike me as a man who’s spent a lot of time thinking—maybe too much. What’s weighing on you?

**Rust Cohle (flat, eyes still on the fan):** Weighing? That implies a scale. You think there’s a balance to any of this? We’re just… organisms on a rock. Mistakes of evolution pretending our scream into the void means something.

**Peterson (nodding):** So you see existence as inherently meaningless. Yet here you are, in a room with a therapist. Why engage in the pretense?

**Rust (snorts, finally meeting Peterson’s gaze):** Habit. Or maybe curiosity. Heard you’re big on telling people to clean their rooms, play hero in their own story. Figured I’d see how you’d spin this carnival of pain we’re stuck in.

**Peterson (scribbling a note):** You reduce life to a “carnival of pain,” yet pain implies a *value judgment*. If nothing matters, why label it as pain? Why not indifference?

**Rust (leans forward, voice low):** Because indifference takes effort. Pain’s the default. You open your eyes, see the world for what it is—a meat grinder. We’re all just… waiting our turn.

**Peterson (raising an eyebrow):** You’re describing a hell of your own making. You think your nihilism shields you from suffering, but it’s a surrender. Worse—a *lie*. You don’t act like nothing matters. You hunted killers for years. Why bother, if it’s all a void?

**Rust (pauses, jaw tight):** Maybe I’m just bad at quitting. Or maybe I wanted to tilt at windmills—give the abyss a middle finger on the way down.

**Peterson (leaning in):** There it is. You *care*, Rust. You cling to purpose, even if it’s dressed as futility. What if that impulse—to fight, to *mean* something—is more real than the stories you tell yourself?

**Rust (voice sharpening):** Stories? You’re the damn bard of bedtime tales. “Archetypes, responsibility, dragons.” You ever wonder if your myths are just… scaffolding over a pit?*

**Peterson (calmly):** Myths are how we navigate the pit. You stare into it and call it truth. I build bridges across it. But both of us are acknowledging the pit. The difference is, I choose to act *as if* existence demands something of me. What’s your daughter’s death demanding of you?

**Rust (stiffens, looks away):** …That’s a low swing, Doc.

**Peterson (softer):** It’s the heart of it, isn’t it? You lost her, and the world became a tomb. But grief isn’t a philosophy—it’s a call to arms. You either let it consume you or rise, spitefully, to make the suffering *mean* something.

**Rust (quiet, distant):** She was… light. And the world’s better at snuffing that out than making it. What’s the point of rising if it all just repeats?

**Peterson:** Because repetition is the game. You keep pushing the boulder, not because you’ll win, but because the act itself defies the chaos. Your daughter’s light—why not honor it by kindling another? Even a flicker undermines the dark.

**Rust (long silence, then a wry smirk):** You’re a stubborn bastard, you know that?

**Peterson (smiling faintly):** Likewise. So—next session, we work on that flicker. Start small. Ever keep a journal?

**Rust (standing, grabbing his coat):** Let’s not get ahead of ourselves. I’ll think about not cancelling. No promises.

**Peterson (nodding):** Fair enough. But Rust— (Rust pauses at the door)—the stories we tell? They’re choices. Yours doesn’t have to end in the pit.

**Rust (without turning):** We’ll see, Doc. We’ll see.

*The door clicks shut. Peterson leans back, staring at his notes. Outside, rain begins to patter against the window.*

Me - Hey Charles, I didn’t appreciate how you tried boxing me in yesterday when you said you believe the reason I’m liberal is solely due to my father after I told you I didn’t want to go into politics. An apology will suffice

Charles - if youre serious we'll address this in person. these things can wait until face to face interaction because im not sure what the tone is. I'm not a fan of texting to begin with. but I meant no harm in what I said and I'll be glad to clarify in person

Me- Put your ego to the side and acknowledge what you said was arrogant

Charles - im not addressing this here. we'll talk in person.

Me- Either call me or say sorry via text and we can move forward

Charles - no. call me if you want.

me- What’s the big deal, are you in a meeting and can’t talk ?

Charles - I told u I don't like texting. either you call me or I see u in person. make the decision .

me - I have a better suggestion, if I decide to meet you in person will you promise to apologize ?. In addition, I’d like for you to explain why you think I’m not capable of formulating my own opinions and thoughts. Two things for you to reflect on. If you promise to apologize in person, I’ll come. Let me know. No insults, no threats will be exchanged.

Charles - I'm not promising anything. we'll talk like reasonable men.

me - What does that mean bro, it’s a simple question . Anyways, I can tell you are offended by the way you hung up on me. You changed from ""either call me or talk to me in person"" to ""talk to me in person"". Not so reasonable in my books I’ll be on campus after I finish my laundry and the clothes dry. Offended because I said ""ego guy"".

Charles : I’ll see u then

me - Saying sorry doesn’t make you less of a man, just want to put that out there. I’m letting you know now, if you don’t apologize within 2 minutes of meeting I’m walking away.

Charles - so don't come. I told u I don't respond well to threats. stop texting me I told you to meet there. we're reasonable men, im not worried about face to face interaction

me - That’s the issue, this isn’t a threat Charles it’s an expectation. Learn the difference

Charles - ok see u there.

me - Can I answer this truthfully? I don’t think you’ve been reasonable since I’ve addressed this head on. But, if you feel you have, please enlighten me . just out of curiosity, what does face to face change for you.

Charles - I told you stop texting me. I don't want to text.

me - Lastly, when you apologize within two minutes of meeting, you’re going to equally say sorry for claiming I was bullying you For someone who I’ve told my entire life to (especially in fine detail of how I was bullied) I’d assume you wouldn’t jump to that conclusion

Charles - see u there.

me - im not coming

Charles - I respect that im ready to meet when u are but I will have no one dictate what im going to say, how, and when, I have no problem apologizing but after discussing things in person. no weapons formed against me, including threats, shall prosper. see u soon.

me - I hear u and I respect your stance as well. I agree that it's important to have a real conversation in person. let's meet and talk things through. I just want to make sure we both have a constructive and respectful convo when the time comes. Just to clarify, I wasn't threatening nobody.

Charles - excellent, I admire this. let me know when.

me - to be frank, but you are being very unreasonable when someone addresses your arrogant comments.

Charles - there you go again, ill see u soon.

me - I don't appreciate this man, especially from you who is, more often than not, very understanding. this 180 flip doesn't make sense to me. at least tell me the time and place rather than repeatedly saying see u soon.

Charles - today anytime past 4.

me - cool.

\-as we're approaching 4.

Charles - lets make it after 5.

me - why what happened

Charles - ill be late if u come around that time.

me - why? dude, what changed. when we chat today, im not looking for arguments Charles. I hope ive made that clear im also not looking for passive aggressive behaviour like u did on the phone. if we even are going to chat today, I don't even know if youre going to show up.

Charles - ill see u after 5

me - not if you plan on arguing. I need a clear answer. Last time, u got extremely emotional during our convo and I don't want that to happen again.

(I call him and he doesn't pick up)

Charles - can I call u later ?

me - up to you. what time. be precise. Forget it, this is too much hassle for you to see how arrogant your comment was and it’s not guaranteed that you won’t be combattive. see u another day.

Charles - Ok. See you next time. Consider this friendship over. But I’m looking forward to taking about what you didn’t like about what I said and, if warranted, an apology will be made. Things will be cordial and amicable moving forward, but this friendship is over my dear bro. You are my brother in Christ, but a friendship is out of the question. I’ll hit u up for next time. I’m looking forward to it.

me - im coming. let me get dressed and ready my clothes is still drying

Charles - ok

me - would u like to have a meal together brother ?

Charles - thank you but im afraid I just ate. im down for coffee or tea while u eat.

me - if its gonna be our last time, lets eat don't be like that

Charles - im actually full no joke.

me - even some fries ? or an appetizer

Charles - a drink is the most I can. imagine was expecting to be at the library so I ate beforehand.

\-(we met in person and I already told u how the interaction went above, then I sent him this shortly after)

me - I don’t feel bad about myself Charles nor do I have low self esteem. I'm ok the way I am, Charles even much better than others This apology thing bothered you that much, to the point where you began insulting me and throwing all kinds of bad words in my direction. People do things in their life, sometimes bad sometimes good, even you joke about it when it happens. But you took it seriously today (even the texting) and threw unnecessary bad words against my character. Non stop. I’m not interested in ever being friends after this.

I've been sitting here wanting to post (though not sure why), having issues with a title of all things, and what it would contain within.

As I sip my coffee, I am reflecting on conversations I have had with people in the past year, and how they all just seem to be surface level, and never getting deep enough to really know someone.

Being that this is online, I somewhat expect that, but I remember a time, just a couple years ago, where online interactions were deep, meaningful, and a hell of a lot more fun.

But my issue is not just online, also in person.  I feel like that human element is missing in my life, and I wonder if it's something that is just gone forever.

As they say, it's really not that deep, or serious...I am just a middle aged guy who has been alone for awhile now, and looking for someone to spend time communicating with.  I can't be the only one.

I am fun, light hearted, funny, and also do enjoy the deeper topics.  Life is hard, and doing it alone is difficult in various ways depending on the time of day.

None of this really makes sense, and I am just rambling into the void...but maybe it resonates with someone...if it does, let's share some banter. The weekend has just begun, and I have nothing planned. ",1,1742646423.0,R4R30Plus,1,1.0,False

Premier security line looked so much shorter than TSA so we originally tried it but was not moving. TSA precheck line stretched back to premier bag check but it was moving quickly. At least six agents working. The only slow line was the one GS was feeding into. For those folks and for GS.

I hope this proves as useful to some as it was to me :)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Published in 1973, Nisargadatta Maharaj’s book *I am That* became an instant modern spiritual classic. While there are a myriad of insights in this text, one of the most potent passages is when he explains to the aspirant,

“*I find that somehow, by shifting the focus of attention, I become the very thing I look at, and experience the kind of consciousness it has; I become the inner witness of the thing. I call this capacity of entering other focal points of consciousness, love; you may give it any name you like. Love says ""I am everything"". Wisdom says ""I am nothing"". Between the two, my life flows. Since at any point of time and space I can be both the subject and the object of experience, I express it by saying that I am both, and neither, and beyond both*.”

While “Love says ‘I am everything.’ Wisdom says ‘I am nothing’. Between the two, my life flows” might make for a great spiritual bumper sticker, what is Maharaj trying to convey in this passage? In his typically uncompromising and pithy style, Nisargadatta has simultaneously lovingly railed home a powerful pointer and also attempted to articulate his experience of Self-Realization. So let’s begin to unpack that phrase.

From the perspective of the mind, there are three stages of spiritual development. In the final analysis, there are no phases or stages of spiritual development, however for pedagogical purposes it is helpful to make a compassionate concession to the mind to illustrate the struggles and insights in order to guide the aspirant toward deeper understandings of the substance of experience.

1. Shifting from “I-the body/mind to ‘the witness’

Our culture socializes us to believe that “I” am an individual person (subject) with a body and a mind; I stand separately and objectively a part from a universe filled with things (objects). Therefore, the popular understanding is duality (I am a subject; objects other than me exist). In order to disrupt the subject/object binary, it is important to draw the attention to the mind (thoughts), sensations (bodily), and perceptions (vision, tasting, touching, smelling, and hearing). Like a forensic scientist, carefully and thoroughly analyze the way in which the mind and sensations appear ***to you.*** Notice how you have never missed a thought nor have you every missed a sensation. You have been present and aware for every thought and every sensation. In other words, ***how can the body/mind be the subject*** **if they are appearing as the objects of experience?**

Something is aware of the body/mind and world. This something is what we refer to as “I” or “I am” (use whatever resonates with you). What are the characteristics of this something? If this something had any characteristics it would be immediately perceivable by the mind, therefore it would be known or experienced. Anything conceivable or perceivable would be an appearance and could not be the subject; what we are trying to describe is the *experiencer.* While we cannot describe this “something” as anything in particular, we can say with the utmost certainty, is this “something” is aware and present. ***So, what “I am” is no-thing***, but I am undeniably present and aware. Taking this stand is taking the stand of “the witness”.

When the realization of “the witness” sinks in, it is our experiential understanding and *feels like* we are a dimensionless camera witnessing a high-resolution movie or video game, wherein the character we assumed ourselves to be is now an appearing in “the screen”. This picture illustrates this point \[[link\]](https://imgur.com/a/1SMlpLZ).

As “the witness” of experience, it becomes clear and obvious that “something” is present and aware of all experience and stand a apart from whatever happens. This is a helpful first step in the spiritual search **but it is dualistic**. Taking the stand as “the witness” is a milestone in the spiritual search (so to speak) because while it is a more accurate description of the substance of experience there is still a subject standing apart from “other things” (a world).

\*\*\*An aside\*\*\* The internet has brought us remarkably wise sages with only a few pushes of the button. However, the internet has also brought a proliferation of well-intentioned teachers with an underdeveloped nondual understanding. Some well-intentioned teachers seem to be communicating that taking the stand as “the witness” is all that needs to be done and this is false. More on this later.

Since “the witness” and “the world” is still duality, we must begin to explore much more deeply the subject of experience. What is this “I”? What is this “I am”? “Who am I?” “Am I aware?” use whatever phrase or question most closely resonates with you. Most people have their attention pointed outwards. Asking this question immediately draws the attention *inwards*. By *inwards* I don’t mean toward the body, *inwards* means toward the source of thought. This is the practice Ramana Maharshi, Atmananda Krishna Menon, and Nisargadatta Maharaj and others refer to as Self-inquiry. In the current nondual circles this term has been appropriated and misinterpreted. A more precise term could be Self-Abidance. What I mean by Self-Abidance is when the attention is pulled inwards, thoughts lose their fascinating quality, slow down, and begin to “dissolve” or “sink” back into the source. It takes a little bit of trial and error to notice this, but as you recognize the sinking and dissolving, “relax” or “fall into” the sensation. This is what Jaluadduin Rumi meant when he urged aspirants to “flow down, and down, and down, into every widening rings of Being”. As thoughts have less “inertia” to rise, the mind rests in its source.

When the mind rests in its source, there is Self-abidance. Rupert Spira uses the metaphor of the dirty sock to describe the importance of Self-abidance. While reading blogs or podcasts may scrape away the chunks of dirt on the socks we wore when we were gardening in the backyard, simply running the socks through the wash machine are not enough. We need to soak the socks in warm water to dislodge the deeply embedded gunk. Not to go overboard on the metaphor, but Self-abidance works similarly because the amnesia of forgetting your true nature is so profound, it is important to devote as much energy as possible to sit and re-familiarize yourself with the Self.

When the mind rests in its source, carefully notice that the “I”, that is present and aware, does not seem to be constricted by space or time, nor does it seem to be limited or owned by anyone. Put differently, this “I” is omnipresent (eternally present), omniscient (eternally knowing), and omnipotent (unaffected by experience). Naturally, the most rational question that arises is:

**But how can “I” be aware of that “I”? What is aware of that “I”?**

Something is present and aware of that “I”. If something is present and aware of that which is omnipresent, omniscient, and omnipresent, that must also be omnipresent, omniscient, and omnipotent. Therefore, that which is ***aware*** *and* ***present KNOWS ITSELF*** to be **aware** and **present.** **Awareness knows itself.** Awareness knows itself by simply Being itself. By Being itself Awareness knows itself. When Awareness knowingly knows itself this can be called an “awakening”.

\*\*\*As an aside\*\*\* In many nondual circles, the term “enlightenment” is tossed around. It may be beneficial to avoid the entertaining the term because there are at least three or four layers of assumptions embedded within how the term is usually conveyed. It is at best disingenuous or at worst, flat out false, to pedal the term “enlightenment” given the assumptions and associations to potential aspirants. Using the term awakening is a much more precise description.

While the awakening may trigger a release of energy and sensations of euphoria and lightness, “these too shall pass”. This is a popular “Red Herring” in the spiritual search. While this milestone may, on the face of it, seem like “the final understanding” there is still quite a bit of work left to do. Always remember the ultimate litmus test that Atmananda Krishna Menon put forth, ***“Self-Realization occurs when thoughts, feelings, and perceptions no longer take you away.”*** Put differently, if there is even the slightest bit of resistance to any thoughts, feelings, and perceptions (EVER, even 99% of the time), then there is more investigating to be done.

After the recognition of Awareness knowingly knowing itself, where do we turn?

2. Recognizing “The Field of Experience”

In the previous phase, it became our experiential understanding that thoughts and sensations were objects to the subject of experience. However, for the purposes of this phase it might be helpful to quickly revisit some of the assumptions that are further embedded within how we are experiencing the inside/outside me/world dynamics.

Let us conduct a quick experiment. Let any thought or series of thoughts appear. Take a deep look at that thought and notice that is appearing “within you”. By this, I do not mean within a head, but simply listen closely to the sounds of these thoughts. Then subtly shift your attention to a prominent sound (the sound of traffic, for example). Relax your attention to the sound, as if you if it were white noise while performing chores around the house. Do not put much emphasis on the distinct patterns of the sound. Simply notice how that sound is also appearing “within you”. From there, switch your attention back and forth between the thought(s) and the sound of traffic. When you shifted your attention between your thoughts and the sounds did you cross a border? Where was the distinct boundary between “I am hearing a thought” and “I am hearing traffic”? Where is the border between “the inside world” of my head and the “outside world”?

Now direct your attention to the tingling sensation in your feet. Again, relax your attention and notice where this sensation is appearing? Does the tingling of the feet sensation appear “in the world” or “within me”? Go back and forth between these thoughts, sensations, and perceptions until it is absolutely clear and you *feel* that there are no borders between them.

Notice that whatever thought, sensation, or perception is appearing within the same field of Awareness. Whatever you are aware of, appears within that field. So let us direct our attention to the nature of this field. When we say “the nature of” something, we mean what is this field “made of” or what is the **substance** or “the stuff?” of that something. As we look more closely at the field we see that the field does not seem to have any edges to it. While everything (every single thought, feeling, and sensation) seems to appear within this field, since we cannot find a border there can be no other fields. Moreover, as we look more closely at the substance of the field, not only do we not find any boundaries in the field, but we do not seem to find any boundaries between the field and the objects we are experiencing. For example, when we listen to “the sound of traffic” (as one example) we might ask the question, “How far away is the sound of traffic?” If we drop the label, “the sound of traffic” and look directly at the dance of the sound, we cannot seem to find a particular location where the sound is registering. If we are open and honest, the most precise answer we can give is “Here”. In fact any sound is registering right here. Then it dawns on you that any perception: viewing the moon, the taste of ice cream, the feeling of the couch, the smell of coffee, and the roar of traffic is all happening “Here”. Even calling it 0 centimeters away isn’t quite accurate. The experience of Life becomes much warmer and intimate.

When this realization sinks in, we conceive ourselves to be oceanic, a vast limitless space of experience.

At this milestone, our experiential understanding is: what “I Am” is That *to which* everything appears and *in which* everything appears. This is an important step in the journey and a critical precursor for the next phase, but we **are still in dualism.** As long as we truly believe there are objects (things that have their own independent existence), there will be resistance and thus psychological suffering.

3. Moving from “The Field of Experience” to “I am Everything”

The most fundamental and guiding questions of this phase are: a) Do objects exist a part from perception? b) What is the substance or “the stuff” perceptions (vision, hearing, smelling, tasting, touching) are made of?

To understand the nature of experience it is imperative to answer these questions. Once again, we turn again to our direct experience; we turn to thoughts, sensations, and perceptions to see if we can better understand what they are made of. For example, take the previous example of the “sound of traffic”. If we drop the label, “the sound of traffic”, and we relax the focus of attention, we can see clearly that there is raw data appearing in the field of awareness happening “here”. An undulation of the field of awareness vibrating to the Self, and this vibration of energy is known through the activity of hearing. We conclude, “the activity of hearing is happening”. However, we must take an even closer look at the activity of hearing. Drop the label “the activity of hearing” and relax the attention again. Look very closely look a forensic scientist AND with childlike innocence, what is the hearing made of? Dwell on the question: Can we separate the “knowing of” from the perception of hearing? When we carefully look at the activity of hearing (or any of the other senses) it “made of” our own Self (i.e. Knowing or Awareness). Repeat this process for each of the senses, if need be. You may consider trying vision last because it is the most difficult.

It dawns on us that no matter what we are experiencing, whether it be a sunset or a symphony, the laughter of a child or the crying of a stranger, is the knowing of the perception and knowing is another name of the Self – what I am. At this juncture, we begin to understand what Krishna said in 6:30 of the Bhagavad Gita: “For one who sees Me everywhere and sees everything in Me, I am never lost, nor is he ever lost to Me.” This comment bares a close resemblance to what Rupert Spira says, “\[the Self\] sees its own face. It sees itself in all things and all things in itself’. From this perspective, all things are appearing in the Self and are “made of” the Self.

Now our perspective is what “I am” is That *to which* everything appears, *in which* appears, and *made of*everything that appears. However, **this is still duality.** While this is nearly as accurate as words can describe Self-realization, there are still several layers of unchallenged assumptions that need to be worked through.

With this understanding and these descriptions, we are legitimizing the reality of objects and not standing firmly as Awareness (or the Self) as our starting point. “All things within myself” is giving objects far too much credit. As the wise have pointed out time and time again, the primacy of the Self is vital for Self-Realization. So if we stand firm as the Self, and the Self is only and ever our starting point, and look even more closely at our experience, our nondual understanding begins to “falls into place” because the Self is THAT which is taking the shape of all apparent objects. Thinking, sensing, and perceiving is ‘made of” the Self. The Self is simply taking the shape of thoughts, sensations and perceptions, just like water takes the shape of snow, dew, and fog but never becoming anything other than water. And when we say, “The Self knows itSelf”, that means that the Self can only and ever come in contact with itSelf. Knowing knows itself isn’t quite right, so we can just say Knowing is all there is or as the Sufis (and other mystics) have said for centuries, God is all there is. When the Self knowingly knows that the Self is all there is, we call this Self-Realization.

**Reconnecting this Understanding to Nisargadatta**

For quick reference, here is the quote again,

“*I find that somehow, by shifting the focus of attention, I become the very thing I look at, and experience the kind of consciousness it has; I become the inner witness of the thing. I call this capacity of entering other focal points of consciousness, love; you may give it any name you like. Love says ""I am everything"". Wisdom says ""I am nothing"". Between the two, my life flows. Since at any point of time and space I can be both the subject and the object of experience, I express it by saying that I am both, and neither, and beyond both”*

When he says he can shift his focus of attention he is not referring to a mystical trick reserved for only sages. For example, imagine you are watching a movie at the theater. You can put your attention squarely on the protagonist of the movie and then shift your attention to the screen in which the protagonist is appearing on. This is the same kind of shift he is referring to in his quotation.

In other words, it is possible to shift the attention to the experiential understanding of the witness; as such we become the detached observer, which is what Nisargadatta means when he says, “I am nothing”. Nothing in this case means anything perceivable or conceivable (but obviously present and aware). However, it is also possible to shift the attention to the experiential understanding that “I am everything” which is synonymous with pure equanimity, completely and fully embracing your own Self, which we can call Love. But as he points out in the last sentence describing either one of those aspects as definite explanations on the nature of reality isn’t quite accurate. We cannot accurately describe “the final analysis” because language collapses. Saying that “Knowing Is” or “the Self is” is quite close but if we are even more precise we could simply use the words “Am” or “Is” while implying “Being-Knowing”. Even this description is still inadequate so we reach the limits of language and remain peacefully quiet. That’s what the Maharaj means when he says he is both, neither, and beyond both.

Me - Hey Charles, I didn’t appreciate how you tried boxing me in yesterday when you said you believe the reason I’m liberal is solely due to my father after I told you I didn’t want to go into politics. An apology will suffice

Charles - if youre serious we'll address this in person. these things can wait until face to face interaction because im not sure what the tone is. I'm not a fan of texting to begin with. but I meant no harm in what I said and I'll be glad to clarify in person

Me- Put your ego to the side and acknowledge what you said was arrogant

Charles - im not addressing this here. we'll talk in person.

Me- Either call me or say sorry via text and we can move forward

Charles - no. call me if you want.

me- What’s the big deal, are you in a meeting and can’t talk ?

Charles - I told u I don't like texting. either you call me or I see u in person. make the decision .

me - I have a better suggestion, if I decide to meet you in person will you promise to apologize ?. In addition, I’d like for you to explain why you think I’m not capable of formulating my own opinions and thoughts. Two things for you to reflect on. If you promise to apologize in person, I’ll come. Let me know. No insults, no threats will be exchanged.

Charles - I'm not promising anything. we'll talk like reasonable men.

me - What does that mean bro, it’s a simple question . Anyways, I can tell you are offended by the way you hung up on me. You changed from ""either call me or talk to me in person"" to ""talk to me in person"". Not so reasonable in my books I’ll be on campus after I finish my laundry and the clothes dry. Offended because I said ""ego guy"".

Charles : I’ll see u then

me - Saying sorry doesn’t make you less of a man, just want to put that out there. I’m letting you know now, if you don’t apologize within 2 minutes of meeting I’m walking away.

Charles - so don't come. I told u I don't respond well to threats. stop texting me I told you to meet there. we're reasonable men, im not worried about face to face interaction

me - That’s the issue, this isn’t a threat Charles it’s an expectation. Learn the difference

Charles - ok see u there.

me - Can I answer this truthfully? I don’t think you’ve been reasonable since I’ve addressed this head on. But, if you feel you have, please enlighten me . just out of curiosity, what does face to face change for you.

Charles - I told you stop texting me. I don't want to text.

me - Lastly, when you apologize within two minutes of meeting, you’re going to equally say sorry for claiming I was bullying you For someone who I’ve told my entire life to (especially in fine detail of how I was bullied) I’d assume you wouldn’t jump to that conclusion

Charles - see u there.

me - im not coming

Charles - I respect that im ready to meet when u are but I will have no one dictate what im going to say, how, and when, I have no problem apologizing but after discussing things in person. no weapons formed against me, including threats, shall prosper. see u soon.

me - I hear u and I respect your stance as well. I agree that it's important to have a real conversation in person. let's meet and talk things through. I just want to make sure we both have a constructive and respectful convo when the time comes. Just to clarify, I wasn't threatening nobody.

Charles - excellent, I admire this. let me know when.

me - to be frank, but you are being very unreasonable when someone addresses your arrogant comments.

Charles - there you go again, ill see u soon.

me - I don't appreciate this man, especially from you who is, more often than not, very understanding. this 180 flip doesn't make sense to me. at least tell me the time and place rather than repeatedly saying see u soon.

Charles - today anytime past 4.

me - cool.

\-as we're approaching 4.

Charles - lets make it after 5.

me - why what happened

Charles - ill be late if u come around that time.

me - why? dude, what changed. when we chat today, im not looking for arguments Charles. I hope ive made that clear im also not looking for passive aggressive behaviour like u did on the phone. if we even are going to chat today, I don't even know if youre going to show up.

Charles - ill see u after 5

me - not if you plan on arguing. I need a clear answer. Last time, u got extremely emotional during our convo and I don't want that to happen again.

(I call him and he doesn't pick up)

Charles - can I call u later ?

me - up to you. what time. be precise. Forget it, this is too much hassle for you to see how arrogant your comment was and it’s not guaranteed that you won’t be combattive. see u another day.

Charles - Ok. See you next time. Consider this friendship over. But I’m looking forward to taking about what you didn’t like about what I said and, if warranted, an apology will be made. Things will be cordial and amicable moving forward, but this friendship is over my dear bro. You are my brother in Christ, but a friendship is out of the question. I’ll hit u up for next time. I’m looking forward to it.

me - im coming. let me get dressed and ready my clothes is still drying

Charles - ok

me - would u like to have a meal together brother ?

Charles - thank you but im afraid I just ate. im down for coffee or tea while u eat.

me - if its gonna be our last time, lets eat don't be like that

Charles - im actually full no joke.

me - even some fries ? or an appetizer

Charles - a drink is the most I can. imagine was expecting to be at the library so I ate beforehand.

\-(we met in person and I already told u how the interaction went above, then I sent him this shortly after)

me - I don’t feel bad about myself Charles nor do I have low self esteem. I'm ok the way I am, Charles even much better than others This apology thing bothered you that much, to the point where you began insulting me and throwing all kinds of bad words in my direction. People do things in their life, sometimes bad sometimes good, even you joke about it when it happens. But you took it seriously today (even the texting) and threw unnecessary bad words against my character. Non stop. I’m not interested in ever being friends after this.
