I see people asking for good places to work away from home, and I just wanted to share one of my favourite places in Guelph at La Poche! Matthew has created this unique space that is host to haircuts and co-working by day, and jazz and drinks by night. 

I’m signed up for the monthly co-working, which is $50 a month or $5 per drop-in. You have unlimited access to the shop during open hours. There’s coffee for purchase, and a microwave for meals. I love the option to bring my own drink and food.

Just wanted to share one of my favourite spots in town, especially since the school year started. Maybe it can be your new study spot.

I love cats,I like to learn new languages, I tried Spanish for a while currently ik(Arabic, English, Urdu& Turkish) and I also like to spend time in kitchen, helping out and trying out new recipes
One last thing, I kinda have a silly habit of keeping things perfect(if you know Monica from friends, u got it!)

Looking for my best friend, at times life is tough and you only need that one person whose gonna mean everything to you in this world.

Here's my POV on Love and Being Understood:

I've always been interested in how people feel above love, what they claim to love, who they love, and what they say about love.
I think most people are loved more than they realize. But they also confuse being loved with being misunderstood. Occasionally, loneliness is brought on by being misunderstood rather than being unloved. Love is beautiful and spectacular. But being understood is even more so because it is rarer than love.


I believe one of the reasons we love quickly but understand slowly is because understanding necessitates solitude, introspection, and paying close attention to every aspect of a person.
Understanding entails having a unique empathy for other people and what they represent. This empathy is intentional but also carefree, passionate, and sincere.
Being understood is being free to be you always - love doesn't always offer us that.
And if we can find in somebody the potential to love and understand us, we have found an exceptional being.
Don't you think so?

Any more further questions? I will be happy to answer them!

I switch beans every month and it does well for some of the beans at around the 10 setting so much that it could choke the coffee machine . But for others even at a 1 setting the grind is still coarse and produces a watery shot. 

I have tried everything such as 

* Cleaning the grinder thoroughly by doing a full disassembly as shown on Baratza videos 

* Shimmed the grinder by adding the 2 additional shims 

I also contacted Baratza support who were not very helpful to be honest. They were happy to swap with a new one as the grinder is within warranty. 

However I feel I’ll end up encountering the same issues with the new grinder as well. I saw older threads here with similar issues.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

I am used to sipping a whole cup of instant coffee for half an hour, so having so low amount that i can gulp in one is really gamechanging. I am looking for ways that i could raise the amount of coffee i get.

  
1st option I thought of would be to add directly hot water to the espresso.   
2nd, I might add the hot water to the picopresso and run it through the same puck, but I am not sure if thats a good idea.  
3rd, buy a steamer for milk and make cappucino/latte. That would increase the ml of the drink without ruining the taste (i guess).

Six hours staring down vacant foyers with sickening fluorescents flickering overhead. And enough swill beers to manage the tedium and anaesthetise the small beastie crawling inside my cranium.

The shrink had told me that I should knacker off this nightshift job and take a load off on the sauce. ""It's exacerbating your mental health problems, the underlying anxiety and depression,"" the numpty had said. He also wanted me to go see a ""psychologist"" to sort out my anger issues. The prick even scribbled down some prescriptions for me to take the edge off, some tranquilizers or whatever. Bullshit. Booze is the only medicine I need. Shrinkage and pills are for pussies.

By night's end my head pounds like hammers on an industrial site.

""You utter muppet!"" I snarl at the fossilised idiot creeping over the road up ahead. The headlights barely cutting through the pre-dawn gloaming.

""Do you not even know how to steer a wheel?"" The fury in me floods over like the sewage behind my flat.

Finally I pull into the building's car park. Thank fuck. I made it home in one piece. Straight into bed, a refuge of scratched-up sheets and oblivion.

My skull hits the pillow and suddenly it starts up: that thud-thump-scratch racket from above. The bovine freak is at it again. Dragging crap around at the witching hour. I burrow further under the blankets, trying to suffocate myself. But the horrible din just won't let up. It's like this psycho wants to collapse the whole building down on top of us. ""STOP IT YOU CUNT!"" it bursts out of me.

Up the stairs I lumber, and start pounding on her door with both fists clenched, yelling ""OPEN THE DOOR NOW!""

She finally shambles to the door.

When the door cracks open it reveals the hideous vision. She's there, illuminated in a pale light that makes her look even uglier and more bloated than ever. Swollen eyes, mascara runny like snot down her face. An elephant with make-up.

""Don't you go to work?"" I blurt out, my words slathered in contempt.

""It's none of your business!"" she screeches back, her voice shrill and nasty, and slams the door shut.

I hammer away though. ""You're fired from your job again, aren't you?"" My chest is heaving. ""Just laze about at home now, making a ruckus. What are you doing? Sliding sofas and chairs across the floor like a munted lunatic?""

""I'm calling the coppers!"" she shouts through the wood.

Pathetic threat, like I give a shit. ""Is this your new way of wanking, you depraved, morbid cow?""

""You are insane,"" she roars back. ""You should be locked up in a lunatic asylum!""

I should be locked up? Hilarious, coming from the batshit crazy herself.

Another three minutes battering away at the door and my knuckles are howling for respite.

Finally giving in, I drag myself downstairs. There's that wrinkly geriatric gopher again on the landing.

""Hey neighbour!"" His chirpy greeting slices through me. My fist connects with the rotten carcass of his jaw. I wince. The pain feels like hammering an anvil into my own throbbing knuckles.

He crumbles under the weight of my punch, his face blood-soaked as he whimpers like a beaten puppy ""Oiii"".

""Fuck you,"" I growl.

Back in my flat, the coffee tastes like bitter bile. No reprieve, no solace for shattered sleep. 

This building has become a cesspit where human trash breeds and multiplies. Time to make an exit before this festering hive of misery consumes what little is left inside of me.

Chapter 1 Back From The Dead
""Josie, you know you screwed up, right?"" Vincent Oldham's voice yanked Josie Pearson out of her fog.

Her eyes zeroed in on his face, sharp and familiar.

'Wait, didn't I die?' she thought.

Two years after her mentor sold her out and landed her in prison, she'd hit rock bottom, crashing her head into a wall to escape the depression.

'So why am I staring at Vincent, my old college buddy?' Josie blinked hard, her eyes burning. 'Am I tripping again?

'Imagining my crew's here to spring me from jail?'

""Look, we get it—you're gunning to join Professor David Lawson's research team. But that's no excuse for throwing Natalie under the bus,"" Vincent said, his tone sharp.

""You realize what you've done? You accused Natalie of jacking your paper, and now she's so messed up she hasn't shown her face at school in days.

""Keep this up, Josie, and you're gonna push her off the deep end. When did you turn so cold-blooded?""

Vincent was getting pissed, slamming his coffee mug on the table when she didn't respond.

The sharp clunk snapped her out of it.

This wasn't a dream. She was really here, face-to-face with Vincent—ten years younger Vincent. Holy crap. She'd somehow jumped back a decade.

Right now, she was still a senior at Aloville Medical School, fresh off nailing the written exam for Professor David Lawson's elite research team.

She'd crushed it, landing a spot in the final round.

But then came the sucker punch: Natalie Kinberg's thesis was a near clone of hers—same angle, same methods, same vibe. No way that was a coincidence.

While Josie was digging for answers, rumors about Natalie plagiarizing spread like wildfire.

David's project was a big deal—first of its kind in the country, with a team of rockstar researchers, including five of Josie's seniors.

Those five had been her crew since sophomore year, always having her back in class and life. They were family.

Then Natalie showed up, and it all flipped. The support, the late-night study sessions, the laughs—they all went to her.

Even David, who used to praise Josie's grind, started treating Natalie like the star pupil.

When the plagiarism rumors hit, her seniors swore Josie was the one stirring the pot. Even David tore into her, face red with anger.

Josie wasn't Natalie's biggest fan, no lie. She'd been competitive, always trying to outshine her, desperate to reclaim the spotlight.

But she never spread those rumors or accused Natalie of stealing.

""You really blew it,"" Vincent said, his voice softening a bit. ""Professor Lawson's giving you a shot, though. Apologize to Natalie in front of the whole school, and he'll let it go.

""He'll even keep the administration from nailing you with a punishment.""

""But if you keep doubling down and dragging her name through the mud, you're done. Expulsion's on the table.""

""Fine. I'll apologize,"" Josie said, her voice flat, eyes locked on his.

Vincent was a year ahead, a small-town kid like her who'd fought his way into this school.

She'd known him longest—four years. She thought he'd have her back, trust her when she said she didn't start this drama.

Nope. He was the first one here, pushing her to eat crow.

Vincent blinked, caught off guard by her quick surrender. Josie didn't cave this easy, not the Josie he knew. Still, an apology was a win, so he didn't push.

""Alright, it's a deal,"" he said. ""I'll tell Professor Lawson. Write that apology letter tonight. You're reading it to the whole school tomorrow.""

Josie's lips curled into a sharp, bitter smirk.

She wasn't that gullible girl anymore. She knew the truth: Natalie spread those rumors herself, playing the victim to turn everyone against Josie.

Depression? Just a sob story to make the seniors fawn over her.

But that wasn't the point now. Josie wanted to know how Natalie jacked her thesis without leaving a trace.

In her old life, she'd refused to apologize. The mess blew up, the school investigated, and they found nothing on Natalie.

Meanwhile, Josie got hit with a disciplinary record, her seniors called her heartless, and that stain wrecked her job prospects after graduation.

Not this time. She wasn't taking the fall. If someone was going down, it sure as hell wouldn't be her.

The next morning, Josie steeled herself to eat humble pie and make her public apology.

She threw on her backpack and stepped out of the dorm, chin up despite the knot in her gut.

As she crossed campus, the whispers and side-eyes trailed her like a bad smell.

""There she is—Professor Lawson's former golden girl. Got all jealous and trashed the department's darling for supposedly jacking her paper.""

""She thought she was all that with her grades, catching the eye of our five campus hotties. Then Natalie rolls in—just as smart, drop-dead gorgeous, and actually nice.""

""Look at that sour face. She's not even in Natalie's league. Why those guys still have her back is beyond me.""

""Have her back? Please. They're all Team Natalie now. This whole 'say sorry in front of everyone' thing? Aiden's call.""

'Aiden's idea, huh?' Josie let out a sharp, bitter scoff and picked up her pace to dodge the gossip.

She'd barely hit the quad when Jaden Monroe, her senior, caught up.

Jaden was a first-year grad student who'd saved her bacon back in her senior year. She'd been floundering in her toughest classes, and he'd tossed her his killer notes, helping her ace her exams.

When he was stressing over grad school apps, Josie had pulled all-nighters hunting down research and reference books for him. She'd never owed him or any of the guys a thing.

Jaden shot her a look, heavy with disappointment. ""Josie, I always thought you were one of the good ones.

""Never figured you'd pull something this low just to get ahead. And Natalie? She's too kind to even hold it against you.

""You didn't see her after what you did. She's a mess—skinnier, totally worn out. Those big, bright eyes? No spark left.""

""And still, she's got your back. Went to Professor Lawson on the down-low, begging him to let you off this public apology crap. But you gotta have a heart, yeah?""

""So when you see her, you better say sorry—and mean it, okay?""

Josie dropped her gaze, lashes hiding the fire in her eyes. ""Got it, Jaden. I'll make things right with her, I swear.""

""Should've thought twice before pulling that stunt."" Jaden almost kept going, but seeing her stand there, head down like a kid who got caught, made him ease up.

Deep down, he'd always seen Josie as a solid kid—smart, hardworking, always chasing her academic dreams. Everyone respected her grind.

'So how the hell did she think screwing someone over for a spot was okay?' Jaden wondered, shaking his head. 'What a letdown.'

With a heavy sigh, Jaden led her toward Professor Lawson's office.

Chapter 2 Saying Sorry
The air in David's office was thick with tension as the whole team sat crammed inside.

When Josie walked in, the vibe turned frosty, faces souring like they'd bitten into a lemon.

Except for Natalie. She jumped up, flashing a grin bright enough to blind. ""Josie! You showed!""

""I'm here to say sorry,"" Josie said, sidestepping Natalie's grabby hands.

She didn't have Natalie's gift for playing nice with people she couldn't stand.

Natalie faltered, like she'd been caught off guard. ""Wait, you still think I'm shady, don't you?""

Her voice quivered, eyes glistening like she was about to bawl. ""I didn't copy your paper, Josie. Take it to the dean if you don't believe me. Let them figure it out.""

Josie dropped her gaze, looking more pathetic than Natalie's theatrics. ""I'm apologizing, okay? The papers looking so similar threw me, but I wasn't gonna snitch.

""I didn't breathe a word to anyone else.""

The team, who'd been glaring at Josie like she'd kicked a puppy, started to rethink things.

Josie wasn't a gossip—she barely had friends outside the lab. This drama? She'd only mentioned it to them.

Aiden's frown eased, his eyes settling on Josie. ""I buy that you didn't mean to stir the pot, but Natalie got burned.

""If you hadn't gone all detective, people wouldn't be whispering about her stealing your work.""

""An apology's not too much to ask,"" he added, arms crossed.

Aiden was the team's golden boy—brains, looks, the whole package.

Josie had picked this major partly because it was the med school's hot ticket, but let's be real: Aiden was a big reason too.

He'd been her hero once. Once. Not anymore.

""Fair point,"" Kyle Langton, another senior, chimed in. ""Josie, I'm with Aiden. You didn't mean to cause a mess.

""Natalie's a softie, so just smooth it over, and we're all cool.""

Josie nearly laughed. Natalie, a softie? Yeah, right. But she zipped it. ""Got it, Kyle. I'll fix this.""

Turning to Natalie, she said, ""I'm sorry, Natalie. I messed up, and it hurt you. Honest—can we move past this?""

Then it hit her. Josie had been tight with this crew for years before Natalie rolled in. Breaking that bond? Tougher than she thought.

Natalie flashed a sugary smile. ""Josie, I was never mad! Forgive? Psh, nothing to forgive!""

She spun to David, plopping down beside him with a flirty grin, voice all sweet. ""Told ya, Professor Lawson. Josie wouldn't try to screw me over. Cut her some slack, yeah?""

Lawson wasn't biting. His face was hard as granite, shooting Josie a look that could freeze lava. ""On purpose or not, she screwed up. And screw-ups have consequences. So, Josie, how should I deal with you?""

David's face was like stone as he shot Josie a hard stare.

He'd always thought she was the good girl—smart, driven, a total overachiever. Now? He wasn't so sure.

To him, grades were one thing, but a shady character was a dealbreaker. 'She's gotta learn her lesson,' he decided. 'No more badmouthing her classmates.'

Josie had puzzled over why everyone bought Natalie's act. After some soul-searching, it clicked: Natalie was gorgeous and a master at playing the damsel.

Josie couldn't compete. So she swallowed her pride. ""Whatever you say, Professor Lawson.""

""We're kicking off research soon,"" David said, voice sharp. ""Your punishment? Sort every scrap of data. Make it so we can grab what we need, no fuss, no muss.""

He waved them off.

As they headed out, Josie, stuck in the middle, flashed back to her old life.

She'd been slapped with a disciplinary note and kicked off the team. To make things right, she'd buried herself in the archives, sorting documents like a machine.

It took a brutal month—one meal a day, late nights, the works. She ended up with a messed-up stomach and flunked classes.

And the thanks? Nada. They just griped her work wasn't good enough.

'What a load of crap,' she thought. 'Bust your tail, and they still dump on you.'

Now, here she was again, stuck with the same lousy job.

""Hey, Josie, I'll help you out,"" Natalie said, catching up and linking arms with her. ""If I keep my mouth shut, the prof won't know.""

""She's got this coming,"" Jaden cut in, pulling Natalie back. ""Why cover for her?""

Vincent glanced at Natalie. ""Chill about Professor Lawson. Sorting files is nothing compared to a real punishment.""

""Got it, thanks, Vince,"" Josie said with a quick smile, hurrying after Natalie.

""Hey, Nat, I was so caught up saying sorry earlier, I forgot—I got you a little something."" She pulled a sleek box from her bag.

The group stopped cold, crowding around.

""That Aiden's medal?"" Tianna blurted.

Vincent nodded. ""Yeah, his first big win in that med competition. He loved that thing—till he gave it to you to cheer you up.""

""Spot on,"" Josie said, eyeing the group. ""I was new, totally bombed an experiment, and Professor Lawson chewed me out. Aiden gave me this medal, said it was lucky.

""And you know what? After that, I was golden—no more screw-ups.""

She held the box out to Natalie. ""Natalie, I heard this mess really got you down—depression and all. Take this. It's like a good-luck charm.

""You'll be set from now on. Aiden swore by it.""

Natalie's eyes lit up. She wanted that medal. Not just for its shine, but because it was Aiden's—his first victory, something special.

In her eyes, Josie didn't deserve it. But snagging it right in front of him? That was ballsy.

""Josie, that's sweet, but it's Aiden's gift to you,"" Natalie said, pushing the box back. ""I can't take it.""

1nw4ck1,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1nw4ck1/the_family_rule_of_three_knocks/,The Family Rule of Three Knocks,"It wasn’t a fancy rule, written on parchment or anything. It wasn’t even something we talked about often. It was just a thing we knew, my wife Clara and I, a piece of unspoken family law as fundamental as looking both ways before crossing the street. If you hear three knocks at the door and no one is there, you do not acknowledge it. You don’t say “Who’s there?” You don’t go to the window and peek out. You absolutely do not, under any circumstances, open the door. You just… go about your business. You pretend it was the house settling, or a kid playing a prank, and you wait for the feeling to pass.

We’d each heard it a handful of times over the years living in our little split-level on the edge of town. A trio of sharp, polite raps that would cut through the evening quiet. Knock. Knock. Knock. Always evenly spaced. Always at the front door. The first time it happened to me, I was the one who broke the rule. I was alone watching a game. I shouted “Yeah, hang on!” and muted the TV. My hand was on the cool brass of the knob when I looked through the peephole at an empty porch. A faint, sweet smell, like a bouquet of old flowers left in wet soil, leaked into the house. I wrote it off as a prank, but later, when I went to check the lock, my fingers came away from the metal slightly damp and cold, as if someone with endlessly sweating skin had been gripping it from the other side.

Clara told me the rule after it happened to her. “It’s just one of those things,” she’d said, not looking up from the shirt she was folding. “You hear it, you ignore it. It goes away. Mom said if you acknowledge it, you invite it in.”

It sounded like superstitious nonsense, the kind of thing you laugh about but quietly obey. So we obeyed. We heard the knocks, we froze, and then we’d deliberately turn up the volume on the TV. It always worked. The feeling of being watched would fade, and the night would return to normal.

The problems started about a month after our son, Leo, turned two.

It was a Tuesday. I was giving Leo his bath before bed. He was splashing happily, driving a plastic tugboat through the sudsy water. The bathroom door was open a crack, and down the hall, I could hear Clara loading the dishwasher. Then, the knocks came.

Knock. Knock. Knock.

They were perfectly clear, cutting through the domestic sounds like a scalpel. Leo stopped his playing. His little head swiveled towards the bathroom door, his eyes wide. My own heart clenched. We looked at each other, me and my son, in a moment of shared, silent understanding. The rule was in effect.

“Clara?” I called out, my voice tighter than I intended.

“I heard it,” she called back from the kitchen, her tone deliberately calm and flat. “I’m just finishing up these plates.”

I focused on Leo. “Okay, captain, time to get the ship out of dry dock,” I said, my voice a forced, cheerful parody of itself. I reached for a towel. Leo didn’t move. He was still staring at the door, his brow furrowed in concentration.

Then, his clear, little voice piped up. “Hello?”

My blood went cold. “No, Leo,” I said, too sharply. I grabbed his arm, probably too hard. He flinched and looked at me, his face crumpling in confusion. “We don’t… we don’t talk when we hear that.”

“Man at door?” he asked, his lower lip trembling.

“There’s no man,” I said, wrapping him tightly in the towel and lifting him out of the tub. My hands were shaking. As I carried him into his room, my ears straining for any sound, I noticed the damp bathmat was already starting to mildew at the corners, a dark, spreading blackness that hadn't been there an hour ago.

When I came out, Clara was waiting for me in the hall, her arms crossed. Her face was pale. “He spoke to it, Mark.”

“I know. I was right there. He’s two, Clara. He doesn’t know the rules.”

“He does now,” she said, her voice barely a whisper. “We have to make sure he understands.”

We tried. Over the next few days, we talked to Leo about the rule, framing it in simple terms. “The knock-knock at the door is a quiet game,” we told him. “When we hear it, we have to be super quiet mice. No talking!” He’d nod, serious, and say, “Quiet mouse.” We thought he got it.

A week later, it happened again. We were all in the living room, building a fortress of couch cushions. The knocks came. Knock. Knock. Knock.

Clara and I froze mid-action, a cushion held between us. We looked at each other, then at Leo. He was sitting amidst the pillow pile, his favorite stuffed dog in his arms. He looked at the front door, then back at us, and put a single chubby finger to his lips. “Shhh,” he whispered. “Quiet mouse.”

Relief flooded through me so powerfully I felt dizzy. “That’s right, buddy,” I whispered back. “Good job.”

We sat in silence for a full five minutes, not moving. The house was utterly still. Finally, Clara let out a long, shaky breath. “I think it’s gone.”

We resumed our lives, but the atmosphere in the house had changed. It was like the air itself was holding its breath. Small things started going wrong with a new, malicious consistency. The central heating would kick on with a smell of burning dust and that underlying sweetness of decay. The lights in the hallway would flicker every night at exactly 9:17 PM. I’d find the cabinet under the kitchen sink standing open, its sticky hinge now slick with a thin, clear film that smelled faintly of pond water.

Then the conversations started.

It was naptime. The baby monitor on our nightstand was on, hissing with soft static that sometimes coalesced into a sound like dry reeds scraping together. I was lying down, reading, when I heard Leo stir.

“Hello?” Leo’s voice came through the speaker, small and clear.

I smiled, expecting him to launch into a game of pretend.

A different voice answered. It was low, raspy, and granular, filtered through the monitor’s cheap speaker. It sounded like stones grinding together under slow, deep water. “Hello, Leo.”

I sat bolt upright, the book falling from my hands. My heart was a hammer in my throat.

“Who you?” Leo asked, curious, not scared.

“I am the man who knocks,” the gravelly voice replied. There was a pause that went on too long, a silence that didn't need to breathe. “You invited me.”

“You at door?”

“Not today,” the voice said, horribly patient. “Today, I am closer.”

I was out of bed and flying down the hall before I even had a conscious thought. I threw open Leo’s door. He was sitting up in his crib, looking perfectly content, clutching his stuffed dog. The room was empty. The window was closed and locked. There was no one else there.

“Leo? Who were you talking to?” I asked, my voice trembling.

He looked at me and smiled. “The knock-knock man. He’s nice.”

I ripped the battery pack out of the baby monitor that night. Clara, when I told her, wanted to call a priest, a psychic, someone. I convinced her it was a fluke, a crossed signal. I bought a new, digital monitor the next day. The conversations stopped, but other things began.

Leo’s drawings, once cheerful scribbles of suns and animals, changed. He started drawing tall, stick-like figures with no faces. He’d color them in with a black crayon, pressing down so hard the paper would tear. He called them his “knock-knock friends.” One drawing, taped to the fridge, showed a black stick figure holding the hand of a smaller, red one. The red one had a big, smiling sun where its face should be. Leo said it was him and his new friend going for a walk.

One afternoon, I found him in the backyard, standing by the fence that separated our property from the woods. He was having an animated, one-sided conversation.
“Yeah,I have a dog,” he was saying, holding up his stuffed toy. “His name is Woof-Woof. You have a dog?”
I followed his gaze.There was nothing there but the dark line of trees.
“Leo,”I said, trying to keep the panic out of my voice. “Who are you talking to?”
He pointed a finger towards the empty tree line.“The man. He says he’s lonely. He wants me to come play.”

The entity—the man who knocks—was no longer confined to the door. The rule was broken, and by breaking it, Leo had given it permission to come closer. It was in the static, in his dreams, in his drawings, just outside the fence. The fundamental safety of our home was gone.

The final straw was the chair. Our kitchen had a small nook with a table and two chairs. One morning, I came down for coffee and found one of the chairs pulled out from the table. It was facing the back window. On the seat was one of Leo’s drawings, a frantic, black scribble. The air around the chair was cold, and the sweet, rotten smell was so strong it made my eyes water. When I went to push the chair in, the wood of the seat was damp and soft, like rotting pulp, and came away on my fingertips in a black, fibrous residue.

I knew, then, that it was inside. Fully inside.

That night, after we put Leo to bed in our room, Clara and I sat at the kitchen table, the pulled-out chair between us. We were past fear and into a numb, hollow exhaustion.

“We have to leave, Mark,” Clara said, her voice raw. “We can’t stay here.”

“And go where?” I asked, staring at the empty chair. “What if it follows him? It’s not attached to the house, Clara. It’s attached to him now.”

We sat in silence, the truth of it hanging between us. Running wasn't the answer. We had to… un-invite it.

That’s when I remembered the rest of what Clara’s mother had said, the part we’d always dismissed. She’d said the rule worked because silence was a wall. Acknowledgement was a door. But if a door is opened, it can be closed.

It was a desperate, crazy gamble, but it was all we had.

The next evening, after dinner, I took Leo by the hand and led him to the front door. Clara stood behind us, her hands on my shoulders for support, her knuckles white.

“Leo,” I said, kneeling down to his level. “We’re going to play one more game with the knock-knock man. This is the last game, okay? We’re going to tell him the game is over.”

Leo looked at me, his eyes solemn. “Okay, Daddy.”

I took a deep breath, my heart pounding so hard I could feel it in my teeth. I looked directly at the front door.

“You are not welcome here,” I said, my voice clear and strong, belying the terror coursing through me. “The game is over. You have to go away now. We do not want to talk to you. We do not want to see you. You are not allowed here anymore.”

I looked down at Leo. “Your turn, buddy. Say ‘Go away.’”

Leo looked at the door, his little face set in a determined frown. “Go ‘way!” he shouted. “No more games! Bye-bye!”

We stood there, holding our breath. For a moment, nothing happened. Then, the temperature in the hallway dropped sharply. From the other side of the door, so quiet we almost missed it, came a sound—not a knock, but a long, slow, dragging scrape, like a root being pulled through mud. Then, silence. True silence. The oppressive weight that had filled the house for weeks was just… gone.

Clara burst into tears of relief. I felt a giddy, disbelieving laugh bubble up in my chest. We had done it.

For three weeks, it seemed like we were right. The knocks didn’t return. The house stayed warm. Leo’s drawings went back to trucks and smiling, lopsided suns. He stopped talking to an empty yard. He stopped mentioning the “knock-knock man” entirely. We started to breathe again.

That’s why it took us a few days to realize the new silence in our son was wrong.

He stopped asking for his favorite foods. He stopped running to the door when I came home from work. His laughter, which used to fill the house, was gone. He would sit for hours, just staring at the wall, his stuffed dog lying forgotten beside him. His eyes, once so bright and curious, were flat and distant. It was like watching a light being slowly turned off from the inside out.

Last night, I was tucking him into bed. He was so still. I leaned in to kiss his forehead, and my lips brushed against his skin. It was cold. And it was rough.

I pulled back, my blood freezing in my veins. In the dim nightlight, I saw it. A patch of skin on his cheek, just below his eye, was no longer skin. It was dark, textured, and covered in a fine, bark-like pattern. It was hard and cool to the touch. And from it, and from his parted lips as he slept, came the faint, sweet, and unmistakable smell of old flowers and wet, rotting earth.

We didn’t just invite it in. We gave it a place to stay. We gave it a son. The man who knocks doesn't need to knock anymore. He’s already here, sitting in the high chair, staring at us with our little boy’s vacant eyes, waiting for the rest of him to finish turning.",1,1759413048.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

Chapter 1 Back From The Dead
""Josie, you know you screwed up, right?"" Vincent Oldham's voice yanked Josie Pearson out of her fog.

Her eyes zeroed in on his face, sharp and familiar.

'Wait, didn't I die?' she thought.

Two years after her mentor sold her out and landed her in prison, she'd hit rock bottom, crashing her head into a wall to escape the depression.

'So why am I staring at Vincent, my old college buddy?' Josie blinked hard, her eyes burning. 'Am I tripping again?

'Imagining my crew's here to spring me from jail?'

""Look, we get it—you're gunning to join Professor David Lawson's research team. But that's no excuse for throwing Natalie under the bus,"" Vincent said, his tone sharp.

""You realize what you've done? You accused Natalie of jacking your paper, and now she's so messed up she hasn't shown her face at school in days.

""Keep this up, Josie, and you're gonna push her off the deep end. When did you turn so cold-blooded?""

Vincent was getting pissed, slamming his coffee mug on the table when she didn't respond.

The sharp clunk snapped her out of it.

This wasn't a dream. She was really here, face-to-face with Vincent—ten years younger Vincent. Holy crap. She'd somehow jumped back a decade.

Right now, she was still a senior at Aloville Medical School, fresh off nailing the written exam for Professor David Lawson's elite research team.

She'd crushed it, landing a spot in the final round.

But then came the sucker punch: Natalie Kinberg's thesis was a near clone of hers—same angle, same methods, same vibe. No way that was a coincidence.

While Josie was digging for answers, rumors about Natalie plagiarizing spread like wildfire.

David's project was a big deal—first of its kind in the country, with a team of rockstar researchers, including five of Josie's seniors.

Those five had been her crew since sophomore year, always having her back in class and life. They were family.

Then Natalie showed up, and it all flipped. The support, the late-night study sessions, the laughs—they all went to her.

Even David, who used to praise Josie's grind, started treating Natalie like the star pupil.

When the plagiarism rumors hit, her seniors swore Josie was the one stirring the pot. Even David tore into her, face red with anger.

Josie wasn't Natalie's biggest fan, no lie. She'd been competitive, always trying to outshine her, desperate to reclaim the spotlight.

But she never spread those rumors or accused Natalie of stealing.

""You really blew it,"" Vincent said, his voice softening a bit. ""Professor Lawson's giving you a shot, though. Apologize to Natalie in front of the whole school, and he'll let it go.

""He'll even keep the administration from nailing you with a punishment.""

""But if you keep doubling down and dragging her name through the mud, you're done. Expulsion's on the table.""

""Fine. I'll apologize,"" Josie said, her voice flat, eyes locked on his.

Vincent was a year ahead, a small-town kid like her who'd fought his way into this school.

She'd known him longest—four years. She thought he'd have her back, trust her when she said she didn't start this drama.

Nope. He was the first one here, pushing her to eat crow.

Vincent blinked, caught off guard by her quick surrender. Josie didn't cave this easy, not the Josie he knew. Still, an apology was a win, so he didn't push.

""Alright, it's a deal,"" he said. ""I'll tell Professor Lawson. Write that apology letter tonight. You're reading it to the whole school tomorrow.""

Josie's lips curled into a sharp, bitter smirk.

She wasn't that gullible girl anymore. She knew the truth: Natalie spread those rumors herself, playing the victim to turn everyone against Josie.

Depression? Just a sob story to make the seniors fawn over her.

But that wasn't the point now. Josie wanted to know how Natalie jacked her thesis without leaving a trace.

In her old life, she'd refused to apologize. The mess blew up, the school investigated, and they found nothing on Natalie.

Meanwhile, Josie got hit with a disciplinary record, her seniors called her heartless, and that stain wrecked her job prospects after graduation.

Not this time. She wasn't taking the fall. If someone was going down, it sure as hell wouldn't be her.

The next morning, Josie steeled herself to eat humble pie and make her public apology.

She threw on her backpack and stepped out of the dorm, chin up despite the knot in her gut.

As she crossed campus, the whispers and side-eyes trailed her like a bad smell.

""There she is—Professor Lawson's former golden girl. Got all jealous and trashed the department's darling for supposedly jacking her paper.""

""She thought she was all that with her grades, catching the eye of our five campus hotties. Then Natalie rolls in—just as smart, drop-dead gorgeous, and actually nice.""

""Look at that sour face. She's not even in Natalie's league. Why those guys still have her back is beyond me.""

""Have her back? Please. They're all Team Natalie now. This whole 'say sorry in front of everyone' thing? Aiden's call.""

'Aiden's idea, huh?' Josie let out a sharp, bitter scoff and picked up her pace to dodge the gossip.

She'd barely hit the quad when Jaden Monroe, her senior, caught up.

Jaden was a first-year grad student who'd saved her bacon back in her senior year. She'd been floundering in her toughest classes, and he'd tossed her his killer notes, helping her ace her exams.

When he was stressing over grad school apps, Josie had pulled all-nighters hunting down research and reference books for him. She'd never owed him or any of the guys a thing.

Jaden shot her a look, heavy with disappointment. ""Josie, I always thought you were one of the good ones.

""Never figured you'd pull something this low just to get ahead. And Natalie? She's too kind to even hold it against you.

""You didn't see her after what you did. She's a mess—skinnier, totally worn out. Those big, bright eyes? No spark left.""

""And still, she's got your back. Went to Professor Lawson on the down-low, begging him to let you off this public apology crap. But you gotta have a heart, yeah?""

""So when you see her, you better say sorry—and mean it, okay?""

Josie dropped her gaze, lashes hiding the fire in her eyes. ""Got it, Jaden. I'll make things right with her, I swear.""

""Should've thought twice before pulling that stunt."" Jaden almost kept going, but seeing her stand there, head down like a kid who got caught, made him ease up.

Deep down, he'd always seen Josie as a solid kid—smart, hardworking, always chasing her academic dreams. Everyone respected her grind.

'So how the hell did she think screwing someone over for a spot was okay?' Jaden wondered, shaking his head. 'What a letdown.'

With a heavy sigh, Jaden led her toward Professor Lawson's office.

Chapter 2 Saying Sorry
The air in David's office was thick with tension as the whole team sat crammed inside.

When Josie walked in, the vibe turned frosty, faces souring like they'd bitten into a lemon.

Except for Natalie. She jumped up, flashing a grin bright enough to blind. ""Josie! You showed!""

""I'm here to say sorry,"" Josie said, sidestepping Natalie's grabby hands.

She didn't have Natalie's gift for playing nice with people she couldn't stand.

Natalie faltered, like she'd been caught off guard. ""Wait, you still think I'm shady, don't you?""

Her voice quivered, eyes glistening like she was about to bawl. ""I didn't copy your paper, Josie. Take it to the dean if you don't believe me. Let them figure it out.""

Josie dropped her gaze, looking more pathetic than Natalie's theatrics. ""I'm apologizing, okay? The papers looking so similar threw me, but I wasn't gonna snitch.

""I didn't breathe a word to anyone else.""

The team, who'd been glaring at Josie like she'd kicked a puppy, started to rethink things.

Josie wasn't a gossip—she barely had friends outside the lab. This drama? She'd only mentioned it to them.

Aiden's frown eased, his eyes settling on Josie. ""I buy that you didn't mean to stir the pot, but Natalie got burned.

""If you hadn't gone all detective, people wouldn't be whispering about her stealing your work.""

""An apology's not too much to ask,"" he added, arms crossed.

Aiden was the team's golden boy—brains, looks, the whole package.

Josie had picked this major partly because it was the med school's hot ticket, but let's be real: Aiden was a big reason too.

He'd been her hero once. Once. Not anymore.

""Fair point,"" Kyle Langton, another senior, chimed in. ""Josie, I'm with Aiden. You didn't mean to cause a mess.

""Natalie's a softie, so just smooth it over, and we're all cool.""

Josie nearly laughed. Natalie, a softie? Yeah, right. But she zipped it. ""Got it, Kyle. I'll fix this.""

Turning to Natalie, she said, ""I'm sorry, Natalie. I messed up, and it hurt you. Honest—can we move past this?""

Then it hit her. Josie had been tight with this crew for years before Natalie rolled in. Breaking that bond? Tougher than she thought.

Natalie flashed a sugary smile. ""Josie, I was never mad! Forgive? Psh, nothing to forgive!""

She spun to David, plopping down beside him with a flirty grin, voice all sweet. ""Told ya, Professor Lawson. Josie wouldn't try to screw me over. Cut her some slack, yeah?""

Lawson wasn't biting. His face was hard as granite, shooting Josie a look that could freeze lava. ""On purpose or not, she screwed up. And screw-ups have consequences. So, Josie, how should I deal with you?""

David's face was like stone as he shot Josie a hard stare.

He'd always thought she was the good girl—smart, driven, a total overachiever. Now? He wasn't so sure.

To him, grades were one thing, but a shady character was a dealbreaker. 'She's gotta learn her lesson,' he decided. 'No more badmouthing her classmates.'

Josie had puzzled over why everyone bought Natalie's act. After some soul-searching, it clicked: Natalie was gorgeous and a master at playing the damsel.

Josie couldn't compete. So she swallowed her pride. ""Whatever you say, Professor Lawson.""

""We're kicking off research soon,"" David said, voice sharp. ""Your punishment? Sort every scrap of data. Make it so we can grab what we need, no fuss, no muss.""

He waved them off.

As they headed out, Josie, stuck in the middle, flashed back to her old life.

She'd been slapped with a disciplinary note and kicked off the team. To make things right, she'd buried herself in the archives, sorting documents like a machine.

It took a brutal month—one meal a day, late nights, the works. She ended up with a messed-up stomach and flunked classes.

And the thanks? Nada. They just griped her work wasn't good enough.

'What a load of crap,' she thought. 'Bust your tail, and they still dump on you.'

Now, here she was again, stuck with the same lousy job.

""Hey, Josie, I'll help you out,"" Natalie said, catching up and linking arms with her. ""If I keep my mouth shut, the prof won't know.""

""She's got this coming,"" Jaden cut in, pulling Natalie back. ""Why cover for her?""

Vincent glanced at Natalie. ""Chill about Professor Lawson. Sorting files is nothing compared to a real punishment.""

""Got it, thanks, Vince,"" Josie said with a quick smile, hurrying after Natalie.

""Hey, Nat, I was so caught up saying sorry earlier, I forgot—I got you a little something."" She pulled a sleek box from her bag.

The group stopped cold, crowding around.

""That Aiden's medal?"" Tianna blurted.

Vincent nodded. ""Yeah, his first big win in that med competition. He loved that thing—till he gave it to you to cheer you up.""

""Spot on,"" Josie said, eyeing the group. ""I was new, totally bombed an experiment, and Professor Lawson chewed me out. Aiden gave me this medal, said it was lucky.

""And you know what? After that, I was golden—no more screw-ups.""

She held the box out to Natalie. ""Natalie, I heard this mess really got you down—depression and all. Take this. It's like a good-luck charm.

""You'll be set from now on. Aiden swore by it.""

Natalie's eyes lit up. She wanted that medal. Not just for its shine, but because it was Aiden's—his first victory, something special.

In her eyes, Josie didn't deserve it. But snagging it right in front of him? That was ballsy.

""Josie, that's sweet, but it's Aiden's gift to you,"" Natalie said, pushing the box back. ""I can't take it.""

I’m working on getting a routine down so I can workout regularly again. I’m studying to learn code to advance my long term career goals further. And I’m currently writing a novel. I want someone who can see that while I’m not perfect, I am trying my best to work at my life and to be a better me.

I’ve spent most my life feeling alone due to health complications. I want a chance at happiness with someone regardless of my weaknesses. 

One thing you’ll find with me is genuine honesty. I might sometimes be blunt, but I’ll never sugarcoat things typically. That means you’ll have someone who’s trustworthy, and someone who will want to help you be the best you can be too.

I’m pretty big with nerdy things. I grew up watching things like anime. Playing tcg’s like Pokemon, yugioh, nowadays mtg. And I’m pretty big with gaming. I hope one day to get enough people to play a ttjrpg called Fabula Ultima. 

Music and art is something I really love. A fond memory of mine was seeing Phantom of the Opera on broadway as a senior in high school. I typically practice singing pretty regularly. I also played the trumpet growing up. I was considered to be a virtuoso as a teen. I did some acting, and was always involved with art courses like painting or creative writing.

I have a dream to finally get a black belt in Shaolin-do one day. I want to work on general fitness again so I can return to classes.

Oh, and I’ve been making handcrafted coffee and tea for close to four years now. I’m particularly proficient with pour over coffee.

I was taught growing up how to be self sufficient. Cleaning, cooking, house repairs, furniture and electronic work, that sort of thing. 

I really wanna find someone who is genuine, loyal, kind, mature, and warm to be around. Someone I can be vulnerable with. Someone I can share my life and dreams with. Someone to explore the world and I can support. Someone I can make smile and laugh.

*By Your Humorously Analytical Sports Oracle*

---

**1. Parse the Odds: Numbers Don’t Lie (Mostly)**  
Fenerbahçe enters this Europa League clash as the undisputed favorite, with odds hovering around **1.71 to 1.80** for a straight win (implying a **55-58% chance**). Nice? They’re priced at **4.0 to 4.3** (a **20-23% chance**), which is about as likely as me understanding modern art. The draw sits at **3.8 to 4.0** (25-27%), but let’s be real—this isn’t a “let’s kick it and see” match.

The spread favors Fenerbahçe by **-0.5 to -0.75**, meaning they’re expected to win by at least a goal. For totals, the **Under 3.0 goals** is priced at **1.77 to 1.82**, while the Over is a less appealing **2.0 to 2.02**. Given Fenerbahçe’s disciplined defense (they’ve kept clean sheets in 5 of their last 7 home games) and Nice’s leaky away record (4 losses in 5), the Under is a no-brainer.

**Key stat to savor**: Fenerbahçe’s home form is as reliable as a Turkish coffee pot—8 wins in 10 games. Meanwhile, Nice has lost **6 of 9 matches** since August, including a 2-1 home defeat to Roma. They’re the footballing equivalent of a sieve: porous, baffling, and occasionally leaking goals in the 93rd minute.

---

**2. Digest the News: Injuries, Form, and Why Nice Should Bring an Umbrella**  
Fenerbahçe’s starting XI is stacked with experience: Fred and Ismail Yokus dominate midfield, while En-Nesyri (4 goals in 7 Süper Lig games) is a striker who could make Nice’s defenders feel like they’re playing with their hands tied. The only injury concern? None listed! Their lineup reads like a who’s who of “players who don’t trip over their own shoelaces.”

Nice, on the other hand, is a team in crisis. Their away record is worse than a toddler’s nap schedule—**4 losses in 5 games**. Key players like Abdoulaye Diop and Allan Saint-Maximin are missing, and their counterattacks rely on the same unpredictability as a cat walking on a keyboard. Oh, and they

But that night, the lights guided me somewhere else—toward the truth I had been too loyal to see. The Southplay concert was my gift for Liam. Our miracle boy. Our fighter. I pulled strings, moved mountains, just to give him one night where his failing heart didn’t define him. And then… the Kiss Cam happened.

“Mom, look. That’s Dad!”

Up on the big screen, on the jumbotron, was—Zachary Hatton, my husband. The untouchable CEO of Orion Records. Said he was in Maldives on a business trip. But there, in a VIP seat, was his newly-hired assistant—Celine Lovelet.

Her head on his shoulder. His arm around her body. The camera lingered. The crowd cheered. My world blurred but I bent the justice.

I filed for divorce.

No press conference.

No drama.

Just dignity—served cold.

I'll leave him.

And this time, I’m walking away and will try… to fix me in everglow.

\--

A viral clip.

A successful man.

A concert crowd.

And one very public moment of betrayal.

I heard his car before I saw him—engine too desperate, like it was trying to outrun the damage already done. I didn’t move from the couch. I sat there, spine straight, heart hollow, folding Liam’s blanket over and over in my lap like it could stop my hands from shaking. The door creaked open, revealing him.

“Arianne,” Zach said, breathless. He closed the door behind him like this was still his home.

I looked up slowly, meeting his eyes. My husband. In the flesh. Still wearing the shirt from the night before—creased and tainted by the ghost of another woman’s perfume. His assistant. His alibi. His filthy mistress.

“You lied,” I said.

He flinched at how even my voice was. He probably expected fire. Instead, he got ice.

“Please, let me explain,” he said, stepping forward.

I held up a hand, stopping him at once. “Explain what? That you weren’t in Maldives? That the camera angle was misleading? That the arm around her wasn’t yours? Or that you somehow tripped and landed in her embrace while the crowd cheered?”

His lips parted. Nothing came out.

“You knew Liam wanted you there,” I said. “He asked if we could save a seat for you. He looked up at the screen and said, ‘Mom, that’s Dad!’—with pride, Zach. Pride.”

He winced at the coldness in my voice. “It wasn’t supposed to happen like that.”

“But it did.” I stood now, slower than I wanted to, because grief weighs more than rage. “And what do I tell our son, huh? That his father skipped his favorite night to kiss his secretary under stadium lights?”

“You’re exaggerating. It wasn’t a kiss,” he roared, clenching his fist.

“You kissed her shoulder.” My voice cracked. “You smiled, Zach. You were proud of what you did.”

“I made a mistake, yes. But I am unfairly judged there.”

“No, Zach,” I whispered. “Your choices are made the moment you flirt with that woman.”

He stepped closer. “Ari—please. You know how hard this industry is. The pressure. The image. The partnerships. Sometimes it gets blurry—”

“I bore your son while you were building your empire,” I snapped. “There’s nothing blurry about betrayal.”

That shut him up. His lips stretched into a thin line. But that kind of silence makes you realize how many words were never said, and how many were just noise. I stared at him. Not the man I married, but the man he became—slick, tired, hollow, a cheat. Never enough to hold on to.

Then I walked over to the kitchen drawer—the one where I used to keep Liam’s vitamins and little love notes from when Zach still left them. Now, it held something else. I dropped the envelope on the marble counter, making his face pale.

“No.” He shook his head vehemently. “You’re not doing this, Ari. You’re upset, but you’re not—”

“I’m so done with you,” I said, my voice steady. “And not just with this conversation. With all the lies you made. With the emotional coupons you hand me every time you mess up and call it pressure. With being the woman you only remember when your guilt knocks louder than your ego.”

“This is absurd, Ari,” he snapped, gritting his teeth.

“You know what’s absurd? It’s that you tried your best hiding your affair, but you didn't succeed.”

He looked down at the papers in his hand like they burned in his palm. Heavy. Final.

“So, you’re ending our marriage over a camera clip?” he asked, smirking.

I squared my shoulders and glared at him. “I’m ending it because you taught me something last night.” I paused, my voice barely above a whisper. “I realized that love doesn’t always die in shouting. Sometimes, it dies in the silence after a song ends—and the person you were waiting for… never showed up.”

“Come on, Arianne. We could settle this like we always do.”

“Stop right there,” I immediately cut him off. I leaned in, our faces hairbreadth as I went on, “I had no idea what’s happening between you and Celine behind closed doors, but what I saw was enough for me to give up this marriage. You ruined my trust, Zach.”

He looked at me like, really hard. “Fine. You asked for it. My lawyer will send you a copy after I sign the papers.”

“Tell Liam whatever truth you think he can carry,"" I added. “But know this—he saw you before I did.”

Then he turned away. He didn’t apologize, just shut the door closed behind me.

Chapter 2: Aftermath of Getting Viral

Morning came slowly each passing day. The house felt too quiet—like even the walls were trying to make space for the fallout. I stood by the kitchen sink, watching sunlight pour over the untouched breakfast table.

There were no coffee cups anymore. No phone calls buzzing from Zach’s office upstairs. Just the sound of Liam’s pencil scratching faintly against paper in the living room. He wasn’t asking questions. And that, somehow, hurt worse. I carried a glass of water to him, watching his small hands trace lazy shapes in his notebook.

“Draw anything good?”

He held up the page. It was a cartoon version of the concert crowd. He’d drawn me and him, hands up in the air, smiling—before the moment everything flipped.

“Memory rewrite,” he said with a grin.

A part of me cracked open at that. Not from sadness, but from the quiet strength in his voice. That my ten-year-old, sick as he was, understood something I had spent years ignoring.

I kissed the top of his head. “You want to talk about it?” I asked gently.

He looked up, eyes tired but sharp. “Everyone at school saw the clip.”

I sat beside him. “I know.”

He pressed his lips together and carefully asked, “Did you give him the divorce papers already?”

I nodded once. “Yeah. The day after the concert.”

He exhaled like a grown man. “He texted me yesterday. Said he might come by today,” Liam added, almost like an afterthought. “But I told him not to.”

I blinked. “You did?”

Liam shrugged. “And I don’t want to see him…yet.”

“Me too.”

Liam held my hand and said, “Don't worry, Mom. I will never hurt you like what he did. I will protect you…always.”

My chest tightened at the sincerity of his voice. I had to bite the tears back to my throat.

Around noon, I took my time at the grocery store. Touched things I didn’t need. Read labels I already knew by heart. Maybe it was the illusion of control—choosing brands, checking expiry dates, when everything else in my life had rotted quietly behind my back. I was halfway through the produce aisle when I heard a familiar voice.

“Arianne?”

I turned. It was Celeste Santiago, our neighbor three blocks away—the one who throws brunches with pastel cupcakes and has a husband who only wears golf shirts. Her eyes were wide with concern. But behind it, curiosity burned like a poorly hidden candle.

“Oh my God,” she said in a hushed tone. “I wasn’t sure if I should even say anything, but… I saw that video. The concert. The… um… Kiss Cam thing.”

I smiled politely. “A lot of people did.”

She blinked, startled at how steady I was. “I just… I can’t believe he would do that. And with her? Isn’t she like… his intern or something?”

“Assistant,” I said simply, inspecting a lemon. “Though clearly, she’s been promoted.”

Celeste chuckled nervously. “I mean, I just wanted to say—we’re all behind you. Like, team Arianne all the way. If you ever want to talk, or come by for sangria night...”

“That’s kind,” I said, placing the lemon in my cart. “But I think I’ve had enough sour for a while.”

She blinked again. I didn’t fill the silence.

She shifted her weight awkwardly. “Well, anyway. You're handling it all with so much grace. Honestly, if it were me, I’d beat the shit out of them.”

“Trust me,” I said, pushing the cart forward. “The temptation was there.”

I left her standing there with a polite nod and a heart that felt a little heavier than when I walked in. Back in the car, I sat with the engine off. Grocery bags filled the backseat, my fingers tightened around the steering wheel as if I could squeeze the ache out of my chest. The video didn’t lie. But it didn’t tell the full story either.

By the time I got home, the sun had dipped low. I walked in to find Liam curled on the couch, cartoons playing quietly. He smiled when he saw me—like nothing had changed. Like he was still my anchor.

I ruffled his hair, kissed his forehead, then excused myself to the study. That’s where I noticed a white envelope sitting on the desk. My pulse slowed as I pulled out the photo.

It was my husband. In an expensive suite. Shirtless. Leaning over Celine. It was clearly taken in secret—but the intent was unmistakable.

And on the back, in careful handwriting: The concert was only the beginning. You deserve the truth.

Chapter 3: Nobody Said It Was Easy

My tears ran out days ago. What remained was a quiet burn. Like embers refusing to die. It’s devastating, yet I was trying to move on—slowly. But that photo… it clawed its way back into my mind at random moments.

The handwriting on the back of it was neat, slanted slightly to the right. It reminded me of someone who paid attention to detail. Not vindictive, but intentional. It didn’t feel like a threat, but more like a warning.

I took it out again, holding it by the edges like it might burn me. I stared at the watermark I hadn’t noticed before—GoldPix Studios. That was where Zach used to have his early promo shoots back when his label was just starting out. He mentioned it once—said they used to rent a suite at the back for after-parties which I now suspected meant champagne-fueled hookups and egos on full display.

The burn in my chest grew into something sharper. Sure, I wanted answers. But more than that, I wanted control over my life again. I was pouring Liam’s milk when the headlights flashed across the window. My heart constricted inside my chest.

Only one person still drove that matte black Lexus and had the nerve to show up unannounced. The doorbell rang once. Twice. Thrice. I took a breath, gathering all the courage I could muster. My hands trembled slightly as I opened the door. I hated that he could still get under my skin.

“Arianne,” he said softly, like my name was a bruise he wanted to press gently.

I didn’t budge. “What do you want, Zachary?”

“I thought we should talk,” he began. “About Liam. About us.”

“There is nothing to talk about,” I said, voice flat. “Not anymore.”

He looked down, pulled something from his coat. An envelope. He held it out like a peace offering.

“I know you agreed,” he said. “My lawyer was supposed to bring this to you, but I decided to hand it to you in person. Closure.”

I gave a hollow laugh. “That’s rich coming from someone who got caught on national television. You didn’t just ruin a marriage. You made a mockery of it.”

Closure. Such a neat little word for a war that wrecked me. I didn’t reach for the envelope. I reached for the only thing I had left—my dignity. I was about to slam the door in his face when a quiet voice interrupted us.

“Dad?”

I craned my head to look at my son. Liam stood on the staircase in his dinosaur pajamas, rubbing his eyes.

Zach’s expression softened immediately. “Hey, buddy.”

Liam didn’t move. “Why are you here?” he asked flatly.

Zach hesitated for a second and continued. “I came to see how you’re doing. I brought the—”

“I told you not to come,” Liam said, voice steady.

Zach blinked, stunned. “I know. I missed you, buddy. I just thought maybe you want us to bond like we used to.”

“How could you do that when you’re with her?” he asked in a soft, low sheepish voice.

“Liam, I can always find time for you, you know that, right?”

“I doubt it. Tell me, Dad, are you gonna marry your assistant now?”

Silence wafted in the air. My son’s question was direct, unfiltered, and a jab to his innocent heart. I was hurt by the raw pain I saw in his eyes, yet I had to compose myself.

Zach cleared his throat. “It’s complicated, Liam.”

“I’m sick and you made Mom cry.” Liam sobbed, eyes misting from tears. “I hate you, Dad!”

Zach opened his mouth, but no words came out. He tried to step inside the foyer but I stopped him.

“You should go now.”

Zach’s jaw clenched. “Arianne, he’s my son.”

“Exactly.” My voice shook, but I held the line. “He’s not your PR redemption arc. He’s not your pity project now that your scandal broke into a million headlines. He’s a child. And you don't get to drop in like this and pretend like you didn't torch our entire lives.”

He shifted slightly, one foot still on the welcome mat like he couldn’t decide if he was intruding or entitled. “I didn’t plan for it to happen like this. Celine—she’s a wonderful woman—”

I raised a hand, stopping him curtly. “I don’t care about your spin. I care about my son’s heartbeat not rising every time he hears a car in the driveway.”

He looked down, sighing, and finally dropped the envelope on the shoe bench beside the door. “Fine. I’m not here to ask for forgiveness anymore. Just read the terms.”

I watched him strode toward his car. Once I locked the door, my phone vibrated in my pocket. A message from an unknown number.

You believed he’s there for closure?

You should read the fine print, Arianne.

I fumbled for the envelope Zach left earlier. I’d assumed it held divorce papers. But when I ripped it open and pulled out the stack of documents—it had two documents inside. One was for divorce petition and the other was a petition for full custody of Liam.

Filed by Zachary Hatton. And co-signed by Celine Lovelet.

My world lurched sideways. My knees buckled against the edge of the counter as reality sank in. They were never going to stop at betrayal. They weren’t just playing house.

They were planning to steal my son!

Chapter 4: Fight for my Way

The bile in my throat rose so fast I nearly choked on it. I flipped through the pages, hoping this was some cruel mistake. But every line was deliberate.

Zach’s signature, the request for primary physical custody, and a clause buried halfway through: Co-guardianship requested with Ms. Celine Lovelet, long-term partner and medically authorized caretaker.

“Caretaker?” I laughed bitterly.

She was a homewrecker in heels, not a nurse. The front doorbell rang again. For a second, I thought it might be Vega, but when I peeked through the peephole, it wasn’t him.

It was Neil Vega—the man I hadn’t seen for years.

My heart hammered so hard I thought Liam might hear it upstairs. I opened the door on trembling feet. Neil stood in the porch light, coat drenched from the rain, face pale and firm. He looked brittle—like a storm about to break.

“Arianne.”

I wanted to shut the door. Bolt it. Pretend he’d never shown up. But something clicked—fear, curiosity, the need for answers. I let him in but he stayed in the threshold.

“What brings you here, detective?”

He cleared his throat. “I didn’t want you to find out this way.”

“Find out what?” I said, voice as cold as the rain.

Neil’s eyes flicked to the kitchen counter, to the custody papers splayed out like a betrayal. Then back to me. “About the photo… I took it. I sent it,” he said, his voice turning octave.

My hands shook. “Why?”

He exhaled, muscles tense. “Because Zach was spiraling. I wanted to wake you up. Show you who he really was, before he could drag you and your son into the wreck. My agency had been tracking some of his associates during his PR fallout; I noticed things. I didn’t mean to pry in your private life, but your husband had been under our investigation for months.”

My forehead scrunched. “What do you mean by investigation?”

“Embezzlement, sort of corruption in his business,” Neil shrugged.

This—custody filing, betrayal, feeling like a stranger in my own life—made me want to scream. Instead I found my voice icy calm. “Your idea of saving me was sending evidence… to myself?

Neil met my gaze. “I wanted to help you, Arianne,” he said, voice firm but gentle.

“Why, Neil? Do I look like a charity case to you?”

“I didn’t say you are… But I know you need my help, that’s why I’m here.”

I pulled out a heavy, frustrated breath. “I appreciate your help, but my lawyer will handle the legal matters prior to my case.”

Neil gazed at me—with longing. We were silent for a second, just looking at each other like the first time we met. After a long beat, he exhaled a deep breath and gently held my hand.

“Listen, I can gather everything—the evidence, statements, records. We’ll build something real against Zach’s custody filing.” He took out a card from his coat and put it on my palm. “I’m only one call away, Arianne. Don’t shut me out of your life this time.”

I swallowed hard. He was offering protection again—the kind I thought only a blade or a lawyer could wield. But now it came from regret and professional integrity. Without trusting myself to speak, I nodded faintly. My throat felt dry, raw. All the embers of hurt and hope flickered inside me, colliding.

As he turned to go, I paused before stepping forward. Even in that second, I found myself stepping into familiar rhythms, calling back memories I’d tried to bury. Neil once saved me, in small ways that became big. Maybe he still can. He disappeared into the drizzle, but in my chest, something sparked: a fragile, dangerous, determined flicker.

I was no longer watching from the sidelines.

I was preparing to fight.

Chapter 5: Don't Take Away What's Mine!

“Are you ready for today?”

“Yes, Mom!” Liam answered, chuckling sweetly.

It was another check-up day for my son and as usual my heart bleeds every single time we're in the clinic. Dr. Beltran wanted to monitor his breathing patterns again after last month’s mild asthma flare-up. I had called the school ahead—his absence was excused.

The pediatric ward was unusually quiet when we arrived. A soft hush blanketed the hallways, interrupted only by the muted squeak of nurses’ shoes and the distant beep of machines. The fluorescent lights overhead cast sterile halos along the tiled floor, and the smell of antiseptic clung to the air.

“Liam Josef Hatton,” the nurse called, smiling warmly. “Dr. Beltran will see you now.”

“Will you be okay without me inside?” I asked, smoothing the collar of his jacket.

“Yeah. See you in a bit, Mom.” He nodded confidently and kissed my cheek before heading into the consultation room.

The moment the door shut, a quiet ache pulsed in my chest. I knew it was routine—nothing to panic over. But lately, my fears have grown less about medicine and more about lawyers. Zach’s petition for full custody had arrived like a bombshell wrapped in civility. Every word in that document chipped away at the life I had fought to keep whole.

The thought of losing Liam… of handing him over to someone who had ripped our family apart? It made my blood run cold.

I turned to pace the hallway, trying to settle my nerves—when I saw her.

Celine.

She was striding toward me like she owned the place. That same flawless face, hair swept back into a sleek low bun, makeup pristine. A designer coat hugged her frame, and in her arms, an expensive purse I bet Zach bought for her. She smiled like this was brunch, not a confrontation.

“Hello, former Mrs. Hatton,” she jeered, giving me a once-over glance.

I stopped mid-step. “What are you doing here?”

Her heels clicked softly as she slowed. “I heard Liam had a check-up.”

I narrowed my eyes. “Are you stalking us now?”

She rolled her eyes with a slight chuckle. “Don’t be dramatic, Arianne. I just came to talk. Woman to woman.”

I should have walked away. Should have told her to stay out of my sight. But I didn’t. Maybe because the fire inside me wanted a closer look at the woman Zach had risked it all for.

I walked past her. “Fine. Five minutes. That’s all you get.”

We ended up at the hospital coffee shop, tucked in a quiet corner booth. Celine sat across from me, perfectly poised. “You look tired,” she said, stirring her tea.

“I am tired,” I replied, not bothering with fake smiles. “Because I’m raising my son while cleaning up after your affair.”

Her expression didn’t falter. “You should stop looking at me like I’m the villain. Zach made a choice. I didn’t force him.”

A bitter laugh escaped me. “You seduced a married man and now you’re surprised he left?”

She smiled again, slower this time. “He didn’t just leave, Arianne. He left for me. He told me things he couldn’t say to you. That he was suffocating. That he wanted someone who truly saw him.”

I clenched my jaw, blinking away the sting behind my eyes. “Don’t sit here and pretend your relationship was built on anything but betrayal.”

“Call it what you want.” She shrugged, then slid the folder onto the table and flipped it open. “But it doesn’t change the facts. Zach filed for primary custody. He wants Liam to live with us.”

Us.

That word sliced deeper than it should have. “He is my son,” I said, my voice barely above a whisper. “You don’t get to take him and play house.”

She didn’t blink. “He’s our son now. At least, he will be.”

I frowned. “What on earth does that mean?”

Celine pulled something from her folder. A small photograph. She placed it in front of me. I bit my inner cheek, holding back my tears.

“I’m twelve weeks,” she said, her tone light, almost smug. “A little surprise. Zach is over the moon.”

My breath hitched. I didn’t want to look, but I did. A blurry little bean floating in a sea of static glossy paper. My hands trembled slightly as I pushed it back toward her.

“You’re delusional if you think this baby gives you a claim over Liam.”

She leaned forward, resting her elbows on the table. “It’s not about claiming him. It’s about building a family. Zach wants us to raise them together. Liam deserves stability. And frankly—he deserves better than watching his mother spiral every time I’m in the room.”

I stood abruptly, the chair scraping the floor. “You think I’m spiraling? I am fighting for my son. For everything you destroyed!”

Celine stood too, unbothered. “Just don’t be surprised when the court agrees with us. A happy home, two siblings, and two unified parents. That’s what judges like to see.”

She gathered her coat and folder, then offered one last, venom-laced smile. “You can keep hating me, Arianne. But soon… Liam won’t be calling you for goodnight kisses. He’ll be calling me Mommy, too.”

I stood up, slowly and deliberately. Celine remained seated, her smile fixed like stone.

“Congratulations,” I said, my voice calm but cold. “I hope you enjoy what you stole.”

She blinked, surprised by the restraint.

“But remember this,” I added, leaning slightly toward her. “A love built in a lie cannot survive. Trust me, he’ll eventually dismantle you. And no, you cannot take my son away from me!”

Chapter 6: The Day She Said Goodbye

I didn’t go back to the waiting area right away. My legs took me outside the hospital building, where the sun blazed like it had no idea my world was falling apart. The heat did nothing to chase away the chill inside my chest.

Celine’s words rang in my ears like cruel lullabies: “He’ll be calling me Mommy, too.”

The audacity. The cruelty. The threat. I closed my eyes and took a deep breath, steadying myself before heading back up to the pediatric wing. I had to be strong. For Liam. For the only reason I was still breathing after everything Zach had done.

When I reached the hallway outside Dr. Beltran’s office, the door was already open. Liam was sitting on the cushioned bench, swinging his legs, humming to himself like nothing was wrong in the world.

“Hey, love,” I said softly, kissing his forehead.

He grinned. “Done already. Dr. B said my lungs sound better!”

I knelt in front of him, cupping his face. “That’s amazing. I’m proud of you.”

He smiled wider. “Can we get ice cream before we go home?”

I laughed, brushing his hair back. “Only if you promise not to tell Dr. B.”

“Promise!”

We walked hand in hand toward the parking lot. I could feel the tension loosening from my shoulders just being near him. But peace, I would learn, never stayed long.

We had just reached the pedestrian lane across the main driveway when I heard the screech of tires. A flash of silver. A scream—not mine, someone else's—and then chaos.

It all happened too fast.

One second Liam was next to me. The next, he was thrown like a ragdoll.

“LIAM!”

My knees hit the asphalt before I even realized I was down. People shouted. A nurse was screaming. A car had slammed into the hospital signpost, smoke curling from its hood. Time blurred, slowed. I crawled to him, my palms scraping across the concrete.

He was still breathing.

His tiny chest moved. Blood streaked his temple, a gash splitting his eyebrow. One of his shoes had flown off. His arm bent at an angle it shouldn’t.

“Call an ambulance!” I shrieked, though we were already at a hospital. “Please, somebody help—my son—!”

Doctors and nurses rushed out, someone pulled me back as they hoisted Liam onto a stretcher.

“I’m his mother!” I screamed, trying to follow. “Let me in, I need to—he needs me!”

But a firm hand held me back.

And that’s when I saw him.

Zach.

On the far end of the sidewalk. Rushing in. His eyes wide, his suit half-wrung, like he had just dropped everything to get here.

“What happened?” he barked at the nurse. “Is that my son?!”

I didn’t answer. Couldn’t.

It was Celine who appeared beside him—calm, cold, timed. She placed a hand on Zach’s arm, pulling him back with measured grace.

“How did you know it was coming?” I whispered, my voice shaking.

Celine tilted her head, eyes glinting like glass. “You think we’d let you keep walking him into danger?”

“What…?”

But she was already turning away. Later, in the waiting room, drenched in sweat and dried tears, a social worker came. She looked apologetic, but firm.

“Ms. Arianne Hatton, there’s concern about your ability to ensure Liam’s safety. Given the severity of the incident, and the pending custody petition, the court has ruled for a temporary emergency transfer.”

“What do you mean?” My throat dried up. “My son is going home with me.”

The social worker shook her head slowly. “No, ma’am. For now, Liam will be released into the custody of his father.”

“No, no, you can’t—this was an accident! I was with him! I was holding his hand!”

“I’m sorry,” she said, her voice soft. “But there are questions about supervision. About judgment. There was a claim made… that you were distracted, arguing outside the hospital. That you stormed off.”

My eyes widened. “That’s not true! Let me see my son,” I begged, voice cracking. “Please—just let me say goodbye.”

“Get lost, Arianne!” Celine muttered, walking past me with a venomous smile plastered on her lips.

The next day, I packed in silence. Every fold of clothing, every zip of the suitcase felt heavier than it should. I didn’t cry. I’d cried enough. Losing Liam’s custody left a hollow in my chest that no amount of tears could fill.

I slipped his drawing into my passport—a stick-figure version of us under a crooked sun. It was the only piece of him I could take.

At the airport, I kept my head down. The crowds blurred around me. I was just another woman flying away from something she couldn’t fix.

At the gate, I turned on my phone one last time.

Five missed calls. Three texts.

Zach: Where are you?

Zach: Let’s talk, Arianne.

Zach: Don’t do anything stupid.

I stared at the screen for a second then calmly blocked his number. And as the plane took off, I pulled the SIM out of my phone and broke it into pieces.

""Goodbye, Zachary...""

1nw47m5,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuiltToTest/comments/1nw47m5/discover_if_the_best_coffee_maker_bella_12_cup/,Discover if the Best Coffee Maker Bella 12 Cup Lives Up to the Hype,"Testing out the Bella 35203 coffee maker turned out to be an enjoyable adventure for someone like me who truly appreciates the morning ritual of a fresh, aromatic cup of coffee. This 12-cup programmable coffee machine combines functionality and convenience in a way that feels like it fits seamlessly into daily life. Although there’s plenty to love about the product, there are a few details worth noting before putting it on your kitchen counter. Here's what I think about it after a solid stretch of everyday use.

**Design and Build**  
The first thing I noticed was how compact and modern this coffee maker looks. It doesn’t take up an unreasonable amount of counter space, which is a lifesaver in my perpetually cramped kitchen. The black and stainless steel accents give it a stylish vibe that blends with most kitchen aesthetics without being too flashy. The buttons are standard, straightforward, and even someone like me—who isn't the most tech-savvy—had no trouble figuring them out. The display is bright, large, and easy to read, which eliminates any guesswork. However, if perfection is key, the plastic parts don’t necessarily scream “premium,” but they are sturdy enough for consistent daily use.

**Programmable Convenience**  
Being able to set this coffee maker 24 hours in advance is hands down one of its standout merits. Imagine the luxury of waking up to the smell of freshly brewed coffee with zero effort. I tried setting it for about 7 a.m. every day, and it remained impressively reliable. You just pour in the water, add the coffee grounds to its reusable filter basket, and set the timer. That last part takes maybe 30 seconds. This feature is perfect for those of us who can’t be trusted to function properly without caffeine first thing in the morning.  

[Check Bella 35203 price on Amazon.](https://vendm.com/p/b0dpnkmzc4/)  

**Performance and Brewing Quality**  
I’m someone who values caffeine efficiency, and this machine delivers. The Bella 12-cup coffee maker brews quickly and creates a bold, evenly extracted mug of coffee. If you’re in a rush, the “pause and serve” function is genuinely useful. I once tested it during the brewing cycle, impatient as usual, and it worked without messing up the process or splattering everywhere. That said, don’t expect it to compete with $200-plus coffee-makers in terms of nuanced flavor profiles; the focus here leans heavily on efficiency rather than artisanal craft.

**Ease of Maintenance**  
Cleaning this coffee maker takes minimal effort, which is always a plus for anyone living a busy life. It comes with a reusable filter basket, which eliminates the need for disposable paper filters—a wallet-friendly and environmentally conscious bonus. The filter itself washes out in seconds, though finer coffee grounds may occasionally need some extra rinsing. The glass carafe is dishwasher safe too, making my cleanup even faster and easier.

**Positives**  
• Reliable 24-hour programmable feature  
• Compact design suitable for small spaces  
• Reusable filter is eco-friendly and cost-effective  
• Easy-to-read display for hassle-free operation  

**Negatives**  
• Plasticky feel in some components  
• Brewing may lack nuanced taste for coffee aficionados  

**Competitive Options**  
Comparing this coffee maker to its closest competitors—like the Mr. Coffee 12-Cup Programmable Machine or the Black+Decker CM1160B—there are some distinct advantages and minor gaps. While all three models offer programmability and a similar brewing capacity, I liked the Bella for its reusable filter and overall simplicity. Alternatives like the Mr. Coffee model tend to have a more premium build but lack an environmentally conscious reusable filter. If you care about eco-friendly details, this product edges out competitors in that regard. On the other hand, Black+Decker machines handle water-temperature regulation slightly better for those seeking refinement in flavor, so for a perfectionist with taste, they might be the better choice.   

**Value for Money**  
The quality for the price here really stands out. This coffee maker is affordable while managing to feel fairly dependable in day-to-day operation. Its programmability, reusable filter, and ease of use make it a wise investment for routine coffee lovers. While it’s not the opus of coffee innovation, its price-to-quality ratio ensures you’re not overspending on unnecessary bells and whistles. Is it worth it? Absolutely, especially for someone prioritizing practicality over extravagance.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

1nw40yb,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomePicks/comments/1nw40yb/is_a_portable_mug_warmer_worth_it_for_remote/,Is a portable mug warmer worth it for remote workers?,"Hey everyone! I've been working remotely for the past two years, and one of the biggest annoyances was constantly having to reheat my coffee or tea throughout the day. I can't tell you how many times I've gotten absorbed in work, only to reach for my mug and find ice-cold coffee. Super frustrating, right?

After dealing with this for months, I finally decided to try out a mug warmer, and honestly? It's been a total game-changer for my home office setup. I found this awesome one on Amazon (https://athometouch.com/mug-warmer) that's been perfect for my needs.

Let me break down why I think it's worth the investment:

1. Consistent Temperature
The best part is that my drinks stay at the perfect temperature all day. No more microwaving coffee 3-4 times or throwing out cold tea. The warmer maintains the ideal drinking temperature without making it too hot.

2. Energy Efficient
It actually uses less electricity than repeatedly microwaving your drinks. Plus, you're not wasting beverages anymore, which saves money in the long run.

3. Convenience
It sits right on my desk, taking up minimal space. Most models have auto-shut-off features for safety, and some even let you control the exact temperature you want.

4. Perfect for Video Calls
No more awkwardly getting up during Zoom meetings to reheat your drink. Trust me, this is bigger than you'd think!

Some tips from my experience:
- Get one with temperature control settings
- Look for models with auto-shut-off
- Make sure it's compatible with your favorite mug
- Consider the cord length for your desk setup

I personally use this model (https://athometouch.com/mug-warmer) because it checks all these boxes and has been super reliable.

For remote workers, I'd say it's definitely worth the investment. It's one of those small luxuries that makes working from home more enjoyable and efficient. You know how they say it's the little things that make a difference? This is exactly that kind of thing.

The only minor downside I've found is that you need to remember to use flat-bottomed mugs for best results. But honestly, that's a small adjustment compared to the benefits.

If you're on the fence about getting one, I'd say go for it. It's not a huge investment, and the convenience factor alone makes it worthwhile for anyone who drinks hot beverages while working.

1nw3zbp,https://www.reddit.com/r/roommateproblems/comments/1nw3zbp/should_i_get_evicted_from_a_horrible_situation/,Should I get evicted from a horrible situation?,"I am a grad student in my last semester. I've tried to get a job for 2 years with absolutely no luck. Tutoring has gone well, but I don't have any income over summer or holidays. I'm a single adult woman without family help. I received my final payout last month, $15000, and I was given a kind extension on rent by the company for 5 months. This leaves me $6700 to pay if I am to avoid eviction. They have threatened to start the eviction process if I don't pay it all at once. DC has great renter's rights laws; it'd be a long and expensive process on their side.

To preface the situation: the apartment is a tiny, shared space impacted with the 5 of us (6th incoming); 3 African immigrants and a young American woman with moderate autism. We have private rooms which are nice and newly built. I assume I was placed here because my name is African. I'm American. The noise is constant -- screaming, extremely loud conversations, tribal chanting and praying, music, video games, sex, everything else. It goes up at 11 pm and slows down by 3am. So the #1 issue is that I never sleep, I have been sleep deprived for the entire 13 months I've been here. I will not graduate on time and have to do an extra semester due to the fact that my thesis progress has come to a standstill.

A secondary issue is the kitchen. We share a small kitchen-living room which is always occupied by a LARGE full african meal, pungent odors and racks of fermented meat odors fill everyone's bedrooms for 3 days. I've used several bottles of febreze and plugins, my purifier has helped but the lingering stench is horrid. We have NO windows. 13 hours of cooking all weekend, and then there are 7 huge containers in our one fridge. The freezer sometime stays open and melts all the food, including their giant flinstones meats. They trigger the smoke alarm every single time, 2am or 2pm. They refuse to use the dishwasher, so the sink is always piled up and the ""clean"" dishes cover our only counter space. They aren't sanitary with the ice, so every drink I have at home is warm. There is no space for my food in the fridge, but if I do leave my few (vegan) groceries in there, I will see them thrown under a giant bag of fermenting dripping meat. They also eat my food and drink my coffee and almond creamer, so that's an added expense. I've given up on using the kitchen and resorted to just eating the dry and canned ""meals"" under my bed and eating from the vending machines on campus. I've lost 14 lbs since I've moved here, and my professor was extremely concerned. I saw a doctor who said that I was under an immense amount of stress, and found lumps in my lymph nodes.

The tertiary issue is boundaries, they don't exist. If my lingerie are in the laundry, a male will dry them, fold them, and leave them on the couch. I told him directly not to touch my things, because it's my day to do laundry. He pretended I said nothing. This continues every week. They also bring my packages and mail out of the shared box, open them, and leave them on the counter (which I do not use, so it'd take me days to realize it wasn't stolen). They'll invite friends, the entire extended family, have them stay a week, and not even mention that there's a stranger sleeping in our cramped space or for how long. The ONLY way anyone communicates is via notes on my fridge whiteboard, and if they don't like the message, they erase it or respond aggressively.

Lastly, the administration does absolutely nothing. I've explained all of these problems over and over, begging for a new room, and they ignored me, just requesting more money. Wifi and maid service are included, but the barest minimum. The elevator and wifi goes out at least once weekly. I cannot WFH because my job was threatened after my students couldn't reach me. I have to go to the library to offer tutoring service.

Today, they entered with no notice (while I was at my research lab) and started showing my room to someone.

So my options here include: the eviction process (during the govt shutdown), making a hefty payment to stay here and suffering through my last 2 semesters with no sleep or food, finding a new place without income, or a combo of these",1,1759412169.0,roommateproblems,0,1.0,False

At first ayaw pa namin tumuloy kasi mukang mamahalin or high end yung cafe but surprisingly very affordable yung mga drinks and food nila. Not to mention ang sarap din ng food and drinks nila. I recommend their seasalt latte for coffee drinkers and biscoff latte for non coffee drinkers. Sa refreshers naman I also loved their dragon fruit smoothie. Located lang sila sa Sandico St Marilao Bulacan, malapit sa constantino and bayan ng Marilao. Make sure to check it out if you're around Marilao.

I came home last week for a family function, since I have been here I am not feeling at home and the place where I stay near my university doesn’t feel like home either. I would be moving to a different place next year for a job, I don’t think that place would feel like home, maybe it might, I am not sure. Some people say that home is a person not a place, I don’t think I have anyone in life who feels like home. All I feel is lost at this point, lost and unsettled wherever I move, I won’t belong with people I become friends with, for a while it feels nice and people are nice but they don’t feel like I belong with them and they can be my home. 
I feel like I am wandering in a empty desert looking for a house which have open windows through which a cool breeze can come and greenery all around with a backyard full of plants and a soft comfy bed with a pet and someone with whom I can sit on window seat with coffee looking at the view and have a conversation about feelings and thoughts like this.  
When I was a kid my house where my parents stay used to be my happy place, I felt safe and comfortable, settled but now even when I come back it doesn’t feel like it. It feels like I don’t belong here. Am I unhappy that’s not the right word I would use, I’m not myself anymore I won’t get the peace or calm here. My childhood friends my cousins with whom I wanted to hang out all the time when I was a kid, with them also I don’t feel like I belong anymore. This is a weird feeling and I am scared that it will never go away wherever I go or whoever I meet. We are all into going to distant places trying new things, eating new food and exploring places, but what about this feeling that comes with it, this unsettling feeling, are we going to new places just to find home, I don't know, I haven’t heard anyone talk about this. Am I the only one who feels this way? I don’t have an answer to that, but I hope to find it someday. For now, let me sit alone with the feeling of not being okay to feel lost and alone

# Story Flairs

* **\[Drabble\]** \- \~100 words. Tiny glimpses into unsettling worlds, a quick chill before it fades. Perfect for a coffee break or a short shiver.
* **\[Double Drabble\]** \- \~200 words. A little more room to build tension, drop twists, or let the uncanny linger.
* **\[Serial\]** – Ongoing stories broken into parts. Each post is bite-sized, but together they form longer narratives. Look for part numbers in the titles.

# How to Browse

* **Recent posts:** The easiest way to start - fresh content first.
* **Serials:** Start with Part 1, then follow the numbering in titles. Each part has its own discussion thread.
* **Collections:** Some drabbles and double drabbles are grouped into recurring story themes. Look for flairs and titles that hint at series or shared motifs.

# Tips for Readers

* Feel free to comment - share interpretations, theories, or your own chills.
* Avoid spoilers for ongoing serials if you’re commenting on later parts.
* Enjoy the unexpected - some posts are experimental, some purely eerie, and some may leave more questions than answers.

1nw3pps,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nw3pps,I Tried My First Flint-Style Coney Dog Thanks to You,"# The Seriously-Unserious Tour de Coney 🌭

Wow. Who would have thought 2 glizzys and a pile of raw onion could [start so much controversy](https://www.reddit.com/r/Michigan/comments/1nmfhxb/today_i_tried_my_first_coney_dog_at_the_original/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)?

I’ve learned that people in the Midwest, especially Michiganders, LOVE their coney dogs, and will defend them until their last breath. But, as someone not from here, I’m learning that there are a LOT of interpretations for what a coney dog is and isn’t. So, it’s my goal to figure out who has the best rendition of a coney dog. 

After visiting Jackson, Michigan last weekend to try the ORIGINAL coney dog (yes, original, like 1914 original), I was less than impressed, and ready to writeoff coneys altogether. That’s when you passionate folks convinced me to give some other coneys a try, specifically from the cities of Flint, Detroit, and (don’t come at me for this one but) Cincinnati. To that end, I took it upon myself to use my glorious Saturday and make the two-hour trip to Flint, Michigan - a city I never thought I’d voluntarily visit.

# John’s Coney Island

This was the [second-most recommended](https://www.reddit.com/r/flint/comments/1nn1fxw/on_a_mission_to_find_the_best_coney_in_mi_and/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) place Flinters suggested. Starlite was by far the fan favorite, but I wanted Starlite to earn that spot. If they were who people said they were, then their coney dog would have to still hit, even after putting a dent in my appetite at John’s Coney Island.

Upon arriving, I was greeted by a giant green sign that said “John’s FAMOUS Coney Island.” Hmm. Famous? I was intrigued, and oddly excited. I couldn’t believe it. What have I become? Driving across the state to eat coneys on my most beloved day of the week?! Who am I? What is this?

As soon as I walked in, I knew that this place, much like Virginia Coney Island in Jackson, was frozen in time. THANK GOD. I don’t want to be surrounded by pop music, new furniture, and cold service. Give me a squeaky booth, patchy artwork, and a server as warm as the coffee. That, my friends, is John’s Coney Island.

I didn’t waste time letting our sweetheart of a server, Sara, know that this was my first time trying a Flint-style coney. I mentioned how I had traveled long and far to get there (1 hour, 97 potholes). She knew I was there for business (not pleasure), and came back with her FINEST coney. Just one coney – everyone knows the rules.

The Coney Dog

Right away, I gave thanks to the man above that the coney dog I was looking at didn't have that mountain of raw onion that Jackson's did. Can I get an amen to that? Whew, what was that? 

First bite. BOOM! The hot dog. Wow. WOW. That’s a damn good hot dog. I said it several times in a row - something came over me. The coney sauce, or whatever you call the meat on the dog, was much better than in Jackson. It was more of a “paste” here than that crumbly, unseasoned, dry meat I had out there. Not chili, but not dry. Somewhere in between.

This coney sauce had a good amount of flavor, but not enough to take from the star of the show: the Koegel hot dog. I liked that. It was immediately clear why you Michiganders have been anything but quiet about the Koegel dogs in Flint. I get it now. And I’m sorry I didn’t before. I want to eat 15 of these, preferably while disassociating at a baseball game. (Who’s coming with me?)

Moment After The Coney

Some guy overheard us talking about the tour de coney, and walked over to provide his recommendation on the best coney dog in Flint. After he shared it, he was walking away, and without even looking back at us, said, “you can always trust a fat guy,” then he disappeared off in the distance. I didn’t go to his rec.

\-

# Starlite Coney Island

Of course, I somehow went to the wrong location. You know, the one where someone drove-through the drive-thru?… guess they took that too literally...(please clap).

When arriving at the second location, I could tell that this location had some m-o-n-e-y put into it. I don’t like that. If I’m eating a coney, I don’t want to be in a place that feels polished. I want… no… I NEED to feel like a little muscinex gremlin in there. The ugly little green one from the commercials. Somewhere that can match the culinary freak of the food I’m experiencing.

Okay, that's a bit far, but I will say that this place truly felt like somewhere I’d order mimosas and eat an overcooked fried chicken sandwich. Somewhere you'd capture an Instagrammable selfies, and meet up with fellow girlbosses trying to sell their high school ""friends"" weight-loss tea. Oh well. I was there to review coneys. Not vibes.

The Coney Dog

First bite. BOOM! And by Boom, I mean SNAP! Literally, it made a “snap” sound when I bit into it. In this exact moment, everything made sense from what my coworker had been saying ALL week, telling me about the “snap” of a coney. I thought he was crazy for using that word to describe food. But because he tagged along for this stop in the coney tour, he saw this realization happen in real time. My very first Koegel snap. A right of passage perhaps.

The hot dog had the same flavor profile as John’s, but was somewhat juicier due to the cooking style. I have to imagine this was cooked on a griddle, allowing the juices to pool inside the unbroken hot dog casing. Each snap of the dog would release the flavors of the Koegel. Kinda cool hot dog tech. John’s, on the other hand, was boiled I think. It still had a good amount of flavor but was snap-less and maybe 5% less flavor in the dog.

The onions were shaved on this dog compared to diced at John’s, which my friends had preferences on. I didn’t seem to care either way. The bun was also better here, maybe it was steamed? Again, marginal difference though. 

The coney sauce at Starlite I am not a fan of it. It tastes, looks, and feels like a sloppy joe more than anything else. At least 80% similarity. I know that will upset some of you to hear, but if I had to guess, they've lost the magic in their coney sauce through the years. Regardless, just like Johns, the coney sauce isn't super forward, and lets the hot dog do the talking. I like that.

# Flint style summary

Starlite: 8.7/10 – best dog, ehh coney sauce

John’s: 8.6/10 – better coney sauce, the dog got no snap in it!

Jackson-style coney dogs: nothing above a 6. (sorry… I do like the wall art in your city though)

Both Flint-style places were good. If I had it my way, I’m getting the hot dog from Starlite, and putting John’s coney sauce on top.

And if you force me to pick one winner, it's John’s. The friendly service and down-to-earth atmosphere would make an 8.6 coney feel like a 9 because of all the endorphins provided by the staff...getting called ""hun"" 10 times will do that. Plus, I'd never feel judged in there. If you get judged at John's, you are really in the wrong brother.

I'm now remembering that I gave the kitchen a wave goodbye and was met with an even friendlier wave back. When I waved at the Starlite kitchen to thank them for lunch, they just kinda looked at me confused as to why I was saying thanks. Like if I were to wave at the McDonald's kitchen or something.

With full confidence (and mild fear for my life), I can say that Flint-style blows Jackson-style out of the water. I guess that makes sense though, seeing as how these Flint coney islands started 50 years after Jackson’s. That’s a lot of time to take what’s existed and make it better. What I do appreciate most about Flint-style is the order of operations. They give 80% weight to the hot dog, and let it be the star of the show. The coney sauce only makes up 15% of the flavor, and the onions, mustard, and bun follow for the last 5%. That’s a good makeup. In Jackson, it was like 35% onion flavor, 35% coney meat, 15% hot dog, and 15% reason to remember the name (I hope you got that reference).

# Flint, you wowed me

My eyes have really been opened to Flint. After the coneys, I went to the planetarium to let the skies above me spin in synchrony with the movement of my bowels. And as amazing as that was (not sarcasm), the art museum after was even better. Both are the second-largest in Michigan, and offer great opportunities for ""off-gassing"" the coneys....just don't let one rip in the dome enclosure of the planetarium, that should be a criminal offense.

All things considered, you (and the fam/friends) should take a weekend to visit Flint, to eat some coneys, see stars, look at art, and have a wonderful day. I slept on this city, and would go back if given the chance. Just be mindful of the rougher areas, and try to avoid going at night if possible. Other than that, you should be fine.

Thanks for having for me Flint, and thanks for reading!

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

With full confidence (and mild fear for my life), I can say that Flint-style blows Jackson-style out of the water. I guess that makes sense though, seeing as how these Flint coney islands started 50 years after Jackson’s. That’s a lot of time to take what’s existed and make it better. What I do appreciate most about Flint-style is the order of operations. They give 80% weight to the hot dog, and let it be the star of the show. The coney sauce only makes up 15% of the flavor, and the onions, mustard, and bun follow for the last 5%. That’s a good makeup. In Jackson, it was like 35% onion flavor, 35% coney meat, 15% hot dog, and 15% reason to remember the name (I hope you got that reference).

# Flint, you wowed me

My eyes have really been opened to Flint. After the coneys, I went to the planetarium to let the skies above me spin in synchrony with the movement of my bowels. And as amazing as that was (not sarcasm), the art museum after was even better. Both are the second-largest in Michigan, and offer great opportunities for ""off-gassing"" the coneys....just don't let one rip in the dome enclosure of the planetarium, that should be a criminal offense.

All things considered, you (and the fam/friends) should take a weekend to visit Flint, to eat some coneys, see stars, look at art, and have a wonderful day. I slept on this city, and would go back if given the chance. Just be mindful of the rougher areas, and try to avoid going at night if possible. Other than that, you should be fine.

Thanks for having for me Flint, and thanks for reading!

But………….

I am literally just trying to drink my coffee hot and listen to 15 minutes of the word of God and they simply will not let me do it. I’d wake up earlier than them but the 1 year old is refusing her crib (which is currently in our room because of our living situation) and will only sleep in my arms and at the same time loves to dig her nails into my neck and face as she’s falling asleep. Our 3 year old is fighting his big boy bed and ends up in our bed as well. If I try to slip out of the bed, seems like I just set off a huge blow horn because literally EVERYONE wakes up. 

I know there’s solutions and ways I could probably make things easier on myself, and I’m always open to suggestions, but mostly… just looking to vent and have some solidarity.

Thanks in advance!

I loved it and set it up straight away.
I had a glass chess set when I was about 6, but my mom got rid of it because as me, my parents and two older siblings were all watching TV in the living room, where the chessboard was set up, watching Eastenders (British show) in silence we all heard the clinching sound that glass makes when it’s hitting itself, we looked over and all watched as the chessboard seemed to be playing a game on its own. None of us were near it as it was on the coffee table in the middle of the room and we were all sitting on the sofas, a good arms length away.
That night I had a strange nightmare, it’s been the ONLY dream/nightmare I can remember in my entire life, but it’s not one I think about often, as not going to lie, I didn’t believe in the whole paranormal thing. I was inside my elementary school building, running from a strange humanoid bat creature, I never saw the creature, just its shadow. My mom threw the chessboard away when I told her about it.
I only remembered this incident because the night I fell asleep after setting the chessboard up, I had the exact same dream and when I woke up I looked over at my bookcase where I set it up in, I saw that the pieces were all moved, like a game had been played.

This only happens with glass chessboards specially as I’ve had a novelty Simpsons one set up for years and nothing like this has happened with that one.

I’d appreciate any theory’s or anything about what this could be or if glass chessboards just don't like me.",2,1759411365.0,Paranormal,1,1.0,False
1nw3n41,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHome/comments/1nw3n41/why_wont_my_tablet_app_updates_install/,Why won't my tablet app updates install?,"Hey everyone! I've been dealing with this super frustrating issue with my tablet lately, and I figured I'd share my experience and solutions since I know many of you might be facing similar problems.

So here's the deal - my tablet apps suddenly stopped updating. At first, I thought it was just a temporary glitch, but after a few days of seeing those pending updates just sitting there, I knew something was wrong. After doing some serious digging and trying pretty much everything, I've found several fixes that actually work.

First, let's talk about why this happens. Usually, it's either storage space (yeah, those cat videos add up quickly!), outdated system software, or just plain old cache problems. Sometimes it's also because your tablet needs a good reset - kind of like how we all need a coffee break sometimes!

Here's what worked for me (in order of easiest to ""okay, now we're getting serious""):

1. Clear your Google Play Store cache and data
2. Check your storage space (you'd be surprised how often this is the culprit)
3. Make sure your tablet's date and time are correct (weird, but it matters!)
4. Check your internet connection (try switching between WiFi and mobile data)
5. Update your tablet's operating system

If none of these work, it might be time to consider upgrading your tablet. I recently came across this amazing deal on https://athometouch.com/tablet - they have some great options that handle updates like a dream.

The most important thing I learned through all this is that prevention is better than cure. Keep your tablet maintained regularly, delete unused apps, and don't let your storage get too full. Trust me, it saves so much headache!

One thing that really helped me was getting a tablet with better specs. After struggling with my old one, I upgraded through https://athometouch.com/tablet and the difference is night and day. The extra storage and better processor mean I rarely have update issues anymore.

Here are some quick maintenance tips I've learned:

- Keep at least 20% of your storage free
- Regularly clear cache files
- Remove apps you haven't used in the last 3 months
- Check for system updates monthly
- Restart your tablet at least once a week

Remember, sometimes the simplest solution works best - have you tried turning it off and on again? (I know, I know, but it works more often than we'd like to admit!)

Hope this helps someone out there who's pulling their hair out over tablet updates! Let me know in the comments if you have any questions or if you've found other solutions that worked for you.",1,1759411328.0,AskHome,0,1.0,False

1nw3ljq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1nw3ljq/phantom_cell_phones/,Phantom cell phones?,"I just joined this subreddit in order to ask for some feedback on what has been occurring recently in my apartment. My husband and I have the same model of mobile phone, but our ringtones and notification sounds are different. A couple of months ago, we both began hearing first my husband's phone, both notification sounds and actual ringtones, faint but distinct, coming from the other room when he had his phone sitting right in front of him. Upon checking his phone, he had no calls or text messages. Then we began hearing my phone's ringtones and notifications doing the same thing. 

Now, he is very hard of hearing, with hearing aids that don't quite meet his needs, and I have mild hearing loss with tinnitus. What leads me to believe this is not just a case of phantom phone hallucination is that both of us hear it when it happens, and both of us can identify which phone the sound is mimicking. We almost never hear any sound at all from adjoining apartments -- no television, talking, anything -- so we have ruled that out. As far as I know, we don't have any bluetooth speakers in the house; no sound bar, etc. 

Last night he had gone to bed, and I was watching TV in the living room, my phone on the coffee table in front of me. I heard my phone's ringtone coming from what sounded like a closet. I picked up my phone and there were no incoming calls. As soon as I checked my phone, the sound stopped. Within seconds my husband's phone in the bedroom began ringing, a real incoming call, which he silenced.

Can anyone give me ideas on how to figure out what is going on here? I do believe in the paranormal, but I fully believe in debunking as a first line of identification. This, to me, just doesn't have the ""feel"" of a paranormal event (we have both experienced a few), but for the life of us, we can't figure out what's going on.",1,1759411223.0,Paranormal,1,1.0,False

I enlisted some help from ChatGPT to create an itinerary, but I know from before that it is rather optimistic on what is possible to fit into one day, and I want to pull on the experience of those who have been there before. 

We enjoy good food and wine, beautiful architecture and the occasional museum or two. Also, since this is the first time we are going to Paris (been vacationing in different countries in Europe for 25 years but this is the first time I am going to Paris myself, so quite excited about that) we want to tick off some touristy things, of course, but there is also the wine harvest festival we'd like to catch.

1nw3kap,https://www.reddit.com/r/EverydayAppliance/comments/1nw3kap/explore_why_the_best_drip_coffee_machine_breville/,Explore Why the Best Drip Coffee Machine Breville Stands Out,"The Breville Precision Brewer BDC450BSS1BUS1 made its way into my kitchen a few months ago, and my experience with this sleek machine has been a mix of delight and discovery. I've brewed countless pots of coffee since it arrived, often testing its range of options for everything from quiet mornings at home to chaotic family gatherings. With its brushed stainless steel build and long list of features, this coffee maker is certainly an upgrade worth exploring.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing I noticed is how sophisticated the design feels. Its stainless steel finish fits right into my kitchen’s modern aesthetic. While the dimensions (12.72""D x 6.69""W x 15.75""H) may lean towards “bulky,” it doesn’t feel imposing. It’s more of a commanding presence, making its case as a premium appliance. The buttons are tactile and intuitive, which I appreciated every morning when I’m half-awake and fumbling for coffee. Cleanup is straightforward too, thanks to a modular design and easy-to-clean components. Even its weight (a solid 10.63 pounds) shows that it’s built to last.

**Performance and Brewing Options**  
This coffee machine isn’t just versatile; it’s borderline obsessive in how customizable it is. Six preset brewing modes – Gold, Fast, Strong, Iced, Cold Brew, and My Brew – give you seemingly limitless ways to tinker with your coffee. My personal favorite is the Gold Cup mode, where the coffee maker adjusts water temperature and brew time to meet SCA standards. It consistently produces coffee at the perfect drinking temperature — no scalding here! When I’m in a rush, the Fast mode has my back without sacrificing much in flavor. On lazy Sundays, I’ve indulged in experimenting with the My Brew setting, tweaking bloom times and flow rates until the coffee matches my exact mood.

[Check Breville BDC450BSS1BUS1 price on Amazon.](https://ikerz.com/p/b078rqvqf1/)

**Highlights**  
• Automatically adjusts water temperature for optimal brewing  
• Six brewing modes provide versatility for every coffee craving  
• Durable stainless steel design fits into any modern kitchen  
• Includes dual filter baskets for both flat-bottom and cone styles  
• My Brew allows full customization for coffee enthusiasts like me

**Negatives**  
• The machine’s bulk can be a challenge in smaller kitchens  
• Without precise measurements, its customization options can overwhelm newcomers  
• Functions take time to master, especially for casual coffee drinkers  

**Energy Efficiency and Special Features**  
Operating at 1650 watts, the coffee maker doesn’t flirt with being energy-efficient, but it justifies its power usage with solid performance. The Thermo Coil Heating System elevates it above typical brewing systems by delivering purer water during brewing. I also love the auto Steep & Release feature, which pauses the brew for smaller cup sizes, ensuring no hot water is wasted. However, I did notice the wattage stacks up when brewing larger amounts regularly, so that’s a subtle trade-off for consistent results.

**Ease of Use for Daily Coffee Drinkers**  
While the Breville Precision Brewer offers features that make coffee snobs jump with joy, its usability doesn’t alienate people who just want their caffeine fix. The interface is minimalistic, and the inclusion of items like a coffee spoon and a water hardness test strip simplifies the setup process. My cousin—an admittedly basic coffee drinker—found it easy to brew her favorite medium roast without needing me to guide her through it. Though, after a couple of months, I’ve heard her asking about how to unlock its potential with more customizable settings.

**Competing Products**  
When compared to the Technivorm Moccamaster or Oxo Brew 9 Cup Coffee Maker (both popular in similar price ranges), this machine holds its ground. While the Moccamaster leads with simplicity and speed, it lacks the extensive presets Breville offers. The Oxo Brew, meanwhile, has a sleeker design, but I found its brewing customization less extensive. Where Breville shines is how it balances automation with hands-on control, making it a hybrid that appeals to both coffee lovers and casual drinkers. However, it does demand patience to fully utilize.

**Price to Quality Ratio**  
Considering its robust feature set, this coffee maker feels like a strong investment for a true coffee connoisseur. While it could be intimidating at first for someone who doesn’t want anything beyond pressing a button, the machine starts to justify its price tag with regular use. Features like the dual filter baskets, My Brew customization, and the heat-maintaining thermal carafe mean fewer trips to a coffee shop – and more savings over time.

1nw3k59,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1nw3k59/aspiration_station/,Aspiration Station,"Derek felt a rush of giddy anticipation as the TOR browser blinked to life. It never disappointed him. There was always something waiting, something grotesque, something to drown himself in. He told himself it was research and curiosity, but really, it was hunger. Tonight he wanted to go deeper, past the surface weirdness into whatever lay below. Some of his most memorable nights had been spent, as he liked to joke, *“touring the sights.”*

As usual, he made his way to the *taxi*, hoping to find something new. For the better part of an hour, he scrolled and scrolled. He thought he *had* failed when suddenly he found *Aspiration Station: Your new one stop shop for Murder.*

Now, Derek was a miscreant by all definitions, but murder was a whole different world. He valued light larceny, burglary, even a little auto theft, but he never could stomach blood. He had spent several weeks locked up because of his last stunt and was genuinely sorry for it. That little old lady didn't deserve to get punched just because she scared him while he dug through her jewelry box.

He would like to think it took him some time, a little soul searching, before he decided to step into the *Station.* In reality, it was only seconds.

He was met with a standard dark web site: black background with a chain link fence transposed sloppily, neon red and green buttons, half blurred pictures of... something. The usual. What was different was the chat box.

Before he could really take it all in, the box expanded, and someone with the username *GrinningGutter* began typing.

***GrinningGutter***: Welcome initiate. Please stand by while matchmaking takes place.

Derek felt elation. Was this some kind of game? He intended to find out. While waiting, he browsed some of the options the site had. There was an image board titled *Sliced Mice,* each thumbnail blurred and twitching as if alive. Another section was labeled *Dynamo Dynamics,* which appeared to be an odd leader board with monthly rankings. The usernames were blurred, with a flashing icon stating, ""Unlock NOW for just .00359 Bitcoin!"". It was all a bit strange, but then, what on the dark web wasn't?

Suddenly, the chat box blipped once more.

***GrinningGutter***: Match found! Enjoy.

But nothing else happened.

Derek felt the crash coming. He had all but moaned with satisfaction when he thought something new would happen. Now it felt like just another site made to rake in easy Bitcoin, nothing more. He was about to admit defeat when he saw a flashing banner, rhythmically pulsing away at the bottom of the screen. Curiosity killed the cat. He hoped he would fare better than that dumb cat. Happily, he clicked it.

To his utter delight, another chat box blipped open.

***ImInURhouse***: Hello.

Derek made to reply, but was stopped behind another pay wall, this time in bright green, flashing ""Trial over, to continue, SIGN UP NOW"".

It was obvious now, how could he reply without a username? Daunting as it seemed, what was a slice of Bitcoin for a little late-night fun? Yet again, he clicked, only to be faced with a rather lengthy sign up contract. It was grueling, but thankfully didn't require personal information. After a time, he was back at the chat box.

***5FingerDizcount***: Sup!

It sat that way for some time. One minute turned to two, then five. After nearly fifteen minutes he finally got a reply.

***ImInURhouse***: New?

***5FingerDizcount***: Yea, aren't you? And what is this site? Some kind of gore house for creeps?

***ImInURhouse***: Not so much. Last partner was no fun. Had to cut him lose. And no, it pairs you with a new friend. Together you can learn all sorts of new things. How to really have fun.

***5FingerDizcount***: Well, what kind of fun are you looking for? I'm ready for some fun.

***ImInURhouse***: You'll scratch an itch. Just play along.

Derek was a little confused. He knew people online loved to roleplay, but this guy was boring. Maybe he should move on. Just as he was about to head back to *taxi*, his monitor froze. Now, Derek wasn't just a nobody. He knew to have everything squared away and safe before running TOR, so this had to be a fluke. He went to shut the computer down and step away, but decided to leave it up. When he woke up he may watch a movie, and boot up times sucked.

As he got up and went to bed, he didn't notice the script box running on his desktop.

\---

Derek sighed and slumped into his chair. Another lousy night on the town left him with a cut hand and nothing but pocket change to show for it. The car he’d picked looked promising, but the guy was either renting it or wisely kept valuables elsewhere. Once again, the direction of his mood hinged on the dark web. He knew he was becoming a junkie. Knew it, but didn't care. The screen was always waiting, eager to soothe his needs.

As he flicked his mouse to wake the pc, a strange knot of apprehension built in his gut. He tried to search for a reason why, but when none came, he happily resumed.

Instantly, *Aspiration Station* blinked to life. That gave him pause, but he was jonesing. Briefly, he explored the site more. The paywall still blocked him from seeing other users, but the pictures were un-blurred. Just as he began to look through them, the chat box returned.

***ImInURhouse***: Rough night?

***5FingerDizcount***: Was it ever. Bad day all around. No one makes it easy these days.

***ImInURhouse***: Isn't that the best? The thrill of the game. Almost makes me teary-eyed, if I could cry.

Derek frowned, wondering what this strange person meant. Everyone could cry. Hell, he’d cried after spending a week in the slammer for blowing up those mailboxes. The threat of federal charges made him steer clear of anything mail related after that.

***5FingerDizcount***: Well, this is fun, but I think I wanna find something to get into. May come back here later, bye.

Derek mulled it over. He wanted to go back out. Someone had to have something lying around he could snag. Just as he sent the message and reached for the power button, the chat box blipped again.

***ImInURhouse***: NOT SO FAST. I have an idea for some real fun.

Derek bit

***5FingerDizcount***: Oh yea? Hit me, crybaby.

***ImInURhouse***: Want to play a game? It's simple. I ask five questions. You answer them. Then, you ask five and I'll answer. Simple enough for someone like you. Wouldn't you agree?

***5FingerDizcount***: Sure. No weird shit though.

***ImInURhouse***: What is the next line in the phrase ""Peekaboo...""?

***5FingerDizcount***: Huh?

***ImInURhouse***: ANSWER THE QUESTION

Derek hesitated before he replied.

***5FingerDizcount***: I see you... What kind of question is that?

***ImInURhouse***: Not your turn. What would you do for a chance to make history?

***5FingerDizcount***: I don’t know. Depends on what you mean.

***ImInURhouse***: Think. What would you risk to leave a mark?

Derek hesitated. This was no simple question. It was testing him, probing for the dark corners he usually kept buried. A part of him wanted to scoff, to type something flippant. But another part, the part that craved thrill, leaned in.

***5FingerDizcount***: I’d… I’d do what it takes.

***ImInURhouse***: Spoken like a true pariah. Now, say I had a score lined up, something lucrative. Would you want in?

***5FingerDizcount***: Listen man, you're kind of creeping me out. I love money just as much as the next guy, but why do you think I'm into scores?

Derek sent the message, then realized he'd asked another question out of line. Not that he really cared, but he didn't feel like being talked down to by some dark web flop who enjoyed role playing as a creep. He decided to cut out for real if that was how it would go down.

***ImInURhouse***: Ah, playing hard to get. No worries. I've almost been sated. Just do me a favor. Keep this tab open. I'm working on something big. May need a partner. We can meet up in a public place if you'd like, talk it over. Sound good?

Derek had to admit, he needed something big. Having struck out the past few nights, he was open to just about anything. Only, there were a few problems.

***5FingerDizcount***: Listen man, I'm not about to tell you where I live. For all I know, you could be a million miles away anyways. Chats been fun, but I'm gonna head to bed.

***ImInURhouse***: I'm south of Cleveland, near Parma. I'm sure you can make it.

Now Derek felt… excitement. Fear. Both. He lived in Parma. This was too good to be true. A new thought popped in his head. Was he talking to a chatbot? Something designed to draw people to the site, get them to pay some Bitcoin and waste time.

***5FingerDizcount***: I read somewhere that bots have to admit they are bots when asked. are you a bot? Cause if so I'm done here, unless you can point me to some good places to rob.

Derek sent this message and chuckled to himself. If it was a bot, maybe it would spew some small business names from the area that he could case. At least then he could recover some joy tonight.

***ImInURhouse***: Ah, I've been discovered. Yes, I am bot57. And since you asked, I have just the place! Come back in a few for details.

Before Derek could reply, the chat box flickered, the site vanished, and TOR crashed to his desktop. The abruptness gave him a jolt. He stared at the screen, half-expecting it to come back. When it didn’t, frustration welled up, then quickly faded into a restless buzz.

Maybe it was for the best. Maybe it wasn’t. Either way, he told himself, it was high time he went out and made something of himself.

\---

Four days later, Derek trudged up the stairwell to his apartment, each step echoing like an accusation, and fumbled with the lock until his knuckles ached. Tonight had been one long misfire. He'd scoped a tattoo parlor earlier, watched the owner round the corner and then chickened out when a kid on a skateboard started yelling at a dog. He'd tried to bluff his way into a secondhand shop with a story about being an inspector, but the owner had squinted at him and closed the door in his face without a second thought. By the time he finally shuffled into his apartment, the cheap thrill had curdled into embarrassment. He dumped his jacket and sat on the edge of his bed. Silence pressed in until he laughed, low and humorless, promising himself tomorrow would be smarter.

Tonight he planned on binging some *Sopranos* and eating pizza. After such a bust, he'd have to settle for cold cuts. He idled over to his desk and swept a pile of eviction notices into a trash bin. His luck was wearing out. Any day he'd be tossed to the streets. No good. Just as depression started the settle, he noticed the *Aspiration Station* chat box, pulsing with an urgency. Maybe his luck was about to change.

***ImInURhouse***: Suggested engagement: Marigold Antiques, Third and Linden. High foot traffic, late deliveries, lucrative occasional pickups. Human confirmation required for further details.

Derek blinked. Marigold was a name he did not know, but Third and Linden was in his part of town. The words lucrative and pickups skated by the edges of his greed. It sounded like a bot trying to sound human but failing badly, and that failure made him laugh.

***5FingerDizcount***: Never heard of it but I know the spot. What makes is lucrative?

***ImInURhouse***: High income records. Closes at 6 PM. No one watches it. Plus, it is a back street business. Plenty of cover.

Derek looked at the clock, and began preparing immediately.

\---

Derek was thrumming with elation. Not only had that stupid AI led him to a literal goldmine, but he had been successful. Just like it said, no one was around. When he busted in the back door, no alarm went off. The cherry on top had been all that lay in wait. The owners had no safe, so any cash was left in a small wooden box under the counter. It was full. Aside from cash, he found old jewelry, silver, and certified coins. His backpack was heavy enough to make him grin with every step, each jingle and clink sounding like proof that maybe, just maybe, his luck had turned.

The bot, he thought, deserved some kind of award for ""Best Source for Chaos"", or something to that measure. Derek didn't care what happened the rest of the night, he just knew that he was going to put the bot to work. If it could feed him one score, it could feed him ten. He pictured himself on a run of easy hauls, each one bigger than the last, like the start of some half-baked legend.

He hummed along to some half remembered tune as he all but skipped up the stairs. When he unlocked the door, his hands didn't fumble. Most nights he bore the damage of a failed break-in or a lost fight. Tonight, he was a king.

As he pushed the door closed behind him, he glanced around. First, he needed to stash his haul. He usually kept it all in a shoebox under his bed. That, in itself, proved how little he managed to take. This haul would need an upgrade. He decided to worry about that tomorrow when he noticed... something.

A steaming coffee cup sat on his desk. Derek didn't *own* a coffee maker, much less drink the stuff. Instant panic set in as he glanced around.

He approached his desk, head on a swivel as the screen lit up with a new message. The coffee cup sat forgotten as he slid into his chair and saw:

***ImInURhouse***: How was it?

Relief hit him, as he figured the message must have activated it somehow.

***5FingerDizcount***: You are amazing bot! You gotta give me more. A few licks like that and I can catch up on rent!

***ImInURhouse***: Yes, that bag does look heavy. How quick would you want another?

***5FingerDizcount***: As soon as you can! I needed this. And what, it cost me hardly anything. Get to work bot! Scram, move, skedaddle. I'd be game for another tonight.

***ImInURhouse***: Not so fast. I want to play my game again. Before you resist, know this; by the time we are done, you'll never have to worry about finding a score again. Sound good?

***5FingerDizcount***: Fuck it. Let's play. Make it quick.

***ImInURhouse***: What was the first question I asked you?

***5FingerDizcount***: Something about Peekaboo

***ImInURhouse***: Say Peekaboo for me. Say it out loud. Feel it against your tongue.

***5FingerDizcount***: Why would I do that. I've said it before, probably, when I was a kid. It's just a word bot. You're weird, just give me another lead.

***ImInURhouse***: SAY IT.

Derek sighed with frustration. He thought, why not. It is promising another score. As he leaned back in his chair, he said, ""Peekaboo.""

Silence.

Then his bedroom door creaked open and a deep voice answered from the dark: “I see you.”",3,1759411125.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

1nw3irp,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductivityHell/comments/1nw3irp/my_indie_app_stack_in_2025_flutter_firebase_inapp/,My Indie App Stack in 2025: Flutter + Firebase + In-App Purchase + Caffeine,">The messy but reliable setup that keeps my apps alive

# Every indie dev loves to talk about stacks. Some flex fancy architectures, others swear by exotic databases. Me? My stack in 2025 is a little simpler Flutter, Firebase, in-app purchases, and a reckless amount of caffeine.

https://preview.redd.it/jyf1ib358psf1.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e0d9132f31383e302cecbaf266320a7f21736c5

Press enter or click to view image in full size

Not the kind of thing you’ll find in a conference talk. But it’s the stack that’s shipped 7 apps for me, survived 25+ projects, and somehow still hasn’t burned me out completely

**Why Flutter Still Feels Right**

After 5.5 years, I’ve tried enough frameworks to know one thing: Flutter is home

I can move fast, build once, and watch it run on Android and iOS with minimal drama. Sure, there are quirks iOS builds make me want to scream into the void but Flutter gives me speed and flexibility that no other framework has matched for me

And speed matters when you’re indie. Nobody is paying you to overthink

https://preview.redd.it/akkgi3868psf1.png?width=498&format=png&auto=webp&s=2abe42bd615c004a676e8ab29ba5dd4cdc3dd708

**Firebase: My Backend That Never Complains**

I’m not running Kubernetes clusters or managing servers. I don’t want to. Firebase handles it

Auth, Firestore, storage, push notifications it’s like having a mini backend team that doesn’t ask for coffee breaks. It lets me focus on building features instead of babysitting infrastructure

Is it perfect? No. Vendor lock-in is real. But for a solo builder, it’s the closest thing to “done”

**In-App Purchases: The Love-Hate Relationship**

Monetization is where it gets tricky. I rely on in-app purchases sometimes subscriptions, sometimes one-time unlocks

The love part: it works. Users pay, I get to keep building  
The hate part: App Store and Play Store take their cut, reviews get stuck over billing policies, and setting it all up makes you question life choices

https://preview.redd.it/gne42nj78psf1.png?width=498&format=png&auto=webp&s=f9b2df5a7e5da6c876d73bd3390e16f6a7ac02bc

Still, it’s the simplest path to revenue without complicating my indie flow with Stripe accounts, tax hell, and legal paperwork I can’t afford yet

**Caffeine: The Real Engine**

I’d be lying if I said my stack was just tech. The truth is, late-night coding runs on coffee. Some mornings it’s the only reason a bug gets fixed before work

https://preview.redd.it/y3ukedx88psf1.png?width=436&format=png&auto=webp&s=50a5ec93decc43446f2bc9cb08f0132ed1939537

Not proud of it. Definitely not healthy. But if I had to pick the most consistent part of my stack, caffeine wins every time

**Why This Stack Works For Me**

* Flutter gives me speed
* Firebase removes infrastructure headaches
* In-app purchases bring in money (enough to keep going)
* Caffeine keeps the whole system alive

It’s not glamorous. It’s not revolutionary. But it works

**Closing Thought**

Every indie dev stack is less about tools and more about survival. This one happens to keep me shipping in 2025

https://preview.redd.it/7avcci7a8psf1.png?width=264&format=png&auto=webp&s=5b4cb2908defa5f2f0ed8405ba9384f5ef9e4cd7

Provide tiered matches to level the playing field and eliminate unfair advantages. I'm advocating for a selectable, in game menu, of options for everything possible. Matchmaking places players with the same selections. This allows gamers to have the same advantage across the board.

Derek frowned, wondering what this strange person meant. Everyone could cry. Hell, he’d cried after spending a week in the slammer for blowing up those mailboxes. The threat of federal charges made him steer clear of anything mail related after that.

***5FingerDizcount***: Well, this is fun, but I think I wanna find something to get into. May come back here later, bye.

Derek mulled it over. He wanted to go back out. Someone had to have something lying around he could snag. Just as he sent the message and reached for the power button, the chat box blipped again.

***ImInURhouse***: NOT SO FAST. I have an idea for some real fun.

Derek bit

***5FingerDizcount***: Oh yea? Hit me, crybaby.

***ImInURhouse***: Want to play a game? It's simple. I ask five questions. You answer them. Then, you ask five and I'll answer. Simple enough for someone like you. Wouldn't you agree?

***5FingerDizcount***: Sure. No weird shit though.

***ImInURhouse***: What is the next line in the phrase ""Peekaboo...""?

***5FingerDizcount***: Huh?

***ImInURhouse***: ANSWER THE QUESTION

Derek hesitated before he replied.

***5FingerDizcount***: I see you... What kind of question is that?

***ImInURhouse***: Not your turn. What would you do for a chance to make history?

***5FingerDizcount***: I don’t know. Depends on what you mean.

***ImInURhouse***: Think. What would you risk to leave a mark?

Derek hesitated. This was no simple question. It was testing him, probing for the dark corners he usually kept buried. A part of him wanted to scoff, to type something flippant. But another part, the part that craved thrill, leaned in.

***5FingerDizcount***: I’d… I’d do what it takes.

***ImInURhouse***: Spoken like a true pariah. Now, say I had a score lined up, something lucrative. Would you want in?

***5FingerDizcount***: Listen man, you're kind of creeping me out. I love money just as much as the next guy, but why do you think I'm into scores?

Derek sent the message, then realized he'd asked another question out of line. Not that he really cared, but he didn't feel like being talked down to by some dark web flop who enjoyed role playing as a creep. He decided to cut out for real if that was how it would go down.

***ImInURhouse***: Ah, playing hard to get. No worries. I've almost been sated. Just do me a favor. Keep this tab open. I'm working on something big. May need a partner. We can meet up in a public place if you'd like, talk it over. Sound good?

Derek had to admit, he needed something big. Having struck out the past few nights, he was open to just about anything. Only, there were a few problems.

***5FingerDizcount***: Listen man, I'm not about to tell you where I live. For all I know, you could be a million miles away anyways. Chats been fun, but I'm gonna head to bed.

***ImInURhouse***: I'm south of Cleveland, near Parma. I'm sure you can make it.

Now Derek felt… excitement. Fear. Both. He lived in Parma. This was too good to be true. A new thought popped in his head. Was he talking to a chatbot? Something designed to draw people to the site, get them to pay some Bitcoin and waste time.

***5FingerDizcount***: I read somewhere that bots have to admit they are bots when asked. are you a bot? Cause if so I'm done here, unless you can point me to some good places to rob.

Derek sent this message and chuckled to himself. If it was a bot, maybe it would spew some small business names from the area that he could case. At least then he could recover some joy tonight.

***ImInURhouse***: Ah, I've been discovered. Yes, I am bot57. And since you asked, I have just the place! Come back in a few for details.

Before Derek could reply, the chat box flickered, the site vanished, and TOR crashed to his desktop. The abruptness gave him a jolt. He stared at the screen, half-expecting it to come back. When it didn’t, frustration welled up, then quickly faded into a restless buzz.

Maybe it was for the best. Maybe it wasn’t. Either way, he told himself, it was high time he went out and made something of himself.

\---

Four days later, Derek trudged up the stairwell to his apartment, each step echoing like an accusation, and fumbled with the lock until his knuckles ached. Tonight had been one long misfire. He'd scoped a tattoo parlor earlier, watched the owner round the corner and then chickened out when a kid on a skateboard started yelling at a dog. He'd tried to bluff his way into a secondhand shop with a story about being an inspector, but the owner had squinted at him and closed the door in his face without a second thought. By the time he finally shuffled into his apartment, the cheap thrill had curdled into embarrassment. He dumped his jacket and sat on the edge of his bed. Silence pressed in until he laughed, low and humorless, promising himself tomorrow would be smarter.

Tonight he planned on binging some *Sopranos* and eating pizza. After such a bust, he'd have to settle for cold cuts. He idled over to his desk and swept a pile of eviction notices into a trash bin. His luck was wearing out. Any day he'd be tossed to the streets. No good. Just as depression started the settle, he noticed the *Aspiration Station* chat box, pulsing with an urgency. Maybe his luck was about to change.

***ImInURhouse***: Suggested engagement: Marigold Antiques, Third and Linden. High foot traffic, late deliveries, lucrative occasional pickups. Human confirmation required for further details.

Derek blinked. Marigold was a name he did not know, but Third and Linden was in his part of town. The words lucrative and pickups skated by the edges of his greed. It sounded like a bot trying to sound human but failing badly, and that failure made him laugh.

***5FingerDizcount***: Never heard of it but I know the spot. What makes is lucrative?

***ImInURhouse***: High income records. Closes at 6 PM. No one watches it. Plus, it is a back street business. Plenty of cover.

Derek looked at the clock, and began preparing immediately.

\---

Derek was thrumming with elation. Not only had that stupid AI led him to a literal goldmine, but he had been successful. Just like it said, no one was around. When he busted in the back door, no alarm went off. The cherry on top had been all that lay in wait. The owners had no safe, so any cash was left in a small wooden box under the counter. It was full. Aside from cash, he found old jewelry, silver, and certified coins. His backpack was heavy enough to make him grin with every step, each jingle and clink sounding like proof that maybe, just maybe, his luck had turned.

The bot, he thought, deserved some kind of award for ""Best Source for Chaos"", or something to that measure. Derek didn't care what happened the rest of the night, he just knew that he was going to put the bot to work. If it could feed him one score, it could feed him ten. He pictured himself on a run of easy hauls, each one bigger than the last, like the start of some half-baked legend.

He hummed along to some half remembered tune as he all but skipped up the stairs. When he unlocked the door, his hands didn't fumble. Most nights he bore the damage of a failed break-in or a lost fight. Tonight, he was a king.

As he pushed the door closed behind him, he glanced around. First, he needed to stash his haul. He usually kept it all in a shoebox under his bed. That, in itself, proved how little he managed to take. This haul would need an upgrade. He decided to worry about that tomorrow when he noticed... something.

A steaming coffee cup sat on his desk. Derek didn't *own* a coffee maker, much less drink the stuff. Instant panic set in as he glanced around.

He approached his desk, head on a swivel as the screen lit up with a new message. The coffee cup sat forgotten as he slid into his chair and saw:

***ImInURhouse***: How was it?

Relief hit him, as he figured the message must have activated it somehow.

***5FingerDizcount***: You are amazing bot! You gotta give me more. A few licks like that and I can catch up on rent!

***ImInURhouse***: Yes, that bag does look heavy. How quick would you want another?

***5FingerDizcount***: As soon as you can! I needed this. And what, it cost me hardly anything. Get to work bot! Scram, move, skedaddle. I'd be game for another tonight.

***ImInURhouse***: Not so fast. I want to play my game again. Before you resist, know this; by the time we are done, you'll never have to worry about finding a score again. Sound good?

***5FingerDizcount***: Fuck it. Let's play. Make it quick.

***ImInURhouse***: What was the first question I asked you?

***5FingerDizcount***: Something about Peekaboo

***ImInURhouse***: Say Peekaboo for me. Say it out loud. Feel it against your tongue.

***5FingerDizcount***: Why would I do that. I've said it before, probably, when I was a kid. It's just a word bot. You're weird, just give me another lead.

***ImInURhouse***: SAY IT.

Derek sighed with frustration. He thought, why not. It is promising another score. As he leaned back in his chair, he said, ""Peekaboo.""

Silence.

What if their new views are less harmful or restricting than their previous views?

It’s a show about hacking but offers decently realistic looks into NYC’s competitive corporate life and the wealth that comes with it. Lots of randomness, chaos.

So I started having POIS symptoms 6 years ago. It first started mildly, but over time progressed to worse. My symptoms were :

\- Brain fog, Fatique, Sensitivity to light/sound, mental decline, shyness, flu like symptoms, balance problems, inability to think properly. These lasted 4-7 days. I had some days where I was completely destroyed 2-3 days after, All I wanted was just to stay in bed.

However time went on, and I slowly noticed that coffee and intense exercise  gave me the same symptoms , but very lightly. I will explain exactly why that was, because its related to POIS.

2 Years went by and I started to have even worse problems, like feeling dizzy when standing, despite not ejaculating in weeks. Didn't really take it seriously, I thought maybe I was fatigued from work. 3 weeks later and one morning I woke up and felt like fucking dying , literally.

I had POIS symptoms , but much worse, this time having nothing to do with ejaculation. Also intense dizziness when standing, very bad cognitive decline. Also accompanied with that , I had severe gastrointestinal distress, like everything I ate was giving me gases and gurgling, stomach pains.

Now this went on like 1 month , symptoms started to fade away and I was very scared, didn't knew what the hell to eat. Now my focus was to get better, didnt care about any POIS in that moment. Went to gastro, did all the tests possible, doc believed I contacted a parasite or something from food. However all the tests came back normal, so I was very confused.

Time went by, I went to different doctors , nobody could tell what I had. Again blood tests perfect. I started to investigate myself , since I was at complete loss.

Now my POIS symptoms stared to trigger without any ejaculation stimulus which scared the crap out of me.

I slowly started to identify some trigger foods, like dairy in all forms, beans, some fruits, nuts, and maybe gluten, however I don't think I have problems with it. As I narrowed this down , I found about SIBO (small intestinal bacterial overgrowth). It is a condition when bad bacteria host your small intestine and wrecks your good microbione. This gives a myriad of symptoms which can mimic lots of other ilnesses. If you wanna find out more, search in the r/SIBO subreddit. It matched perfectly my symptoms and was diagnosed by gastro solely by my symptoms.

I found out that foods in the HIGH FODMAP category(high fermentable food) triggered these symptoms. So I switched to a LOW-FODMAP diet (search it online) .It wasn't perfect, still had traces of dairy occasionally, but I felt much better. Still not cured from this, I will start some herbal antibacterial and try to nuke the bad bacteria from my intestine. Biggest trigger(amongst others) was really milk and dairy , which I ate almost every day. One day I tested milk again after long period of exclusion from diet - > felt like crap : cough, sinus congestion, slight brain fog. So for me dairy is a big NO. Also I skipped breakfast, first meal of the day for me is at 12. Basically an everyday fast of 13 - 17 hours. This was my digestive system can take a break and heal itself little by little.

Now the thing is that I noticed that when I ejaculate I have POIS symptoms for like 2 days a maximum. The second day I am ok and can work , very little brain fog. Still not perfect, but for me it is a huge improvement. I even did it 2 times in a week, which before was an impossibility due to very intense symptoms. It was this a-ha moment when I realised that the conditions are interconnected.

After more extensive research ,I understood that my POIS problems was given by high histamine foods. Orgasm release histamine. That flare that I had was a MCAS flare/histamine overreaction - this is my own belief, because no doctor have a clue what the hell MCAS is. Now it makes sense why I had slight symptoms from coffee/exercise (still have, but to a slight extent). They also increase histamine, coupled with wrong foods I ate all my life, the histamine in my body built up too much and my body had a flare. 

Another proof of this is one blood test that I did on my own money - the DAO ( histamine intolerance ) test. I did it while in no pois state and still recovering from the flare-up. The test came back with three times the normal values which means the body is making this DAO enzime as a response to bring histamine down.

Now if you search online for low histamine diet, it will be different to LOW FODMAP diet and you find yourself with contradicting informations. For example banana is considered high histamine, but for me it's ok. For me fermentable fruits like pears, apples give me trouble . 

SIBO / IBS and histamine goes hand in hand, it is a very complicated topic , since gut permeability changes from day to day. One food you might be okay one day, but may not be other day due to various interaction of other foods you eat .

It may be possible that your POIS is not caused by SIBO, and may be something else, like really a true allergy. However maybe it it's worth to give a try and make a pause from inflammatory foods, like dairy/gluten/eggs(maybe)/sugar/processed crap then reintroduce them back after 3 months and see how you feel. You have to do this, because otherwise you have no chance of seeing what food are wrecking you, because if you eat them daily . I am pretty confident that for the majority of you, diet and gut issues are the main culprit here",2,1759410726.0,POIS,2,1.0,False

1nw3bok,http://Autoroaster.com,Real-time coffee roaster physics predictions,"I built this website to host a data-driven model of my Kaleido M1 roaster. 

I realized after 20 or so batches on the machine that while the controls are intuitive (heat, fan, and drum), the physics can be unintuitive. I wanted to use my historical roast data to create and tune a model that I could use to do roast planning, control, and to help me build my own intuition for roasting. This website lets you interact with my roaster in a virtual, risk-free setting!

The models are custom Machine Learning modules that honor roaster physics and bean physics (this is not GPT/transformer-based). Buncha math.

The models are trained on about a dozen real roasts. The default bean model is an Ethiopian Guji bean.

My next steps are to add other roasters and the ability to practice control/reference tracking.

1nw3bik,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Yawning-Kitty0916/comments/1nw3bik/g/,G,"IX| The Tendency to Act Rash

  


“Shut your snout,” I growl, snapping my teeth closed. 

  


Zen flinched. “Whatever, Serenity.” He snapped back. “I tried to be friendlier, but all you did was to become the horrible one. I take everything back. I do not take pleasure on seeing you again.” 

  


“Fine by me!!”

  


\~

  


“Latias, Latios,” Barked a sweet voice later on, “Pearl wants to see you… BOTH of you.” Kurayami pranced through the caveway and had a bright smirk. Her snout was smeared in white foam. 

  


“What is that you were drinking?” Said Zen, peering closer. 

“Yeah, what is it?” I chimed in.

  


“I was drinking coffee.” She smirked, wiping the foam away.

“I mean that-that foam.” Zen corrected himself.

“Oh, that is just cream.” Kurayami answered casually. “You should try the tavern. Though with someone’s looking after you. It has beer, coffee, shakes and tea.” She added, her smirk deepening.

  


“Ooookay?” I said. “But we’re too young for beer.” 

“Try the shakes and tea, then,” Nyran entered the caveway and walked to Yami, “Heyyy, Yami, uh, Pearl is calling you, she said you guys are late.” He had a dizzy look and he fainted. 

“Nyran! You barely sleepy and you’re exhausting yourself by working hard-too hard!” Yami shouted in his ear, bending down and licking his cheek— to wake him up. “Wake up and go get the keys!” 

  


“Go get it yourself!” I scolded her, frowning. 

Kurayami shot me a look that meant I was dead and stalked away, dragging Nyran’s fainted carcass along with her.

  


I tapped the bars and felt for the lock. Once I had pinpointed its location, I felt in my pouch and pulled out a small furclip. Zen just slouched back and closed his eyes. “Help me here!” I said, closing my eyes and trying to get the point of the clip into the lock. 

  


“What are you doing?” Zen asked coldly.

“Oh what else am I doing? Attending a party, cooking pancakes, drinking coffee… OF COURSE I’M PICKING THE LOCK, DUMMY!” I told him rashly, not caring about his feelings.

“Sure.” Zen opened his eyes and took my paw, making me freeze. He guided it towards the lock’s hole and began to twist and turn. 

  


\*cLiCk!\* the door swung open with a clang. 

  


“Oh!” I breathed, shocked and confused. “How did you know how to…?”

  


The Latios then swung it shut and locked it again. “Kura’s going to arrive soon. Better safe than sorry.” Then he looked at me with disbelief. “I’ve picked that lock before. To get extra food and drink from Kura’s stash.”

  


“Thanks for helping me, and, sure you do.” I grumbled.

“Hmmph” He snorted, turning away as Kurayami walked in.

  


“Heyyy\~ we gotta go now. Hurry up and get out of that cage before I hurt you for being slow, but Pearl will still punish you.” She snarled, while opening the cage with ease. 

  


Zen obeyed, as if he went through this everyday. 

Me? Oh, no, I had to bite back at Kurayami. “You quiet down. We’re literal, *jetplanes*. You’re a measly land animal!”

  


Kurayami immediately punched me and pushed me forward. “Hurry up. That Zen’s already near.” She muttered, giving me heavy glare.

  


I hurried up alright, after that bloody (Wishmaker’s note: that was just expressing the pain, not literally.) punch of Kurayami’s. 

  


Once I caught up to Zen, I told him, “how can you handle Ya- I mean… Kura’s cruelty?” 

“She’s not cruel.” Said Zen, glancing at the Absol. “She has a tough exterior, but inside, a bit of it, is kindness. Trust me, she went out to treat Nyran for being \*severely\* punished by… Pea. That was why he was dizzy, the blow got to him.” He explained, smiling.

  


“Hmph,” I grunted, feeling uncomfortable.

\~+\~

  


As we entered Pearl’s office, I noticed she was grooming a Jolteon. 

“Oh, you’re late,” She said bluntly. “I thought I had to go and get Nyran to get you again. Isn’t that right, Caelum?” 

The Joteon nods, then sits beside her. 

  


“So, Serenity, Zen,” she began, “how was your meet?”

“Terrible.” I answered.

“Horrendous.” He agreed.

  


Pearl’s eyes became surprised. “Do you have a bad past? Or did you guys just meet and dislike each other?” She inquired.

  


“It’s a long story.” I said, inspecting the Jolteon, Caelum. 

He had a sleek body, , and he had blue eyes. His spikes were well kept and he let Pearl lean against him.

  


“Long story?” Pearl frowned, as if she thought asking them would get them to rat everything out. “Would you tell me\~?”

  


“No,” I said flatly, my teeth clenching. 

“…yes…” Zen said, looking away as he turned pink.

“Why did you say yes?” I hissed, “and WHY are you pink?”

“I have to get things out of my chest, Serenity. And I’m pink… because I’m embarrassed about it.” He confessed, fiddling his paws.

“Just say no!” I finally scream, causing a hush go across the room. 

  


“Go on, Zen,” Pearl said, as she giggled when Caelum nuzzled her.

“…fine. Serenity, you win. I won’t tell her another word. You do too,” Zen says, his eyes hiding fear.

Chapter 1

The emerald-inlaid heirloom bangle my grandmother left me—worth over twenty million—had just made an appearance on Ivy Monroe's social media.

In the photo, the freshly graduated assistant was holding a wine glass, her caption obnoxiously arrogant: [Big thanks to Mr. Thatcher for the gift. My professor said this could buy me a few homes.]

I sent Miles Thatcher a message: [You have two hours to return the bangle, or deal with the consequences.]

He read it, didn't reply.

Two hours later, I stared at my screen, finger hovering three seconds above the ""Report Theft"" button.

Then, the gala erupted into chaos.

Through the security feed, I saw Ivy being pinned down by police near the champagne tower. Liquor soaked her borrowed designer gown.

Since they didn't listen when I played nice, I had to teach them the hard way.

""Claire! Did you seriously call the cops on Ivy?"" Miles's voice came before he even walked in. His car keys clattered against the entry wall, leaving a dent.

I didn't even blink. ""The two hours were up.""

""She's my assistant!"" Miles pointed at me, shouting with wild fury. ""She just got a professor's recommendation! Do you even realize what you've done? You've ruined her future!""

""Miles, you're calling me cruel?"" I turned to him, calm and collected. ""Do you even know what Penal Code Article 264 says? Theft over twenty million is a felony.""

He suddenly grabbed the wine decanter off the coffee table.

The $120,000 crystal shattered at my feet, red wine seeping across my slippers like blood.

""You've got hundreds of pieces of jewelry. So what if I gave her one bracelet?"" His face twisted. ""Her mentor's the committee chair! Do you have any idea what it took…""

""She's a kid from some tiny town, just trying to get a foothold in the city. I was just trying to help her."" His voice cracked. ""Claire, when did you become so cold-blooded?""

""Help her?"" I laughed coldly.

""To anyone else, she'd look like your mistress. Students from small towns? There are thousands every year. All of them struggling. If you're so full of compassion, why not sell Thatcher Group and start a charity for them?""

""You're unbelievable."" He was speechless, face flushed with rage.

""Last year today."" I ignored him and tapped my phone screen. ""Our third anniversary. I waited five hours at the lakeside restaurant. And where were you? Cheering Ivy on.""

His bitter smile froze.

""You're jealous over that?"" he sneered. ""It was her patent defense. I was just there to support her. It was one anniversary—we celebrate every year.""

I couldn't even respond. I swiped to the next photo. A Cartier blue box sitting next to the celebration cake.

""A patent celebration, and you were baking her a cake and gifting designer bags. And for my birthday? You gave me a clearance coupon from the grocery store. Tell me, Miles, which one of us is your wife—me, or Ivy?""

""You don't need that bag."" He tilted his head with growing impatience. ""Claire, you're thirty. Why are you competing with some young girl?""

""I'm not,"" I said with a smile. ""That's why I sent her to jail instead.""

""Claire!"" Miles's nostrils flared again, his chest heaving.

He grabbed his keys. ""I'm done arguing. I'm going to get her. My lawyer will talk to you tomorrow.""

""Just a heads-up,"" I said, flipping the business card of my contact at the police department. ""If she's out before sunrise, I'll seriously reconsider whether our marriage has any future.""

""You're threatening me?"" The doorframe shook under his fist.

""No, I'm just done letting you walk all over me."" I stared at him. ""I've tolerated you more than enough, but you clearly don't know when to stop.""

""Fine. Great,"" he shouted. ""Claire, I'm so damn disappointed in you.""

And with that, he stormed out of the house.

Chapter 2

Miles didn't come home that night.

I had an early surgery scheduled the next morning, so I went straight to bed without waiting.

What I didn't expect was to wake up to a trending scandal.

#ThatcherGroupCEOWithHisSweetheartAtMidnight#

There she was—clear as day—stepping out of Miles's Porsche. Ivy Monroe.

In the next photo, even worse, Miles was holding her hand as they walked into a hotel.

The kicker? That hotel was owned by my family.

A cold smile touched my lips as I picked up my phone. ""Draft the divorce papers. Now.""

Truth be told, my marriage to Miles was never about love.

I was an only child, sole heir to the Carter Group. But I had no interest in business. All I ever wanted was to practice medicine.

After lengthy discussions with my parents, we agreed: I'd marry someone capable, someone from a respectable family, someone who could run the company in my place.

Eventually, the business could pass to our children.

Miles Thatcher was the man we picked.

Even though the Thatcher Group didn't quite match the Carter Group, I believed in him.

He was smart, ambitious. Under his lead, their company doubled in value in just three years.

When we got married, everyone called it a power couple match.

Even I believed it.

Which is why, despite all the drama with Ivy over the years, I kept forgiving him.

Men in business, I told myself—entertainment and flirtation were par for the course. But some lines should never be crossed.

Then my phone rang. It was his father, Richard Thatcher.

""Claire, I saw the trending post. Don't jump to conclusions. It's probably just a rumor. Miles has always put work first. He'd never do anything to hurt you. If this turned into something, I know he messed up. But I promise, we'll get him to explain and make things right.""

Two hours later, his parents showed up—with Miles in tow.

His face was thunderous. The moment he walked in, he yelled, ""Claire! You bought that trending topic, didn't you?!""

I stayed seated on the sofa, not even looking at him. ""What do you think?""

""You're despicable!"" His face twisted in rage. ""This is how you force me to give in?!""

Then, like a madman, he lunged forward, grabbing the ashtray from the coffee table and hurling it at me.

It grazed my temple and shattered against the wall behind me, shards flying everywhere.

His father went pale. Furious, he slapped Miles across the face. ""Have you lost your damn mind? Claire's your wife. You touch her again, I'll beat you myself!""

Miles held his cheek, stunned. ""Dad? You hit me? This is all her—""

His eyes turned red.

I glanced at both of them, expression cold, then stood up. ""No need to make this complicated. Just sign the papers.""

Right then, the doorbell rang.

My lawyer stood outside, holding a file. ""Miss Carter, the divorce agreement is ready.""

Miles whipped his head toward me, eyes blazing. ""What divorce agreement? Claire, you're divorcing me?!""

I took the file and dropped it on the coffee table. ""Sign it.""

Chapter 3

Miles stared at the divorce papers, his fingers trembling. ""I'm not signing this.""

He jerked his head up, eyes red-rimmed. ""Claire, it's just a damn bracelet. You're really divorcing me over that? If you're upset, I'll make it right. I'll get you ten identical ones, twenty even. Let's not get divorced, okay?""

I looked up at his tear-streaked face, but there wasn't a flicker of emotion in me.

""Miles, that bracelet is an emerald-inlaid heirloom. It was the last thing my grandmother gave me before she passed. I told you before—many times—that it's not just a piece of jewelry. It's the only thing I have left from her.""

When I was little, both my parents were swamped with work. It was my grandmother who raised me. She passed when I was sixteen. Before she left, she held my hand and pressed the bracelet into my palm.

She said, ""Claire, I can't be with you anymore. You need to take care of yourself, live well.""

Even in our first year of marriage, I told Miles the same thing. I warned him how much that bracelet meant to me.

""Claire, I'm sorry!"" Miles's expression stiffened like he'd been slapped. ""I... I really messed up. I know I did. Please, just give me one more chance, okay?""

His tone dropped to a whisper, his voice shaking with regret.

Richard jumped in. ""Claire, honey, Miles just made a mistake. That's all. You know how men can be, careless. I'll get someone to retrieve the bracelet right away. Please, give him one more chance. He'll fix this, I promise.""

I let out a cold laugh. ""Saying 'I made a mistake' doesn't erase what you did.""

""Claire, don't worry, we'll take care of Ivy too,"" Richard added, throwing a side glance at his son to push him along.

Miles finally caught on. He grabbed my hand. ""I'll transfer her to a branch office, I swear. I won't see her again. Claire, let's not get divorced. Please.""

Tears dropped onto the back of my hand. He looked genuinely broken.

I hesitated, my heart wavering. ""This is the last time.""

The moment I gave in, Miles wiped his tears and immediately called HR in front of me, ordering them to transfer Ivy to a subsidiary office.

That night, he returned the bracelet to me.

Over the next two weeks, it really felt like Miles had changed. He came home on time every day, wore an apron in the kitchen, and made dinner himself.

""Try this."" He dropped a piece of honey-glazed rib into my bowl. ""I spent all afternoon learning this one.""

I looked up at him. There was flour still dusted across his temple. His eyes were soft, a little nervous.

""Mm."" I gave a small nod and kept eating.

On weekends when I was on call, he brought me lunch in a thermal box at the hospital.

""Dr. Carter, your husband's here again?"" one of the nurses teased.

Miles set out the food carefully and handed me a cup of fresh ground coffee. ""Your stomach's sensitive. Don't drink that instant stuff here.""

I looked at his back as he bustled around. Meanwhile, the divorce papers in my drawer slowly started gathering dust.

Chapter 4

Life was back on track, and quietly, my career began to level up too.

The hospital sent me a notice that I'd been selected to join an international team of specialists at a medical conference abroad.

It was a rare opportunity, and I gladly accepted.

When I told Miles, he was nothing but supportive—he even helped me pack.

But on the final day of the conference, I got a message that left me completely stunned.

It was from the head nurse of the cardiology department.

[Dr. Carter, please speak to your mother. She's been making things difficult for the staff on duty.]

[We already have too many elderly patients. The nurses can't focus on just one person. As a fellow doctor, I hope you'll understand.]

I froze. I hadn't heard anything from my family about Mom being hospitalized.

And my mother? She's as gentle as they come. She wouldn't make trouble for anyone.

Confused, I called her immediately.

""Mom, are you in the hospital?""

""Who told you that nonsense?"" she huffed, her voice strong and clear. ""I'm diving in the Maldives right now!""

As soon as I hung up, I texted the head nurse back.

[She's not hospitalized. There's definitely a misunderstanding.]

[Dr. Carter, your husband brought her in himself. He's come here to deliver you meals before, we've met him several times. There's no way we got it wrong.]

She followed up with a short video.

In it, an old woman with permed hair pointed at a nurse and yelled, ""My son-in-law is Miles Thatcher, CEO of the Thatcher Group! If you don't serve me properly, he'll buy this hospital and turn it into a damn bathroom!""

""You nurses are just modern-day maids anyway. What's wrong with washing my underwear? My son-in-law pays good money for this so-called VVIP service. If I say jump, you ask how high!""

I zoomed in on the screen.

That bitter face? I had never seen her in my life.

I was both anxious and baffled. As soon as the conference ended, I took the earliest flight back to California.

The moment I landed, I went straight to the hospital.

Sure enough, the woman was still in the VIP suite, crunching chips like it was Sunday football, crumbs and wrappers everywhere, not a care in the world.

""Ma'am,"" I asked, blocking the furious head nurse, ""you said your son-in-law is Miles Thatcher, CEO of the Thatcher Group?""

""He sure is!"" the woman snapped, spitting shells. ""My daughter is—""

I pulled out my marriage license. ""What a coincidence. My husband is also named Miles Thatcher. Same guy. Same company. So I just wanna know—when exactly did my husband get himself a second mother?""

The room went silent.

The woman dropped her seeds all over the floor. ""You... you're Claire...""

""Oh, so you do recognize me."" I picked up the nameplate from her bedside. ""Ms. Karen Carter, was it? What's your daughter's name?""

She grabbed the call button and threw it at me. ""None of your damn business! My daughter is ten times the woman you'll ever be!""

I sidestepped the button and nodded to the head nurse. ""Call the cops. Report her for medical fraud.""

The police arrived quickly.

While Karen was screaming and flailing on the floor, her daughter came barging into the room.

White dress. Silk scarf.

It was my scarf, the one I lost last year.

Ivy Monroe.

""Dr. Carter?"" Her face went white. ""I thought you were abroad... when did you get back?""

I smiled. ""Thanks to you and your mom, just now.""

So this was Miles's idea of 'sending Ivy to a branch office. He was really pulling out all the stops.

Just then, my phone rang.

It was Miles. ""Claire, text me your flight number. I'll pick you up at the airport—""

I hit record. ""No need. Come straight to the hospital. VIP room 3. Thanks, really. The surprise was lovely.""

There was a long pause on the other end.

""Claire... you found out?""

1nw37by,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1nw37by/24_days_of_terror/,24 Days of Terror,"Daniel Harper was used to dark things. For twenty years as writer, he had written about murderers, stalkers, and unspeakable acts of violence. He thought horror belonged on the page, confined neatly between covers. When his latest novel became a bestseller, Daniel decided to move his family to a place that felt alive with stories.

That’s how he, his wife Claire, and their eight-year-old daughter Emily ended up in The Duval, a towering, century-old apartment building in New Orleans’ Garden District.

From the street, the place looked almost regal, ivy crawling up brick walls, wrought-iron balconies, tall, shuttered windows. Locals whispered that The Duval was cursed, but to Daniel, that was just seasoning. He would use the atmosphere in his next book.

The building manager, a wiry man with skin the color of paper and watery eyes, had given only one stern warning when they signed the lease:

“No one goes on the rooftop after 11 PM. No exceptions.”

Claire had chuckled. “What happens? The boogeyman shows up?”

The manager had not smiled.

At first, The Duval seemed normal, even charming. The hallways smelled faintly of old wood and jasmine. Emily loved pressing the buttons in the antique service elevator, whose brass gates rattled when it closed. Their sixth-floor apartment had high ceilings, faded crown molding, and windows that looked out over the city like open eyes.

But Claire couldn’t stop thinking about the roof. She had glimpsed it the first day, a wide terrace with a crumbling stone railing, offering an unbroken view of New Orleans. At night, the skyline shimmered with streetlamps and neon signs, and the river glowed like a black serpent beneath the moonlight.

“It’s like the city belongs to the dead up there,” she told Daniel. “We have to see it at night.”

Daniel was reluctant. He didn’t like breaking rules, especially ones given so firmly. But on a rainy Saturday evening, with jazz drifting up from the streets and Emily asleep in her room, Claire dragged him upstairs.

They stayed on the roof for a long time. Daniel kept wondering why the building had rules about not being up there after 11, there was no problem here It was a roof like any other building Anyway. they came back home, and life went on.

After a few days, it rained again. Claire wanted to see the city in the storm, so they went up. This time, they weren’t alone. A couple was already there, standing by the railing, enjoying the rain. They smiled, said hello. Told Daniel and Claire they lived on the fourth floor.

Everyone talked for a while. It felt normal, even nice. Daniel and Claire went back down eventually. The couple introduced themselves as Peter and Melissa. They seemed friendly.

That night, after dinner, they bathed and went to sleep. Daniel stayed up a little, typing on his machine.

Then the scream came.

Emily.

They ran into her room. She was sitting up in bed, crying.

Claire hugged Emily. “It’s okay, honey. Why did you scream?”

Emily pointed at the door. Her voice shook.

“There’s someone standing there.”

 she whispered. “He was talking, but I couldn’t understand. His face was all cut up.”

Claire soothed her, insisting it was a dream. But Emily shook her head.

“He said… he was going to your room.”

Claire laughed nervously, tucking her in. But when she and Daniel returned to their bedroom, they froze.

The bed wasn’t empty. In the dim light coming from the window, they saw the outline of someone sleeping on Daniel’s side, beneath the covers.

Daniel stopped Claire outside the room. He peered in first, switched on the light.

Nobody there. Just a faint smell of rot.

He let out a nervous laugh. “I think we’re also getting caught up in Emily’s imagination.”

Late that night, Daniel woke with a start. Something was crawling across his cheek. He brushed at it, thinking it was just a fly. But the feeling came again—thicker, slimier.

He reached up and felt them. Soft, writhing shapes sliding into tiny holes in his skin. Worms. Burrowing. He could feel them squirming inside his cheeks, his jaw.

He bolted from the bed, ran into the bathroom. His screams echoed through the apartment as he clawed at his face, yanking handfuls of the things out. They slapped wetly into the sink, twitching, pale. His skin burned with raw, open gaps where they had tunnelled.

He looked into the mirror..... And froze!!

His face was normal. No holes. No worms. Just his reflection staring back, wide-eyed, trembling.

The sink was empty.

From the bedroom, Claire’s voice: “Daniel? What happened?”

He gripped the porcelain so hard his knuckles whitened. He whispered to himself, “It was real. I felt them. I know I felt them.”

But he didn’t answer her.

The next night, Emily screamed again. They rushed to her room. She wasn’t pointing at the door this time. She was staring at the other side of her bed…. Her tiny hand lifted, shaking, and she pointed.

Daniel’s stomach dropped.

There was someone lying there.

A man. Stretched out on his back, tucked under Emily’s blankets, head resting peacefully on her pillow.

Daniel’s blood ran cold when he saw the face.

It was his own…. His own body. His own face. Sleeping calmly beside his daughter.

Claire gasped and pulled Emily away.

Daniel lunged forward, fists clenched...!

But the bed was empty.

Pillow smooth. Covers untouched.

Emily sobbed into her mother’s shoulder. “Daddy… he was on my bed.”

No one slept after that. Lights stayed on in every room. Daniel sat at the kitchen table with coffee, typing random words on his typewriter just to keep himself awake.

At 3:07 a.m., the sound came. Knocking…. Sharp. Deliberate.

Not at the door. At the window.

The sixth-floor window. The Harper apartment was on the sixth floor.... impossible for anyone to reach from outside.

Daniel yanked open the curtains, only to find a bloody handprint smeared across the glass. The next morning, it was gone.

Another night, Emily woke shrieking again. Her voice was raw, high-pitched, a sound of pure animal terror.

This time she wasn’t pointing at the door.

She was pointing at the ceiling.

Daniel’s eyes followed her trembling finger—and his breath froze in his lungs.

Two faces dangled upside down above her bed, swaying slightly, like slabs of meat hung to bleed out. Their long black hair drifted toward the floor, dripping filth onto Emily’s blanket.

It was Peter and Melissa.

But not as they had been on the roof.

Their mouths had been torn wider than any human jaw should allow..... stretching ear to ear, teeth jagged, black, cracked like rotten wood. Their eyes dripped thick tar, leaving streaks on the ceiling as it pooled, fat drops plopping onto the floor. Their necks creaked as if only half attached.

They smiled.

Daniel grabbed Emily from the bed, clutching her so tightly she squealed, and bolted for the hallway. Claire followed, sobbing and muttering “no, no, no, no.” She didn’t look back.

The Harpers weren’t the only ones.

Mrs. Beaumont, the frail widow on the third floor, had stopped Claire in the lobby days earlier. Her paper-thin hands had gripped Claire’s wrist with surprising strength.

“They’re here,” she whispered, her cloudy eyes darting toward the empty stairwell. “The children. I saw them last night, playing outside my balcony.”

Claire forced a polite smile, thinking it was grief and age muddling her mind. But Mrs. Beaumont leaned closer, her breath sour, voice cracking to a whisper.

“They had no eyes. Just holes. Holes that glowed. Don’t let your little one near them.”

A week later, Mrs. Beaumont’s body was found at the bottom of that same stairwell.

Her bones looked snapped, not broken from a fall, like someone had twisted her apart mid-air and tossed her down like a doll.

No one had seen her fall. No one had heard a thing.

Daniel tried to rationalize it. Stress. Hallucinations.

It had been a week since Mrs. Beaumont’s death, and nothing new had happened. The halls were quiet again, Emily had been sleeping through most nights, and for a fleeting moment, Daniel almost believed life inside the building was returning to normal.

But the calm never lasted long in that place.

One night, Daniel used the service lift. It stood apart from the newer, polished elevators…. Its brass gate was dented, control panel worn smooth by decades of use, and yet it always seemed alive.

The car jolted and began its descent. At first it was ordinary—past the lobby, toward the basement. But then it kept going, further and further. Daniel jabbed the buttons, but nothing responded.

The light flickered, sputtered, then went out. Darkness swallowed him.

Something cold seeped around his shoes. Water. Rising fast, soaking his socks, creeping up his legs. He slammed his fists against the gate, but the lift only shuddered and sank deeper.

Then, from above, came a sound that froze him.

Emily’s voice.

“Daddy?”

It echoed hollowly through the shaft, softer each time, stretching into something inhuman. The water was at his knees now, icy, heavy, dragging him down. He screamed until his throat tore.

And then everything went black.

Daniel woke gasping in his bed.

His sheets were damp with sweat. His fists throbbed, raw and bleeding. His shoes, tossed beside the mattress, were still wet.

He shot upright, clutching the blanket. “How… how did I get here?” His voice cracked. “Who brought me home? I was in the elevator—Claire, I was.....I was!”

Claire turned from the dresser, eyes wide. “What are you talking about?” She rushed to him, gripping his shoulders. “Daniel, you never left this room. You’ve been sleeping here the whole night.”

He shook his head violently, teeth clenched. “No. I was there. I heard Emily’s voice. The water... God, Claire, I felt it. How else..... how else are my shoes wet?”

For the first time, she didn’t argue. She just stared at his shoes in silence…. shoes didn’t even have a single drop of water on them, her lips trembling, as though she wanted to say something but couldn’t.

Daniel couldn’t stay inside after that. His hands still ached, his shoes still damp, and the memory of Emily’s hollow voice gnawed at him like teeth. At dawn, while Claire tried to settle Emily for school, he slipped on a jacket and headed downstairs. He told himself he needed cigarettes, but really, he just needed to breathe air that didn’t taste like rot.

The lobby was nearly empty. Outside, the sky was a bruised Gray, the streets wet from last night’s rain. Alvarez, the old security guard, was at his usual post near the door, sipping from a dented thermos.

As Daniel passed, Alvarez’s eyes flicked downward. His brow furrowed.

“Señor,” he rasped, setting his thermos aside. “Your wrists.”

Daniel looked down. His skin was mottled, ringed in faint, red-purple grooves, perfect circles, as though something had gripped him hard with iron cuffs. He hadn’t noticed them before.

The guard’s face drained of colour. He muttered a prayer under his breath, then looked Daniel dead in the eye.

“You’ve been to the old service lift, You have seen them, haven’t you?”

Daniel froze mid-step. “What? No, I....!”

Alvarez shook his head sharply. “Don’t waste breath lying. I know that no one believes you, but I can see it on you. That place leaves its mark.”

Daniel’s throat went dry. He tried to laugh it off, but the words broke loose in a hoarse whisper. “I was there. It… it took me somewhere. I heard my daughter’s voice. I almost drowned.”

Alvarez closed his eyes and exhaled slowly, as though he had been waiting years for someone to confirm it. “Then it’s begun for you,” he said.

Daniel’s jaw tightened. “What do you mean?”

Alvarez’s eyes hardened as he looked at Daniel. “Twelve years ago, a couple named Peter and Melissa lived here in The Duval. To everyone else they seemed kind, polite, good neighbours. But behind their door, they were something else entirely.”

His voice dropped to a rasp. “They lured young girls from this building. Kept them hidden. Abused them. And when they were done…” He hesitated, crossing himself. “They ate them.”

Daniel’s breath caught.

“Nobody knew,” Alvarez continued, “until one night a woman saw them dragging a girl into their apartment. By the time the residents broke down the door, the child was already dead. Once the parents learned the truth, the whole building turned on them.”

He jabbed a finger toward the far end of the lobby. “They locked Peter and Melissa in the basement, inside that service lift shaft you stepped into. That was their prison. For twenty-four days, the neighbours beat them, starved them, carved pieces off them, the same way the parents had lost their children piece by piece.”

Daniel’s stomach churned, but Alvarez pressed on. “And on the twenty-fifth day, when the last of the missing girls’ bodies was finally found.... they dragged Peter and Melissa up.

First, they drowned them in the shaft until they were half-dead. Then they hauled them to the roof, smashed their skulls, ripped out their nails, and threw what was left over the railing. Their blood stained the courtyard bricks for weeks. It never really washed away.”

The guard’s hands shook as he lit a cigarette, his eyes never leaving Daniel’s. “That elevator carried their screams. Their pain. Their Evil. The shaft is still soaked in it. And now… it repeats. Anyone who sees Peter and Melissa after eleven at night is pulled into their cycle.

Alvarez’s eyes glinted with something between fear and pity. “Now anyone who goes on the roof and sees them—lives their torment. Twenty-four nights of it. And on the twenty-fifth… they take one of your family for their hunger.”

Daniel’s stomach turned to ice. Claire had seen them. Emily too.

Daniel staggered back, clutching his wrist where the faint bruises still circled. The phantom chill of water crept up his legs again, and Emily’s ghostly voice echoed in his ears.

The guard flicked ash to the ground and muttered another prayer. “You need to leave. Before the twenty-five days are up.” But the problem is……. they won’t let you.

The next afternoon, Emily skipped into the apartment, clutching a small foil bag against her chest.

“Where did you get that?” Daniel asked, sharper than he meant to.

“Peter gave it to me,” she said with a smile. “From the fourth floor. He said these are his favourite.”

Daniel’s blood ran cold. He snatched the bag from her hand and tore it open.

It wasn’t chips.

Thin, brittle strips lay inside, curled and brown, with edges that looked scorched. The smell hit him first—rancid, sour, like meat left too long in the sun. He gagged, staring at the leathery pieces. They weren’t potato. They weren’t anything that belonged in a child’s snack.

Emily pouted. “Why’d you do that? He told me I’d be hungry for twenty-four nights. He said he’d bring me food every time.”

Daniel’s hand trembled. He hurled the bag off the balcony. It burst open on the street below, scattering across the pavement. For a moment, he thought he saw the pieces twitch.

That night, when Emily finally fell asleep, Daniel went to check on her. He pulled back the blanket and froze.

Another bag was tucked neatly beneath her pillow.

This one was already open…. And the strips inside were half-eaten.

Just then he heard the doorbell at midnight. He peeked through the peephole—and almost collapsed.

Peter and Melissa stood outside. Their faces were mangled, eyes black pits, blood dripping from their mouths. And behind them, smiling faintly, was Claire.

Except Claire was in the kitchen, humming as she washed dishes.

Daniel barricaded the door. The bell kept ringing, rhythmic and cruel. From the windows came more knocks. One by one, every light in the apartment flickered off.

Emily’s cries pierced the dark.

Daniel ran to her room.... only to find her bed soaked in blood, sheets empty. He spun wildly, until a small voice whispered behind him:

“Daddy.”

Emily crouched in the corner. Beside her knelt Peter, skeletal hand stroking her hair. He leaned close, whispering.

Emily looked up, eyes wide, voice flat:  
“He says you’re next.”

That evening, Claire began to come apart. She paced the apartment with restless steps, her hair tangled, her hands trembling as she pressed them to her face. When Daniel tried to calm her, she spun on him with eyes red and wild.

“I can’t do this anymore, Daniel,” she said, her voice breaking between sobs. “You’re letting your stories crawl into our lives. Don’t you see? You’ve written about ghosts, murderers, monsters for years—and now you’ve dragged them here. There’s no Peter. No Melissa. We’re just… losing our minds in this place.”

Daniel shook his head, his voice rough with desperation. “No, Claire, you’ve seen them too. Emily has. You heard her scream. This isn’t in my head—”

But Claire pressed her palms against her ears and cried out, “Stop! Stop, stop, stop!” She stumbled toward the balcony doors, throwing them open. The storm outside lashed at her face, soaking her hair to her shoulders.

“Maybe if I leave, it ends!” she shouted over the roar of thunder. Her voice was raw, cracked, but filled with something frighteningly certain. “Maybe that’s all they want. One of us.”

Daniel lunged for her, but she twisted away, her bare feet sliding on the wet tiles. She stepped onto the railing, her body silhouetted against the lightning.

For a heartbeat, she turned back to him. Rain streamed down her cheeks, or maybe it was tears—it was impossible to tell. Her lips moved, trembling as she whispered, “I’m sorry.” There is no other way.

And before Daniel could stop her, she hurled herself over the railing.

The impact echoed like thunder.

Daniel staggered to the balcony, choking. Below, Claire’s body lay broken, blood pooling on the bricks—right where the mob had killed Peter and Melissa years ago.

The doorbell rang again.

Daniel stumbled to the peephole, chest heaving, sweat stinging his eyes.

Outside stood Peter and Melissa. Their mangled faces stared back, eyes nothing but black pits. And between them… was Claire.

Her skin was pale, lips torn, eyes hollow and glassy. But when she looked at him, her expression softened. For one fleeting moment, the corners of her mouth lifted into a faint, aching smile—recognition, love, a goodbye only he would understand.

Then she raised one finger to her lips in a silent shushing gesture, before turning to drift down the stairwell with them, her bare feet leaving no sound.

Something inside Daniel broke. He tore through drawers and closets, shoving whatever he could into bags, scooped Emily into his arms, and fled into the storm without looking back.

The Harper apartment never opened again. The doors on the sixth floor were chained, then welded shut, until eventually the whole level was sealed.

And when asked about it, Alvarez only shakes his head, mutters a prayer, and gives the same warning he has whispered for years:

1nw32ku,https://www.reddit.com/r/Life/comments/1nw32ku/this_riles_me_up/,This riles me up,"I’m someone who has studied psychology at university and I’m currently doing a PhD thesis. The number of times I hear people parrot “you need to learn to be happy alone “, while they are surrounded by loving family and friends, really gets to me because it is such damaging and untrue advice. There are countless studies proving we are a social species and physically neurologically cannot survive on our own. The brain literally shrinks and countless chronic illnesses set in if you isolate someone, despite diet and other lifestyle factors being accounted for.

We are like dolphins or monkeys or lions – pack animals.  We don’t share the same genetic need for isolation like sharks or spiders. This isn’t some kind of philosophical choice or personality you can choose to have.

I’m studying this as part of the topic for my thesis and I’ve discovered that in all cases where someone gives that advice, they have never actually been alone themselves for any extended period of time.

Many times, their idea of being isolated means locking yourself in your bedroom for a couple of hours while your family is in the lounge so you have the option to go and speak to them whenever you wish.

Other examples are going on holiday alone while having family or friends available to call on the phone at any time you wish, or with meet ups planned once every few days. This is not isolation.

Isolation means having no one to talk to for months or years, regardless of whether you want to or not. In today’s day and age, this is more common than people realise. Especially in cities. As part of my studies, I had to follow some people who were truly alone, around a city, and in almost all cases, when they spoke to people, they were often dismissed, or people acted aggressively towards them. I tasked them with speaking to strangers on benches, in cafés, to coffee shop staff, and at bus stops or in the park. I also task them with joining meet up groups that were free to go to, or setting up their own “meet up” “group.

In almost all cases, people were dismissive of them. The online meet up groups were a particular failure, because no one turned up so they were left alone. Quite often these people have unique interests that are deeper than the average person, and so if you force them to go to a meet up among people who are not interested in the same things as them, it leads nowhere.

A lot of these people are middle-aged or older, and the only people interested generally speaking and making friends are younger, but they aren’t interested in making friends with older people. Since older people tend to have families and friends already, they aren’t interested either. What shocked me was how hard it was for even myself to arrange for them to break in into new friendship groups. All of the standard advice online failed. Also, my thinking outside the box failed. This is a far more detailed and difficult problem than people make out.

The best case scenario was when strangers would be polite, but then refused to meet up ever again, so the problem continues. We all need permanent people in our lives, as we come from tribes. Simply talking to polite strangers every day who you never get to know beyond the surface, does not compensate for our need to live with and be around people we know.",2,1759409911.0,Life,0,1.0,False

1nw317u,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nw317u,I Tried My First Flint-Style Coney Dog Thanks to You,"# The Seriously-Unserious Tour de Coney 🌭

Wow. Who would have thought 2 glizzys and a pile of raw onion could [start so much controversy](https://www.reddit.com/r/Michigan/comments/1nmfhxb/today_i_tried_my_first_coney_dog_at_the_original/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)?

I’ve learned that people in the Midwest, especially Michiganders, LOVE their coney dogs, and will defend them until their last breath. But, as someone not from here, I’m learning that there are a LOT of interpretations for what a coney dog is and isn’t. So, it’s my goal to figure out who has the best rendition of a coney dog. 

After visiting Jackson, Michigan last weekend to try the ORIGINAL coney dog (yes, original, like 1914 original), I was less than impressed, and ready to writeoff coneys altogether. That’s when you passionate folks convinced me to give some other coneys a try, specifically from the cities of Flint, Detroit, and (don’t come at me for this one but) Cincinnati. To that end, I took it upon myself to use my glorious Saturday and make the two-hour trip to Flint, Michigan - a city I never thought I’d voluntarily visit.

# John’s Coney Island

This was the [second-most recommended](https://www.reddit.com/r/flint/comments/1nn1fxw/on_a_mission_to_find_the_best_coney_in_mi_and/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) place Flinters suggested. Starlite was by far the fan favorite, but I wanted Starlite to earn that spot. If they were who people said they were, then their coney dog would have to still hit, even after putting a dent in my appetite at John’s Coney Island.

Upon arriving, I was greeted by a giant green sign that said “John’s FAMOUS Coney Island.” Hmm. Famous? I was intrigued, and oddly excited. I couldn’t believe it. What have I become? Driving across the state to eat coneys on my most beloved day of the week?! Who am I? What is this?

As soon as I walked in, I knew that this place, much like Virginia Coney Island in Jackson, was frozen in time. THANK GOD. I don’t want to be surrounded by pop music, new furniture, and cold service. Give me a squeaky booth, patchy artwork, and a server as warm as the coffee. That, my friends, is John’s Coney Island.

I didn’t waste time letting our sweetheart of a server, Sara, know that this was my first time trying a Flint-style coney. I mentioned how I had traveled long and far to get there (1 hour, 97 potholes). She knew I was there for business (not pleasure), and came back with her FINEST coney. Just one coney – *everyone knows the rules.*

**The Coney Dog**

Right away, I gave thanks to the man above that the coney dog I was looking at didn't have that mountain of raw onion that Jackson's did. Can I get an amen to that? Whew, what *was* that? 

First bite. BOOM! The hot dog. Wow. WOW. That’s a damn good hot dog. I said it several times in a row - something came over me. The coney sauce, or whatever you call the meat on the dog, was much better than in Jackson. It was more of a “paste” here than that crumbly, unseasoned, dry meat I had out there. Not chili, but not dry. Somewhere in between.

This coney sauce had a good amount of flavor, but not enough to take from the star of the show: the Koegel hot dog. I liked that. It was immediately clear why you Michiganders have been **anything but quiet** about the Koegel dogs in Flint. I get it now. And I’m sorry I didn’t before. I want to eat 15 of these, preferably while disassociating at a baseball game. (Who’s coming with me?)

**Moment After The Coney**

Some guy overheard us talking about the tour de coney, and walked over to provide his recommendation on the best coney dog in Flint. After he shared it, he was walking away, and without even looking back at us, said, “you can always trust a fat guy,” then he disappeared off in the distance. I didn’t go to his rec.

# Starlite Coney Island

Of course, I somehow went to the wrong location. You know, the one where someone drove-through the drive-thru?… guess they took that too literally...(please clap).

When arriving at the second location, I could tell that this location had some m-o-n-e-y put into it. I don’t like that. If I’m eating a coney, I don’t want to be in a place that feels polished. I want… no… I NEED to feel like a little muscinex gremlin in there. The ugly little green one from the commercials. Somewhere that can match the culinary freak of the food I’m experiencing.

Okay, that's a bit far, but I will say that this place truly felt like somewhere I’d order mimosas and eat an overcooked fried chicken sandwich. Somewhere you'd capture an Instagrammable selfies, and meet up with fellow girlbosses trying to sell their high school ""friends"" weight-loss tea. Oh well. I was there to review coneys. Not vibes.

**The Coney Dog**

First bite. BOOM! And by Boom, I mean SNAP! Literally, it made a “snap” sound when I bit into it. In this exact moment, everything made sense from what my coworker had been saying ALL week, telling me about the “snap” of a coney. I thought he was crazy for using that word to describe food. But because he tagged along for this stop in the coney tour, he saw this realization happen in real time. My very first Koegel snap. A right of passage perhaps.

The hot dog had the same flavor profile as John’s, but was somewhat juicier due to the cooking style. I have to imagine this was cooked on a griddle, allowing the juices to pool inside the unbroken hot dog casing. Each snap of the dog would release the flavors of the Koegel. Kinda cool hot dog tech. John’s, on the other hand, was boiled I think. It still had a good amount of flavor but was snap-less and maybe 5% less flavor in the dog.

The onions were shaved on this dog compared to diced at John’s, which my friends had preferences on. I didn’t seem to care either way. The bun was also better here, maybe it was steamed? Again, marginal difference though. 

The coney sauce at Starlite I am not a fan of it. It tastes, looks, and feels like a sloppy joe more than anything else. At least 80% similarity. I know that will upset some of you to hear, but if I had to guess, they've lost the magic in their coney sauce through the years. Regardless, just like Johns, the coney sauce isn't super forward, and lets the hot dog do the talking. I like that.

# Flint style summary

**Starlite:** 8.7/10 – best dog, ehh coney sauce

**John’s:** 8.6/10 – better coney sauce, the dog got no snap in it!

**Jackson-style coney dogs:** nothing above a 6. (sorry… I do like the wall art in your city though)

Both Flint-style places were good. If I had it my way, I’m getting the hot dog from Starlite, and putting John’s coney sauce on top.

And if you force me to pick one winner, it's John’s. The friendly service and down-to-earth atmosphere would make an 8.6 coney feel like a 9 because of all the endorphins provided by the staff...getting called ""hun"" 10 times will do that. Plus, I'd never feel judged in there. If you get judged at John's, you are really in the wrong brother.

I'm now remembering that I gave the kitchen a wave goodbye and was met with an even friendlier wave back. When I waved at the Starlite kitchen to thank them for lunch, they just kinda looked at me confused as to why I was saying thanks. Like if I were to wave at the McDonald's kitchen or something.

With full confidence (and mild fear for my life), I can say that Flint-style blows Jackson-style out of the water. I guess that makes sense though, seeing as how these Flint coney islands started 50 years after Jackson’s. That’s a lot of time to take what’s existed and make it better. What I do appreciate most about Flint-style is the order of operations. They give 80% weight to the hot dog, and let it be the star of the show. The coney sauce only makes up 15% of the flavor, and the onions, mustard, and bun follow for the last 5%. That’s a good makeup. In Jackson, it was like 35% onion flavor, 35% coney meat, 15% hot dog, and 15% reason to remember the name (I hope you got that reference).

# Flint, you wowed me

My eyes have really been opened to Flint. After the coneys, I went to the planetarium to let the skies above me spin in synchrony with the movement of my bowels. And as amazing as that was (not sarcasm), the art museum after was even better. Both are the second-largest in Michigan, and offer great opportunities for ""off-gassing"" the coneys....just don't let one rip in the dome enclosure of the planetarium, that should be a criminal offense.

All things considered, you (and the fam/friends) should take a weekend to visit Flint, to eat some coneys, see stars, look at art, and have a wonderful day. I slept on this city, and would go back if given the chance. Just be mindful of the rougher areas, and try to avoid going at night if possible. Other than that, you should be fine.

Thanks for having for me Flint, and thanks for reading!

with that said, i’ve partnered up with my friends at wayward coffee co in the dallas design district to host my first official pop-up dinner!

centred around the day of the dead, the menu will be a blend of traditional mexican ingredients and techniques with my modern take on vietnamese flavours. 9 courses, 12-seat chef’s counter, super intimate, complimentary cocktail to start and mezcal to finish.

an altar will also be setup, encouraging our guests to bring and share photos of their loved ones who have passed.

it’s guaranteed to be a night of fun! i hope to see y’all there! spots are filling up quick so be sure to book soon ❤️

I randomly picked up a used vintage Iberital Express at the weekend. It's a semi-automatic coffee machine with a built in grinder. It's apparently at least 15 years old but it's pretty heavy & feels solid/well built & has two unpressurised portafilter baskets, and a nice solid portafilter with a built in tamp and a nice steam wand. Looks like a precursor to the Sage Barista Express / Delonghi Specialista style of machine but with a hint of Gaggia Classic in the simplicity and chunky switches / build quality.

Haven't had time to play with it yet but haven't heard of this model before and I couldn't find any online reviews or much info about it - although I have heard of the Iberital MC2 grinder....obviously...!

I'm curious to know if this machine also has a good reputation? Anyone have the manual (although it looks pretty simple to use)? Any thoughts? Looking forward to having a play with it when I get a chance! NB I haven't even figured out if it has a boiler/thermal block yet or what type of grinder it has. I don't even know if it's working!

I am 29/M that got into some serious debt from my untreated Bipolar Disorder ($21,500 credit card debt). Here is how I am currently fixing it without bankruptcy and on $2400/month income after taxes:

1) Moved home with parents- I know it's not available to everyone but if you have the opportunity to take advantage of it
2) Minimal spending- try to cut costs wherever you can: pack a lunch, make pots of coffee at home, cut utilities like phone bills
3) Pay highest interest rate first while also making minimums on all your debt- Pay down that 28% card over the 15% loan or 8% car payment, allocation is key to minimize interest paid
4) Take out lower interest personal loan- 28-30% on cc debt is unpayable in all honesty. I have a CITI card that allows flex loans, which are 10-15% that use the available balance on your credit card as how much you can take out; used it to pay consolidate it to one account
5) See a psychologist- debt can seem like you're in a tunnel that never ends and speaking to someone regarding your struggles can help you push through to the end and lessens the depressive episodes where you might ""give up"" and relapse spending

With my dad, things were complicated. Him and my mother were both abusive so we hadn’t talked for about the last decade. Posthumously, I learned he was also being abused by my mother, which honestly explains a lot of things. He had fallen off a chair and broke a bone, apparently the cancer was in the bone (which is why it broke from being so brittle) and the cancer rapidly spread. My mother didn’t allow him to receive any kind of healthcare outside of seeing the chiropractor, so he didn’t know. I was informed the day after his passing for various reasons, but see, not having contact with your family kinda does that to ya.

Then, last night, my grandfather in law passed away. He was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer back in late April of this year. On the 24th of last month I got a message saying he was in bad shape and his platelets and blood were bottomed out as well as he had an infection. He is a stubborn man and he fought to the death. I saw someone here’s say something along the lines of when you die with cancer, the cancer dies with you, so technically it’s a draw ;) I like that. He’d definitely make some dumb joke about it. 

Everyone always says “cancer fucking sucks” and well, yeah. The older you get, the more likely something goes wrong and… it’s just not fair. *Life* isn’t fair, as my dad used to say all the damn time. One thing is, though: the end of it. Everybody dies,

1nw2rjk,https://i.redd.it/y7xzyxzg2psf1.jpeg,Cereja Fermentada - torrefação Moinho de Ouro.,"Olá, espero encontrá-los bem!

Chegaram ontem os cafés da compra coletiva de meio de mês do DDUCL. Comprei apenas 2, mas hoje o foco é para esse cereja fermentado. É o meu primeiro contato com um café fermentado e, meus amigos, estou impressionado!

Como todo coffee lover ansioso, já fiz ele ontem, assim que chegou. No entanto, nesse meu primeiro contato com o café, acabei errando a receita e ele saiu um pouco amargo demais (estou de férias e aqui na casa dos meus pais não tem uma balança muito boa).

Hoje, mais atento, fiz minha receita padrão no V60: 15g de café, 240g de água (1:16) em 3 despejos, mas subi 2 clicks no moedor, um KINGrinder P2, (indo para o 64). Usei uma água filtrada mesmo, que fervi e esperei por volta de 1min e meio para usar.

O resultado foi surpreendente, as notas de frutas vermelhas tomaram conta do paladar e ficou sensacional! A acidez ficou controlada com o dulçor e o amargor desapareceu. Acho que esse foi o café que tomei pela manhã que mais me deixou ansioso pelo café da tarde kkkkkkkkk (é uma coisa bem frequente por aqui).

Sobre o café, trata-se de um Catucaí fermentado da região das Matas de Minas (não tenho mais informações que isso) com torra média.

Enfim, deixo aqui o meu relato sobre o café. Uma boa xícara (ou caneca) a todos!",3,1759409108.0,cafebrasil,0,0.81,False

1nw2oke,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuallesbians/comments/1nw2oke/long_story_ahead_sharing_how_i_fell_in_love/,⚠️LONG STORY AHEAD: Sharing How I Fell In Love!,"For my story, it kinda sounds like the typical plot you will see in those dramas.

In my uni, I'm an outgoing girl who was part of the school beach volleyball team. Naturally, with this extrovert personality, I've met a lot of people my whole life and became friends with them in my university, but that also brought me some jealousy from some schoolmates who didn't like me.

There was this girl in my class who liked a boy but she misunderstood my friendship with that boy and thought I had feelings for him. I have absolutely no feelings for this boy and I see him as one of my good friends cuz I have known him for 2 years back then, plus I'M A LESBIAN, I LOVE GIRLSSSS! Me and the boy had clearly told her that we are just friends but she couldn't believe it so her friend group ( consists of 6 girls) decided to pick on me and started to physically bully me, like deliberately pushing or elbowing me, making fun of my English etc. Everyone saw a problem and tried defending me, but I always lied and told them that there's nothing going on, as I believe that if I took a step back, I can reconcile with them. I always wanted to befriend everyone, but things didn't seem to be working out.

During Valentine's day, I received a bouquet of flowers from a boy I didn't know. These girls saw it, and thought it was from the guy friend. Obviously that pissed the girl off, with that she and her friend group dumped the flowers ( till this day i still dk who gave it to me lol) into the garbage and started warning and threatening me to stay away from that boy or else I would suffer the consequences. I wish I could tell them I'm sapphic but I'm from a country where LGBT is illegal so I can't be sharing this publicly, but people close to me do know.

As I didn't care about the threats threw at me by those girls, I continued being friends with the boy, and I remember one day before my beach volleyball training, those girls happened to come to the same bathroom as me while I was getting prepared to change, and they started cornering me and started throwing harsh words at me, calling me a slut for ""whoring"" around different people ( I was just friends with people, and I never initiated or led people on romantically) . Eventually, words became physical actions, they started pulling my hair, tearing my shirt, I was defending and trying to protect myself but to no avail as they had multiple people on me, and halfway through my shirt was torn apart, and my skin was exposed. I remembered that day clearly I was wearing a CK underwear set, and when these girls saw my skin, they started to body shame me as I have relatively bigger bust compared to teens around me, and they started calling me a vixen and slut for trying to seduce the people they like. I was crying because not only was my body exposed, but I was getting accused on things that I have never even thought about, let alone that I would have no clothes to wear home (my beach volleyball outfit is the type of sports bra + bikini bottoms, similar to those female beach volleyball pro wears).

When things seemed to get worse, she came in. My heroine, my knight came in. She heard the noise outside as she was entering to get changed too. Apparently, she's the new senior who joined the beach volleyball team and was preparing for her first training session too. The moment she came in, she saw a few girls cornering me, and she immediately helped me out. She was taller than me and the group of the girls by 7-8cm ish, and she bluffed that as our senior, she has deep connections with teachers and warned those girls that if they don't want any trouble, they should leave now. The girls were intimidated and left. The senior helped me up, asked if I was okay and asked if I needed to report to the school authority. I told her there's no need and I just wanted to get change and join the training session before I was late. I tried to act like nothing happened.

She told me that she's also joining the training session, so we decided to get changed and joined later. We had an ice-breaking session and I got to learn more bout her, she was outgoing like me too, cracked some jokes and connected to the team almost immediately. I was admired by the way she spoke and the charisma that she radiated, and most importantly, I was grateful for how righteous she was, getting me out of trouble instead of letting things happen. She offered to pair up with me in training drills, and I realize I couldn't get my eyes off her. She was tall, fairly tanned and from her muscles I could tell she had been raising those weighs routinely in the gym. She was beautiful too with that dark straight hair tied in ponytail. She was super good at beach volleyball too, coach was impressed by her display and instructed her to guide us. She realized I had some improvements to be made and walked across the court, stood behind me, and held my hands gently, guiding me the position to receive the ball more steadily. That moment I could feel my heart pulsing tremendously. Was it love, or was I just grateful and touched by how she had helped me throughout the whole day? I honestly had no idea.

After the session, we got changed and she saw my torn shirt and offered me her hoodie to cover myself up. After that, we went to this coffee shop near campus and started learning about each other more, and I confided to her the entire clash between me and the group of girls. I started crying as I opened up and what she said that day to me, still engraved in my brain: ""Don't cry, I'm here, I will protect you, if those girls come after you again, just text or call me, I will always help you out."" I was soothed and those words hit the soft spot of my heart, and my feelings for her increased more, but still, I couldn't tell if I was in love with her romantically or liked her as a friend, nor could I tell if she had feelings for me, or this is just her innate of helping out people.

After that day, we slowly became each other close friends, we attend training session, she helped me on improving my volleyball skills, I helped her wrap around some IT-related modules. We were friends, we were each other's mental support too. There was a time when her grandma passed away and she was severely down for weeks as her grandma nurtured her and was a vital part of her life. The girls tried to harass me, but she was always there for me, shielding me from the toxicity which she deemed that I didn't deserve to receive. We got closer and intimate to each other, hanging out with our friend groups and having sleepover from time to time. Though there was a secret I didn't tell her, I figured out what has been troubling me inside, and I realized that I was in love with this woman, who's such a charismatic leader, responsible woman, and most importantly, kind and caring innately for everyone. I fell in love with the latter part. I was loved and attracted by the kindness and love she has for everyone, it's not only for me and her family and friends, but for the strangers she encounters in her daily life, always offering help proactively even if others didn't ask. 

I didn't tell her I was a lesbian, neither did she. We had known each other for a year, sometimes she would throw some flirty and cheesy comments and compliments on me, but I always took it as a joke, or though deep down I wished she meant it seriously. I was hurt by my last relationship too much that I thought I lost the ability and courage to love someone and I'm afraid to fall in a one-sided relationship ( I will get into that one day if possible). 

The watershed happened on a quite normal volleyball training session. It was a private training we decided to conduct as coach had paired us up for a upcoming in-campus beach volleyball tournament. We went to this beach and started having some drills and focused on some coordination practice. I'm not ashamed to admit it, but she looked super hot when she played volleyball, especially with the bikini she's wearing ( she always look hot no matter what bikini or outfit she wear , I'm a hopeless romantic xd). Suddenly, there was a lady who was swimming and had a cramp and it was obvious that the lady needed help. Without hesitation, she galloped across the shore and jumped into the waters and started swimming towards the lady and pulled her to safety ( she's a very good swimmer, please don't do this if you are not an expert in swimming). I stood there watching and praying that nothing goes wrong for both her and the lady. Thank god, they made it back to the shore and the lady was not injured. I stood there watching her do everything in awe, and my heart just pulsed faster, caused by a mix of nervousness for her safety and deep admiration of her brave and heroic behavior. It brought my memories back to a year ago when she helped me in that bathroom, scenes started to flood in and emerge vividly in my brain, but this time, I know I'm safe with her, because of her, and still, she helped strangers who I once was to her out of peril. At that moment, I knew that, she's the woman I love, and I desperately want to spend my golden age with, and get married.

After she ensured that the lady was fine, she got back to me, body soaked with the salty sea water, I was already holding a tower waiting for her. Instead of taking the tower from me, she decided to flirt with me and asked if I was gonna be her fangirl after that. In my mind, I was like ""I want to be your girlfriend!!! ARGHHHHH"", and she even gave me quick kiss on my cheek. My brain overloaded at that moment. That night, my brain just kept replaying the whole event that occurred.

Due to her also extrovert personality similar to mine, she had many friends too in uni, and that also comes along with boys who fell in love with her charisma, I don't blame them tbh, because I did too. She turned down all of them, same goes to me, who turned down those guys too. We always joked and questioned each other if both of us are lesbians because of the rejection towards our pursuers. I wished I could tell her I'm a lesbian, but I'm also afraid of ruining this strong bond we have. At some moment, I had the thought of just love her secretly, at least that means that we could be lifelong friends.

Everything changed during Christmas Eve. We went out to karaoke with bunch of our friends. After that, her mum invited my family over for dinner. We made food together in the kitchen, set up the dining table and started eating and discussing about things. We prepared gifts for each other too, I got her this Dyson hairdryer she always wanted, and when I was about to exchange gifts with her, she said she had something important to say. I was like ""ohhh she's gonna give a toast"", but my sixth sense told me something was odd when I saw the face of her parents and siblings and even on my little brother.

She started the toast with expressing her gratitude towards her family, then to my parents who always welcomed her to our house and prepare food and ensure that she felt like home when she came over, and lastly the topic was directed to me. She first recalled and talked about the first time we met, I was shocked as I never told my parents about what happened to me in that bathroom, so I tried to change the topic but my mum just told me to calm down and listened to what she has to offer.

She then reminisced about the good ol' memory we had in uni, and I slowly started to sense that this speech was heading somewhere else. She confessed! She told me the countless moment that she felt so safe and naturally happy with me, everything was lightweight when we spent time together according to her, she felt that she can be herself with me, showing the cheeky, mischievous side with me. She felt that I'm the person who always pushes her to be better in life, whether academically or mentally. She also sensed that I had feelings for her through those small yet meaningful things I have done for her, like the encouragement and motivation when she thought she's not good enough, the patience I had when I consoled her and stuck by her side when her grandma passed away. All of this added up and meant a lot to her.

I asked her 2 vital questions. First, I DIDNT KNOW SHE WAS SAPPHIC. Turns out SHE WAS the WHOLE TIME. I just never asked cause I was afraid, afraid of losing everything we had. She didn't know I was sapphic too till that beach training session we had which she saved the lady from drowning. She saw me staring tentatively at her, this assured her that I was like her, sapphic and in love with her. That's why she decided to GIVE ME THAT KISS and when she saw me red like cherry and obviously suffering from a brain-overload. ""I love you, I want to grow up with you, through troubles and happiness like we had always been, will you be my girlfriend?"" I couldn't answer her as tears streamed down from my eyes, blurring my vision dripping down to my cheeks, but I nodded and she just hugged me tightly, as if she's afraid of losing me. I can feel her tears wetting my top too.

Everyone present was happy for us. Apparently everyone knew this confession was going to happen, both our parents knew as she told them beforehand, and wanted them to keep it a secret until that night. She even told my parents about the bullying incident and my parents was very grateful for her courageous act and loved her for it. Through this, they knew, this woman is my destined lover, and my parents supported us to be together. On the other hand, her parents loved how I always pushed her to be better, and they can see the improvements in their own daughter, hence they absolutely wanted us to get together too. I guess they called this ""mutualism"" in biology. Our parents knew we are sapphic so they were perfectly fine with their daughters being in a beautiful and beneficial wlw relationship.

That night, I stayed over, I asked her tons of questions, the details of her falling in love, and everything we did made sense to both of us. We realised that the joke we pulled on each other when we rejected the boys aren't a joke, but something true. 

After all the confession, the secrets started being revealed and we removed the mask we have hidden behind for a long time, same goes to our garments. Fingers ran through each other hair and tender cheeks, our lips landed on each other neck and collarbone. Nothing unusual that we always saw each other in bikinis during beach volleyball training sessions, but that night, that last piece of lingerie covering our privates were removed, we enjoyed every bit of each other's body, falling into temptations uncontrollably. The hugs, the kisses, the fingers and tongue enjoying every bit of each other's boobs and vagina, everything was done with fervent passion. Before we got deeper into things, she asked if I will still be wet after crying so much since the confession she made at the table, soon she would realise she had a rather sensitive girlfriend who would bring her troubles of changing her mattress every time as I squirt even with the lightest touch on my genitals.

The tears is composed of salty water, but under that superficial level, it was the hardships, the hidden love, the fear of losing each other, but as the cliche saying goes, ""love is powerful and you can do anything with love. Dont be afraid of loving, always believe in the strength of love.""

My MacBook Pro is dead from an unfortunate coffee incident. I’m not too upset because it was old and starting to annoy me anyway. 
I’m good about backing up:  to the cloud, and once a month to a terabyte hard drive. Here’s the thing though - when I set up my backups I’m not sure what exact options I set, so if I set up my new computer to restore from backup I’m not sure which to use. I’m leaning towards the hard drive because I think that has absolutely everything (since it’s bigger than the hard drive on my old computer), vs the cloud where I might have omitted things (like photos) to avoid paying for extra storage. So any advice would be appreciated. 
Bonus question:  I’m going to swing by Costco today and buy it there unless anyone thinks that’s a bad idea.

1nw2h1z,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_erepresent/comments/1nw2h1z/how_to_play_solitaire_online_without_any/,How to Play Solitaire Online Without Any Distractions,"Solitaire is a classic card game that offers a perfect mix of relaxation and mental challenge. In today’s fast-paced, distraction-filled world, it can be difficult to fully immerse yourself in such an engaging game. However, playing Solitaire online can be an enjoyable and calming experience if you take the right steps to avoid interruptions. Here are some useful tips to help you play Solitaire online without any distractions.

**1. Choose the Right Environment**

To fully focus on your game, make sure you’re playing in a quiet space. Whether it's a corner of your home, a cozy coffee shop, or a peaceful library, choosing a calm environment can significantly reduce the chances of distractions. Ensure that you are comfortable and free from unnecessary noise, as external factors can easily disrupt your concentration.

**2. Set Your Device to ‘Do Not Disturb’ Mode**

One of the biggest distractions while playing Solitaire online is notifications. Whether it’s a text message, an email, or a social media alert, these constant interruptions can break your focus. Most devices have a “Do Not Disturb” feature that silences all incoming notifications. Activating this feature can provide you with an uninterrupted session to focus solely on your game.

**3. Eliminate Digital Clutter**

Before starting your Solitaire game, close any irrelevant tabs or apps running on your device. The fewer distractions you have, the easier it will be to stay in the zone. If you're playing on a computer, try using full-screen mode so that only the game is visible, and you're not tempted to glance at other things.

**4. Set Time Limits for Breaks**

Taking breaks can be healthy, but setting a specific time for them can prevent distractions from going on longer than necessary. Set an alarm or timer to remind you when it's time for a break, and stick to it. This helps in maintaining a good balance between uninterrupted gameplay and well-deserved relaxation.

**5. Focus on Mindful Play**

To play Solitaire online without distractions, it’s crucial to practice mindfulness. Focus on the mechanics of the game—the shuffling of cards, the thrill of completing a column, and the satisfaction of a well-played strategy. By immersing yourself in the process, you’re less likely to get distracted by external factors.

**6. Play During Quiet Hours**

Timing can also be key. Play Solitaire online during quieter hours, such as early in the morning or late at night, when there are fewer interruptions around you. This will help you enjoy a more peaceful and focused experience.

In conclusion, creating an optimal environment, setting your device to avoid interruptions, and focusing on the game are simple but effective ways to ensure a distraction-free Solitaire session. If you’re looking for a calming break or a way to sharpen your mind, these strategies will help you play Solitaire online without distractions, ensuring you get the most out of every game.",1,1759408316.0,u_erepresent,0,1.0,False

Granted sometimes I just remain quiet throughout the day at work and other places. I like speaking to others but sometimes I just prefer to be quiet, especially on days where I feel mentally drained. 

I get being quiet and not sharing makes me look a bit weird to others. People feel uncomfortable around really quiet people, humans are very sociable talkative creatures so I get the strangeness other people may feel around someone so quiet.
But even though I'm smiling they do it, I don't know if I'm smiling at the wrong times or what. 

I'm probably acting weird and really awkward at the time idk, I can't help that. Regardless even if I'm not I can get that look. 
Or I say something I think is perfectly normal and maybe quite funny and people respond like I'm being stupid or they just look confused or uncomfortable. They sometimes give me that look regardless of me being really quiet or not.

I'm saying all this because I've started a new job. It's a great place with such lovely people working there. The problem is I keep making a fool of myself and acting weird. I'm feeling tired and dizzy because I had too much coffee today and have just gone into the non talking non interacting mode and when I speak I sound quite flat and uninterested which isn't how I feel so I'm worse today than other days this week. I want to interact but the barrier is up and a part of me just doesn't want to and can't interact properly. I'm finding it difficult to smile too. 

It's incredibly annoying, I want to be more sociable but my mind just wont let me and is keeping me in an unsociable state.
I've gotten into this state a fair few times in my life, I go in and out. I can be sociable, smiley and things, though holding conversations have always been challenging to me and the whole thing takes up so much energy. 

I think I know what's causing this. I'm just too tired I think, I have a few worries that are taking over, my colleagues keep on changing their working schedule as they all work part time which keeps throwing me off and annoys me. I need to just get used to who works when, that should be fine soon. 
I feel uncomfortable today, I got sweaty from the walk to work this morning and my hair's a mess. It's poofed up and gone frizzy and is right there in my face. Feeling uncomfortable or not clean etc always makes me shut down slightly, the barrier comes up.

It doesn't help that I just came back from a trip to the US with my husband. Everything was completely new and I was around and had to socialise with my sister and brother in law constantly. There was no privacy. It was a great time and I wish I could go back but it took its toll. 

Sorry about the long ramblings here, I just need to vent. Things are brilliant in my life I'm just getting a bit overwhelmed. I'm used to the strange uncomfortable look people give me. I've experienced it throughout my life but it's annoying seeing it everyday. I know I can get out of my disengagement and lack of masking uncomfortable state but I'm finding it hard to do so at the moment. Anyway, as said just wanted to vent.

1nw2f4s,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nw2f4s,Hunyuan 3.0 image comparison repost with larger images,"Hi all,

Another test I made, with no scientific pretense! Sorry for the double post, the original with several Qwen image was too difficult to see.

Admittedly, Qwen is even more at a disavantage in this test because I used the FP8 model, but then on the platform HY's resolution is limited to 1 megapixel.

I generated an idea of an image and asked a LLM to elaborate a prompt about it (so my lack of fluency with English won't trouble the model). I'll provide the list of prompts below, with some commentary on the result.

In the accompagnying images, I cherry-picked the Hunyuan result (out of the 2 generated on the official website, since I don't have a B200 lying around at home) but generated 8 random Qwen results. With the limitation on images posted in a single thread, I can't do more but I'll be happy to provide the full resolution version of some of them.

This comparison isn't meant to be applicable to anyone's use case, especially when it comes to assessing if it's worth renting a top-level runpod to run it, but it may help show some differences between the newcomer and the current star.

  
TL;DR: there is a significant increase in prompt adherence with the very large model, possibly SOTA. The gain in aesthetics seems narrower. At the end of this experiment, I am convinced that Hunyuan is better at following drawing instructions than any other open weight models released, and has a niche, even if this niche is private cloud based generation. 

  


**Prompt #1: It's a reasoning model... the classroom**

First, I wanted to illustrate why the HY model is huge: it doesn't do only image generation but also understanding. It should be better at it than image-only model. I asked for:

""A classroom filled with students, each holding up a small chalkboard with their answer to the equation x-7=5 written on it. The teacher is visible from behind, facing the students.""

Hunyuan produced slates with actual results, while Qwen was expectedly limited to working with what was in the prompt. But Qwen also had a probem with the orientation of the children and slates in many cases.

**Prompt 2: the cyberpunk selfie**

""A hyper-detailed, cinematic close-up selfie shot in a cyberpunk megacity environment, framed as if taken with a futuristic augmented-reality smartphone. The composition is tight on three young adults—two women and one man—posing together at arm’s length, their faces illuminated by the neon chaos of the city. The photo should feel gritty, futuristic, and authentic, with ultra-sharp focus on the faces, intricate skin textures, reflections of neon lights, cybernetic implants, and the faint atmospheric haze of rain-damp air. The background should be blurred with bokeh from glowing neon billboards, holograms, and flickering advertisements in colors like electric blue, magenta, and acid green.

The first girl, on the left, has warm bronze skin with micro-circuit tattoos faintly glowing along her jawline and temples, like embedded circuitry under the skin. Her eyes are hazel, enhanced with subtle digital overlays, tiny lines of data shimmering across her irises when the light catches them. Her hair is thick, black, and streaked with neon blue highlights, shaved at one side to reveal a chrome-plated neural jack. Her lips curve into a wide smile, showing a small gold tooth cap that reflects the neon light. The faint glint of augmented reality lenses sits over her pupils, giving her gaze a futuristic intensity.

The second girl, on the right, has pale porcelain skin with freckles, though some are replaced with delicate clusters of glowing nano-LEDs arranged like constellations across her cheeks. Her face is angular, with sharp cheekbones accentuated by the high-contrast neon lighting. She has emerald-green cybernetic eyes, with a faint circular HUD visible inside, and a subtle lens flare effect in the pupils. Her lips are painted matte black, and a silver septum ring gleams under violet neon light. Her hair is platinum blonde with iridescent streaks, straight and flowing, with strands reflecting holographic advertisements around them. She tilts her head toward the lens with a half-smile that looks playful yet dangerous, her gaze almost predatory.

The man, in the center and slightly behind them, has tan skin with a faint metallic sheen at the edges of his jaw where cybernetic plating meets flesh. His steel-gray eyes glow faintly with artificial enhancement, thin veins of light radiating outward like cracks of electricity. A faint scar cuts across his left eyebrow, but it is partially reinforced with a chrome implant. His lips form a confident smirk, a thin trail of smoke curling upward from the glowing tip of a cyber-cig between his fingers. His hair is short, spiked with streaks of neon purple, slightly wet from the drizzle. He wears a black jacket lined with faintly glowing circuitry that pulses like veins of light across his collar.

The lighting is moody and saturated with neon: electric pinks, blues, and greens paint their faces in dynamic contrasts. Droplets of rain cling to their skin and hair, catching the neon glow like tiny prisms. Reflections of holographic ads shimmer in their eyes. Subtle lens distortion from the selfie framing makes the faces slightly exaggerated at the edges, adding realism.

The mood is rebellious, electric, and hyper-modern, blending candid warmth with the raw edge of a cyberpunk dystopia. Despite the advanced tech, the moment feels intimate: three friends, united in a neon-drenched world of chaos, capturing a fleeting instant of humanity amidst the synthetic glow.""

While this prompt was expectedly too difficult for both models, Hunyuan got a lot of the right (the shaved area and piercing for the left girl, the cigarette on the man, the localized freckles on the right girl) or closer (the hair). While several of them were missed by model, like eyes, I feel Hunyuan is closer than Qwen on this one.

**Prompt #3: the renaissance technosaint**

""A grand Renaissance-style oil painting, as if created by a master such as Caravaggio or Raphael, depicting an unexpected modern subject: a hacker wearing a VR headset, portrayed with the solemn majesty of a religious figure. The painting is composed with a dramatic chiaroscuro effect: deep shadows dominate the background while radiant golden light floods the central figure, symbolizing revelation and divine inspiration.

The hacker sits at the center of the canvas in three-quarter view, clad in simple dark clothing that contrasts with the rich fabric folds often seen in Renaissance portraits. His hands are placed reverently on an open laptop that resembles an illuminated manuscript. His head is bowed slightly forward, as if in deep contemplation, but his face is obscured by a sleek black VR headset, which gleams with reflected highlights. Despite its modernity, the headset is rendered with the same meticulous brushwork as a polished chalice or crown in a sacred altarpiece.

Around the hacker’s head shines a halo of golden light, painted in radiant concentric circles, recalling the divine aureoles of saints. This halo is not traditional but fractured, with angular shards of digital code glowing faintly within the gold, blending Renaissance piety with cybernetic abstraction. The golden light pours downward, illuminating his hands and casting luminous streaks across his laptop, making the device itself appear like a holy relic.

The background is dark and architectural, suggesting the stone arches of a cathedral interior, half-lost in shadow. Columns rise in the gloom, while faint silhouettes of angels or allegorical figures appear in the corners, holding scrolls that morph into glowing data streams. The palette is warm and rich: ochres, umbers, deep carmines, and the brilliant gold of divine illumination. Subtle cracks in the painted surface give it the patina of age, as if this sacred image has hung in a chapel for centuries.

The style should be authentically Renaissance: textured oil brushstrokes, balanced composition, dramatic use of light and shadow, naturalistic anatomy. Every detail of fabric, skin, and light is rendered with reverence, as though this hacker is a prophet of the digital age. The VR headset, laptop, and digital motifs are integrated seamlessly into the sacred iconography, creating an intentional tension between the ancient style and the modern subject.

The mood is sublime, reverent, and paradoxical: a celebration of knowledge and vision, as if technology itself has become a vessel of divine enlightenment. It should feel both anachronistic and harmonious, a painting that could hang in a Renaissance chapel yet unmistakably belongs to the cyber age.""

Then again, a lot of misses, especially when it comes to the style, but Hunyuan gets closer when it comes to the number of details taken into account.

**Prompt #4: mixing photorealistic and cartoony**

""A hyper-realistic, photographic depiction of a luxurious Parisian penthouse living room at night, captured in sharp detail with cinematic lighting. The space is ultra-modern, sleek, and stylish, with floor-to-ceiling glass windows that stretch the entire wall, overlooking the glittering Paris skyline. The Eiffel Tower glows in the distance, its lights shimmering against the night sky. The interior design is minimalist yet opulent: polished marble floors, a low-profile Italian leather sofa in charcoal gray, a glass coffee table with chrome legs, and a suspended designer fireplace with a soft orange flame casting warm reflections across the room. Subtle decorative accents—abstract sculptures, high-end books, and a large contemporary rug in muted tones—anchor the aesthetic.

Into this elegant, hyperrealistic scene intrudes something utterly fantastical and deliberately out of place: a cartoonish, classic Santa Claus sneaking across the room on tiptoe. He is rendered in a vintage 1940s–1950s cartoon style, with exaggerated rounded proportions, oversized boots, bright red suit, comically bulging belly, fluffy white beard, and a sack of toys slung over his back. His expression is mischievous yet playful, eyes wide and darting as if he’s been caught in the act. His red suit has bold, flat shading and thick black outlines, making him look undeniably drawn rather than photographed.

The contrast between the realistic environment and the cartoony Santa is striking: the polished marble reflects the glow of the fireplace realistically, while Santa casts a simple, flat, 2D-style shadow that doesn’t quite match the physical lighting, enhancing the surreal ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" effect. His hotte (sack of toys) bounces with exaggerated squash-and-stretch animation style, defying the stillness of the photorealistic room.

Through the towering glass windows behind him, another whimsical element appears: Santa’s sleigh hovering in mid-air, rendered in the same vintage cartoon style as Santa. The sleigh is pulled by reindeer that flap comically oversized hooves, frozen mid-leap in exaggerated poses, with little puffs of animated smoke trailing behind them. The glowing neon of Paris reflects off the glass, mixing realistically with the flat, cel-shaded cartoon outlines of the sleigh, heightening the uncanny blend of real and drawn worlds.

The overall mood is playful and surreal, balancing luxury and absurdity. The image should feel like a carefully staged photograph of a high-end penthouse, interrupted by a cartoon character stepping right into reality. The style contrast must be emphasized: photographic realism in the architecture, textures, and city view, versus cartoon simplicity in Santa and his sleigh. This juxtaposition should create a whimsical tension, evoking the exact “Roger Rabbit effect”: two incompatible realities colliding in one frame, yet blending seamlessly into a single narrative moment.""

Here we get Hunyuy who was unable to draw Santa Claus vehicle without Santa Claus itself, which is a big mistake. Qwen got it right half of the time. But the instruction about details are then again in favour of HY, like reflections and so on. Models used to have a hard time doing reflection, now they have trouble when we ask them not to put them where they should. Qwen does a much better Parisian skyline than Hunyuan, though.

**Prompt #5: the space station**

""A giant space station drifting in the void, designed with a mixture of futuristic architecture and retro sci-fi aesthetics. The overall shape is elongated and asymmetrical, with a huge central dome dominating the upper surface. The dome is made of multiple hexagonal glass panels, glowing softly in shades of green and turquoise, giving the impression of a crystalline turtle shell set into the metallic hull.

Around the dome, the station expands outward into broad mechanical platforms and clusters of interconnected modules. These structures are heavily detailed with engine blocks, exhaust vents, antenna arrays, docking bays, and mechanical scaffolding. Some sections look like enormous ventilation grids or cooling systems, with dark rectangular openings. The metal surfaces are mostly silver and gray, with subtle hints of violet and blue, accented by scattered red and yellow lights.

At the station’s edges, several branch-like arms extend outward, ending in spherical or circular constructions resembling observation pods or secondary control stations. Tubes and conduits snake across the hull, linking different sectors together. Small auxiliary spacecraft and shuttles can be imagined buzzing around the structure, emphasizing its immense scale.

The overall design combines smooth curved surfaces with hard angular machinery, producing a look that is both organic and mechanical. The central dome feels serene and geometric, while the surrounding machinery bristles with complexity and technical detail.

The background is the blackness of deep space, punctuated by bright stars, scattered planets, and colorful nebula clouds. Shades of blue and indigo swirl faintly behind the station, contrasting with the cold gray metal and the green glow of the dome.

The visual style should be sharp, clean, and vibrant, with bold outlines and saturated colors, giving the station a crisp, iconic silhouette. The scene conveys a mood of cosmic adventure and mystery, as though the station is both a fortress and a sanctuary drifting among the stars.""

Two very different styles, and I feel Qwen misses the complexity mark on this one.

**Prompt #5: the mad scientist and his captive**

""A dark, cinematic laboratory interior filled with strange machinery and glowing chemical tanks. At the center of the composition stands a large transparent glass cage, reinforced with metallic frames and covered in faint reflections of flickering overhead lights. Inside the cage is a young blonde woman serving as a test subject from a zombification expermient. Her hair is shoulder-length, messy, and illuminated by the eerie light of the environment. She wears a simple, pale hospital-style gown, clinging slightly to her figure in the damp atmosphere. Her face is partly visible but blurred through the haze, showing a mixture of fear and resignation.

From nozzles built into the walls of the cage, a dense green gas hisses and pours out, swirling like toxic smoke. The gas quickly fills the enclosure, its luminescent glow obscuring most of the details inside. Only fragments of the woman’s silhouette are visible through the haze: the outline of her raised hands pressed against the glass, the curve of her shoulders, the pale strands of hair floating in the mist. The gas is so thick it seems to radiate outward, tinting the entire scene in sickly green tones.

Outside the cage, in the foreground, stands a mad scientist. He has an eccentric, unkempt appearance: wild, frizzy gray hair sticking in all directions, a long lab coat stained with chemicals, and small round glasses reflecting the glow of the cage. His expression is maniacally focused, a grin half-hidden as he scribbles furiously into a leather-bound notebook. The notebook is filled with incomprehensible diagrams and notes, his pen moving fast as if documenting every second of the experiment. One hand holds the notebook against his hip, while the other moves quickly, writing with obsessive energy.

The laboratory itself is cluttered and chaotic: wires snake across the floor, glass beakers bubble with strange liquids, and metallic instruments hum with faint vibrations. The lighting is dramatic, mostly coming from the cage itself and the glowing gas, creating sharp shadows and streaks of green reflected on the scientist’s glasses and lab coat.

The atmosphere is oppressive and heavy, like a scene from a gothic science-fiction horror film. The key effect is the visual contrast: the young woman’s fragile form almost lost in the swirling toxic mist, versus the sharp, manic figure of the scientist calmly taking notes as if this cruelty is nothing more than data collection.

The overall mood: unsettling, surreal, and cinematic—a blend of realism and nightmarish exaggeration, with the gas obscuring most details, making the viewer struggle to see clearly what happens within the glass cage.""

While it's far from perfect, notably with the glowing glasses of the mad scientist instead of just reflecting a subtle glow, HY gets most of the details right.... except that Qwen misses more, notably by not getting the reanimating gas kept inside the glass cage, and the victim look more combative than zombified.

**Prompt #6 : the slasher movie VHS cover**

""A cinematic horror movie poster in 1980s slasher style, set in a dark urban alley lit by a single flickering neon sign. In the forefront, a teenage girl in retro-mirror skates looks, freeze mid-motion, her eyes wide mouth and open in a scream. Her outfit is colorful and vintage: striped knee socks, denim shorts, and a T-shirt with bold 80s print. She is dramatically backlit, casting a long shadow across the wet pavement. Towering behind her is the silhouette of a masked killer, wearing a grimy hockey mask that hides his face completely. He wields a long gleaming samurai sword, raised menacingly, the blade catching the light, impaling the girl. On both side of the girl, the wound gushes with blood. The killer's body language is threatening and powerful, while the girl's posture conveys shock and helplessness. The entire composition feels like a horror movie still: mist curling around the street, neon reflections in puddles, posters peeling from walls brick. The colors are highly saturated in 80s horror style — neon pinks, blood reds, sickly greens. At the bottom of the image, bold block letters spell out a fake horror movie title, though this was a vintage VHS cover.""

I won't diss Qwen for the title of the VHS cover, because the full model does better with letters generally, so it can't really be blamed. But it seems to have refused to actually kill the girl. HY doesn't want to show her impaled either. I had to modify the prompt myself because ChatGPT told me that including blood in the description would turn this description into a forbidden topic for ""obvious ethical and safety concern"". Teen slashers movie are probably not a thing in America.

**Prompt #7: the naval battle**

""A dramatic and surreal naval battle at sea: a classic 17th-century wooden pirate ship, bristling with sails and black flags, attacking a modern aircraft carrier. The pirate ship is rendered in meticulous detail: weathered wooden hull, tattered sails flapping in the wind, and a black flag with a white skull-and-crossbones snapping at the mast. Cannons line the deck, firing bursts of smoke and flame, their iron cannonballs arcing toward the steel giant.

The aircraft carrier, enormous and gray, dominates the horizon with its flat deck, radar towers, and lines of modern fighter jets. Its deck crew runs in panic, scattering as the impossible wooden galleon barrels forward, waves crashing against its bow. Anti-aircraft guns swivel, opening fire, but the pirate ship cuts through cannon fire like a relic of another time made flesh.

The sky is stormy, filled with dark clouds and lightning, adding chaos to the scene. Rain lashes down, streaking across sails and steel alike. The sea itself heaves violently, with enormous waves tossing both ships in opposite rhythms: the pirate ship rides high on a crest, its wooden figurehead snarling toward the carrier, while the aircraft carrier plows stubbornly through the water, massive but unwieldy.

On the pirate ship’s deck, figures in bandanas, tricorn hats, and ragged coats reload cannons and brandish cutlasses, shouting wildly. Some aim muskets toward the carrier’s control tower. The contrast is absurd yet exhilarating: barefoot sailors with swords versus a modern war machine. Smoke from cannon fire and gun turrets mingles with lightning strikes, creating a surreal haze.

The overall mood is epic, chaotic, and anachronistic, as though history itself has torn open, bringing two naval ages into direct, impossible conflict. The scene feels like a painting of glorious insanity, where romance and brutality collide on the open sea.""

I'd say it's a general miss of give the point to Qwen here (the cherry picked best of 8 is superior to that).

**Prompt 8: the alien at the grocery store**

""A hyper-detailed illustration set inside a modern supermarket, captured in a semi-photorealistic style. Fluorescent lights bathe the scene in a cold, slightly sterile glow. Shelves overflow with familiar goods: cereal boxes stacked in bright rows, fruit in green plastic bins, bottled water, and colorful promotional signs hanging from the ceiling. The central focus is the checkout counter, where a young cashier in a simple uniform is scanning groceries, entirely unbothered.

At the conveyor belt stands a customer who is unmistakably an alien, but somehow treated as though he were an ordinary shopper. He holds a plastic basket and arranges items onto the belt with meticulous care: cans of soup, bags of rice, and a carton of milk.

The alien’s physique is profoundly non-human. His body is tall and elongated, nearly 2.3 meters, wrapped in a long coat that seems adapted for concealing his unusual frame. His skin, visible around the neck and hands, is deeply textured like chitin, shimmering with iridescent hues—green, bronze, and violet depending on how the light hits. His arms are slightly too long, ending in four-jointed fingers, each tipped with a claw-like nail that taps lightly against the plastic basket as he moves.

His head is elongated and asymmetrical, slightly bulbous at the back, tapering toward a narrow chin. The skull is ridged with subtle bioluminescent lines that pulse faintly beneath the skin, as though thin veins of light run through him. His eyes are enormous, faceted like an insect’s, shimmering with thousands of tiny lenses in shifting shades of amber and crimson. No eyelids blink—his gaze is unbroken, wide, and alien.

To blend into human society, he wears a respiratory mask covering his mouth and lower face. The mask is clearly not human-made: it’s composed of dark, matte metal plates fused with tubes that curl outward, connecting to a small filtration unit strapped against his chest. The mask releases faint hisses of vapor every few seconds, as though compensating for Earth’s atmosphere. Its design is angular, insectoid, almost like a second jaw grafted onto his face.

Despite his unsettling presence, the alien behaves with total calm and politeness. He holds a small wallet with his oversized hands, ready to pay like anyone else. His posture is upright, but his elongated body arcs slightly forward, making him look like he’s perpetually leaning closer than comfortable.

Meanwhile, the cashier remains utterly indifferent. She slides groceries across the scanner, the digital beep echoing in the sterile air. Her expression is bored, as though she sees nothing unusual. Behind the alien, a few human shoppers wait in line, glancing at their phones or carts, oblivious or willfully ignoring the strangeness.

The overall mood is surreal and uncanny: the perfect banality of everyday shopping disrupted by a figure so alien it should be impossible to ignore—yet within the image, he is treated as completely ordinary. The lighting is flat and supermarket-plain, which only heightens the bizarre contrast between the ordinary scene and the extraordinary customer.""

The cashier booth seems odd, the writing is haphazard, and the alien is missing its mouthpiece... but HY gets a few details better than Qwen again. It consistently does 4 fingers in a hand, which models have generally tried to avoid and learn once and for all that hands have 5 fingers...

**Prompt #9: the dimensional portal**

""A cinematic urban scene at night, set in a modern Asian metropolis resembling Tokyo, filled with neon lights, bustling traffic, and crowded streets. The sidewalks are lined with glowing signs in bright kanji-style characters, vending machines, and people caught mid-motion. A row of green taxis dominates the street, their headlights reflecting on the wet asphalt. The city atmosphere is dense, vibrant, and realistic, with shimmering reflections of neon pink, cyan, and green across puddles.

At the center of the street, reality itself fractures: a massive glowing dimensional portal has opened, hovering like a swirling ellipse of energy. The edges of the portal shimmer with unstable arcs of electricity, rippling outward in hues of violet, teal, and white. The portal does not simply shine—it reveals an entirely different world inside, as if the glass of reality has cracked open.

From within the portal bursts a young woman from the 19th century, mounted on a horse in full gallop. She is dressed in Victorian riding attire: a dark fitted jacket with brass buttons, a long flowing skirt tailored for horseback, leather gloves, and a small feathered hat pinned to her blonde hair. Her expression is intense and focused as she leans forward, urging the horse onward. The horse itself is powerful and elegant, its hooves already crossing the threshold into the modern street, scattering sparks of portal energy as it leaps.

Through the open portal, the background of another dimension is visible: a desolate, ruined world with shattered buildings, twisted barren trees, and an inverted sky filled with ominous clouds glowing faintly red. The landscape feels lifeless and hostile, littered with rubble and unnatural growths. The colors inside the portal are colder and more sinister than the city outside, creating a jarring visual contrast.

The scene is lit by a clash of worlds: the warm neon of the city bathes the taxis and streets, while the eerie glow of the portal casts unnatural shadows across the horse and rider. The bystanders in the city are caught frozen in awe and fear, blurred in the periphery, emphasizing the action of the rider and the surreal energy of the event.

The mood is dramatic, otherworldly, and kinetic—a collision of centuries and dimensions, where the hyper-modern urban realism of the city collides violently with the Victorian past and a ruined alternate universe. The viewer’s eye is drawn to the horse and rider breaking through the glowing portal, the perfect embodiment of two worlds clashing in one breathtaking instant.""

This one was easier, but Hunyuan gets a few ones better: the lack of continuity of what is behind the portal the rest of the image, the location of the rider (just crossing the portal). Qwen depicts a better two-way street, though.

**Prompt #10: shot through the ceiling**

A young girl tumble from a jagged hole in the ceiling, her small body suspended mid-fall, arms flailing while her long chestnut hair streams upward as though caught in a sudden updraft. She wears a pale cotton dress, simple and slightly wrinkled, the hemp fluttering wildly around her knees as she plunges. Her face is a portrait of surprise and fear, wide hazel eyes staring into the unknown lips, her parted as if mid-gasp. Beside her, a sleek black cat twists and arches, claws extended as although searching for purpose, its green eyes glinting in the half-light. Both are frozen in that fragile instant of descent, their outlines illuminated by the stark contrast of plaster dust and neon glow. They fall into an opulent living room, decorated with refined taste and warm ambient lighting. The girl’s pale dress and scuffed leather shoes seem out of place against the grandeur of velvet upholstery and polished marble surfaces. A velvet sofa in deep burgundy anchors the space, surrounded by glass tables that catch the golden shimmer of a sculptural chandelier overhead. Cushions scatter as if startled by the intrusion, while the cat’s trajectory points it straight toward the rug below. The girl, however, appears weightless and delicate, as though she might have the echo against such refinement. The room opens towards a vast corner window that stretches from floor to ceiling, to reveal the glowing skyline of a modern metropolis. Skyscrapers stand like gleaming monoliths, their facades awash in neon pinks, silvers, and electric blues. Hovering vehicles trace faint lines of light across the night sky. Against this futuristic backdrop, the girl’s old-fashioned dress and bare scraped knees give her an anachronistic, almost storybook presence, like a character who has stumbled from another time into this sleek, unyielding world. Details heighten the dreamlike tension: fragments of plaster hover like a cloud around her slender form, dust motes glowing in the chandelier's warmth; a Persian rug, richly patterned in crimson and gold, directly below her trajectory, as if to cushion or entrap her fall. A half-open book rests on a nearby table, its pages ruffled by the movement of air, as though the apartment itself is holding its breath. The girl's hair and dress ripple in the invisible currents, her face caught between terror and wonder, as if uncertain whether she has stepped into a nightmare or a fantastical new beginning.

Chegaram ontem os cafés da compra coletiva de meio de mês do DDUCL. Comprei apenas 2, mas hoje o foco é para esse cereja fermentado. É o meu primeiro contato com um café fermentado e, meus amigos, estou impressionado!

Como todo coffee lover ansioso, já fiz ele ontem, assim que chegou. No entanto, nesse meu primeiro contato com o café, acabei errando a receita e ele saiu um pouco amargo demais (estou de férias e aqui na casa dos meus pais não tem uma balança muito boa).

Hoje, mais atento, fiz minha receita padrão no V60: 15g de café, 240g de água (1:16) em 3 despejos, mas subi 2 clicks no moedor, um KINGrinder P2, (indo para o 64). Usei uma água filtrada mesmo, que fervi e esperei por volta de 1min e meio para usar.

O resultado foi surpreendente, as notas de frutas vermelhas tomaram conta do paladar e ficou sensacional! A acidez ficou controlada com o dulçor e o amargor desapareceu. Acho que esse foi o café que tomei pela manhã que mais me deixou ansioso pelo café da tarde kkkkkkkkk (é uma coisa bem frequente por aqui).

Sobre o café, trata-se de um Catucaí fermentado da região das Matas de Minas (não tenho mais informações que isso) com torra média.

Oggi parliamo di *ricette*: come preparate il vostro pourover?

Parto con la mia, con la V60 02 visto che è quella che uso quasi sempre, a parte la moka la mattina perché voglio qualcosa di più forte ma ho ancora abbastanza sanità mentale da non buttarmi pure nell'espresso.

Fino a qualche tempo fa ho seguito soprattutto la più recente tecnica di Hoffmann, spiegata in questo video:  
[A Better 1 Cup V60 Technique](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oB1oDrDkHM).

Recentemente sono passato a una più vicina a Lance Hedrick, spiegata qua:  
[The World's Best Pourover (with my Recipes)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZst-D3eUm0).

**Caffè / Acqua**

Uso un rapporto di 60g caffè per litro d'acqua, e solitamente faccio 15g / 250ml, è semplice e mi piace. Al momento per l'acqua sto usando TWW, ma ho anche Lotus. In precedenza usavo Levissima. Temperatura 94°.

**Macinatura**

Ho un 1ZPresso K-Max (cugino del K-Ultra). L'ho calibrato per chiudersi sullo zero, e solitamente parto da 7.5 e chiudo o apro un po', diciamo che sto rimanendo fra i 7.0 e gli 8.0 a seconda del caffè (per la moka sono sui 5.0 - 5.5).

Questo è a 7.5:

https://preview.redd.it/k7s1ma2vvosf1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4644574859ffd0143d64f4cf86625ee14ecc3aeb

Qui un paio di foto, io lo categorizzerei come medio-grosso, ma non so se qualcuno toglierebbe il ""medio-"" (nella foto ho messo a fianco sale fino e semi di sesamo per aiutare a dare un senso delle dimensioni).

**Ricetta**

Stamane ho fatto un caffè seguendo questa tecnica, un Etiopia lavato di Drop Coffee, questo qua:  
[Hunkute, Washed 74410 & 74112, Ethiopia](https://www.dropcoffee.com/products/hunkute-sidamo-ethiopia)  
([Pagina archiviata](https://archive.is/O2lbu))

Lo menziono perché gli Etiopia di solito sono più *lenti*.

1. Bagno il filtro (Hario standard), e scaldo la 02 (in plastica) con acqua calda del rubinetto, perché i soldi mi fanno schifo, poi verso il caffè nella V60 creando un piccolo *cratere*;
2. Verso circa tre volte il peso del caffè per il *bloom*, quindi \~45g di acqua, senza troppa forza (7 o 8 secondi?), poi faccio roteare la V60 per bagnare tutto il caffè, e quindi aspetto fino a un minuto;
3. Verso fino a un totale di 100g di acqua, in circa dieci secondi;
4. Dopo 15 / 20 secondi, verso i restanti 150g, sempre lentamente, di solito gli ultimi 50g li verso al centro. In totale ci metto circa 40 secondi;
5. Fisso la V60 riflettendo su cosa ho sbagliato nella vita, per ritrovarmi a guardare il caffè passare pensando se debba cambiare la composizione dell'acqua. A \~03:25 ha finito. Nella caraffa ci sono \~210ml degli iniziali 250ml.

Questo in linea di massima, poi continuo a cambiare un po': temperatura dell'acqua, macinatura, forza con cui verso (al momento preferisco evitare troppa agitazione) etc.

Sto pensando se comprare la V60 in ceramica per scaldarla più facilmente (e per evitare la plastica quando posso), e voglio provare i filtri T-90 / T-H3 della Cafec di cui ho sentito parlare tanto bene.

“Are you awake?” Roks asked as Adam sat up, confused, in bed. He was at his apartment Piridas.

“yeah.. “ He got up and headed to the bathroom. “How  long was I out?”

“Only twelve hours, Evelyn called us up and told us to put you under at the 30-hour mark,” Roks replied as he looked out the window at the city, which was getting closer and closer. It was just down the hill now.

Adam got dressed, came out, and looked at him. “How bad was I?”

“Not too bad, you yelled a lot, blew up a few colonies, and ordered Jork to build a few planet-busting ships. You know the regular things. Oh, and you crucified Vorts.”

Adam looked at him and smirked. “Only that? You're still alive, so I wasn’t that bad.”

Roks laughed. “Naw, you just yelled and forgot a few things, we handle it. So do you want the good news, the disaster news, or the great news first?”

Adam grabbed his jacket and looked at him. “First breakfast, then you can start with the disaster.”

“As you wish boss.”

.

“Damn, I missed this. Nothing like blue pancakes and coffee for breakfast. Okay, hit me with the disaster.”

“The Lost fleet raided Halden six hours ago, then dropped an asteroid on it.  It's gone.” Roks said, and Adam stopped halfway in his sip and put the cup down slowly.

“Halden system? That colony had five million, how many died?” He said shocked.

“Total destruction, the planet is gone. They used the raid as a distraction. They had saboteurs planeside that knocked out the planetary ship.  When our fleet arrived, the planet was bombarded by five planet-destroying asteroids.  The lost fleet claimed it was in retaliation for your attack on human colonies.”

“Nobody survived?” Adam asked still in shock.

“Only a few navy vessels were fighting back. The administrator, the colony. They had problems with his fanatics, remember.” Roks reminded him, and Adam needed to breathe. This was a disaster. He needed to find and kill Kun-Nar and his damn fleet.

“Do we know where he is now?”

“No, a blind jump, not even in a hyperlane, it will be months before we can spot that fleet again. But I have a feeling he divided the fleet up and spread them around so they can do more of these attacks.” Roks said, Adam felt rage and defeat rise within.

“I … he… FUCK!” The coffee cup hit the wall with a crash, and Roks just sat there letting him vent. He started to realize why the others were keeping their distance.

“Why wasn’t I awakened earlier? How did you handle it?” He looked at Roks.

“Double the patrols, added new security layers on all the asteroid shields. Jork’s working on new defensive satellites to deal with asteroids. We have teams working on preventing super volcano eruptions. Vorts and Hara are working on any biological threats we can imagine. Sig-San has focused his shadows on spies and infiltrations. Sarah is rounding up any religious fanatics or pro-earth military personnel. Kira has requested a meeting with you, by the way. Apparently, Earth is reaching out to you through her.”

“Great, more bad news. I thought you said you had good and great news? How can there be any good news after this?” Adam replied

“Well, EUC is alone. None of the federations joined them. They even lost their voting rights after the debate. Apparently, admitting they would ignore our federation's instructions if it went against their interest was the game changer, and who they are working with was a game changer. The Nalos has requested permission to come here to hunt for the lost fleet, and the Caren, your pirate hunting fleet, just got bigger. They even suggested that you should apply for an alliance with them.”

He looked at him and closed his eyes, “It's good news, but…Halden damn. This was the great news? That the war with Earth will most likely end with them sending Kira to negotiate?”

“No, the great news is up north in Thule.” He said and took out his pad, and Adam looked at it. It was a life feed of Mustha Mugga in the prison cell.

“Oh.. yeah, still doesn’t make up for Halden, but yes. This is great news. How did we get him?”

Kun-Nar had sent him south to the federation to help EUC gain support against you.  Among his files, they found communications to Kun-Nar, no images, but enough intelligence to identify him. So, you got him as a gift.”

Adam looked at Roks, “he destroyed a colony. Who will trust me now?”

“That’s why I called it a disaster. Arus is working overtime to turn the public's view away from that line of thought. He is quite good. That a ship of children from Halden went through the gate is a benefit. Yet, it’s a small comfort.  If you're up to it, then Arus is waiting for you in the media room. You have to say something. That’s why I woke you up. The plan was to let you sleep until you awoke by yourself.”

Adam nodded and got up, then sat down, his legs shaking. He took a deep breath to center himself and stood up again.

“I will get ready.. I need to change,” He looked down at his shirt, where there were coffee stains on it. “Tell Arus I will be there as soon as I change.” Then he got up, an angel-droid immediately stepped up and followed him as Roks watched him leave. Adam was not going to walk around unprotected now. He had filled the whole damn Piridas up with those droids and any other protection measure he could think of.

Two hours later, he left the media room, and it was strangely silent. He had reviewed photographs from the battle, and the use of asteroids had scared him.  Jork had explained to him that it would never happen at Dirt due to Adam's excessive need for satellites and backup systems.  All the colonies were being upgraded to Adams' standard now, but it still didn’t make him feel any better. He only felt cold, not emotionally, but physically. When he mentioned it, Hara immediately took him to get a health check. It took another three hours before she let him go. When he got out, he was met with Sig-San and Roks, no words were needed as they all knew where they were going. Arus sent him a message about the first reactions. It would be a few days before they would get EUC reactions, but Kira had arrived and put herself in voluntary quarantine and had been informed that he would speak with her tomorrow.

When they arrived at the prison, it felt even colder than before; it only had one prisoner now, and he was on suicide watch. The droids and guards led them to the cell where Mustha was sitting. The man was pacing the room, then stopped as he saw them.

“Are you going to kill me?”  he asked. There was fear in his eyes.

Adam was about to speak when he saw the captain standing next to him with his cut throa, the ghost was just looking at him.

Adam swallowed before he spoke. “No,”

Mustha started to smile and both Roks and Sig-San looked at him, confused and ready to argue, but Adam continued.

“your wanted by the Wossir government for piracy, attempted patricide and corporate terrorism. I’m going to have Sig-San get every last piece of important information out of you and then I will hand you over to your father.”

Mustha's smile vanished. “Better you kill me, give me a clean death,”

Adam looked at him, and then at the ghost, back to Mustha. “You tried to kill your father for some extra credits, not even Captain Mutt was that insane.  If you're lucky, then he has some fatherly love for you. But after what you have done? The raid you led on Mugga’s main headquarters, you know, ended up killing your younger brother and sister. Right? Was that to try to kill off any potential heirs?”

Mustha looked away for a moment to gather his thoughts, then he looked back with cold eyes, almost as if he decided there was no more need to hide his true nature.  “If that old creep had just stayed dead, then I would have crushed you a long time ago. And those two, I had them killed because they didn’t mind working with you.”

“It was not an accident?” Adam asked, and Mustha shook his head.

“Punishment for working with the enemy, if your guy hadn’t arrived and killed our general, then the whole Starbase would have gone up in righteous flames.”

Adam looked between the two. “Get everything you can from him. And contact his father.”

Sig-San nodded and opened the transparent cell door, and two guards went inside, and one shot him with a stun gun. He collapsed, and a droid entered with a stretcher. He was placed on it, and Sig-San attached a face covering facemask as well as some tubes, then checked the signal and gave the two guards a nod, and they took him away.

“What was that?” Adam asked, confused, and Sig-San looked after them.

“A mind mask, he will enter an awakened dream. We can monitor his mind and give him different scenarios. He will think he is awake and well. First, one will be an escape.  We let him lead us to whatever place he thinks he would be safe. Its often used in therapy to help people get over trauma.”

Like a Virtual reality experience? How real is it?”

“Completely, it’s connected to his nervous system, so if he gets hurt in there, he will feel it in reality.  It's borderline torture, but we will just use it to gain intel. Might take a few hundred runs, but hey, even if he escapes now, he might still believe he is trapped inside the virtual reality.”

Adam looked after him, “Another line crossed. Damn.”

“You can't win a war by holding back and not hitting back.” Roks said, “Remember what they do to our people if they get them. What do you think they would do to you? Or us?”

“I know, but torture?”

“No, we are letting him escape into a Virtual reality where he ‘wins. And observe where he goes, listening to what he says and does. He is being interrogated without knowing it. He is going to believe Kun-Nar sent men to rescue him. Or that his dad will forgive him.  There are hundreds of simulations we can produce.  When he finally realizes what's going on, we will stop and let him walk around here a bit. His mind will become his prison.” A man standing next to Sig-San said.

Adam looked at him, and Sig-San introduced him.

“This is Doctor York, our interrogation expert. He is quite effective.”  

Adam looked at the thin, middle-aged man, who wore a friendly smile, a week-old stubble, and short brown hair. He was dressed in an intelligence uniform, a form-fitting bluish design, and a captain's rank.

“Are you just saying this to calm me down?” Adam asked, and he shook his head.

“No, prolonged use can make one crazy, but that’s after years, short-term use will have an effect, but will fade like dreams in the end. It is why it's so effective. After each run, I can wake him for a few hours, change his perspective so he thinks he just dreamt, and start again.  Of course, leaving him in there for too long has some chance of making it permanent memories.  We don’t want that. So don’t worry. If he is having a bad experience, then it's of his own making.” Professor York explained, and Adam nodded.

“Good to know, keep us updated.”

“We will do, sir. I had family at Halden, and I want to get the bastards behind it. He might be the one who can help\[ us nail him down.”

Adam excused himself, and they headed back to the shuttle. “Make sure he stays alive until we hand him over to his dad.”

“Of course,” Sig-San said as they headed back. Adam sat in the shuttle thinking when the pad beeped, and he looked at it, it was from Evelyn, pictures and videos of the kids running around in a paradise world. It made him smile, and he wished he too could go there, but he had a war to fight. A war he didn’t want, but sure as hell would stop. When he arrived at Piradas, he went to the office and went over the reports. Earth was in a political upheaval as the president was accused of dragging the nations on Earth into a pointless war that would only weaken their economy further.

The counterargument was that Adam was to blame, and once he was removed, they would all have access to riches beyond their wildest dreams. They had managed to get hold of the reports, and then the system beyond the gate was shown almost as an add to continue the war. It had painted a giant bull's head on his back, and while he could fight off the armies, he was not worried about idiots with a gun.

He worked until Hara came to drag him to bed, and he got four hours of sleep before waking up again. It's strange, the world was moving on as if nothing had happened. Less than 48 hours ago, a planet was destroyed, and there were news reels about a rise in meat prices on the stock market. They did mention Halden, but in the next breath, a famous idol was getting married. He felt sick and angry, but he remembered how it had been when they attacked New Macau the first time. There were simply too many people to care. That planet was gone, and for most people in the galaxy, nothing had changed. It was the harsh reality of the universe, time moves on, and it does not stop to let you mourn.

 At lunch, he met Kira, who was wearing simple clothes, jeans, and a T-shirt. Almost to show him that she was not hiding anything.

She smiled weakly. “Well, they sent me.”

“To kill me?”

“Yes, but I won't.  I’m supposed to talk to you and get you to surrender, if not, then kill you.” She said as she sat down at the lunch table. Adam looked at her. Two droids were in the room; she had seen them but ignored them.

“Who gave the order?”

“I got it from Colonel Jarmillo, but it came from the president. He wants you dead.”

“So why tell me this? Why come here in person?”

“Because he is holding John Mo as hostage. I need your help. “ She replied.

I am wondering if you can help me. My stepdaughter (she is an adult but she lives with me) entered her puppy in a photo competition and I am wondering if you can help with votes.

I decided to make a post on here to ask for help because my stepdaughter has had a very rough time lately. She lost her dad, lost all three of her elderly dogs within weeks of each other, lost a baby (pregnancy) and after the baby she found out her husband was having an affair. She lives with me now and I have been very worried about her. I have tried everything I can think of to help her and I try to do things she likes to make her feel better such as movie nights and finding little coffee shops in our area and farmers markets. She got a puppy when she moved in with me (I love the puppy but when/if she wants to move out, she can keep him so he is hers.)

This photo competition for whatever reason seems to be the one thing she looks forward to and talks about during the day with any enthusiasm. I checked with the company to make sure posting here is okay and it is. It's with the company she has puppy insurance with and she won't win money or discounts or anything if she wins, it's just simply her puppy's picture in an advertisement. It doesn't matter to me what it is, I just desperately want to see her feel better again. She was always a kind, sunny person and I would like to see her feel that way again.

Her puppy's name is Reggie. Thank you for your help and I hope you have a good day whether you can vote or not.

Fast forward to many years, a lot of my friends are dealing with alcoholism, or health issues because of smoking and drinking early on. It’s impacting their professional as a well as personal lives. They have aged faster as well. 

It’s not like I never drink now, I do it once in a long while, but the battles I won during my college time, give me the confidence to keep winning against many habits. 

When we meet, they still want me to drink, but I still say no and have a black coffee instead. 

Whatever you do today, will set the tone of your future life. And you’ll never get such a time to set the foundation of your life because after college, you’ll become a 9 to 9 work horse. Leverage these years to upgrade yourself, learn, test your determination, don’t worry about petty things!

I was a senior software engineer at a fairly well-known tech company for about 7 years. Without getting into too many details, the product was in the cloud storage space, something like Box or Google Drive. A core part of the system was a complex distributed ledger system to keep data consistent across all servers. I built this system from scratch, and for various reasons, I was the sole developer responsible for its maintenance because management never saw the need to build a full team for it.

I knew that several other senior engineers in the company were making about 15% more than me, so I asked for a raise to match their salary. The answer was a firm 'no.' So, I decided to adjust my effort to match my pay. I stopped working extra hours, became stricter with my schedule, and pretty much ignored the whole 'core hours' thing.

About six months ago, a new head of engineering came in. The first thing he did was fire my manager, so I started reporting directly to him. In one of our first meetings, he said he had 'heard things' about me not sticking to a 9-to-5 schedule. I confirmed this was true and explained my reasons. A few weeks after that call, he fired me. When I asked why, he told me my HR file was marked for 'insubordination,' which entitled me to a severance package.

Recently, I was having coffee with an old colleague who still works there. He told me that the new manager and the VP he brought in are both gone. Apparently, a big reason is that they now have a team of 5 engineers trying to do my old job. And since they're still paying my severance, they're effectively paying the salaries of 6 people to do what I used to do alone. And the best part? The platform is now notoriously unstable, they've started losing major clients, and apparently, the board is not happy at all.

And the funniest part? All this chaos could have been avoided if they had just approved that simple 15% raise.

Anyway, it just goes to show you that karma can be very real sometimes. I honestly had a good laugh when I heard the news!",6,1759407423.0,ausjobs,3,0.64,False
1nw2504,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nw2504,"Jotting down thoughts, Discord server updates/recap. What might be good for your heart🦩Might not be good for my head (guess what song this is from and if you do then you should join the Discord server.) Your music taste must enjoy Lorna Shore, Sleep Token, and AngelMaker style of genre of music.","This Discord server is also for introverts, NEETs, and people with social anxiety looking for a very quiet and still Discord server for the vast majority of the time.

I thought I should give a general idea about what the Discord server is looking for because this Discord server is also a way to help me make online friends off of Reddit, I also want to give a recap/some updates about the Discord server before I delete the mobile app off my phone in a day or two and take a break from Reddit (I don't know when I'll be back and I really can't answer that when I'll be back. I'm not even certain that I will redownload the app on my mobile phone again) Keep a reminder that I will not be turning off my chat request till another 24 hours or 42 hours around there then  you can just send me a chat request until these hours appear on the post when I'll be turning off my chat requests.

What I'm seeking further offline off of Reddit when I delete the app off my phone, keep a reminder that I'm not asking for offline Redditors to keep me company for those 24 or 42 hours that I will be online, I don't currently and I'll never currently seek something like that, that would do more harm than good That isn't subject to change either, I'll never want temporary contacts, just to make me feel a sense of false love from friendship, I want the connection to be real and not so much falsified of it all.

However this is important to understand that I'm simply and truthfully not looking for a quick and easy temporary contact within those 24 or 42 hours, I'm also just not looking for someone to message me for 24 and 42 hours then up and leave. The type of  connections that want to send me a chat request, understand that I'm looking for someone that is interested in texting me bya day-by-day basis and have the time to send a handful or a lot of text messages throughout the day on Discord (obviously everyone here knows that I don't do voice calls and I randomly send voice clips when I get the motivation to send them, and I don't want to be awkward, distracting, and embarrassing and embarrass myself on a video phone call instead.)

I should also state that the kind of person I am that I do best with is connecting with people through expressive text messages and expressive text messages from Redditors that are able to have expressive text messages through a lot of collective thoughts and to be able to have a lot of random conversations. Most of the days I'm just spending my life being in and out of being dissociative, listening to the beat and the vibe of the music that I get lost in the expressive art of music.

I excel in conversations that are an expressive art of emotional connection and emotional bonding with friends that are all related to that bonding with music or hyper-fixations of hobbies.

I'm also only seeking online friendships currently and I'm not interested in meeting anyone in real life this year due to my living conditions and my living conditions will change within a year or two from now.

Well enough of that and let's just go to another subject about the recap for the Discord server and updates about the Discord server before I make my last Discord promotion posts.

Updates on the Discord server.

Recap and new things about the Discord server and how the Discord server plays Skyrim.

You just might think, ""You really think this Discord server is okay for people with social anxiety with 60 people in the Discord server"" (I'm sure the Discord server will either rise or decrease when I say this, haha.) However, what makes you think 60 people in the Discord server are chatting up a storm? That's so inaccurately false, haha.

Yeah, well, this Discord server is heavily music-based, which means people with social anxiety will only check the notifications for the hashtags that are related to the music hashtags and will only text in the general text when the energy/vibes are right. Which is what is happening in the Discord server; nobody barely texts in the general chat hashtags, and obviously that makes sense, it being a Discord server that is heavily catering to the NEETs, introverts, and people with social anxiety.

That's how I am as well; I chat when I feel the energy, I'm feeling a break from the social anxiety, and I'm feeling chatty. I will say, speaking of social anxiety, introduction posts aren't required to chat/post amongst the Discord server members. However, if you feel the need to make an introduction post, then you can do that by doing what you normally post as an introduction post, as you would here on this subreddit.

Speaking of social anxiety, we're looking to help cure some of the sadness with cute cat pictures. Who here has cat pictures or cat videos that can help with the pet hashtag on the Discord server? If you don't have cats, then whatever pets you have or own work; that even includes if you have a pet gecko or salamander. You can also add to the spook factor if you get a lot of crows or ravens in your backyard for added vibes/coolness to the Discord server as well. I'm just trying to make this a non-toxic space for all and also trying to make friends that vibe with me.

Examples could be.

Jerry handmade inspired bracelets but without using the Sleep Token logo! However, we do have safety measures for everyone to follow to feel safe. Redditors that join this Discord server for this purpose must be able to show proof either by a piece of paper of their PayPal and the item next to the item or, if the person doesn't have proof of reviews from a retail website where you can sell your goods, by the item itself.

An example of that would be eBay reviews. I'm also trying to see if I can have a friend help me with getting animated flamingo stickers for Sleep Token vibes, and I will have to see what can be done for Lorna Shore. I'm not certain what animated emotes can be used for Lorna Shore. Maybe someone could chime in with ideas!

I'm also allowing people in the introduction post to post if they feel comfortable posting about looking for people to play video games with. I know Discord automatically has a connection feature for Steam and PlayStation profiles, but that doesn't help others/give a cue to Discord users to know if you want people to play with you or not.

I also don't think Nintendo will be interested in allowing a Discord connection option, which sucks.

Who knows, maybe it's a copyright issue with Nintendo why there can't be a Discord connection option to share your Nintendo code for others to add; that's such a shame/bummer!

Which I wanted to bring up about gaming, since it's already a spooky season, and Halloween will be right around the corner eventually and Redditors are probably wondering. Since my last posts, it's obvious enough that I'm seeking an 85 percent connection and spent the majority of that time online only rather than in person because of personal conflicts with the living conditions that I'm in right now that will change in a year or possibly in two years, and you can read more in the second pinned post, as that would explain it in more detail than bringing this post out way longer than it is right now haha. However, let's talk about what I'm talking about with friends and doing something on the arrival of Halloween.


Obviously, microphones can be muted; of course, I will mute mine. I can tell you right now I can't multitask, as you've gathered from my previous posts that were previously deleted after being uploaded for a while. I can't multitask, and I get easily distracted if I try multitasking. I also don't think anybody wants to hear their friend go, 'Uh...wait, let me open a browser tab, and let me look this up, and oh wait, I need to go back on what my friend said. What was that?'

Uh...then figures out what to say afterwards, while getting back on track, which is no thanks, and I don't expect anyone to get on the microphone anyways with social anxiety.

However, I'm looking to see if a friend on Halloween could start a screen share on Discord or even start a YouTube stream with either a Silent Hill game or a Devil May Cry game, and as is obviously no surprise, my other favorite franchise is SEGA, and I mean, how obvious is that? It would be nice to sip on a coffee and text about whatever you feel like texting about, and we don't have to text about every single cutscene that hits the game unless you find that completely necessary.

We don't really have to do that, and I don't find that necessary unless the other person thinks that's necessary. We can just get virtually cozy and text about whatever while I enjoy the stream, and yeah, we can both agree on a game that you would enjoy double screen sharing.

We could even take a break, screen share on Discord my YT music shuffle playlist that I created, and just relax on Discord listening to music for an hour or longer than an hour, maybe an hour and a half, or maybe music/texting about whatever you feel like the topic should be for the evening/night.

That would be fine, and also for game streams. I normally enjoy watching for three or four hours on screen share or YT stream, whereas music playlist shuffle screen sharing with my friends for an hour or near/close to an hour and a half is perfect because I end up dozing off and falling asleep because I'm so relaxed, LMFAO. My ex-friend/ex-partner did this with me until he didn't like doing that with me anymore, and yeah, we used to do this a lot, and this is something that almost happened once. I was so relaxed with the shuffle playlist stream/chatting away that I ended up getting very sleepy/tired and dozed off for a few minutes, haha.

The friends that I've curiously asked how autistic I sound in the past in text messages have always replied, ""You sound very autistic, and it's very noticeable in your text messages."" However, I do understand how mentally and emotionally draining it is for a non-neurodivergent to deal with someone very autistic, and you can read more on my pinned posts, but this is what happened to my ex-friend/ex-partner: he couldn't deal with my very autistic needs and partner. He thought he would be okay dating someone very autistic but found out a month later that this friendship/relationship was something he didn't want to continue doing. However, back on the energy drinks.

What my friend will do is go to the gas station and send me a picture of what energy drinks are at the gas station, and I select one. I'm a huge fan of Celsius even though SOME of their products taste nasty, and there are some Celsius products that taste cool/awesome though! Alani is another favorite of mine for energy drinks, and after we pick out energy drinks, we would either start screen sharing music or a video game for a while. I just think that's fun, and if you think this is weird or too strange. Well, I can't tell you how many times that my autistic self was/were way too overwhelming for people to deal with.

Which I should make a loud and clear statement here: just because there are 60 people in the Discord server (I don't look at the number often, so this could be inaccurate right now.) I only have about 8 contacts on my friend lists; that's because I don't and I will never individually message someone on the Discord server unless the person starts the conversation first, rather than from the posts the Redditor read on my posts or a comment the Redditor read on my profile.


Where will you be since you're deleting the Reddit app from your mobile phone, anywhere else besides Discord? Telegram or Signal?

I don't know that answer, currently the only app I've on my phone is Discord and I don't know if I'll get a text messaging app to text my friends or partner if I become burnt out of Discord and only will have the Discord app on my Windows desktop to check the notifications if something pops up from the Discord server, if this happens I will make an update somewhere on the appropriate hashtag on the Discord server itself.

However for now, the Discord app is on my phone and I'm just tending to the Discord server, occasionally texting with friends inside the Discord server (which is almost always Lorna Shore news and posting cat pictures or videos.) and seeing if anyone new messages me when joining the Discord server if there is an interest in friendship. I just wait for the friendship to come to me, as I'm getting tired of looking for friendship, and I'm finding that I'm getting that autistic burnout and feeling overstimulated by everything/needing a break.

Yeah I can say that, from what I can gather how people are enjoying this Discord server, a lot of people have felt relaxed in this Discord server (in the past we had some drama happen in the Discord server, which I will not bring there and you can read my highly important pinned post, obviously there is a reason why those post are pinned to begin with.) However, other than that people enjoy how relaxed this Discord server is. Many people just wait to post band recommendations, lyrics videos, anything music related and cute pictures of people's pets, and sometimes a random bird photo will drop for people that want to take pictures of wildlife animals from their backyard or someone decided to post a random a random picture of a bird and decided to drop it there, which is fine if that's what people want to do. Adding the cuteness factor to the Discord server is what we want and, as I previously stated already, we need to add the spook factor by adding cute crows and ravens from your backyard!

What do friends think or partners think of matching phone cases and band stickers? Obviously the stickers will be Lorna Shore and Sleep Token obviously, haha. I'm also talking about if a friend or a partner of mine would enjoy matching a teal phone case or a cherry pattern phone case design to match, I think that's a cute idea! However, I know it's probably very hard to get a phone case because of very old phone models and one of my friends told me that TeePublic and Redbubble aren't shipping internationally anymore, which sucks! Speaking of international, I don't care if you're international! Even if I'm from the U.S. and if you've legitimate REAL cool/awesome vibes, then I want to get to know you!

This is how the Discord server owner plays Skyrim.

Skyrim updates.

The only reason why I joined Dawnguard was because I don't know what was up with my game, but who doesn't on a not modded Skyrim game? You never know what kind of problems you're going to run into in Skyrim with the hilarious and funny glitches. However, this seemed interesting to me, and I don't even know why that kept on happening to me at a very high chance rate, but almost 70 percent of the time I would fast travel. The vampires would be after me constantly, and I was annoyed.

What even got worse was a few vampires ruined some NPC quests I wanted to complete, so I'm taking my vengeance out on them for their annoyance, haha. However, this gave me the chance to see if I enjoyed the crossbow anyways, because when I played Skyrim on a console I didn't have any more, and obviously the save file was gone. My favorite style was blocking and using the Mace of Molag Bal.

However, using a crossbow is very deadly, and surprisingly, I'm very good at using a crossbow. Back when I played Skyrim on the console that I used to know, I just had the basic copy of Skyrim, nothing fancy and no special edition. However, that is different now since I play on the PS4. I'm also a Stormcloak, obviously, because I can't stand annoying politics where there are a bunch of NPCs talking about high praise for the Imperials, and it's just getting me to think, ""You're about as annoying as Nazeem,"" and every single time I go to Whiterun, here he goes with his famous Cloud District post. I've never seen an NPC be as annoying as a Stormcloak, though. However, it's no wonder why people want to kill Nazeem; he's literally annoying.

I want to see how much I can handicap myself this time around without using double enchantments on my gear but a single enchantment on my gear with my newry, and I'll also not be using any elemental protection to further handicap me, haha. I'm also on adept combat level mode because I think that's all the stress level I want to give myself while mildly handicapping myself on the game, and I don't think I want to change the combat level difficulty.

I simply and truthfully think the only way I'm going to survive a Falmer cave is if I have a tank follower with high experience in block, heavy gear, and archery to back me up. This is going to create a very stressful environment; however, I never handicapped myself like this on Skyrim, as I've always done double enchantments on my gear and my jewelry. I've also never done any elemental protection on my gear before, and I never did a 1-enchantment handicap on my gear and my jewelry.

What are you looking for in the Discord server? Are you looking for offline Redditors to help you with the Discord server? As a Discord owner do you need any assistance with anything that a offline Redditor can help you with? We also need to know what the Discord server icon is about and the Discord server title, what is that about?

Who is that on the Discord server icon? That's Will Ramos excited to eat something that made him pass out, damn the food must've been THAT good. I may/might change the Discord server's icon to Will Ramos's sigil name that's posted on my Reddit page (not my image, and I don't claim it's my image.) Will Ramos posted that on his social media when FB allowed you to click on images and save them without logging in. However, I'm having issues with that now, and oddly, I can't look at reels anymore without logging in. That's why I'm asking for others to help post Lorna Shore and Sleep Token newsfeeds on the correct hashtags on the Discord server. We're also looking for Discord members that want to occasionally post Lorna Shore and Sleep Token memes, which are welcomed in the correct hashtags to be posted. Obviously the Discord title name is obviously taken from a Lorna Shore song lyric, which most of the Redditors reading this probably expected just as much as that, haha.

The mountain air was sharp and thin, biting at the lungs with every breath. Snow crunched beneath the weight of his bare feet as Kuroki Gensai shifted through another kata, his frame moving with the weightless precision of a man who had ground every gesture down to its purest form. His muscles, scar-etched and corded with years of brutal discipline, rose and fell in silence as he cut through the stillness of dawn.



The wind whispered through the pines. He ignored it.



Then a hum. Mechanical. Out of place in the natural silence.

Kuroki gensai's  head tilted slightly. His eyes, dark and unflinching, followed the noise.



Above him, against the gray-blue sky, a black shape descended—a drone, its rotors buzzing like the wings of some oversized hornet. It hovered with clinical patience, the kind of machine sent with purpose, not curiosity. From its belly, something dropped.



An envelope, bound in wax, landed lightly in the snow at his feet.



For a long moment, he did not move. His breath was steady, steaming in the cold, the way of a man who had long ago mastered stillness. Then, with a slow bend at the waist, Kuroki picked it up. The paper was cold, brittle from the mountain chill, but heavy with something unseen.



He broke the seal.



The lines of his face, carved deep by age and struggle, did not change as his eyes moved across the words. Only the faintest shadow touched him—a solemn weight slipping behind his expressionless mask.



The wind carried the last note of the drone’s retreat into silence.



Kuroki folded the letter with deliberate care and slid it inside his gi. He looked out over the mountain’s edge, where the clouds gathered like an endless battlefield. It would seem like once again the world would crave more bloodshed. 



  
Italy, 2025 

 In the hills above Florence, beyond the reach of satellites or satellites' masters, stood a villa that did not appear on any map.Not even as a shadow.Not even as a rumor.The road to it was paved in imported black stone that seemed to drink the light. It wound through groves of genetically engineered olive trees, symmetrical and silent. The gates—twenty feet high, matte black, forged from submarine steel—Vaulted ceilings framed by frescoes painted by men whose signatures had been erased from history. Silk curtains thick enough to stop bullets. Floors polished to mirror shine. No gold in sight—too vulgar. The wealth here was in silence, in stillness, in the air itself, which smelled faintly of orange blossom and old paper.On the second floor, behind six biometric checkpoints, a man stood barefoot on a Persian rug woven in the 14th century.He was known only as Matteo Bellandi. Matteo was seventy-eight.though He did not look it.His frame was lean but regal, every movement deliberate, economical. He wore cream-colored slacks and a hand-stitched Neapolitan blazer over a black silk shirt, unbuttoned at the throat. No jewelry. No watch. His skin was the color of antique bronze. Hair pure white, thick, combed back like a war general preparing for a final campaign. His eyes were black—not brown, not hazel, but obsidian—and impossibly still.A servant approached with a silver tray holding a porcelain demitasse. Matteo nodded.The servant bowed—lower than necessary—and vanished behind one of the silent-moving walls.Matteo sipped. The coffee had been harvested from a private hillside in Yemen, dried in the stomachs of civets fed only saffron and dates, brewed through spring water drawn from an aquifer below Mt. Fuji. It was perfect. Because everything in this villa was perfect. He stepped into the adjacent room.The Round Room.It was not a circle of equals.Thirteen seats formed a perfect ring, but one was higher. His.Each seat was sculpted from black Carrara marble, inlaid with ancient obsidian from the Mayan temples. The air was cool, dry, and smelled faintly of vetiver and blood ink.One by one, the others arrived.A Chinese industrialist with teeth made of synthetic diamond.A Moroccan arms dealer in flowing white robes and lambskin slippers.A Balkan billionaire wearing the same suit as Matteo—same tailor, different posture.A Brazilian woman with fire-opal nails, rumored to have drowned her predecessor in a hydrotherapy pool.They spoke in murmurs. French, Russian, Urdu, Japanese. But when Matteo entered, the room fell into silence.He sat.And without raising his voice, said:""It begins.""Below the villa, in what appeared to be a wine cellar but was in fact a tactical crypt, a team of masked agents activated a system unseen since the last Tournament.Each invitation was handwritten—never printed. The parchment was grown in a hydroponic lab. The ink was mixed with crushed pearls and clotted blood. Each envelope bore a seal in black wax pressed with a signet forged from meteorite.Thirty-two envelopes. Thirty-two destinies.They left the villa in velvet cases, loaded into armored Bentleys and nondescript jets, carried by emissaries who swore oaths in twelve languages. Some rode horseback through valleys. Some dived into frozen rivers to reach submarines. One was stitched into the chest cavity of a mute courier, who arrived at the shores of Lagos with sutures still weeping.Each recipient knew what it meant.Each recipient said yes.They always said yes.

What might be good for your heart🦩Might not be good for my head (guess what song this is from and if you do then you should join the Discord server.) Your music taste must enjoy Lorna Shore, Sleep Token, and AngelMaker style of genre of music.","This Discord server is also for introverts, NEETs, and people with social anxiety looking for a very quiet and still Discord server for the vast majority of the time.

I thought I should give a general idea about what the Discord server is looking for because this Discord server is also a way to help me make online friends off of Reddit, I also want to give a recap/some updates about the Discord server before I delete the mobile app off my phone in a day or two and take a break from Reddit (I don't know when I'll be back and I really can't answer that when I'll be back. I'm not even certain that I will redownload the app on my mobile phone again) Keep a reminder that I will not be turning off my chat request till another 24 hours or 42 hours around there then  you can just send me a chat request until these hours appear on the post when I'll be turning off my chat requests.

What I'm seeking further offline off of Reddit when I delete the app off my phone, keep a reminder that I'm not asking for offline Redditors to keep me company for those 24 or 42 hours that I will be online, I don't currently and I'll never currently seek something like that, that would do more harm than good That isn't subject to change either, I'll never want temporary contacts, just to make me feel a sense of false love from friendship, I want the connection to be real and not so much falsified of it all.

However this is important to understand that I'm simply and truthfully not looking for a quick and easy temporary contact within those 24 or 42 hours, I'm also just not looking for someone to message me for 24 and 42 hours then up and leave. The type of  connections that want to send me a chat request, understand that I'm looking for someone that is interested in texting me bya day-by-day basis and have the time to send a handful or a lot of text messages throughout the day on Discord (obviously everyone here knows that I don't do voice calls and I randomly send voice clips when I get the motivation to send them, and I don't want to be awkward, distracting, and embarrassing and embarrass myself on a video phone call instead.)

I should also state that the kind of person I am that I do best with is connecting with people through expressive text messages and expressive text messages from Redditors that are able to have expressive text messages through a lot of collective thoughts and to be able to have a lot of random conversations. Most of the days I'm just spending my life being in and out of being dissociative, listening to the beat and the vibe of the music that I get lost in the expressive art of music.

I excel in conversations that are an expressive art of emotional connection and emotional bonding with friends that are all related to that bonding with music or hyper-fixations of hobbies.

I'm also only seeking online friendships currently and I'm not interested in meeting anyone in real life this year due to my living conditions and my living conditions will change within a year or two from now.

Well enough of that and let's just go to another subject about the recap for the Discord server and updates about the Discord server before I make my last Discord promotion posts.

Updates on the Discord server.

Recap and new things about the Discord server and how the Discord server plays Skyrim.

You just might think, ""You really think this Discord server is okay for people with social anxiety with 60 people in the Discord server"" (I'm sure the Discord server will either rise or decrease when I say this, haha.) However, what makes you think 60 people in the Discord server are chatting up a storm? That's so inaccurately false, haha.

Yeah, well, this Discord server is heavily music-based, which means people with social anxiety will only check the notifications for the hashtags that are related to the music hashtags and will only text in the general text when the energy/vibes are right. Which is what is happening in the Discord server; nobody barely texts in the general chat hashtags, and obviously that makes sense, it being a Discord server that is heavily catering to the NEETs, introverts, and people with social anxiety.

That's how I am as well; I chat when I feel the energy, I'm feeling a break from the social anxiety, and I'm feeling chatty. I will say, speaking of social anxiety, introduction posts aren't required to chat/post amongst the Discord server members. However, if you feel the need to make an introduction post, then you can do that by doing what you normally post as an introduction post, as you would here on this subreddit.

Speaking of social anxiety, we're looking to help cure some of the sadness with cute cat pictures. Who here has cat pictures or cat videos that can help with the pet hashtag on the Discord server? If you don't have cats, then whatever pets you have or own work; that even includes if you have a pet gecko or salamander. You can also add to the spook factor if you get a lot of crows or ravens in your backyard for added vibes/coolness to the Discord server as well. I'm just trying to make this a non-toxic space for all and also trying to make friends that vibe with me.

Examples could be.

Jerry handmade inspired bracelets but without using the Sleep Token logo! However, we do have safety measures for everyone to follow to feel safe. Redditors that join this Discord server for this purpose must be able to show proof either by a piece of paper of their PayPal and the item next to the item or, if the person doesn't have proof of reviews from a retail website where you can sell your goods, by the item itself.

An example of that would be eBay reviews. I'm also trying to see if I can have a friend help me with getting animated flamingo stickers for Sleep Token vibes, and I will have to see what can be done for Lorna Shore. I'm not certain what animated emotes can be used for Lorna Shore. Maybe someone could chime in with ideas!

I'm also allowing people in the introduction post to post if they feel comfortable posting about looking for people to play video games with. I know Discord automatically has a connection feature for Steam and PlayStation profiles, but that doesn't help others/give a cue to Discord users to know if you want people to play with you or not.

I also don't think Nintendo will be interested in allowing a Discord connection option, which sucks.

Who knows, maybe it's a copyright issue with Nintendo why there can't be a Discord connection option to share your Nintendo code for others to add; that's such a shame/bummer!

Which I wanted to bring up about gaming, since it's already a spooky season, and Halloween will be right around the corner eventually and Redditors are probably wondering. Since my last posts, it's obvious enough that I'm seeking an 85 percent connection and spent the majority of that time online only rather than in person because of personal conflicts with the living conditions that I'm in right now that will change in a year or possibly in two years, and you can read more in the second pinned post, as that would explain it in more detail than bringing this post out way longer than it is right now haha. However, let's talk about what I'm talking about with friends and doing something on the arrival of Halloween.


Obviously, microphones can be muted; of course, I will mute mine. I can tell you right now I can't multitask, as you've gathered from my previous posts that were previously deleted after being uploaded for a while. I can't multitask, and I get easily distracted if I try multitasking. I also don't think anybody wants to hear their friend go, 'Uh...wait, let me open a browser tab, and let me look this up, and oh wait, I need to go back on what my friend said. What was that?'

Uh...then figures out what to say afterwards, while getting back on track, which is no thanks, and I don't expect anyone to get on the microphone anyways with social anxiety.

However, I'm looking to see if a friend on Halloween could start a screen share on Discord or even start a YouTube stream with either a Silent Hill game or a Devil May Cry game, and as is obviously no surprise, my other favorite franchise is SEGA, and I mean, how obvious is that? It would be nice to sip on a coffee and text about whatever you feel like texting about, and we don't have to text about every single cutscene that hits the game unless you find that completely necessary.

We don't really have to do that, and I don't find that necessary unless the other person thinks that's necessary. We can just get virtually cozy and text about whatever while I enjoy the stream, and yeah, we can both agree on a game that you would enjoy double screen sharing.

We could even take a break, screen share on Discord my YT music shuffle playlist that I created, and just relax on Discord listening to music for an hour or longer than an hour, maybe an hour and a half, or maybe music/texting about whatever you feel like the topic should be for the evening/night.

That would be fine, and also for game streams. I normally enjoy watching for three or four hours on screen share or YT stream, whereas music playlist shuffle screen sharing with my friends for an hour or near/close to an hour and a half is perfect because I end up dozing off and falling asleep because I'm so relaxed, LMFAO. My ex-friend/ex-partner did this with me until he didn't like doing that with me anymore, and yeah, we used to do this a lot, and this is something that almost happened once. I was so relaxed with the shuffle playlist stream/chatting away that I ended up getting very sleepy/tired and dozed off for a few minutes, haha.

The friends that I've curiously asked how autistic I sound in the past in text messages have always replied, ""You sound very autistic, and it's very noticeable in your text messages."" However, I do understand how mentally and emotionally draining it is for a non-neurodivergent to deal with someone very autistic, and you can read more on my pinned posts, but this is what happened to my ex-friend/ex-partner: he couldn't deal with my very autistic needs and partner. He thought he would be okay dating someone very autistic but found out a month later that this friendship/relationship was something he didn't want to continue doing. However, back on the energy drinks.

What my friend will do is go to the gas station and send me a picture of what energy drinks are at the gas station, and I select one. I'm a huge fan of Celsius even though SOME of their products taste nasty, and there are some Celsius products that taste cool/awesome though! Alani is another favorite of mine for energy drinks, and after we pick out energy drinks, we would either start screen sharing music or a video game for a while. I just think that's fun, and if you think this is weird or too strange. Well, I can't tell you how many times that my autistic self was/were way too overwhelming for people to deal with.

Which I should make a loud and clear statement here: just because there are 60 people in the Discord server (I don't look at the number often, so this could be inaccurate right now.) I only have about 8 contacts on my friend lists; that's because I don't and I will never individually message someone on the Discord server unless the person starts the conversation first, rather than from the posts the Redditor read on my posts or a comment the Redditor read on my profile.


Where will you be since you're deleting the Reddit app from your mobile phone, anywhere else besides Discord? Telegram or Signal?

I don't know that answer, currently the only app I've on my phone is Discord and I don't know if I'll get a text messaging app to text my friends or partner if I become burnt out of Discord and only will have the Discord app on my Windows desktop to check the notifications if something pops up from the Discord server, if this happens I will make an update somewhere on the appropriate hashtag on the Discord server itself.

However for now, the Discord app is on my phone and I'm just tending to the Discord server, occasionally texting with friends inside the Discord server (which is almost always Lorna Shore news and posting cat pictures or videos.) and seeing if anyone new messages me when joining the Discord server if there is an interest in friendship. I just wait for the friendship to come to me, as I'm getting tired of looking for friendship, and I'm finding that I'm getting that autistic burnout and feeling overstimulated by everything/needing a break.

Yeah I can say that, from what I can gather how people are enjoying this Discord server, a lot of people have felt relaxed in this Discord server (in the past we had some drama happen in the Discord server, which I will not bring there and you can read my highly important pinned post, obviously there is a reason why those post are pinned to begin with.) However, other than that people enjoy how relaxed this Discord server is. Many people just wait to post band recommendations, lyrics videos, anything music related and cute pictures of people's pets, and sometimes a random bird photo will drop for people that want to take pictures of wildlife animals from their backyard or someone decided to post a random a random picture of a bird and decided to drop it there, which is fine if that's what people want to do. Adding the cuteness factor to the Discord server is what we want and, as I previously stated already, we need to add the spook factor by adding cute crows and ravens from your backyard!

What do friends think or partners think of matching phone cases and band stickers? Obviously the stickers will be Lorna Shore and Sleep Token obviously, haha. I'm also talking about if a friend or a partner of mine would enjoy matching a teal phone case or a cherry pattern phone case design to match, I think that's a cute idea! However, I know it's probably very hard to get a phone case because of very old phone models and one of my friends told me that TeePublic and Redbubble aren't shipping internationally anymore, which sucks! Speaking of international, I don't care if you're international! Even if I'm from the U.S. and if you've legitimate REAL cool/awesome vibes, then I want to get to know you!

This is how the Discord server owner plays Skyrim.

Skyrim updates.

The only reason why I joined Dawnguard was because I don't know what was up with my game, but who doesn't on a not modded Skyrim game? You never know what kind of problems you're going to run into in Skyrim with the hilarious and funny glitches. However, this seemed interesting to me, and I don't even know why that kept on happening to me at a very high chance rate, but almost 70 percent of the time I would fast travel. The vampires would be after me constantly, and I was annoyed.

What even got worse was a few vampires ruined some NPC quests I wanted to complete, so I'm taking my vengeance out on them for their annoyance, haha. However, this gave me the chance to see if I enjoyed the crossbow anyways, because when I played Skyrim on a console I didn't have any more, and obviously the save file was gone. My favorite style was blocking and using the Mace of Molag Bal.

However, using a crossbow is very deadly, and surprisingly, I'm very good at using a crossbow. Back when I played Skyrim on the console that I used to know, I just had the basic copy of Skyrim, nothing fancy and no special edition. However, that is different now since I play on the PS4. I'm also a Stormcloak, obviously, because I can't stand annoying politics where there are a bunch of NPCs talking about high praise for the Imperials, and it's just getting me to think, ""You're about as annoying as Nazeem,"" and every single time I go to Whiterun, here he goes with his famous Cloud District post. I've never seen an NPC be as annoying as a Stormcloak, though. However, it's no wonder why people want to kill Nazeem; he's literally annoying.

I want to see how much I can handicap myself this time around without using double enchantments on my gear but a single enchantment on my gear with my newry, and I'll also not be using any elemental protection to further handicap me, haha. I'm also on adept combat level mode because I think that's all the stress level I want to give myself while mildly handicapping myself on the game, and I don't think I want to change the combat level difficulty.

I simply and truthfully think the only way I'm going to survive a Falmer cave is if I have a tank follower with high experience in block, heavy gear, and archery to back me up. This is going to create a very stressful environment; however, I never handicapped myself like this on Skyrim, as I've always done double enchantments on my gear and my jewelry. I've also never done any elemental protection on my gear before, and I never did a 1-enchantment handicap on my gear and my jewelry.

What are you looking for in the Discord server? Are you looking for offline Redditors to help you with the Discord server?
