1jn10ka,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/1jn10ka/advice_on_how_to_become_really_good_at_something/,Advice on how to become really good at something later in life,"To summarize my situation, I feel like I am someone who had a lot of potential but never really put myself out there. When I was a kid, I was pretty smart (the only one of my siblings to get awarded financial aid to attend private school, and eventually the only person in my family to graduate college), known as the family artist, decently athletic, wrote and performed plays with my friend for our families, stuff like that. I think having a rough home life, a really shitty best friend, becoming hyper aware of the fact that I was poor in a school of wealthy kids, and maybe some undiagnosed adhd or SOMETHING just made it so that I became really reserved. I never pursued anything enough to become really talented at it, even though I feel like I am the type of person deep down who wants to be KNOWN for something. I‚Äôm not doing horribly right now; I graduated with a business degree (very much not interested in business but didn‚Äôt know what else to pick) but I work at a coffee shop, although I am making some effort to find a long term career. I also have a good group of friends and various things I enjoy doing. I just have all of this restless energy, yet simultaneously feel weighed down by adult life, and I can never stick with something for long enough to be really good at it. The closest thing I have is photography, but I am always hyper aware of how much experience I am still lacking and struggle to use my camera that often.

I guess my question is, does anyone have any stories about how they became really good at something later in life (I‚Äôm 24 for reference) or just any advice in general?",1,1743296203.0,findapath,1,1.0,False
1jn10da,https://www.reddit.com/r/VariaBrewing/comments/1jn10da/a_unique_issue_maybe/,A unique issue - maybe.,"Okay, so I have had a VS3 Gen 1 for almost as long as they have been available. I've never had any issues with it, and it gets used maybe 4 to 5 times a day pretty consistently. From what I see online, this is pretty rare... In any event, today, I had my first problem. 

I gave it a deep clean, pulled everything apart, and put it back together in the same order and arrangement that it was in initially. Well, when I went to screw the hopper back on I can't get it to seat properly. 

I gave the threads a deep clean with alcohol and applied some new grease, and I couldn't get the hopper back on. I'm scared that I may have stripped the thread in the hopper, but when I screw it on without the bearing, it sits just fine, so I'm kind of at a loss as to how to fix this.

I'm (32f) posting about a new friend (36f) I made recently that I'm starting to have mixed feelings about. We met through a certain friend-making app üêù and we got along well. We met up at a coffee shop and things went great. I wanted to arrange a second meetup and I started seeing red flags.

This is only the second time I'm meeting her in person, so I'm not completely comfortable sharing my whole life with her just yet. I have previous trauma from ex-friends who were very toxic and made me feel like I had to change myself for them, so I am trying to be more careful and also not over share things about my personal life. She asked if we could do a couples date since she already invited her boyfriend. My boyfriend was okay with it, but I do wish she asked me first. When I suggested restaurants to go to she said her and her boyfriend only do bars and breweries. We agreed on a place, but then she expressed interest in going to a different one. Now this is not a problem in itself, but I don't want to be in a position where I'm pressured to drink. I'm not a big drinker at all, I love a good sangria every once in awhile but I never cared for beer or‚Ä¶ pretty much anything else that isn‚Äôt a sweet wine or a cocktail. And one of my ex-friends was a heavy beer drinker who constantly pressured me to drink and even once encouraged me to drink and drive - one of the many red flags that I ignored (don‚Äôt worry, I didn‚Äôt do it). When I told her my reasons for not wanting to drink a whole lot (I am on certain meds) she said that her sister is on the same meds and drinking is fine for her. I wasn't looking to party all night because we both work early, and plus I was having bad allergies all day. I passed because I was not feeling well and then I found out she had already called out for tomorrow so we could be out late. Did she expect me to do the same too? Keep in mind she just started this job a few weeks ago.

Like I said, I get along well with her, but I feel like she's expecting more out of me than I'm comfortable with at this point. Am I being unreasonable, or do you think I did the right thing not going? I just don‚Äôt want to get hurt again or feel like I have to change my personality for someone.",1,1743295730.0,AITAH,1,1.0,False

For a variety of reasons that I will probably make a separate post about soon, I'm interested in attending some Sunday services and meeting with the bishop at some point. Some advice would be awesome.

I've never been to relief society or adult Sunday school before. Is there an easy way to figure out which is happening on the Sunday I visit without having to approach a random person to ask? (Never been to a 2 hr schedule before!) Is it weird if I go to either meeting as a ""visitor"", or is that not appropriate for inactive members that don't know what's going on? I'm thinking of attending Sunday school but skipping if it's RS because I'm a little nervous about getting too much attention and feeling overwhelmed.

My second, more serious area of concern is talking to the bishop and generally getting involved again. Is the best way to schedule a meeting to just walk up and ask? Honestly I'm not totally sure what I'm looking for by meeting with him but it seems inappropriate to jump back into attendance without doing that? I've lived a difficult, complicated life since I last attended and am concerned that I won't be welcomed back with open arms. Basically every part of my existence since then has involved things the church frowns upon or directly considers sins. Had my child out of wedlock, lived with multiple partners while unmarried, tattoo, coffee, alcohol use etc. I'm highly uncomfortable with ""confessing"" my whole life story to a stranger, but feel like I wouldn't be welcome to just randomly start taking the sacrament and would like to work towards that. Is the bishop going to expect me to share my whole biography right away or is it okay to build trust over time? Some of my experiences involve abuse and trauma.

What's the right process here? I understand that the church has consequences when people don't follow the set standards but it really feels uncomfortable not knowing what kind of trouble I'm in. For a long time, I didn't feel like anything I was doing was wrong and the idea of consequences felt ridiculous, but it's become obvious that parts of my lifestyle brought me legitimate suffering (okay, not the coffee, that might take some time to give up lol) and maybe you guys are onto something, you know? But the idea that I'm going to face a ton of punitive action (I don't know what the full possibilities are) has prevented me from wanting to come back for years. Should I prepare myself to be excommunicated? Maybe that's a ridiculous question but I don't know what the typical process is for this situation.

Anyways, I'm open to any advice, questions and thoughts!",0,1743294808.0,latterdaysaints,0,0.5,False

## Key Features to Consider in a Budget Espresso Machine

Fast fwd to July last year. I caught covid and for some reason it kicked off a bad bad period and ever since then, my fibroids have been acting up. (Dont know if there‚Äôs any connection, but was just what happened). My Dec period was so long and clotty I had to make a decision and ended up opting for a hysterectomy (leaving my ovaries, taking out tubes and uterus and cervix).

Wednesday before surgery. Got my gas ex, Miralax, and 800 Ibuprofen on deck, got hydrocodone too, but hoping not to use it cuz I don‚Äôt wanna get constipated. Also ordered a body pillow, I ordered this one https://a.co/d/5rtDxxL  from Amazon and it REALLY helped me sleep the first night after surgery so I wouldn‚Äôt move around - comfy. Did my sheets and cleaned as much as I could since I know I won‚Äôt be able to do it myself for a few weeks. Took a nice shower and washed my hair and at the end used that special soap they give you and got my belly button all squeaky clean!
3.27.25
Thursday day of surgery. Got up at 6:45am to be able to shower with the special antibiotic soap they give you before heading in by 8:40am. Got checked in, went to the bathroom luckily, and very soon was in back by like 9am to get prepped. The staff at Orlando Health were amazing. Put all my clothes into a bag, they had me wipe down with these wipe things before getting into gown. That was cold, but they had warmed socks and blanket ready!  They put an IV in my hand, that wasn‚Äôt pleasant. Got all the cords connected to monitor my vitals and a nice warmed blanked and my gown had a pocket with warm air, super comfy. 
Then after a while of course I had to pee ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è the nurse helped unhook my stuff and take me to a bathroom; I felt super bad about it, but it happens!
Met the anesthesiologist, and nurses, and eventually my surgeon after she was done with the gal before me. 
My mom was there and we chatted before I got some meds pumped into my IV and they worked fast! I was immediately hazy after that and I don‚Äôt even remember getting the anesthesia- next thing I know I‚Äôm in the recovery room, but I would wake up then fall back asleep a couple times. 
Then my mom was allowed in once I went to stage two, where they had to get me to pee before I was released. Bro, as soon as I was about to pee the burning sensation was so bad I stopped trying to pee. I literally had to like hype myself up like a little bish and yell, ‚ÄúJusT DO IT!!‚Äù üòÖ finally got through it - my mom turned on the sink to help me go lol.
The ride home sucked man. We were downtown Orlando and some of the streets had potholes and we hada cross RR tracks  not pleasant, but, made it home and I got on the couch and fell asleep for a couple hours. Took the big Ibuprofen and a couple gas-x, Watched some tv and got my new pillow out and went to sleep! Hada get up at 12:30 to pee, I was careful getting outa bed, I‚Äôm finding getting up and laying down are tough. Effing stings to pee still. Will def not be bending down or picking up anything heavy for a couple weeks..
3.38.25
Friday 1dpo: woke up n went pee, happy to report the burning wasn‚Äôt as bad. Walked around a bit but dang the gas thing is real! Like movin up to shoulders and Owww don‚Äôt touch it it makes it worse. Took an IB and gas x and went back to bed to rest. Mum brought me oatmeal and banana and coffee (she‚Äôs a freakin saint) and I scarfed it down (and I‚Äôm not typically an oatmeal person).
It‚Äôs sorta painful when coughing due to being intubated, gotta hold a pillow over stomach and try to cough into a pillow to mute the force, Luden‚Äôs cherry throat drops help too.
Took a shower once I hit 24hrs post surgery and feel clean again! Yay! Oh, developed a fat right top lip from being intubated I think..

Saturday 2dpo: was able to sleep through the night and got up slow. Was able to get up and pee, and it didn‚Äôt hurt as bad today.

im pretty generous when it comes to letting people borrow money for small things (e.g. covering dinner to make it easier by not splitting, covering uber rides, coffee or small snacks, etc.) most people will usually pay me back within a day or two, or they return the favor. anna has always been very grateful and gets me the money asap.

until this last month. she wanted some money to buy tickets for a music festival. this is the most she's ever asked for. she said she will pay me back by the end of the week when she gets paid but she needed it right that moment since it will sell out. i said sure bc ive never had any issues before.

then, her hometown best friends passed in a car crash and it has crushed her. so understandably, i didn't mention anything about the money. she even stopped talking to me or any of our mutual friends for a couple of weeks.

but then eventually, her mood has lifted again and she's talking in our friend group chat in seemingly high spirits. i was hanging out with one of our friends at a cafe a couple days ago and jokingly brought up that anna hasn't paid me back. she said ""this is awkward because she got me a gift for my birthday"". her birthday is next week and the early gift she got was worth $100 at least. plus taxes.

at this point, im pretty upset. anna wouldn't even reply back to me when i asked her about the money. i didnt even use a stern tone.

im big on principles. its not about the money, though it is a huge sum. but its just the idea of it all. personally, i can never take money from people. and if i do, ive done it on situations where they genuinely would insist. but i would pay them back right after. idk. i dont want to say i was raised more properly bc anna is a very kind and respectful person. its just unlike her to ignore me and not pay me back.",1,1743294125.0,Vent,1,1.0,False

Umm.. after reading all of your comments, I just want to say thank you. You all gave me the confidence boost I didn‚Äôt even realise I needed. At first, I was fully prepared to pretend the kiss never happened but your words made me stop and think. Maybe there was something there. 

As I said in my previous post I‚Äôd be meeting him tomorrow‚Ä¶And today we met so here is the update

Tldr below

~~

I decided to put a little effort into what I wore, just in case. I wanted to feel confident, and if things went well, I wanted to look nice. So I picked out a cute floral dress, and the weather was actually nice We met at this coffee/brunch place we both like. We greeted each other with a hug like we always do but this time it felt different. I knew he knew lol.

We sat down, made small talk, ordered our coffees‚Ä¶ but neither of us brought up the obvious. The kiss... No one was addressing the elephant in the room lol..

Eventually, he said, ‚ÄúAbout the other night‚Ä¶‚Äù and I just sat up, nodded, and encouraged him to keep going. But he was dragging it out so I said it straight: ‚ÄúYou drunk kissed me. And you told me you loved me. So... tell me about that.‚Äù

Haha his cheeks were pink for a moment and I‚Äôve never seen him so nervous before. He‚Äôs like ‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶ I did and I meant it.‚Äù 

I asked him how long he‚Äôd liked me. He told me it was since I got my first boyfriend, two years ago. That he remembered not feeling happy for me, and that‚Äôs when it hit him. (This also checks out because they didn‚Äôt like each other and I never understood..) 

I just nodded, taking it all in, totally shocked but also flattered. I honestly didn‚Äôt think I was even a possibility to him. He said he didn‚Äôt mean to kiss me the other night but it just felt right, he couldn‚Äôt hold it in any longer and how the alcohol really helped.  

So I told him the truth. I liked the kiss and how it made me feel something I didn‚Äôt expect. I admitted I‚Äôve never liked the girls hes had around, and deep down, it makes me feel insecure and how I thought I didn‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôd have a chance against them or even had a chance with him. And that‚Äôs why I never opened up my heart to the possibility of ‚Äúus‚Äù. 

He shook his head and got up and sat next to me putting his arm around me. And told me how silly I am and then said he loves me, and that if I gave him a chance, it would just be us and he would never give me a reason to ever feel that way again. 

He said that in the past two years, he hasn‚Äôt felt a real spark with anyone he‚Äôs dated. None of them compared. He said he‚Äôd be more than satisfied with just me and that he‚Äôd do everything he can to make me happy.

At that point, I was overwhelmed and realise how fucking stupid Ive been. I teared up and just nodded. And then he said something that made me laugh ‚Äúcan we skip everything and just be girlfriend and boyfriend already?‚Äù

I said yes. We hugged. And now I have a boyfriend who is my best friend! 

It happened so fast, I still feel like I‚Äôm dreaming. It does not feel real at all. I‚Äôm still processing this whole week. 

AND when he took me home we shared a sober kiss and it was better than the first one. 

Thank you to everyone who stopped me from brushing this off or walking away from something real. I was so insecure, convinced I didn‚Äôt have a chance, afraid of rejection. But reading your encouragement and your success stories helped more than you know.

Thank you, Reddit.

1jn0648,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1jn0648/catfished_my_partner_out_of_mild/,Catfished my partner out of mild suspicion/curiosity. Has gotten wildly out of hand within days‚Ä¶,"Catfished my girlfriend of 1.5 years, went way further than expected in only a week, not sure what to do at this point.

General background is we‚Äôve been dating 1.5 years, got serious fairly quick, both divorced, have meet each others children and families (parents/siblings). Both early 40‚Äôs.

A few instances over time that led me to be concerned/suspicious, leading to the catfishing:

- About 6 months in I found a pic of a couple shirtless dudes who she apparently met when we first met (both met online) in her hidden folder, said she saved them because they were hot and forgot about them (I didn‚Äôt snoop, she was showing me pics and accidentally showed those)
- Same time period learned that she reached out to ANOTHER guy she had met at the beginning, talked about how she was unsure of her (our) current relationship and just wanted something more casual. They discussed times to meet, exchanged a few mildly sexy pics (no nudes), but she never acted on it. (I saw the messages and how they ended with her clearly ghosting him). We were going through a rough patch then so I wrote it off.
- Month later I go out of state for work. She had told me an old college friend (male) had randomly got her number from a mutual friend and asked to get coffee to reconnect. She said it was weird because they barely knew each other in college. She meets with him while I‚Äôm out of town, she gets in his truck after he suggests driving somewhere more private (she claims she thought this was 420 related), ends up driving to a secluded spot where he then hops in the backseat and undoes his pants expecting sex. She called immediately after, mortified that she had no idea he would do that, and I accepted that. 
- Recently learned that she followed her therapist‚Äôs personal instagram and he followed hers from his. I‚Äôm 99% sure she followed his business page (fine), he then requested to follow her from his personal account, she accepted and follows him back. Major boundary issues on both their parts. They‚Äôve since unfollowed each other after I brought it up. 

The instagram thing got me thinking‚Ä¶ so if I created a fake account and requested to follow her what would happen? She accepted almost immediately and messaged ‚Äúhim‚Äù first. Mildly suspicious at first (do I know you type thing) but I think there was also interest immediately. The next day is innocuous back and forth but culminates in her telling him he‚Äôs ‚Äúreally hot‚Äù and shouldn‚Äôt have trouble dating  and that she rarely accepts random follow requests but for ‚Äúsome reason‚Äù this time she did.

The next two nights I noticed her messaging him every time her or I would leave the room at her place. Including immediately after sex - like damn, that‚Äôs the first thing on your mind?? By day 2 there is excessive flirting - I definitely played along but took her lead, pushing it a little to see how she‚Äôd respond, hoping to god she‚Äôd put a stop to it. Nope. She sends him sexy pics of her in lingerie, ‚Äúhe‚Äù send her pics of ‚Äúhim‚Äù shirtless, and from there it‚Äôs all about how hot he is, out of her league, think we can be friends, even ‚Äúgood friends‚Äù (when asked what good friends means she says ‚ÄúMeet up in a very public place then a not so public place type of friends‚Äù. More sexy pics shared, he sends a couple dick pics that I pull from the internet, she loves them, says I‚Äôve got her ‚Äúabout to risk it all‚Äù. This is 5 days in. She then agrees to meet in a few days, this coming Monday, just to be introduced, with the potential for the following Saturday night as well - she specifically mentioned getting a babysitter lined up and our banter was heavy with sexual implications. I‚Äôll be leaving town for the weekend to visit my mom that same Saturday‚Ä¶

Additionally, lots of statements like ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been thinking about you‚Äù ‚Äúcan‚Äôt seem to stay away from you‚Äù etc. 

It‚Äôs killing me. It‚Äôs been so hard to be around her and act normal and she‚Äôs noticing. I desperately want to come clean, and I actually feel really guilty for initiating the whole thing. But I‚Äôm so curious to see if she follows through with her plan to meet him this Monday, in which case I would show up and confront her then. This entire time I just wanted her to put a stop to it but just kept escalating making feel the need to know just how far she‚Äôll take it.

**To be clear...**, **We are at a time in society where** **extremism is taking place**, **not only in America**, but also UK and **parts of Europe**, like **Italy**, **Hungry**, **Bulgaria** for example... within **every pillar of society, discrimination and hate is growing like a cancer of society, feeding of the lives** of not only ""**Trans and Non-Binary people**"", but, also people of **BAME** the **disabled**, **the sick**, , **the elderly**, and even **veterans**, ,  
  
""So what you ask, we know! **We don't need to be reminded**"". This is the thing... When you stop paying attention to something, either for **self-preservation of sanity**, or because you need to get on with your life, then that's understandable  


**HOWEVER...**   
  
If **ANYONE** has been painfully paying attention to some of the ***wild*** things happening in our society lately (*which I appreciate this is very difficult to do sometimes, given the current volatile situation, that is often or not intolerable to watch!*) then you will know... What you **REALLY MUST** know is that sometimes ***paying attention*** is a matter of **life and death.** Not only this, but it's necessary for our very own survival, not only as individuals, but even as a species, group, or community! itself...  
  
By the way...**Did you know, there is** something called *""****functional anxiety****""? - What is it you may ask? -*   
  
*Well, essentially...it's a form of necessary anxiety with an actual real purpose! (I know right, wow :P). Anyway, this is opposed to ""Pathological Anxiety,"" which is essentially ""unnecessary"" excess anxiety that becomes unhealthy (like if you* ***panic*** *and* ***lose your keys*** *all the time, and freak out... This type of anxiety isn't actual beneficial for survival in any way, whether it's either antedated anxiety of the present, past, or ""future""!*  
  
Anyway... ""*functional anxiety""* (believe it or not), *ACTUALLY*  has a **genuine purpose**, rooted in a need for survival, but it's an instinct, deeply embedded in the neural architecture of you brain, it allows you to *mentally primed*, readying you for real threats to your safety or survival, it gives you Fight, Flight or Freeze, to act accordingly in response to any ***anticipated threats****,* either for group, and/or **self-preservation**. IF you survive... Then the theory goes, that you are more likely to pass on some of these traits that were your strength attributed to your survival, usually by change, over thousands of years, through your genetic makeup...So naturally, **the better you are at detecting threats, the better more chance you have of survival,** for example, you are at learning when to run from danger, far before others have the chance too...  


**In our modern society today**, this is mostly redundant, or confined to serious events, like exposure to violent/sexual crimes, natural disasters, war, famine, or Serious Pandemics (like COVID-19)...  


Not only do we need this as an **intrinsic,** instinctual mechanism for **self-survival,** but as humans, believe it or not, we are **crazy slow** in adapting, throughout the many many 100's of thousands of years or whatever it is ""of **evolution**"" compared to something, like bacteria for example, which through selective pressure, and their numbers, can multiple at greater quantities than us, and through luck, such small tiny mutations can lead to scenarios, like resistance to antibacterial drugs, for example, in fact did you know some fungus strains can take **as little as a few days, or up to a week to evolve!!!**

WHAT?! - I know right...

  
So anyway, this means we are probably totally going to run out of meds, but more so to the point...  
  
So... Maybe, we out-grew our need for such **innate behaviors, or became too comfortable with idea of their being likely little to no threat...** and as such, perhaps we needed to **turn down the dial a notch**, as we adapted in the so-called society of ""peace"" today.... However, in evolution, more often than often, it's perhaps the case, that having thought about it... Perhaps, there is no **real danger**, like you become **unnecessarily anxious**, just for losing your keys (with no immediate or future consequence on your survival in this case...)  


So sometimes, anxiety from *smaller things* can become similarly attributed to pain itself, as a sort of ""warning sign"". ..This happens, to such an extent, that it actually **begins to affect your life in ways unimaginable**, even basic day-to-day activities, quality of life, etc., and quality of life... It isn't necessarily necessary, and chronic anxiety and stress (regardless of whether it is ""functional"" or not) is very bad for you, and over time you can have a higher risk of getting seriously physically and mentally unwell (like **heart attacks, auto-immune conditions, strokes, major depressive disorder, OCD, etc.**..  Whilst anxiety in itself differs in severity... It's usually much more treatable (with far less permanent consequences, other than any of the aforementioned diseases/conditions, and so my point is...  **SOME anxiety of varying types, degrees, and severities (or flavors :P)**, which in turn might be useful! - Think of it like bog standard pain, and you lift something, which starts to get swiftly more and more uncomfortable or painful, then that's USUALLY a valid warning sign from your body to say ""**NO, STOP, SOMETHING ISN'T right...**""   
  
  
Most of the time, however, pain itself is usually a **valid warning sign** that something in your body is NOT *quite right*,  and that something is beginning to, or is damaged....  
  
**SOMETIMES though, that's not the case**,- For example, if you have pain, where absolutely *diddly squat* can be attributed to it, you've had the fancy medical tests, the tissue samples/biopsies, the EEG (No, its not a machine that can read your mind :L  or neither does it ""connect you to the mothership :L "" It just looks at brainwaves, little tiny electrophysical changes occurring in your brain)...   
  
**You've heard of medical gaslighting before??** \- Well, it's often accompanied with half-hearted help from your family doctor (ohh, take these... ***\*HANDS you Paracetamol\****), and to your *ultimate confusion O.o -* , you are thinking...Like, hey... WTF!?? ... Seriously... -\_\_\_- **WHY**!  
  
Sometimes **pain is annoying** not only for yourself, but unfortunately for others, so people gaslight you and make you think that it's all just you... Not nice. :\\ Well, it's like that with anxiety,   
  
**Think of a smoke alarm, you're making pancakes**, and you forget to open the window (perhaps because of your ADHD, or you're just tired from work, etc) So you get mixing, and you pour the last bit of your energy into making the creamiest, perfect pancake mixture ever... With the **SUPER smooooth** batter, you pour it into your pan, and pancake by pancake, your mouth begins to water a little, because you're SUPER hungry)...  
  
**Anyway, you start pancakes -** like, it's **so intense,** that you've practically begun to make it a ""new type of sport"" (which of course means being inclusive of ALL trans people :D   or something (or maybe I dunno, you start flipping pancakes like you're a crazy meth-head burger-flippin' worker, working at Wendy's... ( x.x  ohhh my, these analogies are becoming **wiiiild**. :D )  


The *whole of your soul* goes into the fine intricacy of dedicating and perfecting the science of it, i mean... Like the *ultra-fast (XP - 100  flip :S , lol sorry....)* timing of your flip, and whether it's a little too much ""cake"" for your ""pan"", so to speak ... Or maybe **you're a neat freak, and like to use a time! :P**   
  
So one by one, you flip those pancakes, and pour yourself a cheeky glass of rose, and so you GAIN 20+ stamina, and NOW... You become the ultimate pancake queen, transcending all of time and space! - Excellent... So  :D ...?   


**So, now what you ask...? - ""Uhh, get to the point Ellie... We know, you're obssessed about pancakes by now!""** (FYI, i had a pancake week, not a ""day"" where i made different types of pancakes :D)  
  
Well, now... A little time has passed, you're on your 8th pancake, and you start to realize the pan is beginning to burn a teeeeny tiny tad bit, but you're like ... ""mehh"" . So you continue to the end, only to turn around and realize... Your  kitchen looks like the local Dutch City Centre Coffee house, on the weekends! (Yikes... Not good)  
  
***Your' smokin' de pancake :3***  (Lol sorry, i couldn't help myself!)  
  
or so things had become far too hazy as such, that you forgot the whole of space and time!...   
   
So you think, "" Oh SH\*T! What have I actually, i'mma **hella clumsy** (no wonder I'm single, lol :L )... So you scram to open all the windows, and grab a pretty flowery tea towel and you waft ALL of the smoke outta the kitchen... But it's too late. **\*\*BEEP\*\***  **\*\*BEEP\*\***  **\*\* BEEP\*\***  \*\*BEEP\*\* ! The fire alarm goes off...  -\_\_\_- It's 11:30 pm and your *avg neurotypical 9-5 office working, farming-minded* neighbours, are all sound away tucked in bed, catching all the ""undead sheep"" in their farming dreams... Boring... :3   
  
The *whole neighborhood* wakes up, like the fat man ""Uncle Dursley"" from harry potter, who has arisen from the dead to find Harry escaping England, from out of his window, in a desperate attempt to find solace in a non-TERF country, Scotland... Just watch for the wicked witch when your ""Rowling"" on bye..  


ANYWAY... I digress....

**IS THERE ANY REAL DANGER??** \- NO!!! (It's just a false alarm, and you have pissed off half of the  tory farmer-minded neighbors on their 9-5's, all the from ""privet drive"",  and now everybody's getting super angry and you hear them screaming "" what is this racket"" SILENCE :L 

So the BIG question is,...If it's a false alarm, whereby there is no fire/danger, then is the fire alarm STILL useful?? - Yehh :D of course, whilst not in that situation, because you knew there was nothing to worry about, but because sometimes, if a fire alarm goes off in general, and you're not around for it to go off, then naturally you go and check and panic for danger (sometimes), unless you're passively suicidal :L but that's a whole different explanation for another time!

So then if it's a repetitive false alarm, (anxiety being the alarm) that starts to become a nuisance, and disrupts you from continuing with the rest of your life....,  and there is no way to take the batteries out, because it's one of those special ones... and over time, you become miserable, it just won't stop going off.. You can barely concentrate on anything, and it begins to ruin your life...  


THAT'S  ""**PATHOLOGICAL Anxiety**"", anxiety that is like a constant false fire alarm, that won't switch off and begins to affect your life, and ruin you... That's why you have ""valium"" (Diazepam) a medicine designed for short-term relief of severe anxiety, it's essentially like a reset or override mute button for this annoying fire alarm, because anxiety is not just annoying, but if persistently present (chronic), then over time, it can actually wreak havoc with your body, leading to ""burn-out"", and  ""exhaustion"" over time.... Then eventually, this can increase your risk of developing chronic diseases, or even worse, something more serious, sinister and severe, like **life-threatening**, or **acute health illnesses**, such as "" A stroke, heart attack, etc"".... All in all.... No good! :( 



Did you know, Humans are the **only species in the Animal Kingdom that can begin to ""anticipate"" a threat before it has even taken place?...**   


Well, the point and moral of the story is... Sometimes, that fire alarm inside of you isn't just annoying, but it's actually a cue for you to **""STOP, THINK, and act""** accordingly, in response to any danger that compromises not only YOU, but others....



**Why is it necessary?** \- Well, sometimes people choose to **ignore fire alarms**, out of *pure expectation that it isn't something of a real threat!* \- o.O Big mistake... *One day, you think it's a false alarm*, because it happens all the time, but having waited for a while in your room, you hear it outside, and you think, NO, what a load of rubbish -\_\_- I am NOT amused. Go away, and you leave it, only, to open the door .... FIRE and BRIMSTONE BLAZING and HOLY SHIT...   
  
**GAME OVER....**   
  
So You see?  


**Why is this relevant? why is OP writing a whole essay? because OP wants to warn you, not to leave the alarm out of expectation, that it is unnecessary or false...**

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# This leads me to my most important, last and final point...

Firstly, it's **important** for me to **explain what It is I am about to discuss** (as some of you might be a little less ""familiar"" with the term or definition of ""femboy""...  
  
***""A¬†femboy¬†is a slang term that can be associated with a young, usually***¬†[***cisgender***](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/cisgender?s=t)¬†***male who displays traditionally feminine characteristics. While the term can be used as an insult, some in the LGBTQ+ community use the term positively to as a form of gender expression.""*** \- Citation: [https://www.dictionary.com/e/gender-sexuality/femboy/](https://www.dictionary.com/e/gender-sexuality/femboy/)

To clarify, these **""femboys"" are NOT women, and thus NOT transgender women**... but Cisgender Men, who by extension, have an i*nternal gender identity* that aligns more closely with their natal sex at birth.  


To be clear, the term ""Femboy"" was initially a **derogatory term** which got re-used by cisgender males  (who identify with their internal identity as male)... The term ""femboy"", was and STILL is TO THIS VERY DAY, used against us, not only to belittle and reduce us, but to **""demean"", ""fetishize"", ""demonize ""and ""devalue"" transgender women**, as being **merely an object or ""half-woman"" or ""half-man""..**.



This is called ***""trans-misogyny""***. Transmisogyny--often or not--is **more likely to occur in more frequently subsets of cultures where far-right radicalized men are rampant with rage, justifying ""extremist views"" by means of suppressing women, as their ""right"" to dominate over us...** 



FYI, **ALL: Transgender and Non-Binary people are OF COURSE 100% valid**, and we have FOUGHT *extremely hard* in working for towards being our authentic selfs... However, my concern is... That these *""femboys""* or cisgender men who believe themselves to be transgender, are NOT transgender... These individuals have manipulated the system for nothing more than to gain ""hormones"" to misalign their external bodies with their internal gender identities, as merely, because they feel its perhaps ""fashionable""...



As Transgender and Non-Binary people, of all varying beliefs, backgrounds, ideas and values within society ... MANY of of us can and will agree on one thing... 



**We have worked so very hard and tirelessly OVER and OVER again, to combat against ""trans-misogyny"" and hatred towards our community..**. We have worked tirelessly towards striving towards our authentic self, despite oppression from society, spilling into our own troubles in accepting ourselfs for who we are... Because society has made us that way...



But, ask yourself... **Why the rise in Transphobia,** **over the many years?** Why the rise of ""femboys"", and cis and trans-misogyny? - Where boys and men are becoming increasingly hostile towards all women of all types within this society?? ...  
  
**The infiltration of cis-gender men, or so called ""femboys"" into Transfeminine spaces, like reddit, for example... Has become out of control!**  


The black-facing of ""trans women"" with the intention of harming trans women HAS to stop!   


Society is beggining to disrespect us... Ask yourself's, ladies, and non-binary folk of all spectrums of the rainbow... **Ask yourself, WHY??**.... Why is this becoming a fashion trend, why are we becoming the source of targets, for men who pray on our weakness, they attempt to hide amongst us, as if they ARE one of us... AND THIS NOT SO, their is NO association WHATSOVER, with any way, shape, or form of gender diversity, of **ANY element or degree of the spectrum of the rainbow in fact!**  
  
The answer, very much perhaps, is that these are men, with *internalized hatred* towards women and trans-women,  and whilst they do not claim to be transgender, they are accessing hormones...

Sending Cis-people into a frenzy of attack against us, restricting hormones in the youth, and stripping away our rights, one by one... Piece by piece, because these ""fashion"" tik-tok trendy fem-boys, these noe-marxist (gender-hating, non-enby, non-gender diverse and non-transgender, women-hating cis-men are being pandered to all sides, of our community... Why??

Because we know what it is like, to be turned away, to be isolated, because of a lack of acceptance, but... The question is, do you accept abuse ? Should you accept abuse, from people who claim to be on your-side but don your makeup, and swallow-up our precocious estrogen, rights, and hormone-blockers, merely out of some deep-rooted hate towards Trans and gender diverse folk, and even cis-women!!

**Fellow Sisters, they/them's, she/theys, and any other flavours of the rainbow, you know it to be true deep down, of who you are,**  but these men...   
  
**Why do they mock us! - why do they treat us so poorly this way...**.By essentially claiming to be transgender, when they are NOT (and I feel that perhaps, at least... Maybe **95% of them actually admit this** taking on the false identity ""persona"", with the name of a word that was ONCE and STILL is used to this very, in degrading, humiliating and reject us, for who are... They take our hormones, and twist and contort, by misrepresenting our very diverse identities, and they take advantage of our ability to accept people, for all different flavours of the rainbow... Because, we know... How hard it has been.



We have come a long way, ladies and non-binary peeps, to get to where we are, but I fear that  if we do not look amongst ourselves to find an answer to the solution, then we will face worse and worse impact on our rights, within the evermore narrowing window of opportunity. not only by AMERICANS, but it looks like the **UK is very well likely the next place, where extremism begins to form, in ways never EVER seen before**, for this to happen,  or so more years, and ask yourself... **Will society in the UK be any safer by then, because soon that ""alarm"" you are hearing is going to get louder and louder, until it's too late, until we open the door of that room with the fire... and all hell breaks loose**  


# My fellow TRANS and NON-BINARY people of varying, races, religions, abilities, genders, and sexual orientation/preferences,  and background!...



# Now is a time, when WE MUST, put down our phones, and come together, - 



For we must Not only **muster up the courage, just like others before us**, to do what is right! To make a stand and say ""NO MORE!"" - Enough, is enough... We deserve respect, dignity, love and compassion, and we cannot wait for one second more, before these cisgender men, have sought to dismantle us, from inside out... Through undignified blackfacing, and perpetuating hate, they sow confusion into the already vulnerable minds of cis-gender people who are becoming LESS and LESS supportive of us, as the very second-hand of the clock, tolls by.



In our history, **we can either be remembered as those who took a stand like those before us, or we can be remembered as the society that was dismantled by men who sought to mock, trivialize, and mis-appropriate superficially OUR identifies, PERIOD...**

**But just like Stonewall, our community fought incredibly hard to stand up to hate, and discrimination!!! -** P.S. - I NEVER condone hate, or violence, or aggression towards any group with protected characteristics, as I am like 4/5 or 4/6 of those characteristics myself! 



However.... Honestly,  
  
**WE MUST be brave to voicing our opinion and standing up to men, and to oppose their hidden agenda, aimed at harming Trans-Women's spaces,**  
  
**We must also educate ourselves, and judge for ourselves, who to trust, and who NOT to trust...**  
  
**By doing so...  We can end the hate towards us once and for all, and go on living happy, normal lives, instead of being dehumanized and ""black-faced"" by men (femboys), their own misogyny is their own sense of hate to any small healthy mix of feminine, that all men and women have in varying levels, regardless of if you're cis, or female...**  


But their intention, is to weaponize this internalized, deep-seated hatred towards us, and we MUST take a stand by CALLING this out and educating people on the differences between **US Transgender Women** vs. **""femboys""...**  
 **helping to fight this and shut it down, as it's de-humanizing towards, real transgender people**...



# and if WE DO NOT fight against transphobia by being outspoken and watching more closely out for each-other! - Then, WE WILL be COMPLETELY consumed by it, by bad actors seeking to devalue and pull apart the very community we have all worked to fight for.



**Whilst I respect self-autonomy, choice over ones body, and the right to self-expression, ask yourself, is this ""femboy"" culture harmless? - Or is there indeed perhaps, something sinister...**  
  
And how can we aim to protect, and enrich each others lives, why ensuring we can be fair and balanced within society? 

Thank you for the opportunity for my voice to be heard... 

**Remember, sometimes making the right decision in being pro-active in keeping each other safe, means making decisions that are not easy... In fear of being called TERFS, for these attitudes, is often inarguable defence used by these neo-marxist femboys, to ensue confusion and pry on our weakness...** 

This is their tactic!! To ... **Confuse, abuse and exploit**, and **they seek to divide us**, and dehumanize us, and abuse our priveledges as wrongfully theirs, and it is SHAMEFUL  that within this society... That even men today, seek to find new and inventitive ways in abusing and humiliating us, by taking on a derogatory label, and **mis-appropriate our identities as something that they are not.**  
  
T**he evidence is already out their before you**,   
  
You must only look and open your eyes, to see that this is happening right under your very noses, not just **radicalization of boys and men in America**, but also the wave of exploitive and violations of behaviour is being used against us, from the Trans-misogynistics, so called ""fem-boys"" , that take on a trans identity, like it is an ""item of trendy clothing"", just for monietary gain, and social disruption, they aim to confuse the cis-gender people, to infect us of their inner hate towards us trans-women, by plaforming their interanlised misogynistic MOCKING our identities, like it's some sort of ""fashion craze""!??  
  
Just see for yourselves, if you DON't BELIEVE, search ""femboys"" on instagram and tiktok, and you will see how people are mistaking us for THEM!!   


THAT's WHY our hormones are getting taken AWAY, that's why our rights ARE being stripped of us, day by day! Year by year...

It *confuses the minds of cisgender people*, because these ""**femboys**"" seek to misrepresent themselves as trans!! and are even LYING to doctors to obtain hormones, **SO THAT IS INDEED WHY DOCTORS ARE STOPPING GPRESCRIBING HORMONES!**

BECAUSE, we are being dismantled, wake up and smell the coffee!! - B**efore it's too late...**

If not for yourselves, do it for the future of others like us...

**Or these demonic men will erase us,**

**See for yourself, on platforms like tiktok and instagram**, - search ""femboys"" on  your social media and you will see how much hate and mockery spills out to us in **THEIR disrespectful and belittling, and dehumanizing behavio**r and comments towards **genuine, honest trans people, trying to stand up for what is right**,   
  
and if you reject this!! - *Without genuine, logical consensus*, **then I will KNOW that you are one of them, trying to sow the seed of confusion** and **therefore NOT ONE OF US!** \-, 

*It's time to put an end to this Femboy madness once and for all and show these young Gen- Z's to have MORE RESPECT for us other folk and to* ***teach them manners and respect!!***



*I* ***wish you all positivity, light and safety*** *in these* ***deeply*** ***mad and troubling times****...*   
*- Stay strong and keep your heads up, peeps.*

It doesn‚Äôt matter whether it‚Äôs friendship or potential relationships, it almost always ends the same way. 

I haven‚Äôt made a new irl friend in several years. I‚Äôm autistic and I have a flat affect, which makes people think I‚Äôm cold and unfriendly. I‚Äôm polite, but most people my age automatically dislike me for my lack of facial expressions and flat voice. Old people tend to like me much more. 

When I have forced myself to mask and show emotions, people thought I was being insincere. The IRL friends I made before all gradually drifted from me and now I‚Äôm in touch with none of them more than once a year.

Instead, all I have are the handful of people I met on Discord that didn‚Äôt ghost me within a few days or months. We text multiple times a week and I like them, but the closest ones live three hours away and purely interacting online doesn‚Äôt really satisfy my need to socialize. Sometimes I join ‚Äúfriend making‚Äù servers to meet more people, but all of those people ghost super quickly (even the ones that add me first). I‚Äôd think it has something to do with me, but I‚Äôve had multiple online friends say I was a nice person and a good texter.

Dating hasn‚Äôt been any better. Anyone who has shown interest in me changed their mind because I was either too oblivious until it was too late or I made a social mistake I didn‚Äôt notice that made them abruptly change their mind. I joined a few dating apps, but I‚Äôm in a somewhat rural area and since I‚Äôm nonbinary I went through all of the profiles on both apps available to me in less than a week. I got one like that I wasn‚Äôt into and then one match that I ended up having zero chemistry with. I am now 23 and I haven‚Äôt even had my first kiss.

I always see people on Reddit suggest the Meetup app for meeting people, but both in the big city I used to live in and the somewhat rural area I live in now the app is basically dead and the few events on there barely have any attendees (and they‚Äôre all 30+ years older than me).

The other ‚Äúsolution‚Äù I always see made online is to go to third places to potentially meet people, which I already do. Every day for the past year I‚Äôve gone to a coffee shop and then the library to hang out for a while. No one ever strikes up a conversation with me and just looking at people my own age and walking in their general direction makes them say ‚Äúpiss off.‚Äù Even out here in the middle of nowhere Oregon, the Seattle Freeze is still in effect.

Having opened it up, one thing I noticed is an unsoldered black cable. This completely breaks the circuit but when assembled, it is positioned to touch the relevant contact point to complete the circuit and the scale turns on. 

The other thing was that there is no negative cable closing the battery loop on the main board (no black cable to ‚Äúbat -‚Äú - apologies if my terminology is wrong!). I can‚Äôt see this being an issue however as the battery is directly wired to the usb-c port and I have charged these scales before once.

Otherwise, I can‚Äôt see anything in the circuit that looks obviously wrong? Cables seem to be in contact with the battery which also seems to be holding sufficient charge for the scale to turn on momentarily to tell me it is low battery.

During the time of that I was also active with my husband and about 2 months after I found out I was pregnant, I hadn‚Äôt told anybody about what happened because I found it easier to cope by ignoring it and I convinced myself my daughter was my husbands and let him believe it too, and he has been the most amazing father ever since the moment she was born they were inseparable. 

We welcomed our son when she was 7 and we were happy for a long time. I got past what happened to me I still never told my husband because in the end it was just easier to keep it to myself. The reason I‚Äôm having doubts is that I saw the boy again. I was out with a friend having coffee meeting her new baby and he walked in, we live in a small town so I often see people from school but I hadn‚Äôt seen him in over 30 years, I was convinced he moved away. 

It bought back a lot of old memories and not fond ones and every time I see my daughter now I find myself comparing her to him and trying to find what parts of her don‚Äôt come from me or my husband, something I haven‚Äôt done since she was born. I also see how my husband is with her even now she‚Äôs in her 30s and part of me thinks I should just keep on believing he‚Äôs her dad because he is in every way that counts but It‚Äôs an itch that I just can‚Äôt seem to scratch and no matter what I do it won‚Äôt go away but then what happens if I do a test to find out it would mean having to admit what happened and the fact I knew about it and lied for 30 years, how would they ever forgive that? 

It all came to ahead on Wednesday when my daughter came to visit me and I couldn‚Äôt focus on anything she was saying as I was analysing her face. After she left I had a panic attack and I don‚Äôt know what to do I feel like I‚Äôm at my limit and I‚Äôm going to burst.

I (F15) got a boyfriend (15) last January. At first, my parents weren‚Äôt okay with it, but when my mom found out na kabarkada niya noon yung parents ng bf ko, she seemed a bit more accepting. Pero kagabi, after namin mag-VC ng bf ko, pumunta ako sa kitchen para mag-coffee, and then biglang sinabi ni papa, ""Basta wag kang magkakamali, hindi ko alam kung matutulungan ka pa namin kung nagkamali ka.""

And that hurt. Like, what do you mean? Don't you trust me? Do you really think I‚Äôd get pregnant at an early age?

Since I turned 10, I've shown na I never and will never support kids na teenage parents, I even post reasons why you shouldn't support teenage pregnancy and the negative effects of teenage pregnancy!

Pero bakit ganun? Why can‚Äôt they trust me? Hindi naman ako si katangahan para magpagalaw sa bf ko. Gyatt, just thinking of us doing THAT makes me want to barf, ang sofer disgusting n maasim! Tapos we don‚Äôt even talk that much at school, and sobrang layo ng house namin sa isn't isa!

Should I just break up with my boyfriend para hindi na nika isipin na possible akong maging disappointment sa pamilya ko?

I was diagnosed with UC at 18 (I'm now nearly 23) and have been on 3 different medications so far, and with each came the same cycle despite them all being very different from each other. The cycle looks like this:

- I start the medication- I'm excited and ready to get treatment for my symptoms and I react very well and within a month I'm seeing no symptoms in my daily life whatsoever.

- 6 or so months go by and I encounter some kind of bad stressor- I'm a college student who has dealt with a lot of personal complicated stuff over the past few years and stress always gets my symptoms to bubble up and stay promenint for a while.

- I get ahold of some things and I feel better for a couple more months.

- I hit a year of my treatment on X medication and no amount of redosing, schedule changes, diet change, or loading doses do me any good- even on the days after I get my infusion or shot. I talk to my GI and go to the next medication she reccomends. (& repeat lol)

I have personally loved being on Entyvio for the past year as when I started I felt so immediately better I thought it would last forever, but clearly either my stress is so high my 2nd round of loading doses are doing nothing, or I'm just failing the med. I'm lucky enough where my symptoms don't ever hospitalize me or put me in so much pain I have to miss work or class, but it's enough to be painful, frustrating, and obviously bad for my health. 
I have a backup stash of prednisone that I take when I'm really fed up and just need relief for the day, but of course I cannot rely on that forever. 
My GI is very understanding and kind when discussing medication changes, but I always want to be heard by others who have to deal with this and I am always met with so much love and support from yall when I'm having a hard time. 

(I also don't solely rely on medication for treatment, I do not consume dairy, red meat, or any meat most days. I mostly cook meals myself and have experimented with cutting out sodas and coffee with mixed results. Medication is always the main treatment that actually gets me to remission.)

I know I'm in this battle for life, but I would like these remissions to last a few years as opposed to just under one!

1jmzkti,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jmzkti,"Super Speciosa ""Turbo"" Blend","Okay so I was able to get my hands on the NEW Turbo strain from SS( Super Speciosa). It is always a treat when we are dealing with SS. Considered high quality in MANY social circles and if you did not know, their brand was used for a major government study on kratom...that says a lot and makes them stand out from their competitors. 

So, the turbo is a special release from them. One of their highest MIT % to date from them. A lucky find indeed. 

 I begin taking my regular dose ( 3.2 grams) and wait about 15 to 20 minutes and I feel my hands clammy..but a good type of clammy. It means the kratom is kicking in. First thing I notice is that when I get up from my chair üí∫,  it requires less effort than before( I was feeling sluggish before dose). Very speedy, energetic feeling. Decided to skip the coffee with this dose for today. It packs a punch üëä.  This strain can EASILY replace your morning cup of joe because of its energetic nature. Anyways I need to take advantage of this energy so I decided to go work on the kids playground that I am building for them( they called me Bob the builder and thought it was funny..I know..kids right). I was able to get into my work very easily.  Like my ability to focus on the instruction manual was enhanced in a way. I felt content doing what I was doing...dare I say happy?.. üòå 
 Overall this strain is definitely for mornings, do NOT do this strain to go to sleep. Not sure if it's a white vein or not but it definitely has the profiles of one. Regardless the powder tastes FRESH and the powder went down smooth. Love the color of it. It's Super Speciosa üëå and if you been in the kratom scene then you know what they are about and they delivered it with Turbo once again!!. I got to say I am a BIG fan of their ""special/limited batches"", it is one of the few things that I try and keep an eye out for when they do new releases. 

Highly recommend giving SS a try if you have not done so!! You won't be dissapointed and instead will start to understand why they are in the position that they are currently in.

Wants: The vacuum has to be **less than 4""/10cm tall** so that it fits under our coffee & end tables (all the ones listed are less than 10cm, some by just a few mm).  **Excellent obstacle avoidance** \- I would rather err on the side of less cleaning being done than have a vacuum that doesn't notice if a cat left a hairball.  **Minimal hair getting tangled** around the brushes.  **Multi-floor maps** \- preferably 4 so I can map the whole house, but **2 is the minimum**.  **Self-Emptying Dock** \- returns to **empty while cleaning** & goes to **charge mid-run before continuing** if needed.

Mopping is nice to have, but the house is mopped every two weeks so this would be supplemental and doesn't have to be perfect.  I can't imagine a time where I chase the cats with the vacuum so I don't particularly care about most of what I've seen as ""pet features"".

The leader of one of the most important and feared mafias in Italy is running early to a meeting he has to attend. After his buddy, Enrico, goes on and on over how good a nearby coffee shop is, Lucio gives in and goes there. When he arrives, he‚Äôs served by a man in a green apron with a name tag that says FINN in big bold letters.

For the next few weeks, Lucio spends every morning at the coffee shop trying to get Finn‚Äôs attention and be liked by him. When that doesn‚Äôt work because Finn is too busy worrying about his job and training a newbie named Sarah, Lucio resorts to stalking, kidnapping, and even faking jobs to attempt to learn more about finn. Whenever Finn doesn‚Äôt imminently fall in love with Lucio like Lucio had fantasized about, Lucio huffs and puffs about how this was all Enrico's idea. Enrico is not pleased and retaliates by breaking all of the spaghetti noodles in Lucio's house. Lucio admits defeat and continues to spoil and fuss over his kidnapped hostage, who is currently having a crisis at the thought that his new kidnapped lifestyle is better than his old one. He eventually begins to like and fall in love with his kidnapper. One event that really solidified this love is when Finn turned 25 and lucio threw a massive party even though fin insisted that wasn‚Äôt necessary. By the end of the book, the two men live alone in a cozy, off grid house that is decked out in crystals and vintage things thanks to finn, and there are a family of deers that the two men have named and feed like pets even though finn insists that they're more like nosy neighbors because they only seem to come around whenever finn is getting laid, fighting with lucio, or eating something. They also own one, huge, round, gigantic tuxedo cat named Cosmo.

The way I primarily play cyberpunk red/2020 (I like to use pieces of both mainly in combat, but red is typically the core,) is by playing solo.

Playing with just you as both gm and player , or playing cyberpunk solo, is a much different experience than playing in a group setting. I personally love both for this very reason. That being said it‚Äôs not for everyone but I‚Äôm here to just talk about my love for the niche and hopefully introduce a few chooms to the hobby along the way!

I play cyberpunk solo with a system of tables and randomizing tools, I prep just enough to feel the start of something come together, then watch as chaos unfolds through a couple bad roles (happy endings wrong city choom or whatever)

The appeal to me is I can explore the cyberpunk universe I‚Äôve come to love so deeply in any way I see fit at any point I‚Äôm free and have my setup. It‚Äôs a brilliant tool for self expression that avoids a lot of my burnt out because it‚Äôs in a game form, I have journals and journals full of bÃ∂oÃ∂rÃ∂dÃ∂eÃ∂rÃ∂lÃ∂iÃ∂nÃ∂sÃ∂cÃ∂hÃ∂iÃ∂zÃ∂oÃ∂pÃ∂hÃ∂rÃ∂eÃ∂nÃ∂iÃ∂cÃ∂sÃ∂cÃ∂rÃ∂aÃ∂wÃ∂lÃ∂iÃ∂nÃ∂gÃ∂sÃ∂ art that I‚Äôve drawn throughout my campaigns (a lot of it is characters in intense moments involving cyberpsychosis because I find those moments interesting to depict) It‚Äôs such a good tool for creative writing too!

Today Jake and I met up for coffee. He seemed off, distant, like there was something he was dying to confess. I braced myself for the inevitable.

‚ÄúI messed up. I cheated on Anna.‚Äù

I was so f*cking confused. I sat there, frozen, unable to speak. The weight of his words hit me harder than I expected. I was caught between two people I cared about, both of them hiding their betrayals from each other. And here I was, knowing both truths and unable to share either.

Jake asked me what he should do cause he was feeling so bad about it, and i just couldnt stop thinking if this is a joke or real. I mean common what are the odds? 

Then i got mad and left cause why should i get involed in their f*ck ups, they need to solve this alone. But then if its a joke, why would they do that? 

Guys i really need help into what to do, should i step back and dont say a word? should i ask Anna and Jake if its a joke? But then if its not a joke it means i revealed the secret they shared.

## What to Look For in the Best Electric Tea Kettle: A Extensive Buying Guide

Choosing the best electric tea kettle can feel overwhelming, given the vast array of options available. To simplify the selection process, consider the following factors:

*   **Material:** Electric kettles are typically made from stainless steel, glass, or plastic.
    *   **Stainless Steel:** Offers durability, resistance to corrosion, and a sleek aesthetic. Look for a stainless steel electric kettle that is food-grade and free of harmful chemicals.
    *   **Glass:** Provides a clear view of the water level and a modern, elegant look.Ensure the glass is heat-resistant and durable. For health-conscious individuals,a glass electric tea kettle offers the benefit of not leaching any flavors or chemicals into the water.
    *   **Plastic:** Generally the most affordable option, but may not be as durable or aesthetically pleasing as stainless steel or glass. If choosing a plastic kettle, opt for a BPA free electric kettle to avoid potential health concerns.
*   **Capacity:** Choose a capacity that suits your needs. Smaller kettles (around 1 liter) are ideal for individual use, while larger kettles (up to 2 liters) are better suited for families or gatherings. For office use, a large electric kettle might be a better choice.
*   **Temperature Control:** If you enjoy brewing a variety of teas or coffees, a variable temperature electric kettle is essential. Different teas require different temperatures to release their optimal flavor and prevent bitterness. Look for an electric kettle with pre set temperatures designed for specific types of tea like green tea, black tea, oolong, and herbal teas.
*   **Heating Speed:** A fast boiling electric kettle will save you valuable time, especially when you're in a hurry.
*   **Safety Features:** Ensure the kettle has automatic shut-off and boil-dry protection to prevent accidents. Many kettles also feature a stay-cool handle to protect your hands.
*   **Ease of Cleaning:** look for a kettle with a wide opening for easy filling and cleaning. Some kettles also have removable filters to prevent mineral buildup. An easy to clean electric kettle will maintain optimal performance.
*   **Features:** Some kettles offer additional features such as a keep warm function, a digital display, or a gooseneck spout for precise pouring.

1jmz8xc,https://www.reddit.com/r/eink/comments/1jmz8xc/my_viwoods_aipaper_use_academia_without_ai/,"My ViWoods AiPaper use (academia, without AI): amazing 10.7"" eInk tablet","(First, on the device being called 'AiPaper': in my opinion the 'Ai' connotation is unnecessary, distracting and even off-putting - I suggested [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/viwoods/comments/1jmmua3/consider_dropping_ai_from_the_device_name_and/) to call it 'ViWoods Paper' instead for a much broader audience to consider it. I think it's an amazing eInk tablet regardless of its AI features.)

**My use case**: I am in academia and use the device \~8 hours per day, mainly writing notes during meetings, annotating PDFs, reading technical books in libraries, and reading fantasy books in the evenings.

I am using the 'big' version, the AiPaper at 10.7 inches (not the Mini version).

**The whitest eInk tablet screen currently on the market**

* The AiPaper is the first eInk device I can comfortably use in cozy lightning environments without a front light. In local libraries, coffee shops, I've always had to turn on my Kindle Scribe front light to some degree to not squirm my eyes. Now with the very good contrast on the AiPaper I no longer need it (a bunch of videos on YouTube show the whiteness and contrast side by side with other devices, e.g. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyvuZkrJm0I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyvuZkrJm0I) at 6:00).
* I've tried many other eInk devices without front light over the years (some of it is in my post history, e.g. recently posted about my reMarkable Paper Pro experience) but always reverted back to the Kindle Scribe because of its front light and eInk tech still equating grey rather than white screens (the AiPaper is not white like paper, but the least grey of them all).
* As a result of the lack of front light, the writing feels much better than on the Kindle Scribe because the front light layer is cut out so the pen-to-surface distance is much shorter.

**Engaged software development team**

* The device has been on the market for \~6 months now during which the software development team of ViWoods has developed new features at high speed (e.g. [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/viwoods/comments/1jk9i5t/viwoods_aipaper_update_version_36coming_in_2_weeks/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/viwoods/comments/1j5lz28/v355_update_rolling_out_gradually/)). Hence they seem really committed to their product (rather than focused on churning out one generic eInk device after the other) and I look forward to every monthly update.
* New features are exactly the ones that the community wants most (tracked through a dedicated 'Community' dashboard [here](https://viwoods.com/pages/community) that can also be accessed from the home page of the device, very nice). Ironically hardly any of these wanted features are AI related.
* The ViWoods responses and interaction with the community are also very good: not corporate jargon, and actual human answers (I was reading [this blog post](https://supernote.com/blogs/supernote-blog/why-supernote-deliberately-has-no-front-light?srsltid=AfmBOoppKl6lzSk9EeEyKdM9hVCK8nKOVpjvZiG5PZszA61XfGg-729d) by Supernote recently and found it off-putting because it's so obviously A.I. generated, the bloated writing style and using the word 'realm' on top of it, my GPTZero and Grammarly browser extensions also immediately flagged it as > 99% A.I.).

**Build + design quality**

* The AiPaper looks great (very similar to the reMarkable devices, credits to them).
* The screen is Mobius plastic rather than glass (which is very prone to breaking, i.e. the recent Onyx Carta 1300 threads). The plastic makes it more flexible - even without the case I cram it in my backpack more confidently than previous glass devices I had (I've had the Pixel 4A phone for a long time now as well which is the last plastic phone of its generation, really prefer any device I use in my hands to be plastic rather than glass).
* Also sturdy but very light (370 gram - lighter than some phones I've handled) and thin.

**Comparison with Kindle Scribe and reMarkable Paper Pro**

* Like my (jailbroken) Kindle Scribe, which is also a very good eInk tablet, it has 300 pixels per inch (PPI) so very sharp text, but it has much more features (not the distracting ones such as social media apps but rather useful ones, e.g. better PDF annotating features related to cutting margins, the ability to change PDF font size, syncing with non-Amazon cloud, task management, use with Bluetooth keyboard, and so on).
* Versus reMarkable Paper Pro I had but returned, the text on the AiPaper is much sharper and easier to read (300 PPI versus the 229 PPI which all the reMarkable devices top out at) and also, again, it has much more useful features. But no color of course, which I would find handy at some point mainly to read graphs, but I feel like color eInk is not there yet (given the inherent graininess of the screens, and Canvas flickering, not worth it yet to me).

**Bluetooth keyboard; use as external monitor**

I typed this review on the AiPaper itself; you can connect a Bluetooth keyboard to it and start typing away, great experience with hardly any delay (make sure to put it on Ultra Fast Refresh Mode). You can also use it as kind of an external monitor (e.g. through novnc / spacedesk).

**Hope for the future**

*Syncing*: I am considering getting the AiPaper Mini as well for on-the-go and at-home use, and leaving the bigger AiPaper at the office. However automatic syncing between the 2 devices is not available yet (e.g. notes written on one device auto being synced to the other one as well). I hope they will add this feature at some point.

In any case, I wish I had tried this device earlier, but never seriously considered it because of the 'AI' in the name.

Hope it helps if you're considering this device!",3,1743290901.0,eink,2,1.0,False

I would love to be your friend!","Did it work? I'm sure it worked if you're reading this! So hi, I'm BlueExodia0. I'm trying to remember back as to why I decided to choose this username, but I guess it was thought of out of boredom lol... Imagine if this was my real name.¬† I'm sure would be super annoying to write out on exams over and over and the teachers would have gotten a heart attack. At least people wouldn't butcher it like how they tend to do with my real name. We've all had that one teacher, right? If not, I'm sure a coffee shop like Starbucks comes up with a creative way to make that happen when writing our name on the cup.

Either way, I'm a 29 year old dude, living his life away on the east coast of the US. Like many of us here, we're looking for that one friend that will join us on our journey through life - someone we can truly get to know, bond with, and see develop over time. Sadly, when it comes to finding someone, I've had difficult luck. Feels like a lot of people lose interest very easily or stop replying as time goes on. I'm still holding on to the hope that there is someone out there that is interested in the real, genuine friendship and is willing to stick around. Life these last few years have gotten very lonely and it feels many people nowadays just aren't interested in putting in the effort to make things work or might easily jump to someone else :/ So I'm making this post in the hopes of making a new, long term friend, hoping this post might catch someone's eye!

I'm sitting here near my desk on a boring evening, composing a post to find that amazing, caring friend. A friend that is understanding, passionate, loyal, loving, and honest. Just all the beautiful, awesome qualities we would like to find in a best friend. Sure, trying to find someone online can be difficult or take a lot of effort, but I'm holding on to the hope that this catches the attention of someone that is really wanting to be buddies with a dude named BlueExodia0.

This is the part I talk a bit about myself. This part is usually what I tend to dread, especially during those ice breakers from the first day in our classes, but thankfully I have some time to think things out rather than be put on the spot. I'm sure most of us dread those...

* Living on a floating rock, revolving around the Sun. If you can guess the precise location, I'll be slightly freaked out but highly impressed!
* A generally quiet dude but can also be rather outgoing at times (especially online)
* I enjoy exploring about, especially in nature, beaches, old abandoned buildings inhabitant by ghosts
* A driven individual where I enjoy working towards the things I'm passionate about¬†¬†
* Respectful, honest (I suck at telling lies), a listener, enjoy being there for others, understanding, and caring
* Very single at the moment (not something I'm pushing for but if if there happens to be a connection, seeing that develop is something I'm not against)
* Enjoy various hobbies, such as reading novels, writing poetry, video editing, \*attempting\* cooking, gaming, and going to the gym

**What qualities do I look for in a friend?**

* Is a human and breathing üòÇ
* **An individual that sticks around. Not looking for someone that ghosts or disappears after a day or two. (I'm going to bold this statement because I know a lot of people simply stop caring after a day or want to jump to another person or not take the initiative to continue this because they simply get bored). Let's be real about our intentions :)**
* Puts effort into the conversation. Those one worded responses truly kill me sometimes. This helps us keep engaged and learn more about one another!
* An understanding and caring individual

1jmz6ci,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jmz6ci,Today I developed three rolls of Fomapan 400 in LQN and it was a bliss,"God damned, what LQN made to Fomapan, how it has it rendered. That is like‚Ä¶ coffee and cream, spaghetti and parmesan, summer jest and cold bear. You get what I mean.

I am not sure if LQN is unique developer. Apparently, however, it gets along with Fomapan very well. Grain is non existant, particularly when compared to effects I had been getting with my usual developer i.e. Rodinal. Contrast has been very well tamed even in some difficult scenes, the tonality is wide. All frames scanned with no issues; I believe it will be as easy to have them wet printed.

LQN is a one shot developer (not exactly, but diluted it does not last for long), which I like, but is sold in bottles of 250ml. Given that I use almost 100ml of the developer to develop three small frame films, it may be not the most economical choice among other developers but the results compensate financial cost.

The attached are few samples. They have the midtones darkened and contrast pumped a bit up but otherwise are not modified.

That pack arrived on March 3 and  the roasting date as printed on package was MFD: 21/02/2025 which means simply I got the package 14 days after it got roasted and I think this is pretty good. The other package I bought was Lavazza Espresso Barista Gran Crema Whole Bean Coffee Blend again a 2.2lb and it arrived on 19th of March and the the roasting day was 28/02/2025 which again almost 3 weeks. So the point I am telling is in conflict to others report in here my experience was pretty good so faw, at least in terms of freshness. About the taste:  
\- Super crema was a bit too much sour and bitter for me but it doesnt mean that the coffe tasted bad.   
\- The Gran crema was as described had the flavor of honey but it doesnt taste like sweet honey more like a bitter honey.

So overall I liked the super crema more than the Gran crema. Next I will try the Qualit√† Rossa which I believe less strong but has more raw coffe flavor. 

Other than the lavazza coffees I also buy trader joe's whole bean medium coffee and indeed taste wise I like its taste really well. For me its has just optimal sourness and you can really get the intensity of coffee. But it is a little bit more outdated like I bought a package about 23 days later after it got roasted according to its best by date(which trader joe vustomer service says that best by date is 1 year later than its roasting/manufacturing date).

**I've come here to mutually satiate a longing for connection with another person.**

**I want someone to chat with daily. I want someone to write lengthy letters back and forth with. I want someone to go on adventures with. I want someone with a strong, vibrant soul who can play well with my own strong and vibrant soul.** All in the same person? Wonderful! But, I don't have such lofty expectations of anyone - including of myself. If all we can have are the daily chats, or penpal exchanges, or adventures, I'd be more than happy, and hope you would be too.

**I'm 34, male, and live in the Eastern US. My only requirement for those who message me is that they're 18 or older, but I do tend to get along with cisgender women best.**

**I adore passionate people and interactions with a meaningful basis.** I have a zest for many things in life and much prefer people who also do. Of course, this isn't always how things are. I can also be deeply lethargic and melancholic and would hope whomever I meet understands that side of life as well. **The deep bonds I'm seeking are developed over time and with a full comprehensive understanding of each other.** I dislike trivialities and limited interactions. I want us to feel each other out until we've mapped out every aspect of the other, allowing us to know what's possible and what we'd like to see happen.

**I want to make it clear that if whoever is reading this feels like we may have a connection or ability to bond together they should message me. No hesitations or doubts, please.** I don't believe in losing potential and being self-defeated before anything even occurred. Many of my most monumental and longest connections were the result of someone casting away self-doubt and not letting it stop them from meeting me. There's far more to gain than there is to lose, as foreboding and discouraging as things may seem sometimes.

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you? Here are some notable values, interests, and traits to consider:

* **I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion.** I understand that it can take time to open up and feel comfortable, and this is completely understandable, but my ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way. Major bonus points for people who know themselves and what they seek and offer. Being lost together is fun, but we each need a self to become lost.
* **The complex vulnerabilities within a person are as important as anything else.** Most people have endured some form of trauma or pain, or are subject to some form of mental turmoil or woes. The type of connection I want understands, accepts, and embraces this reality. However, the type of connection I want also strives to live in spite of these things and to heal and advance in a comprehensive and considerate way.
* **Creativity and artistry are important to me.** Personally, I engage in more literary arts, primarily writing intellectually, about observations and thoughts, and conversationally, not uncommonly poetically and intensely. I can appreciate and admire many different types of expression, whether I involve myself in them or not.
* **Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life.** I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata*.' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and also that there is no outcome in which everyone benefits or avoids misfortunate calamity.
* On that, **being high in abstraction, sensation, and an ability to experience things beyond the blunt physical is pretty vital for me.** We're in a digital realm of words and cognitive interaction. Needing me right by your side to be able to bond with me, while that may be very nice, is unlikely to go further than a brief encounter. The physical is a later goal of what we create together here without needing it.
* **I'm not a 'present moment' or 'live your life the the fullest' type.** A lot of my life and values are based in things beyond myself. I exist as a blip of a transient moment with two sets of eternity, the past and future, all around me. That being said, I'm beginning to absorb that present moment in new and unique ways and am excited to see where it goes.
* **More casual hobbies of mine include photography, tech, incense, time pieces, archiving, collecting, coffee, and abstraction.** Inquire within if one stands out to you. I'm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies, so I probably have more I take for granted and didn't list here. **I haven't consumed media regularly in years**, but used to engage with a lot of it when I was younger, mostly including movies, anime/manga, and video games. I still watch movies from time to time, being more prone to it when I have someone else to accompany me. If you're looking for a gaming buddy or TV junkie you'll need to find it elsewhere, but I'm not fully opposed to sharing or talking about these things with someone either.
* **I'm INTJ and am Type 5.** I only list these psychological evaluations because some people find them important or revealing. Personally, I find many of these sorts of tests to be bunk, although I do like studying myself and other people. It's a fun activity to share with those who are into it.

Are we looking for each other? **Doppelg√§ngers are loved, but some of my best and most significant connections have been with people I had notable and vast dissimilarities with.** I'd greatly appreciate a reasonably lengthy chat/message in which you told me what within my ad resonated with you, what you're seeking, and anything else you may want to mention. I'll just end up asking about these things at some point anyway so it's simply more convenient and fluid if our conversation starts this way.

We just had an argument about how I should have not let him sleep for an hour and 30 minutes, and that I am wasting off his time in the day because of it. I was trying to nudge him up, but he is a heavy sleeper and didn't want to budge, so I just let him nap for a bit longer. He told I should have tried harder at waking him up and make him some coffee, since he did the same to me a few times before. I have always been doing that as well, but it is just that on this day, I didn't know how long he wanted to sleep for, so I didn't try to wake him up as hard. When we were arguing, he also refused to not be rude with me, and said that I should have said sorry earlier before offering any explanation. I have said my piece, said sorry and offer a solution, but it seems like he is still mad. Whenever he is in that mood, he sulks around for an extra hour or so, and am waiting for me to take the initiative. I am just upset that when he sulks like that, he is just wasting more of his time, and I am growing to resent him for it. I want to have a more constructive conversation about this, any advice?",1,1743290381.0,relationship_advice,8,0.67,False

**I've come here to mutually satiate a longing for connection with another person.**

**I want someone to chat with daily. I want someone to write lengthy letters back and forth with. I want someone to go on adventures with. I want someone with a strong, vibrant soul who can play well with my own strong and vibrant soul.** All in the same person? Wonderful! But, I don't have such lofty expectations of anyone - including of myself. If all we can have are the daily chats, or penpal exchanges, or adventures, I'd be more than happy, and hope you would be too.

**I'm 34, male, and live in the Eastern US. My only requirement for those who message me is that they're 18 or older, but I do tend to get along with cisgender women best.**

**I adore passionate people and interactions with a meaningful basis.** I have a zest for many things in life and much prefer people who also do. Of course, this isn't always how things are. I can also be deeply lethargic and melancholic and would hope whomever I meet understands that side of life as well. **The deep bonds I'm seeking are developed over time and with a full comprehensive understanding of each other.** I dislike trivialities and limited interactions. I want us to feel each other out until we've mapped out every aspect of the other, allowing us to know what's possible and what we'd like to see happen.

**I want to make it clear that if whoever is reading this feels like we may have a connection or ability to bond together they should message me. No hesitations or doubts, please.** I don't believe in losing potential and being self-defeated before anything even occurred. Many of my most monumental and longest connections were the result of someone casting away self-doubt and not letting it stop them from meeting me. There's far more to gain than there is to lose, as foreboding and discouraging as things may seem sometimes.

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you? Here are some notable values, interests, and traits to consider:

* **I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion.** I understand that it can take time to open up and feel comfortable, and this is completely understandable, but my ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way. Major bonus points for people who know themselves and what they seek and offer. Being lost together is fun, but we each need a self to become lost.
* **The complex vulnerabilities within a person are as important as anything else.** Most people have endured some form of trauma or pain, or are subject to some form of mental turmoil or woes. The type of connection I want understands, accepts, and embraces this reality. However, the type of connection I want also strives to live in spite of these things and to heal and advance in a comprehensive and considerate way.
* **Creativity and artistry are important to me.** Personally, I engage in more literary arts, primarily writing intellectually, about observations and thoughts, and conversationally, not uncommonly poetically and intensely. I can appreciate and admire many different types of expression, whether I involve myself in them or not.
* **Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life.** I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata*.' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and also that there is no outcome in which everyone benefits or avoids misfortunate calamity.
* On that, **being high in abstraction, sensation, and an ability to experience things beyond the blunt physical is pretty vital for me.** We're in a digital realm of words and cognitive interaction. Needing me right by your side to be able to bond with me, while that may be very nice, is unlikely to go further than a brief encounter. The physical is a later goal of what we create together here without needing it.
* **I'm not a 'present moment' or 'live your life the the fullest' type.** A lot of my life and values are based in things beyond myself. I exist as a blip of a transient moment with two sets of eternity, the past and future, all around me. That being said, I'm beginning to absorb that present moment in new and unique ways and am excited to see where it goes.
* **More casual hobbies of mine include photography, tech, incense, time pieces, archiving, collecting, coffee, and abstraction.** Inquire within if one stands out to you. I'm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies, so I probably have more I take for granted and didn't list here. **I haven't consumed media regularly in years**, but used to engage with a lot of it when I was younger, mostly including movies, anime/manga, and video games. I still watch movies from time to time, being more prone to it when I have someone else to accompany me. If you're looking for a gaming buddy or TV junkie you'll need to find it elsewhere, but I'm not fully opposed to sharing or talking about these things with someone either.
* **I'm INTJ and am Type 5.** I only list these psychological evaluations because some people find them important or revealing. Personally, I find many of these sorts of tests to be bunk, although I do like studying myself and other people. It's a fun activity to share with those who are into it.

Are we looking for each other? **Doppelg√§ngers are loved, but some of my best and most significant connections have been with people I had notable and vast dissimilarities with.** I'd greatly appreciate a reasonably lengthy chat/message in which you told me what within my ad resonated with you, what you're seeking, and anything else you may want to mention. I'll just end up asking about these things at some point anyway so it's simply more convenient and fluid if our conversation starts this way.

**I've come here to mutually satiate a longing for connection with another person.**

**I want someone to chat with daily. I want someone to write lengthy letters back and forth with. I want someone to go on adventures with. I want someone with a strong, vibrant soul who can play well with my own strong and vibrant soul.** All in the same person? Wonderful! But, I don't have such lofty expectations of anyone - including of myself. If all we can have are the daily chats, or penpal exchanges, or adventures, I'd be more than happy, and hope you would be too.

**I'm 34, male, and live in the Eastern US. My only requirement for those who message me is that they're 18 or older, but I do tend to get along with cisgender women best.**

**I adore passionate people and interactions with a meaningful basis.** I have a zest for many things in life and much prefer people who also do. Of course, this isn't always how things are. I can also be deeply lethargic and melancholic and would hope whomever I meet understands that side of life as well. **The deep bonds I'm seeking are developed over time and with a full comprehensive understanding of each other.** I dislike trivialities and limited interactions. I want us to feel each other out until we've mapped out every aspect of the other, allowing us to know what's possible and what we'd like to see happen.

**I want to make it clear that if whoever is reading this feels like we may have a connection or ability to bond together they should message me. No hesitations or doubts, please.** I don't believe in losing potential and being self-defeated before anything even occurred. Many of my most monumental and longest connections were the result of someone casting away self-doubt and not letting it stop them from meeting me. There's far more to gain than there is to lose, as foreboding and discouraging as things may seem sometimes.

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you? Here are some notable values, interests, and traits to consider:

* **I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion.** I understand that it can take time to open up and feel comfortable, and this is completely understandable, but my ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way. Major bonus points for people who know themselves and what they seek and offer. Being lost together is fun, but we each need a self to become lost.
* **The complex vulnerabilities within a person are as important as anything else.** Most people have endured some form of trauma or pain, or are subject to some form of mental turmoil or woes. The type of connection I want understands, accepts, and embraces this reality. However, the type of connection I want also strives to live in spite of these things and to heal and advance in a comprehensive and considerate way.
* **Creativity and artistry are important to me.** Personally, I engage in more literary arts, primarily writing intellectually, about observations and thoughts, and conversationally, not uncommonly poetically and intensely. I can appreciate and admire many different types of expression, whether I involve myself in them or not.
* **Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life.** I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata*.' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and also that there is no outcome in which everyone benefits or avoids misfortunate calamity.
* On that, **being high in abstraction, sensation, and an ability to experience things beyond the blunt physical is pretty vital for me.** We're in a digital realm of words and cognitive interaction. Needing me right by your side to be able to bond with me, while that may be very nice, is unlikely to go further than a brief encounter. The physical is a later goal of what we create together here without needing it.
* **I'm not a 'present moment' or 'live your life the the fullest' type.** A lot of my life and values are based in things beyond myself. I exist as a blip of a transient moment with two sets of eternity, the past and future, all around me. That being said, I'm beginning to absorb that present moment in new and unique ways and am excited to see where it goes.
* **More casual hobbies of mine include photography, tech, incense, time pieces, archiving, collecting, coffee, and abstraction.** Inquire within if one stands out to you. I'm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies, so I probably have more I take for granted and didn't list here. **I haven't consumed media regularly in years**, but used to engage with a lot of it when I was younger, mostly including movies, anime/manga, and video games. I still watch movies from time to time, being more prone to it when I have someone else to accompany me.

1jmyz50,https://www.reddit.com/r/IncelTears/comments/1jmyz50/what_makes_someone_creepy_af/,What makes someone 'creepy' AF?,"What makes someone 'creepy'?  For the incels in the group, I'll break it down:

1.  If your actions are conducted in such a way as to attempt to manipulate, force, or intimidate someone into an interaction that they are not voluntarily going to engage in, you're being creepy.  Example:  Cornering a person in a room and getting into their personal space.  Going to a work place where they cannot leave (i.e. a girl who works at a local store, or setting constantly in a waitress's section with the sole purpose of interaction even though you have no interest in the products or the food, but instead attempt to drag out the interaction with them as much as possible.

2.  Asking probing questions that are none of your business or attempting to insert yourself into their lives.  For example asking for the server's number, knowing she'd have to awkwardly turn you down, or wanting to know about the personal details of her life or relationship.  Now, again, this applies chiefly to people who are forced to interact with you as part of their job, such as a clerk or server.  But this can also apply in more social situations where you haven't built a rapport yet, which leads to number three.

3.  Failing to build a rapport before probing details about their life.  Setting people at ease is an important part of building a relationship, a person who you've been laughing and joking with for twenty or thirty minutes (in a social, not work related) situation is going to be more open to a chance to hang out with you later, than someone you've just ogled for an hour while nursing a cup of coffee and imagining how soft her skin must be while she keeps as much distance between you and her as possible when bringing you your eighth refill of coffee.

4.  Lie and mislead, or otherwise conduct secret harassing actions that leave a person questioning her safety.  For example, nobody is overjoyed to find anonymous notes on their car, DMs from throwaway accounts, or in the case of the below example, lead a girl on an extra 3 hours of walking on a timed hike just to spend more time with her.

5.  Waiting outside a place you know they'll be for a chance to talk to them.  Mate, you ain't as slick as you might think.  You're not a secret agent, you ain't Loyd Forger.  This is a bad idea, this is never not a bad idea, there was never a universe in all the history of the multiverse where a girl was overjoyed that a guy other than say... a husband or son, was waiting outside of her workplace to catch her alone.  

6.  Ignoring body language.  A person putting physical distance from you, looking around as if in search of help, actively avoiding interacting with you beyond the bare minimum required (such as scanning your items instead of answering questions) and then continuing to push for interaction...is creepy.

7.  Complimenting the body of a person who hasn't gotten naked with you by choice is generally a really bad idea.  It doesn't end well.  If they wanted to know *your* thoughts on *their* body, then there'd be an invitation to naked time.  You'd already have a relationship.  When you don't have that, complimenting her body unprompted is objectifying and dehumanizing and frankly it shows you don't really have an attraction to 'them'.  While it's true most people want to be thought of as 'beautiful' they do not want that to be the focus on themselves.  

8.  Attack their relationships with others and push for one with you, 'He's not good enough for you, you should give me a chance so I can prove myself'.  If they want an opinion on their relationship, they'd ask for it.  Attacking the worth of their partner unprompted, especially with such self serving ends, does not bode well for your chances of being labeled as anything more than a creepy weirdo, and a selfish one to boot since you want to break up a good relationship just for your personal gain.

9.  Go after girls young enough to be your daughter.  If you graduated high school when they were born, or later, there is no context in which that's not creepy.  No matter *what* porn tells you, very few girls who were born twenty years before you are interested in an 'older man'.  And if you're actively pursuing those kinds of age gap relationships, you are going to be looked at as the weirdo.  And you saying 'but they're hot' isn't going to help matters.  If you can't relate to adults your own age, you're a creepy weirdo, end of story.  And most young girls are going to look at the 38 year old dude sending them a drink on their first night out at a bar as an adult of legal age with...well frankly no small amount of revulsion.  You aren't going to 'hit your prime' in your late 30s and early 40s, you are going to look out of place, weird, and have people wondering what the hell is wrong with you.  
  
10.  Inappropriate sexual humor.  Full disclosure:  Yes, there are guys who can get away with this.  No, it isn't just their looks that let them do that.  It's an overall perception of who they are and they know how to connect with their audience in such a way that dirty jokes are well received with genuine laughter by both men and women.  If you are not *that guy*, then you're going to fumble it, come across as a misogynistic prick at best, or a creepy and possibly dangerous weirdo at worst.  And to be blunt with you, this really only works when those friendships are already close.

11.  Stare/take unsolicited photos/etc.  Elliot Rogers was known to just stare silently at women waiting for them to approach him, he made people uncomfortable all the time and viewed every lack of engagement as a brutal rejection.  The Virginia Tech shooter was known to take photos of women's legs in his college classes and routinely stared in silence at people, mainly women.  If you're engaging in this constant staring or taking creepshots at people, you're being creepy.  Stop it.

12.  Voice your admiration for people who have reputations for violence against women.  I won't even bother to explain why this is going to get you labeled a creep real fuckin quick.

What it comes down to here is *intent vs perception*.

A guy once posted about going to a pharmacy every day to talk to a girl who worked there, until he was banned, then got mad when her boyfriend started showing up to walk her to her car.  He *intended* to get to know someone and thought he built up a relationship.  He hadn't done either.  He effectively had a captive audience who was forced to be nice to him for her job and made her uncomfortable and worried about her own safety to the point where she couldn't leave without an escort.

Take Butters in the above, he thought the girl was into him.  She wasn't.  She was doing a job, selling a fantasy and he failed to recognize it as that.  Hanging out all night waiting for her is predatory behavior.  He didn't see it that way, but it doesn't matter because *she did*.

The guy in the Penguinz0 story chasing a girl down until the cops told him to leave the girl alone, wouldn't recognize her own lack of interest as valid until it met with 'his' desires.

Hal Stewart continued to push creepy invitations and voice obsessions with a girl who clearly wasn't interested (notice her facial expressions.  He didn't)

The guy in the IT story ignored the intent of the hike, diverted the girl from the destination, objectified her, and even at the end doesn't recognize why his behavior was a problem.  His 'intent' to get to know a girl, was perceived as deceptive, objectifying, and yes...therefore *creepy*.  If he'd instead just enjoyed the hike, followed the intentions behind it, he could have gotten to know her over a few weeks, asked her out, and maybe gotten a yes.  His haste and pushy behavior destroyed that and made him a creep.

What you *intend* is not always what others *perceive*.

And if you don't learn to understand how other people see things, you will always, always, *always* fail.

Look, I get it, socialization is a *skill*, and honestly it's going to go badly some times.  I've made some major screwups in my lifetime, I'll tell ya.  OK... I won't tell ya... the *cringe*...oh god the cringe.  :D  But trust me, I've made em.  But because it is a *skill*, you can get better at it.

Hey all - 6 weeks in, 2 on 5mg. I‚Äôve had some light nausea, but mostly disinterest in food. The nausea feels more like heartburn or gas than distinct nausea.

At least people wouldn't butcher it like how they tend to do with my real name. We've all had that one teacher, right? If not, I'm sure a coffee shop like Starbucks comes up with a creative way to make that happen when writing our name on the cup.

Either way, I'm a 29 year old dude, living his life away on the east coast of the US. Like many of us here, we're looking for that one friend that will join us on our journey through life - someone we can truly get to know, bond with, and see develop over time. Sadly, when it comes to finding someone, I've had difficult luck. Feels like a lot of people lose interest very easily or stop replying as time goes on. I'm still holding on to the hope that there is someone out there that is interested in the real, genuine friendship and is willing to stick around. Life these last few years have gotten very lonely and it feels many people nowadays just aren't interested in putting in the effort to make things work or might easily jump to someone else :/ So I'm making this post in the hopes of making a new, long term friend, hoping this post might catch someone's eye!

I'm sitting here near my desk on a boring evening, composing a post to find that amazing, caring friend. A friend that is understanding, passionate, loyal, loving, and honest. Just all the beautiful, awesome qualities we would like to find in a best friend. Sure, trying to find someone online can be difficult or take a lot of effort, but I'm holding on to the hope that this catches the attention of someone that is really wanting to be buddies with a dude named BlueExodia0.

This is the part I talk a bit about myself. This part is usually what I tend to dread, especially during those ice breakers from the first day in our classes, but thankfully I have some time to think things out rather than be put on the spot. I'm sure most of us dread those...

* Living on a floating rock, revolving around the Sun. If you can guess the precise location, I'll be slightly freaked out but highly impressed!
* A generally quiet dude but can also be rather outgoing at times (especially online)
* I enjoy exploring about, especially in nature, beaches, old abandoned buildings inhabitant by ghosts
* A driven individual where I enjoy working towards the things I'm passionate about¬†¬†
* Respectful, honest (I suck at telling lies), a listener, enjoy being there for others, understanding, and caring
* Very single at the moment (not something I'm pushing for but if if there happens to be a connection, seeing that develop is something I'm not against)
* Enjoy various hobbies, such as reading novels, writing poetry, video editing, \*attempting\* cooking, gaming, and going to the gym

**What qualities do I look for in a friend?**

* Is a human and breathing üòÇ
* **An individual that sticks around. Not looking for someone that ghosts or disappears after a day or two. (I'm going to bold this statement because I know a lot of people simply stop caring after a day or want to jump to another person or not take the initiative to continue this because they simply get bored). Let's be real about our intentions :)**
* Puts effort into the conversation. Those one worded responses truly kill me sometimes. This helps us keep engaged and learn more about one another!

I've been tested for food allergies and all have come back negative. i am lactose intolerant but have cut out dairy almost completely for a couple of years. sugar in particular seems to really aggravate my stomach but it can be anything. beans, lentils, hearty vegetables, even fruit sometimes or a regular old sandwich, really anything significant or a bit heavy just destroys my whole system, and it takes me days to go back to normal again. i can't even pinpoint exactly which foods do it because it just happens out of random every few days or weeks. I've been changing my diet to help accommodate for my stomach and nothing really seems to be helping. it seems like anything i eat or any exercise i do just sets me up for a bad rest of my day. i also notably have severe anxiety issues, but the stomach thing has been a problem for me for a couple of years now, before the anxiety advanced. just for background, i have been on birth control (low ogestrel for 2 years and now nextstellis for 2 weeks) for a couple of years with no issues and am currently on luvox as of 3 weeks ago for my ocd/anxiety with very minimal side effects. i just don't really know where to go from here. my bathroom habits are typically very regular and normal as long as I'm careful. but i feel like i have to control a lot of parts of my life and time things right in order to make sure an uncomfortable bathroom break doesn't interrupt all my plans. is this normal or should i contact my doctor ?",1,1743289822.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

Now, 6 months later the stomach pains, burping and bloating all back. Just got my h pylori test and it‚Äôs neg. Also got my blood panel results and my WBC and neutrophils abnormally low and below range for the first time.

I‚Äôm on bumble BFF but nobody ever wants to actually meet up and I have trouble getting responses anyways. Ik it‚Äôs like the epidemic of loneliness right now in adults so if anyone else feels similar to me here‚Äôs my friend application: I‚Äôm 25 (almost 26) and live in DFW, love to play video games, coffee, music. Down to go to Sue Ellen‚Äôs or any bars or veg out on the couch and watch TV. Literally up for anything! If you don‚Äôt live in the area I‚Äôm also down for online friends but I‚Äôm really hoping to meet up with people irl at some point and make a bestie (or besties). Also is anyone else struggling with this? Does anyone have tips for making friends?",0,1743289755.0,LesbianActually,8,0.5,False

Had an opioid phase, dropped it because it got old. Same year I stopped drinking alcohol, got old. This was 6 years ago. Been smoking weed for 10 years as a novelty, dropped it. Nicotine, getting old, dropping it after my vape finishes, bought my first vape probably this year. Shrooms, dropped, haven‚Äôt taken in like 4 years. 

I don‚Äôt feel the psychoactive effects of coffee, I just like how it tastes when I eat it with peanut butter and jam. Redbull and Monster just make me feel like I‚Äôve eaten too much sugar. 

Cocaine, have never bought my own but been invited into bathrooms, nothing special. Had a paracetamol phase beginning of this year, it was really romantic, but also getting old. Took molly, enjoyable but the comedown was physically debilitating, too big a price to pay. I‚Äôd do it as a side mission if it was around but I haven‚Äôt taken it in 5 years. 

Muscle relaxants, horrible experience I will never take shit again - never felt anything the day I took it but basically couldn‚Äôt move when I woke up the next day. Benzodiazepines did nothing significant to me that I could remember. We have our own local branded Xanax in my country and I didn‚Äôt remember feeling anything significant. Both were around 2018/2019. Acid was cool but acid is kind of like that cool uncle you call only during emergencies, I respect my uncle too much to waste his time - only when necessary. Acid-free for 4 years. 

I took large amounts of all these substances. Some of them junky status amounts. I will be completely sober after this vape finishes. ",0,1743289718.0,AMA,34,0.39,False

A deck of cards, an iced coffee, multiple lollipops, water, books, a scrunchy to put my hair up, a notebook and pencil, a coloring and activity book with crayons and markers, and jerky. 

Now, here‚Äôs the thing, what would I wear to my death? Something comfortable like sweats and a t-shirt, but I‚Äôm debating on bra or no bra. Definitely comfortable shoes.

1jmytc4,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1jmytc4/i_m22_feel_like_im_emotionally_cheating_on_my_bf/,I (M22) feel like I‚Äôm emotionally cheating on my BF (M23),"Context: A little over a month ago l had a crush on a girl (F23, I‚Äôll call her Bella- fake name) who I met through a good friend, and I asked her out, she was very kind but turned me down. We agreed to stay friends and things have been relatively normal.

A couple weeks ago I kissed a guy (M23 Jake- also fake name) at a party and asked him out for coffee the next day, we hit it off and started dating (Im pansexual for anybody wondering). Less than a week into the relationship he started calling me his boyfriend. I really liked him and was fine with this, even though things were moving really fast. I still really like him, but I've started hanging out with Bella more frequently (only in group settings ofc) and the feelings are starting to come back. I know that I don't have a shot with her as l've already tried and failed, but I can't help but be jealous of her current endeavors (she's now dating the aforementioned mutual friend). She keeps telling me about it and as much as I'm trying to be happy for them, I can't say it doesn't hurt a little. I feel horrible about this because I still obviously really like Jake and things are going really well. I don't want to mess up my relationship because these old feelings are coming back but I don't know how to get rid of them either. I have not and will not act on them, but still feel like l'm betraying him.
How do I get over him and stop feeling this way about my current relationship? 
Important: I have to stay friends with the mutual friend as that relationship is very important to me, and I would like to maintain a friendship with the guy if I can

TLDR: I feel like I‚Äôm emotionally cheating on my BF because feelings for an old crush are starting to come back

1jmyt8f,https://i.redd.it/xjz1rl77npre1.jpeg,Cheapest Pods. $2.40 UuSD For 10.," Well I live in New Zealand. Our potato dollar is worth approx 0.57 USD. Nescafe pods here cost around $11+ for 10 so close to $7 usd. 

 Those Market Kitchen ones are $4 each or less than $2.40 usd. The two on the left are cheap supermarket ones $5.50 each so less than $3.30 usd. The two individual pods are some Italian  ones similar price to Nescafe ones. Very smooth but lacking bite. 

 Cheap coffee but what's the point of it's bad? These are the best of the cheap ones we have found. They're not as good the best Nescafe ones but are better than the worst. Market kitchen Venice and the silver pack are decent by themselves. By themselves they're drinkable.

 I've been blending the other flavors with the Italuan ones. You end up with  a smooth coffee  with a bit more of a kick. 

Camping we took the old coffee machine with us. No complaints from coffee snobs we just didn't tell them what they were getting when we made coffee. Might be expensive one might be 23 cents a pod. 

 Shop may have stopped stocking the Market Kitche ones just as we started buying them on special at $4 nzd each. Not sure if they're getting more in. At full price they were $5 so less than $3.30 usd.",3,1743289665.0,nespresso,1,1.0,False

I would love to be your friend!","Did it work? I'm sure it worked if you're reading this! So hi, I'm BlueExodia0. I'm trying to remember back as to why I decided to choose this username, but I guess it was thought of out of boredom lol... Imagine if this was my real name.¬† I'm sure would be super annoying to write out on exams over and over and the teachers would have gotten a heart attack. At least people wouldn't butcher it like how they tend to do with my real name. We've all had that one teacher, right? If not, I'm sure a coffee shop like Starbucks comes up with a creative way to make that happen when writing our name on the cup.

Either way, I'm a 29 year old dude, living his life away on the east coast of the US. Like many of us here, we're looking for that one friend that will join us on our journey through life - someone we can truly get to know, bond with, and see develop over time. Sadly, when it comes to finding someone, I've had difficult luck. Feels like a lot of people lose interest very easily or stop replying as time goes on. I'm still holding on to the hope that there is someone out there that is interested in the real, genuine friendship and is willing to stick around. Life these last few years have gotten very lonely and it feels many people nowadays just aren't interested in putting in the effort to make things work or might easily jump to someone else :/ So I'm making this post in the hopes of making a new, long term friend, hoping this post might catch someone's eye!

I'm sitting here near my desk on a boring evening, composing a post to find that amazing, caring friend. A friend that is understanding, passionate, loyal, loving, and honest. Just all the beautiful, awesome qualities we would like to find in a best friend. Sure, trying to find someone online can be difficult or take a lot of effort, but I'm holding on to the hope that this catches the attention of someone that is really wanting to be buddies with a dude named BlueExodia0.

This is the part I talk a bit about myself. This part is usually what I tend to dread, especially during those ice breakers from the first day in our classes, but thankfully I have some time to think things out rather than be put on the spot. I'm sure most of us dread those...

* Living on a floating rock, revolving around the Sun. If you can guess the precise location, I'll be slightly freaked out but highly impressed!
* A generally quiet dude but can also be rather outgoing at times (especially online)
* I enjoy exploring about, especially in nature, beaches, old abandoned buildings inhabitant by ghosts
* A driven individual where I enjoy working towards the things I'm passionate about¬†¬†
* Respectful, honest (I suck at telling lies), a listener, enjoy being there for others, understanding, and caring
* Very single at the moment (not something I'm pushing for but if if there happens to be a connection, seeing that develop is something I'm not against)
* Enjoy various hobbies, such as reading novels, writing poetry, video editing, \*attempting\* cooking, gaming, and going to the gym

**What qualities do I look for in a friend?**

* Is a human and breathing üòÇ
* **An individual that sticks around. Not looking for someone that ghosts or disappears after a day or two. (I'm going to bold this statement because I know a lot of people simply stop caring after a day or want to jump to another person or not take the initiative to continue this because they simply get bored). Let's be real about our intentions :)**
* Puts effort into the conversation. Those one worded responses truly kill me sometimes. This helps us keep engaged and learn more about one another!
* An understanding and caring individual

I'll start:

Autistic people
- Trains
- Supply Chain/logistics
- Traffic control/red light timing
- Has for sure worked retail and on some level found the structure of it soothing
- The One Safe Food
- Why Are the Lights So Noisy
- Needing to be outdoors = working as a National Park Ranger
- Bottomless pit of anger and frustration with the various injustices of the world

ADHD people:
- Artists/Writers/Chefs
- Coked-up Finance Bros who work miracles on stock market via ""vibes"" or utterly impoverished, no real middle ground
- Has for sure worked back of house restaurants and found 60+ hour weeks on their feet *energizing*
- Needing to be outdoors = cash gig as a roadie for an indie band
- Chaos gremlins with unrelenting insomnia

AuDHD people:
- Accountants
- Tech/IT
- Split between front of house restaurant and dorkier side of retail (ie radioshack and microcenter)
- Needing to be outdoors = running errands in a walkable neighborhood because routine exercise for the sake of exercise like at a gym is literally the worst thing ever but we fall apart without regular walkies
- Bottomless pit of existential dread
- Oh and insomnia too
- Will fight to the death for The Good Coffee",3,1743289359.0,adhdwomen,1,1.0,False
