I found someone at work that I thought I could get along with really well, at first‚Ä¶ we had lots of common interests etc. But then she started saying things that I didn‚Äôt like, like complaining about her sister to me, complaining about a new hire in her team that hadn't even stared yet, saying ""I cant expect the world to cater to my disabilities"" (I have never said that or expected that‚Ä¶). She's overall a nasty, negative person the more I've gotten to know her. 

I want to back out, but she's quite vindictive based on these red flags and we sometimes need to work together. It's a bit risky. I genuinely think she will be super nasty.

1gju3uh,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1gju3uh/very_very_bad_relationship_im_m29_and_she_f29_do/,"very very bad relationship.  I'm M29, and she F29. Do I deserve to be happy? am i a monster?","Our relationship was very complicated from the start. I'm M\[29\]s, and she F\[29\]s. At first we were friends, but from the very beginning I made it clear that I was interested in having a relationship with her. She said she wasn't ready because she had just come out of a complicated relationship. I decided to wait for her, because I felt something very strong (although I hadn't made it clear how strong the feeling was).

After almost a year, she approached me for a friendship with benefits. After a couple of months, we started to get involved sentimentally and finally started dating. However, during quiet conversations at the beginning of our relationship, I discovered that she had had intimate and even sentimental relationships with other people, including work colleagues, something she never told me when we were just friends. This deeply shook my trust in her, to the point where we had to have difficult conversations to try to understand the situation, but these conversations were never sincere on her part. She said that she had a deep friendship with me and that she didn't want to lose me, among other things that I knew weren't true.

From then on, I began to feel very insecure. There came a time when I said that we needed to break up or she would have to regain my trust. I said that maybe we should break up because, even though she hadn't done anything wrong, I couldn't control my feelings and the weight of that was too great. She decided to stay with me, even with my reservations. shee said that we didn't need to date and that we could just have a submissive relationship, a BDSM relationship, but I thought that wasn't healthy, cause we had a lot of feelings. However, our relationship ended up being very influenced by this.

Over time, I became completely lost in jealousy, and I knew she was lying to reassure me. When I asked her if she had seen the person she got involved with at work, she always said no, but that didn't make sense, since they worked in the same environment. I tried to end the relationship a few times, but she was too upset and I couldn't break it off. I asked her to avoid responding to certain people with whom she was still in contact. One day, I saw that she hadn't followed the agreement. She was at my house, working on my laptop in the living room, and I told her I was very upset and wanted her to leave. I went to the bedroom and ended up sleeping for over an hour; when I woke up, she was still there. I insisted that she should leave, but another hour passed and she was still there. I told her she was overstepping her bounds, grabbed my laptop to put it away and just then I heard a bang. She had thrown my desk onto the floor, breaking the fan. There was coffee and a broken cup on the floor.

I told her she had to leave and threw her out of the house.she held onto the door, and even though I didn't push, as I'm much bigger than her, when she let go of the door, she staggered and hit her head on the neighbor's door. I felt really bad about it... to the point of completely forgetting why I was upset, and I apologized profusely. She said that what I had done was absurd and that I should be arrested. I felt deeply sorry and she forgave me. I didn't bring it up again, but it became a horrible cycle.

She kept testing me and pushing the boundaries, breaking our agreements. I'd try to hold back, but she'd start, for example, crying and screaming in the bathroom, and I'd worry about the neighbors hearing. I would try to get her out of the bathroom, but similar scenes would repeat themselves. It was a cycle that seemed endless, and I felt like the worst person in the world. I always tried to end the relationship, but she blamed me intensely. She would say that she would make my life hell and, sometimes, that she would end her own life. She would hit me and tell me to hit back, to hit her, but I never did! All the incidents were accidents, although I carry a lot of guilt for not having contained myself better. I know I shouldn't have gotten involved in such a horrible cycle, but she was testing my limits and her hatred for me was growing.

I also started making the same mistakes, I also started threatening to hurt myself, I was feeling so much guilt, so much hurt. I didn't know what to do, I was deeply disgusted with myself.

She started to hit me hard when she was drinking, and sometimes she'd get on top of me. she'd stab me in the arm with a pen, hit me over the head with her fists several times. and I didn't do anything. I just stood there. she kept hitting me. and I kept kicking her out of the house... or holding her down wen she was very out of control and I was afraid she might hurt herself.... I regret it so much.... I should have realized my limits... I should never have started a relationship with her.

Everything became a cause for chaos, and my jealousy and insecurity were still present. Whenever I tried to talk about it, the result was more chaos. She kept lying to me, and I kept losing myself, until I finally broke up with her on our one-year anniversary. It was a horrible experience.

she said she would do anything to make my life a living hell... she said she wanted me to die, that I was a monster.

I don't know how to deal with it all now, or what she might say and do about me. I know I made a lot of mistakes and I have a lot of guilt. We were both going through each other's cell phones, and I started trying to control her every move. I always knew where she was, because I didn't trust her, because I knew she didn't really like me.

She also went through my cell phone... she also went through my things... my computer.

I was toxic, sending her millions of messages and calling her cell phone non-stop, always suspicious and weak. I feel ashamed of myself... very ashamed. The more I showed this weak side, the more she stepped on me and belittled me. I feel really bad about all this, I really do.

I broke up over two months ago. I tried to maintain a good relationship with her, I waited until she got involved with other people before I moved on. I told myself that I would suppress any feeling of control so that she could be happy and I would try to leave a good impression between us. I was very insecure and weak. ADHD didn't help either...

Anyway, I'm not afraid of her telling everyone that I'm a monster or saying how insecure and unresolved I am, because my judgment of myself is harsher than anything she could say. And it's all very confusing... very confusing.

tl;dr: ¬†I¬† had a toxic, trust- and jealousy-filled relationship with a friend that became romantic. After a year of manipulation, fights, from both, and attempts to break up, I ended it, but I‚Äôm now struggling with guilt and shame.",2,1730767049.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

Hi, 

I‚Äôm 34M from Britain (England). I‚Äôm open to meeting new people to hang out and socialise with, and making new friends. I am a caring, kind, honest, loyal, patient, and sociable person and it would be great to meet other people with the same qualities. It would be great to build close male friendships with other guys, where you can chat/call, and socialise in person. I am particularly keen to meet other guys from Britain, as it would be great to have a friend who is in same country geographically, and where you can chat and meet up in person  regularly where possible and do different social activities together, e.g going to gym/working out, playing sports together, going to socialise at pubs and restaurants etc, going out for coffee etc. 


If anyone is interested in chatting and looking for the same, please feel free to send me a message anytime. It would be great to hear from you, and connect.

The sun streamed through the break room windows at HEB as I stood there, coffee in hand, feeling content and almost invincible. Emily and I had just started planning our engagement; we daydreamed about our future‚Äîpicking out names for our future kids and laughing over silly things. That blissful moment felt like a cruel joke, quickly fading into shadows I had spent years trying to escape.

Then came that call in late August‚Äîthe one that shattered everything. I can still hear the tremor in Emily‚Äôs voice as she recounted the unimaginable horror she had endured. ‚ÄúI... I was raped,‚Äù she said, and my heart sank. The future we had envisioned‚Äîthe engagement, our life together‚Äîcrumbled in an instant, replaced by a darkness I didn‚Äôt know how to navigate.

In Texas, where we lived, the law was unforgiving. Emily‚Äôs pregnancy became a stark reminder of her trauma. It felt surreal that, despite the circumstances, she was forced to carry the child of her abuser. Watching her struggle day after day, I felt like the walls were closing in around us. What kind of world allows such cruelty? My own demons surfaced, reminding me of my childhood abuse, which had left scars I could never quite heal.

I had always been hesitant to engage physically in relationships, a reflection of my past. Emily and I had navigated our intimacy cautiously, always respecting each other‚Äôs histories. But now, as I watched her suffer, I felt helpless. I wanted to be the man she deserved, but my own trauma weighed heavily on me, like a backpack filled with stones.

As her pregnancy progressed, my life began to spiral. I had been busting my tail as a General Manager at HEB, juggling responsibilities and managing a team, but the stress of our situation hit me hard. Those sleepless nights, filled with worry about Emily‚Äôs mental health and our uncertain future, took their toll. When the call finally came that I was let go, it felt like the final nail in the coffin. I lost not just my paycheck but also my health insurance. How was I supposed to support my family now?

When our daughter, Sarah, was born in the cold grip of winter, I remember holding her tiny body, feeling both joy and overwhelming fear. I vowed to be her father, to love and protect her no matter what. But every coo and giggle from Sarah felt like a reminder of the darkness surrounding her existence. The medical bills piled up like a mountain, and with Emily still recovering from her trauma, I felt like I was sinking. I often found myself reflecting on my relationship with her, recognizing the bittersweet irony in being a father to a child conceived from violence. I was determined to love her fiercely, despite the circumstances of her birth.

In the quiet moments, when the world slowed down, I would watch Emily with Sarah. The bond they shared was beautiful, but it was also painful to witness Emily‚Äôs struggle to reconcile her trauma with motherhood. I did my best to support her, reassuring her that she wasn‚Äôt alone. We talked about the future, hoping for brighter days, but I could see the shadows of her past lingering in her eyes.

As the months passed, the financial strain became unbearable. I scrambled for work, taking odd jobs‚Äîdelivering food, doing handyman work, anything I could find‚Äîbut it was never enough to keep our heads above water. I felt like a failure‚Äîunable to provide for the woman I loved and the innocent child born into such tragic circumstances.

The laws that dictated Emily's choices felt like a cruel joke, punishing us for things beyond our control. I was left wrestling with a storm of emotions‚Äîanger, sadness, and a fierce determination to keep pushing forward despite everything. I wanted to be strong for Emily and Sarah, to be the father and partner they needed. I often reminded myself that love could be a source of strength, a guiding light through the darkest times.

Now, as I sit here, staring at the blank pages before me, I realize that my story is far from over. The struggles are ongoing, and every day feels like a battle. I still haven‚Äôt figured out how to manage the costs associated with Sarah‚Äôs care, let alone the stress that hangs over us like a dark cloud. But amidst the chaos, I have Emily and Sarah. They are my anchors, reminding me that even in the darkest times, love can carry us through.",1,1730765981.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False
1gjtlul,https://www.reddit.com/r/redscarepod/comments/1gjtlul/im_so_scared_for_tomorrow/,I'm so scared for tomorrow ,"For the past several months, I‚Äôve cultivated this persona of the ‚Äúundecided voter.‚Äù Living in a swing state, it was almost too easy, like slipping on an old coat that still fit perfectly, but felt heavier somehow. At first, it was a joke I thought. I‚Äôd post something deliberately vague on Facebook, like, ‚ÄúI just don‚Äôt know which way I‚Äôll go this time..."" but soon, messages would pour in from all directions, like a gentle but relentless rain.

People I hadn‚Äôt spoken to in years‚Äîold friends, exes, former coworkers‚Äîsuddenly felt compelled to reach out. Each one wanted to be the hand that pulled me into the light, as if my uncertain vote might alter the course of the universe. And with each message, each earnest appeal, I felt myself lifted by their urgency, their desire to convince me. I began to savor the sensation. It reminded me of the feeling I had as a child, as though the whole class had turned to me, waiting in silent suspense for my answer.

It became‚Ä¶ addictive. The texts, the voice notes, even the occasional invitation to coffee ‚Äújust to hear my thoughts.‚Äù I ended up sleeping with exes for both candidates. I was the enigma in their predictable lives, the undecided, the swayable one. For the first time in years, I was visible in a way I hadn‚Äôt realized I craved.

But now, with election day approaching, I‚Äôm paralyzed. I have to choose. And I know that once I cast my ballot, the game is over. The messages will stop, and I‚Äôll slip back into the obscure stillness from which I came. It‚Äôs a hollowness I‚Äôm not sure I can face again.",18,1730765650.0,redscarepod,6,0.88,False
1gjtll1,https://www.reddit.com/r/pureretention/comments/1gjtll1/quitting_the_internet_for_now_here_are_some_good/,Quitting the internet for now. Here are some good habits from me.,"Hello guys. I am going to take a break from Reddit and all social media/online things because I want to focus on getting myself together and I feel that these are no longer helping me but rather just serving as distractions that I hide myself in. No doubt these retention subs have helped me the most of anything online but I spend too much time online overall anyways so for now, I am going to stop and focus on real life.

I made a list of good habits to incorporate for myself but I thought I might as well give it back to the community since I have gained some good things from it and I want to spread some positive energy. Most of these aren‚Äôt anything big but making many small, good changes can only improve your life, right? Some or most things on my list, you might already do so you can just ignore those but I don‚Äôt do any of these good habits so I just wrote them all down to put them in stone for me to remind myself until they‚Äôre normal for me.

Anyways, I‚Äôm just making these changes all of a sudden because I‚Äôm a bit sad and feel my life isn‚Äôt going the way I like, so I need to take some steps in the right direction, little by little, and that will overall improve my life instead of me just stagnating. All of the little efforts add up and hopefully will help you and I feel more fulfilled.

Simple things but they all help, do as many as you can.

1 - Obviously retention.

2 - Breathwork and full body stretches (yoga I suppose) before bed.

3 - Only lukewarm showers at best and in both the morning and at night instead of just once a day.

4 - Gym 7 days a week - for me it‚Äôs possible to go that often because it‚Äôs close by but if you aren‚Äôt able to, just go as often as you can. I‚Äôve been training 5 times a week but it‚Äôs not enough because I get bursts of energy where I just want to do something physical.

5 - Wave at the people you want to talk with (social anxiety for me).

6 - Only healthy food, no junk whatsoever, not even small amounts. I know some people like to give themselves a treat once in a while and I used to do this but I find that once you get that hit of dopamine, you start craving not only more of the junk you ate but also other nutritionally empty junk foods, it‚Äôs best to just avoid this cascade effect because none of it is good for your body.

7 - No cheap entertainment like TV or scrolling that doesn‚Äôt benefit you in any way - only spend productive time on hobbies (chess for me) when you genuinely have free time and aren‚Äôt neglecting yourself and hiding away in the hobby just to burn time.

8 - Clean your surroundings at least once a week.

9 - Replace coffee with a healthy tea. I don‚Äôt believe that caffeine is good for the body and brain, and it‚Äôs withdrawal effects are proof of that. It is a potent substance if your body becomes accustomed to it, people just treat it like it‚Äôs mild because everyone drinks it. It‚Äôs not needed if you take care of your energy levels otherwise. 

10 - Routine sleeping schedule. Wake up at the same time every day and preferably earlier, and try allow natural light in to your room so your circadian rhythm aligns with sunrise, you feel happier in the morning and less fatigued in the day.

11 - Pray and meditate.

12 - Let go of attachments.

13 - As soon as you sense a negative emotion like anxiety, doubt, worry, fear, stress etc coming on, immediately shut that down before it takes over your mind.

14 - Stop thinking bad of others. Whether it‚Äôs justified or not, it‚Äôs irrelevant to you and just lowers your own energy. Rather just say nothing and ignore those thoughts than actively put out bad energy.

15 - Have some sort of purpose to devote yourself to, whatever it may be.

16 - Wind down by reading even just a few pages of an unfamiliar book.

Thank you all for reading and contributing knowledge to me in other posts. I think this path is not easy for any of us because we are actively going against what most people and society as a whole do. but I truly wish all of you the best and I hope things improve for me too. :)

1gjtk9u,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1gjtk9u/finally_sharing_outside_of_my_support_network/,Finally sharing outside of my support network,"I remember a bright summer day just weeks before the call from my fianc√©, when everything seemed perfect. The sun streamed through the break room windows at HEB as I stood there, coffee in hand, feeling content and almost invincible. Emily and I had just started planning our engagement; we daydreamed about our future‚Äîpicking out names for our future kids and laughing over silly things. That blissful moment felt like a cruel joke, quickly fading into shadows I had spent years trying to escape.

Then came that call in late August‚Äîthe one that shattered everything. I can still hear the tremor in Emily‚Äôs voice as she recounted the unimaginable horror she had endured. ‚ÄúI... I was raped,‚Äù she said, and my heart sank. The future we had envisioned‚Äîthe engagement, our life together‚Äîcrumbled in an instant, replaced by a darkness I didn‚Äôt know how to navigate.

In Texas, where we lived, the law was unforgiving. Emily‚Äôs pregnancy became a stark reminder of her trauma. It felt surreal that, despite the circumstances, she was forced to carry the child of her abuser. Watching her struggle day after day, I felt like the walls were closing in around us. What kind of world allows such cruelty? My own demons surfaced, reminding me of my childhood abuse, which had left scars I could never quite heal.

I had always been hesitant to engage physically in relationships, a reflection of my past. Emily and I had navigated our intimacy cautiously, always respecting each other‚Äôs histories. But now, as I watched her suffer, I felt helpless. I wanted to be the man she deserved, but my own trauma weighed heavily on me, like a backpack filled with stones.

As her pregnancy progressed, my life began to spiral. I had been busting my tail as a General Manager at HEB, juggling responsibilities and managing a team, but the stress of our situation hit me hard. Those sleepless nights, filled with worry about Emily‚Äôs mental health and our uncertain future, took their toll. When the call finally came that I was let go, it felt like the final nail in the coffin. I lost not just my paycheck but also my health insurance. How was I supposed to support my family now?

When our daughter, Sarah, was born in the cold grip of winter, I remember holding her tiny body, feeling both joy and overwhelming fear. I vowed to be her father, to love and protect her no matter what. But every coo and giggle from Sarah felt like a reminder of the darkness surrounding her existence.

Hi, 

I‚Äôm 34M from Britain (England). I‚Äôm open to meeting new people to hang out and socialise with, and making new friends. I am a caring, kind, honest, loyal, patient, and sociable person and it would be great to meet other people with the same qualities. It would be great to build close male friendships with other guys, where you can chat/call, and socialise in person. I am particularly keen to meet other guys from Britain, as it would be great to have a friend who is in same country geographically, and where you can chat and meet up in person  regularly where possible and do different social activities together, e.g going to gym/working out, playing sports together, going to socialise at pubs and restaurants etc, going out for coffee etc. 


If anyone is interested in chatting and looking for the same, please feel free to send me a message anytime. It would be great to hear from you, and connect.

I spent a little bit of time reading some posts here during the weeks in between scheduling it and the big day, but ultimately made myself take a break just to get in the right headspace.

Now that I‚Äôm nearing the end of day 4 (surgery day not included) I thought that sharing my experience might help anyone else who is currently feeling the way I was a week ago.

The night before your surgery, you will struggle to sleep. I accepted that this would be the case for myself and honestly just knowing that I‚Äôd have a hard time sleeping helped ease my anxiety about not sleeping‚Ä¶like reverse psychology or something lol.

If you‚Äôve never had surgery before (like me) it‚Äôll seem pretty daunting going into the hospital. I didn‚Äôt really know what to expect. I was so thankful to be surrounded by a hospital staff that was so kind and gave me a bazillion opportunities to ask questions, and offered me every comfort they were able to give.

Immediately after surgery coming out of anesthesia was a little scary. I wanted to hold someone‚Äôs hand, so I asked a nurse and she held my hand until I fell back asleep. I met every member of the surgery team before going in, so seeing them afterwards was comforting. 

I got into my regular hospital room about an hour after coming out of surgery. I was still super sleepy, and just dozed as my partner and mom visited. My vitals were monitored every hour for 4 hours and pain meds were administered thru my IV. I ate some really horrible hospital food‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd recommend yogurt, pudding, soup‚Ä¶ something moist, because my mouth was insanely dry from the anesthesia.

My first visit to the potty had me nearly pass out. I was able to pee but then had to lay another hour and a half in bed before trying again. The second time standing up I was able to stand stably and didn‚Äôt feel light headed.

I was discharged approximately 9 hours after coming out of surgery. Riding in the car was NOT FUN but I did have a hysterectomy pillow that I was thankful for.

Night 1: Slept well and long. Had to wake my partner to help me to the bathroom around 4am.

Day 1: Had a 2.5 hour nap about 3 hours after waking. Walked down the hallway and back. So. Tired. Alternating Tylenol and ibuprofen every 3 hours, hydrocodone before bed.

Night 2: struggled to sleep. I wanted to lay on my side so bad but was scared. Decided to put on some high waisted bike shorts and welcomed the comfort of the slight compression.

Day 2: Felt a bit energetic. Drank coffee which got a BM to happen so I felt great, so I walked to the end of the street and back, then took a shower. This was too much for one day. I needed a 2 hour nap that afternoon and ended up taking a hydrocodone at 5pm because I was hurting. It did feel nice to shower though! 

Day 3: Woke up even more sore than the day before. This was when I knew I overdid it. I got a little mentally down because I was frustrated at myself for not resting for strictly. Took a hydro around 5pm again and ended up sleeping for 13 hours!

Which brings me to today: Very tired. My entire core feels tired. I said to my partner it feels like after you‚Äôve had the flu and thrown up 6 times in 2 hours. My abs are a little fluttery from time to time. I forced myself to be horizontal for the majority of the day today. I did shower again but it was quick and I didn‚Äôt wash my hair. 

Things I‚Äôve been glad I have:
-Hysterectomy pillow, multiple squishmallows, wedge pillow, an oversized soft comfy tshirt gown, a zip-up robe, and my emotional support cookiebara from Build a Bear that I got a few days before surgery haha.

If I‚Äôve learned anything it‚Äôs that healing won‚Äôt be consistently better each day, and you have to listen to your body!! Looking forward to the next weeks+months+years of a uterus/cervix-free life ü•∞",5,1730765057.0,hysterectomy,0,1.0,False

# Humans are Weird ‚Äì Blood in the Water

Quilx‚Äôtch was quite muzzy from sleep and stared down in perplexity at the water catch basin in front of him. He hiked up his comforter around him, blocking off the fuzzy view of the rest of the massive cleansing room provided for human use. The catch basin really should not be that color, he finally decided, feeling a bit proud of himself for forcing the thought up through layers of sleep deprivation. A stray thought thread suggested that he really should have petitioned the central university for this sector for that assistant when he had the chance, but the blood-berries had been blooming in the south slopes and none of the preservation techniques this base had access to would have preserved the protein structures quite right.

Quilx‚Äôtch brushed the pad of one paw over his primary eyes to dismiss the stray wisps of thought.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm getting as bad as Human Friend Scotty,‚Äù he said ruefully.

Another stray thought tried to lead him down the path of wondering if human behavior contain was playing a role in his current state.

‚ÄúIt was not as if my University time showed much better behavior,‚Äù he clicked to himself idly.

Bloodberries. Yes, the humans called them that because their eyes showed the glittering orbs as a single color. They claimed it was the same color as their primary circulatory fluid. Now, Quilx‚Äôtch wondered why he was thinking of that as he stared down at the discolored catch basin.

The material for the catch basin had been harvested from the local rocks. Human Friend Scotty had eagerly explained the process.

‚ÄúWe used to have to carve things like this out of larger chunks of rock,‚Äù the human had said. ‚ÄúNow we just grind up the fragments til we get the size we want and then we micro-compress them into shape. Folks like it because it looks like rough granite, smooth with shiny bits inside‚Äù

Quilx‚Äôtch now stared at the shiny bits visible under the coating of fluid.

‚ÄúI think,‚Äù Quilx‚Äôtch said to himself, feeling a bit uneasy. ‚ÄúThe humans would also call that blood red.‚Äù

He pondered what the substance might be as he walked across the edge of the cold catch basin to gather up his grooming brush and chelicerae pick. He gently pushed the comforter back, letting the harsh cleansing room light sting his secondary eyes as he gently brushed out his hairs. He found his gaze repeated drawn back to the layer of bio-matter, or at least he thought it was bio-matter, in the catch basin. Usually Human Friend Scotty was quite careful about cleaning up after himself. So it might not be biomatter after all. Though Quilx‚Äôtch couldn‚Äôt imagine what Human Friend Scotty would have been doing this early in the morning in the cleansing room. His grooming finished he gathered up his comforter and trotted out to the main sleeping area, massive to his scale, but seeming quite filled by the mass of the human who was currently wriggling into his day clothes.

Quilx‚Äôtch scampered over the spider-walk along the wall and tucked his comforter back into his hammock while Human Friend Scotty arranged his protective outer layers against his hairless skin. That task seemingly complete the human reached down for his foot armor and proceed with a Trisk-check. Quilx‚Äôtch couldn‚Äôt help chuckling anew at that. Why the humans were, to a person, convinced that his kind liked to hide in there foot armor was a mystery, but one that provided far too much amusement on distant base to be probed into too abruptly. That final ceremony over Human Friend Scotty set his binocular vision sniping around the room to locate him.

Quilx‚Äôtch waved to catch the humans attention.

‚ÄúTiny spider friend on his bunk,‚Äù the human stated in the dim but satisfied tone of one fulfilling a checklist.

‚ÄúHuman Friend Scotty,‚Äù Quilx‚Äôtch interjected.

He knew that if he did not catch the human‚Äôs attention quickly at this time of day nothing would keep the human from bolting for the coffee that was brewing in the cafeteria once Human Friend Scotty had located him.

Now the human visible paused in his preparation to lumber out the door of their room.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs up little guy?‚Äù the human asked, fighting back a yawn.

‚ÄúWhy is the catch basin in the cleansing room the color of bloodberries?‚Äù Quilx‚Äôtch asked.

Human Friend Scotty blinked slowly as he processed the question. Then his face flexed and his chin lifted with a grin as he clearly parsed the answer.

‚ÄúI forgot to rinse out the sink after brushing my teeth this morning!‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSorry bud!‚Äù

The human turned swiftly and went into the cleansing room, which soon emitted the sounds of rushing water. The human came out still grinning.

‚ÄúAll clean!‚Äù He declared. ‚ÄúWon‚Äôt happen again!‚Äù

‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù Quilx‚Äôtch said, feeling distinctly uneasy now. ‚ÄúHowever that was not my question.‚Äù

‚ÄúThecolor?‚Äù Human Friend Scotty asked in surprise. ‚ÄúThat was just my blood.‚Äù

The human stared at him with expectancy as he waited the polite six seconds to reply. Quilx‚Äôtch felt himself ‚Äúpuffing up‚Äù as the humans called it and Human Friend Scotty‚Äôs expression rapidly morphed form expectant to concerned.

‚ÄúWhy,‚Äù Quilx‚Äôtch asked carefully, ‚Äúwere you bleeding into the catch basin this morning as you cleaned your teeth.‚Äù

Human Friend Scotty‚Äôs face lit up with in the way that Quilx‚Äôtch was beginning to understand meant the human had an easy answer to a question.

‚ÄúYou remember I accidentally broke my sonic cleaner?‚Äù he asked.

Quilx‚Äôtch replied in the affirmative. Watching the human first fumble and drop the item on the floor. Then kick it into the far wall, only to finally step on it, damaging both the device and his foot in the process had been very educational on the value of the spider walks the humans insisted on installing in jointly occupied bases.

‚ÄúAnd I told you that I would be switching to the old fashioned method of teeth cleaning?‚Äù Human Friend Scotty went on.

‚ÄúMechanical friction and chemical layering with a brush applicator,‚Äù Quilx‚Äôtch replied, bobbing his head in a yes gesture.

‚ÄúWell, you always bleed a little when you switch back,‚Äù Human Friend Scotty said with a dismissive wave of his hand. ‚ÄúSorry I forgot to warn you about it, and sorry I forgot to clean my blood out of the sink after.‚Äù

Human Friend Scotty seemed to consider this revelation the end of the conversation and without waiting so much as a second for a response turned and left the room, presumably in search of coffee. Quilx‚Äôtch paused, waiting for him to come back and explain...something...anything more about the situation. But the door of their room stayed stubbornly closed.

Quilx‚Äôtch took a deep breath and ran his paws over his primary eyes.

‚ÄúRight,‚Äù he said to the empty air. ‚ÄúFirst I will speak to the base medic. Then breakfast.‚Äù

Quilx‚Äôtch was quite muzzy from sleep and stared down in perplexity at the water catch basin in front of him.

He gently pushed the comforter back, letting the harsh cleansing room light sting his secondary eyes as he gently brushed out his hairs. He found his gaze repeated drawn back to the layer of bio-matter, or at least he thought it was bio-matter, in the catch basin. Usually Human Friend Scotty was quite careful about cleaning up after himself. So it might not be biomatter after all. Though Quilx‚Äôtch couldn‚Äôt imagine what Human Friend Scotty would have been doing this early in the morning in the cleansing room. His grooming finished he gathered up his comforter and trotted out to the main sleeping area, massive to his scale, but seeming quite filled by the mass of the human who was currently wriggling into his day clothes.

Quilx‚Äôtch scampered over the spider-walk along the wall and tucked his comforter back into his hammock while Human Friend Scotty arranged his protective outer layers against his hairless skin. That task seemingly complete the human reached down for his foot armor and proceed with a Trisk-check. Quilx‚Äôtch couldn‚Äôt help chuckling anew at that. Why the humans were, to a person, convinced that his kind liked to hide in there foot armor was a mystery, but one that provided far too much amusement on distant base to be probed into too abruptly. That final ceremony over Human Friend Scotty set his binocular vision sniping around the room to locate him.

Quilx‚Äôtch waved to catch the humans attention.

‚ÄúTiny spider friend on his bunk,‚Äù the human stated in the dim but satisfied tone of one fulfilling a checklist.

‚ÄúHuman Friend Scotty,‚Äù Quilx‚Äôtch interjected.

He knew that if he did not catch the human‚Äôs attention quickly at this time of day nothing would keep the human from bolting for the coffee that was brewing in the cafeteria once Human Friend Scotty had located him.

Now the human visible paused in his preparation to lumber out the door of their room.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs up little guy?‚Äù the human asked, fighting back a yawn.

‚ÄúWhy is the catch basin in the cleansing room the color of bloodberries?‚Äù Quilx‚Äôtch asked.

Human Friend Scotty blinked slowly as he processed the question. Then his face flexed and his chin lifted with a grin as he clearly parsed the answer.

‚ÄúI forgot to rinse out the sink after brushing my teeth this morning!‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSorry bud!‚Äù

The human turned swiftly and went into the cleansing room, which soon emitted the sounds of rushing water. The human came out still grinning.

‚ÄúAll clean!‚Äù He declared. ‚ÄúWon‚Äôt happen again!‚Äù

‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù Quilx‚Äôtch said, feeling distinctly uneasy now. ‚ÄúHowever that was not my question.‚Äù

‚ÄúThecolor?‚Äù Human Friend Scotty asked in surprise. ‚ÄúThat was just my blood.‚Äù

The human stared at him with expectancy as he waited the polite six seconds to reply. Quilx‚Äôtch felt himself ‚Äúpuffing up‚Äù as the humans called it and Human Friend Scotty‚Äôs expression rapidly morphed form expectant to concerned.

‚ÄúWhy,‚Äù Quilx‚Äôtch asked carefully, ‚Äúwere you bleeding into the catch basin this morning as you cleaned your teeth.‚Äù

Human Friend Scotty‚Äôs face lit up with in the way that Quilx‚Äôtch was beginning to understand meant the human had an easy answer to a question.

‚ÄúYou remember I accidentally broke my sonic cleaner?‚Äù he asked.

Quilx‚Äôtch replied in the affirmative. Watching the human first fumble and drop the item on the floor. Then kick it into the far wall, only to finally step on it, damaging both the device and his foot in the process had been very educational on the value of the spider walks the humans insisted on installing in jointly occupied bases.

‚ÄúAnd I told you that I would be switching to the old fashioned method of teeth cleaning?‚Äù Human Friend Scotty went on.

‚ÄúMechanical friction and chemical layering with a brush applicator,‚Äù Quilx‚Äôtch replied, bobbing his head in a yes gesture.

‚ÄúWell, you always bleed a little when you switch back,‚Äù Human Friend Scotty said with a dismissive wave of his hand. ‚ÄúSorry I forgot to warn you about it, and sorry I forgot to clean my blood out of the sink after.‚Äù

Human Friend Scotty seemed to consider this revelation the end of the conversation and without waiting so much as a second for a response turned and left the room, presumably in search of coffee. Quilx‚Äôtch paused, waiting for him to come back and explain...something...anything more about the situation. But the door of their room stayed stubbornly closed.

Quilx‚Äôtch took a deep breath and ran his paws over his primary eyes.

‚ÄúRight,‚Äù he said to the empty air. ‚ÄúFirst I will speak to the base medic. Then breakfast.‚Äù

I‚Äôve tried everything skincare wise and have a super simple routine, nothing I have tried has made really any difference. I switched to tide free and gentle, i tried to switch shampoo/conditioner, i tried clindamycin gel, peroxide, sulfur, azelaic acid, salicylic acid. I‚Äôve tried using nothing. I‚Äôve changed my diet.

1gjt6wz,https://i.redd.it/2ne65hvh3zyd1.jpeg,Podcast thoughts ,"This week I really struggled to get through the podcast episode. It took me several days to even finish it. I found myself incredibly triggered for most of the time while I was listening, and simply don‚Äôt have it in me to do a full recap the way that I normally do for this episode, so I will just share my thoughts..

First off, Rachel is a liar and she can‚Äôt get her story straight! She admits here that this party was prepared MANY weeks in advance and that she had a lot of help. But in previous story/podcast episodes she made it sound like it was such an impromptu casual event. She also said In this episode thay they got to the airport early, but on the day of departure she posted a story saying that they should‚Äôve been on the way to the airport already and here Dennis is making coffee - so which is it?? were you early or were you late? Honestly, these details that she lets slip show what a liar She is and it really pisses me off. Because if you are lying about such a little insignificant details, what else are you lying about? ü§îü§®

Honestly, listening to someone who is about to go on their fifth vacation of the year talking about ‚Äúfalling apart‚Äù was just so incredibly frustrating to listen to, especially for those of us who have not yet been on even one vacation this year, while working full-time. I just simply do not have any pity or sympathy for her complaining. 

My conclusion after FINALLY getting through this podcast is that Dennis is a useless, lazy jerk. But Rachel is also an impossible person to live with and I feel like they both deserve each other in a way. their dynamic is just so incompatible and toxic! I don‚Äôt pity her at all. 

I also could never imagine speaking about my husband‚Äòs shortcomings in public this way - that‚Äôs just not how we are in our marriage. complaining about your spouse and making fun of them in a public space the way she constantly does is not something I personally agree with. 

I am in no way defending Dennis at all by the way. if the things that she said in this episode are in fact true, then he‚Äôs an even bigger dickhead than I thought he was. 

I also rolled my eyes to the back of my head while she was talking about how Lea is ‚Äúa perfect, blonde and blue eyed girl - a predators dream‚Äù and how afraid she is of her getting kidnapped, and how she air tagged her kids - but at the same time she posts their exact location in real time While traveling, she broadcasts the fact that her daughter is sleeping outside, that she takes the bus on her own and walks through the forest/field alone on her way back from school. and she lets her hang out with a group of strange adults on a beach in the evening. it just doesn‚Äôt make any sense to me! 

So yeah, in conclusion, I think that as per usual, she is just sensationalizing and dramatizing something that happened to garner maximum engagement and to get pity from her listeners. She loves being the victim and while I do believe that Dennis is a jerk I also think that Rachel is just as bad as he is - if not worse. 

My biggest take away from this episode is that what Rachel REALLY needs is therapy!! The things that she brings up in this episode - the dark thoughts, the spiraling, the past traumas that caused her to have these fears - all of this she has obviously not processed and worked through yet, and for someone who advertises a therapy platform on her podcast every single week this is just fucking mind blowing to me, and she is in no way qualified to hold any ‚Äúsharing circles‚Äù where people open up and speak about their traumas. She does not have the skills to hold space for these people and it‚Äôs so dangerous that she‚Äôs even considering to do this! ",7,1730764514.0,rachelbrathensnark,2,1.0,False

1gjt0c4,https://www.reddit.com/r/GacharicSpin/comments/1gjt0c4/halfway_to_the_beyond_lyric_essay/,"Halfway, To the Beyond lyric essay","*Well, in Today's Song, we will be bringing you lyric essays by Gacharic Spin for three consecutive weeks! This is the first installment. The writing was done by Oreo Reona. The story she wrote is about the song ""Halfway, To the Beyond"". ""Do you have any dreams that you have? Are you talking about your dream right now?"" Please take a look at the essay along with the lyrics.*

Before I knew it, I had reached the age of being considered an adult.

First of all, what is an adult?  
Someone who is good at their job, trusted by those around them, knows the taste of coffee, can buy pretty much anything they like, and yes, even their dreams come true. Or rather  
Adults are the ones making their dreams come true.  
Someday they will all be what I pictured, or so I thought.

Throughout my teens and twenties, I loved movies and identified with the main characters, sometimes even living my life as them or deciding my career path as them.

On days when it was a love story and it had a bad ending, I would remember it over and over again and cry.  
If you want to spice up your daily life, try provoking a fight with your partner by making up some excuse.  
Unable to contain his excitement at the movie theater, he calls someone who isn't yet his girlfriend, saying ""I want to see you right now!"", only to be turned down, and has to be comforted by his female friends.  
Anyway, they were troublesome creatures.

But I was living life to the fullest. Honest to my feelings.  
I wasn't aware of it, but looking back, I can say that that was the case every day.

Of course, I had dreams back then too.  
When asked, ""What is your dream?"" I was able to answer correctly.  
At that time, I was already a member of a band, so something related to music, something to do with the movies I loved, and living happily with my lover were all part of my dreams.

However, at some point, I stopped talking about those dreams.  
In fact, I was afraid to speak of them.  
It feels like there's no need to go out of your way to give up, because the fact is that this ""unfulfilling reality"" is here and now.

One day, I watched a movie called ""Halfway"" that I used to be obsessed with.  
Watching it now, it seems a little embarrassing, a cute love story of a young age.  
At the time, my mind was going round and round with this movie.  
I was sensitive then, and more than anything, I was honest about my feelings and thoughts.  
After watching it, I felt like I understood something I had been missing.

As we live, the things we value change. That's natural.  
You know that there are too many things to handle, and you fret, move forward and go back, but still live.  
I'm sure that even the small wishes and thoughts of everyday life can be called ""dreams"", we don't have to be at the mercy of some cursed ""the bigger the dream, the better"", or whatever the hell it is that someone has come up with.  
Don't miss those moments when your heart is slightly moved.  
It doesn't matter how old you are. As long as you're alive, you're all in the middle of your life.

To the me of the past, to the precious people of the past. From me.

My self-esteem is down at the moment.üòï I don't know what happened to my chin. It started with one or two pustules after using allulose (artificial sweetener)last week. I stopped using allulose and the pustule seemed to dry up. And then 2 days after, I drank lemonsito juice (just the juice and water, no sugar or anything) and it flared up again.

I stopped drinking the lemonsito juice and it got better but the pustules are still there. I thought I'm going to get better so on the days forward, I drank fruit shakes, ate eggs, ate chicken in heavy cream, ate sweetened anchovies, and drink at least 250ml of full fat milk. Mind you, I am not allergic to eggs as I eat 4 of them daily. I am not also allergic to dairy as I usually put heavy cream or full fat milk on my coffee. But right now, though, I am so lost about this. The pustules have been getting worse for the 2 mornings that I've woken up.

I've put salicylic acid cream with niancinamide on the pustules that is why it looked white. I also bought ultra mild oxecure ultra mild cleanser thinking that it might help. üòïüòïüòï But alas, I no longer know what would help.

The group will consist of my girlfriends and their partners/boyfriends and like 2 of my boyfriend‚Äôs friends. We are all in our mid 20s. For such a large group, I feel like I‚Äôm looking for a unicorn üò≠ PLS HELP üò≠

* **What I‚Äôm looking for:** 
   * needs to have GOOD food. TASTY! Ideally, normal portion sizes? I don't want my guests won‚Äôt feel like they‚Äôre starving. 
   * pretty or at least FUN. I want to get some cute pictures. THOUGH if a place is prettier than it is fun I‚Äôd take that lol.
   * relatively economical? 
   * **Overall:** This seems like one of those venn diagrams where you can only have two of the three things I listed but not all at once lol. 

**Context:** we will be clubbing the night before so I thought brunch the next morning (Sunday) would be good. 

**My dilemma - boozy or not?:** My group is mixed between light drinkers (around 8 people. would drink a cocktail in front of them but then also have a tea or coffee), moderate (could throw a few back because its brunch! 2-3 people), and then former (albeit nerdy) frat boys lol (6 people). I don't know what to do... I think ideally? I wouldn't care if it wasn't a boozy brunch but if we could order cocktails ourselves or get a pitcher and share.  But since we will have gone clubbing literally the night before, I don't think many of my light drinkers will be drinking again so my moderate to heavy drinkers would have to chug a lot down to make a bottomless brunch worthwhile...

**Location:** looking for places in Manhattan but open to going to BK and Queens if the place is highly recommended or pretty. I was looking at Milk&Roses even though it‚Äôs Greenpoint and a bit of trek for me to get to but it‚Äôs just so pretty!

**Budget:** would like to not break the bank. Open to 30-60 pp or MAX 85 if it were like a prefix with a shit ton of food w drinks.

**Cuisine:** open to all. My group has no dietary restrictions.

**Timeline:** we are about a month away! So I have time to plan things :-) ",1,1730763591.0,NYCbitcheswithtaste,0,1.0,False

hello,

so in the process of researching how to heal my laundry list of symptoms i have begun supplementation for my deficiencies, neurological symptoms and hair loss. based on your own personal routines, do you think I am missing anything? i am a 25 year old woman, healthy weight. I am really motivated to heal myself and one day be able to help others with all that I am learning. i never want to feel this shitty again.

Daily:

* **2x weekly vitamin B12 shots (started yesterday) --> hoping to go from 275 to >900**
* **vitamin d3 (nature's bounty 5000 IU) for vitamin D deficiency**
* hair vitamins ""sugarbearPRO"" (6000 mcg biotin, 2.4 mcg B12, 1.4 mcg B1) --> i rotate through brands like hims&hers etc
* pumpkin seed oil / pumpkin seeds for hair loss
* zinc 50 mg
* women's probiotic (physician's choice 50 billion CFU)
* **currently taking ferrous gluconate (324 mg) and vit C (500 mg) a few times a week for low ferritin, but my iron is already high. low ferritin / high iron (?)**
* **Spironolactone for accelerated hair loss and my high androstenedione (100 mg per day)**

currently holding off on: 1.25 mg minoxidil due to cardiac symptoms, bloat, and 10 lbs water weight gain within days of use few weeks ago.

Food diary:

I am eating 2,000 to 2,500 calories per day, fluctuating on exercise days. In general, i have an absorption issue because I eat very healthy and clean due to IBS already. I am 5'9 and 140 lbs.

* I start each morning with coffee, Chobani Greek yogurt and fruit, or fruit and peanut butter
* lunch i will incorporate fats such as Cashews/Walnuts, veggies and some sort of bowl/salad/sandwich
* Dinners i eat multiple vegetable servings (such as spinach, bok choy, sweet potatoes, asparagus, carrots, peppers) along with meat
* In general: i eat multiple servings of fruit and vegetables per day, i eat chicken and red meat multiple times per week, i also eat beans
* junk food: usually Goldfish, or Utz chips or popcorn with occasional ice cream
* **increasing the amount of steak and eggs i eat because of B12 issue**

My boyfriend (24 at the time) would go to McDonald's before work to grab breakfast and a coffee before work. He ordered a bagel breakfast sandwich, which usually comes as egg, bacon and/or sausage, and cheese on your choice of bagel, and 3 times in a row he received an untoasted bagel with a singular tomato and mayo. Usually he would just go through the drive through again, but he finally got fed up with it. He went into the McDonald's and asked for a manager. They were giving him the run around and he ended up yelling about his sandwich and I quote ""WHO THE HELL ORDERS A RAW BAGEL WITH TOMATO AND MAYO!"". He was then the story on the local radio station later as the man yelling at McDonald's about a sandwich and refered to as ""The Senator"".

1gjsoam,https://www.reddit.com/r/VisitingHawaii/comments/1gjsoam/kauai_trip_report/,Kauai - trip report...,"My wife and I are just back from a trip to Kauai.

Here are some random thoughts...

We stayed at the Waipouli Beach Resort and enjoyed it very much. The beach was nice and we enjoyed a watching the sun rise.  
Staying there put us close to the middle for the drives to points on the south and north sides of the island.  
We were right across from a Safeway, quick walk to stock up on food when we wanted.  
Also an easy walk to Kenji Burger, which my wife enjoyed.  
Collab Cafe, VIP Treats and Sweets, Ono Bar & Grill Indian, and Island Craves were good.  
Diamond Pizza was OK.  
LightWave Pottery is worth a visit.  
Downtown shops in Kapaa are worth a visit.  
We were on the bike path and rented bikes one day and rode north to visit the beaches along the way and  
did a side quest to hang out on Donkey Beach. (total of 6 people on the beach when we were there).

To the south...  
I made two trips to Waimea Canyon and Koke'e State Parks. Weekday not as crowded as weekend. I loved the lookouts. I also walked to the Pu'u O Kila lookout from Kalalau lookout. I would recommend hiking a little from Pu'u O Kila to Pihea Vista Junction, but not all the way. There are some good views, but the trail becomes a little nasty and I didn't think it was worth going to the junction or past it (wanting to see another lookout just turned into a boring hike). I didn't hike other trails in the parks because I don't deal well with elevation changes. I probably should have tried. Both nights were cloudless and I parked at the Waimea Canyon lookout for stargazing. Was able to see the Milky Way and the comet. And you get to hear the goats down in the valley. I got good picture of the comet and the milky way with my phone.  
Hanapepe Art Night: Get there early. I didn't think much of it.  
Hanapepe: MCS Grill and Unko's Kitchen are good.  
Kekaha Beach Park: If you have the time, interesting to look out at Ni'ihau.  
Kaua'i Coffee Company is good for a quick stop and self tour. We didn't go on the paid tour.  
McBryde & Allerton Tour: We both enjoyed this.  
Spouting Horn: Worth it if you are already close.  
Poipu Beach: Enjoyed. Gets crowded.  
Tidepools: We both enjoyed it.

To the north...  
Hanalei Beach: Enjoyed it. Large beach. Got to the Hanalei pavilion early. Then a quick drive to the shops.  
Chicken in a Barrel: I liked it.  
Anini Beach: Enjoyed it.   
Ha'ena State Park: We got the shuttle passes. I stopped quick at Ke'e Beach but didn't explore. We hiked to Hanakapi'ai Beach. I liked it the hike and the beach, My wife liked the beach and didn't like the hike. Didn't go to the falls.  
Princeville Botanical Gardens: Tour and chocolate tasting. We both enjoyed this.",6,1730763114.0,VisitingHawaii,0,1.0,False

1gjsn69,https://www.reddit.com/r/SgHENRY/comments/1gjsn69/what_is_the_true_rate_of_inflation_or_deflation/,What is the true rate of inflation or deflation that you experience for your basket of goods? ,"The CPI as calculated by the statutory bodies such as the Singapore Department of Statistics and the US Bureau of Labor Statistics are rates for the basket of goods that they select. This basket of goods could change over time or the price of different quality/brand of goods are used.

For people, the true rate of inflation is a personal. E.g., If they have already bought property, then the rising property prices do not affect them (for inflation) but they are affected by rising mortgage rates.

In retirement planning, the inflation rate needs to be taken into account. I believe it is important to consider the inflation on our basket of goods, not simply the general basket of goods as reflected in the CPI statistics. I fear my retirement calculation may be incorrect if I apply the incorrect inflation rate.

**Inflation**

Compared to 5 years ago:

\-a bunch of vegetables was 50-70 cents each. Today, the same bunch costs $1.20-1.50. A bowl of mee poh at the coffee shop was $3.50; Now it's $5 at the same shop. A cup of coffee/tea was $1.10; Now it's $1.40. Maximum bus fare was $1.40; Now it's closer to $2. Electricity and water cost more. Although these are small expenses, the frequency of payment is high so it feels like ""everything"" is more expensive.

\-Rent and property prices have increased substantially since covid occurred. My mortgage rate is 50% higher than before.

\-Price of buying and using a car has increased substantially. I do not own one and am only affected by higher taxi fares. I try to manage it by using ride-sharing when possible.

**Deflation, substitution and supply chain changes**

Many items including tours and tickets can be purchased from overseas on online platforms resulting in lower prices from the removal of the middle man.

Imports other than from the authorised reseller/agent sell for lower prices.

There are more budget airlines now than 15 years ago.

There are more house brands of better quality at supermarkets than before.

More vibrant 2nd hand marketplace to buy even brand new items.

Home broadband internet is much faster but cheaper now.

What is the true rate of inflation or deflation that you experience for your basket of goods (please state time horizon, e.g. past 5 years, 10 years)?

I do not track my spending so ball park is based on the largest expense which is mortgage and maintenance fees. I feel it's 10% per year over the past 5 years. When I apply this rate to my retirement calculator, the result looks disappointing. (Of course, I won't be paying mortgage forever but need to apply a figure closer to reality than the CPI)

Note: It can be argued that it's not that prices have increased but the value of the currency has decreased systematically. It is not the focus of this post but please feel free to share your thoughts.",1,1730763029.0,SgHENRY,4,0.57,False

If there is one thing I can recommend for tomorrow, November 5th - Election Day - it‚Äôs write it down.

Write it down in your Journal, in your Notes app, make a Voice Memo, film a video, take pictures. Do it all day. Note the time, where you are, the weather, who you‚Äôre with, the way the wind is blowing through the trees around you.

Record what time you woke up, how you‚Äôre feeling, what you‚Äôre wearing, what made you laugh, how many times you cried.

List the tasks you did at work, the number of reps at the gym, miles managed on the trail, the route you took to the store, how late you were getting to the meeting. Document who you talked to, what you were thinking, where you walked the dog and how the light of the hour impressed you.

Account for what you ate, what you drank  - how your coffee was made & tasted - sloshing into your rumbly tummy. 

Tomorrow holds the possibility of being a historic day in the United States. 

And, no matter the outcome, one of the best things you can do for History, for your families, especially if you have kids or nieces or neighbors - is write down how the day was for you.

If you worry you don‚Äôt want to remember anything from a day that may have a result that you absolutely cannot fathom - simply burn, delete or destroy anything you don‚Äôt want to keep. That might feel real good, too - in the aftermath.

It‚Äôs okay to have Hope, it‚Äôs okay to have Dread. It‚Äôs okay to be Nervous & Excited, a little bit Wary, and awfully fucking Tired.

What‚Äôs important is you write it down.

It‚Äôs been happening for weeks now‚Äîlong, dark stretches of the night where I lose myself. But the paintings keep coming. I used to think it was funny, my unconscious self sneaking out to create art. Until I noticed what I was painting.

The first was a man lying face down in an alley, his skull caved in. The brushstrokes looked almost‚Ä¶ tender, but his face was twisted in agony, blood pooling around him in thick, dark puddles. I didn‚Äôt recognize him, but a sick feeling twisted in my gut, like I‚Äôd seen him somewhere. I washed the brushes, cleaned up the mess, and told myself it was just a bad dream bleeding into my art.

Two days later, I saw him on the news. He was found dead, bludgeoned to death behind a bar. My stomach lurched. Coincidence, I thought. Just a horrible, impossible coincidence.

But then I painted the next one.

A woman this time, clutching her stomach, blood pooling around her feet. Her face was etched in terror, mouth open in a silent scream. The news story hit three days later‚Äîa woman stabbed outside her apartment, killed in a robbery gone wrong. Every stroke, every detail from my painting was there in that photo.

I started staying up late, trying to keep myself awake. I drank coffee until my hands shook, stared at my blank canvas, desperate to stay in control. But I couldn‚Äôt keep myself from slipping into that dark place, that trance where my hands worked like they had a mind of their own.

Last night was the worst.

I woke up with brushes scattered around me, paint smeared across my arms. On the canvas was a man I knew, someone I‚Äôd never wanted to hurt‚ÄîElliot, my ex.

1gjsfne,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1gjsfne/brush_with_death/,Brush with Death,"I wake up with red paint under my fingernails.

It‚Äôs been happening for weeks now‚Äîlong, dark stretches of the night where I lose myself. But the paintings keep coming. I used to think it was funny, my unconscious self sneaking out to create art. Until I noticed what I was painting.

The first was a man lying face down in an alley, his skull caved in. The brushstrokes looked almost‚Ä¶ tender, but his face was twisted in agony, blood pooling around him in thick, dark puddles. I didn‚Äôt recognize him, but a sick feeling twisted in my gut, like I‚Äôd seen him somewhere. I washed the brushes, cleaned up the mess, and told myself it was just a bad dream bleeding into my art.

Two days later, I saw him on the news. He was found dead, bludgeoned to death behind a bar. My stomach lurched. Coincidence, I thought. Just a horrible, impossible coincidence.

But then I painted the next one.

A woman this time, clutching her stomach, blood pooling around her feet. Her face was etched in terror, mouth open in a silent scream. The news story hit three days later‚Äîa woman stabbed outside her apartment, killed in a robbery gone wrong. Every stroke, every detail from my painting was there in that photo.

I started staying up late, trying to keep myself awake. I drank coffee until my hands shook, stared at my blank canvas, desperate to stay in control. But I couldn‚Äôt keep myself from slipping into that dark place, that trance where my hands worked like they had a mind of their own.

Last night was the worst.

I woke up with brushes scattered around me, paint smeared across my arms. On the canvas was a man I knew, someone I‚Äôd never wanted to hurt‚ÄîElliot, my ex. We‚Äôd broken up badly, yeah, but seeing him there, eyes wide, throat sliced open, his skin pale‚Ä¶ it broke something in me. My whole body felt cold, sick, like I was the one lying there.

This morning, I called him, my fingers shaking as I dialed. He didn‚Äôt answer.

Hours later, my phone buzzes‚Äîa breaking news alert. My hand hovers over the notification, heart pounding as I open it. There he is: Elliot, found dead in his apartment. They say he was alone. The police aren‚Äôt releasing details, but I know what happened.

I did this. I painted it, but I don‚Äôt remember‚Ä¶ I couldn‚Äôt have‚Ä¶

Or could I?

Tonight, I‚Äôm locking my studio door, chaining myself to the bed if I have to. I‚Äôm scared of myself, scared of my hands, scared of what I‚Äôll do if I slip under again. Because I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm dreaming these horrors‚Ä¶ or if I‚Äôm the one carrying them out.",12,1730762461.0,shortscarystories,2,1.0,False

# Creating Effective Prompts

To create an effective prompt, you need to clearly define what you expect from the AI model. 



Here are the key elements:

1. **Context**: 
   * Define who you are and what you need: ‚ÄúAs a math teacher, I need...‚Äù. 
2. **Objective**: 
   * Clearly define what you want to achieve: ‚ÄúThe goal is to explain...‚Äù 
3. **Specific Guidelines**: 
   * Specify the format, length and style of your answer: ‚ÄúPlease respond in bullet points, no longer than 300 words, in a formal style.‚Äù 
4. **Limitations**: 
   * Add any limitations or specifications: ‚ÄúFocus on examples from the last five years.‚Äù 

# EXAMPLE OF EFFECTIVE PROMPT

‚ÄúAs a newcomer to digital marketing, prepare a short guide to key marketing strategies for a small business. Include:

* Three key strategies 
* Examples of applications 
* Potential costs and benefits Format: list with brief descriptions Length: 500 words maximum Language: simple and easy to understand."" 

**GPT-4o**

**PERSONAL REFLECTION** 

In my experience, a well-formulated prompt is one that is precise yet allows for flexibility.   
It is often a good idea to start with a general prompt and gradually refine it based on the responses you receive.   
It is also important to test different approaches and learn from mistakes, which allows us to better understand how AI interprets our requests.

AND BONUS  MY QUESTION

Does the language in which I write the prompt affect the results ( in the sense, for example, of Polish instead of English)  ?

**Claude 3.5 Sonnet V2**

Yes, the language of the prompt is important for the quality of the answers you receive. Here is a detailed explanation:  
Differences between languages:



1. **English language:** 

* Highest accuracy of answers 
* The richest vocabulary 
* Best interpretation of nuances 
* Access to the most up-to-date information 
* Better understanding of the technical context 

1. **Language Polish:** 

* There may be some simplification of complex concepts 
* Sometimes there are less precise translations of technical terms 
* Smaller training database 
* Possible problems with idioms and specialized vocabulary 

# Examples of differences:

**Technical Prompt:**  
üá¨üáß ‚ÄúExplain the concept of neural networks in machine learning‚Äù

* More detailed and technically precise answer 
* Better examples and references 

üáµüá± ‚ÄúExplain the concept of neural networks in machine learning‚Äù

* May contain simplifications 
* Sometimes there are language calques 

# When to use which language:

**English best for:**

* Technical topics 
* Scientific topics 
* Latest trends 
* Specialized terminology 

**Polish better for:**

* Local contexts 
* Topics related to Polish culture 
* Everyday issues 
* When you care about the natural sound of the answer 

# Practical advice:

The best solution is often a hybrid approach:

1. Write the main prompt in English 
2. Add an instruction about the answer in Polish 
3. Use key terms in both languages 

Example:  
‚ÄúExplain the concept of machine learning, focusing on practical applications. Please provide the answer in Polish. Include key terms in both languages.‚Äù  


# My reflection:

In my experience, I have noticed that I get the best results when:

* I provide the key terms in both languages 
* I create the structure of the prompt in English 
* I ask for the answer in the target language 
* I use precise technical terms in English 

This provides the best balance between precision and usability of the answer.  


# Final Tip:

If you want maximum precision in a technical or scientific topic, consider writing the prompt in English and asking for the most important parts to be translated into Polish. This often gives the best results.",1,1730762373.0,ChatGPTPromptGenius,0,1.0,False

1gjs9kp,https://www.reddit.com/r/QuitVaping/comments/1gjs9kp/reasons_why_vaping_is_so_addicting/,Reasons why vaping is so addicting ,"Hey everyone, 
The other day I was thinking about the reasons why vaping is so addicting. Of course there are the more obvious reasons, such as nicotine, flavors, etc. But then I started thinking about the other factors that make vaping soooo addicting.

Here are the reasons why vaping was so addicting when I used to be a vaper:

-The nicotine (self explanatory)

-The flavor (you're addicted to your flavor of choice)

-The head rush/nicotine buzz feeling

-The feeling of it in your hand (they‚Äôre designed to be ergonomic)

-The look of it/color/screen (it‚Äôs crazy that vapes these days have little screens on them with a flame graphic that lights up when you take a hit, the neon colors they come in add to the addiction)

-The feeling of putting it to your mouth (oral fixation)

-The act of sucking (see above) 

-The feeling of inhaling 

-The feeling of exhaling and seeing smoke 

-Doing smoke tricks

-The ‚Äúrelaxed‚Äù feeling after hit

-Going outside and vaping (it‚Äôs habit forming to sit on your patio and vape, or vape anytime your outside for anything)

-Vaping with drinks such as coffee, tea, alcoholic drink, etc. (it‚Äôs very habit forming to vape with your morning coffee or evening cocktail) 

-Vaping while drinking/doing other substances
 
-Social vaping (vaping around other people who vape, passing a vape back and forth between a friend, vaping at social events, etc.)

-It‚Äôs addicting to always have one on you/in your bag 

-Buying a new one is addicting (the fresh hit of a brand new vape, opening the packaging, you get a hit of dopamine from spending money, going to the vape store, etc.)

-It‚Äôs addicting to try new flavors/brands  

-Vaping in the car (doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs a road trip or 5 minutes, you associate getting into your car and vaping)

-Vaping at work/on your break/lunch (you begin to associate vaping with taking a ‚Äúbreak‚Äù from whatever is going on) 

-vaping during sex (stacking already pleasurable things)

-Vaping while watching tv, on phone, playing video games (you get addicted to vaping while consuming any type of media; if you‚Äôre on the couch, your vaping) 

-The first hit of the day (the first hit of the day is addicting because you feel it the strongest because you just went 8 hours without a hit)

-The nicotine % (higher % is more addicting)

-Associating vaping with feelings of stress, anxiety, boredom, happiness, sadness (pretty much any emotion can be associated to vaping. Sad? I want to vape. Stressed? Vape. Happy? I‚Äôll feel even happier if I vape) 

-Vaping as a hunger suppressant/dependent on vapes in order to eat or be hungry

-Vaping on a schedule (you get into the habit of vaping at certain set times of the day, ie first thing in the morning, on your work breaks, after dinner, etc.) 

-Vaping while on vacation/trip (on vacation you want to have fun and let loose, which means also vaping) 

-Vaping thc/weed 

-Vaping in bed (being in bed means relaxation, which you associate with vaping)

Big love for music, arts, crappy cinema and animals. I'm fairly stationery as it's hard to find someone to take care of mine herd, but generally love trips&travel.

Currently focusing on healthier approach to life, lost 18kg (currently 95) at 186cm height and going down to 80, adding exercise other than doggo walko etc. Working also on my emotional/mind aspects, in therapy for improvement for over 2 years.

I'm calm in nature, love taking care of somebody especially in small aspects of life - like morning coffee or foot rub.

If you have life of your own, work remotely or want to escape current way of life to search for new personal challenges & projects, love spending time 'together but doing own thing' - hit me up!. I would like to think about you as 'self sufficient complete person' that could use some laughs when watching next crazy Nicolas Cage production.

I have no relationship or sexual expectations, just got trashed after very long term relationship so I would say - i'm grieving and generally mad, but I would consider this temporary.",0,1730761968.0,r4r,1,0.5,False
1gjs8wb,https://www.reddit.com/r/10s/comments/1gjs8wb/tennis_training_and_recovery_long_version/,Tennis Training and Recovery (Long Version),"**Stretch**

- The stretching techniques selected to promote post training or post-match recovery should aim to restore resting muscle length and a normal range of movement for joints, rather than aim to increase muscle length or joint range of movement.
- Stretching to improve flexibility, or developmental stretching, is best done as a separate and dedicated session when the player is not fatigued as there is less chance of exacerbating any residual micro trauma in muscles following heavy workloads. Ideally players should undertake some stretching in the evening while their muscles are still warm. This is an optimal time to apply stretching techniques that are designed to increase resting muscle length and joint range of movement.
- Long held static stretches and assisted stretches are ideal techniques to improve range of movement but these techniques can leave a muscle fatigued and result in decreased power and strength for up to an hour or more. As a result, they are best used at a time when the player can rest afterwards rather than being applied immediately before or after training or a match.

**Hydrotherapy**

- The immersion of a body in core-temp neutral (93F - 97F) water results in marked changes in the circulatory, pulmonary, renal and musculoskeletal systems. The effects have been shown to be most pronounced for whole body (head out) immersion. These studies have indicated that increased hydrostatic pressure leads to a shift of blood from the lower regions of the body to the thoracic region during immersion. This results in an increase in cardiac output and stroke volume but also to a decrease in systemic vascular resistance so that there is increased muscular blood flow without an increase in heart rate. With temperatures below 65F there is an increase in both heart rate and blood pressure. The combined effects of hydrostatic pressure and water temperature amplifies these changes.
- Alternating from cool to warm water immersion can accelerate metabolic activity as indicated by faster clearance of blood lactate and creatine kinase through an increase in muscle blood flow.
- A recent review of the medical literature has recommended that a range of (50F-60F) for cold water is the optimal operational range for cooling soft tissues. Colder temperatures used for long periods risk damage to soft tissues and are not recommended for sporting contexts. The length of exposure time to these temperatures is still variable in the literature. The temperature ranges for warm immersion use core-temp neutral (98F) as the upper limit. Coldwater immersion alone is sometimes used without alternating with warm water immersion. The rationale for this protocol follows the practice of using cryotherapy for the treatment of soft tissue injuries by reducing swelling and by acting as an analgesic. Some recent studies using cold water immersion with athletes have indicated that the procedure can reduce the sensation of DOMS.
- The duration times for cold immersion, warm immersion or showering vary markedly in the research. Cold water immersion times have ranged from 10 to 15 minutes with the explanation that longer exposure periods necessitate a warmer temperature in order to accommodate athlete comfort. Contrast water temperature protocols use much shorter exposure times with warm immersion lasting 1 to 3 minutes and cold-water immersion ranging from 1 to 2 minutes (3/1 Ratio Warm to Cold). Players will respond differently to cold temperatures and it is recommended that those who are inexperienced at using contrast immersion should begin by using protocols that involve shorter exposure times (30 to 60 seconds) and within the moderate temperature ranges (60F for cold immersion and 98F for warm) with 3 repetitions finishing on the cold immersion. A cold finish is appropriate for addressing any possible micro-trauma from training and assist with restoring normal thermoregulation.
- Ice Cryotherapy (ice treatments) has an analgesic effect (numbing and immediate pain reduction), but it has not been shown to reduce the symptoms of DOMS. However, more research is still needed for definitive guidelines or recommendations. If ice is applied after training, it should be restricted to 20 minutes or less
- The use of ice following an acute injury is well supported in the literature and a commonly used practice during rehabilitative exercise and physical therapy. The analgesic effects and initial vasoconstrictive action following ice application are well documented and protocols for the application of ice to an injured or recovering athlete following exercise and return to competition are common. The use of cryotherapy for recovery however, is not well supported in the literature. A review of treatment for DOMS concluded that current research does not support the efficacy of cryotherapy, apart from its analgesic effect used in the treatment of injury. The use of contrasting hot water immersion and ice water immersion has been advocated for recovery in athletes. Cold plunges and other types of whole-body immersion pools are available in many spas and health clubs with the theory that the alternation of hot and cold-water immersion would affect blood flow and enhance recovery.
- A cool down or active recovery has been recommended for athletes following heavy periods of exercise. The theory is that the active movements when sub-maximal in nature would assist with the rate of post-exercise lactate removal. In general, current recommendations for performing an active cool down, and submaximal exercise to promote recovery are supported.

**Spa**

- The use of a spa for recovery after training has had minimal scientific investigation yet it is one of the most common warm water immersion modalities used by athletes. The limited research published on this topic has indicated that underwater massaging of muscles fatigued after high intensity training reduces the perception of delayed onset muscle soreness and helps to maintain explosiveness in the exercised muscles. Although there are limited investigations into underwater massage, research findings have indicated that a combination of contrast immersion and underwater massage or aqua massage, could provide for both physiological and peripheral neural recovery and improved mood states post exercise. Like other hydrotherapy modalities the guidelines for water temperatures and exposure times have a critical effect on the fatigue levels and recovery of athletes. Exposures in warm environments for long periods of time can leave the user feeling lethargic and flat and the use of spas should be avoided if the player has any recent soft tissue injuries.

**Practical Applications**

- Showering within 5 to 10 minutes at the end of a training session or match may accelerate recovery of physiological states, and assist with peripheral neural fatigue. An effective post-training and post-competition routine is very important as it helps players to unwind and recover physically and psychologically. If there is access to a pool then some active recovery (5 to 20 minutes) involving both active and static stretching is also beneficial. Backstroke swim is a great option if available. Rehydration and refueling can occur concurrently with either strategy. Contrasting showers with several repetitions is beneficial.
- Players apply ice to key body parts to aid recovery. Cooling tissue temperatures in this manner conserves energy by slowing down metabolic activity, minimizes any post exercise edema and slows neural conductivity. There are several protocols for using ice for the treatment of acute injuries but there is no consensus about the best regimen for use in post exercise or competition situations.

**Massage**

- Numerous claims are made about the benefits of massage but there is little empirical evidence to support many of these statements. Most experimental evidence has suggested that massage has little influence on blood flow nor does it improve post exercise muscle strength or significantly reduce sensations of muscle soreness. There is some research to support the idea that the warming of superficial areas through massage can provide flexibility gains temporarily. Importantly other investigators have found that these gains are not as significant as the effects of stretching for improving flexibility and have no benefit if conducted in a pre-performance context. Improved mood states and enhancing feelings of well-being have also been recorded in several studies and many athletes use massage as a means of relaxing psychologically as well as for physical treatment. Perhaps the greatest benefit, but one not reported in the literature, is the biofeedback athletes receive from manipulation pressures whether these are through self-administered massage or treatments provided by a professional therapist or a parent.
- Massage is a particularly common recovery modality. It is popular as it is known to promote relaxation and is generally a pleasant or positive experience for the recovering athlete. The effect of massage on recovery following competition and exercise training does not show any clear physiologic advantage when subjected to critical review and research paradigms. Studies comparing the effects of a period of massage to a supine rest period following exercise or activity simulation, found that regardless of which condition was applied (massage vs. rest) no differences existed in subsequent performance or physiologic parameters such as blood lactate concentrations and fatigue. One preliminary report examined the effects of massage on creatine kinase levels. A thirty-minute massage in this study did reduce the effects of DOMS and creatine kinase levels.
- Several studies have tested the effect of massage on the mood, anxiety and relaxation levels of athletes. These studies point to the positive psychological benefits from a period of massage and could highlight one aspect of therapeutic massage not measured in the physiological studies on massage effects. Given these positive psychological responses, and the importance of relaxation as one part of recovery, the use of massage may be indicated following heavy performance.

**Flexibility**

- The first intrinsic factor is muscle flexibility and joint range of motion. Joints must move through large ranges of motion when the tennis player is running, turning, or hitting, and the muscles must be of sufficient flexibility to stretch and shorten to accommodate to the motions required. Alterations are commonly seen in tennis players and are associated with increased injury risk and decreased ball velocity. De-conditioned muscles develop adaptive stiffness. Injured muscles or joints develop inflexibility due to lack of use, immobilization of the muscle or joint, or direct and repair by scar tissue. The most common type of muscle inflexibility or joint stiffness is due to overload secondary to continued play. It is well documented that tennis players develop loss of rotation in the hips, trunk, and shoulder. These alterations may develop after acute and chronic, exposure to tennis activities and can be modified by directed stretching programs. The acute changes and relatively quick response to stretching suggest that a large component of the alteration is due to changes in muscle stiffness. The high demands of tennis cause the muscle fibers to sustain micro damage as a result of the continuous repetitive actions of running, serving, and hitting. The muscle fiber damage leads to a sensation of stiffness in the involved muscle group. One explanation of the changes in muscle flexibility may be an internal adaptation to repetitive tensile load known as thixotropy. Thixotropy is a biomechanical property of muscle and represents internal stiffness of the tissue. It is largely determined by the preceding history of movements and contractions. Thixotropy is defined as the passive stiffness that occurs after a chronic exposure of muscle to tension. When a muscle is contracted to a particular length, once the muscle has relaxed, stable cross-bridges form in the fibers at that length to give them their short-range elastic component (SREC). If the muscle is then shortened, the compressive forces on the sarcomeres, stiffened by the presence of the SREC, may lead to detachment of the some of the bridges. This detachment or damage has been found to be a compounding issue that once it develops, will remain in the muscular region for an extended period of time creating muscle stiffness which will decrease the maximum strength generated. Therefore, both acute and chronic changes in muscle due to eccentric load can affect the amount of flexibility in both upper and lower extremity muscle groups.
- Flexibility of both the upper and lower extremity can be increased via standard static and/or dynamic stretching. The hamstring, hip flexor, and hip rotator muscle groups should be targeted for the lower extremity while the pectoralis minor and posterior shoulder muscles should be the point of focus in the upper extremity. The ‚Äúsleeper‚Äù stretch, and cross arm stretch or towel stretch can be utilized to increase shoulder rotation flexibility whereas the ‚Äúopen book‚Äù or corner stretch can help elongate a shortened pectoralis minor. Sleeper stretches for stretching of the posterior capsule and posterior rotator cuff. Cross arm stretches for the posterior capsule of the shoulder and posterior rotator cuff. Following activity, it has been shown that the response of muscle following exposure to eccentric load is to become stiff. Following exposure to these loads, stretching has been shown to reduce the stiffness and increase range of motion of the affected joint(s), therefore stretching following activity should be considered. A post exercise cool down may be beneficial in reducing the sensations of stiffness and soreness which are often associated with lactic acid build up and thixotropy. It has been shown that a ‚Äúcool down‚Äù or recovery activity can return lactic acid values to pre-exercise levels and change the feeling of muscle stiffness.
- Studies have also shown light exercise (active recovery) and ice are more beneficial than ice alone in reducing lactic acid as well as increasing range of motion. Ice should not be used unless inflammation or injury is present. It has been demonstrated that the application of ice on the dominant arm of overhead athletes decreases shoulder muscle strength, proprioception, and accuracy of throwing. Therefore, the application of ice in between same day matches is not recommended unless inflammation or injury is present.
- Flexibility Areas of particular risk include hip and shoulder. Muscles respond to eccentric loads by becoming ‚Äústiff.‚Äù Appropriate stretching reduces muscle stiffness and increases range of motion in the affected area. The sleeper stretch is one of the best stretches to improve internal rotation flexibility at the shoulder joint.

**Local and Kinetic Chain Muscle Function**

- Optimum muscle function is required to generate the forces required in tennis and to protect against the loads applied to the body as a result of tennis play. Strength is the ability to generate a force or protect against a load, power is the ability to do that quickly, and endurance is the ability to do that over extended times. Muscle balance allows maximum joint protection and smooth motion of joints. Muscles may develop alterations due to lack of conditioning, wrong emphasis in training, fatigue, injury, or thixotropy. The areas that are often weak as a result of play or are overlooked during training are the peri-scapular musculature (lower trapezius, serratus anterior, and rhomboids), hip abductors (gluteus minimus and medius), and the local muscles of the core (multifidus, quadratus lumborum, and transverse abdominis). A shortened muscle is a weak muscle. The scapular muscles are responsible for stabilizing the scapula as the arm goes through the hitting zone. Weakness of these muscles results in alteration of static position or dynamic motion known as scapular dyskinesis. The scapular dyskinesis is loss of dynamic control of scapular retraction, depression, and external rotation. Scapular retraction is regarded as a key element in closed chain coupled scapulohumeral rhythm. The biomechanical result is a tendency towards scapular internal rotation and protraction around the rib cage. Excessive scapular protraction alters the scapular roles in shoulder function. The normal timing and magnitude of acromial motion is changed, the subacromial space distance (acromia humeral interval) is altered, glenohumeral arm angle may be increased, and maximal muscle activation may be decreased. Alteration of the amount of knee flexion used during the serve has been associated with increased stresses in the arm. Tennis players who did not have adequate bend in the knees, breaking the kinetic chain and decreasing the contribution by the hip and trunk, had 23-27% increased loads in horizontal adduction and rotation at the shoulder and valgus load at the elbow. A mathematical analysis of the tennis serve showed that a decrease in 20% of the kinetic energy developed by the trunk resulted in a requirement of 34% more arm velocity or 80% more shoulder mass to deliver the same energy to the ball. Weakness or tightness at the hip can also affect the arm. Decreased hip flexibility in rotation or strength in abduction (positive Trendelenburg) was seen in 49% of athletes with arthroscopically-proven posterior-superior labral tears. Synergistic activation patterns exist involving the transverse abdominus, abdominals, multifidi, and pelvic floor muscles that provide a base of support for all the trunk and spinal muscles. Fatigue of these muscles can result in the proximal portion of the kinetic chain to be unstable resulting in altered muscle activation and increased stress being placed on the distal extremities. There is also difficulty in directly assessing these muscles, so they are also often neglected or ignored with respect to musculoskeletal training or rehabilitation. Each of these local areas can be sources of alterations. They may have local effects, but because of the required kinetic chain activation and sequencing, they may have distant effects to performance and injury risk as well. In addition to recovery of local function, care must be taken to ensure all the segments are working in a coordinated sequenced activation.
- Hip and trunk, peri-scapular, and shoulder muscles are most commonly altered in tennis players. Most of the preparation for recovery of muscle function should be done before the matches. Proper training should be periodized and specific for the demands of tennis. Peri-scapular muscles such as the serratus anterior and lower trapezius should be a point of focus. Early training should incorporate the trunk and hip in order to facilitate the kinetic chain proximal to distal sequence of muscle activation. The scapula serves as the base or platform for the rotator cuff. A properly stabilized scapula allows for optimal rotator cuff activation. A recent study found that rotator cuff strength increased as much as 24% when the scapula was stabilized and retracted. For this reason, recovery should focus on scapular strengthening rather than placing an early emphasis on rotator cuff strengthening. Once the scapula is properly stabilized, more advanced exercises can be incorporated to strengthen the larger global muscles around the shoulder as well as the rotator cuff. In order to create a proximal stable base, training protocols should start with the primary stabilizing musculature of the core i.e. the transverse abdominus. These exercises can be performed by athletes at all levels. This stage of rehabilitation is not only to restore core function by itself, but also is the first stage of extremity rehabilitation. Between match recovery for muscle function should emphasize low-load, low repetition (3-5x) ‚Äútoning‚Äù exercises using tubing or light weights, preceded and followed by light stretching.
- Optimum muscle function is required to generate the forces required in tennis and to protect against the loads applied to the body as a result of tennis play. Recovery needs to focus on the upper back, hip abductors and the muscles of the core
- Core stability requires control of the trunk motion in all 3 planes of motion. Activation involves the transverse abs, abs, multifidi, and pelvic floor muscles provide a base of support for all the trunk and spinal muscles

**Fluids/Hydration**

- Most tennis athletes take the court, whether it is the first match or subsequent match of a tournament, in a dehydrated state. It has been shown that prior to thirst being recognized by an athlete, 1.5L of water could have already been lost. During an entire match, a player can lose fluid at a rate greater than 2.5L/hour. Although these players consume fluids between sets, the maximum uptake of fluid is only 1.2L/hour. This creates a deficit in hydration status which can impede performance.
- It is known that a decrease of between 1.5-3% of body weight due to loss results in decreased ability to generate maximum muscle strength, and decreases muscle endurance. A loss of 5% can decrease performance by 30% and there is an accompanying increase in body temp. Fluid losses during a match can be between 1-2 L/H. By the time you are thirsty, you are already 1% dehydrated.
- Pre-hydration and post-hydration are important components in maximizing performance and recovery. The recommended pre-hydration guidelines are to consume 17-20oz of fluid (ideally water or carbohydrate solution) approximately 2-3 hours prior to activity in order to allow the fluid to process through the digestive system and be absorbed by the tissues of the body. Fluid will be needed for warm-up and pre-match activities so 7-10oz should be ingested 10-20 minutes prior to activity. In order to help combat fluid loss during tennis play, players should drink 7-10oz of fluid every 10-20 minutes during activity. Before and after match body weighing can estimate the amount of fluid loss and identify the need for replacement. Post-activity, a carbohydrate-based fluid, such as a sports drink which also contains moderate levels of sodium, should be consumed within 1-hour. Ironically, excessive water consumption during and before gameplay is unlikely to enhance gameplay and has been shown to cause GI upset and at the extreme, hyponatremia. Hydration strategies should seek to optimize hydration status continuously, and not just around competition.
- Post-training or match hydration has three major purposes: - Replace fluid volume to an equal or slightly greater extent than the volume lost while sweating- Drink liquid carbohydrates to aid in glucose uptake to the muscles- Replace electrolytes lost during sweating. Many tennis players go into practice and/or competition already dehydrated. This results in the possibility of problems during play, but it also slows recovery. It is recommended to consume smaller volumes of fluid in a more regular basis during recovery. An example would be if you were to drink 32oz of fluid in the 60 minutes following a two-hour match, it would be recommended to consume 4-8oz every 10 minutes, rather than consume one or two larger doses of fluid. Athletes drink more fluid if it is flavored. Studies have shown as much as 30% more fluid is consumed with flavored drinks as opposed to plain water. Flavored, carbohydrate-electrolyte drinks are more effective in promoting post exercise re hydration than plain water, or low electrolyte diet cola. Many athletes do not consume enough sodium in their regular diet to support strenuous physical activity, especially in early stages of training and in hot and/or humid environments. Having recovery drinks and food that contain sufficient levels of sodium is helpful for a number of purposes: - Replaces the sodium that is lost in sweat- Stimulates glucose (energy) absorption by the muscles- Increases the athletes drive to drink- May reduce the symptoms of exertional heat cramps, exertional heat exhaustions and exertional hyponatremia. During multi-day tournaments or practice, it is common for players to experience a subtle but gradual sodium deficit and this can result in heat and hydration related problems (exhaustion, cramping etc.) towards the later rounds of tournament. Check urine color post-match to ensure you are adequately hydrated.

**Fuels**

- The foundation of an athlete‚Äôs diet during play is carbohydrates such as glucose and fructose. The metabolic demands of tennis require large amounts of readily available carbohydrates in the muscles to be used as immediate sources of fuel. Depletion of glycogen stores and the resulting decrease in adenosine triphosphate (ATP) during competition places the athlete in a position where performance can be affected. The goal for tennis athletes should be to maximize glycogen stores by eating meals rich in carbohydrate prior to competing while appropriately replenishing what is expended during vigorous activity through pre and post exercise consumption of carbohydrate.
- The day before competition, meals comprised primarily of carbohydrate should be consumed however, it is important to include a small amount of protein as well. The consumption of carbohydrate will help replenish any fuel stores which were depleted during practice and help ‚Äúpreload‚Äù the glycogen stores of the body for the next day, whereas the protein which will be broken down into amino acids, will aid in the repair of muscle tissue. On the day of competition, a meal rich in carbohydrate is recommended where 2 grams of carbohydrate per kilogram of body weight has been found to increase performance. This meal should be consumed no later than 2 hours prior to competition however this time recommendation can vary depending on the amount of carbohydrate being consumed. The 2-hour timeframe is suggested to allow the food to be properly digested and to limit the possibility of sustaining muscle injury or fatigue. Consumption of moderate to high amounts of fat and protein during pre-competition meals is not recommended because both are more difficult to digest in comparison to carbohydrate and athletes can experience gastric irritation (upset stomach) as a result of eating these types of macronutrients. If glycogen stores are not replenished following a match or in between matches, performance can be negatively affected. Muscles are most receptive to glycogen storage within 30 minutes following activity. Tennis athletes should focus on whole foods if possible, however a beverage with high levels of carbohydrate is a suggested alternative for those players who are attempting to recover in between matches or who have a low appetite for solid food following activity. While carbohydrate consumption is critical following the final match of any day, post competition meals should include the 3 major macronutrients (carbohydrates, fats, and protein) in order to restore fuel stores, regulate tissue function, and rebuild muscle tissue. Nutrition strategies in training should be oriented towards more protein and less carbohydrate, to maximize muscle and tissue repair and restoration.
- The major goals of nutritional recovery include: - Replenish glycogen (muscle and liver energy) stores- Restore appropriate fluid and electrolyte levels- Create new muscle proteins- Restoration of the immune system as little as 10 grams of essential amino acids before and after physical training may help jump start protein synthesis and repair. In prolonged exercise, such as tennis play greater than 90 minutes, fatigue is closely associated with low muscle glycogen and blood glucose levels. The American College of Sport Medicine position statement on nutritional requirements for athletes suggests consuming between 30 60 grams (120-240 calories) of carbohydrates per hour of exercise. If consuming a standard carbohydrate/electrolyte sport drink, this would equate to between 600-1200ml/hour (20-40oz/hour), or this amount could also be consumed with a combination of fluid and solid food such as nutritional bars. The timing of on-court nutrition during practice or competition should be in small regular intervals every 10-20 minutes at changeovers. Consuming high glycemic carbohydrates (simple sugars) during recovery can result in a 50% greater rate of muscle glycogen resynthesis than the ingestion of low glycemic carbohydrates. Nutrient Timing Researchers have shown a nutritional window of opportunity where glycogen resynthesis and protein repair occur at a greater rate. This window is within 45 minutes of completing physical training or competition; during this time frame it is vital that tennis players consume high glycemic carbohydrate fuels with a reasonable amount of protein (including essential amino acids) to help speed glycogen resynthesis, as well as protein rebuilding. Research has shown that replacing fuel within this window, as opposed to waiting two or three hours after physical activity, reduces recovery time and improved fuel stores. This difference could be as high as 47%. Ingesting between 6-20 grams of protein is recommended during this recovery window. A 4:1 carbohydrate to protein ratio is also a good general recommendation for the food/ fuel source during the recovery period.
- Focus on Carbohydrates: Glucose homeostasis is disrupted several times during the course of a tennis tournament. Continuous carbohydrate intake is therefore important for matches lasting three or more sets and during days where multiple matches are played.
- Consume 30-60 g of carbohydrates per hour of play. Consume sport drinks and carbohydrate rich foods (i.e. fruits, gels, sport bars) during matches and training, and in between matches to promote optimal fueling and rehydration.
- Monitor carbohydrate intake due to individual metabolic responses.
- Players need to carry an emergency fuel supply incase matches are delayed and/or very long in length.
- Consume 6-20g of protein immediately post-exercise so to promote adaptation to training and recovery from matches. Your recovery food should consist of 30+ grams of carbohydrates and 6-20g protein: Examples of nutritious carbohydrate-protein recovery snacks include: 10 oz of liquid meal supplements, 10 oz smoothie, 1 sport bar, or chocolate milk
- Start your recovery immediately: Thirty to sixty minutes immediately after exercise is seen to be the critical time to ingest nutrients with the aim of facilitating recovery. Then repeat two hours later or refuel again at your next meal.
- Drink up. Player needs to drink at least 1.2 L of fluid per hour of practice and during matches. Drink a volume of fluid in excess of the existing fluid deficit to allow for ongoing sweat and urine losses. Players may need to replace 150 per cent of the fluid deficit to obtain baseline values. Replace electrolytes (sodium) to maximize the retention of fluid via sport drinks or foods. Players need to be acclimatized to the weather prior to playing in tournaments.
- The American College of Sports Medicine recommends athletes should consume 30-60 g/h of carbs during exercise in the form of Glucose, sucrose, or maltodextrins. This rate of carbohydrate ingestion can be accompanied by drinking 20-30oz of a sport drink. The timing of carbs ingestion during practice and matches should be in small amounts but with a regular supply. During changeovers is a great time.
- Make sure you eat plenty of fruits and veggies. Over time, lack of the vitamins and minerals these provide lead to greater muscle injury, illness and lengthened recovery times. Try to get a colorful variety
- Banana = 30 carbs
- Cliff Bar = 40 Carbs

**Sleep**

- Sleep Although sleep is an area that is not yet well understood, it could be the most important form of recovery. A good night sleep between 7-9 hours provides invaluable adaptation time to adjust the physical, neurological, immunological and emotional stressors that are experienced during the day. Some athletes, especially during major growth spurts, may need 10 hours or more of sleep. However, too much sleep can be detrimental to performance, as it can slow down the central nervous system. Short naps during the day of 15-30 minutes are beneficial and can improve alertness, perception and performance. Longer naps are not as beneficial and can result in the player feeling sluggish and groggy.

**Caffeine**

- Caffeine is a naturally occurring stimulant that can be found in coffee, tea, caffeinated soda, and chocolate in dosages typically between 30-200mg of caffeine. Although caffeine has been studied extensively in many sports, showing a multitude of physical improvements in strength, power, speed and endurance, the data is limited in tennis players. The few studies that have been conducted have not shown positive performance improvements in tennis players. Recent research on caffeine and dehydration shows limited evidence of caffeine having a negative response to thermoregulation or hydration status in dosages between 300-400mg per day. However, caffeine is not a supplement that is recommended for tennis play or competition, but under appropriate guidance, may have some positive effects for off-court training for adult players. Large dosages (>500mg per day) need to be discouraged, as this could have detrimental effects on heart rate, fine motor control, technique, over-arousal and hydration level.

**Within Match Recovery Strategies**

- Preparation for within match recovery is essential and both metabolic and psychological fatigue strategies can be applied. Water, sports drink with electrolytes and other small nutritional items should be available. If conditions are warm/hot, a change of shirts and socks is recommended.

**DOMS**

- The pain arising from the damage and repair process associated with conditioning and competition is commonly referred to as delayed onset of muscle soreness (DOMS). To reduce DOMS while protecting against muscle damage, athletes should engage in exercises that provide different ranges of tennis-relevant motions with progressive eccentric loading. Heavy resistance training should be followed by 1-2 days of rest for the involved muscles and joints. The duration is directly proportional to the amount of overload, tissues involved, and fitness level. DOMS can last 24-72 hours in a trained individual.

**Conditioning**

- In Tennis, general conditioning should be planned to target development in the specific tennis characteristics of interest. Resistance training should develop biomechanical abilities reflective of those needed on the court (single leg, shoulder, wrist, forearm) in addition to basic strength and power movements (squat, pulls, plyometrics)
- There is reason to suspect a prevalence of training strategies that do not reflect the physical exertion characteristics of tennis; which means they transfer poorly to tennis. Continuous running is an example of a common training strategy that doesn‚Äôt provide transferability to tennis while creating potentially counterproductive effects.
- For muscle soreness and protection against damage, the best approach appears to be different ranges of tennis relevant motion with progressive exposure to heavy resistance exercise. One to two days of rest after appear effective in eliminating residual fatigue from loading stress

**Ergogenic aids and their role in recovery**

- Of the 1,000‚Äôs of Ergogenic aids in the market. Only 5 have an adequate amount of scientific research
  - Caffeine ‚Äì Not much research on caffeine and tennis. Some research done shows potentially a small benefit at lower doses 1-3mg/kg or about 75-150mg if taken before practice or at the end when you are tired. Caffeine didn‚Äôt show any benefits for match play. Use is also highly individual specific. Higher levels (>500mg) can be bad for tennis. Increase in HR, loss of fine motor control, difficultly sleeping and recovery ability are all known issues at high does. High doses are therefore not recommended.
  - Creatine ‚Äì No studies show benefit to tennis players
  - Bicarbonate ‚Äì No studies have been done in relation to tennis players. Can cause GI issues
  - Glycerol ‚Äì No real studies on it and tennis.
  - Antioxidants ‚Äì Tennis training can lead to an increase in Free Radicals. Supplementation with Antioxidant vitamins may help to reduce damages. A, C, E and B-carotene",1,1730761954.0,10s,1,1.0,False

Recently, she‚Äôs been forgetting events from weeks or months ago, and she often gets frustrated with simple things like GPS directions or mistakes that others make, not realizing they weren‚Äôt intentional.

Initially, I thought her behavior was just a result of her age, but something she said today made me worry it might be more serious;

 A couple of months ago, we visited a coffee shop together that I lived near to reminisce it.

But today when we stopped by there, 

she thought it had been over a year since our last visit.

When I try to talk to her about her memory issues, she often argues and insists her memory is better than mine or that I‚Äôm needlessly worrying about it . 

Our conversations have become frustrating; I might say something light, but she often responds critically, which feels more argumentative and makes me reluctant to chat or spend time her.

We live close, so I see her a bit more than I did when I lived in the city , but due to her negative behaviors , I‚Äôve been limiting our visits and she gets upset that I won‚Äôt spend time with her or chat with her.

I truly believe she doesn‚Äôt mean to be combative, but I can‚Äôt help but wonder if it‚Äôs just her age or something more concerning.

The issue is that she's currently studying abroad (AU). I was hoping to get in touch with someone who could help me in ordering from a florist in Australia to deliver the flowers to her on her birthday.

1. Why post this on AskIndianWomen? 
-This appeared to be a relatively more women focused subreddit compared to AskIndia and still sizable and active enough to help me address my query. 
-The other main reason was that of safety. I believe it'd be safer to disclose the bare minimum information(for eg the address), required to place the order, to a woman (if this succeeds, that is) .

2.Why not use IGP or FNP?
-I've read mixed reviews about these gift websites and while there services are reasonably good on our own subcontinent, I'm not confident enough to go through with their services for this very important task.
-Furthermore, I believe it would be better to have a person placing the order and a florist curating a bouquet for the occasion compared to picking from a bunch of pre-curated (and frankly, limited) online offerings.

3.Why not place the order online using International payment options? 
-This seems to be the a good way to go as well, but I do not have the technological-savviness nor the right debit/credit cards that would enable me to make such payments. I believe PayPal and other banking options allow for such facilities, but going through with setting up an international remittance account for a one off service seems far too much work.

4. What about the costs of the endeavor? 
-I'm willing to fully compensate for the cost of ordering the flowers (obviously), plus any additional transportation/inconvenience costs that occur during the turmoil to any Indian bank account. Fully negotiable. 

5. Why am I posting this at 4 am (IST)? 
-Too much coffee this evening. 


This may sound like an elaborate scam, but I assure you, I'm just a regular dude who got a gift from her on my birthday and I want to repay that.

Man wants to send flowers to his friend who is in Australia. Need a girl to help him out in ordering it there. All expenses paid.

We continue to receive questions about what has happened on the mod team, and why the subreddit came under new moderation a month ago.  We promised to answer those questions as best we could.

So I am answering everything from MY perspective only, with names changed where appropriate.

I want to be clear that what matters here is that the subreddit is thriving and that we all love the deck.  This update on what happened is purely for those that are interested in what has taken place behind the curtain.  In the grand scheme of things, none of this is important, and in no way should detract from anyone‚Äôs enjoyment of the Steam Deck.  

So read this only if you really want to.  Otherwise, just ignore and move on.

And please BE KIND to everyone involved - even those you may disagree with.  This is just my account of events and it will therefore be full of my own prejudices, my own biases, and my own beliefs.  It cannot and does not try to represent your experience, or anyone else‚Äôs.  

Let‚Äôs give this a try, and start from the very top.

**PRE-HISTORY** - or, Let‚Äôs Set the Stage.

Do you remember July 15, 2021?

Because that is when the Steam Deck was announced.  

Like many of you, I saw the announcement from Valve and immediately signed up to buy a deck.  My 1TB LCD deck is fantastic - and I am currently enjoying God of War: Ragnarok on it.  

Unlike everyone else, one of our fellow redditors saw an opportunity in that announcement beyond promising to give Gabe Newell more money.  One redditor - let‚Äôs call them Thriving-Horseradish - created the /r/SteamDeck Subreddit that very day.  Fast forward to today and it has become the single biggest reddit community dedicated to the handheld gaming platform, and has been an unqualified success.

*record scratch*

I *may* have skipped a few things.

**CREDIT WHERE CREDIT IS DUE** or, Let‚Äôs Show Respect for Great Ideas

Look, sometimes people with good ideas can be assholes.  Thomas Edison was a notorious dick who relentlessly attacked Nikola Tesla. Henry Ford was an anti-Semite.  Thomas Jefferson owned (and banged) his slaves.  Elon Musk may run some of the biggest companies in the USA, but he has become an internet meme - and not in a good way. 

Let‚Äôs just say that our friend Thriving-Horseradish was not without fault.  I mean, as far as I know, they didn‚Äôt bankrupt anyone or preach racist beliefs or own a slave, but they still somehow ended up mismanaging an incredibly popular subreddit here.  And they did not listen to anyone they recruited to help them.  Full and absolute credit goes to them for the idea for this space - and for growing it to a community of over 700 thousand subscribers.  We cannot forget that and must recognize the achievement.

**GENERATION ONE - THE BUILDERS** - or, Avengers, Assemble!

In the mists of legend, Thriving-Horseradish put together a stellar team of individuals and had support setting up the first iteration of the subreddit in those early days.  This was set up like any other Mod team in a reasonable subreddit.  Everyone had access to everything.  These heroes were able to start the subreddit from nothing, come up with the first rules, create the first automod, and ride the wave of SteamDeck hype right up until launch and beyond.

So what happened?  

Communication Breakdown *(It‚Äôs always the same, Having a nervous breakdown, Drives me insane‚Ä¶.)*  

Things might have been OK if Thriving-Horseradish had communicated with their team but, as it turns out, they chose not to.  The team of 8 experienced moderators that worked with Thriving-Horseradish found that their founder was nowhere to be found.  Or at least, did not want to be part of the conversation.  In fact, according to some of these early leaders, Thriving-Horseradish was simply AWOL for a long period, and not engaged in the subreddit.  The remaining 8 created their own Discord to communicate as a team (which is not at all uncommon) and invited Thriving-Horseradish to join.  Thriving-Horseradish declined.  

Things spiraled from bad to worse, with Thriving-Horseradish becoming completely disconnected from their team.  The other 8 moderators reached out *en masse* to Thriving-Horseradish stating, and I quote:

*Several members of the moderation team are very concerned about your behavior.  Between brashly nuking all of the dbrand posts without talking to anyone, and now your ""F"" post CLEARLY breaking our rules, then BANNING SOMEONE for calling you out, something's got to give. You refuse to join the discord the entire moderation team uses, which is fine. What isn't fine is your rash actions without talking to anyone‚Ä¶You keep making messes and expecting all of us to clean up after you. This is not okay. You also are very clearly breaking Reddit's Moderator code of conduct‚Ä¶*

Thriving-Horseradish was not swayed by this collective message, and responded:

*Now whether you personally and/or the other moderators have an opinion on whether I am 'worthy' of the top mod position is largely irrelevant to our responsibility to the sub-reddit and it's members. You weren't brought on board to question that and that is NOT for you or any other mod to decide. Do it on Discord, within other subs you mod or in your personal life. But not here on the official channels through bad faith political attacks aimed at me just for holding the position. Lets get one thing clear: YOU do not speak for the mods. In one collective voice, that's my privilege & responsibility as top moderator. I speak for the mod positions and the entire r/steamdeck sub-reddit on all matters that require one voice. You occupy the role of moderator because I created it in the best interest of the sub. You may elect yourself to speak for fellow moderators on this particular subject about me. Fine. You've seemed to telegraph what you think that means for you. And frankly, the other moderators have their own individual voices are free to speak on this subject. The floor is open to them as well.*

The Gen 1 mods did reach out with an olive branch - a genuine desire to work together:

*...we are willing and want to give you the chance to prove to us that you will work with us. If you agree to commit to the communication paths outlined above AND agree to correct your moderation in-line with our community rules, we will rescind the report made against you, and will be happy to try to work with you to improve. However, if you continue to be disconnected from team discussions, continue with disregard for our subreddits rules, or continue to try to flaunt your ""top mod"" spot to try to beat down opposition, we will find ourselves back here, with every channel available to us to have you removed as a moderator, in our hand.*

Things went downhill from there.  Thriving-Horseradish decided to completely clean house, and absolutely everyone from the Gen 1 mod team was expelled:

*Hello Mod Team, I am hereby invoking my powers as founder and top moderator of r/SteamDeck to dissolve your moderator privileges from the sub-reddit effective immediately (as of 10-16-2022). Reddit Admins were notified of my decision and it has been officially recorded.
I want to thank you on behalf of the members of the sub for any positive contributions during your time as moderator for the community. The collective group effort you participated to intimidate a top moderator into abdicating their position has caused unnecessary damage to the community and has been thoroughly documented & reported to Reddit Admins for further investigation (beginning with this very thread).*

Now I know that the Generation 1 team did appeal to the Reddit Admins, but Thriving-Horseradish retained their position.  As I pointed out earlier, Thriving-Horseradish had built a successful community, and who could blame the admins for believing their perception - that the team they‚Äôd brought on had decided to revolt?

I also learned that these folks were not only demodded - they were also given bans of varying lengths by Thriving-Horseradish.  To my knowledge, all of those bans have since been reversed.

Incidentally, it was this group of Gen 1 moderators who went on to create a number of thriving Steam Deck related communities now currently linked to this subreddit.  I have personally joined a Discord with these individuals and they have vetted this post for accuracy before it was made.

**GENERATION TWO - THE SILENT GENERATION** - or, History Repeats Itself

Thriving-Horseradish had decided to do their best Trump impression and fire everyone.  But at the end of the day, /r/SteamDeck is a busy place, and they soon needed some extra help.

I know that another two or three good people were brought on to replace the Great Eight that had gone before.  Like their predecessors, they had access to modmail and stuff behind the scenes.  And sadly, their fate was the same:  after a few months of hard work, conflict ensued, and this second team were also culled.

So hats off to this lost generation, who were the forgotten members of the team.  Press F to pay respects.

It seems that Thriving-Horseradish was going through Mod Teams the same way that Agatha Harkness goes through Covens.  But, you know, with much less murder.

**GENERATION THREE - YOU GUESSED IT, THAT‚ÄôS ME!** - or, Everything Old is New Again

So somewhere around October of 2022, I saw a post on /r/needamod asking for support moderating this great corner of the internet.  As it turns out, so did /u/sweatycat and /u/weebutt and three or four others.  We were all moderators with experience and tasked with clearing the mod queue and providing ongoing support.  Thriving-Horseradish chose not to give any of us permissions beyond the mod queue.  I can speculate that this is because of how things went with the last two generations.

But honestly, in those early days, it was no big deal.  I‚Äôve joined subreddit teams in the past where permissions were initially restricted and then more were given when it was clear that you were committed to the work.  The new team even joined the SteamDeck Discord back channel that Thriving-Horseradish had set up for us to communicate in.  So incidentally, there were some lessons learned about communication through those first two generations.

We did not know about the generations before us, and we were blissfully ignorant of any of the past drama.  I (personally) was happy to find a way to contribute to the community that I had already been part of for a while.  Like many users, I had not noticed anything at all amiss.  

And as a mod, I continued to notice nothing that went sideways at all.  Initially, the mod queue would fill with the usual nonsense:  racist posts, hate speech, porn links, people trying to work politics into something, and reddit‚Äôs usual spambots.  Much of this was caught by the automod, and then the removal was just confirmed by us.  No big deal.  I threw down a few bans for racism and spam, but it was not anything I hadn‚Äôt seen before.

February of 2022 - before Gen 3 were mods - was when the SteamDeck was released. Gabe Newell himself made deliveries.  It was an exciting time.  

The only time close to that in terms of hype was in November of 2023, when the OLED model was released.  As a mod at that time, I saw incredible traffic spikes - lots and lots in the mod queue.  But something else had changed.

The tone of the subreddit itself started to become more and more combative.  I repeatedly saw Thriving-Horseradish‚Äôs name in the comments in the mod queue that the automod picked up.  And anything with the word ‚Äòmod‚Äô in it was immediately tossed out.

I need to be clear that flagging the word ‚Äòmod‚Äô or ‚Äòmods‚Äô in the automod is pretty common, because mod abuse is a thing, and this means that all those comments have to be reviewed.  But in a community where modding the Deck is actually commonplace, flagging those comments was a poor choice.  Innocent comments were yanked, and people talking about how they could modify their deck found their comments weirdly silenced.  

And suddenly, the mod queue was absolutely full, all the time.  I spent *hours* approving posts that should never have been removed, and repeatedly asked Thriving-Horseradish to turn down crowd control and slow down the pace.

We began to lurch from crisis to crisis in the subreddit.  One of the experienced Generation 3 mods quit, saying:

*Sorry I'm resigning my position as a mod here. [Thriving-Horseradish], I feel like you need to do a better job of communicating with the mods. Oftentimes, it seems to take forever to receive a response here, despite you making frequent mod actions. Also, I feel kind of powerless when I see user complaints about our moderation- since I feel like I can't have a dialog to change our rules, or respond to modmails. Many users complain about the amount of megathreads, which isn't being addressed. (Personally, I never use megathreads, so I can see why many people are overwhelmed by the types of posts gated behind them.) I'm posting my reasonings here instead of in a DM, because I'm not trying to call you out (or any other mods)- I think there should be a better dialog between the mods in the future. I hope that my leaving spurs some constructive discussion. Also on a personal note, dealing with users is stressful for me, so that does factor in to my decision of leaving. Thanks for the opportunity and good luck everyone.*

We had a nasty experience when a trans person posted about using their deck awaiting their surgery.  The thread was (predictably) a shitshow, but the mod team cleared out the anti-trans bigots and threw down a bunch of bans.

But then, Thriving-Horseradish removed the entire thread.

Our community went (justifiably) bonkers.  I reinstated the thread and stated that our community is accepting of everyone‚Äôs gender identity.  It was my first direct conflict with Thriving-Horseradish.  But it was not the last.

**GENERATION THREE - FECAL MATTER HITS AIR MOVING DEVICE** - or, the Shit Show

About 8 months ago, I woke up, had my coffee, and then went on Reddit - a normal Sunday morning.  I saw MULTIPLE threads attacking the mods, specifically naming Thriving-Horseradish.  It was a crisis.

In response, I created [this thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/1anjelv/community_input_thread/) to help understand and learn exactly what our community wanted.  I pinned it and got great engagement.  I messaged Thriving-Horseradish about it.  I expressed our need to get real community voice and engagement.  I expressed that the mod team can‚Äôt really be effective if we don‚Äôt have access to modmail and the back end of the subreddit.

What happened?

Well, I went out to do grocery shopping, and I came back to find the thread unstickied, removed, and the subreddit in revolt.  People who commented in the community input thread were being banned.  It was bad.  I said to Thriving-Horseradish:

*Locking and removing was a poor choice, and has alienated a bunch of users. Trust is fleeting. Instead of giving people a place to have a voice, all this did was piss more people off.*

Thriving-Horseradish's response?

*Noted. Stand fast. My opinion is the sub is not imploding. The VAST majority of the sub is doing what they do sans the coordinated attack campaign. I am very much aware of the sentiment. Even more, I am very much aware of the abuse aimed at me. Placating the hostility from this campaign (even in an effort to isolate it within a thread) is giving them a voice to further amplifty the rhetoric. The strategy in the immediate time (as in right now this moment) is to let them burn their fuel. Rather, yeet their shit and allow the community to continue what they are currently doing: Discussing Steam Deck. I will NOT give into pressure campaigns. I won't tolerate the abuse or threats aimed at me personally or at you, any mods or the community. Neither will the Reddit Admins. There's nothing more important than to remove those toxifying the sub with this hate campaign right now. The toxicity, the abuse has crossed the line. It would be futile to host a lucid discussion about improvements to the sub while a campaign like this is in affect*

It was incredibly frustrating.

And so, the cycle of stuff would continue.  Regular complaints about Thriving-Horseradish, super full mod queues, and my pleas for change falling on deaf ears.

In April of 2024 I showed the top mod that I had done 36K mod actions in the past 12 months, with the vast majority of them being approvals, and again asked for permissions to see modmail and the back end of the subreddit.

I was told:

*Hey, The status remains the same prior to joining. Accesss remains limited to myself and Reddit Admins. My expectation that will change when they're no longer involved. Let me know if you've gotten any particularly inappropriate or violent threats to your DM's. Outside of personal & general threats aimed at the mod team and myself, only [former mod] got some pretty harsh doxing. Meantime, I do have mod candidates to bring in but it takes a hard skin and some prep for the role.*

What?  Reddit Admins?  I had heard nothing of the sort before.  

I replied:

*What do you mean - Reddit admins are involved? How could that possibly impact you sharing access to things like modmail and crowd control?  You limiting access makes it tough for me to do the mod role well.*

‚Ä¶but this went completely unanswered.  

My only guess is that Thriving-Horseradish had shared permissions with two previous teams, and was absolutely unwilling to do that again.  But they could not share that reasoning with me, because it is crazy talk.  So they were caught in a trap of their own making.

This September, I expressed my concern for their personal well being to Thriving-Horseradish, and my overall concern for the subreddit.  I pointed out that /r/steamdeckhq got an endorsement from /r/linux_gaming - meaning that core users might be turning away from here.  

The response from Thriving-Horseradish was the immediate suspension of the entire mod team.  They messaged in the Discord:

*An audit will be taking place of the sub in regards to the recent brigading. All privileges have been suspended while the logs are reviewed. Please stand by. Apologies for the inconvenience everyone.*

What. The. Fuck?!?

**GENERATION THREE:  VIVA LA REVOLUTION!** - or, How We Got to Here

I‚Äôd love to tell you all that we immediately reported our suspended privileges to the Reddit Admins.

Nope.  

We just waited.

The entire mod team were mods in name only, with absolutely zero privileges.  We couldn‚Äôt even see the mod queue.  We were there on the list, but nothing was available to us.

We stayed that way for almost a month.

We did ask multiple times what was going on, and when we would be reinstated.  But we had no response at all from Thriving-Horseradish.  

Finally, /u/sweatycat and I - independent of each other - reported the situation to the Admins.  The Admins (to their credit) took immediate action and opened a modmail thread to the subreddit Mod team.

Remember - we could not see modmail, so what happened next was a shocker.  I mean, not to you, gentle readers, but to the team.  

We were all demodded.  The entire team, gone, by Thriving-Horseradish. 

And THEN, the Admins restored all of us, and gave us all the privileges - like modmail - that Thriving-Horseradish never had.  And the Admins asked us, politely, what the heck was going on.  To quote:

*Hi all - We have re-added the active moderators that were removed and we have adjusted permissions on everyone to prevent further changes to the mod list from being made at this time. It's important that we hear back regarding this as having clarity will help us review this situation further.*

Thriving-Horseradish spun a tale that the entire subreddit was being brigaded, and that the mod team was colluding with the brigaders, and that only Thriving-Horseradish was defending the community.  Both /u/sweatycat and I disputed these claims, stating we had seen no evidence of an attack on the subreddit, and that it was a lack of transparency from Thriving-Horseradish that had brought us to this place.

And during this series of messaging to the Admins, Thriving-Horseradish posted [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/needamod/comments/1fuz6iv/rsteamdeck_740k_members_is_looking_for_temporary/?share_id=BzIBg2lCyVbzahYOyITWP) looking for new moderators.  Their plan was to turf the entire team - Again! - and replace us with someone new.  When I brought this up in the modmail, we quickly learned from Thriving-Horseradish that they had demodded an entire team at least one other time.

So what happened next?

The Admins made the final decision.  They stated:  

*Thank you all for your patience during this process. Unfortunately, we have needed to remove the top moderator due to violations of the Moderator Code of Conduct: Rule 1. We have given the two remaining active moderators full permissions and have extended an invitation for u/weebutt to rejoin the team.*

**THE REST OF THE STORY** - or, Here We Are Today

So for the last month, we‚Äôve been cleaning up messes.  Undoing bans.  Clearing out YEARS of unanswered modmail.  Making amends.  Reaching out.

We hope you‚Äôve seen our commitment.  I have personally reached out to all the aggrieved subreddits that sprung up around /r/SteamDeck because of how poorly those people were treated by Thriving-Horseradish.

My ex broke up with me less than 2 weeks after asking me to be her girlfriend, and it has completely wrecked me. When she asked, I felt like I was on cloud nine. I thought it meant she was committed to us and that we‚Äôd work through whatever came our way together, as a team. But just as quickly, she started to pull away. Eventually, she asked me out for coffee and ended things.

I understand her reasons, but I‚Äôm still hurt and angry. Why would she do that? She said it was about protecting herself and realizing we weren‚Äôt compatible, and I get it on a logical level. But I thought we‚Äôd at least try to figure things out together, especially since we both had feelings and cared about each other. It feels like I was the only one actually invested in making it work, while she was just looking out for herself and her peace.

She had this way of being patient and communicative that made me feel safe enough to open up, to trust her and let my guard down. And now she‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ gone. It makes me question everything. How can someone go from sending sweet texts like ‚ÄúI know I just saw you yesterday, but I miss talking to you‚Äù to deciding out of the blue that I‚Äôm not worth the effort?

It feels like I‚Äôve hit rock bottom. I feel like she didn‚Äôt even trust me or our relationship enough to give it a chance. Like I wasn‚Äôt worth trying for. And, to make things worse, the day after the breakup, I got rejected from a job I really wanted. It‚Äôs like the universe is telling me no one trusts me or believes in me, not even in my abilities.

I know that time will help, and eventually things will be okay. But right now, every morning I wake up and my first thought is, ‚ÄúShe left me,‚Äù and I just hope I‚Äôll find a job soon.

","Polyamory/Nonmonogamy and the Commodification of Humans: Outsourcing Love and Human Relationships (Part 2)!


Commodification describes the process by which something without an economic value gains economic value that can replace other social values. The process changes relationships that were previously untainted by commerce into relationships that essentially become commercial in everyday use. The concept itself is quite broad and helps to understand important aspects of through which love, intimacy, sex, emotions and relationships went through a process of polyamorous commodation, commercialuzation and their development.


In other words, under the constant atack by the ENM and polyamorous industrial corpus and media, not only intimate and personal relations‚Äîespecially those linked to households, relationships, and domestic units, the primary units but also individuals themselves associated with reproductive labor‚Äîhave become more explicitly commodified, linked to commodities and to commodified global processes (i.e., bought or sold; packaged and advertised; fetishized, commercialized, or objectified; consumed; assigned values and prices) 


One of a set of maxims that we will further discuss down this discourse says that ""the more you own and the more you buy, the happier and more fulfilled your life will be"". Yet, is it true? Of course not. Have we been cleverly (and insidiously) led to believe that it‚Äôs true? You bet, we were. Buying things beyond our basic needs (and the pressure to do so in today‚Äôs society) is known as¬†hyper consumerism. Polyamory as a derivative of this hyper consumerism is not only a form of hyper-consumerism but hyperinfidelity too. It‚Äôs the never-ending pursuit of happiness through the acquisition of what is non-essential for happiness.¬†I say never-ending because hyper consumerism never delivers the true satisfaction and fulfillment that it promises.¬†Experts found¬†that people who make acquiring material things a goal in their life report greater unhappiness, more negative moods, and a variety of psychological problems.Consumption is a normal part of everyday life, but it becomes a problem when it‚Äôs excessive and wasteful. Understanding how hyper-consumerism affects you is the first step toward becoming a conscious consumer.¬†


Polyamory and Non Monogamy as a Subset of Hyper-Consumerism

So, moving from ‚ÄúHomo-Satisfaci≈ç (content/enough)‚Äù to ‚ÄúHomo-C≈çns≈´m≈ç (Consumer)"", the hyper-consumeristic culture in our contemporary society depicts a radical shift of our being. Sharing the same traits, incentives, personalities, hallmarks, dynamics and anatomy with polyamory as derivative from hyper-consumerism, polyamory can be considered as cheating on steroids or hyper-infidelity. In this society, not only hyper-consumerism is engineered by persuasive as well as pervasive branding and advertising campaigns that are led through the power of the mass media, but the polyamorous industrial complex with its mass media is responsible for the same policy and blueprint. While the solicitation of mass media advertisements make us believe that happiness is simply the multiplication of pleasure and utility, the polyamorous industrial complex has projected the same action plan and the sane subsequent principles into the real of love, sex, intimacy and human relationships. Relying on hyper-consumeris, now, instead of needs, the polyamorous branding and advertisement campaigns create now craving and aspirations that are superficial, shallow and self-centered. They appeal to the lowest common denominator and this results in escalated levels of greed and hedonism. This greedy nature cultivated by polyamory as hyper-infidelity and as a subset of hyper-consumerism reduces human beings to the level of addictive pleasure and attention seekers as well as utility oriented exploiterer or being material goods/chattels. This comes, then, at the expense of searching for the ultimate good and for thr appropriate human flourishing, personal as well as a collective one.


The same way as consumerism, polyamory, above everything else, reflects the shallowness of an instant culture of all about feeling good. Based on the principles of outsourcing and through human commodification, polyamory additionally holds that aquiring poeple should be our mandatory goal in life, that hoardings of partners and relationship leads to fulfillment in life and love. More-so, the consumer culture in our contemporary society works upon a maxim that can be summed up as ‚ÄúI consume therefore I am‚Äù. The equivalent polyamorous maxim  works upon a principle that means ""I fuck, therefore, I am"". Indeed, in the decadent age of polyamory, the world has become a marketplace and its citizens‚Äô global shoppers and merchandize. Almost everything including sex, emotions, partners, relationships and love, is commoditized. For this reason, markets tend to govern our lives while the market values play the role of influencing the choices we make. Consumerism has become like a new religion spreading the creed of sexual gedonism and greediness. Undoubtedly, the media bombards consumeristic tendencies and every space is used to advertise. 


Unfortunately, consumerism has become the way of life and polyamory attempts to undergo the same way and journey in the realm of human love and relationships. Consumerism's intencive is to enable  market values to penetrate deep into our social life and polyamory is the vessel to enable and implement it at the level oglf families and rationships. This situation threatens virtue by exposing it to be corrupted while at the same time risking commoditizing it. This makes virtues to languish. Since consumerism is about to buy and waste things to improve our economy, in polyamory, therefore, one would be coerced by persuasive market strategies, such as, advertisements, to consume more and more poeple and more and more relatiomships. This is the main goal of the Neo-liberal as welll as of the capitalist polyamorous  hyperconsumer market economy which tries to make profit by whatever means possible. In the camouflage of catering to the needs of the people, the polyamorous market manipulates people‚Äôs desires by creating envy through the mass media especially by way of advertisements. In most cases, those advertisements play on the sub-conscious mindset by making the people to believe in hyper consumerism and polymory.


As already successfuly pointed out, ‚Äúa social and economic order that was based on systemic creation and fostering desire to purchase goods or services in even greater amounts has been entrenched deep in the society‚Äù. Concretely, we can say that the market values have made the present society into a generation of ‚Äúcompulsive shopaholics‚Äù who exult in a culture that is more or less like that of instant-coffee, a culture of people who are extremely time conscious, easy going, accumulative, easy on using and throwing yet without respect and concern for the wellbeing of the entire society and that has expanded this way if thinking on buman relationship. This reflects that consumerism with its derivative of polyamory and ENM tarnishes away our authentic identity. We define ourselves based on what we have, than what we really are or ought ‚Äòto be‚Äô, and as integral human beings with sense of dignity, spiritual values and moral integrity instruments of gain and objects of use. This discourse does not dismiss the relevance of basic consumerism aimint at satisfying needs in our society, but it tries to analyze hyper consumerism and its derivative of polyamory and ENM as hyper-infidelity and proposes a solution from virtue ethics.


As the derivative of hyper consumerism, polyamory represents a model of hyper infidelity that was created by using the same methods as used in consumerism and that went through an adaptation and application process which expanded the original principles of consumerism to include also particular aspects of the polyamorous hyper infidelity model. Here, the main cotnerstones of the model:

1. In consumerism, luxuries and wants were marketed as necessities; In polyamory craving, desires, whims, caprices, were preaented aa basic needs and requirements

2. In consumerism, advertising sold a lifestyle that could only be achieved by buying more products. In polyamory, branding took this to extremity and claimed that happiness can be achieved by mimicking this kind of behaviours in the human love life and relationships.

3. Malls and department stores were created to encourage buying. In polyamory, human have become the content of the stores that can be bought or sold as if being merchandize or commodities to sells.

4. Self-worth and status were directly linked to the ownership of goods. This is the same as with the human commodietie.

The economic growth driven by consumption was glorified without regard for the negative effects on debt, mental health, or the environment. In polyamory, the growth of partners and relationships was glorified without regard for the negative effects on partners, families, society and even we ourselves.


Now, enter¬†hyper-consumerism¬†and the need to buy and own. We want bigger houses, flashier cars, more clothes, the latest phone, etc. We buy things we don‚Äôt need just because there‚Äôs a blowout sale and we‚Äôre afraid to miss out. It never ends: there‚Äôs always something else to want, and to buy. And the same applies with humans, we want more partners, more relationships, better and moreattractive spouses, etc. We may not believe that we seek fulfillment in acquiring more, but our actions would argue otherwise.¬†",1,1730760867.0,InDefenseOfMonogamy,0,1.0,False

Anyway. I was just sitting here thinking about how all my other problems (except for anxiety and depression...they're still at the front of the line) have become so unimportant since I'd gotten my diagnosis this past July. I just passed the 4 month anniversary of getting my diagnosis and I've changed so much in just that short time. I've changed drastically over the past year, but it seems like an even more drastic change since earlier this year when I had started feeling really ill. I was hospitalized in late April/early May and got a transfusion and infusions of iron. I'm back to sick again. 6 months it had lasted. 

Sorry. I just needed to vent this because it's really frustrating to see how asocial I have become and how withdrawn and depressed I look. I got clarity today when I caught my reflection in the mirror in the restroom. I usually don't bother looking at myself (self-image problem)...I do what I need to, wash my hands quickly and leave. I don't like the air-hand dryer things, so I just shake them dry. 

I look so depressed and miserable, but I really am not that depressed today, nor anxious. I am pale as a ghost and confession: I really really should be in a hospital right now...but I'm too stubborn and scared to go. I'm not going so save your breath...your fingers. Ha ha.

Sex... SHE NEVER wants to do it. And before anyone points their finger at me, I do so much to help her, make her feel wanted, get her treats without her asking like juice, coffee, her favorite candy, ask her if we can watch a movie together, help with kids, dishes, chores, and more. She is a stay at home mom of a 6yo Girl, 3yo Boy, and 11m girl. I go to work ALL DAY from sun up to sun down and then when I get home I help her with things quite regularly when she needs help (If she is visibly stressed out or looks beat down) I always tell her how proud I am of her and how I think she's doing a good job and I tell her without her we wouldn't be where we are now. I make her feel important and wanted. I never turn her down for cuddling and I show a variety of different forms of physical affection to her. (Butt grab, hug from behind, kiss goodbyes, etc) 


That being said, I feel like I am doing my job as a husband as far as treating her right is concerned. But when it comes time for me to want intimate connection, she gets turned way off and shuts down. She starts complaining about it and says how tired she is. She used to ALWAYS be down. 6 in the morning, 12 mid day in the closet away from the kids, 8pm when the kids are down. Now.... she never wants to. I tried to talk to her about it but she instantly pointed the finger at me and told me that sex with me is to much. I have kinks. None of them involve any sort of pain, no costumes, I never try butt stuff, just some verbal stuff. Sex is always accompanied by her complaining pre-sex, during sex telling me to hurry, post sex telling me I took to long, etc. And she just treats it like a chore and when we FINALLY have sex, she seems like she would rather be doing anything else other than sex with me. It's not a physical attraction thing on my end. I don't think it is any variance of a size issue. I'm lost. I try my best and think I do really good at being a biblical husband... I've never cheated on her or anything like that. Take the red flags and throw them out the window.

It has now gotten to the point where we can't even talk about sex. I don't want to have sex with her even when I'm at the highest stage of being turned on, because I worry she is just going to get mad at me for something. And everytime after sex she acts like I have to act perfect for the next few weeks because she gave me something I wanted. And if I get upset about something minor or major, she says something along the lines of me being allowed to be upset because she gave me sex. But our sex had no connection anymore. 

It's at the point now where I'm in a constant spiritual battle of lust. I don't want to spend time with her, I'm stressed, and more. God freed me from porn years ago and I've caught myself going back towards it. I have no outlet for my intimate feelings and the world is full of lustful women who just want to ruin a marriage.

A month or two later, I was fresh out of that breakup, though he didn‚Äôt know it yet. He then asked me for drinks as a thank-you for a work favor I‚Äôd done for him.

We got those drinks in early October and had a fantastic night out ‚Äî cocktails, arcade games, a rooftop bar, and much talking. He was noticeably flirty. I eventually confided in him about my recent breakup but asked him not to ‚Äúmake it weird.‚Äù He got even flirtier. We ended up back at his place, where he touched my legs a bit, but nothing happened. I fell asleep in his bed, and he took the couch.

The following week, I invited him over while I was house-sitting nearby. We stayed up until 2 a.m., watching my favorite movie. I told him he HAD to watch. The whole time, he was being flirty, touching my legs, and eventually acknowledging, ‚ÄúI think we‚Äôre both trying to figure out what we want here.‚Äù I told him I was down to hook up but made it clear that, fresh out of a breakup, I wasn‚Äôt looking for romance. I wanted to set that boundary so he wouldn‚Äôt feel pressured into anything more than fun and friendship.

We hooked up that night. He invited me to work with him at a coffee shop a few days later. He was casual, just talking like a friend. I asked if our hookup had made things weird and suggested that if it did, we didn‚Äôt have to do it again. He replied that he wanted to ‚Äúdo that a bunch more times.‚Äù So, a few days later, we met for drinks, talked, and kept things light. He asked what I was doing for Halloween, and I said I was going as Olive from Easy A, and my ‚Äòfriend‚Äô would be the love interest, Woodchuck Todd. He just was quiet at that. There was some talk of hooking up again. He emphasized that he wanted to make sure hooking up wasn‚Äôt the ONLY thing we did. So we didn‚Äôt that night.

Since then, he‚Äôs been texting pretty regularly. It‚Äôs flirty and fun, and he‚Äôs sent me songs with lyrics that hint at ‚Äúplaying it cool when you like someone,‚Äù which felt a bit pointed.

Our most recent hangout felt almost like a date. We grabbed chips and margaritas, went antiquing, flirted, and even made out a bit in the store. He slapped my butt a few times, and when I asked about his dating life, he claimed he wasn‚Äôt on the apps at the moment and seeing anyone (which I took with a grain of salt). He did ask if I liked the songs he sent, and I casually said yes, dropping the topic afterward.

Later, we ended up back at his place, hooked up, and then cuddled a bit. He asked for my opinion on his apartment decor as I walked around the place in his shirt but soon left as he had to be up early for work. Afterward, he texted me, saying, ‚ÄúSorry for the early night! Looks like you left me by my lonesome.‚Äù I joked that he ‚Äúkicked me out,‚Äù adding that I wouldn‚Äôt have minded staying over. He replied nervously, ‚ÄúWell, the world‚Äôs our oyster! Who knows what the future holds üòÖ.‚Äù I told him to calm down; I was just flirting.

After thinking about it for a few hours, I realized I might have a crush on him. To avoid blurring lines further, I decided to be upfront. I texted him, saying: ‚Äòidk if casual is for me. I'm not going to lie; I do have a crush. To keep things simple & stay friends, let‚Äôs take a step back and maybe pause on hanging out for a bit. Hope you understand.‚Äô

He responded: Hi, hi, sorry for taking so long to respond. I honestly think the friendship is a lot more important than the hooking up part, so if we need to take a step back and pause for a little while, I‚Äôm perfectly OK with that. I‚Äôd rather keep the friendship intact, and I appreciate you saying all this.

I jokingly responded, ""Pardon my French, but why did I say ‚ÄòI like you‚Äô cryptically, and you politely said 'k'? lol...."" No response. I then go: ""My god, I'm not doing this. Thursday, make time for like an hour.""

He then says, ""I mean, I completely understand, but I didn‚Äôt mean to brush it off."" Obviously, I like you, too, but I do still feel that taking a little step back is important for the same reasons I mentioned. I can meet for a bit on Thursday, though!

I just say: ""I agree we're on the same page, which is why I mentioned it first. See ya Thursday. 

I feel like I come across as needy. I‚Äôm not looking for a declaration of his feelings, but I want to see if we agree. Part of me would be thrilled if he said he had a crush on me, too, but I‚Äôm not expecting that.

That was Friday. I still had a blast over the weekend, posting myself out with friends, having drinks, etc. But it's now Monday. It was constant, and now it's not. I know I had a part in making this confusing, but I'm scared to text or call now.

I‚Äôm looking for a long-term relationship where we respect each other‚Äôs opinions, boundaries, and values; where we can ultimately build trust with each other and feel safe around each other. 

I strive to be as authentic as possible and i respect others who do too! 

I‚Äôm in the field of psychology, and i‚Äôm seriously passionate about music, art, food, mental health, coffee, anticaste movement, radical social justice, decolonising the self, and so on. I‚Äôm an atheist ‚Äî it‚Äôd be nice if you are too!

I‚Äôm emotionally self-aware, and i know i have many flaws (no one‚Äôs perfect, least of all myself), and i actively work on being a better person than my past self. 

I‚Äôd love to get to know you if any of this is intriguing to you! I hope your age is 26+ hehe",1,1730760604.0,SFWr4rIndia,0,1.0,False

We tried dating briefly at the beginning of 2020, but the pandemic and a bit of distance created tension. He became distant, I ended things, and eventually, he started dating someone else. A few months later, he called & apologized for how things ended, and we reconnected as friends due to our shared industry, where burning bridges isn‚Äôt ideal.

Fast-forward four years, and we coincidentally live in the same city. We kept bumping into each other at local coffee shops, chatting casually and decided to reconnect as friends. Over time, we began hanging out more frequently, but it was purely platonic.
