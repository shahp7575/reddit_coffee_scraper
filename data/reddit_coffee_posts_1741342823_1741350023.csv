Th next morning, Charles and Lisa prepared for their experiment.

Charles wore a dark blue button-up shirt, the sleeves neatly rolled to his elbows, paired with well-fitted gray slacks and polished leather shoes.

Lisa, on the other hand, had chosen a more relaxed outfit.

She wore black jeans, a fitted white blouse, and a beige trench coat draped over her shoulders.

Her head was covered in a headscarf, and dark sunglasses rested on her forehead, ready to be used if needed.

They got into Charles’ car and drove toward the city center. The sound of the engine and the occasional rustle of passing cars filled the silence between them.

Forty minutes later, they arrived and parked.

Towering glass buildings reflected the morning sun, and wide streets bustled with pedestrians weaving between cars.

Shops, cafés, and electronic billboards dominated the streets, displaying advertisements in bold, colorful projections.

They sat in the car, observing their surroundings.

Fifteen minutes later, Lisa stiffened.

“There,” she murmured.

Charles followed her gaze and saw a car pull smoothly into a parking space.

The driver’s side door opened, and Lisa’s clone stepped out.

The relaxed atmosphere inside their car vanished instantly and was replaced by tense anticipation.

She was dressed in a dark gray blazer over a navy blouse, paired with fitted slacks and heels, an outfit Lisa often wore for professional meetings.

“She looks exactly like you,” said Charles.

“That bastard.”

Without hesitation, the clone turned and walked toward the tallest building in the area.

As the glass doors slid shut behind her, Lisa and Charles exchanged a glance.

They stepped out of the car, locked it, and made their way toward the adjacent mall.

The mall was spacious, its multi-level design lined with high-end stores and kiosks.

A massive digital screen played advertisements on one side of the atrium and its changing images casted brief flashes of color on the polished marble floors.

They walked toward a café near the edge of the atrium.

The café was a cozy yet modern space with warm lighting and wooden furnishings.

The scent of freshly brewed coffee and baked pastries filled the air and created an inviting atmosphere.

The seating area was lined with cushioned booths and round tables, where customers sat engaged in quiet conversations or focused on their phones.

Charles slid into a seat, while Lisa approached the counter to order tea.

As part of their plan, she spoke in an unusually clipped and careless manner, deliberately mispronouncing her words.

The café worker, a young woman in a crisp uniform, blinked at her in confusion. “I’m sorry, could you repeat that?”

Lisa subtly studied the woman’s face. There was no recognition.

She smoothly corrected herself and returned to the table.

“She didn’t notice me,” she said to Charles as she sat down.

“That’s a good sign.”

They waited, their eyes discreetly scanning the café.

A few minutes later, the clone entered.

She approached the counter, placed an order, then settled at a table not far from them.

When her breakfast arrived, she took a few bites, then, without a word, she rose and headed toward the bathroom.

Lisa immediately followed.

Inside, one of the bathroom walls was lined with mirrors and sinks that gleamed under soft white lighting.

Lisa found the clone at the farthest sink, washing her hands while gazing at her own reflection.

Lisa stepped to the sink beside her and turned on the water.

For a brief moment, their reflections stood side by side, identical yet different.

The clone glanced at Lisa once and no more.

No double-take, no tension. Just a passing glance before she dried her hands and left.

Lisa remained, watching the door swing shut behind her.

“Did she not recognize me?” Lisa thought as she watched her reflection on the mirror.

She took a slow breath, then turned off the faucet and exited the bathroom.

Charles looked up as she returned to the table.

“She didn’t notice,” Lisa said quietly.

Charles exhaled. “That’s good.”

Without lingering, they left the café, the clone still sitting at her table, unaware of the two pairs of eyes that had been watching her.

They then made their way back to the car and drove toward the children’s school.

Still trending down. around 3 lbs lost this week, though i have plateaued in the past months for abit here and their. Been playing the game since oct 1 2024. Started at 411 now 353.4. Goal weight is 250 but id be ecstatic to hit 300 as its been more than 20 years since I've been there. I do get on the scale daily just to see what eating 2 lbs. meat and gallons of water a day does and how my body changes throughout the day, though i don't update my weight trend except on Fridays. FYI 45 male Tennessee...ASL if anyone remembers that. lmao. sorry i digress. 

Anyway, ive been pretty strict. Thanksgiving day and Christmas week  had alil upset but quickly recovered. I was tracking calories. now its more intuitive though i do log stuff just to keep me honest about what may be affecting things. Coffee and non-dairy creamer is my downfall so am working on eliminating that.

Typical meal is 2lbs meat...weather minced beef, pork shoulder, or steak. Supplement with eggs and minimal dairy. Though with the price of eggs its definitely less than 2-3 months ago. Not doing a whole lot of butter or bacon and while i think about it i probably do need to up the butter intake to get my fat macros above protein.

It’s a logo for a fictional café which wants to be a hangout and safe space for queer people and allies. 

I‘m really struggling with color choice here. I want it to be bold, so I went for a purple-yellow combo. Second one is a combination of purple (often associated with the queer community) and brown (-> Coffee/Espresso).

About the asterisk: 
In German (my native language and also the language from whatever region this company would be located in), the asterisk is commonly used to make words gender neutral. So for example, instead of saying ""Bäcker und Bäckerin"" you could smoosh them together to an includive form which would be ""Bäcker*in"". Thus, in context of this logo, the asterisk is supposed to be a play on this kind of inclusive language, conveying the message that everyone is welcome.

Hence people modify OPV springs to bring them closer to the optimal range.

I suspect my machine is doing this too. I don't have a pressure gauge of any kind, but my best 18g in 36g out shots were achieved in about 20 seconds or even less. I can slow it down by grinding finer, but then it tastes bitter, muddy, no descernable flavour notes, texture is mega syrupy, like too much. The 20 seconds ones taste nice but can be a bit weak.

I like acidity in my coffee but getting it out of my freshly (but not too freshly, around 10 days ago) medium roasted beans is hard. I gring too fine -- it's bitter. I grind too coarse  -- it's still bitter, not sour,  which is strange (no, I don't have the sour-bitter confusion). Can't get any sweetness.

Are these signs of too high pressure? If not, what are the signs, i.e. why do people modify their OPVs?

I'm confident in my puck prep (I do WDT, tamp on a level surface the same way), and tried different temperatures and beans. Dose is correct for the basket. The machine/grinder is a Ninja Luxe Cafe Essential.",1,1741347911.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

1j5llrp,https://www.reddit.com/r/creativewriting/comments/1j5llrp/joe_k_part_18/,Joe K - Part 18,"Expecting the same treatment as last time, K was surprised to find the door already open and hesitated at the thought that the confrontation he was about to initiate might turn violent. He could end up in the hospital like Katie's friend, badly beaten or worse. With everything he now knew about Broker, how could he be sure he didn't have a gun? He tentatively knocked and after a few seconds, did it again, less so. ""Come in, mate, I'll be ready in a few minutes."" Was it too late to change his mind? K had to negotiate two packed suitcases in the hall as he went through to the lounge. The first thing he noticed was the vacant walls either side of the television - no film posters and no discolouration to indicate there had ever been any. Katie had told him that Broker changes his decor to suit who he's trying to impress - she must have told him about their film night. The shelves were nearly empty too, as if his various psychological enticements were all in the storeroom waiting to be dispatched to the front line whenever a battle was due to commence. Broker was bent over, with his back to K, filling a sports-bag with documents he was taking out of a low draw.

""Going somewhere, Bro?"" said K, in a voice that wasn't his own, but might have come from a film he'd seen, causing the journalist to turn around so fast he fell on his arse.

""Shit, I thought you were... my taxi driver.""

""Do taxi drivers normally scare the hell out of you?""

""Ha! Sometimes - 'Are you talkin' to me? Are you *talkin'* to me'... so, have we had any luck with that article, yet?... ... Are you alright, Joe? you seem a little...""

""Enough, Broker... I want to know everything.""

""Everything?... Look, I'm in a bit of a rush here, in case you haven't noticed, can we do this when I get back?"" Still sat on the floor, he recommenced packing his bag, expecting K to turn around and leave, but the more anxious, weak and guilty Broker appeared before him, the more confident, powerful and righteous K became, as if the universe was balancing itself out.

""There's a girl in hospital right now who's lucky to be alive, and I know you've got something to do with it."" K braced himself to receive and dispatch an onslaught of accusations regarding his mental health, disguised as friendly concern and post-scripted with some brotherly advice to book another appointment with Dr Sinha, but he was completely unprepared for what actually happened - Broker broke. The man that K had once regarded as the epitome of self-control was weeping like an aspiring toddler to who gravity had just taught a lesson in hubris. Not knowing what else to do, he stared out of the window and waited for Broker to compose himself. A taxi pulled up and, before the driver could get out, he shielded his eyes from the emerging sun and gestured for him to put the meter on.

""It wasn't supposed to go down like that, Joe, you've got to believe me. I had no idea what the fucker was capable of... She was just supposed to get him on video, the classic sex and drugs setup, something they could hold over him, but he discovered the hidden camera and...""

""Who's 'they'? The Castle?""

""I'm sorry about that, I got a little carried away. They're just some powerful people in his party who didn't want him to defect and cost them the seat... and a whole lot of embarrassment... and possibly the next general election... but really, they just don't like traitors. Betraying the country's one thing, but betraying the party - that's about the only thing they ever really hold each other to account for.""

""But I thought you gave him me to *help* him defect, so you could get a story out of it?""

""It was just to make him think I was going to help him, and get him to trust me so I could set the trap. There was never any story... I'm not a journalist any more, Joe... I'm a blackmailer.""

""A blackmailer?... So that's what that business with the cash machines at Supervixens was all about - blackmail?""

""I had no choice. Have you ever heard of Valentin Tereshkov?""

""No.""

""You've heard of the Russian Mafia, though, right?"" After everything K had learnt today, this small revelation came as no surprise - it made perfect sense that Broker's network of influential people should include at least one underworld character. ""A few years ago I was doing pretty well as sportswriter, hanging out with footballers and boxers at all the best bars and restaurants... and racetracks. The only way I could keep up with my new, rich friends and their expensive tastes was to gamble and gamble big, and for a while it worked. It got to the point where I was regularly predicting the results of six or seven matches every weekend. I'd be looking at the kick-off times, weather forecast, training schedules, squad harmony, player's favourite grounds, player's previous clubs, player's private lives - was their wife pregnant? was their mother ill? were their kids being bullied at school? were they secretly gay? were they eating too little? eating too much? drinking too much?... gambling too much? I had so many formulas and spreadsheets I might as well have been a fucking accountant. After my brother died, things started to spiral... No, that's not true, I would have done it anyway, I was living the high life and I didn't care about the cost. I was drinking champagne in a box at Villa Park when Tereshkov approached me with a twinkle in his eye, and a smile on his face like he could smell the desperation on me. He knew, as well as I did, how bad my debts were, and he new, better than I did, how close the banks were to shutting me down. So he offered me a way out and, although the interest was a lot more reasonable than you might expect, there was a catch. There were two things about me that he could use - my clean reputation and my contacts. From then on, I was working for Tereshkov. Using my cover as a journalist, I would find ways to compromise high-ranking police officers, public prosecutors, politicians and anyone else he could use to make his life easier - people who value their reputation above all else.""

""But you only need one mistake - one honest cop, one honest politician - and it's *your* reputation that's ruined.""

""'Out of the crooked timber of humanity, no straight thing was ever made.' Immanuel Kant said that.""

""Immanuel Kant was a real piss-ant, you can meet a lot of straight people, if you make the effort."" said K, though he seldom made any effort himself, and as far as ""straight"" goes, he was barely breaking even today.

""You can meet a lot of crooked ones too, like Lord McQuarrie. He's a very useful man for a Russian gangster to have in his pocket, and I'd set him up good. Then he turned around and offered me enough money to pay off my debts in return for setting Hogarth Stone up. I knew there was more to it than that, of course. He wanted me on the payroll so he could use me to get something on Tereshkov, as if he's dumb enough to fall for a play like that. He would've killed me before I'd even got close. He'll kill me anyway when he finds out about Titorelli Close.""

""How will he find out?""

""Fucking Dmitri.""

""Dmitri?""

""Dmitri Tereshkov. As you know, I haven't been entirely honest with you, Joe, we have a mutual friend.""

""Katie?... Yeah, she told me everything.""

""Everything? Well, that explains it. You know about her punching him in the balls at Supervixens, then. I didn't want to take him there but I had no choice. He'd just been dumped by his latest girlfriend and was already wasted when he turned up at Vanya's house. Vanya's his brother, you met him the first time you came to my house - tall, great hair, cute smile? - no? Well, as much as he loves his kid brother, he's seen all this shit before and his five-year-old daughter was in bed so he said to me - 'Why don't you take him to Supervixens?', as if I wasn't stressed out enough with the setup going on in my flat...""

""Wait, this was the same night?""

""She didn't tell you that?... I took him to the club and two hours later I was still babysitting this arsehole, doing my best to laugh at his racist jokes and thinking why don't you just pass out already, when my phone goes. As soon as I saw Stone's number I knew something had gone badly wrong, so I ran outside to take the call. The first thing I heard was her pleading for help, and I could tell it was being dragged up from the pit of her stomach with every ounce of energy she had left... I'll never get it out of my head. It wasn't a human sound, it was... like a puppy trapped in a well - the most desperate, painful thing I've ever heard. I wanted it to stop so much that I was actually relieved when she was silenced by a blow landing inches from the phone. He left me hanging for what seemed like minutes before his voice filled the void, taunting me with the chilling calmness of a horror movie psychopath. 'Oh dear, what have you done to you're little whore? Really, Broker, what kind of a fool do you take me for to try a stunt like this? Have you no respect? You probably think I'm going to ruin you for this, but you'd be wrong.' Then his tone instantly changed into the animal roar of a raving lunatic. 'I'm going to fucking kill you for this!' he screamed, and hung up. I had to do something about Dmitri, so...""

""Dmitri? You didn't phone the cops?""

""How could I? I couldn't risk Tereshkov finding out, so I had no choice but to get over there myself, but I couldn't just dump Dmitri - he would've called Vanya and Vanya would've called me... I figured I'd pay one of the girls to take him home but, when I got back in the club, he was clutching at his crotch and swearing vengeance on Katie with every vile insult his tiny brain could latch on to, and her giving it right back. Everyone was looking at me to do something - even the bouncers, who knew who his father was and were too afraid to get involved. So I tried to calm him down before he went for her. 'She's fucking schizo,' I told him. 'She'll be on the next plane back to Kiev.' Which is when she turned her anger on me, shouting that we were finished - in a Welsh accent, which must have convinced Dmitri of my diagnosis because it shut him up long enough to talk him into letting me take him home.

'Fuck that,' he said, when we were in the car. 'I'm out of blow, do you know where we can score this time of night?' With no way to shake the little prick and an even bigger problem to deal with, I needed to think fast.

'I know a guy on Titorelli Close who might be up,' I said and pretended to text someone. We drove across town, with him giving me a detailed description of how he was going to cut up that Ukrainian whore's face if he ever sees it again. When we arrived, there was a cop car and an ambulance parked outside the block. I pulled up a safe distance away, my thoughts oscillating between praying she was still alive and wishing I wasn't.

'What are you waiting for?' said Dmitri. 'Fuck the fuzz, if they say anything just tell them you're with me... well?' Well what? I thought.

'Well, where's the money?' I said. He fished a pile of five pound notes out his pocket and handed them over.

'Get as much as you can, and be sure to tell him who it's for,' he said. When I looked up, I could see two paramedics exiting the block with someone in an oxygen mask on a stretcher. We were both still alive... for now.

'I hope that's not our man,' said Dmitri. As the ambulance sped passed us, two cops came out of the block with Stone in handcuffs, looking like he was enduring an unnecessary inconvenience but taking it in good spirits. 'I hope that's not our man,' said Dmitri. I waited for them to drive by, got out and checked the windows in the street to make sure that any nosy, insomniac neighbours had lost interest. I didn't know how serious the girl's injuries were, or if a forensics team was on the way, so I had to get in and out as quickly as possible.""

""For the cocaine?""

""For the camera. Any investigation would discover it was my flat, so my DNA wasn't an issue, the main thing now was that camera. Had Stone destroyed it? Did the cops already have it? As I was frantically searching the bedroom, I looked up to see Dmitri standing in the doorway - I was in such a mad panic that I hadn't even closed the front door. 'I hope you're looking for some blow,' he said.

'Funny thing,' I said. 'I'm actually the dealer's landlord, so when he didn't answer, I let myself in. I haven't found any bags but there's a couple of lines on the coffee table in there if you want to help yourself... I don't know where he's gone, I've been trying to call him... maybe those cops scared him off... I wonder what that was all about?... domestic, I guess...'

'You're so full of shit,' he laughed.

'No, really, it's my flat...'

'I know that. I knew this was your place as soon as we got here, I've been here before. I was parked outside when that bald judge was in here, in case anything went wrong like it did tonight, I guess you didn't think of that, did you? *Your face* when you saw the fuzz,' he laughed again. 'I'm not sure the old man will see the funny side though.' As far as I know, he hasn't told his father yet - the temptation to blackmail a blackmailer was too strong. He's been asking me for fifty grand in cash but I'm not sure if he really thinks I've got it or if it's just some game he's playing.""

""What about all that art you've got? some of that must be worth something.""

""Not everything I told you was a lie, Joe, I *am* storing that stuff for a friend - a Russian friend who will soon want me dead. He uses it for collateral and, in the mean time, keeps it here for me to impress our potential partners with. Even if I thought it could buy me some time, it's mostly forgeries, and the few pieces that aren't... well, you couldn't exactly walk into Sotheby's with them under your arm, put it that way. I've strung Dmitri along as best I can but I know he's getting bored, it's only a matter of time before he signs my death warrant. And if he doesn't, Stone will. And if he doesn't, McQuarrie will.""

""Why McQuarrie? He doesn't know you've burnt your bridges with Tereshkov, as far he's concerned, you might still be useful. And as far as they're concerned, Stone's no longer a threat, he can't defect now that he's resigned.""

""As far as they're concerned he's more of a victim in this than she is - whatever else he is, he's one of them. All they wanted to do was teach him a lesson and guarantee his loyalty, now they've got a by-election in one of their previous strongholds, and it's all my fault. They're all coming for me, Joe, and I've got to disappear before it's too late."" He zipped his sports-bag shut and stood up. ""I know you've got no reason to trust me, but I've got one last piece of advice - don't tell anyone about any of this, especially the authorities, it won't help the girl's case and it definitely won't help yours.""

""Well, let me help you with yours,"" said K, the mixed bag of emotions he'd felt for this complicated, certainly destructive, if uncertainly motived, man finally settled on pity. They picked up a couple of bags each, left the house and walked down the steps to the waiting taxi. ""Did you ever find that camera?""

""No. Either Dmitri found it that night and didn't say anything, or Stone threw it out the window before the cops got there, and someone recovered it later.""

""Where will you go?""

""As far away as possible. But, to get there, I first need to borrow some money off an old friend... Actually, to get to an old friend, I need to borrow some money off a new friend."" K gave him the twenty-pound note he had in his pocket.

""Thanks, Joe, and, for what it's worth, I'm sorry. You didn't deserve to get dragged into this, and neither did Katie - would you tell *her* I'm sorry, too?""

""Sorry?"" said Katie, when he got back to the car. ""For what he said about me or for costing me my job? Why couldn't he come and tell me that himself? I hope you told him where he can shove his apologies."" K could've opened up a conversation about Broker's motivation behind his behaviour in, and regarding her, employment at, Supervixens - to protect her from the psychotic gangster she'd punched in the balls. And he could've opened up a conversation about the psychotic gangster's father and Broker's urgent need to disappear before he was ""disappeared."" But that could've have opened a conversation he had no desire to start now, or possibly ever. And it could've opened up feelings that Katie had only recently shut away and he definitely had no desire to do that, either. It had already been a very long day and, unable to process the huge amount of information that had been dumped on him, K saw no reason not to take Broker's last piece of advice.

""No, I just asked myself what Robbie would do and politely accepted his apology.""

""My ways better... coffee?""

""I know a great place.""

In the Charles Mingus booth, K claimed it was impossible not to be uplifted when listening to his music and offered to lend Katie *Ah Um* and *Oh Yeah* as proof. She claimed not to have a record player, and when K reminded her that they'd listened to *Ege Bamyasi* on it less than a week ago, she said - ""Did I say 'a record player'? What I meant was 'any intention of listening to jazz as long as I bloody live'. You gonna eat that chicken?""

""I thought you weren't hungry?"" said K, sliding what was left of his meal over the table.

""No, I just couldn't decide what to have. I've been feeling a bit nihilistic today, I think I might need to go to the doctor.""

""You've read the article then?""

""I had no idea you were neurodivergent.""

""Aren't we all.""

""I would hope so, it'd be a pretty boring world, otherwise, wouldn't it?... Are you alright though, babes? I get the feeling there's something you're not telling me.""

""Don't believe everything you read, especially if it's been written by a politician.""

""Still, isn't it nice to have someone on your side, right? - someone important, I mean. And as politicians go, she seems like a good one, I might even vote for her myself and I've never voted in my life, never saw the point really."" Why couldn't he tell her that there was no one more important to him than the girl with the jerk sauce dribbling down her chin?

""I don't think there is, usually, but this could be one of those rare exceptions where it might actually make a difference, and not just to me.""

""That's settled then. She's helping you, she supports the NHS, she wants to raise taxes for the the rich and raise the minimum wage - which will come in handy for me, now I'm looking for a job - and her earrings are lush, look."" She showed K a photograph from the online version of the article on her phone, which she then slightly shook in front of his face to emphasise her next question. ""Do you know if this has made any difference to your case, yet?""

""I'm not even sure who's dealing with it now. As far as I know, it's still in limbo between departments. I do appreciate her trying to help, but I don't expect miracles.""

""You should give her a ring though, now that you and her are butties. Maybe you could introduce us, she might be able to help me get my shifts back - equal employment rights for strippers or something.""

""I'm not sure that would help her election campaign - there's a lot of people around here that would like to see Supervixens closed down. Besides, I should warn you, she's a feminist.""

1j5lh39,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_One_Scallion_6415/comments/1j5lh39/best_hotel_room_furniture_layouts_for_maximum/,Best Hotel Room Furniture Layouts for Maximum Comfort,"When guests check into a hotel, they expect a comfortable and relaxing experience. The right furniture layout plays a big role in making a hotel room feel inviting and functional. A well-planned room layout ensures ease of movement, maximizes space, and enhances the overall guest experience. Below are some of the best hotel room furniture layouts designed for maximum comfort.

# 1. The Classic Layout: Bed as the Focal Point

One of the most common and effective layouts is placing the bed as the central focus. In this arrangement:

* The bed is positioned against the main wall, usually opposite the entrance.
* Nightstands are placed on both sides for convenience.
* A desk and chair are set near the window to provide a comfortable workspace.
* A seating area with an armchair or small sofa is placed in a corner for relaxation.

This layout ensures easy navigation and a balanced, cozy atmosphere.

# 2. The Open and Airy Layout

For hotel rooms with limited space, an open layout helps make the room feel bigger. Key features include:

* Minimal furniture to avoid clutter.
* A bed against the longest wall to free up floor space.
* A wall-mounted TV to save space.
* A small table with chairs instead of a bulky desk.

This design is great for budget hotels and modern, minimalist properties.

# 3. The Suite-Style Layout

Luxury hotels often use a suite-style layout, which separates different areas for sleeping, working, and relaxing. This layout includes:

* A bedroom section with a large bed and stylish bedside tables.
* A living area with a comfortable sofa, coffee table, and TV.
* A work corner with a desk and chair.

This arrangement is perfect for business travelers and families who need extra space.

# 4. The Space-Saving Layout

Smaller hotel rooms benefit from smart furniture placement to maximize functionality. This layout often includes:

* A bed with built-in storage underneath.
* A foldable desk or wall-mounted workspace.
* Multipurpose furniture, such as an ottoman that doubles as a storage unit.

This setup ensures the room remains uncluttered and practical.

# 5. The Home-Like Layout

Some hotels aim to create a ""home away from home"" feel with a cozy, residential-style layout. Features include:

* A bed placed at an angle or with a unique headboard to add character.
* A soft, cushioned reading chair with a side table.
* A well-lit desk for both work and personal use.
* Warm lighting, rugs, and artwork to enhance comfort.

This type of layout works well for boutique hotels and long-stay accommodations.

# 6. The Accessible Layout

For hotels that accommodate guests with mobility challenges, accessibility is key. This layout includes:

* A bed with ample space around it for easy movement.
* Lower furniture heights for convenience.
* A spacious bathroom with grab bars and a walk-in shower.
* Wide doorways and minimal obstacles.

An accessible layout ensures that all guests feel comfortable and welcome.

# Final Thoughts

A well-planned hotel room layout is essential for guest satisfaction. Whether you are designing a luxury suite or a budget-friendly space, thoughtful furniture placement can make all the difference.

Filtered water, raw sugar, whole almonds (min 3.8%), coffee powder (1.4%) (robusta arabica), mineral (calcium phosphate), emulsifier (sunflower lecithin), sea salt, gellangum, natural flavour.

1.0 was supposed to be *the* moment, right? Six years of buildup, and what’d we get? A story that’s a slap in the face—cryptic ADA lines, no aliens, no climax. Load the final delivery, and it’s over. Black screen, done. I expected temples, an alien saga, something epic—not a fade-out. The community’s lost too—managers gone, devs mumbling about “maybe updates,” no direction. I mastered it fast, and now there’s no purpose. It’s like they forgot us vets who carried this game. I’m sitting here, factories silent, feeling like I wasted my loyalty.

# What would actually made it awesome?

This game could’ve kept me hooked for years, not months. Instead of a one-shot final phase, I’d have made it a living gig: build a bridge to Earth and *keep it running*. Post-1.0, you’re on supply contracts—“Earth needs 20,000 screws, 5,000 plates, 1,000 heavy frames, monthly.” Tight deadlines, basic-to-advanced mixes, constant pressure to optimize. Tie it to the shop—deliveries earn tickets for new toys like mega-conveyors or fusion drones. That’s not an ending; that’s a purpose. My factories wouldn’t be gathering dust—I’d be scrambling, engaged, alive for another five years.

# Resources & Aliens - What I Expected

The resource crusher? A letdown. Grinding stuff into oblivion for points feels hollow—why not make it *mean* something? I’d turn it into a space elevator stockpile—stack resources there, watch them beam up to Earth as you hit quotas. Visual, satisfying, tied to the story. And aliens? The game teases temples and mysteries but delivers squat. I expected a post-phase reveal: hidden temples, each with a boss (alien guardians, maybe), guarding artifacts for crazy tech—teleporters, anti-grav belts. Optional, so casuals can skip, but for me? A reason to explore, fight, build. Not mandatory, just epic.

# DLCs to Make It a Universe

1.0 could’ve been a launchpad, not a tombstone. I’d drop DLCs to keep it fresh:

* **Food Supply**: Farms, bio-processors, feeding Earth’s billions.
* **Wood Tech**: Logging, new chains, earthy vibes.
* **Colony Life**: Build a settlement here—housing, happiness, a marketplace where I manage supplies to keep pioneers thriving, not just working. Each twists the formula, builds on the base game, keeps us hooked. Annual drops could’ve made Satisfactory a 10-year franchise—players like me would’ve eaten it up, not burned out.

# What Do You Feel? Are You With Me?

This is my dream—long-term grind, real resource purpose, alien adventures, DLCs that evolve the world. It respects us early players, gives us a game worth our six years. Instead, I’m in this void, betrayed by a team that didn’t ride the wave. Could this have saved it for you? What’s your take—any tweaks, any hopes? I’m crying over my silent factories—tell me I’m not alone!",0,1741346301.0,SatisfactoryGame,22,0.37,False
1j5l7i2,https://www.reddit.com/r/NonBinaryTalk/comments/1j5l7i2/came_out_to_my_wife_in_a_public_diner/,Came out to my wife in a public diner,"This is a bit of an update to my [earlier post](https://www.reddit.com/r/NonBinaryTalk/comments/1j2g231/anxiety_about_email_signature_pronouns/) about how I was feeling anxious about thinking about adding my pronouns to my e-mail signature, which was really about whether or how to come out as NB. 

People here were SUPER nice about it, which I'm really grateful for. A few folks encouraged me to talk to my wife, and to my own amazement I actually got a chance to. We both work full time and have kids, so finding time to have a heart to heart is hard. But one morning this week we got to spend a couple of hours having a coffee/work date with our laptops in an old fashioned diner. 

I told her in light-hearted way that was having a dilemma about putting pronouns in my e-mail signature that I wanted her advise on when she had a moment. She initially made a joke like 'don't tell me you want to be a they/them!' but not in a mean way, and I brushed it off. (She later apologised for saying this, but it really didn't bother me).

When the time came to talk about it, I admitted that I didn't feel like I could put He/Him because I felt like a He/They. I thought I could keep the tone light, but pretty soon I was looking up at the ceiling trying to blink back tears. 

She reached across the table and held my hand when she saw how emotional I was, and asked why I felt that way. The best way that I could think of to describe it is that when I picture my family, I imagine myself alongside my  brother and sister, and I think 'It's so interesting that my parents have one of each - one boy, one girl, and one in between.'

My wife and I are both 42 and have been married for 15 years, so she knows my heart pretty well. She said that she sees me as a man, but that she's always known that I am more feminine emotionally. She told me she accepted who I was, and asked a lot of really good questions that let me know she was taking it seriously. What did I want her to call me? (Nothing different) Did I want to talk about this with our kids? (No) Did I want to wear her clothes? (No)

I explained that I've always felt different, but I couldn't figure out what it was. I've known since high school that I'm not gay. I know I don't want to be a woman. But when I learned about non-binary identities in my mid-30s I was like 'ohhh, maybe that's it' and that feeling never went away. I got really choked up telling her that if I had known in high school what this was, I would have embraced it then. 

The thing is that I don't want to change much about how I present to the world. She saw my pronouns dilemma about figuring out how much I want to share about myself with the world, which I guess it kind of is, but it's also about being able to accept this part of myself. 

Having my wife hold my hand steadfastly across the table as I made choking sounds trying not to bawl my eyes out in that diner made me feel that this was ok, and that she accepted me. And if she could accept me, then I could too. 

I've still had some anxiety about whether coming out was the right choice, but honestly the last few days I've felt such a huge weight off my shoulders. It is a relief to not feel like I have to perform as a 'man' to myself or to my partner, and that I can just be what I am. 

Thank you if you've read this far - I just wanted to share this while it's fresh in my mind, and I hope it can help give hope to someone else. <3 ",6,1741346239.0,NonBinaryTalk,0,1.0,False

1j5l30g,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1j5l30g/trying_to_finalize_my_plan_niche_zero_or_timemore/,Trying to finalize my plan - Niche Zero or Timemore 064s [$600],"I've been wanting an espresso machine for years and decided this is the year. I've already changed my plan from the Breville Touch Impress or Oracle Jet to seperate machines. I've spent an excruciating amount of time trying to decide on a grinder. I think I have finally narrowed it down to the Niche Zero or Timemore 064s. I wanted something ""not Chinese,"" but all of the Italian grinders don't seem so compelling based on all the reviews. I was willing to risk the QC issues on the DF64 gen 2 for the price, but the noise is an absolute no go. I need something ""quiet."" I'm really hoping I can use this stuff every day without waking up the whole house. I also think I've given up on my desire to use the grinder for espresso and drip/filter. I guess I'll just keep my old Ariete Grinder Pro for that. 

I need to decide on a grinder first because if it's quiet enough where I can use it every day, I'm willing to spend more on the espresso machine. I've decided on the Rancilio Silvia Pro X, but if I can't use it every day and only on the weekends after everyone has gotten up, I'll just get a Bambino Plus (and maybe I will decide just to save the $1000 and get the Bambino anyway). I wanted to get something before all these tariffs and crap raise the prices even more. I think I'm leaning toward the Niche even though it ""may not be as competitive"" in today's market but the Timemore seems to be the only other one I could consider due to the noise. Still though, the Timemore was $400 when all the reviews came out and it's now $600, so it seems like both have gone up about the same amount. The reviews are still saying the Niche is fantastic for espresso and being that the grinder I have now is conical, I bet it'll still be fine for filter coffee (which is what I'd use it for until I get the espresso machine and then stop so there aren't issues with fine/coarse mixing when switching back and forth). It sure looks like the build quality and such is better with the Niche, which is why I'm leaning that way unless someone has a reason I shouldn't. ",1,1741345729.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

1j5kwz0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AppleWatchFitness/comments/1j5kwz0/question/,Question,"Hi. 
Just a quick question I’m confused.
So I now weight  53kg… I walk 30+steps a day sometimes 35/40 depends how busy I am. Fast 14/15hrs a day… 
I eat the same everyday. Two meals… I’m gluten and dairy and wheat and soya free no added sugar and salt, I don’t snack or drink coffee or tea no crap or treat days Just two meals… back in September 2024 I weight 49kg I was happy there, no diet changed just the same meals daily.. my foods are made from scratch barely any ingredients.. my cal intake maybe 1200 something just under 1300cals. Maybe less. I’m not any more hungry than what I eat…. Continue 30-35k steps a day… why have I gone from 49 to 53kg? My body wise bit different, maybe my thigh looks abit thicker which I’m guessing muscle weight from the amount steps I do? 

There’s a lot of foods I can’t eat as don’t agree with my stomach I believe I’m coeliac and IBS or triggers my ectopics bad so hence what I eat daily as I consider my “safe food” so What I eat daily 
After 14/15hr fast
Buckwheat for my first meal made from scratch only 4 ingredients dairy and gluten free no sugar coconut milks gluten free baking powder and vanilla extract and cinnamon …
Second meal…
Home made gluten free wraps which made with one ingredient… which is gluten free white bread flour and coconut oil, with water honestly not a lot, I have two of these wraps made… 
Adds inside romaine lettuce and grated carrots and heck chicken chipotles.

This was my diet before I got to 49kg whole time… now from September to now. I’ve got 53kg…. Would this be water weight? Muscle weight? 


I don’t drink much just two cups of raw coconut milk and one turmeric tea a day….im confused how I’ve gained… from 7st 12lbs to 8st7lbs 

Im 34yrs and 5ft 2 

Thanks for getting this far !

Woke up with increased chest pain and later same night started coughing up spoonfuls of blood and blood clots, along with nausea, headache, chills, hot flashes, etc.

I just don't know what to do to pass time.  Let's face it, all of us are dying, right now.  No one is immune.  Some of us just go through it earlier. 

This morning I woke up feeling strange,  the only word I can find for it.  Drove to Wawa to get a cup of coffee and got slammed with bad nausea and vomiting out the car window.  Then got dizzy and felt out of sorts.  Had pain earlier today in my right chest and took pain meds and Zofran too.  Also was change day for 100 mcg/hour fentanyl patch.   On 18mg Dilaudid every 2 hours as needed,  methadone 140mg in the morning, and 90mg in the afternoon,  and the 100 mcg patch.  Dexamethasone 2mg 2x daily, benzonatate 200mg 3x day,  guafenesin 200mg every 4 hours, triamcinoline cream 4x/day for medication-caused eczema on my arms, hands, stomach,  chest, and ankles, Klonopin 2mg 4x daily for anxiety and panic attacks, Xanax 2mg as directed for panic attack management only,  medical cannabis edibles,  Adderall 20mg, 20mg morning,  20mg afternoon,  10mg at 5pm only if required for ADD or excessive drowsiness,  Compazine 10mg for nausea & vomiting,  Haldol liquid, Levsin 0.125 as needed.

My question is, just how long does this go on?  I woke up feeling OK, then went downhill when I went out.  Now, I'm ok.  I think the pain meds helped, and the Compazine and Zofran definitely did, now I  wonder what future symptoms I can expect...",3,1741345009.0,hospice,1,1.0,False
1j5kwbp,https://www.reddit.com/r/libraryofshadows/comments/1j5kwbp/the_experiment_begins/,The Experiment Begins,"Dr. Samuel Reed adjusted his glasses as he scanned the file in front of him. The latest subject, Daniel Holt, had checked into the Institute for Sleep Research three nights ago, suffering from chronic insomnia and vivid nightmares. The experimental treatment involved deep sleep stimulation—a method designed to enhance REM cycles through low-frequency brainwave induction. The project had shown promise in preliminary trials, but Daniel’s case was unique. His insomnia had worsened over the past year, and none of the conventional treatments had helped.

Dr. Reed glanced at the clock. 11:45 p.m. It was time.

""Are you ready, Daniel?"" Dr. Reed asked, his voice calm yet clinical. He had conducted this experiment multiple times before, but something about tonight felt different.

Daniel nodded hesitantly. ""Yeah… I guess."" His voice wavered, betraying the nervous energy beneath his composed exterior. He adjusted his position on the hospital-like bed in Room 306, exhaling shakily. The sterile white walls, the constant beeping of monitors, and the scent of antiseptic made him uneasy. He had always hated hospitals.

A nurse, Clara, approached with a clipboard. ""Just relax, Mr. Holt. We’ll monitor everything. If anything feels off, we’ll be right here.""

Daniel gave a weak smile, but deep down, he wasn’t so sure. His nightmares weren’t just bad dreams. They felt real. Too real. He had woken up screaming on multiple occasions, drenched in sweat, unable to shake the feeling that something had followed him back from the dream world.

Clara gently placed a set of electrodes on his temples, pressing them into place with careful precision. ""All set. Dr. Reed, we’re ready.""

Dr. Reed tapped a few commands into the terminal, and the overhead lights dimmed. A low-frequency hum filled the room as the sleep-inducing machine powered up, its rhythmic vibrations syncing with Daniel’s brainwaves.

""I need you to take slow, deep breaths,"" Dr. Reed instructed. ""Let yourself drift.""

Daniel did as he was told. His eyelids felt heavier with each passing second. The room faded into a blur. The last thing he saw was Dr. Reed scribbling something in his notes, his face unreadable.

As the sedation took full effect, Daniel's body relaxed completely. His heart rate slowed. His breathing became deep and even. The monitors registered stable readings.

But then… something changed.

A flicker on the screen. A brief surge in brain activity. A spike that shouldn't have been there.

Dr. Reed frowned, his fingers tightening around his pen. ""That’s unusual…"" he muttered.

Clara leaned in. ""What is it?""

""His readings are off the charts. I’ve never seen brainwave activity like this before. It’s as if… he’s entering a REM state faster than normal.""

The monitor beeped faster. Daniel’s eyes darted beneath his eyelids, his fingers twitching.

""Increase observation frequency,"" Dr. Reed ordered. ""Let’s see how deep he goes.""

Clara nodded, adjusting the settings on the machine.

Inside Daniel’s mind, something shifted. He felt like he was falling—faster, deeper, through an endless tunnel of darkness. Distant whispers echoed around him, voices he couldn’t understand. Then, just as suddenly as it began, the falling stopped.

He was standing in a room.

But it wasn’t Room 306.

It was a small apartment, dimly lit by the flickering glow of a neon sign outside the window. The hum of city traffic drifted in. A coffee table sat in front of him, covered in scattered papers and an empty whiskey glass. A framed photograph rested on the table.

He picked it up.

The picture showed a man and a woman, smiling. The man looked… familiar. Daniel's heart pounded as he traced his finger over the image. It was him. But not him.

The woman in the photo? He had never seen her before in his life.

Then, from behind him, a voice whispered.

""James… you’re home.""

1j5kudx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness_India/comments/1j5kudx/i_puked_after_workout/,I puked after workout,"24M, 5'7"". After two months, I started to do gym from yesterday. Within these two months, I was in sedentary lifestyles, having pizza, fried, processed foods, sometime no food for whole day. Before joining gym from yesterday, I started to have a good lifestyle and started taking meals which I used to consume during my workout phase. 
On workout days, I usually feel dizzy, yawning, teary eyes and little headache which same happened to me yesterday and I continued to do gym. But, at my last excercise I started to feel real bad and then I stopped at very moment then leaves the gym. 
My gym is about 2 km away from my home and I used to commute through my bike. Before, leaving from Gym I bought electrolyte drink (tetra pack) from pharma. I was standing there for like 30 min to drink it all but unable to and then I throw it away. After travelling for next 500 meters from gym, I was unable to concentrate on road because I was having watery eyes, unconscious so I parked my bike and sleep on it for next 30-45 min. When, I woke up I was still feeling bad and decided to travel faster in order to reach home early. After covering 1 km from gym I had to stop at very dark area because I couldn't able to ride my bike and I was feeling like I am drunk and about to puke which I did. 
After, puking I feel refreshed and headed to my home. But, it's next day and I am having chest pain.
Yesterday, in pre workout I made a shake of 1 glass of full cream milk + 2 bananas + 1 tbsp peanut butter + 34 gms of oats + 1 coffee sache (2rs Nescafe) = Blend. Then, after 2 hours I hit the gym and that happened to me.
Previously, I used to consume 74 gms of oats soaked in water with 2 bananas on it. 
So, my question is why I feel that bad because I never experienced this thing in my life?
I am having chest pain right now, should I still continue to do gym or take rest?
Any suggestions so that I can improve myself? ",2,1741344746.0,Fitness_India,4,0.75,False

1j5ktz4,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1j5ktz4/the_experiment_begins/,The Experiment Begins,"Dr. Samuel Reed adjusted his glasses as he scanned the file in front of him. The latest subject, Daniel Holt, had checked into the Institute for Sleep Research three nights ago, suffering from chronic insomnia and vivid nightmares. The experimental treatment involved deep sleep stimulation—a method designed to enhance REM cycles through low-frequency brainwave induction. The project had shown promise in preliminary trials, but Daniel’s case was unique. His insomnia had worsened over the past year, and none of the conventional treatments had helped.

Dr. Reed glanced at the clock. 11:45 p.m. It was time.

""Are you ready, Daniel?"" Dr. Reed asked, his voice calm yet clinical. He had conducted this experiment multiple times before, but something about tonight felt different.

Daniel nodded hesitantly. ""Yeah… I guess."" His voice wavered, betraying the nervous energy beneath his composed exterior. He adjusted his position on the hospital-like bed in Room 306, exhaling shakily. The sterile white walls, the constant beeping of monitors, and the scent of antiseptic made him uneasy. He had always hated hospitals.

A nurse, Clara, approached with a clipboard. ""Just relax, Mr. Holt. We’ll monitor everything. If anything feels off, we’ll be right here.""

Daniel gave a weak smile, but deep down, he wasn’t so sure. His nightmares weren’t just bad dreams. They felt real. Too real. He had woken up screaming on multiple occasions, drenched in sweat, unable to shake the feeling that something had followed him back from the dream world.

Clara gently placed a set of electrodes on his temples, pressing them into place with careful precision. ""All set. Dr. Reed, we’re ready.""

Dr. Reed tapped a few commands into the terminal, and the overhead lights dimmed. A low-frequency hum filled the room as the sleep-inducing machine powered up, its rhythmic vibrations syncing with Daniel’s brainwaves.

""I need you to take slow, deep breaths,"" Dr. Reed instructed. ""Let yourself drift.""

Daniel did as he was told. His eyelids felt heavier with each passing second. The room faded into a blur. The last thing he saw was Dr. Reed scribbling something in his notes, his face unreadable.

As the sedation took full effect, Daniel's body relaxed completely. His heart rate slowed. His breathing became deep and even. The monitors registered stable readings.

But then… something changed.

A flicker on the screen. A brief surge in brain activity. A spike that shouldn't have been there.

Dr. Reed frowned, his fingers tightening around his pen. ""That’s unusual…"" he muttered.

Clara leaned in. ""What is it?""

""His readings are off the charts. I’ve never seen brainwave activity like this before. It’s as if… he’s entering a REM state faster than normal.""

The monitor beeped faster. Daniel’s eyes darted beneath his eyelids, his fingers twitching.

""Increase observation frequency,"" Dr. Reed ordered. ""Let’s see how deep he goes.""

Clara nodded, adjusting the settings on the machine.

Inside Daniel’s mind, something shifted. He felt like he was falling—faster, deeper, through an endless tunnel of darkness. Distant whispers echoed around him, voices he couldn’t understand. Then, just as suddenly as it began, the falling stopped.

He was standing in a room.

But it wasn’t Room 306.

It was a small apartment, dimly lit by the flickering glow of a neon sign outside the window. The hum of city traffic drifted in. A coffee table sat in front of him, covered in scattered papers and an empty whiskey glass. A framed photograph rested on the table.

He picked it up.

The picture showed a man and a woman, smiling. The man looked… familiar. Daniel's heart pounded as he traced his finger over the image. It was him. But not him.

The woman in the photo? He had never seen her before in his life.

Then, from behind him, a voice whispered.

""James… you’re home.""

They came back with my order and extra ice cream and a fizzy lemonade, both for me because they don't eat sweets.

1j5ksjk,https://www.reddit.com/r/coffeejp/comments/1j5ksjk/glitch_ginza_a_disappointed_review/,"glitch ginza, a disappointed review","Just had a bit of a bummer experience at Glitch in Ginza. People regard it as some kind of coffee pilgrimage of a lifetime so I wanted to share my experience here.

Went to buy some beans to brew and get a latte, on a beautiful day, the line wasn't too long for a change. Latte was decent but nothing amazing, they ask you to pick beans for your coffee first then come back to the counter for buying beans to take home. I went to the counter when there was no one so as to not be in the way, but despite this it was super rushed and I felt like they were even commenting on me in Japanese as I was looking at the beans.

They showed me two varieties to smell but none was really my cup of tea. I asked if it's possible to smell all the ones they have in stock, they only have about 6-7 in stock from the ones they brew so I didn't think that was too unreasonable but that seemed to annoy them. They asked me to move to the side, which I did, then they sat people where they asked me to stand. They put away the beans I was smelling while I was smelling them so I had to ask for them to take them out again and they seemed pissy at that. I asked the price for the beans bc the prices there can be crazy ... there's pour overs that are like 6000y (45$) so despite being someone who spends quite a crazy amount on coffee, that shop is still beyond I can personally not look at the prices on.

I realize it's of course a high volume shop, and I wasn't lingering, all this happened in about a few minutes. Felt like the service was rushed and unpleasant, vague feeling of being talked about which is never a good vibe.

To me it's really become an ""inbound don"" kind of place, you only see tourists there, almost all Chinese, and almost never seen a single Japanese customer. Those prices are fine if they deliver the goods but I really feel like it's hard for any coffee to be worth those crazy prices and on top of it to be rushed while choosing is just not for me.

I wanted to buy more varieties of beans and try several different ones but felt so put off I got the ones I already selected and left. If I hadn't been out of coffee at home I would have left without buying anything at all, tbh. I'm sure they won't miss my business but I won't be going back. Despite wanting to support local roasters, even paying crazy shipping, it's cheaper and just as good if not better to order from BW or another top roaster abroad. I ordered two lbs from BW (900g) and paid about 4000y in shipping and it was still cheaper than Glitch. Today I paid 7000y for 250g of coffee while being rushed and felt like shit after leaving the shop.

Anyways, not to knock on anyone who loves Glitch, they definitely have their place, their beans are decent, and I had one one God-tier latte there once but today's service made me feel like it's just overpriced unless you're visiting Tokyo for a week.",3,1741344523.0,coffeejp,10,0.72,False

I completely changed my diet to focus on dairy and vegetables, and I cut the caffeine down. My x-rays speak for themselves. My right leg is filling in, although my left leg is still healing a little slowly.

I was able to reduce my caffeine intake much easier than I anticipated. I started a few days by drinking 1-2 cups of coffee, then only tea after that. Then after a few days, I cut to one cup, and eventually decaf coffee. It seems I am more addicted to the habit of drinking coffee, than I am caffeine itself. Previously, I was drinking 1-2 pots of coffee daily. This reduction in caffeine has helped my healing significantly.

I was really worried last week when I saw my x-rays, but after looking at the ones from today, those worries are gone. I might ask Giotikas if I can do distraction, compression, distraction (0.25 mm each) so I add additional stimulus for osteogenesis while still lengthening slowly. We will see what he recommends.

On a side note, shout out to Voula (our nurse) for going above and beyond. She helped coordinate the ERC machine for when I land in Oregon, and she prepped prescription print outs so I can carry my medication while I travel. I made an attempt to reach out to Globus', and they weren't particularly helpful. I am grateful we were able to get this sorted, otherwise I would be sending my clothes home via FedEx, and the ERC machine would be my carry on.

I am very excited to head home. I have every supplement under the sun ready for me at home, many of which should expedite my recovery. I will also be close to family, friends and my girlfriend, which will make the remaining lengthening process much easier.

I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

1j5km6x,https://www.reddit.com/r/LoveLetters/comments/1j5km6x/to_that_evil_witch/,To that evil witch,"So I am writing you again, in my eternally sing-song lilting way, where I’ll wheedle around much longer than needed saying much less than what needs to be mentioned.

I miss you, deeply, passionately. I adored you. I still do. The longing, the pain, the frustration I can all still feel like it’s that day you let me go.

I don’t blame you for that. I have thought much about what might have happened had I torn that silly note out of your hands. If I’d never scrawled it 15 minutes before I met you. It was curious; I never expected you to react in the way you did. All I hoped to offer was an affirmation of the things I thought we both knew already, those secret half-spoken truths about how badly I want you near me. You left me utterly reeling and spinning, effortlessly.

In that one heinous moment just before I marshaled the courage to see you for the last time, when your best friend asked if I still had feelings for you. I hope you know, intrinsically, that when I answered no, it was a lie. I have wondered exactly what the hell I was thinking. In some sense, it felt like I had long reconciled myself to your lack; that I had too fully and too sincerely taken you at your word to keep an appropriate distance that I could not dare admit how I felt. Also, I mean no disrespect to your friend, but that question, innocent enough for her, is wretched and abominable for me. It is something so fantastically private, so incomprehensibly near to the center of my being, how could I possibly share it with her and not you? How could I stand an intercessor? 

On the one hand, perhaps if I had been more amenable to the ‘help’ of the crowd, things might have not turned out differently. Perhaps I could have enlisted your friends and we could have happily conspired. But also, in some sense, I despise your friend. That sort of collective involvement in our relationship was exactly what I hoped to avoid, what I dreaded so terribly. It’s why I simply walked up to you and started talking. It seemed so unfair. Why did your friend, who’s in a relationship, get to decide, get to spring upon me, get to ambush me with your care? As you may have grasped, I have a complex relationship with self-esteem. On the one hand, I consider myself highly able and observant, on the other, irredeemably wretched and base. In that jealous corner of my being, it seemed so certainly a plot, a trick to peel you away for good.

But then, in the days and weeks following this impactful moment, I reached out to you, and you responded, positively, even! How overjoyed I was to sit with you in a coffee shop even if just for an hour. How much I wish to see you again. Oh how do you resound in my being so well?

There was this sort of grand game, you know, the drama, the scandal, the tight-knit social world of a small liberal arts theater troupe. I hated it so much. All I wished for, the only one I craved, was you. 

I wonder, in the grand scheme, why do you stick so tenaciously in my head, what is it about you? I try to break down and analyze the logical pieces, to put a microscope to your magic, to try and prove it’s not real, to convince myself to move on. But I so desperately wish to not do that.

There was something so indescribably romantic about you. The idea of a childhood friend had always been captivating to me; that idea of unshakable longevity and certainty in each other. How miraculous it was to discover when you pried open my memories that you had been there in 1st grade. To rediscover you, by pure happenstance, on a whim of a whim of a decision, something about that struck me as inescapably lovely. And then, of course, the dramatic finale, the spurned note about my cares, the emotion in your voice. I remember that day so vividly, but I can’t remember what you said on the phone. Yes, you called me promptly, minutes later, I hadn’t even turned yet. And the emotion in your voice, that hideous mewl of regret and nausea and sorrow and self-loathing and acquiescence and I cried. I shuffled some automatic, polite response; I wanted to wail, I wanted to weep, I wanted nothing more than to denounce you, to reject you, to say you were lying. 

To think that you never cared at all is too heartbreaking. To think that the months and months of talking for hours and hours, were you really just putting up with me? Did you never really care for me? Or did you like being liked? If I’d never shouted it out loud to your face, would I still see you around?

There is some cruel, tempestuous pit inside me; it wants to hate you, to despise you, to see you as nothing but cruel and callous. But I don’t believe that, truly. I know it’s not true. I know you are one of the kindest and gentlest people that I have ever met. I suppose another aspect is the tragedy. To me, my feelings for you, our relationship as it was taking place, fitfully, awkwardly, but nevertheless, was something profoundly fragile and precious. It felt like to even whisper it to you would blow out the flame. Perhaps this might explain the disconnect, the steady feeling that burnt and built within me for the better part of 16 months, and the signals of but which you could perceive, of which I so assiduously ironed out of your view. It was strange, it felt like you were in on it. Like with a coy wink and a nod, we were getting one over on everyone. We were actually going to do it on our own terms, both tacitly aware of the other’s hidden charms and intrigues, directly lovingly in a secret, merry war between two interested parties. It seemed so placid and serene and irrefutable to me that you reciprocated.

But at times, I wonder, how has it been so easy for you to ignore me? If you felt as strongly as I did, then how can you bear to stand apart so long? What crude and contemptuous things must you think of me? It is the most disgusting and wretched thought to me imaginable, that in some sacred corner, some holy way, that we could have been happy, together, joyous and in love. That all we could have ever dreamed and hoped for could have been real and for true, but now it never will be. 

Another thing, as you may have gathered, I had never had the good fortune to be a part of a sincere, genuine relationship. It felt finally like that could be about to change, that I could find someone so understanding and so full of warmth, and so self-servingly, get them to love me too. There’s a sense of scrivening. That I have held for far too long and far too greedily absolute and distilled bile. But it’s like that refuse is all I have left of you. There are more memories, too many to count, of our unflappably chaste and courteous relationship. Perhaps that is why? There was something so ideal about it, so guarded; I was so certain that oceans of current seethed just under the surface in us both. That we both struggled with the burden of our desire, that we both so wished, in our own muted language, some way to carry each other’s weight. Oh, speaking of the song ‘the weight’, did you know your name is in it? Did you know I didn’t know this? Did you know I think of you immediately whenever I hear it now?

I have one last thing, and then I’ll leave you in this pretended conversation with no-one but myself. There was this air of doom about the whole thing, wasn’t there? “In another life” you said, at that going-away party, the last time I’d ever see you in an official capacity. The way you tilted your head, the way your perfect curls bounced, the way your adorable face curled into a smile. You may not have noticed, but despite my feigned outward idleness, I was collapsing inside, like burning cathedral, mighty timbers and roofstones falling like pebbles and twigs in the inferno that you whipped up with just three words. I think we relished this aspect. I think it’s why I wrote you that letter. I wanted to prove to you how badly I adored you, how badly I needed you by my side. I wanted you in this life. 

We were trite, we were cliche, I was desperately in love with you and didn’t know it. In a way, I still am. It’s been almost 3 years now since then, and I still think of you frequently. Perhaps this is my own fault, for not moving on more aggressively, but how could I? When I had staked so much of my future world on you, when I couldn’t help it? My life is stagnant, I think consciously, some sort of proof that I’m still here, that I refuse to move on quite just yet, that you still haunt me. I’ll recall that you exist sometimes, that you’re alive and happy and well and still so brilliant, and that you’re completely out of my life. It’s devastating. It’s cruel. You know, you did have a tendency to bury yourself in work.

1j5klu9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1j5klu9/our_dog_is_sick_and_my_fiancé_is_stressing_me_out/,Our dog is sick and my fiancé is stressing me out,"So I (26 M) and my fiancé (28 M) have a dog. 

Background: There has been a lot of stress lately, and my fiancés grandma recently passed away. They were really close, and she was one of the few people who really understood him and was extremely important to the whole family.

He isn’t the emotional type, extremely logical, and I don’t pressure him to act a certain way. His mother has been.. a bit overbearing and doesn’t understand his grieving process and it’s stressing us out even more. 

(She is a very emotional person and keeps asking him how he is feeling and for example asked a bunch of times at the funeral if he wanted his own special moment with the urn. Thoughtful maybe, but my fiancé kept saying no to the point where he got annoyed. To him, his grandma is gone, and he doesn’t feel attached to her ashes. I get that. She doesn’t) 

Anyways, what I e noticed most is he struggles to sleep, is in a bad mood, occasionally cries cause he is stressed and exhausted. Completely normal and I do what I can to relieve that stress. I cook our food most of the time, maybe 70%, bring him coffee in the morning, do 80% of the care for our dog. I do my best to get his mother to back off but that’s only occasionally successful. 

On to the big current problem: 

Anyways, my knee is busted, I’m starting shockwave therapy next week. I can still walk so I take our dog for all his walks. However I struggle walking up and down the stairs of our apartment building. 

Our dog is sick and has diarrhoea. He whines when he needs to go and I need my fiancé to help take him out. This disrupts his work and I feel like I have to tell him a bunch of times before he gets going. (Our dog will whine, I tell my fiancé and he says he will do it but it takes up to 20-30 minutes before he gets up) In the end I just get me and dog ready to take him out and that’s when my fiancé will get up all annoyed like “I said I will do it!” And he takes him out for me. I don’t do it to be passive aggressive, I do it cause I don’t want to clean up dog diarrhoea from the floor!

It disrupts my work as well, especially having to be the only one who notices if our dog starts whining (he works with sound so wears headphones) and having to be on his case about taking him out for half an hour. 

He is super annoyed at our dog, that’s just sick. He can’t help it. And it’s stressing me out that he gets angry and huffy. And our dog is a bit hyperactive outside now (cause his tummy is all weird) and my fiancé will just leave his collar on when they get back. It’s like some way to punish our dog for being annoying. I mean it doesn’t hurt him at all but it’s so unnecessary. 

He is annoyed cause our dog “was just outside!” but a) he has diarrhoea and b) it’s not more than every other hour. 

I don’t want him to shit on our floor! We have had a few close calls already. 

I feel bad that I can’t take it all on cause I know he is stressed but my knee hurts so damn bad already with everything I do. ",1,1741343750.0,Vent,0,1.0,False

1j5khtk,https://www.reddit.com/r/findomtalk/comments/1j5khtk/chapter_4_deeper_the_price_of_submission/,Chapter 4: Deeper (The Price of Submission),"# Daniel had never followed instructions so carefully in his life.

For days, he obeyed **His Goddess** without hesitation. **Every purchase** came second to her. Coffee, groceries, gas—he never spent a dime without first offering something to her. Some days it was a small tribute, $10 or $20, but when his paycheck hit, he felt the urge to **give more.**

And with every beep of the card reader, her name passed his lips. Softly. Reverently. It had become **muscle memory**, a ritual as natural as breathing.

Still, it wasn’t enough.

He checked his messages constantly, hoping she’d give him something—anything—more to hold onto.

Then, just before midnight, she did.

**His Goddess:** *Have you been obeying?*

His heart slammed against his ribs.

**Daniel:** *Yes, His Goddess. Always.*

He waited. Three dots. Then—

**His Goddess:** *Prove it.*

A rush of nerves shot through him. **Prove it?** His mind raced—did she want screenshots of his tributes? A receipt with her name scribbled on it?

**His Goddess:** *Change your phone password to My Name. No numbers. No symbols. Just me.*

Daniel swallowed.

A long moment passed where he just stared at the screen. His phone password was **his**. A private thing. Something no one else had control over.

But wasn’t that the point?

His fingers moved before he could stop them. Settings. Password change. The keyboard popped up.

He typed her name. Letter by letter.

When the confirmation screen appeared, he hesitated for half a second. Then, **he hit save.**

His phone locked.

He lifted it again and entered the password. **Her name.**

A shiver ran through him.

**Daniel:** *It’s done, His Goddess.*

His pulse thrummed. She had to know what that meant—he had just given her access to something **he used dozens of times a day**. His muscle memory would adapt. His fingers would **type her name constantly, over and over, just to function.**

He wanted to message her again, to beg for more, but before he could, she sent something else.

**His Goddess:** *Set up an auto-tribute. Every Friday. I expect my payment without having to ask.*

Daniel’s breath caught.

That was a commitment. A **permanent tether** to her.

His stomach twisted, half anticipation, half fear.

**Daniel:** *How much, His Goddess?*

The typing dots appeared.

**His Goddess:** *Figure it out.*

A test.

She wanted him to **choose** how deep he would sink.

His hands shook as he opened his bank app. He calculated. He rationalized. He told himself he wouldn’t go overboard.

But when he set up the auto-payment, the number wasn’t small.

$250. Every week. **Guaranteed.**

He stared at the screen for a long time before confirming.

Another locked phone. Another typed password.

Her name. Again.

Again.

Again.

Then, just as he set the phone down for the night, a new message popped up. A voice memo.

He scrambled to press play.

Her voice was smooth, **mocking, amused.**

*""Mmm, look at you… all locked in now. You just made sure you’ll be thinking of me all day, every day. Bet you’re already picturing it—standing at checkout, fingers moving before you even realize, typing my name like a good boy. Cute. Pathetic, but cute.""*

She giggled, the sound **pure cruelty wrapped in silk.**

*""You’re such an eager little thing. I should start keeping a list of all the ways you prove you belong to me. Passwords, tributes, rituals… what’s next? Your paycheck?""*

A pause. Then a little sigh, almost sweet.

*""Mm. Sleep tight, pet. Hope you dream of me.""*

The message ended.

Daniel lay there, staring at the ceiling, **aching**.

She was inside his head. Inside his daily life. Inside **everything.**

And God help him, but he wanted more.
