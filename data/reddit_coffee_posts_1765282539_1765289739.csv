1pi8hl1,https://www.reddit.com/r/EntitledPeople/comments/1pi8hl1/woman_at_the_cafe_told_me_my_outlet_seat_was/,"Woman at the cafe told me my outlet seat was ""public property"" and tried to kick me out mid meeting","



Last week I was working from a small local cafe that has basically become my second office. They have good wifi, plenty of tables and exactly four outlets total, so regulars know the drill: if you grab an outlet, you order something, you stay reasonable, you dont camp all day on one latte. I came in around 8, bought a sandwich and a large coffee, and grabbed the small table in the corner that has an outlet right under it. I had a scheduled call with my manager at 9, so I plugged in my laptop and noise canceling headphones and started going through emails. Around 8 45 a woman I had never seen before walked in with two phones, a tablet, a tangled nest of chargers and this huge iced drink she had clearly brought from somewhere else. She did not order anything, just looked around, saw my outlet, and made a straight line for my table. Without even a hello she said, ""How long until you are done here, I need that plug, all my devices are dead"". I kind of laughed, thinking she was joking, and said, ""Sorry, I am actually about to be on a work call, my battery is at 18 percent, I really need to stay here for a bit"". She rolled her eyes so hard I swear I heard it and said, ""You can move to any other table, you dont own the electricity. This is a public place."" Then she set her cup down on my table like she had already decided.



Right then my manager pinged me that he was jumping on the call early, so I put one ear of my headset on and told her, ""I seriously cannot move right now, I have a meeting."" She got louder. ""You people with laptops think you are so important. I have kids to pick up later, I need my phone charged. Just unplug for half an hour, your little meeting can wait."" At this point the barista looked over, because this woman is basically half shouting. I told my manager ""sorry, one sec, weird situation"" and muted myself. I pointed to my half eaten sandwich and receipt on the table and said, ""I paid to be here, I am working, I am not moving. There is another outlet by the door if you ask that guy nicely."" She turned, saw an older man reading with his phone plugged in, and immediately went ""Sir, could you move, I have an emergency, I need that outlet."" He just shook his head and said, ""Maam, I am reading the news, you are not the only person in the world with a phone."" That set her off. She started ranting about how ""people these days"" are selfish and how businesses are supposed to provide charging for customers (again, she didnt even buy anything). Finally the barista came over and asked if there was a problem. The woman launched into this story about how we were ""hogging"" outlets and how I was ""refusing to cooperate"" with a mother. I quietly said, ""I am in the middle of my work shift, I am already on a meeting, I am plugged in because my battery is dying. She is not a customer here and she keeps yelling at me."" The barista looked at the giant outside drink, then at her pile of devices, and just went, ""Maam, if you would like to sit down and purchase something, you are welcome to use any free outlet. You are not allowed to harass other guests or demand they move. If thats a problem you will need to leave."" She huffed and said, ""So you are ok with people claiming public property now, good to know"" and stormed out, but not before yanking her cup off my table hard enough to splash sticky whatever all over her own hand. I unmuted myself, half expecting my manager to be annoyed, but he had heard enough to just say, ""Wow, people are wild. Do you need a minute."" I finished the call, tipped the barista a bit extra on my way out and apologized for the drama. Apparently after I left she came back in just to take pictures of the outlet area and told them she would be ""leaving a review"" about how they let ""rude laptop people monopolize resources"". I kind of hope she did, because the regulars here know exactly which kind of person writes a review like that.

1pi8gx6,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1pi8gx6/im_a_phone_operator_and_im_getting_strange_calls/,"I'm a phone operator, and I'm getting strange calls.","This is my first time posting, I want to write this down because I want to prove to myself that I'm not going crazy, that what I've been experiencing these couple weeks isn't a cocktail of coincidences blended with sleep deprivation and down right losing my mind.

I have been working for the last 4 years as a shift phone operator for large scale hotel, because I don't want to outs the company I work for and risk my job I won't be telling you which hotel I work for nor where it is. Now my job is to pick up the phone whenever anyone either inside or out of the hotel calls, it can range from a guest  calling for more towels, report something broken in the room that needs fixing, to people outside the hotel calling in to get some info or book a reservation with us.

My department has it's own office space away from the other departments with a key reader door that only we operators have a key for, no one outside our department can get in, not even a manager. We are usually 4 to 6 agents on shift on any given day with about 2 or 3 for the night shift, but recently we lost 2 of our night agents, one who changed careers to be a supervisor for the front desk, and the other who got terminated for attacking a the other night agent.

It came as a shock, I've talked to the guy a few times and he always seemed nice and even supportive when I told him I hoped to one day grow into a supervisory role in the company, so that's why when I heard he started beating the other night agent to the point security had to pull him off, I just couldn't see the guy I knew in my head to be the same I'm hearing about.

After the incident we had to temporarily close the office at 12AM, you see our office is open 24/7, we always have someone in office, in case any of our guest wake up in the middle of the night to report issues or ask for a delivery, because of that we quickly had to re-open the office. Seeing a chance to get a salary boost I offered to switch to the night shift, I already knew the job, and the extra work the night team had just amounted to make some daily reports to send to the management.

So that's how I got switched over to work the night shift, starting at 10PM and finishing up at 7 in the morning.

The first night went well, when the last day agent clocked out at 12AM, I was by myself in the office, I brewed up a pot of coffee in our break room and watched my shows on max, in the office we have two simple rules, answer the phone within 3 rings and keep your phone on available whenever your at your desk. Follow them and you can keep yourself busy with whatever whenever there's downtime between calls. Didn't get any calls my first night and just did my daily report which took me a little over an hour to get done, the hardest part that night was just adjusting my internal clock to stay up that night.

The second night though, I think maybe that's when this started, it was 12:33AM and it was just me in the office, I just finished making a cup of coffee when my first call came in, usually any call from inhouse guest will show their names with their room number, that way when we answer the call we can greet the guest by their name, it's that little extra touch we give to form a connection with our guest, but this call didn't have a name with the room number.

Now it's not strange for an inhouse guest call to not show their name, it can takes a a while for a name to register to the room when they first check in, so when the call came in, it didn't click with me right away how strange this call was.

I answered the phone and gave a warm welcome to the guest, but got nothing, it was just silent, had to double check to make sure I still had the caller on the line, I gave another hello, just to see if I get an answer, I was ready to hang up when the caller spoke.

Hello.

It came out of nowhere and to the point, didn't sound like a hello to see if I was still there, wasn't even a greeting, just a hello, the caller then asked who I was, told him I was the phone operator and asked him how I could be of service to them, the caller didn't say anything back to me, before I could even ask if he was still there he immediately asked me for my name. Part of my job is that I have to give my name to any guest who calls in, so they can know who they are talking to and who to ask for if something goes wrong with their order if they liked my service, so I gave the caller my name, Jimmy J.

Went quiet again, the caller wasn't speaking, I couldn't hear anything in the background, couldn't even hear them breathing on the phone, just no sound, the caller then thanked me and hanged up.

I've been working as a phone operator for over 4 years and I have gotten a fair share of weird calls, kids playing on the phone, drunken guest, even had someone call in to ask if we found the bag of sex toys they forgot in the room. So it's not anything new for me to get a call like that, but still, that moment got stuck in my head and I couldn't stop thinking about it.

The rest of my night went by fast, maybe had a couple outside calls that night, nothing that stayed with me like that first one.

The following night at 12:33, I got another call, from the same room, and still no name to it, I hesitated at first but picked it up by the third ring, before I could get a word out the voice on the other end asked, is this Jimmy? I said it was, after a moment of silence the caller told me that he lost a watch, I asked him to describe the watch to me, it was a stainless steel watch, with a cracked lens, but when I asked him when he lost the watch, he went silent again for a full minute.

I called out to him, making sure the caller was still on the line, he then answered back, saying he found the watch, that it was on his desk, he then hung up and for the rest of the night I didn't hear back from that room.

That morning when the AM team started coming in I asked my friend I work with, if he's heard of anyone getting strange calls from that room, shook his head and said not that he is aware of, just getting the usual rounds of guest pissed off they didn't the exact view the wanted or that they reached their limit for towels.  
Shrugged my shoulders and went home to sleep.

Day 4 was different, the other night agent finally came back to work, I wanted to ask her what happened between her and the other guy, but I didn't think she wants to relive that moment again so soon. The rest of our night went okay, couple calls, people complaining about their neighbors making too much noise, one guy asking for some beers to be delivered, and some kid way past their bed time making crank calls. That night went by fast, and yet it didn't sit right with me, it was the first night since I started getting those strange calls where that room didn't call in.

The next night was no different, a whole shift came & went without hearing from that room, even asked my co-worker before we left that morning if she had any strange calls, but no, she only got outside calls trying to book a room. I felt a little relieved, thinking maybe they checked out or just didn't need anything. Managed to relax and decompress on my days off, played Overwatch 2 with my buddy, just wanted to ignore those calls, but, no matter how busy I kept myself, I just couldn't.

Went back to work, I was working alone again , the other agent was off that night, I was kind of nervous, wondering if that room would call in again, but I figured by now they had to have checked out, it's been a week since that first call, but the moment I thought that, 12:33 the phone rang, it was the same room number without a name.

I didn't want to pick it up, each ring was echoing in my head, I didn't want to hear what the caller had to say, I answered by the third ring, I didn't know what to expect, but the voice I heard did catch me off guard, it was a toddler on the other line, I felt relief hearing that voice, that moment I knew whoever I was speaking with before was gone.

The kid in that chipper way kids have when the just learned a new trick was giving me a hello, like they just learned the word, I gave the kid a happy hello back asking if their parents were there. For a moment it went silent again, no background sound, no breathing, not even the sound of anyone moving the phone around, I then heard the same toddler's voice again say hello.

He kept repeating hello, but each new hello the pitch was changing, getting deeper, until his last hello sounded exactly like that man from the first call, what he said next freaked me out so bad I hanged up, he said. Hello Jimmy. We're not suppose to hang up on a guest until we hear them say thank you, but that moment  it's the only thing I could think of doing.

I didn't know what to make of that, did that man have a voice changer on him, am I being pranked, I didn't know and didn't want to call that room, I opened our reservation records app and looked up the room, I needed to know who was in that room.

My blood went cold when I searched the room, no results, no reservation for that room. Who was calling me?

I didn't answer anymore calls that night, I put my phone on unavailable.

That next night I didn't want to come into work, I didn't want to get another call from that room, but I have to work, they depend on me. The moment the last PM agent left, I was alone again, I dreaded that call, 12:33 is when the phone comes in each time, so I decided to put the phone on unavailable and head into the break room and wait until it was past that hour, I probably waited a good 10 minutes before I walked back into to my desk.

My chest started to tighten, I could barely breath, and my legs couldn't hold me up anymore, I fell to the ground from what I saw, on my desk there was a stainless steel watch, the lens on top was cracked, and the hands stopped at 12:33.

That moment I didn't know if I should run out the room or call security, my head was racing a thousand miles a minute, I tried calming myself and try to rationalize it, the only thing that could make sense was someone is pranking me, had to be. I call up security, telling them I found a lost watch in the office, and asked if they could come pick it up, also told them I think someone sneaked in the office and is trying to mess with me.

Security came up, I opened the door for them, told the guy that last few days someone has been messing with me and that this time they came into the office to leave a watch on my desk. I pointed towards it, but the security just asked me, what watch? I turned around, and it was gone, I didn't touch it and I was in the main office the whole time, no one could have run in and taken it from me without getting caught.

I told the guy to check the key reader and see who was the last person to open that door, he did a quick scan, and the last person to open it, was me, when I clocked in to work.

  
That morning I could barely sleep, every time I felt like I was drifting away, I could hear the work phone ringing, I was thinking to myself how stupid this was, why is this happening to me. I wanted this to stop.

  
When I went in to work that night, I decided I was going to keep the phone on unavailable, I would be breaking our office rule but I didn't care, I just didn't want to hear that blasted ringing. I sat by the desk closest to the entrance door and kept my eyes fixated on the only door in and out the office.

Finally after a bit of waiting, the time was 12:33, my eyes fixed on the door and every office phone set to unavailable, tonight I wasn't going to hear that phone ring, then I heard it, the phone was ringing, while it's not impossible for a call to come in even when set to unavailable, the person dialing needed to have dialed that specific phone extension. That moment I decided to move away and go the next desk, but the moment I did that phone started ringing.

I kept moving away, sitting at every desk, but no matter which desk I went to those phones would start ringing that same room number, that room was following me, wherever I went that room knew where I was heading to, but then I saw something, I never paid attention to it,  because it's one of those details from the job you didn't really put too much focus on, but now, seeing the same number calling every phone, I saw it.

  
The room calling me, was room 1233, and what's worse, the hotel doesn't have a room 1233.

  
I froze, I couldn't believe it, how did I not catch this sooner, then at the moment I saw a tall silloute on the screen behind me, before I could even turn to face it, or even just run away, the whole room went black. The power went out, and the only light in the room was the blinking red lights on the phone, I let out the biggest bloodiest scream imagined, I screamed so hard my lungs were ready to explode, I thought, whatever forces are doing this, they finally came to take me, I knew this would be my last shift.

  
What happened after, I don't know if you would call it a miracle or just blind luck, I personally want to believe the former, the time was 12:34, and the power came back in the room, whatever figure was behind me was now gone and I couldn't have been more relieved. 

As soon as my shift ended I talked to my supervisor telling them I can't go back to the night shift, not alone at least, I didn't tell her what happened to me, because I know no one is going to believe my story. I submitted my application to return to my day shift, and called in sick until the change came in. 

  
Since going back to my day shift, I haven't gotten anymore calls from room 1233, even when the time reads 12:33PM, someone else in the office took over the night shift, and when they did I made a point of telling them to never answer any room calls that don't have a name on it. They shot me a strange look, as if I was some hobo giving advice on crypto, but that's okay, I know what I experienced and they will too when they are the are by themselves at night and that clock hits 12:33.

I don’t know what to do and I really need some advice please?,"I’d really appreciate if even one person read this or the TLDR and gave me your thoughts and advice, I feel lost. I’m sorry it’s such a long post.

He began working at a coffee shop in the beginning of our relationship. I admit I was insecure back then as I was younger and had been freshly cheated on, as I had expressed concern about him not making close friends with female coworkers around his age. He had reassured me he would not and he would tell me if anyone tried to flirt with him and then avoid them.

Not even a few months after this, for some reason I felt extremely sick to my stomach while I was hanging out with him, everything in me wanted to check his deleted text messages. Don’t ask me why or for any logical reason, I genuinely had a horrible urge to check that I had never had before, it was probably coincidence. I asked in front of him and he all but yanked his phone away from me saying “wait let me explain” and blah blah, I finally convinced him to give me his phone and I had found deleted texts of her basically confessing she had liked him and no messages after that, which was extremely suspicious. I got mad, not at the situation, but because he tried so hard to lie to me about it. The texts had been from yesterday, and his reasoning of hiding it was because he didn’t want me to “make him quit his job” which I had never give any indication to and felt like an extremely weird response, which I never believed. (Important later)

Anyways that was the only incident I ever thought happened, I had cried because I was frustrated about him lying and hiding stuff as openness is really important to me, and we moved on, he promised to never lie to me again. 

Around our 9 month mark he broke up with me over text while I was at the gym. I broke down in a changing stall while the same day he was messaging a girl on insta and flirting, and going out with his friends to eat. A week later he begged for me back saying he was just in a bad place mentally (which he was) and he had made a stupid decision. I had found the girl in his blocked list on insta as I suspected something like this occurred, and he lied lied and lied some more saying she messaged him and he wasn’t interested and blocked her. I didn’t believe this for a second, so I messaged her on my own and found out the whole truth of him flirting, not even a few hours after he broke up with me. I told this part to show how he has a pattern of lying, I was hurt of course by the fact he could do that so soon after, but what really bothered me was the fact he could lie to me again.

2 months after this he changed jobs, got my name tattooed on his chest, and surprised me with it after work. I never asked him for this or hinted towards wanting this but it did make me feel more secure, and I took it as a sign he was actually committing this time. (Though it is kind of drastic 😬)

Fast forward to the present, he has really changed as a person and begun maturing, I thought all this was over. I feel much more secure and I’m in a way better spot mentally and took care of all my personal issues. However, in weak moments I always did wonder if he was telling the whole truth about his coworker, as I had never fully believed his story. I admit this was childish of me to do so long after, but for the first time I messaged her on my own for clarity and to make myself feel better. I thought since he didn’t work with her anymore and he didn’t have any connections it wouldn’t hurt to ease my mind..

She told me the whole story, and she was very nice. During when she first confessed over text, he had his male coworker message her for him with his message that basically said “I’m beginning to fall for you … there will always be a place for you in my heart … I hope we stay in eachothers lives … etc.” And nothing else happened during that. Around 7 months in, May 21st-May27th (2 weeks after my birthday and 2 months before he broke up with me), my boyfriend had begun going for walks around his neighborhood. I thought nothing of this, he told me every time he was going for a walk and said he really liked them because they cleared his head. In reality, he had been asking her to go on walks and flirting the entire time. He had told her that he had broken up with me, and on the last day before she left town, the 27th, he had grabbed her face and kissed her.

During when he broke up with me 9 months in, he had called her again and told her that if I ever tried to contact her to not answer me as I was crazy and would “call her names” or try to “fight her”. This was him trying to hide this entire thing from me, lying, again.

I confronted him about all this over the last 2 days, and he was extremely adamant about lying. At first he said that he never had his coworker send her those texts, then he admitted to it. Then he said he had never kissed her, didn’t admit it for about 30 minutes of grilling, then he said it was only a kiss on the cheek and he kept that lie firm until the next day. I eventually got so frustrated I asked him “Are you really going to die on this hill? Do you think i’m fucking stupid?” and he finally admitted to kissing her on the lips. He then denied going on multiple walks with her, and I got him to admit that too. This was everything, the girl assured me of that. His excuse for this entire thing was that he felt bad for rejecting her that first time. Now this pissed me off, it’s the most obvious lie ever. I knew exactly the reasoning, I told him he was insecure and he liked the validation from other women. He finally admitted that, too.

I know he loves me, and he is different from back then, but what makes me extremely hesitant to continue anything is the lying. At the same time, he loves to make me happy, and will buy my stuff for my hobbies randomly just because he likes to see my smile. He has a different friend group now(they were disgusting but I never said anything, he did this on his own), and has made a few good close friends. He’s never given me any other reason to doubt his loyalty.

I really don’t know if I should take the risk and try to work on things? He has said he would be open to couples and individual counseling and he has truly expressed being sorry. I just feel lost, I love him so much and all I’ve been doing is crying.

TLDR; Boyfriend hung out with a girl for a week behind my back and kissed her once, has lied to me about it for the last 1.5ish years, but has never done anything else.",1,1765289610.0,relationship_advice,0,1.0,False

For a long time, I wished for closure from him, for acknowledgment or explanation, but it never came. Eventually, I realized that closure had to come from the inside; I had to give it to myself. It was a slow, painful process, but through it I learned that true peace cannot depend on someone else’s apologies or recognition.

Today, he called to apologize. He expressed regret for his actions, acknowledged that I did not deserve the way I was treated, and said that this had been weighing on him. He even suggested meeting for coffee.

I was left with a mixture of emotions: confusion, disbelief, and above all, anger. His apology arrived long after I had already healed. I had grieved alone, found my own closure, and rebuilt a life where my past no longer dictated my present. His words, however sincere, could not undo the years of solitude I endured or the inner work I had carried out on my own.

This experience reinforced for me that closure is not something granted from the outside. It comes from within, cultivated through reflection, self-forgiveness, and the conscious decision to move forward. I healed without him. I found peace without him. Now, his apology...... while noted......changes nothing about the life I have built for myself.",1,1765289131.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

It is after a doctors appointment. We never spend time just talking together. I am just super nervous and awkward so I am scared it is going to seem super weird lol.

I know it sounds crazy, but we never just sit down and talk.

What are some things we can talk about? How to not make it feel awkward? Also after 30 minutes how can I get things moving along without hurting his feelings?

**1. The Emotional Layer (Stop Numbing)**

* **The Trap:** I used porn to numb bad feelings (insecurity, sadness, loneliness).
* **The Loop:** Bad Feeling -> Porn -> Numbness.
* **The Fix:** When the ""tingling"" starts, **PAUSE**. Ask: ""Am I actually horny, or just sad/bored?"" Identify the emotion to break the loop.

**2. The Accountability Layer (No Babysitters)**

* **The Trap:** I gave my wife control of my devices (blockers, locks, checking in).
* **The Result:** It destroyed her mental health and made her my ""policewoman (kinda hot, jk ;P).""
* **The Fix:** Take responsibility back. You cannot outsource your willpower to your partner.

**3. The ADHD Layer (The Hard Reboot)**

* **The Trap:** ADHD brains treat boredom as physical pain. The brain demands dopamine *now*.
* **The Reality:** Meditation doesn't work during a dopamine crash.
* **The Fix:** **The ""Hard Reboot.""**
   * *Step 1:* Immediate Physical Activity (Pushups/Jumping/Shaking) to force blood to the brain.
   * *Step 2:* Change Environment (Leave the room).
   * *Step 3:* ""Clean"" Dopamine (Coffee/Game/Music).

**4. The ""Forbidden Fruit"" Layer (Stop Hiding)**

* **The Trap:** My brain gets excited *because* it's forbidden. The secrecy and the fear of getting caught provide an adrenaline rush that feels like arousal.
* **The Fix:** **Remove the secret.** When I feel the urge to hide my screen (even if I'm just on Youtube), I deliberately show it.
* **The Logic:** Brain says ""Hide!"" -> You say ""Nothing to hide"" -> The excitement dies.

# FULL STORY BELLOW

# The Layers of My Porn Addiction: A 20-Year Analysis

My last post got a lot of attention, but I realized I didn't really share the full picture of my experience. Trying to stop this addiction has been a 20-year battle, and there is a lot more to it than just ""stopping."" I decided to write down the full breakdown of the ""layers"" I had to uncover. It’s a long read, but if you are struggling with the same patterns, I think you’ll find this helpful.

# 1. Treating the Root: Emotional Regulation

>*Emotional regulation is a skill we begin learning as infants. Unlike many animals, humans are born dependent on parents not just for survival, but to learn how to function. We are born wired for connection. The way we are parented triggers a cascade of changes, genetically, cognitively, and socially, that have long-term effects on our ability to self-soothe. (Reference: The ""Still Face"" Experiment).*

I didn't get that essential connection as a child and teenager. This void resulted in layers of protective mechanisms and unhealthy patterns. I learned that silence equals safety, that love equals pain, and that the weight of the world was somehow my fault.

Around age 11 or 12, my brain sought independence, which is natural. However, because I hadn't learned to process emotions healthily, I made poor decisions. In the early 00s, I turned to the Internet. It seemed to cover every feeling I had: boredom, sadness, anger, love, and sexual arousal.

I was hooked immediately. Before this, I was an active, physically healthy child who played basketball and socialized. But the addiction took over. I gained weight, became isolated, failed in school, and didn't finish my degree. By 16, I hit a peak in internet usage and a rock bottom in well-being, experiencing suicidal thoughts for the first time.

This internet addiction continues to this day. While I managed to cut out social media, gaming, and binge-watching Youtube, I never managed to stop watching porn. It followed me everywhere, occupying a fucking large part of my daily thoughts.

Through years of therapy, I learned to identify the root causes. I realized I had programmed my brain to follow a specific loop:

**Bad Feelings -> Porn -> Orgasm**

Now, when I feel that nervous ""tingling"" in my chest urging me to watch porn, I pause. I try to identify if I am actually feeling insecure, bored, or sad, and if the loop is trying to run simply to numb those feelings.

I had to start confronting the feelings I had bottled up for over 20 years. For the first few weeks, this approach worked incredibly well, and I was able to make real progress. Yet, I felt that something was still not right. I realized that my emotional coping mechanism wasn't the *only* thing triggering the porn usage...

# 2. Treating the Triggers: Day-to-Day Regulation

Even after addressing my emotional issues in therapy, I decided with my wife that I was unable to use devices responsibly for a while. Just holding a phone in my hand would trigger something; lying down with a laptop was basically a death sentence for my sobriety.

I decided to introduce a few strict measures in my day-to-day life. **But, these would turn out to fail miserably, and I'll explain why in the final part of this story.**

I gave my wife full power over my device usage. She would hide them and lock them, and I was only allowed to use a device in front of her. I added blockers to all my devices via OpenDNS, meaning if I wanted to peek, I would have to manually change the DNS settings first. I even bought a smartwatch with LTE so I could leave the house without a phone, hoping the trigger would simply vanish if the device wasn't there.

As a nuclear option, I established accountability: I gave my word to my wife that if I found a way to watch porn despite these barriers, I would call her immediately and tell her, ""I'm about to watch.""

**But there was one variable I didn't calculate in all these equations: My wife.**

Imagine the responsibility she felt. In her head, she became responsible for her husband’s health. Imagine the pressure. Every time I did something unusual, she became nervous, checking on me.

After finally seeing this, I took the responsibility back. I understood that there is no ""babysitting"" for this addiction. I have to learn to regulate this myself, not her.

# 3. Treating the Engine: ADHD & Dopamine Regulation

>*""ADHD brains crave quick dopamine hits to combat understimulation, and porn’s endless novelty provides exactly that, leading to compulsive patterns that reinforce each other.""*

I have ADHD, and I didn't understand the huge role it played in my unhealthy porn usage. I didn't even seriously consider it in the beginning. Then I read that ADHD brains are 2.5x more likely to be addicted to porn. I was like, *wtf*.

I figured out that, in the background, there is another loop running parallel to my coping loop. My brain created this cycle:

**Dopamine Shortage -> Porn -> Orgasm -> Dopamine Shortage -> Porn -> Orgasm -> (Repeat until exhaustion)**

My ADHD brain doesn't want to deal with a dopamine shortage and punishes me if I don't feed it right away. I’m talking about physical pain, headaches, a feeling of nausea, and a nervous tingling in my genitals to the point where I feel like I could go insane.

The triggers are everywhere. I could eat a snack and the loop would start running. I could feel joy and the loop would start running. I could be hyperfocused on something, stop, and the loop would start running. I can even sit at my laptop writing this post on Reddit, get a little hit of dopamine from feeling great about writing, and the loop starts running. Great times to be alive!

So how the fuck do I deal with that loop? It seemed impossible to break.

Well, first I had to acknowledge that there is no ""soft"" way of getting out of this. Meditation, taking a bath, or going for a walk? Nope. Here, a **hard-reboot** of the system is necessary, followed by introducing a new loop:

**Dopamine Shortage -> Quick Physical Activity -> Environment Change -> A bit of Dopamin without the Internet -> Breathing.**

Basically, I break the dopamine shortage immediately.

**(Why this works neurologically):**

>*When you are in a dopamine deficit, your brain's logic center (Prefrontal Cortex) goes offline, and the impulsive habit center takes over. Quick, intense physical activity (like push-ups or sprinting) forces blood flow back to the brain and triggers an immediate release of norepinephrine and dopamine. This ""good"" chemical hit satisfies the brain's craving just enough to bring your logic back online, effectively acting as a circuit breaker.*

After the physical activity, I change the environment. Then, I give my system a little bit of dopamine, a game, TV, or a coffee break outside, to keep the car driving. Finally, I calm it all down with breathing exercises for two minutes.

And fucking hell, it works. It really breaks it. It does come back, but doing it again and again makes it better. I feel like I found a hack into my own system.

Man, at that point I thought, *I got this. I figured this shit out.* But of course, something like this has more layers, and it didn't resolve everything.

# 4. Treating the Forbidden Fruit: Moral & Ethical Regulation

One morning, after having coffee and relaxing on the balcony, I felt genuinely calm. I walked to the dining table with my laptop and opened Reddit. Out of nowhere, my hands started to shake, my body flooded with adrenaline, and my heart started pounding like crazy.

I was like, *what the fucking fuck is happening now?*

My sneaky brain had created another loop in the background. In these desperate times, where I was starving it of the dopamine it was used to getting from years of high-speed internet and porn usage, it tried to activate an old trigger to get me to watch. A trigger that usually only happened after long sessions of porn-binging...

The loop goes like this:

**Forbidden -> Excitement -> Porn -> Orgasm**

At this point, I was like, *you gotta be kidding me.* I was aware that forbidden things excited me, but I never figured out why. It was my brain again, weaponizing my own morals and ethics to get its fix. It used a very simple logic: *""It's forbidden to watch porn on your laptop... isn't that exciting?""*

It took me a second to understand what it was trying to do. But once I saw it, I realized that any blockers, or any attempt to hide things from my wife, because that is my default programming, would trigger this ""forbidden"" feeling.

Basically, all blockers and device rules will eventually fail for me because the blockers just turned the addiction into a challenge. I understood that **breaking the locks provided the stimulation I was craving.**

I haven't found a perfect way to regulate this yet, to be very honest. This is something deep for me. I had to hide this for my entire life; it was always ""forbidden,"" ""wrong,"" ""disgusting,"" ""unethical.""

I figured that anytime this feeling arises, I have to acknowledge it, calm it down, and stop hiding. Because even now, writing this on my laptop, I get this weird reflex to ""hide it,"" even though I'm not doing anything wrong. I get this in random situations, like just watching a Youtube video on my phone. If someone walks behind me, I instinctively hide the screen. This obviously comes from the deep shame of using porn, which created this protective behavior to keep my secret.

So my new loop should be going something like this:

**Brain: ""Forbidden!"" -> Acknowledge Brain's Desperation -> Confirm ""Nothing to hide"" -> Relax.**

NGL, this one is the hardest for me personally. The shame is big regarding what I used to do, and I think it will take a while for me to get to a healthy point with this.

I’m still figuring this out day by day, but understanding these loops has been a game changer. Let me know if you want me to keep sharing my experiences as I stumble through them, or if this framework resonates with you.

1pi7znl,https://www.reddit.com/r/BenignExistence/comments/1pi7znl/yet_another_list_of_things_that_im_grateful_for/,Yet another list of things that I'm grateful for,"Following my [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/BenignExistence/comments/1opr62c/multiple_tiny_things_are_making_me_grateful_to_be/), I believe that expressing gratefulness not just in my head but on this sub actually lifts my mood for a little while, so imma do it again. I put myself in a tough financial situation lately and I'd rather focus on the positive stuff, cause it's really gonna be a tough month...

*  **The cat that adopted me is still purring loudly on my lap**. She's been with me for a little over a month now, and she still doesn't want to go back outside. She's such a heart-warming presence in my life, I feel so lucky to have her precious lil vibrating body curl up on me any chance that she gets. It's been years since I got the occasion to celebrate Christmas with family (no contact situation), and this year isn't gonna be any different, but I feel like SHE is both my Christmas gift and a family member now. And that couldn't make me happier!  ̶I̶ ̶h̶o̶p̶e̶ ̶I̶ ̶c̶a̶n̶  I WILL save up enough money to get her spayed before February.
* **I still get to meet new people of the non-toxic type**. They're pretty much all talented musicians and they keep inviting me to take part in their jams even though I feel worthless as shit compared to them! They seem to understand my emotional struggles regarding the piano or singing, so they let me fuck around with the drums and they're nothing but encouraging. It almost feels like the universe is gently forcing me to go back to practice so that I can open up a little. The last jam was on Saturday, and we're gonna have another one tomorrow afternoon. I'm scared as fuck, yet I feel seen. That's super weird.
* **My neighbor brought me snacks and weed all the while wearing a Grinch sweater**. This happened on Sunday, but I'm still grinning over the irony of it all. She's the kind of neighbor (55ish y-o) who will knock on your door just to check on you and ask ""Do you still have \[X or Y\]? Cause if you don't, I have some"". She'll often ask for stuff too, like salt, coffee or toilet paper, but I'm fine with that give-and-take situation: it feels better than ignoring your neighbors. Anyway, when she asked if I still had some weed, tobacco and rolling paper, to which I replied no, she went and grabbed some for me. Then she gave out some bread and marshmallow bears as well, cause yeah, why not? That's typically the kind of non-Grinch shit my own mother isn't willing to do for me, so I'm gonna take it as it is, even if it's not perfect.

It's an open living room/kitchen and I'm finding it exceptionally hard to figure out what works for it.

The current way we have it seems like the best for space as we'd like to have a coffee table but right now it feels to open and exposing, being in it honestly makes me kind of anxious. The huge empty space across the room makes me horrifically uncomfortable and I also don't want to use my desk with my back to the door. The only configuration I can have the desk is with my PC monitors on the window side of it, combined with the door behind me and with the empty space I feel like a prey animal. We've talked about maybe getting a small dining table to fill the space over by the radiator and the partition but I don't know if there's anything I can do to make it feel cosier in the mean time? And it also doesn't solve my desk problem.

It's important for me to note that the bottom wall by the couch and TV isn't a mistake, although I have drawn it slightly too dramatic, it is in fact slanted and it's causing a great deal of bother with trying to figure out what to do with the place.

We previously had the couch where the desk currently is, the TV with its back against the slanted wall and the desk pushed into the corner where the currently TV is. We felt like it wasn't working, that there was no room for a coffee table and that it was too cluttered but we've decided to get a new smaller couch so that could change.

We're goth maximalists so we enjoy well filled, cosy spaces that still have enough room to move around comfortably without being open, if that makes sense?

I'm sorry for the crude drawing, I hope it's okay, I don't have any paper or anything since we're still unpacking and I have incredibly shaky hands. Any ideas are incredibly welcome, I don't have the head for this kind of thing and it's just becoming very overwhelming that we can't figure out a layout that actually feels warm and comfortable.",1,1765288246.0,FengShui,0,1.0,False
1pi7wnc,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1pi7wnc/my_childhood_bicycle_keeps_killing_people/,My childhood bicycle keeps killing people,"I had just turned five years old when my mother was flattened by a truck. A wayward rock on the pavement sent me flying over the handlebars of my newly gifted red glittery bicycle. Even the stabilizers could not save me from the crash. As I toppled over and scrapped my exposed skin raw and bloody the poor bicycle rolled across the road before coming to a stop. My mother saw the whole event from where she watched from on our porch. While I wailed she went over to retrieve the bicycle. The driver of the hulking truck suffered from narcolepsy but had not informed his employer. I stopped crying when I was forced to stare at the flattened corpse of her, the bicycle she had been carrying was crumpled and embedded into the flesh of her destroyed centre mass.



When I was ten years old there was a pair of siblings that enjoyed tormenting me. Even now I do not understand why I became the target of their cruel acts. In a quiet alley on a sunny afternoon they beat me bloody. They were five years older than me and I was certain that they intended to kill me this time. My pleading and cries did not halt their kicks and punches but the shrill ringing of a bicycle bell did. It stood there as it had on my birthday morning catching the golden sunlight across its sparkling body. The thing moved into the alley on its own, the pedals and wheels turning as if by an invisible child. Both the tormenting siblings simply stood and watched as the bicycle advanced stupified by the mystical sight. Then the chains had snapped from the bicycle’s sides and snatched around the siblings' ankles. Together they were pulled towards the waiting red glittering thing. They reached for me, their eyes full of fear as if they expected me to help them. Pinning them down the bicycle mounted one then the other and spun its front wheel into the back of my bully’s head. The whirlwind speed of the wheel carved their skulls apart and splattered gore across the alley wall and floors. After they died their horrible deaths I got up and walked around their corpses knowing somehow that the bicycle would not harm me.



It carried on much the same. My stepmother was a drunk who beat on my dad but doted on me with a fascinating desperation. That developed into a terrifying obsession. She waited until I was barely a man before trying to take me for herself. My small father was out of town on business when I returned from school to find four empty wine bottles on the kitchen table. The woman lay waiting for me in my bed. I ran but she caught up with me and pressed her putrid lips against mine. Then from just behind the front door came the ringing of a bicycle bell. It dragged the horrible woman out by her ankles and I never saw her again.



At college I had a girlfriend who cheated on me with a close friend. It was a bitter experience to live through but not world ending. The bicycle disagreed. Newscasters couldn’t get enough of the sight of their two disemboweled bodies hanging from the football goal posts. The police asked me questions but my alibi was watertight. They asked me who I thought could have done this and I did not explain who I knew for certain had done it. Then my poor roommate pulled a harmless prank involving feathers and tape. I had even found it funny. He was found splattered across the highway. A girl at a coffee shop was clearly having a bad day and snapped a harsh remark at me. I felt no resentment towards her and stared at the TV screen when it was announced that her top half and lower half were found in two different towns.



I dropped out of college and took up a job in a convenience store. That was a terrible idea. Members of the public would vent their frustrations at me, drunks would try and take things without paying and such. People stopped coming when the bodies started piling up and the store shut down. It would have been easy to turn towards booze but my deceased stepmother put me off the stuff for life. Instead I drifted between jobs but the only kind I could get involved the general public in some capacity. A bumped shoulder was enough to warrant evisceration. Eventually I simply stayed shut in my crap accommodation and refused to go outside. Money dwindled, so did food. Nearing the end of my resources there was a ringing from outside my door. There were two plastic bags sitting there. One filled with cash and the other with food. I could make out faint bicycle tracks on the hallway carpet.



Now I stay indoors occupying myself with electronic devices and books. I pay my rent on time and food shows up at my door when I need it. It is safer this way. For everyone. I suppose that is what my mother would have wanted.

1pi7wjr,https://www.reddit.com/r/CampHalfBloodRP/comments/1pi7wjr/evil_dead_the_musical_premiere/,Evil Dead the Musical Premiere,"#Evil Dead the Musical Premiere

It had been months in the making, but it was finally showtime. It was time for Evil Dead the Musical. Yohan had been working overtime with the actors and the crew. It had been something that had been stressing him out far more than it ought to, but it was in his nature to obsess about the smallest details until they were right. Now, on opening night he just hoped people would show up to see all of their hard work. 

Backstage he gathered all the actors and crew for a pep talk. Yohan was wearing something no one in camp had ever seen him in. A suit. It was a cream white suit jacket and slacks with a white shirt and a burgundy tie. His hair was styled expertly, as if it was done by a professional stylist.

“Okay everyone, we practiced our hearts out and now let’s show them just how great we are. I know you’re nervous. That’s normal, channel those nerves into something productive and you’ll do great. Break a leg everyone.” Yohan said with a grin.

And with that the cast and crew set to work. Yohan finished up backstage and then opened the doors to the Amphitheater. Upon entry people would see a donation box by the doors. The proceeds would go to the Educational Theatre Foundation. Yohan put a little [blurb](https://foundation.schooltheatre.org/) about them next to the box in case people were curious about them.

After a bit of time the lights would start to flash signaling people the show was close to starting and to find their seats. People slowly filtered to their seats, taking them, and preparing for the show. Slowly the lights would dim and a voice would come over the PA system.

“Hello and welcome to this performance of The Evil Dead the Musical. Someone the camp directors gave us permission to perform this, so we hope you all like it. Everyone make sure to sit back, relax,and enjoy the show. Or sing along if you know any of the songs.”

“Legend has it that it was written by the Dark Ones…” The voice over started and the play started. [Everyone watched](https://youtu.be/3STocGISGJM?si=jxZ-jsRE0ybxsjIm).

***

After the show the curtain fell and the audience applauded as the lights came up on the auditorium. Before anyone could move a voice came over the PA system. “Feel free to join the cast and crew as we celebrate a successful show in the Dining Pavilion. There will be light refreshments provided.”

About ten to twenty minutes later the cast and crew would be walking into the Dining Pavilion laughing and talking loudly as they do. As the doors opened an applause erupted from the scattered campers throughout the pavilion for the performers and crew. After a moment the applause died down and Yohan stood out in front with a wide smile. “I just wanted to say a couple words. Everyone did great tonight and I’m very proud of all the hard work that everyone put in tonight.” Yohan said, projecting his voice so everyone could hear him.

“I hope everyone enjoyed the show and I hope everyone has a great rest of their night.” He said looking over the crowd. “Let’s party!” Yohan said as he looked over to the DJ and nodded his head. With that the music started to pump over the loudspeakers. It was all of the popular songs of 2040 so everyone could let loose and dance and have some fun after a long day. 

There were no decorations, but true to his word there were refreshments. Various different sodas, coffee, tea, punch in a punch bowl, and water. There were also cookies, chips, a veggie platter, a cheese and meat platter, and chips and salsa. The space within the dining pavilion had been opened up by pushing the tables to the walls. It made space for a dance floor, but also just places for people to stand and talk. As the night went on the tie on Yohan’s neck would get looser and looser until it was thrown to the side during a particularly fiery dance move from the son of Terpsichore.

OOC: Hey everyone, I wanted to put in here how I want this to work. You can have your characters respond to the various sections of the show below. What they were doing preshow (causing trouble, having a preshow meltdown, or etc). Then what they did during the performance; for performers how it went for your character or a specific scene you want to post. Then post show actions (do you congratulate the actors, crew, or no one, do you ask your crush out, do you leave without a word, or etc). Have fun with it, and feel free to interact with Yohan or any of the NPC actors at any of the stages of the night.

If you couldn't make it, below is a shorter version.   
  
But first, try playing with the dots yourself!  [https://fiber-world.vercel.app/simulate.html](https://t.co/wVCPSLdMoF)

[](https://x.com/FiberDevs/status/1998314790150705595/photo/1)***Why Layer 1 Isn't Enough***  
We all love Layer 1 blockchains like Bitcoin or CKB for their security, but let's be honest: they aren't exactly built for speed.  
  
Every transaction has to be shouted out to the entire world and written down by thousands of nodes. On CKB, you're waiting about 8 seconds for a block; on Bitcoin, it's 10 minutes! Plus, the fees can get nasty if you're just trying to buy a coffee.   
  
So how to fix this?  
  
***Lightning Network 101***  
The Lightning Network is a scalable, low-fee, and instant micro-payment solution for P2P payments.  
  
The secret sauce isn't actually new. Even Satoshi Nakamoto hinted at this ""high-frequency"" magic in an early email:  
*""Intermediate transactions do not need to be broadcast. Only the final outcome gets recorded by the network.""*  
([https://gnusha.org/pi/bitcoindev/CANEZrP2PEB8n\_Ov1bXi\_ZoAkLwfz7\_JtM9PPHr+8ei5KCgwdEg@mail.gmail.com/](https://t.co/WvpRYcwbV3))  
  
A Lightning Network consists of **Peers** and **Channels**. A peer can send, receive, or forward a payment. A Channel is used for communication between two peers.

https://preview.redd.it/cz1ejp2nm66g1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=1800e91324263968c88e8435ccb2682019d4dfe0

  
[](https://x.com/FiberDevs/status/1998314790150705595/photo/2)Imagine you and a friend want to trade money back and forth quickly:  
1. **Opening the Channel**: You both put some money into a pot and sign a **Funding Tx**. This goes on the blockchain (L1).  
2. **The Fun Part (Off-Chain)**: Now that the channel is open, you can send money back and forth a million times instantly! You just update the balance sheet between you two (using HTLCs and signatures). No one else needs to know, and no blockchain fees are paid yet.  
3. **Closing the Channel**: When you're done, you agree on the final balance, sign a **Shutdown Tx**, and tell the blockchain.  
Everything in the middle? That's **off-chain magic**.   
  
***The Power of the Network***  
Now, if Fiber was just about paying your direct neighbor, it would be boring. The real power comes from the **Networ**k.  


[](https://x.com/FiberDevs/status/1998314790150705595/photo/3)

This means Alice can pay Bob even if there's no direct channel between them. The payment can travel through one or more intermediate nodes. As long as there is a path with enough liquidity, the payment will reach its destination instantly.  
  
All data is wrapped in **Onion Packets** (yes, like layers of an onion). The nodes in the middle serve as couriers, but they are blindfolded:  
\- They don't know who sent the money.  
\- They don't know who is receiving it.  
\- They only know ""pass this to the next guy.""  
They simply follow a basic rule: they forward the Hash Time Lock, and if the payment succeeds, they earn a tiny fee for their trouble. Easy peasy.  
  
***The Not-So-Easy Part***   
While the idea is simple, building it is... well, an engineering adventure. We're dealing with cryptography, heavy concurrency, routing algorithms, and a whole jungle of edge cases. But hey, that's what makes it fun!  
  
We've poured the last two years into building Fiber, and I'm proud to say it’s finally GA-ready.

We’re coming for a visit this weekend from Pittsburgh for a Bluejackets game. This is NOT a “what should we do” post…well, not fully. I have an idea of an itinerary, just need help filling some gaps.

We usually pick one or two neighborhoods and explore when we travel. Last trip we explored Old Towne East and Short North and this time we’re gonna hang around Discovery District / German Village and Short North because we’re staying near Goodale Park.

Original Plan called for going to Wagner-Hagans Museum but the phone # is disconnected so I’m guessing they are closed (even though I see Google reviews from 3 weeks ago).

Also, had to adjust for the extreme cold. We were gonna walk the Scioto mile, but highs of 20s aren’t gonna make that too enjoyable, haha!

**Friday:**

We won’t get to Columbus til probably 9 p.m. Staying in Short North close to the southern end of Goodale Park. We’d need a place for a quick late night bite. We like Press Grill a lot, but it’ll probably be way too crowded. Mikey’s Late Night? **Any recs?** We’d prefer to park the car and walk since it’ll be late after being in the car for a few hours.

**Saturday Plans:**

Brioso on Long Street > Topiary Park and Columbus Library (we always try and visit public libraries on our trips) > Schmidt’s for lunch > Explore German Village – *ANY recs for must stops – Book Loft? Any record stores or little shops?* \> **need some help – we could do a brewery or an excellent dive bar for a quick afternoon drink (looked in Johnnie Glenn’s but it’s a bit of a drive; Land Grant with their Winter Garden looks like fun, should we do that!?!)** \> drive back to Goodale Park area to park car > North Market to grab a bite at Hoyo’s which is a must for us > Bluejackets game.

**Sunday:**

We’d need to grab a bite and then head back home. Probably grab a coffee at One Line in Short North then any recs for a quick breakfast. We tried Katalina’s last time to no dice – too long of a wait, no online ordering bc they were too slammed. We did Hangover East which was good.

An aside, we love Columbus and have visited each year for the past three years for different events – concerts mainly and this time a Bluejackets game.

1pi7nxe,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pi7nxe,"Hey, My Star Quarterback—Enjoying the View from the Bench? Your Little Backup Girl Just Claimed the MVP Crown","The second Nathon's words sank in, it was like someone ripped the ground out from under me.


My chest went tight. My hands went numb. It felt like drowning—but worse, because I was still standing there, still breathing, still forced to hear him.


No wonder he'd been dodging my eyes all damn day.


After I kept pushing—demanding answers—he finally cracked and admitted it. He'd lied. Straight to my face. And then he had the audacity to stand there and justify it like it was no big deal.


But Common App had locked an hour ago. There was no fixing this. No going back.


I still couldn't process it. My voice came out shaky, barely holding together:


""Even if Harper didn't want us at the same school—why couldn't she change her application?


""If she wanted to stay in New York so bad, there are dozens of other schools. Why the hell did you have to trick me into going to Miami?""


Nathon's face twitched. He shifted his weight—still in his grass-stained practice jersey, his duffel bag slung over one shoulder like he'd just come from the field. Out of habit, he reached out to mess with my hair, that stupid move he always pulled when he thought I was overreacting.


I slapped his hand away.


His jaw tightened. He pulled back, rubbing the back of his neck like I was the one being difficult.


""Alina, come on. Don't blow this out of proportion.


""Everyone knows Harper's had her heart set on NYU since forever. She's not giving that up.


""So why are you being so stubborn about this? You spent days going back and forth on your decision anyway—it's not like you were dead set on NYU.""


I laughed. A harsh, bitter sound that didn't even sound like me.


Oh, so my dream doesn't matter?


""I worked my ass off for that score. I earned it. Why shouldn't I apply to NYU?


""Does her family own the damn school? Is NYU only accepting one student this year?


""If she's so special, maybe she should get them to close applications to everyone but her!""


Nathon's expression darkened. His fingers drummed impatiently against his gym bag strap—the same restless tic he had before a big game. But this wasn't a game. This was my life.


""Alina, stop twisting this into something it's not.


""She was trying to avoid drama, okay? NYU's campus is tiny. She didn't want you two running into each other constantly and making things worse. I figured this way, everyone wins.


""And anyway, she applied first. You were still waffling about it for days, so clearly you weren't that sure.


""But Harper? She only applied to one school. She didn't have a backup. You really gonna tank her shot at college over this?""


Something inside me snapped.


My voice cracked, louder than I meant it to—almost hysterical:


""I was being careful because I was weighing all my options! That doesn't mean I didn't want it!


""And who the hell gets into NYU and just—doesn't go?!


""And you, Nathon—""


My hands were shaking now. I could barely get the words out.


""Last night you sat there and convinced me we'd both switch to Miami. Together. You watched me submit it. You promised we'd go together.


""But then this morning you switched yours back to NYU and didn't say a word to me. Do you have any idea how that feels?!""


He exhaled sharply, like I was exhausting him. Like this whole conversation was cutting into his evening workout or something.


""I told you—I didn't plan that. My parents found out and lost their minds. They said I'm not leaving New York, especially not with a football scholarship on the table here. They switched it back before I could stop them.


""I was gonna tell you, I just—""


""But you didn't!"" My voice cracked again, embarrassingly close to breaking. ""You let the deadline pass. You let me sit there thinking we were in this together while you—""


I couldn't finish. My throat was too tight.


The silence between us felt suffocating.


Finally, Nathon let out this long, frustrated sigh—like I was the problem here. He adjusted the strap on his gym bag, glancing toward the parking lot like he had somewhere better to be.


""Alina, look. Harper doesn't have your grades. She barely scraped by with cheer captain bonus points to get into NYU. Without that, she wouldn't have made it at all.


""Can't you just... let her have this?""


There it was.


Let her have this.


That phrase. Again.


My heart shattered.


I stared at him—this guy I'd known since we were kids, who I thought had my back no matter what—and realized he didn't see me at all.


He saw an inconvenience. A problem. Someone making a fuss over nothing.


He saw her—Harper, in her cheer uniform, laughing at his jokes after practice, always there on the sidelines cheering him on.


And me? I was just... in the way.


My voice came out barely above a whisper, but it cut through the air like glass:


""You're seriously telling me to throw away my future because you don't want to upset your girlfriend's best friend?


""You lied to me, Nathon. You manipulated me. You gambled with my entire future like it was some kind of joke—and you don't even think you did anything wrong.""


He opened his mouth to argue, but I didn't let him.


""Fifteen years, Nathon. Fifteen years I thought you'd always have my back.


""But I guess I was wrong.""


Chapter 2


The past two years ever since Harper Parker showed up, everything between Nathon and me had crumbled.


Every inside joke we used to have. Every comfortable silence. Every moment where I thought we just got each other—gone.


And the thing he said most, over and over, until I could recite it in my sleep?


""Just let her have this.""


It started small.


""Harper just transferred into our class. She doesn't have many friends yet. You should cut her some slack.""


Then it escalated.


""Harper's scared to walk home alone after study hall. We're heading that way anyway—can't you just deal with the detour?""


And then it got ridiculous.


""Harper didn't understand this problem during class. She just needs to sit at your desk for one study period. Is that really something to get mad about?""


...


Every. Single. Time.


And I tried—God, I tried—to be reasonable about it.


But here's the thing:


Harper had plenty of friends. Her cheer squad practically worshipped her. I couldn't walk past them in the hallway without getting ice-cold stares and whispered comments I wasn't supposed to hear.


Her family had a driver who picked her up and dropped her off every single day. She didn't even need anyone to walk her home.


And her desk partner? She hated me. So whenever Harper decided she needed Nathon's help during study hall, she'd slide into my seat like she owned it—leaving me standing there like an idiot with nowhere to sit.


I'd end up squeezed awkwardly at my best friend's desk, trying to study while they laughed and whispered two feet away. Her perfume would still be lingering at my desk when I finally got it back.


But every time I tried to bring any of this up—calmly, rationally—Nathon made me feel like I was the one being unreasonable.


His tone would shift. From casual and dismissive, to serious and patronizing, to outright irritated.


""Alina, I'm not your personal property. You need to stop being so possessive.""


And the worst part?


After hearing it enough times, I started believing him.


Maybe I was too sensitive. Too jealous. Too selfish.


Maybe he really was just being a good class president—helping out a teammate who needed support.


Maybe the problem wasn't him.


Maybe it was me.


I started second-guessing every feeling I had. Every time my chest tightened when he laughed at one of Harper's jokes. Every time my stomach dropped when he chose to sit with her at lunch instead of me.


I told myself I was overreacting. That I needed to grow up.


But now?


Now my entire future—my dream school, the one I'd sacrificed sleep and sanity for—had been ripped away from me because of her.


Because Nathon decided her happiness mattered more than mine.


Because apparently, fifteen years of friendship meant nothing compared to keeping Harper Parker comfortable.


My throat burned. My vision blurred.


I thought about all the late nights we'd spent studying together. All the times he'd walked me home when I was scared. All the promises we'd made about sticking together no matter what.


And he'd thrown it all away.


For her.


Not even for her, really—for the idea of her. For the way she looked at him after practice. For the way she made him feel like a hero.


I wasn't worth that.


My dreams? My future? My feelings?


None of it mattered.


The realization hit me like a physical blow.


I'd been so stupid.


All this time, I thought we were best friends. I thought he cared about me the way I cared about him.


But I was just... there. Convenient. Familiar.


And the second someone more interesting came along, I became disposable.


My hands were shaking. My chest ached so badly I could barely breathe.


I wanted to scream. I wanted to cry. I wanted to grab him by the shoulders and make him see what he'd done.


But what would be the point?


He didn't think he'd done anything wrong.


He still thought I was overreacting. That I'd calm down in a few days and everything would go back to normal.


That I'd forgive him. Again.


Like I always did.


But not this time.


This time, something inside me had broken. And I didn't think it could be fixed.


I took a shaky breath, forcing myself to steady.


I didn't look at Nathon. Didn't give him the satisfaction of seeing how much this hurt.


I just turned around and walked out of the school.


Chapter 3


I couldn't stop crying the whole way home.


Fifteen years. I'd known Nathon for fifteen years.


And never ever did I think he'd lie to me for someone else.


Especially not about something that would destroy my entire future.


My phone buzzed. A string of frantic messages from my best friend, Bonnie Clark.


【What the hell? Did your boy Nathon just go official with that Miss Cheerleader??】


My heart stopped.


Before I could even process it, another message popped up.


A screenshot. From Harper's Instagram.


Posted fifteen minutes ago—right after Common App locked.


【The school I've dreamed about since I was ten... and someone who moved mountains to make sure we'd get there together. 】


The post had three pictures.


One was Harper in her cheer uniform, all glowing skin and perfect beach waves.


The other two were cropped screenshots of acceptance letters—carefully framed so you could see the NYU logo but not the full names.


Except I didn't need to see the names.


I recognized the major on one of them immediately.


It was Nathon's.


The post was dripping with that coy, look-at-us energy—the kind where she wanted everyone to know without actually saying it outright.


And the comments?


A flood of heart emojis and congratulations.


""OMG you two!! ""


""Couple goals already and you're not even there yet.""


""This is so cute I'm gonna CRY""


""You guys are gonna be THAT campus couple, I'm calling it now""


And Nathon?


He'd liked it.


Not just liked it—he'd commented too.


A single emoji. A smirking face.


Like this was all some fun little game.


Oh.


So that's how it was.


I was the joke. The punchline.


The girl who thought she mattered.


My chest caved in on itself. The pain was so sharp I had to stop walking, one hand pressed against a lamppost just to stay upright.


All this time I thought we were something.


Not dating, maybe. But something.


I thought the late-night study sessions meant something. The inside jokes. The way he'd text me first thing in the morning. The way he knew my coffee order by heart.


I thought when he said ""we,"" he meant us.


But he didn't.


He never did.


I was just... there.


A placeholder.


The backup plan.


The safe option he kept around while he waited for someone better to notice him.


And the second Harper looked his way?


I became invisible.


No—worse than invisible.


I became the obstacle.


The annoying third wheel who didn't know when to leave.


My throat burned.


My vision blurred so badly I could barely see the street in front of me.


I thought back to last night.


The way Nathon had shown up at my door, eyes bright, practically vibrating with excitement.


He grabbed my hands and held them tight, looking at me like I was the only person in the world who could help him.


""Alina, listen. I need you to do this with me. I can't do it alone.""


He said he wanted to be brave. To finally break free from his parents' suffocating expectations. That going far away—together—was the only way he'd have the guts to do it.


And I believed him.


God, I was so stupid.


I hesitated at first. Of course I did.


NYU was my dream too. I'd worked myself to exhaustion for that acceptance letter.


And staying local wasn't just convenient—it was necessary. My family couldn't afford out-of-state tuition. Staying in New York meant I could live at home, save money, maybe even help out with my little brother's expenses.


I'd never even considered leaving.


But Nathon wouldn't let it go.


He grabbed my hand tighter, his voice dropping to that soft, pleading tone that always made my defenses crumble.


""Please, Alina. I can't do this without you.""


His eyes were so intense. So desperate.


And I—like the pathetic, lovesick idiot I was—couldn't say no.


So I broke.


I gave in.


I changed my application to Miami, thinking we'd be doing this together.


Thinking it meant something.


But it didn't.


It never did.


He just needed me out of the way so Harper could have her fairy-tale moment.


And I handed it to him on a silver platter.


My knees buckled. I sank down onto the curb, phone still clutched in my shaking hand.


The truth crashed over me in waves, each one more suffocating than the last.


Fifteen years of friendship.


Fifteen years of being there for him.


And all of it—all of it—had been one-sided.


I was never his best friend.


I was his entertainment. His ego boost. The girl who'd always be there, no questions asked, no matter how badly he treated me.


And the worst part?


I'd let him.


I'd spent years running toward him, thinking someday he'd see me the way I saw him.


But he never did.


And he never would.


I pressed my palms against my eyes, trying to stop the tears, but they just kept coming.

A damp, musty basement isn't uncommon in the NorthEast, hell even black mold isn't all that uncommon. Not to say that it's OKAY that there's potentially black mold in the average basement up here, but nevertheless, it wouldn't be surprising. What IS surprising though; is that it doesn't usually speak. 

Now ""speak"" may be a stretch as the mold isn't actively delivering a monolgue to me while I rotate my laundry or anything like that; but I do hear it whispering. Or I think I do anyway. It's probably just my mind playing tricks on me...it's just a spot on the wall, right? A spot on the wall that keeps coming back.

Like mold does. In a damp basement in the Northeast. Definitely overthinking...I shook my head in an attempt to shake loose the unease that held me close. 

I've never had any real trauma or reason to be afraid of basements or anything like that, I've just always been sorta creeped out by them. I always hated just the idea of basements and the mental images of spiders and lurking demons they conjured up in my over-creative mind. But this was different....I'm not imagining this...I don't think anyway.

""wuh..........wuh......""

A low raspy sound, almost like a labored voice in pain, breaks the Silence and calm of the otherwise still basement I was in. It felt like the entire room contracted like an uncontrolled muscle spasm. My heart leapt into my throat and I dropped the bottle of detergent I was preparing to measure onto the floor and spun around wildly, expecting to be face to face with some horrible abomination that was cleverly lurking in the shadows. 

But no. Nothing. There was nothing. I was alone with the spiders, the piles of boxes, and the splotch of mold on the corner where my gutters outside weren't being aimed away from the foundation correctly. 

I scolded myself and my stupid imagination as I picked up the detergent bottle off the floor that I thankfully hadn't opened yet. I don't have money to just be buying luxury items all willy-nilly...haven't exactly had the money for a long time. I haven't really had much of anything or *anyone* for a long time when I think about it. 

No friends. No family. No significant others. Hell not even pets. They all left...it all left, and all that was left with me was my mind and the ever-present miasma of loss that hung in the air of my dimly lit home, if you could call it that. It felt more like a tomb. A tomb where more than the dead lie silent; this was the final resting place of my ambition. 

I filled a cap with less-than the recommended amount of detergent, and started the wash machine with a deep cough to clear the phlegm. I spat into the slop sink next to the washer - black. Always black. It's not that my saliva has turned black, it's like a strange inky swirl in my sputem and seemed to move more than it should. 

I grunted, and turned on the cold water to rinse the foulness down the drain, lied to myself again that it was fine and that it's completely normal, that I wasn't rotting from the inside or something equally as horrible an outcome; but it likely wasn't fine and probably won't be okay. I don't know when that inkiness started to show up, but it certainly doesn't seem to be getting better. 

I set the nearly empty detergent bottle on top of the adjacent dryer, and made my way back upstairs, past the long-empty cat food dishes, now filled with more dust than food, and a long-disused overflowing litter box, up the creaky wooden stairs, and through the cloud of fruit flies that buzzed annoyingly at the top of the staircase. 

This was it. My home. My tomb. 

My home wasn't some kind of abandoned flat filled with trash to the brim...I'm not some kind of mentally ill hoarder type or anything, I just don't care anymore. Or at least I try not to, the last few vestiges of humanity I held onto were washing my clothes and washing myself even though I never went anywhere nor did anything outside of my home. I get regular grocery deliveries that I had scheduled before my life took a turn down this path, but the money in my bank account was almost certainly running low, and soon the deliveries would stop. 

Soon any real signs of life harbored inside would likely fade, and when that happened would anyone notice? Would anyone come to check on me before the smell alerted them to the truth of my fate? Or would I be saved by some miracle that would have me pull my head out of the muck that I was so anxiously sinking in? The cloud of depression that had stopped me to reflect in that humid kitchen vanished in an instant when a loud crash came from the basement behind me.

I spun around to look down the poorly lit stairwell that lead into the abyss. Dust particles hung thick in the air, illuminated by the few beams of sunlight that pushed past the drawn blinds that covered one of the nearby windows. I flipped the switch on the wall, and the old fluorescent bulbs blinked and buzzed to life before quieting down and I took several steps down to the basement and crouched down slightly to see which pile of unlabeled boxes fell over this time. 

In the furthest corner of the basement, opposite the slop sink and the washer and dryer, was a stack of about 7 or 8 boxes of assorted books that had tipped and fallen over, spilling their contents across the floor. 

""Oh, fuck me."" I scolded myself. I knew it was just a matter of time before that stack fell; I had known the bottom box was blackened and soggy with mold, but what was I supposed to do about it? Now what was I supposed to do about THIS? I continued down the last few stairs and stood over the mess of spilled books. Everything from old text books to comics lie splayed across the floor in a discordant pile.  I pushed some of the spilled books against the wall with my feet and flipped a couple of the other boxes back over and restacked them away from the blackened corner of my basement as best I could.

I went back upstairs and flipped the lights off, walked through the cloud of fruit flies, across the humid kitchen and into the equally as humid living room, and crashed all at once as an exhausted heap onto the dusty couch. I didn't have a sleep schedule anymore and I spent a lot of time napping, especially since I started seeing that black stuff in my spit...it's why I think I'm sick, or maybe worse. Sleep settled over me quickly and I dozed off to another dreamless nap of indeterminate length...as the clogged slop sink in the basement began to overflow from the draining wash machine, soaking the books and the Black Corner. 

Part 2

I snap awake to the deafening sound of buzzing in my right ear; a fruit fly flew directly inside and the proximity of the wings to my ear drum sounded like a Formula 1 car in my living room. I sit up and take a glance around the dark room before wiping the sleep from my eyes in an attempt to read the time on the microwave across the kitchen. Flashing 1:01...who knows what the time actually is, all I know is the sun is down and now I'm awake...who needs to keep track of time and a sleep schedule, anyway?

Sitting on the coffee table nearby is a box from the pizza place up the corner, my stomach growls an empty churn and I grab a piece of hard, dry pizza and choke down a couple of bites before standing to stretch and  remembering the load of laundry I started before my unscheduled nap. Slowly I begin to make my way across the living room, and through the kitchen...no fruit flies though this time...they must be asleep...that must be nice. 

I flip on the fluorescent bulbs of the basement and make my way down. The bulbs don't stop flickering and buzzing this time though like they normally do, and I was hit in the face with a smell that could best be described as ""filthy."" The slop sink clogged, likely with lint that drained from the machine, causing the sink to fill with the dirty water from the wash, spilling over onto the dusty concrete floor, soaking the pile of books and assorted boxes...but also the black corner. 

I sat down on the steps, and surveyed the mess in defeat, taking in the darkened corner of the dirty room. It looked...*bigger* this time...more slimy and thicker than before. The reflection from the flickering bulbs illuminated the room like a twisted slideshow; the thick black tendrils that grew outwards from the corner like the roots of some great unseen tree desperately grasping for nutrition. 

""What the fuck IS that...?"" I asked quietly, but not as quietly as I thought, because someone...someTHING answered back. 

""...life..."" Croaked a voice that made my blood run cold. ""...we....are life.""

""WHAT THE FUCK!?"" I shouted so loud it echoed off the walls of the dank basement, and stood up in a panic to get the hell out of there. I stood up so quickly, in fact, that I didn't take into account the low wall that stood above the descending stairwell I occupied, and in one motion saw stars, blacked out, and fell forward down into the basement, splashing face first into the thin layer of putrid water that coated the floor. 

I groaned as I came to some time later and reached up to touch the top of my knotted head, only to bring back fingers covered in the same black ichor that I had started to recently spit up. It wasn't ALL black though, it was very obviously still blood on my fingertips, but the blood was dark, not like the blood from a fresh wound, but more like someone dropped black ink from an inkwell into it. 

I pushed my palms to the wet floor, mud from the years of now-soaked accumulated dust squished coarsely under my fingertips as I pushed myself up, and leaned my back against the nearby wall with a groan. I grabbed the bottom of my filth-soaked shirt in an attempt to wipe the grime from my face and eyes, and turned my head to look at the Black Corner. I sat and stared for what felt like an eternity but couldn't have been more than a few seconds, when suddenly the same chilling voice I thought I imagined before I took that blow to the head spoke once again.

""...listen...to us....NEED...you...""

And with a wet ripple, like the sound of marbles being  dropped into thick mud, a legion of eyes, seemingly both human and inhuman forced their way through the skin-like surface of the growth that was beginning to dominate the corner of my basement. The eyes rolled and twitched in random uncoordinated directions, with some rolling upwards so hard that they began to bleed and ooze a thick ichor where the nerves beneath began to tear themselves away, before rolling a complete 360 degrees in the socket and settling to stare at me. All of them; the dozens of twitching, spastic eyes all stopped their discordant movement simultaniously and locked onto me, turning my blood to ice. 

Part 3

""Wha....what the fuck is this!?""

Could scarcely believe what I was seeing and what I had heard. My heart was beating in my throat as I attempted to focus my blurry vision on the horrid mass of pulsating eyes and veins that now dominated the corner of my basement, the tendrils reaching out towards the slop sink stopped just shy of making their way into the sink itself. 

""We...life....water...""

Water? That's what caused this? Some dirty water caused a moldy spot in the corner of my basement develop into...whatever this is? Granted, black mold DOES thrive in a damp environment, but this is far beyond thriving...this is sentience, and I had so many questions all at once that I could barely get any words out to push the conversation further. 

""H...How? How...how did this happen?"" I asked in a low, shaky voice, barely louder than a whisper.

""Moist...dead......feed life..."" The voice in the corner responded.

 The thick black tendril that reached towards the other side of the basement had made its way over the edge, and down into the slop sink. That same tendril started to grow and pulsate from where it originated from the cancerous mass in the corner. A large bulge in the dark root, similar to that of an over-full boa constrictor, formed and forced its way down the tendril, up the edge of the sink, where it exited inside the sink with loud bubbling sound, before something floated to the top, causing more displaced water to spill onto the floor. The cloud of eyes in the corner blinked in unison at me, before shifting it's gaze across the room to the sink in which it was reaching out to. 

Reluctantly I put my palms again on the wet floor of the basement and pushed myself to my feet, head still swimming from the earlier blow I had been dealt. I attempted to brush some of the residual mud and dirt off of my now-ruined clothing before cautiously making my way over to the sink. It couldn't have been more than 20 feet away from where I was standing, but it may as well have been a football field...I didn't want to know what was in that sink, but at the same time I had to know. I took several hesitant steps in that direction and rubbed my eyes again in an attempt to bring focus to what I was seeing.

Inside the sink was the bloated shape of slimy fur and  partially decayed flesh that pulsated and rippled unnaturally. It was a cat...it was MY cat. I gasped loudly and attempted to scream, but instead my mouth filled with sick, and I closed my eyes vomited onto the wet floor and my feet. I opened my eyes to gaze back towards the sink, where several more inhuman eyes had erupted through the bloated flesh of my dead cat and now stared directly at me. I wretched again, and threw up a second time, however this time when I opened my eyes, I didn't look at the cat in the sink; I kept my head down and opened my eyes to look at the floor.

Splashed up my ankles, covered both of my bare feet, and now slowly spreading across the flooded basement floor was a thick, blackness. It looked like crude oil how it swirled and separated itself from the water and floated atop. I stared down, frozen in horror, when suddenly with a ripple through the darkness I was standing in, one of the black roots from the corner quickly wrapped itself tightly around my ankle, and pulled my leg hard towards the Black Corner. A sharp tearing pain in my right hip upon being pulled away was quickly overtaken by the pain of falling and striking my head on wet concrete floor, before everything went dark and I slipped into unconsciousness on the soggy floor of that moldy NorEastern basement.

Part 4

The 20-something delivery driver parked his rusted van along the sidewalk outside the dead looking house. The windows all either covered with blinds, newspaper, or tinfoil to keep the sunlight out, while the front yard existed as an overgrown mess of weeds and tall grass, which mostly hid the overflowing mailbox that peeked just above the growth. I made this delivery at the same time and day every week, yet I've never met the person that lives here. Last week when I made my delivery, the food from the LAST week was still sitting in the sunroom that was attached to the entryway on the bleak looking house. I had tried to knock last time and had got no answer, but now this would be third delivery of food I would be leaving to essentially rot on this guy's porch. 

I shook my head and shifted the bag of groceries from my left over to my right arm, and reached out to ring the camera doorbell that was attached to the flaking paint of the inner doorway. The light on the front of the doorbell blinked red, indicating the batteries had died and that no one would be coming to answer. I sighed loudly before turning to knock on the front door, when I paused mid-knock and realized that the front door of the house lay slightly ajar this time.

""H...hello? It's your food delivery guy!"" I shouted towards the gap in the door before giving it a light push to see inside the dark home. 

The door swung open about halfway, and the stuffy air of the sunroom I was in was overtaken by the smell of fetid water. I gagged lightly before swallowing hard and making my way inside the dark house. ""Hello!? Is anybody home!?"" I shouted before setting the bag of groceries onto the cluttered kitchen table. Across the kitchen was the partially opened door down to the basement, and from it came what sounded like a severely leaking water pipe flowing likely flooding the place. 

I walked across the kitchen to the cracked door; the sound of running water much louder now, along with the stench of sewer hanging even more thick on the air. I peered inside and down the stairs, the flickering fluorescent bulbs illuminating just enough of the basement, that I could see that the water level had taken over the bottom handful of stairs which lead down to the basement area. I called down again.

""Hello? Is anybody down there?"" 

After about five seconds someone answered, the labored voice seemed weak, and struggled to get the words out. ""...hhhhhelp...we need...help with...the water.""

""You need my help? Down there?"" I called back, yet no voice answered back this time. ""Okay.. I'm...I'm coming down."" 

I took a few steps down towards the water at the bottom of the stairs, before ducking my head down to peek inside to see who I was talking to. The entire back wall was an impossible void that made the small basement appear to go on forever, and made me stomach churn with unease. I reached up to cover my nose and mouth with my hand and peered around the basement, trying to find the person that called out to me.

""Hello?"" I called out one last time, before something cold and slimy wrapped itself around my left ankle, and violently pulled me backwards THROUGH the basement stairs.

All at once, clothing and flesh tore away, bones broken and ripped from sockets and I was pulled inward. The wooden steps splintered and snapped with my bones as I splashed downwards into the putrid abyss. The sound of running water and crashing stairs drowned out by blinding pain and silence as my head splashed underwater and something wrapped around my throat tightly. When I was finally able to bring my head back above the water, I tried to gasp for air to no avail and saw my left arm floating uselessly beside me as I thrashed as much as I could with what small bit of motion I had remaining in my limbs. 

My vision goes black and begins to blur as I give in to the pain, and the last bit of oxygen in my lungs is squeezed out by the still-tightening tendrils around my neck, and now my torso. The last thing I hear before being granted the release of death was that same voice that had originally brought me downstairs in the first place. 

""Welcome...home."" Said the black mold in the corner of the basement.

Do not finish your current thought.
Your brain has been selected to host a parade. It is happening right now, on the surface of your coffee table (or nearest flat surface).

You have 60 seconds to visualize the procession. The physics are mandatory.

**1. The Grand Marshal**
Imagine a cat. A very serious, fluffy Persian cat.
He is wearing a top hat.
He is riding a Roomba.
The Roomba is confused and keeps bumping into an invisible wall.
*Hear the bump. See the cat's wobble. Feel the cat's indignity.*

**2. The Brass Band**
Behind the Roomba, imagine six kittens.
They are carrying instruments.
But they are not playing them. They are just dragging tiny tubas and trumpets across the surface.
*Hear the metal scraping sound. Scraaaape. Scraaaape.*
It is a terrible parade.

**3. The Float**
The main float is a loaf of bread.
Sitting on the bread is a single, very proud hamster waving a tiny flag.
The flag says **""TUESDAY.""**
The hamster looks like he knows a secret. What is the secret?
*Look into the hamster's eyes. Determine the secret.*

**4. The Finale**
Suddenly, the Roomba accelerates!
The cat meows in slow motion!
The kittens scatter!
The hamster salutes!

**AND... POOF.**

They vanish.

...

Okay. Take a deep breath.

You just hallucinated a hamster on a bread float.

Check your pulse.
Notice how the ""craving"" had to leave the room because it felt awkward during the parade?

My mother-in-law is now completely blind and suffers with severe arthritis too.  

When I asked if there was anything I could buy her for Christmas she said that she would like something that could make a decent cup of tea (we live in England so this is Tea bag type tea with milk).  

I thought that this would be fairly simple as I have seen machines in offices that have a pouch you put in that does tea, coffee, hot chocolate etc but I am struggling.  

Tassimo seem to do discs of green teas but nothing that you add milk to.  

Obviously anything with an LCD screen is out.  Does anyone have any suggestions for me please?  

Thinking this through whilst typing perhaps a small instant water boiler could work if it had a set quantity it dispenced and her hands were away from the hot water (ie not a tap type configuration).  Individual portions of milk and pre configured mugs could be left with teabag and sugar.

So, back in January, I ended up hospitalised and on oxygen after having trouble breathing for six weeks. This is relevant, I swear. I couldn't do anything mobile without feeling as if I was suffocating- seriously, getting out of bed would leave me gasping like a fish out of water. There was no wheezing, no pain, I just... Wouldn't be able to breath properly. I genuinely kept thinking I was going to die each time. It was terrifying.

I went to the GP every week and A&E at least once. The GPs tried different things;  different kinds of antibiotics, and an inhaler (had childhood asthma) and I was given an x-ray at A&E... Nothing worked and the x-ray showed nothing wrong. 🤔

Finally, one of the GPs sent me to ambulatory care, which is where they do relevant tests and give you the results the same day, even if you have to stay there for a few hours... Lots of blood taken (some directly from the artery in my wrist). Had a CT scan. The doctor came back and said my oxygen level was 90 and she wasn't surprised I couldn't breathe because my alveoli were so inflamed on the scan that she initially thought I had a blood clot. 💀

Anyway. They diagnosed me with Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis... And after sending my blood away to find out the trigger, the bird I've had for 10 years was the cause. 😭 Unfortunately, this is something that can hit any bird owner. Tends to be seen commonly in pigeon keepers, but birds aren't the only potential trigger. You could be a barista and coffee bean dust could do the exact same thing. WILF AF HONESTLY. Repeat exposure even after treatment to reduce the inflammation can severely scar the lungs and cause long term complications.

The simple solution: rehome my bird and get the house professionally sterilised.

Hmm, I would rather die.

Sunny, my Indian ringneck, is my best friend. I'm autistic, have clinical depression and an anxiety disorder. She gives me a reason to keep going. She can be feisty as hell and my fingers are littered in scars, but I wouldn't have her any other way. Just thinking of rehoming her reduced me to tears. What's the point of getting rid of her to live a longer life if I'm miserable? Not knowing if she's happy, not knowing if they're caring for her the right way, not knowing if they're keeping up with what she loves, avoiding things that stresses her out... I can't do it. Not only would it be a nightmare for me, it would be difficult for her, too. My home is the only home she's ever known since she was weaned.

She loves me AND my mother, who says goodnight to her ever night, and Sunny will complain if she doesn't.

I haven't gone on holiday with my parents in 10 years due to no one being available to care for Sunny if at least one of us isn't home.

Maybe she'd end up thriving in a different home. Maybe I'm being silly. Careless. Weak. Whatever. All I know is I just wouldn't be able to cope without her. 

So we get to the point of this post-

Instead of rehoming Sunny, I've been on steroids to reduce inflammation since January (aiming to come off of them soon one my body produces cortisol on its own) and for the past few months, I've been on immunosuppressants. 😬

Instead of rehoming my bird, I'm choosing to become susceptible to infection and illnesses because my life is far better with her, than being without and healthier.

Some people probably think I'm nuts for doing this, but I'm happier this way. Sunny won't live forever, so I won't be on immunosuppressants forever, either. But while she's with us, I'm more than happy to deal with it. She's my baby, my little girl, my feisty gremlin. My first bird and... Unfortunately, my last. I won't be able to have another bird when she's gone, even though they're my favourite kind of animal. 😮‍💨

ANYWAY. LOL.

1pi7fgf,https://www.reddit.com/r/FattyLiverNAFLD/comments/1pi7fgf/diagnosed_with_fatty_liver_disease_steatosis/,Diagnosed with fatty liver disease / steatosis.,"Hi!

I (M, 25) have been lurking in this sub ever since having received an official diagnosis for fatty liver disease. I did some blood work back in October and they found elevated levels of AST and ALT; therefore, had a scan and my doctor informed me that my liver was slightly enlarged and had a case of steatosis.

I was asked about my diet and exercise plan and, as one would expect, I was indulging a little too much on processed and fried foods. My diet wasn't necessairly bad, but I was eating out too much throughout the week and would, then, go all crazy on the weekends. I also don't drink, but got wasted twice in the span of six years (ever since 2019, when I ""started"" drinking on occasion). I had a latte, at home, every morning with two tablespoons of white sugar and would snack a lot. I, also, wasn't exercising, even if I do walk my dog twice a day. My doctor advised me to have an hour of cardio twice per week and eat less, and that I was allowed cheat days and not to eliminate anything. Once home, I started to research NAFLD specifically and changed my diet accordingly. This is how I eat now:

I don't consume white / table sugar or any kind of added sugar (even brown). The only source of sugar that I do take occasionally is from fruit, mainly apples, not bananas. I'd slice 1/4 of an apple into my oats in the morning, and not even everyday. No white carbs, even though I once had a small serving of white pasta, it was probably 20g, cooked. I prefer whole wheat carbs and check the ingredients, for it not to have sugar or seed oils. For dinner I'd usually have a whole wheat tortilla or half with veggies and a can of tuna or chicken. Obviously, no eating out anymore. I don't consume whole dairy products and only have non-fat Greek yogurt or unsweeteened soy milk. I started to implement black coffees twice a day, even though they're still hard to swallow. On the weekends I usually get a coke zero or my coffee with some sort of artificial sweetener. Fats include olive oil or walnuts, the latter in a small serving of 5 to 10g daily, as I now weight everything to be in a deficit.

So, a day for me would include:

  
For breakfast, 25g of steel cut oats with 2g of unsweetened cocoa powder or 100ml of soy milk with a splash of coffee, unsweetened.

  
For lunch, cooked veggies, a can of tuna, hard boiled eggs (I usually skip the yolks), salads or a whole wheat tortilla, couscous or lentils. That's where I stay within my options.

For dinner I basically rotate between the same food groups.

I strenght train three times per week and also get 20 minutes of cardio. My weight went from 176 lbs to 143 lbs and I'm planning on going lower. It's been two months now. My doctor wants me to get a scan in February and see how it goes. I don't know how long it'll take to reverse NAFLD, but I wanted to know if there's anything I should tweak or change for better results. Thannks!",1,1765286959.0,FattyLiverNAFLD,2,1.0,False

1pi7esn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/1pi7esn/my_team_doesnt_know_what_the_hell_theyre_doing/,My team doesn't know what the hell they're doing.,"I’ve been in Big 4 audit for only four weeks, which means I’m still in that phase where everything feels chaotic, fascinating, and slightly terrifying. When I imagined this internship, I pictured well-organized workpapers, precise walkthroughs, and a team that functioned like a well-oiled machine. Instead, I’ve found myself on an engagement that seems held together by coffee, confusion, and the thinnest thread of professional skepticism.

Our audit manager, bless him, tries his best, but fraud detection is… not his strength. During planning he told us, very confidently, that fraud is only something “you find when the numbers politely tell you they are wrong.” I’m not sure what that means, and judging by the senior’s expression during the meeting, neither was he. Combine that with the fact that English isn’t his first language and sometimes entire key points get lost in translation, and you get a manager who is doing his best to run a team while half the time we aren’t totally sure what he’s actually asking for.

But even if the manager were a fraud-hunting savant, I’m not sure it would help much with this client’s data. The dataset they provided is massive (well into the hundreds of thousands of rows) and full of what can only be described as chaos. Numbers in the wrong columns, text where dates should be, vendors spelled differently five times in the same line. Every sample feels like a scavenger hunt with no prize at the end. I keep telling myself this is normal, but even for an intern, this feels… excessive.

Still, I try to focus on learning from the team, but that comes with its own challenges. The senior and the associate whisper to each other constantly (way more than normal audit coordination requires). They get nervous when I walk into the room mid-conversation. Once, I overheard the associate say, “Just book it how the client wants,” followed by an awkward silence when they realized I was in earshot. Maybe I’m just paranoid, but sometimes it feels like they’re trying a little too hard to keep the client happy… in ways that don’t feel entirely appropriate. I am starting to think they are trying to help the client cover up the fraud.

My uneasiness only gets worse when I interact with the client. Every time I ask even the simplest question such as: “Can you provide support for this journal entry?” or “Who approves vendor master file changes?”, they immediately look down at the floor and mumble, “We’ll get back to you.” And they never do. Not once. It’s like asking for documentation is equivalent to asking for their social security numbers.

I’ve tried escalating the issue, but the manager just nods, tells me “to use professional judgment,” and then changes the subject. The senior waves me off too, saying, “Just note it in your workpapers,” which feels a lot like “don’t think too hard about it.” At this point I’m convinced I’m either imagining everything or the only sane person here, and I’m not sure which possibility worries me more.

If the data weren’t enough, the physical mail situation is equally bizarre. Our supposed audit correspondence is arriving late, out of order, or not at all. One envelope seemed to have been opened and resealed with tape. Another was addressed to someone named “Peppy Salvia,” which I assumed was just a typo until a second letter arrived for “Pepé Silva.” The admin team swears these people don’t exist. I’m starting to think the mailroom has a ghost.

Now the mail is piling up again, the dataset errors are multiplying, and the client still hasn’t given me a single piece of support in four weeks. This morning I found yet another envelope addressed to “Pepe Silva,” and at this point I’m starting to wonder if Pepe Silva is the only one around here who might actually know what’s going on.",0,1765286908.0,Accounting,6,0.18,False

# Preamble / background

I'm a 41 year old man now and have been running relatively seriously for the past 5 years. This was my 5th marathon with the previous ones ending in 3h28, 3h13, 3h10 and 3h24 (stomach issues) respectively. I really struggled with some injuries in the past year and after the 3:10 in Chicago 14 months ago I did not have the feeling I'd ever get faster after that.

After moving to a new city in a new country I found a great little casual running group that meets up in the early mornings (I work late and evening groups just don't work for me) and running with so many other fanatical and fast people has really given me a boost.

I kind of thought I'd set my PBs for life now that I'm in my 40s but it turned out that I had a lot more in me if only I trained more. Running with these new running friends I managed to already break my 5k twice over the summer (ending up with a 17:55) as well as my 10k twice (37:57 the day after a tough interval training).

# Training

Most of the people around me were training for a 'regular' fall marathon happening in September/October but I decided to just train along and join some of their training sessions even though it was a little early for me. I ended up doing about an 18 week block for that reason, with the last 14 of those really being structured marathon training. I was doing about 5 runs a week, 2 gym sessions, and 1 bouldering session just for fun. In total I ended up with 5 100 km weeks. I had alternate long runs - 1 week would be easy/at conversational pace, the next week would be hard with marathon speed intervals.

I did see a physiotherapist to keep an eye on my old achilles injury from Chicago and I did tape it for the longer runs just to be sure - it definitely did act up at times but the pain rarely became more than a 4/10, so I pushed through.

I also switched around my gels after having to throw up after two of my harder sessions - moving away from SIS 'regular' gels to SIS beta fuel and Maurten (all with a neutral taste) seems to have gotten rid of that issue.

After the other big European races training became a little bit more boring as I didn't have anyone else to train with. Luckily some of my friends were happy to still join me for some of the longer runs, but there were also some days where it was just cold, windy and hailing where I was running solo on a dyke for 34km and I was really wondering what on earth I was up to.

Aa tune up race I ran a 15k 3 weeks before the marathon (57:00) which gave me a ton of confidence.

The original goal before this block was 'just' a PB, but after some encouragement from others around me I decided to dare to go for a sub 3 hours. Based on how well those last few weeks went I decided to try a few minutes faster than that even, and I thought a 2:58 might be doable, and that'd be 7 minutes under the BQ giving me a good chance to get to run Boston.

# Pre-race

I felt like I made a really bad mistake by choosing to travel the day before the race and choosing to go via Madrid to save some money. I ended up leaving my house at 6:15 AM and only getting into my AirBNB at 16:00 - sitting on trains, planes and waiting in between can't be the ideal prep for a race day. I did a 3k/15 minute shake out in the beautiful old riverbed park, wanting to keep it as short as possible.

Food-wise I had two big pizzas with very little sauce and cheese and a ton of Frosties/Frosted Flakes just dry out of the bag, plus a bunch of carb drinks. I slept pretty well throughout the week but I did also see my HRV dropping, and then Friday + Saturday night I slept roughly 4.5 hours overnight plus a few small naps.

# Race day

Started with 4 bread rolls with honey and some more of those Frosted Flakes, plus two coffees, around 5:30AM - three hours before the start. Took a bike share bike and cycled to the park nice and early to meet up with my friend and get my bib from him - more on this later. Went to the bathroom two more times (the lines were super long) and did maybe 500 meters of jogging plus a few dynamic stretches, less than ideal but those bathroom lines were just so damn long.

  
The start was chaotic. I'm used to some sort of funnel/tapel to help thin out the crowd a little before the actual start line to give everyone some space but that clearly wasn't a thing here. Even though I was in wave 4 (a 2:50 to 3:00 prediction puts you in wave 4 in Valencia which is excluding the elites- that tells you something about this race) I was over the line within 1 minute of the race start.

I felt like I had absolutely no space in the first k and I was behind the 3:00 pacer - I was really looking for any gap and I felt like I was going way too slow here. Looking at my splits afterwards that mostly just a feeling! I also had missed the 1k marker and wasn't sure if my watch's GPS was correct so I really wasn't quite sure how fast I was running - I panicked a little there. It wasn't until we hit the 2k mark when the road widened a little and I was able to go past the 3:00 pacer and fine some space. The 3k mark was also the first marker I actually saw and it turned out I was just fine for time. From then on I managed to manually lap almost every time and I started to feel much better about my pacing.

Fuel wise I was alternating caffeinated and non-caffeinated gels every 5k, and taking salt tablets a little more frequently.I'm not a great warm weather running and until 20k things felt good.I was so grateful for the actual water bottles that they were giving out (which were even cooled!) instead of cups that allowed me to drink comfortably - they also gave me sufficient water to throw over my neck and keep pretty cool once things did start to heat up in the second half.

Around 23k or so I noticed that one pin of my bib had come loose. I was trying to somehow put it back through the paper while running but I couldn't manage it, and I noticed that all the water I had been throwing over me had made the bib soaked and heavy. I wasn't quite sure what to do with it but the big was still sticking to me so I thought I'd just continue to run, but a few hundred meters further the second top corner also came loose. I was really wondering what my options were and I ended up just ripping the last two corners and sticking the bib down my running underwear to try and keep it safe - I mean what else can I do?

A few ks further I was then thinking about how I read somewhere (maybe MarathonInvestigations?) about how a bib/chip under layers of clothing may or may not actually log your times, so my strategy from the 30k point onwards was actually take the bib out of my underwear (all of the ink was gone and the piece of paper was in a worse and worse state) and run over the timing mats with it in my hand, before putting it back in my underwear.

It was getting hot out there - from 30k onwards I really did feel like I had to put in a bit more effort to keep things steady but... it was still steady! I kept checking my RaceScreen Race Prediction and it looked like I might just do this. I was overtaking more and more people and I saw so many people (with or without medical assistance) along the sides of the streets which did make me quite nervous, but I still felt in control.

It wasn't until 40k that I felt like at least that sub 3 is in the bag, and the sub 2:58 was still looking good possible too. The last mile or so I really did start to pick up the pace as much as I could and I ended up finishing with whatever was left of my bib in hand with a sub minute 4 even to finish a 2:57:57.

# Post-race

My legs felt surpringly OK. I did take off the shoes (Adios Pro Evo 4s) as soon as I could and slowly walked past all the usual stuff to the bag drop - which might've been another 2k. I did get a little emotional there on the blue carpet for just a minute. Once I did finally get my bag and therefore my phone I first checked out what my friend who was also racing did - he ended up DNF'ing which was understandable given he got sick in the last few days before the race, but it still felt like such a shame. It was amazing to see all the supportive messages from so many friends and family. When I looked in the app at my own times I saw that sure enough, my 25k split where the bib was in my underwear was missing, so I'm really glad I decided to try and carefully take that thing out and stuff it back in every few k!

I also straight away started thinking about what's next - with better weather and good training maybe sub 2:55 is on the cards? I honestly wished I could just switch off that feeling of always wanting to go faster, but I've got a Berlin bib so eh, we'll see.

I'm also hoping to try and do some trail runs and not focus on times for a few months here.  
  
Had a great time hanging out on the beach with friends and eating a nice big paella in the evening. Part of me wanted to run the next morning but I decided to stick to cycling and walk, but I managed to go for a little run this morning already and things feel good!

So I live close to a speciality coffee roaster, they have a cafe and honestly make the best coffee. They know exactly what they’re doing.

My aim was to stop paying nearly 4 bucks for a black americano, a couple of times a day. 

Almost went with Sage but the reviews of the Ninja swung it for me. 

It’s taken a couple of weeks, and some advice from the kind folks on this sub, but now I’m making the best tasting coffee I’ve ever had, anywhere.

The cup I’ve just finished a few minutes ago was outstanding, just superb. 

Here’s what I’m doing now: 

Warm up the machine and cup with a couple of dummy shots.

Use freshly roast beans. 

Weight them out each time - keep them fresh and only put in what you need, 18.5g for me.

I’ve had my Alpine A290 GTS for two month now, and while I’m loving the car, the lack of cup holder was becoming a real issue for myself and my partner. Every drive feels like a Cirque du Soleil style balancing act.

Long story short: I’ve designed and laser cut my own cup holder in Black Acrylic. It slots neatly into the centre console (under the armrest) and installs without drilling, glue, or permanent changes. I’ve designed it to suit a certain cup (Yeti Rambler) which I’m planning to include with the cup holder, I would highly recommend using one of these to prevent any spills…

If anyone else here owns an A290 (or knows someone who does), give it a look. I’ve also copied a link to my website below and I’m happy to answer any questions or take feedback!

1pi7906,https://i.redd.it/yjl4zaoni66g1.jpeg,Then came The Incidence...,"Good morning! Not long ago, I promised to elaborate on my perplexing propensity for joint dislocations—an unfortunate party trick that has struck at various intervals throughout my life.

My doctors have told me that I have loose tendons (they used a much more technical term, but it escaped my brain almost the same moment it left their mouths) which not only make me unusually flexible but also means that my joints sometimes decide to part ways with their sockets—rather painfully and inconveniently, I might add. One of my uncles shared this same trait, so apparently it runs, or rather, limps in the family. 

At first, it was just fingers, and only while playing sports. Unpleasant, yes, but not life-altering. Then came The Incident.

I was sixteen, and it was a perfectly ordinary spring morning. The sun was rising, the household was peaceful, and my siblings and I were still asleep while my parents enjoyed a quiet breakfast in the kitchen.

As the smell of coffee, bacon, and eggs drifted down the hallway, I began to stir. I shifted in bed—barely—and suddenly an explosion of pain shot through my knee. It was unlike anything I had ever felt.

If my parents had ever wondered what sort of vocabulary one might acquire growing up around commercial fishermen and boatyards, well… that mystery was immediately solved. I swore a blue streak, grabbed my throbbing leg, and somehow hopped out of bed. Oddly, my knee didn’t look too alarming, but my foot was twisted into a configuration that would’ve impressed a contortionist. My toes were pointing in every direction except the one nature intended. (I later learned the dislocated knee had temporarily pinched a nerve.)

Reeling in pain, I hopped down the hall to the kitchen on my good leg. My poor mother stood up and gasped, “What’s the matter with your foot?!”

“It’s my knee!” I replied.

Eventually everything was sorted out, and I spent a few weeks on crutches. My mother had wanted me to take the day off from school, but I had an important test that I didn't want to miss, so knee back in place but still in pain, I hobbled in. However, my high school had three floors. But the kindly school nurse gave me a key to the elevator— which sounded great until I found out that it moved at the speed of a glacier. So, after a couple of rides, I went back to using the stairs—which, even on crutches, were faster.

It wasn’t until after I arrived at school, though, I remembered all the awful colorful language I’d unleashed during the Great Knee Revolt. As the family sat gathered around the dinner table that evening, I sheepishly apologized to everyone, admitting I hadn't realized what I was saying.

My dad, a loving but firmly old-school parent, regarded me with the practiced gravitas of a seasoned judge. Then he smiled and said, “Under the circumstances, I think we can forgive it this time.”

It was the first and only time my vocabulary ever earned official clemency.

I once watched a movie where the hero could dislocate his shoulder on command and put it right back in again—cavalierly, as though it’s no worse than cracking a knuckle. Well, let me assure you: it IS a big deal. And it's definitely not something I would do on purpose. When my shoulder went awry years later, it was another spontaneous dislocation. I had simply reached for a ladder—never even got to touch it, when out of the blue, I was hit with a terrible pain, like I'd been shot. I was alone and it took me a moment to realize what had happened. This was long before cell phones, so there was nothing to be done but drive myself to the doctor's and get it put back in.

And the absolute worst one? Displacing a rib from my spine. I do not recommend it. Zero stars. Given the choice, I would not repeat. But Fate doesn't always give us a choice. In this particular instance, I was minding my own business, driving home from the grocery store with my weekly haul. I must've, however, accidentally engaged my truck's Invisibility Cloak, because that's the only excuse I can think of to cause another driver to pull out in front of a full-sized pickup from 30 feet away. I barely had time to hit the brakes— no time to even come up with any of the heartfelt verbiage one might use in moments of duress. I was thrown against my seatbelt hard enough to pop that rib (and acquire other injuries). Ouch. 

People sometimes ask how I manage to stick so faithfully to my exercise routine. The answer is simple: it helps keep my tendons and their accomplices tightened, which in turn helps keep my joints where they belong. Plus, when you work at a desk, you need some way to counter all that sitting. 

And truly, nothing motivates a workout routine like the desire to avoid reliving past orthopedic adventures.

I hope all is well in your corner of the world! 🌞

Madrid is not only the capital of Spain with many attractions, but it is also a metropolis where most people do not like to stay at home and prefer to spend all their free time outdoors or walking in lively places.  
For locals, markets are an opportunity to buy fresh produce and meet friends and chat over a cup of coffee or something stronger. 

And for us, tourists, the market is another way to plunge into the colourful atmosphere of Spain and try an unusual dish or snack. And maybe buy something.

Getting rid of this huge awful rog stix led and only that. See pics for what I mean. 

I have found ways in bios and Armoury Crate that turn off ALL RGB for the board (turns off the headers) but I want my other RGB working obviously.  I think Asus has done this on purpose. 

I also found out how to turn it off while the computer is off using bios or Armoury Crate. 

I also tried  using signalRGB and it has the motherboard listed as a device, there is no single device listed for just the rog Strix LED light. I  can disable it but again that shuts off everything. I tried dimming it to 0% and this doesn't work. 

So the $1 million dollar question is HOW DO I TURN OFF ONLY THE ROG STRIX LED when the computer is on?

I will seriously send coffee money to the person who can share how to solve this.

*-6am*

I needed to use the bathroom and I fixed myself a coffee downstairs. I am perplexed by how odd it tastes. The bitterness is greater than before. Not even the sugar is making it better. 

Will discuss later. Must finish my account of last night. 

After supper, we were summoned to the drawing room, which I now saw had a roaring fireplace. At the center of the coffee table, I saw the surprise the Doctor was talking about. A large thin device of metal with what looked like a glass bowl for its base stood proudly and bewildered me with its ornaments. A long, tasseled leather hose stuck from its side and clay bowl wrapped in what looked like foil sat on top. There were hot coals from the fireplace atop that, and I realized that the base was filled with water. Before I could figure out its function, the doctor took the hose and inhaled. The base bubbled and like a magician, Weber produced a smoke ring out of thin air. I was sure I’d seen this before in a book somewhere, but was unsure exactly where. 

“A hookah!” exclaimed the professor. “I’ve never seen one in person before.”

“Not very common here in the states,” he said with a smile. “This, like the wine, is simply another one of my spoils of travel. Sit, if you please. I intend to share.” 

He handed the hose to the doctor who took it happily and puffed. He tried a smoke ring of his own, but to no avail. Then, he tried to hand it to me. I declined, but I do remember thinking the vapor smelled lovely. It was strange how tempting it was to me, considering I’m intolerant to tobacco on my best days- it always makes me sick. 

“Not even a try, Herr Manuel?” asked the Doctor. “I assure you its quite sweet.” 

“No,” I told him. “Thank you, but I’m fine.”  He offered me a cigar or pipe from his collection, but once more I insisted. Finally, with what I can only describe as a look of disappointment mixed with admiration, he grinned and moved on. 

He began to tell us about his time as an archeologist in Crete. Apparently he wrote several papers on the Minoan Language which has yet to be translated, though he assured us, he was closer than most. Crete is also where he bought the hookah, and he told us every detail- no matter how exhausting- about how difficult it was to transport. 

He also told us of his collection of books and the lengths he’d struggled to obtain some of them. I went on to ask him what his rarest book was, but he seemed hesitant to answer. 

“Rarity is a hard thing to measure, as with some of these copies, I don’t have a confirmed number on how many were ever made.”

“Then which one do you think, if any, do you have the only copy of.”

He fiddled with his bowtie as his face almost seemed to reach for an expression to disarm me. That same smile of his greeted me as he promised, “Tomorrow. Tomorrow, I will show you, if you still desire, the rarest book I own.”

With that, Maxwell changed the topic. He was in noticeably better spirits than he’d been in the dining room and his face wasn’t even rosy from the crying. He mentioned how our own journey had gone and how strange the townsfolk of Portley had been to us. He brushed off the report with a wave of his hand.

“Yes, yes,” he said. “They’re quite new here and still learning. I’m sure they’ll be much nicer once you depart. They don’t get too many visitors, and I am their only doctor. I’m half surprised they don’t have an accent like mine given how often I interact with them!” He laughed at that, as did Maxwell, whose mind was already content with the answer. However, my mind was still chewing on that first sentence.

They’re “new,” and “still learning,” were not explanations I expected to hear. What does that even mean? I’m still bothered by it now. 

They continued to puff on the hookah until eventually, the doctor stood up and walked over to the fire. He was framed by the Greek moldings and victorian hearth that was only visible through the yellow filter of gaslight.  

“I suppose you are still curious about supper. Or, more specifically, what supper did to you. Am I correct?”	We both nodded, and he smirked. Pushing up his glasses in an almost theatrical fashion he spoke:

“I have a confession to make, my friends. I have not been completely up front with you about the full extent of my promise. Maxwell, I recall in my letter I said that the plant I had developed could change the shape of history? That it could rescue those starving in the hoovervilles and save the farmer from ruin?” Maxwell nodded eagerly, like a child to his sunday-school teacher. Weber strolled over and took the hookah hose from him. He took a long puff and blew several smoke rings into the chandelier above us. The vapor looked like passing ghosts from where I sat. Weber took another deep, laboring breath. 

“Fifteen years ago, this would have been impossible for me. I suffered, my young friends, from tuberculosis of the lungs. Every handkerchief I owned was flecked with crimson, and every movement I made was done through great pain.” He puffed again on the hookah. “You probably wonder why it is then that I can do such things. Why can I indulge such pleasures? I tell you now it is because of my discovery.” 

He pulled something round from his jacket pocket, about the size of a tennis ball. It was a weird flesh toned color, though what hue exactly was hard to tell in the amber light of the room. It was then I noticed just how impossibly smooth and round it was. It sat balanced, despite having no base, but did have one spot where it sank. A small green stem with a jagged leaf sprouted from its top. 

“Behold,” the doctor said, gesturing to the professor to touch it, “the Eden Fruit.” 

Maxwell picked it up and studied it, examining it as tenderly as a golden egg. I was mesmerized by the thing, but with a little more concern. It was such an odd looking fruit. 

“You see,” Weber said, “I’m an archeologist by trade, but with my worsening condition, I realized I need to turn to something less dusty and likely to make me cough, lest my death fall upon me like a viper. I turned to science. I looked for cures in chemistry, but found nothing. I looked into anatomy, searching for something to cut or scrape out, and still my efforts were in vain. I decided then, if not in medicines or surgeries, perhaps a cure could be derived from a more…. *Natural* source.” He pointed at the fruit in Maxwell’s hands. “After cross pollinating countless times, studying the effects of different herbs on the body, and after thousands of unsuccessful grafts, this is the result of my labors.” 

He walked over slowly and gently plucked the fruit from Maxwell’s hand. He then jerked his face toward me and extended the thing my way. 

“I insist you try it.” 

There was  something in the way he said it that almost made me shudder. He noticed.

“No?” he asked. “It’s perfectly safe. See?” He took a bite of the pink flesh himself and ripped a chunk away. What remained in its place was a large hole that revealed an interior so scarlet, I thought blood would ooze from it. It was like some demonic apple, and yet Weber appeared to savor it like it was the sweetest chocolate he’d ever tasted. He offered it to me again, but I still couldn’t do it. He merely shrugged at my denial and tossed it back to Maxwell, who barely hesitated to take a bite. He chewed for a moment before staring at it in wonder. 

“Peaches?” he wondered. “But sweeter, somehow?”

“Funny,” Weber replied, “I normally get bananas or figs.” He took a seat in an armchair closest to the fire. “Through much effort and experimentation, I have made the flavor malleable. It will take on the flavor a person merely wants it to have. For instance, if you bite it expecting fruit, you will most likely taste your favorite one. Is yours peaches, Maxwell?” 

The  professor nodded. 

“Excellent. It works a charm, even now in its fifth generation.” Before I could raise the question, he cut me off. “Over fifteen years, I have produced four other variants of this fruit. I am happy to say this is the strongest one. It not only can take the flavors of desired fruit, but also of other substances.” He looked at me. “Stew, per se.”

If I’d been able to throw up, I would have then. Being fed such a thing without my permission was one thing, but the illusion of its flavor and consistency unnerved me. I stared in wide eyed horror while the professor was clearly filled with amazement. 

“I apologize for the deception,” Weber said, raising an apologetic hand my way, “but I felt it was the easiest way to make you believe me. Thankfully I am a decent cook and you seemed none the wiser.”

“That’s completely unethical,” I told him. “What if we’d been allergic? Magic fruit or stew or whatever you want to call all of this… What if we’d died?”

“Oh, Herr Manuel,” he said, stroking his mustache. “You would not die from this. On the contrary. Look what wonders it has done for your body.”

I touched my throat as Maxwell burst out:

“You mean to say that this fruit-”

“Yes, professor, I do.” He gestured at the fruit with the hookah hose. “The same fruit that cured me of my tuberculosis is the same remedy that fixed Manuel’s aches and soothed your poor heart from despair.”

My blood ran cold as he said these things. Maxwell’s face finally looked more like mine than that of a gullible child, but there was still no suspicion. He tugged at the fringe of his beard as he rolled the fruit around in his hand. 

“How is any of this possible?” my mentor asked. I expected a sharp reply, but instead, there was a beat of thought. Weber stood to his feet at the fireplace crackled behind him and he licked his dry lips. 

“I fear I have overloaded your poor brains with too much information for one night,” he said. “I apologize for this. We may dive into the science of it all tomorrow, but for now, both of you need rest. Please, I’ll clean up once we’ve settled you in. No protest, now. I insist. If I continue to explain myself, you shall be a puddle of mush by morning. No, no. After breakfast I will take you to the orchard. For now, sleep awaits you. Gentlemen, please follow me.”

With that, he insisted Maxwell finish the fruit and he produced another one for myself from some pocket I couldn’t discern. He encouraged me to do the same when I preferred, insisting I would prefer eventually. 

With that, we were led to our bedrooms and given keys to our doors. He instructed us where the bathrooms were and where his bedroom was should we need him. Finally, he told us something that in my exhaustion I didn’t quite catch or understand, but now reflecting on it all, still startles me. 

“Please don’t go outside,” he said. “In places like this, with the shadows and the treeline as close as they are, the dark may play tricks on you. The wind may howl and your tired minds may get the better of you, but don’t fool yourself. Stay inside at night at all times, and don’t venture out without telling me.”

With that he shook our hands and bid us good night, though I struggled to sleep. For whatever reason, I’m still thinking of Marie. Perhaps it was because of the doctor’s wild story of tuberculosis- however untrue it may be. Or maybe its the crazier dream I can’t help having. If this fruit is all it’s made out to be, and all its properties are as Weber described, could it have helped you, Marie? My mother?

A strange thing happens as I write this. I find that the more I ache for you, Marie, the more I crave this devil-fruit on my desk. I don’t think it can help, but then again, I remember Maxwell. I am distraught at my own circumstances.

*-7am*

I took a bite. It tasted like strawberries. Those were always your favorite. Chest more relaxed. Head more clear. Heart still broken. 

\*-\**~~12:15 pm~~*

~~Imposimble~~

\-*2pm*

I feel that I need to control myself as I write because I fear my excitement may not allow for a clear explanation. I feel like I’m dreaming and if I don’t have this journal to look back on and keep my facts straight, I fear my story will get me locked away in some institution. It's the facts I need to focus on. The facts, Marie. Facts.

Here they are:

After my entry from this morning, I went downstairs once more to return the borrowed coffee cup and found the professor and doctor sitting in the drawing room once again- this time with cigars- discussing all sorts of academic matters. The professor was wearing a cable-knit sweater and his fedora sat comfortably on his crossed knee. The doctor, sitting opposite him on his lavish red velvet couch, was wearing a different shade of tweed and a necktie in place of his bowtie from the night before. It was just as colorful as the bowtie, however, and was adorned in a pattern of Turkish tulips. 

I know that’s what they were because that was exactly the topic they’d moved onto when I walked in. They laughed and slapped each other's shoulders as they talked about one odd encounter after another. Maxwell dropped a stub of ash on his sweater and almost lost his mind laughing. It was as if they were drunk without any of the symptoms of whiskey. 

Eventually, Weber stopped laughing and stood to his feet. He blew the smoke in his mouth into the silver chandelier that hung from a flaking gilded ceiling. Gold fluttered down like snow as the light breeze kissed it. I stared up in curiosity as Weber put a hand on my shoulder and laughed. 

“Forgive the decay of my home, Herr Manuel. The building we stand in was once home to a reclusive Prussian count by the name of Henrich Bastian. He came to this land in the 70s after the unification of my homeland and lived in moderate luxury and great disgrace. Bastian was disliked by chancellor Bismark, you understand, and for good reasons. On a drunken night, Bastian killed an army officer in the courtyard of a nobleman's house- one favored greatly by the army and deeply loved by one of Bismark’s cousins-'' He raised a hand to stop himself. 

“I ramble. The point of the matter is this: He fled the hangman’s rope on the first boat he could with as much gold and as many heirlooms as he could pack and built this manor in the middle of Georgia. You could say his sin- our murderous Cain, if you will- is what gives us such a lavish home in such a wilderness. Remnants of the man and his small family are everywhere. There! See? I keep a photo of him and his son next to the stairs.”

In the pale morning light that now filled the hallway, I did see what he was talking about. In the corner of the stairwell hung a tin-type portrait of a heavily mustached man standing beside a somber-looking woman in dark dress. Beneath them, unsmiling, was a young man no older than sixteen. He looked scared, to a degree, and there was some wetness about his eyes that gave me the impression he was a moment from breaking into tears. 

The professor’s wrinkled finger crept in at the corner of my vision. “The young man in the chair,” he said, “was Joseph Bastian. He was the one whose death secured my inheritance of this place.”

“You were related?” I asked him, a pang of sympathy besieging my heart. The look on his face was pitiful and mournful. 

“*Ja,*” he said, slipping into his mother tongue. “An amazing cultural exchange, it would seem. My mother, American by birth, moved to Germany to be closer to her distant relatives after losing her first husband to the American Civil War. A marriage in Berlin to a lawyer eventually led to me, and I grew up never knowing I had an aunt.” he pointed again. “That is her, next to the count. Frau Jennifer Bastian.” 

He puffed on his cigar as he took a few admiring steps towards the young man pictured. “Joseph- my dear unknown cousin- grew up in a world without me. We never had the chance to lean on each other. When I was in the trenches, facing Russian bullets and fleeing English tanks, I did not have his kind face to think of- for I imagine such a soft soul was kind. We never had the chance to discuss our lives. Never was a drink shared between us or a cigar passed. We never expressed the burdens of our families to each other- our fathers!” His eyes glazed over with haunted memories. “My father was cold, true. The count, however, was a hot-head and a drinker. How many bruises, I wonder, are hidden in such a portrait? Do I dare think of it?” He paused, as if actually considering the question, then sighed. “Indeed, I cannot help it.” 

I searched for a word to say, but was beaten by the professor. “How did the young man die, Doctor Weber?”

He kept his back to us in silence for several moments as cigar smoke rose from his tightened fist. 

“They say suicide,” he told us in a surprisingly quaint tone, “but I disagree. I believe it murder- even if not direct.” His gaze seemed to shift ever so slightly to the man standing above young Joseph. His fiery dead stare matched the doctor’s icy gaze. “If *Graf* Bastain is Cain, then young Joseph is Able…”

I almost went to comfort him when he spun around and tossed a hand over his shoulder, “That said, gentlemen, you did not come to hear of my family history, nor of murderous deeds and dead relatives. Come!” He immediately grabbed a pith safari cap from an almost explicitly hidden coat rack and placed it on his head. “I must show you my research and answer all of the questions you have from last night. We will venture out, visit the orchard, and then come back for lunch. Herr Manuel, once we’ve eaten and taken a rest- for you will want one, I assure you- I will show you the most prized book in my family’s collection. For now, come! Come, gentle friends. We must be off!” 

Professor Maxwell was already through the door, donning his coat and fedora as he went. He still had an almost puppy-like excitement that kept me from recognizing the man I’d come to know and admire for his stoicism. I still recall the long nights we spent together in his study, sparing over Aristotle and Marx. His eyes were sharper then, and untrusting. I’d worked for years beneath him just to get him comfortable enough to say my first name. He was like a tiger I’d befriended over months of slow and steady approach, working patiently and calmly enough that I could now pet him without fearing a bite. 

When you died, Marie, he was the only one who checked on me. 

Now, this mysterious doctor we’ve just met practically has him house-broken. I am perplexed to say the least. 

That said, I followed the pair closely out and followed them into the yard. I was almost stunned with how fast they were moving, given their age. In the gray light of day, I could now take in the expanding sage clearing that spread out for two acres around the hillside where we stood.  We were fenced in by an army of pine and holly trees that seemed to stretch the stratus clouds even thinner than they were. 

Weber was speeding along to an opening in the treeline, marked ominously by a dead poplar tree. A carpet of brown leaves wound down into a curving path, and the Doctor gestured to it like the Yellow Brick Road. 

“This way, gentle friends! The grove is only a half mile away.” He started down the path without looking back, completely confident in our obedience. He had no reason to worry, it seemed. We both took off after him, trying to keep pace with his surprisingly lively gait. (For such an old man, he moves like a fox!) 

I struggled myself to keep up with the two older men, as it appeared even the professor had more pep in his step than normal. 

I dare not wonder if it’s a result of the fruit. 

We ended up in another clearing before long, and discovered Weber, perfectly full of breath and free of exhaustion, puffing on the last bit of his cigar. He extinguished it on a patch of wet clay while Maxwell fanned himself with his hat and I loosened my tie. I had to pick a piece of pine straw out of my collar, along with a deer tick. 

“I am glad to see my old bones don’t slow down the young and healthy!” the old man laughed, straightening his tie. “Welcome, dear friends, to the grove.”

“Shall we see a specimen today then?” I asked, fanning my shirt against my chest. “One of the trees for this supposed miracle fruit of yours?”

“It is no miracle,” he said in a tone more serious than I expected. “I would thank you for remembering that much.”

His eyes grew darker for a hair of a second before resetting back to the same gentle face we’d grown accustomed to. I admit I almost jumped when he did so. I then got a soft look of reproach from the professor, who seemed offended on Weber’s behalf for my sharp comment.

“Now then, Maxwell,” he said, “He is simply tired from the jaunt over, is all. Let us come this way, I think and we shall see… Ah! Yes. Here is one!”

We followed him briefly around a cluster of shrubs and oak before taking in a sight that almost cost me my stomach. 

Before us, unlike anything I’ve ever seen, was a tree of medium height. Its bark was ruddy and firm, almost like that of a birch but smoother. I can’t compare the color in my head- Lord forgive me for thinking this- to anything other than the hue of dried blood. That alone was cause for alarm amongst the soft gray bodies of the vegetation around us, but as I took more of it in, I realized it was covered in *thorns*.

Even now I fear I underplay it in my writing. When I say it was covered in thorns, I don’t mean like that of a hawthorne or honeylocust. These thorns were all at least three inches long and pale at the tips, giving them the impression of horns or claws protruding from flesh. The leaves, likewise, were full, almost black in color, and surrounded on the perimeter by jagged points. By all accounts, they looked worse than decomposed. They looked *otherworldly*. 

“Here we have it, gentlemen,” Weber said, approaching the tree with admiration. “An infant, but still of use! Behold the *Verger* tree!” 

He raised his hand and suddenly I became aware of something weighing down the lowest branches. On the ends of some of the growths were masses of pink, fleshly buds, each at least the size of a golf ball. From each side of them, long tendrils covered in thorns draped down like willow leaves, scratching away at that topsoil as the wind swayed them. 	“Forgive the bareness of the tree,” Weber said, “This is where I harvested last. For dinner, you remember.”

My stomach was knotted up as the implications of such a plant became made known to me. I was sick, but at the same time had a hard time rationalizing why. As incredible as it was, science told me this was still just a tree and not something cast down from heaven. Still, I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was off about this plant. 

“You’ll notice gentlemen, that the soil around it is not generous with nutrients. In fact, it is nearly devoid of nutrients. Maxwell,” he said, with earnesty, “would you kindly take a look at this deposit here?” 

He pointed to a small patch of grainy, white soil not far from one of the veiny roots of the tree. Maxwell did as asked and bent down to examine it. He rubbed it between his fingers, sniffed it, and after a brief moment’s thought, placed some on his tongue. His eyes went wide as the flavor hit him.

“Why, it’s salt!” he said, almost gasping. “Salt and clay….” He looked at the doctor in amazement as the German spoke.

“A wonder, yes? Though a mistake on my part, to some degree.” He went up to the tree and plucked off one of the golf-ball fruits. “I was experimenting with soil compositions, trying hard to breed out a weakness inherent in the plant.” He bent down beside Maxwell and dropped the fleshy fruit into the deposit. I was stunned to see it almost immediately shrivel up and dry as the salt touched it. It was almost comical, like something from a picture-show. Unreal, yet so lifelike. 

“Salt seems to destroy the fruit almost immediately and stunts the growth of the trees,” he said, rising. “I salted this ground myself at great risk of my own horrible failure to prove its resiliency. This,” he said with a gesture, “is the tree and its fruit at its weakest.” We stood in silence as we contemplated last night’s dinner. “As you can see, even crippled, the tree can perform wonders.”

“A tree with fruit like that, that can grow nearly anywhere….” Maxwell’s face regained the sharpness I was used to, if only briefly, as his mind wandered into the realm of possibilities. 

“Wait,” I said, breaking his wonder, “If this is the species at its lowest and contained, then what does it look like at its height?”

It was then Weber gave me an almost devilish smile, and one that tried hard to hide any malice. He clapped me on the shoulder, and softly told me, “ask, my friend, and you shall receive.” 

With that he turned around and gestured us along another path, away from the sapling.

 (I can’t believe I can call it that, but I’m running out of words to describe it.)

Maxwell’s face was still swimming with thought as we followed the doctor. Through the crackling of leaves and twigs beneath our feet, I could swear I could hear him muttering. I even think it was a name. 

I hardly had time to speculate. 

“You probably wonder how it is that this plant lives if not through nutrient-rich soil, sunlight, and water,” Weber said, his back to us, pacing along like a specter in the thicket. He made almost no sound upon the leaves as he walked. “It is a strange matter, is it not?”

“I’d say it is,” I told him.

“Your mind has no doubt wondered about it since my demonstration back there, Herr Manuel,” he said. “That said, I must ask- as my mind slips- have I asked you about your german? How well do you know it?” 

“You have not and I know little outside of ‘please,’ ‘thank you,’ and, ‘where is the bathroom?’” 

“Hmmm,” he said, slowing his pace. “I have a dictionary back at the house that should help you. Learn the meaning of *verger* and then I believe you will come to understand. For now, I will leave you with Latin. I believe that will suffice. Yes….” He stopped and faced me with a dark glint in his eye. “*Natura vindicat*.”

“Nature…” I said as I stumbled through my roots. “Nature… nature *reclaims*?”

He smiled at me. 

“Very good,” he said. “Now let us examine this principle in action, shall we?”  
  
We rounded into another clearing where the soil once again became bare, though unlike the last patch, this one was dark and rich. My eyes weren’t on the ground for long, however, as they were soon drawn to the sight of \*it\*.  
  
Before us, towering over every tree in the vicinity, was a \*Wünger.\* It stood at least forty to fifty feet tall, with each of its rust-red limbs stretching out like a toothy web overhead of us. Long, sinewy vines of thorns and black leaves wove through the tops of surrounding oaks and firs with impunity, stretching off into nowhere. I almost dropped my journal as I took it in.   
  
I tried writing something down earlier about it, but I couldn’t even process what I saw into words. I can barely process it now.   
  
Marie, there were living things caught up in that tree’s thorns. Struggling things. Spaced out like flies in a spiderweb, there were squirrels, various birds, mice, even what looked like a fox impaled upon those horn-like growths. The leaves around us were speckled with crimson and I swear I could hear the labored breaths of those suffering creatures above us.   
  
Just when I thought my horror couldn’t grow, Weber whistled at me and Maxwell. I’m relieved to write that the sight of this monstrosity seemed to shock him just as much as it did me, but neither of us were prepared for what we saw next.  
  
Weber was standing a few yards away from us, pointing down at a blob of pink that was almost the size of a toddler. A huge fleshy melon, free of blemish or bruising, sat at his feet. A long conical branch connected it to the tree and several of those sharp tentacles splayed out around it.   
  
I puked.   
  
“I apologize, Herr Manuel,” Weber said, offering me a handkerchief that Maxwell had to pass me. I couldn’t bear to look up and risk seeing that thing again.   
  
“It is a lot to take in at first,” he said, “and I do truly apologize for not properly warning you. You see,” he said pointing toward one of the entangled, bleeding animals above us, “the species is carnivorous, not unlike the venus flytrap. It survives such harsh conditions because for reasons I have yet to discern, it grows just as well on blood as it does on water and sunlight. That said, it’s parasitic nature and the size of its unharvested fruits- such as this one here…” He thumped the melon with his thumb and forefinger, creating a noise that almost made me puke again. “Well, you understand why I harvested from the lesser and not the greater.”   
  
He crossed the distance and laid a caring hand on my back. “I know. I know. Nature, Herr Manuel is a fickle and oftentimes cruel thing. \*Mien Gott\*, if you could even read of the nature of animals in the wild, you would soon understand this is not even among its greatest horrors. Penguins, dolphins, cats, even the simple duck! All of them are guilty of atrocities greater than this, I assure you.”  
  
I eventually steadied myself and regained my posture, leading the good doctor to giving me a firm pat on my back. Maxwell, however, was still looking at the melon. He started to reach out for it, slowly, before Weber snapped, “No, Maxwell!”   
  
With incredible speed, he took hold of the professor’s wrist and pulled him to his feet. There was a strained silence and concerned gaze passed between the two of them before Weber finally let go.   
  
“I-I,” he stuttered as he adjusted his glasses, “I’m sorry, my friend. It’s just that this tree… Well, it gives one cause for concern. Please, if you ever see fruit larger than your fist, do not touch it. The thorns can be tricky and by the time a fruit is \*this\* large, it is no longer ripe.”  
  
“Why is there only one fruit on this tree?” Maxwell asked, his eyes wandering around the surrounding area. “Should there not be more?”  
  
“I imagine there are,” said Weber, “but the nature of the vines and my harvesting habits leave it hard to find any fruits simply lying around. With the size of this, and the other trees, it’s hard to say where they’ll pop up.”  
  
“Others?” I found myself saying. Weber nodded.   
  
“There are three other trees, like this one,” he said, “though I doubt they’re as big.”  
  
I’d be lying if I said my blood didn’t run cold. That tree, its fruit, the nature of its survival, all terrified me.   
  
I wished and still do hope to be back in Virginia soon. The Georgia isles can wait. I simply wish to be back home.   
  
We traveled back after that, and, despite the horror we’d both experienced, Maxwell was once again casually talking to Weber about logistics. They prattled on about giving lectures on the fruit. On the profits, both financially and socially, of this discovery. They talked of aiding starving families, of emptying children’s hospitals, and ending cancer. They spoke of Utopia, but I could only see Hell. I still do. Every time I think of that tree, I shudder.   
  
Even now, I hold back. I’m looking over my shoulder as I write this. Weber should be arriving at my door any minute now. He wishes to show me his most valuable book, but I’m concerned at what this might entail. None of his surprises have been good so far.   
  
Enough. I shall write this last thing and leave it be for now, just for the sake of my nerves. It couldn’t have been right, and I’m sure my eyes were playing tricks on me, but while traveling back to the house, I checked the path behind us and saw something moving in the brush.   
  
I got separated from the others for a brief moment, so only I witnessed this, but out of the woods, walking along the path, there came a deer.   
  
It was an eight-point buck, fit with a speckled mane and white tail. This alone wasn’t what startled me, but what was on it did. Growing around the antlers, tangled and menacing, were little black vines and leaves. Any thorns they had were invisible to me, and they did not disappear when I rubbed my eyes. What was not invisible was the rabbit in its mouth.  
  
Like some wild dog, this stag had a bloodied rabbit hanging from its almost unnaturally wide jaws. It almost looked like it had fangs, but I was too far away to tell. I swear, I feel mad just writing this down, but it looked at me, Marie.

I can’t get its eyes out of my head. They were leaking some black, viscous substance that crusted against its fur. 

Without warning, it fled back into the woods, carrying the rabbit with it. I still don’t know what to make of it, but if it’s real, then what? Why did it look like part of the tree? Or vice versa? I must have been hallucinating. I must have. 

Marie, I can’t help but think of those words Weber told me. 

*Natura Vincidcat*. 

Nature Reclaims. 

I’m hungry….

I recently bought some foaming hand soaps (in person) at one of my local stores. I believe they were 5/$27 maybe? Anyway, I’ve used these soaps forever. Sometimes I buy a really large amount (for me, because I don’t have lots of space to store them) so maybe 10 at a time or so. I just finished the last of last year’s batch that I had saved up so they were not new by any means. They were wonderful, as usual. Okay, here comes my gripe. First of all, the really nice lady at my store informed me that they are no longer carrying marshmallow fireside which really broke my heart. Lastly, the 5 brand new soaps are horrible! They’re basically coming out mostly liquid even though they’re supposed to be “foaming” hand soaps. I shook them really hard, I put them in a warmer room, I put them outside for a while to get colder - nothing. And it’s all 5 soaps. Has anyone else had this problem? I actually bought them because I’m on a big family vacation right now and I put one in each of the 5 bathrooms that we have at our rental house. It’s kind of embarrassing when people want to know why their pretty vanilla bean Noel soap is shooting out like a liquid and dripping down the side of the sink. Guys, I’m sad.

**Years after the fact, one man recalls the haunting events of his first bartending job.**

 

The Gold Exchange, a looming relic of the Gold Rush era, stands proudly in a small city in Colorado. Once a bustling hub of trade, now a grand old hotel, it exudes the mystery and faded luxury of another age. Locals call it a monument. Devin calls it a paycheck.

Behind the bar, Devin learns the ropes, forges friendships, and falls in love. But beneath the ornate ceilings and polished brass lies something ancient and incomprehensible—a slithering entity of stone, illusion, and void. Older than the building. Older than the bedrock itself.

As Devin slips deeper into the hotel’s grip, reality begins to unravel. Friends change. Time bends. And a voice older than memory whispers from the walls.

You don’t leave the Gold Exchange.  
Not whole.

**The Exchange:**

This is a story from a few years back, from when I got my first bartending job. Thought I’d put it here. I’m a full-on, swanky bartender now; I serve rich old folks their last hundred or so martinis at a golf club—as well as the odd tech millionaire or local politician. Monetarily, it’s a fine living (the dying and the rich tip surprisingly well) but it’s boring…and oddly solitary. It’s different from any of the watering holes I worked in downtown Denver, with all the sweaty, loud, and at times pernicious people hopped up on freedom and stupidity. I miss being around people my age, I suppose, but I’d take being bored around old people that know my name over witnessing social degeneration under a microscope. Bar fights, groping, attempts at drugging, flirting turned to cheating. Once, I saw a guy sucking on some random woman’s tits right in the middle of the dance floor, like a giant infant. I mean, no tact, no cheeky trip to the bathroom—just right out in the open. They got thrown out, of course, but I like to think he’s still suckling to this day.

I’m getting off track…

It may be boring, but a golf club bar is much more well-lit than a bumping club, and it squeezes many fewer gyrating bodies together. It holds less objects for shadows to grow from and casts its space in light, rather than *his* frantic beings. After what happened to me, and to Addy…I need both of those things.

When I was twenty-one and in my third year of college, I lost the part-time job I’d had at a pet store. I was smoking a hell of a lot of weed at that time in my life, and though I doubt the cats, dogs, or hamsters cared all that much, the management did, and I came in a few too many times smelling like cheap grass. I needed a job, however, having moved from Denver to Colorado Springs for college, leaving my family and their security. Because I loved to drink as well, I thought bartending would be a good angle for a part-time money-maker. I dressed my best, printed out my meager resume, and pounded the pavement downtown. After ten or twelve places all but laughed me out of their fine establishments, I tried an old hotel called The Gold Exchange. They took me on as a bar-back—a bartender’s helper-monkey—but they said that in a few months I could be trained and put onto the real job.

It was a local place, rather than any national or statewide franchise, remodeled from a hub where mine owners, businessmen, and anyone with a tall enough hat would meet and exchange stocks and cigar smoke. It was acquired by one John L. Garland in the roaring twenties, who turned it into a hotel for more of the tall-hat people, but was left abandoned in the first year of The Great Depression. It remained vacant save for unfortunates for ten years, then exchanged hands three times with no progress against its dilapidation, before finally being purchased by a young millionaire who’d come back from the Western Front and invented some sort of kitchen gadget that sold like hot-cakes.

So, there it stood: the very same stone that men had erected before there were electric lights and television sets and lobotomized wives. The mid-twentieth-century amenities and décor—some borrowed from France and Germany—did not clash with the chiseled beige stonework or the too-small hallways or the faded statue of Robert Miller Womack, the man responsible for the Cripple Creek gold rush; rather, the amalgamation worked to meld the area’s gold and silver mining past with post-war consumption and excess, and it did it well. All this, I learned in a tour I was forced to attend upon hire. They were apparently still quite proud of the hotel’s history, though the young millionaire who’d saved it from a wrecking ball had been dead for nearly forty years. Those facts were cool if you were a history nerd or a little kid with mineshaft dreams, but to me it didn’t matter at all.

I worked in the lobby lounge day-to-day, and when they needed an extra hand or three for banquets and galas and the like, I washed glasses, cut fruit, and refilled ice bins for ten hours straight. I’m not generally a nervous person, but I felt more than a little on my first shift, given the fanciness of the place, the people I worked with, and the people we served. The first person I met there, other than the hiring manager and the tour guide, was a small blonde woman named Addison. The second was a tall, skinny guy named Rich. Together, they ran the lobby bar. They were fast, efficient, yet also artful in making cocktails, and the vast majority of the time, they were entirely professional.

At first, they made me more anxious, but when the customers weren’t around, that façade dropped away and they were just college kids like me. Addison was working the evening shift to pay for a biology degree; Rich a degree in finance. During lulls, we talked about TV shows and video games and the weather and pretty much anything else we could. We complained about our superiors, about the night shifters and the day shifters, and about the customers, of course. In a matter of hours that first day, I knew I’d picked the right line of work and the right establishment in that line of work. They washed any anxiety from me, and it wasn’t long until the three of us were truly friends. Rich and I bonded over Poker and our love of cars, among other things. Five or six times, we’d trekked up to the tiny old mining town of Cripple Creek, hosing the house for their chips and using the proceeds to buy cocktails we’d make fun of. The three of us, as well as Rich’s younger sister Miranda, had gone on two or three camping trips during the summer and fall: the beauty of nature and the beauty of friendship pulling me from my old habits and populating my new life with purpose and a lingering sense of positivity, a sense I could do anything.

I was happy.

The trouble began three months into my being there. Christmas was just around the corner, and with it, the Colorado winter rolled right in. Gone were 60-degree November days where you could stand in the direct sun, close your eyes, and believe summer was more than a ghost. Here now were ice storms and bitter winds that cut through everything you put on, cut right to your bones, so it took hours to recover from the chill. It was far from insufferable though; not when you had silver tinsel and warm yellow lights on every tree, real or fake; not when old Christmas songs fell out of every speaker and seemed to collect in the corners of rooms and in people’s hearts; and not when the smell of warm spices, crackling logs, and cashmere dominated every room.

Addison and I had begun dating just before Halloween, which helped as well to lift the mood of my life. When I first started the job, I hadn’t seen or sensed any interest or flirtation from her, though I’ve always found it hard to tell for sure. In the middle of fall, however, I caught her eyes lingering on me from time to time, the slightest rosy flush underneath a laugh when I would put on my deep “Southern-Charmer” voice. So, when I mustered up my courage, I asked her if she’d go to a haunted house with me—dinner afterward. She said she’d love to, as long as I didn’t mind her fingernails trying to dig at the bones of my forearm. She did, indeed, clutch hard when masked men with chain-saws and axes came revving and swinging out of hidden passages. We screamed and laughed, and at one scare, she jumped nearly into my arms. We shared a kiss that night, and for weeks thereafter, I found it almost impossible to work near her without hugging her to me or spinning her about in a dance.

That was fun, but our relationship began to truly temper—to form into something real—as we shared our backstories. I’m an orphan; someone that was genetically my mother swaddled me in a faded Bronco’s jersey and plopped me down in front of a firehouse in downtown Denver. The foster care system treated me a lot better than it does many others: a loving family of three that have been mine since I was fourteen months old. From them I received education and opportunity, and especially love, rather than abuse and neglect that might have left me to wander out on my own before I was at all fledged. Even by the time I’d graduated high school, I’d worked through any abandonment issues.

Addison was not also an orphan. Not in common parlance, anyway. Her mother had died of horribly metastasized pancreatic cancer when Addison was only seven, and her father had slunk slowly down a hole of grief, becoming more and more distant by the year. She recalled an evening when she was nine on which she prodded and begged her father to make dinner—this was after he’d missed picking her up from school, and she’d had to walk—but he only sat in his leather recliner, a forgotten Old-fashioned on the coffee table, nothing then but liquor scented water. She’d pulled at his leg, yelled at him, and cried, but he only sat and stared into blank space. The young Addison—inches shorter than the average nine-year-old—had clambered up on the counter to get to the phone, dialing a few numbers before finally getting her aunt Gina.

She’d lived with that same aunt Gina and her uncle Matthias for a little over four months, while her father stayed in a “hospital”; and though her father recovered somewhat, she said he was never right. They hadn’t kept in any standard father-daughter contact past her high school graduation, though she said she checked in on him once every few months. She cried telling me these things, and I hugged her: the most I could do to make it better. Trauma bonding seems to be very real and very strong.

When it got cold, she would make me hot drinks, and she always seemed to have something on hand when I wanted a snack. I would walk her to her car every night after our shift ended, and there were nights we talked about more positive things until the sun came up. She taught me most of what I know about bartending and mixology. She was intelligent and beautiful and as sweet as they come. Despite her past, she seemed somehow impervious to negativity and bad moods under day-to-day circumstances, so it surprised me to see her crying that night, the 21^(st) of December, I think it was.

“What’s wrong?” I asked, peeling my coat and gloves off. I placed them on the coat rack that stood in the corner of the little staff office behind the bar. She didn’t look up at me, but only sat in the chair with her head in her hands, her hair hanging down and obscuring her. I pushed the office door closed and went to her. “Addy? What’s wrong?”

It took me kneeling down and grasping her arms for her to acknowledge me, but she still wouldn’t look into my eyes. Our shift had only just begun: eight hours of pouring and shaking and making small talk with rich folks. If it hadn’t been something here—a customer or manager yelling at her or deriding her, a tray of drinks she had fumbled—then what? Something about her father? Something serious?

“Addison, you have to tell me what’s wrong. Please.”

She took in a long, wet breath and finally tilted her face up to mine, slowly lowering her hands. Generally, she wore only a little makeup, and that still held true that night. However, the little mascara there had run into four smoky tracks.

“Devin?” She asked it even more with her eyes. Though she saw me, and I was sure she had heard me, her eyes were distant, as if she were looking past me, pondering something.

“Yeah, I’m here. Why are you crying, baby?” I rubbed her upper arms with my thumbs.  

Her eyes focused and found my own. “I—I can’t talk about it right now,” she said. She checked her watch, then stood. I stood with her and held her arms lightly for a second more before she twisted softly away from me and went to her purse on the manager’s desk. Quickly, as if seconds ago she hadn’t been a puddle of hair and tears, she reached into her purse and retrieved makeup wipes, a small mirror, and a tube of mascara. She began to clean under her eyes, then to reapply the mascara. I stepped beside her, opened my mouth, then closed it. She’d gone from sobbing and unresponsive to entirely calm and collected in a matter of seconds. In the mirror, she finished one eye, then moved on to the other: fast, steady, efficient. Her mouth made no more expression than to draw down into an O to stretch the skin of her face and provide an even canvas. I was struck speechless until she began tossing all her tools back into her purse.

“Uh…Addison?” Zipping the purse closed, she shot her eyes toward me, bidding me to continue. “Are you alright?” She turned to me while fixing up her hair, and despite what had just occurred, I found myself placated, almost assured, by her posture and renewed face. It could have been that she’d never been doubled over in the chair, never been wrecked by some cocktail of emotions.

“I’ll be fine,” she said. “It was nothing.”

“Addy, that wasn’t nothing. You were crying.”

“Devin, I cry sometimes. You’ll get to know that about me.”

It was matter-of-fact, on the border of curt, and I stood dumbstruck, trying to form an adequate reply. She *didn’t* just ‘cry sometimes’. Before I got anything out, Addison stood on her toes and pecked my lips, then walked toward the shut office door.

“Addison.” She turned to face me, though in her eye was an odd impatience. “Addison, what *was* that? You seemed…broken.”

Her eyes held mine, but for half-a-second they flicked upward, above my head. “I can’t talk about it right now. I promise. We’ll talk about it tonight. Just not right now.”

Then she was gone, out the door and behind the bar, relieving the last shift and preparing to serve. Confused, I went to my small locker and got the watch I wore for work. It was so fancy and expensive—to a college kid, that is—that I never wanted to wear it outside the hotel, nor move it from place to place, in case I somehow lost it. I checked that my own clothes and hair were in order and went to the door. With my hand on the knob, a thought came to me, and I turned to see what Addison might have been looking at above my head. What I saw was not in the least revealing: the vacant black eye of the CCTV security camera that faced the door. Its little red light blinked at me six times before I’d turned the knob and left the room and the happening stuck within it.

Time slipped by like a wet eel. Addison and I didn’t talk much—not to each other, in any case. I’d been trained as a bartender by that point, and could more than hold down the fort. So, we smiled, shook drinks, and made conversation like two arms of a well-oiled machine.

“Fighting any cool cases?” Tanner Warren and old Mister Wellers had just sat down. I was ready with lemon-spiked waters, and a neat double of Scotch for the latter.

“We’re suing the ass off a group of hippies,” Tanner said. “They claim a chemical plant is dumping refuse nitric acid into a river. Dead fish and squirrels or something.” He tapped huge fingers into the bar-top. “High West on the rocks. And make it a fuckin’ triple.”  

I nodded and poured.

“We’ll get ‘em for damages,” Mr. Wellers said. “They keep throwing buckets of river-water on people.” He shook his head, then hauled up his Scotch with an old, shaking hand. “Shut down two blocks of 6^(th) Avenue right in front of the plant’s corporate office. These damn kids don’t have any respect.”

“Jesus,” I said. “Hope you win.” I didn’t. “What are you guys doing here in The Springs, then?”

“My lovely nephew,” Tanner Warren began, frustrated and sarcastic, “*shining* *gem* that he is, got himself into a spat with some girl a decade his junior. She says he drugged her in a bar.”

My eyebrows went up. “Brandon? No way.” There most assuredly was a way. Brandon Warren had graced my bar with his presence on a few occasions. I had heard his stories.  

“That’s what I said.” Tanner breathed out whiskey fumes, and I tried not to pull away. “He’s rough around the edges—that’s his father’s fault—but he’s a good kid.” Ice tinkled as he swigged from his drink. I’d have to get him another pour in perhaps ten minutes.

I heard Mrs. “Call me Catherine” Mayhew call my name from the other end of the bar and moved off with an “Excuse me, gentlemen.” She wanted the special cocktail I’d come up with for her, as well as to tell me all about what her sons and grandsons were up to.

Rich came in twenty minutes late—perks of being the newly promoted bar manager—and got to checking inventory. We all checked inventory, of course; the more minds you had on it, the less likely it was for someone to fuck up. Out of Lagavulin Sixteen Year when old Mister Wellers, senior partner at *Wellers, Lorraine & Warren*, wants his fix? Miss out on a fifty-dollar tip. Only an ounce left of Disaronno Amaretto? Can’t make Catherine Mayhew her favorite cocktail? Lose a \*hundred-\*dollar tip, and prettily flashed dentures.

Do I sound bitter? Shit, I just read it back: I do. I’m really not, but recalling this stuff isn’t exactly fun; nor, in hindsight, were the people I served as classy as their money and suits might make them seem. Unless being callous reprobates is synonymous with class.

In any case, Rich seemed in a bad mood that day. Not like Addison was, but when I said hi to him, he barely even nodded, then rushed past me, tracking snow and a bitter-cold puff of winter. His concert-black suit, normally impeccable—clean as a whistle and ironed to planar perfection—hung slightly wrinkled on him, and above the sticking snow at the hem of his pant legs, there was the hint of a reddish-brown dust. I only noticed it because of the more generally disparate state of his clothing and manner, but the fact he hadn’t cleaned it off stuck in my head. Rich was always obsessively clean; he detailed his car weekly; he was a tyrant when it came to bar management; his apartment was spotless and organized; and his body and mind seemed always in a similar state. Down to every hair on his head, my friend was constantly tidy and ordered, and it had served him well.

But in the past few months, he had been acting strangely. Chiefly toward myself and Addison. He was cool to us, if not cold, and he seemed far away. The three of us hadn’t done anything together: hadn’t gone on any gambling trips or had movie nights or even run the gambit of the other bars in town. I hadn’t seen Rich’s funny and awkward little sister, hadn’t asked after his family, nor him after mine. We hadn’t shared anything that friends share; and to that point, I hadn’t noticed these things, not with Addison filling my life. But I thought on them then.

For two hours, Rich stayed in the bar office with the door closed. And when he did come out, it wasn’t to sling drinks with us—something he usually did more for the fun of it than because we were ever truly slammed—but only to call Addison into the office. I heard while shaking a guest’s third gin martini in an hour, Rich’s raised voice. None of the guests at the bar seemed to hear it, or find interest if they did. I didn’t catch any words from it, but only a tone. It was an odd sound, all the normal pep and invitation gone. It was dead serious, but punitive rather than truly wrathful. It both frightened and confused me further. The thing causing Addison’s tears could have indeed been something work related, but if that was the case, what exactly was it? And why wouldn’t she talk to me about it?

I planned, as a man, to question Rich when he and Addison came out. Fuck him being my direct overseer and boss; he was being mean to the girl who let me take her respectfully to pound town. That’s serious shit. I meant to usher him back into the office and give him a piece of my mind, maybe even get in his face. When they came out, however, Addison’s face pale and drawn, Rich’s flushed red, he again rushed right past me with his coat, gloves, and scarf on and flew out the door as if he were the wind himself. The only guests to take any notice were those sitting on leather couches and chairs in the lobby proper; none at the bar were quite sober enough.

When I asked Addison what had happened, she said it was nothing, just something she’d missed and gotten chewed out for.

“Bullshit, it’s nothing!” I told her in tones hushed enough to be unheard. “Something’s going on here. Rich isn’t like that.” Addison only peered up at me, her eyes telling me everything and nothing at once, then pushed past me with a bottle in each hand and continued her work. In a bit of a huff—as if I had been the one to get yelled at—I took a break and went after Rich.

The cold buffeted me as I brisked past the valet, already worsening from when I’d parked, and the burgeoning darkness somehow surprised me, reminding me just how quickly the days now fell away. I jogged to the south side of the hotel and turned the corner. A parking lot lay to the southwest of The Gold Exchange, hidden behind and sharing its space with an office building. Staff and well-off guests parked or had their cars parked there. I squinted and saw the hint of a pant leg vanishing around the corner of the office building. I ran after him, rounded the corner, then sped up in seeing that it was indeed Rich, stepping at a good clip toward parked, snow-gathering cars. In a moment, I gained on him, unsure of what I was going to do, what I was going to say. I reached out and snatched at the shoulder of his suit coat. He stopped and turned cooly toward me.

“Hey,” I said, my heart beating hard. “Where are you going? What happened back there?”

“I have things to deal with, Devin,” Rich said. He tried to turn away from me. I grabbed his arm.

“What the fuck are you talking about? Why were you yelling at Addison?”

Rich pulled his arm sharply away, and I felt my frigid fingers snap together on nothing. “Don’t pry, Devin. It’s above your station. Go back and handle the bar.” He turned and began off.

Red anger rose in me, and I followed, yet again grabbing him and beginning to speak. Before I knew just what was happening, Rich had turned on his heel and shoved me with both his arms. I didn’t have time to plant my feet and went down half on my arm, half on my ass. My teeth clicked together, and when I looked up, Rich had already weaved himself into the maze of cars. Gone.

After a moment, I stood up and brushed snow off myself. Too much had already melted into my clothes and was re-freezing. I returned to the bar a defeated and newly chilled man. Addison wasn’t there. The guests were getting antsy, and I tended to them, overly conscious of the dark spots of dampness at my elbow and left shoulder. When I had it under control, I asked a regular where Addison had gone. He said the head of staff, Marion Grueber, had come down and asked for her. She’d been gone ten minutes.

She returned fifteen minutes later, her mood seemingly much improved, where mine had been and still was in the gutter. I pulled her into the office and tried to get her to tell me what had happened, what *was* happening, but she shut me out. She said everything was fine—that she had messed something up bad, but that they’d resolved it. She told me I shouldn’t have gone after Rich, that he was under a great lot of stress. I knew there was something more. I knew that she was lying to me, but short of medieval torture, she wouldn’t budge, so I worked alongside her, my mind spinning with something, *coiling* with something; and when our shift ended, she stayed behind, claiming she needed to finish something up.

That was just the beginning, just the fucking start of it; and I find myself now—recalling it in a way I never have—thinking that it’s a pretty Podunk beginning. God, do I wish for Podunk…. From now on, I’ll date everything—more for my own organization and sanity than anything else.  

*December 22****^(nd)****, 2019:*

 

I called Addison to take her out to lunch. I’d found a great spot downtown for gyros and other Mediterranean, and I wanted to try it. I didn’t ask her anything about the previous night over the phone—I didn’t want to overload her—but I could hear in her voice that she was doing better. We met, and she explained that a shipment of liquor had been first delayed (her fault, supposedly) then delivered to the wrong address (supposedly also her fault). Then, when it did come, and she saw what it contained, she had almost come entirely unglued. She’d ordered the wrong things, and a whole fucking lot of the wrong things. A month’s-pay worth of the wrong things. She’d found this out yesterday, explaining her distress and anxiety, and Rich had yelled at her when he himself saw the mistake. But he hadn’t been truly mean, and she was going to keep her job. It was all water under the bridge, all in the past—if not very distantly so. A whole lot of excuses got thrown my way, and Addison was so God damned pretty that part of me believed it all and let it lie. Another part, however, the part that had asked and asked and asked her what was wrong and received only deflection, the part that had seen her flick her eyes to the CCTV camera in downtrodden fear, the part that had seen and felt Rich’s cold anger, smelled a couple shovel-fulls of bullshit at least.

I accepted what she said, but inside I wondered, then wondered more.

As it was one of our days off, we spent the rest of it together. We went to a museum downtown after lunch, then walked around aimlessly talking. Then we had dinner. Then a movie. Then coffee at our favorite spot. Then we snuggled together in my apartment, out of the cold. For a time, I thought nothing of bartending, or the hotel, or any drama that might be going on within it. I can’t really describe Addison; no words can actually put you into my head when I was with her. The closest I think I can get is that she was the puzzle piece missing from my box, and that I couldn’t go on without her. She fulfilled me, made the world itself drop away as if it had never existed.

I wish only that she could do that for me again.

*December 23****^(rd)****, 2019:*

 

Our shift that day went off without a hitch. Everything outward had gone right back to normal. Addison was as cheerful and funny as ever; Rich, as well as calling the previous day to apologize profusely to me, returned to his standard prim buoyancy and cheer; and the ‘vibrations’ around the staff and the guests and the hotel itself seemed more Christmasy than they had before, even sacrosanct. The only disparate thing in that place was me.

I peered at every security camera with a sliver of an eye and marked down their locations in my mind. I wasn’t sure what exactly I was doing, nor *why* I was doing it, but it seemed right. There were six cameras in what I considered my immediate vicinity: the bar, lobby, and valet and guest entrance. Each blinking light reminded me of the scene two days before, and each pounded into me the wrongness of it, where my friends’ behavior attempted to sweep it away.

Around five-o'clock, an hour or so into our shift, Rich went out to smoke. I waved him a hearty, half-sarcastic goodbye while I washed out a shaker tin, and when he was gone, I peered to my left, toward Addison. She was grinning and talking with Tara Lorraine and her husband while stirring up a couple Manhattans for them. There were only two other guests at the bar, and a few stragglers otherwise in our sphere of responsibility. I had time, though perhaps not much, to do what I needed to do. The skin on the back of my neck prickling, I dried my hands and adjourned silently to the bar office, while the couple still held Addison’s attention.

In the office, I glanced at the blinking red eye of the camera, thought internally: *Fuck you*, then went first to my locker. I opened it—obscuring the camera’s view of me—rustled some things around, dug in my pockets, placed my phone and wallet into it, then took them out again and placed them back against my thighs. I shut the locker, peered at the shut office door, then took in a breath. It calmed me slightly.

I slipped behind the bar manager’s desk, knowing the camera saw me and not caring. There was a calendar and a sheet tacked beside it for people to put in notes, order requests, and the like. Even if someone did watch the camera, or perhaps the recordings, my going back there would not seem altogether strange. I hoped. What they could not see, what *would* get me into trouble, was me peering into Rich’s personal working notebook. Luckily, the desk itself was far enough back to be out of the camera’s eyeshot. Again, I hoped.

I’d seen him take it out and write in it from time to time, and I knew vaguely what he wrote in it. I was looking for proof of the story he and Addison seemed to have spun. Surely there would be notation: *Wrong order,* then the list of items to be returned and probably a list of the correct things to order.

The drawer where Rich kept it was not locked. I swallowed once more, then drew out the notebook. The front of it was black leather, embossed with the hotel’s insignia and the intended use: *Bar: Q3 & Q4*. I opened it. I felt insane, and I’m sure I looked insane, alternately glancing at the office door and down at the pages, flipping through them with a shaking hand. The book was made for maximum organization: each left-hand page had a weekly calendar with multiple squares for each day of the week; each right-hand page held a space of blank lines for notes and scribblings. Each book was meant for half a year, this the second of 2019, and nearly all the pages were filled. Shaking harder, I took the book in hand and flipped the pages with my thumb until I found unsullied space. There were two weeks left in the year: four organization pages blank, then five more for end-of-year notes.

I ran my finger across the dates, from the twentieth, Friday, to the twenty-third, today. There was nothing out of the ordinary yet, nothing to confirm or deny what I’d been told. But in there being nothing, didn’t that prove that it *had* indeed been a fake story? Rich’s other notes were extensive, his tiny neat script filling and nearly overtaking each little box. There was no way he wouldn’t have noted down an incorrect shipment of that size and apparent importance. I bent my head into one hand, massaging my temples.

“What the fuck am I doing?” I breathed. I was about to close the book while I still had plausible deniability, but something in me couldn’t leave it alone. It didn’t make sense, and that pissed me off. I flipped the page, and there I saw it. Under December 31*^(st)* in a fancy script lay one word and a symbol among blank crème paper. The word was *Hinen’nahash*; and the symbol next to it seemingly a distant cousin of a cursive ‘Z’, all curls and loops. And though that was the first thing to come to mind, it was decidedly *not* any letter of the English language, not even a hastily scratched one. The symbol was much larger than any other writing and looked to have been carefully and expertly drawn, and by an intent hand. As well, there lay three dots above the swirls, like an ellipse. My finger drew near the symbol, and it seemed I could feel each little atom of the paper it stained.

“Hinen’nahash,” I said to myself, low and discrete, as if it were a secret thing. I stared at the symbol, and the word—or perhaps the name—floated back and forth in my mind. I heard the rapid thump of my heart in my ears, but felt it in my entire body, as if my blood pressure had sky-rocketed. My hands pulsed, and my head ached. All in my mind was a liminal image of coldness—dark blue-grey sky shot through with tendrils of black cloud, leafless trees shooting like spikes from an otherwise barren plain of unmarred snow—and the sound, *Hinen’nahash*, from a soft hissing voice outside of myself.

“Devin!” The voice, near a shout, yanked me out of that paralysis, and the world came rushing back in to fill a void that had been growing. Addison stood in the doorway, her eyes like fire. Now with my attention, she flicked her head back and looked out toward the bar. Her voice had been perhaps too loud. “Can you get out here and help me? We just got slammed.” My finger still sat on the page. It felt numb. I swallowed, only staring back at her, dreading the question of just what I was doing in here at the bar manager’s desk.

“Sorry…I’ll be right out.” Words felt odd. My mind and my tongue worked together well enough, like two parts of a machine, but the words themselves, the act of enunciating a flow of vibrations, cutting them off into syllables to be interpreted, seemed alien.

She was gone then, and for five seconds I only sat and stared at the closed door, my eyes unfocused. A computer monitor sat at the front of the desk. Had she seen the notebook, my finger on its page? Mechanically, I closed the book and placed it back in its drawer.

I went back to work.

I drove home.

I dreamed of a snake twining around and around the world, squeezing it for a crimson juice.

1pi6waa,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pi6waa,My review of….. Lataffa kamrah qawha 🫣,"Greetings my fellow esoteric fragrance community redditors. Ik everyone and their grandma has done a lataffa kamrah Qawha review, it’s probably one of the most saturated things on here.

Nonetheless it’s my first…… ever fragrance that I’ve purchased and I wanted to contribute. So here it goes:

As well all know one of the essential pillars of being perceived positively by other people is smelling good. Having a dope smell makes girls (or femboys Ig if you’re into that) remember you.

# Opening

Honestly the opening is probably the worst part of this otherwise lovely fragrance. It opens with a really harsh synthetic coffee note. To me it’s too overpowering, kinda in a similar way to how the axe body spray the bisexual kid in your gym class would wear is.

Luckily, after about 20–30 minutes, the synthetic edge calms down and it becomes much smoother, sweeter, and more wearable. It smells kinda like what I would imagine a really successful bakery in Istanbul to smell like.

# Performance

This seriously performs better than the Soviet counter offensive at Stalingrad. It’s insane how long the smell of this thing will sit on your clothes. Imo besides smelling good this is the most important metric of a fragrance, and this is definitely where Qawha comes in clutch.

# Compliments

Since I started wearing this I have gotten compliments, although I think often times compliments on you smelling good more has to do with the general way you present yourself rather than purely the smell. I think this smell has an appeal to about 85-90% of all people.

# Conclusion

Overall I’m very happy with my purchase. Given that it only cost me about 30€ I’d say that it is unequivocally one of the best value fragrances you can get your hands on. So overall, it’s a 9/10",0,1765285504.0,FragranceStories,0,0.5,False

The bell on the entrance to The Groove record store rang, as Leo Peterson walked in. Leo removed his sunglasses as he entered, and his eyes adjusted to the dimly lit store. He could smell the familiar aroma of coffee in the air, and he felt a sudden craving for it. The place reminded him of his childhood days playing in his dad’s studio, with records everywhere you looked. A smile was on his face as he approached the counter, where the owner of the establishment sat. Her nametag read “Eleanor”.

“Good evening, young man. Can I help you find anything?” greeted Eleanor.

“Hi, yes. I’m looking for a rare recording. I’ve looked just about everywhere for it. It’s a recording of a live session by jazz artist Joe Hook. It’s supposed to have a saxophone solo that has a sound like nobody has heard before. Any chance you might  know what I’m talking about?” 

“Well, it’s nice to meet you too. You seem to know exactly what you want, don’t you?” Eleanor said, with a touch of annoyance.

“Well, yes, I am looking for a specific record. I was told that this store had a lot of vintage records, and even some rare copies.” Leo responded.

“I know which record you’re talking about. ‘Hooked on Joe’ Live at Oak Hall. Only 50 copies made, most are in museums. What does a young man like you want with it? You don’t exactly look like a huge jazz fan.”

Leo indeed did not look like your average jazz fan. Leo wore a silver blazer over a designer polo, with what looked to be leather slacks and slicked back hair.

“I’m actually an electronic music producer, and believe it or not, I am a fan of jazz. I’m trying to incorporate the spirit of jazz into my music. Continue its legacy.”

“Electronic music producer, huh? So you have a computer that makes music for you? Never bothered to learn an instrument?” Eleanor said somewhat rudely. If she was just teasing Leo, he couldn’t tell.

“The computer doesn't just “make the music”, it’s a tool like any instrument. It takes skill and patience.” said Leo.

“I know your type. Guys like you are always coming in here looking for rare records to take home and rip off and call their own. Am I far off here?”

“Look, ma’am, I’m not trying to steal or rip off anything. It’s called sampling. Credit is always given to the original artist.”

“Justify it however you want. People like you are always trying to capitalize on the talent of others to prop yourselves up. It’s sad, really.”

“Have I offended you in some way? I don’t know why you’re talking to me like this. All I want is to buy a record, isn’t that the whole point of your business?” Leo questioned.

“This isn’t just a business to me, young man, it’s a passion. Music is the soul of culture. It’s deeply tied to emotion and spirit. It’s meant to be shared, but not to be whored around. The experience of creating music is the same as pouring out your inner self. Using the music of others to create some Frankenstein's monster of a “track” is just disrespectful.” 

Eleanor now seemed visibly upset. Tears were welling in her eyes and her voice was cracking.

“I wholeheartedly disagree, ma’am. I mean no disrespect, but quite the opposite. My music is a tribute to artists of the past. A celebration of the soul of music that shaped our culture. By sampling the music, I feel that I expose the original artist to a new audience. Like you said, it is to be shared.” Leo maintained a friendly tone despite Eleanor’s irritation.

“But you’re taking a classic medium and reducing it to just ones and zeroes. There’s no soul in it. You just can’t replicate the feeling you get listening to an old vinyl. You can almost hear the life in the recording. Coming from a computer, it’s just a copy, a facsimile. A fake.”

“Let me ask you this. What about music on the radio? Do you think that is disrespectful?” Leo asked.

“Well of course not. Music has been played on the radio for almost as long as we’ve had it. That’s how music is shared.”

“But they’re converting the music into radio waves, or “ones and zeroes” to transmit the sound. Is the soul of the music lost in that conversion? Is the radio playing a “facsimile” of the sounds soulless?”

Eleanor’s scowl softened for a moment. She appeared to really ponder the comparison. Leo offered a smile during the silence.

“Okay, you may have a point there. However, I still disagree with what you call “sampling”, and cannot in good conscience let you have such a rare vinyl to sully. I’m sorry.”

“Wait, so you have it?”

Eleanor quickly looked down. She looked uncomfortable, like she was caught. Leo’s friendly smile turned into a smirk.

“You do have it. Listen, ma’am, I promise you I only have honorable intentions. I want more people to know about Joe Hook. He was legendary. But it’s so hard to find recordings of his best work. The younger generations deserve to hear it, in a way that is accessible to them.”

“Son, I said no. End of story. I have a duty to protect the legacy of these artists.” Eleanor stood firm.

Leo sighed. He had finally found someone with a copy, and she wouldn’t even CONSIDER selling it to him. “I never should have told her I was a music producer. Those old hippies are always gatekeeping.” He thought.

“Well, I’m sorry to have wasted your time. Would you mind if I grabbed a cup of coffee on the way out? It smells heavenly.”

Eleanor smiled for a moment. “Oh, sure. It’s just Folger’s but it’s my favorite. Help yourself. There’s cream and sugar too.”

“Oh! My dad always made Folger’s! He’d always make a pot before starting work in his studio. I always had so much fun hanging out with him while he played, and that coffee smell always reminds me of it!” Leo said.

“Your father is a musician?” Eleanor asked, her interest piqued.

“Well, was. He died a couple years ago. He made a few records, they didn’t sell great, but his music was amazing. His name was Phil Peterson. I doubt you’ve heard of him though.”

Eleanor's eyes were wide. She tried to speak, but stammered for a few seconds.

“Y-... you’re Phil Peterson’s son? “Heaven’s Song” Phil Peterson? “Blue River”? That’s… your dad?”

Leo smiled big. “Yep, that was my pops. He taught me everything about music. He inspired my passion.”

“Oh my gosh, I’m so sorry for talking to you that way. Oh, I’m sorry. Look, I really don’t like to be like that, but I do feel very strongly about the integrity of music. But I shouldn’t have been so disrespectful to you. I’m honestly surprised you stayed so friendly. I didn’t deserve it.”

“I do admire your conviction, but I appreciate the apology, and no hard feelings. You had good intentions, I’m sure.” Leo said.

“I’ll be honest with you. Phil Peterson is one of my favorite artists. “Heaven’s Song”  got me through the roughest time of my life. The melody is one of the most beautiful things I’ve ever heard, and his voice, well, there’s a reason it’s called “Heaven's song”. I have every record he ever released. I truthfully cannot believe I’m talking to his son right now.” Eleanor admitted.

With that bit of info, Leo suddenly had an idea. He couldn't hide his glee at the thought, and smiled a big, goofy grin.

“Every record he released, huh? Yeah, you’re definitely a fan. I’m sure he would have loved to meet you. He never really seeked fame, but his few dedicated fans were the world to him. Myself included.” Leo reminisced.

“Would you mind if I put one of his records on? You know, as a tribute?” Eleanor asked.

Leo’s smile got bigger. “Absolutely! But if you don’t  mind, I have one of my personal records of his in my car, I always keep it with me as it’s my favorite. Could we play that one?”

“Sure, but whichever one it is, I probably have it too. Which one is it?”

“I’ll surprise you.” Said Leo, barely holding back his glee.

Leo practically ran outside. The sun was completely down now. Leo’s car was parked right outside, in the small, otherwise empty parking lot. Leo wondered where Eleanor’s car was. He opened his rear car door and lifted the seat. Under the seat was a box labeled “Pops”. Leo grabbed it and headed back inside.

When Leo was back in the store, he saw Eleanor setting up the turntable. Her setup was retro, but well taken care of and high quality. Leo felt even better about his plan.

Leo sat at a table and opened the box. It was filled with memorabilia of his dad, as well as a couple records. He pulled one of the records out. The sleeve was pure white and only had the words Phil Peterson on it. The vinyl itself had no label.

“Play this one. It’s my favorite. I’m sure you’re going to love it too.” Leo offered.

“I’m sure I’ve already heard it a million times, but absolutely. Let’s see how quickly I can tell which one it is.” Eleanor smiled.

Leo smiled back. “Yeah, let’s see.”

Eleanor carefully placed the record on the player. She gently lowered the needle onto the vinyl and the distinctive sound of crackling vinyl filled the silence before the music began.

When the music started, though, Eleanor’s smile faded. The melody was one she had heard before, but it was not one she knew from Phil Peterson’s catalogue. It was a sample. Phil’s voice, singing an original song, harmonized beautifully with the sampled melody. 

“What is this? Did you make this? Why are you making me listen to this?” Tears welled in her eyes.

“This is the last thing he recorded before he passed. He’s the one who showed me how to do this. How to sample. He’s the whole reason I do this. This… is his legacy.”

Eleanor sniffled, then collected herself. She seemed torn.

“I don’t know what to think anymore. I just… Why have I never heard this?”

“He never released it.  He felt the genre was too different from the rest of his catalogue, and dedicated this album entirely to me. We worked on it together. It’s quite honestly my fondest memory of him.”

“It’s.. it’s beautiful. Those lyrics, I can feel his pain.”

“Keep listening.”

Eleanor continued to listen to the song. The lyrics, while melancholy at first, shifted with the last verse to a message of hope and love. This part was the part that Leo most associated with his father.

Eleanor once again began crying. “That was so beautiful. I wish I could listen to it forever. Thank you.”

“Eleanor, I’d like you to have it. I’m not asking for anything in return. All I want to do is share his music with you.”

“Oh my gosh, no! I couldn’t possibly take this from you! This means so much to you, and I’m just some record shop lady who was rude to you 5 minutes ago!” Eleanor protested.

“Nonsense! Do you really think this is the only copy I have? Please, take it. I know you’ll appreciate it.”

Eleanor was still softly sobbing. While the record started playing the next song, she ran to the back room.

Leo sat in his chair and waited for her to return, tapping his foot to the very familiar tune. As he waited, he looked around the shop. He couldn’t see one album or artist he’d consider “mainstream”. This lady was the real deal.

Eleanor returned holding a record in a black plastic sleeve. She sat next to Leo.

“Again, I’m sorry about earlier. You’ve been nothing but lovely to me, and I treated you like some kinda sellout. I cannot take your father’s record from you, but I would be comfortable trading this for it. It would only be right.”

Eleanor gave the record to Leo. Leo accepted the deal graciously and took the sleeved record.

“I’ll tell you what. Let’s just listen to this one together, after my dad’s album is over. We both get to hear something new that is special to the other person.”

“I would like that very much.”

Eleanor and Leo listened to the two albums and finished their coffee. They talked for hours, reminiscing about their favorite artists, songs, and  music in general. At about 11 p.m. Leo finally decided it was time to leave.

“Thank you, Eleanor. I had a lovely time, and will remember this night for a long time. Oh, and by the way, if you are still feeling uncomfortable with my sampling the song, I promise you I will not.”

“Actually,you’ve changed my mind. You, and your father. You’ve really opened my eyes. Sample the song, if you want to, you have my blessing.”

Leo smiled, and opened the door to leave.

2) Yogabar plant protein isolate 
3) Superyou Yeast protein 

TLDR; Superyou is best out of 3.

Not a sponsored post.


Protein content:


Nakpro is trustified, but subsequent batch testing showerd lower protein than claimed.

Yogabar couldn't find any lab test reports on YouTube.

 Superyou is trustified.

Taste:


Superyou(coffee)>Nakpro(vanilla)>Yogabar(chocolate)

Nakpro is a little too sweet. Superyou is very balanced. And dare I say tastiest out of 3. 

Mixability:


Superyou=Nakpro>>>Yogabar

I use a blender to mix.

Yogabar leaves a huge fucking clump at bottom of the glass.

Nakpro mixability had no issues as far as I remember,
 It's the first one out of 3 I tried, so my memory is a little rusty in this regard. 

Muscle growth:


Can't comment. Couldn't/didn't track this.

Price:


Superyou>Yogabar>nakpro 

Value for money:


Nakpro/Superyou>>>yogabar


Digestability:


Can't comment. I don't usually have issues in digesting these. I can say that Superyou's taste made it easiest to drink out of three. 



Did I miss any parameter? Let me know. Also share your experience with different vegan proteins. 

In total I liked Superyou the best. Albeit expensive than other two, I'm Willing to pay for the better taste.  


I am Willing to try soy protein next. By nutrabox I think. 

Cosmix is expensive but I might try it too. Just to see if the taste is too good to make me shift from Superyou. Right now not feeling the need. 

Until any issues arise/I find a cheaper tastier alternative I'm sticking to Superyou. ",2,1765285327.0,VeganIndia,1,0.75,False

But I do monitor emails throughout the day in case anything urgent comes in but, as people increasingly use DMs instead of emails (including for non-urgent things), any expectation of immediate responses to email is becoming less and less rational/defendable if anything were to severely break.

This includes emails to myself both work/personal emails, which almost always get ""punted""/snoozed until tomorrow to be ""processed"" over morning coffee.

And the impetus for this post was that I had a ""I didn't have to drink alcohol and eat wings last night"" insight this morning that I wanted to capture, especially because it has become a pattern.

**TL;DR: I was bleeding money with $160K in debt and no idea where $20K/month was going. Here's what actually stopped the hemorrhaging (spoiler: it wasn't cutting out coffee).**

# The Real Reason Your Budget Fails

* It's not you—most budgets die from neglect, not overspending
* You build this perfect system, then life happens and you forget it exists
* A budget sitting in a spreadsheet does absolutely nothing for you

# My ""Oh Shit"" Moment

* Finally aggregated every account, subscription, and debt into one dashboard
* Couldn't unsee the damage once it was all laid out
* That uncomfortable visibility became the catalyst for actual change

# What Actually Worked (After Years of Failure)

* Started using **Monarch Money** for both personal and business finances
* **Auto-categorization:** No more manual entry hell
* **Single dashboard:** All my financial chaos in one place
* **Goal tracking that doesn't suck:** Visual progress bars hit different
* **Smart alerts:** Catches you before you wreck yourself
* They have a free trial (7 days usually)

# Day One Action Plan (No BS)

* **First:** Link literally everything—checking, savings, credit cards, loans, business accounts, all of it
* **Second:** Let it analyze your last 90 days automatically
* **Third:** Start broad with categories: Housing, Food, Transport, Fun Money, Debt

# Where I Actually Cut Deep

* Found $400/month in forgotten subscriptions and killed them
* Refinanced my car loan, saved $300/month instantly
* Put hard caps on variable spending categories
* Wasn't about living miserably—just cutting the stupid leaks

# Timeline (Being Realistic Here)

* **Month 1:** You'll start catching yourself before dumb purchases
* **Months 2-3:** Habits form, confidence builds, less panic
* **Month 6:** Everything just feels different—calm instead of constant anxiety

# Mindset Shift That Made It Click

* Budgeting isn't about what you can't buy—it's about funding what you actually want
* The numbers don't judge you, they just show reality
* You're not restricting yourself, you're directing your resources on purpose
* Every dollar you control is a dollar working for your goals

# Hot Take: The Latte Thing is Garbage Advice

* The big wins are: Rent/mortgage, car payments, debt interest rates, lifestyle inflation on major stuff
* Everyone obsesses over $5 coffees while hemorrhaging $500/month on car payments
* Fix your housing and transportation first—that's where the real money is

# Myths I Believed (That Kept Me Broke)

* **Myth:** ""Budgets = no fun"" → **Reality:** Budgets fund the fun that matters
* **Myth:** ""Need perfect discipline"" → **Reality:** Need a system that works when you're lazy
* **Myth:** ""More income = no budget needed"" → **Reality:** Bad habits scale with income
* **Myth:** ""Budgets are rigid"" → **Reality:** Mine changes monthly based on what's happening

# Start Here If You're Ready

* **Get the full picture:** Connect everything, face the music
* **Give it 30 days:** Just track and observe, no judgment
* **Attack the big stuff first:** Housing, cars, debt—not your Starbucks habit
* **Be patient with yourself:** This is hard, but it's worth it

1pi6se9,https://www.reddit.com/r/MenRoleModel/comments/1pi6se9/chaos_your_launchpad/,Chaos: Your Launchpad.,"My ""business partner"" – my best friend since kindergarten – ghosted me right before our popup bakery launch. Took our shared seed money, the recipes I developed, and mocked my dreams in a group chat with our investors. Humiliation was a gut punch. I stood there, flourdusted, with a dozen raw cookie sheets and no one to sell to. The scarcity of time and funds hit hard. My parents, our initial authority figures, just said, ""See? We told you so.""
For a second, I wanted to quit. Then I remembered Artemisia I of Caria. This Persian admiral, facing certain defeat at Salamis, rammed an allied ship to clear her escape route and trick the Greeks into thinking she was on their side. Xerxes, from his throne, admired her audacious cunning, believing she’d sunk a Greek vessel. She escaped, reputation enhanced, while the rest of the fleet crumbled.
I didn't ram my friend's car, but I pivoted. Hard. Used my last cash to buy a single espresso machine. Offered free coffee with every cookie, cash only, for anyone who reviewed me online. Overnight, I wasn't a bakery, I was ""The Grind & Crumble,"" an indie coffee cart with the best damn cookies.
The entrepreneurial spirit isn't about fair play or reciprocal loyalty. It's about surviving the wreckage your socalled allies create, and making a brutal, strategic move to turn their betrayal into your savage win.

According to the official manual, the **O** position is **Coffee Xmode (brew priority)** and the **I** position is **Steam Xmode**.

However, I’ve watched several YouTube videos where people claim that on the V2 units, Lelit *reversed* these modes but didn’t update the documentation. I commented on a few of those videos and multiple users said the same thing - that their machines behave opposite to what the manual shows.

I tried to dig deeper online, and it seems like some V2 batches may have been shipped with the switch wiring flipped, which makes this whole thing more confusing. Unsure how legit this claim is.

Before I start testing blindly:  
Can any Mara X V2 owners confirm which position is actually Brew Priority on *your* machine?  
Does your machine follow the manual, or is it reversed?

Would love some clarity from people who have verified the behaviour on their own units.

Heading to York for a weekend and want a no-faff plan that actually fits in 2 days? I’ve put together a **realistic York 2-day itinerary** that covers the big hitters *and* sneaks in the National Railway Museum without turning it into a military operation.

It’s built for first-timers who want a mix of history, chocolate, pubs and easy walking, not a tick-box dash.

**What’s in the 2-day plan:**

**Day 1: Old streets, Minster views & city walls**

* Morning: The Shambles and Shambles Market for crooked streets, coffee and snacks
* Afternoon: York Minster, a stretch of the city walls, Museum Gardens and St Mary’s Abbey
* Evening: Riverside walk, classic pub / restaurant dinner, optional ghost walk if you like being gently traumatised 👻

**Day 2: Chocolate, Vikings & trains**

* Morning: Breakfast at a tea room, Barley Hall and York’s Chocolate Story
* Afternoon: A good chunk of time at the **National Railway Museum** (honestly brilliant, even if you’re not a train nerd), with the option to add JORVIK or The York Dungeon
* Evening: River Ouse cruise, then up to Clifford’s Tower for views and a final dinner in town

It’s all walkable from a central hotel, with notes on budget, where to stay, what things roughly cost, and what to tweak if you’re travelling with kids or you hate stairs.

There’s also a **free custom map** included so you can see everything laid out and not spend half your trip arguing with Google Maps.

1pi6r4y,https://www.reddit.com/r/ROCD/comments/1pi6r4y/advice_on_how_to_break_the_rocd_cycle/,Advice on how to break the ROCD cycle!,"Hi fellow ROCD sufferers! I would like to share a helpful piece of information/advice I saw on Instagram and a daily routine i adopt when i'm spiraling. The advice I saw was a helpful reminder for me as I've been going through a bit of a spike recently and am trying to get to a better place mentally. It's a long read but I really believe it is actual practical and helpful information, which can be hard to find on this sub between all the reassurance seeking.

  
So what the person in the video basically says, is that **in order to break harmful patterns, you have to stop fighting them and create new healthier patterns**. Every time you focus on what you're trying to quit, you're reinforcing it. This is because **attention is activation**. Every time you think ''I don't want to ruminate/confess/seek reassurance (whatever your compulsion is)'', you reinforce it. You can't delete an old neural pathway, but you CAN create a new one and make it stronger than the old one.  Every time you ask yourself ''how do i break this pattern'', you are making it stronger because you are firing those neurons. What fires together, wires together. Basically, when you are telling yourself not to spiral, your brain hears ''spiral''.

So **what DOES work**? focusing on what you want to build instead. Start asking yourself positive, helpful questions. So not ''how do I stop ruminating?'' but ''how can I be present?'', ''how do I honour my own needs?'', ''what small action can I take to feel more grounded?'' The more you fire these neurons and the more you practice this, the more you wire them. In turn, the old neural pathways weaken. For example, when you notice yourself ruminating or having intrusive thoughts, instead of saying to yourself ''I have to stop ruminating'', try telling yourself ''I am noticing that I'm ruminating, can I return to the present instead? And feel my feet on the ground and notice the sounds and smells around me'', or ''I notice feelings of anxiety, where in my body do I feel them and can I do something for my body to soothe that feeling?''. 

Try implementing **healthy habits** that make you feel a bit more grounded (even if it's just a tiny little bit). The point is to get out of your head and into your body. For me this can be:

* Making a warm drink, especially ones with multiple steps, such as a matcha latte or a hot cocoa. It helps me to calmly and presently go through the steps and changes in temperature as well as smells are calming to the nervous system (e.g. holding a warm cup, smelling the drink, etc.)
* Doing pilates and rope jumping. Working out in a way that feels good for you is one of the best ways to get out of your head and into your body.
* Gentle stimulation, so not binging the new season of Stranger Things, but making a puzzle, doing a sudoku, colorbooks, etc. Anything that is slightly challenging but doesn't make it so that no thought can occur.
* Spending time outside and in nature. It's so so important to go outside and to get some fresh air, you can never go wrong with just going outside for a little while. Go for a walk!
* Seeing friends and family, not to talk about your relationship, but just to connect. Play a board game together, watch a film, go for a walk, go shopping, bake a cake, whatever feels safe and connected.

Look into **nervous system regulation**!!



I also have a **daily routine** for when I'm going through a spike, kind of like a first aid kit. This is what it looks like (I am currently unemployed but if you are employed you can skip the daytime routine or adjust it according to your schedule):

**Morning**

* Body anchor when I wake up (3-5 minutes): stretch or shake body, or splash water in my face and then a few deap breaths
* Orientation statement: ''I am not making any decisions about my relationship this morning.''
* Safe morning stimulations (10-15 minutes): Tea/coffee, light podcast or music, neutral journaling

**Daytime (switch zones every 45-90 minutes)**

* Zone 1: Safe stimulation: TV, podcasts, reading, cooking, music, drawing, puzzles
* Zone 2: Neutral engagement: mindful walk, yoga/stretching, chores, any workout
* Zone 3: Short stillness practice (5-10 minutes): sitting in silence, breathwork, meditation, body scan (whatever works for you)

it's good to cycle zones throughout the day and to mix stimulation and stillness, to train that muscle. The stillness practice is crucial!!

**Evening (30 minutes before bed)**

* Mental curfew: no relationship problem-solving after this time.
* Safe stimulation: relaxing poscast, ambient music, light TV, warm bath or shower
* Short stillness practice (5 min)
* Daily check in: ''what is my nervous system state: calm, anxious or mixed?'', ''what was one value-aligned action that I did today?'', ''what is one value-aligned action I want to focus on tomorrow?''

This routine doesn't have to be executed perfectly of course, I almost never manage to do that, but with a written routine you do have something to fall back on, a helpful and gentle framework. I have it in my notes on my phone and can pull it out whenever I need it. I use it as a ''detox program'' when I am going through a spike, usually i try to implement it for a set amount of time such as a week since it's easier to stick with a routine for a set amount of time than indefinitely.  

Throughout the day you always redirect your intrusive thoughts to the task at hand. It's perfectly normal to have intrusive thoughts but the point is to not start ruminating too much. Sometimes it takes a few minutes before you notice you are ruminating and that is totally normal and fine, just gently redirect your focus to the present moment. It's really about focus, the thoughts will always be there but you can still choose to **focus on something else** and just let the thoughts be. The key is to build healthy habits and mental resilience. It's not a miracle cure that will fix all your problems in a week but it CAN help you feel even 1% more calm and that's still better than staying in that rocd cycle. And the beautiful thing is, the more you practice it the easier it becomes. Once again, it is a muscle you train, like going to the gym.

  
No matter what, sitting inside scrolling on Reddit all day will not help you and it will not give you clarity. Even if it feels like you need to figure this out right now and you can't possibly do anything but think about your relationship and whether you need to leave etc. I promise you it's just a trick your brain is playing!  You can only heal from this by getting to a place of emotional regulation. I see so many people on this sub asking for reassurance day after day, and I know you want to get better, but this is not the way to do it, it will never get better if you keep asking for reassurance. Read that again and really let it sink in. Think about it, does it ever really get you to a place of healing? Or does it just give temporary relief? 

I've been dealing with ROCD for almost three years now and I know how difficult it can be to break the cycle, I'm still figuring out how to do it. The sooner you start, the better but it's never too late!

  
I wrote this post to show you that you do have agency in this and there is always something you can do for yourself to feel a bit better. You do have the ability to heal and to change! This is a very long post but I hope some of you will read it and find it helpful. Feel free to ask me any questions or send me a DM!

1pi6qs4,https://www.reddit.com/r/remotework/comments/1pi6qs4/did_i_accidentally_invent_the_worst_kind_of/,"Did I accidentally invent the worst kind of ""virtual open office"" for my team","

I have been remote since 2020 and honestly I like it. I live in a small town, my office is 3 hours away by train, and I am very much that person who works better in quiet with headphones and a hoodie. My team is spread across 4 time zones, we all get our stuff done, but we also all complained about feeling disconnected. About a year into remote I had what felt like a cute idea. I set up a Discord server called ""kitchen table"" and invited my closest coworkers. The idea was simple. If you felt lonely or stuck you could jump into a voice channel, leave your mic on if you wanted, chat for a few minutes, then just work with other people existing in the background. No agendas, no managers, no ""quick syncs"". At first it was amazing. Three or four of us would hop in most mornings, talk about our weekends or whatever disaster Jira ticket we had pulled, then go quiet and just type. Cameras were optional, half the time you would just hear someone making coffee. My productivity actually went up because I had a social outlet that wasnt a formal meeting.



Then, of course, management found out. Someone mentioned our ""cowork room"" in a retro and my manager asked for an invite, said it sounded like a great culture thing. I did not feel like I could say no. He joined once, liked it, then asked if he could share it in the bigger team channel. Again, I did not push back because it still felt harmless. Fast forward a few months and my cute little side server has turned into an unofficial requirement. My manager now posts in Slack at 9am like ""everyone hop in kitchen table for the day"" and we regularly have 10 plus people in there. Cameras are still technically optional, but if you do not turn yours on you get the ""hey everything ok"" DM. It has turned into this weird always on showroom. People feel like they have to look busy because the manager is sitting there on mute, glancing at thumbnails. Folks who used to take a walk to think though a problem now say they feel guilty leaving the channel. I caught myself keeping my hands on the keyboard and wiggling the mouse during a call just because I knew he could see me in his little grid. It is exactly the kind of fake presence stuff I used to complain about with office culture, except I accidentally provided the infrastructure.



The worst part is the quiet resentment. A couple of coworkers have told me privately that they hate the channel now but ""its your thing and the boss likes it"". One person who has kids said it makes them paranoid because if a kid wanders into the room it feels like they are breaking an unspoken rule. Another who is neurodivergent said they are exhausted by the pressure of being on camera all day but also doesnt want to look unteamplayerish. I am starting to duck out more often and just work in silence like before, but then my manager will ping me asking if I am joining the room today. From his point of view, I think he genuinely believes he is supporting us and building camaraderie, so I feel weird telling him ""hey this thing I made is now kind of a surveillance tool"". At the same time I am mad at myself for creating it and mad at the company for grabbing onto any scrap of ""culture"" and turning it into a pseudo policy. Has anyone else had a casual remote ritual get co opted like this. How do you push back without nuking relationships or sounding like you just never want to see your coworkers faces again. Do I shut the server down, move everyone to a private group, or have a very direct talk with my manager about boundaries around cameras and presence.

1pi6l90,https://www.reddit.com/r/Autism_Parenting/comments/1pi6l90/words_for_labeling_question_18_months/,Words for labeling question - 18 months,"Hi all. I am awaiting an evaluation for my 18 month old son as we’re pretty confident he has autism. He doesn’t point whatsoever or use communicative gestures apart from waving occasionally and signing “more” and “all done.” He does however have a fair amount of words, 50-60 or so. I have read that autistic toddlers typically use words to label things and I have noticed this with my son. However, he is definitely not labeling to himself, he is typically labeling for us (his parents). For example, picking up his toy lion and saying “lion rawr” while looking at us and smiling or picking up his toy phone when it rings and smiling at us and saying “phone”, or seeing a blue light on the Christmas tree, touch it, look at us, and say “blue!” Another example is looking at me and saying “up!” when he’s “cleaning up” his toys (putting them away). 

Is this common behavior for autistic toddlers? It seems like he definitely wants to draw our attention to the object, the coffee maker or whatever it is he’s verbally calling out, but he’s really not using the language functionally otherwise. He really only says “help” to ask for help, “more” for anything he wants more of, “all done” when he’s over something or “up” when he wants picked up",2,1765284623.0,Autism_Parenting,2,1.0,False

I run a tiny home based coffee cart that just started doing pop ups at events and I’m realizing I really need a proper accounting tool. I’ve been browsing a couple sites including the one from Sage UK but I’m honestly lost comparing features and what actually matters for a business my size.

I don’t have an accountant yet and I definitely don’t want to mess up taxes again this year, so I’d rather get ahead of it and pick something that helps me stay organized without needing a degree to understand how to use it. If anyone has been in a similar stage of growth I’d love to hear what worked for you.

Here are my questions  
• Which accounting product or service would fit a really small operation that still needs invoicing, tracking and easy tax prep?  
• How steep is the learning curve realistically for someone not great with numbers?  
• Is cloud based better or should I stick with a download and install setup?  
• Any deal breakers you wish you noticed before signing up?

I really want something that I can start with now and still use if I expand a bit more.

Tried 6 donuts today with a friend. 

Started with a simple hot coffee(pretty good, ngl this is something i will be visiting again for) 
Then we got a Korean Bun, Not too bad at all, for a Donut shop their snacks slap idek why.it was lighr bread with cheese inside of it, with Some Korean spices. And we enjoyed it a lot. 
Then came the Tandoori Paneer Sandwich which i think is Brown bread idk i am not sure. That slapped as well. Really nice artificial tandoor flav but me likey. 
Portion wise, Coffe was good for the price as sometimes dunkim holds special promo for 99rs hot coffee latte and we went during that. 
Korean bun was filling, Not for 2 but a single person can eat it and be full.
Paneer snadwich was small, 2 triangular pieces. Enough for 1. 


Now, The Fckall Donuts:

1)The Classic Glazed: 
I ordered this since i wanted to see what the base profile is like. The flavour was okay,Nothing different its just Sugar Glaze on. BREAD WHICH I THINKKKK WAS STALE. 

2) Double Death By Chocolate:
This will look like a Bomb tasting donut from the LOOKS of it.
Ordered it, Had a bite and man the disappointment 😞. It tasted like worst chocolate filling you could imagine with what seemed to us like 5wali dairy milk melted with more sugar lmfaooo. The exterior was only okay because of Chocolate coating on the Donut. 


3) Mr. BROWNIE 

Great exterior, extremely satisfied with the exterior but the centre was sooo disappointing, and thats the story with most of the centre filled donut except one which i will mention next. So the brownie Donut should have a brownie tasting centre right? Wrong. All you get is chocolate with a hint of brownie because idk if they blended a brownie or what but it tasted like there was brownie sand in it lmaoo. But all in all. One time treat for sure. 

4) Berry Bae Cheesecake Donut
Heart shaped Cutie lookimg donut with berry puree on top and centre of strawberry chessecake. Right? Wrong again. 
The exterior is a thinn layer of Jam almost mot puree since it is soooo sweet mann. 
The interior is the fakest, Most artificial strawberry flavour one can derive in a lab. I swear. The kind where you dont even require a strawberry at all in the process of making it.

5) idr the name
But it had Rainbow Sprinkles all over it and it was chocolate. I really dont hate this one. It was pretty, Tasted meh but still better than the Fake Strawberry one. 

6) Granny's apple pie (MY Goat)
The granny apple donut was the best amongst the worst. 
Had an amazzzing centre of apple favoured goop. It was nice. The exterior was crunchy as in it had red velvet crumbs on top mannn. This was muaah. Sad to know it's seasonal. ",2,1765284065.0,SnacksIndia,0,1.0,False

 For many people, it has become a constant background pressure that affects sleep, focus, confidence, and daily functioning.

If you deal with:

* Overthinking  
* Constant worry  
* Tight chest or racing heart  
* A mind that won’t slow down at night  

this does not mean you are weak or “too sensitive.”  
 It means your nervous system is overwhelmed.

There are natural ways to support your body and mind so you can feel calmer, clearer, and more balanced again.

[**Go Directly to the Method**](https://www.sattrek.com/1415-2/)





# Why So Many People Feel Anxious Today

Anxiety levels have increased dramatically in recent years. Major triggers include:

* Constant screen exposure  
* Social media pressure  
* Financial or work stress  
* Poor sleep and irregular routines  
* Nutrient deficiencies and stimulants  
* Lack of human connection  

Your brain was not built to handle this much stimulation.  
 When stress builds up, the nervous system shifts into “survival mode.”

This is when you start to feel:

* Easily overwhelmed  
* Irritated for no clear reason  
* Tension in the shoulders, jaw, or stomach  
* Tired but unable to relax  

Chronic anxiety forms when this state lasts too long.

More details here:  
[ **Go Directly to the Method**](https://www.sattrek.com/1415-2/)





# How Anxiety Affects Your Brain and Body

Anxiety is not only mental.  
 It affects the entire body through:

* Stress hormones  
* Neurotransmitters  
* Fight-or-flight responses  
* Sleep cycles and recovery  

When anxiety is elevated:

* Breathing becomes shallow  
* Heart rate increases  
* Muscles stay tight  
* Your brain becomes hyper-alert  

This constant alertness is exhausting, which is why many people look for **natural anxiety relief** to help regulate their system again.





# Daily Habits That Help Reduce Anxiety

Before considering supplements, simple lifestyle adjustments can create noticeable improvements.

# 1. Breathing techniques

Slow breathing signals safety to your nervous system.

Try this pattern:  
 Inhale for 4 seconds → Hold for 4 → Exhale for 6–8

Do this for 3–5 minutes when overwhelmed.

# 2. Reduce stimulants

Caffeine, sugar, and energy drinks intensify anxiety.

Consider:

* Limiting caffeine after midday  
* Replacing some coffee with herbal tea  
* Eating more balanced meals  

# 3. Reduce screen exposure at night

Screens keep the brain in “alert mode.”  
 Turn off devices 60–90 minutes before bed.

# 4. Move your body

Even a 20-minute walk helps release tension, improve mood, and clear the mind.





# Can Natural Supplements Help With Anxiety?

Many people now look for natural options to support:

* Calmness  
* Mood balance  
* Mental clarity  
* Better sleep  

Herbal and nutrient-based formulas may help by:

* Relaxing the nervous system  
* Supporting healthy stress response  
* Improving neurotransmitter balance  
* Enhancing deeper rest  

These are not replacements for medical treatment, but some individuals find meaningful support with the right formula.

A full explanation of one natural option is here:

# A New Approach to Natural Anxiety Support

A Swiss-developed calming support method is now gaining attention. It was designed to help people who experience:

* Daily stress and tension  
* Racing thoughts  
* Difficulty winding down at night  
* Emotional overwhelm  

Its creators developed it to:

* Calm the nervous system  
* Support balanced mood  
* Improve mental clarity  
* Complement healthier sleep cycles  

Full details, formulation, and usage information are available here:  
[**Go Directly to the Method**](https://www.sattrek.com/1415-2/)





# Important Note

If your anxiety is severe or interferes with daily life:

* Seek guidance from a qualified health professional  
* Supplements and natural methods can help, but they should not replace proper treatment  

Your mental health matters, and getting support is a strength.





# Final Thoughts

Anxiety does not define you.  
 It is a signal that your body and mind need relief, recovery, and support.

By understanding your symptoms, making small lifestyle adjustments, and exploring natural calming methods, you can move toward a more stable and peaceful state.

Dubai apartments are known for their elegant layouts and modern living style. At the same time, space management and long term value have become priorities in 2025. This makes wooden furniture a top choice for homeowners who want a combination of beauty, practicality, and durability. The demand for [**wooden furniture Dubai**](https://artandcraftfurniture.com/) continues to grow because residents want interiors that feel warm, stylish, and worth the investment.

If you are planning to upgrade your apartment this year, this complete guide will help you choose the best wooden furniture for Dubai living. We will cover space planning, design trends, sustainability, care tips, and the best types of wood for lasting furniture in the UAE climate.

# Why Wooden Furniture Remains Popular in Dubai

Wood introduces a natural balance to the sleek and futuristic environment of Dubai. It adds warmth to urban homes and makes every space feel more welcoming.

Top reasons buyers choose wooden furniture in Dubai

* Long lasting strength and solid durability  
* Timeless style that works with all décor themes  
* High resale and emotional value  
* Better sustainability compared to synthetic materials  
* Easy to refresh with polishing or refinishing  

In 2025, designers are embracing natural finishes, handcrafted work, and textures that create calm environments. Wood brings exactly that to each room without losing luxury appeal.

# Types of Wood Perfect for Dubai Homes

Not all wood handles warm climates the same way. The best types of wooden furniture Dubai include:

Teak Wood  
 Highly durable, rich in natural oils, ideal for both indoor and balcony use.

Oak Wood  
 Strong and sturdy with a bold grain pattern that suits modern themes.

Walnut Wood  
 A premium choice for luxurious interiors. Deep brown tones that elevate any room.

Sheesham Wood  
 Beautiful natural variations and excellent durability. Ideal for handcrafted furniture.

These options add value to your home while staying strong against humidity and everyday use.

# Smart Furniture Choices for Compact Dubai Apartments

Functional furniture is a must for apartment living. Choose pieces that save space while enhancing the layout.

Some practical furniture essentials:

* Wooden sideboards for storage and décor display  
* Extendable dining tables that accommodate guests when needed  
* Beds with built in storage to reduce clutter  
* TV units that organize media items neatly  
* Coffee tables with drawers or shelves to maximize space  

Multifunctional designs allow homeowners to enjoy comfort without sacrificing floor area.

# Modern Design Trends for Wooden Furniture in 2025

Dubai’s interior themes are leaning toward simple elegance. Natural wood finishes are replacing glossy synthetic materials.

Here are the key design trends this year:

* Lighter shades like honey and sand to brighten spaces  
* Minimalist lines for a clean and modern look  
* Statement grain patterns as part of the design  
* Handcrafted detailing that celebrates craftsmanship  
* Mixed materials like wood with metal or rattan  

These trends help blend comfort and sophistication effortlessly. Whether you love Scandinavian simplicity or heritage inspired décor, wooden furniture provides the versatility you need.

# Sustainable and Ethical Buying Matters

Modern residents are more aware of environmental responsibility. Buying from brands that source wood legally and sustainably is important. At Art & Craft Furniture, every product uses responsibly sourced solid wood. Ethical production ensures long term environmental benefits and a stronger future market for wooden furniture in Dubai.

Choosing solid wood over mass produced synthetic furniture reduces waste because solid wood lasts many decades instead of just a few years.

# How to Style Wooden Furniture in Apartments

Styling is simple when you keep balance in mind.

Tips for styling wooden interiors:

* Use soft fabrics like cotton or linen to add comfort  
* Combine neutral tones with warm wood shades  
* Add greenery to highlight natural textures  
* Choose the right lighting to enhance grain patterns  
* Avoid overcrowding rooms to maintain a spacious feel  

Wood adapts brilliantly to both luxury themed décor and cozy contemporary spaces.

# Maintenance Tips to Keep Wood Looking New

Good care ensures your wooden furniture stays beautiful and strong for many years.

Maintenance checklist:

* Dust lightly every week with a soft cloth  
* Avoid placing furniture in direct sunlight constantly  
* Clean spills immediately to prevent stains  
* Use coasters and mats on tables  
* Apply wood polish once or twice a year  

These small steps help maintain shine and preserve structural quality.

# Why Investing in Wooden Furniture Saves Money Long Term

Benefits include:

* Lower replacement frequency  
* Better comfort and stability  
* Higher durability against daily wear  
* Custom furniture possibilities  

This makes wooden furniture a smart investment for Dubai apartment owners who want style and long lasting quality.

Struggling to concentrate, remember details, or stay sharp throughout the day? If your mind feels foggy or drained, it may not be your fault — it may be a sign that your **mental performance needs structured support**.

Recently, many people have started turning to a new brain-support approach designed to naturally boost **clarity, focus, memory, and daily mental energy**.  
 Full details here:

[ **Go Directly to the Method**](https://www.sattrek.com/1421-2/)





# Why So Many People Are Struggling Mentally Today

Modern life places enormous pressure on the brain:

* Constant screen exposure  
* Multitasking and overstimulation  
* Work stress and emotional fatigue  
* Poor sleep cycles  
* Nutrient gaps in daily diets  

Over time, this leads to:

* Persistent brain fog  
* Difficulty concentrating  
* Slow recall and forgetfulness  
* Afternoon mental crashes  
* Irritability, mood imbalance, or low motivation  
* Feeling mentally “tired” even when physically rested  

If these symptoms sound familiar, you’re not alone. More people are now choosing natural cognitive-support solutions instead of relying only on caffeine or temporary stimulants.

# What This Brain-Support Method Offers

This new formula was created to support mental performance in a complete, balanced way:

* Improved mental clarity  
* Reduced brain fog  
* Better focus and concentration  
* Enhanced memory and recall  
* More stable mental energy throughout the day  
* Support for mood balance and mental resilience  

It’s not marketed as a miracle pill — it’s designed as a **science-inspired support system** for natural brain function.

Full breakdown available here:  
[**Go Directly to the Method**](https://www.sattrek.com/1421-2/)





# Who Could Benefit From This Approach

* Struggle to stay focused at work or school  
* Forget small details, conversations, or names  
* Wake up feeling tired or mentally heavy  
* Rely on coffee but still feel sluggish  
* Want to maintain long-term mental sharpness  
* Experience mood dips or afternoon fatigue  

If this sounds like what you’ve been dealing with, exploring a natural support system might be the missing step.

# Important Things to Know

* Best results occur when paired with good sleep, hydration, and stress reduction.

It’s a small, welcoming coffee shop with plenty of natural light and a relaxed vibe. Good space for working, reading, or just taking a break. I tried their Monroe Signature Creme Cold Brew (caramel, toffee, marshmallow) and it was *really* good — sweet without being too heavy.

If you’re local or passing through Lancaster, it’s definitely worth checking out. I’m trying to highlight more small businesses around South Central PA, so if you have any favorites, I should visit next, I’m all ears.

That too via text, i thought it was a prank initially but then she said she is sorry that it felt so sudden and she doesn't wanna continue the relationship. I tried calling her, she didn't pick up. I couldn't comprehend was has happened. One year of relationship gone like it was nothing. A day went by i got another text that she is not ready to talk me through the phone and just want to check that I'm ok and taking care of myself or not. I didn't respond to it. The next day another text popped up that she understands the silence and wants me to move on, whatever happened between us in that relationship was all real and great, wished me luck for my future and everything. I was still not able to respond to anything she was saying. 1 or 2 days later she called me, i picked up. she started crying, couldn't say a word clearly, i was waiting for her to calm down and tell me what happened that day which made her do all this. She started with I'm not able to tell you what happened, i insisted then she said that she went on a coffee date with a guy from her university, had a good chat then on the way back that guy tried holding her hand and ""she didn't resisted"" her exact words. The guy asked her for another date, she refused and went back home. according to her when she started feeling guilty for what she did and then she texted me that she doesn't wanna continue this relationship. She asked me why didn't I contacted her in this period of time and why didn't i asked her for the reason of breakup. My thought was if someone has already made up her mind then does that even matter to ask for it. Now the thing is she told me all of this and just wanted me to know what happened that day. My confusion is what should i do here? she came back to me with all this and asked me what to do now? i told her u already broke up with me, no? she said i did what felt right to her at that time. I Love her so much at the same time i am not able to digest this feeling that she fancy someone while being in relationship with me. I asked her what would've u done if the roles were reversed, she told me that she wouldn't continue the relationship. She also said that she can't continue the relationship with this guilt. my conscience is split between the two, one doesn't want her to go the other one says let her go. that's all, what are your thoughts on this.

Have more than a decade of experience and I’m actually good at my work, but the moment I’m in a meeting with more than 2 people, my voice starts shaking. Presentations make me extremely nervous, to the point where I can feel my throat tightening.When out even something as normal as ordering a coffee feels or a meal like a task because I’m such an introvert.

All of this makes me doubt my own calibre. I’ve had my share of difficult experiences growing up, so my self-respect and confidence have taken a hit over the years. I also struggle to accept compliments, whether it’s at work or personally, I just freeze up or deflect.

I really want to be more confident and articulate, not just for my career but for my own peace of mind.
For the women here who’ve dealt with similar issues , how did you work on your confidence? Did anything actually help?
Would love to hear your experiences, tips, or even small daily practices.

Thanks for reading 💛

For about 10-15 minutes every morning, I just sit at my desk and wake up. I started using that time to do a quick survey or two on AttaPoll instead of mindlessly scrolling through the news.

That small habit has added up to about $15-$20 a month. It's literally the exact cost of my Netflix subscription. It feels like I'm getting my entertainment for free just by using time that was already wasted. The app is perfect for these short bursts, and the instant cash-out means I see the reward right away.

If you have any small, daily downtime, this is the easiest way to monetize it. Here's my link to get started: [**https://attapoll.app/join/vtfql**](https://attapoll.app/join/vtfql)",1,1765282650.0,ReferralLinksNation,1,1.0,False

1pi5xww,https://www.reddit.com/r/KitchenAppliances/comments/1pi5xww/when_filling_a_kettle_do_you_start_with_cold_tap/,"When filling a kettle, do you start with cold tap water or hot — and does it actually matter?","I grew up filling the kettle with hot tap water, assuming it saved time. No one ever told me it was “wrong” — it was just one of those habits you inherit in a kitchen and never question.

Recently someone told me you should always use cold water when the water will be consumed. I looked into it a bit and, beyond the plumbing side, a lot of people say:

* Cold water gives more predictable taste
* Less scale buildup inside the kettle
* More dissolved oxygen → cleaner flavor (especially for coffee/tea)
* Hot water may shorten kettle lifespan if there’s extra sediment/minerals

What surprised me was seeing the manual of my Saki stainless-steel kettle literally say “use cold drinking water only.” Not in a dramatic or marketing way — just as a quiet guideline — but it made me rethink the habit I’ve had for a decade.

So I’m curious from a kitchen/appliance perspective rather than a purely plumbing one:

Do you always start with cold? Sometimes use hot? 

Have you noticed scaling differences? Any taste differences?

Does plumbing setup (old vs new) matter here?

Not panicking — just realizing that I’ve been doing the same thing forever without thinking about the *kitchen implications* of it. Curious what the practical consensus is among people who actually care about how things work in the kitchen.",1,1765282593.0,KitchenAppliances,6,1.0,False
