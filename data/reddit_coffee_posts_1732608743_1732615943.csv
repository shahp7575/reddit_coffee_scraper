1h08fg4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sciatica/comments/1h08fg4/i_feel_you_i_can_relate/,"“I feel you.”, “I can relate.”, …","**NO!** You cannot truly understand how much it takes - physically and mentally - to survive each day, waking up to the same relentless cycle of pain.

When people try to show empathy with empty words, it enrages and saddens me. I know they mean well, but they’ll never grasp how exhausting it is to live with this injury, especially when it keeps me up at night, worsening my mental state. Sometimes, silence would be more comforting than shallow attempts to relate.

I’m 22 years old. My birthday was in September, but I haven’t celebrated it in two years. I just don’t have the mental energy. I haven’t attended any family gatherings either. Yesterday, my dad called, saying it was okay if I couldn’t come to his birthday party on December 8th. Do you know how heartbreaking it is to tell your dad, *“I wish I could”*?

This all started on **April 18, 2022, at 8:42 AM** - during a deadlift. I remember the exact moment because it’s seared into my memory. It happened right before my high school graduation, and I couldn’t celebrate like everyone else. Nobody understood the pain I was in, and those I told dismissed it as “not that bad.” I wasn’t invited to my classmates’ celebrations because they found my behavior “weird.” Outwardly, I looked fine, but inside, I was breaking, watching others enjoy life while I struggled with searing back pain radiating down my leg like boiling water.

After graduation, I moved to a new city to pursue a degree in software engineering. For two years, I managed to push through, but about two months ago, everything fell apart. I’ve been bedridden most days since then. The mental toll has been immense, worsened by the lack of support. I didn’t make friends at the start of university because I skipped all the parties and social events, rushing home after classes to lie down and get even the slightest relief.

Living alone for the past two years, I haven’t had a single visitor, shared a coffee, or even had casual conversations. The only person I occasionally text is a childhood friend who doesn’t know about my condition. I’m scared to tell him, fearing he might leave too. It’s terrifying how quickly people disappear when you can’t offer anything but pain and complaints.

As for love? I’ve never been in a relationship. I’ve tried chatting with women, but when I bring up my back problems, many seem to pull away. I understand—most people want a partner to share adventures with, not someone confined to a bed. There’s one girl I’ve been talking to who feels different. She’s genuinely kind, often reaching out to me after days of silence, and she seems to care. But she lives far away, and I’m scared to fully open up about the severity of my situation, worried it might push her away too. I’ve mentioned that I have back problems, but I haven’t explained just how debilitating it really is. Traveling to see her is impossible; even a short walk leaves me in unbearable pain. The last time I took public transport, I endured the entire trip in silence, afraid to inconvenience the person sitting next to me, even as I suffered.

The hardest part of this injury is going outside and seeing everyone else living their lives freely. It’s impossible not to compare yourself, and even if you try not to, the mask crumbles the moment you’re alone.

I recently had an epidural injection in my L5-S1 area, but it didn’t help. My next option is a facet joint injection, though I’ve lost hope it will do any difference. My L5-S1 disc is so degenerated it’s nearly black, and I have an annular fissure causing centralized back pain. Because the disc hasn’t extruded, surgeons refuse to operate, saying I’m too young and it will heal in time. But after 2.5 years of getting worse, I’m just waiting for the day I can’t get out of bed at all.

What’s baffling is why my pain has worsened despite no significant changes in MRI results over the years. Each scan looks identical, yet my condition deteriorates.

I don’t know if sharing this will help anyone, but I needed to let it out. I’m having a terrible day - several in a row, actually. I feel like I’m slowly giving up. Right now, I’m just existing, waiting for a miracle I don’t believe will come.

If you’re young like me, in your early twenties, feeling like you’ve lost your friends, your career, your family, your chance at love, and - most painfully - yourself, just know you’re not alone.

They have some big clients who contract them for all kinds of projects. This one time when I was in a meeting with their client and they were discussing about reducing food wastage, I mentioned I have a personal project that I have been building in my free time to remotely control a coffee machine and get push notifications about the status. They asked me if I'm willing to build new features and I said if I think it will benefit the community then sure. I did mention to them that it is licensed AGPL v3 and they were okay with it.

This client then spoke to my manager and they assigned the job to me and I built all the features they wanted, like automatically placing an order with the supplier, sending a push notification when a cup of coffee is ready, sending an alert to the Slack chat if a cup of coffee is sitting there without anyone claiming it, etc.

I just got to know that my company is selling this as a subscription to the client without making the source available to them. They basically mirrored my GitHub repository to the company's internal Git repository and changed the LICENSE file without even asking me. I asked the manager and she said I've been compensated for it already and I said NO YOU CAN'T DO THAT because of the terms outlined in the AGPL, and then she mockingly asked me if I have any legal experience. I wrote to Richard Stallman to complain about it but he said I should be seeking legal advice myself, and there's not much he can do, which was kinda disappointing because his philosophy is the whole reason why I licensed it this way. Now he tells me there's nothing he can do about it.

I do have all the call recordings where they say they accept when I told them that my project is AGPL v3 licensed.",5,1732615227.0,developersIndia,1,1.0,False

1h08cqx,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheFrontDesk/comments/1h08cqx/no_agreeable_conversation_here/,No Agreeable Conversation Here,"It's a little after 4 am. The front desk phone rings. I'm expecting either a guest problem, a guest question about coffee/breakfast/checkout times or someone asking if we still have rooms available. At first, I hear no one. I turn up the volume on the phone, nothing. I shift the coiled phone cord around a bit - ah! Finally a voice. 

I can barely understand them due to the static on the line so it takes finessing of the cord a few more times (the front desk phone is having issues again) to understand them and I hear that phrase ""our mutual guest""  That can only mean one thing: third party. I finally locate the ""mutual guest"" and pull up the rate program. The ""mutual guest"" wants to cancel and wants a full refund. 

The rate is for a NON-REFUNDABLE prepaid 3rd party that begins with an E rate on Thanksgiving Day. For the billionth time, I get to explain to the 3rd party caller what nonrefundable means and that no we can't cancel it without a penalty. They mention extenuating circumstances. Now if they had booked through the brand directly, no issue, we're very nice here, I'll have it canceled with no penalty in two seconds flat. BUT this is a 3rd party booking . 

I swear 3rd parties do this on purpose they call us to tell them what they should already know the answer to, so that when they get in touch with the guest they can switch the blame to the hotel. DESPITE the fact that it is the 3rd party's policy and rate and they have the guest's money - we don't - we get a Virtual CC from the 3rd party but the guest's money never actually goes to us. I reminded my 3rd party ""friend"" of this. Well, he took great offense and used the ""well it looks like an agreeable conversation can't be continued and the whole thank you for cooperating with us. 

I will admit to an annoyed tone but that's because I was reminded of how they blamed it us last time and I had to explain to the guest 10 times for a hour over the phone why they weren't getting their money back when the 3rd party told them they would. Plus I'm just really tired of explaining their own policies to them and on my 5th night audit in a row with little sleep.

How do I move forward from the deceit?,"My fiancé has been lying to be about porn for 2 months when I disclosed I don’t want it as a part of my relationship. We both used to watch it and I thought I was okay with it, but my ex had a porn addiction and it left me very traumatized. My fiancé does not view it in the same compulsive manner as my ex, but he can’t stop it. He finally came clean to me last week and I’m not sure what to do. 

Initially, I had just asked him to try to quit for a month so we could both assess our dependency (I worried I may have been dependent on it as well). I went 3 weeks without it, and I thought he did as well. I then started feeling guilty for being controlling and suggested we watch it together, and that we restart the month detox. We did, and everything was fine, and I went 3 weeks without it again. 

I checked in with him a few times and he said he was drinking more coffee at work (he only masturbates at work in a single cubicle bathroom, he says he does it because of my trauma and he doesn’t want to do it at home while I’m there) and going on walks/staying busy. Anyway, he finally breaks down and tells me he hasn’t quit, he’s been watching it at least twice a week, and lying to me about it. 

He also admitted to imagining porn while we were having sex to maintain his erection, but he confessed he also thought about two girls he liked before he started dating me - both of them rejected him. They’re petite Asians and look nothing like me. I feel like a sex toy. 

I can get over porn 1-2 a week if that’s something he needs. I don’t want to control his body and respect he does it away from me. I’ve even tried watching porn with him a handful of times and each time I feel like it’s a third person in our sex life and hate it. But I can’t seem to move past the lying and gaslighting, and the fact he used me as a masturbatory aid for his fantasies about real people. He said it’s common. I’ve never done it. 

I love this man and want to marry him, but I’ve been punishing and scrutinizing him for a week. He said he would quit the porn and he hasn’t watched it in a week and I believe him, but I told him it’s not about the porn (fine, maybe he’s bored/anxious/stressed at work and I get it’s just easier) but also the fact I’m alwaaaays down to have sex and he’s rejected me a few times in the past - no I wonder if it was because he watched porn that day. I know he could’ve just been tired, but it’s hard to get these thoughts out of my mind. 

I’m not sure what to do. I want to forgive him and move on and stop thinking about this and the fact that he might watch porn when he goes to work. I’m just in so much pain that I even suggested we make our own videos after all this and he has them but he caved in after almost a week of not watching it and watched “ebony” porn and apparently forgot that he even had our videos. Now I feel crushed. 

 And for clarification, I watch porn too, and did before I met him as well - I just know I can leave it, but he can’t. 

THIS WEEK

He decided to quit weed and porn and he’s currently on day 4, however, he goes back to the office this week and I’m so anxious I can’t sleep. He offered to download porn blockers but I just don’t see the point. I’ve been so anxious and paranoid and feeling so insecure and hideous ever since he disclosed he had been lying. It’s not even so much about the porn as much as it is the lying and making me believe he didn’t have an addiction and could stop watching it whenever for almost a year. 

How can I move on from this? Should I just accept he will watch porn and that it has nothing to do with me? Should I trust that he will try his best to quit and hold him to that standard since that’s what I truly want? Please and and all advice is so appreciated. ",1,1732614742.0,Marriage,2,1.0,False

Alam niya na I am into photography kaya she initiated me na ako na lang kunin na photographer for their ""prenup photoshoot"" sa Legazpi at um-oo naman agad ako kasi libre naman lahat pero wala siyang sinabi na ""punta ka sa kasal namin"" at hindi rin naman natuloy yung photoshoot kasi hindi nakauwi daddy niya.

Before Christmas ay bumalik na ako ng Manila kasi isang linggo lang naman ako nagbakasyon ng Bicol. I greeted her on Christmas Day and she greeted me as well. After Christmas I even sent a message na ""kailan na sunod nating gala?"" but i didn't get a reply from her. Out of the blue ay chineck ko facebook account niya, may nakatag sa kaniya during their wedding. I was too stunned to speak kaya inunsent ko na lang last chat ko kasi di ko alam pa'no irereact ko na 'di man lang ako sinabihan o ininvite man lang sana. 

Btw mauunawaan ko naman sana if intimate wedding yun but no, andun workmates niya, churchmates, mga bagets, and strangers. If nagtitipid sila kaya konti lang ang nasabihan ay okay lang sana pero hindi eh. I unfriended her and unfollowed her on my ig for my peace of mind at nirestrict siya sa messenger kasi nasaktan ako bilang matalik niyang kaibigan.

2 years have passed at 'di na kami muling nagkita or nagkausap pa pero sa t'wing nakikita niya ibang kaibigan ko ay nagtataka daw siya ba't daw di na ako nagpaparamdam sa kaniya. Valid naman yung naging reaksyon ko 'di ba?",2,1732614194.0,AkoBaYungGago,6,1.0,False

This roaster, designed to work with gas or wood, was found in Sana’a, and I couldn’t believe we stumbled upon such a masterpiece in Yemen. It was being used in a spice shop for roasting coffee and spices and was in a rather dilapidated state.

We transported it with our team to our branch in Hadda and began restoring it. Piece by piece, we disassembled it, cleaning off decades of build-up. The restoration process took five days, with the involvement of our entire team and a few friends. It was an exceptional journey, filled with passion and hard work.

Weighing around 900 kilograms, this roaster was built for long hours of operation, thanks to its unique design and ceramic insulation that protects the roasting drum. Its characteristics give the coffee roasted in it an unmatched flavor. While we’re not entirely sure why, it feels akin to the effect of wood-fire grilling.

So far, we haven’t dared to use wood for roasting, but we’d love to hear recommendations on the best types of wood to use and tips for lighting it. A wood-roasted coffee experiment would be an exciting step forward!

Coffee is a world that captivates the soul, and with every detail in roasting and roasters, our passion grows to new heights. Before acquiring this roaster, we used to rely on specialized roasters in Sana’a, and occasionally, we roasted coffee manually in emergencies.

What an incredible journey it has been with *Mocha Hunters*! A heartfelt thank you to our amazing team, our friends who have supported us through the years, and, of course, our loyal customers in Yemen and worldwide.

Get your documents in order and have them all rounded up and easily accessible:

* ID or driver’s license expiring soon-ish? Renew them now
* *Get a passport*. Everyone in the family should get a passport, even if you don’t use it right now
* Maybe get passports for your pets or at least microchip them
* If someone in the family died recently-ish and the succession wasn’t done, then get to it because it takes a lot of time (the danger here is that any unclaimed money, real estate or valuables may be taken by the state)
* Make sure all the utility bills are in your name and not someone deceased/former owner

Women’s supplies:

* Buy a shtload of pads, tampons, menstrual cups or underwear for the users in your household. As in years worth (they don’t take up that much space and are shelf stable). Even if they oppose it. If you have a young daughter that may start in the next 4 years, buy some supplies now
* Contraceptives, plan B
* Maybe some harder painkillers for cramps if applicable, a war on drgs can get stupid

Food/pantry/liquor:

* Shelf stable dried goods and cans/jars, you’ll find plenty of detailed lists around here, this particularly applies if you live in any major city near possible riot locations
* Anything imported that you and your family like, with an accent on anything that might come across as posh/bougie (I’m mostly referring to stuff not made in Europe and things that we won’t be able to produce internally): maple syrup, any asian sauces, anything from the Korean shops, coffee - particularly craft coffee and pods for machines, high(er) end booze (and even if you don’t drink maybe pick up a few bottles of mid-range stuff for bribes/barter), fancy chocolate
* If you have a Chemex coffee pot maybe pick up a few boxes of filters for it 
* Pet food

Household:

* IATA-approved pet carriers, ideally each pet with their own, these come in handy even if you travel by car as they are easier to stack, buckle-up, and are more secure
* If you are eyeing a KitchenAid stand mixer now would be a great time to get one lol
* Any appliances, phones or laptops nearing their end-of-life? If able, change them now
* Burner phone(s) or at least dumb phones plus SIMs, one per family member
* Multifactor authentication (or 2FA at least) with physical key (like yubikey) on all accounts, one key per person
* Important contact information (relatives, friends, maybe even some neighbors, handymen) written in a physical notebook or addresbook
* External batteries and at least one solar battery (best would be a solar generator but those are more expensive and not really easy to come across)
* Table lamps (why? because it may come in handy to not have a main ceiling light on, may pair well with blackout curtains)
* Torches, headlamps, camping lamps, at least some of these on classic batteries 
* Anything that would be required to run the household smooth for at least a month or two if you are in riot-prone areas
* If you like simplehuman trash bags get some now
* Be up to date on car maintenance and keep a winter kit/get home bag in there (unrelated to politics, it just seems that we are in for a rough winter)
* Alternative way to heat your home. Sleeping bags and thermal underlayers
* Fortify your home (plenty of home security info around here, but one of note would be that if it seems at least a slim possibility, is applicable to you and you have the space for it, get some OSB boards and cut them up to size to quickly board up any street-facing ground level windows you might have, also pre-drill and install the mounting spots before you may need them, this applies even you have bars on those windows because rocks and bricks can still fly between bars)
* Keep some cash, both in RON and EUR

Various/nice to have:

* Books and media that may not be “liked”. It’s too late for movies unless you buy SH, but it may be useful to get music on physical media, along with a device to play it with
* Boardgames to fight off boredom, be wary of those that require an app to play
* If you have any reno/DIY project on the radar now would be a good time to get any supplies that are imported from outside Europe and/or higher-end (examples: building materials from Kerakoll, Benjamin Moore/Pittsburgh paints, Makita/DeWalt power tools, grow lights for indoor or balcony gardening)
* Not really related to politics, but to winter: really good walking boots and winter jacket, even if you usually drive
* If you have multiple houses figure out where you want to stay and move/plan accordingly. If you have a bigger house and say plan to move your parents or in-laws there maybe do it now. Move any valuables now

Other notes:

* Tools or sporting goods can be used as self defense
* Get bear spray even if you live nowhere near bears
* Keep a low profile (incl have quality clothes and gear but don’t flash brands)
* No political or (anti)religious stickers, posters etc on laptop, home or vehicle
* Social media scrub up - everything set to private, curate friends list, hide liked pages, be careful what pics you share and what can be seen in them
* Go to the next step(s) and choose the opponents, here the president can’t really do much without a supportive parliament. Extremists are on the rise everywhere though, so plan accordingly
* Read up on what people in totali countries are doing, maybe lurk on an infosec forum/community (it may be good to get on mastodon for this)
* Watch this with your family: search youtube for deviant ollam lawyer passport locksmith gun  (ofc some of it is inapplicable to us but still; there are other useful clips on the channel too)

1h07nec,https://www.reddit.com/r/LivingEssentials/comments/1h07nec/what_is_the_best_single_serve_coffee_machine/,What Is The Best Single Serve Coffee Machine?,"Hey coffee lovers! I've been on a quest to find the perfect single-serve coffee machine, and I thought I'd share my experience with you all. After trying multiple machines and spending countless hours researching, I think I've finally found the sweet spot.

I used to be that person who'd brew a full pot of coffee only to drink one cup and waste the rest. Sound familiar? That's when I decided to make the switch to single-serve brewers, and honestly, it's been a game-changer.

First off, let's talk about what makes a single-serve coffee maker worth buying. The main things I looked for were:
- Brewing speed (because who wants to wait forever for their morning coffee?)
- Easy cleaning (nobody likes maintenance hassles)
- Coffee quality (duh!)
- Price point (value for money is crucial)
- Size (counter space is precious)

After trying several machines, I discovered that the best options are available right here: https://athometouch.com/coffeemachine. There's something for everyone, whether you're a basic brew person or a wannabe barista.

The thing I love most about single-serve machines is how convenient they are. No measuring, no filters to deal with, and no waste. Plus, every cup is fresh! If you're living alone or you're the only coffee drinker in your household, this is absolutely the way to go.

Pro tip: Look for machines that are compatible with both pods and ground coffee. This gives you more flexibility and can save you money in the long run. Some of the newer models even have milk frothers built-in, so you can make lattes and cappuccinos at home!

Temperature control is another feature that's worth considering. I've found that machines that brew at 195-205°F give the best flavor extraction. Anything lower and you're not getting the full potential of your coffee beans.

If you're still on the fence, I'd highly recommend checking out the options at https://athometouch.com/coffeemachine. The prices are competitive, and there's usually some sort of deal going on.

By the way, don't fall for the myth that single-serve machines can't make ""real"" coffee. Some of these machines produce better coffee than many coffee shops I've been to! The key is finding the right machine for your specific needs and taste preferences.

One last thing - whatever machine you choose, remember to descale it regularly. This keeps your coffee tasting great and your machine running smoothly for years to come.

Hope this helps you make an informed decision! If you have any questions, feel free to drop them in the comments below.",1,1732611843.0,LivingEssentials,0,1.0,False

Bones are best!
Bones are best!
Put your willpower to the test.
You're a starving nervous wreck cherié,
It's time for a blood test.
Your body's sore,
Exhausted your reserves.
And starving fray's your nerves.
Throw away stuff, food's malicious,
Your ultimate goal weight is ambitious.
Don't eat a thing!
Run and dance!
Check your body with a sneaky glance.
Until you pass out your body don't need a rest.
I came to your rescue,
To make your body miniscule.
Bones are best!
Oui, thins best!
Bones are best!
Bones debut,
Fat goes away.
Look how much less you weigh!
You are scared, full of despair, 
So get on your knees and pray.
You're alone, no one's there,
Your mind and body both impaired.
You'll be skinny, stop your complaining!
No one cares, don't bother explaining!
Drink diet cokes, lies and tricks,
Your limbs will look like fragile sticks.
The gamble for pretty perfection or death.
Only water fills your glass,
Until you've got a boney ass.
Thin is best!
Have you guessed?
That fucking appetite must be suppressed.
Bones are best!
Bones are best!
Bones are best!
Food is so unnerving,
To the starving and the purging.
My scathing remarks you always try to outrun.
Don't forget pretty restriction tools are useful,
Things to count calories and weigh food and yourself on.
Enjoy that high from fasting,
'Cause the chest pains leave you gasping.
Needing exercise, and to swallow those diet pills,
If you eat then you'll see me get quite hateful.
Flabby, fat and lazy,
Those days are gone but now you're crazy.
Bones are best!
Bones are best!
If you survive, then you'll be blessed!
Lock your jaw and food's ignored.
And each day you will weigh less!
Friends desert and lovers flee,
So my dear you're stuck with me.
I'm your silent and final undoing,
Diet coke bubbling, black coffee brewing.
A perfect storm, You they forgot,
And now I'm all that you've got.
Well now you're suicidal and depressed.
We've got a lot to do,
Lose another kg or two.
For you, thins best!
Thin is best!
Thin is best!
Bones are best!
Bones are best!
My commands help with your request,
And let's face its not like anybody cares.
And you're obsessed.
With your meal,
Don't eat please.
A miracle, yet also a disease
If your body functions start slowing,
Don't let it stop you, we'll keep going.
Could die, of course.
Say its fun!
You must lie to convince everyone.
You must not eat, but if you do then that food must not digest.

1h07ihh,https://www.reddit.com/r/EstrangedAdultChild/comments/1h07ihh/having_baby_soon_and_struggling_with_enabler_mom/,Having baby soon and struggling with enabler mom,"So, the title here is pretty self-explanatory… I’m pregnant and due in only a few weeks. I’ve been NC with my dad for about a year and a half now but still speak to my mom. For context: my parents are married and living together. My mom and I have a complex relationship. As long as my dad isn’t mentioned, we can both really enjoy spending time together and she’s great to me. But if anything regarding him is brought up in conversation, there’s immediately a lot of tension. This is because she always defends him fiercely, no matter how shitty he is to me, and downplays his bad behavior and actions towards me. I find this extremely frustrating because it invalidates my feelings and makes me feel like the bad guy, when I’m just standing up for myself and protecting my boundaries. 

Now here’s the situation. I want to send out cards after my baby’s born to announce the birth (this is tradition where I live and I am excited to send out these cards to my friends and family, and my husband’s). Now I don’t want to send a card to my parents’ house, because I don’t want my dad to see it as an invitation to come see me and the baby. I want to remain NC with him and I don’t want him anywhere near my child. My reasoning behind this is if you can’t treat your own kid right, you have no business being around mine. Now for my mom, I offered to have a card sent to my house that I can give her personally instead of sending it to their house. She did not take this well. She says this is ‘absolutely unacceptable’ as it’s ‘mean towards my father’ to not send a card to their house. She refused to discuss it over text (where I made my offer about sending the card to my house). Instead she asked the next day if we can meet soon for coffee. I agreed, but I’m terrified she’s going to give me a whole sermon about letting my dad be in my baby’s life because it’s cruel if I don’t let him. I’m scared she’s going to play at my emotions and conscience to get her point about my dad across (she always does this when trying to pressure me to contact him). My stomach is in knots ever since I agreed to meer her soon and I’m dreading the conversation we’re going to have. It takes me a lot of energy to defend myself against her emotional manipulation, especially if she starts crying when I don’t agree to do things her way (which she does sometimes). Honestly this adds a lot of stress for me in the last weeks of my pregnancy, I’m worried she’ll really ramp up the pressure to make me contact my dad and let him be in my child’s life. I just want to relax and enjoy this special time in my life with my husband. Not sure where I’m going with this, but I really needed to get this situation and my feelings off my chest here.

Before I start spewing this stuff…

CAUTION AHEAD: Trigger warnings for mentions of self harm, emotional/ physical abuse, substance abuse and symptoms of trauma.  You have been warned of the splash zone… those of you in the first few rows may get wet…

Let’s go…

Well, I thought I was going to make a throwaway Reddit account to keep this off my main for several reasons.  I try to keep my main account a lighthearted, safe-ish place  (hardie-har-har, Reddit…) where I can make jokes about things like video games and books, draw art and get feedback on my various craft projects and I don’t want to be constantly looking back at this post once the dust settles…. If this even kicks any up.  I hope it doesn’t, especially on those AI voiced reddit drama youtube channels.  Fuck it, though… it is what it is, I am who I am.  Aside from not knowing what to do with this little… “drama purge,” I also don’t really know what subreddit I would post it in, so I hope you'll forgive me if it seems out of place.  This might be a long story, so settle in, grab a snack and some coffee.  We’re going to be here for a while….

So, what’s the deal?  I (female 31)…. I’ll call myself “River"" (fake name) received a message that I hadn’t expected from someone who I voluntarily cut contact with years ago.  This came from completely out of the blue for me, but let’s back up to my college years for a little bit of context.  

When I was a college sophomore about 2013,  I was encouraged by someone who found me working on my crafts in the student lounge, to join a campus club based around nerd culture.  Think anime, videogames… etcetera.  I decided to give it a try, as I hadn’t really made any friends since leaving high school, and while I was in high school, I was this dorky little goth kid who was constantly made fun of by anyone outside the quiet-art-kid circle.  I was also abused and emotionally neglected by my family growing up, so I didn’t really have a support system for this and just avoided other people for the most part, but was still desperate for a place to belong.

I was pleasantly surprised by the lack of  us-versus-them mentality between the social circles once I started my college courses.  There were friend groups, but everyone just kind of intermingled.  I was out of my childhood home and I finally felt comfortable enough to give socializing a good try.  If I didn’t make any close friends,  I’d at least have an excuse to play games with people.  That's where I met the person who I would become fast friends with.  Let's call her “Maple"" …another fake name of course (female, now 33 I think).   
Maple and the rest of the nerd-club had known each other, since elementary school since it's kind of a small town  and I was the newcomer who just kind of wandered in.  We all got along pretty  well, for a good couple of years.  There was an episode of trouble with the “politics” of the club which was later disbanded for a number of reasons to do with technical issues with the college and a lack of general participation, but we all moved past that and stayed pretty close.  We had board game, tabletop, videogame nights and the like. 
 Maple and I had gotten really close to the point that we considered each other best friends.  We would go on outings just with each other.  I would drive her to her weekly group therapy appointments and wait for her in the lobby, then we'd go get lunch or boba tea together.  I didn’t mind the gas usage at the time, because in my mind, I was helping my friend with her mental health (she’s formally diagnosed with BPD as far as I know and she also has a bit of a temper) and that in itself was worth the effort to me!  There were even talks of becoming flat mates and getting an apartment together.
After another year or so, she started talking to a long distance friend romantically,  and I was genuinely happy for her for finding someone as she seemed to have been formerly unlucky in love and relationships.  After a couple weeks of them talking, I learned some information that knocked me a little off-kilter…  So, this guy, (Male, unsure of his exact age… I think he's in his early 30’s too.) we’ll call him “Travis.” 
 Apparently this wasn’t the first time Maple and Travis had spoken to each other romantically, but due to the fact that they were living several states apart and Maple wasn’t sure if she could handle a long distance relationship, Maple broke up with Travis.  This led to an incident where Travis convinced one of his friends to call Maple and tell her that Travis had um... “self-deleted"" over the break up to scare her, only for Travis to call her back a short while later and ask her how the thought of him being gone forever made her feel.  I was under the impression that this occurred before I ever even met Maple so this would’ve taken place when they were both in their late teens or early 20’s and Travis had gotten back into Maple's good graces since.
The fake self-deleting story gave me some pretty massive ick, but I managed to internally talk myself down from getting visibly upset in front of Maple.  They WERE both young after all…. and young people do stupid shit, like… a lot….  For those of you internally screaming at me for being a stupid dipshit at this point, yeah… I was.  My family was dysfunctional and I didn’t really have a good idea of what normal…or “functional"" looked like.  My parents quickly discouraged me from sleep overs and birthday parties after I discovered how “nice” my friend’s families were, so yeah, I was ignorant at what a healthy, functional family looked like.  Part of it was my own fault for not seeking therapy,  as I was fresh into a higher education and had my schooling placed as my first priority.

I figured, as long as Maple had forgiven Travis, and Travis was making an effort to better himself as a person, this could be worked through.  So now Maple and Travis decided to be a long distance couple again.  Keep in mind, that these two were online gaming buddies and had never actually met in person before.  This would have been in January of 2016 I believe… I could be remembering the time frame incorrectly though.  We were all in our early or mid 20’s at this point.  
Later, Maple and Travis decided that Travis was going to fly into our state for a vacation so he and Maple could meet in person for the first time, and all of us were going to go on outings throughout the time he was here to show Travis the local scenic locations, hot-spots and tourist traps.  This visit and series of trips was scheduled for July of that year.  We were all pretty excited about it!

On my personal front though, I had also recently started a new job, and had discovered that my disgraced and estranged biological father had gone off the wagon, (a violent alcoholic who had supposedly been sober since about 2005)  so aside from talks about moving into an apartment with Maple, trying to figure out my schooling,  and just feeling generally out of place in my own life, there was a myriad of other stressors occurring.  Some of these were even coming directly from Maple herself. 

Maple hadn’t had a car at this point for about a year, so I found myself having to drive her back and fourth to be a much more frequent occurrence.  This was occasionally frustrating since I lived a couple of towns over, and on days that I didn’t have work, I would still have to drive into town.  I was generally exhausted,  since I was working 40 hours a week, and spending my days off as a personal chauffer for my then, best friend… but I kept my mouth shut and just powered through it because no one likes a crybaby, and that’s just what friends were supposed to do, right?  She preferred that I was the one to take her around for various reasons, though there were other options in a pinch.  During these car rides she stopped talking to me as much and opted to text with Travis while I was driving her around, so these car rides became a lot more boring or quiet aside from the radio.

It happened around this time that I decided to take up a new hobby to help with the stress I was going through.  Oil painting!  I had always been into art, but had never thought of myself as someone who was good with wet mediums and usually stuck to pencils.  Learning how to use oil paint was like this huge epiphany for me as it fixed one of my biggest creative flaws by means of the medium’s behavior.  I would fixate on the more fine tuned details before I had completed the general shape of the subject and with the way the “wet on wet” process works with oils, it forced me to think about how to handle the process as a whole before jumping into it.

I started doing better for a couple of weeks before another series of events that finally broke me.  There was one day, I think it was in March, that ended up being so horribly stressful that I intentionally injured myself for the first time since high school. 

 It was supposed to be my only day off of work for that week (we had schedules that changed weekly).   I was supposed to have another day off, but somebody called out, because “they were too tired” and the manager called me in a panic last minute.  So then came my other “day off"" and….guess what happens?  Yep.  That same coworker was too “tired and stressed"" and called out again and guess who the boss tried to call in?  I must have hesitated or huffed when she asked if I could come down ASAP, because then she followed it up with the fact that she had tried calling literally everyone else on the roster, but no one could come in.  I felt really tired and defeated, but decided, “Fuck it""  it was only a four hour shift.  So I show up to work.  Just an hour before the end of my impromptu shift, guess what happens… someone else calls out, I get asked to stay late, no one else wants to stay, and you know what?   “Double-fuck it…”  I'm already here.  So I stay for a full shift.  

During my lunch break,  Maple also texted me.  She wanted to go out shopping but needed a ride, and as tired as I was, I figured “Well, triple-fuck it…” I'm already in town, and maybe hanging out with my friend will make me feel better.  So after my work shift I take her out shopping in the next town over.  Maple didn’t talk much.  She just texted Travis and girl-giggled every so often.  By the time we’re done it's late, I’m exhausted and I just want to go home.  I stopped for fast food because I didn’t feel like cooking, and drove home just to find the absolute turd-cherry on the diarrhea icing of this shit-cake.  My grandmother has a habit of picking through the trash for “treasures"" since she’s a great depression baby.  I had thrown away a small painting the day before, because some weird chemical reaction with a new brand of paint I had used had caused the paint not to dry even after a 3 week period, so it was kind of a lost cause.  Well my grandmother walked into my bedroom because she was bored, picked the painting out of my bedroom garbage can and laid it on my bed because “she wanted to look at it…” but after she discovered it was wet, she went to wash the paint off her hands, leaving the oil painting, a couple popsicle sticks wet with craft glue and some other garbage residue soaking into my bed sheets while she lost interest and decided she wasn’t going to bother cleaning up the mess of trash she’d dumped all over my bed.  So I get home just to discover that after I get called in, get my shift extended and getting begged into taking Maple out shopping, I now have to stay up till probably past midnight washing my bedsheets before I had to be up for work early the next morning.  I was fucking pissed.  I put my dinner on my desk, rip the sheets off my bed, confront my grandmother who seems completely unbothered and unapologetic for making the mess she did, and start the laundry while my dinner gets cold upstairs.  When I got back upstairs I shut the bedroom door and silent screamed.  After growing up the way I had, in the household I did, I've learned how to essentially scream and cry without making noise.  My parents found it annoying when I cried, so if I got in trouble for something I wasn’t aware I did wrong, got punished and then cried because I was distressed over being punished and not knowing how to fix it.  I’d then get smacked around and berated for making “annoying and unnecessary"" sounds. 
I silent screamed a couple of times, silent cried and when that didn’t help, I slammed my head against my bedroom wall several times as hard as I could.  Inflicting that kind of physical pain on myself made me calm down a lot quicker.  Then I got the fuck over it…. Because that's what I had been expected to do my whole life.  Get the fuck over it.  Too bad, life happens, stop being such a downer and suck it up, Buttercup.  Move on.  You have shit to do.

The next day, after my work shift, I went straight home and hid in my room with what I think was probably the largest quantity of chocolate milk I had ever consumed, to be alone and play video games.  I was horribly overstimulated and didn’t want to talk to anyone that I didn’t have to for a couple of days, but after the first day, Maple texted me, playfully scolding that since I had the afternoon off after a morning shift, I shouldn’t be ignoring her texts, which by the way was one that she'd only sent me late the night before.  I found this to be kind of entitled behavior,  but I let it go.

A couple of days later, Maple wanted a chauffer again, so I drive to pick her up.  When I walk into her house she says she has some exciting news.  Travis is making plans to look for an apartment or house in the area for all three of us to move into in short order and he wants to put the first few payments down so we can get a head start.

I should have been excited over the thought of distancing myself from my family.  The space would have probably been good for me.  Something felt off however.  I don’t know how to describe it… like a knot in the pit of my stomach and throat and severe lightheadedness.  My chest was really tight too.  All I managed to say was “Wow… I don’t even know what to say to that….” And kind of chuckled.  I didn’t know what to say to that.  I was internally having flashbacks to my mother bringing random men from bars and dating sites into the house.  Things were moving way too fast and I didn’t feel like I could object, because there were two other people involved in this situation who were in complete agreement with each other.  I didn’t even really know this guy yet, and in fact, I think we'd only spoken once over an in-game voice chat at this point.  I spent the entire day acting surprised and thinking about the situation, but not really “agreeing to it.”  I needed time to run things through.  We're still in March I think, by the way.

The next time I drove Maple to therapy,  she'd mentioned a comment that Travis had made, supposedly as a joke.  Something to the effect that, “…if all three of us were living together, when they decided to start having kids, which would likely be immediately, it would be like having their own live-in nanny!”  I just kind of chuckled awkwardly and played it off as a joke.  It should be mentioned that Maple was always OBSESSED with the idea of being a mom.  There’s nothing wrong with that, but keep in mind, these two hadn’t lived together for any period of time or even met in person at this point in time and they were already thinking of baby names.  I meanwhile am very happily child-free and intend to stay that way.  I'm not really what you would describe as “great with kids"" and I’d spent most of my time looking after my younger brother while my mom worked, my dad got blitzed, and after my parents divorced, while my mother went on dates every weekend. That being said, I was pretty much over taking care of kids that weren’t mine without being given the choice to object.  Again I felt like I couldn’t say anything, because everyone else in this arrangement was in agreement , and this time, because I was trapped inside of a car with her, and doubly again, she’s known to have a little bit of a temper.  

It was a week or two later that I decided to politely decline the offer to move in with them, only stating that “I didn’t want to intrude on a couple’s honeymoon house.”  I didn’t want to be a third wheel, a housekeeper or a nanny either, but I kept that part to myself, because I didn’t want her to feel “called out.”  Again, again… she can have a temper and I don’t like conflict.  Notice a pattern yet?  Yeah, early/mid 20’s me was an easily manipulated little pick-me.  I thought I was doing my best to be a good friend, but when it comes down to it, I was pretty emotionally immature and damaged and just wanted to be liked by SOMEBODY…heck,  ANYBODY,  because I didn’t know how to love myself.   I was a dumb little shit!

It was a short time after this that I was driving her back home from another therapy session, and was feeling pretty chatty that day!  I had learned a few new techniques with my paints and was excited to discuss what I had learned with Maple!  She was texting with Travis the whole time and after I had finished raving about my new ideas, she said something that caught me off-guard.

“Yeah… hah… I don’t really care about all that stuff, but you should definitely paint a picture of a fox!  I want a fox painting on my wall!”  

I don’t know if I can identify a SINGLE incident when I realized that something was off in the dynamics of our friendship, but I think that was probably it.  I’m gonna be a bit of a nerd here and reference a pop-culture quote.  There’s a line in “Bojack Horseman” during a break-up scene that goes…

“Y'know, it's funny….. When you look at someone through rose-colored glasses,  all the red flags just look like flags…” 
-Wanda

Amen, hallelujah, goodnight  and Jesus fucking Christ….

I was an idiot and that fox painting statement had knocked those glasses right off of my fat, stupid, fucking face.

Throughout our entire friendship, I was making multiple efforts to develop interests in games, topics and books she had an interest in that I didn’t have any previous experience with, just so I could have new topics to discuss with her as a way to bond.  I made it a point to talk or learn about things I knew she liked.  I made it a point to be more forgiving of her habits because she had a formally diagnosed disorder.  I made it a point to make myself and my life more inclusive to her… She couldn’t even be bothered to ask questions or engage in an active conversation about my new hobby.  I'd noticed traces of this occurring for the last couple of months, but now, I full on felt like I was working an unpaid internship as a P.A. and not hanging out with a friend.  It was almost like she found me annoying as company.   To be perfectly honest….. her behavior was beginning to annoy me and I started feeling stressed over my next visit to Maple. 

One morning, I thought… to myself, “Ugh… I’m hanging out with Maple today.” And immediately felt immensely guilty for having thought that way.  Firstly, why am I feeling guilty over thoughts I haven’t vocalized or enacted, and secondly, this was supposed to be my friend… why do I feel obligated and stressed spending time with someone I’ve chosen to spend time with?

During the next time I drove Maple to therapy I was almost completely silent for the whole drive.  My form of rage isn’t screaming or hitting, it isn’t passive aggressive remarks or insults…  it's a stare, and silence followed by action.  You won’t know I’m viciously angry at you, until I’ve stopped making an attempt to fix it, and started making attempts to remove you from my life.  I'll mention it once or twice in hopes of talking it through, but, I wont go ten miles for someone who won’t step two feet in my direction.  I don’t know if she noticed the lack of noise while she was texting Travis or decided I was less annoying than usual, but she started asking me questions.  She probably suspected something was wrong with me at that point, but I didn’t go into details and just gave her one word  or minimal answers.  The damage was already done.

I didn’t feel good, and I wanted space and time to think about things.  When I went home that night, I decided to write down all of those red flags I’d missed over the years.  Since I didn’t go over every single event here, and this is already getting long as shit, I’ll just share what I can remember of the bullet points of that list with you all.  Some of these happened more than once.  Some quite often in different situations.  Some happened to myself, and sometimes she did these things to other people.  Watching her treat other people like this and trying to play the peacemaker instead of bringing how messed up it was to everyone’s attention is going to forever be my shame.  They didn’t deserve to be treated like that and I should have tried to put a stop to it.

Some behaviors she exhibited that SHOULD have made me realize something was wrong… 

🚩 Borrowed things the owner never got back

🚩Slapped a friend for sabotaging her victory in a board game (the whole play style of the game was a bluff and debate… and, dude…. it's a fucking board game!)

🚩Refused to apologize for literally ANYTHING because she said “the word ‘sorry’ doesn’t mean much to her.”

🚩Would straight up rip other people’s belongings out of their hands because she wanted them.  Usually this was candy, and she would sometimes then proceed to eat the entire bag in front of them.

🚩Would do something selfish, then giggle and say “I'm such a bad friend!” as a “joke"" then give you a smug grin.  (Hmmm…)

🚩Would argue your boundaries.  Try to pressure the ‘No.’ into a ‘…maybe’ and then the ‘maybe into a ‘Yes.’

🚩Engaged in passenger-seat road rage that could have gotten us into trouble.

🚩Tried to reach between my arms to the horn of a car that I was operating.  (I don’t have to explain why that’s dangerous…)

🚩Would lose her temper with people just because she found them “annoying” or didn’t like them

🚩When multiple people tried to call her out for being nasty to someone, she would claim that they were all ‘ganging up on her.’  (Um….no, more than one person just agrees that you’re being a brat.)

🚩Would actively avoid genuinely good media just because someone she didn’t like enjoyed it (…your loss Maple… I still don’t get why you were so obsessed with League of Legends.  I think if I made the active and repetitive decision to enrage myself to THAT hilarious of a degree, THAT often, I would have a massive stroke. )

🚩Would try to 1-up people’s misery, and talk about how her pain is worse than yours

🚩Would use her BPD as an excuse to not apologize for being mean to someone 

🚩Tried to make herself the victim of every situation (Hey… put a pin in that….. let's save that one for later…)

🚩Would damage things she borrowed and not take responsibility for them

I'm probably forgetting some, but you get the point.  I suddenly understood why I avoided conflict with her.  I understood why I was afraid to tell her “no.”  It was the easiest way to avoid outbursts.  Whenever one of these behaviors manifested in the group’s presence there was a noticeable difference in attitude about it.  For me, it was like my own friend was making my day just a little bit more miserable or disregarding something that I found frustrating just because she felt like it or wanted something and I was expected to move past it because “it was just not a big deal.”  For her, it seemed like the effect her actions had on other people were an inconsequential blip or game notification that would change the dialogue,  but wouldn’t really make a big difference in the long run.

“Clementine will remember this.”

Let’s move on to the big blowup…

So, this is about May or June 2016 I think….  I texted Maple (yes, via text… shitty, I know.  I'm an avoidant little brat…) about how I was feeling upset and taken advantage of, and wanted some space.  I also told her that she should take her mother or friend’s daughter to an outing we had planned the next week.  It was a Beauty and the Beast themed cooking class thing, and I told her she should still enjoy the event without me.  She pushed back like crazy on that, because her mother wouldn’t approve of wine being served or some such, and her friend’s daughter was a child who couldn’t drive.  (….so borrow the mom's car like you have before, take the class and don’t drink so you and the kid can enjoy the class and get home safely, dummy…)  She also had several other friends that could have gone to this event with her,  so why was my absence such a problem?

It gets worse… when I started to give her my reasons for why (never got to all of them, mind you…) I was distancing myself from her, she responded with something to the effect of “Oh, so you’re making me out to be the bad guy?”  Here we go… I should’ve guessed.  I didn’t  even get to finish explaining why I was feeling so upset before she just started getting defensive and trying to make excuses for why my problems with her behavior were invalid, actually my fault, and I should drop it.  That was the last straw for me.  I confided in another mutual close friend of ours,  (Male 32) let’s call him …. “Rocky,” about the current situation because I was at a total loss of what to do.  When I told Rocky what was happening, he seemed pretty troubled by it, and I guess he tried to talk to Maple about what was going on.  I still feel bad about dragging Rocky into that mess…   I don’t know what he said to Maple, but soon after, I got a group text that was sent to both Rocky and I from Maple.  Something to the effect of how “…we were ganging up on her and should be ashamed of ourselves.”  I'm paraphrasing here because it was so long ago and those messages were on an old phone that I don’t have anymore.  I do remember one sentence from that long text word-for-word though…

“I'm the victim here!” -Maple

Well said, Maple… I understand now.  So after this happened.  I stopped answering her texts for the rest of the day and after I got home from work, I thought things over and over and over.  If she wanted to see herself as the victim, fine… she could be “the victim.”

I hopped onto my office computer and started to type up a letter.  Again, I don’t remember verbatim what I wrote since this was so long ago. But it was something to the effect of.

“I'm sorry if the way I voiced my opinions made you feel victimized, and if that is the case, I believe the healthiest thing we can do is bring our friendship to a close, go our separate ways, start fresh, and find our own forms of peace.  When I was dealing with abusers in my own life, a permanent no-contact scenario is what I wanted most.”

The kindest parting gift I felt I could give her was a quiet exit so she could live her life the way she wanted with no recourse that was anyone’s fault but her own. 

Exit stage left, radio silence and gone like a ghost in the dead of night.

I printed two copies of this.  One, I stapled to a cardboard box, filled the box with any and all unfinished art projects I had started at her request, and on the way to work the next day, I left the box on her front porch.

Again, probably a bitch-ass move, I’ll admit.  If she was willing to make this about being an attack on her though, I don’t think I want to know what she'd resort to in a private in-person conversation.  When someone has reacted that intensely to me asking them for space before, things have gotten sloppy.

She texted me later that “I should have just had a conversation with her instead of leaving the box on her front porch.""  Maybe, but I didn’t see the point anymore.  She probably would have just tried to flip and reverse it to make all of this about being an attack on her again, turned on the waterworks and tried to emotionally corner me.  Maple also said that she didn’t think the friendship should end over this.  I obviously did, but she was “feeling attacked by a ‘friend’ acting toxic"" but also wants to put this on hold for later and just resume things where they left off once it all cools down.

I now think, from my own perspective, that she wanted things to end up exactly the way she wanted them, and she also wanted to be “morally correct” in the process.  She wanted her perfect life AND to be seen as this martyr who was bestowing mercy upon these poor vicious heathens who had hurt her.  I was just done.  I was hurting and stressed beyond belief and was still expected to pretend I was fine to spare everyone else the guilt.  I've been there before and it's not a nice place…  You know what, Maple?  We’re all a bunch of stupid assholes.  I just decided I’d rather not be a MISERABLE, stupid asshole.

 So, yep… you get to be the victim… poor, poor little mistreated Maple…… I feel terrible for being a big meanie!  I’ll never hurt you again!  Congratulations, goodbye! - Love, the bully!  

Just as an aside, the last text I got from her before we stopped talking was about how she wanted the clothing store coupons in my glove box so she could buy herself a new pair of pants.  That part was just funny to me.

  “Oh, pity me!  Woe!  Woe and misery upon my life! ….also I want new pants.”

Yes, I DID leave the coupons in her mailbox so she supposedly got her pants, and I'm going to straight up confess to an ugly thought I had.  When I dropped those coupons in her mailbox, I said to myself ,  “I hope you shart in those new pants"".  This was her order of priorities, and she was questioning why I wanted to dip like a corn chip… oh, please.  Rip off the bandage and throw it out!

After this mess, I was shocked to find that most of Maple's other friends from the nerd-club had also dropped her like a hot potato!  Keep in mind, the only other person that I had discussed this directly with was Rocky.  I didn’t encourage anyone to cut her off, confront her, or anything like that.  They’d all known Maple for far longer than I had, and if they weren’t willing to cut out a friendship that had gone on for that long, just because of a spat with one specific person, that would be totally valid!  I'm the kind of person who likes to let people come to their own conclusions and make their own choices.  I find it frustrating when people in my life don’t let me make mine after all.  After that, I slowed my correspondence with the entire nerd-club group to take time for myself.  I blocked Maple, never said another word to her and tried to figure out what I was going to do with my time.  

After the first two weeks I stopped having random fits of crying and depression.  After the next couple of months I started talking to others in the friend group again, and after about a year, I stopped thinking about it all together unless something happened that made it necessary.  These days, my feelings about Maple could be described as indifferent I guess.  She’s living her life, I’m living mine.  So far as I’ve heard from mutuals, Travis came for his visit in July 2016, and he and Maple were married a couple of months later.  That’s about all I know, and I’m not really interested in knowing more.

I created a Facebook account in about 2017 to make it easier to stay in contact with distant family and friends.  Maple popped up in my recommendations, and I blocked her because I had no interest in what she was getting up to, nor did I want her snooping or randomly messaging me.  Later, Travis popped up, and I blocked him too so he couldn’t middleman any personal information to her.  

She knew where I worked too and would make it a point to come in to shop from time to time.   I thought I’d made it clear that I didn’t want to associate with her anymore and yet, back she kept coming!  This was a fabric store by the way.   The city where she supposedly moved to had the same fabric store.  An even bigger location to boot, so why she felt the need to come to the location where I worked was beyond me.  I just avoided her, and if I was forced to interact with her, I kept the fake flat customer service smile, kept it brief, to the point and didn’t chit-chat.  What more can you do though, right?  “Customer service!”  The interaction always puzzled me.  She would see me and make a face that suggested that she was pleasantly surprised… Like, “Oh, wow!  What a surprise to see you here in your place of work, River!”  Fortunately,  I quit that job two years ago and am now employed elsewhere, so she no longer knows where I work.  It's a warehouse as well, so there isn’t any direct public interface involved with the job and you need a badge to get in, so she can’t make any surprise visits even if she does find out where it is!

  For those of you wondering what I did with the second copy of the box letter, I burned it.  I also threw in a stuffed fox Maple had crocheted, and a photo album of a vacation we'd had together that she'd gifted me.  I was, and am still determined to not let myself fall back into a painful situation due to nostalgia and the good memories we did have together.  Sugar coated cyanide is still cyanide. 

8It's been years since the Big BFF Break-Up!  Specifically 6 or 7, I think.   Anyways,  life’s been great for the most part!  There’s the ups and downs of someone with trauma and mental stress, and I’ve had the usual feelings of self-doubt pursuing my dream job, but on the whole, I’m doing pretty well!  I’ve got that new job, I've been making plans to go into business for myself, I tried going back to school (Covid threw a wrench in that one again…. Ha-ha, maybe someday I’ll get that degree! …..) and I've been learning all kinds of new skills.  I've taken up other forms of art such as sculpting and watercolor painting, digital art, sewing, woodworking, resin work, creative writing, and soap making!  I’m looking into learning how to animate next!  It’s really nice to have the time to engage in all of these things!  Having all the outlets for self expression is really wonderful and the popularity of my work in my local area has picked up to the point that I really  believe that if I’m smart about my methods,  I can make a go of it.  I feel like a better version of myself, and not just some half-dead extension of Maple!  We're in 2024 now.

That brings us to mid March 2024…. So what happened? 

Maple tried to contact me!  I couldn’t believe what I was seeing!  I thought when the notification had popped in, maybe one of my friends had just sent me a meme, goofy comment or a Pinterest pic, but when I opened the Messenger app I was dumbfounded!   I told Rocky (…yes, he and I are still buds!) what’d just happened and told him I was at a loss for words.  

So what was the message?  This one I have on my phone now,  so I can actually provide it word for word with the names changed….

“Hi River, for years I have wanted to reach out, but never had the courage.  Your friendship meant a lot to me and I am still not sure what exactly happened between us.  I would love to reconnect if possible.  I understand if this is not something you want and won't push it.  I just needed to make one last attempt on a friendship that meant the world to me.  Sincerely,  Maple”

At first I was kind of creeped out and disgusted… then I was mad.

I left her on “read"" and blocked her on Messenger without responding.  I was under the impression that FB and Messenger were two parts of the same monster and that the FB block would just roll over to the app but, maybe not?  I suspect it to be the case though, because now, I have multiple accounts on my blocked list under Maple’s name.  This seems to insinuate that she made a new account  JUST to bypass my block!  I’m really confused and kind of concerned.  I haven’t spoken to her in 7 years nor indicated to any mutuals that I wanted to be contacted by her!  Why now is she reaching out?  I've had a stalker incident before that started in a similar manner after years of no contact, so I’m side-eyeing that Messenger app soooo hard right now…  

I didn’t want to verbally respond, because I didn’t want to string her into the hope of resumed communication in any capacity, whether it be frequent or not, even if just to tell her again NOT to contact me anymore.  I don’t want any correspondence whatsoever with her.

I'm also unsure of her motives and how much current information she has on me.  I don’t have any details on her life because it just wasn’t a concern to me, and I don’t need or want to know.  But the fact that she's crawled out of the woodwork a whole 7 years later makes me think she wants something or is after something specific.  Has she been using an alt or friend’s account to keep tabs?  Is something in her life going south and she now wants to try to re-forge prior connections so she has something to fall back on?  Is she overly curious now that she can’t snoop on me in the fabric store?  Is she desperate enough to try something underhanded?  She still claims to be ignorant as to why I cut contact with her and seems to be more concerned with recovering the friendship than understanding why I felt it had to end.  My suspicion is that she hasn’t changed and never will.

I feel like she is coasting along looking for whatever person will give her whatever attention or validation she's wanting at the moment and now she's trying to resort to me because she doesn’t have another option, but I’m more than okay with being alone, and after everything I’ve been through, my personal space from her is preferable.  

I hate to say it so bluntly, but I feel like that message she sent was kind of manipulative, love bomb-y and gross sounding.  Call me a pessimist if you want… I get it.  She said she doesn’t understand what happened between us that made me want to end the friendship,  but when I was trying to explain it to her all those years ago, she tried to throw it all back in my face and didn’t want to accept there was a problem.  From my experience, people who make excuses for their actions are usually looking for excuses to continue the behavior.  It doesn’t stop because they don’t want it to.

It's like talking to a contrarian.  You can’t tell a flat earther that the world is round because they just don’t want to accept the evidence you give them.  If someone is willing to resort to sticking their fingers in their ears and shouting  “LA-LA-LA-LA-LA” to avoid hearing themselves being proven wrong, well that’s just kind of it.

So, I’m hoping for some input from others who have experienced something similar.  She's disrespected my request for no-contact by showing up at my place of work and trying to interact, and now that doing that isn’t an option because I don’t work at the fabric store anymore, she's trying to contact me directly with some sappy sick DM.  She says she’s “not going to push it if it's not something I want""  but she’s already pushed it more than once by coming into my place of work and now directly DMing me!  I'm hoping that she'll take the silence as a continuation of my first request to stop contact, and that will be the end of it, but I don’t know if something in her personal life is causing her to suddenly start acting out, or if she’s just THAT bored or desperate.  A couple of blessed and hopeless positivity redemption-arch family members have told me that I’m being too fridged.

When I used Slinda last month, I only got slight spotting during my placebo days and my OB said this was normal for Slinda users.

Though now, I stopped taking pills and my OB didn’t let me take the placebo pills for the 2nd pack because I had to get other checkups done because of other health conditions.

I've had GERD before and I feel like it was triggered with me constantly drinking coke and coffee on the same day. so syempre i’m still scared because lately i always have the urge to vomit and idk if its triggered by GERD or something else.

last unprotected sex was Nov 16 but before that it was Oct 25-26. had light spotting on November 2-4 due to the pill. never missed a pill, only would be late for a few hours from time to time but never missed a pill.

I've been using a Picopresso with an IMS basket and AeroPress with an Able Fine Disk metal filter during my travels.

The AeroPress gives me a really gritty cup with a metal filter, while the Picopresso delivers a superfine cup which also has a metal basket of course.

Why is that? Just curious. And can I solve it?

One more question, If I get an AeroPress flow control cap and use it with the Able Fine Disk, will I see any significant change or improvement in my brew?

Just wondering how did you start your dc on tea or coffee. DS refuses to try either ! It doesn't matter but I feel bad for him that he never has a hot drink . Maybe I didn't push it on him early enough . DD used to spend time at my parents and she always wanted tea if they had it so they'd give her a weak milky cup.

I thought the problem was in the coffee beans itself or my machines at home, but also been suffering from this when drinking coffee from cafes.
