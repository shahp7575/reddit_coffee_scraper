1hjqw2c,https://www.reddit.com/r/spinalcordinjuries/comments/1hjqw2c/i_like_my_posts_the_way_i_like_my_coffee_dark/,I like my posts the way I like my coffee- dark,"I’ve lost friends to pedestrian accidents, drug overdose, mysterious circumstances, and another one to a car accident. All in their early 20s. Life is certainly fragile. I’m just not sure if death is indisputably the worst outcome. Of course I miss those friends and love them, and I still grieve them regularly. But if I had to choose, I wouldn’t have wanted to see them suffer indefinitely as an alternative to dying. 

For me and many others, paralysis is indefinite suffering. I’m not coming way out of left field with that opinion. Many people would choose to rather die. Others will take life in whatever form they can get it. At times I am certainly grateful. But the sad truth is there’d be no suffering without there being consciousness. I know it’s a little hard to fathom but if you’re not conscious of the fact that you’re dead then you wouldn’t care that you’re dead. And everyone dies. Whether you’re an infant with a rare congenital disease or someone who lives to be 110 with a near-perfect healthy track record. It’s inescapable. I don’t think it’s as horrible as everyone seems to imagine it to be but then again I haven’t died lol. Maybe it’s even more fucked up than this but I certainly hope not.

I think when we die that’s it. We’re dead and it’s over. I never used to think about death but now I consider the thought of it often. I suppose being faced with your own mortality does that. At least for me. I’m glad you’re grateful for life, seriously. I don’t mean that in a sarcastic way. I wish I had the same gratitude. Prior to my accident, I very much enjoyed life. I had difficulties like anyone else but otherwise I was dealt a pretty good hand. After becoming paralyzed, I find that gratitude hard to attain. 

I’m not depressed. I know depression very well as I have battled it for half of my life and have mostly overcome it. As a matter of fact I still see much beauty in life. I have a strong urge to get up and do all the things that bring me great joy in life. The issue is that I can’t, and that is the true tragedy of this injury- You gain the perspective of someone who died and came back to life with a newfound appreciation for it…but what good is that appreciation for it if the things you appreciate can no longer be taken advantage of? This is for those in this community that are simply written off as being depressed whenever you have an outcry against the torturous cage that you’ve been placed in. For many, I’m sure depression is the main issue. But I think it’s possible to pragmatically want to die because of this injury. I’m in that camp. Upon further examination- This life is not worth living to me. That assertion is based on the things in my life that I find valuable. ",1,1734840588.0,spinalcordinjuries,0,1.0,False

Emerging Brain Research Confirms His Point","[Daniel Oberhaus ](https://preview.redd.it/39t15lv1qb8e1.jpg?width=2240&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=11ac58f991dac45a754bee275f54f0d9044903e3)

Tim Cook of Apple and Indra Nooyi of Pepsi are just two of many CEOs who brag about their rigorous morning rituals. Not Jeff Bezos. It is well-known that the founder of Amazon spends the early hours of each day engaged in... puttering?

# Bezos follows a morning routine devoid of screens.

When Bezos spoke to the Economic Club of Washington in 2018, he detailed his typical morning ritual. As part of his routine, he has breakfast with his loved ones, reads the paper, and drinks coffee. Do you know what is missing from his ""puttering time""? Looking at his phone.

In a recent interview with People, Bezos’s fiancée, Lauren Sanchez, verified her boyfriend is devoted to lazy mornings, adding, “We don’t get on our phones. That’s one of the rules.”

For the first hour after waking up, why does Bezos forbid the use of screens? His one-hour rule is perhaps somewhat based on his own preferences. We’re all wired differently when it comes to our shifting energy levels and tolerance for stimulus, and experts claim we function best when our routines respect our individual cycles rather than resisting them.

But Bezos thinks his puttering doesn’t only help him appreciate life more. In the same 2018 address, he argued his slow-burn, phone-free mornings increase his energy levels and decision-making skills all day long.

The newest neurobiology says he’s on to something with this assertion. Less online mornings lead to wiser, healthier days, and new data strongly indicates more of us should borrow Bezos’s one-hour rule.

# This is your brain on too much screen time.

The negative effects of scrolling on your phone in bed for an hour one morning would be minimal. But if it becomes a habit, day after day, month after month, this behavior may take a toll,” Maris Loeffler, of the Stanford Lifestyle Medicine Program, explains in a recent blog post from the program.

Phones are a pervasive aspect of contemporary life. You can’t avoid them, and you may very easily overdo it. The Stanford piece puts together a series of very terrifying new discoveries from neuroscience on what happens when you spend too much time in front of a screen. They include:

* One research study demonstrating greater usage of screens among adults may affect learning, memory, and mental health.
* Another research indicated that those who watched TV for five hours or more each day had an elevated chance of acquiring brain-related disorders like dementia or Parkinson’s.
* Yet more research revealing that persons who participate in two or more hours of screen usage each day outside work had reduced gray matter capacity in their brains.

Adding to the harmful impacts on the brain, excessive screen time has also been related to eye issues, poor sleep, and back discomfort. All in all, it’s a rather bleak picture of what our communal phone fixation is doing to our brains and bodies.

“Passive screen time is like eating sugar but for your brain. It ‘tastes’ nice, and you want it immediately, but you’re not truly feeding yourself. You’re not providing your brain any nutrition,” Loeffler sums up.

# What to do in the morning instead of glancing at your phone

What is her and other experts’ main tip to help us all keep our screen usage within safe limits? None other than Bezos’s one-hour rule.

“Stanford Lifestyle Medicine experts recommend no screen time for the first hour of the day,” the blog post bluntly advises, presenting a menu of alternative activities that are healthier for your brain during the first hour of your day (I’ve provided links to further information about the advantages of each):

* Exercise
* Call a friend or family member.
* Prepare a nutritious breakfast.
* Meditate
* Listen to music
* Create a gratitude list
* Read a book
* Spend time outdoors and get early light.

“How do you want your day’s energy and mood to start?” Loeffler asks. “Intentionally implementing a morning routine that reflects lifestyle medicine choices instead of screen time sets a positive tone for the day and supports brain health and cognitive enhancement.”

Which would come as no surprise to Jeff Bezos. He’s been applying neuroscience’s best practices for a brain-boosting morning routine for years. Maybe more of us should put down our phones in the morning and do the same.",1,1734840048.0,u_wiso2017,0,1.0,False

As I transition from the nocturnal rhythms of night shift work to two weeks among the ""day walkers,"" I find myself both intrigued and apprehensive about this unfamiliar world. The stark reality of daylight hours presents unique challenges: navigating a sunlit schedule, adapting to conversations before my usual waking hours, and encountering a peculiar cheerfulness that seems pervasive among early risers.

I must admit, this shift in reality feels like entering an entirely different culture. The concept of “breakfast” at what feels like an unnatural hour is perplexing, the bustle of morning traffic will be overwhelming, and the expectation to be alert and functional in broad daylight is... daunting.

To those that have experiences of the day-to-day routines of the daylight world, I seek your wisdom:

Will I have to converse and potentially adopt forced happiness?

How do you acclimate to mornings without feeling disoriented?

What is the secret to managing the seemingly endless interactions and distractions of the day?

How does one maintain energy and focus when sunlight feels more like an interrogation lamp than a source of vitality?

Will items in shops no longer be reduced due to the time of day? 

Any advice on surviving this two-week immersion into daytime living would be greatly appreciated. Rest assured, I am taking precautions: sunglasses are at the ready, my coffee supply is secured, and I am prepared to face this challenge head-on.

I will journal my time/experiences and place it in a discoverable area. I will also send a USB stick per day to a trusted journalist in the event I perish.

The first step in your teeth whitening journey is to identify the type of staining you have. Tooth discoloration can be caused by a variety of factors, such as:

- Age: Over time, teeth naturally darken.
- Diet: Foods and drinks like coffee, red wine, and berries can stain teeth.
- Tobacco use: Smoking or chewing tobacco leads to significant staining.
- Dental treatments: Some treatments, like root canals or certain fillings, can alter the color of teeth.

Once you've pinpointed the cause of your discoloration, you can explore different whitening treatments available in San Antonio. Here are the primary options:

- **In-Office Whitening:** This is one of the most effective methods. A dental professional applies a concentrated whitening solution directly to your teeth. Utilizing a special light, the process is accelerated, typically resulting in multiple shades lighter within a single session. Many San Antonio dentists offer this service, ensuring you get optimal results in just an hour or two.
- **At-Home Kits:** For those who prefer a more gradual approach, at-home whitening kits can be very effective. These usually come with trays that mold to your teeth and a whitening gel. Depending on the brand and concentration, you’ll wear them for a specified amount of time each day, often for a couple of weeks. Make sure to consult with your dentist before starting any kit to ensure it's safe for you.
- **Whitening Toothpaste:** This is the simplest method but also the least effective for deep stains. Whitening toothpaste contains mild abrasives or gentle chemicals that help remove surface stains. If you're looking for a maintenance option after more intensive whitening, this can be a good choice.
- **Whitening Strips:** These are thin, flexible plastic strips coated with a whitening gel. They can be found over-the-counter and are easy to apply. Many users see noticeable results after a few weeks, but results may vary based on the severity of the staining.

Before jumping into any whitening treatment, consider your dental health. If you have cavities or gum disease, it's important to get these issues addressed first. A dental exam can help determine if you’re a good candidate for teeth whitening treatments.

Another factor to consider is your budget. In-office treatments can be pricier, but they often deliver immediate results. At-home methods are generally more accessible financially. Don’t forget to factor in the longevity of the results, too. In-office treatments often leave you with a longer-lasting smile than over-the-counter options.

After deciding on a treatment, maintaining your bright smile is crucial. Here are some tips:

- Practice good oral hygiene by brushing and flossing regularly.
- Limit stain-causing foods and beverages such as coffee, tea, and dark sodas.
- Visit your dentist for regular cleanings and check-ups.
- Consider touch-up treatments as needed to maintain your results.

Ultimately, the key to successful teeth whitening is finding a treatment that fits your goals and lifestyle. If you're uncertain about what might work best for you, schedule a consultation with a qualified dental professional in San Antonio. They can provide personalized recommendations based on your clinical and cosmetic needs.

1hjqjjt,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1hjqjjt/i_know_why_people_are_disappearing/,I Know Why People are Disappearing,"Feedback is welcome! The realm will include other stories.

This is Dev Johnson formerly living in Wisconsin, born in Ohio. I have a message out there. I know why people are disappearing. It happened to me, as well. No, I wasn’t abducted in the traditional sense, as some people have claimed. The truth of recent events is far worse than you see.

Please, for your sake and humanity’s survival, listen to what I have to say. I will tell you things beyond belief, but they aren’t easy to swallow. But if you don’t, you will be blindsided to the danger that is coming.

It started when I went into work. There were signs that offered prizes to anyone that showed up to a mansion party. I wasn’t a social owl, so I originally was going to skip it, despite the absurd bonuses offered to those that showed up. I figured that meant there were another set of layoffs, but when I confronted the CEO, Frank, he let out a nervous laugh, “No, no, Dev! Nothing like that. I just want everyone here to feel valued. And you all should get to know the new team members. If you promise to go you can have the rest of the day off.”

I’ll put it this way. He was letting people go all the time, even when we surpassed quotas and our clients’ expectations, so why the fuck is he being such a generous boss all-of-a-sudden? It wasn’t adding up, and I was about to tell him that I’d just do my ten for the day and leave.

However, I was approached by a tall, blonde woman, Carmille, who tried to convince me to go. There was something I didn’t understand at the time, but she and the other new people looked too perfect. Almost like an android manufactured from a cyberpunk movie, not to mention each one over 6 feet tall. Still, there were some hot women going, including a few of her peers, and I never had a good excuse to leave my small house. I was a hermit, you might say, living in a state of perpetual solitude. But I wanted to change that.

Still, something didn’t add up. I decided to call a friend, but he wasn’t particularly helpful. 

“Yup! You’re all getting canned, Johnson! Hate to break it to you,” that wasn’t exactly the input I was looking for.

“Then who are these other people? How experienced are these models? Something doesn’t add up,” I replied.

“I don’t know man, but you said the woman winked. I know she tall, but who cares?”

“Easy for your 6’4 ass to say,” he laughed at my response.

“Treat yourself, man! What’s the worst that could happen,” his would come back to bite me in the ass soon enough, but I was unaware of just how large this problem was.

“Thanks! Hopefully, I’m just being paranoid, but if I am getting laid off, a night out might not be so bad.”

“See, just start filling out applications the next day when they break the news,” he said and I chuckled.

That afternoon I bought protein pasta, chicken, and rice. I also snagged some Trojans and wine. Who knows what would happen? There were other women I barely talked to, so I decided this was the time to break out of my bubble.

Give a bit of space.

Frank's home was marked by a huge gate with a long driveway. I’ll say it was anything but modest. Now my anxiety was stronger than ever, wondering what this was about. I was beginning to think we were going to be scammed, but that seemed a bit much. Despite my reservations, I drove to the house. The snow had melted, so there was no problem. I was one of the first ones, again. At least there was no trouble parking here. Strangely, I remember Frank having pictures of him and his family outside his house and I could’ve sworn this wasn’t it. Was this a wealthier CEO’s place he knew? There was an unreasonable amount of parking space, even for a wealthy family. Then again, it wouldn’t have been the first time a rich family bought far more than they needed.

Still gawking, I followed a man waving towards the left side near a large lot. Past the side was a pool with a diveboard, two boats, and a few cars. Nice of the owner to move his expensive stuff in the dirt. I had to be overthinking this whole thing.

So I relaxed, let the man guide me back, and parked my car. I smiled and waved and he returned the gesture. He appeared to be anxious, but it wasn’t a big deal.

After leaving putting on only my favorite cologne and combing my hair, I passed a few strangers and entered the house. My first order of business was to drink something to calm my nerves. Second was to look for people I knew, especially Russell, Joyce, or Mac. Mac didn’t come to the office much, but he was a solid guy. Also, a Marine that I could shit talk with.

I had found wine, cheese of all assortments, and delicious steak bites that I’d happily helped myself to. If this was my last day on the job, I was going to get everything I could. You might say, “You’re not working,” but I’d argue that anytime I have to see the faces of my coworkers is me working. Excluding the previously mentioned. Funny enough, I couldn’t even see the tall blonde from earlier. Just as I was about to message Russell and Mac, a young redhead approached me, smiling. Her stare almost pierced my soul with green eyes. Eyes that I would’ve sworn transformed to slits for a moment.

“Hello! I have not met you, yet. Dev, is it?” She asked in a nice, but odd tone. She also had the same accent as Carmille. Not Slavic, Italian, Romanian, or Japanese. I’d heard quite a few in my thirty years and this seemed truly foreign to me. Almost alien.

“Carmille told you?” I asked.

“Yes! Yes, she did!” she reached her hand out, “call me Lilith!”

I chuckled, taking her hand, “Lilith, I don’t suppose you know what this is all about?”

“About what?” she asked giving me a confused look.

“This party and, well, everything. It’s not usual. At least, I’ve never seen a CEO invite his employees, and offer a 10K bonus while providing wine, steak, and cheese,” I remembered just how insane this all was, making me reconsider staying here. At the very least I decided to stop indulging in the wine.

“I don’t know. Carmille invited me, though I was playing Road of Exiles and watching corgi videos before I arrived here,” she said.

“One, Corgis are adorable and I want a couple. Two, I just started playing it again. Early access comes out this coming month.”

“I would love to play it sometime. Maybe you could make me a better player,” her words made me question so much. Was she implying what I thought she was?

After some more chatting, she gave me a number. The reason I say it’s a number instead of her number is because it wasn’t a real number. 666-1289. When I asked if the area code was the same as the area, she seemed confused, but eventually answered with a yes.

More and more guests piled in. Only a handful, however, were from my job. I asked a woman where her friends worked and she asked if I was invited, like I was a weirdo. All I wanted to do was to get an idea of where everyone was coming from, but I gave up. When I looked for someone I actually wanted to talk to, I noticed the stares of other tall and oddly perfect people. They are what I imagined an android to look like. One moment they’d converse with the guests, the next they’d scan the crowd like a cat would a field of mice. One of them licked his lips standing behind a decent-looking fellow that struck me as a sales and business guy. I turned to look behind me and there she was.

“Mr. Dev. How are you this evening?”

“I was just about to leave, to be honest, but nice to see you,” I lied out of my teeth.

By this time I had realized that there were two groups. Us and these strange people. I felt an urge to run. To leave this house, get in my car, and drive away.

“You can’t! The party is about to begin. Frank will be here any minute, now with your reward,” the way she said that felt inhuman.

“Okay. I’ll stay,” I replied.

Her grin became wide. Almost unnaturally so, “Good! I promise this will be an unforgettable night.”

I nodded with a smile, then turned around. I had absolutely no intention of staying. I just wanted her off my case. However, before I made it to the door, Russell flagged me down, possibly drawing attention I didn’t want.

“How’s the night, Dev?” he asked.

“Russell, something’s not right here. I think we should leave immediately.”

“I can’t! I met a woman and,” he turned his words to whispers, “I think I might be onto something.”

“Oh, yeah? You know her name?” I asked hoping it wasn’t one of the perfect people.

“Lilith,” he smiled. “She said she didn’t know anyone, so I introduced her to a few people, even the woman from this morning.”

My heart dropped. Everything seemed more wrong than ever, but I still couldn’t put my finger on what was about to happen. “Carmille,” I replied, slowly.

“Yep! That’s her name! I keep forgetting it,” he said. “She also loves cats and The Expanse of Space.”

“Russell. She told me she likes Corgis. I’ve been looking into getting one or two for the past week. You like cats. She’s also interested in things, I’m sorry, most women do not like. Also, there are others like her that look too,” I struggled to finish my sentence, but he noticed what I was saying.

“Perfect. Too perfect,” he replied. We looked at each other before looking towards the door.

“I still have my Glock in the car, Russell. Follow me to my car. I’ll drop you off next to your car then we can drive the fuck outta here,” I said and he nodded.

When we got to the exit, those men and women stared at us. Smiling. If you thought a McDonald’s employee's smile was fake, you haven’t seen anything yet. It creeped me out enough to pick up my pace. Russell followed my lead without hesitation. We exited into the night. Men began to trail us. I pulled my coworker to the right. As we picked up our pace, they did theirs. By the time we passed the first set of cars, we were power walking to my vehicle.

“Get in my car and I’ll get us out of here,” I told him.

“My car’s closer, Dev. I should just go to mine and you yours,” I didn’t like the idea of separating, but I didn’t have time to debate or think.

“Alright. Go!” I responded.

He began veering to the left, as did one of our pursuers. Then I noticed them. There were a dozen or so people surrounding the lot. And the house. Russell pressed the unlock button for his car, but the man sprinted towards Russell. That run was like no other I had ever seen. I wasn’t even sure if we had been running so much as gliding after a point. I didn’t bother to look behind me. I just ran, hoping to make it to my car in time. Then I panicked. I didn’t have a round in the chamber. I focused as I closed the distance to my car. The chasing footsteps behind me disappeared, and then a scream erupted.

“Help,” Russell cried.

I wanted to help, but I couldn’t stop. I slowed down just to grab the door handle. As soon as the door opened, I reached into my side seat and pulled the gun. I reached to remove the holster still attached, but the thing pulled me away. The thing’s face changed. Its teeth were now razor sharp.

“Where are you going, human?” After he finished taunting me, his mouth opened, darting towards my neck.

But not before I chambered a round and began firing. The first rounds were in the chest. The last four rounds were placed in his skull while I pushed my gun from under his head. Though he dropped to the ground, his chest wounds were healing. At that point, I was shivering and my nerves were firing on all cylinders as I struggled to get inside my car. That’s when all the creatures began to converge. My foot hit the brake then I turned the key. As I put my car in reverse, I reached into my glove compartment for another magazine, preferably the one with ten rounds.

My car tilted and grazed a few others in my attempt to escape. Screams erupted from inside the mansion. Tears were flowing down my eyes. I couldn’t help them. I wanted to, but I couldn’t. That’s when one of those things ran into my car, causing it to spin before flipping in the air. I held onto my gun for dear life feeling it was my only chance of making it out alive. Everything after that became dark.

The first thing I remember from when I regained consciousness was a salty smell. One vaguely familiar. Once my eyes opened, I saw the reason for this extreme stench. It was blood. An arm in front of me. I felt sick. My body was already weak, but this was almost too much. I closed my eyes for a moment to help myself cope, processing the events that had transpired. I took a deep breath.

“Alas, he is awake,” I knew that voice all too well by now.

“Fuck you,” I said. Then I remembered hearing Russell scream, “Where’s Russell?”

“He was an appetizer before the feast,” she replied in a disgustingly seductive manner.

“So you’re just going to eat people?”

“What can we do? There’s got to be something-” I man pleaded, but was cut off quickly.

“Please! We will do anything to save ourselves. That’s what your leaders said. Just before we had lunch,” she said followed by the creatures laughing.

“Then why are we still alive?” a woman asked.

I don’t know why she asked that. Probably fear and panic, but I had no desire to find out. Unfortunately, none of us were that lucky.

“You shall be sent to our reality at midnight, darling. There, you’ll see absolute beauty!” she replied like a mad woman on a high.

I wasn’t restrained, but my glock was gone. I had no idea how I would escape. My mind began to race with all sorts of ideas. I couldn’t have imagined what awaited on the other side and if I had known, I would’ve fought tooth and nail against those creatures.

Another said something in another language. It fit their accents perfectly, but I swore it wasn’t a language made by humans.

“Are you vampires? Aliens?” I asked, trying to stall.

She chuckled and ignored my question, responding in the language.

Looking around me, I saw at least a few dozen people. Granted, evidence all around us said some met a grisly end, but they spared most of us. Though I hated the question a minute ago, I was beginning to wonder what they had blamed for us. Looking around I saw more blood, limbs, vomit, smashed furniture, and those vampires staring at us. Everything except a weapon. I just realized I killed one with rounds to the head. But he could’ve healed. Then again, bullets to the head make more sense than a stake to the heart. I wasn’t sure what I should use, but I could snag a piece of a wood table leg broken off. Then I saw a kitchen knife against my leg.

I realized looking around I couldn’t retrieve it just yet or one of those things would notice. Unfortunately, Carmille began a ritualistic chant, cutting her henchman’s throat before tossing it into a weird mist. It absorbs the creature, and then explodes everywhere. Some sort of particles fly outward, sending a dry warmth everywhere. A whole wall formed in front of us. When I noticed the vampires were looking at the portal, I grabbed the knife, and tucked it into my sleeve. People were being lifted on their feet before being dragged to the entrance.

Though I desperately didn’t want to go through, I waited for the right moment to strike, but it never came. One of them began pushing me forward and I didn’t know if I could take him, let alone the others. Once at the edge, my skin began to tingle in pain. I turned while pulling the knife, but one of them kicked me through.

To anyone listening, my name is Devin Johnson. We are being hunted by a creatures that were made to infiltrate our race, but what’s coming is nothing short of world-ending. We need to eliminate them and close the breaches they’ve been opening across our world. I know all this sounds crazy and out of nowhere, but listen to my story before you write me off. What I will tell you might save your life and those important to you.

I’m assuming you've heard about the disappearances worldwide, unless you’ve lived under a rock the past year. The earliest accounts originated in Russia near someplace called Dachnyye Istochniki. If you look it up on the internet, the location was removed from any search engine. Obviously, no one took it seriously, except the Russians. They declared martial law and a ceasefire when odd reports of abductions by mysterious people came in. Some of these reports include them flying away with their victims. That’s around the time the first video dropped. Problem was, well, it was dark. Pitch black. But you could still hear the screams. Many speculated they were added in, but the spatial audio and changes when the device was dropped were disturbingly realistic. Then unnatural howls drowned every other sound. They were unlike anything I’d ever imagined coming from animals or humans. If you listened closely, you could barely make out a man pleading for mercy. Russians living abroad said they lost all contact with anyone they knew 30 miles around the area.

Well, it wouldn’t be long until what happened there happened here.

I made two cups of coffee to force myself out the door. I drank one, taking the other in a thermal cup then entered the Wisconsin winter wonderland. I thought Ohio had it bad in my 20’s, but global warming seemed to have forgotten this state, entirely. That being said, I actually didn’t mind. I had been living in Cincinnati after my contract with the Army when I decided to peace out for the second time. Now I'm a software developer that was finally approved to work from home. All, except for Mondays. Sadly, it was Monday. That meant attending a team meeting we could have done online because our company and my project manager thought face-to-face interactions were “healthy.” I’d normally agree, but considering my lazy team members did more tweeting than work at work, I really didn’t have anything I wanted to say that I could in a professional capacity.

I hated everything. The fake friendliness, pizza or group parties, and the “we’re family here” that implies I wanted another one. Truth be told, I should be grateful, but almost everyone seemed so fake. So lifeless. Everything felt like it was HR approved before it was spoken. No one could be offended or good luck when they let you go on the next set of lay-offs.

When I headed out the door, it was still fairly dark and snowing. With my coffee in one hand and my laptop bag over my shoulder, I pushed onward toward my glorious ride, an HR-V 2016.

I walked to my parking space to reach the door. Before I opened it, something brushed against my back. I immediately turned with a bit of my coffee leaving my mug. There was nothing. I looked right, left, right again, then decided I was going crazy. My car wasn’t warm, yet, though I immediately pressed the brake and button to start it. My air was already on max from the previous my last time driving it blew out cold air just to reignite my shivering. I had become accustomed to warmer and humid climates. This winter and all was beautiful, as long as I didn’t have to leave to confide in my small, cozy house. Just as I put the car into reverse, a weird noise came from the trees. It sounded like a howl of some kind, but raspy and freakishly weird. Then I saw something. It seemed like a mist, but I couldn’t tell. It didn’t matter. My house was locked and I didn’t have much to steal. I also had cameras installed at every corner around the house, with two more inside. If anyone snooped around, let alone broke in I’d have everything I needed to identify them. Unless they wore ski masks and acted quickly.

After overthinking and worrying, I decided to quickly run in and get my Glock 43 looked around, then jumped back in. I finally left my long gravel driveway and onto the road. It was odd, though. I still felt like I was being watched, but I was driving. There were no other cars around.

I had left early, as usual. It was an old habit and a hard to break even if I wanted to. But at least that meant I could relax when I arrived and make myself another cup of coffee. A friend of mine always told me my addiction to caffeine would be the death of me. I’ve learned that there are far worse ways for one’s life to end. But that hadn’t crossed my mind yet. I was concerned about parking closest to the exits so I could be one of the first to leave the corporate office. It was just outside of the downtown area.

“Good morning,” I greeted the secretary before scanning in.

“Good morning, Dev.” She replied kindly.

I returned a smile and nod before heading to the elevator. I remember there were balloons with all sorts of prizes. One sign said, “Party Tonight at Frank’s Family Home! Win up to $100,000. Earn $10,000 for showing you care for the WinTyme family!” I stopped, reread it, then read it another dozen or so times before I chuckled at the absurdity of the company’s CEO offering ten thousand dollars to EVERY single person who showed up. I knew there had to be a catch, but what was it? There’s no way anything this good would just be handed out. I know some people in my position are spoiled and have absolutely no concept of money, just buying a new car and iPhone every year. But I did. At least, I’d like to think so. And there’s no way our CEO would’ve done this out of the goodness of his heart. Two years ago was our best year and he laid off anyone with 15 years of work experience at the company.

I took the elevator up three floors and was excited to find even more weirdness that I didn’t understand. A sign hung from the ceiling with rushed print, “Take off today if you sign up to come tonight.”

Okay, something was up. I suspected we were all getting laid off. There were outings here and there, but this was a full-on shutdown if I’ve ever seen one. I muttered curses just thinking of applying for another job. Thankfully the house I bought was a fixer-upper or my money would run up dry faster than I could get another job. Health insurance wasn’t a huge worry for me since I did have the VA to a small extent, but- fuck this shit.

Me being early, there’s usually Russell from another team and Joyce, an older project manager who was far smarter than you’d initially assume. At least, more than I realized. She notices the dirtbags, the backstabbers, and the good workers, but she keeps it to herself. It wasn’t until she gave a bonus only to Russell. He was the only one who finished his work, taking on other tasks depending on how far behind the others were. The other team members talked like they were the smartest and hardest working people in the department, but I could see Gloria on her Twitter and Facebook anytime I passed her desk.

So those two weren’t a surprise to see here. What was a surprise, however, were the four women and three men in the big boss’s office. He was there, too, and I swore I could see watery eyes. Was he crying?

One woman's head turned sharply towards me with her eyes piercing into my own. I began to feel similar to how I had this morning. It would’ve triggered every alarm in my mind if she hadn’t formed a long smile, showing white teeth that seemed impossible for a normal person to have. I forced a nob and then continued towards my desk. Before I sat down, my phone beeped. Once seated, I opened it.

Russell texted, “Frank had been crying before I arrived. See the 10,000-dollar prize for showing up to his party?”

Right now nothing made sense. An odd urge told me I’d be better off leaving, but I couldn’t. I needed a job and money. Hell, if they were going to lay us off, I’d want that 10k, assuming no stipulations were attached. If I had known.

 “What are the chances we are all getting laid off,” I texted, then added, “most of us, at least.”

Though I was tempted to look over, I waited for his response, seeing he was already typing.

His next message had me puzzled, “Frank just told Joyce he brought on three new employees and wasn’t letting anyone go until next year. She said most teams aren’t in any position to lay any members off, though I think a couple in mine wouldn’t be missed.”

I thought for a moment before responding, “But that doesn’t explain the money rewards and party.” I sent it right after the office door cracked.

Frank formed a big smile, but his eyes were still slightly red. “Mornin’, Dev! Today’s gonna be a great day!”

Bewildered and uncertain which of my dozen questions I should’ve asked first, I decided to nod and go straight to the point, while leaving out his crying, “Why the rewards celebration, Frank? Are we getting cut?”

I really shouldn’t have just asked, but he chuckled at the question, “No, not at all! We’re doing great and I’ve finally decided the best employees are the ones that feel valued.”

It took all my will power and focus to hold back a laugh. There is no way this was happening. None! Something wasn’t right. Maybe I was being paranoid, but my gut told me that a man with three offices, a Yacht, and a Porsche would never do this. Hell, how could he afford to?

“I can see this seems a bit far-fetched to you,” he looked at me with a concerned look.

“It just seems a little much,” I replied.

“How about I give you a check for the 10 thousand right now if you promise to come to the party tonight,” he replied.

The thing is, I didn’t want a handout. All I wanted was to earn my money. Granted, it would’ve been nice to receive a large bonus no matter what, but it didn’t feel right. Just as I was about to say no, one of the women came over to his side. The same woman who smiled just a few minutes ago looked absolutely stunning. Almost unnaturally so. Her hair was an ash blonde with bright red lips. She was also tall. I don’t mean your normal tall woman that’s 5 foot 9, but taller than Frank. I’d once asked him how tall he was after he said he didn’t believe I was 5’11.

‘6 foot 3,’ he had told me. Not only was she at least a couple of inches taller, but somewhat muscular, too. I was beginning to feel like a dwarf below two giants.

“This must be-Dev, yes?” She replied in an accent I hadn’t heard before. Something absolutely alien to me, but I understood what she said.

“You would be correct, Miss-?” I asked.

“Carmille,” she replied with a long smile. “I would like to invite you, as well. We’re going to be workin with you all and we should get to know one another. Th-Frank is happy to be you! He wants you all to be happy working together.

I nodded, “Okay, ya got me! I’ll be there tomorrow.” Both their smiles widened as more people began to enter. While Frank turned to the others, she winked at me.

Other people suspected the same things I had, but Frank tried to settle their concerns. Though me and Russell weren’t convinced, everyone else went home. All except us, until Frank insisted we leave in a nice manner unbecoming of him. Another woman talked to Russell before Frank kicked us out, but Joyce refused to talk to any of the new people. However, the most important people to socialize with for a good start would be the senior developers, engineers, and managers. Joyce hadn’t been approached once. Her years gave her extensive experience. I'd think they’d at least pretend they care, especially since the others went home.

Just to be clear, I had no intention of going, but I needed to get out. To put it frankly, I had almost no family, no date for almost a year, and spent most of my time doing more computer work. Though I lifted and ran almost daily, I was a hermit. That gave me the thought to call an old friend, who I explained the situation to.

“Yup! You’re all getting canned, Johnson! Hate to break it to you,” that wasn’t exactly the input I was looking for.

“Then who are these other people? How experienced are these models? Something doesn’t add up,” I replied.

“I don’t know man, but you said the woman winked. I know she tall, but who cares?”

“Easy for your 6’4 ass to say,” he laughed at my response.

“Treat yourself, man! What’s the worst that could happen,” his would come back to bite me in the ass soon enough, but I was unaware of just how large this problem was.

“Thanks! Hopefully, I’m just being paranoid, but if I am getting laid off, a night out might not be so bad.”

“See, just start filling out applications the next day when they break the news,” he said and I chuckled.

That afternoon I bought protein pasta, chicken, and rice. I also snagged some Trojans and wine. Who knows what would happen? There were other women I barely talked to, so I decided this was the time to break out of my bubble.

Give a bit of space.

Frank's home was marked by a huge gate with a long driveway. I’ll say it was anything but modest. Now my anxiety was stronger than ever, wondering what this was about. I was beginning to think we were going to be scammed, but that seemed a bit much. Despite my reservations, I drove to the house. The snow had melted, so there was no problem. I was one of the first ones, again. At least there was no trouble parking here. Strangely, I remember Frank having pictures of him and his family outside his house and I could’ve sworn this wasn’t it. Was this a wealthier CEO’s place he knew? There was an unreasonable amount of parking space, even for a wealthy family. Then again, it wouldn’t have been the first time a rich family bought far more than they needed.

Still gawking, I followed a man waving towards the left side near a large lot. Past the side was a pool with a diveboard, two boats, and a few cars. Nice of the owner to move his expensive stuff in the dirt. I had to be overthinking this whole thing.

So I relaxed, let the man guide me back, and parked my car. I smiled and waved and he returned the gesture. He appeared to be anxious, but it wasn’t a big deal.

After leaving putting on only my favorite cologne and combing my hair, I passed a few strangers and entered the house. My first order of business was to drink something to calm my nerves. Second was to look for people I knew, especially Russell, Joyce, or Mac. Mac didn’t come to the office much, but he was a solid guy. Also, a Marine that I could shit talk with.

I had found wine, cheese of all assortments, and delicious steak bites that I’d happily helped myself to. If this was my last day on the job, I was going to get everything I could. You might say, “You’re not working,” but I’d argue that anytime I have to see the faces of my coworkers is me working. Excluding the previously mentioned. Funny enough, I couldn’t even see the tall blonde from earlier. Just as I was about to message Russell and Mac, a young redhead approached me, smiling. Her stare almost pierced my soul with green eyes. Eyes that I would’ve sworn transformed to slits for a moment.

“Hello! I have not met you, yet. Dev, is it?” She asked in a nice, but odd tone. She also had the same accent as Carmille. Not Slavic, Italian, Romanian, or Japanese. I’d heard quite a few in my thirty years and this seemed truly foreign to me. Almost alien.

“Carmille told you?” I asked.

“Yes! Yes, she did!” she reached her hand out, “call me Lilith!”

I chuckled, taking her hand, “Lilith, I don’t suppose you know what this is all about?”

“About what?” she asked giving me a confused look.

“This party and, well, everything. It’s not usual. At least, I’ve never seen a CEO invite his employees, and offer a 10K bonus while providing wine, steak, and cheese,” I remembered just how insane this all was, making me reconsider staying here. At the very least I decided to stop indulging in the wine.

“I don’t know. Carmille invited me, though I was playing Road of Exiles and watching corgi videos before I arrived here,” she said.

“One, Corgis are adorable and I want a couple. Two, I just started playing it again. Early access comes out this coming month.”

“I would love to play it sometime. Maybe you could make me a better player,” her words made me question so much. Was she implying what I thought she was?

After some more chatting, she gave me a number. The reason I say it’s a number instead of her number is because it wasn’t a real number. 666-1289. When I asked if the area code was the same as the area, she seemed confused, but eventually answered with a yes.

More and more guests piled in. Only a handful, however, were from my job. I asked a woman where her friends worked and she asked if I was invited, like I was a weirdo. All I wanted to do was to get an idea of where everyone was coming from, but I gave up. When I looked for someone I actually wanted to talk to, I noticed the stares of other tall and oddly perfect people. They are what I imagined an android to look like. One moment they’d converse with the guests, the next they’d scan the crowd like a cat would a field of mice. One of them licked his lips standing behind a decent-looking fellow that struck me as a sales and business guy. I turned to look behind me and there she was.

“Mr. Dev. How are you this evening?”

“I was just about to leave, to be honest, but nice to see you,” I lied out of my teeth.

By this time I had realized that there were two groups. Us and these strange people. I felt an urge to run. To leave this house, get in my car, and drive away.

“You can’t! The party is about to begin. Frank will be here any minute, now with your reward,” the way she said that felt inhuman.

“Okay. I’ll stay,” I replied.

Her grin became wide. Almost unnaturally so, “Good! I promise this will be an unforgettable night.”

I nodded with a smile, then turned around. I had absolutely no intention of staying. I just wanted her off my case. However, before I made it to the door, Russell flagged me down, possibly drawing attention I didn’t want.

“How’s the night, Dev?” he asked.

“Russell, something’s not right here. I think we should leave immediately.”

“I can’t! I met a woman and,” he turned his words to whispers, “I think I might be onto something.”

“Oh, yeah? You know her name?” I asked hoping it wasn’t one of the perfect people.

“Lilith,” he smiled. “She said she didn’t know anyone, so I introduced her to a few people, even the woman from this morning.”

My heart dropped. Everything seemed more wrong than ever, but I still couldn’t put my finger on what was about to happen. “Carmille,” I replied, slowly.

“Yep! That’s her name! I keep forgetting it,” he said. “She also loves cats and The Expanse of Space.”

“Russell. She told me she likes Corgis. I’ve been looking into getting one or two for the past week. You like cats. She’s also interested in things, I’m sorry, most women do not like. Also, there are others like her that look too,” I struggled to finish my sentence, but he noticed what I was saying.

“Perfect. Too perfect,” he replied. We looked at each other before looking towards the door.

“I still have my Glock in the car, Russell. Follow me to my car. I’ll drop you off next to your car then we can drive the fuck outta here,” I said and he nodded.

When we got to the exit, those men and women stared at us. Smiling. If you thought a McDonald’s employee's smile was fake, you haven’t seen anything yet. It creeped me out enough to pick up my pace. Russell followed my lead without hesitation. We exited into the night. Men began to trail us. I pulled my coworker to the right. As we picked up our pace, they did theirs. By the time we passed the first set of cars, we were power walking to my vehicle.

“Get in my car and I’ll get us out of here,” I told him.

“My car’s closer, Dev. I should just go to mine and you yours,” I didn’t like the idea of separating, but I didn’t have time to debate or think.

“Alright. Go!” I responded.

He began veering to the left, as did one of our pursuers. Then I noticed them. There were a dozen or so people surrounding the lot. And the house. Russell pressed the unlock button for his car, but the man sprinted towards Russell. That run was like no other I had ever seen. I wasn’t even sure if we had been running so much as gliding after a point. I didn’t bother to look behind me. I just ran, hoping to make it to my car in time. Then I panicked. I didn’t have a round in the chamber. I focused as I closed the distance to my car. The chasing footsteps behind me disappeared, and then a scream erupted.

“Help,” Russell cried.

I wanted to help, but I couldn’t stop. I slowed down just to grab the door handle. As soon as the door opened, I reached into my side seat and pulled the gun. I reached to remove the holster still attached, but the thing pulled me away. The thing’s face changed. Its teeth were now razor sharp.

“Where are you going, human?” After he finished taunting me, his mouth opened, darting towards my neck.

But not before I chambered a round and began firing. The first rounds were in the chest. The last four rounds were placed in his skull while I pushed my gun from under his head. Though he dropped to the ground, his chest wounds were healing. At that point, I was shivering and my nerves were firing on all cylinders as I struggled to get inside my car. That’s when all the creatures began to converge. My foot hit the brake then I turned the key. As I put my car in reverse, I reached into my glove compartment for another magazine, preferably the one with ten rounds.",2,1734839298.0,creepypasta,1,1.0,False

I (36F) co-own a retail business.

I got a somewhat viral flavor of iced coffee from 7brew today before heading into the store (banana bread blondie for those curious). I’ve talked about this drink and hyped it up several times. My husband and business partner (37M) was in the office pricing cards (we own a trading card store/LGS). This business partner asked if he could try my coffee, and I said sure. I walked into the office shortly after and was met with serious attitude and hostility from husband, and him questioning if I really let him have a drink of my coffee. I was taken aback and surprised by his anger, and he spent the entire day in the office and treating myself and all employees coldly for the entire day. At one point he came out and in front of other customers and employees confronted this business partner with a sharply toned “did you really just drink her coffee?” causing an awkward moment for all around.

1) The Outsiders:
I feel so privileged to have gotten to see this with the original cast. A particular standout to me was Jason Schmidtt (Sodapop). This probably has something to do with the fact that I’m a single lady and he had his shirt off the first half, GOOD LORD. I don’t want objectify the man, he was talented and played the character with so much heart. Really the whole cast did. The production was bare bones in just the right way to allow the cast to shine and boy did they. After it was over I was just wishing I could do it all over again. I fell in love with everyone on that stage. 9/10

2) Death Becomes Her:
I went in hearing it was “camp,” and boy did it deliver. I can’t believe just how INSANELY entertaining and hilarious this show was. In fact, it tickled my humor just right and as a woman, it’s a breath of fresh air to hear the beauty standards many of us secretly abide by be aired out to dry. both stars, Megan Hilty and Jennifer Simard were so INCREDIBLE. If you’re a classic broadway fan, the special effects, talent, and dancing cannot be topped. I just kept laughing and laughing and laughing.
10/10

3) Six:
We saw this because my mom wanted to see it, and I was initially not very into it. Of course the actresses were so incredibly amazing, DUH. But six just doesn’t do anything for me. All of it feels dated already - lots of “omg”s and “lol”s feels like it’s from a particular brand of coffee cup and T-shirts from TJ max brand of female empowerment. I’m so sorry to say this and I’m gonna get a lot of hate, but it felt like the eras tour version of broadway, if that’s your thing you’ll like it. It’s just not my cup of tea

The day all of this occurred, it was another day. woke up let him outside on the covered patio he was normal. outside for a total of 5 minutes. he came inside and was ""hiding"" beside my coffee table. he got on our couch and was fine laid there for a good 2 hours with no abnormalities. it was time to go back outside, and he refused which is unusual because he loves to be outside. however, he did get off the couch but when he tried to get back up, he yelped and then refused to get up. we took him to the only vet we could find open on a Sunday, and they just gave us some pain medication because he was still walking. the next day he refused to eat or drink anything so we took him to a different vet he was in excruciating pain and could barely walk without crying, they didn't give us any kind of name they just explain to us what was happening. they said one of his spinal knuckles is inflamed and it wasn't bad enough that he needed surgery. gave us another medication and told us to keep him somewhere padded and only allow him to use the restroom. we did this for 5 days and since yesterday he hasn't been able to get up or move without yelping. it just seems to be getting worse we have another appointment on Monday, but he hasn't used the restroom for 2 days. how do i get him to use the restroom if he is unable to stand for more than a literal second? also has anyone else experienced this what do I do to help him be comfortable and is it possible he could recover, or should I prepare for the worst?",1,1734838629.0,AskVet,1,0.99,False

Physical issues: prone to inflammation, tendinitis, low grade chronic pain. Otherwise I'm in I guess decent health for my age. I have lost 10 pounds in the past 2-3 months due to a severe depressive episode. Taking wellbutrin for the mental health, nifedipine for Raynaud's (a low dose, I don't recall exactly), solifenacin for overactive bladder (5 mg every other day). 

I noticed a couple weeks ago there is an area on my left shin, maybe a couple inches in size, that is tender to physical contact. It feels like the skin is being stretched(?) or maybe a stinging sensation? There's zero visible change to the skin and I don't recall any kind of trauma like running into a coffee table or anything, or contact with any chemicals. 

It is usually not even noticeable but sometimes if I'm putting on socks or w/e, or if a extend my foot, it gets aggravated. 

Any thoughts on this? It's not disrupting my life or anything, just annoying. 

Sth to talk with my Dr about, or is it just another thing that happens as bodies wear out? ",1,1734838615.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False
1hjqcbh,https://www.reddit.com/r/MurderDronesOfficial/comments/1hjqcbh/parabellum_chapter_iii_continued/,Parabellum Chapter III Continued ,"Morning light began to peek through the thin curtains faster than Uzi had expected—or even wanted it to. It felt like just a second had passed since exhaustion had claimed her; too weak to fight against the visions of decomposing corpses that rattled the very bones in her skull, her optics drooped and sleep claimed her. It felt like it had just been a split second, that she had spent more time tossing and turning, chills running down her spine as her CPU cycled from image to grotesque image than actual sleep—some grainy, like a vintage photograph that time had turned its wrath upon—others scarily vivid. Skin, cracked, yellow and sagged, red lines pouring down in infinite rivulets from the butchered eye sockets like infected gum that ceaselessly grew. The coppery tang of blood—the fetid smell that followed her wherever she went—overwhelmed the rainy stench and haunted the worker drone for what seemed like lifetimes on end;—forcing her to lie awake, frozen, optics blown wide and hollowed out as she rationalized and vainly rationalized. Yet every reason she could come up with—every excuse she could draw up to even try to justify what she did were all but dashed away by the tiny voice in her head that was almost as loud as a car horn at night kept repeating just three words: 

   *You killed them. Not me. You.* 

   Her apartment settled into a deep quiet akin to a priest in a confession chamber, an eerie outside peace that Uzi envied—no, wished she could have for herself, even if for a second. It was peaceful, yes—but only on the outside. Only on the outside, she saw the sun peek over the horizon, the sun that back-lit the evergreen trees packed tightly some miles behind Seattle’s shore—but the light never pierced through the surface, it was never enough to melt the ice. It would always re-freeze each night, and the process would repeat. She'd have to wave this off as having too much coffee too late in the day, or something along those lines. It took her the trembling walk down the hall to string up a believable story; Uzi was sure she wouldn't need it anyway. Every college student was at least extremely sleep deprived from the workload, but it certainly didn't hurt to have a contingency—just like Don Rossi, her ***father,*** had taught her. 

  The first thought that actually registered in her mind that wasn't a collage of violence was to go back to her room and yank the extra layer of curtains towards each other so that she would no longer be under the scrutinizing gaze of the sun. Uzi forced herself to raise her head once she had gotten to the bathroom, gazing at herself with optics even Uzi herself could not decipher. It did not last long, however, and like a stone Uzi's head sunk low. Her wearied gaze rested on her hands, more specifically the patches of discolor that varied in size and pocked her palms and the back of her hand like a quilt sewn with muted, dead colors of gray and black. They were scars from boiled water, Uzi quickly deduced, but they did not move up to her fingers somehow. She could easily reflect upon and recall in minute detail the story of each slash, bullet, or shrapnel wound that littered her frame, big or small, from her arms down to her legs—beginning to end—but the ones that ran across her hands remained an enigma Uzi could never trace the root of.

   Due to the concerning nature of the cicatrices, Uzi resorted to using fingerless gloves anytime she'd be in the presence of another;—or out in public at all—and they *never* came off until she was locked away in her apartment, shielded from any prying eyes that might catch glimpses of patches that still remained discolored, now a sickly charcoal gray that made Uzi's stomach contract itself into a tight, resentful ball that made bitter bile creep up her throat. At all costs, they stayed on and never, under any circumstances came off until she was home. It became a sort of habit. The scars were also a source of indescribable shame, one the drone could not pinpoint the source of. But a gnawing emptiness clashed with that shame, an indifference that met it like dirtied, brown water trying to mix with water that was as clear as a cloudless sky. But it did not unease Uzi. It did not concern her. There was no thanks for even waking up in the morning. No, not anymore. There was just the cold air to greet her, and the cold air to soothe her to sleep when she began to tire of fighting her own mind late into the night while the moon hung above, gaily watching. Her body thrummed with the need to wander back to bed, collapse upon the mattress and simply melt into it—but her optics rested upon the M9 that the teen didn't even know she had put on the counter. The black suppressor had been unscrewed, and nowhere in sight. When had she done that? Uzi couldn't even remember half of what she did last night. It all hazed and mixed together, like a drunken mind's efforts to piece together the events of a raving party that lasted far into the night.

   She stared at the weapon with those hollowed, dead optics, taking a moment to admire the steel. Uzi’s lips pursed into a thin line, and she took the gun, her thumb resting on the hammer. She wanted to pull the hammer back, but her thumb would not move. Instead, it trembled and twitched in its place, as if it had a mind of its own;—afraid of what Uzi was commanding it to do— screaming at it to do. Even while she gazed at the steel, half of her mind was still hard at work, generating images of what her victim could look like now. Decomposing, rotten and rank like raw fish in a market. If Uzi was to be honest, the ones that included a zipped up body bag were far easier to stomach than the ones that were instead sprawled on cold, hard concrete or contorted at impossible angles in a small trunk. The sounds of the outside city had long muffled—quieted, as if a life-sized flashbang had just gone off in front of her face—but instead of blinding the worker drone, it only deafened her somewhat. Her thoughts were once again fragmented and dissolved;—scattered like ash in an ocean, and for a moment the youngster couldn't even formulate a single coherent thought—too fixed on the M9 she held in her hand. She had barely put any thought into any of her kills beside her first—why now? Emptiness followed emptiness, and nothing became nothing, a void expanding and swallowing a void to grow itself.

   Then she felt nothing, as if Oliver Mackenzie was just dust on a pristine floor that had just been swept away. Her grip tightened painfully on the pistol, but her arm did not move even an inch in any direction—only a ceaseless tremble, like it itself was afraid. Her optic twitched, and she wanted to throw the gun down in a fit of rage, to let out the scream that had been hiding away for so long. But her lip only twitched—didn’t open. She lifted her head to her own reflection, to be greeted by fresh tear streaks running down her visor, lining the otherwise dark glass a faint darkish-purple that barely stood out. Her optics hollowed—in fear, in anger at her own condition, perhaps both. How long had she been crying? Uzi barely even felt the tears prick at her, much less fall. There was a sense of small relief that they didn’t keep coming, one that was quickly swallowed up by her more intense emotion.

  Uzi mentally punched herself. Then again. And again. And again, then shook herself with all the force the drone could muster. *Get your fucking act together,* she snarled to herself. What the hell was she doing, crying like this? If **anyone** ever saw her like this, they wouldn’t let her live it down. It’d be the subject of drunken gossip, however light-hearted it may be, and would most definitely be brought up anytime she was to act tough. If someone like Viktoria knew, she could handle that—the youth had seen the taller drone shed tears herself multiple times. But someone like Vincent Andolini? (Or Vince , as he was respectfully referred to) This one incident would outlive them *both* if it reached his ears.

  Andolini was an ex-Marine and *caporegime* of the First Hill area even before he enlisted, and her mentor that brought her up in the art of death and thievery along with her family in all but blood from age sixteen. Thanks to him, she found her frankly uncanny talent with a trigger. He was all about toughening her up, and Rossi gave him full support to do so. Uzi couldn’t even remember the last time she had allowed herself to let tears fall without a fight, but the drone did remember what would happen if she did: a firm verbal beatdown. Though it was indeed hellish in the short-term, the purple-haired drone found herself thanking him—though certainly not vocally—for it. 

   “*An efficient soldier must know when to sympathize, and when to detach. The moment you see your enemy as an individual, you are no longer a good soldier. Separate business from personal matters, and morals from loyalty. Loyalty always comes first.*” That age-old saying of the heartless soldier translated well from the U.S. Marine Corps to her line of work, and it was not one she forgot easily. The other phrase, he had simply added on to drill in already known tenets of the Family—of any Family—into her head. Those words helped her keep a cooler head even during the worst of berating, and would most assuredly keep her from cracking under any law enforcement pressure if worst ever came to worst. If he, or worse yet, Jade, ever heard of her in a situation like this—vulnerable like this… Uzi pushed that thought aside—she didn’t need more things to worry herself gray right now. Uzi looked at herself one last time in the mirror, brushing her disheveled hair back slightly, then slinking out of the bathroom, throwing on her usual getup without even thinking—a dark-colored baggy hoodie with fingerless gloves to match—even thinking of those scars made chills run rampant down her spine—and sweatpants, leaving her overcoat behind. She wasn't planning on touching that thing for the week. 

 

   Uzi didn't need to smile—she rarely smiled in the genuine sense, only plastered on a snide half-grin that was only a small stretch of her lips. Uzi allowed her deadened optics to widen imperceptibly. In surprise, perhaps, at her own condition. The feeling had always felt genuine—the happiness, the sense of contentment. She had most likely already missed a class or two from oversleeping, but her thinking stopped dead and faded into oblivion the moment she walked through the door, slamming it shut with the back of her hand without even looking—inputting a series of numbers and watching the holographic lock animation play in the corner of her optic before fading.


  The halls of the eighteenth floor were filled with an eerie silence, the occasional distant squeaking of room service carts and the ever-present coffee and rainwater scent being the only sign of life, even though Seattle didn’t get as much rain as stereotypically thought. Uzi’s optic twitched at the sound of her boots making contact with the tiled floor, bouncing off the empty halls like the crack of a gunshot rather than a dull echo. Locked apartment doors lined the corridors, rarely not the same brown, gray, or cobalt, though there were Thanksgiving decorations on some doors. The teenage drone’s optic twitched once more. She had nothing to be thankful for. Maybe she did. Maybe she didn’t. Her mind had run itself empty, her body performing on autopilot, optics sunken like she hadn’t gotten sleep in weeks when it had just been one bad, *bad* night—a night she hoped would have never come.

   Uzi had at the very least expected someone to be leaning on the white brocaded wall, smoking in spite of the non-smoking 3D sign right in the middle of the hall—quite vividly showcasing the outline of a man smoking and a prohibition sign smacking down on said animation, looping indefinitely. The drone spared an inaudible “hm” before wearily ambling off to the elevator. Unlike many other complexes, there was two elevators for both species, unlike the segregated drones only elevators that held a repugnant odor of excrement and gasoline that took months to be rid of, and had age-old rusted elevator buttons that worked only by chance compared to the two extra human elevators that were neatly furbished, coming with scanners so discreetly built in not one drone or human would even catch a glimpse of it. If a drone were to try and get it, they'd be shut out in a split second by solid six-inch-thick steel that was so intelligently fitted behind the regular elevator door nobody even caught a glimpse of it, and if they tried to jump inside—there were countless instances of drone crushings.

   Before she had even registered the chopped reflection of the stainless steel, she was inside the elevator used and intended for both species. Anyone who tried to vandalize the elevators were swiftly dealt with by Rossi’s firm and his band of lawyers that could win any case in their field. Her hands were buried in her pockets as they always were, her head sinking downwards as if she was going to fall asleep where she stood—truth be told, she nearly had almost five times already. But Uzi didn’t know if she was tired or not. A void swallowed a void, and there was nothing. There was nothing, and it scared Uzi shitless. Though at times, the fear would dissipate intermittently, and she’d simply feel off, a slight ping in her stomach—then it’d come back again, and the process repeated. With each blink, her optics grew heavier, and when the elevator lurched softly and began its descent after she pressed the L button, it was as if gravity had amplified, dragging the youth down with seemingly enough force to make her fall through the elevator flooring. Her thighs ached from standing, kneecaps throbbing from spending most of the night in the fetal position, and her gloves rubbed against her scars and made them itch continually.

   *What’s wrong with me?* The question repeated, lingering without an answer, getting louder and louder every second. Just two days ago, she was as happy as could be—burying the bloodbath that was her actual life as far down as the dead lay and living her life. But the moment she pulled the trigger on that reporter;—Hell, the moment she tied him up and nearly broke his legs shoving him into the trunk of that Godforsaken sedan—something changed, something snapped in her the moment she heard those bones pop and crackle and that faint moan of pain—from that moment everything she had buried surged out of the dirt all in one arduous night that felt more like centuries rolled into one. 

   In spite of the fact that her future hung on it; Uzi hated going to college for one reason. Maybe two. Maybe three. The perpetual smell of coffee and the burn of the caffeine acid in her stomach, car exhaust, and saltwater were a repugnant odor when mixed together—but a tolerable one nonetheless, mostly due to the dominant coffee scent. One: Pledging allegiance to Uncle Sam's ""star-piss banner"", as she appellated it, and sitting through “good Government bullshit” before the academic day began. The United States Federal Government left her to rot for seven years, threw her aside like a worn ragdoll cast to a forgotten corner—why should she stand by it? The feds didn't give her a life; they left her with a death sentence before her life could even begin. The very idea of reciting the pledge, hand on her chest with the other humans disgusted her and laced the youngster's every nerve with a ferocious detestation that damn near overcame the now-consistent emptiness. Two: the constant, ever-looming presence of law enforcement. She had seen the venomous side-glares from even the policemen on Don Rossi’s leash, the whispered conversations whenever she or another drone would pass by in the mingled crowds, their optics locked with the humans' eyes for a split second before the link broke. She was never out to replace them—take their jobs, like the politicians say. Well, maybe some were; but not Uzi. She wouldn't fit well in pigs' hooves.


 There was always a nagging voice in the back of her head that told her that every single blue in the U-District that was somehow not kissing Rossi's ass was just waiting for a single slip-up. If not from her, from another drone. Bullets would embark on their ballistic paths with pinpoint accuracy, and it'd make headlines within the hour, that was assured, the perpetrators idolized and exalted for putting down some kid. Certainly not the first, nor the last one of her kind to die within the throes of the urban labyrinth the poor bastard in question formerly roamed. Drones could never go to cops with their problems—they’d be either laughed out of the station, or flat-out denied entry, so they came to the better law enforcement—the ones who would actually treat them like living beings, and give them the justice they deserved. The mob, the wiseguys did what the police couldn't even be bothered to, and Uzi owed it all to that. Three: The constant inquisitiveness of her classmates. It was a nuisance that burrowed down to what was left of her soul. Sure, nobody expected the gothy, geeky, socially withdrawn *scrap-fucker*—as the humans lovingly referred to her kind as—to be a born-raised *mafioso,* but anything was on the table when it came to drones—the gloves she wore nearly twenty-four-seven also earned her a couple stares, and she was observed like she was on house arrest by some of her peers.


 The only saving grace was that the U-District was one of Aurelio Rossi's many district-sized playgrounds—a stable protection racket ranging from professors to even some of Uzi’s fellow classmates that guaranteed a generous flow of money in return for the faceless mob’s omnipresent protection—so she and anyone else that she considered *famiglia,* though she rarely, if ever, used the term in spite of being a half-breed—as they unlovingly called those who had only one parent that was Sicilian-born (though she thankfully lacked the accent, and nobody outside of the family knew of it due to her avoiding speaking the language like the plague)—could kick back, gamble to their heart’s content in the many casinos Don Rossi owned, or spend blazing nights at nightclubs without having to worry about the blues too much , double-park by a hydrant with no concern of having their funds siphoned straight from their wallets by decree of some thin-haired old men while they slept, then subsequently used to make Seattle more of a police-infested crapsack than it already was. Some called the modern Cosa Nostra a glaring anachronism that was bound to fade away with time, but that was a statement proven wrong time and time again. To live any other way would be nothing but crazy. It was a golden fantasy, a dream that at times Uzi wished to remain wrapped up in. 

   Most of the time. This was certainly not one of those times. She was just about to nod off—sleep as enticing as a Michelin hotel bed’s silk blankets, but yet another silhouette that was  a mixture of a black-and-white and colored movie of something that looked like it belonged on a scene of The Thing forced her weary optics open once more, another chill barreling down her spine. *God, I'd kill for a coffee,* Uzi thought to herself, not catching the irony of her own thoughts’ choice of words until mere seconds after. The caffeine would probably be enough to get her through at least a couple hours of the lecture halls, and maybe squeeze in enough downtime to get that paper done—wait…

   ***Oh, for fuck's...*** She nearly slammed the side of her fist on the elevator wall, but her arm stubbornly would not move to execute the command, too tired to follow through. She had forgotten her damn laptop—of course she had. Instead, she buried her head in her hands, leaning against the wall and grumbling a string of exhausted yet rageful swears under her breath that were more directed at herself than they were at the world. On top of that, she had forgotten her backpack, another revelation that left the youngster fuming with all of the rage and anger a sleep-deprived gothic college student could muster up. Which was not much indeed, as most of it was quickly overshadowed by exhaustion rather than amplified. *Great,* she raged to herself. Just great. She eyed the indicator above the stainless steel doors, her optics flickering between it and her chopped reflection the steel gave. Another possibility crept into her mind—could there be a pistol waiting for her when the elevator finished its descent? Could it be a *kyodai* waiting to put a hole through her skull in revenge for Jade’s actions? 

   Or one of El Cazador’s men out on a hit? Did they want her head on a plate? What had she done wrong to any of them? Well, in the past couple months, maybe a year or two. Or was it the Bellinis—those bomb-crazed, gun-toting corporate rats. Was it the police, had they found her server room? When? How? Questions, questions. Possibilities after possibilities. She couldn't answer all of them, but her mind ceaselessly supplied her with them, most of which did no favors to her current condition. Her heart sped up. She should've never used the elevator, elevators were death traps for people like her. *Dear God, no.* That drew out a panicked yet unnecessary upward glance that was quickly straightened out. Well, it didn't matter if she did anything wrong to the Arroyos—the bastards hated “guineas” with every fiber of their being, the only people the Rossis and the Bellinis held a common hatred for. Even more so, the Arroyos held nothing but animosity for drones. 


  They see either one in any inch of the streets they ruled, it would be best if the poor bastards throw themselves off one of Seattle's vaunted fast ferries, so irrevocably screwed they would be if they didn't want to rush from one gangster's lands to another. “It goes back a while,” Rossi had told her, his voice purposely sotto voce while he sat in his cushioned leather chair, admiring his walnut desk, leg slung in an L over the other in the typical businessman pose, exposing his black Gucci shoes that shone like the sea in the sun, swirling around his small glass of *Strega* like he was about to share a blood feud that's been raging for generations. He was flanked on both sides by unmoving, expressionless button-men bodyguards. His *consigliori,* his biological son Dante who had always treated Uzi like he would his own sister, much like Viktoria and Jade—to an extent—sat parallel to his father. In reality, it was none of the such, only a brutal clash for control of the coast of Seattle and the Puget Sound that slowly settled into Seattle’s own mini-Cold War over the span of a pair of decades. “They kill us for showing compassion, we kill them for being cold-hearted *animales.* The pattern goes on.” Uzi’s jaw tightened. As if they didn't have enough enemies as is. They couldn't hit back, not unless they killed one of theirs. The *bastardi* played it safe, only killing civilians, and the cops turned blind eyes. After all, what were the lives of a couple drones in the face of some twenty grand covering the sight like a thick curtain? They had the dock unions, their operations weren't out in the open—always low-profile, just like theirs. The Arroyos owned the coastline of Seattle, they controlled everything down to narcotics and opioids. The Rossi assets were far too famous to touch; it'd stir up a media shitstorm the Seattle PD couldn't—wouldn't—ignore, and they knew that. So it slowly faded into the shadows, but the animosity still ran hot. But the Rossi Family controlled the prisons, and a lot of Arroyos were living out multiple life sentences. An even fight.

   The doors slid open, and she braced for being greeted by the cold steel barrel of a gun, her hand instinctively moving to tightly grip her waistband where no pistol or even a holster was clipped onto, sucking in a breath, her whole body tensing as if ready for a grand standoff with little to no energy left, her heart thrumming in her ears like gunshots—*Thud. Thud. Thud.* And her distorted, 8-bit-like reflection was replaced with a drone that was about five inches taller than her leaning by the drywall that separated the complex anteroom from the lobby, one that nearly made her heart skip three beats and her whole body relax near immediately and her optics widen in surprise—though it did not take away her growing exhaustion-nausea and general mind fraying: Gryffin. He had always sported a combed back yet unkempt style of that curly ginger hair of his—something his childhood friend who now stood right in front of him always taunted him for in the most light-hearted of ways.

   ""Sup, shitbird,” he waved, both his expression and tone nothing short of warm, but always carrying a sharp, terse edge that came with living life on the edge of poverty before Viktoria scored “an amazing job” before she was even old enough to work at all, and a seemingly boundless cash flow (from the perspective of someone who grew up nearly dirt-poor as a culmination of anti-drone bigotry and his parents’ killing) poured in that allowed him to finally flourish in Seattle’s most prestigious university and the most recent add-on to the vaunted Ivy League: the University of Washington—the very same college Uzi studied at, albeit within the taut, looming restrictions society placed on drones like him and his sister that were older than any of them combined. Though he did have his suspicions about the source of the financing, a secret Vik adroitly kept hidden using a series of faux-stories that were surprisingly believable. Uzi breathed out a laugh, her lips stretching into a shadow of her typical half-smile, though it didn't reach her optics at all. In fact, it nearly swallowed up whatever remained of the teen’s willpower just to keep it plastered on. Uzi's lip twitched imperceptibly. Her worn-out purple optics locked with his cobalt ones for a split second, then tearing away once Uzi's thoughts were quickly plunged into things that she wouldn't dare even admit to herself.

   ""You look tired.” Her hand fled from her waistband with discretion, now quickly grasping onto her hoodie to throw it over her unkempt, stubbornly brush-resistant dull purple locks, which both framed and hid her face, which was now slowly gaining a flush in spite of her vain, yet fierce attempt to fight it off. Strands of dark violet fell into the drone’s visor and barely peeked out from her slumped shoulders, now even more concealed due to the dark hoodie she had pulled over her head. Uzi could only nod, walking out of the elevator just as the doors closed, burying her gloved hands in her pockets. “Yeah. Didn’t… Get a lot of sleep,” She murmured, nearly under her breath. “I’m fine.” Her voice wasn't like someone who was just unable to sleep, no. Her voice was somewhat hoarse as if she had been screaming bloody murder all night, and Gryffin could barely even hear her words, so quiet were they as opposed to her normally quick-to-bite, angsty demeanor, though she still held that teenage angst the ginger-haired drone knew her for. They seemed like incoherent mumblings from a crazed woman, even though he was sure they were not. That wiped the smile off his face in an instant.

 What Uzi had said was a grave understatement and yet another half-truth, but a necessary one to keep her friend from drawing more concern than he already had—although it stung like a thousand hornets and weighed on her like gauges of steel to even fathom lying to her friend. How Viktoria managed to do it, Uzi could never manage to wrap her head around. Uzi kept her head down, trying to hide her hollowed-out and sleep-robbed optics that were ridden with heavy aubergine bags from the night before. The smell of blood still infested her chemosensory receptors in spite of the fact that she had thoroughly washed herself a grand total of three times when she had gathered up enough strength to drag herself out of bed in a heap of barely-coordinated limbs at various hours of the suffocatingly silent Seattle night, but it had still plagued her throughout the night without stopping. Without her gun, or her small holster she had left behind in her house, the drone felt like she had just been amputated in her sleep. Two side-eye glances to the far right side of the lobby where the stairs were, her head not moving but her eyes darting about as if they had finally been given adrenaline, only centering when there was nothing but shadowed hardwood instead of the glint of steel in the darkness.

   Her gloves pressed and chafed against her scars even more with the support of her hoodie pockets, sending nonstop prickling sensations throughout her hands as if she were being stabbed over and over by millions of microscopic needles. She barely kept her own footing as she walked across from the anteroom to the medium-sized staircase heading down to the garage, absentmindedly brushing against the chipped red paint that was now showing the darkish gray behind it. She was quickly tailed by Gryffin, still as bright as ever, though his smile faded somewhat. He took notice of her condition, however—to his credit, Gryffin was always a sharp one. He always took notice of the nearly four to five men standing outside the main entrances in a statuesque stillness, guarding the doors like they were secret service agents. Uzi stole a glance at the shadows outside. She had always trusted the button men outside and inside to do their duties, as did Don Rossi. They had begun to expect—no, predict superb handling and protection of Family assets within the complex, and they were given no less. Gryffin took notice of it all, but never vocalized it. Perhaps they were simple doormen, dressed to look intimidating for some reason or another.

 He noticed how the dark, nearly invisible ceiling camera lenses subtly followed them both with every step they took. “Hey,” At first, Uzi didn’t register the words, and she continued walking down the steps. She slowly blinked in vain attempts to shake the sleep (or lack thereof) from her bones, but it predictably refused to leave her. Her optics, once a near-vibrant neon purple but never fully bright, had assumed the color of the bags that sagged it—a chilling dark violet color that nearly made the ginger-haired drone beside her stop dead. Not even the sound of her own boots clicking against composite reached her auditory receptors. Everything was a dull ring to her now. His close friend had also carried a noticeable slump, like she had just returned from spending all night crouched like a sloth on her couch, watching nothing but flickering static on TV—unblinking.

At times, Uzi looked like she was just about ready to keel over and collapse from utter exhaustion, a possibility that only heightened his anxieties regarding his friend’s newfound condition. But against his better judgment—against everything that told him to do otherwise, Gryffin tightly pressed his lips into a thin line, a poor attempt to disguise—or hold back—a grimace that was quickly taking its form across his features. His arm twitched, but he kept it in place mindlessly, but his thought swirled at the same time into an incomprehensible stew. All of the words he wished he could blurt out at her stuck in his throat, burning it. Burning it. That was his problem. He thought too much—he was too considerate. *Too considerate for your own good,* Vik always told him that. She didn’t need to say it outright, he knew what she meant. His big sister prided herself on being enigmatic, but she was easy to read—at least that’s what he thought. *Too considerate, too kind.* What if she was just having a bad day? What if she didn’t want to be bothered? The unusual silence that settled between the two made his muscles spasm imperceptibly. Normally, they’d be talking about something—*anything.* There was nothing, but everything. Nothing. Everything. Nothing. Possibilities raced by the hundreds, but there was nothing beneath them. She didn’t turn to him, but rather kept herself centered. The stairs seemed to reach down, down, down for eternity. Were they on the final step? The garage lights weren’t on, he couldn’t tell. They didn’t come on this early, he inferred. Shadows nearly enveloped the descent, mixing and swirling together as if it was alive. Or was that just his mind? Gryffin always had a rather… active, childlike imagination he had not yet gotten rid of. Perhaps he didn't want to. Perhaps he did. All that he knew was that it clung onto him like a bad smell, and dug under his casing like a ringworm.

   His cobalt optics jittered and inched about. Was he just misreading this, being too overbearing? Did he say something wrong, do something wrong? Were they being watched? The cameras had always served to unease him. His musings nearly drove him mad with worry, but he showed no indication of which;—save for the occasional twitch of his finger that glided unobserved. His free hand raised as if it had a mind of its own, gingerly tapping her shoulder. She froze almost mid-step, shooting up straight—ramrod straight, and her darkened violet optics hollowed into a pair of thin ovals that nearly became one with the dark glass it was displayed in. Her breath caught in her throat, and the words followed. “You alright? ‘zi, you look like you just went ten miles up shit’s creek with your bare hands as a paddle.” Uzi couldn’t help but let a slight chuckle bubble up from her voice box, but it carried no real emotion. Even when he was heavily concerned, the ginger-haired drone was quite the snarker. There was no way Uzi could simply, directly tell him that she *killed,* laundered, stole and ***lied*** to so many to the point where she had lost count of it. How many she had beaten to an inch of their lives, held at gunpoint or knifepoint to collect money. How many whipping boys were handed life sentences meant for her. Uzi’s mind eagerly went to work, drawing up what his reaction would be if she was ever dumb enough to do so—stupid enough to violate *Omertà*, the blood oath she took years ago; the fabled Sicilian law of silence. *He'd never want to look at me again,* she thought. 

   Her pulse frayed and spiked upward at the very thought of it. She could hear his voice echo throughout the caverns of her mind. “*Thief. Criminal. Get the hell away from me. I should call the cops. I can’t believe you.*” His voice was cold, emotionless, a far cry from how he’d actually sound, Uzi knew. Then she’d be killed too. Walked into a room and subsequently shot dead in the old-fashioned style—it didn't matter if she was nineteen or seven years old. She’d have it coming if she dared to violate *Omertà,* anyway—betray the man who saved her from certain death on the cold streets of Wallingford. She'd do the exact same thing to anyone else. *Who would be the one to pull the trigger?*

Vince? Jade? Don Rossi himself? Her body twitched at the thought, which quickly followed up by yet another string of gory images that would easily keep even the most hardened killer up at night. Trying in vain to push them aside, she swiftly turned around and began to climb up the stairs. “C’mon, I… Fuck, I forgot my bag and my laptop. Wait out in the lobby, I’ll get it.” She said, her voice still hollow as she sprung up the steps with energy she didn’t even know she had left in her and speed that was the result of running from the Arroyos, the Russians, and the cops for years. Anything to get her mind off of… Whatever had just seared itself into the forefront of her mind. Gryffin barely caught up with her, mostly due to surprise given her earlier condition. This was going to be a *long* day.",2,1734838535.0,MurderDronesOfficial,0,1.0,False

On the day before a surgery that she could've not come out of.,"We had only met in person once for coffee, my anxiety spiked and the conversation was.. nothing compared to how we would text. She ended up leaving after 15 minutes. I chaulked it up to myself being to awkward. Then right after she got to her car i got an apology saying she doesnt do well in public and had to leave. She had told me about past traumas, so it made sense. We continued to talk until the day she was told she may have cancer along with the other complications. She didn't respond for a day. She told me what happened and that she couldnt commit to anything other than her health at the moment. So we didn't talk for about 2 days. Then i woke up to a message saying how bad she felt and how much she messed up pushing me out of her life. We both came to terms that we could be friend's with the intentions of dating when she felt ready. We also talked about bring just friends, i couldn't do that, it would've wrecked me to see her with someone else. Things  were the same again until the day before her operation. I felt it would help to send a good morning text telling her just how much she means to me and that i would never give up hope that she could make it. She responded bassically saying that shes not who i think she is and that she cant be trusted. Then lied about being married thinking i would just stop talking to her right then and there but i knew it was a lie. She continued saying shes not the person i deserve, that she could never give me what i needed. We  had talked about seeing eachother more, which she always turned down. Saying she cant do public, she wouldn't come to mine or let me come to hers. Stating her house is her safe place and that i shouldn't trust her to be at or stay over at mine. We talked about being more intimate, not expecting sexting or anything like that, just to show me that i meant something to her and that she wanted more. I don't think she  ever told me anything uplifting or how i make her feel special or her day better. She would always kinda disregard my problems with barely a im sorry that happened to you, im here for you, nothing like that. All i really know is it hurts so damn bad.. i dont even know how her operation went, nothing.  So im asking what I did wrong? Was i being pushy and not taking her traumas to heart? Should i have picked up on signals she was giving the whole time. And also would it be a mistake to try n reach out to her? Or take the pain and move on? im just so lost and confused. If this is the wrong place to ask im sorry please let me know. Thank you all, i hope you're all doing well.",0,1734838345.0,dating_advice,5,0.33,False

We’re pretty serious about each other and kinda U-Hauling it. He’s enlisted in the military and is in basic training right now, his graduation date coming up in about a month. We haven’t gotten to communicate much, clearly, if you didn’t know, in boot camp you can communicate with loved ones using letters or about 4 phone calls over 10 weeks. He’s been writing me about being overworked and sad, he’s helping with religious services there, doing lots of watches, and hasn’t been able to go to Shabbat for a while. He’s spending his birthday and the holidays there. I’ve been planning on showering him with treats when I see him again, but since he’s mentioned it a few times, I look the leap to buy plane tickets to fly out and see him graduate. After grad you have a few days to hang out with your recruit, both of us need it I think. 

Actually I didn’t immediately get the tickets- S gave me his mom’s [~40F] cell number so I reached out to her about it first. Me and S’s parents have never had an in person conversation! We’ve only kind of passed by each other. Prior to reaching out about graduation, I’d texted her to give her my cell number, and she’d texted me to wish me a happy Thanksgiving. Not much interaction but she has been super sweet thus far. I expressed I didn’t wanna intrude and offered to leave a day early if they wanted more time with S but she never acknowledged that. 

We worked our travel plans out, I received S’s dad’s number [~40M], we have the same flight booked and they were sweet enough to offer to house me, they booked a hotel with two bedrooms. 

I know both his parents are people I’d generally get along with- we’re all pretty left leaning people and they enjoy live music. That being said, I feel like I’m a hard pill to swallow, kinda. I’m a trans guy, I have an associates degree from art school, I’m training to tattoo, I have piercings. I’ve been told they don’t care but I also know that they told S they’d disown him if he got any tattoos/piercings. I’m autistic, I use mobility aids. I’m a stoner (I’ll be bringing a tincture for the trip probably, so I won’t have to worry about going outside). I work in a coffee shop and live with my parents right now while I’m trying to move out. 

I know they’re ok with S being gay but I know his mom has made comments to him about being careful when he helps give me my T-shots so he ‘doesn’t absorb excess testosterone that would make him fail his drug exams’ which is kind of a new level… it does NOT work like that. They’ve also kinda, ‘they, he, whatever’ ed me. S has some issues with his parents that I have a hard time reconciling with other positive values I know they have, I can’t get a read on them.

I know I’m overthinking. Please help me, give me some tips on how to impress them, or at least help me with what not to say. S’s father served in the military too, so I have to be very respectful about that (I know he isn’t super hardcore but I for lack of a better word am inexperienced and apprehensive about military stuff). Is there anything I should know about that from graduated navy members? I’m also worried about coming off masculine enough because I’m a huge flamer but I wanna be taken seriously as a man. 

We’re on a metal tube together for two hours, and then the drive, and then in a hotel without S, and I might have to share a bathroom with them, I’m so scared. I am so in love with their son and I don’t wanna blow this. I know I’m overthinking, but if you were meeting your kid’s partner like this, how would you want them to act?

Tldr; I have a lot of alone time coming up with my partner’s parents whom I’ve never met and I don’t wanna look like an idiot delinquent, help. ",1,1734837723.0,relationship_advice,4,1.0,False

I just got back from an incredible quick layover in Miami and wanted to share how I made the most of my 3 hours in this vibrant city. Trust me, even with limited time, you can experience some amazing things in Miami!

First off, if you're stuck at the airport with a few hours to kill, don't just sit there scrolling through your phone. Miami International Airport is actually pretty close to some cool spots, and you can definitely squeeze in some fun activities.

I used this awesome service I found at https://athometouch.com/miami to book a quick tour, and it totally changed my layover game. They have these perfectly timed excursions that fit into tight schedules.

Here's what I managed to do in just 3 hours:

Little Havana: This was a must-visit! I spent about an hour walking down Calle Ocho, grabbing a Cuban coffee (which honestly gave me enough energy for the rest of my day), and watching some older folks playing dominos at Domino Park. The vibe here is just different - it's like stepping into another country!

South Beach Quick Stop: I had to see those famous art deco buildings and get at least a glimpse of the beach. Even if you don't have time to swim, the architecture and atmosphere are worth checking out. Pro tip: The area around Ocean Drive is super walkable.

Wynwood Walls: This was probably my favorite part. The street art here is mind-blowing, and you can see a lot in just 30-40 minutes. Perfect for those Instagram-worthy shots!

For anyone planning a quick Miami visit, I'd really recommend checking out https://athometouch.com/miami - they've got these perfectly timed tours that help you maximize even the shortest layover. Plus, they handle all the transportation, which is huge when you're short on time.

Some quick tips I learned:
- Uber/Lyft are your best friends for quick transportation
- Keep your passport/ID handy - some places might ask for it
- Wear comfortable shoes
- Have some cash ready for small purchases
- Download offline maps just in case

The best part? You can actually see quite a bit of Miami's culture in just a few hours. Each neighborhood has its own unique flavor, and even a quick taste gives you a good sense of what makes this city special.

Just remember to give yourself enough time to get back to the airport - Miami traffic can be unpredictable!

1hjq2mb,https://www.reddit.com/r/CustodyForFathers/comments/1hjq2mb/mother_of_my_child_is_unstable_courts_arent/,Mother of my child is unstable courts aren't helping,"I'm currently waiting for the court dates for custody (that's right, I said dates as in plural.)

She decided she wanted to take our 14 month old on a 5 day trip to a rap concert and leave him in the hotel with her mom's boyfriend who's made sexual comments about her. I told her I was dead set against it, that I wanted to use vacation and watch him. Weeks of trying to talk to her and her saying she didn't want to at the time end with her having a mental break down, screaming the whole way home, then throwing a coffee cup at me. Like a steel yeti coffee cup. 

She kind of agrees to let me watch him, end of the month gets here, I took vacation for the weekend. I go to work, call on break, no answer. She calls a minute later saying shes out getting gas and will lmk when she gets home. I say ""they're giving voluntary time off, I might come home and spend time with you before you go."" She panicks, and after a few texts says she's 2 hours away at her mom's and didn't tell me because she knew it would bother me....

She takes him to NC (we're in VA) to an unknown city. A day goes by no contact, I get a video call on day 2, day goes by no contact, and day 4 she video calls from myrtle beach 9 hours away. Mind you, she's lost it if I went to my grandmother's for a night or 2 because ""he has a schedule and needs to sleep in his room"" as well as saying we couldn't take him on a 2 hour trip to VA beach because it's too far a trip for him. She knew taking him to the beach for the first time was something extremely important to me. Day 6 she finally shows up. 

By the end of the week I take her to an antique mall and get the 3 of us some stuff, take her to Starbucks, get us Chinese food,and the 3 of us some groceries. We get home and I say ""hey your pants are splitting"" she explodes saying not to check her out, and ends the argument with saying she's felt nothing for me for a year, then at all since we got together. She argues with me while I'm at work from 8pm to 1am. Long story short, she wants to go with me to my grandmother's with our son, I say, if you don't want to be around me you shouldn't go. She makes dozens of excuses including sleep deprived driving (she mad me drive her 2 hours to her moms on zero sleep after 12 hours and asked me to turn around and go home). She's extremely hypocritical. 

I go home,see them, take a nap, wake up at 9 and she's trashed the house and left with him and the diaper bag. No answer, mom calls and she says ""we had an argument, I'm going to mom's to let things cool off for a couple days."" She waits from Saturday night after staying til Sunday morning, to file an epo Monday afternoon. Saying he's breast fed and I can't feed him(he eats whole food) thati said I don't want to be alive, that he makes me sad when I see him, and that she fears for their lives (I never said anything like this).

I told her I was filing for custody the night she took off to the concert. Filed the next day,had to wait 10 days, when I showed up to finish filing they served me the EPO, kicking my custody request out. 11 days later she drops it the moment she can talk in court saying ""I thought it would give me custody, I just want it dropped so I can get my stuff back."" Then tells my mom she should have contacted her while the epo was in place...

I file immediately, then press charges for the coffee cup. Wait the 10 days, she's at the court for her preliminary hearing, sees me filing custody. On the 21st it's stamped and received. On the 1st of the next month her lawyer files in a county 2 hours away, she filed there the first time we did a custody battle she eventually dropped asking to come back, they told her then it wasn't supposed to be there that he did not live in that county. 

Now we have open cases in both counties, min filed first takes place Jan 14th, hers filed 11 days later on Jan 8th. For 2 months she refused to let us have any visitation. I begged til she told me 3 days or nothing at all. Talk to my lawyer, they said I can keep him longer. I keep him a week then try to work out 1 week with both of us, she says no, I keep him another week and tried again. She shows up, argues because ""you pressed charges."" (She took the plea bargain for a year probation, 1st offender status, drug testing, and a mental eval). She picks him up and refuses to let me touch him saying I'll never give him back, she calls the cops saying I'm keeping her there, I call because she's clearly not mentally well. They show up, tell her to put him in the car seat and leave. 

Its going on 2 more weeks no visitation. She says ""you broke your agreement and kept him longer than 3 days. I'm afraid of you. You called the cops when we met up. I don't have to let you see him."" When he was here, I made sure he got to video call her daily, she blew my phone up if I didn't answer immediately. She won't answer at all some days and I've video called him 4 times in 10 days. She's too busy. 

She canceled his 16 month Dr visit, and won't tell me if she set up with a new doctor. We both go to every appointment. The court has told me they don't know what an emergency custody hearing is, that they don't do them. Everyone including cps and the pediatrician have told me to try to get one. The lawyer says the 10 day wait, kicking my custody request out over the epo, none of it makes sense. ",1,1734837549.0,CustodyForFathers,0,1.0,False

1hjq1k3,https://www.reddit.com/r/MurderDronesOfficial/comments/1hjq1k3/parabellum_chapter_iii_shame_on_you/,"Parabellum, Chapter III: Shame on You","""I don’t like this,” Alice mused quietly, tapping her fingers on where the car door window met the panel, trying to keep her tone steady as unease finally crept into her casing. Nori curtly nodded in agreement, too fixated on the road that seemed to stretch for eternity and branch off into highways and intersections that led over there and headed there. She wondered if Nori even noticed the crowds of people shuffling about up and down the sidewalks in the ceaseless rain that hazed the streetlights and was finally showing signs of clearing up; some shooting glances that bordered on hateful, others simply going about their day, too enveloped in their own worlds to notice them, or even the Great Seattle Wheel just peeking over the short buildings that still seemed to loom large. Nothing about the situation she and Nori had found themselves in was inherently pleasing. Just short of an hour ago, Nori had gotten a notification, one that would normally herald an incoming Watcher scan, straight from HQ. After that came silence. Not a single stream of data from the Watcher, much to both drones’ concern. The obvious answer was just some anti-drone asshole from up high trying to leave them out to dry; but the one at the helm of this black-op, Nathaniel Cain, a weathered and worn man in his fifties with more than thirty years in the Bureau, was one that respected the two drones deeply for their commitment to their jobs, yet commanded their own at the same time. He was not likely to do something like this; though he had his grievances about drones. Plus, there was not one oldass up in Langley that would take the time out of their days to upend the night of two FBI agents, drone or not. 

   At least they hoped not. 

   Suddenly, streams of transparent data began to flood Nori's vision, nearly making her yank the steering wheel. Nearly. But there was something wrong with the stream. It carried the usual data that would come about after a Watcher scan, but it cut off at places; most particularly where the coordinates to the Watcher would be as it zipped about the regions of Seattle under the thick haze of night at its darkest. Nori's eyes widened nearly unnoticeably—but the other drone in the front passenger’s seat surely took notice of it, mainly due to Nori’s grip tightening ever so slightly on the wheel. Alice leaned forward, watching her friend and co-worker’s optics harden a bit more than they usually did. It was an almost imperceptible change, but Alice knew Nori enough to tell. She may have been a country girl, but she certainly didn't fit the stereotypical country airhead. “You okay, Nor?” Nori drew in a breath that held for far too long. *Get it together,* Nori scolded herself, her optics flickering from the road to the cross that hung from behind the top mirror. Unease rested in the pit of her stomach, then sunk lower, and the middle-aged drone wished she could just claw it out.

 

She had originally figured that perhaps a midnight drive before the first rays of light peeked through the darkness like a new life could ward off the oncoming stress that her perpetually neutral expression debarred her from showing. But that worked as well as Nori had predicted it would—that being it didn’t work at all. Fatigue infiltrated every corner, every part of her brain, and her limbs weighed heavy. It was a fight that took up nearly all of her remaining will merely to not let sleep consume her while she drove, or to slip her hand from the wheel. This exhaustion that infested Nori’s body like termites in a decrepit, rotting house was not one that could be washed away with a pill and two cups of coffee; no, certainly not. It was a certain exhaustion that slowly ate at Nori, blearing the edges of her vision and distressingly lightening her head, while forcing her limbs to no longer heed the order of her exhausted mind.

  The mind was the orderly; the one that was to command the body, and the body was to execute the order down to the very letter, regardless of condition;—but that was certainly not the case right now. Nori had been running on fumes, sleep elusive as ever. When she did finally have it in her grasp; morning chased, catching up with blinding speed. Too soon, too soon. Nori was plucked out of her trance by a nudge from her friend that nearly made the drone recoil, but Nori forced herself to show no response—to hide behind that emotionless expression she wore like a child taking cover behind their parent’s leg. “I’ll drive,” she began, gesturing to the steering wheel.  Nori responded by turning towards *Madison St.,* stopping at a blinking red light that cut through the rain that was now naught more than a light sprinkle compared to the earlier barrage. The streets were lit up by lights from buildings of all sizes and streetlights alike, neon lights, and the flashing red brake lights that illuminated the maze of concrete and towering steel. Nori didn’t exactly see the number, but she could just about make out the *Seattle Central Library’s* shimmering reflection from both the panels of glass, and the steel beams that criss-crossed it—the last transmitted position of the Watcher before the coordinates were cut. As much as the exhausted agent would love to spend hours on end ensconced in the bowels of the library with her face buried in a book as she had done years prior; now was not the time. Data came in sporadic bursts, even as she neared the last known location of the Watcher.

“You look like you’re about to nod off and crash the car, Nori. Pull over, I’ll drive.” She insisted in that country drawl she always carried, which only got an agitated side-glare from Nori in response. “I’m fine,” She grumbled, her optic twitching. Her hand once again nearly slipped from the wheel and onto the door panel as she slid the car into an empty parking space. Well, not exactly. The sign that stood above her car—painted an angry red and black—instead declared no parking for the day. Nori deadpanned, but then regained her neutral expression in a blink. Two quick glances showed no hint of police around to witness it. It was just a quick switch anyway, nothing would come of it—Nori needed to take a breather anyway. She had been running herself into the ground since she was sent back here—to her home city. The purple-haired drone’s chest heaved with exhaustion, her limbs tremored as she pulled the car door handle, pushing the door open and nearly stumbling to the concrete;—her blurred vision passing by the small elevation between the sidewalk and the road, yet she fortunately regained her footing before she dove face-first onto the wet, grimy Seattle concrete. The cold air that pricked her like a million needles certainly served as no safety net.

She had just begun to round the corner when in the corner of her optic, she spotted a small spark fly, then it disappeared as quickly as it came. She stopped in her tracks, sloppily spinning on her heel and squinting her optics, trying to get a good look at what laid beyond the darkened meshed fence, shadowed by buildings and foul-smelling dumpsters that mixed with the earthy musk of rainwater, wet leaves and damp concrete made its way to Nori's chemosensory receptors, to the drone's nausea. “Alice,” she called for her partner, in whom was just getting out of the front passenger’s seat. Her optics flitted about once more for a final check, then when she had reaffirmed that there was indeed nobody of note hiding themselves away, gestured for Alice to follow her. Reluctantly, the brunette drone closed the car door and followed Nori, breaking into a light jog to catch up. Once she did, she raised an eyebrow, leaning forward slightly as they walked, her auburn hair reaching down like a veil worn sideways.

   “Where exactly are we going?” There was a crack in Nori's continually calm expression at that question. Behind that veil of unreadable expression, a tidal wave of nervousness crashed over her being with unrivaled fury, settling within the deepest pits of her body and stubbornly refusing to dissipate. Was she seeing things? She stumbled once more. Even still, they couldn't afford to not investigate. But this could take up valuable time;—time that they could use to track down the source of the interference, and find their missing Watcher—

   Nori’s actively derailing thought train was frozen as if it had been caught in a stop-motion  freeze-frame when another small spark flew. This time, it was Alice that noticed—and tensed—at the sight, and she straightened upward. She quickened her pace, nearly shoving her way through the crowd, optics fixated on the nearly unnoticeable sparks that flew perhaps a couple centimeters out of the shadow of one of the dumpsters. The closer they got, the more the smell grew—a repugnant mixture of rat shit, half-eaten food scraps, and diapers that nearly made Nori jerk her head back when the smell greeted her. She gagged, burying her face in the crease of her elbow. “God, that fucking smells,” she mumbled, her optics sharpening in spite of her current physical state. She quickened her pace, hands balling into fists at the smell that still reached her chemosensory receptors just like the stench of blood did. Dry bile wormed its way up her throat, and it took all of her willpower not to double over and heave right then and there as they passed the open gate. Nori held in a cough as her optics fixed on a silhouette she could barely make out in the shadows that still dominated the alleyway as if it was midnight. For all she knew, there could be someone waiting right in front of her, and Nori would be none the wiser.

 Nori was damn thankful she took her pistol with her if that was truly the case, the good ol’-fashioned 9mm clipped to her waistband. She had always taken a liking to the feel of the weapon. Nestled behind two garbage bags and a dumpster that flies and insects audibly declared their research circle was a small cube-like machine, twitching intermittently, then stilling, small sparks still flying. That was their watcher, there was no doubt about that. Shit, shit. Some of its wires hung loosely, small strips that barely glinted. The very fact that the Watcher was out of commission in the first place was mind-boggling to the two drones. It was small, versatile, and extremely fast. Nobody would be able to land a clear shot on it while it was moving.
  But it did have a pattern. A two-second interval between bursts of speed, a stationary scan. Someone could’ve taken a shot. Nori’s hand flew to the side of her visor after grating out a swear, and she heard a faint blip. At least the newsies would have more to sink their teeth into after the Mackenzie murder.

 “This is agent Nori Doorman, we got a red-eight, I repeat, I have a red-eight.”

Viktoria slammed a patron’s head down onto the now blood-covered pool table, stumbling back and  watching their body slump to the ground before whipping around, ducking under a sloppy left hook;—nearly losing her footing and tumbling to the floor in a drunken haze, bile rising in her dried throat from the sudden motion. The bartenders had long since taken cover and waited for the storm to blow over, as it surely would. Viktoria had just about thirty minutes ago disarmed another drunken patron that had managed to grab the knife from its thread before she had (quite predictably), subsequently threw them out the window and onto the pristine plaza floor, tainting the shining white tiles with red that ran through the tiny slits of mortar in rivulets; much to the astonishment and horror of the outside onlookers. The drone had used everything and anything she could find in her drunken pull to win this maddening brawl—bottles, newspaper tablets, chairs, cue sticks; not a thing was off-limits in these types of fights—Viktoria knew that even in her scattered state. She swept her leg, tripping the patron and grabbing their tie, yanking them upwards slightly, her gaze hardening.

 

Just as she drew back her fist and responded with a strike of her own in spite of every movement feeling as heavy as lead; the garishly decorated main entrance to the bar squeaked open, revealing a late middle-aged, careworn man in a sharp black long-sleeve *L.L Bean* shirt and blazer of the same color. His dark silk cravat was straightened in his buttoned and folded collar, and he carried a cane, though he didn't need it to walk. It was far too short to pass as a walking cane anyway, he wasn't that old yet. Vik half-expected him to have a fedora on. His salt-n’-pepper hair caught the light while his pale gray eyes scanned the environment, his expression unreadable: overturned tables, his knife embedded in one of the wooden brocaded tables while the strings hung loosely from where the blade was formerly at, shattered bottles of alcohol he himself had paid for—though he paid for just about everything in this bar—writhing bodies strewn about the bar, some doused in fine liquor, others piled on top of other beaten patrons; moaning in agony. Viktoria’s heart sank to her stomach when she turned and got a good look at the man. She felt a cold sweat begin to bead on where her temples would be if she was human. This was ***Aurelio Rossi.*** This was the man that headed one of the most powerful crime families in the United States of America, and yet the public never knew he did.

   This was her adoptive father.

   Those eyes were ones associated with a blind man, a pale gray—nearly colorless set of orbs—though Rossi was anything but a blind man. He watched over every inch of his territories like a hawk scanning the landscape for unsuspecting prey. Though his presence did not stop the young drone from nearly emptying the contents of her burning stomach all over the barely conscious patron she had weakly pinned down. A surge of shame came with the position she found herself in, and a part of her wished to race to his feet in spite of the drone's rampant nausea—kneel, and clearly and calmly ask for forgiveness. She felt like a child being caught in a schoolyard fight, and her knees buckled slightly—mainly due to the alcohol which should definitely not have been that strong. “I didn't know there was a fight club here.” Rossi’s voice was calm—dangerously calm. He had that demeanor about him, and it helped him broker deal after very favorable deal. He spoke with the accent befitting of the stereotypical Sicilian mobster one would see on the old noir films, but it was far less pronounced, yet it was still noticeable.

He stepped into the near-destroyed *Imperator,* clicking his tongue twice. He had a habit of doing that, one Uzi playfully pointed out when she was seven—then never again. Yet this was not out of habit. Two men, whom Viktoria barely recognized in her drunken state even after she had shoved down the patron and struggled to her feet, rushed to her aid. Her legs became like jelly, her knees buckled as they gave out, and Viktoria doubled over, emptying the contents of her stomach once more—but there was only dried bile that never made it past the lower parts of her throat, and… *Oil?* Her world hazed, and she gurgled as her own lifeblood began to bubble upwards in her throat, alerts clogging her vision as her neon yellow optics began to grain with static. Viktoria’s hands flew to her throat as she fell helplessly on her side—then came a sudden rush, as if she was being carried away by some otherworldly force. Rossi said something Viktoria could barely hear over the ringing in her auditory receptors and she watched him step over her, holding his cane high above his head.

   He brought it down on the patron she had just let go of. Over, and over, and over again. Viktoria couldn't hear the sounds, but she could damn well imagine them. Viktoria’s mind filled in the blanks with distressing efficiency, replacing the incessant ringing with the sickening crack of bone and flesh meeting metal. She felt the body jolt with each hit, but the scene was blocked by the two men, one of which pricked her with something. What that was, Viktoria didn't know, or want to know for that matter. Her world became nothing but a series of abstract shapes and lights, and she could feel the warm oil flowing out of her agape mouth. She barely even registered being slung over the shoulder of one of the burly men. 

   Her vision began to darken around the edges, then the eigengrau tendrils seeped in to overtake the light faster than Viktoria could even register it. There was a flash of light that nearly dispelled the darkness, then as quickly as it came—darkness overtook it in a blinding rush.",3,1734837436.0,MurderDronesOfficial,0,1.0,False

1hjpyre,https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/1hjpyre/the_biggest_flaw_with_the_messengeraffinity/,The biggest flaw with the messenger/affinity system and the one small change that would fix it imo,"So, I apologize in advance if this is a bit far too long and rambley, especially as english isn't my first language, but I'd really be interested in other opinions on this problem.

As quite a lot of people, I think the best part about 1999 secretly is the entire dynamic built around the Hex, the friendship/dating affinity and the KIM messenger. DE really created something special with these characters, all six of them are very charming, have interesting personalities and dilemmas and are a joy to talk, or rather write to. But there is a big problem, that I feel like is holding the system back, especially in the future when new players get to this content and more and more information will be available in wikis and such.

First up, this isn't actually a necessity, I don't expect them to add this, it would just be very nice to have, I think it'd be great if DE could add an affinity meter. Not just the pretty vague flavor text in their profile that tells you whether they like/trust/etc. you, but a definitive bar with your current progress, how far away you are from the next relationship level, maybe even at which point the romance triggers (as that is different for every member).   
The reasoning for me wanting this will become more obvious with my main argument, but first, I know some will probably say, that this is incredibly inorganic for a system that so far has created very human and organic seeming characters and took great care to create a realistic atmosphere of how actual people write and behave in chat messages.   
And that is true, but still, if you tell me that sending someone four days back-to-back the same coffee mug as a gift and they end up becoming your friend or even your lover from that is realistic, or even more, afterwards the store telling you ""Sorry, those are the only four coffee mugs ever produced, there will never be another coffee mug"", I don't know what to tell you. In the end, it is still a ""gamey"" system for a videogame, and that is completely fine.   
A lot of us will have played games with similar games with similar relationship and gifting mechanics and a simple display of the current affinity level and progress would alleviate already a bit of the issues with my main problem, that I'll now come to.

Now, to be able to express this problem the best way I can, I'll just take my own account as an example. I didn't play the first day of 1999's release (I was still stuck on finishing Dark Matter Camo on the last guns in Black Ops 6 and promised a friend to help him with Marvel Rivals challenges), but I didn't think of it too much, missing out one day wouldn't be too bad, since I am LR2 and the higher standing cap would allow me not to fall too far behind.   
Then I started playing, did the quest, loved it, saw the way the Hex syndicate functioned, was delighted, because it was similar to Holdfasts, Cavia, etc. worked and went into an exterminate bounty, collected the medaillons, or in this case I guess gifts, repeated that a couple of times and turned them in at Lettie until my standing cap was reached.   
I saw that after I hit the exfil in the bounty I got a +Affinity with Lettie when I finsihed it (since the exterminate bounty was currently on her) but didn't even notice that that icon was gone the next couple of times since I was just focused on collecting the gifts for standing, and just assumed that you'd be able to repeat these as often as you want for some very small affinity until you hit their next relationship level.   
When I first started the KIM messages, I didn't even realize what the golden text was for. The dialogue choices are excellent themselves, especially since they lead to a lot of roleplaying opportunities for our drifter, so I assumed that DE wouldn't have any mechanic leading up to ""optimal"" choices for affinity to allow for more player expression in these dialogues (this inclusion is also not my problem, we'll come to that soon) and I just used the dialogue choices that most fit my drifter and the personality I had in mind for them.

Well, you see, the problem with the current situation is, that affinity per day is kind of capped, but if you mess up, you don't even hit that cap, falling behind everyone else's progress who do everything perfectly. In an ideal situation as soon as the new day starts and you start playing Warframe, you would:  
  
A) do the once per day bounty with your hex member of choice (or even better, all six of them) for the affinity boost  
  
B) gift them one of their personalized items they like as a gift  
  
C) hit all of the correct dialogue choices for all the golden text

Now the problem is, only step A is the one you can definitively not mess up, you'll always be able to do a bounty, even if you are not strong enough or mess up in one of the game modes, just try again. But if you mess up step B or C, well, that's it, you now wasted potential affinity gain for the day, better wait for tomorrow and hope you have more luck there.

Now, so far, I haven't messed up any gifts for any of the six, they are all fairly easy, but still for the players who did, this is already pretty bad, since they are already a bit behind everyone else. Step C for me personally led to the one character I wanted to romance being the furthest behind in relationship from all the characters, since, as I've written above, the first couple of days I just picked the dialogue choices I wanted for roleplaying purposes, leading to me having almost no golden dialogues with them and being massively behind in relationship in comparison with everyone else.  
Like, there is an in-joke with my friends, that I somehow always accidentally end up playing or maining latina characters in the games we play, and they geniunely can not believe that out of all six characters, what are the odds, Lettie is the one, that triggered romance first for me, already showing interest on the third day (as I said, the first couple of days, I only did bounties with Lettie on accident because she was always on an Exterminate bounty, missing out on all the affinity gain for everyone else). For the last two days now I couldn't even answer her conversations, since there was only one dialogue choice, basically immediately displaying romantic interest in her, so I just had to ignore her for two days, and afterwards I looked back at the first conversations with her, guess what, it's all just golden dialogue, I guess I just always said the right things to her, even though I'd just like to tell her, that I think she is really cool and all, I'm just not intested in her in that way.   
Now all five Hex members want to date me, but the one character I wanted to romance, before all of the protoframes were even revealed (Eleanor, since it was clear to me I'd romance the Nyx protoframe, she is my favorite frame since I started playing in 2014, or even since Dark Sector originally), I'm still waiting to have the first ""Date-Prompt"" in dialogue. I'm just annoyed that I'm so far behind specifically with her, the choices that led to it were my fault, but with no mechanic to compensate for ""wrong"" dialogues or gifts, I feel like I'm being needlessly punished for being so far behind than everyone else.   
  
The affinity with the Hex works more like the original 6 syndicates. With those you not only have the normal affinity cap, but all of the collectibles work additionally towards your progress. If you're a new player, and you start grinding your pledged syndicate and you miss collecting your 8 collectibles per mission on each day, you're technically missing out on progress, leveling up slower in them. Quite a few players I helped get into the game got a bit annoyed when I told them about that aspect of the system, because they felt, like they got unfairly slowed down and could have gotten further if that system would have been explained better for them and they were better equipped for collecting them. For us veterans, it's a no-brainer, most of the spots for them we know by hand or you just equip loot radar mods, but if you're new and you know you could have been so much further, that sucks.  
On the other hand, the new syndicates the last couple of years in all the updates have a quite intuitive system. Obviously if you can, you collect the corresponding collectibles in the missions and can turn them in at the vendors in each hub area. But if you somehow can't find them, or don't want to bother, guess what, it's no big deal, just play a couple of bounties more and you'll still reach your daily standing cap and don't fall behind. And the people who can collect the collectibles just have the nice bonus of being able to reach the standing cap a bit sooner each day (or save them for other purposes).

A similar system for affinity would be nice. As I said in the beginning, it's a very video-gamey system any way, so you don't have to adhere to restrictions and limits that interfere with the actual very cool messenger system and the way players interact with it. I'm not even doing any of the other five conversations of the Hex member today, because I'm that scared of accidentally locking in a romance, even though I really like all of them and would like to talk to them.  
So, just a simple change, that would make the affinity system based on a cap, and when you send the correct gifts and pick golden dialogue choices, you have it a bit easier (as would turning in collectibles at vendors for the other syndicates), but instead also having the choice to repeat the bounties with each member until you reach some kind of daily affinity cap would go a long way.   
You wouldn't progress any faster than DE currently obviosuly intends for players, but players also wouldn't feel forced to choose between roleplaying dialogue choices that represent their own drifter and the dialogue choices that the other character wants to hear, but is totally out of character for yourself, taking a lot of the pressure of the player and just leaving them another route to progress with the Hex affinity.",1,1734837143.0,Warframe,1,1.0,False
1hjpyd0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualPH/comments/1hjpyd0/what_are_the_surprises_you_have/,What are the surprises you have received/experienced this 2024?,"Because life can be full of surprises, good or bad. 

Medj inspired by last night's simbang gabi homily tsaka ung mensahe sa Misa. God reveals Himself through surprises, and He has a reason for them. At sa pagtanggap natin sa mga ito nang buong puso, maari nawa tayong makaranas ng tunay na SAYA - simplicity, adaptability, yes to God's will, and availability for others. So, what are those surprises that may have shaped our lives, particularly this year 2024?

The first one happened even before this year started. Na-stroke daddy ko exactly a week after leaving my first job. Oo, December last year to naganap, but it shook us in terms of paano mairaraos at least early this year. So habang wala pa uling work, though I put off job hunting for the moment, sinamahan namin ni mommy muna si daddy habang pinatuloy sa condo unit ng isang tita ko, though supposedly taking turns with ate and her husband sa pag-alalay sa kanya pati sa mga rehab sessions, until eventually tinopak sila ate na medj ma-pride at di na muna uli nagparamdam. Btw iba pa ung lumang bahay namin sa Pasig, and di pa feasible na tumira na uli doon especially for him that time. And things were just about to turn quite sour dahil hindi na nahkakasundo sina mommy at daddy, hanggang sa na-trigger siguro ung anxiety disorder which involved manic episodes si mommy, so she decided to leave him muna with tita at magpahinga muna rito sa Antipolo para hopefully mahilom ung psychological issue niya. Nainis ung father's side relatives ko especially tita with her move without understanding na may pinagdadaanan siya, easily dismissing as if inabandona niya ang responsibilidad to take care of daddy. Di rin kasi ako maaasahan lalo na kung may work ako so madalas wala ako sa tabi nila. Leading to her decision na wag muna makihalubilo sa kanila pag may family gatherings etc. On the relatively good side, bumubuti na lagay ni daddy, though not yet 100% recovered.

Sa akin naman is regarding my 2 jobs I had this year. Ung una is natanggap as a barista/dining staff sa isang Singaporean concept cafe/resto, training sa isang mall in Ortigas for a branch in Antipolo na soon-to-open pa lang that time. That's somehow a good surprise after 5 months matengga, but would be riddled with at least 2 unpleasant ones. First bad surprise, x ray result as part of a medical exam requirement shows na may pulmonary disease ako, and pulmonologists advise me na magpahinga muna from work and take prescribed meds, and was even marked AWOL kahit nagpaalam naman sa visor ko. Although we did everything including sputum tests and a second xray para makita na cleared talaga ako at nakakuha na rin eventually ng pulmo clearance as also needed, despite a misdiagnosed disease, after 1 1/2 months work the 2nd bad surprise was termination from the job. Mostly health reason, though would affect my performance. Surprisingly malaki nagastos ko, from some initial meds ending up useless dahil wala talagang sakit, to buying new shoes and for my uniforms, prompting me to pull out one of my 2 investments na medj lugi.

Another is ung mabilis ding nakakuha ng panibagong work, this time as a dessert store crew, starting within 2 weeks after being let go sa naunang work. Thinking na na-enjoy ko naman ung work, medj maraming gawa though not as physically demanding as previous jobs, and hoping na tumagal. But on a day-off after Undas weekend, I got another unfortunate surprise, a memo of discontinuation of probationary employment, with my performance falling short sa standards as reason, despite I felt na ginagawa ko naman best ko during those 4-5 months.

So planning to rest it out this holiday season muna. Though nagtry na rin magpasa ng mga applications, expected na this December na maaring matumal, taking into consideration na either busy na mga kumpanya or paubos na hiring budgets or both. But a few surprises came, first one is supposedly applying for admin assistant sa isang coffee shop based in Taytay, but considered for a sales associate sa mother company nila based in Ortigas at nagka-interview, pero ended up unsuccessful kasi di natanggap. Di nagtagal, got an opportunity sa isang sales account executive for a residence hotel sa Ortigas, pero pending pa interview results until Janaury when may final interview pa with general manager daw. And nung isang araw, nakatanggap uli ng interview invite which I chose the January schedule, this time for a brand associate for food ng isang retail company based in BGC. The last 2 is di pa sure if magiging successful, I'll wait and see after new year.

So what else in store for the remainder of 2024 that may come as a surprise? Or gearing up for 2025, what other surprises may be waiting?

She’s a SAHM even though our kid goes to an $1,850/mo preschool for most of the day. I earn a great income, $750K/yr this year but come from humble beginnings. 

Made the mistake of joint bank accounts and credit cards early on and fell into the trap of taking care of her short-term which turned into long-term. Regret that a lot. 

She gets a “anything” budget of $1,200/mo from my paycheck which she spends on clothes, kid stuff, coffee etc. I contribute to our shared retirement, pay all housing and bills etc. After groceries I am barely left with $300 for myself.

But even after some stern talking to, she can’t stop swiping swiping swiping. It never ends. Especially around the holidays - buying gifts for neighbors, UPS guy, dog next door, it’s maddening. 

I am regularly closing up credit cards, changing numbers, etc. But eventually she will get her hands on one and my trust is totally eroded around this. Today, she asked for a card to use for an amazon order of necessities and I said “No.” because I know she’ll save it and next week a dozen packages will arrive at my door, full of shit we don’t need. I feel like I’m being taken advantage of and a total sucker. 

I’m withdrawn, resentful and have become an alcoholic - for other reasons of course - and believe me the last thing I want to do is blow up this marriage and have us both living the single parent life. I’m here to fight for what we’ve built. 

Sorry for the rant. Going through it this holiday season and having trouble seeing how this sorts itself out. Couple’s therapy is probably necessary.

He told me he'd lost his sight in an accident when he was 22. Over the years, I've helped him navigate daily life, read him documents, described movies to him, and been his support system. We got married 4 years ago and have built what I thought was a beautiful life together.

Last week, I came home early from a business trip (I was supposed to be gone for another three days). I walked into our house and found Mike sitting on the couch, without his glasses, reading a physical book and watching TV. Not audiobook. Not text-to-speech. Just... reading. Normally.

When he heard me, he jumped up and tried to quickly put his dark glasses on, but it was too late. I stood there in shock as he tried to explain. Apparently, he started faking blindness years ago to get out of jury duty (I know, I know). Then it somehow snowballed when people started treating him differently, and he found it easier to get jobs because companies wanted to appear inclusive. When we met, he planned to tell me the truth, but then ""fell in love for real"" and was afraid I'd leave him.

He's been maintaining this lie for over a decade. He got so good at it that he even fooled actual blind people in the support group we attended. He learned Braille. He got a service dog (who was actually just a very well-trained pet). He let me describe our wedding day to him, for god's sake.

I moved out immediately and am staying with my sister. Mike is begging for forgiveness, saying the love was real even if the blindness wasn't. His family (who knew the truth) are saying I'm being cruel - that it started as a stupid mistake but turned into something he couldn't get out of. They say divorcing him over this would be ableist since I'm basically punishing him for NOT being disabled.

My sister thinks this is hilarious and says I should write a book. My parents think I'm overreacting because ""at least he's not actually cheating."" But I feel like my entire relationship was built on a lie. Every moment of intimacy feels tainted knowing he could see me the whole time.

I (34f) am a stay at home mom since having our second child. I was standing in my apartment living room with the blinds open, rocking my 6m old daughter when I looked up and saw my husband's truck as it was pulling away on the back of a tow truck. Husband wasnt home as he was helping his mom.

I called him immediately and told him his truck was just towed away. He stated ""Ok, I'm leaving now"" and hung up. I'm sorry but what?! I was expecting him to freak out but he didn't seem surprised. 

We both made the decision for me to stay home with our daughter for the first year of her life. I still have my job and work 2 days out of the month to keep my discount for vet services and because I love my employer and coworkers. 

What I didn't know was that my husband can't support us and is absolutely horrible with money. We would need to come up with 4,500 to get the truck back. We don't have it. And come to find out not only was he a couple months late on his truck payments but he is also 5 months behind on our rent. We haven't had groceries fully stocked in a couple months either. 

My car was stolen in February and my insurance paid out my loan but it left me without a car. My mother in law was so sweet to let me use my late father in laws cars to get the kids around for appointments and school. So we do have a vehicle to use for him to get to work. Silver lining I guess.

As title states, I went to a dentist today and didn't exactly walk away with what's going on.

Today is Saturday.

On Thursday around 6pm and sat down to eat dinner. I was eating some rice when I bit down on my right 2nd molar and felt some general sensitivity. 2/10 uncomfortable and it faded quickly.On Friday morning, I drank my coffee and the heat was not fun. 5/10. Again, faded quickly (under 5seconds). Eating a soft, but hot lunch again that day didn't feel great. It wasn't pain, but very sensitive. 

Biting down does not elicit pain. Releasing from a hard clench feels odd tho. (We would call this rebound tenderness in sports med). Cold air does not bother it. Cold liquids are sensitive (ie ice water). Crunchy foods feels odd, but not painful. I do not feel this sensitivity or any pain walking, jumping, or at rest. 

Had X-rays in early November for routine cleaning. Nothing abnormal.I did have two precautionary fillings done bilaterally on my back molars. (They were not giving issues at all). Those were my only dental issues to date (I am 32M). 

Regular brushing and flossing.

Dentist took X-rays today. Nothing abnormal. She blew air on the tooth, tapped VERY hard with metal tool, and used a tool for me to bite down on. No pain elicited. Her initial thought was a crack, but said I showed no signs of it though her tests.

I will note, my allergies have been acting up and I have hx of tooth pain on the other side of my mouth with sinus pressure (but nothing to this degree )This is where my brain is leading me. I have also been under crazy stress at work for end of year and I tend to clench in my sleep. 

I am relieved my tooth isn't cracked, but I still don't have relief from the sensitivity. Any options or opinions? ",1,1734836911.0,askdentists,1,1.0,False

I wanted to share my experience exploring San Diego, since I just got back from an amazing trip there. I've discovered some incredible spots that I think you'll love.

First off, let me tell you - San Diego is way more than just beaches and SeaWorld (though those are awesome too). The city has this perfect mix of chill vibes and exciting stuff to do.

I started my afternoon at Balboa Park, which is basically paradise for anyone who loves culture, nature, or just hanging out. The architecture is stunning - those Spanish-style buildings will make you feel like you've stepped into another world. The botanical gardens are free and absolutely gorgeous. Pro tip: grab a coffee from one of the local cafes and just wander around.

Then I headed to Little Italy (trust me, you won't regret it). The food scene there is incredible. I had the best pizza I've eaten in months at one of the local spots. The whole neighborhood has this awesome atmosphere with string lights and outdoor seating everywhere.

For sunset, I went to Sunset Cliffs - and wow. Just wow. The views are absolutely breathtaking, and if you time it right, you'll get to see the most amazing colors in the sky. Bring a blanket and maybe some snacks, and thank me later.

Here's something cool I discovered - there are actually tons of guided tours and activities you can book in San Diego. I found this awesome website https://athometouch.com/SanDiego that has all sorts of options. I booked a food tour through them and it was seriously one of the highlights of my trip.

If you're into marine life, La Jolla Cove is a must-visit. You can see seals and sea lions just chilling on the rocks! The tide pools are super cool too, especially if you're going with kids (or if you're just a big kid at heart like me).

For those interested in history, the Gaslamp Quarter is fantastic in the afternoon. The Victorian architecture is beautiful, and there are tons of cool shops and restaurants to check out. It gets pretty lively as the day goes on.

One last tip - if you're planning your trip and want to make the most of your time, definitely check out https://athometouch.com/SanDiego. They've got everything from harbor cruises to food tours, and it's super easy to book. I wish I'd known about it before my first visit!

Being in San Diego feels like being on vacation even if you're just there for an afternoon. The city has this magical way of making you forget about all your stress. Whether you're into nature, food, history, or just want to relax, you'll find your perfect spot here.

Remember to bring sunscreen and stay hydrated - that California sun is no joke! Let me know if you check out any of these places. I'd love to hear about your experiences!",1,1734836558.0,AskTheTraveler,0,1.0,False

1hjpr9c,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1hjpr9c/aio_for_being_scared_of_my_theatre_director/,AIO for being scared of my theatre director?,"I’ve been a part of my school’s theatre program for 3 years now. I’m currently a student director but I used to be in crew, which was lead by our crew director that I’ll call H.

Some important contex: I’m very socially awkward and don’t understand social cues. I’ve been made fun of and ostracized for this both currently and in the past, and one of the main people that did that is my step-sister, who I’ll call Emma. Emma basically bullied me for three years until our relationship got better around last year, and the way she treated me lead to pretty severe self-esteem issues. 

H is also socially awkward and bonded with a lot of people in crew (including me) over that. During tech week dinner, he would sit with the rest of crew and talk with me and a few other people. Overtime I grew pretty comfortable around him and saw him as someone I could trust. H also made me feel better about social awkwardness and some of my self-esteem issues actually started healing. 

Everything was pretty good until production for last year’s spring show began. Someday during crew last January, I was talking with H about something (I don’t remember what) and I was pretty excited. After I was done speaking, H says “now I know why your mom looks so exhausted all the time”. 

It hurt to hear him say that [as he was someone I trusted] and ruined a lot of the progress I had made with my self-esteem. At the time I wasn’t really mad at him because I figured that he was just having a bad day. 

Now in hindsight, I think that it was a pretty rude thing to say, especially as an adult and an authority figure. I know that I’m annoying but even if he was having a bad day I think he should’ve at least apologized after since it’s his job to harbor a welcoming environment for students. 

Around a month later, my school held a coffee shop fundraising event. For context, people from crew will often volunteer to help out with setting up/moving things, sound, or lighting for events held at the school. I was volunteering that day and once we were finished setting up we got to basically chill and eat dinner until the event was over and we’d help put away everything. Everyone was sitting at the tables in the back of the room and H walked up to the table we were at which startled one of the other students (H has a habit of “appearing out of nowhere”).
H joked that he hopes that none of us have to be that scared of adults. I joked back that “my parents already ruined that for me” (these types of jokes are pretty normal amongst crew). H responded almost immediately saying that he “at least knows that my mom tries”. H does not know my mom well, is not her friend, and hasn’t spoken to her more than an hour collectively. 

This hurt since I considered him someone I could trust and could go to about my problems at home if I built up the courage to. It also made me somewhat scared of him since in my mind, if he was willing to defend my mom with barely any information then he might be willing to hurt me like she did (I know that this is pretty illogical but it still made me scared). 

Again, in hindsight, this is a pretty fucked up (and not to mention weird) thing to say. H is a mandated reporter, he has literally gone through training on how to react in situations like this. I’m pretty sure that what he said is not what they teach to do. 

After that incident I started to notice that H would treat me as if I didn’t know what I was doing and was constantly going to fuck things up. I had been in crew over a year at that point, rarely messed up, and was trusted by student leadership to work on parts of a project alone or occasionally lead a small group of people. And I was the only person he treated like this. Even the people who spent basically the entirety of every build day on their phones (a huge no-no since being distracted is dangerous due to us using power tools) were treated like competent people. This made me more scared of him since he would always blame me for anything going wrong with a project and get mad. 

Eventually tech week rolled around and it seemed like things were actually getting better. He trusted me to be the only person to help him out with doing a pretty hard job and he seemed to be seeing all the hard work that I was doing. I started to get my hopes up about him and thought that maybe everything before was just some weird phase. 

During strike (when we dismantle almost everything from the show we just did), I wanted to take initiative and show him that I could be good. I asked the person leading the group I was a part of if I could unscrew the facing from the platforms, they said yes and so I started doing it. When I had gotten most of the screws out of the facing, H shows up pissed and starts yelling at me that we aren’t getting rid of the platforms. I told him that I had asked the person leading my group if I could and that they had said yes. He stopped yelling at me and went to go talk with the person (who he didn’t yell at). 

Because of the way my parents have treated me I get really scared and panicked when adults yell at me. After he went away I basically just went to the bathroom and cried before coming out and sitting on the couch for the rest of the little time (which at that point was just sweeping the stage) that was left of strike. 

After that happened, my fear of him solidified. I tried volunteering for an event again about two weeks after but I couldn’t manage to stay the entire time because I was terrified of him being mad at him. The rest of the school year was mostly fine since I didn’t have to see him for crew anymore and since he works as technology support for the school I rarely ever saw him in the halls. 

I decided that I wasn’t going to participate in the fall show since I was still scared of him and I didn’t care that much about the show to suffer through seeing him everyday. I did however, still decide to volunteer for the show days by helping sell tickets as it’s something I could do and still almost never have to see him. Volunteers are allows to have the dinner that’s provided to the cast and crew of the show, but it wasn’t made clear whether or not we were only allowed to eat after everyone from cast and crew got a plate. I was scared about making the wrong decision but in the end my younger sister (who is in crew) just ended up grabbing me a couple of slices when she went through the line. I ended up having a panic attack because I was terrified that I might actually not be allowed to get food yet and that H might see and yell at me for having food already.

Here’s where my current problem with him is: H is the assistant teacher for my film class. He’s in said class at least once a week and when I asked my teacher to critique my work and he showed up halfway and started critiquing it too. I already have somewhat of a problem with not taking critique to heart but hearing from him what I did wrong freaked me out. I had to leave class to go to the bathroom where I had a panic attack and cried. Some more context: Emma would make fun of everything I liked and things I did (everything I did was stupid and wrong to her) and that made me scared of working in front of others on creative work for fear of them making fun of me. I’d kind of gotten over that fear and had been able to actually edit videos during film class but H being there and being able to see what I’m editing reignited that fear. 

I love film class, I love editing, and I want to be able to do stuff in that class but I’m too scared to with him present. 

A few weeks ago, I was telling Emma about this dilemma and she said that it was stupid that I’m scared of some guy that yelled at me once and that I’m overreacting. 

Before I had pretty much thought that how I’m feeling is justified but now I really don’t know. I was going to talk to my film teacher about how I feel about H but I’m starting to think that maybe it is stupid to be afraid of him when he was just mean to me sometimes.

My husband and I budget our expenses and both work hard and make decent money. The issue is the debt to income ratio. He makes roughly $1800 take home biweekly. I have a contracted position which varies anywhere from $2000-4000 per month before we set aside 35% for tax. We are currently behind in that savings because we recently moved and are expecting a baby in April, so we’re trying to catch up with that but will likely still need to do a payment plan with the irs come tax time. 

Here’s a rough breakdown on monthly expenses: 
Debt - 
student loans - $1,100 min payment 
car payments - $528
credit card - $240 min payment
Rent - $1300
Car insurance - $250
Electric - $150-300 varying 
Internet - $75

We have other expenses like gas and groceries, but thankfully live in a small town and we really aren’t big spenders. It helps that we don’t really have coffee shops or fast food here. 
Because we’re expecting a baby soon, there’s the addition of medical expenses as well.
I’m sure I’m forgetting something, but we are overwhelmed and can’t seem to figure out how to get ahead. Looking for any advice on here or finding a financial planner or just what to do. I always try to budget smart and keep track of everything but it feels like what we owe and what we make won’t allow that to happen. 
We know forbearance is an option with student debt but we’re trying to avoid that. Any advice would be helpful!

Summary

The Commander has found himself at the research facility, along with some of his friends and people from his inner circle within Azur Lane, but no matter how much more information each one brings, more questions are brought up. Especially the questions regarding the misterious bear rigging, which they have yet to ascertain who it belongs to or when they might have arrived to the base. Those questions remain unclear until Chkalov decides to make some time and give a -brief- explanation of what they have been working on.

# Chapter 2: Theoretically explaining.

Just when they decided to go and have a word with the girls from the research department, in order to have them take some sort of break, as well as getting a better explanation out of them, more people started showing up at the research room.

The next one to open the door was Bismarck, getting everyone’s attention as she made her way towards the Commander, politely greeting everyone present.

“Commander, everyone.” She greeted, nodding at the Commander and then at everyone else, before coming to a sudden stop.

“Er, who is this child? I don’t recognize him.” Bismarck stated, looking slightly confused by the presence of the metallic bear that remained seated by the Commander’s left side.

Bismarck got closer to the bear until she got its attention, as it looked at her, she simply stopped, looked at it in the eyes, and rather than trying to reach it, she nodded at it and did nothing more.

Everyone had halted what they were saying or doing in order to take a look at the interaction, to be able to witness the moment in which the spiritual Leader of the Iron Blood made a rigging acknowledge her, it was not something someone was able to simply see just any day.

Even if it was sometimes one of the most mundane events to take place in Azur Lane.

In response to her gesture, the bear simply nodded back, as if greeting her, she did nod back minutely in turn again, being well acquainted with how to treat even the rowdiest of riggings, or the rowdiest rigging owners for that matter.

“Er, we don’t really know.” The Commander said, looking at the bear as well “The girls here seem to be all over the place, we haven’t gotten a straight answer out of them since we arrived.”

The Commander told Bismarck, who in response furrowed her brows.

“I have come as requested.” She said with some manner of discomfort evident. “But now I worry about the girls here though, they seemed to have requested for Z23 to attend as well. As you know, she is on a trip with her friends. I thought this was well known through the base, given her important role as one of your attendants. Yet somehow, they asked for her to be present.”

The Iron Blood leader said, earning a few furrowed brows as well as quizzical looks from those present. Z23 and her friends were well known by everyone at the base, they were a bright and cheerful bunch, their friendship was a reminder that mutual help and trust on each other was possible regardless of their past or which faction they belonged to.

Even some of the Azur Lane human personnel who had some sort of initial doubts against the Kansen had quickly developed a soft spot for the four cheerful destroyers.

As such, it was more or less unthinkable that someone would have completely missed them not being in the base. Especially a multi-factional team such as the one from the research department.

As they were wrapping their heads regarding such a colossal slip from their friends, which only made everyone more concerned about their current state, the door to the room opened once more making everyone turn to see who was the next one to come in.

The one that showed up at that moment was one of the Commander’s trusted secretaries, Helena.

“Ah, Commander, everyone. I’m glad to see you could attend. The girls made it sound like this meeting was rather important.”

Helena made her way towards the group, nodding in acknowledgement to everyone in the room and sharing a quick hug with a few of them as well. She only stopped once she was in front of the Commander, she  had halted her movements as soon as she noticed the bear beside the Commander.

“Er… good day to you” She said tentatively towards the bear, bowing minutely towards it, a polite and neutral gesture that worked wonders on the multinational environment of Azur Lane.

In response the bear nodded back in acknowledgement, then it looked at her, holding her gaze for a couple of seconds, before looking to the side as if content with the exchange.

“Er, ok then. Commander! Here, take a look at this” she said, giving him a clipboard she was carrying.

“This all seemed to be all over the place, so I thought you might want to check on this. The research department sent us two lists of people for this gathering.” She stated as she pointed at the first page on the clipboard.

Quickly looking at the paper, the Commander quickly realized that all the people listed were either people from his inner circle, or people with whom he had developed strong bonds one way or another, as Lieutenant Yannis’s presence indicated.

“Most of the people in the first list confirmed they would attend, with some of them still obviously yet to arrive” She said after looking at those currently present.

“Most were able to make changes to their previous arrangements to come, with the exception of people not currently present on base. Although we were told to try and convince the people there to ‘come back as fast as possible for this’, even though that was simply unrealistic.”

At the mention of that, everyone’s thoughts went back again to the mentioned slipup regarding Z23. Now it was obvious she was not the only one requested to be present that was way out of reach.

“Wait, you mentioned there were two lists of people, Helena.” King George said, one finger to her lips as she was taking mental note of what the Commander’s secretary had said.

“er… yeah… the second list is… a bit different… this is a list of the -must not attend-” she said wincing at the mention of this.

The Commander raised an eyebrow at this, echoing a shared feeling regarding such a statement.

“That- Just… let me take a look at this list.” The commander flipped onto the next page, to look at the second list of people that Helena had given him on the clipboard.

As the commander went over the names, his expression became troubled at first, when he had finished it, he actually seemed to have become somewhat tired.

“This… this is bad, if anyone within the list gets to see it, it would surely mean trouble.”

“I agree, Commander” Helena stated. “There is only one copy of this, I wanted to show it to you, once this endeavor has taken place, I am to destroy this piece of evidence”

“We have taken measures so that the people listed here won’t be attending, we requested assistance from people that can be discreet about such a thing, while helping us to keep them busy as well.”

Helena made such an assurance with a solemn tone that disquieted more than one among those present. Her words had created such a concern, that even the usually composed Enterprise moved closer to the Commander to take a look at the list, to which in turn he simply gave her the clipboard for her to look at it at her own leisure, making a gesture with his hand towards everyone else, indicating that it was not an issue to share it among those present.

“Oh… Yes, I agree. This would surely create some friction to say the least.” She said.

“Care to give us a hint about it, Enterprise?” King George said as she turned to look at the Union carrier.

For her part, Enterprise handed the clipboard to Belfast, who had remained beside King George, which in response nodded minutely and put the document in front of king George while standing by her side, so the two of them could see their contents.

“Seems to be composed of every girl out here that has a… Passionate… personality.” Enterprise said after she found some more tactful words to convey her thoughts on the matter.

“It seems to be composed of every woman in this base that would still openly make a quarrel regarding your marriage with the Commander.” King George said dryly.

“Well, honestly that sounds like a reasonable list to have for most events, just common sense to veer away from the yanderes at this point” Lieutenant Yannis with a dry chuckle.

There was a snort in response at that, it was soon followed by a couple snickers, it was a very unladylike snort that came from an unexpected source, which as a result made more of them laugh back, a result of those currently present being quite comfortable with each other. But aside from that no one seemed to prepare themselves to refute his words.

The Commander simply grunted in response to that. Even after being married to both Enterprise and Belfast there were a few of the girls that refused to treat him differently, some for the better, a handful for the worse.

He had never intended to become some sort of heartbreaker, nor he had pushed any sort of advances on them. He had been clear to them that he had no intention to pursue them in either a romantical nor a physical way, but that hadn’t deterred them, nor it seemed like they were willing to listen to him. From his perspective they all had developed extreme fixations on him as well as some degree of lovesickness. He had personally seen experts as well as talked with their friends and family about various ways to help them.

That was the very least he could do, otherwise he felt like he was robbing them of the opportunity to have a full life, with him being sort of an obstacle by not being part of their lives.

 

“I think we are getting more questions rather than answers out of this” Belfast said, interrupting everyone’s thoughts on the subject.

She had obviously sensed how the subject had troubled him, as per usual he felt quite troubled regarding this particular matter. In such times he always felt blessed by the support of his friends as well as his wives.

“Oh! I think this is more than enough people to give the first explanation.” Chkalov had arrived while everyone was preoccupied with the list of people that Helena had brought, surprising everyone by seemingly appearing out of nowhere.

She stood and eyed everyone without saying anything else, with her hands in the pockets of her coat, she nodded a couple times acknowledging something she had yet to speak of.

“Ideally the little booklets should provide all the information, saving us the time to give an explanation. But that’s unrealistic, as there is always room for some misinterpretation. Waiting for everyone to be present, in order to explain things only once, would be also quite unlikely, especially when time is such an issue. So, I believe our goal is to only explain things twice, thrice tops, with a misunderstanding rate on the minimum.”

Chkalov explained, but it seemed more or less like she had explained things mostly to herself, as her focus had slipped at some point and it looked like she had begun making calculations on how to best solve an issue, in this case, the issue of how to repeat oneself the least.

“Er… care to explain… more in, uh, layman terms?” Lieutenant Yannis said.

“Yes, that’s a great idea too!” Chkalov said excitedly.

“Well, you see, the thing is, we seem to be running out of time. Or rather, things will get complicated the more time we allow to pass” She said as she shook her head with her hand at her temple.

“That fellow over here” She gestured towards the metallic-bear-rigging who had remained besides the Commander. “That’s the praetor cube that Doctor Bethencourt gave to the Commander.”

Her words shocked everyone present, resulting in everyone looking at the bear once again and then looking back at the Northern parliament girl, to make sure she wasn’t pulling a fast one on them.

“Have to give it to him, the doctor is both a genius as well as a madman. He discovered the way to prepare an -adaptative wisdom cube matrix-” Chkalov said as she gestured with her hands as if clomping together several cubes floating in the air onto a smaller space.

“The objective of the praetor cube is to anchor itself to the -concept- of whoever is to be the final user and then function like an external armor that holds various capabilities similar to those of a Kansen.”

“At least that is the simplified version he himself described in his papers. We have gone through those extensively, we did not want to leave anything to chance, especially after the first accident happened”

Chkalov gestured towards the bear again, who in turn seemed content to simply be mentioned.

“What do you mean by that? There have been no reports of any emergencies in the research department” Helena stated, obviously bothered by the idea of an accident having happened within the base, holding her gaze on Chkalov.

“Oh, it was not that kind of accident” Chkalov responded while gesturing vaguely around the place.

“As we tried to analyze the Praetor cube, in order to find out if it was safe to even consider making use of it, and making sure it held no possible backdoors to exploit an easy access to the Commander, the cube started reacting to the equipment we were using as well as to our prodding. In the end the cube absorbed the equipment as well as the table it was on along with anything that was stored in the table’s compartments.”

At that she gestured for them to follow her, leading them closer to the tables in the lab room, grabbing a mug of coffee that was sitting on the table and then she gestured at the area right next to it, one area much more open than the rest. Now that everyone was paying attention to what she was saying, marks of furniture emplacement became evident, holes for where one of the metallic tablets would be safely held on the ground.

“That was a response of the cube attempting to synchronize with its surroundings, in turn absorbing the table along with various gadgets and books that were stored on that table. Most of those were from the motherland, which in turn resulted in it looking as it does right now.”

Everyone eyed the bear, who in return just nodded, as if agreeing with everything that had been said. The bear really looked the part of a Northern Parliament rigging, and after hearing Chkalov’s explanation, it made some sort of sense, if it could adapt to the user, it would reflect some traits of the user in the same way that riggings would show traits and parts of a Kansen’s vessel.

“Given the many possibilities, this was not an -ideal- result, as we could have arranged for a combined influx of influences for it to take shape. But my personal bias is that this is a good outcome, nonetheless. It has the commanding look of a northern Parliament Rigging, as well as the responsiveness of one.”

Chkalov took a sip of her coffee at that, seemingly lost in her thoughts for a second.

“It would have been interesting to see something less ‘organic’, like a rigging from the eagle union, but that would have created issues about compatibility between a living being and a ‘machine rigging’…”

“But I digress…” She said after taking another sip at her coffee “Simply put, the more time that the praetor cube remains untethered to the Commander, the greater the chances for it attach itself to someone else or even worse, to get the wrong idea of who the Commander is, either by simple hearsay or by the treatment it receives by us, which is reflective of the Commander and how he handles situations. Think of it as getting the wrong first impression by not being present, even if it was not his fault”

“Say, if it has come to this, why not ask for Doctor Bethencourt for assistance? He was the creator of this after all.” Lieutenant Yannis said, to which a few of them nodded their heads while others remained pensive on the question.

“Well, there are a couple reasons.” Chkalov said as she lifted two fingers “For starters, since this involves the Commander, we didn’t want to leave such an important role to someone who is foreign to Azur Lane, to us. He created it, as such he could be able to slip by any new backdoor or malicious influence without us being able to do anything about it.”

“The second is that he really doesn’t know the Commander, we are sure he has ways to overcome the problem with synchronizing to the concept of the Commander, but there are guarantees it would lead to the best result either.”

“There is also the matter of our pride as researchers and scientists, but we will not count that towards our main reasons.” She said much more quietly, almost like a secondary thought that had slipped past her lips.

“We made some plans regarding the best way to allow it to synchronize with you, comrade. Due to its high adaptability, our main concern was that it would try to anchor itself with a - *you* \- that does not exist in the real world.”

“Er… can you elaborate on that?” The Commander asked, sharing a confused sentiment among most people present.

“Yes, of course, it is highly convoluted, honestly. The Praetor cube will not really *synchronize* with the user. In order to respond to his movements and commands, it will link itself to the very concept of being part of the person it will be making use of. A solution evidently brought by someone who specializes in the field of bringing forth concepts into existence, really.”

“The problem lies in anchoring the praetor cube to the concept of the person.” She said sighing, putting her fingers on her temple as if suddenly hit by a bothersome subject

“It needs to link itself to the concept of who the Commander is. Here lies the problem, if we establish a wrong concept it will fail to respond, since it will be linked to the concept of a different person who is the Commander yet it is -not- the Commander.”

She said while gesturing towards the Commander, stopping in the middle of her explanation only to take another sip at the coffee, scrunching her nose as she looked at it, placing the mug back on the table.

“I assume you were intrigued by the second list of people we sent.” Chkalov said as she pointed at the paper sheet that had made its way back to Helena’s hands.

“We didn’t come to that list out of spite, nor to spurn anyone.” Chkalov shook her head, obviously somewhat troubled by that idea.

“This is an additional problem we foresaw. If the praetor cube gets the wrong information regarding the Commander, and who he is, the whole anchoring process would surely fail. Since it will be trying to make a connection with someone like the Commander yet different to him. 

“The people we asked to be present today are those closest to Comrade Commander. His friends,” She said as she gestured at Lieutenant Yannis and King George.

“His confidants, his family, his spouses.” Chkalov now gestured towards Bismarck, Helena, Belfast and Enterprise in the same order as she explained things.

“We need all of you present to establish the concept of who the commander is, the actual commander, the one that loves and fights for his friends and family, the one that is a human that makes mistakes, that overworks himself when he is anxious, the one that we can confide with, the one we trust, and cherish.”

Chkalov said the last part, blushing slightly and looking a bit to the side, as if trying to avoid the looks of everyone as she explained herself.

“While the perception of those in the second list is quite positive, it is not exactly who the commander truly is.”

“I see…” Belfast broke the silence that had befallen them “If Akagi was to be present, the Praetor cube would try to look for a Commander that’s greater than life, one that would set all his enemies ablaze and then conquer the world.”

More than one person grimaced at that. It was a spot-on analysis of how Akagi perceived the commander, and what she wanted of him as well. But everyone present was aware that Erick Anderson was much more than a successful commander.

“Er, one question.” The Commander said towards Chkalov, for her part Chkalov nodded in response waiting for him to continue.

“You seemed to have reached an epiphany when I mentioned the bear being a rigging. What was that about? Wasn’t that part of all of this?”

“Mm… Yes, more or less. We found an issue we could not just quite overcome.” She said as she twirled her hand as if trying to dispel that particular issue.

“Doctor Bethencourt made no attempts setting up a way for you to have a -conversation- with the cube, to come to an agreement with the Praetor cube. As such, there are no traces of established commands, such as ways to command the usage of weapons, but the foremost example that comes to mind is the total lack of a way to remove the Praetor cube armor from the user.”

“It seemed like an inconceivable mistake, but the more we thought about it we came to a different resolution. From what we figure, the Doctor’s affinity with wisdom cubes is so high that they simply become subservient to him, he can have any of his wishes be granted by the wisdom cubes, there is no room for dialogue.”

“I mean, I don’t see an issue with that.” Lieutenant Yannis said, while everyone else seemed to be chewing the argument. “Aside from the whole -removing the cube-? Would it become a permanent part of the Commander?”

“Theoretically, that would not be a problem. One would normally wish for their weapons to simply do what one wishes for them to do, or carry a coveted weapon with them all the time. But that is also something that does not align with the values and personality of the Commander, especially if said -weapons- happen to have a will and personality of their own. Also, while the Commander’s affinity with wisdom cubes is particularly high, we are not convinced it is on the same level as that of Doctor Bethencourt, as such it is quite possible he would not be able to have his orders be accomplished properly.”

“That is why the Commander’s misunderstanding came like a revelation. If we modify the Praetor cube’s base functions ever slightly, it can work much like a rigging, being part of the Commander while at the same time being independent of him. Being able to accomplish tasks on his own with only a request by the Commander.”

“Uh…” The Commander said intelligently, echoing everyone’s thoughts on the matter.",1,1734835701.0,Azurlanefanfics,0,1.0,False
1hjpkaz,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1hjpkaz/the_radio_said_my_name_this_morning/,The Radio Said My Name This Morning,"I wake up early, every day, to my routine. Coffee brews, and the radio plays softly. The station—96.7 FM—is familiar and predictable. The DJs laugh, and the music flows. But one thing always stands out.

Every morning, they pause. Then, they say a name.

“David Miles,” they might say. It’s quick, out of place. They don’t explain. Afterward, the show continues, normal as ever.

I never thought much about it. Maybe it was a joke or a community announcement. The names meant nothing to me—until this morning.

As I poured coffee, I waited. The pause came. Then, I heard it:

“Rebecca Gray.”

My hand went cold. I managed to catch the cup as it tilted slightly. My entire name echoed around the kitchen. As if the air itself had stopped, the moment dragged on heavily.

The station went on. Then came typical, happy weather updates. However, I was unable to let it go. I felt like I was being watched, and my chest clenched. Why my name? Why now?

The sensation persisted. My mind was all over the place at work. I kept hearing the voice on the radio. The hours passed slowly, and at last, I went home. My sanctuary, the apartment, seemed different. Long stretches of shadow were accompanied by a dense, deafening quiet.

By 10 PM, I gave in. Something pushed me—urged me—to turn on the radio again. I hesitated, but my fingers moved. Static buzzed, then music returned, slower than usual. The rhythm unsettled me. My breathing quickened.

A pause interrupted the song. I braced myself.

“Rebecca Gray,” the voice said again.

This time, it was sharper. The sound felt closer, like it wasn’t just in the radio. I froze, waiting, listening. The air turned colder. My pulse pounded in my ears.

Then, the knocking started.

It was soft, tapping on the window. My head snapped toward the sound. Nothing was there. I held my breath. The tapping came again, louder this time.

With my pulse pounding, I edged closer. Outside, the grass was covered in the shadows cast by the swaying trees. There was no one, yet the wind whispered. Still, the knocking persisted, steady and insistent.

I stepped back. My legs felt weak. The room darkened, though the lights remained on. The radio crackled, and I turned toward it instinctively.

“Rebecca Gray,” the voice hissed. This time, it didn’t feel human.

The wind howled louder, and the knocking turned to banging, violent and desperate. My chest tightened, and I backed away. The radio buzzed, the music distorting. Shadows seemed to shift, reaching toward me.

“Rebecca,” the voice said, softer now, almost gentle. “You’ve been called.”

The banging stopped. The silence was worse. My name echoed in my mind. I couldn't tell if the wind outside was real or if I was losing control as it shrieked. I fell to the ground when my legs gave out.

They had called me. And I wasn’t [ready](https://unseenofficial.blogspot.com/2024/12/blog-post_21.html).",8,1734835679.0,shortscarystories,0,0.91,False

Let's have a little chat. Yes about THE question that comes up time, and time again. ""how do I use the bathroom when concealed carrying?""

There's many jokes to be had and I look forward to reading them but also, it is a legit question because there are serious consequences if you mess it up.

There are many techniques and methods to how people navigate using the bathroom stall when they conceal carry. Some are good - those being any that ensure the gun stays attached to your person. Some are terrible, e.g., putting the gun on the toilet paper roll, on the toilet seat behind you, on the ground - anything that removes the gun for your person is bad news. Literally news - people end up in the news because they forget their loaded gun in public restrooms and there can be some serious charges attached to that all depending on how the district attorney and general public feels about it when it becomes news.

I am a believer that if you have a technique that works well for you and it doesn't remove the gun from your person, great, keep at it. I personally never found a technique that I enjoyed using and I was always frustrated with using the public bathroom when I carried. As someone who worked at an office where I carried everyday, I would be making a bathroom stall trip at least once a day (thanks coffee).

As well, I hate to admit but will for honesty sake that I unfortunately made the grave error in the past of forgetting my gun in a bathroom. My stomach dropped, my heart pounded, I felt like an absolute idiot. I ran back and quickly recovered it. Thankfully no one found it.

That's when I fully realized how massive of a risk this was and how important of a subject it was to discuss. I also realized that I could NEVER let the gun leave my person again, but I also could not find a technique that worked well for me.

That's why I created [stallster.com](https://stallster.com)

Stallster is a convenient, complementary product for your CC that is meant to store your *holstered* firearm on your person while you use a bathroom stall. It allows you to have 2 hands free to navigate the bathroom easily and gives you peace of mind that you'll never forget your firearm because it's always attached to your person.

Stallster easily becomes a regular part of your CC loadout and can fit on your belt, right next to your CC. Since it's made of fabric you'll hardly notice the feeling of wearing it and probably stop noticing it entirely after a few minutes. I spent a long time prototyping it to fit as many holster/firearm combos as possible and hopefully I've manage to design it to fit most. You can check out fitment video examples here: [stallster.com/pages/gun-holster-fit-in-stallster](http://stallster.com/pages/gun-holster-fit-in-stallster)

I'm happy to carry on a full discussion on navigating the bathroom with a CC and want to hear how you all go about doing it. I do genuinely think it is a serious topic to discuss and I don't want anyone to make the grave mistake of forgetting their firearm in the bathroom like I did.

Don't end up as a news article.  
Here's a database I'm creating of news articles of people who forgot their CC in public bathrooms: [https://stallster.com/pages/news-article-database](https://stallster.com/pages/news-article-database)

P.S. I quit my fulltime cybersecurity job to build Stallster 5 months ago. It's really a small operation with humble beginnings. I'm currently just sewing Stallsters out of my apartment and working to find a USA sewing manufacturer to work with so it can scale.

Kevin fished around in Castle’s pockets and retrieved the keys to his truck. Castle’s incoherent moaning picked-up a little while Kevin was searching him.

*I could end up like that*, I thought\*. All it takes is for some other player to gently tap me. Is that what death is like here? Is it worse than oblivion because I’ll stay in that semi-conscious state forever?\*

I followed Kevin into the parking lot. He handed me the Castle’s keys. “Okay, here’s the plan –“

“Woah – you want me to drive this thing? I can’t do that.”

He pointed to his crown, “King.” He rapped on my helmet like he was knocking on a door. “Pawn.”

I sighed and yanked the keys from his hand. “I don’t even know how to drive a -“

“The plan,” he interrupted. “Listen. There are two key elements to the plan. One – you drive this thing north, to Rankate Park. Two – and this is the key part of the plan - make bad decisions. You have to do what you do best which is to make terrible decisions.”

“That’s not even a plan! That’s just … “ I struggled to find the words. “That’s just you insulting me in a parking lot.”

“North!” he said. “Rankate Park! Bad decisions.” Then he spun around and marched back into the E6.

I climbed into the cab of the truck. I’d never been in the cab of an eighteen-wheeler before. The steering wheel was huge, and was mounted on the dash at a weird flat angle. The shifter looked like some kind of puzzle with three reverse gears and a ten or so forward gears. The dash had five times the number of gauges than a regular car.

Castle had positioned the driver’s seat so far back that my feet didn’t event brush the pedals. I fumbled around for a few seconds before I figured out how to slide it forward. A chess piece – a rook - was stuck to the dashboard with a suction cup. I pulled it off and tossed it on the passenger seat. This was my truck now. A pawn’s truck.

I found the ignition and turned it on.

The truck rumbled to life. The deep growl under the hood had a heaviness to it, like I was about to drive one of the Earth’s tectonic plates instead of a vehicle. I said what I’m guessing everyone says the first time they sit in the driver’s seat of a big rig.

“Oh *Yeah*…”

I smirked the smirk of someone about take control of something that could generate far more power than they could control, and put the truck into first gear.

The truck stalled as soon as I eased my foot off the clutch. I messed with the shifter and tried again. Stall. I moved the shifter through its little labyrinth of gear positions to make sure I had it in the first gear. Stall. I honked the horn, just to make me feel like I was in control of something, then I messed with the lever on the shifter. This time the truck slowly crawled forward when I hit the gas.

I steered towards the ramp from the E6 parking lot to the northbound side of the highway. I shifted twice more before I reached the road, but was still only moving about fifteen miles an hour despite being in third gear.

I managed to get the truck up to a normal highway speed with only a few severe gear grinding incidents. I imagined Castle, still writhing and moaning on the floor of the E6 travel store emitting tearful whimpers of pain each time I ground the gears on his truck.

I found the control for the windshield wipers. I figured out how to turn on the headlights. In my button-pushing and switch-flipping I accidentally turned on the sound system. Evil-sounding German industrial metal music blasted into the cab. The relentlessly driving industrial metal filled me with confidence and I shifted through three more gears, getting the truck up to seventy or so. Was this what Castle was listening to when he decided to ram Kevin and I? Soon I was singing along, even though I had no idea what the German words meant.

*""Got vise ish vil kine Engel zine.""*

I passed a sign:

*Rankate park: 2 miles*.

I had almost completed the first phase of Kevin’s “plan.” I started to ponder the second part, where I was supposed to make bad decisions. Is it even possible to wisely make a bad choice? Is planning to have a bad plan a paradox?

The trees surrounding the highway thinned, then were suddenly gone entirely as the highway crossed a stretch of farmland. The rain stopped abruptly. The clouds thinned and the light of the full moon washed away the night's impenetrable gloom. Was this new landscape and new weather a sign that I had I crossed into a new cell on the grid?

Beyond the fields, it seemed the world ended. The road traced a path between the fields into an immense dark void beyond. I let off the gas a bit as I tried to understand what was beyond the fields. Was the void *the black edge of the board* that Kevin told me about at the party?

I drove past another sign:

*Rankate Park: 1 mile.*

*No Beach Access*

I laughed at myself for a moment. The endless darkness beyond the fields was just the ocean. I stepped on the gas again to get back up to highway speeds.

There was movement to my left. Someone passing me? I checked the driver-side mirror and saw nothing but empty highway behind me. I looked out into the field to my left. Something was out there. It was a monster. No, correction, *she* was a monster.

I didn’t think “oh, a monster,” right away, of course. The human brain doesn’t work that way when it encounters something new. The visual system needs a second to grasp what it sees. It hands over its results to the cortex, which has to think things through a bit. Once the cortex ponders it for bit, and understands just how “wrong” what its seeing is, the limbic system takes over. The limbic system needs another half-second-or-so to figure out that “fear” is the right response. Well, in my case, terror was what it dialed up.

At first I thought the large object in the field to the left of the road was a dilapidated structure – maybe a half-demolished grain silo or water tank. But no. It was moving. Not just traveling forward, parallel to the road, but running at the same speed as the truck.

It was maybe twenty feet tall – too large to be any kind of normal animal. As I more fully processed what I was seeing, I saw that it *wasn’t* running, exactly. It was galloping. No not even galloping– galloping is something that creatures with four legs do. This thing had more than four legs. Six? Probably more. It was hard to tell because it was wearing a *dress*.

It – she – whatever - was human-like, in that she was wearing clothes, had legs, a torso, arms, and a head all arranged in the normal vertical way that we humans are organized. Her human-like arms were attached at the shoulders, but there were way too many of them. She had eight arms.

Her head was a grotesque oversized mass. A human head scaled up to hold eight separate faces, each looking out from the eight main compass points. The resemblance to the eight-faced horror version of myself I saw in the reflection of the window and the rear-view mirror was obvious. One difference between her eight-faced abomination of a head and what I saw of my own in the mirror is that she wore an enormous crown of steel spikes. This thing, this *person*, had to be the queen. The black queen.

I startled as the truck drifted over the rumble strip on the right side of the road and onto the shoulder, I overcorrected, sending the truck into the center of the road. The queen also heard the truck hit the rumble strip. She turned her head slightly and sneered at me with two of her faces. Her faces – the two that looked at me anyway - reminded me of the Statue of Liberty. They had a similar dingy tarnish, like she was wearing greenish-grey makeup. Both faces bore the same resting-bitch-face scowl as Ms. Liberty.

The queen turned slightly to her right, smashed through the left-side guard rail, and ran onto the highway. I slammed on the brakes and slid to a stop in the center of the road. The queen continued her strange, arhythmic, loping run, rapidly moving away from me down the center of the road.

The face on the 180-degree rear of the queen’s head looked directly at me and shouted something I could not hear from inside Castle’s cab. She slowed to a jog, and then a complete stop. Behind her, the road opened into a parking lot. A park-sign-brown sign on the side of the road announced that the road ended at Rankate Park.

We stayed there, staring at each other. Me, sitting in the cab, listening to Castle’s insane German Industrial Metal. A hundred yards ahead, at the entrance to the Rankate parking lot, the 20-foot-tall, many-limbed, eight-faced queen stared back at me. Behind her, the paved parking lot ended at what looked like an observation area overlooking the ocean, a hundred feet or so below us.

*…Make bad decisions…*

Kevin’s voice floated through my consciousness. A demented, acid-trip version of Obi-Wan telling Luke to use The Force.

I could try ramming her, I thought. The truck is really powerful, so that might be a good idea. No, I mentally corrected myself, I need bad ideas, not good ones.

We stared at each other for three or four songs. From time to time she would turn her head slightly so that another face would have a chance to glare at me. But other than the dirty looks, she did nothing. It must be my move.

I looked around the cab of Castle’s truck. Was there anything here that could help me? Some clue as to how this weird world behaved? I didn’t see anything other than what I assumed was the usual trucker stuff: maps, coffee cups, a clipboard with some kind of cargo manifest. What kind of cargo was Castle hauling, anyway? Is there, like, an economy here? Was he making a delivery? I grabbed the clipboard and tried to make sense of it. It was just a list of coded and abbreviated items: PT, CF, 1 gross, pallet.

I unbuckled my seatbelt and cracked the driver’s door open. The queen didn’t move. I opened the door and swung myself out onto the footplate. Nothing from the queen. I jumped down to the pavement, still focused on the queen. She turned her head to glare at me with a new face, but was otherwise motionless.

I walked to the back of the truck, and scrambled up the metal bars that functioned as the trailer’s rear bumper. I fumbled with the door handle for a bit, but finally got the door to swing open. I scrambled inside. I had to open the second door to let enough light in to see the cargo clearly. Castle was hauling about ten pallets of Cosmic Fudge flavored Pop Tarts.

I strolled the length of the trailer interior to make sure I wasn’t missing anything. I wasn’t. Just ten pallets of Pop Tarts – all Cosmic Fudge flavored – and pallet jack lashed to the wall.

*Bad decisions*. I needed bad ideas to make bad decisions. I thought. Nothing came to mind. I stopped thinking and just acted. I unlashed the pallet jack from the trailer wall and rolled it to doorway. I slid the tines under the pallet next to the door and pushed it to the edge of the trailer. It didn’t weight much – a gross of crates of Pop Tarts is only a hundred-fifty pounds or so. I maneuvered the pallet so it was hanging off the edge of the trailer, slid the jack out, and then pushed hard on the load of plastic-wrapped Pop-Tart boxes. The pallet of Pop Tarts rolled out of the truck and spilled onto the road.

I worked the pallet jack under the next pallet and did the same thing. I thought I heard a gasp, or maybe a shout from the queen. I worked quickly, pushing the rest of the pallets out of the truck. I expected to see the queen’s huge, eight-faced head appear in the doorway at any moment, ready to take me out. But she didn’t show up. It was still my move.

I hopped down from the trailer and walked back to the cab. The Queen was still in her position by the Rankate Park sign. Still glaring at me.

“What do you think you are doing!” she shouted from the face that was most-directly looking at me. “I’ll have your head for this!” Her voice was not what I expected. I thought she would sound “Queen like” – she’d have a snobby upper-class British accent. But she was American. From Boston, maybe?

I climbed into the cab and put the truck into gear. This time, I knew what I was doing and I didn’t have any embarrassing stall outs. I rolled the truck forward about fifty feet.

The queen began shouting again. I couldn’t hear what she said. I figured out how to turn off the Castle’s heavy metal music and I opened the driver’s window. “What?” I shouted back?

“You pathetic pawn. Just because you stole a truck, it doesn’t mean you’re a rook. I’ll bite your head off!”

I leaned out the window to make sure she’d hear me. “You mean, you’d actually chew on my head? That’s pretty gross!”

“It’s a figure of speech, pawny pants!” There was that stupid insult again. “But this one,” she used three of her arms to point at the face on the left side of her head, “she’s a little bit off, you know. She might actually do it!”

I put the truck into reverse and rolled it backwards towards the pile of Pop Tarts.

“My Tarts!” the Queen screamed. “My Tarts! Stop! You’ll ruin them!”

I smiled and kept rolling slightly backwards. *Your move*, I thought. I had a bad feeling about my plan. But it was a familiar bad feeling. The same feeling I had just before I attended my cousin’s super-formal wedding barefoot. Or when I tried to arm-wrestle the bouncer at O’Flanagan’s. Or when I did a million other stupid things. I was doing what came naturally – making bad decisions.

The Queen launched herself into a sprint directly at the truck. If you’ve got six or eight legs, you can really get some good acceleration. She screamed at me, literally and figuratively, as she rushed the truck.

For a moment, I thought she was going to take me out. And that she was going to do it in a much more violent and bloody way than I did when I took out Castle. I’d have to face oblivion, lying on the road next to the park. But she didn’t take me out. She raced past the cab – the face on the right side of her head spit at me as she passed – and stopped at rear of the trailer.

“My Tarts!” she screamed again.

The truck stopped rolling backwards. I looked in the driver-side mirror and saw the Queen leaning into the trailer, pushing it forwards, away from the tarts, with all the force she had in her collection of sixteen limbs.

I put the truck in a forward gear and stomped on the gas. I rolled forward slowly at first, then faster and faster. In the mirror, the Queen fell behind as the truck moved away from the pile of her precious Pop Tarts.

I shifted gears, then shifted again. I blasted past the Rankate Park sign with the engine screaming. I accelerated through the parking lot, towards the observation point. A sign that said “Viewing area. Caution, steep drop off” was planted directly in front of me.

*Make Bad Decisions*

I flattened the sign and kept the truck rolling forward. Through the safety railing and into the void beyond.

For a moment, the cab stayed level as it flew off the cliff. Then it pitched downwards as the forces of gravity and the cantilever of the trailer the trailer rolled me towards the ocean below. I saw the dark water churning at the base of a rocky cliff. *The Black Edge of the Board*, I thought.

Then I was standing on the ground. I was in park’s viewing area looking out over the ocean as the truck crashed onto the rocks below and rolled into the surf.

I felt dizzy. I took a step back from edge. Eight legs moved me in a coordinated but inhuman motion to where I wanted to be. “Wha….” I began to speak, and heard eight different versions of my voice.

I remembered my conversation with Kevin at the party. Only hours ago:

*“Chess, right?” Kevin had said. “You know what happens when a pawn makes it to the other side?”*

*“Yeah, it turns into a queen. The most badass piece on the board.”*

Pawn Promotion. I had been promoted. I was a …

No yo-yo effect whatsoever. However, during an overseas trip, I began eating below 500 calories on fasting days (For example, a fruit smoothie with ice and fruit, black coffee, a pack of glass noodles, or a small dish if socialise.) and haven’t lost any weight since?

Should I focus more on mindful eating during eating days, or should I completely avoid eating on fasting days to reach the fasting stage? It's been 2 weeks and just got a scale to check my weight. Genuinely confused.

I’m a 30-year-old transwoman living in the vibrant Phoenix area, and I’m hoping to meet some new friends who enjoy good company, laughter, and meaningful connections. I’m kind-hearted, open-minded, and love meeting people who can make me smile and keep me intrigued. If you’re someone who appreciates warmth, charm, and enjoys getting to know someone in a real way, I’d love to hear from you!

A little about me: I have a wide range of interests, from exploring the desert landscapes to cozying up with a good book or checking out local art and events. I’m also passionate about cooking (though I’m more into experimenting than perfecting), and love the idea of sharing a meal with someone who appreciates the simple pleasures in life. I’m always up for new adventures, and there’s nothing better than a good conversation over coffee or cocktails.

I value connections that are built on mutual respect, kindness, and trust – with a touch of playfulness. My life as a transwoman has taught me a lot about embracing who I am and savoring every moment. But I’m not just about deep talks and life lessons – I’m also someone who enjoys some flirtation, light teasing, and the thrill of getting to know someone new in a relaxed, fun way.

If you’re looking for someone who is sweet, down-to-earth, and a little bit intriguing, I’d love to hear from you. Whether we’re sharing stories or enjoying a quiet evening together, I promise I’ll keep things interesting. Don’t be shy – let’s make some memories and see where the connection takes us!",1,1734834178.0,R4R30Plus,0,1.0,False

*Steel-toed boots man:* If you have grey in stock, I’d prefer a grey one. But ultimately it’s about power, not color. 


*Red Tie Salesman:* We usually have silver ready to go, yeah. 


*Steel-toed boots man:* Is that the same as grey? 


*Red Tie Salesman:* On this model, yes. Not all of them though, so it’s good to check. 



**Pharmacy:** 


*Aspirin Man:* I’d also like to pick up my wife’s prescriptions. And check out this aspirin. 


*Hair Bow Pharmacist:* No problem, just give me a minute to finish up on yours then I’ll grab your wife’s information. 



**Thrift Store:** 


*Candelabra:* I really love this but it’s a little small. 


*MAD Magazine:* Forget it then. 


*Candelabra:* But I really love it. Maybe I can have a tailor let it out. 


*MAD Magazine:* It’ll cost less to buy it new in a right size than to have a tailor work on it. 



*Candelabra:* You’re probably right. 


*MAD Magazine:* If you like it that much, get it, why not. 


*Candelabra:* No, no, you’re right. I really just love the idea of it. 


*MAD Magazine:* You can buy it even if you just love the idea of it.

Current medications - Nexium and Zegrid

About a year ago my gastroenterologist prescribed that I take a PPI (Nexium) every other day to prevent heartburn. Prior to that, I had self medicated for about 10 years with PPIs but in a reactive manner rather than proactively every other day. Since then, my regular heartburn has abated, however I now have a regular scratch in my throat I can't scratch and am constantly clearing my throat. My ENT used a laparoscopic scope on my nose and throat and suggested I now have silent heartburn, or laryngopharyngeal reflux.

In addition to the scratchy throat, the right side of my throat is swollen and my larynx has shifted out of alignment to the left. I'm concerned but my gastro just wants me to start taking pantoprazole to treat my heartburn. I guess I'm not convinced. I haven't had any issues in the past and since going on her regime are when my very noticeable problems started. Any gastros here with a different opinion, or is pantoprazole really my best bet?
