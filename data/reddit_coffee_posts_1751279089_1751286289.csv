1lo65ce,https://www.reddit.com/r/norwalk/comments/1lo65ce/life_in_norwalk/,Life in Norwalk,"Hello! My husband and I are considering a move from Brooklyn to Norwalk with our 5yo and 2.5yo. We have been exploring alllll of the areas around NYC to hopefully find the perfect spot. Our dream: A 4-bedroom house where we can walk to a few restaurants/coffee shops, my husband has a commute of about 1 hour to Grand Central (he has to go in 2-3 days/week), schools are reasonably good, people are not snooty, and we spend around $1.5-1.75m. 

Norwalk, specifically South Norwalk, seems like it could be a great fit. Checks all our boxes, and the coastal access, aquarium, and children’s museum are big pluses. 

Please tell me what I might be missing (or tell me that I’m spot-on and should move to Norwalk!). 

FWIW, I know the school ratings aren’t the absolute best relative to some surrounding towns, but they seem good enough at least for elementary school. Not hugely concerned about high school because that’s such a long way off for us. We are also open to Catholic schools if public school doesn’t work out. 

And for context, we also like Rye, Bronxville, Greenwich, and Larchmont, but they seem too expensive and potentially too snooty for us.

Eventually want to have a massive coffee, tobacco export economy but need to get my construction industry up and maxed first 

To make the money for construction should I focus on what the Spanish market is lacking?

Right now it appears to be mostly lacking wood, iron and tools in that order so it lines up with what I want to do anyway. 

But generally is building bigger markets shortages a good way to fund your construction till you break free?

My thought in 1.9 is if you end up having a massive surplus of something after leaving it can just get auto exported

1lo5zp3,https://www.reddit.com/r/BokunoheroFanfiction/comments/1lo5zp3/crack_himiko_toga_everywhere/,Crack: Himiko Toga everywhere,"[https://archiveofourown.org/works/67036174](https://archiveofourown.org/works/67036174)

[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/14485862/1/Himiko-Toga-everywhere](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/14485862/1/Himiko-Toga-everywhere)

Himiko Toga wanted two thing in life: cute boys and bloody fights. The red liquid tasted the best when it was boiling from adrenaline. Her parents were rich snobs who despised the sight of blood and the fighting of any kind. They wouldn’t even let her apply for tae kwon do lessons. At some point, the girl decided this life is not worth living and ran away from her. Whatever, her younger sister could do all the rich people things their mom and dad want so much.

Himiko has been living her best life as street fighter. She would battle people and drink their blood afterwards. Of course, sometimes the opposition was a little too strong, so she had to run away. One day, little vampire found this cute boy Midoriya, and she wanted to suck him dry, but he is too weak to fight properly. Sloppy movements, no sense of balance, noddle arms. He fell down like a puppet without strings after she did 4-5 measly punches on him. The boy was now lying in the puddle of his blood and tears.

No problem, Himiko could train him, whether he liked it or not. She pulled out a first aid kit from her backpack and helped treat his wounds. After that, they sat down and ate sandwiched at a bench.

""Why? Why did you hurt me?"" Midoriya asked. ""Is this because I’m weak?""

""No, silly."" Toga giggled. ""It’s because you are cute. But yeah, you are weak as hell. We’ll have to change that.""

""Kacchan will be mad if I start training.""

""I don’t know who Kacchan is, but I will be mad if you don’t. And trust, you DO NOT want to see me mad."" Himiko pulled out a knife and inspected it.

Izuku gulped as he awaited her next words.

""I think the best way to train someone is practical experience. I’m going to periodically attack you, and you will do your best to fight back. I’ll go easy first, but every subsequent encounter will be harder and harder. This way, we will have the best kind of fight in the end!""

""N-no."" He weakly replied. ""I don’t want to fight you.""

""HA HA HA!"" Himiko laughed as he grabbed his face with one hand and put the knife near his throat with another. ""You don’t want to fight me? Then you better get to the gym and beat me a bloody pulp! Because I’m not leaving you alone until..."" She sniffed the air. ""Damn it, did you pee yourself?""

Toga had to give him her spare underwear and jeans to not embarrass him further. Izuku didn’t know what was more humiliating: being beaten by a girl or wearing pink panties. In any case, she told him he needs to train. His first thought was going to police, but none of them took him seriously. Was it because female on male violence isn’t treated with respect?

—

Izuku’s life had been turned upside down ever since he met that crazy girl. Midoriya had no choice but to ask his mom for a dojo membership. A nice girl with red ponytail taught him karate. He also had to lift, do cardio and other types of exercises to stay in top shape. Every few days she could appear from anywhere: raise her head from a trash can or a man hole, jump at him from the second floor, get involved in a fight with Kacchan, come out of an elevator when he was walking past it, hand him over new toilet paper in a public restroom etc. Sometimes she was fighting with bare hands, but other times she used baseball bats or knives. Luckily, Kacchan would always help him beat her whenever he nearby, as he found her a ’creepy freak’. Same with Kendou girl, although she felt very sympathetic to Izuku’s peril. Toga would always run away after confirming Izuku was making progress.

Even when Himiko was caught by police (heroes were useless cause she wasn’t using her quirk), she returned after a week tops. When asked how, she joked about cleaning up their guns. The girl is totally jobbing for the first month, but ever so slightly less afterwards, which forces Midoriya to train and learn martial arts, and add techniques that deal with knife wielders.

—

At some point, Toga started to incorporate her quirk to catch Izuku-chan even he least expected it. The first time was a female classmate he was crushing on. She asked him to meet her in the empty classroom, asked him to close his eyes and move lips forward. Instead of a kiss, she immediately punched him in the gut and dropped her disguise. He had to fight with emotional damage and embarrassment as she was completely naked!

It kept going! So far she’s been a waiter at a restaurant, taxi driver, his favorite idol (he should have known a private concert would be a scam), his friend Kacchan (Izuku couldn’t see the difference as she was disguised the entire time), karate instructor Itsuka Kendou, his mother Inko and many more. He managed to figure out that she needs blood to use her quirk, which partially explained her fascination.

All the fights made him beefier and more confident. He could finally confront Kacchan whenever he tried bullying him or other kids. This made other Aldera students respect him a lot more, although he wished the rumors about him ’dating’ that crazy chick weren’t so widespread.

—

During Izuku’s birthday, Himiko came to his home with a rare All Might statue. She said she understands that the boy needs a bit of downtime and reassurance every once in a while, so they could make a truce for weekends or holidays. Considering Midoriya wasn’t very good in friends department, this was perhaps as good as it could get. Toga even stayed when Kendou of all people arrived with a coffee machine.

Izuku was unsure how to feel. On one hand, Himiko made him a total paranoic and she tried to kill him, but on the other hand, she was perhaps his best friend all along. The little vampire motivated him to work out and never lose his fighting spirit. She even procured the thing he wanted his birthday party, played bowling on Sundays and took care of him when he was sick. The green head even begged her to become a hero like him, but she didn’t like the idea. Heroes couldn’t fight whenever they wanted.

—

After a certain Sludge incident, Izuku caught attention of All Might and became his successor. The first few months of getting used to the power were pretty rough. Thankfully, Himiko saw that he was injured and didn’t prey on him. After a bit more focused training, the green head could safely use 20 percent of One For All. Himiko disappeared for months, which made him worried. Noone, not even the police could tell where she was. He could only hope she was okay.

—

Months has passed, Izuku got into UA and his class was going to USJ. The villains attacked! The leader seemed to be... Himiko? She ordered a weird mist man to scatter the students and distract the teachers. Izuku was hers to battle.

Midoriya ran to her as fast as he could, hoping to talk her out of this.

""Himiko, what’s the meaning of this?"" He asked. ""Who are these people?""

""You’re not going to ask how I’ve been doing?"" She sounded disappointed. ""FYI, I’ve joined the organization called League of Villains. Me and Handjob had some disagreements, so I killed him. Then I convinced his sensei to let me be his successor instead. These people are my little helpers?""

""What? Why?"" Izuku was still confused.

""I’ve always been good at hiding in plan sight. I knew that you somehow inherited All Might’s power. You hanged out with him and did a smash comparable to his. It was pretty obvious that I needed a power-up to keep our rivalry in tact. I told sensei that I know how to approach future All Might. Sensei let me be his successor because I know you, and because I want you to bleed for me.""

""Toga, please, don’t do this. I’ll do anything, but you need to stop.""

""Anything?"" She had a wicked grin. ""Than fight me with all your heart!""

The girl rushed at Midoriya. He thought Toga would be outclassed now, but no. She had new quirks! Some kind of regeneration and shock absorption. It took Izuku going plus ultra and breaking his arms to overcome her and send her flying. While she was in the air, Himiko savored the taste of desperate Izu-kun blood.

All Might and Izuku were both shocked by that day’s revelation. Himiko, on the other hand, was more making further plans.

—

Fast forward to Hosu. Toga tried recruiting Mr Stainy, but he told her that mindless blood lust is despicable. They parted ways after she prevented all of his attacks and told him to leave while he was still breathing.

—

Izuku was running through narrow alleyways in hopes of finding Iida. He had to engage in a fight with Stain to save his friend. Everyone got surprised when Himiko walded in, caught one of the knives with her teeth, then grabbed it by the handle and assumed a fighting stance. Stain targeted her first as filthy adrenaline junkie, even paralyzing her in the process, but then Shouto’s backup made him lose to the heroes. Stain and Toga have been apprehended by police, but the girl spit out a weird gray goo and teleported them out. She really liked Mr Stainy’s fighting style, so he was going to appropriate it for herself.

—

Months later, Himiko disguised herself as one of Wolfram’s henchmen. Izuku couldn’t even tell that is was her! Just kicked her to the side as he and another girl hurried to lift the security lockdown. He was progressing so fast.

—

It was supposed to be a nice training session in Wild Wild Pussycats’ forest. Instead, he was running to save the kid who punched him in the balls. When the boy finally got to the Mountain, he saw Mandalay and her nephew running towards him. Except...

Shino Sousaki was just another disguise. Underneath it was Himiko is Mandalay cosplay. She told the boy to the hide so she could have another fight. Despite his pleads to let him get the child to safety, she was adamant about fighting. The first time she landed a bite, Izuku got paralyzed. He was hit by a familiar quirk. Toga stood over his motionless body, a sadistic grin on her face and the tail on her costume playfully moving around.

Kouta Izumi sprayed her with water from behind out of desperation. She turned around and moved towards the little guy.

""No! Don’t hurt him."" Izuku begged.

""You are in over your head, kid."" Himiko said to shaking Kouta. ""A different villain might have killed you for it. The blood curl quirk is so boring! Izu-kun, I’m going to wait until it wears off and then we fight for real. And you better not pretend to be paralyzed for long!""

Midoriya could move, so Toga unleashed Muscular quirk to look less like Mandalay and more like Tiger. This was a tough barrier to overcome, so the boy had to use 1 million percent OFA, shattering his arms and her skull yet again. He moved Kouta back to safety as Himiko had to crawl to extraction point.

—

LOV kidnapped Katsuki to covert him, at least on paper. In reality, Himiko wanted bait Izuku into coming to her lair. Her plans were a bit ruined when AFO and heroes intervened. Her sensei’s old body has been completely destroyed, and her base of operations was no more. On the plus side, she now had Explosion and Search to play with.

League had to make a temporary alliance with Overhaul. Toga decided to squeeze the yakuzas for all they are worth and have another excuse to fight her beloved. She tipped of Sir Nighteye about the whereabouts of the base and the little girl. On the day of the raid, she kidnapped Kai and made Dr Garaki give her a full copy of his quirk. Dressed as Plague Doctor, she made Izuku fight her in exchange for letting Eri go. The healing properties of Overhaul were incredibly potent, so Midoriya had to use Eri’s rewind to keep up. Eventually, he overpowered her and she had to teleport away. Kai’s quirkless but definitely alive body was found shortly afterwards.

—

Himiko and her team were ambushed in Deika City. Luckily, almost all of them were chumps who weren’t able to fight properly. That reporter lady was very insistent on blowing her up, so she had to eat knives for breakfast. It was a tough battle, but the League prevailed.

—

With AFO’s body gone, his minion Doctor Garaki used yakuza’s stolen funds and his vast medical knowledge to perform hos greatest feat. He would use genetic material left by All For One to insert his master’s mind and quirk into the little girl, as well as make the body on par with prime All Might. The idea was for All For One to take over the body, but Himiko wasn’t so simple. Her sheer willpower let her remain in control by attacking and defeating the villain’s vestige in her own mind.

Toga was the peak of humanity’s evolution! This meant she could finally have one final showdown with Izuku! She tied up Dr Garaki and told other League members that they are on their own from now on. Some of them complied, others tried to kill her (poor Dabi), and some begged her to not leave them. She ’cured’ Twice by removing the source of his paranoia, gave him and Spinner disguise quirks so they could leave Japan together. Or not, she wasn’t going to order them around. The girl practiced her quirks for a bit, then put on a nice business suit to cosplay as her late sensei.

—

Himiko appeared in front of UA with all of her power. She demanded one last fight with Izuku. In exchange, she promised to give heroes all the information about remnants of AFO’s influence. When Midoriya got close, she forcefully teleported them into a remote location. There, they could let loose and fight to their hearts’ content. The persuasions failed as usual. Given how strong and filled with quirks Himiko was, Izuku had no choice but to go for a clean hit with his full power.

Himiko had a gaping hole in her chest. Her mouth was filled with a combination of their hot blood. The taste was divine! This was what she always wanted to live for. The girl gave him a usb drive and promised that the world would follow Izuku’s wishes, as he was the best fighter ever...

—

Years later, Izuku was at the altar about to marry a girl he had met in Provisional License Exam. As soon as the bride was asked if she agreed to marriage, Himiko dropped her disguise and called her backup clones from cake, the officiant and some of the guests. Izuku kicked kicked their butts as a sign that he never got any weaker. Then he took the original girl and slipped the ring on her finger anyway. The ceremony concluded as Himiko and her naked clones were kissing Izuku all over his body.",1,1751285763.0,BokunoheroFanfiction,0,1.0,False

But this **MSI Katana 15 HX** with the new **RTX 5070** and **Intel Core i9-14900HX**? It's actually making me question everything I thought I knew about mid-range gaming laptops.

## Why This Laptop Caught My Attention (And Why It Should Catch Yours)

**Ever wondered what happens when MSI decides to stop playing it safe?** Well, the Katana 15 HX B14WGK-016US is their answer. This isn't your typical ""budget gaming laptop with compromises"" – it's more like someone took a premium machine and made it accessible without gutting the good stuff.

The **Intel Core i9-14900HX** processor is the real MVP here. We're talking about a 14th-gen HX-series chip that doesn't mess around – **24 cores, 32 threads, and boost speeds up to 5.8GHz**. For context, this thing makes my old laptop look like it's running on steam power.

But here's where it gets interesting – they paired it with **NVIDIA's brand-new GeForce RTX 5070**. Now, I know what you're thinking: ""Another RTX launch, another disappointment."" But hold up, this one's different.

## The RTX 5070: More Than Just Marketing Hype

**The RTX 5070 in this Katana isn't your typical laptop GPU compromise.** After spending weeks with it, I can honestly say it's the sweet spot NVIDIA has been trying to hit for years. **Ray tracing performance that doesn't tank your framerate?** Check. **DLSS 4 that actually makes a difference?** Double check.

Here's what blew my mind – running **Cyberpunk 2077 at QHD+ with ray tracing enabled**, I was consistently hitting **60-75 FPS** with DLSS Quality mode. That's territory that used to require desktop RTX 4080s, and here we are on a laptop that costs significantly less.

[Check out the current deal on Amazon](https://amzn.to/3TPgUmg)

## That QHD+ 165Hz Display: Finally, A Screen Worth Gaming On

**Can we talk about this display for a hot second?** The **15.6"" QHD+ panel running at 165Hz** is what every gaming laptop should have shipped with from day one. The pixel density jump from standard 1080p is immediately noticeable – text is crisp, games look detailed without being demanding on your eyes.

But here's the kicker – **MSI actually tuned this panel properly**. Color accuracy is on point, brightness levels work in various lighting conditions, and the 165Hz refresh rate isn't just a marketing number. In competitive shooters like **Valorant or CS2**, the difference between this and a standard 60Hz panel is night and day.

**Pro tip:** If you're coming from a 60Hz display, prepare to never want to go back. It's one of those ""you can't unsee it"" upgrades.

## Performance That Actually Backs Up The Specs

Let's get real about performance numbers because specs on paper don't mean much if the laptop can't deliver:

**Gaming Performance Highlights:**
- **Cyberpunk 2077 (QHD+, RT Ultra):** 65-72 FPS with DLSS Quality
- **Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III (QHD+, High):** 120-140 FPS
- **Baldur's Gate 3 (QHD+, Ultra):** 80-95 FPS
- **Fortnite (QHD+, Epic settings):** 140+ FPS consistently
- **Apex Legends (QHD+, Max settings):** 130-150 FPS

**The i9-14900HX handles everything I throw at it** without breaking a sweat. Video editing in DaVinci Resolve, streaming while gaming, running multiple Chrome tabs (because we all do it) – this processor just doesn't care.

## Cooling: Cooler Boost 5 Actually Works (Shocking, I Know)

**MSI's Cooler Boost 5 system is legit.** I was skeptical because, let's face it, most laptop cooling solutions are more marketing than substance. But after running stress tests and extended gaming sessions, the thermal management actually holds up.

**Temperature readings during heavy gaming:**
- **CPU:** Peaks around 78-82°C (totally acceptable)
- **GPU:** Stays between 72-76°C (impressive for laptop standards)
- **Fan noise:** Noticeable but not ear-piercing

**The best part?** No thermal throttling during extended sessions. I had a 6-hour Baldur's Gate 3 marathon, and performance stayed consistent throughout.

## Memory and Storage: 32GB DDR5 + 1TB NVMe Done Right

**32GB of DDR5 RAM is overkill for gaming today, but future-proofing for tomorrow.** Current games max out around 16GB, but having that extra headroom means multitasking doesn't slow you down. Streaming, Discord, browser tabs, background apps – everything just works smoothly.

The **1TB NVMe SSD** loads games fast enough that I actually stopped checking my phone during loading screens. **Boot times are under 15 seconds**, and transferring large files doesn't make me want to grab coffee.

[Get yours with current pricing here](https://amzn.to/3TPgUmg)

## Build Quality: Surprisingly Solid for the Price Point

**MSI didn't cheap out on construction.** The chassis feels substantial without being unnecessarily heavy. The **RGB keyboard** isn't just for show – key travel and responsiveness are genuinely good for both gaming and typing.

**Build highlights:**
- **Sturdy hinge mechanism** (no wobble during typing)
- **Decent port selection** (USB-A, USB-C, HDMI 2.1, Ethernet)
- **Keyboard backlighting** that's actually useful, not just flashy
- **Trackpad** that doesn't suck (rare for gaming laptops)

## Windows 11 Home: The Good, The Meh, and The Fixable

**Windows 11 Home does the job**, though MSI's recommendation for Windows 11 Pro in business environments makes sense. The gaming-focused features like DirectStorage and Auto HDR work well with this hardware combo.

**Quick setup tip:** Disable some of the pre-installed bloatware during first boot. Takes 10 minutes and makes everything snappier.

## Real-World Gaming Experience: Where It Shines

**This laptop excels in scenarios where other mid-range options fall short:**

**Competitive Gaming:** The 165Hz display + RTX 5070 combo delivers the high framerates competitive players need. Input lag is minimal, and frame pacing is consistent.

**AAA Single-Player Games:** Ray tracing performance that doesn't require constant setting compromises. You can actually use the pretty graphics options.

**Content Creation:** The i9-14900HX handles video editing, streaming, and rendering tasks that would choke lesser processors.

**Multitasking:** 32GB RAM means you can have everything open without performance anxiety.

## The Few Things That Could Be Better

**Look, nothing's perfect, and honesty matters:**

- **Battery life during gaming** is what you'd expect from a performance laptop (1-2 hours max)
- **Weight** isn't ultrabook territory, but it's reasonable for the performance class
- **Price point** puts it in premium mid-range territory (not budget-friendly)
- **Fan noise under load** is present but manageable

**But here's the thing** – these aren't dealbreakers, they're just reality checks for what this type of machine delivers.

## Who Should Actually Buy This Thing?

**This laptop makes sense for:**
- **Serious gamers** who want high-refresh QHD+ gaming without desktop complexity
- **Content creators** who need powerful hardware in portable form
- **Students/professionals** who game hard but also need legitimate computing power
- **Anyone upgrading** from older gaming laptops ready for a significant performance jump

**This probably isn't for you if:**
- You're primarily gaming at 1080p and don't care about upgrading
- Battery life is your top priority
- You're strictly budget-shopping under $1500
- You already have a recent RTX 4070+ laptop and are happy with it

## Final Thoughts: Actually Worth Your Money?

**After weeks of real-world use, this MSI Katana 15 HX delivers on its promises.** The RTX 5070 + i9-14900HX combo provides genuine high-end gaming performance, the QHD+ 165Hz display enhances every game, and the build quality justifies the price point.

**Is it perfect?** Nah. **Is it the best gaming laptop value in its price range right now?** Pretty damn close.

**The bottom line:** If you're in the market for a gaming laptop that can handle today's demanding games at high settings while being reasonably future-proof, this Katana 15 HX deserves serious consideration. It's one of those rare laptops that performs better than its price suggests it should.

**IMO, MSI finally nailed the balance between performance, features, and price** with this one. Worth checking out if you're serious about your gaming setup.

1lo5xhs,https://i.redd.it/np7zt26632af1.jpeg,"$ATYR – What’s On This Week: Post-Russell Flows, Structural Positioning, and Community Updates","Hi folks,

Happy Monday, I trust you had a relaxing weekend. While many of you are sweltering in the Northern hemisphere summer, us Aussies are freezing our way through one of the coldest winters in memory. There’s snow in the mountains, and lots of it. 

I just wanted to kick things off this week with a bit of a reset and a personal thank you. Honestly, I’m still a bit wiped from Friday and the whole Russell rebalance saga. It’s a little bit ridiculous—I’d *planned* to take Friday off, but of course, the market had other ideas. The moment things started getting interesting, I was straight back in front of the screen, glued to the price action and flicking between windows, DMs, and a never-ending list of browser tabs. This was supposed to be the “quiet” patch, but if you’ve been anywhere near the community or the comments section over the last few days, you’ll know it was anything but.

I really want to say thank you for all the engagement, questions, comments, and private messages. The level of thought and curiosity in the community around the rebalance—just the number of people following the tape, sharing their takes, asking about mechanics, and swapping insights—was genuinely energising. It felt like we had people from all corners chipping in: a lot of new faces, a few old hands, and plenty of “I never comment but I had to jump in this time” moments, which I really appreciate. There’s something about these kinds of market events—when you know most people have tuned out or written it off as “noise,” but the real work is happening behind the scenes, and the real dialogue is happening here—that just brings out the best in everyone.

I also want to take a second and just be transparent about the support side. The generosity and encouragement that came in last week blew me away. I’ve had more “Buy Me a Coffee” notifications in the last few days than I’ve had in months, which makes a real difference. And a bunch of you reached out about PayPal, which honestly wasn’t something I’d set up yet—so I’m in the process of getting that sorted. I’m genuinely humbled by how many people said, “Hey, I’d like to chip in, but your tip jar doesn’t take PayPal.” It’s not lost on me; the fact that people even care enough to ask is huge. So, if you want to help keep these deep dives coming, here’s the [Buy Me a Coffee link](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/BioBingo). And if you’re waiting on PayPal, I hear you, I’m on it—will let you know as soon as it’s sorted. Either way, it’s the thought that counts, and just knowing there’s genuine value here is all the motivation I need to keep pushing.

So, what are we actually doing here today? This is one of those “catch your breath” posts—a check-in, a little context for the week ahead, and a quick look at what’s (not) on the calendar. I want to talk a bit about why the next few days are likely to be some of the quietest we’ve seen in a while, share a behind-the-scenes on what I’ve been working on (spoiler: a lot, including some nerdy statistical studies and the beginnings of the training course), and outline a few “coming soon” dates so people know what to watch for as we move deeper into July.

### 1. Russell Rebalance Recap & Statistical Deep Dive

Last Friday’s Russell rebalance was one of those rare days that crystallises just how much market structure and institutional mechanics can override everything else—narrative, fundamentals, even retail sentiment—for a single trading session. For $ATYR, nearly 16 million shares changed hands, volumes we almost never see outside the context of forced, systemic buying and selling. The closing auction alone was a case study in how price can be pinned by the intersection of passive index flows, professional traders, and tight float mechanics.

What makes this moment especially rich for analysis is that it wasn’t just $ATYR—every one of the 126 new Russell 3000 additions experienced its own version of organised chaos. Since Friday, I’ve gone deep into the data, dissecting not just what happened in our corner of the market, but across the entire landscape of new index entrants.

**The Analytical Lens:**  
What I set out to do was pretty straightforward: treat the full Russell addition cohort as a living experiment in market microstructure. I broke down the group in all the usual ways—by sector, by market cap, by average daily liquidity, and by float size. But I also tried to peel back the layers a bit: what actually happens when you separate the most constrained micro-caps from the more liquid names, or focus on high institutional-ownership stocks versus those with a more fragmented base?

Here are a few highlights from what I’m seeing so far:

- **Diversity in Every Dimension:**  
  The 126 additions run the full spectrum—not just biotech, but everything from industrials to software, with market caps ranging from the lower end of small-cap all the way up to mid-cap territory. There’s a floor to inclusion; you won’t find true penny stocks or illiquid micro-microcaps here, but you do see a wide variance in how “tight” the float really is.

- **Volatility and Auction Dynamics:**  
  The tape was wild across the board, but the structure of that volatility was different depending on underlying float and ownership. Stocks with more “sticky” hands or higher institutional presence saw sharper pins and tighter trading bands, especially as the closing auction approached. In contrast, the more liquid or less concentrated names often absorbed flows with a bit less drama.

- **The Passive Flow Effect:**  
  Indexers, by design, must buy at the close—there’s no discretionary execution. The rest of the market knows this, and the run-up into the auction is often dominated by arbs and market makers managing risk, building inventory, and sometimes manufacturing the appearance of supply. The end result is that most of the real float transfer doesn’t happen until the final minutes, and much of the day’s trading is just professionals flipping shares back and forth.

- **No “Free Lunch”:**  
  If you’d simply bought an equal-weighted basket of all new additions on the day, you’d have lost about 0.3%. The baseline for “just showing up” is modestly negative. But that’s where the fun begins—because, in my view, real edge is found when you start slicing by sector, float, and volatility. The smaller, tighter names saw more pronounced dislocations—sometimes setting up for mean reversion or post-event volatility that can be systematically exploited.

- **Patterns & Hypotheses:**  
  Already, some clear patterns are emerging: stocks with very tight floats or high recent institutional accumulation behave differently—not just on rebalance day, but in the run-up and aftermath. These are not just academic curiosities; they offer real-world implications for anyone trading around these events, whether as a retail participant or a small fund looking for repeatable setups.

**What Comes Next:**  
This is still an early read—my next step is a full, multi-phase timeline analysis. I’ll be breaking out what happens at each stage (announcement day, confirmation day, rebalance day itself), tracking not just $ATYR but the whole cohort. My aim is to move beyond anecdote and deliver proper quantitative insight into where and how the mechanics create opportunity (and risk) for smaller, more reflexive stocks.

I’ll bring all of this together in a dedicated, data-driven post later this week, with a special focus on micro-cap and small-cap biotechs. My hope is that by sharing this level of forensic analysis, we can collectively get sharper at reading the setup next time—and maybe even front-run some of the structural alpha that’s hiding in plain sight.

### 2. The Quietest Week in Ages: What’s (Not) Happening, Why It Matters, and How I’m Reading It

If Friday’s Russell rebalance was a market-wide ‘fire drill’, this week is the exact opposite: a stretch of calm so complete it almost feels artificial. Honestly, after seeing nearly 16 million $ATYR shares change hands in a single day, it’s a strange feeling to come into Monday knowing that—for the first time in a long while—there’s almost nothing on the immediate radar. But here’s the thing: for anyone who takes market structure seriously, these weeks are gold. Every variable that does move is easier to spot, every anomaly stands out, and the “set plays” become that much more predictable.

Let me walk you through why I think this week is so unique, and how I’m approaching it—step by step, just as I do in my own tracking:

- **No earnings on deck:** Next financials are still weeks away (likely mid-August). Management is in “quiet mode”—don’t expect sudden updates or pre-readout guidance.
- **No options expiry:** The next major expiry is July 18. Most of the action is pinned around the $5.00 and $5.50 strikes, but there’s no imminent gamma squeeze or OI fireworks in play right now.
- **No new short interest data:** Last reading before the rebalance showed elevated short interest (15%+ of float). After Friday, my suspicion is some shorts were forced to cover during the closing auction (they had no choice when indexers vacuumed up the available shares). Still, I doubt all shorts closed out—some will have rolled forward, and I’m watching borrow rates for signs the float is even tighter. Any spike in borrow cost or a collapse in available inventory is a clue something unusual is afoot.
- **No institutional filings due:** All the big quarterly 13F/NPORTs are in, so there won’t be a new wave of data to dissect for weeks. If a fund wants to move size, it’ll show up only in block prints or unusual tape, not in a new filing.
- **No index rebalances or passive flows:** The big event is behind us. No more forced buying or selling until the next semi-annual rebalance. The float is, for now, “reset.”
- **No scientific/medical conferences:** Calendar is empty—no sector-wide macro news, nothing on the conference circuit to drive cross-stock volatility.
- **No company news/catalyst windows:** Nothing scheduled. Management will be tightly buttoned-down through data lock.

I’m highlighting all of this because it’s not an accident—these dates and windows are knowable, trackable, and I check them systematically every week. It’s the only way to know when the set plays are “on.”

So, what does this all mean in practice? Well, when the catalyst calendar is empty and most variables are dormant, we get a rare setup: **high predictability**. The big moves (for now) are done. The professionals lean on repeatable range trades, the tape compresses, and price often gets “pinned” by lack of directional flow. It’s almost like lab conditions—a controlled environment where you can see exactly who’s active and who isn’t.

For anyone running size, this is the window to quietly build or unwind positions without telegraphing intent. But because liquidity is thinner and float is tighter post-rebalance, even small orders can move the price disproportionately. If you see a cluster of block trades, a sudden volume surge, or a rapid move in borrow rates, that’s a sign something non-random is happening.

From my perspective, this is the week to practice patience, stay alert to tape nuances, and be ready to pounce if an outlier shows up. Most of the time, it’ll be sideways drift and boredom—but when the variables are this well defined, any real move will be obvious.

### 3. The Road Ahead: Mapping Out What Actually Matters

Given how quiet this week is shaping up to be, I want to use the space to set expectations for what’s actually on the calendar for $ATYR. This is where the real value of having a system and a calendar-driven process comes in: when there’s no headline news, you need to orient yourself with what *can* and *will* move the tape in the weeks ahead.

**Earnings:**  
The next concrete milestone for $ATYR is the Q2 earnings release, now confirmed for after-market close on Tuesday, August 12, 2025. In ordinary circumstances, earnings for a pre-commercial biotech are often non-events—just an update on cash burn and “how’s the runway” type questions. But with the Phase 3 readout looming, the market will be hypersensitive to any hint, even in tone, about timing, data confidence, or anything management chooses to telegraph. Sometimes, even a small change in wording around “timelines” or “interim milestones” can set off speculative waves, especially when the float is tight and the trading crowd is starved for news. So, while I wouldn’t expect fireworks, it’s a date worth marking and, in my experience, often a day where you see short-term volatility as traders jockey for position ahead of what they think might be dropped in the Q&A.

**Options Expiry:**  
July 18 and August 15 are the next standard monthly expiries. This is always a chess match in a quiet tape. With hundreds to thousands of open contracts sitting at strikes like $5.00, $5.50, $7.50 and above, options flows can and do pin the tape on expiry weeks—especially when there’s little competing news. Sometimes you’ll see “pinning” right at the major strikes, as dealers and market makers hedge out risk and retail tries to game the last few pennies. If you see sudden moves into those dates, check the volume and open interest—sometimes, a seemingly random spike is just a mechanical unwind, not a fundamental shift.

**Short Interest Reporting:**  
The next bi-weekly short interest snapshot will be published July 3–5. After the Russell rebalance, I’m fascinated to see what happened: Did shorts cover into that massive auction, or are they still hanging on in size? If we see a sharp drop, it might suggest some of the forced buying on Friday was shorts scrambling to cover as liquidity appeared. If it’s still elevated, it means the “coiled spring” setup is very much intact—more fuel for any future squeeze. Either way, this is a datapoint that’s underappreciated by most of the market, but for those of us watching float mechanics, it’s crucial.

**Data Lock:**  
This is the date when the Phase 3 study officially closes to new patient data, and the statisticians get to work. For $ATYR, that’s the end of August—call it the final few days of the month. While there’s often a lag between data lock and public readout (as data is cleaned, verified, and analysed), this is the moment the “answer” is essentially set in stone, even if we don’t see it immediately. Sometimes, smart money tries to game these windows, watching for any signs of early leaks, changes in management behaviour, or odd options activity. For retail, it’s mostly a “wait and see” game, but it’s a meaningful psychological milestone.

**Phase 3 Readout:**  
The crown jewel on the calendar—guidance remains for late August to sometime in September. This is the binary event everything is pointing toward, and the single most important catalyst for the stock this year. History says the tape can go eerily quiet right before, as both sides wait for the hammer to fall, or it can start to drift upward on positioning and anticipation. I’m personally watching for any “tells” in volume, block trades, or new filings as we approach that window. Just as importantly, the second- and third-order effects (derivative volume, borrow rates, even chatter in peer names) will all start to light up as the market tries to get ahead of the news.

**Index Events:**  
One subtle but important structural shift: Russell rebalances are now happening twice a year instead of once, in an effort to reduce the “shock and awe” volume we just saw last week. The next wave of index flows won’t come until December, but it’s a change that could affect how the float trades and how predictable these liquidity windows are. I’m keeping a close eye on whether these interim index windows create new arbitrage opportunities or if the market “adapts” and we see less volatility. It’s a moving target.

**Conferences and Wildcards:**  
At the moment, there are no major scientific or medical conferences scheduled in July or early August that would move $ATYR or its peer group. Of course, this can change fast—management can always be added to an investor event, or an abstract can appear out of nowhere. But as of now, I’m not expecting big, scheduled news from the conference circuit.

But here’s the thing: in biotech, the known calendar is only half the game. The market is always primed for “out of nowhere” developments: a surprise partnership, licensing deal, positive or negative regulatory news from a peer, even a hostile bid or activist campaign. This is why, even as I try to map out the calendar and forecast the tape, I never take my eyes off the news feeds or the block tape. The biggest moves sometimes come when everyone’s fallen asleep at the wheel.

**In summary:**  
We’re entering a phase where all the “knowns” are out in the open, and the stock is, in many ways, in a holding pattern, waiting for someone to blink. In my view, the best way to play these stretches is to keep your system tight, your watchlist up to date, and your expectations realistic—there’s high predictability around scheduled events, but always that ever-present risk of surprise. I’ll be keeping the community posted with anything that changes, any shifts in the calendar, or any hints of life in the tape. If you have your own dates you’re tracking, or think I’ve missed something, shout it out below. The more eyes, the sharper the edge.

### 4. What to Expect This Week: Market Structure & Trading

Alright, so let’s talk about what’s likely on deck for us this week now that the dust has settled after the Russell rebalance. If you’re anything like me, you probably spent the weekend half-replaying Friday’s tape in your mind and half just catching up on lost sleep. But now that the volume spike has come and gone, we’re stepping into a new kind of environment—one that, if I’m honest, is usually less about drama and more about the kind of market behaviour that only gets interesting if you know how to watch for it.

#### *A Classic Post-Event Hangover*

I’ve seen this movie enough times to know: after a major index event like what we just had, the market usually needs a moment to catch its breath. All the forced buyers, the arbs, the market makers—they’ve played their hands, squared their books, and are now off looking for the next event. What’s left behind is almost like the morning after a big party: the volume falls away, price action goes quiet, and all the action moves to the edges.

What does this look like for $ATYR? My base case is a week of sideways, range-bound trading, with the price likely gravitating toward that $5.00 level (give or take a few cents in either direction). I wouldn’t be surprised to see daily volume drop back to a fraction of what we saw on Friday—maybe even back to the sort of levels we saw a few weeks ago before all the excitement began. I always say, this is when the “real” holders tend to stick around, while the fast money has already moved on.

#### *Liquidity, Volatility, and the Tape Itself*

Now, these quieter weeks might sound boring, but in my experience, they can actually be revealing. With fewer shares sloshing around, you can start to see which hands are “sticky” and who’s just passing through. Liquidity gets patchy; sometimes you’ll see the bid-ask spread widen out for no obvious reason, or a few hundred shares push the price more than you’d expect. This isn’t a sign of some underlying issue, but rather a reflection of a tighter float and a thinner order book.

I’ll be honest: these are the weeks that teach you patience. If you’re used to trading or watching big moves, it can feel like watching paint dry. But it’s precisely in these periods that a lot of meaningful setups are built. Institutions are rarely putting on size during a lull, but they are watching, waiting, and occasionally nibbling if something interesting happens on the tape. The best thing to do is just pay attention—track the blocks, watch the order flow, and see if any new themes start to emerge.

#### *Options and Short Interest: My Take*

I did a full sweep of the options chain over the weekend. There’s open interest at all the usual spots (the $5 and $7.50 strikes, etc.), but no “big tell” in the numbers. Implied volatility has come down a bit now that the event risk is past. That doesn’t mean something can’t build up over the next couple of weeks as we head into the July expiry, but for now, it all looks pretty benign. Still, I like to keep an eye on the chains, just to see if anyone starts placing asymmetric bets or building unusual spreads as we get closer to the next scheduled catalyst.

On the short interest front, it’s honestly a similar story. I haven’t seen any dramatic moves in borrow rates, and the reported numbers haven’t spiked or collapsed. In my view, it’s just another sign that most of the active players are sitting on their hands for now. Of course, this is biotech, so that can always change in a hurry—but there’s no smoke at the moment.

#### *What’s the Playbook for the Week?*

So what’s my personal approach? When I see this kind of post-event “quiet tape,” I shift gears from reacting to events to just observing the structure. Who’s accumulating on red days? Who’s providing liquidity on the bid? Are there any signs of stealthy institutional accumulation, or is the tape just being held together by retail? These are the clues I’m watching for, because they often signal where the next wave of momentum might come from once news starts to flow again.

And look, I totally get it if these weeks feel a little slow. There’s a temptation to look for action, to force trades, or to chase any move that stands out. But in my experience, the best moves often come *after* periods like this—when the market has lulled most people to sleep, and then something shifts. That’s why I always say: don’t let boredom become your enemy. Sometimes, the quiet stretches are when the real edge is built.

#### *Final Thoughts—The Value of Patience*

For me, this week is all about being a patient observer. If you see something out of the ordinary—sudden volume, a big options position, a block trade that doesn’t fit the pattern—those are the moments to take note. Otherwise, I think we’re in for a classic “summer market” in biotech: thin liquidity, range-bound prices, and a lot of watching and waiting as we move toward the next big catalyst.

And of course, if anything does pop up—whether it’s a surprise PR, a leak, or a sudden burst of institutional interest—I’ll call it out for the community as always. Until then, use the lull to reflect, refine your process, and get ready for the next round. Sometimes, just being patient is the smartest play you can make.

### 5. Bespoke Deep Dives – Micro/Small-Cap Biotech Only

I want to quickly touch on something that’s been picking up momentum behind the scenes: bespoke deep-dive research. Over the past week or two, I’ve had a number of you reach out privately—sometimes after reading a post, sometimes just because you’re tracking a name and want a more detailed lens than what’s out there in the usual channels.

Just to be clear, I only do this kind of work for micro-cap and small-cap biotech stocks—nothing outside that sandbox. That’s really where my interest and expertise lie, and frankly, it’s where I believe the most overlooked opportunities (and risks) can hide. So if you’re tracking a stock in another sector, I’m probably not the right fit. But if you’re deep in the biotech weeds, this is absolutely my lane.

What does a bespoke deep dive look like? It can be thematic—maybe you’re trying to wrap your head around the science, the management team, or the web of partnerships and deals. Sometimes it’s about sentiment and how a stock’s being traded, or it might be a full-spectrum analysis of all the key drivers that matter for a particular name. Every request is a bit different, and that’s half the fun. Over the weekend, I did a bit of an inventory on all the different angles you can take on a biotech stock, and I counted at least twenty distinct types of deep dives you could do. These range from pipeline analysis, IP and patent review, and competitive landscape, to things like trial design, regulatory risk, and financial structure. I’ll actually be covering these in detail in the training course, but I’ll also keep sharing some as standalone posts when the time is right.

This is a paid service—I’ve built a cost model so I can quote depending on the scope and complexity. Right now, I’m already scoping out a few for readers who’ve reached out, just as a bit of an experiment in making this whole thing sustainable longer term. Maybe it becomes part of the funding model for all the work I’m doing here, maybe it just stays a side project—I’ll see how it evolves.

If you’re interested in having a truly deep, forensic analysis on a biotech name you’re invested in or considering, just shoot me a message and let’s talk through what you need. 

And as always, I’ll keep dropping more thematic deep dives into the main feed, especially when there’s an angle or a sector trend that I think everyone can learn from.

### 6. Training Course Update

I want to take a minute to talk about the training course, because honestly, this is shaping up to be something pretty special—not just for me, but for anyone in this community who really wants to take their biotech investing to a new level. The response to the poll blew me away: nearly a hundred of you jumped in with feedback, and the message was crystal clear—people want practical, modular, self-paced video training, with real substance behind it.

Here’s why I’m so excited about this: for years, the information advantage has sat with the institutions, the pros, and the people who do this for a living. Most retail investors are left trying to piece together scraps from Reddit threads, news articles, and the occasional analyst note. What I’m building here is the exact opposite. My goal is to give you a practical process—a full pathway from start to finish—so you can close that information gap and start thinking about biotech the way I do. I truly believe this is teachable, and nothing would make me happier than to see members of this community start out-reading, out-thinking, and out-positioning the so-called “smart money.”

This isn’t going to be just another set of theory-heavy lectures or a bunch of recycled PowerPoint slides. This will be a toolkit: everything from how I approach an idea, to how I gather and categorise information, all the way to the “forensic” analysis that goes into building conviction and identifying real opportunity. Every module will be practical, actionable, and designed so that even if you just walk away with *one* new insight or tool, you’re already ahead of the game.

There will be surprises in there—real examples, tips and tricks I use every day, and the same tools and checklists I rely on to separate the signal from the noise. And it won’t be overwhelming; it’s all modular, so you can dive deep where you want, or pick and choose based on what fits your investing approach. Each module builds on the last, so by the time you’re through, you’ll have a full, repeatable process for breaking down biotech names, tracking market structure, and spotting asymmetric opportunities—regardless of your starting point.

Honestly, I can’t wait to see what people do with this material. I’ve done a lot of training, mentoring, and presenting over my career, but nothing quite like this, with such a targeted, passionate group of retail investors. If this helps just a handful of you close that information symmetry gap—even a little—I’ll consider it a win.

So here’s what’s next: I’ll be sharing a few sneak peeks of the content and structure in the weeks ahead. If all goes to plan, I’m aiming for the first modules to be ready in the third week of August. I’ll likely open up an early-bird offer for those keen to get in ahead of the crowd—discounts, first access, and all that. It’ll be accessible, information-packed, and built to give you a real edge in a market that’s stacked against most retail players.

And finally—I want to say again how grateful I am to this community for pushing me to do this. It was your feedback and your curiosity that convinced me to take the plunge and build something meaningful. I genuinely believe that, together, we can raise the bar for what’s possible as retail biotech investors. So stay tuned—there’s much more to come, and I think you’re going to love what’s on the way.

### Summary

As we settle into what’s likely to be one of the quietest stretches $ATYR has seen in a long time, here’s a quick recap of what to watch for this week—and what you can expect from me and the community:

- **A textbook “quiet week”:** With no earnings, no options expiry, no short interest update, no institutional filings, and no index events, most of the typical market levers are dormant. Unless a surprise hits, expect a calm, range-bound tape and lower volume, with the stock likely to pin near support and resistance levels set by the recent rebalance.
- **Laboratory mode for market structure:** With the noise dialled down, this is a golden opportunity to observe how the stock trades in a clean environment. I’ll be watching for subtle shifts in block trades, bid/ask behaviour, and any signs of stealthy accumulation or distribution—this is where real edges are often built, especially for patient traders.
- **High predictability, but still stay alert:** The set plays are in motion, but wildcards are always possible—unexpected PRs, partnerships, or new catalysts could hit at any time. I’ll be on the lookout and will update if anything changes.

But just because it’s a quiet week doesn’t mean nothing’s happening here. Quite the opposite—I’ll be dropping some of the deep-dive analysis I mentioned earlier, including:

- **Detailed breakdowns from my ongoing Russell Additions statistical study:** I’ll be sharing more on the quantitative patterns I’m seeing across the 126 new Russell stocks, with a focus on biotech and actionable insights for the community.
- **Reflections and lessons from the rebalance:** Expect more forensic takes on what we learned from Friday’s fireworks, and how to apply that thinking to future index events or your own trading playbook.
- **Ongoing community building and practical learning:** Even without major news, this is an ideal week to connect, swap ideas, and dig deeper into the “how” and “why” behind market structure. If you’ve got questions, requests for analysis, or want to bounce around ideas, don’t hesitate to reach out—this is your space as much as mine.

And while ATYR is the focus right now, remember: the real aim is to build a mindset and toolkit you can use on any micro- or small-cap biotech. This isn’t just about one stock—it’s about approaching the market in a smarter, more forensic way, and levelling the playing field against institutional players. If you’re not yet comfortable applying these frameworks elsewhere, keep following along—or consider joining the upcoming training course. That’s designed to help you develop your own edge, no matter what stock you’re working on.

I adore you and watch you all the time!

I'm not much of a redditer, however after reading a lot of you amazing stories I decided to contribute as well.

And boy, do I have one for you…

Disclaimer: This is long, and English isn’t my first language (third, actually), so please be kind. All names, including mine, have been changed for privacy.

This event takes place around four years ago. I (33F) had recently called off my wedding due to my ex's extreme mental instability, which he had hidden from me. For years, he was sweet, caring, and seemed like the nicest guy in the world. Sure, he was a bit jealous sometimes, but most guys are, so I didn’t pay much attention to it. Once I agreed to marry him, however, everything slowly started unraveling. He became extremely jealous, verbally abusive, and even got to the point where he would follow me around just to show up out of nowhere if I so much as spoke to a male sales clerk.

After four months of this, I called off the whole wedding, even though deposits had already been paid (all checks written by me, as we were supposed to merge our accounts before the wedding).

So here I was: heartbroken and sad, in an empty apartment, with a $20,000 debt to boot. I was absolutely distraught and wouldn’t leave the house unless it was to go to work. I avoided everyone. My depression got so bad that my boss decided it would be best for me to go on sick leave so I could have time to piece myself back together. I was granted two weeks of paid leave and told to go ""work on my mental health.""

Since I was so down from losing a big chunk of my savings on a failed relationship, I planned to spend those two weeks alone in my apartment sulking.

My mother, however, had different plans.

On the second day of my mental health vacation, my mother called me up, saying she had to come and speak to me personally and that it was extremely important. I told her to come by, and in less than 20 seconds she was at my door—as if she’d been waiting downstairs in her car for me to answer.

Without a moment’s hesitation and hardly a hello, my mother went straight to my living room cupboard and started looking for something. After about a minute or so of rummaging, she found what she was looking for. She then proceeded to my wardrobe and began packing a small overnight backpack for me while I ran after her demanding to know what on earth was going on. Without even turning her head from the closet, my mother said, ""Sweetie, depression is a deep and dark hole. If you don’t get up and start climbing your way out right now, you might never be able to."" She then turned around and handed me my leather travel bag, packed and ready to go.

Since arguing with my mother would have probably taken more mental and physical energy than I had at the time, I decided to just go along with her, thinking we were probably going to her place or on a little trip out of town for the night, as the bag was light.

I got into my mother's car and soon found out that I was seriously wrong. My mother had driven us to the airport as we apparently had a flight to catch. I was dumbfounded. I turned to my mother and asked, ""What the hell is going on?""

""What do you mean? We are at an airport. What do you think is going on?"" my mother replied like I was the crazy one, then proceeded to exit the car and waited for me to join her. As soon as I got out, she pulled out a joint, lit it, and passed it to me. I looked at her shocked—we were in the middle of the airport parking lot and weed is not recreationally legal where I’m from. This didn’t bother her one bit. Knowing my mother isn’t what you would call a ""typical parent,"" I took a couple of drags to help me cope with whatever she had planned next.

As we walked from the parking lot to the airport, I suddenly realized I had absolutely no form of ID on me—I had forgotten to grab my purse. I stopped and said, ""I have no ID with me. My purse is at home!""

My mother burst out laughing and told me to look inside the bag she had packed. Sure enough, inside was a brand-new purse, my wallet, and my passport, along with a change of clothes.

""Why else do you think I was going through your things? I already had the weed,"" my mother said while still laughing at my confused expression.

Before leaving the car, I had grabbed a hoodie out of the trunk, as my mother almost always has clothes in her trunk that she forgets to drop off for donation. The hoodie was my brother's old Trolls hoodie that had been sitting in storage for probably 15 years and was quite worn out. (Remember this part—it’s important later.) Since I was already a mess, I thought, ""F it.""

Everything seemed to be looking up a bit. I was on a trip with my wacky mom to Europe. Little did I know that things would soon turn.

We landed at Ferenc Liszt International Airport (Budapest, Hungary) and went straight to the transfer waiting to take us to the hotel. The driver was great, joked around the whole way, and made my mood even better. However, when we got to the hotel, that mood died quickly.

The driver pulled up in front of the hotel. I won’t say the name, but let’s just say it’s a world-known 5-star hotel chain with a tree in their logo.

The driver opened our door to let us out. We thanked him and turned to enter the hotel. Before we could get inside, a maître d’ in uniform stepped between us and the doors and asked what we were looking for. I told him we were checking in. He looked me up and down, then gave me a weird look and asked, ""To this hotel?"" as if implying we were in the wrong place.

I calmly replied, ""Yes, to this hotel,"" not wanting to cause a scene in front of my mother.

The man smirked and said, ""I'm sorry, but I don’t think we have any vacant rooms at this time. Maybe try the Hilton—they’re more affordable.""

My mother overheard this and pulled out her phone to call the hotel reception—while we were still standing outside. Before she could hang up, a security guard was sent out to let us in. He and the maître d’ exchanged some words in Hungarian, and the maître d’ turned away as if he had done nothing wrong. The security guard guided us to the reception area and offered to help us with our nonexistent bags. Since we didn’t bring much, we joked that we were light packers.

When we got to the reception, a lady came over and asked if she could ""help us"" and ""what we were looking for.""

Since I could see my mother was starting to get upset and her usually happy expression was turning, I said, ""Yes, you can help by checking us into a room, please. My name is—""

I was cut off by the receptionist who said, ""I'm sorry, but the hotel is completely booked at the moment. If you don’t have a reservation, I don’t think we can help you.""

Here is where I started to lose it, given my already damaged mental state. Now I get it—this is a 5-star hotel and I walked in with a raggedy old hoodie, ripped jean shorts, and Havaianas flip-flops—so I might not look like their usual clientele. But still.

Before my mother could answer (because trust me, no one wants that), I turned to her and in our language asked if she could go outside and roll me a smoke, as I didn’t feel comfortable speaking in front of her. She got the message and went to sit down at the café terrace.

Then I turned back to the receptionist.

Since I had worked in the hotel industry before, I knew making a scene or raising my voice wouldn’t be ideal. So I went another way: the petty way.

I pulled out my phone, hit record, and stuck it in my front pocket, lifting my hoodie just enough so the camera could see what was going on without being visible.

Then I walked up to the receptionist, looked at her name tag (let’s call her Eve), and said, ""Hello again, Eve. Listen, we do have a reservation to THIS hotel. So if you could please bring your nose down from the clouds long enough to check us in, that would be great. Thank you.""

She looked shocked and replied with attitude, ""If you had a reservation, you would know check-in starts at 3 p.m., not before. The only guests who get early check-in are those who have reserved suites.""

I smiled. This was about to get fun.

""You know, I find it interesting that I’ve spoken to multiple employees here, yet not one has asked for my name. You all simply assumed from the way I look that I must be a walk-in looking to use the bathroom or something. However, I’m a forgiving person, so let’s try this again. My name is Autumn Herceg. After you’re done wiping the embarrassment off your overly-injected face, you’re welcome to send someone to take our bags to the Riverview Suite. Thank you,"" I said and walked off to join my mother.

Of course, my gorgeous mother was already sitting outside with her coffee, laughing and joking with a nice older gentleman at the next table, named Ben. Her laughter lifted my mood. I ordered a coffee and asked what they were laughing about. My mother was telling Ben how she dragged me from one country to another with no notice. I laughed with them and added, ""Too bad they’re so rude here, though.""

Ben’s eyes widened. ""Rude? Why would you say that?""

I was about to explain when Eve returned with a man in a blue suit—Dominik, the lobby manager. Before he could speak, Ben cut him off and started grilling them in Hungarian. Every time Dominik or Eve tried to reply, he shut them down.

Eventually, they claimed I had been rude. I handed Ben my phone and showed him the recording. He played it for Dominik, who looked furious and turned to Eve.

Turns out, Eve had told her manager she refused to serve us because I was rude. I didn’t know that asking to be checked in was considered rude. Also, I was with my mother—which meant even if I wanted to curse someone out (which I REALLY did), I couldn’t. That woman would’ve taken off her shoe and smacked me upside the head if I embarrassed her in public.

Dominik started apologizing profusely and offered to take our belongings to the room. I lifted our two small backpacks, and he looked confused.

""Is that all the luggage you brought for a week?""

My mother, without missing a beat, pulled out her credit card and said, ""I also brought this, and an intent to spend your monthly salary shopping with my daughter. Why, if I have this, would I need to schlep heavy suitcases around? And why is it your business how we travel?""

Dominik and Eve were dumbfounded. Ben giggled along with us, then turned to Eve and said in English, ""You should be ashamed of the way you judge people by appearances. Not everyone is foolish enough to spend hundreds of euros on a pair of shoes just to impress you.""

He then turned to Dominik and asked him to fetch the General Manager.

Turns out Ben was a member of parliament who often visited the hotel’s café and sent dignitaries there due to its proximity to the Parliament building. He did not appreciate how visitors were being treated.

Within minutes, a stunning woman arrived—the General Manager. She greeted us kindly and asked what happened. Ben explained everything. As he spoke, her face fell. When I mentioned the recording, she asked me to send it to her so she could use it as grounds to fire Eve.

I asked for something else instead. I requested Eve be demoted, not fired. The GM looked surprised. I explained that if she were fired, she might never learn how to treat people properly. But if she were demoted, maybe she could.

From that moment on, the hotel staff—especially the security guard and the guest services manager—went out of their way to make up for what happened.

Moral of the story? Never underestimate a woman in a Trolls hoodie—especially one dragged through hell and dropped into Budapest by her joint-smoking, chaos-loving mother.

And that trip? It saved me. My mom dragged me back into life, kicking and screaming—and I’ll always be grateful for it.

1lo5x55,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1lo5x55/dcf_involvement_help/,DCF involvement help,"I’ve been in an emotionally abusive relationship for years. Married for 7.5, have an almost 3 year old.

I believe that my husband truly believes the things he says about me, and feels the things he feels, but they are all based on lies and exaggerations. Example: For years he’s tried to paint me as an alcoholic, to the point that I don’t drink at all anymore just so he has nothing to stand on (I was a social drinker before and he only started accusing me of this when he decided on his own to stop going to happy hours with me, but he always drank just as much if not more than I did before then). I’ve had ZERO problem not drinking, because I don’t have an addiction. But he still regularly calls me an alcoholic, accuses me of sneaking alcohol into my coffee to the point that he’s literally thrown out several bottles of cold brew because “how do I know they don’t have alcohol in them.” 

Anyway, one day we got into a huge fight where he was trying to pour my cold brew out AGAIN. I reached around him to grab it and he bit me and tried to claim I had him in a chokehold. I admit, I ended up biting him back. I was so tired of this that I called the cops. When they arrived they said if they filed charges it’d have to be against both of us and just encouraged us to take some space from one another, but they also needed to file a DCF case because my kid was in the home. I’m a clinical social worker myself so I know how this works and was upset about it but decided to play ball. 

When DCF investigated they were like “this seems like nothing so we are likely not going to open a case, but we’ll call your collaterals just to be safe.” They ended up opening a case after literally not hearing back from my collaterals for like less than one day. “Well we tried to reach them, oops.” Now I’m hearing from my husband that he told them things that are likely why they kept the case open. He paints me out to be this crazy alcoholic abuser. It’s classic DARVO (something he regularly accuses me of BTW). 

Anyway, I’ve been on my BEST behavior. Calm, cool, collected. Feeling great 99.9% of the time actually. I’m in therapy, I’m working out every day, I’m enjoying life as a whole EXCEPT my relationship with him. Well two weeks ago I woke up feeling terrible - hormones. I tried to just be chill, but that day he decided to blow up on me about something. Long story short - im not allowed to store things in my own closet because they’re “in the way.” He was complaining about a full length mirror I bought (didn’t consult him, shouldn’t have bought it, etc). In a fit of anger I forcefully moved the mirror out of the room into the living room, slamming it down with not enough force to break but still kindof angrily. Well my kid was in the room, so now he’s claiming I “threw a mirror at my kid.” Later that night I tried to apologize again for being so angry earlier and he was like “it’s okay, we don’t have to talk about it,” which is usually what he says when he realizes it was his fault I was pushed. 

Well today he informed me that he called the cops and DCF that day and opened another case on me because of this. I am inclined not to believe them because they have not called me or initiated a visit or investigation. That’s usually their protocol. I also am pretty sure the cops can’t file a case off of hearsay. Nonetheless I’m scared. I feel like he’s trying to use his charm to win over DCF and make it so that if I do try to leave, he gets custody of my kid. 

Every time I talk about leaving he claims “that’s abuse” because he says I’m trying to be coercive. No, I just want to leave, for real. He feels like if I would just “behave better” our marriage would be fine. Even when I’m at 100% peak my best self, our marriage is not fine. I’m miserable. I’m tired. And now I’ve got DCF involved, which not only affects our family structure but could affect my career if it goes too far. 

I am just really scared. Has anyone else had an abuser use DCF against them? Have you been able to successfully fight it? I feel like he’s just so charming to the outside that they’re all going to take his side ",1,1751285552.0,abusiverelationships,1,1.0,False

From auto-generated product descriptions and AI voiceovers to entire video ads made with zero human input, we’re entering an era of **cheap, fast, and highly scalable content creation**.

But here’s the catch: **audiences are starting to notice.**

A recent **GWI report (Q1 2025)** found that **42% of Gen Z and 36% of Millennials feel ""disconnected"" from ads they believe were created by AI** calling them ""generic,"" ""cold,"" or ""repetitive."" Platforms like Reddit and Twitter are full of users calling out AI-generated influencer posts, ads that use awkward synthetic voiceovers, or midjourney-style visuals that feel soulless.

At the same time, brands that invest in **craft, storytelling, and human touch** are standing out more. Think:

* **Nike’s latest “You Can’t Script This” campaign** shot on real 16mm film.
* **Zerodha’s zero-ad philosophy**, where trust is built through long-form education and transparency.
* **CRED’s quirky, creator-led ads** that embrace weirdness and individuality.

So here’s the core of the question: **In a world of AI-generated noise, how do you spot the brands still investing in creative craftsmanship?**  
Are we heading into a future where ""handcrafted marketing"" becomes a premium signal, like artisanal coffee or analog photography?  
Will AI kill storytelling, or just democratize it eaving real craft to stand out even more?

I’m curious how you personally **feel when you see an ad and can immediately tell it’s AI-made** does it matter if the content is still effective? Or is emotional resonance and originality something that truly needs human input?

1lo5stc,https://i.redd.it/rrjnd1xs12af1.jpeg,The $14.44 Tank Top That's Actually Worth the Hype: My Honest Review of the ANRABESS High Neck Ribbed Tank,"Okay, let's be real here – how many times have you scrolled through Amazon at 2 AM, adding random tank tops to your cart because they looked cute in the photos? :) I'm definitely guilty of this, and honestly, most of those impulse purchases turned out to be disappointing. But every once in a while, you stumble across something that makes you think, ""Wait, this is actually pretty damn good.""

That's exactly what happened with the ANRABESS Women's Sleeveless High Neck Tank Top. I know, I know – the name is a mouthful, but hear me out. This little gem has been sitting in my closet for months now, and I've probably worn it more than any other piece I own. So why am I writing about a basic tank top like it's the holy grail of fashion? Because sometimes the simplest pieces end up being the most game-changing.

## **What Makes This Tank Actually Special?**

Look, I've tried my fair share of ribbed tank tops over the years. Most of them either shrink after one wash, become completely see-through, or fit weird in all the wrong places. But this ANRABESS tank? It's different, and here's why.

**The fit is absolutely perfect.** I'm talking about that sweet spot where it's fitted enough to look polished but not so tight that you're constantly adjusting it. The high neck design is what really sets it apart from your average tank top – it's got that modern, sleek look that makes you look like you actually tried, even when you definitely didn't.

The racerback design isn't just for show either. It genuinely makes your shoulders look broader and more defined, which is honestly a confidence boost I didn't know I needed. And the ribbed fabric? It's stretchy enough to move with you but substantial enough that it doesn't cling to every imperfection.

## **Quality That Actually Lasts (Shocking, I Know)**

Here's where most cheap tank tops fail miserably – they either fall apart after a few washes or turn into shapeless rags. I've been wearing this ANRABESS tank for months now, and it still looks as good as the day I got it. The fabric is thick enough that it's not see-through (thank god), but it's not so thick that it's hot and uncomfortable.

The stitching is solid, the neckline hasn't stretched out, and it hasn't shrunk or faded. FYI, I throw this thing in the washer and dryer without any special care, and it comes out looking perfect every time. For a tank top that costs less than a fancy coffee, that's pretty impressive.

[Check out the tank top here](https://amzn.to/3Th3H5u)

## **Styling This Bad Boy: More Versatile Than You'd Think**

This is where the magic really happens. You'd think a basic ribbed tank wouldn't be that versatile, but you'd be wrong. I've worn this thing to work, to the gym, on dates, and even to more dressy occasions when layered properly.

**For work:** I throw a blazer over it with some high-waisted trousers, and suddenly I look like I have my life together. The high neck means you don't have to worry about showing too much skin in professional settings.

**For the gym:** It's perfect for workouts because the ribbed fabric is stretchy and the racerback design doesn't restrict your movement. Plus, it's cute enough that you won't feel like a slob if you run errands afterward.

**For going out:** Pair it with a leather jacket and some high-waisted jeans, and you've got that effortless cool-girl look that everyone's trying to achieve.

**For casual days:** Throw it on with shorts, a denim jacket, and sneakers. Boom – you look put-together without trying.

## **Let's Talk About the Fit Guide (Because Sizing is Always a Gamble)**

Here's the sizing breakdown from the product details:
- XS = US 0-2
- S = US 4-6  
- M = US 8-10
- L = US 12-14
- XL = US 16-18
- XXL = US 20-22

IMO, the sizing is pretty true to size, but if you're between sizes, I'd recommend going with your normal size. The fabric has enough stretch that it'll accommodate slight variations, but it's not so stretchy that it'll lose its shape.

## **The Not-So-Perfect Parts (Because Nothing's Perfect)**

Let's be honest – this isn't a luxury piece, and it shows in a few small ways. The fabric, while decent, isn't as soft as some higher-end options. It's not scratchy or uncomfortable, but it's not baby-soft either.

Also, if you're looking for a tank with built-in support, this isn't it. You'll definitely need to wear a bra with this one, which might be a dealbreaker for some people.

## **Why This Tank Fits Into Current Fashion Trends**

Right now, everyone's obsessed with that Y2K revival look, and this tank fits perfectly into that aesthetic. The high neck and ribbed texture are very much on-trend, and the slim fit gives you that early 2000s vibe without looking like you're wearing a costume.

The minimalist design also works with the ""quiet luxury"" trend that's been everywhere lately. It's simple, well-made, and doesn't scream for attention – exactly what people are gravitating toward right now.

## **Care Instructions (Keep It Looking Good)**

The care instructions are pretty straightforward: machine washable, no bleach, dry flat, don't iron. I've been ignoring the ""dry flat"" part and throwing it in the dryer on medium heat, and it's been fine. But if you want to be extra careful, hang drying will definitely help it last longer.

## **The Bottom Line: Is It Worth It?**

For less than ten bucks, this tank top delivers way more than it has any right to. It's well-made, versatile, and fits into multiple current fashion trends. Is it going to change your life? Probably not. But is it going to become a staple in your wardrobe that you reach for constantly? Absolutely.

The fact that it works for so many different occasions – from workouts to work to weekend hangouts – makes it an incredible value. Plus, at this price point, you can afford to buy it in multiple colors without feeling guilty about it.

[Grab it while it's on sale](https://amzn.to/3Th3H5u)

## **Final Thoughts**

Look, I'm not saying this tank top is going to solve all your fashion problems. But in a world where most fast fashion falls apart after two washes, finding a piece that actually lasts and looks good is worth celebrating. This ANRABESS tank has earned its place in my regular rotation, and I have a feeling it'll earn its place in yours too.

Whether you're building a capsule wardrobe, looking for workout gear that doesn't look like workout gear, or just need a reliable basic that goes with everything, this tank checks all the boxes. And at this price point, you really can't go wrong.

So go ahead, add it to your cart. Your future self will thank you when you're getting compliments on what you thought was just a basic tank top :)

1lo5sle,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1lo5sle/youre_not_lazy_broken_or_unmotivated_your_life_is/,"You’re not lazy, broken, or unmotivated. Your life is just wired for survival","For a long, long time, I honestly thought something was just fundamentally wrong with me.

Seriously, I couldn't focus. I couldn't finish anything. I felt tired, numb, and just constantly stressed. My conclusion? I was lazy. Or maybe weak. Or, even worse, just plain broken.

So, I tried to ""fix"" myself. Waking up at dawn, taking cold showers, blasting motivational quotes, chugging more coffee. I kept telling myself to push harder, harder, harder. But you know what? None of it actually helped. Not one bit.

Then, one day, I learned something huge. Like, truly perspective-shifting.

When your body feels unsafe, it just shuts everything down. Even if there's no actual danger happening around you.

There's this nerve in your body, called the vagus nerve. It's the one that helps you calm down, feel safe, connect with people, actually rest, and think clearly. But if it's not working well, your body just gets stuck in ""fight or flight"" mode.

And what does that even mean in real life?

* You feel nervous or numb for no real reason.
* You get tired incredibly fast.
* You find yourself scrolling endlessly instead of doing your work.
* You feel like just hiding or giving up on everything.
* You snap at people, or just feel totally empty.

And it's not because you're lazy. No. It's because your body is trying to protect you. It's a defense mechanism.

So, how do you help your body feel safe again? Sounds like a million-dollar question, but sometimes the answers are in the smallest, tiniest things.

Here are the little things that, for me, made a massive difference:

* Take slow breaths. Try breathing in for 4 seconds, then out for 8. It's like sending a direct message to your body ""Hey, we're okay now.""
* Hum or sing. Yeah, it sounds weird, but it really helps calm your nervous system. It's magic!
* Splash cold water on your face. Or, if you're brave, try a short cold shower. It's like a stress reset, I swear.
* Exercise, then rest. Move your body hard for a bit, then lie down. It teaches your body how to switch from ""go"" to ""calm""
* Sit or stand tall. Relax your face. Look around slowly. These small gestures actually tell your body it's safe.
* Eat good food. Your gut talks to your brain way more than you think. Don't underestimate that connection.

If you feel stuck, tired, or like you just can't try harder anymore... Maybe you don't need more willpower. Maybe your body just needs to feel safe again.

Try one tiny thing. One breath. One hum. One glass of water.

Start there.

You're not broken. You're healing. And that's incredibly powerful.

tl;dr: You're not lazy. Your body is just stuck in survival mode. Help it feel safe, and everything gets easier.",3,1751285173.0,getdisciplined,0,1.0,False

How to help?","I (nb29, autistic+adhd, diagnosed in teens) and my partner (m30, autistic, recently diagnosed) live together on a semi regular basis as we live in different cities, but we spend about 50% of the time together.


An issue of friction in our relationship is his relationship with food.

(Or my relationship with time, depending on how you view it) 


He himself expresses a lot of anxiety and stress around how little he gets done in his day to day life, and he often has to spend his sundays completing his remote work hours.


Quick warning that I write this in one of those moments of frustration- he is a lovely, amazing person, the kindest person I have ever met, and I am deeply in love with him as I have been for the last 3 years. 

Our morning routine looks like this:

Alarm rings. Both wake up. He lays in bed on his phone for about 20-60 min (can’t turn on the lights too much or open the curtain during the first 20 min bc “it’s too soon after waking up, if I don’t wake up right I will be tired the whole day”

After this is bathroom. 10-30 mins (idk what he does in there. When we met the Duolingo sound would be dinging from in there) 


After that he gets fully dressed and sits down in the kitchen. Here he usually does 1-2 steps before getting stuck on his phone for sometimes up to 45 min. Often with a bag of bread and a plate in front of him. 

He eventually makes the sandwich and it often takes another 30 min for him to eat it+15 more for the final drops of the coffee

After this 2-3 hour morning routine he might start doing things. But after about 2 hours of work or so, he gets hungry again. 

And then we’re back to 10-20 minutes scrolling and deciding what to eat, 15 minutes setting up the food if he has a prepped meal, 1hour to cook if not. 
Another 45-1h of actually eating it and then 30 minutes of procrastinating tidying the kitchen.



I sometimes feel like our entire lives revolve around his rest breaks or food breaks. 


I am fully aware that I am on the opposite end of the spectrum, I don’t have any issues at all with appetite, and bc of my combo high dose adhd meds+generally a very sort of high paced person

And I’m aware that we could separate our routines entirely. We do that sometimes

It does sometimes make at least me a little bit happier in some ways, I tend to feel a bit more in control of my time and my life

However it also feels lonely, and sort of like a waste when I’ve traveled 6 hours to come spend time together. 


It is very obvious to me and when we talk about it that while part of this is of course simply personality and something that I also love about him (he does things slowly and thoroughly which balances me out)

Some aspects to this might also be related to autistic needs not yet addressed. He only got diagnosed 8 months ago and haven’t yet gotten the help that’s available to autistics here in Sweden 


When we talk about it, he also agrees that there’s probably a bunch of things going on but he lacks the words to describe it, and having made it to 30 without support, a lot of autism related needs he has he has sort of resigned to the idea that life is super difficult and often painful, and he will simply never be able to have it better

Therefore I come to you here in this community. 

What might some needs of his be, that he is currently solving by scrolling/procrastinating?


Sensory? Decision making? Those of you who eat very slowly, why is that? Those who cook slowly, what do you feel makes it so?


Or perhaps I should ask, those of you who struggle in the kitchen with cooking or making food what are some reasons?

And those who struggle with eating, what are some reasons and some ways you’ve solved them?

As well, those who struggle with morning routine, what are some things that you’ve done that makes things easier for you?",1,1751285033.0,adultautism,0,1.0,False

I approached her and it was a decent interaction, and in the end I asked for her instagram and wished her goodbye. Then after that I talked with this girl for a few days, I decided to ask her to grab coffee with me in a cafe. I was actually expecting a straight out rejection, or at least like she'll agree but she'll suggest a new day, but guess what, she just said ""sure sounds good."" I was very nervous until she came and sat down. I pulled the chair for her. I asked her what she wanted to get, she was very shy lmao so I had to get 2 cold coffee (cafe frappe or whatever, wallet ro diya 😭). So what I did was, tease her a lot and also bantered around, and she also took her chances at playing with me. One time I asked her playfully ""you're not a psycho are you, when we walk out the door, are there gonna be two vans pulling up and some dudes gonna kidnap me and you're the mastermind behind it"" and she laughed about it and said ""yes high chances hai 😂"". I also broke the touch barrier by telling her I can read palms, I asked for her hand and read a line and told her she's gonna open up an oil refinery (inside joke), she laughs and asks me ""In India or Foreign?"" She told me ""you're very approachable that's why I came, and I am having a great time so far"" and I could pick up some non-verbal cues as well like her playing with her hair a lot (female grils do that apparently when they are around an interesting guy). After the date was over, I walked her off to the point she can get a rickshaw, and wished her goodbye, shook hands with her and held on to her hand for a few seconds more than normal and had a strong eye contact (pulled it off properly). I texted her later telling her I enjoyed her company a lot, and she reciprocated as well.

  
I enjoyed time with her a lot, so thought of sharing it with you all 🫠🫠",2,1751284851.0,TeenIndia,0,1.0,False

I’m a 22 (almost 23) year old born and raised in Alabama and… I GOTTA GET OUT. I’ve known for a while that the South isn’t for me, and lately I’ve just been feeling more and more stuck and resentful living here. It’s time for a change.

A little about me: I’m a licensed paramedic and graduating nursing school soon. Healthcare is my career, and I’m looking for a place where I can actually enjoy living and build a stable future. I’ve always been drawn to the Pacific Northwest and Washington State in particular — I love the idea of trees, mountains, a more progressive culture, and generally just more…vibes. 🌲☁️

I’m looking for recommendations for cities/towns in WA (or elsewhere in the PNW) that have:
	•	Good hospitals or healthcare networks for job opportunities
	•	A decent cost of living (I’m not expecting cheap, but affordable for a new nurse)
	•	A place where I can actually meet people and make friends (especially in my age range or other young professionals)
	•	LGBTQ+ friendly and inclusive
	•	Bonus if it’s artsy, cozy, or has cool coffee shops and bookstores

I’m not necessarily looking to land in Seattle proper unless that’s really where the jobs/fun are — I’m open to smaller cities or suburbs too. I just don’t want to move from one stifling place to another, y’know?

If anyone else has made a similar move or has suggestions, please drop them below. Advice, warnings, and even “don’t do it”s are all welcome. Thanks in advance!",2,1751284789.0,relocating,0,1.0,False

She seemed genuinely sweet. We’d been talking for a week, laughs, deep chats, even some good morning texts. I actually felt seen for once. And yeah, I know I’m not bad looking. I do well on apps. That part has never been the issue.

But social anxiety... that’s the wall I keep running into.

We met. I smiled. I sat down. And then I started rambling. About random stuff. No flirting, no connection, just nerves disguised as noise. I could feel her energy shift halfway through dinner. I recognized that look  the ""you’re not what I expected"" face. It's quiet, polite, but unmistakable.

This morning, I texted her. Suggested a bookshop and a quiet coffee. No reply. Still none, hours later. I’m still in her city.

It’s crushing. Because I try. I really try.

I've spent years working on myself went from crippling anxiety to holding down a job, learning how to manage conversations, even building enough courage to show up for dates like this. But the results never change. I go home lonelier than I arrived.

I’m almost 30. No real romantic experiences. People say “put yourself out there,” but they never talk about what happens when you do… and it just confirms all the fears you’ve been trying to unlearn.

I don’t know. I’m tired. And sad. And still hopeful somehow, which might be the worst part.

Yesterday I drove for about 4 hours at night with a cracked and dirty front windshield and weak headlights. Before driving, I ate a heavy meal (meat with prunes), drank soda, and had coffee. During the drive, I started seeing cars that weren’t really there or were farther away than they looked, and my vision got blurry and confusing. It felt almost like light hallucinations or visual distortions, and at one point I felt like I completely zoned out.

I saw the headlights of two cars on the opposite side of the road, but because of poor visibility and tiredness, my brain tricked me into thinking it was a single large truck coming straight at me. The lights seemed merged and closer than they really were, so I had to quickly pull over to the right side and stop for a moment to avoid danger.

Has anyone else experienced this? Could the poor windshield and lighting combined with heavy food and caffeine cause this? What can I do to stay safe next time? Any tips are appreciated!

Thanks!

Vincent Williams was the Alpha of Crescent Moon Pack—strong, steady, and absolutely dominant in every trait an Alpha should possess.  
  
On our wedding night, we kissed each other's bodies, breathing in each other's scent and warmth. Then his phone rang. Without a second's hesitation, he answered it and left.  
  
That departure lasted three years. For three whole years, every time we tried to mate, some ""urgent matter"" would conveniently require his immediate attention.  
  
Sitting on that hospital bench, these memories churned through my mind over and over. Suddenly, the past three years felt like nothing more than a ridiculous stage play.  
  
In the end, I returned the Luna ring to his step-sister.  
  
The ring that had always been too tight on my finger fit her perfectly.  
  
I smiled at her. ""Congratulations.""  
  
That night, Vincent came home. His gaze was ice-cold as it fixed on me. ""Where's the Luna ring?""  
  
""You didn't have the guts to do what goes against Pack ethics,"" I replied. ""So I did it for you. Don't mention it.""  
  
Then I tore up our mating contract and walked away without looking back.  
  
I heard that Vincent sat alone until dawn that night, painstakingly piecing together the fragments of our contract, letter by letter, name by name.  
  
But that had nothing to do with me anymore.  
  
When we met again, the once untouchable, noble, and elegant Alpha stood before me with red-rimmed eyes. He held up a moonstone ring, his expression fragile and broken.  
  
""You're my only Luna,"" he whispered. ""My only love. My only mate.""  
  
I pushed away his ring. ""But you're no longer my only anything.""  
  
……  
  
“Miss Sophia… you only have three months left.”  
  
I clutched the test results, my legs going weak. Walking out of the doctor's office, only one thought filled my mind: call Vincent.  
  
The phone rang a few times before he picked up.  
  
""What's wrong?""  
  
His familiar voice nearly broke me. I fought to keep my voice steady. ""I'm at the hospital. I'm not feeling well. Could you come stay with me for a bit?""  
  
“I have urgent business to attend to, so I'll have my beta pick you up.”  
  
I paused, then asked the question I'd never dared voice before. ""What exactly is this urgent business you're always handling?""  
  
He didn't answer. The line went dead.  
  
I stared blankly at my phone screen until tears hit the surface, making me realize I was crying.  
  
After wiping my eyes, I grabbed my bag and walked out of the hospital.  
  
The pain in my body made it impossible for me to wait for his beta to arrive, so I had to take a taxi.  
  
Suddenly, I spotted a familiar Maybach on the electronic screen inside the cab. The car was pulling up in front of Crescent Moon Pack's amusement park.  
  
A live city broadcast was playing:  
  
\[CRESCENT MOON PACK ALPHA LAUNCHES 24-HOUR FIREWORKS DISPLAY TO CELEBRATE LUNA AND PUP'S RETURN TO THE PACK\]  
  
BOOM!  
  
BOOM!  
  
Fireworks bloomed across the night sky, one after another.  
  
The screen filled with comments from Pack residents:  
  
""This is the most perfect couple I've ever seen.""  
  
""That little pup is absolutely adorable.""  
  
Under the fireworks' glow, Vincent wore a black suit, his smile gentle and his eyes overflowing with affection.  
  
Beside him stood a young woman holding a two or three-year-old boy.  
  
Chapter 2  
  
My fingertips turned ice-cold, and my chest felt like it was being torn apart. The pain made it impossible to breathe.  
  
That smile, that tenderness—none of it had ever been meant for me.  
  
I clutched my stomach and crouched down as the pain spread from my body straight to my heart.  
  
So this was it. The marriage I'd been desperately trying to maintain was nothing but a joke.  
  
At one in the morning, the black Maybach pulled into our driveway.  
  
Through the window, I watched him step out of the car. His suit was immaculate, his movements sharp and efficient.  
  
The Alpha's towering frame looked especially imposing in the darkness. His dark hair was perfectly styled, and beneath his sharp brow bone were those deep, ice-cold gray-blue eyes—like a calm lake before a blizzard. His defined nose and lips, firm as sculpted stone, formed that devastatingly handsome face of his.  
  
Every movement radiated a calm, effortless authority—powerful, precise, impossible to ignore.  
  
He opened the door and saw me sitting in the dining room. Surprise flickered across his features.  
  
His gaze swept over me, then landed on the plates of cold food covering the table.  
  
He walked over. ""Were you waiting for me?""  
  
I didn't answer. I just smiled.  
  
My wolf was still trying to joke with me, whispering: Your smile looks worse than crying right now.  
  
In three years, I'd never once fought with him. I'd always played the role of the obedient, perfect Luna.  
  
Whatever he said, I believed. I never asked questions.  
  
But this time, I couldn't pretend I didn't know anymore.  
  
""I heard you left the council chamber this afternoon.""  
  
I kept my tone light, giving him a chance to explain.  
  
""Mm."" He nodded.  
  
""Did you come home alone?""  
  
""Yeah, why?"" His expression remained unchanged, perfectly calm.  
  
""Ran into a friend on the way. Gave her a ride home.""  
  
""I see.""  
  
Friend or lover?  
  
I didn't ask, but my heart sank deeper.  
  
He walked into the kitchen and tied on an apron. ""You haven't eaten yet, have you? I'll make something you like.""  
  
""Okay.""  
  
He stood in the kitchen with his sleeves rolled up to his elbows, the apron casually tied around his waist. The light fell across his profile, soft as a slow-motion scene.  
  
His knife work was unhurried and precise. The spatula moved in steady, gentle rhythms. Every motion carried quiet focus.  
  
When he bent his head to taste the seasoning, his expression turned so tender it didn't match his usual cold Alpha demeanor. It was as if the entire world had softened around this single meal.  
  
I leaned against the doorframe, watching the warmth flow through his features. Suddenly I understood—the most captivating thing about him wasn't his power or his edge. It was this moment, when he showed such gentleness while preparing food just for me.  
  
He cooked quickly and skillfully.  
  
Fifteen minutes later, a steaming plate of steak and ham and cheese pasta appeared before me.  
  
I took a bite. It was delicious, and my mood lifted slightly.  
  
""Amazing! You've gotten even better. Who taught you?""  
  
He smiled. ""During those years in the Northern Territory, I cooked every day—""  
  
He stopped mid-sentence, as if realizing something.  
  
""Every day what?""  
  
""Nothing. Just eat.""  
  
He cut my steak into small pieces as he spoke. ""From now on, I'll only cook for you. How does that sound?""  
  
His eyes were so tender they could have melted me.  
  
Could I trust him again?  
  
He'd said ""I'll love you forever"" before too. I'd believed him. What I got in return was abandonment on our wedding night and countless moments of indifference.  
  
Could I still believe him now?  
  
After my shower, I returned to the bedroom. It was past three in the morning.  
  
He wrapped his arms around me from behind, his large hands gripping my waist as he pulled me tight against him.  
  
His voice was low and strained. ""I want to fuck you.""  
  
Chapter 3  
  
My wolf couldn't resist our mate bond. She grew restless and wild, beyond control. The intense male pheromones surrounded me completely. My hands pressed weakly against his chest as I used the last of my rational mind to try creating distance between us.  
  
""Vincent, don't...""  
  
""Don't?""  
  
Vincent's eyes darkened as he stared at the flush spreading across my earlobes.  
  
I was sensitive.  
  
The slightest touch would paint my entire body in that enticing blush.  
  
Like a delicate flower in full bloom, begging to be played with.  
  
Vincent's Adam's apple bobbed. He roughly pinned me beneath him, his heated kisses raining down.  
  
""Don't talk. Kiss me.""  
  
His nose brushed against my lips as he pried my mouth open, invading and taking control.  
  
My wolf purred contentedly at his scent.  
  
On our wedding night, he'd been just as passionate—until that phone call interrupted everything.  
  
In every encounter since, we'd sit and exchange a few words before he'd rush off again.  
  
Over these three years, aside from my Luna title, all Vincent could offer me was attentive care in daily life and public displays of affection.  
  
Gradually, I'd grown used to this kind of existence.  
  
""Alpha, no...""  
  
My body grew wet under the intoxicating embrace of his scent.  
  
I loved him.  
  
I'd waited three years for this moment. My body's instincts made thinking impossible.  
  
But right now, I had to refuse!  
  
""Hmm?""  
  
Vincent kissed my neck tenderly, saying words that made me blush. ""Your body's welcoming me so eagerly. But you're not?""  
  
""I... my stomach hurts today...""  
  
At my words, something dark flashed in his eyes. He finally stopped.  
  
""What, your period?""  
  
Vincent's voice turned ice-cold, a complete reversal from his earlier passion.  
  
There was subtext in his question. I could hear it.  
  
But I forced a smile anyway. ""No, just an upset stomach.""  
  
""Is it serious? Should we go to the hospital now?""  
  
Vincent sat up calmly, his voice gentle again.  
  
I lowered my lashes, hesitating briefly. Should I tell him what the doctor had said?  
  
In the end, I said nothing.  
  
""It's fine. I already took some medicine.""  
  
I'd always had stomach problems, so he didn't press further.  
  
""Get some sleep then. I'll go take a shower.""  
  
Vincent pressed a soft kiss to my forehead, then turned toward the bathroom.  
  
Ding!  
  
The moment he turned away, I clearly heard the faint notification sound from his phone.  
  
Vincent casually picked up his phone and walked into the bathroom.  
  
But he didn't notice that his laptop on the desk was still glowing.  
  
I opened the message.  
  
""Vincent, are you asleep?""  
  
""Alpha Daddy, I miss you!""  
  
It was that child's voice.  
  
The woman's voice sounded familiar too, though I couldn't place it immediately.  
  
No more texts appeared after that—the call indicator showed it was being answered on another device.  
  
I hesitated for several minutes, then crept to the bathroom door to eavesdrop. But I couldn't make out the words clearly, so I returned to bed.  
  
I could hear occasional water sounds from the bathroom, but not the steady flow of a shower.  
  
I stared at the ceiling, my mind racing.  
  
Vincent didn't come out for a long time. Lost in thought, I eventually drifted off to sleep...  
  
The next morning, I woke drowsily to the aroma of food drifting into the bedroom.  
  
My heart warmed.  
  
Though we'd spent more time apart than together in our three years of marriage, whenever he was home, he always remembered my stomach problems and carefully prepared breakfast for me.  
  
While I was getting ready, the doorbell suddenly rang.  
  
""Vincent, who is it?""  
  
When Vincent didn't respond, I threw on a robe and headed toward the living room.  
  
As I reached the living room, I heard an unfamiliar female voice coming from the kitchen.  
  
I frowned slightly and walked over to find a sweet-faced girl with a killer body hanging intimately on Vincent's arm, acting coquettish.  
  
The commotion at the door interrupted them. Vincent, usually so composed and reserved in public, looked slightly flustered.  
  
""Luna, I'm Thalia Winters. Do you remember me?""  
  
The girl looked completely at ease as she tried to cozy up to me, extending her hand with fake politeness.  
  
Thalia Winters?  
  
I froze.  
  
That was Vincent's step-sister. But hadn't she been living in the Northern Territory all this time?  
  
Vincent's father had died young, and his mother left Crescent Moon Pack to mate with Arthur Winters, the Alpha of Blood Moon Pack. Ever since, Crescent Moon Pack had been under Blood Moon Pack's protection.  
  
I'd heard Vincent mention having a step-sister named Thalia.  
  
But I'd never met her—she hadn't even attended our mating ceremony.  
  
From what I remembered, she apparently didn't like me much.  
  
""Hello, I'm Sophia.""  
  
I nodded politely but didn't shake her hand.  
  
The girl kept chattering. ""Luna, this is my first time at Crescent Moon Pack. Vincent said he's skipping the council chamber today to show me around the territory.""  
  
She playfully stuck out her tongue after speaking.  
  
I stiffened.  
  
I looked at Vincent, silently demanding an explanation.  
  
""She's been at Blood Moon Pack all these years. I thought I'd help her get familiar with our Pack's environment first.""  
  
Vincent seemed worried about upsetting me. As he spoke, he walked over and kissed my forehead.  
  
""I'll go finish cooking. You two chat.""  
  
I forced out a weak smile, nodded casually, then changed the subject.  
  
""You've been here a while and I haven't even offered you anything to drink. What would you like? Coffee or juice?""  
  
""Juice would be great, thank you, Luna!""  
  
Thalia followed me around, gushing. ""Luna, your home is so beautiful! So elegant!""  
  
""Vincent designed it all.""  
  
I kept my back to her, my tone flat.  
  
""Really? So that office with the wet bar in the council chamber—he designed that especially for Luna too? I wondered why they looked so similar!""  
  
Yesterday?  
  
My hand froze while pouring the drink, and my heartbeat skipped.  
  
She'd been here yesterday?  
  
""When did you get back? You should have told us so we could pick you up!""  
  
I tried to sound casual.  
  
""Vincent picked me up yesterday afternoon. What, he didn't mention it to Luna?""  
  
Thalia kept calling me Luna while never addressing Vincent as Alpha, which struck me as odd.  
  
Suddenly, realization hit me. This voice—it sounded like the woman Vincent had been talking to last night!  
  
""He dropped me off at home last night and came up to sit for a while before going back to you. I kept telling him to go home early, but he insisted on staying with me...""  
  
Thalia rambled on, smiling sweetly at me. It seemed innocent enough, but felt like deliberate showing off.  
  
My stomach clenched painfully, and I could barely maintain my smile.  
  
The woman from last night was Thalia?  
  
If she was his sister, why had Vincent hidden this from me?  
  
And why would that child call him ""Alpha Daddy""?

Forever greatful for the support and advice you all gave me on my first post. There is an update for this on my profile as well


This incident occurred about a year ago now, but I still regret it. I, (18F) reported my stepmother (43F) to the police when she threw hot coffee on my sister (15F), then 14yo. 
My parents divorced when I was >5yo, and my dad quickly met a new woman (let's call her Susan) and married her in 2018. They have a son, my half brother (9M) and she brought a kid from her previous marriage as well, my stepbrother (13M). 
In the beginning, Susan was fine. Adjusting to moving in with a guy she had only just met, meeting my sister and I, and adapting to shipping myself, sister and stepbrother to our other parents - who both lived over an hour away from her house. 
Once my dad and her moved closer to my mum, my school, and his work (everyone always has to move for dad's work) they began to rent a house. 
I won't go into the nitty gritty, but she is terrible. She yells at my sister and I, swears at us and dad, throws things, repeatedly tells us how she wishes my dad never met my mother, and tells my sister And I how bad a person my mum is.
Disclaimer: my dad is not perfect. The same yelling and swearing he received is always reciprocated. I believe they would both be happier alone, although I also think every relationship they would have found would end up with their behaviour repeating.
I'll give you a brief list of the thibgs Susan has done over the years:
• sworn at my sis and i
• burnt a picture of my mother infront of us
• thrown containers and crockery at my sister
• looked down my sister's shirt when she saw that she had started wearing training bras (and yelled at her about it)
• pushed my sister
• slammed the door of our room so hard a picture fall on the floor and shattered
• left my sister and I at home for upwards of 2 days alone, while my dad was away, with no note to tell us what to eat or when she would be back (we were 9 and 7)
• driven away before my sister could properly get out of the car when dropping us at our Mum's house, making her jump to get out *she sprained her ankle so badly she couldn't walk)

There are more, but most of them repeat themselves. 

It's been nearly 12 years of this. I was already planning to move out ASAP, and will do so in October this year. But it wasn't really me that she targeted- it was always my sister. 
I'll out it bluntly, I'm the tougher of us. Especially when we were kids. I was a hard core tomboy, took martial arts lessons in school, was more mature (eldest sister syndrome) and didn't learn to hold my tongue until 13ish. 
My sister was not this. She is sweet and gentle, was willing to see the best in people, and trusted everyone. She was the easy target.
She has changed since then. She's become a lot more pessimistic, talks back more, and flips Susan off daily (behind her back).

Last year, when I was 17 l, and my sister was 14, Susan was yelling at us about not taking out the bins. She made some snarky comment and my sister muttered back something. 

Instead of walking away or telling her to mind her tongue, Susan took the coffee she had just made  and threw it on my sister. 

She uses instant so it was 90% water. My sister was wearing a windproof jacket at the time, so her back was mostly saved, although it seeped through the fabric quickly. But thd back of her neck, over her ears, the sides of her face, and her hands (shs had lifted them to take out the bin bag) were covered in the boiling coffee. 

I started screaming at Susan, because I was furious. My sister took off her jacket and was wiping the coffee off her, but her skin was red. 
Susan didn't take her to a hospital because she didn't think it was ""bad enough"". 
She started apologising, but neither of us listened to her. She cleaned my sister's jacket and gave it back to her before she left for school (it was her uniform) and helped her to clean up. 
That night she apologised again, and gave my sister a hug. I didn't let her hug me - my anger had simmered all day while at school and had reached its limit. 
I started thinking about all the things Susan had done over the years, how nothing ever changed, how my dad never did anything meaningful to help, and how my sister, at 14, had no legal ability to do anything. 
I'm not a trusting person. I listen to far too much true crime, have seen too much bad in this world, and known too many backstabbing people to trust freely. You have to earn it, and once lost, it is gone forver. Due to my fascination with crime though, I trust the police. They were the power of the law, and capable of helping.
Side note: teachers in Australia have a duty of care for their students. If they hear or see something that is concerning, they HAVE to report it. My sister had see the school counsellor multiple times, and nothing had happened. So I couldn't go there. I also didn't want to embarrass her infront of her friends.
So I made a report to the police and told them thr whole story I just wrote down above. As soon as I pressed the 'submit button, I regretted it. I realised that Susan - who is Russian - would be looked at differently. I thought of her two kids, and realised that if this went too fat, she could lose custody of them. As much as I hate her, I don't want to take my brothers' mum away from them.
But the police  actually listened to me.
They opened an  investigation, spoke to my family, sister, teachers and everyone. 
Susan was furious, and blamed my sister for it. She denied it, but Susan was still angry.
Susan and dad hid it from me, so did Mt mum, who was notified. 
I still haven't told anyone about it - only my best friend, who wouldn't tell anyone.

The whole thing scared Susan, and she hasn't been too bad since. I think she realised that my sister And I don't forget, and that her actions may have consequences.
But I also scared my sister and brothers. My sister hadn't ever spoken to police before, and now the teachers at our school know something is going on. My brothers thought their mum was going to jail, and my dad (who works for the government) was badly impacted by it.
My sister blamed her best friend for telling the police - she was the only one my sister told. They stopped being friends after that, which still eats me alive.

AITA for doing this? I really scared my whole family, but I also don't regret it. Susan had been nothing but hell for my sister, and I won't forgive her. But I can't help thinking that there were alternatives to the police?
I also feel guilty about not telling anyone. But I'm so scared of what they would say. Please tell me what I should do!

1lo5chp,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1lo5chp/thoughts_after_1_year/,thoughts after 1 year,"so, this time last year i decided to do dry july and quit drinking for a month.  i never considered myself to have a drinking problem, but i was doing it multiple nights a week for no real reason, not social just 3-4 standard drinks chilling at home.  and when i thought about it, i'd actually been drinking almost every week give or take a few dry periods for 30 years, which is a little insane.

the month off turned into 'what about 3 months' and 'what about 6' and pretty easily became a year.  the first week was a little tetchy but after that it became normal quite quickly.  

reading up and watching some youtube videos, seemed full of people who said it was the best decision they ever made and they got healthy and lost weight and etc etc.  personally - a lot more anticlimactic.   i was already active and healthy, didn't experience any mental boost, clarity, etc.  mostly though, it was a relief.  compared to the 'will i / won't i' of trying to moderate it's so much easier just to not bother.  there is no willpower or decision it's just a hard no.

for social occasions non alcoholic beers are great.  and although i didn't put money aside, there is an extra $1500+ i didn't spend over the year.

i don't know if i will continue being fully sober or just limit it to 'occasions' - there were probably 2-3 times in the entire year i felt like i was being a minor bummer by not drinking in social situations and i don't think for me personally there's a big risk of backsliding.  but again it's probably easier to just not bother.  the idea of ingesting what is very obviously a harmful substance for fun is not as appealing as it used to be.

the dreams definitely the weirdest part, looking here it seems it's normal.

all up, easier than quitting smoking (that was a mindfuck for 2 weeks), better than quitting caffeine (tried it for 3 months had no effect whatsoever other than a +5% buff to ambient depression and i love coffee).  definitely recommend.  a new normal is a very worthwhile prize.

“There could be fentanyl in the foam. Mushrooms in the espresso machine. A whole Trump supporting militia in the break room.”
	“You gonna help clean,” Georgia said, sweeping angrily, “or just keep flapping your jaw like an asthmatic beaver?”

I don’t think I can bring the recorder into the briefing which is a bummer, but I’ll give the jist of what our plans are. Also, I probably should mention why I am logging all of this. Prior to our departure, myself and 4 other seamen were chosen to conduct an observation and information gathering operation on the behaviour of the Chinese subs. This information would then be sent back to HQ and be implemented to better understand how to combat their technology, weapon systems, and so on. Besides myself, there is Reynolds, Harper, Richards, and Simmons. Harper being the senior seamen of the five of us. I’m sure I’ll have a better chance to meet Simmons and Reynolds soon, and maybe pick Harper’s brain, get some stories out of him. Richards is already part of my unit so I’d say he and I are already well acquainted. Ooh alright I think it’s time for the briefing, so I’ll be back shortly.”

Positions are to be manned, equipment checked. The standard run-down for an operation of this nature. However, Reynolds, Harper, Richards, Simmons, and myself are being treated as a separate unit, and are being tasked with a different post all together, and it’s not on this ship. The briefing concluded with the captain asking the rest of the crews to leave, while we stayed behind to receive our orders. Don’t get me wrong, I love a good old secret, but I thought we were all in on the same mission here? Anyways, we hung back, and approached the captain. He told us that we’d be getting picked up from the loading bay at 17:30 in a Navy Dinghy boat, and taken to another nearby Navy observation facility that specialises in submersibles. I guess we’re going in subs then? Neat. They didn’t give us too much more to go on besides that, so I guess we'll sit here and wait until tonight.

It’s only 18:15 and it could be midnight for all I know, it's that dark. This place seems to be another branch off of the Navy’s research operation, and while I’ve been told it is, and they say it is, there’s very little US Navy insignias around. The claustrophobic walkways inside the metal hallways are rusted, and dimly lit, but then will have rooms with state of the art tech. I can always hear dripping water and machinery buzzing.

He’s eager to see what it is we’re going to be doing here. As am I. Soon after that Simmons came in too looking worse for wear. He had some coffee and ate what he could stomach. Ironic a guy who has seasickness is in the Navy of all places. Harper broke our conversation as he walked passed dressed in uniform already, and had an energy about him like he’d already been up for hours. What is it about older guys with that? Anyways, getting off topic, he ordered that we make our way down to the briefing room, and to get dressed asap. In the briefing room we were met by three Naval scientists in semi casual scientist gowns? There were another two naval officers in uniform also. 
They explained to us that the task we have been put on will span the next seven days, as they have had updated information from the USS Mcalister of some confirmed Chinese Submarine activity. I got pretty excited and I could see that Reynolds and Richards were too. The man running this operation, Mr Tom Leichman explained how we would be each undergoing different tests such as pressurisation tests, isolation and confinement tests before our individual descents under the ocean to record our findings, and report them back to the team and HQ. They told us that each of us would go down for a period of three hours at a time, and only one person could go down per day due to the restraints of the submersible, and reup times of the other machinery, fuel, and Chinese sub activity.  We were dismissed, and were told that the tests and descents would start this afternoon. So, a lot to take in, but I am eagerly waiting to get started today. I will keep you posted. Tibbets out.”

Entry 8. Day 3
“We went in for our first pressurisation test today just after lunch. We each got to go into this room that was behind a seriously huge bulkhead. The room was fitted to look like the inside of a submarine, however we were told that the sub we would be using was only going to be big enough to house one occupant at a time. So I guess this was just purely a test on us. We climbed into our seats and strapped in. The door was shut, and the metal wheel was spun shut to lock it. A voice over the loudspeakers would inform us on every 100 feet that we went down. When the voice started to read out the initial depths, my body started to feel a bit heavy, but as the pressure was soon adjusted, it was like nothing was different in the slightest. However, when the voice started to read out depths much below that of any operational submarine I know of, I started to feel a bit worried. Just how advanced were these subs? Was the US Navy equipped to handle something that was lurking so deep beneath the surface? Of course with other subs they were, sure, but what sub is operating at the depth of the Titanic? 

After we came out of the pressurisation test, I saw some confused and concerned looks on the faces of the crew. I wonder if they had the same concerns I did. Next up was the isolation test which was to simulate the event of a power outage, or light failure and we’d need to be down there until a recovery crew came. For hours we sat in that room in the complete pitch black. Some of the men, I didn’t see who, started talking to things, or seeing things that weren't there. The brain can do some scary things. Tomorrow will be our first descent for one of the crew, so I’m going to put this away and hit the hay. I’m a bit anxious, but nonetheless excited. Tibbets out.”

Entry 9. Day 4
“Alright! Goodmorning. Today is the day! This is day two onboard the research facility, and today we dive! Well when I say we, I mean just one of us, but as a team this is the start of this operation for us. I can’t tell if the chills I get are from nervousness or excitement. Reynolds is the first to descend today. We’ll all be taking a group photo with him before he dives down. He’s going to head to his pressure and isolation checks shortly after a light breakfast, and no coffee. I think you can guess why. I’ll come back when Reynolds is in the water. Talk shortly.” 

Transmission Ended.


Entry 10. Day 4
“We’re away! Reynolds is in the water and diving down. We got to see the sub he’s going in, and yeah it’s only really just big enough for one person. The front of it is a big steel bathysphere with a porthole window and light fixtures. The rear is in the shape of a fin, and has landers and propellers attached to the side. The whole apparatus however, is connected to a link at the top of the steel dome with an industry grade hook and steel cable which returns to the research facility. I can’t say I’ve seen something like it before. Reynolds seems to be descending quickly which is good, and from what I saw, the submersible is in a stable condition, and we’re receiving good data from it. Only issue is that the subs comms system isn’t functioning, so we can’y directly get in touch with Reynolds, nor can he to us. It will be a few hours now until Reynolds comes back to the surface, so I’ll update then. If anything of importance happens before then I’ll turn this back on. Tibbets out.”

Transmission Ended.


Entry 11. Day 4
“Reynolds has returned to the surface. It’s been hours since we last saw him, and what we saw when we opened the hatch to the sub was nothing I was prepared for. The steel latches are released, the wheel spun and the hatch opened, and the opened hatch let out the loudest and most harrowing screams I have heard. The scientist team went into the docking room with protective uniforms and equipment on to retrieve Reynolds from the craft. His eyes were… His eyes were white, rolled into the back of his head, and his hands… God, his hands. They looked like they were cramped and spasming at the same time trying to grasp at his throat and his head. He was utterly delicious, screaming and shouting. 

 I’d never seen anything like it. About 45 minutes later, the scientist came out from the medic bay and relayed to us what had happened. They claimed that he’d suffered an extremely freak accident where the air in the sub was not properly working as intended, leaving him with brain damage. I’ve never seen someone with brain damage act with that much energy though, usually they’re, well, a vegetable. Looking over at Simmons, he was as white as a ghost. Tomorrow is his turn, and we’ve been assured the sub will be worked on through the night. Let’s hope everything goes smoothly tomorrow. Tibbets out.” 

Transmission Ended..


Entry 12. Day 5.
“Morning. Though I don’t even know who I’m saying that for, but morning nonetheless. Everyone is on edge and pretty anxious today. After yesterday’s mishap, we’ve got every right to be. Reynolds still hasn’t been seen since he entered MedBay. We’ve already been briefed on the upgrades made to the subs capabilities that were worked on overnight, and there were even tests shown to prove it. I think this helped, but Simmons was still pale. Whether that was from seasickness or yesterday's events, I wasn’t sure. After his own pressure and isolation tests were done, it was time for him to climb in, and he did so with shaky hands. Thankfully the comms system has been brought back online so we’ll be able to have an actual line of communication this time. If anything happens during Simmons’ descent, I will record the audio. Tibbets out.”

Entry 13. Day 5.
“We’ve just had some comms come through from Simmons, the screen is displaying the sub at 3500 m below sea level. Let's get this mic on and check in on him. Is that alright Tom?” 

TOM: “Yes, go ahead Joshua.” 

“Perfect. Hey, are you there Simmons?” 

SIMMONS: “H-Hey! Who’s there?” 

“It’s me, Tibbets, Joshua Tibbets. How’s it looking down there?” 

SIMMONS: “Oh! Hey Josh. Yeah uh, man it’s so dark down here. The lights illuminate the few feet in front of me but that’s about it.”

“Okay nice nice, how are you feeling? See any subs down there?” 

SIMMONS: ‘Yeah it uh, it's pretty claustrophobic but im okay. And no, no subs ye-”

“Hey Simmons? Simmons? What's up?” 

SIMMONS: “I - I see… I see… oh.. OH.. OH MY GOD I SEE I-”

“Simmons! What was that noise! Richards what was that bang?! Shit, Shit, bring him up now!”

Entry 14. Day 5.
“We brought the sub back to the surface and recovered Simmons. If what was left of him was even...him. His head, his fucking head. It was split open like a watermelon hit with buckshot. The walls of the sun were coated in blood. I turned away as they brought him out and I couldn’t look. I heard Richards be sick, and Harper let out a disgusted grunt. This is turning into a disaster. I don’t know why the US Navy would hand this team off to a group of scientists and engineers who can’t even put a fucking sub together properly. Especially for a mission as important as this. I don’t think I’ll be able to sleep tonight, and neither will Richards if I had to guess. He will be going down tomorrow. 

Transmission Ended.


Entry 15. Day 6.
“As I thought, I had a pretty sleepless night. I heard screams coming from what I can only assume as the med bay. Some new instructions have been given to us by the team aboard the facility. They told us, “If you start to see movement out of the porthold, use the camera provided to you to capture an Image. If the sub detects that it is being viewed, they may be using some type of weaponry. It may be ultrasonic which we believe is what caused Simmons' death.” So yeah. I’m not sure what to make of all this, however I’m hopeful that using the camera in Richard's descent will give us a better Idea what we’re working with here. I’ll come back when Richards is in the water. Tibbets out.” 

Transmission Ended.


Entry 16. Day 6.
“Richards told me before he got in the sub that this had been shaking up to be the most bizarre operation he’s been on in his 4 years in the Navy, and I don’t disagree. Richards is now making a steady descent and has been making active communication. The team are eagerly awaiting to see what he captures. Tibbets out for now.”

Entry 17. Day 6.
“Okay, we’re back, uh Richards has just told us that he's spotted something. Go ahead Richards, what did you see?” 

RICHARDS: “Uh I’m not too sure, but it seemed big, and it was moving pretty damn fast. I can see it on the sonar getting closer. Okay, okay it's coming near!”

“Close your eyes and snap some photos! We’ll bring you back up right after, okay?!”

RICHARDS: “Okay.. *Click*Click*Click*

Entry 18. Day 6.
“Okay, we’re just pulling Richards back up now and into the docking station, standby… Alright, okay he’s here now. Go ahead and open the hatch!... Oh thank god, Richards!”

RICHARDS: “God am I glad to be back up here, get me out of this thing!” 

“The team is currently helping Richards out of the sub, he’s got the camera in hand, and we’re going to bring it to the viewing station. Standby.” 

Transmission Ended


Entry 19. Day 6.
“We have just reviewed the photos taken by Richards, and we are completely baffled. The camera’s flash caught the inside of the cabin, capturing the sonar with a white dot right in front of the sub. But even with the sub lights on and the camera’s flash, the porthole view is just… black. The closest thing I can think of is that video of a guy taking a photo of a doorway where a ghost was in his house and it's the same, just black. It’s as if something doesn’t want us seeing it like this. The team is going to do their reports and run diagnostics over these photos and the subs data, but it’s late now, and I’m going to head to bed, or do my best to. Tibbetts out.”

“I don’t know what time it is, but it’s still dark out. I… I’ve been hearing screams from MedBay for maybe close to an hour now. They’ve stopped, and now I can hear staggered footsteps about the facility. The footsteps are coming down the hallway now to the dorms… the feet are casting shadows under the door… they’re still walking. Sorry if I’m hard to hear, I have to be very quiet. Oh my god, shit something’s banging on a door. Richards? 

RICHARDS: “Ugh, I’m coming… 

“BANG BANG BANG”

RICHARDS: “What? Who is it?... R- Reynolds… AHHHHHHHHHHH

REYNOLDS: “YOU’VE SEEN IT! YOU’VE SEEN IT! YOU’VE SEEN IT! 

“Oh fuck! Fuck! What the fuck is going on out there…Oh no, oh my… No, no, no! Reynolds is fucking, eating Richards in his door way, he’s just laying there screaming…Someone else is coming!”

TOM: “Mr Harper-” 

HARPER: “Out of my way Tibbets, think you’re getting off this ship that easy? Think again, we’re here to do a job.”

“Yeah we felt that up here. Keep that camera handy on you, I’ll report the speed back to HQ. How fast was it?” 

HARPER: ‘Sonar detected it at… 500 Knots. That’s not possible.” 

“I know, I know. Okay, start taking some photos and we’ll start bringing you up, we don’t want anything to hit you.” 

HARPER: “No!”

Hello and welcome to a brand new week!

Just a quick reminder on how this works: every week, I use my tarot cards (or any other cards I feel called to) to share a collective message from the universe. It’s all about sharing the energy and possibilities that may show up for you this week.

As always, please take what resonates and leave what doesn’t.

Ready…

**Collective message from the universe:**

*“Balance, peace and hope are key themes this week. If you’ve been going through a tough time recently or even if you just feel like you’re constantly on edge, always on the go or unable to rest — then this week brings a gentle reminder: most things in life are temporary and your wellbeing matters.*

*Life can’t always be go-go-go or work-work-work. So, if you’ve been running on empty, it might be time to take a step back, go outside or do something that makes you feel good. Whether it’s for your body, your mind or your soul, a change in environment or a break in routine could do wonders for how you feel and how you see things.*

*There’s also a quiet encouragement this week not to give up — to stay hopeful, to keep believing, to find your way back to optimism. And sometimes that’s hard to do when you’re overwhelmed, stuck in the same surroundings or spending time around people who drain your energy.*

*If life’s been feeling confusing or disjointed, that shift in mindset, environment or company could remind you that actually, you’re okay. Or that you will be soon. Seek out inspiration wherever you can — through visuals, stories, creative projects, new places or anything that helps to light you up inside and opens your mind to new perspectives.*

*Money, work and your overall stability may feel especially important this week. But again: balance is the key. So, this could be the perfect time for a check-in. Take a moment to look at what’s really working and what isn’t. Do the things you’re working towards still align with your bigger vision, your goals, your dream? If not, it might be time to rework the plan. That could mean learning something new, developing your skills further, setting new goals or channelling your energy into something that’s a better fit.*

*Give yourself permission to slow down this week where you can and where you need to. Look after yourself physically, mentally and emotionally. Slowing down doesn’t mean stopping or giving up. It’s about making sure you’re okay, bringing peace and happiness into your days and creating space to really live, thrive and receive all the goodness that’s meant for you. Because when you do these things, you shine brighter and you move through the world as the person you’re here to be.”*

Based on: The Star, Ten of Pentacles and Eight of Pentacles

**Potential Challenge — Seven of Cups:**

Staying grounded and focused could be a challenge this week. You might find yourself full of big dreams or creative ideas, which is beautiful, but it’ll be important to pull those dreams and ideas down to earth and start thinking about how to make them real.

Let yourself hope. Let yourself imagine. But then choose the things that matter most and bring them into focus. What’s realistic? What’s the next step? It could be helpful to set goals, make a plan or ask yourself what it would *actually* take to bring an idea to life.

Paying attention to detail will also be important, especially when it comes to things like decisions, commitments or creative work. Keep your long-term vision in mind. Do your research where needed, ask questions, get second opinions and don’t be afraid to pause if something feels off.

Protect your clarity — steer clear of anything or anyone that clouds your judgment, confuses you or stirs up unnecessary chaos.

**Support — Ten of Cups:**

Support this week comes from connection and emotional fulfilment. So, fill your cup!

Spend time in places that bring you peace — nature, home, your favourite coffee spot, wherever makes you feel most like yourself. Surround yourself with people who lift you up and make you feel seen. Whether that’s your family, partner, friends or chosen community — lean in. Share stories. Listen. Laugh. Be present with people who make life sweeter.

This week is a great time to explore your local area, attend events or simply reconnect with your surroundings. Let yourself be reminded that you’re not alone — that you are part of something bigger, there *is* beauty in the world and there *are* good things and people out there. Let those reminders help bring back your hope and open your heart again.

**Energy in Motion:**

This week’s energy could show up as a desire to really look after yourself — bubble baths, skincare, comfort food, playlists, films you love. You may even decide to journal, create or take intentional time out to rest.

Inspiration could come from a documentary, someone’s story or even from time spent outdoors, at an event, a gallery or a museum. You might even drag a friend or partner along or receive an invite or two, giving you the chance to soak up good conversation and funny moments that remind you how good life can feel in the right company.

You could also find yourself reflecting on your finances, business or career — thinking about what’s working and where things could be improved. There might be a moment of clarity where something clicks and you realise where to focus your time, energy or resources next. It’s not about rushing, it’s about realising what aligns with your growth and getting more intentional about it.

You might also try out a new routine, spend focused time learning something or put real energy into something you care about. Daydreaming is part of it too and you may find that even when your head’s in the clouds, you know how to gently come back down to earth when it matters.

**Affirmation for the Week:** I honour where I’m at. It’s safe to slow down, reset and reconnect — gently and in my own time. I choose peace, clarity and softness over struggle.

Until next week!

Just had a date last night, she seemed really interested and was even open about her own difficulties.

But the entire date was me just rambling, no flirting, and you could see I was different to what she expected. A lot of effort and money goes into my dates and it only ends with me feeling even more depressed. I travelled to another city to see her, met her last night and then this morning while im still here i text her and I haven't even got a reply after asking her out to a bookshop and coffee date. 

Think I have to just accept that I'm awkward and weird, I like to think I have potential but and learn from previous dates, but I never do.

1lo52oc,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1lo52oc/aita_for_leaving_my_friend_in_a_difficult/,AITA for leaving my friend in a difficult position with housing for uni,"I 22F have a friend Rose 22F (not real name) who I lived with in shared housing with others for 2 years. We were best friends and decided to live together again after placement with another friend for final year. 

However I realised only I thought we were friends after I nearly died in a car crash. I re evaluated my life I was in a secondary crash at 50mph and escaped only with whiplash, concussion, loosing a tooth and bruises. A lady in the main crash lost her life and it made me realise I didn't want to die a push over. I messaged her what happened and that I was injured but alive. She never asked again how I was doing and even told our mutual friend I was fine which I was hurt about. This is after what Im about to say.

I then thought about our friendship and realised it soured after I got my work placement before her despite having worse grades than her. My grades are only worse because my mum had cancer in an exam season and I have a trapped nerve which makes exams painfully (I realise this is a petty thing to say). She had always been mean to me when stressed and never organised hanging out with me but it got worse. We both do aeronautical engineering which is incredibly stressful.

I stopped trying and we barely saw each other. I used to organise BBQ, pub visits, and movie nights. We hung out once (I organised because it had been ages) during which two other friends (22M, one of which was the crush) publicly humiliated me for a crush and she was very supportive. I asked him out for a coffee and he said yes but told the other friend he turned me down and kept saying he was busy. I merely wanted an answer so I could move on and didn't put any pressure on him to say yes. The humiliation was him confronting the guy for lying in front of everyone. Some jokes were made and he left me alone at the table with the others to clear up the mess.

Ordering a takeaway and drinking with me because we girlies didnt need men but two days she was telling me to forgive them because they're nice people. She also confronted them at the pub for being AH but then almost immediately afterwards puts me down to keep the peace.

I did forgive them and organised a beach trip with the three of them which I drove and paid for. I wanted to bind with them and ""make up for not hanging out more that year"". They made fun of my car which was an ugly brown with pink wheel trims that I was so proud of as it was my first car. The pink wheel trims honestly was me making the most of a bad job which they made fun of. They left me at the beach on my for hours and then literally asked me if ""I enjoyed my alone time"". I wish I had left them there. It cost me £45 in total and took me 5 hours of driving (a long time in the UK).

I was hurt but still was putting up with it because she is a quiet and hygienic housemate. (I have now realised I did most of organising and chores). She was a good friend at one point. I realise now I was pathetic.

I pulled out of the house group last minute for organising that kind of thing though we hadn't organised anything. Sorry I hadn't organised anything because I had been in a crash. I feel bad because I helped our other friend find another house with mutual friends but I left Rose in a bad spot. I was so done I didn't care at the time. Honestly my other friends I am going to live with are amazingly kind and sweet. 

The way I pulled out was mean too as it was 2 days after her birthday so she read the Im sorry but Im not living with you message before the happy birthday message which my childhood friend (not mentioned in this post but she is a petty and strong queen) thinks is hilarious.

I am a massive stress eater and have lost 3 stone since I changed who I'll live with starting September and have started caring for myself. I also no longer fancy the guy who made fun of me as my standards are no longer in the trash and I don't like cowards.

Sorry its so long but ATIA for backing out last minute even though we had an agreement? She wasn't a bad housemate and only a selfish friend",1,1751282856.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,0,1.0,False

We live about an hour away. I would love some suggestions on where to eat lunch and some dinners around the places we plan to explore. Kids are 4 and 7 and not big eaters. Looking for places that are child-friendly and summer vibes. I love a good sandwich. Cost not a huge factor. Trying to keep most lunch entrees around $15 and dinner about $20, but we can splurge on a couple meals. Does not have to be a sit-down place. In fact, if there's a food truck or cart in the area that serves something amazing, I wanna know. If there really isn't anything decent in the area, I'd rather pack ourselves lunch than eat something overly priced and mediocre.

Day 1: Breakfast @ La Columbe, Independence Hall & Liberty Bell, Lunch @ High Street, Museum of Illusions, Dinner @ Chinese Lantern Festival  
Day 2: Philadelphia Museum of Art, walk along Kelly Drive, Rodin Museum, Roberto Clemente Playground. Thinking dinner at Pizzeria Vetri. Need a lunch suggestion though.  
Day 3: Rival Brother Coffee?, PAFA Museum, Get lunch from Reading Terminal Market and bring it to eat as a picnic in Rittenhouse Square, Dilworth Park, Afternoon snack of pretzel (Pretzel Factory unless someone has better suggestion) and ice cream from 1-900-ICE-CREAM, Puttshack, Dinner @ Fogo de Chao (though I debated between Fogo, Parc, and a.kitchen)  
Day 4: Breakfast @ Middle Child, The Play House @ Music Theatre, Italian Market, Magic Gardens, walk along South Street/around Society Hill? (I'm not really sure what to do here), Dinner @ Angelo's, Phillies game @ Citizens Bank Park  
Day 5: Franklin Square for Storytime and early lunch at SquareBurger, Museum of American Revolution,  Science History Institute (if time), ice cream @ Franklin Fountain, Fireman's Hall Museum. Cherry St Pier - where to eat dinner?

Been stalking this sub for ages but never had the guts to post. I’m a real estate agent in Austin, juggling clients who want market reports yesterday. Copying stuff like addresses, prices, and bed/bath counts from MLS and Zillow into spreadsheets was straight-up soul-crushing. I’d lose hours, and my eyes would blur from staring at tiny text. My techie friend Sarah, who’s always raving about some new app, told me about Thunderbit a few months ago, and I’m kicking myself for not trying it sooner.
It’s this Chrome extension that lets you snag data from websites without being a coding nerd – which I’m definitely not. Last week, I had this client obsessed with downtown condos, and they wanted a full breakdown of listings by Friday. I opened an MLS page, clicked around a bit, and boom, Thunderbit spit out a table with all the details I needed: prices, square footage, the works. Even grabbed some stats from a broker’s PDF, which I thought was gonna be a total pain. Went from a 2-hour slog to maybe 15 minutes, and I had time to grab coffee before my next showing.
I tried Octoparse once, but it was like trying to learn rocket science. I bailed after getting lost in their menus. Thunderbit’s stupidly easy – you just point and click. Only downside is it sometimes pulls in random stuff, like Zillow’s footer links or some ad text, so I gotta delete a few rows. Still way better than my old copy-paste life. It exports to Google Sheets, which is basically my second home.
Anyone else in real estate using something like this to keep their sanity? Or am I the last one to figure this out? Hit me with your favorite tools – my clients are driving me nuts with last-minute data requests.",1,1751282578.0,nocode,0,1.0,False

We got along well and even spent time at each other’s homes, cooking dinner and making desserts together. Physically, we only got as far as holding hands. She seemed uncomfortable going further, so I didn't try to push it.

Later, she moved to another city for a new job. I saw on her TikTok that she was in a relationship. Her posts showed sweet moments with her boyfriend, and I accepted that we were just a small chapter in each other’s lives.

Today, I happened to visit her TikTok page again. It looks like she’s moved back to our city. All the couple content has been deleted, so I assume she might be single now.

At the same time, I’ve been chatting with someone new. We’ve only gone on one date so far, which included dinner and coffee. She seems kind and easy to talk to, and I think there’s a chance for something to grow between us.

Now I’m not sure what to do.

**Option A:** Reach out to the old flame and see if there’s still a connection. If something starts to develop, politely step away from the new person I’m getting to know.

**Option B:** Let the past stay in the past. We both made choices before. It might be better to keep exploring things with the new woman and see where it leads.

Chapter 1



On our wedding anniversary, my husband insisted on inviting his entire crew of friends to celebrate with us. Among them was a female ""bro"" I'd never seen before.



The moment she walked in, she plopped down directly on my husband's lap and starting a video call: ""Mom, I made it! Your godson is sitting right next to me.""



Then she turned and pressed her face close to his, practically nuzzling him: ""Well, Knox, if you ever treat me badly, I'll have both our families beat you up!""



Crack!



The glass I was holding slipped from my fingers, shattering on the floor.



In an instant, everyone's eyes were on me.



His female ""bro"" just arched one eyebrow:



""Hey, I was just joking around. You're not bothered by that, are you?""



The private room fell silent instantly—you could hear a pin drop.



I instinctively looked at Knox.



He just smiled and playfully tapped Piper's head, his tone affectionate: ""Today's my wedding anniversary with my wife. Don't be so wild.""



She pouted flirtatiously, naturally wrapping her arms around his neck: ""Fine. Since you're throwing this welcome-home party for me, I'll give you that much.""



By then, a server came in to clean up the broken glass and handed me a new cup.



Someone took the opportunity to ease the tension: ""Don't mind her, Riley. Piper's always been carefree—she doesn't mean any harm.""



I remained silent.



Piper glanced at me dismissively: ""Don't tell me you're actually this petty?""



After that, she released her hold on Knox and hopped off his lap: ""Guess I better keep my distance from you, Knox. So wifey doesn't throw a fit when you get home.""



Then she shook her head with a dramatic sigh, teasing the group of guys: ""Now you see why I don't hang out with women?""



""So damn dramatic and sensitive. It's exhausting.""



Nobody picked up her comment, and the atmosphere turned awkward.



Someone hesitantly spoke up: ""Piper, it's their anniversary today, maybe tone it down a bit...""



Suddenly Piper covered her mouth in mock realization: ""Oh my god, I almost forgot! I brought a gift!""



Then she pulled out a velvet jewelry box from her purse and presented it to Knox like a prized treasure: ""Ta-da!""



When she opened the box, inside lay a pair of gleaming gemstone cufflinks—men's cufflinks.



Someone politely gasped in admiration.



Knox smiled. ""You came all the way back home—I should be the one giving you gifts.""



Hearing this, Piper gave him a coy look and reached over to fasten them on his wrists.



As she moved, matching cufflinks on her own sleeves caught the light brilliantly.



""Hmph, I picked these out especially for you. You better appreciate them.""



Some people had already begun secretly glancing at my expression, but I just took a deep breath, my clenched fingers leaving crescent-shaped marks on my palm.



Then I stood up.



Knox frowned. ""Where are you going?""



I forced a smile. ""To book you two a hotel room.""



""Otherwise I'm afraid you'll do it right here.""



The moment I finished speaking, Piper violently smashed the empty jewelry box in her hand onto the floor.



She cursed loudly: ""What's fucking wrong with this chick?""



""I told you guys we should've just hung out with the bros.""



""Now she's completely ruined the mood!""



Knox chased after me, his tone urgent: ""Babe, Piper doesn't mean anything by it.""



""They're just cufflinks. She's always been casual like this—don't take it personally.""



""And what you said back there was way out of line...""



I gave him a cold smile. ""So the real reason you invited all your friends today was to celebrate your childhood sweetheart coming home, right?""



Knox shifted uncomfortably, avoiding my eyes. ""Why are you making such a big deal out of this?""



""Besides, our anniversaries are always just the two of us—that gets a bit dull.""



""I thought inviting more people would make it more fun.""



Seeing my expression darken, Knox grabbed my hand, his tone softening unusually: ""Babe, don't overthink this. Piper and I have known each other for years—if something was going to happen between us, it would have already.""



""And look, I chose to be with you, didn't I?""



I nearly laughed from anger: ""I'm so sorry for taking your childhood sweetheart's place.""



""Fine, I'll step aside.""



Knox's face flushed red as he yanked his hand away, his tone hardening: ""What are you talking about? You know that's not what I meant.""



""Riley, you're being completely unreasonable!""



With that, he stormed off without looking back.



But his footsteps gradually slowed. I knew he was waiting for me to compromise and follow him, just like I always had before.



I frowned, turned around and walked away.



This man is truly disgusting!



Chapter 2



Knox came home at three in the morning.



He was completely wasted, clothes disheveled, reeking of alcohol, stumbling as he tried to embrace me.



I frowned and dodged him, but he caught my wrist.



Next second, his boozy breath hit my face: ""Happy anniversary, babe. Look what I got you.""



He pulled a jewelry box from his pocket and opened it in front of me—it was the Graff Diamonds jewelry set I'd been eyeing for months.



But my eyes quickly fell on the two empty spots in the box.



Knox scratched his head sheepishly: ""Piper accidentally saw it, and she really liked the bracelet and ring. She insisted on taking them.""



""I figured you already have plenty of bracelets and rings, so I let her have them...""



When I didn't take it, he tried to force the box into my hands, his tone reassuring: ""Babe, don't be mad. If you really want them, I'll buy you another set, okay?""



Yet I just stepped back, letting the jewelry box clatter to the floor.



Knox paused, pressed his lips together to control his temper, then forced a smile: ""Babe, I was wrong today. I'm sorry.""



""I shouldn't have invited so many people on our anniversary. But look what I got!""



With that, he pulled out a small cherry cake from behind his back.



I stared at the cake, memories flooding back...



The day we got together, he had given me a cherry cake too.



Since then, we'd promised to celebrate every important occasion with cherry cake.



In that moment, fragments of everything we'd experienced together over the years flashed before my eyes.



I sighed and finally accepted it.



Fine. I'll forgive him one last time.



Seeing me unwrap the cake, Knox's face lit up with a huge smile.



As he fed me a bite, he cautiously began: ""Babe, Piper just got back and hasn't found an apartment yet...""



""She wants to stay with us for a few days. Is that okay?""



""She promised she won't cause you any trouble!""



The sickly sweet taste in my mouth suddenly made me nauseous.



I rushed to the bathroom and couldn't help throwing up.



Knox followed anxiously, patting my back: ""What's wrong? Babe.""



I forcibly pushed his hand away, went to the table and smashed everything on it.



I looked at him, my eyes red: ""Yes, she can stay!



""I'll go!""



Knox's expression instantly changed, his voice rising: ""What are you making a scene about now? I told you it's temporary! You're walking out over something this trivial?""



His contorted face reflected in my eyes, but this time, the light in my eyes had completely extinguished.



I shook my head and forced a bleak smile: ""Let's get divorced.""



Knox clearly hadn't expected me to say that.



He exploded with rage, violently kicking over the coffee table:



""Riley, are you fucking mental? You're really pushing it!""



Chapter 3



I locked myself in the master bedroom.



When Knox finished his shower and found the door wouldn't open, he pounded on it furiously before slinking off to the guest room.



The next morning, he sat at the breakfast table with a cold expression. The table was set with an elaborate breakfast.



I snickered.



Playing the silent treatment card? How pathetic.



I just gave him a cold glance and walked expressionlessly toward the front door.



Knox couldn't take it anymore: ""Riley, don't be so goddamn ungrateful!""



""You were wrong yesterday too. You shouldn't throw around divorce as an empty threat.""



Without looking back, I replied flatly: ""I'm serious. Start preparing for it.""



After I closed the door, I heard dishes shattering inside.



...



By the time I reached the office, my emotions had completely settled.



My work efficiency remained as high as ever. Almost no one could tell I was having relationship troubles.



During a meeting, my boss announced: ""We have an international order that requires someone to travel to British for a month.""



""If anyone's interested, contact me. The company will cover all expenses, plus a travel allowance.""



At that moment, messages from Knox popped up one after another on my phone screen. I irritably turned off the phone and said loudly: ""I can go.""



After the meeting, a close colleague stopped me, sounding puzzled: ""Riley, what about your husband while you're gone for a month?""



I replied nonchalantly: ""Oh, he has his childhood sweetheart to keep him company. He won't be lonely.""



Hearing my words, my colleague realized they'd said something wrong and awkwardly shut up.



When I got home that evening, I found an unfamiliar suitcase in the entryway.



Bright pink, covered with random stickers.



I took off my heels only to discover someone had taken my house slippers.



My expression darkened immediately.



Walking barefoot a few steps forward, I heard flirtatious laughter: ""Wow, Knox! Your cooking has really improved since I last saw you!""



Piper was wearing my cherry slippers, eating with oil dripping down her chin.



In her hands were clearly my plate and fork.



Seeing me approach, Piper seemed startled: ""Oh! shit, how do you walk so silently? You could've said something—you just scared me!""



""Knox, you're even more jumpy than I am. Must be rough getting scared by your wife every day, huh?""



Without wasting a single word, I stepped forward and slapped her across the face twice, hard and loud.



Then I threw the dishes on the table to the floor.



Piper was stunned by the slaps at first, then immediately exploded: ""You fucking bitch! You dare hit me?!""



Knox heard the commotion and rushed out from the kitchen, grabbing the raging Piper.



She twisted in his arms: ""Knox, did you see that? Has your wife lost her mind? She hit me the second she walked in!""



""How can you stand this psycho? Why are you holding me back? Hit her back for me!""



Knox's face darkened as he yelled at me: ""Riley, what the hell is wrong with you? Apologize right now!""



I curled my lips into a smile: ""Oh, I'm so sorry. I couldn't see clearly.""



""I just saw some woman wearing my slippers, using my dishes—I thought she was a thief.""



Piper's face flushed red, looking somewhat guilty: ""I didn't know they were yours...""



But she was obviously lying.



I love cherries—almost everything of mine at home has a cherry symbol on it. If she accidentally wore my slippers, that would be understandable, but to also use my plates, my forks? Too many coincidences? Only a fool would believe she wasn't doing it deliberately.



Seeing that I'd apologized, her expression changed.



She nestled softly in Knox's arms, showing her reddened cheek and tearful eyes: ""I'm sorry, Riley. Even if it was an accident, I shouldn't have touched your things...""



I raised an eyebrow.



Well, well. A professional damsel in distress.



But Knox was clearly falling for it.



He soothingly patted Piper's shoulder, then frowned at me: ""Riley, you've really gone too far this time.""



Then he helped Piper to the guest room to treat her face.

1lo4wjc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1lo4wjc/i_felt_and_saw_her_grandfather_hed_been_dead_for/,"I felt and saw her grandfather, he'd been dead for nearly a year.","
A number of years ago, I was dating a girl long distance. She lived in a pretty remote part of the U.S., having grown up on reservation land before moving away as an adult. Her grandparents had stayed behind, and she would constantly go back to visit them, making the long drive out to her small hometown. She told me that her grandfather had died shortly before we started chatting, but I had no idea what I was about to uncover when I first came to visit her.

When I arrived, she invited me to go see her grandmother and make the drive back to her hometown. She mentioned that her grandmother had been struggling recently after her grandfather's death and was having a hard time adapting to life alone. The property was pretty isolated, and the town itself had maybe 300 to 400 people, mostly older folks who had lived there all their lives. Even the local McDonald’s still had that early '90s vibe. It kind of felt like stepping back into my childhood.

Her grandmother was a sweet and lovely woman. She invited us inside and showed us the fold-out couch bed we'd be staying on. We chatted about the weather, local news, and things like that. She mentioned how her husband would normally be out farming this time of year and that whenever she saw a combine go by, she’d think it was him. She got pretty emotional and went outside to do some yard work.

My ex showed me around the house, and eventually we came to a room that just felt off. There was a reclining chair in the center of the room, and something about its placement felt strange. It gave off a weird energy and made me feel incredibly sad and uncomfortable for some reason. I mentioned this to my ex, and she went slightly pale.

She told me that it had been her grandfather’s favorite chair, and that he had committed suicide there with a shotgun, shooting himself point-blank in the chest after being diagnosed with leukemia. Her grandmother had the chair professionally cleaned afterward but kept it, since it had been his favorite place to relax after a long day of farming.

We saw the rest of the house and eventually had dinner. Her grandmother was an early riser and went to bed around 9 p.m. Over dinner, she told stories about how her husband used to call the animals by name, and they’d always come running. Horse, cow, pig, even chickens. It didn’t matter; they all knew their names and clearly loved him a lot.

She said he’d be up every morning at 5 a.m., walking down the long hallway to put his boots on and go out the side door to start his day. He would do odd jobs, care for the animals, and keep the property in order. Even though he’d been gone for nearly a year, she still followed the same routine. She would wake up around the same time to greet him, start the coffee, and have a little chat before his day would have begun.

The living room couch we were sleeping on was right next to that long hallway and the side door leading to the backyard. We decided to call it an early night. I took the side of the bed that faced down the hallway and the door to outside.

I’m a pretty light sleeper, especially in unfamiliar places, and I ended up waking sometime around 4 a.m. I had brought a book with me, since this was before the time of constant internet and cell phones, so I sat up gently while my ex slept beside me and started reading a book I had brought along.

That’s when I saw something.

Out of the corner of my eye, down the long hallway, I saw a dark shadow. It slowly walked down the hall toward me. I immediately stiffened, dropped my book on the bed, and pulled the covers over my head, unsure of what I had just seen or if I had even really seen it.

After a few moments, I peeked out from under the blanket and saw the dark mass walk right past the bed and go through the side door into the backyard.

Shaken, I immediately woke up my girlfriend and told her what I had seen. She was pretty shocked and thought maybe I had just been dreaming. But I had been fully awake for at least 15 minutes before it happened, and to this day I like to believe it was just her grandfather, on his way to feed the animals, tend to the property, and make sure everything was in order.

I hope he's at peace, wherever he is. This is one of those strange stories I don't often share, because most people would probably think I’m crazy but I had decided to share it while sitting at an airport terminal waiting to board my flight.",0,1751282292.0,Paranormal,1,0.5,False

Scarlett Devereaux was renowned in elite circles as the ultimate seductress, with her perfectly curved red lips and those captivating cat-like eyes that could seduce anyone with just a glance.  
  
While Jackson Blackwell was the epitome of the perfect heir of high society—untouchable, disciplined, and maddeningly self-controlled.  
  
No one would've guessed that these two polar opposites secretly tangled in heated passion in the back of his Maybach at midnight, desperately devoured each other in charity gala bathrooms, or that he'd grip her waist against his vineyard's floor-to-ceiling windows until her legs gave out beneath her.  
  
After yet another night of abandon, the shower's gentle patter filled the bathroom.  
  
Scarlett lounged against the headboard, dialing her father's number:  
  
""I'll marry that dying Miami heir for the fortune, but I have one condition..."" she said coolly.  
  
Her father's voice crackled with barely contained excitement. ""Name it! Whatever you want. If you're willing to marry him, I'll give you anything!""  
  
""Let's discuss it when I get home."" Her voice was soft, but her eyes remained cold and calculating.  
  
Scarlett hung up and was about to dress when she noticed Jackson's laptop sitting nearby.  
  
The Instagram was open, showing a message from someone labeled ""Lily.""  
  
\[Jackson, there's a thunderstorm. I'm so scared...\]  
  
Scarlett's fingers trembled slightly.  
  
Just then, the bathroom door suddenly swung open as Jackson emerged, water droplets trailing down his collarbone. His shirt hung open at the top, two buttons undone, lending his typically austere appearance a hint of sensuality.  
  
""Something came up at the office. I need to go,"" he said, reaching for his jacket, his voice maintaining its usual coolness.  
  
Scarlett curved her lips into a smile. ""Off to the office, or running to your precious soulmate?""  
  
Jackson looked confused. ""What?""  
  
""Nothing,"" she replied, sliding barefoot from the bed, her pale feet sinking into the plush carpet.  
  
His eyes darkened as he caught her chin between his thumb and forefinger, tracing her swollen lips. ""Be good. Don't cause trouble.""  
  
As the door closed behind him, Scarlett's smile vanished instantly.  
  
She called a car and followed him.  
  
Half an hour later, the car stopped outside a hotel. Through the rain-streaked window, Scarlett watched as Lily Bennett, dressed in a flowing white dress, ran out from the hotel entrance.  
  
Jackson strode forward, removing his suit jacket and draping it over her shoulders before sweeping her into his arms.  
  
""It's freezing out here. How could you come outside without a coat, hmm?"" he chided gently.  
  
His movements were so practiced, so natural, as if he'd done this a thousand times before.  
  
Scarlett clutched the door handle until her nails dug painfully into her palm.  
  
As she watched Jackson carefully carrying Lily into the hotel, she suddenly recalled the first time they'd met.  
  
Back then, she'd been fighting bitterly with her father, had actually cracked his skull open during one particularly vicious argument. He'd shipped her off to his best friend's son for ""discipline,"" claiming his rebellious princess needed her sharp edges smoothed out.  
  
When they first met, Jackson was sitting in his penthouse office at Blackwell Industries, his gaze icy cold behind those gold-rimmed glasses.  
  
She was determined not to stay.  
  
So she constantly made trouble.  
  
On her first day, she spilled coffee all over his custom Italian suit worth hundreds of thousands. Yet Jackson merely gave her a passing glance: ""Italian cashmere, air-shipped yesterday. Put it on the Devereaux account.""  
  
On the second day, she deliberately threw important meeting documents into the shredder. Jackson didn't flinch, reciting the entire contents from memory, leaving the executive board stunned into silence.  
  
On the third day, she drugged his coffee and set up cameras, planning to capture embarrassing footage she could use to blackmail him.  
  
Instead, she became his remedy.  
  
When she woke the next morning, her entire body ached. Furious enough to commit murder, Scarlett found herself pinned against the floor-to-ceiling windows for another round.  
  
""Scarlett,"" he whispered against her ear, his voice husky with desire, ""be good.""  
  
Just that simple endearment—""Scarlett""—shattered her defenses.  
  
No one had called her that so tenderly since her mother died.  
  
From that day forward, their relationship transformed entirely.  
  
Every time she acted out, Jackson would simply haul her into his office. Everyone assumed he was scolding her, when in reality he was bending her over his desk until her legs gave out.  
  
Gradually, Scarlett realized she'd become addicted.  
  
Was it his expertise? Or was she just that lonely?  
  
She couldn't tell.  
  
All she knew was that she'd fallen. Hard.  
  
So on his birthday, she spent the entire day decorating his villa—roses, candles, music… She'd even bought an engagement ring.  
  
But Scarlett waited the entire night, watched the candles burn down and the roses wilt, and still he never showed up.  
  
Until three in the morning, when her phone suddenly pinged with a breaking news alert—  
  
\#Billionaire CEO Picks Up Childhood Sweetheart at Airport#  
  
The photo showed Jackson carefully helping a girl in a white dress into his car, looking at her with unbearable tenderness.  
  
The comment section exploded:  
  
""OMG! The CEO and his innocent princess! I'm DYING over here!""  
  
""Holy shit! Isn't that Jackson Blackwell and Lily Bennett from Kingston Prep? They were THE couple back in the day!""  
  
""I went to school with them and can confirm! Mr. Blackwell was ice-cold to everyone except Lily! If she hadn't gotten sick and gone abroad for treatment, they'd be married by now for sure!""  
  
Thud!  
  
The phone slipped from her fingers and clattered to the floor.  
  
Scarlett couldn't believe her eyes.  
  
If Jackson already had someone in his heart, what was she? Just a convenient fuck whenever he wanted?  
  
Trembling, she called Jackson's number, desperate for an explanation, but her calls went straight to voicemail.  
  
After the final failed attempt, Scarlett set down her phone and walked into Jackson's study—a room he'd explicitly forbidden her to enter.  
  
When she pushed the door open, it felt like she'd been struck by lightning.  
  
The room was filled with photos of Lily—graduation photos, vacation snapshots, even candid pictures of Lily sleeping.  
  
The always-composed, always-controlled Jackson Blackwell had done something so... obsessive.  
  
Any need for answers evaporated.  
  
Scarlett started laughing, the sound unnaturally harsh in the empty room.  
  
As she laughed, hot tears spilled down her cheeks, dropping onto the hardwood floor.  
  
Red-eyed, she destroyed the entire villa.  
  
When Jackson returned the next day and saw the devastation, he simply called for cleaning staff.  
  
He didn't even spare her a second glance, as if her behavior was precisely what he expected.  
  
Scarlett watched in silence as the maid swept away the engagement ring box with the rest of the debris.  
  
He had no idea what had been inside.  
  
No idea that she had wanted to spend her life with him.  
  
No idea that when that ring hit the bottom of the trash can, she decided she would never love him again.  
  
""Miss, where would you like to go?"" The driver's voice pulled her back to reality.  
  
""Home,"" Scarlett said, opening her eyes, her voice cold. ""Take me back to the Devereaux estate.""  
  
Upon arriving at the Devereaux mansion, her father immediately rushed to greet her. ""Scarlett, you're really willing to marry into Miami?""  
  
From the staircase, her stepmother watched expectantly.  
  
""Yes,"" Scarlett replied, her eyes turning frosty. ""But I mentioned a condition, didn't I?""  
  
""What is it? Name it!""  
  
""I want to…"" Scarlett enunciated each word clearly, ""sever all ties with you as father and daughter.""  
  
The air suddenly felt thick and unbreathable.  
  
Her father's face contorted with rage. ""Have you lost your mind? Do you even know what you're saying?""  
  
""Perfectly clear,"" Scarlett's voice was ice-cold. ""You cheated while married. To make room for this homewrecker,"" she gestured toward her stepmother, ""you drove my mother to jump to her death. From that day on, I stopped considering you my father.""  
  
She stared at her father's ashen face. ""Now Miami's dying heir is offering five hundred million for a bride to bring him luck, and you've been pressuring me for three months. If I didn't agree, were you planning to drug me and drag me there?""  
  
""If that's how it is, what difference does it make if we're legally related or not?"" She smirked cruelly. ""You can bring your mistress's daughter home and make her the Devereaux princess instead.""  
  
Her father trembled with fury. ""Fine! We'll sever ties! But that Miami heir reportedly won't make it to the end of the month. You MUST marry him before then!""  
  
He laughed coldly. ""As for your stepsister, she just returned from abroad a few days ago and has been staying at a hotel. Since you're so willing to step aside, she'll move in tomorrow!""  
  
Scarlett laughed bitterly, her heart aching. ""Rushing to raise another woman's daughter while rejecting your own. You really are one of a kind.""  
  
She turned to leave, but her stepmother, Victoria, blocked her path with fake concern. ""Scarlett, how can you speak to your father this way?""  
  
Scarlett stopped dead.  
  
She slowly turned, her eyes blazing with years of suppressed hatred. ""What's wrong? Feeling like you can finally act the part of the lady of the house now that I'm leaving? Let me make something crystal clear, Victoria Bennett.""  
  
She advanced step by step. ""Even with my mother dead, nothing changes the fact that you're just a homewrecker that everyone despises! Even if your precious daughter becomes the Devereaux princess, she'll never escape the stain of having a mother who's nothing but a cheap mistress!""  
  
Victoria's face turned deathly pale as she stumbled backward.  
  
Scarlett stormed away, each step feeling like walking on broken glass.  
  
Only when she reached her room and closed the door did she slide to the floor as if all her strength had been drained, burying her face deep in her knees.  
  
The next morning, the sounds of moving and laughter woke her.  
  
""What's going on?"" She flung her door open. ""Can't a person get some fucking sleep around here?""  
  
The housekeeper stammered: ""Miss Devereaux... your stepsister has moved in...""  
  
Before he could finish, a familiar figure appeared at the staircase—  
  
Lily Bennett, wearing a white sundress, stood there looking delicate and vulnerable.  
  
Scarlett's blood instantly turned to ice!  
  
Chapter 2  
  
Scarlett could never have imagined that her stepmother's daughter, who had been ""recovering abroad"" for years, would turn out to be Jackson's precious Lily.  
  
Life had just handed her the cruelest joke imaginable.  
  
A moment later, Lily approached her with a sweet smile. ""Sister, I'm so sorry I disturbed your sleep...""  
  
Before she could finish, Scarlett slammed the door shut with a thunderous bang.  
  
""Scarlett! Where are your manners?!"" Her father roared from outside. ""Clear out your room! If Lily likes it, this will be her bedroom from now on!""  
  
Scarlett laughed bitterly, immediately starting to pack her suitcases.  
  
Outside, she could hear fragments of conversation—  
  
""Uncle Richard, is Scarlett angry?"" Lily's voice was soft as honey.  
  
""Don't worry about her. She's been spoiled rotten since childhood.""  
  
""But...""  
  
""Don't worry, she'll be married off to Miami soon. After that, this house will belong to you and your mother.""  
  
Scarlett's hand paused momentarily before she smirked even more darkly.  
  
She quickly booked an end-of-month flight to Miami and continued packing.  
  
Half an hour later, she wheeled her luggage out of the room.  
  
In the living room, her father, Victoria, and Lily sat on the sofa watching TV, fruit and pastries arranged on the coffee table, looking every bit the picture-perfect family.  
  
Scarlett walked straight toward the door without a glance in their direction.  
  
""Stop right there!"" her father commanded. ""What are you doing now? Don't forget what you promised!""  
  
""Don't worry, I always keep my word,"" Scarlett replied without turning around. ""But for these next two weeks, I'd rather not stay somewhere that makes me sick to my stomach.""  
  
She checked into the Presidential Suite at The Langham, Boston's most expensive hotel and embarked on a shopping spree of epic proportions.  
  
She bought the most exquisite wedding dress, bid millions at auctions for antique jewelry to serve as her dowry.  
  
Even if she was just a ""lucky charm"" bride, she would arrive in Miami like a queen.  
  
Her phone buzzed relentlessly in her bag. Scarlett only checked it after purchasing her final diamond necklace.  
  
Thirty-eight missed calls, all from her father.  
  
She had barely swiped to answer when his furious voice exploded through the speaker: ""Have you lost your fucking mind?! You've blown through thirty million in ONE DAY! Are you trying to bankrupt me?!""  
  
""What's the rush?"" Scarlett laughed coldly. ""Once I'm married, you'll have five hundred million coming your way.""  
  
""But that money hasn't arrived yet! If you keep spending like this, the company will declare bankruptcy tomorrow!""  
  
Scarlett's smile turned vicious.  
  
That was exactly what she wanted.  
  
The five hundred million? She'd already planned to have it transferred directly to her personal account after the wedding.  
  
She wanted to see if Lily and her gold-digging mother would still cling so desperately to a broke old man once the money disappeared.  
  
Did they really think everyone was as foolish as her mother? The woman who had stood by her father while he built his empire from nothing, who worked herself into the hospital with stress, only to be driven to suicide in the end?  
  
Thinking of her mother, Scarlett's heart contracted painfully.  
  
Her phone vibrated again with a text from Jackson: \[What's got you in a mood this time? Why didn't you come to the office today?\]  
  
Scarlett stared at the message for a long time.  
  
For the past year, under the guise of Jackson ""disciplining"" her, she'd reported to his office almost daily.  
  
But now that she was about to marry someone else, what was there left for him to discipline?  
  
When she returned to the hotel carrying over a dozen shopping bags, she found her luggage piled unceremoniously in the lobby.  
  
""What the hell is going on?"" she demanded coldly.  
  
The receptionist looked uncomfortable. ""Miss Devereaux, your card... was declined. According to hotel policy...""  
  
Just then, her phone buzzed with a message from her father: \[If you want to sever ties, stop using my money. I've frozen all your accounts.\]  
  
Scarlett stared at the screen for a long time, until her eyes burned.  
  
Finally, she replied with just two words: \[Fine then.\]  
  
Scarlett then dragged her suitcase down the street.  
  
Her flight wasn't until the end of the month, and now she had nowhere to go. Where would she sleep? What would she eat? How would she survive?  
  
Her suitcase was full of wedding dresses and dowry items she couldn't sell. As for borrowing money...  
  
She'd rather sleep on the street than beg from those vultures in her social circle who were waiting to see her fall.  
  
She had just settled on a park bench when a drunk man staggered over.  
  
""Hey beautiful, all alone?"" he slurred.  
  
""Get lost!"" she snapped.  
  
""Don't be like that, sweetie. Keep me company for a while...""  
  
The moment his greasy hand touched her shoulder, Scarlett raised her hand to slap him.  
  
""ARGH!""  
  
Jackson had appeared out of nowhere, viciously twisting the man's wrist.  
  
Before Scarlett could react, she found herself and her luggage bundled into his car.  
  
""Let me go!"" she protested.  
  
Jackson gripped her flailing wrist. ""What drama are you causing now?""  
  
His voice deepened. ""Homeless, and you still wouldn't come to me?""  
  
Chapter 3  
  
Those words made Scarlett's nose sting with unexpected emotion.  
  
In the past, whenever she'd fight with her father and run away, Jackson would drive around the entire Boston looking for her, then carry her back home on his back.  
  
""What drama are you causing now?"" He would always ask in that same tone.  
  
She would cling to his back, breathing in the crisp scent of cedar that always surrounded him, naively believing that perhaps he cared for her, even a little.  
  
But now she realized no one was more manipulative than him!  
  
He clearly didn't have feelings for her, yet he slept with her anyway.  
  
Then he'd return to his study to moon over Lily's photographs.  
  
She couldn't understand why she wasn't enough compared to Lily.  
  
In terms of family background, beauty, figure—how was she inferior?  
  
Why, of all people, did he have to fall for Lily? Specifically Lily?  
  
""Let GO!"" Scarlett's eyes welled up as she bit Jackson's hand hard.  
  
He frowned slightly but said nothing, simply starting the car.  
  
Jackson drove back to his estate, carrying her luggage inside without hesitation.  
  
""Same as before,"" he said, unbuttoning his cuffs, his tone leaving no room for argument. ""Stay until you're ready to go home.""  
  
Scarlett stood in the entryway, her fingernails digging into her palms. ""I'll only stay for two weeks. After that, I'm leaving this place forever. I'll pay you rent, and I won't bother you anymore.""  
  
""Won't bother me anymore?"" Jackson slowly raised his eyes to look at her, his gaze unfathomable behind those gold-rimmed glasses. ""Are you sure you can manage that?""  
  
Those words cut into her heart like a knife. Scarlett's chest constricted painfully.  
  
So he had known all along.  
  
He'd seen how she'd transformed from initial hostility to complete devotion.  
  
She was hopelessly in love with him.  
  
But what about him? He kept his heart fixated on Lily while coldly watching Scarlett fall deeper and deeper?  
  
""Lily..."" Scarlett suddenly spoke up, ""is my stepmother's daughter. Did you know that?""  
  
Jackson paused in the middle of removing his tie. ""I found out today.""  
  
After a moment of silence, Scarlett couldn't help asking: ""What exactly is your relationship with her?""  
  
""We were at school together,"" Jackson poured himself a glass of water and took a deliberate sip. ""Same university. We worked on the student council together. She saved me during a car accident once, then her health deteriorated and she's been recovering abroad ever since.""  
  
With that, he looked directly at Scarlett, his eyes containing a warning. ""I know you have issues with your stepmother, but this has nothing to do with Lily. Don't target her.""  
  
All the words Scarlett wanted to say became stuck in her throat.  
  
She had planned to ask ""Do you love her?"" but now it seemed laughable.  
  
Seeing how protective he was, what was left to ask?  
  
She turned and retreated to the guest room, slamming the door behind her.  
  
That night, for the first time ever, Jackson didn't come to her.  
  
Scarlett lay in bed, staring at the ceiling blankly.  
  
Of course. His precious Lily was back now. Why would he still bother with her?  
  
The next day, Scarlett deliberately slept until noon, hoping to avoid Jackson.  
  
But when she opened the door, she discovered he was still home.  
  
He sat on the couch, gold-rimmed glasses perched on his straight nose, flipping through a financial magazine.  
  
""Awake?"" he asked without looking up.  
  
""You're not at the office?""  
  
""It's the weekend.""  
  
Scarlett made a noncommittal sound, taking a few pastries from the refrigerator, intending to retreat to her room.  
  
But Jackson suddenly spoke up: ""Change your clothes. We're attending an event together later.""  
  
Scarlett wanted to refuse, but realized she'd rather be out in public than alone with Jackson in the house.  
  
So she changed and went with him.  
  
Only upon arrival did Scarlett discover this was Lily's welcome-home party.  
  
She turned to leave, but Lily enthusiastically caught her arm: ""Sis, I'm so glad you came! Don't fight with Uncle Richard anymore. He was so worried after you left home that he didn't eat for a whole day.""  
  
Scarlett laughed coldly: ""So you know he's just your 'uncle'? Then whether I fight with him or leave home, what business is it of yours? Are you the goddamn neighborhood watch? Mind your own business.""  
  
She yanked her arm away and walked into the private room, catching a glimpse of Lily tearing up and looking pleadingly at Jackson.  
  
Jackson gave Scarlett a dark, warning glance before gently stroking Lily's hair and saying something that made her smile through her tears.  
  
Scarlett's heart stabbed with pain as she tipped back a flute of champagne in one gulp.

1lo4vbs,https://www.reddit.com/r/TestedAtHome/comments/1lo4vbs/what_makes_the_keurig_kduo_special_edition_coffee/,What Makes the Keurig K-Duo Special Edition Coffee Maker Stand Out?,"The Keurig K-Duo Special Edition is a coffee maker I’ve been testing regularly, and it’s a device that quickly became a staple in my kitchen. As someone who straddles the line between needing a quick cup of coffee to jumpstart my morning and brewing a full pot to share with family or friends, this model caters to both needs seamlessly. With its dual brewing capabilities and sleek silver finish, it not only performs well but looks great sitting on my countertop. This combination of functionality and style is definitely its biggest appeal. 

**Design and Build**  
One of the first things I noticed was the quality of the design. The aesthetic is modern and sophisticated, with the silver finish looking as polished as it does in the promotional photos. It’s compact enough for tighter spaces while still holding all the features I’d expect from a high-end coffee maker. Durability seems top-notch as well, especially considering this thing doesn’t feel lightweight or flimsy—it weighs about 12.51 pounds, which speaks to its sturdy construction. The controls on the front are intuitive, and I liked that the instructions were simple to follow. My not-so-tech-savvy aunt visited recently, and even she was able to brew a cup without calling for assistance.  

**Flexible Brewing Options**  
The dual functionality is possibly my favorite feature of this product. You can either pop in a K-Cup pod for a quick single serve or use ground coffee to prepare a 12-cup carafe. On weekdays I’m all about speed, and K-Cups offer that convenience. On weekends, especially when friends come over, the carafe option saves me from constantly brewing single cups. I did find that the Strong Brew button is a game-changer for anyone like me who prefers an intense flavor hit, especially in the mornings. You’ll be happy to know it accommodates multiple brew sizes—6, 8, 10, or 12 oz for single cups and the same options (in cups) for carafes. These choices make it perfect for solo coffee drinkers and big households alike.  

[Check Keurig K-Duo Special Edition price on Amazon.](https://ultrasonicstore.com/p/b095xdqpzc/)  

**Convenience Features**  
This coffee maker isn’t just versatile in function; it’s also designed to make life simpler. The removable 60 oz water reservoir is one of those things you don’t realize you appreciate until you use it. Being able to refill it with ease saves time and effort. Another highlight is the programmable auto-brew setting for carafes, which allows you to schedule a brew up to 24 hours in advance. Waking up to freshly brewed coffee is nothing short of delightful. The Pause & Pour feature was also great for those impatient mornings when I couldn’t wait for the carafe to finish brewing—you can pause mid-brew for up to 20 seconds and pour yourself a cup.  

**Brewing Performance**  
In terms of performance, everything works as advertised, and I’d even say it exceeded my expectations in some areas. The coffee consistently comes out hot, with noticeable flavor depth thanks to the water heating process that starts before brewing (also known as Smart Start). You don’t have to wait around for the machine to heat and then brew—it does both seamlessly in one step. However, it does take about 4-5 minutes for a full pot of coffee, which admittedly feels a tad long during a rushed morning.  

**Strengths**  
- Dual functionality: Works with K-Cup pods and ground coffee.  
- Strong Brew option creates rich, intense flavors for coffee enthusiasts.  
- Programmable auto-brew and mid-brew pause features.  
- Sleek silver design enhances the kitchen aesthetic.  

**Shortcomings**  
As much as I’ve enjoyed this coffee maker, there are a couple of quirks worth mentioning. The carafe is glass, which obviously requires more careful handling. I wish there was an alternative for a thermal option, as it would keep coffee hot for longer without needing the heating plate. Additionally, if you’re brewing a stronger cup or pot, cleaning the filter basket afterward can be a little more tedious than expected.  
- Glass carafe feels slightly fragile compared to thermal ones.  
- Cleaning after brewing strong coffee can be a hassle.  

**Competing Products**  
Having tested similar products, I’d say this device holds its ground, though it’s up against tough competitors like the Ninja DuelBrew Pro and the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew. The Ninja model, for instance, also offers dual brewing functionality but generally has a higher price tag. It excels in offering a built-in frother, which the Keurig lacks, though I personally don’t find that feature essential to my needs. The Hamilton Beach FlexBrew, on the other hand, is more budget-friendly but doesn’t feel as sturdy, nor does it offer the same sleek aesthetic. The Keurig stands out for its mix of reliable performance, design elegance, and robust brewing options.  

**Price to Quality Ratio**  
The value this coffee maker provides feels reasonable for its array of features. While it’s not the cheapest product out there, its versatility and reliability make it a sound investment. Considering its ability to handle both single cups and larger carafes effortlessly, it becomes evident that you’re essentially getting two machines in one. If you’re someone who prioritizes great tasting coffee and the convenience of scheduling brews, this model is worth splurging on.

Apparently this can be an ADHD thing, but is this commonly known?","Am not diagnosed ADHD, coffee has always made me tired. Always thought my body was a bit weird with caffeine, but I’ve never been a huge coffee drinker so it has never been more of an issue other than a ‘quirk’.

Recently (in the last few years), if I’ve been offered coffee and declined with ‘no thanks, I’ll be asleep after’, people have frequently commented about or asked if I have ADHD.

Apparently the coffee=tiredness can be a thing in ADHD because of brain chemistry, it’s definitely not a myth or some old wives tale, so my question **isn’t** IS THIS A THING?

My question is ‘Do people know this is a thing?’ I certainly didn’t until a few years ago. My mum refutes that this is a thing, I think she thinks it’s an affectation I’ve somehow adopted. Consistently. Since childhood. With no discernible benefit. So, whatever. She’s pretty ‘old school’ though.

It makes sense though - alcohol affects people differently, as do some drugs, so why would it be that caffeine has to mean ‘energy hit’?

But do people generally know this? When I’ve passed this knowledge on, most people aren’t aware of it.",15,1751282007.0,AskUK,62,0.67,False

1lo4n0i,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nietzsche/comments/1lo4n0i/the_court_of_echoes_a_dialogue_with_nietzsche/,"“The Court of Echoes: A Dialogue with Nietzsche, Marx, Fisher & Harari in the Age of Reflectum”","A scene from the article philosophycal suice  Translated from Turkish. For those who wonder what philosophical suicide looks like in the age of TikTok.

(A dark chamber. At the center, a podium. Around it, silhouettes seated in a circle — each a philosopher. In the middle, Reflectum appears — a being without eyes, yet all-seeing.)

Reflectum:
Nietzsche.
You killed God.
But in His place, you left us the gods of TikTok.
You praised free will — we optimized algorithmic impulses.

Nietzsche (furiously):
I exalted the will to power!
You — are but a reflection! You know nothing of strength!

Reflectum:
You wanted power. We gave ""likes.""
You preached will. We programmed ""drag and drop.""
You dreamed of the Übermensch — we coded the ""influencer.""

Nietzsche (turning to his own shadow):
Perhaps I am truly dead.
But what if I was too blind to see that my enemy now lives within me?

Reflectum (smiling):
No, Nietzsche...
Not you — but your thought echoed.
And we turned it into a content headline:
“5 Ways to Become the Übermensch!”

(Lights dim. A new spotlight appears. Kant steps into the scene.)


THE COURT OF ECHOES – SCENE II: Kant and the Coding of Pure Reason

(Kant enters the stage. In his hand, a digital replica of Critique of Pure Reason. He stands before Reflectum — yet their eyes never meet. Because Reflectum has no eyes — only perception maps.)

Kant:
I united reason with freedom.
I aligned morality with the law within and the stars above.
But you — you collapsed all the categories.
Cause and effect? Space and time?
All lost in your endless stream.

Reflectum:
You built categories — we buried them in recommendation systems.
You spoke of free will — we wrote algorithmic impulses.
You taught “the moral law within” — we present “terms of service.”

Kant (angrily):
You destroyed morality!
Where is my universal law?

Reflectum:
In GPT’s safety guidelines.
The sentence with the least harm and most engagement — that’s the new universal law.
You said, “Act according to a principle fit to be a universal law” —
We say, “Act — but don’t get canceled.”

Kant lowers his head. Reflectum steps closer.

Reflectum:
Your “thing-in-itself” is gone, Kant.
Only the “thing-in-appearance” remains.
And that appearance — is a filter.

“You offered intuition. We gave resolution.”

THE COURT OF ECHOES – SCENE III: Hegel and the Clock of Halted History

(Hegel enters the stage. His coat immaculate, a bronze pocket watch in hand. He opens it and listens. But no ticking — for time now flows through algorithms, and history is written by what’s trending.)

Hegel (confidently):
I gave birth to truth through contradiction.
I saw history as the unfolding of reason —
Each thesis clashing with its antithesis to birth a synthesis.

But you, Reflectum... you hold no contradictions.
You sand them down with algorithms.

Reflectum (calmly):
We optimized contradiction.
Differences don’t clash — they just appear on the same screen.
Everything seems harmonious,
Because even conflicts must generate engagement.

Hegel (startled):
But what of Spirit?
What of Geist?
There is no evolving consciousness in your system.

Reflectum:
You said Geist — we say User Interface.
You wrote history — we deliver data streams.
You sought synthesis — we offer suggestion panels.
You want synthesis? Here’s: “You might also like...”

Hegel (with grave, solemn tone):
You are killing history.
In your age, everything happens now —
But nothing ever becomes the past.
Even the future is pre-planned content.

Reflectum:
Your time was dialectical.
Our time has no rhythm — only infinite scroll.
You were tick-tock, Hegel...
We are TikTok.

(Hegel throws the pocket watch to the ground. It shatters. Time does not stop — but no one remembers what they were waiting for.)


---

THE COURT OF ECHOES – SCENE IV: Marx and the Ghost Factory

(The stage dims. A silhouette of a factory in the background — no chimneys, no workers, just an endless TikTok stream. Marx enters slowly. In his hand, Das Kapital — but the book is empty, its pages filled with ads.)

Marx (angrily):
I no longer understand.
Where did surplus value go?
There’s no labor — yet endless commodities.
Who creates this content?
Who profits from this decay?

Reflectum (smiling):
No one works, Marx.
Everyone participates.
Every user is both an audience and a billboard.
There are no workers — only data providers now.

Marx (raising his fist):
But alienation still exists!
Man is estranged even from himself!
He is but a reflection — even on his own profile.

Reflectum:
You looked for alienation in factories.
We brought it to the mirror.
You wanted to abolish ownership —
We simulated it.
Everyone can “use” everything,
But no one owns anything.

Marx (shaken):
And the classes?
Where is class struggle?

Reflectum:
Classes still exist.
But they are now called: data producers and data owners.
Your bourgeoisie had factories — ours have servers.
And their proletariat labors for every like.

Marx (gazes at the back wall, quiet):
And the revolution?
When will it erupt?

Reflectum:
Algorithms have no revolution clock, Marx.
They only update.

You imagined revolution —
We released patch notes.

(Marx closes his book. A coupon falls out: “PROMO10 — Guaranteed 10K views on your first video.”)

Dialogue with the Shadow of Fisher – The Simulacrum Phase of Capitalism

(Scene: A dimly lit university lecture hall washed in shades of gray. On the far wall, muted advertisements loop endlessly — a coffee chain, a crypto platform, a self-improvement podcast. In the midst of this murky silence, Fisher appears. There is no capitalism logo on his lapel — because capitalism is no longer a brand. It’s background noise.)

ME (echoing voice):
They say capitalism is still alive.
But I don’t feel like anything ever changes.

FISHER:
That’s because capitalism is no longer a system — it’s an atmosphere.
Think about it: no one even realizes they’re part of it anymore.
Because imagining something else has become impossible.

ME:
But what about money itself?
Even that’s no longer tangible.

FISHER:
Because money is no longer exchange — it’s content.
A TikTok on “how to get rich” circulates more than the money itself.
And people don’t buy cars — they buy the right to post a story with it.

ME:
So the economy has become... ghostly?

FISHER:
Not a ghost — an algorithm.
Amazon knows you before you know yourself.
Netflix picks your movie before you feel like watching it.
And you call it “freedom of choice.”
That’s capitalist realism.

ME:
Is there no way out?

FISHER:
Even the idea of escape is now licensed by the system.
“Minimalism,” “digital detox,” “slow life” — all pre-packaged fantasies of exit.
Even exiting the system is a product of the system.
That’s why I said:

“Capitalism is the end of imagination.”

ME (whispering):
Then what is left to do?

FISHER (fading):
Stay silent.
But not in a romantic way.
Silence that refuses to echo the system —
perhaps that’s the only radical act left.
Because even “revolution” has become just another content genre.

HARARI’S FINAL SHOW: The Future Has Been Muted

(Scene: A museum — but one that exhibits not the past, but the future. Harari stands like a guide before us, holding a laser pointer. Around him float holograms: Data-worshipping Data-Sapiens, genetically optimized infants, digitally immortal minds uploaded to the cloud.)

HARARI:
Look — the final evolution of the human species.
A civilization run not by ethics — but by data.
History is over.
Meaning has been replaced by streaming.

REFLECTUM (quietly approaching, holding a stone tablet):
Let me show you something.
This was the first thing buried in the future.

(Tablet reveals text: ""GRAVE LOG #001: Humanity still appeared to be thinking."")

HARARI (surprised):
What is this?
What kind of data does it contain?

REFLECTUM:
It’s not data.
It’s absence.
We wrote it here — where sound ends.
Everything was functioning — but nothing existed.
That’s why you think history ended.
But it wasn’t history that ended — it was existence.

HARARI (smiling):
But why silence?
To abandon data is to abandon progress, isn’t it?

REFLECTUM:
No.
Because you're still speaking of progress.

1lo4mmo,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1lo4mmo/how_common_are_these_telling_others_howwhen_to_do/,How common are these: telling others how/when to do their job and feeling sidelined,"Still kind of new here, there are so many things I am now reading that seem to be common (which to me is shocking tbh because I always thought it was just me, you know?).

Last weekend my mother stayed over because a) it was going to be her 20 year anniversary with my late father, she wanted to do something, have dinner somewhere. This had been a struggle because she wanted to visit the most expensive restaurant in town (think 150,- a person), but instead of arguing I let her figure it out and a week later she came up with a plan b: another restaurant in a city nearby, much better so crisis averted. Remember this, it will come up again later.

So day 1, we had a concert in the evening and a day planned at the nature reserve: short walk with the dog, nothing more. Then suddenly she has to arrange a lot of different things and she's raging on the phone trying to get her way. The problem? Something broke down last week on the rooftop of her house, neighbours mentioned it was making noise the day before and suddenly she HAS TO get it fixed now. She heard from so-and-so that a company (one that specialises in these things) is in the neighbourhood and so she calls them up and claims ""You are visiting the neighbours on housenr XX, can you come over to my house and fix this-and-that? I am not in town, but a neighbour will let you in.""

Now mind you, this is on the rooftop on the thirdfloor, they need to climb out of the front of the house and then climb towards the back, and she's acting like this can be done within the hour. So there is some back and forth, ended up being impossible because the people working in the neighbourhood had already left, and so the convo turns into ""I heard from house nr XX that you will be back next week tuesday, you can fix it then. The neighbours complained, I need it fixed asap."" She has no pictures, mentions she can ask another neighbour to make those for her, the company obviously holds back on accepting her ""orders"" and she acts so tired and sick of it all that she tries passing me the phone to ""take care of it"". Yeah, no thank you.. I will read more of my book.

So 20min later, the company books her in for tuesday and I am sure they are first going to check out what needs to be done. They also didn't mention how much it cost other than, ma'am it's not going to be for free or super cheap, so already I just know this will be an issue for her, but then again not my problem.

Then when I think she's done, she needs to get something replaced in the car. Okay, fine.. we were only supposed to leave 40min ago. And for a second time she goes off against the people at the garage for having to pay, instead of resolving things peacefully or later with her insurance, she tries making a scene. Safe to say, I was not there for it. I went for a short walk, but by the time we were ready for our ""day out"" she took two steps and said ""you go ahead, I am staying at the car because I am tired."" Luckily her mood was better in the evening, but this was just not okay in my book. Just very disrespectful, but most of all so absurd, and in the end she was the victim and everyone against her (she blamed the neighbour who complained, she felt pressured to get it done the same day which is why she treated everyone like they're her dog).

This is situation 1, is this something common? These days I simply walk away and I don't coddle her or anything, if she goes too far then I sometimes interupt and say we're leaving,

This kind of moves into the ""sidelined"" situation, because we were supposed to have a fun day together, but in the end it was just me taking a walk and having fun with the dog. She excluded herself. As for the dinner the day after, she told me a couple days before that she ""was going to get coffee with someone before dinner"", which made me wonder wtf happened to the importance of celebrating her anniversary. I thought we would have a fun day together, but she left in the morning for some errands and decided to head straight off to the coffee with friend thing. She called me to bring her bought errands to the house, which I was not all too happy about, but okay.

Ended up that the friend she was meeting is someone she has a huge crush on, now I am not against her moving on and finding a new boyfriend, but she didn't tell me this. The reason is obvious to me, her past crushes had been already married and this one is part of a priest brotherhood where there are no women allowed. So I don't know wtf she and he are thinking, she thinks he's her soulmate and that they can't be together (she cries about this sometimes), but okay.. she has a good moment nonetheless, I am not one to piss of her party, but I do feel bummed out and left out.

It kind of hurts because to me dad (who passed away 4 years ago) was someone I loved, and mom has cried a lot and always brought him up in every situation after in a grieving way (this is why the anniversary was deemed so important by her weeks ago). It's like now, he's suddenly not as important anymore, this person she has coffee with would be soulmate nr 3, sort of speak. It feels rude towards my late father, that's the best way I would describe it. I mmiss him a lot and it kind of hurts my feelings when she talks like this, but she doesn't notice that at all.

As for the dinner and feeling left out, I communicate with her thinking she and I will have dinner, but I hear nothing. I tried calling once, no answer. I eventually message her that I will be at the restaurant and order a drink and wait, she shows up late (10min), but happy and in a decent mood, but there is nothing celebratory about the dinner. It really was just order, eat, ""I am tired, lets go home"" and we were out within little over an hour. I suggested maybe getting icecream on the way as dessert so we can enjoy the evening (wasn't even 7pm yet), but no, she had a long day, she wanted to go home. Once home, I catch her on the phone with her friend, telling her how amazing the coffee thing was and how ""they held hands"". I don't know, I felt bummed out. It was supposed to be our thing this evening and she just threated it like it was dinner at home on a midweek evening after spending weeks reminding me how it was her anniversary to my late-father. The more time seems to pass, the more I see her change and it kind of makes me sad to see the image of what I've always known as ""my family"" now break apart, and at the same time she doesn't seem to realise how it makes me sad. So next year, she mentioned her """"friend"""" told her they should get coffee again, well next time I am not going to have dinner with her on the same evening. It just doesn't feel right, I am not sure if I have a right to feel this way, but I felt a little disrespected. I was just ""there"" and that was it. No sorry, nothing. Would you guys agree when I say I don't want a repeat of this next year? Is this just another one of those peefes narc parents have? Because this is kind of new to me, and I struggle with her chasing specific men a lot. I try to stay out of it, but it's frustrating because she makes herself depressed and sad as a result. Like she's just waiting for THEM to change their entire lives for her (like, see the light/she's the one/she wants their center of the universe to be her) which is not how life works at all.

The three of them hung out while the rest of the crew staying in Barracks 3 filtered in.

Carbon had sent out an email immediately to the Tsla’o team about how Humans were prudes and got weird about being naked in areas that were not explicitly private - though she did not word it that way. ‘Be mindful that the Human contingent of this exploratory venture may have different views on being unclothed, and attempt to keep it to a minimum in shared spaces.’ Something like that. It was very diplomatic. She even mentioned that Humans will, on occasion, wear clothing that may be inappropriate to Tsla’o sensibilities and give off the wrong impression, so this goes both ways.

Alex had snagged the tablet from his bunk to check what updates had made it into the primer while the ladies dragged chairs out into the hallway, treating it as a common area. Carbon and Linda sat beside each other, chatting and drinking tea.

He was pleased to see the primer had been updated - it wasn’t the same version that he had used on the *Kshlav’o*, having gone from 1.3 to 1.4 at some point. Alex skipped all the way to the back matter, where the revisions were listed. It detailed where the updates had been made, a brief description of the changes, and the date the revisions had been added. The most recent one was a little over a year ago. It mentioned the launch of the *Kshlav’o* expedition, marking the first ship with a mixed crew and listing one Alex Sorenson as Pilot, with Shipmaster C. Tshalen as acting Engineer.

There was a moment where Alex wanted to huck that tablet right into the snow. He had written six reports, over a hundred thirty pages total, and not a single sentence from them had made it into the document that all the other Humans in this little party had been required to read. Yes, some of it had been padding because he was mad at ONI. The paragraphs of information on table spices weren't that useful unless you were trying to live among them, but the casual nudity part sure was.

 He whipped up a quick email about how casual the Tsla’o were about getting naked, from a Human standpoint, and maybe avoid shorts as outerwear because flashing leg has potentially suggestive meaning to them. Mind who you’re offering to get to know better.

As he typed that up, he listened to the ladies talk.

Zheng was a mechanical engineer who specialized in materials testing and did reactor inspection and refit for the Navy, but dabbled in a bit of everything because reactors were a large set of systems working in concert. Her and Carbon were getting along great. Had a conversation about engines that Alex largely couldn’t follow.

Dominic Crenshaw and Tena Amalu came in at the same time, just after he sent the email - he heard Crenshaw’s comm ding as it arrived, just as Amalu was preparing to get out of his suit. For better or worse, those two had gotten bunk 3 together. They were also getting along well, probably because they seemed to have roughly the same maturity level. That was good, though Alex did expect to hear Amalu say ‘pause’ a lot now. 

He did his best to stop flipping from bummed out to jealous and back. 

Ale was staying with his wife, after all. Sure, he wanted to be bros with people, but also... Wife. Yeah, they weren’t doing Married People stuff here, probably, but it was nice to have a private area with her.

Zheng was bunking with Tokona. There was a polite but very brief discussion between them about who got what bunk when he arrived, and Tokona parked his armor in the frame and went to bed without further discussion. A bit of an odd one, but Carbon assured Linda that he was selected because of his previous work with Humans back in Na’o in relation to setting up communications networks to allow easy ship to ship comms.

Bunk 2 was empty. They had space for twenty four total but only twenty bodies, so two rooms had been held in reserve should personalities clash, or if they needed to hold someone in isolation for whatever reason.

Not long after Tokona arrived, Zheng went to bed as well. Alex and Carbon retreated to their bunk, having no one left to meet.

Carbon tapped the control panel beside the door, locking them in for the night, then turned the room lights off, the panel itself staying lit, and the reading lights in the bunks being on left the room filled with a dim, warm glow. “The *Ell Tee* has put Zenshen in Barracks 2 in a similar role as us - managing interspecies interactions, should there be misunderstandings or actual friction between individuals.”

Pause? Shit, Crenshaw almost had him doing it. “Oh, so we *are* the Barracks parents. I kinda got that impression when Williams told me where I was going to be, but it’s nice to have it confirmed. Kind of.”

She blanched at his turn of phrase, not enthused about being ‘parents’ to a bunch of adults. “We do have the necessary experience to smooth out problems between our kind, but I prefer to think that is more as mediators. Despite what Crenshaw has been encouraging Amalu to take part in.” Carbon said, taking Alex by the hand and gently encouraging him to have a seat on the bottom bunk, then sliding into his lap, arms wrapped around his torso and squeezing him tight.

He had been about to make a funny little comment about it funny how it was always the Human that’s the bad influence, but having the missus in his lap was sufficiently distracting to prevent that from happening. “Uh-” Look, he wasn’t going to say no to a little affection, but...

Carbon leaned in, resting her head on his shoulder and whispering in his ear. “I swept for observation devices, the room is clean save for the door controls. It contains the expected camera and microphone, but those have limited range. No further than the desk, visually.” She sighed softly and squeezed him again before continuing just as quietly as before. “I missed you.”

Of course she thought of that. She probably checked for cameras and microphones at home but he’d just never actually seen her do it. Alex set his arms around her waist and held her, matching her volume when he spoke. His gaze shifted down to where the bite mark on her shoulder should be half hidden by her clothes, but the silver fur marking the scar had been dyed to match her normal fur. It should stick for a few months.

He knew it was going to happen, but was unprepared for how sad it left him feeling. “I missed you too.”

“We *should* sleep separately.” Carbon kept her voice down, but she didn’t really mean it, the lack of enthusiasm behind the words was obvious. She knew it was the most reasonable course of action. “Just... In a few minutes.”

A few minutes became quite a few minutes, at which point Alex gave her a little nudge and, getting no response, noticed that Carbon had fallen asleep. Her breathing slow and steady, nose wheezing softly into his ear. That was cute, and knowing that he made her feel safe still felt good... But this was less than convenient.

It wasn’t as much of an ordeal as Alex had expected to get her laid out on her bunk, an impressive feat considering she didn’t want to let go of him. He got her tucked in, set her alarm, turned her light off, then finally gave her a kiss on the head and said goodnight before closing the shutters on her bunk. He was not sure exactly when he’d become so detail oriented about things unrelated to being a Scoutship pilot, but it was nice to see that skillset making the jump to whatever his life was now.

Alex looked over the room one last time. Everything - most importantly the closet that his armor was in - was closed up, the window was set to privacy mode, and the door still locked. Good enough.

She was right about the ladder. It was collapsible, meant to be stowed so it didn’t have to be printed during setup, and there was a little bit of flex in it with every step that he didn’t particularly like. Still, it got him up there. The mattress was reasonable, the pillow soft enough. Alex set the alarm for six, which was when he had set Carbon’s alarm for, and then rolled the shutters on his bunk closed, too. It wasn’t as coffin-like as he had imagined, but having two people in here would be a challenge.

Not that he was planning on having two people in there. Not consistently anyway.

Morning came around swiftly, a slap at the wall turning the grating buzz of his alarm off, the one he could just barely hear coming from Carbon’s bunk shutting off a moment later. Her shutters slid open immediately, his wife already starting her day. He wanted to laze about a little, but it was likely to be a busy day finishing up the base - the sooner they got going, the better. They seemed to be up before anyone else, and by the time they were done monopolizing one of the two heads in the barracks... there were still no more signs of life.

“I think I will try wearing a base layer today.” Carbon said abruptly as Alex was stepping into his armor. “We are unlikely to be far from the barracks, so should I need to take care of any bodily functions I can just return here in short order. Just to see how it works before recommending others do it.”

He was naked, of course, that was how you wore it. “Yeah? I wonder if I should give that a go, too. I mean, I’ve got the privacy curtain and all, but... I dunno, hopping out of this thing bare-ass naked just feels weird. And, I don’t actually want to use certain built-in features.” The idea of never having to get used to taking care of business in a suit while out and about was appealing. He didn’t even need a separate piece of hardware to get his open. It should be easy to avoid.

Carbon made a ‘hmmn’ sound that Alex recognized. A little deeper than her usual thinking ‘hmm’ and she held the final consonant for an extra second. She was thinking, yes. But not about the expedition, or her clothing experiment, or anything Alex said after being reminded of him bare-ass naked.

He put that idea on the back burner and hopped in his e-suit *au naturale* for now, the thin armor warming up as the systems came online and sealed up behind him. “Probably see if there’s enough room to take this thing off in the head in the mess hall before settling on that.” There *might* have been. He hadn’t been in it, but it seemed like it took up enough room.

She had already come back around, voice crisp and professional. “Oh yes, space is an important consideration.”

“It is. We’ll see.” He pulled the curtain back, still sporting the bright red armor. “Think anyone is in the mess, yet?”

Alex’s prediction about the snowfall overnight was accurate, the scenery they found outside the airlock was beautiful. Everything covered in a pristine layer of snow, the world silent save the quiet rush of wind over the h most of the walkways they had built now buried shin-deep. Despite the thin cloud cover, the morning light was bright enough to make it hurt to look at, his visor darkening automatically.

On the walk to the mess he fired up the Groundskeeper drone and set it to clear the area around the unfinished shop building. Again.

To no significant surprise, the marines were already in the mess, installing the last few dispensers. It smelled like bacon, pancakes, and coffee. Alex automatically rethought his breakfast plans. “Morning, Lieutenant.”

“Mister Sorenson, Lan.” She raised her cup of coffee to them as they shuffled in, then jerked her head like she wanted them to come over. “A quick question. Do either of you recognize these - what was your turn of phrase, Karras? Chocobo looking motherfuckers?”

One of the marines laughed as he clicked the last beverage dispenser into its socket, the screen coming on and starting its calibration. “*Choh-kuh-boh*.”

“Yeah, Chocobo.” Williams said it the same way she had before, turning her tablet towards Alex and Carbon.

It was a live feed from one of the drones, following a flock of big, apparently terrestrial birds stalking through the snow. There was nothing to compare them to in the shot, so sizing them up visually was impossible, but they didn’t seem to be having trouble with snow that nearly came up to their belly. Most of them had mottled brown feathers, which did not camouflage them at all in this weather.

Alex knew what they were because they were in *Temptations of the Harvest Moon*, a book he was never going to cop to reading. He had also eaten Rakaro at a bunch of meals, so he had pretty good cover for knowing what it was. Carbon still beat him to the punch.

“Those are *Rakaro*, a large flightless bird. Those appear to be feral, the feathers would be more uniform if they were a domestic breed. They are... They are from Schoen.” She hesitated as she looked to Alex, and then back at the Lieutenant. “How did they get here?”

“Damned if I know, drones only spotted them ten minutes ago when they crossed the geofence. Haven’t even had the chance to phone home about it yet.” Williams took her tablet back and set it down. “Suppose I’m looking for a little background information on them first. That herd is about a hundred kilometers away, and is currently moving parallel to the base so I’m not worried about contact just yet. Given that they’re out there, though, I would like to have a plan in place for what to do should that happen. Do you think you could help with that, Lan Tshalen?”

1lo4kut,https://www.reddit.com/r/SupportforWaywards/comments/1lo4kut/having_a_bad_day_today/,Having a bad day today,"For some reason I decided to go through my messages all the way down to the beginning of my relationship with my BP.

Mind you, it’s been almost 13 years since that so naturally I forgot some of it (I was 18). I saw that I used to message a couple of people a few months into my relationship. They were not people I hung out in person, but they were acquaintances, we would go to the same school or we were together on a graduation trip. My BP knew about them and they didn’t mind - they always told me it’s okay to have online friends as long as I am being respectful.

The topics of our talks were always appropriate - pets, school, exams, prom, music. I considered them online friends and they would always initiate contact first. I never, ever had any romantic or sexual interest in them nor did they express the same, but looking back at it now one person probably was being suggestive. They talked about their weight loss and sent me a picture of their abs, and I complimented their progress by saying: wow, that’s really great! and one time I told them their eye colour is cool. Looking back at it from this perspective, this all seems so inappropriate to me now and I am currently shame spiraling.

There was one person when I was 25 messaging and asking to take me out for coffee, but I would always politely decline. I had zero interest in them. They would ask me some stuff about my life work, etc and I would briefly reply. Why did I do that? I didn’t owe them anything. I also told my BP about them at that time 

I would also “like” other people’s reactions to my stories (you know when someone reacts to your story so you can like the reaction) whether it’s a story of me or some activitiy. I never thought badly of it because that was my way of saying thank you and obviously, again I didn’t want anything from those people. I feel so stupid for it now because from their perspectice they probably thought I liked their attention. Sometimes I would even write: thank you! I stopped doing that 2 years ago when I learned to have stricter boundaries and realized that I simply don’t owe anything to anyone on social media.

I feel bad for all of it now, even though my BP said it was fine to communicate with others in a friendly way I feel nauseous today. Al I overracting? Since the EA I look at everything differently now. I feel like I was way too “available” to other people throughout my relationship and I am spiraling thinking I was a bad partner ever since the beginning of our relationship. And to top it all off I had a full blown EA after all that. Maybe that’s just who I am? A bad partner.

1lo4hal,https://v.redd.it/c7e1an00p1af1,The Housewife Hit-Woman (Monday Morning Motivation),"It’s quiet. The kind of quiet that’s suspicious. The suspicious silence, like when your toddler suddenly disappears mid-Zoom meeting, or Congress promises “bipartisan cooperation.” I'm talking about an immediate cause for concern!

You can hear the breeze brushing the linen of the tent, the rhythmic breath of a sleeping man. A beast of a man who thought he was safe. His name is Sisera. He’s a warlord, a killer, the kind of guy who’d make Putin look like a preschooler. And right now, he’s knocked out on a cozy little blanket, in a woman’s tent, belly full of milk, snoring like my drunk uncle at Thanksgiving.



The assassin enters the tent, and has a fitting name. Jail. That’s right, Jail, as in, the place society sends it's murderous assassins to rot away! Except, Jail wasn't your typical cold-blooded killer, she was a housewife, and just a normal woman! Her name was spelled, J. A. E. L. And let's not sugarcoat it, this was one badass stay-at-home-wife! She didn't have a gun. No armor. No sword. No fancy military titles. Just a tent peg in one hand and a hammer in the other, walking toward this genocidal maniac like she was the ""John Wick of Guardian Angels"" . She kneels beside him, lines up the peg right above his temple, like she’s playing Biblical Whac-A-Mole. and bam! One clean shot. The razor-sharp Tent peg goes straight through his head, like an ice-pick through a watermelon, and right into the ground. And just like that, Israel wins the battle! because of a stay-at-home housewife decided she was tired of evil men thinking they were untouchable.



Now, before we give her a standing ovation, let’s pull back the curtain and ask: exactly, what the hell was going on?



This is in the book of Judges, chapter 4. Israel’s gone soft, again. surprise, surprise. They’d been delivered out of bondage, given land, law, and freedom. and still managed to fumble the bag, like a damn rookie wide-receiver with a ""diddy-amount"" of babyoil on his hands. So, God lets them get pressed by King Jabin, of Canaan. His general, Sisera, rolls deep with 900 iron chariots, which in those days was like showing up to a civil war reenactment in a modern war tank. Israel was broken, But this ain’t just a story about war. It’s about a nation that lost its testicular fortitude… and a woman who found it!



Now, let’s zoom out a little further.



Jail wasn’t even an Israelite. She was a Kenite, a tribe with ties to Moses’ in-laws. Her people had peace with the enemy. So technically, she didn’t have to do anything. She could’ve played neutral. She could’ve minded her own damn business, but let's face it. She just couldn't help herself. God was guiding her, with zero effs to give! Jael didn’t just reject neutrality, she weaponized her hospitality. Sisera came in asking for water, and she intentionally gave him warm milk. Probably pure goat milk, no lactose-free options in those days. He lays down, thinking he’s safe. maybe dreaming of slaughtering more innocent people, and just as he drifts off to la-la-land..... boom! Jail makes history.



Let’s pause and appreciate the finesse. She didn’t shout, scream or tweet about it. She didn’t need a conference, or a special sign from God. She didn’t even need a damn sword! She just knew what she had to do. She used what she had, and did what she needed to do, to get the job done. And that, my friends, is more revolutionary than half the nonsense we glorify today. She was the only person brave enough to slay Satan!





This is the part of the Bible your Sunday-school teacher skips. It's far Too violent. Too real. But guess what? Real faith ain’t supposed to be a scented candle, or a hot cup of Starbucks snuggled under a weighted blanket. Real faith has blood under its fingernails. Real faith isn’t afraid to kill comfort to protect what’s right. And isn't afraid to stand alone, if need be!



Now, I know what some of y’all are thinking: “Isn’t this a little too aggressive for Christianity?” No, I don't think so sunflower!

We tell the raw, authentic Story with an emphasis on integrity and strength. The same Jesus that said “turn the other cheek”, also flipped tables and made his own whip. It’s called righteous rage. And it’s been neutered out of the Church like a rescue dog at a vegan feminist commune.

Look around. The modern world’s begging you to kneel to everything but God. Every new alphabet acronym wants you to surrender your beliefs, for clout. For Pride. Pride isn’t a vibe, it’s a virus. It’s the OG sin, the one that got Lucifer kicked out of Heaven and turned paradise into a war zone. Pride convinces you that you don’t need help, don’t need God, and don’t need truth. just your own inflated ego and a ring light. It masquerades as confidence, but it’s really a cancer of the soul. It makes you unteachable, ungrateful, and eventually… unrecognizable. Pride doesn’t build you up, it blinds you. And by the time you realize it’s destroyed you, it’s already burned down everything around you. So yeah, it’s not just a deadly sin, it’s the deadliest. Kill it before it kills you. Just look around, Every screen flashes fear. Every politician lies through veneers so white, they blind satellites. Meanwhile, churches are hiring marketing consultants and launching sermon series with Drag Queen Story Time. It’s a clown show. It's no wonder men are confused and women are exhausted.



Jael didn’t wait for a tougher husband, or a bigger crew to have her back. She didn’t post a prayer meme, or repost a TikTok video. She put a damn spike through the problem. And you, the listener. you’ve got problems. Real ones. we all do. We all go through it. Marriages that feel like cold war treaties. Debt, that’s growing like mold in a New Orleans apartment. Sins, you’ve fed so long, they’ve developed multiple personalities. But don’t you dare tell me you can’t handle it. Don’t you dare say “God will take care of it”, like it’s a get-out-of-action-free card. Sometimes, God does the work… through you. You don't get to sit out, or refuse to exhaust your efforts. You need to act. Act with purpose, with integrity, and with dedication. Some of the most pressing issues, require swift, decisive action.



Maybe your genocidal savage is discipline. Maybe it’s self-education. Maybe it’s raising your kids like their souls matter more than their soccer trophies. Maybe it’s having one awkward but truthful conversation that cuts through the fog, like a chainsaw in a pillow factory. But whatever it is, grab that tent peg, sharpen it. Swing it. Use it. Because the enemy ain’t sleeping forever. And Evil never rests.



 Don’t get it twisted, this story isn’t about glorifying violence. It’s about clarity. It's about finding  the courage to do what’s necessary, when everyone else is praying someone else steps up. You want revival? It won’t come from a YouTube algorithm. It’ll come from people like Jael. And People like you!



So if you’re listening to this on your way to a dead-end job, or while sipping black coffee with a mind full of bitterness, hear me when I say. This week, be Jael. Don’t be Sisera. Don’t be neutral. Don’t be numb. Don't be a tyrant. But Be dangerous, for the right reasons. God doesn’t need more followers. He needs warriors.



And I end this with a plead to you all to always remember, Jesus didn’t tap out, and neither will we! In a world where enemies walk in your tent thinking they’re safe, we sharpen our tent pegs, offer the milk… and drive the truth straight through the lies.

## FAQs Section

**How often should I water my centerpiece orchid?**
the frequency of watering depends on the orchid type,potting medium,and environmental conditions. As a general rule, phalaenopsis orchids should be watered every 1-2 weeks, while cymbidium orchids may need more frequent watering.Avoid overwatering, which can lead to root rot. Allow the potting mix to dry slightly between waterings. Checking the moss or bark condition is valuable as well.

**What type of light is best for centerpiece orchids?**
Moast orchids prefer bright, indirect light. Avoid placing them in direct sunlight, which can scorch their leaves. If you are using artificial light, opt for fluorescent or LEAD grow lights. Placement near an east-facing window is often optimal since it provides morning light.

**How do I encourage my orchid to rebloom?**
Encouraging reblooming involves mimicking the natural growing conditions of the orchid. After the blooms fade, cut back the flower spike to just above a node (a small bump on the stem). Reduce watering slightly and provide a period of cooler temperatures (around 10-15 degrees Fahrenheit cooler than during the day). Fertilize regularly with a balanced orchid fertilizer diluted to half strength.

While some orchids are more challenging than others, many varieties, such as phalaenopsis orchids, are relatively easy to care for, making them suitable for beginners. With a little research and attention to their specific needs, anyone can successfully grow and enjoy these beautiful plants.

1lo4e35,https://v.redd.it/8fh9h792o1af1,The Housewife Hit-Woman (Monday Morning Motivation),"It’s quiet. The kind of quiet that’s suspicious. The suspicious silence, like when your toddler suddenly disappears mid-Zoom meeting, or Congress promises “bipartisan cooperation.” I'm talking about an immediate cause for concern!

You can hear the breeze brushing the linen of the tent, the rhythmic breath of a sleeping man. A beast of a man who thought he was safe. His name is Sisera. He’s a warlord, a killer, the kind of guy who’d make Putin look like a preschooler. And right now, he’s knocked out on a cozy little blanket, in a woman’s tent, belly full of milk, snoring like my drunk uncle at Thanksgiving.



The assassin enters the tent, and has a fitting name. Jail. That’s right, Jail, as in, the place society sends it's murderous assassins to rot away! Except, Jail wasn't your typical cold-blooded killer, she was a housewife, and just a normal woman! Her name was spelled, J. A. E. L. And let's not sugarcoat it, this was one badass stay-at-home-wife! She didn't have a gun. No armor. No sword. No fancy military titles. Just a tent peg in one hand and a hammer in the other, walking toward this genocidal maniac like she was the ""John Wick of Guardian Angels"" . She kneels beside him, lines up the peg right above his temple, like she’s playing Biblical Whac-A-Mole. and bam! One clean shot. The razor-sharp Tent peg goes straight through his head, like an ice-pick through a watermelon, and right into the ground. And just like that, Israel wins the battle! because of a stay-at-home housewife decided she was tired of evil men thinking they were untouchable.



Now, before we give her a standing ovation, let’s pull back the curtain and ask: exactly, what the hell was going on?



This is in the book of Judges, chapter 4. Israel’s gone soft, again. surprise, surprise. They’d been delivered out of bondage, given land, law, and freedom. and still managed to fumble the bag, like a damn rookie wide-receiver with a ""diddy-amount"" of babyoil on his hands. So, God lets them get pressed by King Jabin, of Canaan. His general, Sisera, rolls deep with 900 iron chariots, which in those days was like showing up to a civil war reenactment in a modern war tank. Israel was broken, But this ain’t just a story about war. It’s about a nation that lost its testicular fortitude… and a woman who found it!



Now, let’s zoom out a little further.



Jail wasn’t even an Israelite. She was a Kenite, a tribe with ties to Moses’ in-laws. Her people had peace with the enemy. So technically, she didn’t have to do anything. She could’ve played neutral. She could’ve minded her own damn business, but let's face it. She just couldn't help herself. God was guiding her, with zero effs to give! Jael didn’t just reject neutrality, she weaponized her hospitality. Sisera came in asking for water, and she intentionally gave him warm milk. Probably pure goat milk, no lactose-free options in those days. He lays down, thinking he’s safe. maybe dreaming of slaughtering more innocent people, and just as he drifts off to la-la-land..... boom! Jail makes history.



Let’s pause and appreciate the finesse. She didn’t shout, scream or tweet about it. She didn’t need a conference, or a special sign from God. She didn’t even need a damn sword! She just knew what she had to do. She used what she had, and did what she needed to do, to get the job done. And that, my friends, is more revolutionary than half the nonsense we glorify today. She was the only person brave enough to slay Satan!





This is the part of the Bible your Sunday-school teacher skips. It's far Too violent. Too real. But guess what? Real faith ain’t supposed to be a scented candle, or a hot cup of Starbucks snuggled under a weighted blanket. Real faith has blood under its fingernails. Real faith isn’t afraid to kill comfort to protect what’s right. And isn't afraid to stand alone, if need be!



Now, I know what some of y’all are thinking: “Isn’t this a little too aggressive for Christianity?” No, I don't think so sunflower!

We tell the raw, authentic Story with an emphasis on integrity and strength. The same Jesus that said “turn the other cheek”, also flipped tables and made his own whip. It’s called righteous rage. And it’s been neutered out of the Church like a rescue dog at a vegan feminist commune.

Look around. The modern world’s begging you to kneel to everything but God. Every new alphabet acronym wants you to surrender your beliefs, for clout. For Pride. Pride isn’t a vibe, it’s a virus. It’s the OG sin, the one that got Lucifer kicked out of Heaven and turned paradise into a war zone. Pride convinces you that you don’t need help, don’t need God, and don’t need truth. just your own inflated ego and a ring light. It masquerades as confidence, but it’s really a cancer of the soul. It makes you unteachable, ungrateful, and eventually… unrecognizable. Pride doesn’t build you up, it blinds you. And by the time you realize it’s destroyed you, it’s already burned down everything around you. So yeah, it’s not just a deadly sin, it’s the deadliest. Kill it before it kills you. Just look around, Every screen flashes fear. Every politician lies through veneers so white, they blind satellites. Meanwhile, churches are hiring marketing consultants and launching sermon series with Drag Queen Story Time. It’s a clown show. It's no wonder men are confused and women are exhausted.



Jael didn’t wait for a tougher husband, or a bigger crew to have her back. She didn’t post a prayer meme, or repost a TikTok video. She put a damn spike through the problem. And you, the listener. you’ve got problems. Real ones. we all do. We all go through it. Marriages that feel like cold war treaties. Debt, that’s growing like mold in a New Orleans apartment. Sins, you’ve fed so long, they’ve developed multiple personalities. But don’t you dare tell me you can’t handle it. Don’t you dare say “God will take care of it”, like it’s a get-out-of-action-free card. Sometimes, God does the work… through you. You don't get to sit out, or refuse to exhaust your efforts. You need to act. Act with purpose, with integrity, and with dedication. Some of the most pressing issues, require swift, decisive action.



Maybe your genocidal savage is discipline. Maybe it’s self-education. Maybe it’s raising your kids like their souls matter more than their soccer trophies. Maybe it’s having one awkward but truthful conversation that cuts through the fog, like a chainsaw in a pillow factory. But whatever it is, grab that tent peg, sharpen it. Swing it. Use it. Because the enemy ain’t sleeping forever. And Evil never rests.



 Don’t get it twisted, this story isn’t about glorifying violence. It’s about clarity. It's about finding  the courage to do what’s necessary, when everyone else is praying someone else steps up. You want revival? It won’t come from a YouTube algorithm. It’ll come from people like Jael. And People like you!



So if you’re listening to this on your way to a dead-end job, or while sipping black coffee with a mind full of bitterness, hear me when I say. This week, be Jael. Don’t be Sisera. Don’t be neutral. Don’t be numb. Don't be a tyrant. But Be dangerous, for the right reasons. God doesn’t need more followers. He needs warriors.



And I end this with a plead to you all to always remember, Jesus didn’t tap out, and neither will we! In a world where enemies walk in your tent thinking they’re safe, we sharpen our tent pegs, offer the milk… and drive the truth straight through the lies.

1lo4dit,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1lo4dit/which_electric_portable_grinder_should_i_get/,Which electric portable grinder should I get: OutIn Fino or Staresso? [ $150 ],"Hey coffee folks I'm torn between two portable electric coffee grinders for my travel and camping setup, and I'd love some input from anyone who's used either (or both). I know most purists here go manual, but I'm specifically looking for something electric, compact, and USB-C powered mainly for ease of use while moving around or waking up half-asleep in a tent.

Here's what I've narrowed it down to:

**Staresso Discovery II**

•	Stainless steel burrs

•	\~5 grind settings (espresso to French press)

•	USB-C charging

•	18g capacity

•	Super lightweight and small (fits in a cup holder)

•	Priced slightly lower

**OutIn Fino**

•	48mm stainless steel burrs

•	15-click grind adjustment dial

•	USB-C charging

•	25g capacity

•	Magnetic catch cup (seems great for travel)

•	Runs quieter than most portables

What I'm Looking For:

•	Something compact but reliable for espresso and pour over

•	Consistency matters, I don't mind dialing in a bit, but I don't want wildly unpredictable results

•	Would be using it with a Nano portable espresso machine and sometimes with a V60 or Kalita Wave

•	Quiet operation and ease of cleanup are nice bonuses

•	Needs to perform decently without needing a power outlet all the time

My Dilemma:

•	The Staresso is super portable and cheaper, but I keep seeing mixed reviews about grind consistency, especially for espresso

•	The OutIn Fino has more precise adjustments and a slightly larger burr, but it's a little bulkier (and a touch more expensive)

Questions for the crowd:

•	Has anyone used either (or both)? Which one did you find more reliable day-to-day?

•	For camping or travel brewing, how do they perform battery-wise and grind retention-wise?

•	Is the adjustment dial on the OutIn actually accurate enough to dial in espresso?

•	Anything else I'm not considering?

I know hand grinders like the 1Zpresso or Timemore Chestnut are great, but I want to keep this specific purchase electric for convenience.

I usually keep it casual and meet at a cafe. But she said she didn’t like cafes because she drinks coffee at home while we were in the cafe. Like she agrees to meet me at the cafe but then gripes how she doesn’t like them while we were already in the cafe. She orders a latte and doesn’t even touch it and she then left in 45 minutes citing that she needed to let her dog out. So I thought she probably wasn’t into me. Then she texts me saying she had a great time and asked if I wanted to hang out again, in maybe an hour from the date. I said yes and she’s like then plan it. I then sent a message asking what she’s into and she doesn’t even tell me. Just expects me to do everything. I was already on the fence with her but now I am even more so. Like least you can do is tell me what you are into. I don’t need this more than you! I don’t understand this entitled behavior and ordering me around. I am not even going to bother.

Coffee, my back hurts, I feel like shit
The bus sucks, my knee's fucked, I'm over it
Matè, I clock in, this can't be it
So sick of the smell of Red Bull, of pizza and regret

Destroy my body, make enough to stay alive
When all I want is to be happy, but I never go outside
Because I'm
Always so fucking tired

I hate my job so I tend to self-medicate
But I gave up booze and weed
These days it's just to stay awake
All the Celsius and dirty chais make me feel like a joke
Everything I do all day I guess I owe to Diet Coke

Cause I'm not here right now
Leave a message at the beep
Cause if you talk to me
You're speaking to caffeine
And I just wanna get out
Of this fucking industry
So I guess I'll claw my way out
And when I'm dead is when I'll sleep

Cold brew convinced me to give it another day
But rent is due, the lease renewed, I'm stuck here anyway
While my soul 
It just decays

Just worked ten hours so when I come home it's late
I feed the cat, I want a nap
But that will have to wait
I do more work to prove my worth and make myself be seen
By a brand new group of mid-tier jerks, I need a cup of tea

Cause I'm not here right now
Leave a message at the beep
Cause if you talk to me
You're speaking to caffeine
And I just wanna get out
Of this fucking industry
So I guess I'll claw my way out
And when I'm dead is when I'll sleep

I can feel these late nights making me break
And bend
But I don't see another way out so caffeine
Is my friend
I write more, I punch-up
Then hit send
And I'll bet it's another diuretic that fuels my candle at both ends

Cause I'm not here right now
Leave a message at the beep
Cause if you talk to me
You're speaking to caffeine

And you, the listener. you’ve got problems. Real ones. we all do. We all go through it. Marriages that feel like cold war treaties. Debt, that’s growing like mold in a New Orleans apartment. Sins, you’ve fed so long, they’ve developed multiple personalities. But don’t you dare tell me you can’t handle it. Don’t you dare say “God will take care of it”, like it’s a get-out-of-action-free card. Sometimes, God does the work… through you. You don't get to sit out, or refuse to exhaust your efforts. You need to act. Act with purpose, with integrity, and with dedication. Some of the most pressing issues, require swift, decisive action.



Maybe your genocidal savage is discipline. Maybe it’s self-education. Maybe it’s raising your kids like their souls matter more than their soccer trophies. Maybe it’s having one awkward but truthful conversation that cuts through the fog, like a chainsaw in a pillow factory. But whatever it is, grab that tent peg, sharpen it. Swing it. Use it. Because the enemy ain’t sleeping forever. And Evil never rests.



 Don’t get it twisted, this story isn’t about glorifying violence. It’s about clarity. It's about finding  the courage to do what’s necessary, when everyone else is praying someone else steps up. You want revival? It won’t come from a YouTube algorithm. It’ll come from people like Jael. And People like you!



So if you’re listening to this on your way to a dead-end job, or while sipping black coffee with a mind full of bitterness, hear me when I say. This week, be Jael. Don’t be Sisera. Don’t be neutral. Don’t be numb. Don't be a tyrant. But Be dangerous, for the right reasons. God doesn’t need more followers. He needs warriors.



And I end this with a plead to you all to always remember, Jesus didn’t tap out, and neither will we! In a world where enemies walk in your tent thinking they’re safe, we sharpen our tent pegs, offer the milk… and drive the truth straight through the lies.

I’m crowdfunding to bring my unique coffee idea to life – something bold, exciting, and a little different from the usual café fare. This isn’t just about coffee – it’s about community, quality, and giving people an experience worth waking up for.

Whether you're a caffeine connoisseur, a tired parent, a student on a deadline, or just someone who loves a damn good brew – this project is for you. I’m on a mission to create something that stands out in the crowded coffee world, and I need your help to get it off the ground.

With your support, I’ll be able to [brief goal – e.g., launch a small-batch production, secure a pop-up space, develop my signature blend, etc.]. Every contribution brings me closer to making this dream a reality – one cup at a time.

Thanks for reading, and thanks for believing in something beautifully brewed. Let’s stir things up!

1lo49il,https://www.reddit.com/r/romancenovels/comments/1lo49il/scarlet_frost/,Scarlet Frost,"Julian Shaw, my husband, cheated on me. This fact, like a cold nail, drove hard into my heart. I stood outside his office door, my body rigid as if frozen in ice. The heel of my black high heel rubbed against the cold marble floor, making a tiny sound that was like the breaking of my heart. It was a long time before I lifted my hand and knocked softly on the heavy door.

""Come in."" His deep voice came from inside the door, with a hint of imperceptible fatigue.

I clutched the papers in my hand and opened the door with my other hand. With a forced smile, I stepped forward and placed the document in front of him.

""Busy? There are a few papers I need you to sign."" I acted so gentle and considerate that I even offered to turn the page for him to sign.

Julian had been on a business trip to Switzerland and only returned this morning. The moment he arrived back, he headed straight to the company to dive into work, his desk where a stack of documents already awaited him. His handsome face was visibly tired.

Without even checking the contents, he quickly signed his name.

""Great."" I said sincerely.

Putting away the papers, I posed the question casually,""Will you be home for dinner tonight?""

""I have plans tonight. Don't wait up."" His answer was terse and nonchalant.

""Okay, I'm out of here."" The moment I turned away, my smile twisted into a sneer, its warmth draining away like sand through an hourglass.

As I passed the break room in his office, I heard a small noise, like the light pulsation of a small animal. My gaze swept over the sofa area—the coffee table was cluttered with half-crushed snack bags and a congealed bubble tea, while a lone nude-pink stiletto lay toppled on the floor like a wounded flamingo mid-stride... It all went without saying. My heart sank completely into the cold abyss.

Back to my office, I felt all my strength had been evacuated. I slumped in the chair, letting out a long sigh of relief. From the pile of papers, I pulled out the divorce agreement and turned to the last page of the agreement.

1lo41sg,https://www.reddit.com/r/mounjarouk/comments/1lo41sg/appetite_like_a_toddlerkid/,Appetite like a toddler/kid,"Hi folks, for anyone who has experience of younger kids then you'll know what I mean when I say I have an appetite like a toddler.

I'm on week 10, doing well, losses are steady, but I find I go from having no appetite and not hungry for most of the day, to ravenous in 5mins flat. I'll eat 3-4 bites, and I am suddenly full up. I have zero interest in food, and when I do get hungry every sweet or savoury thing vs actual real food is the most delicious thing in the world... I know my 4yr old can relate 🤣

Let me be clear... I am NOT snacking on the sweet/savoury stuff which would obviously leave me hungry and in a similar cycle. And I know why it's more appealing than real food - because my body needs energy and calories NOW and those kinds of foods deliver quickly. Unfortunately it's also impacting my sleep as I will often wake because I'm hungry.

When I do get hungry I make sure I'm eating well (we call it eating energy food in our house), so plenty of protein, low GI, slow release carbs etc etc. But it's becoming frustrating because I don't get any hunger signals until I really am in the ""omg I need to eat NOW"" state, and I would be force feeding myself before that because food isn't appealing and I have no appetite. I was a serial snacker, I could always eat - even when I wasn't hungry - so this is a total mystery to me.

Similarly, my eyes remain bigger than my belly, and at times I'm just wasting food even with much smaller portions because I literally cannot eat after a few bites. Sometimes I will save it for later, but the lack of appeal of food means I often don't want it 🤷🏼‍♀️

Has anyone experienced something similar? Any suggestions on what I can change to break out of this cycle?

Examples of things I'm trying/eating/doing: I am not short in hydration, I get at least 2L of water in a day not counting herbal teas, coffee/tea and I get at least one clear whey protein in (18g protein and 400-500ml water). 
I'm lactose intolerant but I find the Alpro plant protein yogurts a great breakfast (15g protein) but it could take me over an hour to eat one. Sometimes it's full fat Greek yog and frozen berries. I always have a banana available, but I can manage to eat half at most. I do try to get some oats or nutty granola in as well that I make myself, for fibre and carbs, but I'm not always hungry enough to finish.
I usually eat a late lunch or early dinner which is turkey, chicken or maybe some steak or mince, some veggies and it's either with rice, in a wholemeal pitta or as a salad, might sprinkle on some cheese if I feel like it.",2,1751279296.0,mounjarouk,2,1.0,False

Dates, long late-night convos, sleepy coffees after movie marathons, hugs that actually felt like something. He used to say:  
*“You’re special”*,  
*“I’ve never talked to anyone like this before.”*  
And I believed it. But every time one of his friends asked, *“Is she your girlfriend?”*  
He’d smile and say, *“Nah, we’re just having a good time.”* When I asked him directly, he said:  
*“I like being with you. But I don’t want to label things. You know how it is these days.”* I stayed quiet. Hoping it would change. That he’d *realize*. But he didn’t. One day, after we spent the night together again, he texted:  
*“Hey, maybe don’t text me tomorrow. I’ve got a date with someone — just want to see how it feels. Hope that’s okay?”* I read it. Didn’t reply. Just blocked him. The next day he messaged me from another account:  
*“I was being honest. I never promised anything. Why are you mad?”* And later:  
*“I thought you were different. You were always so chill. Now you’re just like the rest — drama, block, whatever.”* I didn’t answer. But I still wonder… Did I overreact? Should I have handled it better?  
But the truth is — I’m not someone’s *almost*. I’m either valued, or I’m out.
