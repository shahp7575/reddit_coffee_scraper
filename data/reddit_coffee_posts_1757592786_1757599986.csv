I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig someday, but right now, I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. I'm pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, and music courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time, and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking, though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

Dark Souls 1 has been the last Souls game I never managed to finish. I’ve beaten the others, some several times, but this one always got away from me. I had played before but those damn archers in Andor Londo. I started a fresh run recently, determined to finally do it, and then in Anor Londo I got hacked. I got some humanity to kindle the bonfire and before I even got the chance to exit my menu I was invaded. Expecting a jolly good fight I ran around looking for some quality PVP. I didn't know anything until I got back stabbed and the guy just appeared. I thought nothing of it, just a hacker trolling.  So I respawned back at my bonfire before O&S where solaire is and he was gone, dead and his gear and humanity all that remained. I thought, maybe I messed up his quest somewhere and triggered his death. I go on to defeat O&S after seveal trys and expecting to see boba and the room was dark and angry and no boba!!! Ok, something weird is going on... I later realize.. the giant and the fire keeper are gone as well. I took to the interwebs to find out what could of happened and low and behold reddit dark souls sticky. I got uber hacked and it's the worst and I didn't have my game backed up. NPCs gone, quests ruined. I was frustrated and honestly thought about quitting again right there.  

But then I figured Solaire wouldn’t want me to give up, so I kept going. It's kind of the spirit of souls games to me, no matter how shitty it gets just don't give up. I also wanted to give a massive middle finger to the hacker that the joy he got from messing up my game didn't matter if I kept going. Every death, every boss, every confusing shortcut, I pushed through. And as of this morning at 7:00am before work on a fresh cup of coffee, I finally finished it. I placed the Lordvessel, faced Gwyn, and linked the fire. Dark Souls 1 is done.

This was my last unfinished Souls game and honestly, it feels a little emotional. It wasn’t the journey I expected, especially after losing those NPCs, but finishing it anyway made it hit even harder. I almost quit, but I didn’t, and I’m glad I stuck it out.

1ne9nwl,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/1ne9nwl/im_just_happy_you_guys_understand_the_term_trauma/,I’m just happy you guys understand the term “trauma bond”,"I’ve dealt with NPD through my ex and trauma bonding happens in any abusive dynamic, certainly with a narcissist. The way he would build me up and tear me down would sometimes happen within the same sentence. One time he came up to me apropos of nothing and starts telling me how wonderful I am because of this and that. I thought, wow, I’m just drinking my coffee and all this love is coming from nowhere. Then in the same breath he said “but if it wasn’t for me, you’d absolutely fly off the rails.” What’s the mind supposed to do with that? 

But in the case with BPD, the trauma bonding is so intense that I think you guys get it on a very visceral level because of the nature of the disorder. Their whole existence is made up of ups and downs and they eventually make you feel that way about yourself. One minute you are perfect, the next you are meaningless. Eventually you absorb that and if you have preexisting issues with inadequacy, you are doomed. Stuck in this cycle until you fight your way out. 

I just appreciate when I see this term used correctly because trauma bonding was at the crux of my last abusive relationship and the answer to the big question I get so much: “why did you stay?” So it does kinda bothers me when people see the term and take it literally and think it means bonding over trauma, which is just bonding and that’s nice. I don’t fault peeps for that, I think they should call it something else. If anyone has an idea as to what please share, lol. ",1,1757599402.0,BPDlovedones,0,1.0,False

1ne9lf3,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_JNJury978/comments/1ne9lf3/tttt/,TTTT,"They are definitely trying to invest in supply; they're just stuck with so many different conflicting limitations. Although all of these things are under the ""utility industry"" they really encompass several distinct industries of their own. So, I'll try to run through each at a high level.

Renewable sources are just not very economical. Most utility companies are generally able to cover their baseline demand. Highest peaking demand correlate with extreme weather, aka the hottest or coldest times of the year. When it's really cold, solar isn't very efficient (cause the sun isn't shining as long/bright as often), and even during the summer months, it can be incredibly hot even if the sun isn't shining. So why invest a lot of money into something that at best is really only helpful to \*maybe\* address your issue half the time. Hydro is definitely efficient, but there's only so many hydro plants you can build on a single river before you start negatively affecting your own generation as well as other river uses (recreation, logistics, etc.). Wind, like solar, is just not very reliable because wind is unpredictable. It also requires vast amounts of land, usually in places that are far out of reach from the utility companies themselves. Imagine the significant amount of resources required to acquire land, develop it, build the wind/solar generation, send crews out to maintain them halfway across the country, then cover the vast distances with transmission lines that also need maintenance, etc. all for something that only produces power some of the time. And again, it's not like utilities really need this to cover baseline; they need it for highest peaking demand. All-in-all, these just aren't great options because they require significant investment for not very reliable efficient output.

Coal was very economical, but the industry basically got killed. In the 2010s, there was a significant push to kill the industry. Trump tried to revive it in his first term (and even now he seems to be trying), but the damage has already been done. To meet EPA regulations, a lot of utilities shuttered their coal plants and invested heavily into that goal. It costs utilities billions of dollars and several years to decommission coal plants. The coal mines themselves are losing customers in droves; they're shutting down as well. So, now you have an industry where the coal suppliers are dwindling and workers have retired or left for other industries (and hardly any new green tradies/skilled labor wants to go into a dying industry). That means on top of investing billions of dollars into a new coal plant, they'd risk not being able to obtain fuel (coal) or labor; plus there's always no guarantee that politics will try to further bury the coal industry in the next 2-4 year cycle. 

Nuclear, to many, is the clear answer moving forward. And full disclosure, I tend to fall in this camp. The issue is that the cost of nuclear itself has grown exponentially higher. Consider that common folks are constantly complaining about how much real property prices have increased in the last 5 years. That's because of demand, cost of building, inflation, etc. All of those things also apply to a nuclear plant, except it's a highly specialized industry, so it's even more sensitive to those factors. For context, there were some estimates that it would cost less than $500 million to build a small modular reactor (aka a mini nuclear plant) 5-8 years ago. Today, it's estimated to cost $2 billion, and that's likely a conservative estimate. Now, that's just economical considerations. The biggest problem in my opinion is that the American populace hasn't really fully embraced nuclear. There's still so much fear around nuclear, and there's so much to unpack there it could be a whole series of books; but the short story is that this heavily affects utility companies' willingness to invest in a nuclear plant. Even though it costs a lot to build a nuclear plant, they produce clean and reliable power at a rate currently unmatched by any other source. But utility companies don't want to start investing billions of dollars in nuclear, only to (most assuredly) get significant public backlash and have to mothball the project aka wasting billions of dollars. 

Gas is the only thing left on the table. And indeed, this is what most utility companies have been investing in. But it also takes time and money to build these. IIRC, it costs $1-2 billion to build one of these. And because everyone is trying to build them, there's also a shortage of labor. One way to combat this is to acquire gas plants. In the past decade or so, there actually have been some companies that were created for the main purpose of building gas plants and selling them to utility companies (since they predicted there would be a hot demand for them, and they were right). The issue is that even with this in mind, the demand outpaces the supply. Utility companies are trying to build these as fast as they can, but it takes time. Now, keep in mind that utility companies know that gas-based generation were never really designed to provide baseline power (they were designed to be turned on/off quickly to meet peaking power), so the jury is still out on whether or not these things will last very long if they're run 24/7/365. And the fact that gas prices can also highly fluctuate. And let's not forget that while not as bad as coal, gas is also typically subject to environmental-based limitations. 

This goes to show just how much of a sucky place utility companies are in with the factors they're having to consider. They're willing to spend $1-2 billion each on gas plants that they know may not even work as long as they would like, and subject themselves to fluctuations in the fuel costs. Because they see that as the best choice given all of the options. And although, like I said I tend to believe in a nuclear solution, I objectively can't really blame them for making this decision. This is moreso a matter of survival, not profitability. I tried to give a flavor of costs for a reason (although obviously this is highly generalized, there will always be outliers in either direction). Consider that most utility companies' annual revenue are less than $25 billion, with the average probably being more like $10-15 billion or less. The problem of meeting demand requires a solution that costs a large percentage of this overall revenue, aka even if it's financially feasible, it opens the utility companies up to a large, if not unacceptable, level of risk. For example, IIRC, TVA's debt cap has been at $30 billion for many decades now, but there has been talks of raising it to something like $50-60 billion, just to address this issue. At the government-based interest rate, the \*interest payment alone\* on $60 billion dollars would be about $2-3 billion. TVA's annual revenue is about $10 billion, and TVA already faces significant financial challenges without being subject to that payment.

Anyway, I hope that was helpful in getting a big picture somehow. That might've been a little bit more ranty than I would've liked, and hopefully that didn't contain any significant errors (it's early morning for me and I haven't had my coffee yet). The main thing I wanted to get across was just that utility companies are trying to meet demand, it just takes time, and they're taking on an incredible amount of risk in doing so.

You won't notice it much, but it could be a possible explanation for why I can be weird from time (this shouldn't be an excuse by the way) Since we got that out of the way, *let us dive more into my persona*

 

***My persona***

I live in Central Europe, so due to my origin I'm able to speak German as well as English. I'm of Caucasian ethnicity, I have white skin, an average build at a height of 175 cm (or 5 ft 9 in) have medium-short brown hair on top, green-grey eyes with glasses on rare occasions & a short stubble face to round things off

 

***My lifestyle***

My occupation is something I can be very passionate about & really enjoy on a deep basis. When I'm not active due to work, I love to be active in my free time by going to the gym, going for a run or biking for example. Something I like to pair these activities with is listening to music or to a good podcast, but I usually prefer to watch rather than just listen to them. During the day I really love to drink a good cup of coffee somewhere or at home, so one day I will definitely buy myself a barista coffee machine. Currently I live on an omnivore diet, I like to cook & try different recipes. Next to that I have interests in psychology, philosophy, medicine, health & science to name a few

 

***My preferences***

I'm here looking for a female who is open to a long-term relationship aged between 18 - 28. Preferably from Europe, but I'm also open to females from (North) America. I want someone who is able to participate in a normal conversation & is emotionally available. Last but not least, someone who looks after their health & therefore has no emotional (lingering) baggage & maintains a rational normal weight

I just can’t feel comfortable when we go out knowing how much I paid.

# Synopsis

**Is it possible to kill an immortal?**

Cynthia lives to undo the immortality, to design a spell that will slay the *undying* death. Being a genius in rune magic is not enough, nor is the title of the youngest rune scholar. She needs to become something more.

The Death Knights exist to extinguish all life. The hollow vessels of doom veer toward civilization, bearing the flames of damnation. The seals of old times have come loose. The world is on the brink of war, the war once fought and won—if a shattered world and crippled civilization, yet recovering after millennia, could be considered that. The rulers claim them as myths, hiding their destruction in hopes of clinging to the wheel of the sinking ship until their final breath.

Cynthia wants to find a final solution, and there is no price she will hesitate to pay. But first, she needs to find a way to get rid of the screen that the System wants her to keep in the center of her vision at all times.

**\[Time remaining: 2160:00\]**

**——————————**

*The White Reaper is a journey. There are triumphs on the path, and pain and loss. The journey can be grim sometimes, but if you stick around long enough, you will witness the young scholar evolve into a world-renowned mage, magic spells that will flatten cities in a blink, and battles that will reshape the world. One step at a time.*

# Chapter 6

**\[Time Remaining: 2103:12\]**

Sageroot Village was about a two-day journey from Lesterforge on horseback. But a ruri could reach it in the span of half a day, provided the weather was clear and the bird healthy.

Around early morning, still about three hours away from the Sage Cliffs, Cynthia spotted a traveller’s stronghold in the shattered lands. The land was, for the most part, intact, but a few ruptures, like a giant had squeezed it like a cloth and then flattened it again. The crevices dove beyond the depth of the land itself, streaked around the barren, charcoal land. No tree as far as the eye could see, only broken shards of land hung in the sky, big enough to open up a farm, except it won’t bear any life. A small price for the Age of Magic.

Willow landed in front of the entrance. Cynthia slid off her back. She jerked her legs to fight off the stiffness. The stronghold was surrounded by a pair of tall walls with a gap in the middle, sandwiching a pit of spikes with a couple of monster carcasses visible in it. A vertical lift bridge led them inside. An artificial grass carpet was laid around the perimeter.

Willow hopped onto the grassy area to the side. There were buckets of water to drink from. Willow lowered her face to one, sniffed, and turned away, whistling apprehensively.

“I will get you something,” Cynthia mumbled as she stepped inside the tavern. It was early morning, so except for a few, everyone here was clean and well-kept, probably having stayed overnight at the inn that the upper floors of the stronghold served as.

She asked for water for Willow; the clean buckets were not free. She hadn’t packed breakfast, so she bought a light soup for herself and beast meat for Willow. She frowned at the price of the meat.

“First time travelling, eh?” The shopkeeper smiled. “We get so many dead monsters compared to buyers that it is more expensive to keep them in the cold storage.”

Cynthia nodded. “Can’t you sell it in the city?”

“Are you offering to protect the carts to the closest city, which does not have an overabundance of monster corpses?” He smiled. “I am sure poor steeds appreciate my offer. Do you wanna try our specialty?” ”

It was cheaper than the soup, somehow. Cynthia accepted.

“Where are you off to?”

“Cisa,” Cynthia uttered.

“Mage business?”

Cynthia shrugged. He was probably trying to make small talk rather than trying to pry something from her. Most of his guests at the tables seemed grumpy—hopefully only in the morning.

“Cisa, huh?” He nodded. “A group of knights raced through yesterday. Something going on there?”

Cynthia blinked. “Wraith Knights?”

“Hearth,” he asked, his eyes twinkling with interest.

“Unfortunately, I have no idea what Hearth’s business is,” Cynthia answered. Was Professor Ruthen’s disappearance public? The principal informed the entire school.

The shopkeeper relayed the order to a server boy, younger than her, missing an eye. The storekeeper stared at her, waiting for something. Cynthia tilted her head. He sighed heavily. “That’s a bit of a shame. It’s not the first rumor of them ramping through the Forge. Hopefully, we’re not at war.”

“There won’t be one,” Cynthia assured. “Unless the invaders have a few million prisoners they want to feed to monsters, there is nothing up south, only The Gorge, a Death Zone.”

“Yeah. There’s Durran, though, trying to share their prosperity with everyone, even when we don’t need it. Not that they are getting past Cisa,” He nodded.

Cynthia frowned.

“Is there a chance we do lose, miss...”

Durran was not at war; there couldn’t be one until the Duke was in control. “Durran is a trading hub. If they invade a foreign nation, I am afraid they would be wiped from the face of Qinrath before their army touches our territory.”

He chuckled. Once someone else walked over, Cynthia withdrew to a secluded corner table.

She was served a bowl of soup with far too many pieces of meat. And much to her dismay, it didn’t taste all that great. Spices would be outrageously expensive in the middle of nowhere. Cynthia forced down the tender, tasteless meat with water. She felt as though she had been told everything up front, yet why did she feel cheated?

After finishing her breakfast, she decided to stick around for another hour, allowing Willow to rest. While Willow was a ruri, she had flown for over an hour a few times in her life.

Most of the conversation around the dining hall was about the Hearth Knights, and other small incidents—most of it about dead people and caravans struck by monsters. Especially Lenthrals, which seemed to have gone rabid.

A woman wearing a cowl over her head settled into the opposite chair. “Hello.” Her voice was flat. Unemotive.

Cynthia peered at the strange person carefully. The blank, featureless mask provided her an answer: a veteran Realm Traveller who was granted the Traveller’s Facade.

“Hello,” Cynthia said politely.

“What were you talking with—” the woman gestured at the barkeeper, now busy boring another customer—“man?”

“Nothing important. Just the rumors… that seem to be the subject of utmost importance for everyone.”

“Not you?”

“I am… Well, the Hearth Knights are inexperienced. It is not far-fetched for them to ride out and test their mettle against the tribal creatures, worshipers of Dead Gods,” Cynthia answered. The waiter placed her coffee on the table, leaving with a small bow to the Realm Traveller.

“Hm,” the woman nodded. “Student of the Lunaspire?”

“Can I help you?”

“Well,” the Realm Traveller pointed outside at the blaring sun, “I am here to inspect the warding system.”

“Is something wrong?”

“It is worn out.”

“I see.”

“To spare myself the trouble of travelling back and forth, I am willing to offer you a commission.”

“I am not a member.”

The Realm Traveller whistled. “That’s just great.” Her voice was still flat and unemotive due to the mask. “Then… *can* you do it?”

Cynthia considered. She could use some money, and at best, it would be an hour of work. Less, if she were fortunate. Even a Realm Traveller could only guess the condition with the Rune Veil fizzling out the runes from direct observation. “What are you willing to pay?”

“Usually, it is somewhere between two hundred and five hundred flints.”

“How do you know I can work with runes?”

The Realm Traveller chuckled—perhaps the eeriest laugh Cynthia had ever heard, void of humanity. “You reek of blood, but no passion. Either a monster in human skin, or a rune scribe with no concern for her skin.”

“I am just a student,” Cynthia said tonelessly. “Two hundred flints is not enough to buy a single runejade.”

“Three.”

“I will decide after assessing the condition of the resonance device.”

“That parrot just scammed you,” The realm traveller slammed her head on the table as if that was supposed to mean something.

The warding mechanism was at the top of the roof. A standing lamp with a sky-facing umbrella design, six square plates fitted together. Strongholds were established above a materia mine. The pole was running through the building walls and down into the mine, which would power the wards. Without it, strongholds would not be able to sustain the cost of safety.

Cynthia paused. She regarded it from a distance. Then at a closer distance. “Did you touch it?”

“Inspection duty.”

Cynthia nodded. Using her quill, she unlinked the linking chain that had been thoroughly abused, probably by inspectors in the past. It came into her hand—a silver metal, cold, and chipped away at the corners. “They are worn out. You should tell your employer to have it replaced before the next inspection.”

She slid out the jade plate. Each jade plate had a rune chain etched on its surface with the blood ink. With time, the natural causes wore down the runes. The linking chain combined the jade plates, allowing multiple spells to run in parallel, which was the warding system.

“It is done poorly. I want twelve hundred Flints.”

“You’re pushing it. How about five?”

“I apologize if it sounds rude, but you can hire a cheaper rune scribe, with crude ink, and do it over every three weeks. Or I do it, and you will not have to worry about it for the next six months.” The regular inspection type of job was signed on a contractual basis for a definite period.

The realm traveller huffed. “Bullshit. You don’t even have a working ink pen. Are you really trying to sell yourself as better than the commission’s rune scribe?”

“Are you not here after three weeks?” Cynthia asked.

“That’s the standard time for inspection. Look, I don’t want to travel back to Cisa. Six hundred. How about it?”

Cynthia slotted the jade plate in its spot. “It’s good money for an hour of *time*,” Cynthia clipped the linking chains. She fished out her inkpot. “I feel bad, so...” She flipped the uncorked bottle. And waited. But nothing poured out of it.

“The ink...”

“The pen will not work under this temperature. Blood ink becomes thick as the temperature climbs, and, in this place, winter still is warm. You can add thinner, which will dilute the strength. It’s good for their business, even if it is insulting to the sacred nature of rune magic.”

“I have never heard of such a problem. Why would you need density…” the realm traveller paused. “For the lasting effects of the runes. Shit!” She turned around, hurling curses at the imaginary rune scribe. Cynthia was sure the surreal experience would stay with her for years. To witness someone shout such vulgar words at the top of their voice without a sliver of anger was quite the dissonance.

“I will be leaving then.” Cynthia stepped to the side and made her way to the exit, around the realm traveller.

“Wait. Fine. Whatever you said. I will pay for it. But if it doesn’t last five months.”

“It should.”

The realm traveller stared at her. Her hidden face made her creepier than she really was, hopefully. “Guess, I will have to take your word for it.”

“I will be done in an hour.”

For the duration the warding system will be completely down. The realm traveller’s actual role was for what came after.

Materiality accreted on everything like a layer of dust on furniture of an abandoned house. It weighed on things. Its nature changed from material to material, form to form, shadeless sponge soaking the dye it fell on. In most day-to-day objects, it did nothing. But runejades and jade plates used material to reach their form. Runes were not drawn simply on the surface. The tip of her quill was crafted from a metal that could easily carve into the runejades. Runejades then used the materia accreted on its dimensions to fix itself. In a matter of hour, it fixed itself. Once it did, the ink would smear, and the rune would be ruined. The nature of runejades made it impossible for spells to be stockpiled, or even for a less practiced rune scribe to draw complicated runes.

The jade slates were slightly less effective in nature, manufactured with a certain level of impurity. It did not allow the flexibility of a runejade and required a great source of power, but for sustained spells that lasted for decades sometimes, the trade-offs were well worth the drawbacks.

“Here’s your payment,” the realm traveller gave her a card. By depositing it in any station of the Realm Travelling Commission, she would be able to withdraw her money. “I take many commissions for implementation and maintenance of wards, and well, many things. Are you interested in working with me?”

“Thank you for your generous offer. It just happened to fill the blank time. I am not interested in working as a realm traveller.”

The realm traveller gave her a metal card. A series of numbers and signs was etched on it. “If you are ever interested, leave me a message at any commission.”

“Someday, then,” Cynthia nodded. “I hope you have better luck at finding rune scribes in the future.”

After buying a less-than-pleasing lunch, she departed from the traveller’s stronghold.

“The Wring Webs litter the sky from this point on,” the realm traveller had warned her. “Please do not be reckless, Willow.”

The ruri nodded her head. Willow could sense magic better than most mages—the younger ones—so it was not really a problem for her to know where a large swirl of flesh-ripping invisible vortex of space might be.

The red, blaring sun grew ever harsher even in the winter, coating the lands and skies with a shade of blood red. What made it so angry? Sometimes Cynthia couldn’t help but wonder. Yet, even it could not hide the pulsing wound overhead. Now, it seemed hideous, in pain, and worsening under the sunlight.

Willow periodically paused in the air, circling the empty space.

“Is that a Wring?”

Willow nodded, heavily.

“I want to test it. Would you mind stopping for a minute?”

Willow did, though her coo had an urgency to it.

Cynthia opened her purse. She ripped a page from her notebook, squeezed it into a ball, and flung it into the empty sky.

There was a slow, painful hum. She still saw nothing—except for the fate of the paper. It stretched like a swelling wound, ripped into chunks, each one bigger and thicker than the page had been. It shrank again as it moved deeper, coiling in the veins of the Wring. The low hum remained constant, thrumming the air as it flew past, quivering on her skin, nails, teeth, and hair. The page turned into a lump of wet soil, more than it was, fluffier than it should have been.

Something inside her expected a scream from the page—a delusion, Cynthia considered. Of course, a paper can’t scream.

“Let’s go,” Cynthia said. She eyed the air a little more cautiously. Even with her eyes, she was in a dark room, not knowing what might bite her if she extended her hand.

A little farther, she witnessed the fate of the paper again—on an old bird—yet there was no squawk, only a low thrum that danced on her skin, nails, teeth, and hair. The lump of red mud lingered in her mind the entire way, overshadowing any awe she might have felt at the lake trickling into the sky, caught in a Wring. It sprayed the water on a small colony of worms.

At some point, they went past the grey rock hills and valleys and into the wilderness of Emerald Hold. It was late afternoon by then.

The Sage Cliffs were moss-covered peaks in the middle of the forest.

Willow circled around the tip, landing on a perch of land like a snake's fanned face. Willow used her talons to cut off the lively vines covering it.

“Thank you, Willow,” Cynthia climbed down. Her shoes soaked as they pressed into the spongy moss. An earthly scent tickled her nose, of moss and rot. The edge led down at least a few hundred meters, where she would fall onto cushioned trees. “Maybe, there was a storm.”

Even though it was winter.

The green forest stretched as far as she could see, creeping up the mountains and ravines. The rays of the sinking sun danced on the leaves, shimmering the forest in a tint of gold. Despite her efforts, it took her an entire day to travel here.

Cynthia breathed shallowly. “It’s beautiful. Don’t you think so?”

Willow chirped.

“Though, if I say this was the only reason we travelled so far in the middle of the week, you will probably kick me off.”

Willow nodded. A proud coo came from her chest.

Cynthia’s faint smile flattened as she turned her head southwards, where Sageroot village was supposed to be, according to the map she had borrowed.

A splotch of black mass floated in the sky, writhing and wrenching—a visible Wring, Cynthia had initially assumed. But from this distance, still at least a few miles away, she could see splashes of black escaping and diving back into the mass. The glob of almost viscous density thrummed with energy, a high-pitched, bone-crawling chorus sung by thousands, tens of thousands, of those red-eyed blights.

“Death Blights.”

I thought we were doing well financially but since reading some posts here I’m not sure. 
I’m 34f currently on maternity leave getting Centrelink PPL but payments due to finish payments in 2 months. 112k in super and 17k in ETFs. Currently no super since April and no super on PPL
Partner is 34m working full time 150K gross. I think about 120k super. 
5 month old. 

We own a 2 bed apartment and pay $1200 a week mortgage (Sydney is crazy) on 5.59% with 100K in offset. Can’t refinance as only had property for a year and I have no income so difficult to get a new mortgage. I Will return to work in January and will earn about 60K -70K part time take home post tax and HECS/HELP. 

We hope to have another baby in the next 2 years so I imagine I would be part time for a number of years. Daycare around here is about $200 - day and we will probably get about 57% back post childcare subsidy for 2 days a week (grandparent another 2 days).

We try to budget and spend <$160-180 on groceries a week. I eat out a bit but only a coffee here and there on maternity leave and maybe one takeout meal together week.

We have $960k left on our 29 year mortgage. We are currently happy with our property and no desire to move but ideally would like a house in the next 8–10 years somewhere lower-mid north shore Sydney.

Would this ever be an achievable goal? What else should be our focus?

Picture the scene: A carpenter storms into a holy temple, overturning tables. Money scatters across marble floors as he fashions a whip and violently drives out the money-worshiping merchants. His voice thunders accusations at the religious elite: “You brood of vipers! Whitewashed tombs!” This same man would later face down the Sanhedrin itself, choosing death over compromise. He was not simply confronting individuals; he was actively uprooting the entrenched systems of control—challenging not only the religious authorities but the very structure and foundation of religion as it existed in his time.

Yet walk into any modern church, and you’ll find a Jesus scrubbed clean of his revolutionary fire—a gentle pacifist who wouldn’t hurt a fly, preaching nothing but unconditional acceptance. This isn’t the faith Jesus taught—it’s sedation sold as salvation. Modern churches have adopted a hippie ethic, creating environments of comfort and universal love that demand nothing significant and judge nothing important, producing a generation of cowardly sheep. Many remain in denial about the original sources of evil—those systems and leaders Jesus contended with remain the root cause of the current perversions that threaten the world.

⸻

**The Great Deception: How We Neutered the Lion of Judah**

Modern Christianity has committed theological treason. We’ve transformed history’s most dangerous revolutionary into a harmless hippie, and the results are catastrophic. When churches preach “love and tolerance” while child trafficking networks operate with impunity and Christians retreat into compliant silence, corruption devours society—and we’ve become everything Jesus opposed.

The evidence is overwhelming. In Matthew 10:34, Jesus declares with unmistakable clarity: “Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I have not come to bring peace, but a sword.” These aren’t the words of a pacifist—they’re the battle cry of a warrior who understood that true love sometimes requires war, and always demands the uprooting of corrupt systems.

Some might say: “But didn’t Jesus teach us to turn the other cheek?” Yes—when addressing personal insult. He was showing how to overcome ego, not how to tolerate institutional evil. When Jesus encountered systemic injustice, he didn’t turn cheeks—he overturned tables. The Gospel isn’t an escape from confrontation; it’s a mandate for holy resistance.

Consider the money changers again. Jesus didn’t politely request they leave. He didn’t organize a peaceful protest or file a complaint with temple authorities. He crafted a weapon and used force. The God of love wielded righteous violence because evil demands it. This wasn’t chaotic aggression—it was deliberate, strategic, and just.

⸻

**The Comfort Trap: How Modern Christians Chose Slavery Over Struggle**

Today’s believers, shaped by Hippie Theology, have made a devil’s bargain: comfort in exchange for contention. They quote 1 Peter 2:21—“Christ suffered for you, leaving you an example, that you should follow in his steps”—but then immediately seek the opposite of suffering. Modern Christians cling to the doctrine of vicarious atonement, using it as a theological loophole to offload personal responsibility for confronting evil and enduring the hardships that faith demands.

Feel-good sermons and prosperity gospel promises have replaced the narrow, difficult path Jesus actually walked. This isn’t accidental—it’s apostasy. James 4:4 couldn’t be clearer: “Friendship with the world is enmity with God.” Yet modern Christians chase worldly approval with desperate hunger. They water down biblical truth to avoid social backlash. They remain silent on moral issues to preserve their careers. They’ve become friends of the very world system that Jesus died to overthrow.

The cost? A Christianity so toothless it’s become irrelevant. When the church won’t take stands, evil fills the vacuum.

⸻

**Intellectual Cowardice: The Death of Christian Discourse**

Perhaps nowhere is modern Christianity’s betrayal more evident than in believers’ retreat from intellectual battle. Jesus engaged the sharpest minds of his day—Pharisees, Sadducees, Rabbis—and defeated them through superior knowledge and unshakeable conviction. He didn’t hide in religious echo chambers or rely on other people’s arguments. He studied, he reasoned, he debated.

Today’s Christians do the opposite. Rather than developing deep biblical knowledge and engaging in secular thought, they retreat into safe spaces, sharing a pastor’s YouTube clips instead of forming original thoughts. They avoid challenging conversations, preferring the comfort of preaching through a third party. This intellectual laziness isn’t humility—it’s cowardice. And it’s exactly what secular forces count on. While Christians share memes, others study philosophy, master rhetoric, and shape culture. The result? A public square dominated by voices that see Christianity as their enemy, largely because Christians abandoned the intellectual battlefield.

⸻

**The Revelation Deception: How Prophecy Became an Excuse for Inaction**

The Book of Revelation has become Christianity’s greatest strategic weakness. Too many believers read its prophecies of end-times tribulation and conclude that fighting evil is futile.

“It’s all prophesied,” they shrug. “We just need to wait for Jesus to return and fix everything.”

This defeatist theology has produced a generation of Christian bystanders. Political corruption? “God’s plan.” Pharmaceutical subversion? “Prophecy fulfilling.” Moral decay? “Birth pains of the end times.”

Every crisis becomes an excuse for inaction, every defeat proof that surrendering is inevitable.

But Jesus didn’t model resignation—he modeled resistance through sacrificial victory. In Gethsemane, he prayed fervently—but then he acted decisively. His path to the cross wasn’t passive resignation to fate; it was strategic sacrifice for ultimate triumph. He fought, died, and provided the example.

⸻

**The Call to Arms: Reclaiming Christianity’s Warrior Spirit**

The world doesn’t need more passive believers content with soft chairs, coffee, and a feel-good PowerPoint. It needs spiritual warriors willing to follow Jesus’s actual example: confronting corruption, exposing hypocrisy, protecting the vulnerable, and yes—making enemies of those who profit from injustice and worship money.

This warrior spirit isn’t new—it’s part of the prophetic tradition. The prophets called out kings, stood against national sins, and wept over injustice. The early church was accused of “turning the world upside down.” The apostles were jailed, beaten, and executed not for preaching love, but for threatening power.

This is the legacy we’ve forgotten.

It means embracing the suffering that 1 Peter 4:1 identifies as spiritual armor:

“Since Christ suffered in his body, arm yourselves also with the same attitude, because whoever suffers in the body is done with sin.”

Love, in the biblical sense, is not passive. It protects. It rebukes. It fights. Real love wields a sword when the innocent are under attack.

Look around. Human trafficking networks operate openly. Corporate greed ravages communities while churches remain silent. Corruption festers in political systems as believers retreat into private spirituality.

Where is your righteous anger?

How many tables have you flipped?

When will you translate conviction into strategic, embodied action?

⸻

**The Warrior’s Path Forward**

The path ahead requires courage modern Christianity has forgotten how to summon. It means:

• Recognize and confront patterns of evil. Develop vigilance to identify repeating strategies used by corrupt systems. True warriors confront not just isolated actions but entrenched patterns that perpetuate suffering.

• Fuel your actions with righteous anger. Let the fire Jesus displayed—anger at injustice, exploitation, subversion, and hypocrisy—drive you to overturn the tables of corruption wherever they stand.

• Speak boldly when others whisper or stay silent. Truth doesn’t need qualifiers or apologies. Proclaim it with the same authority Jesus displayed when confronting the Pharisees, Rabbis, and Sadducees.

• Act decisively when others debate endlessly. Study the issues, form biblical convictions, then move. Paralysis by analysis serves evil’s purposes perfectly.

• Embrace conflict when others seek false peace. Real love sometimes requires temporary discomfort to prevent permanent damage. A surgeon’s knife causes pain but saves lives.

• Reject compromise with systems that destroy human flourishing. Jesus didn’t negotiate with money worshippers—he expelled and beat them. Some evils deserve no quarter.

• Build coalitions of like-minded warriors. Surround yourself with others who understand that discipleship means warfare, not acquiring fire insurance in hopes of avoiding Hell.

⸻

**The Choice Before Us**

Christianity stands at a crossroads. Down one path lies continued retreat into irrelevance—a hippie faith that avoids being offensive, offers comfort but demands nothing, that speaks of love but tolerates evil, that promises Heaven while surrendering Earth. Down the other path lies the way of the true Christ—the rebel who challenged the system, the warrior who conquered death, the king whose kingdom is not of this world, but whose impact on this world was revolutionary.

The choice is yours.

Will you follow the sanitized Jesus of modern Christianity into enslavement labeled as love, or will you follow the Warrior Christ of the Gospels?

Will you seek comfort, or will you bear the cross?

Will you wear a jersey from the sidelines, or will you wield a sword in the arena?

The world doesn’t need your good intentions.

It needs your righteous fury followed with action. It needs your willingness to suffer for truth. It needs *Warriors of Light* who understand that sometimes love requires war.

The revolution is on its way.. The question is: Are you ready to join it?

“And from the days of John the Baptist until now the Kingdom of Heaven suffers violence, and the violent take it by force.” – Matthew 11:12

Will you defend the Kingdom and join the *Warriors of Light*, or will you remain amongst the peaceful hippies who compromise the fight?",1,1757598520.0,divineawakening,0,1.0,False
1ne9ail,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_tipstor/comments/1ne9ail/eat_soft_petals_at_white_rose_under_floating/,Eat Soft Petals at White Rose Under Floating Lanterns,"Lanterns ignite the dusk over Hội An like signal fires, flickering on boats afloat and in old streets slick with history and incense smoke. Vietnam welcomed more than 17.5 million international visitors in 2024, a 39.5 percent leap from the year before, according to the Vietnam National Authority of Tourism (VNAT) via multiple reports including Nhan Dan. The country has surged back to 98 percent of its pre-pandemic levels and Hội An rides this wave, fishing boats, river cruises and foodie nights swelling its heartbeat.

Float along the Thu Bon River in twilight on a lover’s style boat for about USD 45 per person with dinner included. Or hop on a shorter river cruise that runs USD 30 to catch paper lanterns dancing on water. Rice paper flowers open in your throat in the form of white rose dumplings. Steamed petals of pork or shrimp tucked into translucent dumpling skin, dipped in nuoc cham and crushed chili. For about USD 2 to USD 4 per plate depending on where you eat. Street vendors glow under lantern webs. Restaurants by the riverfront charge more. But the flavor is venomous in its sweetness.

Adventure doesn’t stay on boats. Cyclo-tours through ancient town and countryside trail villages cost around USD 25. Cooking classes in family kitchens run near USD 20 where hands smell of garlic and lime and knives don’t sleep. Lantern lantern festivals sweep through in summer and autumn and turn alleys into rivers of color.

Best season to wander under lanterns and eat white rose is February through April and again September through October. Dry months rule meaning skies are clearer, humidity backs off just enough, and the crowds are lively without elbowing. Monsoon months hit like finales you didn’t expect. Flashes of rain, thunder rolling through metal roofs, and food stalls disappearing under tarp until the sky calls off.

Food here is singular. Cao lầu noodles chew with texture, drenched in a broth that trembles with herbs and pork crackle. Bun cha, fresh herbs, grilled fish with lemongrass. When fresh seafood smacks hot off coals, maybe USD 8 to USD 12. Egg coffee in little cups lets bitterness linger. USD 2 or so. Bananas foster or lemonade fizzed with passion fruit curl in your mouth like secrets.

Accommodation closes heavy at night. Guesthouses in Hội An Ancient Town go for about USD 40 to USD 80 per night midweek. Boutique riverside hotels climb to USD 120 to USD 180 when lanterns brighten and boats crowd riverbanks. Book with urgency when festivals near.

Vietnam plots a course to welcome 23 million international visitors in 2025, VNAT reports, riding exponential returns from open visa policy and aggressive promotion. Statistics reflect growth. But what you carry from Hội An isn’t in numbers. It’s in peppered sweat, lantern reflections, comfort found in dumplings, and nights that taste like dusk.

The buzzing of the neon tube above her was louder than the voices of the guests. An endless, nervous flicker that kept exposing the cracks in the ceiling. The smell of old grease hung heavy in the air, mixed with stale beer and cheap perfume.

Sarissa balanced two plates through the narrow aisle, her fingers clamped around the porcelain as if she wanted to crush it. A drop of sauce slid over her hand; she wiped it away with the back of her wrist without slowing down. Her eyes skimmed the tables, over faces already fading from memory.

“Excuse me, another beer.”
“Could we get some salt?”
“Any chance this could go faster?”

The words bounced off her. On the outside she looked routine, almost unaffected. Inside, something stretched taut—a thin wire ready to snap.

As she passed the counter, she stopped for a moment. Her gaze caught in the mirror behind the bottles. For a fleeting second she didn’t see the tired waitress with greasy split ends. She saw a stranger trying to hold everything together—who had already long since collapsed.

Her lips curled faintly, almost a bitter smile. A thought flashed: So this is what you look like when you’ve given up.

“Sarissa?”
A voice pulled her back. Jan. He stood by the coffee machine, smiling that harmless, almost shy smile of his. His hands looked awkward, as if they never knew where to go.
“Tough night, huh?” His voice was soft, almost childlike in its naivety.

“As always.”

Jan gave a short laugh, more uncertain than cheerful. “Still… I think it’s crazy how you do it. Always so… I don’t know, strong, I guess.”

She shrugged. Strong. The word clung to her like a note that wouldn’t stick.

“Sarissa?” He scratched his neck, as if courage might be hiding there. “Maybe… after your shift. We could… I don’t know, catch a movie or something?”

She looked at him, really looked, for the first time. That smile that couldn’t hurt anyone. Those eyes that didn’t know malice. He was harmless. Harmless enough that she didn’t have to push him away.

“We’ll see,” she muttered.

Jan nodded quickly, as if she had already given him more than he’d hoped for. “So… maybe Friday? I mean, I don’t know if you can, but… ah, forget it. Just a thought.”

“I’ve got late shift Friday.”

“Ah, okay… then maybe Saturday? There’s this event, you know, the ads are everywhere. Probably fun.” He talked himself into it, words stumbling out as if he had to fill the silence with anything.

Sarissa watched him, unmoving, while he rambled. A small part of her wondered how long he’d keep going if she never answered.

In the end she just lifted her bag. “I’ll think about it.”

This time Jan nodded slower, as though trying to grab the promise out of the air. “Yeah… sure. Just think about it.”

She left him behind and stepped out into the wet night.

The air smelled of rain and old cigarette smoke. Puddles reflected the flicker of the streetlights, half of them broken or crooked. Torn bags littered the pavement, a beer can rolled against a wall in the wind.

Sarissa pulled her jacket tighter. Her footsteps echoed between the rows of houses, too loud for the emptiness. Somewhere, music leaked from a window—dull, cheap, as if someone tried to drown out the decay.

She thought about the day she had just survived. Voices, plates, shifts, numbers. All the same, all endless. A movie with Jan. The phrase clung to her mind like a scrap of paper on wet asphalt. Harmless, naïve—and yet heavier than she wanted to admit.

At a corner she stopped. The stench of wet concrete and drains rose around her. Somewhere glass shattered, then silence. Tension tightened her neck as if someone walked behind her. But when she turned, there was only darkness, broken by the hiss of a lamp.

Her heart sped up as she moved on. Sometimes it felt like the whole city was watching her. But no one did. No one but the night, wrapping her in its cold breath.

She exhaled sharply and quickened her pace. The rain had stopped, yet the pavement clung damp beneath her shoes. Every step reminded her she only wanted to get home—and that nothing waited there but silence.

In front of the building she noticed a cat. Curled in the shadows by the door, little more than bones beneath its matted fur, eyes sharp as shards. It didn’t even lift its head as she passed, only its tail twitched faintly—a last flicker of mistrust.

When Sarissa opened the door, movement startled her. The cat darted forward, slipping past her legs inside. It wasn’t begging, it wasn’t pleading—more like it had simply decided that this was how things would be.

It followed her up the stairs step by step, a patient shadow. At the apartment door she tried to block it with her foot, but the creature slid through the gap faster than she could react, as if it had rehearsed this.

Inside, it stopped. Paws damp, body thin, eyes shamelessly wide.

Sarissa stared back. For a moment it was as if something reflected there she didn’t want to name—hunger, weariness, that defiant emptiness whispering: I’ll survive anyway.

She exhaled, tossed her keys on the table, shrugged off her jacket. “Do what you want.”

The cat curled up in a corner, half-closed its eyes, and did exactly that.



Kapitel 1

Das Summen der Neonröhre über ihr war lauter als die Stimmen der Gäste. Ein endloses, nervöses Flackern, das die Risse in der Decke immer wieder sichtbar machte. Der Geruch von altem Fett hing schwer in der Luft, gemischt mit abgestandenem Bier und billigem Parfüm.

Sarissa balancierte zwei Teller durch den engen Gang, die Finger klammerten sich um den Rand, als wollte sie das Porzellan zerdrücken. Ein Tropfen Soße rann über ihre Hand, sie wischte ihn mit dem Handrücken weg, ohne langsamer zu werden. Ihre Augen glitten über die Tische, über Gesichter, die schon jetzt vergessen waren.

„Entschuldigung, noch ein Bier.“
„Könnten wir Salz bekommen?“
„Geht das vielleicht ein bisschen schneller?“

Die Worte prallten an ihr ab. Von außen wirkte sie routiniert, beinahe unbeeindruckt. Innen spannte sich etwas an, ein dünner Draht, der jederzeit reißen konnte.

Als sie an der Theke vorbeiging, blieb sie kurz stehen. Ihr Blick verhakte sich im Spiegel hinter den Flaschen. Für einen Moment sah sie nicht die Bedienung mit dem müden Ausdruck und den fettigen Haarspitzen. Sie sah eine Fremde, die versuchte, alles zusammenzuhalten – und die doch schon längst am Boden lag.

Ihre Lippen verzogen sich kaum merklich, fast wie ein bitteres Lächeln. Ein kurzer Gedanke flackerte auf: So siehst du also aus, wenn du aufgibst.

„Sarissa?“
Eine Stimme riss sie raus. Jan. Er stand neben der Kaffeemaschine, lächelte dieses harmlose, fast schüchterne Lächeln, das ihm eigen war. Seine Hände wirkten unbeholfen, als wüsste er nie recht, wohin damit.
„War ein harter Abend, oder?“ Seine Stimme war weich, fast kindlich in ihrer Naivität.

„Wie immer.“

Jan lachte leise, ein Laut, der eher unsicher war als fröhlich. „Trotzdem… ich find’s krass, wie du das machst. Immer so… keine Ahnung, stark halt.“

Sie zuckte mit den Schultern. Stark. Das Wort blieb an ihr hängen, wie ein Zettel, der nicht kleben wollte.

„Sarissa?“ Er kratzte sich im Nacken, als könnte er dort Mut finden. „Vielleicht… nach der Schicht. Wir könnten… Kino oder so?“

Sie sah ihn an, zum ersten Mal richtig. Dieses Lächeln, das niemandem wehtun konnte, diese Augen, die nichts Böses kannten. Er war harmlos. Harmlos genug, dass man ihn nicht zurückstoßen musste.

„Mal sehen“, murmelte sie.

Jan nickte hastig, als hätte er schon mehr Antwort bekommen, als er erwartet hatte. „Also… vielleicht Freitag? Ich mein… ich hab keine Ahnung, ob du da kannst, aber…“ Er grinste entschuldigend. „Ach, vergiss es. War nur so’n Gedanke.“

„Freitag hab ich Spätschicht.“

„Ah, okay… dann vielleicht Samstag? Da läuft ein Event, weißt du, so eins mit… ach, keine Ahnung, die Werbung läuft überall. Wird bestimmt witzig.“ Er redete sich fest, Worte stolperten über seine Lippen, als wollte er die Stille mit irgendetwas füllen.

Sarissa sah ihn an, reglos, während er redete. Ein kleiner Teil von ihr fragte sich, wie lange er wohl so weiterplaudern würde, wenn sie einfach nichts sagte.

Am Ende hob sie nur die Tasche hoch. „Ich denk drüber nach.“

Jan nickte wieder, diesmal langsamer, als wolle er das Versprechen in der Luft greifen. „Ja… klar. Denk einfach drüber nach.“

Sie ließ ihn zurück, trat hinaus in die nasse Nacht.

Die Luft roch nach Regen und altem Zigarettenrauch. Pfützen spiegelten das flackernde Licht der Laternen, die Hälfte davon war kaputt oder schief montiert. Auf dem Gehweg lagen zerfetzte Tüten, eine Bierdose rollte im Wind gegen die Mauer.

Sarissa zog die Jacke enger um sich. Ihre Schritte hallten zwischen den Häuserzeilen, zu laut für die Leere. Hier und da drang Musik aus einem Fenster, dumpf, billig, als würde jemand versuchen, den Zerfall zu übertönen.

Sie dachte an den Tag, den sie gerade hinter sich hatte. Stimmen, Teller, Schichten, Zahlen. Alles gleich, alles endlos. Kino mit Jan. Das Wort blieb in ihrem Kopf hängen wie ein Papierfetzen am nassen Asphalt. Harmlos, naiv – und trotzdem schwerer, als sie zugeben wollte.

Vor einer Straßenecke blieb sie stehen. Der Geruch von nassem Beton und Abfluss stieg ihr in die Nase. Irgendwo in der Ferne klirrte Glas, dann Stille. Sie spürte, wie ihr Nacken sich spannte, als würde jemand hinter ihr gehen. Doch als sie sich umdrehte, war da nur Dunkelheit, durchbrochen vom Zischen einer Laterne.

Ihr Herz schlug schneller, als sie weiterging. Manchmal habe ich das Gefühl, die ganze Stadt schaut mir nach. Aber niemand tat es. Niemand außer der Nacht, die sie mit kaltem Atem umschloss.

Sie atmete scharf aus und beschleunigte ihre Schritte. Der Regen hatte aufgehört, doch das Pflaster klebte feucht unter ihren Schuhen. Jeder Schritt erinnerte sie daran, dass sie nur noch heim wollte – und dass dort auch nichts anderes wartete als Stille.

Vor dem Gebäude hatte sie eine Katze bemerkt. Zusammengekauert im Schatten neben der Tür, abgemagert bis auf die Knochen, das Fell verfilzt, die Augen hell wie Scherben. Sie hob nicht einmal den Kopf, als Sarissa an ihr vorbeiging, nur der Schwanz zuckte schwach, ein letzter Rest von Misstrauen.

Als Sarissa die Haustür öffnete, war da plötzlich Bewegung. Lautlos sprang die Katze auf, huschte an ihren Beinen vorbei hinein. Es war kein Betteln, kein Flehen – eher so, als hätte sie einfach entschieden, dass es jetzt so sein würde.

Bis zur Wohnungstür folgte sie Sarissa, Stufe für Stufe, ein geduldiger Schatten. Sarissa schloss auf, wollte sie gerade mit dem Fuß zurückschieben, doch die Katze glitt schneller durch den Spalt, als hätte sie das schon geübt.

Drinnen blieb sie stehen, die Pfoten nass, der Körper dünn, die Augen unverschämt groß.

Sarissa starrte sie an. Einen Moment lang war es, als spiegelte sich darin etwas, das sie nicht benennen wollte – Hunger, Müdigkeit, dieser trotzig-leere Blick, der sagte: Ich überlebe trotzdem.

Dann atmete sie aus, warf die Schlüssel auf den Tisch und zog die Jacke aus. „Mach, was du willst.“

Die Katze legte sich in eine Ecke, schloss halb die Augen, und tat genau das.

Picture the scene: A carpenter storms into a holy temple, overturning tables. Money scatters across marble floors as he fashions a whip and violently drives out the money-worshiping merchants. His voice thunders accusations at the religious elite: “You brood of vipers! Whitewashed tombs!” This same man would later face down the Sanhedrin itself, choosing death over compromise. He was not simply confronting individuals; he was actively uprooting the entrenched systems of control—challenging not only the religious authorities but the very structure and foundation of religion as it existed in his time.

Yet walk into any modern church, and you’ll find a Jesus scrubbed clean of his revolutionary fire—a gentle pacifist who wouldn’t hurt a fly, preaching nothing but unconditional acceptance. This isn’t the faith Jesus taught—it’s sedation sold as salvation. Modern churches have adopted a hippie ethic, creating environments of comfort and universal love that demand nothing significant and judge nothing important, producing a generation of cowardly sheep. Many remain in denial about the original sources of evil—those systems and leaders Jesus contended with remain the root cause of the current perversions that threaten the world.

⸻

**The Great Deception: How We Neutered the Lion of Judah**

Modern Christianity has committed theological treason. We’ve transformed history’s most dangerous revolutionary into a harmless hippie, and the results are catastrophic. When churches preach “love and tolerance” while child trafficking networks operate with impunity and Christians retreat into compliant silence, corruption devours society—and we’ve become everything Jesus opposed.

The evidence is overwhelming. In Matthew 10:34, Jesus declares with unmistakable clarity: “Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I have not come to bring peace, but a sword.” These aren’t the words of a pacifist—they’re the battle cry of a warrior who understood that true love sometimes requires war, and always demands the uprooting of corrupt systems.

Some might say: “But didn’t Jesus teach us to turn the other cheek?” Yes—when addressing personal insult. He was showing how to overcome ego, not how to tolerate institutional evil. When Jesus encountered systemic injustice, he didn’t turn cheeks—he overturned tables. The Gospel isn’t an escape from confrontation; it’s a mandate for holy resistance.

Consider the money changers again. Jesus didn’t politely request they leave. He didn’t organize a peaceful protest or file a complaint with temple authorities. He crafted a weapon and used force. The God of love wielded righteous violence because evil demands it. This wasn’t chaotic aggression—it was deliberate, strategic, and just.

⸻

**The Comfort Trap: How Modern Christians Chose Slavery Over Struggle**

Today’s believers, shaped by Hippie Theology, have made a devil’s bargain: comfort in exchange for contention. They quote 1 Peter 2:21—“Christ suffered for you, leaving you an example, that you should follow in his steps”—but then immediately seek the opposite of suffering. Modern Christians cling to the doctrine of vicarious atonement, using it as a theological loophole to offload personal responsibility for confronting evil and enduring the hardships that faith demands.

Feel-good sermons and prosperity gospel promises have replaced the narrow, difficult path Jesus actually walked. This isn’t accidental—it’s apostasy. James 4:4 couldn’t be clearer: “Friendship with the world is enmity with God.” Yet modern Christians chase worldly approval with desperate hunger. They water down biblical truth to avoid social backlash. They remain silent on moral issues to preserve their careers. They’ve become friends of the very world system that Jesus died to overthrow.

The cost? A Christianity so toothless it’s become irrelevant. When the church won’t take stands, evil fills the vacuum.

**Intellectual Cowardice: The Death of Christian Discourse**

Perhaps nowhere is modern Christianity’s betrayal more evident than in believers’ retreat from intellectual battle. Jesus engaged the sharpest minds of his day—Pharisees, Sadducees, Rabbis—and defeated them through superior knowledge and unshakeable conviction. He didn’t hide in religious echo chambers or rely on other people’s arguments. He studied, he reasoned, he debated.

Today’s Christians do the opposite. Rather than developing deep biblical knowledge and engaging in secular thought, they retreat into safe spaces, sharing a pastor’s YouTube clips instead of forming original thoughts. They avoid challenging conversations, preferring the comfort of preaching through a third party. This intellectual laziness isn’t humility—it’s cowardice. And it’s exactly what secular forces count on. While Christians share memes, others study philosophy, master rhetoric, and shape culture. The result? A public square dominated by voices that see Christianity as their enemy, largely because Christians abandoned the intellectual battlefield.

The Book of Revelation has become Christianity’s greatest strategic weakness. Too many believers read its prophecies of end-times tribulation and conclude that fighting evil is futile.

“It’s all prophesied,” they shrug. “We just need to wait for Jesus to return and fix everything.”

This defeatist theology has produced a generation of Christian bystanders. Political corruption? “God’s plan.” Pharmaceutical subversion? “Prophecy fulfilling.” Moral decay? “Birth pains of the end times.”

Every crisis becomes an excuse for inaction, every defeat proof that surrendering is inevitable.

But Jesus didn’t model resignation—he modeled resistance through sacrificial victory. In Gethsemane, he prayed fervently—but then he acted decisively.

“Since Christ suffered in his body, arm yourselves also with the same attitude, because whoever suffers in the body is done with sin.”

Look around. Human trafficking networks operate openly. Corporate greed ravages communities while churches remain silent. Corruption festers in political systems as believers retreat into private spirituality.

**The Warrior’s Path Forward**

The path ahead requires courage modern Christianity has forgotten how to summon. It means:

• Recognize and confront patterns of evil. Develop vigilance to identify repeating strategies used by corrupt systems. True warriors confront not just isolated actions but entrenched patterns that perpetuate suffering.

• Fuel your actions with righteous anger. Let the fire Jesus displayed—anger at injustice, exploitation, subversion, and hypocrisy—drive you to overturn the tables of corruption wherever they stand.

• Speak boldly when others whisper or stay silent. Truth doesn’t need qualifiers or apologies. Proclaim it with the same authority Jesus displayed when confronting the Pharisees, Rabbis, and Sadducees.

• Act decisively when others debate endlessly. Study the issues, form biblical convictions, then move. Paralysis by analysis serves evil’s purposes perfectly.

• Embrace conflict when others seek false peace. Real love sometimes requires temporary discomfort to prevent permanent damage. A surgeon’s knife causes pain but saves lives.

• Reject compromise with systems that destroy human flourishing. Jesus didn’t negotiate with money worshippers—he expelled and beat them. Some evils deserve no quarter.

• Build coalitions of like-minded warriors. Surround yourself with others who understand that discipleship means warfare, not acquiring fire insurance in hopes of avoiding Hell.

**The Choice Before Us**

Christianity stands at a crossroads. Down one path lies continued retreat into irrelevance—a hippie faith that avoids being offensive, offers comfort but demands nothing, that speaks of love but tolerates evil, that promises Heaven while surrendering Earth. Down the other path lies the way of the true Christ—the rebel who challenged the system, the warrior who conquered death, the king whose kingdom is not of this world, but whose impact on this world was revolutionary.

The choice is yours.

Will you follow the sanitized Jesus of modern Christianity into enslavement labeled as love, or will you follow the Warrior Christ of the Gospels?

Will you seek comfort, or will you bear the cross?

Will you wear a jersey from the sidelines, or will you wield a sword in the arena?

The world doesn’t need your good intentions.

It needs your righteous fury followed with action. It needs your willingness to suffer for truth. It needs *Warriors of Light* who understand that sometimes love requires war.

The revolution is on its way.. The question is: Are you ready to join it?

My living room, previously a mishmash of mismatched furniture, finally found its central star. Combining function and flair, this coffee table didn’t just meet my expectations—it lifted its top and set new ones! Every feature of this furniture piece felt aimed at those, like me, who battle between wanting a sleek aesthetic and craving practicality.

**Lift Top Design: Clever and Game-Changing**

The lift-top design was the first thing that caught my attention. Having a coffee table that raises its elegant, espresso-toned engineered wood top to create a workspace is genius. Days I spend working from the couch, or when my kids decide my living room is their art studio, this has proven to be a lifesaver. It's smooth, easy, and quiet thanks to the high-quality mechanism. Zero awkward jerks or loud creaks, which I’ve encountered with other similar furniture pieces.

**Large Storage Space: A Solution for Clutter Hoarders**

I think the hidden compartment and the two rattan baskets might secretly be the feature I was sold on. I mean, who doesn’t love some extra storage that doesn’t scream, “Hey, I’m messy!”? The baskets are charming, doubling as decorative elements, while the hidden storage beneath the lift-top makes a perfect hideaway for everything from board games to remotes. On the lower shelf, I’ve neatly organized snacks and books, though it could easily hold magazines or decorative items if you’re a fan of styling.

**Enduring Support and Stability**

After years of coffee tables wobbling under the weight of my Friday night cheese platters, I craved stability. This coffee table did NOT disappoint. The mix of engineered wood and a metal frame with adjustable feet gives off a “built-to-last” vibe. It can hold up to 88 pounds—just trust me, we’ve tested that claim with some serious stacks of books and late-night snacks. Nothing feels flimsy or rushed in design.

**Positives**

- The lift-top makes transitioning between a workspace and coffee table effortless.  
- Ample organization with hidden storage, baskets, and an additional shelf.  
- Elegant espresso finish that matches a variety of decor styles.  
- Excellent stability and good weight durability for daily use.  
- Assembly process is hassle-free, with detailed instructions.  

**Areas of Concern**

- The tabletop extends to 23.8 inches when lifted. For taller users, the height might feel slightly inadequate.  
- While the rattan baskets are adorable, they might not be everyone’s cup of tea aesthetically.  
- Some might prefer stain-resistant materials, which this coffee table lacks.  
- It's not customizable—what you see is what you get.  

**Competitive Options**

Coffee tables with lift-top features are becoming a popular replacement for traditional tables, and so I researched others before deciding. A common competitor comes from those minimalist Scandinavian-inspired brands, which offer similar lift mechanisms but often lack the Rolanstar’s deep storage and sturdy construction. For instance, where other tables might squeak or shift with long-term use, this one has maintained consistent quality. Compared to glass or tempered designs, I prefer this one for a home with kids—it feels durable and safe from accidental crashes, though it does lack the glossy modernity that some might crave. 

**True Value**

Affordability meets design, and that’s what impressed me most. There are fancier coffee tables available, but they rarely pack in this many functional elements without sending your budget into orbit. The Rolanstar hq-kfzh00E gives you the balance between style and practicality, making it feel like a smart investment in your living room. For the features and finish it offers (plus easy care instructions—just a dry cloth for clean-up!), it’s a piece I’m glad I snagged.

1ne96tr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1ne96tr/reclaiming_the_rebel_why_modern_christianity_has/,Reclaiming the Rebel: Why Modern Christianity Has Betrayed Jesus’s Warrior Spirit,"The most dangerous lie ever told about Jesus Christ isn’t that he didn’t exist—it’s that he was a hippie.

Picture the scene: A carpenter storms into a holy temple, overturning tables. Money scatters across marble floors as he fashions a whip and violently drives out the money-worshiping merchants. His voice thunders accusations at the religious elite: “You brood of vipers! Whitewashed tombs!” This same man would later face down the Sanhedrin itself, choosing death over compromise. He was not simply confronting individuals; he was actively uprooting the entrenched systems of control—challenging not only the religious authorities but the very structure and foundation of religion as it existed in his time.

Yet walk into any modern church, and you’ll find a Jesus scrubbed clean of his revolutionary fire—a gentle pacifist who wouldn’t hurt a fly, preaching nothing but unconditional acceptance. This isn’t the faith Jesus taught—it’s sedation sold as salvation. Modern churches have adopted a hippie ethic, creating environments of comfort and universal love that demand nothing significant and judge nothing important, producing a generation of cowardly sheep. Many remain in denial about the original sources of evil—those systems and leaders Jesus contended with remain the root cause of the current perversions that threaten the world.

⸻

**The Great Deception: How We Neutered the Lion of Judah**

Modern Christianity has committed theological treason. We’ve transformed history’s most dangerous revolutionary into a harmless hippie, and the results are catastrophic. When churches preach “love and tolerance” while child trafficking networks operate with impunity and Christians retreat into compliant silence, corruption devours society—and we’ve become everything Jesus opposed.

The evidence is overwhelming. In Matthew 10:34, Jesus declares with unmistakable clarity: “Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I have not come to bring peace, but a sword.” These aren’t the words of a pacifist—they’re the battle cry of a warrior who understood that true love sometimes requires war, and always demands the uprooting of corrupt systems.

Some might say: “But didn’t Jesus teach us to turn the other cheek?” Yes—when addressing personal insult. He was showing how to overcome ego, not how to tolerate institutional evil. When Jesus encountered systemic injustice, he didn’t turn cheeks—he overturned tables. The Gospel isn’t an escape from confrontation; it’s a mandate for holy resistance.

Consider the money changers again. Jesus didn’t politely request they leave. He didn’t organize a peaceful protest or file a complaint with temple authorities. He crafted a weapon and used force. The God of love wielded righteous violence because evil demands it. This wasn’t chaotic aggression—it was deliberate, strategic, and just.

⸻

**The Comfort Trap: How Modern Christians Chose Slavery Over Struggle**

Today’s believers, shaped by Hippie Theology, have made a devil’s bargain: comfort in exchange for contention. They quote 1 Peter 2:21—“Christ suffered for you, leaving you an example, that you should follow in his steps”—but then immediately seek the opposite of suffering. Modern Christians cling to the doctrine of vicarious atonement, using it as a theological loophole to offload personal responsibility for confronting evil and enduring the hardships that faith demands.

Feel-good sermons and prosperity gospel promises have replaced the narrow, difficult path Jesus actually walked. This isn’t accidental—it’s apostasy. James 4:4 couldn’t be clearer: “Friendship with the world is enmity with God.” Yet modern Christians chase worldly approval with desperate hunger. They water down biblical truth to avoid social backlash. They remain silent on moral issues to preserve their careers. They’ve become friends of the very world system that Jesus died to overthrow.

The cost? A Christianity so toothless it’s become irrelevant. When the church won’t take stands, evil fills the vacuum.

⸻

**Intellectual Cowardice: The Death of Christian Discourse**

Perhaps nowhere is modern Christianity’s betrayal more evident than in believers’ retreat from intellectual battle. Jesus engaged the sharpest minds of his day—Pharisees, Sadducees, Rabbis—and defeated them through superior knowledge and unshakeable conviction. He didn’t hide in religious echo chambers or rely on other people’s arguments. He studied, he reasoned, he debated.

Today’s Christians do the opposite. Rather than developing deep biblical knowledge and engaging in secular thought, they retreat into safe spaces, sharing a pastor’s YouTube clips instead of forming original thoughts. They avoid challenging conversations, preferring the comfort of preaching through a third party. This intellectual laziness isn’t humility—it’s cowardice. And it’s exactly what secular forces count on. While Christians share memes, others study philosophy, master rhetoric, and shape culture. The result? A public square dominated by voices that see Christianity as their enemy, largely because Christians abandoned the intellectual battlefield.

⸻

**The Revelation Deception: How Prophecy Became an Excuse for Inaction**

The Book of Revelation has become Christianity’s greatest strategic weakness. Too many believers read its prophecies of end-times tribulation and conclude that fighting evil is futile.

“It’s all prophesied,” they shrug. “We just need to wait for Jesus to return and fix everything.”

This defeatist theology has produced a generation of Christian bystanders. Political corruption? “God’s plan.” Pharmaceutical subversion? “Prophecy fulfilling.” Moral decay? “Birth pains of the end times.”

Every crisis becomes an excuse for inaction, every defeat proof that surrendering is inevitable.

But Jesus didn’t model resignation—he modeled resistance through sacrificial victory. In Gethsemane, he prayed fervently—but then he acted decisively. His path to the cross wasn’t passive resignation to fate; it was strategic sacrifice for ultimate triumph. He fought, died, and provided the example.

⸻

**The Call to Arms: Reclaiming Christianity’s Warrior Spirit**

The world doesn’t need more passive believers content with soft chairs, coffee, and a feel-good PowerPoint. It needs spiritual warriors willing to follow Jesus’s actual example: confronting corruption, exposing hypocrisy, protecting the vulnerable, and yes—making enemies of those who profit from injustice and worship money.

This warrior spirit isn’t new—it’s part of the prophetic tradition. The prophets called out kings, stood against national sins, and wept over injustice. The early church was accused of “turning the world upside down.” The apostles were jailed, beaten, and executed not for preaching love, but for threatening power.

This is the legacy we’ve forgotten.

It means embracing the suffering that 1 Peter 4:1 identifies as spiritual armor:

“Since Christ suffered in his body, arm yourselves also with the same attitude, because whoever suffers in the body is done with sin.”

Love, in the biblical sense, is not passive. It protects. It rebukes. It fights. Real love wields a sword when the innocent are under attack.

Look around. Human trafficking networks operate openly. Corporate greed ravages communities while churches remain silent. Corruption festers in political systems as believers retreat into private spirituality.

Where is your righteous anger?

How many tables have you flipped?

When will you translate conviction into strategic, embodied action?

⸻

**The Warrior’s Path Forward**

The path ahead requires courage modern Christianity has forgotten how to summon. It means:

• Recognize and confront patterns of evil. Develop vigilance to identify repeating strategies used by corrupt systems. True warriors confront not just isolated actions but entrenched patterns that perpetuate suffering.

• Fuel your actions with righteous anger. Let the fire Jesus displayed—anger at injustice, exploitation, subversion, and hypocrisy—drive you to overturn the tables of corruption wherever they stand.

• Speak boldly when others whisper or stay silent. Truth doesn’t need qualifiers or apologies. Proclaim it with the same authority Jesus displayed when confronting the Pharisees, Rabbis, and Sadducees.

• Act decisively when others debate endlessly. Study the issues, form biblical convictions, then move. Paralysis by analysis serves evil’s purposes perfectly.

• Embrace conflict when others seek false peace. Real love sometimes requires temporary discomfort to prevent permanent damage. A surgeon’s knife causes pain but saves lives.

• Reject compromise with systems that destroy human flourishing. Jesus didn’t negotiate with money worshippers—he expelled and beat them. Some evils deserve no quarter.

She was still upset about the death and initially reluctant to speak with me but with the mention of Donovan Whitmore she let me in. Per her testimony it echoed the police report and findings. She however recalled an incident approximately 2 weeks earlier where a painting arrived for Mrs. Whitmore. She says that she barely got a look at the painting, it was a ballerina in black. Mrs. Whitmore became upset and ordered her to throw it away. Mrs. Santos did not throw away the painting but thought it was too beautiful and instead kept it. Mrs. Santos then showed me the painting and I took several photos of it for Mr. Whitmore.

After a few days negotiation Elena Miles arranged for me to meet Vincent Monroe in his New York City penthouse today. Personal note. Mr. Monroe is clearly a wealthy and successful painter. The rent on this place has got to be three months’ pay for me. Vincent Monroe invited me in and was not what I expected. He was warm and gracious and humble. Saying that he just loved his art and was very glad and appreciative that his patrons were generous and loved his art as well. He did not know the name of the person who commissioned the painting but they did have some very exact details they wanted. I’ve made a photo of the note. During the interview Mr. Monroe spoke about his process and inspirations. At one point he picked up a palette knife and he turned quickly towards me but, he set it down again and continued talking.

The residence and hallway were in squalid conditions and smelled of urine and fried fish. Proceeded to canvass the neighborhood and visited several bars. In the fourth one I found Mr. Monroe when a bartender pointed him out. Time has not treated the man well. His drinking had made his features almost unrecognizable. I had the bartender make some coffee and after some coaxing he consumed it and began to rouse. When he was sufficiently alert I explained who I was and what I was doing. At the mention of his son he became enraged and I left before it escalated. I will try again. Meanwhile I am staying at a local hotel and waiting to hear from my contact in the department to see if he can get a hold of the case record for Vincent Monroe. Personal note, get new shirt.

Detective Miller, so long no hear. Glad you’re back in the saddle. Could teach these young broncs a few things. Anyhow, here is the record you requested. Looks like a cold case, nasty, part of those <beep> murders. Oops don’t tell HR on me or they’ll send me to sensitivity training. AGAIN!

Cheers,

Raymond Miller, Thursday, January 16, 2025. Utica, NY. I’ve reviewed the investigative file from the Vincent Monroe case. In my professional opinion, this was sloppy work and calling it an investigation is the punch line of a bad joke. Namely they saw the grieving family, saw the graffiti next to the victim and called it a day. And justice for all.

**Document 30:** **Dictated voice notes of Ray Miller**

Raymond Miller, Friday January 17, 2025. Utica, NY, Frank Monroe residence. Today I was able to speak with Mr. Monroe. He recognized me from the other night and was about to close the door on me when I told him I found more evidence in his son’s murder. He let me in and I observed the squalid conditions in which he lived, a single naked bulb hung from the ceiling and a dirty stained mattress lay in the corner. No discernible source of income. We stood in his kitchen as there was nowhere to sit but on the floor. I declined his offer of a drink. Fearing another outburst I did not mention his son’s name directly. Instead I explained what brought me here. Mr. Monroe did not understand what any of this had to do with him or his family. I told him of the painter Vincent Monroe and that seemed to confuse him. He told me his son had died, murdered by “those hateful bastards.” To deescalate him I asked about his other son Stephen. This elicited a dismissive wave from him. He said the, “big war hero, ran away instead of helping.” He would not elaborate. I asked about Mrs. Monroe and he said, “the stress of it was too much for her.” He began sobbing and asked me to leave. I left Mr. Monroe in his agitated state seeing my further presence was provoking him.

Subject: Whitmore

My partner and I spoke to your Mr. Whitmore. I must say that the man swore for a solid 5 minutes. Impressive. From what we learned Franklin is not talking and has lawyered up. I’m sorry, but without a signed confession from him the case is dead. What do you mean CI? You are no longer on the force. And tell Alex to lose some weight. Eat a salad for god’s sake, all that sitting around playing Call to Duty can’t be good for him.

**Document 32:** **Dictated voice notes of Ray Miller**

Raymond Miller, February 4, 2025. I’ve spent the past few weeks combing through newspaper reports on the hate crimes in the area. Almost all of the murders happened in one location none of them where the Monroe murder happened. Enough about the crimes and motives were leaked to the press and they do not match what happened to the Monroe boy. The scene, method and COD were all different. Something is definitely rotten in Denmark. Time to visit Frank Monroe again.

**Document 33:** **Dictated voice notes of Ray Miller**

Raymond Miller, Thursday February 6, 2025. Utica, NY, Frank Monroe residence. Mr. Monroe looked slightly better today. Had my visit changed his routine? I decided to hit him with what I know to gauge his reaction. I told him about the other murders, I told him about how his son’s murder did not fit. I pointedly asked him what happened that night. At this time Mr. Monroe became agitated again and attacked me. I restrained him without harming him. In his struggle I was able to overpower and pin him. He broke down completely and told me of his wife’s suicide after losing both sons. He told me how he had found Stephen in his brother’s studio dressed in his brother’s clothes, speaking like him and painting as if nothing was wrong. When Mr. Monroe confronted him, Stephen flew off into a rage and left the house never to be seen again. He told me that for years he drank to silence “them”, but he never said who they were and when I pressed, he started screaming, “I killed my son. Is that what you want to hear? I killed my son you son of a bitch” I immediately left and fled the scene hearing his screams. I didn’t know what else to do.

Re: Query

Mr. Miller,

From what you've described, this sounds like severe trauma induced dissociation. The behavior you mentioned, assuming his brother's identity, suggests a complete break from reality following the loss. Both the individual and family members may experience different manifestations of grief and trauma. The father's reference to 'silencing them' could indicate guilt, self-blame, or possibly substance-induced paranoia. I'd recommend extreme caution. You are dealing with someone who has experienced profound psychological trauma. If you do reach out to Stephen, be very careful his response may be violent.

I feel like I need to wash after digging through all that. Attached is everything I found, money transfers, emails, the works. Follow the money man! The long and the short of it was old lady’s company crashed, she tried to save it by stealing money from the cancer kids. That’s just wrong dude. Wrong. Turns out Mr. F’s grandkid was one of the many many kids that died. That, in your lingo is motive. Oh and I found the original email asking about the painting.

Raymond Miller, February 28, 2025, second visit to Vincent Monroe. Still posing as a buyer for Mr. Whitmore I spoke more with Vincent Monroe about his work and how he started. He says that he had a natural talent and sort of picked it up. I left him with my business card. On the back I wrote “Stephen”. Mr. Monroe barely glanced at it and asked me to put it on the table. I did and left.

Subject: Aunt Margaret

Well, Mr. Miller, after reviewing your man’s discoveries I guess my aunt’s death was truly an accident and an unfortunate coincidence in artwork. Seems, Franklin paid for the painting out of his own pocket. Apparently there is no crime in bad taste. Thank you for looking into this for me and as a personal thank you I am giving you a large bonus. See Abigail and take some time off. It’s well deserved.

**Document 38: Dictated voice notes of Ray Miller**

Stephen Monroe just left my apartment. I don’t know how he found where I lived or how he got in but I woke with him standing over me with a weapon. He, he, just wanted to talk. He asked me who I was and why did I want to speak with him. I reached for my weapon but he had already taken it. I told him what he wanted to know. I told him I understand, I told him how my own brother was murdered in prison. He then told me that he’d let me live if I continued to search for his brothers killer. He wanted to know if I could have saved Jared and I admitted that I could not. Then he left. He wore a mask but I’d recognize those eyes anywhere. Vincent and Stephen Monroe are the same person.

**Document 39:** **Dictated voice notes of Ray Miller**

Raymond Miller, March 25, 2025. Utica, NY, Frank Monroe residence. Mr. Monroe slammed the door closed once he saw who I was. I yelled that I knew where Stephen was and once again he let me in. He asked many questions and I explained what I knew leaving out the murder that originally brought me here. Thankfully he did not remember. I once again pressed him for what happened that night and again he grew enraged and said, “How many times do I need to say, I killed my son. I killed my son.” In light of this revelation I believe that Mr. Frank Monroe killed his youngest son and staged the scene to cover his crime. I can only do one thing with this information.

Mr. Miller,

That night I observed you. I almost ended our conversation abruptly, but curiosity got the better of me. I'm glad we spoke, for I have found in you another. I only end conversations abruptly with those deserving such treatment. And if my client hadn’t stepped out of line we’d not be having this conversation. Vincent is an innocent and will remain that way. For what are big brothers for? I received your findings. We will not meet again. Thank you.

Dear Sir,

I want to thank you for all the years of working with you. It has been a pleasure but due to recent events and the investigation into Mrs. Whitmore’s death I have failed. I am hereby resigning effective immediately. The recent months have brought to light memories I wished to forget and they are too much to continue working with you. I started this investigation looking for answers but instead I found no killer, no monsters, no real answers, only victims.

For as long as I remember I could not stand the thought of dirty dishes. I could not think of them, I could not look at them, I could not smell them or my brain would flood me with visions of the dirt on them mixed up with water and dishwashing liquid getting inside my mouth and choking me. Because of them I would almost never enter a kitchen (which led to me endning up a 20 years old cripple who had no idea how to make a toast). Fortunatelly I had lovely roommates who would do all the dishes for me in exchange for me dealing with other aspects of our shared life, so this compulsion - avoiding dirty dishes at all cost - wasn't so much of a problem.

Still, it was a rotting wound in my psyche. I'd waste lots of food upon suspicion that the plate wasn't clean enough, not to mention using up to 4 forks for one meal bc they smelled or tasted funny. Some way, one day, it had to be stopped.

It was.

This august I went camp counseling and the hotel we stayed at had badly washed dishes. I still had to eat of them for 20 days, to set a good example for the children. At the same time, my boss - a fatherly old man with a brilliant wit to whom you simply *don't* say no - deemed me his personal coffee maker and coffee pot washer. I had to endure it, and under any other circumstances it would probably traumatize me for life, but not with these people, they were out of this world. They created a work enviroment so safe and friendly, the whole ordeal healed me instead.

I still wash the dishes with latex gloves on my hands and a scented cloth over my face, but damn, this is so much more than I could ever do, so much more I have ever expected to be capable of! It's probably the biggest win against my OCD in my entire life.

No meds, no therapy. Just good people and safe enviroment, something I was never blessed to experience in my everyday life. Stay strong guys and gals, you're all gonna make it - just find your little bit of paradise and wait for it to do its magic.",3,1757598095.0,OCDRecovery,0,1.0,False

She was a throwback, mimicking the ‘60s hippie look with aplomb. Her guitar had a peace sign painted on the face, and the outfit was impeccable from the fringed jacket to her bell bottoms. A Hollywood costumer could have put it together, or, more likely, she had gotten exceptionally lucky at a garage sale. The music matched, too; a little Carole King, a little Lennon, a few songs I suspected were original. I knew, as soon as she started to play, that she was playing for me.

The whole coffee shop knew it, too. I caught the glances of a few jealous men, even though I couldn’t tear my eyes from her. She was blue and blonde and strange, the best imitation of another time I had ever seen. I saw her, and she saw me, and it was clear that I would be the man to kill her dead. Her first death, she whispered to me later in my apartment, was 1968. She insisted on making love, said that it would be that much more salacious if she was murdered by a lover. I could see the logic.

Fame was all she ever wanted. It could be for music or for beauty or for the deplorable condition her moldering corpse showed up in, just so long as it made the headlines. Dumped into a California gulch and never again disturbed didn’t do it for her. I’ve killed her a hundred times. I love her. I hate her. I’ll kill her a hundred more, until the news sniffs a sensational story and makes her a celebrity, the lovely songbird choked to death by her jealous part-time lover. I took the razor to her, then the saw. I’ll do it again and again until I get it right. She just keeps showing up, meeting me in a coffee shop or a bus terminal or at work for the first time, for the hundredth time. She pretends not to know me, but I see the recognition in her eyes. I know her by now. I know her better than I know myself. I know the way she chokes and gasps, the scent of her offal. I smell the impending death on her and she meets me over and again, ready to die for the love of the public.",2,1757598045.0,SpinalTapHorror,1,1.0,False

The office is breathing peacefully. The coffee machine is bubbling reassuringly, the fax machine is humming gently, computer mice are clicking quietly, keyboards are clattering rhythmically – and office dog Sir Henry the pug is snoring as if there were nothing bad in the world.

I adjust my white blouse and olive-green trousers, take a deep breath and make my way to my trainee Chiara.

On the way, I pass Laura's office. She sits there as if in a beauty commercial: reapplying lip gloss, adjusting her extensions, dabbing powder on her face. Suddenly, her ring light flashes brightly – I see spots like after a thunderstorm. Laura whispers into the mirror, ""This is going viral today. Safe."" I roll my eyes inwardly and continue on my way.

Next stop: Fax-Horst-Dieter. He leans over a freshly printed fax and runs his hand over the warm paper as if it were a precious cloth. He nods contentedly, as if he had just saved the world. Of course, I know that he has already filed a backup copy in the archive.

Then I reach the co-working area. Chiara is sitting there, her sleek black hair falling over her shoulders, an oversized matcha mug in front of her, as big as a flower pot. Her earbuds are plugged in deep – probably another true crime podcast. I wonder if she'll even notice I'm in the room today.

And then – at that very moment – there is suddenly a strange tension in the air. Everything feels too quiet, too perfect. A second later...

...the apocalypse breaks out.

Imagine you ask AI to make you coffee and it ends up brewing you a billion-dollar industry instead. Well, that's pretty much what's happening with Alibaba and its AI ventures. Despite a seemingly modest 2% growth in its latest earnings report, Alibaba is secretly plotting an AI coup with massive triple-digit growth in AI product sales for the eighth quarter in a row. Yes, you read that right—triple digits.

**The AI Magic Behind Alibaba's Curtain**

Underneath its e-commerce giant persona, Alibaba is becoming an AI powerhouse. Enter Qwen, its very own chatbot, vying for recognition in a ChatGPT-dominated world. Not just content with chatbots, Alibaba’s dabbling in AI chips, aiming to cut some global dependency while cornering the colossal Chinese AI market, projected to be worth a cool $50 billion, growing by 50% annually.

**A Partnership Made in Silicon Valley and Hangzhou**

In a cross-border bromance, Alibaba teamed up with Apple to sprinkle some AI pixie dust over iPhones. Together, they're working to make tech-savvy elves out of regular gadgets, mixing Californian innovation with Eastern enterprise.

**Why Alibaba Still Looks Like a Bargain**

Despite the tech tango and its soaring growth in AI, Alibaba's stock is shockingly affordable. Trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 16, it’s a steal compared to the S&P 500's average of 25. With its shares already up by 66% this year, Alibaba isn't just a smart buy; it's an intelligent hold.

So, will Alibaba's AI ambitions rewrite the rulebook on tech innovation and market dominance? Or is it just a matter of time before the AI bubble bursts? Let’s chat.

Hey friends! 🙌

Ever feel like you're just spinning your wheels in that never-ending 9-to-5 grind? Wake up, work, Netflix, sleep, repeat. Sound familiar? What if I told you there’s a whole new world out there—and it’s bursting with opportunity, especially in the AI field? Seriously, you're sitting on a gold mine, and it’s time to dig in!

### Why Upskill? 🤔
When I think of the *old* job market, I can’t help but cringe. The world is changing faster than my grandma can say “back in my day.” Here's why you should consider hopping on the AI train:

- **Flexible Freedom 🕊️:** Imagine ditching that morning commute and working from your favorite coffee shop, or even your couch! 
- **Demand Is Soaring 🚀:** Companies are scrambling for skilled individuals to help them navigate AI. You could be one of them!
- **Cash in on Skills 💸:** Upskilling can literally change the game! More skills = more money. It’s a no-brainer!

### Quick Wins to Upskill: 💪
Now, you might be thinking, ""That sounds great, but how?"" Don't worry; I got your back! Here are some quick wins to get you started:

1. **Online Courses:** Platforms like Coursera, Udacity, or even right here [Imagine Education](https://whop.com/imagine-education-ai/?a=liveitupdeals) offer some killer courses on AI and machine learning. 
2. **Networking:** Join communities—like ours! Chatting with like-minded folks can open doors to opportunities you never imagined.
3. **Hands-on Projects:** Find small projects, maybe even volunteer for startups. Real-world experience speaks louder than any resume!

### Let’s Get Real! 💯
I get it—diving into something new can feel overwhelming. Like, who has time for all that, right? But think about this: **What's scarier?** Staying in a dead-end job you hate or embracing the unknown and making something amazing happen?

Imagine what it would feel like to tell your boss, “I’m out!” and actually mean it. Or better yet, starting your own gig where you can create your own schedule, be your own boss, and pursue your passions.

### Time to Reflect! ✨
Look, the AI gold rush is here, and it’s calling your name! Whether you’re looking to pivot your career or merely add a superpower to your skillset, the time to act is NOW. So why not start today? 

What’s holding you back? Feeling a bit lost on where to begin? Or maybe you’ve already taken the plunge and want to share your success story? Either way, let’s chat about it!

I've seen someone on my regular bus commute to work who I cant help but feel drawn to. She happens to work at the same workplace as me but entirely different departments, but I see her regularly on my commute. She wears a rainbow lanyard and has a coffee mug with the Pride flag on it. 

I obviously don't know if she's queer and seems presumptuous to assume based on this, but I have seen her photo on my workplaces LGBTQ+ staff space, so I think it's safe to assume she's at the very least an ally. According to her job title, we work in very similar roles. 

I feel like a commute is not where you would approach someone in this regard as its usually the last place people would want to be disturbed. I keep saying to myself I will try and make eye contact one day and give a friendly smile or just say Hi, but I find it so hard to. I feel like a bit of a creep. 

I'm one of those people who quite rarely get drawn to people in this manner too, it doesn't happen very often. It would be easier if it were in a bar or somewhere like that where alcohol was involved, but this is quite different. I've tried to flip the roles in my head and I'd be thrilled if someone who I thought was LGBT smiled/acknowledged me, but I do have pretty low self esteem about this sort of thing.

Enter the Tide Power PODs + Downy, a product combining detergent, softeners, and that oh-so-nostalgic April Fresh scent. I’ve been putting it through its paces for weeks now, using it on everything from everyday clothes to delicate fabrics, and even those oh-so-stubborn gym towels that seem to hold odors hostage.

**Ease of Use & Convenience**  
Tide Power PODs have an undeniable allure with their no-mess, no-measuring approach. The small capsules effortlessly simplify the laundry process—just toss one in, and you're set. I found myself savoring a small sense of satisfaction every time I plopped one into the machine, knowing I wouldn’t need to mess with bulky jugs or sticky caps. Plus, their compact size makes storage a breeze. Gone are the days of cluttered laundry rooms!

[Check Tide Power PODs + Downy price on Amazon.](https://compare.senaar.com/p/b0dwvlmy39/)

**Fragrance & Freshness**  
The moment I unfolded my laundry after the first wash, I noticed the signature April Fresh scent. It’s subtle, not overpowering, but enough to catch a whiff when you're moving around. My better half made a point to tell me how inviting the sheets smelled, a testament to the freshness these pods achieve. However, for those sensitive to strong scents, this could be a touch too pronounced.

**Cleaning Power**  
To truly test out these pods, I threw them into the lion’s den—challenging stains and dirt-infused clothes that could make even seasoned detergents quiver. Grass stains? Gone. Coffee spills? Faded to nearly nothing. These little capsules pack a seriously powerful punch. However, for deeply set or older stains, I did need a pre-treat solution to ensure spotless results.

**Fabric Care**  
A standout feature here is the Downy-powered soft booster integrated into the pods. On my cotton t-shirts and cozy knit sweaters, I noticed a palpable softness that wasn’t there before. The fibers felt cared for without feeling coated or heavy, which can sometimes happen with overzealous conditioners. Unfortunately, for super delicate fabrics like my silk blouse, I still felt more comfortable using a dedicated wool/silk detergent instead.

**Strengths**  
• Combines detergent and fabric softener in one, cutting steps.  
• Deliciously pleasant scent lingers even post-wash.  
• Powerful cleaning agent tackles most stains with ease.

**Pitfalls**  
• Pricing is higher compared to traditional liquid detergent bottles.  
• Strong fragrance might not work for those preferring unscented products.  
• Not ideal for high-end delicate fabrics, requiring alternatives.

**Competing Products**  
While these pods hold their own, there are other players worth considering. For instance, the Kirkland Signature UltraClean Pacs are quite budget-friendly but seemed to underperform when tackling severe stains. On the higher end, Persil ProClean Discs impressed me with their stain-busting performance, but they lacked the luxurious softness added by the Downy integration in the Power PODs. What really sets this product apart is its all-in-one approach and reliable scent longevity.

**Worth Spending On?**  
In terms of price-to-quality ratio, the pods may feel slightly indulgent, but for what they deliver—cleaning power, fabric care, and fragrance—they hold their ground. If time-saving and convenience matter to you, these seemingly ""premium pods"" justify the investment as you won’t need to juggle multiple products mid-laundry.

Last year I was super frustrated with how the apartment looked. There was a roommate who left an old mattress in the living room for more than 6 months and another who left a pile of cardboard boxes for even longer. So I approached well call her roommate A because she was the only one staying through the new lease and asked if she wanted to redecorate. She offered $10 (we needed a new lamp, rug, table etc.) and so I realized it was up to me. She did later buy the tv, which was a bigger contribution to the living room. 

I am part of a creative major at my university and love making things and this summer I was stuck at a dead end internship without friends or support while going through a major mental health crisis. I poured out all my creative energy into our apartment and made every piece of furniture and decor by hand except for the rug. I refinished a table, reupholstered an ottoman, hand painted a lampshade, drew the wall art by hand. By doing that I made myself a place where I felt at home and safe while there was no other place or person in the world that was safe for me. I kept roommate A in the loop, showing her the new things I made. She helped me come up with the concepts for the “silly geese” illustrations I made to put up on the wall. 

Well fall came around (we’re in a college town) and roommates B and C moved in. Roommate B is roommate A’s best friend and Roommate C also had a personal connection to Roommate A. The apartment vibe changed in ways I had to adjust to. Roommate C didn’t like the complex-provided desk so she left it out in the dining room where we all had to just adapt and live around it. Roommate B chafed at my attempt to organize chores and we tried to learn how to coexist in our bathroom. 

Yesterday I came home from a class to find all three roommates sitting together (something that has never happened before). I apologized for a painting project I left on the living room floor saying I would have it cleaned up soon and Roommate A said “about that”. They went on to tell me that my decor made them feel uncomfortable in their own apartment (specifically my silly geese artwork and my fiddle leaf fig??) and they wanted to redecorate. I was devastated. I poured my whole soul and also a lot of my money (I’m in student debt so that was a huge deal for me) into this living room and now they were telling me it had to go. Roommate A suggested I put my fiddle leaf fig on the balcony. We live in a desert with winters that dip into the single digits (Fahrenheit). She was shocked when I informed her the plant I had poured love and money into would not survive that. 

I had to leave the apartment. I was shaking and I knew I was going to cry and I knew if I went to my room they’d hear me. So I ran to the public library and cried there instead. 

I didn’t get any messages from them, but I did send a few texts to roommate A telling her how betrayed I felt. She had kind of abandoned our friendship since roommate B moved in but this felt like an active move against me. She knew how much that decor meant to me. And she hadn’t had a problem with the mattress in the living room for six months so why did my plant suddenly make an intervention necessary (caveat to be fair: it does have a bright grow light above it that is on from 3am to 1pm, but I timed it that way specifically because the living room is almost always empty during that time and it would never interrupt anyone’s TV watching and the light doesn’t reach anyone’s rooms)? She texted back a few hours later that my “crazy creativity” makes the three of them “feel out of place” and that they didn’t want to get rid of everything I made just what they didn’t like. 
Now here’s where I might be the ahh. I decided that I didn’t want any part of them redecorating and I didn’t want them picking and choosing which one of the creations I made got to stay and which had to go. So I’m moving everything that’s mine out of the public spaces of the apartment: the rug, the record player, the extension cords, the coffee table, the shower curtain, the lamp, the plant. I don’t want to watch them pick and choose what is acceptable and what isn’t. They’ve expressed to me that they all just want to feel comfortable in their own home and I acknowledge that is valid. I just feel like coming to an agreement behind my back and then being so confrontational about it was deeply hurtful. And quite honestly I’ve lived in a lot of appartements where I disliked the decor and I survived without telling my roommates to get rid of it, so I don’t know why, when trash piles up and the dishes make everything stink, this is the problem they all came together to solve.

So last night I started to move all of my possessions into my car where I’ll take them to my aunt’s house and I’ll move the rest this weekend. The living room will be a blank slate and I’ve told them I’m not interested in being involved in the new decoration they can do what they want. So AITA? Was I waaaay overreacting? Is it really just stuff or does it matter how much it all means to me? Is it super annoying to have a live plant with a grow light in the living room? Was I making my roommates feel alienated in their own home with my picture of a goose in a cowboy hat?

So just adding my experience, which has been nothing but positive, minus a few hiccups right at the start (initially bought in 2023). I had impeccable customer service tho and all was resolved. After a full year of very happy use, I ended up moving and decided to upgrade to pod 4 instead of schlep the pod 3 to a new country (gave the 3 to an old roommate).
The pod 4 was way better than the 3 and I never needed to reach out to customer support since 2023. Maybe service declined since.

 i initially bought the pod as a gift to my now husband. he says he cannot sleep without it (well, I suppose he wasn’t sleeping well without it from the beginning). Basically, for us it’s been worth every penny. And considering how important sleep is for literally life even the subscription comes out to less than a coffee day—which btw neither of us even drink anymore (maybe attributed to the fact that we get proper full nights sleep?). 

That being said, I’m pretty against their whole 30-day completely free trial. In principle I get it makes a lot of sense, but considering how much fraud and abuse I read, it’s sooo wasteful, not only in transportation emissions but also that you can’t return the cover… so basically just another thing that goes in the landfill.

Not sure what the solution to that would be, but basically: yes, the product works. Yes, there’s a subscription but everyone knows this before going in. There’s no point in trying it for 30-days “in case it’s worth paying the subscription”, Just to decide you don’t want to spend less than a dollar a day to get all the app features (which are nice, but the pod still works without needing a subscription—that’s what my ex roommate did).
So, if you’re not prepared to pay the full subscription then don’t waste your time and the planets resources and stop contributing to unnecessary consumption and pollution. ",2,1757596891.0,EightSleep,1,1.0,False

We are two founders from the Netherlands, planning to spend about two months in San Francisco. We keep hearing SF is the startup hub of the world, and we want to experience that firsthand, learn from the community, and trade feedback.

We are building **Valto**, a Notion alternative focused on simple, fast knowledge workflows for early stage teams. Not here to sell anything, we want to connect with makers, compare notes, and be useful.

Looking for your advice on:

1. Indie hacker friendly meetups or small gatherings that welcome newcomers
2. Coworking spaces with day passes where builders actually talk to each other
3. Demo nights or open office hours that visitors can join without an application
4. Slack or Discord communities that are active in the Bay Area
5. Local etiquette for showing up without being pushy, what has worked for you

Happy to give back with quick usability reviews or feedback sessions on your product. If screenshots or a short demo of Valto helps to give context, I can share that in the comments if allowed. Thanks for any pointers, and if a quick coffee chat is easier we can come to your neighborhood.

By day, she juggled clinical rotations—chasing down IV poles in chaotic ERs, decoding frantic doctor orders, and holding hands with patients whispering final goodbyes. Nights blurred into study marathons, her eyes burning from flashcards on pharm kinetics and cardiac rhythms. The 2025 ATI RN Comprehensive Predictor Exam loomed like a judge's gavel: 180 questions, 4 hours of proctored hell, forecasting her NCLEX fate with cold probability scores. Forums overflowed with horror stories—students scoring 60% PoP, forced into remediation loops, their dreams of scrubs and stethoscopes slipping away amid burnout's fog. Elena's hands trembled during practice tests; a 65% on cystic fibrosis and OB meds crushed her, tears mixing with cold coffee as she questioned if she could even make it to graduation.

One rain-lashed evening, buried in her dorm amid crumpled notes on rheumatoid arthritis vs. osteoarthritis, Elena unearthed a forgotten USB from a senior's care package: the 2025 ATI RN Comprehensive Predictor Guide. Its 180+ verified questions and rationales sliced through the chaos like a lifeline—demystifying prioritization in sepsis cases, nailing mag sulfate protocols, and building her confidence block by block. No more guessing; just mastery. Here's the twist: during a grueling sim lab the next week, her sharpened instincts caught a ""patient's"" deteriorating vitals mid-scenario, turning her team's failure into triumph and earning the instructor's rare nod. On exam day, Elena faced the screen with steel resolve, emerging with a 98% PoP that lit her path to NCLEX glory. Burnout's shadow lifted; she was ready to heal the world.

The Houston Texans, fresh off a 14-9 season-opening loss to the Rams, host the 1-0 Tampa Bay Buccaneers in a Week 2 clash that’s as much a chess match as it is a football game. Let’s break this down with the precision of a spreadsheet and the humor of a Twitter thread after a bad NFL draft pick.

---

### Odds & Implied Probabilities: The Math of Mayhem

DraftKings has the Texans as 2.5-point favorites, with decimal odds hovering around **1.70** (*implied probability: \~59%*). The Bucs, priced at **2.20** (*\~45%*), are the underdog, yet SportsLine’s model gives them a **58% chance to cover the spread**. That’s the sportsbook equivalent of betting on a turtle to beat a rabbit in a race—*unlikely, but not impossible if the rabbit naps*.

The over/under sits at **42.5 points**, with the model predicting a 55% chance of exceeding that total. Given Houston’s explosive potential (*46-point projection!*) and Tampa’s leaky secondary (*see: “porous as a sieve dipped in honey”*), this might not be the defensive slugfest the preview promised.

---

### Team News: Injuries, Debutants, and Baker Mayfield’s Midlife Crisis

**Houston’s Hopefuls**: The Texans’ offense was a dud in Week 1, scoring 9 points against the Rams. But don’t count them out! Their model expects a *46-point eruption* from C.J. Stroud, Nico Collins, and Nick Chubb. Chubb, the workhorse back, is like a coffee machine—*once you press the button, you better hope it doesn’t explode*. Danielle Hunter, their sack machine (*12 sacks last season*), is tasked with making Baker Mayfield feel like he’s throwing to a wall of Jell-O.

**Tampa’s Hail Mary**: The Bucs lost their star receiver, Chris Godwin, to injury, but rookie Emeka Egbuka stepped in like a hotshot magician’s apprentice

Ladies and gentlemen, buckle up for a Sunday Night Football spectacle that’s like a Netflix rivalry special—except the stakes are higher, the scripts are written by statisticians, and the protagonists are two teams with QBs named after *Michael Penix Jr.* (sounds like a skincare product) and *J.J. McCarthy* (sounds like a barista who’s *very* into coffee). Let’s break this down with the precision of a spreadsheet and the humor of a sports bar bet gone wrong.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Why the Vikings Are the Statistical Pick to Win a Trivia Contest

The Minnesota Vikings are favored by 3.5 points, with decimal odds of 1.51 (implied probability: \~66.6%). The Atlanta Falcons, meanwhile, are priced at 2.64 (implied probability: \~37.9%), which is about the same chance as flipping a coin and it landing on its edge. The over/under is 44.5 points, and the model predicts the over will hit 59% of the time—probably because these rookie QBs think the “two-minute drill” is an excuse to throw picks.

Historically, the Vikings own the Falcons 16-14, which is like a 55% lifetime win rate. But here’s the kicker: the Falcons have lost four of five road games under coach Raheem Morris, who’s now learning that “traveling” doesn’t just mean moving the ball. Meanwhile, the Vikings went 10-2 against non-division opponents last season—proof that they’re the NFL’s version of a one-hit wonder who just *happens* to keep winning.

### Digesting the News: Rookies, Rivalries, and Kirk Cousins’ Ex-GF Drama

Both teams are led by rookie QBs who met in the 2024 College Football Playoff. Michael Penix Jr. (Falcons) threw for 298 yards and a TD in Week 1, which is impressive until you realize that’s just 1 yard shy of a high school quarterback’s “average” game. J.J. McCarthy (Vikings) tossed two TDs and even *rushed* in the fourth quarter—proof that Minnesota’s offense is less “Air Raid” and more “Just Throw It an

Right now, its looking like the Epic pass is my only option for an affordable pass. Leaving me with the options of Stowe, Mt. Snow and Okemo.

My original thought was to live in Rutland and work/ski in Killington. But the price of the season pass for Killington/Pico is outrageous. By the time I'm ready to make a decision, it would be $1,800. vs an Epic pass for $800 or even less if I get a NE Value Pass. But, I could also live in Rutland, work in a restaurant near Killington and ski at Okemo. 

BUT after asking around and reading a bit about Rutland... I'm not sure that its the nicest place to live. Hoping for some insight on that, and alternatives. 

Other thoughts.. Live in Montepelier, Morrisville or Waterbury and ski/work at Stowe. Live closer to Okemo and work/ski there.

We’re from Requiremints, a group that researches and compares products to help people find the right fit (without overcomplicating things). 

Recently, we reviewed more than 15 portable espresso makers across different price ranges, and we thought it’s a good idea to share what we found and help anyone looking for one.

Before buying a portable espresso maker, here are a few quick things to keep in mind:

* Do you want electric or manual? (electric heats the water, manual needs hot water ready)
* Will you use ground coffee, capsules, or both?
* How much pressure does it deliver (this affects crema and taste)
* How important are weight and size for you (travel vs. home use)
* Battery life or pumping effort (depends on type)
* Ease of cleaning and durability

Here are some options we think stand out:

# $100-150 Range

* **\[Best Overall\] Outin Nano Portable Electric Espresso Machine** \- Compact, rechargeable, and works with both pods and ground coffee. Delivers rich espresso with 20-bar pressure in minutes, perfect for travel, camping, or office.
   * Works with pods and ground coffee
   * 20-bar pressure system
   * Rechargeable with long battery life
* **\[Runner Up\] Wacaco Picopresso -** Manual espresso maker with 18-bar pressure. Tiny and durable, it brews rich espresso using ground coffee. Great pick for coffee lovers who don’t mind a bit of effort.
   * Uses ground coffee only
   * Hand pump with 18-bar pressure
   * Lightweight and durable design

# Under $70

* **\[Best for Pods\] Wacaco Minipresso NS2** \- Ultra-light, hand-pump machine that uses capsules. Small but powerful with 18-bar pressure. No batteries or electricity needed, making it great for travel and daily carry.
   * Works with capsules

After grinding for a few seconds, I could hear it struggling then it beeped and stopped. After trying to clear obstruction by poking a skewer down the hopper and a stiff plastic brush up the hole, I took it apart. The burrs were clogged up with fine coffee powder, slightly damp like coffee “mud”. It almost looked like I’d fed dark chocolate inside. Seems… not great for a coffee grinder? This isn’t normal, right?

[EDIT: Re questions on wet beans and bean type.] I haven't been using RDT water spray consistently as I was experimenting with dialing in. And when I have, I've made sure they were only slightly damp to try and avoid this very problem. Haven't been using flavored beans, just normal darker, espresso roasts.

Luckily I purchased off Amazon, so have 30 days to easily return it. I was thinking if it does it again, I’ll return.

1ne87wb,https://i.redd.it/psf7xqzp7jof1.png,Your Diet After Gallbladder Removal Surgery in Abu Dhabi: A Practical Guide for the First Month,"Just had your gallbladder removed (a cholecystectomy), or preparing for the surgery soon? It's completely normal to feel a bit unsure, perhaps even overwhelmed, about what you should and shouldn't eat in the weeks following. Digestive changes are a common concern, and navigating them thoughtfully can make a world of difference in your recovery.



As a surgeon who has performed many of these procedures over the past two decades, I've seen firsthand how thoughtful dietary adjustments can significantly improve a patient's comfort and recovery. Your gallbladder's job was to store and concentrate bile, which helps digest fats. Without it, bile flows directly from your liver into your small intestine. Your body **will** adapt, but it needs time and a little help from you, especially in that critical first month.



Here’s a practical, phased approach to your diet, keeping in mind the diverse culinary landscape we enjoy here in Abu Dhabi:



**Week 1: The Gentle Start (Days 1-7)**

This is about giving your digestive system a break and easing it back into action.

* **Initial Hours/Day 1-2:** You'll likely start with clear liquids in the hospital – water, clear broths, diluted juices. Gradually, you'll move to bland, soft foods like plain toast, rice, boiled potatoes, or clear soups. Think light and easy.



* **The Rest of Week 1:**
   * **Focus on:** Low-fat, easily digestible foods. Lean proteins like skinless chicken breast, plain fish, eggs (boiled or scrambled without much butter), and well-cooked vegetables.
   * **Avoid:** Anything rich, greasy, spicy, or high in fat. This includes fried foods, creamy sauces, full-fat dairy, red meat, and processed snacks. Even a small amount of fat can trigger discomfort, bloating, or diarrhea.
   * **Hydration:** Especially important in our Abu Dhabi climate. Drink plenty of water throughout the day. 



**Weeks 2-4: Gradual Reintroduction and Listening to Your Body**

Now, you can slowly start to broaden your dietary horizons, but still with caution.

* **Gradual Fat Reintroduction:** Start with very small amounts of healthy fats. For example, a tiny drizzle of olive oil on your vegetables, a small portion of avocado, or lean grilled meat.
* **Fiber Wisely:** While fiber is good, too much too soon can be an issue. Introduce high-fiber foods like whole grains (oats, brown rice), beans, lentils, and raw vegetables slowly. Cooked vegetables are often easier to digest initially.
* **Portion Control is Key:** Even with **""safe""** foods, don't overeat. Small, frequent meals (5-6 mini-meals a day) are often better than 3 large ones, as they put less strain on your system.
* **Food Diary:** Consider keeping a simple food diary. Note what you eat and any symptoms you experience (bloating, gas, discomfort, changes in bowel habits). This is invaluable for identifying trigger foods.

* **What to Limit or Avoid (Still):**
   * **High-Fat Offenders:** Fried items (like many takeaways or traditional Emirati street foods that are deep-fried), fatty cuts of meat, sausages, bacon, pastries, rich desserts, full-fat dairy.
   * **Very Spicy Foods:** Can irritate your system. While we love our spices here, ease into them gently.
   * **Caffeine & Alcohol:** Limit coffee and tea initially, and avoid alcohol for at least the first month, or as advised by your surgeon.
   * **Highly Processed Foods:** Often contain hidden fats and ingredients that are harder to digest.



**General Tips for the First Month and Beyond:**

* **Listen to Your Body:** This is the most crucial piece of advice. Everyone's adaptation is unique. If a food causes discomfort, avoid it for a while and try again later, or in smaller quantities.
* **Chew Thoroughly:** Aid digestion by chewing your food well.
* **Stay Active (As Approved):** Gentle walks can help with digestion and overall recovery.
* **Be Patient:** It can take weeks, or even a few months, for your digestive system to fully adjust. Don't get discouraged by occasional setbacks.



**Value Takeaway**

* **Go Low-Fat, Slowly:** Start with bland, low-fat foods immediately after surgery and gradually reintroduce fats over the first month.
* **Small & Frequent:** Opt for smaller, more frequent meals to ease digestion.
* **Listen & Learn:** Pay close attention to how your body reacts to different foods and adjust accordingly. Hydrate well.



For those who've had their gallbladder removed, what was the biggest dietary surprise for you, or what was one food you were worried about reintroducing but managed well? Your experiences can really help others navigate this!

Guiding patients through this dietary transition is a common part of my practice here in Abu Dhabi, and seeing them regain their comfort and confidence is always profoundly rewarding.

We have a family trip planned for **September 22-26 (4N/5D)** and I'm concerned about the recent heavy flooding. Our group includes seniors and children, so safety and accessibility are top priorities. I'm hoping to get insights on the **current flood situation** and which areas are most affected, road conditions and whether main tourist routes are still accessible, weather forecast **expectations for improvement by late September, and whether our planned itinerary needs any adjustments based on current conditions.**

Planned Itinerary:

 Day 1: Arrival + Nusa Dua Beach evening (safe, flexible)

  Day 2: Bali Safari & Animal shows + Tegalalang Rice Terraces + Coffee Plantations + Ubud Monkey Forest

  Day 3: Tirta Empul + Uluwatu Temple + Kecak Dance + Jimbaran beach

  Day 4: Taman Ayun + Bedugul + Tanah Lot sunset (epic finale)

  Day 5: Market shopping + departure

Staying at:  Tuban

I'm particularly concerned about accessibility to the rice terraces and mountain temples, road safety for elderly passengers, and whether we should have alternative indoor activities planned in case of continued rain. Any local insights or recent experiences would be hugely appreciated! Should we consider postponing or are conditions likely to improve?

Flipping it open revealed updated questions and detailed solutions, unraveling the enigmas of anatomy, compliance, and revenue cycle management like a hidden cipher. She devoured it by desk lamp, mastering every twist from global periods to bundling rules.

How do I even start to regain what was lost?","*Pay + Exploitation*

I worked in the testing department across all their IPs, hopping from brand to brand at short notice. I’d even moved countries for the position.

The salary was meagre. I signed the contract anyway because, like a lot of young professionals, I wanted to “make it” in the industry. But the highly specialised skillset they demanded was worth far more than what we earned.

Most new staff literally starved the week before payday. One October, I had to live on “survivalist food” just to get by. When the living wage increased, they were forced to give everyone fake “promotions” just to stay legal.


*Sexism + Double Standards*

There were only four women in the entire office. My female superiors were pushed into admin tasks that men didn’t have to do, and they often faced lewd comments behind closed doors.

One colleague made a sexual remark about me. Everyone laughed at my expense. Totally normal in male-dominated tech spaces. Unsurprising.

Rules were also different for me. The men would take hour-long paid coffee breaks at 3pm with no issues. If I split my 30-min lunch into two 15-min breaks? I got penalised.


*Medical Discrimination*

I have a health condition and take medication. I was upfront about this from day one.

Still, I was treated differently. When everyone else earned the right to WFH, I was denied. They said they didn’t “trust” me because I was on medication. I should have left then, but I stayed because I loved the field.

Later, HR demanded I disclose every detail of my condition, including exact names of meds - or risk being fired. Pretty sure that’s illegal. I even paid for a doctor’s note.


*Music + Jealousy*

Outside of work, I wrote, produced, and performed electronic music. Lots of us had side gigs, and it was allowed contractually.

My music started to gain traction. My flatmates once heard me mixing and called me “the next Radiohead.” I was happy about my fresh, unique sound.

Then word spread at work. The new head of department, a man in his 40s, seemed weirdly threatened by me. I think he resented that I was a woman making my own music while also excelling technically. Insecure men often lash out when women “upstage” them.


*Retaliation + Firing*

That same week, he bad-mouthed me to my manager behind my back.

I got disciplined for learning a language *during my lunch break*. Then, the day after my first (unpaid) live gig, I was let go on the spot. No severance. No notice. They even mentioned my live gig *before* firing me.

My manager even wrote in the company chat about my strangely sudden departure from the company.

“DO NOT RESPOND. DO NOT REACT.”

Instant isolation. My friends and colleagues were terrified to talk to me for fear of losing their jobs.


*Collapse*

The stress wrecked my health. I unintentionally started starving. I was so traumatised and embarrassed I avoided public places in case I bumped into ex-colleagues. I was terrified of retaliation from the man who slandered me.

Somehow, I still landed a much higher paying role while literally going weeks without food. My sodium levels dropped so low I ended up in the ER. But sadly the hospital staff also neglected me too.

Eventually, I lost all hope. I sadly attempted to end my life. The pain was too much. My father found me just in time. I was 29.


*Aftermath*

It’s been a year of fighting my way back. I’ve lost critical opportunities, future earnings, and confidence. I spent 14+ years of my life dedicated to music, only to be cut down violently just at the very moment before I could bloom.


*Why Am I Sharing This?*

I don’t want pity. I just want people to know how exploitative, sexist, and discriminatory certain companies within the industry can be and how quickly they can destroy you out of spite or jealousy. Especially if you don't fit the mold. Watch yourself out there.

If you’re going through something similar please, protect your health first. No job no ""dream"" is worth losing that. Professional sabotage is much more common than we want to think.

What should my next career move be? Almost a year out I'm still recovering from the aftermath of the myriad of health issues directly attributed to this malicious company.",5,1757595320.0,careeradvice,11,0.63,False

1ne7zdw,https://www.reddit.com/r/phinvest/comments/1ne7zdw/please_dont_open_a_coffee_shop_business/,Please don't open a coffee shop business.,"Unless you really have a vision & dedication to invest millions to build a strong brand, please invest your money elsewhere. Sobrang saturated na ng market with coffee chains & bootstrapped local cafes. It has become the new ""milktea"" trend.

Started my own shop din, and boy let me tell you sobrang hirap. Masarap/quality coffee mo? Guess what, that means nothing kasi there's hundreds of cafes na masarap/quality din. If you started before pandemic & survived, congrats kasi you're good and entered while may room for growth pa sa market. Nowadays, with the very aggresive expansion ng coffee chains like Zus Coffee, and the trend sa socmed that's glorifying the industry, wala na mga beh as in. 

Based on experience, consider this before starting:

1. You have millions to burn.
Do a quick search of an interview ng owner ng Candid Coffee. Based dun, it would take around 3-5 million to build a solid brick & mortar store (if memory serves me right). That's everything from picking a prime location, setting up the shop, marketing, etc. If you don't have that kind of capital, then it's best to stop and consider other ventures.

2. You are a marketing virtuoso.
Yeah can start naman with small capital, which is part of the problem din kasi walang masyadong barrier to entry. But if you do, make sure you can market the sh*t out of your brand. I'm not even exagerating. Most of the ""success stories"" na cafes, it was because they we're smart and aggresive with marketing lalo na sa socmed like Tiktok. Have a clear USP, invest wisely on marketing campaigns kasi not every marketing opportunity will yield results.


3. Location
If wala pang coffee shop sa lugar nyo (which I HIGHLY DOUBT is the case), then go grab the opportunity. 

4. Restaurant concept
Based on observation, yung mga local cafes that are able to survive and thrive ay yung mga cafes na may extensive food menu. Pinoys love to eat nga naman. Tapos yung coffee ay parang additional na lng ganon. My shop focused on coffee & definitely missed out on this revenue stream.


As for myself? I'll be closing my shop soon. My passion for coffee, and yung compliments ng mga regulars ko sadly don't pay the bills. Hundreds of pesos lost, but lessons learned.

1ne7y8w,https://i.redd.it/elz2rw988jof1.jpeg,My Step 1 Journey,"Hi Friends 
I just wanted to share my experience preparing for step 1 in case it helps someone who is still on the path. This subreddit has been a source of inspiration for me and I want to give back. 

Background 
IMG 
Study period:14 months 
Resources used: Uworld(primary), First aid(finished cover to cover at the beginning), Pathoma videos and first 3 chapter of the book, Mehelman pdfs on the final week****, BnB videos here and there, USMLE guru( some topics), Anki decks (inconsistently)

Scores 
Uworld : finished 75% with average of 64%. Reviewed 20% of incorrects. 
I took NBMEs and UWSAs in last 4 months in the following order 
NBME 26: 75%
NBME 27: 66% (random dip , scare me though 
NBME 28:73%
NBME 29:78%
NBME 30:66%(another dip, scared me again)
UWSA1 : 72%
UWSA3: 62% ( this is the toughest most vague exam I ever encountered in my life. I was devastated but managed to ignore it.
UWSA2: 72%

NBME 31: 76% (boosted my confidence)

I reviewed only the incorrects for the NBME and UWSAs

New Free 120: 73%(2days before the exam)
First 10 months of my Prep I was working part time 3 days and studying 4 days (average 10-12 hrs). Last 4 months of prep I was working full time graveyard shift. Trust me there were so many times I doubted my self and my readiness but faith kept me going. Step 1 is beast as they call it. Guess what so is life. Bills bills bills.

Exam day experience 
I arrived at the prometric Centre one hour early and they let me in. 
Did 2 blocks back to back and took five minutes break and did another two back to back and took 5 minutes break did 1 more and took longer break for salah and quick meal and coffee. Did the last two blocks back to back I was feeling exhausted but was able to concentrate. 
Honestly speaking I was angry during the test. Why they make the stems so long and give 90s for each question why they throw devilish questions here and there to push you off track? Why I did not get dedicated time of at least 2 months. It is not fair I was thinking but I catch myself every now and then. You got this ! Let them not play with your mind and confidence. You did what you were able to do, I told my self. I did not spend so much time overthinking the devilish hard questions.  I often calmed my self saying this might not even count, could be experimental. 
The exam was closest to according to my understanding NBME 30, UWSA2 and 3.

When I left the exam I had mixed feelings. My brain was not working for couple of hours after exam and then I started to have flash backs of some random questions here and there which I ignored. I got back to work after 2 days. The wait is so unbearable. 

I tried to make it as short as possible. 

Feel free to ask questions 

Alhamdulillah 

The following is for Muslim brothers

If you find yourselves entangled in prep and life hustles , don’t forget to pray and ask Allah for solutions. You will be surprised to see bereka in the already tight schedule and ease of all difficulties whatsoever. You will have steadfastness and calm of your heart which gives you courage and sound judgment for decisions.
Ask your parents to make dua on your behalf after giving them gifts whether they are in need or not. Because it will make them happy.
On exam day start each block with bismillah.

For confidentiality, I’ll just call them a “global music tech conglomerate.” This company tried to destroy my reputation, my health, and my music career just before I had the chance to bloom as an electronic artist.","*Pay + Exploitation*

I worked in the testing department across all their IPs, hopping from brand to brand at short notice. I’d even moved countries for the position.

The salary was meagre. I signed the contract anyway because, like a lot of young professionals, I wanted to “make it” in the industry. But the highly specialised skillset they demanded was worth far more than what we earned.

Most new staff literally starved the week before payday. One October, I had to live on “survivalist food” just to get by. When the living wage increased, they were forced to give everyone fake “promotions” just to stay legal.


*Sexism + Double Standards*

There were only four women in the entire office. My female superiors were pushed into admin tasks that men didn’t have to do, and they often faced lewd comments behind closed doors.

One colleague made a sexual remark about me. Everyone laughed at my expense. Totally normal in male-dominated tech spaces. Unsurprising.

Rules were also different for me. The men would take hour-long paid coffee breaks at 3pm with no issues. If I split my 30-min lunch into two 15-min breaks? I got penalised.


*Medical Discrimination*

I have a health condition and take medication. I was upfront about this from day one.

Still, I was treated differently. When everyone else earned the right to WFH, I was denied. They said they didn’t “trust” me because I was on medication. I should have left then, but I stayed because I loved the field.

Later, HR demanded I disclose every detail of my condition, including exact names of meds - or risk being fired. Pretty sure that’s illegal. I even paid for a doctor’s note.


*Music + Jealousy*

Outside of work, I wrote, produced, and performed electronic music. Lots of us had side gigs, and it was allowed contractually.

My music started to gain traction. My flatmates once heard me mixing and called me “the next Radiohead.” I was happy about my fresh, unique sound.

Then word spread at work. The new head of department, a man in his 40s, seemed weirdly threatened by me. I think he resented that I was a woman making my own music while also excelling technically. Insecure men often lash out when women “upstage” them.


*Retaliation + Firing*

That same week, he bad-mouthed me to my manager behind my back.

I got disciplined for learning a language *during my lunch break*. Then, the day after my first (unpaid) live gig, I was let go on the spot. No severance. No notice. They even mentioned my live gig *before* firing me.

My manager even wrote in the company chat about my strangely sudden departure from the company.

“DO NOT RESPOND. DO NOT REACT.”

Instant isolation. My friends and colleagues were terrified to talk to me for fear of losing their jobs.


*Collapse*

The stress wrecked my health. I unintentionally started starving. I was so traumatised and embarrassed I avoided public places in case I bumped into ex-colleagues. I was terrified of retaliation from the man who slandered me.

Somehow, I still landed a much higher paying role while literally going weeks without food. My sodium levels dropped so low I ended up in the ER. But sadly the hospital staff also neglected me too.

Eventually, I lost all hope. I sadly attempted to end my life. The pain was too much. My father found me just in time. I was 29.


*Aftermath*

It’s been a year of fighting my way back. I’ve lost critical opportunities, future earnings, and confidence. I spent 14+ years of my life dedicated to music, only to be cut down violently just at the very moment before I could bloom.


*Why Am I Sharing This?*

I don’t want pity. I just want people to know how exploitative, sexist, and discriminatory certain companies within the industry can be and how quickly they can destroy you out of spite or jealousy. Especially if you don't fit the mold. Watch yourself out there.

If you’re going through something similar please, protect your health first. No job no ""dream"" is worth losing that. Professional sabotage is much more common than we want to think.",4,1757594948.0,musicians,9,0.59,False

There are several other grinders commonly mentioned.

Is there any kind of consensus on what is considered the best hand grinder in 2025 for pourover? Nothing really matters to me except the taste of the coffee.

1ne7um2,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ne7um2,"10,000+ km Ownership Review and AMA - Yezdi Adventure","Preface: This is going to be a long post. I’d really appreciate it if people could keep the comments constructive and on-topic. I’m not here to debate brands — I genuinely don’t care about the badge. This is just my honest ownership experience and thoughts after 10,000 km.

On-Road Performance

After more than two years and 10,000 km, the Yezdi Adventure has become second nature to me. The engine has minor vibrations but is lively, with enough grunt for daily commutes and weekend ghats. There’s a slight dip in power and torque which comes between 3-4000 rpm. Cruising speeds are comfortable (I don’t speed anyway, but I’ve maintained 110 on highways for long stretches sometimes), and the brakes have been solid - even in emergency situations. The original brake pads lasted me nearly 12,000 km before needing a change, which I’m quite happy with. Planning to swap them for sintered pads just to try them (cost about 5-6k).

Initially, I wasn’t too confident with the tyres in the wet, but over time the grip has improved (or maybe I’ve just adapted). Will probably opt for better tyres when the time comes though. Also thinking of retrofitting tubeless spoked wheels from RE Himi 450 or KTM ADV 390. Recently, I removed the tank and leg guards (about 8 kg lighter), and the difference was surprising - the bike now tips into corners much more eagerly and feels nimble for its size.

Seat comfort (negative): The stock seat is too soft. At first it felt plush, but as the kilometres built up the foam turned squishy. On a ~500 km ride (to and fro) the last 300 km were painful on the backside. I’ve added a 3D mesh cover as a stopgap, but when I’m back home I plan to swap the foam for a firmer one.

Off-Road Performance

I’m not an expert off-roader, but the Yezdi gives me the confidence to tackle just about any trail I point it at. Last year I did around 150 km of off-road riding in a single day, and it was one of the best rides I’ve ever had. The weight is only noticeable when taking it off the stand; once you’re moving above 5 km/h, the balance is excellent and the bike feels planted and sure-footed.

Ownership & Service

- Battery: Died after about 2.5 years when the bike sat unused for a couple of months after I moved to another state. Replaced with a new one since.
- Sensors: Fuel sensor was faulty and replaced under warranty at the first service. More recently, an O₂ sensor issue was finally resolved and replaced under warranty as well.
- Maintenance: Brakes have been reliable, ABS has never been intrusive or scary, and apart from the usual wear and tear, the bike has had no breakdowns.

Service costs: The 4 free services are now over. Each cost me roughly ₹2–3k. I’m due for my next service at the end of this month and will update the cost after that.

The service centre experience has been positive overall. They’ve been responsive with warranty claims, and helped with wheel alignment, chain adjustments, and minor fixes free of charge.

For my part, I wash the bike weekly, clean and lube the chain every 300–500 km, and polish it once a month.

The Bond

I’ve moved to a different state, so I can’t ride this machine as much as I’d love to. But whenever I go back home, I spend as much time as possible on the saddle. Whether it’s a small commute or a quick coffee run, I can’t help but smile every time I fire it up. The exhaust note and the way the bike responds makes even ordinary rides feel like little adventures.

Closing Note

Overall, the Yezdi Adventure has been a dependable, fun, and character-filled machine for me over 10,000 km. It rewards regular care and attention — and in return, it gives you plenty of smiles per mile.

Ride safe, wear a helmet, respect the rules. #ATGATT 🏍️💨


TL;DR: 10,000+ km with my Yezdi Adventure - still loving it. Smooth, lively engine; solid brakes (pads lasted ~12k km); feels nimble after removing guards; very confidence-inspiring off-road. Service centre has been helpful with warranty fixes (fuel & O₂ sensors); battery only died after 2.5 years of storage. Biggest downside so far is the overly soft seat on long rides. Costs about ₹2–3k per service. Overall: dependable, character-filled bike that rewards regular care.",3,1757594698.0,indianbikes,6,0.81,False

My parents have a toxic relationship so I lived  with my grandma and uncle ( maternal side ) for around 15 years and I am basically the common point which is keeping the whole family connected.
Then my grandma and uncle are both very sick and I don't even know what will happen to them and how bad I will regret not being available right now as I am in another city to prepare for college entrance.
The situation is that my parents don't like each other and are still staying together because "" they are doing it for me "". My mother has been suffering from paranoia and she is still on pills and this thing has made her pretty selfish as well. Too much that her own family ( her parent and siblings ) don't like her anymore although they are my saviour again like I said I am the common point.

My uncle has an anger issues too that's why I wanted to move out but seems like I ain't making it so will have to go back.

Rn I don't want anyone to be around me.

Since I am preparing for an entrance exam, I am living in a pg room with no partner and I stay there 19 hours a day, all alone.

I had few online friends, actually a whole family like friend circle but their lives are fucked up too rn and I don't wanna bother them venting there.

I have only one proper offline friends who is more or less in same condition ( only difference is his parents were happily married but his father got murdered).
We too are now 100km apart because I had move out.

This all has made me want to isolate myself away from my online friends too and idk do whatever happens.
I am not at all suicidal because I am used to it for the past 17 years.
But whenever things get too much, I feel tooo suffocated to do anything and end up regretting later for creating backlogs.

I don't know what's going to happen with me in these 4-5 years, but I just wanted to went so  that I can restart all the shits.

Going to grab some chips packet and a cup of coffee and go back to the daily chores.

1ne7ssh,https://www.reddit.com/r/SpecialNeedsChildren/comments/1ne7ssh/5_iptv_providers_i_actually_tried_in_2025_my/,5 IPTV Providers I Actually Tried in 2025: My Real-World Review,"If you’ve ever spent way too long researching [**iptv providers**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Top_Rated_IPTV/wiki/index/) with a bottomless mug of coffee at hand, wondering if any of them actually deliver for US, UK, CA, or FR content, you’re not alone. I tested five different services over a few weeks—sometimes bouncing between them in one evening. If you’re looking for the [**top rated iptv**](https://www.reddit.com/r/XXPTV_provider/wiki/index/) for your own channel-hopping needs, here’s my honest breakdown.

# 1. [XXIPTV](https://www.reddit.com/r/XXPTV_provider/wiki/index/)

* **Price:** $15/month (less if you commit to a longer **iptv subscription 2025**)
* **Channels:** 38,000+ live, 130,000+ VOD (excellent for US, UK sports, solid CA and FR)
* **Smoothness:** 9/10 (almost zero buffering—even on busy US football nights)
* **My take:** XXIPTV popped up on a few **iptv reseller** threads I follow. I was honestly impressed with how smooth everything ran—US and UK channels especially. I even found some niche Canadian stations I didn’t expect. French coverage is decent, not the deepest, but great for my mix.

# 2. [IPTVMEZZY](https://www.reddit.com/r/Reddit_best_IPTV_2026/wiki/index/)

* **Price:** $16/month (with options for multi-month pricing)
* **Channels:** 45,000+ live, 220,000+ VOD (deep library: US, UK, CA, FR)
* **Smoothness:** 8.5/10 (very steady, but a couple of hiccups during major live events)
* **My take:** IPTVMEZZY was suggested by a friend living in France who swears by their French TV. I found their UK and CA content surprisingly strong, and the VOD library is stacked. It handled most of my binge sessions without a hitch, just a rare buffer when everyone in my building was probably streaming too.

# 3. [Aurorastreaming](https://www.reddit.com/r/alibabaiptv/wiki/index/)

* **Price:** $14/month
* **Channels:** 32,000+ live, 105,000+ VOD (really shines for UK and FR, solid for US/CA)
* **Smoothness:** 8/10 (good for 95% of content, some lag on live UK sports)
* **My take:** Aurorastreaming was a bit of a dark horse for me. Their interface makes it easy to jump between regions, and I found more than a few French and UK channels I’d never heard of. I did hit the occasional slow stream during UK rugby, but overall, a pleasant surprise.

# 4. [VistaWave IPTV](https://www.reddit.com/r/LLptv/wiki/index/)

* **Price:** $13/month
* **Channels:** 24,000+ live, 72,000+ VOD (mostly US/UK/CA, fewer FR specialty channels)
* **Smoothness:** 7.5/10 (generally reliable, but live sports can stutter at peak times)
* **My take:** VistaWave IPTV is the “solid basics” pick. If you mostly want US news, UK drama, and mainstream Canadian channels, you’re good. French selection isn’t huge, but what’s there streams pretty well. Their **iptv subscription 2025** sign-up was painless, too.

# 5. LinkStream TV

* **Price:** $12/month
* **Channels:** 18,000+ live, 51,000+ VOD (US and UK core, with a bit of CA and FR)
* **Smoothness:** 7/10 (evening hours bring more buffering, especially with UK content)
* **My take:** LinkStream TV is definitely the budget choice here. It covers the must-haves and is fine for background watching or catching up on older shows. Their **iptv reseller** portal is clear if you’re curious, but I mostly used it as a backup for news and casual TV.

# What I Learned About IPTV in 2025

* **Always use the** [**best iptv trial**](https://www.reddit.com/r/LLptv/wiki/index/) before you buy—some services just work better with your device or internet.
* Don’t get distracted by massive channel counts. Think about what you’ll actually watch (I’m guilty of ignoring 90% of the list).
* Even the most [**top rated iptv**](https://www.reddit.com/r/LLPTV_SUB/wiki/index/) providers have off nights, especially during huge live events in the US or UK.
* If you’re considering being an [**iptv reseller**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Reddit_Official_IPTV/wiki/index/), get ready for plenty of tech support questions from friends and family.

She is still doing contact naps until we start sleep training her next month, and the nanny knew that and was okay with it when we hired her. Yesterday, I hadn’t heard from her in a while and had texted a few times to check on the baby because I knew she had been fussy during the day. When I did hear back, she told me she had accidentally fallen asleep with the baby.

I cosleep occasionally (but I don’t love doing it), and I’m weary of even my husband doing it just because he’s not mama and isn’t as in tune to our baby as I naturally am. I was not happy to hear that she fell asleep with her, but I just didn’t comment on it in hopes that it was just a one time thing. Well, again today, I’ve texted her and gotten no response and I’m assuming she’s fallen asleep again.

How would you address this? I’m not paying her to sleep, obviously. I also wonder if now is the time to start trying naps in the crib when she’s there, but my LO is going through a sleep regression and desperately needs good naps. I really do like our nanny and she has been fabulous otherwise, so I don’t want to lose her and I don’t want to be mean to her. Is there a way to give gentle feedback?

1ne7mow,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueChristian/comments/1ne7mow/at_the_heart_of_christianity_sits_a_cross/,At The Heart Of Christianity Sits A Cross,"I am a writer by trade. Normally, I wake up, go through a morning routine and sit down to write. Instead of working on what I normally work on, I felt compelled to write this. I hope it /blesses/ and /helps/ you today. 

_______

At the heart of Christianity sits a cross. Not radiant, but rugged, stained with blood and suffering, but suffused with hope.

We stand in its shadow when the sirens fade and the crowd thins. The news has already scattered into a thousand screens, but rooms are still, and hallways hold their breath. A kitchen clock keeps its small stubborn rhythm. On a dresser, a wedding ring glints beside a folded program from some other day that felt important for different reasons. Shoes by the door wait for feet that will not come. Grief is not dramatic for very long. It settles into corners and lingers in the ordinary.

The cross belongs in moments like this because it does not pretend. Wood carries weight. Nails hold more than a body. They hold the truth that love in a broken world is costly. The cross does not argue with pain or explain it away. It stands where it has always stood, where loss and love meet, and it refuses to move.

This is the ache of a life interrupted, a voice gone quiet, a family learning the shape of absence. Yet even here, hope does not retreat. It is not loud. It is not eager. It is steady. Hope sits in the chair by the window and keeps the night watch. Hope listens to the sobs and does not rush them. Hope keeps a place at the table because hope knows the story is not finished.

There were seeds in the life we are now remembering. Some of them were planted in public soil. You could watch them drop, hear them land, see the first green shoot. Most were smaller. They fell in car rides after long days, in late messages sent to a stranger who sounded lost, in conversations that asked more questions than they answered. 

They fell in classrooms and airport gates, on sidewalks outside venues when the lights had cooled and the last handshake was done. 

Seeds look like nothing while they are falling. But the ground keeps secrets, and God keeps count.
Grief can press the ground hard. It can look like the end of everything planted. The cross tells a different story. 

It says that what looks buried is often sown. It says that the dark is not a lock but a womb. A single act of faithfulness, a simple word of courage, a quiet kindness offered when no one was looking, all of it goes into the earth where God can reach it. One day it rises, and we call it fruit. We call it changed lives. We call it a person who steps out of apathy and into purpose, a heart that finds its way back after a long winter, a prayer that finally becomes a yes.

There is a way that death becomes a seed. Not because we are trying to make loss pretty, and not because pain is good, but because love is stubborn and God is patient. People begin to remember what mattered most. They hear the old words as if for the first time. 

They realize that truth without love becomes hard, and love without truth becomes hollow, and they want both. They ask their own hard questions and discover they are not alone inside them. A single life stretches out its roots into many lives. The harvest will be counted by a wiser hand than ours.

For the family, hope will not feel like a banner. It will feel like a hand on the shoulder. It will be the strength to get out of bed when there are reasons not to. It will be breath found one minute at a time. And beyond the minutes there is a promise that does not depend on how strong anyone feels. One day they will see him again in the presence of the Lord. They will walk streets of gold, which is another way of saying a city so honest with glory that even the ground shines.

They will run into the arms of Jesus and find that the scars on those hands are not symbols of defeat but of a love that would not let go. They will hear angels sing, not as rumor but as sound that fills the chest and settles the heart.

They will look upon the Lamb upon the throne and know that every mile carried purpose, even the ones that hurt.

Between now and then, our work is ordinary and holy. If his life planted something in you, let it grow. Tell the truth without cruelty. Be brave without contempt. Serve where no one is clapping. Forgive quickly and repent quicker. Refuse to be discipled by outrage. Learn the names of your neighbors. Carry a cross that looks less like spectacle and more like faithfulness. Give up the need to win every argument and instead become the kind of person whose presence steadies a room.

If you never agreed with him, you can still mourn what was taken. You can still hold the cry of the brokenhearted without qualification. You can still plant your own seeds of courage and peace and patient conviction. 

Grief has a way of enlarging those who let it work. It reminds us that every person bears an image, that every breath is a gift, that our convictions are never more valuable than the people inside them.
Night will pass. It always does. Morning returns in slow ways.

Coffee steam rises. A small laugh breaks through where there had only been tears. A story gets told at the table and hands reach for each other almost without thinking. The ache remains, but it learns to breathe. The cross stays where it is, not as a monument to death, but as the place where death was made to yield.

This is not the end. It cannot be, because the center of our faith is not only a cross. It is an empty tomb. The stone rolled and the world changed underfoot. That is why we can say the words that feel too large for our mouths and still believe them. Death is defeated. The tomb is empty. He is risen.",2,1757594104.0,TrueChristian,0,1.0,False

I applied to a bunch of jobs. I got a few interviews. I learned some buzzwords, watched a ton of YouTube tutorials, and prayed no one would dig too deep. Then, one company hired me. Remote work, good salary, and full benefits. I swear I almost fainted.



The first month was hell. The imposter syndrome was crushing me; I was googling everything, and I would jump every time someone messaged me on Slack. But I kept going. And I kept learning. I faked the confidence until it wasn't fake anymore.



About six months later, now... I'm actually good at this? Like, people come to me with questions. I'm hitting my KPIs. I trained the new intern last week. My manager called me a ""core team member,"" and I nearly choked on my coffee.



I still feel weird about how I started. But at the same time, if I hadn't lied, I never would have gotten this chance in the first place. And now, I'm not lying anymore. I actually became that person. I just took a weird path to get here.

Well I eventually asked him for a coffee and he said he was really busy.

I’ll be honest here, I’m relatively smart, not unnatractive, and I’m wondering how I read this situation so terribly. I want to crawl into a cave and die of embarrassment.

No fight, no warning, just vague excuses about “needing space.” Obviously, my first thought was another woman.

And I was right. The second the papers were signed, my bestie sent me a screenshot of his new Facebook post. There he was, smiling with a girl who looked like my younger clone. My stomach dropped. I stalked her profile like any sane woman would, and when I saw her age - nineteen, I nearly choked.

But then it clicked. Her birthday. I knew that date. Because it was the same day I gave birth to the baby girl we put up for adoption when we were teenagers.

Yep. My ex-husband’s new girlfriend was actually our biological daughter.

I texted him immediately like, “Are you aware you’re dating your own child??” He tried to deny it, but the proof was undeniable. And here’s the part that still makes me sick - he didn’t even care. He said, “She’s not legally our daughter, so it doesn’t matter.” He literally wanted to keep dating her and never tell her.

So I told her myself. I messaged her on Facebook, explained everything. She was horrified, dumped him instantly, and blocked him.

And you know what? Now she and I grab coffee every couple of weeks. She has her own family and I’m not trying to replace them, but we actually get along. Meanwhile, my ex? Completely out of both of our lives.

The council have decided with the end of the Womens Rugby World Cup all flags will be coming down.

This ties in nicely with a post we considered drafting as this saga has continued, reminding users of the four rules of the subreddit, particularly Rules 2 and 3.

Rule 2 is No Non-Local Politics and Rule 3 is Be Civil/Respectful.

Generally speaking, R2 exceptions have been by-elections and local council stuff which for the most part have been relatively harmless discussions. The Flag threads, with their wider national narrative, have invited a slew of comments from a variety of users. Many of these users are not from York and are the type of comments we might see on news posts about people from non-white/British backgrounds. The users are often either new accounts, or have an entire post history dedicated to political aggitation across a huge range of ""local"" subreddits worldwide.

We've also seen an increase in hateful or disrespectful comments, which is par for the course with any online political discussion and why Rule 2 is in place.

The result has been a need to increase Reddits automatic crowd control moderation to it's highest level as well as overly frequent checking of posts to remove hate comments. 

This was always going to be a difficult line to walk and the abuse from both far right and far left in the Modmail is hopefully a sign that it's been fairly applied. That said, with the councils final decision on flags there will be no future posts on the topic bar any seriously significant incidents that arise.

/r/York is a small sub and thus the discourse of the sub can very quickly be skewd by repeat topics. You'll all have seen this in the frequent tourism queries which though mundane are far less incediary that politics. 

I'd like to thank everyone that has engaged in the topic in good faith with the rules and apologise to anyone who's innocent comment on this topic (or unrelated topics) has been filtered by the heavy duty crowd control.

I would encourage local users to continue to engage with the sub generally and make posts on other topics for discussion/engagement as this will improve your odds of not being filtered when we have this setting on maximum.

Anyway that's it from the mods, please ""respectfully"" discuss the council's final decision in this thread, then lets get back to asking where the best place if for a coffee!",48,1757593290.0,york,10,0.96,False
