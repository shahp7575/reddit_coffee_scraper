So, you‚Äôre eyeing a rowing machine for your home gym? Smart move! Rowing is like the ultimate fitness hack‚Äîit works your whole body, boosts your cardio, and burns calories like nobody‚Äôs business, all while being easy on your joints. But with so many options out there, picking the right one can feel like rowing against a hurricane. No stress, though‚ÄîI‚Äôve got the lowdown on the two best rowing machines of 2025, straight from the pros at [Wirecutter](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-rowing-machine/). Think of this as a chat over coffee, with a sprinkle of sarcasm, a dash of humor, and all the info you need to make a solid choice. Let‚Äôs get to it!

# Why Rowing Machines Are the Real MVP

Ever wonder why rowing machines are such a big deal? They‚Äôre like the Swiss Army knife of fitness equipment. You‚Äôre hitting your legs, core, back, and arms in one smooth motion. It‚Äôs low-impact, so your knees won‚Äôt hate you, but it still gets your heart racing. Plus, it‚Äôs crazy efficient‚Äî30 minutes on a rower can burn as many calories as an hour of other workouts. I‚Äôve been using one for years, and let me tell you, nothing clears my head like that rhythmic pull. Whether you‚Äôre chasing gains or just want to feel less guilty about that extra slice of pizza, a rowing machine‚Äôs got your back. :)

# Meet the Champs: The Top Two Rowing Machines of 2025

After testing a bunch of rowers, Wirecutter crowned two winners for 2025: the **Concept2 RowErg** and the **WaterRower Oak with S4 Monitor**. Both are awesome, but they‚Äôve got different vibes. Let‚Äôs break them down.

# 1. Concept2 RowErg ‚Äì The Indestructible Workhorse

The [Concept2 RowErg](https://www.concept2.com/indoor-rowers) is the gold standard. It‚Äôs like that friend who‚Äôs always reliable, no matter what. Used by everyone from CrossFit fanatics to Olympic rowers, this machine is built like a tank with an air-resistance flywheel that ramps up the harder you pull. It‚Äôs got 10 resistance levels, but honestly, the automatic adjustment is usually enough unless you‚Äôre going for world records.

# Why It Rocks

* **Durability**: This thing could survive an apocalypse. Users on forums say theirs have lasted over a decade with zero issues.
* **Performance Monitor**: The monitor (PM3 or upgradable PM5) tracks time, distance, strokes per minute, and calories. You can even connect it to apps or join online challenges. I did a virtual 5K row once, and it was surprisingly fun!
* **Community**: Concept2 has a massive online following. Think virtual races, leaderboards, and workout plans to keep you motivated.

# The Catch

* **Noise**: Oh boy, it‚Äôs loud. Like, ‚Äúis a helicopter landing in my garage?‚Äù loud. If you‚Äôre in a shared space or want to row while watching Netflix, you might need noise-canceling headphones.
* **Looks**: It‚Äôs functional, not fancy. Don‚Äôt expect it to blend into your living room decor.

# My Take

I‚Äôve got a Concept2 at home, and it‚Äôs my ride-or-die. It‚Äôs been through countless sweaty sessions, and it‚Äôs still as solid as day one. Sure, the noise can be a bit much, but when I‚Äôm in the zone, I barely notice. If you want something that‚Äôll last forever and doesn‚Äôt mess around, this is your pick.

# 2. WaterRower Oak with S4 Monitor ‚Äì The Quiet, Classy Choice

If the Concept2 is the rugged pickup truck, the [WaterRower Oak](https://www.waterrower.com/) is the sleek luxury sedan. This beauty uses water resistance, which feels super smooth and mimics actual rowing on a lake. Instead of a loud fan, you get a calming whooshing sound‚Äîperfect for early morning workouts without waking the whole house.

# Why It Rocks

* **Quiet Operation**: It‚Äôs so quiet, you can hear your own thoughts (or your favorite podcast). Ideal for apartments or shared spaces.
* **Aesthetics**: Made from sustainably sourced hardwood, it‚Äôs gorgeous. It‚Äôs like a piece of furniture you can work out on.
* **Smooth Feel**: The water resistance adjusts naturally with your stroke, giving a more intuitive, fluid experience. The S4 monitor tracks your stats and even syncs with apps via Bluetooth.

# The Catch

* **Maintenance**: You‚Äôll need to clean the water tank and add purification tablets every few months. It‚Äôs not rocket science, but it‚Äôs an extra step.
* **Price**: At around $1,500, it‚Äôs pricier than the Concept2‚Äôs $1,000. You‚Äôre paying for that premium vibe.

# My Take

I tried a WaterRower at a friend‚Äôs place, and I was legit impressed. It felt like gliding on water, and the quietness was a game-changer. I could totally see myself zoning out to some chill music while rowing. If you‚Äôve got the budget and want something that looks as good as it performs, this one‚Äôs a winner.

# How Do They Compare?

Here‚Äôs a quick side-by-side to help you decide:

|**Feature**|**Concept2 RowErg**|**WaterRower Oak**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Resistance Type**|Air (adjustable)|Water (natural feel)|
|**Noise Level**|Loud (fan whirring)|Quiet (whooshing sound)|
|**Build Quality**|Sturdy, industrial|Elegant, wooden frame|
|**Monitor**|Simple (upgradable PM5)|Advanced (S4 with Bluetooth)|
|**Price**|\~$1,000|\~$1,500|
|**Warranty**|2 years (parts), 5 years (frame)|1 year|
|**Weight Capacity**|500 lbs|700 lbs|
|**Best For**|Durability, simplicity, pros|Quietness, aesthetics, smooth feel|

# Which One‚Äôs Right for You?

So, which rower should you snag? It depends on your vibe. If you‚Äôre all about durability, simplicity, and don‚Äôt mind a bit of noise, the **Concept2 RowErg** is your best bet. It‚Äôs like that no-nonsense friend who gets the job done. If you want a quieter, more stylish machine with a smoother, more natural feel, the **WaterRower Oak** is calling your name. It‚Äôs like the fancy coffee shop of rowers‚Äîeverything just feels *right*.

Rhetorical question alert: Ever wonder why some folks are Team Concept2 while others are Team WaterRower? It‚Äôs all about what you value most‚Äîrugged reliability or serene elegance. For me, the Concept2‚Äôs toughness wins, but I totally get the appeal of the WaterRower‚Äôs zen vibes.

# Other Options to Peek At

Wirecutter also mentioned two ‚ÄúWorth Considering‚Äù picks: the Hydrow Wave and Hydrow Core. These are interactive rowers with built-in screens and subscriptions (around $44/month) for virtual rowing classes or scenic rows on famous rivers. They‚Äôre cool if you love gamified workouts, but they‚Äôre pricier and might be overkill for beginners. Unless you‚Äôre dying for that high-tech experience, I‚Äôd stick with the Concept2 or WaterRower.

# What to Think About Before You Buy

Before you hit ‚Äúadd to cart,‚Äù here are a few things to keep in mind:

* **Space**: Rowers are long. You‚Äôll need at least 8 feet by 3 feet of floor space, plus extra height if you plan to store it vertically. Measure your space twice!
* **Budget**: The Concept2 is around $1,000, while the WaterRower is closer to $1,500. Both are investments, but they‚Äôre built to last.
* **Warranty**: Concept2 offers a solid 2 years on parts and 5 years on the frame. WaterRower gives you 1 year, which is standard but shorter.
* **Maintenance**: The WaterRower needs occasional tank cleaning, while the Concept2 is pretty much set-and-forget.
* **Noise**: If you‚Äôre in an apartment or have roommates, the WaterRower‚Äôs quiet operation might be a lifesaver.

# Wrapping It Up

Alright, let‚Äôs sum it up. The **Concept2 RowErg** and **WaterRower Oak with S4 Monitor** are the top dogs for 2025, and for good reason. The Concept2 is a durable, no-frills beast that‚Äôll last forever, while the WaterRower is a quiet, stylish gem that feels like a luxury workout. Both will get you in killer shape‚Äîit‚Äôs just about picking the one that fits your life.

Quick anecdote: I once tried a cheap rower at a gym, and it was like rowing through quicksand. That‚Äôs when I knew I needed something legit. My Concept2 has been a game-changer, but I can‚Äôt lie‚Äîthe WaterRower‚Äôs smoothness is tempting. Whichever you choose, you‚Äôre making a solid investment in your health.

So, what‚Äôs it gonna be? Ready to row your way to fitness glory? Pick your champ, set it up, and make 2025 your fittest year yet. Happy rowing, and may your strokes be strong and your playlist be fire! :)",1,1747548748.0,Fitnessplates,0,1.0,False

My fingers freeze on one‚Äîmy fifth birthday. Behind the cake stands a blurry figure by the window. That smile. Always that smile.

Copper floods my mouth. My heart hammers ribs.

He's been there all along. Every dream for twenty years‚Äîthat unwavering grin above my bed. They say dreams recycle faces, borrow from memory. Never create new ones.

But I've found him now. Hiding in the edges of my history.

I slide the photos into my pocket. Evidence. Proof.

That night, he appears earlier. Not just in dreams. The bedroom corner darkens at midnight. Two eyes gleam first. Then teeth. That smile pulls wider than human mouths should stretch.

I scream for my roommate. Footsteps thunder down the hall. Light floods the room.

""There's nothing there,"" she says. Her eyes search mine, concerned. ""Maybe you should see someone.""

But he stays. Watching from the corner even as she stands in his space. Through her.

Sleep becomes a luxury I cannot afford. Coffee burns my throat raw. My skin buzzes with electricity that has nowhere to go.

He appears in broad daylight now. Standing in supermarket aisles. The passenger seat of my car. The shower when I close my eyes to rinse.

Always smiling. Never speaking. Never moving. Just watching.

I show the photos to my therapist. She sees nothing unusual in them.

""Pareidolia,"" she says. ""The mind's tendency to see faces in random patterns.""

But the smiling man stands behind her chair, teeth gleaming like wet porcelain.

At work, I drop a stack of papers when he appears beside my desk. My coworkers exchange glances.

""Just tired,"" I explain.

The elevator doors close, trapping me with him. His smile stretches wider. I press myself against the wall. People stare as I gasp for air.

I find more photos. Old yearbooks. Newspaper clippings from my childhood. He's in all of them now. Growing clearer. Getting closer.

Mom doesn't see him in the photos. No one does.

Tonight, I tape my eyes open. Kitchen knife clutched in white knuckles. Let him come.

The clock ticks past midnight. He materializes at the foot of my bed, but something's different. His smile falters. His eyes shift toward my window.

Someone stands outside. Watching.

The glass reflects my room back to me. Empty except for my trembling form.

But in the yard beyond, dozens of smiling figures gather. All with the same face. All watching. Waiting.

The first man turns back to me, no longer smiling.

His lips move for the first time.

The mood swings have been so weird, earlier i was balling my eyes out picking up my coffee, then screaming and cursing at the car in front of me cause my regular-programmed road rage is **off the charts**. I will say, Chat GPT has been *weirdly helpful* with this whole process. I actually got extremely frustrated by a recommendation it gave me, cussed it out (sorry Chat GPT), then learned how to program it to tailor the advice a bit more specifically to avoid anything like that again. 

Anyways, things I learned today: The chest pain is SUPER annoying. Altoids are my absolute best friend right now, especially when i sip some water with one and then take a deep breath. Having a coping mechanism for the anger is super crucial, the outbursts truly come out of nowhere.

1kpd044,https://www.reddit.com/r/outdoorboys/comments/1kpd044/thank_you_for_everything/,Thank you for everything,"Ladies and gentlemen, friends gathered around the glow of a campfire‚Äësized screen,

I want to share a story about an ordinary man with a camera‚ÄîLuke from the Outdoor‚ÄØBoys YouTube channel‚Äîand how he nudged my outlook onto a brand‚Äënew trail.

I discovered Luke during one of those late‚Äënight browsing sessions when the mind is tired but the spirit is restless. I clicked on a thumbnail of him and his sons stringing up tarps in a rainy Alaskan valley, their laughter echoing through the drizzle, and suddenly I felt transported‚Äîsmelling spruce needles I‚Äôd never touched, feeling cold droplets I‚Äôd never felt. The video ended and I watched another, and another, until sunrise colored my walls salmon pink. Something inside me‚Äîwhere wanderlust meets childhood wonder‚Äîlit up like kindling.‚ÄØ

Before Luke, my days were packed with noise and neon: city streets, arcade lights, and the buzzing of my own mistakes. My mind had been trained to chase quick thrills‚Äîanything that kept me from sitting with the quiet. Luke‚Äôs channel didn‚Äôt shout; it whispered. He‚Äôd kneel beside a camp stove and talk about building the perfect coal bed for bannock bread, and that small act of patience reshaped my sense of time. He made moments feel spacious. He taught me that a single ember, tended carefully, can outshine the brightest spark if you just let it breathe.

Soon I was hauling my own pack down muddy trails, just as Luke guided his boys across creek crossings. His mantra, ‚ÄúThe adventure starts when things go wrong,‚Äù reframed my past. All those nights I once labeled ‚Äúfailures‚Äù became switchbacks leading me here. I‚Äôd spent years thinking life was a straight line: make a mistake, fall off track, game over. Luke‚Äôs winding trails showed me the way forward is rarely straight, and that‚Äôs the beauty of it.

And let‚Äôs talk about family. Watching him invite his children into every adventure‚Äîwhether catching catfish under a Virginia bridge or building an overnight snow fort‚ÄîI felt an ache for reconnection. It nudged me to call my own mom, even after months of silence and a thousand miles between us. I didn‚Äôt need the perfect apology; I just needed Luke‚Äôs example: show up, be present, share the fire. That single phone call thawed a winter in our relationship.

Luke also reshaped my definition of wealth. He never flaunted gear for status; he celebrated creativity‚Äîturning PVC into a homemade raft, turning ordinary days into stories worth telling. From him I learned resourcefulness is a superpower, and ‚Äúfun per dollar‚Äù matters more than brand‚Äëname specifications. When money was tight, building a simple stove from a coffee can felt like forging a legendary tool. That mindset now seeps into everything: my writing, my game design, my language studies. It‚Äôs not about having; it‚Äôs about creating.

So yes, hearing that Luke is stepping away from YouTube is tough. The trailhead sign reads, ‚ÄúEnd of maintained path,‚Äù and I find myself reluctant to leave the clearing. But sorrow, I realize, is proof of impact. It means the hours he spent filming soggy boots and funny fish‚Äëflopping moments truly mattered‚Äîto viewers like me who needed a mentor in flannel and sturdy boots.

I‚Äôm sad because weekly uploads had become rhythmic, like tides, like breathing. Yet I‚Äôm also grateful that Luke modeled how to move on while still loving the journey. He‚Äôs teaching one last lesson: every chapter, even a joyful one, deserves a graceful close so the next can open. The adventure continues; it just changes form. Maybe he‚Äôll pour that presence into his sons off camera. Maybe he‚Äôll chase a dream that can‚Äôt be livestreamed. Whatever it is, I wish him gentle breezes and star‚Äëstreaked skies.

As for me, the torch he lit doesn‚Äôt extinguish just because the camera is packed away. I still roll out my sleeping mat under constellations, listen to wind comb through pines, and feel the calm Luke once shared with millions. I can carry that lantern for others‚Äîmy friends, my future children, perhaps some night‚Äëowl scrolling at 2‚ÄØa.m. who stumbles upon my own story and feels the same spark. That, I believe, is Luke‚Äôs true legacy: a relay of wonder.

So tonight I raise a titanium mug of camp cocoa to Luke. Thank you for showing me that life‚Äôs richest memories aren‚Äôt stored on an SD card but in the quiet heartbeat between crackling logs and a child‚Äôs gasp when a fish breaks the surface. Thank you for proving that growth can look like muddy boots, slightly burnt pancakes, and imperfect shelters that still keep out the storm. Thank you for demonstrating that the wilderness isn‚Äôt only a place out there; it‚Äôs the unexplored terrain inside each of us, waiting to be discovered with patience, humor, and heart.

May your next adventure be as kind and inspiring as the lessons you‚Äôve already given us. And may we, your audience‚Äëturned‚Äëfriends, keep walking‚Äîone uneven, beautiful step at a time.",4,1747547727.0,outdoorboys,0,1.0,False

At the center stands Kang the Conqueror, addressing his legion with a thunderous speech. He raises his arms, rallying his fellow Kangs with promises of multiversal domination.

Outside the arena, a lone, shadowy figure approaches ‚Äî slow, deliberate steps.

Back inside, Kang continues his grand proclamation. But suddenly, he stops.

Silence.

The camera pans up‚Ä¶ his head is gone. It hits the floor with a sickening thud and rolls, only to be skewered mid-roll by a sleek, silver blade. The sword rises ‚Äî and behind it, revealed in full ‚Äî Victor Von Doom (Robert Downey Jr.).

Doom grips the severed head still stuck on his blade and flings it into the stunned crowd. Then, calmly, he speaks.

‚ÄúApologies for the interruption. But it seems his little vision won't be realized after all.‚Äù

Without hesitation, Doom leaps into the stands and begins cutting down Kang variants one after another. The battle is brutal, surgical. One by one, the Kangs fall.

Moments later, the arena lies silent ‚Äî strewn with the bodies of the fallen. Only Doom remains.

Without a word, he turns and vanishes into the shadows.

Cut to black.

Cut to Earth-616.

Inside a sleek, high-tech briefing room, the New Avengers are mid-discussion ‚Äî tensions simmering over the escalating legal feud between them and Sam Wilson‚Äôs Avengers. The mood is sharp, terse. Lines are being drawn.

Red Guardian leans forward, arms crossed with smug confidence.

‚ÄúWhat if‚Ä¶ we call ourselves the *New AvengerZ*? With a Z,‚Äù he says, grinning like he just solved world peace.

Yelena turns to him, a snarky retort locked and loaded‚Äî

But she doesn‚Äôt get the chance.

A sharp alert cuts through the room. The overhead computer voice speaks, sterile and urgent:

‚ÄúExtraterrestrial object entering the atmosphere.‚Äù

All heads snap toward the screen.

A live feed comes into view: a ship ‚Äî triangular in shape, gliding through the sky with eerie grace. Its hull is a deep, cool blue, accented with streaks of white. Bold in the center: a massive, unmistakable ‚Äú4.‚Äù

None of them speak. Not yet.

They didn‚Äôt know it, but that ship‚Ä¶ that symbol‚Ä¶ would soon bring them one of their greatest allies.

Jump cut ‚Äî *inside the ship.*

The cockpit hums with quiet tension. Seated at the controls is *Reed Richards*, calm but focused, eyes scanning readouts. Beside him, *Sue Storm* holds their infant son, *Franklin*, gently rocking him as turbulence rattles the interior. *Johnny Storm* lounges with barely restrained energy, while *Ben Grimm* sits hunched in the corner, arms crossed, stone-faced ‚Äî literally.

The ship lurches. Lights flicker.

Then ‚Äî impact.

The craft slams into the heart of Central Park in a plume of smoke and torn earth.

A moment of silence.

And then ‚Äî figures approach through the settling dust.

*Captain America* ‚Äî *Sam Wilson* ‚Äî flanked by his team: *The Falcon* (*Joaquin Torres*), *Thor*, *Smart Hulk*, and *Black Pantheress* (*Shuri*). Each stands ready, alert but not hostile.

Sam steps forward, shield slung across his back, and extends a hand.

‚ÄúName‚Äôs Captain America,‚Äù he says, measured but warm. ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm getting good vibes from you‚Ä¶ so you can call me Sam.‚Äù

Reed studies him for a beat, then shakes his hand.

Cut to later.

Sam‚Äôs home. Simple. Safe. Coffee steams in mismatched mugs around a table. The newly arrived family sits across from Earth‚Äôs protectors, retelling their story ‚Äî a history spanning worlds and dimensions ‚Äî as the aroma of roasted beans fills the air.

For a moment, the multiverse is quiet.

And something like trust begins to form.

Smash to black.

Exterior ‚Äî *X-Mansion.*

Not the gritty, grounded estate from the live-action films ‚Äî but a vibrant, live-action reimagining of the mansion from the animated series. Classic. Majestic. Saturated in golden light on a peaceful day.

Out front, *Cyclops* (James Marsden) and *Beast* (Kelsey Grammer) are hard at work, casually scrubbing soot off a massive, battle-scarred *Sentinel* head that rests like a forgotten trophy on the lawn. Both wear bold, colorful uniforms ‚Äî pulled straight from the panels of a comic book.

The day feels almost‚Ä¶ normal.

Until ‚Äî *BOOM.*

A thunderous explosion rips through the sky. A spacecraft slams down from the heavens and obliterates the mansion in a single, fiery instant ‚Äî sending rubble, bricks, and mutant history flying in every direction.

Out of the smoke and twisted debris walks *Nightcrawler* (Alan Cumming), looking shaken but alive. Close behind: *Professor Charles Xavier* (Patrick Stewart), rolling calmly through the chaos; *Gambit* (Channing Tatum), flicking the dust off his coat; *Mystique* (Rebecca Romijn), poised and wary; and *Magneto* (Ian McKellen), no longer menacing ‚Äî just tired.

All of them clad in rich, comic-accurate uniforms. Bright. Regal. Nostalgic.

They look terrified.

‚ÄúWhat the hell just happened?‚Äù Cyclops asks, stepping forward, stunned.

A sudden crackle. Then ‚Äî a booming voice echoes from the ship‚Äôs loudspeakers, artificial and cold.

‚ÄúHello, ‚ÄòX-Men.‚Äô You are being *abducted* by the new ruler of the multiverse‚Ä¶ Victor Von Doom.‚Äù

Cyclops instinctively squares his shoulders.

‚ÄúNot without a fight, we aren‚Äôt.‚Äù

*Gambit* steps up beside him, flipping a charged card between his fingers.

‚ÄúYeah, like my mama always says, bad people‚Äî‚Äù

A sudden, blinding flash of green light cuts him off mid-sentence.

In an instant, all seven are lifted skyward in a column of twisting energy ‚Äî their forms vanishing into the belly of the ship.

And just like that ‚Äî it takes off, tearing through the clouds.

Silence.

Rubble.

Cut back to Sam Wilson‚Äôs Avengers, gathered around a table with the Fantastic Four.

Sam leans forward, disbelief written all over his face.

‚ÄúWait, so you‚Äôre telling me this ‚ÄòGalactima‚Äô guy‚Äî‚Äù

‚Äú*Galactus,*‚Äù Reed interrupts politely, nodding.

‚ÄúYeah, Galactus, whatever. He *ate* your Earth?‚Äù

Reed‚Äôs expression is somber.

‚ÄúYes. That is correct. I suppose you can only save the world so many times.‚Äù

Sam‚Äôs eyes glaze for a moment ‚Äî flashbacks to the Blip flicker across his mind ‚Äî then he shakes it off, focusing back on Reed.

‚ÄúDamn. Y‚Äôall must be really lucky to be here, then.‚Äù

Reed reaches across the table and rests a firm hand on Sam‚Äôs shoulder. Sam flinches just a little, still not used to Reed‚Äôs impossibly stretchy limbs.

Jump cut ‚Äî *New Avengers training room.*

Yelena is sparring with her father, moving with precision and controlled power.

Suddenly, an alert sounds over the speakers.

‚ÄúExtraterrestrial object entering the atmosphere.‚Äù

They barely react at first ‚Äî until a massive spacecraft drifts into view, hovering just outside the window.

Both jump, eyes wide.

Without warning, a metallic walkway shoots out from the ship, crashing through the glass.

The door slides open.

Out steps the armored figure ‚Äî *Victor Von Doom.*

‚ÄúHello‚Ä¶‚Äù

He inspects his gauntlet like a kid caught cheating on a test.

‚ÄúThunderbolts.‚Äù

Red Guardian interrupts with a smirk.

‚ÄúWell, actually, we‚Äôre called the New Avengers now.‚Äù

Doom laughs, sharp and cold.

‚ÄúOh, really?‚Äù Doom sneers ‚Äî then with a surge of magic, he hoists Red Guardian off the ground by the throat.

His voice drops, directed at Yelena.

‚ÄúAlright, since you seem to be the smart one, I‚Äôll tell you what‚Äôs going on. But first, get the rest of your team down here. I know there‚Äôs more than two of you.‚Äù

Yelena nods, immediately calling the others.

One by one, the rest of the team arrives.

Doom begins.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm taking you ‚Äî and every other so-called ‚Äòsuperhero team‚Äô in the multiverse ‚Äî to my world, *Battleworld.* There, you will fight to the death. The last standing will earn the right to defend my home planet‚Ä¶ and all the people of Latveria.‚Äù

The team exchanges confused glances.

In their universe, Latveria is just a country.

Without hesitation, Doom raises the entire team ‚Äî Red Guardian still struggling in his grip ‚Äî and tosses them back into the ship.

His platform ascends, and the ship roars to life, launching skyward.

Cut back to the room.

*Bob* ‚Äî *Sentry* ‚Äî enters, confused.

‚ÄúSorry I‚Äôm late. But‚Ä¶ where did you guys go?‚Äù

UK maybe 1980s","I had this book in the late 1980s, maybe even early 1990s but the stories seemed 'older'. I sure it was called something like Short Stories for Girls. And was made up of short stories from some famous authors. 

I can remember a couple of the stories, my favourite being about a girl who worked in a fabric section of a department store and wanted to be a shop buyer (as in the job role,  not buying shops), one day she meets a nice old man in a bowler hat and they make friends, and eventually turns out he owns the department store she works in. Happy ending. 

Another where a girl has to look after her baby brother but wants to hang out with her friends (maybe skating, maybe coffee bar) loses the brother, panics, realises she loves him. Had a bit of a 70s feel to it - which is what makes me feel the book is older than 1980s.

Another a girl has a summer holidays romance in the countryside (maybe when staying with an aunt) with a boy she had a poster of and a crush on. I think he was a popstar. Or movie star. 

More vague/abstract memories, there was another story about horses, maybe another with a pirate girl - these could be fake memories of other books, I read a lot as a child. 

I feel like I once found a boys version of the same thing in a charity shop and that was called Short Stories for Boys.

## Key Features Analysis

The specifications of a 1000W power inverter are crucial for determining its suitability for your intended applications.**Power Output:** The primary specification is the continuous power output, which should be a true 1000 watts. This means the inverter can reliably handle a constant load of 1000 watts without overheating or shutting down. Some inverters may boast higher peak power, referring to the surge capacity for starting appliances with high initial draw, but continuous power is the key figure for most users.

**Waveform Type:** Power inverters typically output either a modified sine wave or a pure sine wave. Modified sine wave inverters are more affordable but may not be compatible with all devices, particularly sensitive electronics or devices with AC motors. Pure sine wave inverters produce a cleaner, more stable power output that is nearly identical to grid power, ensuring compatibility with virtually any device.

**Input voltage:** The input voltage refers to the DC voltage required from the battery source. Common input voltages are 12V,24V,and 48V.Selecting the correct input voltage is critical for compatibility with your battery system.12V inverters are the most common for automotive and RV applications, while 24V and 48V systems are often used in larger solar power setups.

**Safety features:** Safety features are paramount in power inverters. Overload protection prevents the inverter from being damaged by excessive power draw.Short circuit protection protects against electrical faults that could damage the inverter or connected devices. Over-temperature protection shuts down the inverter if it gets too hot, preventing damage and potential fire hazards. Low voltage shutdown protects the battery from being excessively drained.

**Efficiency:** Inverter efficiency is the ratio of AC power output to DC power input,expressed as a percentage. Higher efficiency means less power is lost during the conversion process, resulting in longer battery runtime and less heat generation. A good 1000W inverter should have an efficiency rating of at least 85% at typical load.

**THD (Total Harmonic Distortion):** Total harmonic distortion (THD) measures the purity of the AC waveform produced by the inverter, particularly critically important in modified sine wave inverters. A lower THD indicates a cleaner waveform, reducing the risk of interference or damage to sensitive electronics. Pure sine wave inverters inherently have very low THD.

Key features to consider:

* Continuous Power Rating
* Waveform Type (Pure Sine Wave or Modified Sine Wave)
* Overload/Short Circuit Protection
* High Efficiency
* Input Voltage
* Low THD

## FAQs section

**How do I choose between a pure sine wave and a modified sine wave inverter?**
Pure sine wave inverters are recommended for sensitive electronics, medical equipment, and devices with AC motors. Modified sine wave inverters are suitable for less sensitive devices like basic power tools and charging adapters. If you have devices that require a clean power signal, a pure sine wave inverter is the best choice.

**What size battery do I need to run a 1000W inverter?**
The required battery size depends on the power consumption of your devices and the desired runtime. A 1000W load at 120V AC draws approximately 8.3 amps. Considering the inverter's efficiency, you may need to draw closer to 80-90 amps from a 12V battery. To estimate battery size, calculate your total power consumption in watt-hours and divide by the battery voltage, then factor in the desired runtime. A helpful guide is to use a deep cycle battery with at least 100Ah to run for several hours with a smaller load.

**Can I use a 1000W inverter to power a refrigerator?**
Yes, a 1000W inverter can typically power a small or medium-sized refrigerator.However, check the refrigerator's startup wattage, which can be significantly higher than its running wattage. The inverter's surge capacity should be able to handle the initial startup draw. You'll also need a pure sine wave inverter to ensure compatibility with the refrigerator's compressor motor.

**What safety precautions should I take when using a power inverter?**
Always connect the inverter to a properly sized battery and use appropriately rated cables. Ensure the inverter is properly grounded to prevent electric shock. avoid overloading the inverter beyond its rated continuous power output. Keep the inverter in a well-ventilated area to prevent overheating. do not expose the inverter to moisture or extreme temperatures.

And after 2 weeks i had to quit, bc i started to feel horrible. I felt like i was feeling this ball of air in my esophagus, and in my back. It was sooo annoying i gave in and went to the Er , got told it wasn‚Äôt my heart , after all kinds of test , x rays , they told me i had gerd . Sent me home w medication, so i did a follow up w my dr , and i was referred to a gastroenterologist. I was then given a complete ultrasound of my abdomen, stomach, all that and also a barium swallow test . Results came back dr said i have lots of stones , and a little bit of acid reflux . ( mind you i was told this 2 years ago after having my baby) PRIMARY DR brushed me off when i said that i had burning told  me to cut out the fat foods , but i don‚Äôt even eat bad at all i try to stay away from all that extra unhealthy stuff; don‚Äôt drink  soda, can‚Äôt drink coffee my stomach will literally burn in my upper right quadrant & sometimes just burns for nothing smh

So now I‚Äôm here , still having this weird feeling after i eat almost like im feeling my food in my upper back. Between my shoulders. Every-time i eat no matter what i eat . So my dr said i could get my gallbladder removed, but im like what if that‚Äôs not the issue and i still have this same pain after it‚Äôs been going on ever since i took that medicine.

I (34M) have a crippling fear of being an annoyance even to people I know I will never see again. The idea of approaching a woman who is minding her own business, who is possibly at a coffee shop to relax a bit or doing some work makes my social anxiety go crazy. I know, they could just say that they're not interested or that they're busy, but the idea of being a bother and potentially scare them stops me from even trying.

Even when I am already talking to a woman (like on a dating app date, at a Timeleft dinner or at work) I have never any idea what I'm doing. I don't know if I'm saying the right things in the right way, so that they know I'm flirting in an appropriate way.

And yeah, I cannot deny that the fear of rejection doesn't help. I don't value my worth by the amount of women I had (if I would it would be almost non existent), but receiving constantly no hits hard, giving me the idea that I am actually worthless.

Also, I have never the even the slightest of ideas that someone may like me, not anymore. A couple of times I thought so but they were just being kind or joking around, so if someone is actually interested I will have no idea.

A few years ago, I found out that my long term boyfriend and our roommate would be hooking up after I went to bed. So I left the whole state and moved back in with my parents to process the trauma and come up with a new life plan. I put a LOT of work into healing myself, getting over the betrayal, and learning to be happy on my own. 

By last year, I was still back in my home city and sooo over relationship drama. I was finally in a good place, and completely happy being single- which meant that any potential partners now had a HIGH bar to meet. I mean this in the most humble way possible, but my dating market was abundant. I do someday want a life partner, and I do someday want to be wildly in love again. So I was open to dating, but started to think I was broken for not feeling *it* with basically anyone.

I was pondering this in a coffee shop one day, and in walks the hottest man I‚Äôve ever seen in real life. I mean I could not take my eyes off him- he sat at the table next to me and I didn‚Äôt get a minute‚Äôs worth of work done for the next two hours. I‚Äôm usually pretty smooth & confident, but I was too nervous to say anything to him until he was packing up to leave. I basically just asked him out, and he responded by putting a piece of paper where he‚Äôd written his info on my table, smiled & said ‚Äúyeah we‚Äôre on the same page.‚Äù then walked out. 

I felt *it*. For weeks after that. We never became official or anything, but we hung out often, had deep talks, and got close. For the first time since having my heart smashed, I had real romantic feelings again- so big that I was afraid of them. 

Rightfully so, because after being away on a few back-to-back trips I got the dreaded ‚Äúsorry I‚Äôm not really feeling the spark anymore‚Äù text. Which honestly hurt like hell, but I mean cest la vie. 

It‚Äôs been a year since then. Unfortunately, I still can‚Äôt think about him without feeling like it was wrong for us to split- even though I know that if it was really wrong, he wouldn‚Äôt have done it lmao. I‚Äôve been repeating my mantra: I *do not* want somebody who doesn‚Äôt want me. But for some reason I‚Äôm still just a little hung up‚Ä¶ which is fine, we live in a big-ish city & I haven‚Äôt run into him again yet.

Anyway, there I was last night at the club. Dancing with my friends and keeping my eyes open for someone who can give me a feeling like that again. And I met this girl. Idk, there was just something about her; again, I finally felt *it*. We actually didn‚Äôt talk much, but I had her put her number in my phone‚Ä¶ her last name looked familiar, but I was drunk so didn‚Äôt think too hard about it. 

Today I‚Äôm buzzing. This feeling, this excitement, it‚Äôs so rare for me. I‚Äôm happy it still exists at all, and I‚Äôm dreaming up first date ideas. WELL I go to text her and I see it again- that last name‚Ä¶

A little bit of light Facebook stalking and‚Ä¶ yup‚Ä¶ they‚Äôre siblings. üôÉ

I‚Äôm trying to find some more information or reassurance that the endless diarrhea that has come with a stomach ulcer diagnosis, has an end in sight. 
Background: 5/11 our old man went to emergency vet at UCD for black vomit and coffee ground diarrhea indicating a GI bleed. X-ray showed no obstruction, but severe irritation of the upper GI. Labs showed no abnormalities and they suspected an ulcer. We denied further scans for budget reasons and he has improved remarkably at home with the meds (Omeprazole & sucralfate, as well as gabapentin and zofran in the first few days). Today was our final day of meds but the uncontrollable diarrhea (has mostly been normal brown, sometimes yellow, and a few black the first 4 days) is still leaking out of his bum. 
He is eating and drinking water now, only chicken and rice at the moment. Prior to this incident he was on hills science diet light for pancreatitis issues last year. The week before the ulcer I bought the fresh pet refrigerated rolls from Costco and added that to his food thinking I was making his kibble more appealing. Wondering if that is what may have caused the GI upset. 
Anywho, was hoping the incontinent part might resolve or if I should just expect to have a dog in diapers for the rest of his days? TIA. ",1,1747545559.0,AskVet,1,1.0,False

Delhi, our vibrant and historic capital, is a city that never stops ‚Äì and neither does its appetite. While many associate it with grand monuments, political power, and sprawling markets, there‚Äôs another identity that pulses through its veins: food. Not just any food, but *street food* ‚Äì bold, aromatic, unapologetically flavorful, and deeply rooted in centuries of tradition.

Sure, there are countless *Indian restaurant New Delhi* establishments dishing out refined versions of classic recipes. These places have their charm ‚Äì air-conditioned elegance, curated menus, and fusion twists. But if you truly want to taste the spirit of Delhi, there‚Äôs only one way to do it: **on the streets.**

# The Streets as an Open-Air Kitchen

From the moment the city stirs at sunrise, the aroma of simmering chai, frying parathas, and spicy chutneys begins to take over. By evening, the transformation is complete. Delhi‚Äôs roads, alleys, and sidewalks morph into a massive open-air kitchen where generations-old recipes come to life on sizzling tawas and bubbling kadhais.

Every area has its own food identity. Walk through **Chandni Chowk**, and you‚Äôre met with a historic food trail of **parathas, jalebis, dahi bhalla**, and **aloo tikkis**. Head to **Karol Bagh** or **Lajpat Nagar**, and you‚Äôll find spicy momos, **chaat** loaded with pomegranate seeds, and tangy **golgappas** that challenge your spice tolerance. Even the more upscale areas like **Connaught Place** or **Hauz Khas** have secret lanes where locals gather for late-night bites.

# Iconic Street Eats You Can‚Äôt Miss

1. **Chole Bhature** ‚Äì A Delhi staple, best enjoyed piping hot with pickled onions and green chili.
2. **Aloo Tikki Chaat** ‚Äì Mashed potato patties served with yogurt, tamarind chutney, and spicy masala.
3. **Golgappa (Pani Puri)** ‚Äì Hollow crisps filled with flavored water, potatoes, and chickpeas ‚Äì a burst of flavor in every bite.
4. **Kebabs & Rolls** ‚Äì Think juicy Seekh Kebabs, Mutton Kakori, and roomali rolls sizzling on charcoal grills.
5. **Ram Ladoo** ‚Äì Lentil fritters topped with shredded radish and tangy green chutney.
6. **Daulat Ki Chaat** ‚Äì A winter delicacy, this ethereal dessert made with milk froth and saffron is found only in the old lanes.

# Why Street Food Wins Hearts

Street food in Delhi is more than just convenient ‚Äì it‚Äôs **an experience**. You‚Äôre not just grabbing a bite; you‚Äôre engaging with the city‚Äôs soul. You chat with the vendor who learned the recipe from his grandfather. You watch as each item is made fresh in front of you. You eat standing under the open sky, surrounded by the city‚Äôs rhythm ‚Äì honking rickshaws, gossiping locals, and the smell of spice in the air.

And yes, it‚Äôs cheap. For less than the price of a coffee at a high-end caf√©, you can indulge in a satisfying, flavorful meal that rivals any fine-dining dish in depth and authenticity.

# Tips for Street Food Newbies

* **Go where the crowd is** ‚Äì Local popularity is a great indicator of quality and hygiene.
* **Keep water handy** ‚Äì Some of Delhi‚Äôs spiciest dishes don‚Äôt hold back!
* **Start slow** ‚Äì If you‚Äôre not used to Indian spices, ease into it with milder options.
* **Don‚Äôt skip dessert** ‚Äì Jalebis, kulfi, and moong dal halwa are must-tries.

# Conclusion: Eat Where the Locals Eat

While there's no shortage of great *Indian restaurant New Delhi* options with gourmet menus and elegant settings, the real essence of Delhi lies outside ‚Äì in the sizzling pans, the clatter of street-side stalls, and the hands that‚Äôve been crafting the same beloved dishes for generations.

So, if you're looking to truly connect with the capital ‚Äì to taste its past, its passion, and its personality ‚Äì then ditch the cutlery and hit the streets. Because in Delhi, **every corner has a story to tell ‚Äì and a dish to serve.**",0,1747545389.0,FoodToronto,0,0.5,False

During college, I started studying at a computer for hours every day, something I had never really done before. I was reading nonstop, day after day, and then one day I noticed something strange: the right side of my face felt like it was making a ‚Äúdisgusted‚Äù expression all on its own.

I stood up and looked in the mirror, expecting to see something obviously wrong‚Äîmaybe a stroke? But nothing looked out of the ordinary. Still, I could *feel* it. That uncomfortable tension in my face would come and go throughout the day, especially about half an hour after waking up. At night, it got worse. I‚Äôd lie in bed trying to figure out which side of my body to sleep on‚Äîwhether sleeping on the tense side or the non-tense side would help. Neither did.

At first, I assumed it would go away on its own. But with the facial tension came a whole new set of problems I hadn‚Äôt dealt with before. I started feeling socially anxious out of nowhere. Eye contact became more difficult. I had this constant, low-level feeling like I needed to be on alert, like there was something wrong just under the surface of things. And the worst part? My ability to think clearly dropped. I couldn‚Äôt follow complex thoughts like I used to, and my word recall got noticeably worse. The combination of facial tension and mental fog was hard to describe to anyone, so I kept it mostly to myself.

Fast forward 19 years. I had managed to get through law school and start a career, but the problem never went away. Finally, I had the time, money, and determination to actually try and solve it for real.

Here‚Äôs a list of things I tried, and what kind of results I got:

* Dry needling and electric dry needling: worked for about a day, then the tension came back
* Cupping: worked for less than a day
* Massage: helped for a day
* Tylenol: surprisingly effective‚Äîtook the edge off significantly, though I had to take near-max doses daily for continued relief
* Botox: injections between the eyebrows helped, temples helped, jaw muscles (masseters) didn‚Äôt help, but the sneering smile muscles (levator labii) did help
* Heating pads on the neck and head: definitely reduced tension
* Magnesium supplements: not much help, though ‚Äúmagnesium water‚Äù (you can search for it online) gave a little relief
* Caffeine: inconsistent‚Äîcoffee sometimes helped, but tea and soda often made things worse
* Chewing: oddly enough, it actually eased the tension

I was convinced I had TMJ for a long time because the symptoms lined up‚Äîface tension, anxiety, and brain fog. But I never had jaw locking or trouble opening my mouth. And the fact that chewing helped seemed to go against the TMJ diagnosis.

Then I came across something about binocular vision disorders‚Äîwhere your eyes don‚Äôt align perfectly, causing your facial muscles and brain to overcompensate. That‚Äôs when I tried something simple. I put an eye patch over my right eye and noticed that my concentration improved immediately. My brain fog started lifting.

So I went to a regular optometrist at Walmart‚Äînot a specialist‚Äîand explained what I had found. I asked for a minor prism correction in my glasses. After a basic test, she gave me glasses with 0.5 diopters of prism in each lens.

That was a week ago.

And I‚Äôm not exaggerating when I say this: the tension I‚Äôve been living with for 19 years is almost completely gone. My ability to concentrate is back. My anxiety has dropped dramatically‚Äîby at least 80 or 90 percent. My verbal fluency has returned. I can think clearly again. All because of eyeglasses. Not a hidden nerve issue, not some mysterious illness. Just glasses.

They cost about $160. And they changed tremendously. I have more energy, unexpectedly. Of course, maybe a week from now, it'll go to garbage, but the effects have been pretty immediate upon putting them on. 

So if you‚Äôve been struggling with a similar mix of symptoms‚Äîfacial tension, anxiety, brain fog, trouble concentrating, and you always figured it was classic TMJ or Trigeminal Neuralgia Atypical‚Äîthis might be something worth looking into. You don‚Äôt have to jump into vision therapy or anything complicated or get $700 glasses. Just try reading glasses and/or the eye patch test when you can. See if things feel better with one eye covered. It wasn't great feeling for me, but I noticed my cognitive clarity improved and that was interesting to me. If like me, they do help you, consider asking your eye doctor about prism glasses. I really have no stake in the glasses industry and am just doing this because I wish somebody would have put this info into my hands years ago. All the best.",14,1747544728.0,TMJ,1,1.0,False

We‚Äôre going to be grabbing coffee then going for a walk (my suggestion) and I‚Äôm looking to make sure it all goes well. 

I guess the big question is if that initial spark is there, but usually I‚Äôve found texting to be pretty indicative of that so that‚Äôs not really a worry for me. I‚Äôve only been on a handful of first dates, the only thing I really struggle with is conveying that I‚Äôm interested in the other person if we do click. I have been working on my confidence and there‚Äôs definitely been more flirting than normal with this girl, so I‚Äôm hoping this won‚Äôt be as much of an issue. 

Besides that, I only have a couple of minor worries: 

-the conversation dying down: I‚Äôm would consider myself pretty good at holding a conversation, but awkward silences do happen sometimes, and I‚Äôd like to have a couple of ‚Äúbackup‚Äù conversations topics to bring up just in case. Any suggestions would be great!

-Going between activities: I don‚Äôt think it would be a good idea to offer to give anyone a ride this early on, so we‚Äôre going to meet separately. The only issue I‚Äôm seeing with this is if the date ends up going well and we both decide to go for a walk. The area around the coffee shop isn‚Äôt exactly an ideal place to walk around, so we‚Äôd either need to drive separately somewhere else or we could both get in the others car persons car and drive there, which I have been considering offering if I feel things are going well.

**AITAH for retaliating against one of my bullies for something he repeatedly did to me - 26 years later?**



Okay, so this concerns me and a certain bully from a long time ago - I'll just name him ""Slam"".

In 1997 and 1998, when I was 13 and 14 respectively, for utterly no reason other than the fact that I was the only half-Australian boy in my school (in the city of Ipoh, state of Perak, country of Malaysia), and didn't speak Mandarin fluently, everyone in my class, and the class 1 year senior to mine, decided to pick on me.

I was literally the living definition of ""underdog"" and outcast. Any type of bullying, you name it, I suffered it. Pinned to the ground and punched? Got that. Water balloons on me out of nowhere? Truly well-versed in that kind of suffering. A fistful of chalk dust in my face? Yeah, nothing new.

Slam was, of course, one of my tormentors. He had a special bullying move of his own. Whenever we were playing basketball, none of the others bullied me on the court - except Slam. He made it his mission in life, when he got the basketball, to run to me, and throw the ball at my face as hard as he possibly could.

Sometimes I dodged the ball and got lucky. Other times, it left me with a very sore nose. Or watering eyes. Or a bleeding lip.

Slam did this to me anywhere between 30 to 40 times over the two years of torment. And I never managed to get back at him then. It reduced me to tears quite a few times, getting a basketball to the face.

Now, I am 40 years of age. Slam, being senior to me, would be 41. As luck would have it, as I was perusing a sports goods store in one of my city's malls, I saw Slam. Working as the manager for that store.

I know, ""Be the bigger person"", ""put it all behind you"", ""let bygones be bygones"", that's all excellent advice. But I couldn't help remembering how this person had made my life living hell in 1997 and 1998. The fury and hurt of the past just bubbled up despite 26 years of time separating it.

I walked up to him. Of course, he recognised me, and started acting all affable and friendly, asking me if there was anything I wanted. I calmly told him I'd like to see basketballs. Off he went and got a fine Spalding NBA ball for me.

Once it was in my hands, I calmly and clearly stated, ""Hey Slam. This is for '97 and '98,"" and with all my strength and a hatred I didn't know still existed in me, I flung the ball at him. It caught him full-force in the face.

To say he was shocked was the understatement of the year. I ran off as fast as I could and didn't stop until I got to my car.

I felt fulfilled - like I'd got back something I was owed after 26 long years. However, my mother calls me ""vindictive and evil"". My wife, meanwhile, chided me for ""not being able to let go of the past"". My aunt also said ""holding on to grudges like that will only kill you faster"".

So, Reddit, please tell me - AITAH?

*It was a really, really stupid idea for you, as a grown adult, to commit a crime against him in a public place that likely has security cameras. Massively stupid.*

**mkins10**

*I mean this is fucking hilarious but not the best way to handle the situation. If you would have verbally confronted him, maybe he would have even apologized. We all did things we regret as kids.*

>OOP: Not sure if he would've apologised. Out of 23 tormentors... only 2 have ever apologised to me. One did so and even accompanied his apology with a gift - a bottle of red wine. The other just said his sorries, but I accepted it. The rest? The few times I bumped into them, they never seemed to recall that they were part of the group that rained hell down on me in 1997 and 1998.

**KDLAlumni**

*Not sure about AH, but certainly childish and a bit of a b*tch honestly.   I mean, it'd have been one thing if you stood your ground and finished the confrontation, but you ran out of there like a frightened cat, so exactly what you proved to ""Slam"" is something you should ask yourself.\*

>OOP: I admit, I probably should've stood there and took what was coming to me, and maybe even fight it out. But fight or flight response took me - and my brain decided on ""flight"". Cowardly? Now looking back at it, yes indeed. I agree with your response.



**\*\*Judgement - NTA\*\***



**Update - 9 months later**



Alright, I know it's been almost a year, but I finally decided to go and resolve the situation. Opinions were divided on my original post. Some called me an AH for taking out my trauma for being bullied, so many years later. Others said while I was an AH, it was justified. Still others said, no excuses for bullying, my former bully who I named ""Slam"" in the post, deserved it.

Well, I decided to give the matter closure anyway. I decided to go and find Slam at the store, talk it out and resolve it earlier today.

I went to the store after lunch, and Slam was doing his rounds, inspecting the sports gear. He looked surprised to see me, and I raised my hands and told him I wasn't coming to cause trouble, but I wanted to talk things out.

I didn't mince my words, I started off with a direct apology. ""I'm sorry for hitting you in the face with that basketball almost a year ago. I have no excuse, I was angry and let past anger just overwhelm me. I failed to control myself, it was my fault.""

He shook his head and his response surprised me in turn, as he said, ""I have no excuse also. I remember what I did back then, and I really was a jerk. One hit in the face, I think I got off easy.""

Then the biggest shock of all - both of us laughed at that.

Slam then said, ""Look, come with me for a coffee. It's on me. I don't know how to patch up everything I did to you, me and the other guys, back then. But maybe we can have a coffee as a start?"" I accepted.

We went to a caf√© in the mall after Slam instructed the supervisor under him to take charge while he was away, and we talked. I showed him some pictures of my family, and he showed me pictures of his. He was glad to know I was in the tutoring industry, and even said that he might send his oldest child (6f) to me for tutoring.

We also found out we enjoyed some games in common - namely, Borderlands 2, Diablo 3 and DOOM 2016.

After the coffee he went back to his work and I headed to my car, on friendly terms. So, yeah - nothing dramatic or surprising, but a dignified and polite resolution to the matter. I was finishing up preparing my tutoring notes tonight, and thought that I'd post this update, just in case anyone was wondering if the matter unfolded any further.

Well, it's done and over with now, and I'm glad to say the shadows of my past have grown a little less dark now.

My name is Margaux I live in Japan and I'm the designer of Galaxy Chef, a solo life-sim cooking game set in a solarpunk sci-fi world.

In Galaxy Chef, players live their lives in a small community managing the local restaurant. The core feature of the game is a data-driven in-depth cooking system which allows the player to substitute any ingredient in any recipe. 

I was inspired by gmaes like Harvest Moon, ANimal Crossing, Stardew Valley, My Time at Sandrock, Overcooked and Coffee Talk to just name a few.

[Feel free to check out our pitch document here!](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XYPP60CRqlUNQEaORK7brK1jwyTZwTcx/view?usp=sharing)

Currently, I'm the only one working full-tim on this project (game design and social media marketing) and I've hired 2 part-time 2D artists to help with concepts.

I've been working on the design document for over a year and need to put together a vertical slice as soon as possible to look into getting investors/editors to help us fund this game so everyone on the team can live from this project.

I personally have 6 years of experience in the industry as a designer generalists between doing game design, level design, UI and some narrative design as well.

I'm looking for someone serious that can do a weekly call on Discord to discuss progress, has a strong foundaction in C++ and UE5, can create technical documentation for others to use their tools and is pleasant to work with.

I don't have a lot of budget and would prefer revshare or retroactive pay. This may change in the coming months as I have started posting on social media in hopes to eventually generate some income to help support the game's development.

The team is diverse. It is comprised of myself from France (designer, project lead), an environment artist from Brazil and a character concept artist from Malaysia.

Pure sine wave inverters provide cleaner, more stable power that is compatible with a wider range of devices, especially sensitive electronics like laptops and medical equipment. Modified sine wave inverters are more affordable but might cause issues with certain devices and may not run them as efficiently.

**Efficiency:** The efficiency of a 2000W power inverter measures how effectively it converts DC power to AC power. Higher efficiency means less power is lost in the conversion process, resulting in longer battery life and reduced heat generation. Seek inverters with efficiency ratings of 85% or higher for optimal performance.

**safety Features:** Robust safety features are paramount for a power inverter.These should include overload protection, short-circuit protection, over-temperature protection, and reverse polarity protection. These features safeguard the inverter, connected devices, and the user from potential hazards.

Key features of quality 2000W power inverters include:

* Durable construction
* Clever cooling systems
* Multiple AC outlets
* Remote control capabilities

1kpbx7c,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheFrontDesk/comments/1kpbx7c/give_them_just_enough_rope/,Give Them Just Enough Rope,"At the very first Bampton I worked NA, my responsibility was to make sure that the coffee was ready by time the breakfast attendant was supposed to be there (which was 5am). After she got there, I was hands off. 

Now, because of previous situations, I knew how to get the entire breakfast up and running on my own in a pinch. And I mainly did this because breakfast was supposed to be ready to go at 6am and I didn't want to deal with unhappy guests if I didn't have to.

  
So this one particular attendant started out right. She'd get there between 4:55-5:05am. Cool, no big deal.

  
Then it would start creeping to the 5:15-5:20 range, consistently. At first I would go ahead and get things started because I didn't want to hear the guests mouths. Never a ""hey, I got a late start"" , ""Thanks for getting this started"" or anything like that.

  
Now, as a sidenote, I had a self imposed ""no snitching"" policy. Basically, I'm not going to tell on you, but you'll tell on yourself.

  
So when it got to where she was coming in around 5:30am, I stopped doing more than what I would normally do. Which meant that breakfast wouldn't be ready until about 6:10am or so. So now when she'd come in late and see that I did the minimum, she would look at me sideways but she knew that she really couldn't say anything to me. When a guest would ask, ""Isn't breakfast supposed be out by now?"", I'd simply say that it should be out soon and the attendant is getting everything together now.

A few weekends of this and consistent complaints about the breakfast will eventually get back to management. 

Needless to say, she didn't last too much longer. 

I was later asked why didn't I put the breakfast out when she was running late, I had 2 responses:

1) She knew what time she was supposed to be there.

2) If I had kept doing it (because someone had to have known that I was doing it when they checked the timesheets), then it would have kept happening.

  
Sometimes you have to give people just enough rope....

These days I don‚Äôt play often, usually just doing main quest and main events.

I have two questions:
1) Is it necessary to get Coffee‚Äôs signature weapon? I know that nothing is necessary in this game but still. Honestly I don‚Äôt really feel like spending especially knowing that I probably will swipe for one copy of Skirk in the next patch. Does the buff from the weapon have a huge effect on Shenhe‚Äôs personal dmg? In one video I saw that difference in damage (her signature and Skyward spine) is like 35% but that was about Coffee‚Äôs dmg. 
2) Who should I use as the fourth party member? Is Yelan ok or is it better to swap her with other char, for example Furina (C0 no signature)? What parties are you using with ‚Äúmain-dps‚Äù Shenhe?

My boyfriend Jimmy and my stepmother Amy were absent from my father's funeral. Amy I had at least seen arrive, but she hadn‚Äôt come inside yet.

Where did they go?

I struggled to open up my swollen eyes, staring at the mobile phone that kept sending busy signals, wondering why they didn't answer my calls.

I was so worried that something might happen to Jimmy on the way that I could hardly breathe, I had to tug at the collar of my black coat and take a few deep breaths.

Looking at my father's cold and stiff body surrounded by flowers, I shed tears and hoped that he would arrive as soon as possible. Even if my relationship with Amy wasn‚Äôt great, I still wanted her here too.

I couldn't lose any more people. I needed them badly right now.

Jimmy promised to marry me when I came of age, and my stepmother Amy promised to be our witness. I was so thankful that I could have a home again after losing my father.

I was grateful that my father's former colleagues came together to honor him. They offered constant words of comfort and regret for my father's passing.

With their help, I managed through this funeral. Though it wasn‚Äôt my only problem today. My father's lawyer approached me to sign several papers the moment the funeral ended. Most of his property was sold to pay off debts.

It took the last of my strength to sign them. Alone. Jimmy and Amy never showed. I walked towards the underground parking, barely paying attention to where I was going. I shouldn‚Äôt have been surprised by the number of cars in the garage. It was packed like a can of sardines, and I was exhausted looking for my pink Buick among the crowd of vehicles. It had been a birthday present from my father last year, one I was lucky to be able to keep.

Thinking that I would never receive a gift from my father again, my throat tightened and I couldn't help letting out a sob. Tears fell from the corners of my eyes. Again. I couldn't help myself. All I really wanted now was to throw myself into Jimmy's arms and cry.

Jimmy, where are you?

I clutched my phone like a drowning man grabbing the last rope from the shore. The beeping busy tone echoed in the parking lot. I vaguely heard a buzzing vibration of a mobile phone followed by a low moan.

Really? Here?

There was another groan, followed by an uncomfortably familiar voice.

""Oh baby,"" he muttered. ""You feel great. I should have dumped that little virgin. I don‚Äôt have the patience to wait another year to hear her singing my name in bed. You're hotter than your stepdaughter."" He moaned softly. interrupted the mood.

I stopped in my tracks when another loud moan raised, this one decidedly feminine. My heart felt like it had fallen to my feet as ice filled my veins.

At least I knew why they didn't show up at the funeral.

Unable to stop myself, I followed the sound to the corner of the parking lot. Hearing it and seeing it were two completely different things. For some reason, I felt like I need to see it to know it was real.

The back door was open, intertwined legs stretched out in all directions, their bodies heaving. I must have made some noise because their movements stopped abruptly.

Jimmy spotted me, hastily pulling on his pants and muttering about timing and futility. My stepmother, Amy, sat up and stared at me disdainfully.

""Don't stop for her, Jimmy,"" she smirked. She pursed her lips exaggeratedly and grabbed Jimmy's belt. ""I'm not done yet.""

""No...it's not true‚Äî""

My legs were weak, and I backed away muttering. My heart dropped from my chest like a huge lead weight and it was about to crush me.

This must not be true. It just had to be a nightmare. How could my Jimmy betray me? He was always so gentle with me, so patient. This version that stood before me? No, this disdainful Jimmy must be fake... definitely.

Amy looked at me and smiled slowly. Wearing a tight pink leopard-print dress and heavy makeup, she smiled at me smugly. That's when I realized she never intended to see my father for the last time‚Äîthis was why they weren't at my father's funeral.

The grief of last week hit me tenfold and tears welled up in my eyes. Thepain of it all almost doubled for me.

I guess I shouldn't be surprised. Amy had always been an opportunist. Shewas a young stripper who seduced my father in hopes of inheriting his fortune.With his fortune gone, she needed to find safety elsewhere.

""It's over, Beryl. "" Jimmy shrugged as if the past six months meant nothing.

His light words were like a slap in the face to me. Panting, I backed away limply, trying to escape from this nightmare, but my heavy feet seemed to have lost all their strength‚Äî

""Ah......!""

I tripped over my own feet and fell. Embarrassment mixed with despair, tears streaming down my face in an unending waterfall. I opened my mouth but only let out a silent whimper.

I have nothing left. No father. No boyfriend. No stepmother. No home. Nothing...

The dimly lit parking lot enveloped me like a gigantic tomb, and I could hardly breathe. At that moment, I wanted to escape this world with my father.

If there is a god, please help me‚Äî

There was a sudden sound of brakes, and at the same time, a strong white light shot toward me. I had to squint my eyes and reach out to cover my swollen and sore eyes.

A gold Aston Martin pulled into view. It stood before us like a king among peasants. Tall, luxurious, and smooth it looked completely out of place in this dark and dilapidated parking lot.

The car door spread out to the sides like huge black wings, and four tall men stepped out of the car door, walking toward me.

They were each over six feet tall, their muscular frames wrapped in crisp black suits. The headlights poured down from behind them, and their backlit faces were handsome and deep, with sharp lines‚Äî

I had never met such stunning people in my life. I had always viewed Jimmy and my stepmother as a head above the rest, but they surpassed even that. Their appearance and temperament were even better than movie stars.

I could imagine the expressions on their faces without looking back. I even heard the gasp of shock from both of them.

""The world's richest man, Armand Lupine ...why is he here?"" Jimmy murmured.

""My God! This can‚Äôt be. Rich Armand's triplet sons‚Äîstar hockey player Nicholas, world-famous painter Brian, bad boy rock star Cheney...!"" Amy screeched uncontrollably.

Honestly, it felt restrained given who was standing before us. The presence of any of the four of them often led to chaos and screaming girls. When they all appeared together? I definitely believed Amy was restrained in that moment.

I tried to get up from the ground but failed, and a sharp stabbing pain came from the back of my neck, which made me tremble all over. Goosebumps crawled up my flesh. It sent a cascade of sensations through my body, from my toes to my hair.

""Is it her?"" ""It's her... she's my‚Äî""

""No, she‚Äôs mine‚Äî"" ""Apple, lavender... she smells so good."" ""This damn place is too dark.""

Their magnetic and beautiful words spread into my ears chaotically. I saw the tallest of them snap his fingers in the air, and immediately after that, the lights of the entire parking lot came on row upon row.

""My God..."" Jimmy and Amy gasped in surprise again. How did he do that?

Now, I seemed to be in the center of the stage, surrounded by bright daylight, my disheveled hair and red and swollen eyes showed my embarrassment unscrupulously, but‚Äî

In the next second, the eldest, Nicholas, appeared in front of me before his other two brothers joined him at an absolutely inhuman superspeed. The scorching air current and the breath of the waves hit me in an instant, and then he hugged me very easily, bowed down, and kissed me!

# Chapter 2

My eyes widened in disbelief that this stranger, whom I had just met for the first time, would behave so boldly with me. Although he was very handsome and charming.

""Let go of her‚Äîshe's mine!"" ""She is our mate. ‚ÄúYes. Mates.‚Äù A soft voice sounded in my head, startling me further.

The other two, showing their impatience, also rushed toward me. Their scents enveloped me. I was overwhelmed by a mixture of earthy and musky tones. Sandalwood. Leather and tobacco. Citrus with a hint of turpentine. It all wafted

toward me, evoking a sense of warmth and comfort. My breaths shortened and I felt myself growing wetter.

An angry scoff sounded behind me before Jimmy grabbed my arm and unceremoniously lifted me to my feet. He wrapped an arm across my shoulders, pressing me back into his body and eliciting growls from the three more imposing men in front of me.

‚ÄúYou will keep your hands off of my fiance.‚Äù He demanded.

I pushed against his hold in an attempt to extract myself. ‚ÄúYour fiance? We may have had an understanding, but I think that is null and void now.‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause of them?‚Äù He demanded, shoving me forward.

‚ÄúNo, because of you. And her. And the fact that you just told me it was over a few seconds after you pulled out of my stepmother.‚Äù

‚ÄúBaby, don‚Äôt be like that. She was nothing. She was just a mistake. You know I love you.‚Äù

Amy's face contorted with rage, her nostrils flaring and her teeth bared in a feral snarl. She opened her mouth to let out a stream of seething words while Jimmy hurled his hand at her, his palm connecting with her cheek in a sharp stinging slap that echoed across the room.

She staggered backward, stunned by the sudden attack, and then retaliated with a slap of her own that landed on the side of his face with a meaty thwack. The air was thick with tension as they traded insults, their voices rising to a crescendo as they dredged up past hurts and wrongdoings. Each word felt like a bullet fired from a gun‚Äîfast, deadly, and without mercy.

The veins in Amy's neck bulged as she screamed at him, her voice cracking with fury. Her eyes flashed like daggers as they met Jimmy's cold gaze. There was no love left between them now, only hate and pain and regret.

I stood stunned at the exchange. I had never seen this side of either of them and I wasn‚Äôt quite sure how to react. Our companions seemed bored with the exchange, annoyed at the interruption more than anything.

‚ÄúWould you care to join us at the cafe around the corner?‚Äù Armand asked.

‚ÄúYes, please get me out of here.‚Äù

I climbed into the luxury car with them and we drove off, leaving behind my ex-boyfriend and my ex-stepmother.

We pulled up to one of the most exclusive coffee shops in town, and Nicholas opened the door for me with a smirk. Once we were seated in a quiet corner with our drinks, Armand leaned forward and fixed his intense gaze on me. His hand, trembling slightly, touched mine in a gentle gesture of comfort.

""Your father,"" he began, voice thick with emotion, ""was like a brother to me. I watched helplessly as his pain and grief over your mother's passing slowly consumed him until it threatened to overtake him completely. I wish I had been able to do more.""

I felt my stomach clench with surprise. I'd only ever seen the man on television before this moment and suddenly there he was in front of me, speaking of my deceased father with tenderness and respect.

""I didn't agree with your father's wishes to keep you isolated from our world,"" he continued quietly. ""But it wasn't my place to interfere. Please tell me he spoke kindly of me before..."" He trailed off, eyes pleading.

I felt a lump in my throat as I heard his words and forced myself to keep a straight face. My palms were clammy as I was faced with the impossible task of telling him my father had never mentioned him to me before.

So instead I just nodded my head and murmured an agreement. ""My father often spoke of his friends.""

He waved a hand strangely through the air before fixing me with a knowing stare. With his fingers laced, he leaned forward, ‚ÄúI have some...uncomfortable things we need to discuss I‚Äôm afraid. The world as you know it does not actually exist.‚Äù

‚ÄúI...I don‚Äôt understand.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou are not human, not entirely anyway. You see, the world is made up of two kinds: humans and werewolves. We,‚Äù he gestured to himself and his sons, ‚Äúare werewolves. So was your father.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not...I‚Äôm not...‚Äù

‚ÄúYour mother, on the other hand, was human. Werewolves do tend to stick with werewolves, but your father fell in love with your mother and broke tradition.‚Äù

‚ÄúWerewolves,‚Äù I stated dumbly.

‚ÄúWerewolves‚Äù he nodded in confirmation. ‚ÄúThere are far more of us than you even realize. We hold a significant amount of power in this world and control most of the resources. You‚Äôll find that werewolves sit in many power positions from Senator Lucas Chambers to Lila Starr.‚Äù

‚ÄúLila Starr!?‚Äù I screeched before slapping a hand over my mouth and looking around at the other patrons. She was my favorite singer. I aspired to be just like her one day.

‚ÄúYou are a half-werewolf, but there are some additional complications. You are my sons‚Äô mate. They felt the urge to mark you the moment they caught your scent. But, you are still underage. You cannot be marked until after you turn 18.‚Äù

My mouth fell open and my brows furrowed as the weight of his words settled over me. I couldn‚Äôt believe what I was hearing ‚Äì that werewolves were real, that I was somehow connected to these three strangers.

""Mate?"" I asked hesitantly, my heart pounding in my chest with a mixture of fear and excitement. I knew I felt a strange spark between us, but I had always believed mates to be a made-up concept in fantasy books‚Äîwerewolves too if I was being honest.

""Yes, Beryl, mate. While they are still considered rare in our world, many werewolves find their mates after they turn eighteen.""

""Sorry...I think there must be some mistake. I'm human, I don't even have a wolf."" ‚ÄúAre you and your young friend engaged?‚Äù

At his words, I wanted to laugh at the absurdity of his question but caught myself. Nothing about this situation was funny.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what you saw when you arrived, but it certainly wasn't us getting engaged,"" I said firmly. ""Your arrival came just after I found out Jimmy was sleeping with my stepmother. So, no we are most definitely not engaged.""

""I see,"" he said, his voice laced with amusement. ""I apologize for the assumption, Beryl. I only wanted to make sure you were taken care of. I promised your father that

I would watch over you should he pass. I think it would be best if you came home with us.""

My eyes flickered nervously from Armand to his sons. Their gazes felt like a physical weight upon me, boring into my skin like red-hot iron rods. The intensity of their stares made me feel like a deer in hunter's sights‚Äîuneasy and apprehensive.

My body shifted uncomfortably in my chair as I tried to break away from their gaze.

Even though accepting his offer went against every instinct within me‚Äîyou did not say no to the most powerful man in the supernatural world‚ÄîI knew I didn't have a choice.

But, I could not accept his offer.

I felt a surge of anger at his words, but I didn't let it show on my face. ""I appreciate your concern, but I am capable of taking care of myself. I realize that I am only seventeen, but I am perfectly capable of taking care of myself. I have been for some time now.""

‚ÄúYou are at least part werewolf, Beryl. You belong in this world with us. I can assure you protection as the Alpha King,‚Äù

""I don't...I don't think it matters. My father kept me out of your world for a reason. I just want to be an ordinary person, live an ordinary life.""

My voice sounded hollow as I said the words, and I looked away, trying to avoid the intense gazes of Armand and his sons. I felt my heart racing and my hands shaking; this was all too much for me.

The weight of the day's events threatened to overwhelm me: my father's death, Jimmy's betrayal, meeting Armand, discovering his sons were potential mates? My knees felt weak and I was grateful I was already seated. Reaching up, I shielded my face with one hand, still avoiding the triplets' gaze.

""Thank you for everything you did for my father, for coming to pay your respects,"" I said quietly. ""But, I think it's best if I just go home now."" I swallowed hard, suddenly feeling scared. ‚ÄúI appreciate the offer, really,"" I said weakly, ""but I want to stay in my home, at least for now.""

Armand leaned back, his expression unreadable. ‚ÄúVery well,‚Äù he said eventually. ‚ÄúIf that is your wish, we won‚Äôt force you to come with us. But just know that our offer still stands should you change your mind.‚Äù

They returned me to my car in the parking lot of the funeral home. I paused as I stepped out, letting my eyes wander over the rows of cars, unable to shake the feeling that this was somehow a dream.

I stood there for a long time, feeling numb and disconnected from reality; exhausted tears stung my eyes as I tried to process what I had just experienced. Wiping away an errant tear, I slipped into my car and made the short drive home.

A paper notice affixed to the door informed me that I had twenty-four hours to vacate the premises My childhood home‚Äîmy last remaining connection to everything I had ever known‚Äîhad been taken from me too. Another thing lost too soon.

I was penniless and hopeless.

I felt my throat tighten and tears prick behind my eyes. I stumbled from my car and sank to my knees on the asphalt, overwhelmed by hopelessness and loss, sobs wracking through my body.

The golden Aston Martin stopped beside me with little sound. I knew it was them, though. I could smell their now familiar scents, the skin on the back om neck tingling at their proximity.

I wiped the tears from the corners of my eyes, looked up, and saw the four of them stepping out of the car. The triplets stared at me with almost beastly eyes.

Personally, I love reading posts like this, people sharing how they experienced the story, especially when their opinions or emotional responses are completely different from mine. So if you've written something similar, please share it. I'd love to read it!

For Part II, I wanted to do things a bit differently. While playing, I kept a file where I wrote down some thoughts, reactions, things I shouted at the screen, stuff like that. I thought about sharing that file but it's really freaking long and I don't know who would actually want to read the entire thing‚Ä¶ I mean, I would, but I'm kind of weird like that. I'll be quoting parts of the file, hopefully, you'll find it interesting, or at least entertaining :)

Even with my notes in front of me I know I'll miss things, I'm reading through them now and there's so much random nonsense. It's kind of funny, I wrote down tons of thoughts and reactions, but there's zero context. No chapter titles, no locations, nothing.

It took me 15 days to finish the game, way longer than it should've. I didn't check my final playtime, but the last time I played as Abby I was at 23 hours so I'd guess around 24-25 in total. I could've finished it in a couple of days but there were sections that were just SO scary I'd freeze up. I would sit there staring at a door I was too scared to open, then end up scrolling Instagram for an hour and suddenly it's 1 AM and I have to sleep. That's how I ended up only playing only 1 or 2 hours per day.¬†

Just something to keep in mind while reading, quotes in *italic* ""*Like this*"", are my own thoughts that I wrote down while playing, quotes in **bold** ""**Like this**"" are direct quotes from the characters. Anyway, enjoy :)



**DAY 1 - Jackson**

https://preview.redd.it/1xzj5z93vg1f1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=69bc717fad12e2dc296b5e14e4beaf0c694011f2

**Prologue**

Joel's conversation with Tommy about the hospital, those cinematics hit way harder this time. Maybe because in Part I I was too focused on the gameplay and the shock of the ending, but hearing it all laid out again really landed emotionally.

Right after, we step outside into this absolutely stunning place. Jackson already looked great in Part I, but now, in golden hour lighting? Gorgeous. Of course I took some screenshots. I have to say, Part II was so intense and plot-heavy I ended up taking way fewer than I did in the first game.

Back in Ellie's room, the tension between her and Joel is obvious, and it's understandable after what happened in Salt Lake City. Still, the moment ends on a really sweet note. Joel playing and singing for her, then giving her the guitar. That got me emotional.



**Waking Up**

""4 YEARS LATER"". We wake up as Ellie, and I did not expect that kind of time jump, ""*Omg look at you!! All grown up, she's soo cuteee*"".

We're introduced to Jesse through a pretty awkward convo:

""**She kissed me**"", and I'm like ""*WHAT??*""

""**We break up for a week and you make a move on my girl?**"", ""*Excuse me?? Your girl?? What is happening?? Oh he's mad*"".

""**I'm messing with you**"", ""*so.. we're cool? Okay*"".

We find out Ellie has a journal, and I love it. Such a great addition, you get a glimpse into what she's really thinking, the stuff she doesn't say out loud. It adds so much depth.

As we walk through town, we run into the old asshole who made trouble the other night, whatever, and then we finally meet Dina. She's gorgeous. The conversation about what happened last night is a little awkward, but then we team up and absolutely destroy those kids in the snowball fight. 10/10 moment.



**The Overlook**

We meet two new characters, Abby and Owen, and my immediate reaction is: ""*Who the hell is she?*"" and ""*Damn, she's buff*"".

It was already pretty clear to me that these people weren't up to anything good, and I had really mixed feelings about it, ""*I don't want to play as the bad guys*"".

We move forward, clear a couple areas, try out the new mechanics, cool, please give me Ellie back.



https://preview.redd.it/iigr6y06vg1f1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=2bd94856c8d177b6d98f30b4ba96552485072a80

**Patrol**

The game answered my prayers, we're back as Ellie, out on patrol with Dina. Loved this part. There's a bunch of great interactions between them, and we even find out Joel's into old action movies, who would've guessed? I really love how these little details keep adding layers to the characters. When we reach the supermarket and Dina says, ""Spores, masks on"" and it suddenly hits me, these people have no idea Ellie is immune.

After the chaos in the supermarket we lose Dina in the storm and I was genuinely terrified, thinking something way worse was coming. Luckily, it wasn't. We find shelter, the whole scene in the grow room? Easily top 5 Part II moments. Weed and sesbian lex? Let's goo.



**DAY 2 - Jackson**:

**The Horde**

We're back as Abby, ""*Ugh*"". That horde of infected was terrifying, I wasn't expecting something like that at all. I was sprinting for my life, absolutely screaming, ""*WHA- WHO‚ÄôS- JOEL??? TOMMY?? HOLY SHIT*"", stress levels through the roof.

Back to Ellie and Dina, still enjoying themselves. And Ellie's tattoo?? I want it. I need it. At the time, I thought it was wild that Ellie just casually told Dina about the bite, just like I expected Dina didn't believe her. Then Jesse showed up with bad news and just like that, the fun was over.

Back to chaos, the three are still running from the horde, they make it inside the chalet, and things start to feel... off.

Tommy introduces himself and Joel to Abby's group, when Joel says his name? You could feel the tension. It was like the whole room froze, I felt like I was actually there.

This part... this part was something. Back when I wrote my post about Part I, I thought I had it all figured out, ""*It's going to be this amazing story about Ellie growing up with Joel, going on cool, dangerous, emotional adventures, some setbacks for sure, I mean, it's a post-apocalyptic world, but nothing too wild*"", was I wrong.

Abby shoots Joel in the leg and I start screaming ""*EEEEEHHH?? WHAT THE FUUUCKK???!?!*"", ""*OH MY GOD, HIS LEG, HIS LEG IS COMPLETELY FUCKED UP*"", ""*WHAT THE FUCK IS HAPPENING?! THEY JUST SAVED YOUR ASS*"" I couldn't stop. I was yelling the whole time. Abby steps back, and I think, ""*Okay‚Ä¶ okay. She's going to torture him, interrogate him. She wants something. By the time she's done, Ellie and the others will be here. They'll save him. It's going to be fine*"".

Back to Ellie, she's racing toward the chalet, yelling Joel and Tommy's names And I'm yelling at her like, ""*Girl, LOWER YOUR FUCKING VOICE*"".

She gets inside, heads downstairs, opens the door. And there's Joel. On the ground. Covered in blood. Barely conscious.

I start screaming again, ""*SHOOT THAT FUCKING BITCH*"", Ellie gets tackled, they are holding her down and she's screaming the exact same things I am, ""**YOU'RE GONNA FUCKING DIE**"", ""*I'M GONNA KILL YOU*"", and so on.

The scene is overwhelming. My heart's pounding. I'm panicking.

Owen says to Abby, ""**You're done**"", and I think, ""*Okay... Joel's still alive, he's hurt, bad, but he's going to make it. We've been through worse, we'll get through this, we always do, right? Right, Joel?*""

Abby looks down at him, she tightens her grip on the golf club and me and Ellie are begging the same exact thing, ""*No. No no no. Please stop. Please*"".

She strikes him one final time.

I stop screaming. I just let out one long gasp, then silence. I stared at the screen in total disbelief. Not even crying yet, just pure shock. This felt like the kind of thing that happens at the end of a story, not just a couple hours in. Everything I thought this game would be was shattered. I paused the game.

The next scene, Ellie sitting on her bed staring into nothing, that was literally me, just sitting there, silent, for 20 minutes, trying to process what just happened. ""*This can't be real, right? They'll save him, rush him back to Jackson, treat him...*"" Then a knock at Ellie's door, ""*JOEL??*"" How naive. No. It's Tommy. And he brought food. That's when it hit me.

Joel's dead.

He's actually fucking dead.



https://preview.redd.it/9vgkge58vg1f1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=f4e2e7165a9267b54b5887ee79db611877e85a12

**Packing Up**

This part hit me hard. ""The Horde"" had me filled with rage more than anything else, I just wanted to shoot Abby right then and there, I was completely shaken and furious. But this? When I saw Joel's grave it all changed. I immediately started tearing up, fuck, I'm actually crying again while writing this. Seeing all the flowers and letters left on his doorstep? God.

When Ellie went to open the door, her hand trembling... I know that feeling all too well. Once inside I didn't rush anything, I wanted to take it all in, I interacted with every object, explored every room. Upstairs, when she found his watch and pistol I just whispered ""Aww :("", I saw the photo of Joel and young Ellie and immediately started tearing up again, and then the closet... she picked up one of Joel's jacket and smelled it. That was it, I completely lost it, everything I had been holding in burst out in that one moment.

After giving myself a bit of time I kept going, I was so mad at Tommy, of course he'd go after them, it's his damn brother, all that bs he told me before was just to keep me in Jackson.

Today was too much. I couldn't keep playing. I closed the game.

I know what you're thinking, ""Damn girl, how long is this post gonna be?"" don't worry, I'm not diving this deep into every chapter. I just felt like Chapter 1 deserved a bit of extra attention. To me it's by far the heaviest and most important part of the game, and it all happens before the story even really begins.



**DAY 3/5 - Seattle Day 1**

https://preview.redd.it/17jtzt7avg1f1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=2078ff377e3c77d8b762d4daf8c4c57720dd9be7

This part opens up like an open world, which was a cool surprise. We track someone from Abby's group to a TV station, but she's already dead. Ellie finds a photo of the people who killed Joel, now we got faces and names to go after, nice

https://preview.redd.it/6v3tk5edvg1f1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=61871117e468d6e3c4cf2474fcd87eff14a422e5

Then the tunnels happen, and it's pure chaos. Ellie's mask breaks, Dina panics, and for a second I thought we were losing her. We make it to the theater, and just as things start to settle Dina drops the bomb: ""*I think I'm pregnant*"" Ellie: ""**What**"" Me: ""*WHAAAT?!*"" Dina: ""**Don't worry, it's not yours**"", ""*YEAH NO SHIT WHAT ARE YOU EVEN TALKING ABOUT!?!*""

https://preview.redd.it/es6bzx1evg1f1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=e0ad691423ee5888d132e0e5005ce49a50fa5e50

Ellie's birthday flashback, wow. Easily one of the sweetest, most heartwarming moments in the entire game. I was completely floored, like, ""*NO WAY, IT'S ACTUALLY A FREAKING DINOSAUR*"" I started tearing up almost instantly. The whole sequence is just pure joy, it's beautiful, it's funny. Of course it made me miss Joel so much more, this was such an incredible surprise, I didn't expect something like this at all. It's really nice that they didn't just write Joel out of the story, but kept him alive through these memories. And the scene inside the capsule? Absolute perfection.



**DAY 6/9 - Seattle Day 2**

https://preview.redd.it/sfzd6n9fvg1f1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=3a244793a2bc83b3af0e5922a6463b4d8b697bdd

Hillcrest was intense, I really disliked being alone and the abundance of stalkers made it even more terrifying. Jesse's unexpected arrival was a huge relief, unfortunately it didn't last very long

https://preview.redd.it/kzasxqqgvg1f1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=d6c4d6822921d0db4522d41a01e1c6c2c7f651e9

The ""**Finding Strings**"" flashback, I just love these moments and always get overwhelmed with excitement, even though this one was a bit scary, I'll take any second I can get with Joel. Ultimately it did end on a somewhat funny / sweet moment.

Not much to say about the Seraphites, weird cult of fanatics, not a fan. As awful as everything with the Seraphites was in Day 2, it doesn't even come close to what goes down between Ellie and Nora.

https://preview.redd.it/ex3t95mjvg1f1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a8955914f8668a351cda4398aae9b737bdef6a7

This is where we really start to see Ellie lose herself, rage and revenge are eating her alive. The way she kills Nora is brutal, and when she returns to the theater... her hands are trembling, she's in shock. That bathroom scene right after wrecked me, I was holding back tears. There's something so raw about seeing someone in that state‚Ä¶ and the shot of her back just adds to the weight of it all, covered in bruises and cuts... it hit hard.

I was waiting for the game to bring up the whole hospital thing, and they did. That flashback was rough, Ellie confirmed her suspicions, at first I didn't really get why she was so mad, Joel saved her. I eventually (sort of) understood her reasons later on.



**DAY 10 - Seattle Day 3/The Park**

https://preview.redd.it/2x67ewflvg1f1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=a3b2ad93e472fd29d755ca476a0dd41d1f3ae4b1

Day 3 opens with a shot of Ellie‚Äôs back and the sight feels overwhelming as much as the other day, we get to spend some time with Jesse, he's a solid guy and I really liked his character, unfortunately once again we get to see how Ellie is slowly losing herself more and more, prioritising her revenge on Abby over everything else, the two split and Ellie goes once again on a solo mission to find Abby



https://preview.redd.it/aru7dgfqvg1f1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=fc035a8bb5f6e96eaeb684099188ea68cf2631d3

**Infiltration** (*I know I said I wasn‚Äôt going to deep dive into other chapters but I feel like this one is important, sorry :>, future me, also the next one, sorry again, hey it's future me again, just a heads up it will happen a couple more times especially near the end, sorry not sorry I love yapping*)

For the first time I really thought we were nearing the end of the game. I was convinced we'd find Abby at the aquarium, everything felt like it was leading up to that, the atmosphere, the heavy storm, Ellie struggling to keep it together. But nope, Abby's not there. Instead, Ellie ends up killing Mel and Owen, and when she realizes Mel was pregnant she just breaks down, completely overwhelmed. Tommy shows up with Jesse, I was so relieved to see Tommy, ""*My god, finally*"".

I never could've predicted what was coming next. Tommy and Jesse are planning the route back to Jackson, for a brief moment things feel calm, there's this light-hearted exchange between Jesse and Tommy, you catch yourself smiling and forgetting about Abby, forgetting all the darkness for just a second.

Then, a noise. My mind immediately went to Abby ""*I bet it‚Äôs fucking Abby, she must've tracked us down*"" Ellie and Jesse rush to check on Tommy, Jesse gets shot in the face. I let out this short but loud scream, like I was right there and saw it happen with my own eyes. It was sudden, brutal, completely out of nowhere.

And I was right. It's Abby. She's got a gun to Tommy's head, my heart's racing, I have no idea what's about to happen. ""*Is she going to kill him too?*"" Abby turns the gun on Ellie and the screen goes black.

At that point in the game, we still had no idea who Abby really was or why she wanted Joel dead. We knew nothing. So in that moment I was fully on Ellie's side, every kill felt justified, and my hatred for Abby was growing right alongside hers. I wanted her dead more than anything, from my notes: ""*Listen, I don't give a fuck how bad this is going to be, there's nothing joel could have done to this bitch that would make me feel bad for her*"".



**Tracking Lesson**

This chapter is absolutely essential. No one will ever convince me that anyone who played the game and reached this point didn't scream out loud or at least let out a gasp. I personally went with, hold on‚Ä¶ let me check my notes‚Ä¶ ah yes:

""*Doc..?* \[about a 2 second pause\] *AAAEEEEUUUGGGH* (that‚Äôs my interpretation of a loud gasp) *HE‚ÄôS THE DOC- THE DOCTOR, THE SURGEON, THE ONE THAT GOT KILLED BY JOEL, HOLY SHIT IT ALL MAKES SENSE NOW*"".¬†

We get to see the hospital scene from a totally different angle, and it turns out things weren't as black and white as they seemed. Marlene's decision wasn't as simple or heartless as I used to think back in Part I. I remember hating her, feeling completely betrayed and manipulated. In one of my previous posts I wrote something like: ""\[‚Ä¶\] Fuck you, Marlene. I get it, ""One over many"", screw that. They're all going to die one way or another, so who cares if humanity goes out? \[...\]"". That's easy to say when you've only seen one side of the story. Just for the record, if I had to make the choice again, I'd save Ellie every single time, even if it meant killing Abby's dad.

That said, did he deserve to die? Absolutely not, but it was a consequence of its own actions. Okay, but Abby not only didn't deserve to get her father killed, she also didn't do anything that would lead to the father's dead, so was her rage and actions against Joel justified? Joel made a choice driven by love, selfish, but deeply human. Abby was fueled by grief and needed someone to blame, Ellie wanted to make sense of a loss that shattered her. They're both stuck in this cycle of revenge, thinking it will bring them peace, but all it does is destroy more of who they are. They're both right in their own way, and both wrong in how they deal with it. ¬†



**DAY 11/13 - Seattle Day 1/2/3**:

I'll try to keep these three chapters as brief as I can, with a bit more detail once I get to ""**The Confrontation**"".

At the time I really hated that the game was forcing us to play as Abby. It pissed me off because I knew exactly what they were trying to do, make us understand her, see things from her side, and eventually feel empathy for her. But I didn't want that, I was still full of anger, ""*What, now I'm just supposed to play as the villain? As the one who killed Joel? No way*"". All I wanted was to get back to the theater and see something like Dina coming up from behind and putting a bullet in Abby's head.

After hearing that Owen may have killed a WLF soldier to save a Seraphite, Abby sets out to find him. She gets captured by Seraphites and is saved by Yara and Lev. They battle through infected and WLF, forming a bond built on fragile trust. Abby eventually finds Owen at the aquarium, and after a tense and emotional night they reconnect intimately.

Abby goes back to Yara and Lev after that nightmare and finds Yara in critical condition, so she brings them to the aquarium and Mel agrees to do surgery if they can get supplies from the hospital. The Hotel part was already terrifying, but nothing compared to ""**Ground Zero**"". At the hospital Abby gets caught but Nora helps her sneak into the basement. I can't explain how fucking terrifying and stressful this section was, I kept putting it off, scrolling through Instagram, and it ultimately took me 2-3 hours. The Rat King? I was screaming, barely looking with one eye half open. Scariest moment in the series, hands down

https://preview.redd.it/s21ipm0tvg1f1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c7248ab78c31553c17c52e271c6409a11faf99f

By Day 3 I had come to understand and accept Abby, and I was genuinely enjoying playing as her. If I'm not mistaken she has three dreams in the Firefly hospital, and for the first time she wakes from a peaceful one of her father, it was really sweet. She was on the path to redemption, with Yara and Lev helping shape her into someone new. On the way to the marina, Abby joins Manny to deal with a sniper, I was shocked when it turned out to be Tommy, just moments before I was rooting for Abby and Manny to take that fucker down, and suddenly I didn't know how to feel. A perfect example of how easy it is to pick a side without the full picture. Tommy kills Manny, Abby nearly dies, and Yara saves her and they get to the Seraphite island to find Lev.

They push through during the WLF invasion and find Lev devastated after killing his mother in self-defense, It was such an intense scene, how could a mother treat her own child like that? The three attempt to flee but are caught by Isaac, when Abby refuses to surrender Lev, Yara sacrifices herself to save them. I went into this mission already expecting that one of them wouldn't make it, but I didn't think it would happen like that. I really feel for Yara, she was a true fighter.

Abby and Lev escape the island and get back to the aquarium, only to find Mel and Owen, dead. Abby is shattered. Here we find out exactly how Abby was able to track Ellie down, when Ellie left with Tommy and Jesse, she left her map on the ground, Lev found it and gave it to Abby. One small thing that got overlooked and changed everything.

What if Ellie hadn't left the map behind? I know it's kind of a pointless question, we could say the same about anything. Like, what if she looked left instead of right, saw a butterfly, followed it, and then missed a trap and died in an explosion, game over. Still, I do think that if she hadn't left the map, she and the others probably would've headed back to Jackson like they were planning to, and I doubt Abby would've risked following them there. Then again, who knows if Ellie would've actually gone back. It's just a never-ending loop of what ifs. Anyway, I'm rambling, sorry.



**The Confrontation**

The anticipation for this chapter was insane. I'd been playing for three days and couldn't stop thinking about what was waiting back at the theatre. I kept imagining hundreds of different outcomes, and every time I thought about it the scenario in my head got worse. As I walked in as Abby and started heading downstairs my heart was pounding, as I already knew Abby surprises Tommy from behind, Ellie and Jesse burst in, Jesse gets shot... and then? I had no idea. All those outcomes I had imagined? Completely vanished, suddenly my mind was blank, I didn't know what to expect anymore.

Tommy jumps on Abby, Lev shoots him in the leg, and Abby shoots him in the head, I'm fucking screaming. My first thought was, well, that's it for Tommy, actually, here's a quick entry from my notes:  
""*NOOOOO WAHT THE FUUUUUUUUUCKKKKKKKKKKK WHAT THE FUUUUUUUUUCK, WHY AM I STILL PLAYING AS THIS FUCKING BITCH GIVE ME ELLIE, ELLIE DONT YOU DARE FUCKING DIE TOO*""

As you can probably guess in that moment everything I had come to appreciate and understand about Abby just went straight out the window. While chasing Ellie all I wanted was to get shot, I didn't even try to shoot back once. It wasn't until I realized that if I wanted to finish the game I had to follow where the story was taking me, so I gave in and went along with it.

The first ""hide and seek"" part wasn't too hard, but every time a cutscene showed them fighting I was just SCREAMING, hoping Ellie would finally get the upper hand, only for her to get beaten down again and again.¬†

The floor collapses and the second phase of this whole ""hide and seek"" (I hate calling it hide and seek, is there a better name for this sequence?) thing begins, way harder this time. I honestly lost count of how many times I died. Ellie is insanely fast and her movements are so unpredictable, there's basically no way to hit her if you're even slightly in front of her, she can dodge bottles and because that wasn't enough she starts using traps and I'm seriously sweating, just trying to not get caught because I'd made it this far and didn't want to mess up and start all over again.

The moment Abby starts choking Ellie had me jumping up and down on my chair screaming, this time it was way too close. Ellie manages to pull out her knife and stab Abby in the leg, the gameplay keeps going.¬†

The whole time I'm thinking, what's it gonna be? Who's coming out on top? Is the game really making me kill Ellie?? Then another cutscene, Abby breaks Ellie's arm, that's it, there's no way Ellie's winning, she's just getting punched over and over and I'm yelling, and then ""*OEEEAAEEHH* (excited scream) *DINAAAA, YEAAAAH CUT HER UP!*"", Lev shoots Dina in the shoulder, ""*FUUUUUUCK*"", now I'm panicking for Dina, she's getting her head smashed, Abby pulls out her knife and I'm losing it, I thought for sure Dina was done for. It would've made sense, Ellie went after everyone Abby loved and now Abby's doing the same, right?¬†

""**She's pregnant**"", and Abby replies ""**Good**"". I'm screaming even louder, but thankfully Lev steps in, if it weren't for him Abby would've 100% slit Dina's throat. ""**Don't ever let me see you again**"".

I'm thinking this must be it, now that they're even there's nothing else worth going after. And the screen, once again, goes black.

""*WEELL???*""



**Still Day 13** **-** **The Farm**

https://preview.redd.it/p5j3xmcuvg1f1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=6a1a11677d60160aa6b010191d2eeceb9a986d6c

Suddenly we're looking at this house in the middle of a beautiful landscape. ""*ELLIE!?... Joel's watch :( ‚Ä¶ THE BABY!?!? Wait, how much time has passed? Dina was only a few weeks pregnant in Seattle, so‚Ä¶ about 9 months for the pregnancy, and now the baby has a full head of hair and can sit up on his own‚Ä¶ maybe 6 months old? So like, a year and 3 months? Damn‚Ä¶ are we actually getting a happy ending??*""

On the way to the tractor I saw the sheeps and realized this was literally Dina's dream, she talked about it back in Seattle, I think at the synagogue? Anyway, the whole thing felt unreal, after spending the last two weeks going through the most horrific things imaginable, suddenly there's this calm‚Ä¶ it doesn't feel right, it feels like a dream. When Ellie goes to round up the sheep I peeped the inside of the barn and my first thought was, ""*The barn looks way to scary, I swear if this is actually a dream that turns into a nightmare or something I‚Äôm uninstalling on the spot*"" Reality was, this was much, much worse than a nightmare.

What follows is incredibly real, raw, and terrifying. As Ellie goes near the lamb one of the shovels falls and triggers a quick flash of Joel. She follows the lamb outside but a gust of wind slams the barn door shut leaving Ellie in total darkness, she immediately breaks down, slipping into a full on PTSD-triggered flashback, reliving what happened at the chalet. Dina rushes in, and we're met with this soul-crushing image of Ellie on the ground, sobbing, her face showing pure terror and the disorientation afterwards.

I just rewatched that scene to make sure I had everything in the right order because I tend to mix things up sometimes, and I couldn't help but cry again. These are the kinds of scenes that really hit me the hardest, I just can't handle watching someone in that much emotional and mental pain.

In the next scene Ellie comes back from hunting and there's a horse outside the house, I honestly didn't even notice it at first and I'm only mentioning it now after rewatching that part to help me write this and I just realized that I completely missed it, most likely because I was still processing everything that had just happened moments before. Needless to say, I wasn't expecting anyone to be inside the house, let alone Tommy. I doubt anyone was, I mean, unless I missed some clues somewhere, the guy got shot in the fucking head. So yeah, seeing him alive was a total surprise, and a good one at first, I was really happy to see him again.

But that feeling didn't last long. As soon as he said, ""**I got something to show you**"" something felt off, and then he pulled out that damn map, I just sat there in disbelief while he talked about Abby and everything else, and now I'm \[‚Ä¶\]

Sorry, future me here, I just realized how many times in this post I've said that I felt exactly like Ellie, at the exact same moments she did. And I can't help but think that's probably a deliberate effect of the brilliant writing behind this story. It's like every time you're feeling something, the character is too, and they manage to pull that off every single time. It's honestly crazy.

Anyway, \[‚Ä¶\] going from confused to straight-up angry, like, what the fuck is wrong with him? Why would he bring this up again? Did the bullet mess with his brain or something? Those were the thoughts running through my head. But then I looked at Ellie's face and my anger started shifting into fear. She's thinking about it, of course she is. She never stopped, how could she?

Tommy's last two comments before leaving were completely uncalled for, but I get where they're coming from (*not that it makes them okay*). His leg is fucked, he's lost an eye, he can't go after Abby himself anymore, that promise Ellie made? He held onto that, for months. Tommy's no different from Ellie, or even Abby for that matter (*well, Abby was actually able to move on by now but you get what I‚Äôm trying to say*), they're all carrying unimaginable loss, all trying to cope in whatever way they can, even if it's the wrong way and in the end they're all chasing the same thing: peace.

Next up we get a shot of Dina and JJ in bed. As the camera slowly pulls back, it becomes clear that someone is missing‚Ä¶ and there's this sound of wind, like a door or window was left open. I both hate and love how they mess with us in scenes like this. Of course, my first thought was, ""*No she fucking didn't*"" (as in, Ellie already left). But no, she's still here, just sitting silently on the bed.

This entire sequence, just like the start of the chapter feels unreal, like a dream, actually a nightmare this time, I totally expected an infected to just grab me through a window and then she'd suddenly wake up in a panic, all sweaty or something.

I realized I could go into Ellie's room, but before triggering anything I wanted to walk around the house. She stumbles on her guitar, her playing always hits me emotionally, every single time. Then I finally went upstairs and into her room, she pulls out her journal from the box. We get a look at the most recent entries and find out she's been having those flashbacks again and again‚Ä¶

""**When will this stop?**"",

""**I don't want to talk about it. It's just gonna hurt.**"",

""**I feel so guilty.**"",

""**My skin hurts.**"",

""**Can I leave it all behind?**"".

Suddenly we're back in Jackson. At first I wasn't sure if this was future or past Ellie but then I noticed her longer hair, and once they showed her face, it was clear this was past Ellie. Then Jesse appears on screen, which was such a pleasant surprise, I really, really liked him as a character and honestly feel like he didn't get enough screen time.

Ellie says something I can't quite remember word for word, but it was along the lines of ""**You'll get back together in two weeks**"" referring to Jesse and Dina, and that's when it finally clicked, this was the night Dina kisses Ellie. I was so excited, it was a really awkward, funny, sweet moment‚Ä¶ until that old dickhead showed up. I genuinely felt bad for Joel in that moment and the whole situation instantly turned painfully uncomfortable.

We're back at the farm, and we see Ellie packing... I already know what this means, and I'm begging to be wrong, begging for her to stay. Dina knows it too, it's obvious.

""**I have to finish it**"", the look on Dina's face says it all. It's the same expression I had, I was hoping Ellie wouldn't say something like that.

""**You don't owe Tommy anything.**""

""*It's not about Tommy...*""

""**I don't sleep. I don't eat. I'm... I'm not like you, Dina.**"", probably referring to how Dina (at least to her eyes), managed to move on, or at least cope, with everything, including Jesse. Ellie even touches on that in her journal...

""**Stay.**""

""**I can't.**""

""**We've got a family. She doesn't get to be more important than that.**""

Unfortunately Ellie hasn't come to that realization yet, and I can't blame her. After everything she's been through, how could she possibly think clearly? She's not driven by logic at this point, she's driven by pain, by loss, by everything she's had to carry since that day in the chalet. It's not even about revenge anymore, she just wants the pain to stop, and the only way she sees that happening is by getting Abby out of her head, once and for all. And to her the only way to do that is to finish what she started. What other option does she see? There's no peace, no closure, not until she tries. Even if it costs her everything. At least that's how I see it.

Now I'm completely thrown off. When this chapter started, I genuinely thought that was it, Ellie and Dina, finally getting to live the quiet life they deserve. But suddenly we're back on Abby's trail and I'm just thinking, seriously? How much longer is this going to drag on? It feels like the third time this cycle starts over and each time I'm convinced it's going to end with Ellie dead.

Today was really something. The chapter was short but really intense, I couldn't bring myself to keep going, I just saved the game and closed it. I spent the rest of the day lying in bed. Call it pathetic if you want, I don't care. When you spend nearly a month @ (between Part I and Part II), living in this world, walking in the shoes of this one character, it gets to you. You see this character grow, go through moments of light and darkness (mostly darkness), and it becomes impossible not to get attached, to the point where they're all you can think about.

@ Yes, almost a full month. I'm slow, my first playthrough took around 17 or 18 hours and almost a week to finish because it was my first time playing a horror game and I couldn't handle more than an hour or two a day, plus, I have this bad habit of gaming only at night, which didn't help. And as you can see, Part II is taking me twice as long.



**Day 14/15 -** **Santa Barbara/The Farm Epilogue**

Unrelated to the chapter, but I just ran this whole post through a character count tool and I'm already over 32k which is kind of insane, I've got just under 8k characters left before hitting Reddit's 40k limit, and honestly I have no idea how I can expect anyone to read all of this. If you made it this far, you're an absolute legend, I seriously appreciate you and I hope you found the post at least a little entertaining, or that some of my thoughts gave you something interesting to think about. Fun fact: I nominated Ellie exactly 69 times. Anyway, back to the chapter.



**Santa Barbara**

\[Had to erase this part because I exceeded the Reddit character limit and I honestly don't know what else to delete, you can find it in the comments\]

One of the Rattlers nearly gets bit by the clicker, blah blah blah, you know what happens, I'm running out of characters (quite embarrassing actually, can you believe that this post is almost as long as Reddit allows?) and want to get to the point already. When we reach the beach I was stuck for a bit, I didn't know what to do, then I heard coughing and looked up and¬† realized I could interact with someone tied to the cross and, holy shit it's Abby. She's completely unrecognizable, she looks absolutely wrecked, malnourished, her hair is different.I interact with her and she just says, ""**It's you.**"" I can't even imagine what's going through her mind, probably thought she was about to get stabbed.

But Ellie cuts her down, Abby helps Lev down, then looks back at Ellie, and kind of invites her along, saying there are boats. So now I'm sitting there thinking, ""*WELL??? SO WHAT NOW WE JUST GO HOME?*""

They each go to their boats, and‚Ä¶ Ellie sees Joel again and remembers what made her come here in the first place. She grabs Abby and throws her into the water, Abby doesn't want to fight but Ellie pulls her knife on Lev and I completely lose it. I'm yelling at the screen (as usual), begging her not to go through with it, Abby agrees to fight and it's brutal. By this point I had come to terms with my anger toward Abby that was reignited during the theatre part. I genuinely wanted both of them to live, but more than anything I wanted Ellie to get what she came for so yeah I guess in a way I also indirectly wanted Abby dead

As Ellie's drowning Abby, she gets another flashback of Joel, fuck I'm tearing up again, Jesus, sorry. This time it's different, he's sitting on the patio, playing his guitar. Smiling. Peaceful. Ellie lets Abby go.



**The Farm Epilogue**

We're back at the farm and the house already looks abandoned from the outside, then it hit me, Ellie killed that fat Rattler who said Abby had been taken months ago. I don't know exactly how much time passed between Tommy tracking her and Abby being captured but it couldn't have been too long, factor in the trip to Santa Barbara, which is what, two or three states away? All by foot? And then back, it had to be at least a couple of months. Dina must have been alone all that time, she clearly knew where Ellie was going and must've had an idea of how long it might take, but I doubt she stayed much longer after Ellie left. At that point it wasn't about holding onto hope that she'd come back, Ellie had made her choice, and Dina understandably didn't take it well.

So yeah, I wasn't surprised to find the house empty, and neither was Ellie by the looks of it. I checked every room just in case Dina had left a note or something, but I wasn't really expecting to find anything. Ellie's room was almost untouched.

Ellie picks up her guitar one more time. Until that moment it hadn't even crossed my mind that she‚Äôs wouldn't be able to play anymore because she had lost two fingers on her fretting hand. Ellie strums a few broken notes, looking completely devastated.

Then we're back with Joel, on the patio, that same flashback she had during the fight with Abby. I was crying like hell, both when I played it and now writing this. The conversation goes from ""coffee, nice"" to ""I should've died in that hospital"" in an instant. I mentioned earlier in this post that I didn't really understand why she would think that. But I think I do now, she believed that was her purpose, even if she didn't know she was going to die at the time, she knows now, and still, she feels like that should have been her fate. Maybe because that idea that her life only had meaning if it was sacrificed, was planted in her from a very young age. It's easy to instill certain beliefs in children, and if those thoughts aren't addressed, especially something that significant, they can carry them into adulthood and continue to believe them. Back at the farm, the ending couldn't be more heartbreaking, Ellie sets the guitar down and walks away, the screen turns back one final time.



**Conclusions**

There's a lot I would like to talk about but I've actually got a couple hundreds of characters left so I'll just get this one point across: Everyone calling Ellie a cold-blooded murderer is wrong. ""But she killed hundreds of WLF, Seraphites, blah blah blah"" No. You did that, not Ellie. That's the gameplay part, realistically she would've gone through most of it without killing anyone, and the people she does kill are those who leave her no choice. The only exception is Nora, but even then it's not like Ellie walks away unaffected, she was shaking and was left visibly traumatized by what she did. She's not a monster, she's a 19 year old girl who lost everything, including herself.

Jesus It's 4AM and I just finished proof-reading everything, this post took me about 3 days to write and I really hope that someone reads at least half of it but I don't expect anyone to. Anyway.

Thank you for reading :)

1kpbhbv,https://www.reddit.com/r/reactivedogs/comments/1kpbhbv/my_top_10_tips_for_reactivity/,My Top 10 Tips for Reactivity,"Reactivity can be so isolating to try and train. You feel embarrassed, alone, and frustrated. I am a CPDT-KA certified dog trainer who is also working towards getting a CDBC certification. I specialize in reactivity, aggression and behavior modification, and I wanted to share the top 10 things that help my clients and my own dogs who struggle with reactivity. 

1. Change the way YOU see and think about reactivity. Your dog does not wake up every morning, stretch, rub their little paws together and think: ""okay, when I see a *trigger* I'm gonna lose it and make my human feel awful! This sounds like a great day!"" Your dog isn't GIVING you a hard time, they are HAVING a hard time. Have you ever had a panic or anxiety attack, or know someone who struggles with them? The people dont choose to get triggered and go into an attack. No one would choose that. Our reactive dogs aren't making a conscious choice to react, they just do. As their guardians, it is then up to us to empathize with the huge emotional response they are having and do our absolute best to help them through it and prevent the practice in the future.

2. Behavior is driven by reinforcement. There is no behavior that dogs continue performing for any length of time that doesn't work for them in some way. Reactivity is no different. That means to make real, lasting, effective change, we need to figure out why our reactive dogs are doing it in the first place. Something is working for them. Personally, my dogs were traumatized by being in the streets and getting attacked during their formative socialization period, and thus have a well-earned and healthy fear of other dogs. My dogs are screaming ""GO AWAY!"" For others, they may be so incredibly excited to see another dog that they loose their mind and the built up frustration causes them to react. In many lessons, my clients think that the dog is just protective. I will say that VERY few dogs are actually protecting their owner. They may be trying to ""protect"" their personal space, but that stems from fear, not protection of their human. So think about it, why is your dog reacting?

3. Reactive neurons fire in a quick burst in response to a stimulus. After that reaction is over, those neurons are still firing! That means it is more likely for our dogs to react towards a trigger that may not have set them off after a large reaction earlier. This is called Trigger Stacking. It's kind of like when we wake up late, stub our toe walking to the bathroom, find we are out of toothpaste, forgot to get coffee for this morning and then leave to go to work. Those things individually wouldn't be a deal breaker for most of us (minus the life-water of coffee), but having those events happen within a short amount of time from one another can ruin our day. Same with our dogs and their triggers. If your dog is trigger stacked, dont try to train through it. Go home, let them work on some relaxation activities (licking/chewing/smelling) to de-escalate their system and then try again later.

4. Your dog KNOWS where the triggers are on your daily walking route. Dogs are great at identifying patterns. By now, your dog knows where the dogs are in your neighborhood. The ones behind the fences, who will bark at the glass, etc. Something I do with my dogs, and recommend all of my clients to do, is to change up your walking route. There will be new smells for your dog (which will engage their brain and lower their reactivity response as a result), and they won't know where the other dogs are. Personally, I love going to a larger walking park near my home. Do I have to get up earlier to fit it into my schedule? Yep. But to keep my sanity in check while on a walk, lower both mine and my dogs stress, and actually enjoy our walks together, it is well worth it. 

5. Practice makes perfect. This goes for reactivity as well. Any behavior that gets practiced will become improved and refined. That's why we see reactivity progress from pulling and whining to lunging, growling and barking. We need to stop our dogs from practicing. That doesn't mean avoid your triggers. That's impossible. It does mean when we see a trigger, we need to assess the distance and either create the space we need or get to work with our dogs. Every dog will have a distance they can see a trigger, notice it, and not go to Mars. For my dogs, it started at about 100 yards (football field). We had to start somewhere. Once we were at a working distance, we began playing training games. Over the course of 2 years we went from 100 yards to 10ft. We can even pass other reactive dogs actively reacting without my dogs even giving them the time of day. That took time and commitment, but it is very much worth it for the relationship, very predictable responses, and lasting results I have with my dogs now.

6. We cannot afford to be lazy dog owners. Believe me, I want to be able to be on my phone and scrolling or watching my shows while I'm walking my dogs. But as a reactive dog owner, every walk is a training walk. I come prepared with different values of treats (kibble, freeze dried, and some sort of meat or peanut butter squeeze) and their favorite toy. Listening to a podcast with one ear open is totally fine, but we cannot afford to be on our phones on our walks. We need to be aware of the environment around us and aware of what our dogs are experiencing. 

7. If your dog has gone to Mars, you're TOO CLOSE. We do not get to decide what is scary/triggering for our dogs. They decide it, even though the object may seem harmless or arbitrary to us. The best thing we can do if they go into a full-blown reaction is to create space from the object. Just turn and go. This is why I recommend that reactive dogs wear well-fitted, Y-front, front-connect harnesses. That way, if I need to turn and go, I can turn and get out of there without hurting my dog. No training can be done when a dog is going to Mars. I don't care if you are waving a piece of Wagyu steak in front of their nose, or trying to tell them to Sit. They aren't aware of anything at that point. You NEED to create space.

8. Engage/Disengage - my all-time favorite game to play with reactive dogs. At a good distance (that's the key), when your dog looks at a trigger, mark it ""YES!"" and then toss a treat away while saying ""Go Find It"". This does a couple things. It marks the moment our dog sees a trigger and doesn't go to Mars. The marker word ""yes"" just means: I like what you did, a reinforcement is on the way (food, treat, toy, scratches, me acting a fool, etc.). So in that situation, I essentially said: ""I like it when you look at a trigger and dont react."" By tossing a ""Go Find It"" we are able to redirect our dogs brain down to the ground, away from the trigger and engage into an activity to help them not go over threshold. When they find the treat, eat it, then look back at the trigger, I'm going to do the exact same thing. Eventually your dog chooses to look at you for a treat when they see a trigger rather than  barking/lunging/over threshold. This takes time, consistency, yummy treats/toys, and patience. 

9. Are YOU reactive? It's a human response to stress to take shallower breathes and tense up. Your dog is an expert observer of your body language, and they notice that! So we can inadvertently trigger our dogs into reacting with our own reactions. So the next time you see a trigger on a walk, take note of what you do. 

10. Give it time. Training reactivity isn't like training ""Sit"". We are talking about behavior modification work. And that work takes time. I wish there was a magic wand, magic tool, magic treat, magic pill that could ""cure"" our dogs. But there isn't. This will take time, consistency, and patience. 

In the end, if your dog could tell you ""Thank you"", they would. We only have on average 12-13 summers with our dogs. Their lives are so short compared to ours. Love them hard. Every dog out there is working on something. What our dogs are working on just happens to be louder and more visible to the public. So train with patience, and keep at it!

Bonus number 11. SniffSpot is a fabulous app for reactive or aggressive dogs. You reserve a backyard/green space for a set amount of time. There will be no other dogs or people there besides you. On days when I dont feel well, dont have the mental energy to devote to a training walk, or I'm just looking for a different adventure that day, I rent one of these to let my dogs run around off-leash and get some great new smells. 

These are just my thoughts and my philosophy on working with reactivity. I do not believe my way is the only way, and I am very open to other thoughts and opinions. I love discussing different training methodology and practices! I hope this helps someone who may be struggling with reactivity. ‚ù§Ô∏èüê∂",20,1747541815.0,reactivedogs,1,0.92,False
