Salutations everyone !
How are we all ?

I’m here today on the look for friends!  (short term / long term) 
Here’s some interesting stuff about me !

Well I’m from Ireland and I’m in uni ! And I’m 23
I’m nerdy, heavily enjoy fantasy and grimdark settings, so massive LOTR, elder scrolls, GOT/HOTD and Warhammer fan.
I play on PC (total war, arma 3, Hoi4, stellaris and many more ) and ps5 (Elden ring, battlefield) 


Im also big into history, specifically military history!! I’m a history student in fact , my areas of study are Roman/Greek, military, Irish and archaeology! 
I’m a pagan, Norse pagan 

My fav food is a toastie and I love coffee n tea! 

I hope to hear from someone soon and if you have read this far, no hey, hi or hellos, write an introduction!!",0,1732680545.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,0.5,False

Winter can be bleak and having someone to stay active with can make staying active more fun and plus you get a friend out of it! :)

I’m a certified mat Pilates instructor and am always down to teach for free too!

I have a Planet Fitness membership and typically go to the one near Myrtle-Wyckoff, and I can bring a guest for free. 

If this sounds good to you, let’s hit the gym and grab a coffee or smoothie after!! ",3,1732680486.0,Bushwick,0,1.0,False
1h0vnxn,https://i.redd.it/ksmrr5lmcd3e1.jpeg,"36M, Virginia, United States ","I've been lurking in the background of this group for a bit, I might as well attempt one of these intro posts to see what kind of responses it might get.

Precise location is Radford, VA

Area of study/work:

Currently, I split my work life between roasting coffee for a couple of local coffee shops and working as retail supervisor. 

I'm considering taking a step in a different vocational direction, possibly towards law enforcement. I've also considered finding a way to go back to school to pursue a degree in counseling.

Hobbies/interests:

I like to be outside; hiking or hanging out by a campfire are amazing. 

I enjoy chilling with a good good book and something to sip on. Sometimes that something is coffee or tea, sometimes it's whiskey or vodka. 

I have three dogs. They come with me as long as they're still around. 

Tell us a bit about your Christian journey: 

Christ saved me when I was eighteen and about two months away from graduating high school. When I went to college, I became involved with Campus Crusade for Christ. In some roundabout ways, that lead me to the church that I'm still a part of today. 

The church I go to is something along the lines of reformed Baptist. My theological stances probably don't stray too far from that base, but I tend to lean a bit more charismatic and egalitarian.

I think a lot about how the Spirit dwells in us and sanctifies us. I pray earnestly that He grow within me the Fruit of the Spirit and that He uses trials and suffering to develop my perseverance and character.

What sort of person are you looking for?
I'd like to meet someone who loves Jesus and seeks to abide in Him.

Emotional intelligence is hugely important. I'd like to be able to talk with one another about how we're doing: Debrief our days with each other for the sake of processing and supporting each other.

I'm a fairly grounded person. I'd like to meet someone similar.

It's not necessary, but it would be amazing to be with someone that would enjoy brewery/distillery, coffee shop, and hiking dates 

Age range:

25ish to 40ish

Would you be willing to do long distance/relocate? 

I'd prefer not to.

1h0vnvs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amtrak/comments/1h0vnvs/its_2024_amtrak_needs_to_put_qr_code_stickers_in/,It's 2024. Amtrak needs to put QR code stickers in the sleeper units.,"Amtrak is understaffed. I get it.

They also run a bunch of different sleeper cars with different amenities. Fine.

But the lack of info is inexcusable when a QR link to a website with info on this type of sleeper unit on this type of car can fill people in on the details.

My mother-in-law went 20 hours not knowing there was a toilet in her roommette. She's 80+ years old, so it would've been helpful for her to know she didn't have to walk through the car and up/down stairs. 

If a car is too damn hot or too damn cold? Where are the HVAC controls and how do they work.

Can't hear the announcements or don't want to get blasted out of your dreams at 7am? Here's the volume control.

Is there coffee? Where.

Is there a shower? Where. What do I do with the towel? Are there shower hours or can I take one any time?

What time does the attendant go to bed and when should you push/not push the button to get the bed put down/up.

Literally just heard someone in the hall asking if there's water. Where. 

Just wondered myself whether I throw the plates away in the trash after eating in my room (which I usually don't do).

Does Grandpa have brittle bones? Maybe he shouldn't try to get to the bathroom between x and x where the tracks are particularly bad like the guy did on a trip about a year ago who ended up doing something *bad* to his elbow when he stumbled and had to get off the train and onto an ambulance.

There's a closet hidden in the doorframe? Gosh, that would be good to know.

There's a cubby hole big enough for a carryon above the hidden toilet? Also valuable info that should be shared.

The attendants don't have time to explain all the features to everyone. Understandably. They're understaffed. So Amtrak needs to step up and make some damn ""welcome to your room"" web pages or videos to introduce passengers to the space and procedures.

It's not rocket science. It's basic stuff. In 2024.

Source: Been riding Amtrak cross country for a years now, on different lines. Their slogan should be ""Amtrak. It's always different!"" because everything is so inconsistent. I'm not a ""Train Person,"" just a person who knows something about marketing and how good it would be to distract newly boarded sleeping car passengers with solid information while they wait for the attendant to stop by. Kind of like a safety video and card on a plane.

It would also save the attendant a lot of questions/time. In fact, just ask the attendants what passengers always asks and build the web pages or videos based on that. Do everyone a favor.

(I'm mainly looking for the opinion of SDs but fellow SBs feel free to also throw your two cents in.)

Photo notes: I have a few face pictures and a private body picture for now as it's a little risqué. 

About me:

-  Curvy, short and natural
-  Experimental and explorative
-  Playful, intelligent and adventurous

You'll find that I'm always up for a laugh, lending an ear (or shoulder) and just as happy with a night-in as a night out.

I like to be creative, so if you don't mind me showing you the latest thing I'm working on we should get along fine! 

Looking to explore, in more ways than one, now that I have some free time. Submissive or dominant, based on what compliments you.

I enjoy having thoughtful conversations that aren't forced, coffee, guitar, music, socialising, reading, and art.

If you want to know anything beyond that then you'll just have to ask. 😉

What I'm Looking For:

I'm looking for someone intelligent, with a sense of humour and a positive worldview.

I value a lover who is comfortable expressing and and communicating feelings while being able to provide comfort and security.

Attentiveness is also important (on both sides) when we're together, shown in little ways. However, I'm still comfortable respecting busy schedules and independence.

Mentorship is also something I'm interested in if you have experience in the legal field. 

You don't need to have public photos but a face to put a name to is always appreciated once we start chatting.

\--

If you manage someone else’s money in any shape or form, one requirement from the regulator is that you shouldn’t have defrauded anyone in the past. Sure, it’s basic, but it’s also tough to meet because there is a non-insignificant overlap between people that enjoy both fraud and managing other people’s money.

Earlier this month, SEBI [issued an order](https://www.sebi.gov.in/enforcement/orders/nov-2024/interim-order-in-the-matter-of-embassy-office-parks-management-services-private-limited_88223.html) asking Embassy REIT to suspend its CEO Aravind Maiya. The reason being that Maiya had been caught up in an unrelated fraud from a few years back, and had also been debarred from being an auditor.

Until 2019 Maiya was an auditor at ~~KPMG~~ BSR & Co, which is an audit firm that most people recognise as KPMG India. At the time, BSR was the auditor for Coffee Day Enterprises Ltd, the company owning the CCD brand. CCD’s owners turned out to have embezzled money from CCD to another company that they owned. Maiya was the guy responsible for ensuring that CCD’s financials, which was a publicly listed company, were correct.

Well, he did a horrible job.

# Draining out the coffee

Here’s a slightly dramatic look into one of the ways in which VG Siddhartha, the founder of CCD (who unfortunately killed himself) stole money from the company:

1. He kept a bunch of cheques in his table drawer. Each of those cheques were pre-signed by CCD’s CFO (and whoever else whose signature was needed to make a transaction).
2. Next he would draw a cheque for a few hundreds or thousands of crores in favour of a company called Mysore Amalgamated Coffee Estates. The company was owned by his dad. Supposedly, it sold coffee beans and that’s what CCD was paying for.
3. On his way back home from work, he likely dropped the cheque in his bank’s cheque deposit box.

Sure yes, he probably didn’t deposit his cheques himself and sent someone else to do it for him. But the idea is generally right. Here’s a couple of snippets from a SEBI order against CCD [from last year](https://www.sebi.gov.in/enforcement/orders/jan-2023/order-in-the-matter-of-coffee-day-enterprises-ltd-_67495.html):

>I note that the Noticee has itself admitted that VGS, the Promoter and CEO, was running the entire show within CDEL and its subsidiaries. It has further admitted that VGS used to collect the signed blank cheques and all the fund transfers were done by him

And,

>CDEL in its submissions to SEBI had stated that CDGL had regular coffee procurement relationship with MACEL \[para 41(h)\]. The revenues of MACEL during 2018-19 and 2019-20 (the years during which the fund diversion to MACEL had occurred) were merely Rs.1.71 Crore and Rs.3.27 crore respectively… It is quite intriguing that despite the extremely weak financial position of MACEL, the subsidiaries of CDEL decided to advance funds to the tune of Rs. 3,535 Crore to MACEL. This sum was more than the net worth of the Noticee, Rs. 3166 Crore as of March 31, 2019.

Siddhartha signed off on cheques apparently to buy coffee beans. But the company he paid more than a thousand crores in advance to buy coffee beans from, had a revenue of less than a few crores.

How did he get away with it? That’s where Aravind Maiya, the ~~KP~~ BSR auditor comes in. Maiya, whose job it was to identify and catch shenanigans when auditing CCD’s books, apparently did not because Siddhartha hadn’t technically written those cheques from CCD’s chequebook. He had used the chequebook of its subsidiary!

Here’s a snippet [from](https://cdnbbsr.s3waas.gov.in/s3e2ad76f2326fbc6b56a45a56c59fafdb/uploads/2024/08/202408191036463933.pdf) the National Financial Reporting Authority (NFRA), \[1\] an organisation I didn’t know existed before this:

>CDEL borrowed Rs 2,960 crores from Standard Chartered Bank, through its step down subsidiary TRRDPL, which was a 100% subsidiary of Tanglin Developments Limited.  
  
\[…\] the EP has stated that they were the Auditors of CDEL and not for the subsidiaries, and they relied upon the audit work and the audit reports issued by other statutory auditors of CDEL group entities as permitted by SA 600 (Using the Work of another auditor). He further stated that he had relied on certain additional audit procedures performed on identified account balances of CDGL and TDL which were considered important from the standpoint of consolidation.

One of CCD’s subsidiaries borrowed \~₹3,000 crore and lent a portion of it to Mysore Coffee (the company Siddhartha’s dad owned). Maiya told SEBI that since the money had gone out from CCD’s subsidiary, not CCD itself, and since those subsidiaries had their own auditors who found nothing wrong, it was okay for him to have the go ahead to CCD’s financials no matter how unusual they might seem.

In another case, CCD was lending money to one of its subsidiaries in a.. peculiar manner. Here’s a bank statement from NFRA’s [order](https://cdnbbsr.s3waas.gov.in/s3e2ad76f2326fbc6b56a45a56c59fafdb/uploads/2024/08/202408191036463933.pdf):

https://preview.redd.it/bsa3scuu8d3e1.jpg?width=1290&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3696b7be827313f1df2dc1d849105364fa60056e

Whoo, that’s quite some back and forth of money! CCD wanted to move money to its then-subsidiary Tanglin Developments. \[2\] So it lent it money. Tanglin repaid that money the same year, which in the world of finance is a great sign. But then CCD would just re-lend the money back to Tanglin in a couple of days. Eventually of course, that money would find its way to Mysore Coffee. Until the next time Tanglin’s loan from its parent company had to be “repaid”.

I’m not an auditor, probably for good reason, but if I saw a bank statement with a +₹50 crore almost immediately followed by -₹50 crore repeated a few times and even across bank accounts, I would be alarmed. From NFRA again:

>\[…\] the EP \[Maiya\] stated that he did not review the transactions between CDEL and TDL in the manner NFRA has considered, as the money was advanced and returned during the year and these transactions were eliminated during consolidation, TDL being a wholly owned subsidiary.

NFRA feels that Maiya’s responsibility was to ask CCD, “Hey why are you sending money back and forth to your subsidiary?” Maybe there was a perfectly reasonable answer to this question (rewards on Google Pay?). But not finding the transactions suspicious was suspicious.

# FIT AND PROPER

If you were a board member at a real estate investment trust (REIT), one of the things that you may want to do is to keep your REIT away from any shady people. Sure, you want to be doing that regardless, but especially if you’re around a REIT. Real estate in India is shady! The calling card for REITs mentions that people shouldn’t invest in them without getting their hands burnt.

Here are Aravind Maiya’s qualifications:

1. Found guilty of professional misconduct by NFRA.
2. Debarred from being an auditor.
3. Penalty of ₹50 lakh ($60, 000).

Would you hire him as your REIT’s CEO? Maybe you have no idea about all of this and let’s say you do. If the regulator comes to you and specifically asks you to reconsider his eligibility—what do you do?

This is what Embassy REIT did. From SEBI’s [recent order](https://www.sebi.gov.in/enforcement/orders/nov-2024/interim-order-in-the-matter-of-embassy-office-parks-management-services-private-limited_88223.html):

>REIT Regulations do not specify any criteria or requirements of the CEO of a manager to a REIT and do not provide any 'fit and proper person' criteria for the CEO of the manager of the REIT.

SEBI wanted the REIT’s CEO to be a “fit and proper person” which is just a bunch of [floor criteria](https://www.sebi.gov.in/legal/regulations/aug-2022/securities-and-exchange-board-of-india-intermediaries-regulations-2008-last-amended-on-august-1-2022-_61700.html) for stuff like not having defrauded anyone or being a criminal. Embassy REIT’s argument was that its CEO doesn’t need to be a “fit and proper person”?!

I know no one reads SEBI orders so Embassy REIT didn’t really care about what showed up in SEBI’s order. But come on, arguing that your CEO doesn’t need to be fit and proper is courageous. If it was up to me, I’d publish this line on the front page of whatever business newspaper I could. (The best I can do at the moment is the title of this blog post.)

Eventually, of course, Embassy REIT had to ask Aravind Maiya to step down because SEBI didn’t give it an option. What do you think Embassy asked Maiya to do? *My* presumption was that it would ask him to go on sabbatical, or I don’t know, maybe pick up gardening as a hobby.

Here’s a snippet from its [official statement](https://www.bseindia.com/xml-data/corpfiling/AttachHis/380f6cc3-3794-4937-9393-5b009eb08174.pdf):

>While we are reviewing the order and evaluating all options, in compliance with SEBI’s directive, effective immediately, Aravind Maiya will be stepping down as CEO of Embassy REIT. He will assume the role of Head of Strategy for Embassy REIT.

HE WILL ASSUME THE ROLE OF WHAT? When the regulator asks you to chuck your CEO out, you chuck your CEO out! You don’t give him a proxy CEO position as head of “strategy”. \[3\]

I have a hunch that someone at SEBI is now writing another order about how the head of strategy at a REIT should also be fit and proper. This time around they might cover more job titles.

**Footnotes**

\[1\] SEBI and NFRA worked together on this entire thing. First, SEBI investigated CCD and found that things were off. Then NFRA investigated Maiya, who was CCD’s auditor, because things were so *bizarrely* off. Then SEBI issued the most recent order asking Embassy REIT to ask Aravind Maiya to step down as the CEO because NFRA found him guilty.

\[2\] CCD eventually [sold](https://www.thenewsminute.com/money/coffee-day-sells-global-village-techpark-bengaluru-rs-2700-crore-109101) Tanglin Developments to Blackstone.

\[3\] The [performance](https://www.google.com/search?q=embassy+reit+share&rlz=1C5CHFA_enIN1065IN1065&oq=embassy+reit+share&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUqBggAEEUYOzIGCAAQRRg7MgYIARBFGDwyBggCEEUYPDIGCAMQRRg80gEIMjcyNmowajeoAgCwAgA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) of the REIT in terms of its market price has also not been anything to write home about. Which makes Embassy REIT’s hesitance to let go of its CEO seem even more interesting.

     My boss for a little over a year has been harrasing and basocally bullying me.    Always picking apart everything i did.    One employee would be doing something and they would be obivous to it.  Standing and talking and joking with them. Id come do the samr thing and theyd have a issue with it.   
   
    After me working there for over and year, they started getting angry daily. Making rude comments. 
    Suddenly she had a  problem with evrything i did.  -Too much icecream in the bowl   
-i was using too much whip cream. 
- Pouring coffee from the wrong pot.    
 Everyday it was somehting else.    
Although i always did it the same way and the same amounts and there was never an issue for over a year.

 It started getting worse and worse.  Alot of the other staff were noticing how rude and condesending she was to me.     It was starting to be a regular conversation betweem the staff even when i wasnt in the room and it was REALLY deteriorating my mental health. 

   Id come home and cry after my shifts worked with them.  I had anxiety about going to work on the days i had to work with them.    

  One of the last days i was pulled into the office for having a conversation over a voice msg with the other owner who also gets bullied and treated poorly.  The msg got back to my boss. And she brought me to the office.  
     -She was Yelling at me with her finger in my face saying if i didnt agree with the way she did things i should leave.     Said I was bullying. (The only bully there was her) and gave me a verbal warning. I didnt agree with it and wouldnt sign it.  
          After being yelled at for 30 mins i finally signed it just so i could leave the office.  
     
 I took the next day off work for mental health. The other boss said take as long as you need.      I was off for my reg 2 days after that and then my boss offered to give me 2 days until the weekend for my mental health. 

I was going to see a doctor about stress leave the next day so I made a group chat and added a few ppl from work that have witnessed the mistreatment **But nothing was ever written in the group**     bI then msged a few girls from work just in seperate personal chat stating that my mental health couldnt take it anymore.   *that i wasnt eating or sleeping    crying all the time*   and said i made the chat bc i might *need proof* of the poor treatment for stress leave. 

  The next day i got an email stating that bc the drama i caused in the group i created *(not one word was written in the group) * ,I was fired!    

They didnt pay me termination pay.    I worked 5 days a week. For almost 3 years    i was making almost 1000 in tips a week and then my pay on top of it.   She totally screwed me   and then shes trying not to pay me termination pay on top of it.     
    im done taking her shit    what are my options.  What can i sue for?    ",1,1732679236.0,legaladvicecanada,2,1.0,False

I'm not really lacking confidence but there isn't alot of opportunities to meet women. I'm in a rock and a hard place. Basically my personality and looks caught up to me too late in life. I'm 27 and girls talk to me but alot of the have bfs. No one knows that I struggle because of how I carry myself. I feel alone and invalidated. Girls in my program thinks I can pull any girl if I tried. It gets annoying. I try to block out feelings of loneliness. For example, if I talk to a girl at a bar, the next question is why I didn't grab her number. I guess every girl I talk to has to be a potential gf now.

What I need help with:

 Dating profile because I get no matches. I need someone to help me make a better bio and take better pictures. 

Places to meet women. Literally all of the coffee shops are empty. The churches are full of marri3d women (I'm religious). That leaves grad school. I refuse to date any girl in my program except one. They are not my type. And the one that is my type she doesn't know if she wants me or someone else. 

I'm too busy in school to manage this on my own. Not mentioned, the fine tunings of dating like getting the number, flirting, and planing dates. I'm not at an age where I can spend time on it. I need someone to teach me the steps so I can smoothly transition.

1h0v85l,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1h0v85l/im_a_nurse_at_a_rehab_center_its_hell_on_earth/,I'm a Nurse at a Rehab Center: It's Hell on Earth (Part 1) ,"I’ve loved helping people my whole life. I’m sure after a few minutes of meeting me, you could have my personality nailed down almost instantly. When the time came to pick my career path, I was lucky enough to know exactly what I wanted to do. That was to work at Sombra Rehab Center. Anyone who lives in New England should know about Sombra and its owner, Constantine Sinclair. They’re known as one of the most successful rehabs in the entire nation. With the opioid crisis in full swing, I felt like my calling was to be to help people who wanted to get clean,



After four tough years of nursing school and a few rejections, I was hired to work at Sombra Rehab Center on my third application attempt. I was overjoyed that I was finally about to complete my dream of working at Sombra. My parents were just as happy for me and they even drove me there for my first day. Standing in front of the entrance I turned to wave goodbye to them and finally entered the lobby. 



“Hello! Are we checking in today?” The lady at the front desk asked me as I walked up with my suitcase and my carry bag. All the nurses who work at Sombra live on site so I had packed all my essentials with me. 



“Oh no, I’m Cassandra Valois. The new nurse?” I told her, setting my bag down on the floor to get some relief from how heavy it was. The receptionist looked at her computer momentarily, pursing her lips in thought as she looked around for my name. I took the moment to look around Sombra's lobby. I was taken aback by how beautiful it looked. Everything was ornate and so shiny. The waiting room chairs were made from expensive wood and the cushions were embroidered with pretty designs. 



“Ah! Yes, of course there you are.” The receptionist finally said. She stood up quickly and started gathering a few papers around her. “If you’ll follow me, I’ll take you to your quarters.” I nodded at her, quickly picked up my heavy bag, and followed her as she led me to the metal doors separating the lobby from the rehab center proper. The hallways resembled the ones that I’d remembered from previous hospitals I’d been to. But there was just something, soulless about them. It looked too…corporate. Like a hospital mixed with an office building. 



Just as quickly as we entered the hallways, the receptionist led me towards the employees-only section. She grabbed the nametag around her neck and held it up to a scanner on the side of the door. 



“You’ll be getting one of these as soon as you’re settled down, and Nurse Taylor has been to see you.” She explained to me, I nodded quickly and followed her into the employees-only section. As opposed to the bleak hallways, our section was noticeably nicer and resembled the lobby more than the hallways had. It made me smile, thanking God I didn’t have to stay in such a depressing setting. She at last led me to my room, which even had my name engraved into a plaque on the door itself. 



“Thank you so much!” I told her as she smiled and nodded. She soon handed me the papers that she had been lugging around the whole time with her. She explained that it was just a few agreements and NDAs I had to sign to work here. I nodded and thanked her again as I entered my room. 



It was like a five-star hotel room all to myself. With a queen-sized bed and even a mini fridge. I couldn’t help but let out an excited little squeal to myself. I immediately started unpacking and placing everything where it needed to be. Once all my clothes and knick-knacks were placed where they were supposed to be, I took the stack of papers the receptionist had given me, and sat down on my bed to start reading them. 



Before I had even got one page done, I heard a knock at my door. I looked up to see a blonde woman in nurse’s scrubs, with a blue butterfly necklace and matching butterfly earrings. She had a big loving smile on her face, with a pair of extra scrubs in her arms. 



“Ms. Valois? Can I call you Cassie?” she asked me, I quickly nodded and allowed her into my room. I recognized Headnurse Taylor Trent from my interview with her. She seemed like a bright ray of sunshine and I had been so excited to work along with her. I tossed the papers to the side and smiled as she handed me my new scrubs. They even had my name stitched into them, along with my new ID badge. 



“Thank you so much!” I told her with endless excitement bubbling up from inside me. She nodded and giggled a little. She looked around my room for a moment and then back down at me. “Oh, I hope I was allowed to decorate a little,” I said, worried that she was about to say something about it, but she quickly shook her head. 



“Not to worry! I’m just getting an idea of who our new hire is! I know we had an interview, but this way I get to know you a little better. Makes it easier to manage you and all that,” she said with a smile. I nodded quickly and looked back down at my scrubs, so excited to have them. “You don’t start work until tomorrow, so after you’ve read over those papers and signed them, I’d suggest you walk around and get familiar with this place. It can be a maze sometimes if you aren’t careful.” She giggled, before waving goodbye to me and leaving me with my stack of papers to read. 



I tried my best to read through all of them, but they were filled with so much legal crap that it started to make my head hurt. And against my better judgment, I decided just to sign them all without a second thought. I set them aside to hand to Nurse Taylor when I started work tomorrow. As much as I wanted to wear my scrubs, it probably wasn’t a good idea to wear them right out of the gate, since I didn’t technically start working there until the next day. So I unclipped the ID badge from the scrubs and attached them to my regular clothes. I stepped out of my room and looked around the employees-only area. There was a breakroom in there with several nurses talking over the coffee machine. They spared a glance over at me, probably wondering what I was doing, but after seeing the badge pinned to my chest, they waved hello to me and continued with their gossip. 



I looked around some more until I came to an off-limits area with a large wooden door with a gold nameplate nailed into it. In bright letters was the name Constantine Sinclair. I stared at the door for a moment and felt a strong shiver go up my spine. Like some force was questioning what the hell I was doing there. I quickly went on my way to get away from the impending sense of doom. 



Once I had familiarized myself with the nurse’s areas, I exited the employees-only section and walked out into the rehab proper. Along with the mountain of paperwork I had received, there was also a helpful map stuffed together with all of them. Nurse Taylor hadn’t been kidding when she had said this place was a maze. I probably would've gotten lost immediately if I hadn’t brought the map. 



Most of the hallways were filled with patient’s rooms. And most of them were closed at this time. Judging by the time and the schedule I’d taken a look at, it must have been free time, but I expected to see more patients out and about. Following my map, I ended up in the recreational room, where I did manage to find some patients. 



Though they were much less lively than I would’ve liked to see. Most of them were standing around, completely out of it. They were almost like zombies, and the few who weren’t were close to being like that. The ones sitting down and doing puzzles and board games moved with such lethargy, that I thought they were insomniacs who hadn’t slept in months. They unsettled me badly, and just as quickly as I entered the rec room I quickly exited. 



“Watch out!” Someone shouted at me as I exited the rec room. I quickly jumped out of the way as I saw a patient running full speed down the hallway past me. Following him was an army of orderlies and nurses. 



“Todd! Get back here this minute!” Nurse Taylor’s voice echoed throughout the hallway as she and her army of nurses and orderlies ran after the patient. As she passed me, she suddenly stopped and quickly examined me. 



“Oh, Cassie. I see you took my suggestion.” She panted, pushing a lock of her blond hair back behind her ear. “As you can see, we have…quite the unruly patient.” She sighed deeply, trying to catch her breath as the other members of staff chased after the escaping patient. 



“Shouldn’t we put out an alert that a patient’s on the loose?” I asked, standing awkwardly next to her as she caught her breath. Judging by her expression, she didn’t think of this as that big of a deal. 



“Oh, no of course not. Todd is pretty harmless, he’s just…quite difficult to deal with at times.” She sighed in annoyance. She cleared her throat again and plastered a smile on her face. “But not to worry! I’m sure he’ll be caught in no time! In the meantime, please keep walking around and keep becoming familiar with the layout of Sombra.” She patted me on the back and soon left at a brisk jog to catch up with the group chasing after Todd. 



I meanwhile, kept trying to familiarize myself with the layout of Sombra. I’m not ashamed to admit that I got lost almost immediately when I tried walking through Sombra without the map I had brought with me. One area I did find in my frantic attempts to memorize the layout was the garden. It was in the middle of the giant Sombra complex and was a beautiful grassy area with trees and even a small veggie garden. 



I walked through the garden and sat on one of the benches to study the map again. After a few seconds of sitting there, I caught a whiff of cigarette smoke. Now I’ll be the first to admit that many nurses have a nicotine addiction, when you are as stressed out as we constantly are, most of us turn to unhealthy ways of dealing with it. So at first, I thought that it was just a nurse sneaking a smoke break but when I looked behind me toward the source of the smoke, I noticed that it was coming from a bush behind me. 



I poked my head through the bush and came face to face with a patient smoking a cigarette. And to my surprise, it was Todd. I had barely seen him as he ran past me, but it had been enough to recognize him, casually smoking a cigarette right in front of me. 



“Sup?” he asked as he looked at me without a care in the world. “You’re the new nurse I ran past, right?” He puffed out a noxious fume of smoke at me, which sent me into a coughing fit. “If you’re gonna tackle me and beat the crap out of me, can I at least finish my cigarette first?” 



“Why would I do any of that to you?” I was offended that he would even think I could do that to him. He squinted his eyes at me as he took a drag from his cigarette and then laughed at me. 



“Man, you’re definitely new.” He held his cigarette in his mouth and approached me, offering his hand for me to shake. “Todd, good to meet you…Nurse Cassandra.” He paused to read my nametag. I took his hand and shook it. “Not often I get to meet one of the nice nurses.” 



“You can call me Cassie. Aren’t they usually nice?” I asked him, which got a huge laugh from Todd, catching me off guard. He looked exhausted—not from running, but physically tired. He was gaunt, with heavy bags under his eyes and a buzzed haircut. There was a gash in his eyebrow which seemed fresh judging by the stitches still visible on the scar. 



“Man, you’re a riot. Do me a favor, Cassie. Don’t let that shithead, Taylor get to you. She’s a cunt with a capital C.” He dropped his cigarette on the floor and crushed it with his feet. He wasn’t wearing any shoes, only the grip sock patients usually wear. Before I could question him any further he turned and walked back towards the entrance to the rehab and left me alone out in the garden. 



Once I finally returned inside and kept trying to familiarize myself with the layout, I finally turned in for the day. I swiped my nametag at the employee-only door and walked toward my bedroom, my head still spinning from trying to remember where everything was. I finally entered my room and collapsed into my bed with a loud and tired groan. Tomorrow was going to be my first real day, and I wanted to get as much sleep as I could. 



As I was about to, I figured I should at least change into my jammies. Sitting up in bed, I noticed that a sticky note had been left on my dresser mirror. I expected it to be a note from Nurse Taylor but to my surprise, it was a small drawing. More specifically a drawing of me. Despite how small it was, it had plenty of detail in it. It was beautiful in fact. I looked around for any clue as to who had left it. I decided to ask around in the morning and stuck it back on my mirror. I changed into my jammies and finally collapsed into bed and passed out. 



I woke up with a jolt when the alarm I had set began to rattle and ring loudly. I quickly sat up and began to change into my scrubs. I quickly tied my hair into a ponytail and made sure my nametag was secured on my chest. As I looked myself over in the mirror, I was surprised to see yet another sticky note with a drawing on it. Taking it off the mirror I examined it. A tired looking man stared back at me, with a dark black splotch behind him with two white piercing eyes staring back at me. It looked almost like…Mr. Sinclair. There were what looked like little letters accompanying the note, but it was completely illegible. I placed it back on my mirror and decided to check back on it when I wasn’t in a rush. 



Making sure I had everything, I grabbed my signed papers, a clipboard, and my map and exited my room. All the other nurses were also waiting outside their rooms like we were in the military waiting to be examined or something. Nurse Taylor came down the hallway followed after by a nervous looking nurse. She walked and examined all the nurses, making sure we all looked spotless and even reprimanding a few of the girls who took a bit too long to exit their rooms. 



“Ah, Nurse Cassie!” she said when she turned to look at me. I stood up as straight as I could and quickly presented her with the papers and NDAs I had signed. She smiled and took them, quickly handing them off to the nurse who was following her. “Seeing as you’re new here, you’re going to shadow me today. We’ll start off with a quick visit to our therapy room.” When she said this, several of the nurses let out gasps and began to whisper amongst themselves. Nurse Taylor stared at the other nurses and they all quickly shut up. 



“It’s far too early for this much noise.” A tired posh voice broke the enforced silence. All heads quickly turned down the hall towards the voice’s source. To my shock and surprise, there was the owner of Sombra Rehab Center himself, Constantine Sinclair. The exhaustion in his eyes made Todd look well-rested. It was then that I confirmed that the second drawing was indeed of Mr. Sinclair. 



“We’re so sorry, sir. Just breaking in a new nurse.” Nurse Taylor quickly told the blond-haired man as he walked down the hall toward us, completely ignoring all the nurses around him. He walked with an umbrella at his side like a cane and had a cup of hot piping coffee in his other hand. He came to a stop and examined me like I was a piece of meat on a hook. 



“Hmph,” He grunted as he took a long sip of coffee. “Carry on girls. Nurse Taylor, I take it that you’ll be showing this girl around for the day?” He inquired, acting like I didn’t exist and wasn’t standing a few feet away from him. 



“That’s correct, sir! I thought it best to show her the therapy room.” She stood there looking up at him like a little puppy that was waiting for praise. If she was looking for any she didn’t get it. Sinclair simply grunted again. He stared at me with his exhausted eyes and I felt like he wanted to crush me like a piece of rotten fruit. 



“Carry on, then. I need a smoke,” He mumbled as he continued down the hall. I watched him leave and couldn’t help but wonder if maybe he was just having a bad day. Having watched him in commercials promoting Sombra Rehab Center, he always seemed so cheery and happy. With the surprise visit from Mr. Sinclair over with, all of us nurses dispersed and began to get our charts to begin the day. 



I meanwhile followed along with Nurse Taylor and her assistant nurse Emily. The two of them led me toward an area that I hadn’t seen on the map. It wasn’t even marked as an area at all on the map and the only clue that it was a therapy room was the small little sign next to the two doors that led to it. I had thought that maybe it had been a storage room when I had originally passed by it. 



“So, Cassie. I assume that you read through all of the papers I gave you?” Nurse Taylor asked me as she came to a stop and swiped her nametag against the scanner on the door. She then looked over at me and let out a small giggle. “Judging by that look, I assume you didn’t.”



“A lot of it went completely over my head,” I admitted as I followed the two nurses into the therapy room. As soon as the doors closed and locked behind me I got a chill up my spine. Something didn’t feel right, in fact, something felt horrible. They led me toward a table in the middle of the room and I let out a gasp when I saw who was lying on the table. 



“Oh, nice. You’re making the nooby to this to me?” Todd asked with a dry chuckle. He was strapped down the the table and despite his current circumstances, he didn’t seem bothered at all. 



“Quiet, Todd.” Taylor hissed as she walked over and slapped Todd across the face. I let out another gasp and quickly covered my mouth. “Now, Todd here is one of our more difficult patients. And as such, he’s in constant need of therapy.” She walked around the table and toward a machine that was set up on the wall near the table. 



“Y-you can’t do that…” I told her feebly. Still completely caught off guard by the slap. Emily came over to me and began pulling me toward the table. When I tried to pull away from her, she gripped my wrist tightly and yanked me right up to Todd. 



“You see, Cassie. Here at Sombra, we do things a little differently,” Taylor said with a smile as she flipped a few switches on the machine. It whirred to life and began to emit a low hum. “We follow the treatments that Mr. Sincliar tells us to give to the patients. Heavy sedation, strict diet, and of course, electroshock therapy.” She held up two handles that had been connected to the machine. 



“Y-you can’t do this! T-this is against our nursing oath! W-we promised to do no harm!” I screamed at her. Taylor just continued to smile at me as she set the handles back down by the machine and pulled out the papers I had signed for her, 



“And yet you agreed to our terms.” She flashed the papers at me. She flipped through them and a sinister smile crept across her face. “The contractee agrees that in the event of her inability to complete her assigned roles, her life and the life of her family are forfeit.” She giggled as she closed to stack of papers. 



“W-what…?” I asked in disbelief. Suddenly Nurse Emily placed the two wooden handles back into my hands. How had I missed that? What kind of place was this? Wasn’t this Sombra Rehab Center? The greatest rehab center in the country? Now they were threatening me and my family if I didn’t do as they said. 



“You don’t listen to them, they kill you and your family,” Todd explained, letting out a tired sigh. Nurse Taylor walked over and quickly shoved a mouthguard in his mouth and motioned me to come over to her. I didn’t want to move, but my family was in danger. I took a few shaky steps over to her and joined her side by Todd’s head. 



“Now, if you’d please administer the treatment, Nurse Cassandra?” she asked me. I stared down at Todd and he nodded at me with a small wink. I felt tears stream down my cheeks as I lowered the handles and placed them against his temples. I closed my eyes as I pressed down on the buttons of the handles. Todd tensed up and let out a scream from behind his mouthguard. 



I backed up quickly and tossed the handles to the floor, shaking my head and screaming. This wasn’t what I wanted at all. I wanted to help people, and here I was giving an innocent man an unnecessary electroshock therapy. Nurse Taylor came over and grabbed me by the face and held up a scalpel to my face. 



“You pick those handles back up and administer another shock, or I gut you like a pig. Your choice.” She ordered me, placing the cold metal instrument on my cheek and starting to apply pressure. I let out a whimper and carefully nodded. She let go of my face and stepped back. I walked back over to the handles and picked them up. 



I walked over to Todd, who had recovered from the first shock. “I-I’m so sorry…” I whimpered again as I placed the handles back on his temples and pushed down on the buttons, giving him another shock. Tears streamed down my face as I stepped back from him, but I held onto the handles. Nurse Taylor nodded as she watched Todd squirm. 



“That’s enough for today. Nurse Cassandra, please take Todd back to his room, please. And then meet us in the lobby.” Nurse Taylor said as she and Emily walked towards the exit to the therapy room, leaving me alone with Todd. 



I apologized profusely to him as I unstrapped him from the table and helped him sit up. He was groggy and mildly incoherent, so I carefully led him to a nearby wheelchair and carefully placed him down on it. I sighed and started pushing him out of the therapy room and out into the hall. Just as I did so, I was confronted by two orderlies who were wrestling a patient down to the floor. 



“Let go of me!” She screamed. Before I could even raise a voice to object to what they were doing to her, there was a sickening crunch as they slammed her down to the floor and pressed their boots down onto her shoulder blade. She screamed so loudly I thought her vocal cords were going to rip. The orderlies wordlessly stuck her with a needle and lifted her body up onto one of their shoulders and began to walk away with her, leaving me staring in shock and in tears. 



“Heh, welcome to Sombra Rehab.” Todd chuckled weakly from his wheelchair. The sounds of the female patient woke him up from his stupor. “My room’s at the far end of the hall over there.” He pointed down the hall to our left, and I wordlessly pushed the wheelchair down the hall. 



What I wouldn’t give to go back and stop my past self from signing those papers. Or at least getting to that point in the papers. I wish I could have never started working here, because from here a long horrible trail of events would begin. That would ultimately ruin my life. Stay tuned and I might tell you all about it.

I really love pour over. I've been using a Timemore C2 grinder and V60 to brew. I like a balanced cup, and I enjoy the novelty of trying new coffees, usually medium or lighter. I feel like the C2 doesn't quite get me the...clarity (?) I'm looking for. I think it produces more fines than I want to have. And it's a supremely limited espresso grinder (slow and imprecise).

I also have a Breville Barista Express Impress (operates at 9 bar, slightly more grind steps than the non-impress version), but I struggle with lighter roasts. [r/espresso](/r/espresso/) says that's the built-in grinder. Since I bought it last year, I've just accepted that I should stick to medium roasts. Also, I think I don't love espresso like I love pour over, but drink at least 2 per week.

So, should I:

1. get a great pourover-focussed grinder and keep accepting the limitations of the built-in espresso grinder
2. get something that can do both, knowing I'll probably be using mainly or pour over (possible only pour over if changing grind sizes is a PITA!)
3. get something that complements what I already own to expand my brew options (e.g. flat burr)

I don't have a strong preference for manual vs electric provided the manual grinds fairly quickly. I don't have physical space for more than 1 additional grinder. Not sure I have a strict budget, but I expect diminishing returns beyond the price of a DF64 Gen 2. Finally, prices in Canada are also very different from US, so I'll list some of the main grinders I've considered with CAD prices.

DF64 Gen 2 ($550 CAD)  
DF54 ($300 CAD)  
Kingrinder K6 ($180 CAD)

I wanted to share my recent experience hunting for patio furniture that won't break the bank. After spending countless hours researching and comparing prices, I've finally found some amazing deals I thought you'd want to know about.

Last month, I was determined to transform my boring backyard into a cozy outdoor living space. Like many of you, I was shocked by the astronomical prices at local furniture stores. Some sets were going for thousands of dollars – definitely not what I had in mind!

Through my search, I discovered that online shopping is actually the way to go for outdoor furniture. The best deals I've found are on this Amazon collection: https://athometouch.com/patiofurniture. They have everything from comfortable conversation sets to dining tables, and the prices are surprisingly reasonable.

Here's what I've learned about finding affordable outdoor furniture:

1. Shop during off-season sales (October-February)
2. Look for weather-resistant materials like resin wicker and powder-coated steel
3. Consider buying piece by piece instead of complete sets
4. Check customer reviews for durability feedback
5. Compare prices across different sellers

What I love about shopping on Amazon is that you can easily compare prices, read genuine reviews, and get free shipping with Prime. Plus, their return policy is super straightforward if something isn't quite right.

I recently purchased a 4-piece conversation set that included a loveseat, two chairs, and a coffee table. The quality is impressive for the price, and it's holding up great against the elements. The cushions are water-resistant, and the frame is sturdy enough to withstand regular use.

For those interested in checking out the collection I mentioned, here's the link again: https://athometouch.com/patiofurniture. They're constantly updating their inventory with new styles and deals.

Some money-saving tips I've picked up:

- Sign up for price drop alerts
- Look for sets that include cushions (buying them separately can be expensive)
- Check warehouse deals and open-box items
- Consider modular pieces that can be rearranged
- Watch for lightning deals and daily specials

My outdoor space has become my favorite spot to relax and entertain, and I didn't have to spend a fortune to make it happen. The key is being patient and doing your research. Trust me, the perfect affordable set is out there – you just need to know where to look!

Hope this helps someone else who's on the hunt for budget-friendly patio furniture. Let me know if you have any questions about my experience or specific pieces you're considering!",1,1732677359.0,LivingEssentials,0,1.0,False

1h0ulf5,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1h0ulf5/the_screaming_shipping_containers_of_yard_2a/,"The screaming shipping containers of Yard 2A, truth or legend?","Smoke rose into the crisp winter air, mixing seamlessly into the night sky. The fire that crackled beneath it, was a pitiful thing at best. The rusted barrel that housed the flickering warmth, was surrounded by vagrants. 

Drug addict, runaway, vermin, drifter, homeless, call us whatever you like. None of the terms ever hurt my feelings, since the people throwing around such words, are just afraid of ending up like us. Personally, I would say I fall into the runaway category but that’s a story for another time. 

The tips of my finger poked out through my torn gloves. As I held them over the fire I watched as they changed from blue to pink. Sensation finally returning to my hands. Every minute or so I would flip them like pancakes on a flat top grill. 

The barrel I stood around was one of many. There were about five groups of people huddling together for warmth. A few paces from where I was, two of the older men at the camp chatted candidly. They were swapping war stories over beaten up cups of instant coffee. Stifling a few laughs, I kept my head down and continued to eaves drop. A couple of the kids from the group wandered over to the old men, and begged them for a story. 


The night before last, five newcomers arrived at our camp. Those of us who had been staying here for a while, put up signs all across town. Incase there were others, others who liked safety in numbers. If the newcomers had found the signs, and made their way here? Well, shit. So long as they don’t stir up trouble, they’re more than welcome to stay. 

You’ll find it quite funny to know, that the homeless can be more territorial than a property owner. Must be the last little shreds of hope, and pride. The NEED for something to call their own. Not us though, not here. For our little community, it’s lonely out by the docks. The more, the merrier. 

-I should probably introduce myself at this point dear reader. I apologize. But as hard as I try, I cannot remember. If it comes to me later, I promise to let you know. -

“So y’all got any local legends around here?” A thick southern drawl cut through the chatter. 

I looked around to see where the voice originated from. Eventually my eyes fell upon a man sitting on top of an old cement drainage pipe. He was just past where the fire light could reach, his face shrouded in shadow. The cowboy had that rested on his head was a dead give away. No one within a hundred miles dressed, or sounded like that. 

“Local legends? Hell yeah we’ve got quite a few.” Old man Bill chuckled. “Hmmm… let’s see. We’ve got the Long Dog, poor old Witch Sarah, Dr. Drummond who started haunting the Asylum after being brutally murdered by his patients. Am I missing anything Ryan?” 

Old man Bill turned to look at me. 

-Oh yes, Ryan. That was my name.-

My brows furrowed, a sinister look forming on my face. “Yes Bill, you forgot the newest legend to hit the Riverside Bay. How could you forget? We are reminded of it every night. I started hearing rumors of it around my 15th birthday.” I sighed. 

“Have you ever been to the container yard, just after midnight?” One of the kids asked the Cowboy, who shook his head no. 

“The containers scream, just after the stroke of midnight. To top that off, there have been countless disappearances from that area.” I pointed my eyes at the Cowboy. 

He slid down off the drainage pipe and walked closer to the group. I noticed he held something in his hands as he approached. The fire light glinted off the flat of the blade. A well worn pocket knife was being used to scrape the dirt from under his nails. 

“You mean that container yard? The one right over there?” Cowboy asked whilst jerking his thumb behind him. 

“That’s the one.” I stated with a stern tone. 

“Screaming shipping containers? You’re shitting me. Sure it’s not a group of illegals sneaking across the boarder?” Cowboy asked sincerely. 

I rolled my eyes and scoffed. “What? You a racist, Cowboy? There were tons of other things you could have come up with, but you picked that? Damn.” 

“I ain’t no damn racist. It was either that or human trafficking. I chose the less morbid answer.” 

I burst out laughing, clutching at my sides. After a moment Cowboy realized I was razzing him, and relaxed. As if in cue, the wind began to howl. I watched as the groups mood suddenly darkened. I grinned largely under the cover of darkness. 

“Wanna go check it out for yourself if you don’t believe me?” I raised an eyebrow at Cowboy. 

“Even if he doesn’t go, he’ll still be able to hear it from here.” Lou grunted as he brushed past me. He was the man Old Bill hung around with most. “It’ll be midnight soon enough. Better tuck in kids.” 

As Lou and Bill wrangled the group into their tents, Cowboy and I wandered to the edge of camp. The heels of his cowboy boots clicked softly against the frozen ground. If we took a few more paces, we would eventually leave the forest and be met with a barbed wire fence. Behind it, were stacks and stack of shipping containers that seemed to go on infinitely. 

The wind-

-it always starts with the wind. It always starts with the wind. It always starts with the wind. It always starts with the wind. It always starts with the wind it always starts with the wind it always starts with the wind it always starts with the wind 
It 
Always 
Starts 
With 
The 
Wind
It-

Began to pick up as Cowboy and I approached the humming fence. The sound that emanated from the yard was something too harsh to describe. I can only provide meager comparisons. You’ll have to let your imagination do the rest. 

The screaming starts off like the wind whipping through bare branches. A low, painful howl that sends shivers down your spine. It’s never just the moaning though. It always ALWAYS escalates into feverish shrieks. Like pigs squealing in a slaughterhouse, or the high pitched scraping of metal on metal. The screams sound guttural, and wet. Like trying to wail for help whilst being held under water. 

But, as quickly as it starts, it fades even quicker. Into soft cries that are carried away on the invisible breeze. 

“The FUCK was that?” Cowboy asked, his breath coming in pants. His eyes were practically bulging out of his head. 

“That’s them, the screaming shipping containers of Yard 2A.” 

As Cowboy turned his back to me, a slow smile crept its way across my face. ",3,1732677005.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

I need to make some out of what I've cobbled together. I really need to have it work out with the tools and staples on hand.

What I've got:

Aldi's (Chobani) (sell by Dec 11) still sealed I had to go 3 towns over to get. I won't be able to get more for a long while.

Gallon of food lion milk unopened (sell by date Dec 1)

A sous vide wand (Anova)

An old instapot I'm having trouble identifying.

Some very basic, generic coffee filters.

A silicon lid ice cube tray

A giant stovetop stainless pressure cooker.



Things I worry I'm missing/can't get that feel like they might doom me.

My Ball jars. I literally have none of my usual supplies here.

A thermometer. Again, see above.


First I need help strateging how to stretch this Aldi's/Chobani as starter for as many future batches as possible. I've seen suggested freezing doses (tablespoons/ounces?) in my tray and peeling off them one by one as I get more milk.

Also, should I boil some water or sterilize the ice tray in some way? Also, it's a shared fridge and it's not kept the cleanest so should I do more to prevent contamination.

Sorry if this comes across as hand holdy but I've been petitioning for supplies for this for months (and was told homemade yogurt wasn't possible 🙄) but then got the yogurt and excess milk handed to me out of the blue.

I feel like I'm sorta being setup to fail but if I can get some help figuring a workable process with my current limitations, I might be able to have a regular source of yogurt like I'm used to (at home I've got my jars, sous vide, cambro, thermapen, the works so thats what I know)

Thanks so much for any help or just some encouraging words. All the discouragement and implications of wanting/sure I'll fail is shaking my usual confidence.

Thanks for being awesome.

I've been on a mission lately to find the perfect coffee machine for my home, and I thought I'd share my experience and findings with you all. After months of research and trying different machines, I think I've cracked the code on what makes a great coffee maker.

First off, let me tell you why I started this journey. I was spending way too much money at coffee shops, and my old machine just wasn't cutting it anymore. I needed something that could make cafe-quality coffee without breaking the bank.

Through my research, I found that the best coffee machine really depends on your personal needs. But there are some key features you should look for:

1. Brewing Temperature: The ideal machine maintains a temperature between 195-205°F for perfect extraction
2. Programmable Settings: Because who doesn't want their coffee ready when they wake up?
3. Easy Cleaning: Trust me, this is crucial for long-term maintenance
4. Water Filtration: Better water = better coffee

I've found some amazing options on Amazon that tick all these boxes. You can check them out here: https://athometouch.com/coffeemachine

Something I learned during this process is that automatic drip machines are great for everyday use, while espresso machines are perfect if you love specialty drinks. For those who want both, there are some excellent hybrid models available.

Here's what I recommend considering before making your purchase:

- Your daily coffee consumption
- Counter space
- Budget
- Preferred drink types
- Time you're willing to spend on preparation

One thing that really surprised me was how much the grinder matters. If you're serious about your coffee, look for a machine with a built-in grinder or budget for a separate one.

I've put together a detailed comparison of top models here: https://athometouch.com/coffeemachine 
These machines range from basic brewers to advanced systems, so there's something for everyone.

Pro tip: Whatever machine you choose, always use fresh beans and clean water. Even the best coffee machine can't make up for poor quality ingredients.

Remember, a good coffee machine is an investment in your daily happiness. I used to spend $5 daily at coffee shops - now I make better coffee at home for a fraction of the cost.

I’m a tea person, but I’ve grown tired of the hassle and expense of making traditional Indian tea. I’m exploring coffee as a way to enjoy it without the need for extensive learning or experimentation. However, I’m not interested in buying a coffee machine that relies solely on K-Cups. If I’m going to try coffee, I want to give it a fair chance.

I stumbled upon Ninja Luxe at Best Buy and bought it on the spot to test it out. It’s a great machine that’s easy to use. I don’t have to worry about “dialing in” or “frothing” as much as with pre-packaged coffee, which is a huge plus.

However, I’m also considering Breville Pro because I got one for $500 from Marshalls. It’s essentially at the same cost  as Ninja Luxe, so it’s a fair comparison.

Here are my requirements:

- I want to experiment with different coffee beans occasionally, but I don’t want to be a coffee chemist every day.
- I prefer a consistent coffee in the morning and evening, but I’m not too picky about the beans. I can switch them once a month or every two months.
- The machine should be easy to use and maintain.

Based on these requirements, I’m inclined towards Ninja Luxe, but I’m open to suggestions. However, Breville has a rich history and an extensive online support system, which makes me reconsider. Please share your thoughts and help me make an informed decision. 
I’d appreciate it if you wouldn’t suggest any other options, as I’m already feeling overwhelmed and won’t be able to make a decision that I’m happy with.",1,1732676216.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

## Understanding the Photos Permission Issue in MacOS SwiftUI Apps

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/67czalvlzc3e1.jpg?width=1154&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=907f8a6d6ac2e75e00a465953a26c40b3649dabf

Developing a MacOS app that integrates with the Photos library can be a rewarding yet challenging experience. If you've been building a SwiftUI app and encountered issues with the **Photos permissions** flow, you're not alone. It’s a common hurdle for developers, especially when setting up the required configurations for system privacy settings. 😅

In MacOS, requesting access to sensitive resources like the Photos library requires a few crucial steps. The typical flow involves updating the \`Info.plist\`, configuring sandbox settings, and using the proper APIs like \`PHPhotoLibrary\`. However, even if all the right elements seem to be in place, things don't always work as expected—such as when the app doesn’t appear in the System Preferences under the Privacy tab. 😕

As you’re working with SwiftUI, you may already have your user interface set up to request permissions and display status updates, but if the app doesn't show up in the Photos section of the Privacy and Security settings, it can leave you scratching your head. Let’s break down the root of this issue and explore potential fixes to ensure your app gets the necessary access smoothly.

In the following sections, we’ll walk through how to ensure that your app is properly configured to request Photos permissions on MacOS. We'll cover the necessary code adjustments, insights into the permissions flow, and even share some best practices to help your app behave as expected. So, grab a coffee ☕, and let’s dive in!

### Understanding the Photos Permissions Flow in a MacOS SwiftUI App

&#x200B;

In the SwiftUI code provided, we are trying to implement a feature where the app requests access to the Photos library using Apple's **PHPhotoLibrary** API. This involves a series of steps, starting from checking the current authorization status to requesting permissions, and finally attempting to fetch assets from the Photos library. The first crucial step in the script is calling the **PHPhotoLibrary.authorizationStatus(for:)** function. This function checks the current authorization status of the app for accessing the Photos library. The result of this call can be one of four values: .notDetermined, .authorized, .denied, or .restricted. The app then uses this information to determine what actions to take—whether to show a permission request button or display a message explaining that access is denied. For example, if the user has already denied permission, the app displays a message prompting them to go to System Preferences to enable access manually.

The next key command is **PHPhotoLibrary.requestAuthorization(for:)**, which is used to request access to the Photos library. When this command is called, the system prompts the user with a permission request dialog. This is an asynchronous operation, and once the user responds, the app needs to handle the response appropriately. In the script, we use the DispatchQueue.main.async closure to ensure that any UI updates occur on the main thread after the user has made their choice. For instance, if the user grants permission, the app proceeds to fetch and display photos. Without this proper handling, the app could attempt to update the UI from a background thread, causing potential crashes or incorrect behavior. An example in real life: think of an app like a photo editing tool that needs to request access to the user's photo library. If the app doesn't correctly manage the flow, the user could get confused when they don't see the expected result after granting permission.

Another important part of the code is the usage of **PHFetchOptions** and **PHAsset.fetchAssets(with:options:)**. These commands are used to interact with the Photos library and retrieve assets (such as images or videos). The PHFetchOptions class is employed to specify any filters or limits on the fetch operation. For example, the code snippet limits the fetch to one asset with the **fetchLimit** property, which can be helpful in situations where the app only needs a small number of items to display or process. Once the fetch operation is complete, the app logs the number of assets retrieved, which is useful for debugging and ensuring that the app is accessing the library correctly. Imagine a scenario where you only want to display the most recent image in a photo viewer app. Limiting the number of fetched assets allows for more efficient memory usage and faster processing.

The SwiftUI-specific components in the code, such as the u/State and **.onAppear** modifiers, play a crucial role in managing state and triggering actions within the app's user interface. The u/State property wrapper is used to track the authorization status and log messages, allowing the UI to update dynamically in response to changes. The **.onAppear** modifier ensures that the app checks the Photos authorization status as soon as the view appears, so the user sees the correct information when they first open the app. For example, if the app detects that the user hasn't yet granted permission, it shows a ""Request Access"" button. This approach improves the user experience by ensuring that the app is always in sync with the system's state. A real-world example would be an app that requires permission to access sensitive data, like a bank app asking for biometric authentication when the user opens the app for the first time.

### Improving Photos Permission Flow in MacOS SwiftUI Apps

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fu3y3ibozc3e1.jpg?width=1125&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8c9bd2e41a7976f50327d2e9248999dab2b2d021

&#x200B;

When working with MacOS SwiftUI apps, managing user privacy and permission requests is crucial, especially when accessing sensitive information like the Photos library. In the provided example, the app attempts to request access to the Photos library, but the application does not show up in the System Preferences under Privacy settings, which prevents the user from granting permission. One key aspect that can influence this behavior is whether the app is correctly configured in the Sandbox environment. For apps requesting access to system resources like the Photos library, the proper entitlement in the App Sandbox is necessary. You must ensure that the ""Photos"" checkbox is enabled in the app’s sandbox settings in Xcode. This setting allows your app to request permission to access the user’s Photos library. If this is not set, the app will fail silently, and the user will not see the option to grant access in the System Preferences panel.

Another aspect to consider is the use of the **NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription** key in the *Info.plist* file. This key is required by Apple to explain why your app needs access to the Photos library. The description you provide is displayed in the permission dialog that appears when the app requests access. Without this key, your app will not be able to request access to the Photos library, and the system will not present the permission dialog. This is an essential step in complying with Apple’s privacy requirements. Make sure to clearly describe why the app needs access, for example: ""This app requires access to your Photos library to help you select and edit images."" Without this, the app might be rejected during the app review process or fail to function as expected.

Lastly, another important part is testing the permission flow in different scenarios. Sometimes, permission requests fail due to a previously denied request or other system-level settings. You can test how your app behaves in these different states by manually adjusting the Photos permission settings in System Preferences. For instance, if the user has already denied access to Photos, the app should display an appropriate message telling the user how to manually enable access through the system settings. Additionally, consider testing the app with different privacy settings, such as with a clean user account or after resetting the app’s privacy permissions. This ensures that the app’s flow is consistent across different devices and configurations.

#### Frequently Asked Questions about Photos Permissions in MacOS SwiftUI

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zrl3kkwozc3e1.jpg?width=1155&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f7524deb41ec99cad62d66ccf77fd3bd35f5d86c

&#x200B;

How do I configure my MacOS app to access the Photos library?

The app needs the ""Photos"" entitlement in the App Sandbox settings and the **NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription** key in the *Info.plist* file for explaining why access is needed.

Why doesn’t my app show up in the Photos section of System Preferences?

If your app doesn’t appear, check that the proper permissions are set in the **Info.plist** and that the ""Photos"" option is enabled in your app's sandbox settings in Xcode.

What should I do if my app still doesn’t ask for Photos permission?

Ensure the app has the necessary entitlements and that the app’s code is properly requesting access using **PHPhotoLibrary.requestAuthorization(for:)**. Also, make sure your app is being run on a MacOS version that supports these APIs.

How can I debug permission issues in my MacOS app?

Check the system logs for any errors related to privacy permissions. Also, manually adjust permission settings in the System Preferences and verify the app behavior with different configurations to see how it responds to each state.

What does the **PHPhotoLibrary.authorizationStatus(for:)** method do?

This method checks the current status of the Photos library authorization, returning values like **.authorized**, **.denied**, or **.notDetermined** based on the user’s choices.

Why is the **NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription** key necessary?

This key explains to the user why the app needs access to the Photos library. Without it, the app will fail to request permission and be rejected by Apple’s review process.

What happens if I don’t handle authorization statuses properly in my app?

If authorization statuses are not handled properly, the app might crash, fail to update the UI correctly, or show misleading messages to the user, leading to a poor user experience.

Can I request access to the Photos library multiple times?

No, once the user has granted or denied access, the app will not trigger the request again. You should display appropriate messages based on the current authorization status.

How can I limit the number of assets I fetch from the Photos library?

You can use **PHFetchOptions.fetchLimit** to limit the number of assets returned by the **PHAsset.fetchAssets(with:options:)** method, making your app more efficient.

What should I do if my app crashes when trying to fetch assets?

Make sure that you handle errors gracefully by checking the authorization status first and ensuring your app has the correct entitlements and permissions.

How do I guide users to enable Photos permissions manually?

Display a message in the app explaining how the user can enable access via System Preferences, which is necessary if the user has denied access.

#### Fixing Photos Permission Flow in MacOS SwiftUI Apps

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zgrpiohpzc3e1.jpg?width=1155&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=177a3c69e293a0c3d9ee69632412f47d1d78b499

&#x200B;

For your MacOS SwiftUI app to properly request access to the Photos library, you need to ensure several critical configurations are in place. First, in your **Info.plist**, include the **NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription** key with a clear message explaining why access is needed. This ensures users understand the app’s purpose for requesting permission. Without this key, the app won’t be able to show the permission request dialog. Additionally, ensure the app has the necessary entitlements in the **App Sandbox** settings in Xcode, specifically enabling the ""Photos"" option to request permission for reading and writing to the Photos library.

Another important aspect is checking the current authorization status using **PHPhotoLibrary.authorizationStatus(for:)**. This method returns a status such as **.authorized**, **.denied**, or **.notDetermined**, which helps you determine the flow of your app. When the status is .notDetermined, your app should present a button to request permission. If the status is .denied or **.restricted**, the app should guide the user to enable access in the System Preferences. For a smooth experience, it’s vital to handle all states properly and communicate clearly with the user.

Lastly, testing your app with different permission configurations is essential to ensure it works as expected across devices. You can test different scenarios, such as when the user has already denied access or when the Photos library is inaccessible. By triggering these states and observing how your app responds, you ensure that the app will always provide clear feedback, such as informing the user to visit System Preferences to enable Photos access. This testing process is vital for providing a seamless user experience across various privacy settings and device configurations. 🖼️

#### Conclusion:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/flnsbv2qzc3e1.jpg?width=1155&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=839ac3ba84846fa79d89c44faa2158e316ca151f

&#x200B;

By following the steps above and ensuring your app is correctly configured, it will be able to request and receive Photos library access, as well as show up in the System Preferences privacy settings. Ensuring the proper entitlements, configuration, and clear communication with the user will help resolve permission issues effectively.

Remember to also test the app in various configurations, as different privacy settings or previous permissions can affect how the app behaves. This thorough testing will give users a smooth experience when using your app’s Photos integration. 📸

I traveled with my husband, and we decided to take advantage of Icelandair's free stopover while planning a vacation to Europe.  The costs outlined are everything we spent from landing in Iceland to taking off.

All costs are in USD, and I used a credit card with no foreign transaction fees for everything, so costs displayed are as translated by the exchange rate at the time.  Excluding flights, we spent $1,085 for 3 days for two people, breakout spreadsheet is at the end!

Here's what we did:

Day 1:

Landed at KEF around 6:45 AM on a Sunday, picked up our rental car, stopped at Kokulist bakery, then went straight to Sky Lagoon for our 9 AM reservation.  We got there around 9:10 AM.  We rented through Zero car and highly recommend- the ""basic"" car we had was equipped with a heated steering wheel and seats, adaptive cruise control, and hands free steering.  Excellent!  And it was easy to pick up from a key box and get on our way.  We stopped at Kolkulist bakery for breakfast and got pastries along with a sourdough loaf which they sliced for us and we used throughout the week.  Drove to Sky Lagoon for our 9 AM reservation.

After spending about 2 hours at Sky Lagoon, we went to Reykjavik and walked around.  Got a ""traditional"" hot dog, went to the flea market, but we were both exhausted and didn't have a lot of energy.  So we headed to our Airbnb which let us check in early.

We chose an airbnb in Hveragerdi simply because my #1 desire was to hike Reyjkadalur, it was a tiny house on the property of someone's house but it was very secluded and private.  It had a hot tub which was awesome.

We went to Bonus to stock up on groceries after checking in, then went in the hot tub and fell asleep.

Day 2:

Drove the south coast, stopping at Seljandfoss & Glujfrabi, Selfoss, Reyjnsfara beach.  Ate at Black Crust pizza, then went to Katla handmade for Souvenirs, which was EXCELLENT.  Definitely a must-stop.  We headed back to Hveragerdi then went to the local pool and relaxed before eating from our groceries at our Airbnb.

Day 3:

Hiked Reyjkadalur- HIGHLIGHT OF THE TRIP!!!! We parked around 6:45 AM and were the second car in the parking lot right around first light.  We hiked the trail and were the only people in the river for about 45 minutes.  We spent about an hour in the river before packing up for the hike back.  On the way down we saw lots of people heading up...many people turned around after realizing how steep the hike was and we watched a lot of people turning around from the coffee shop after we were done.  Highly recommend going early as the trails can be narrow so getting stuck behind some slower people could be a bummer.

Went back to our airbnb to change, then we did a mini golden circle drive, going to Kerid crater, Geysir, Gullfoss, Bruarfoss.  Bought souvenirs at Gullfoss.  Stopped in Selfoss on the way back for gas and found another handknit shop where we bought a pair of mittens for my MIL.  Also stopped at Kronan for a ton of candy which we gave to friends and family along with some snacks.

We left early the next day and bought more chocolate at duty free.

I recently started working at another veterinary practice and one of the technicians dealt with a heart wrenching death of their long time feline friend. All of us had a close relationship with this cat and when the time came, my coworker decided it was time for a new furry friend. My boss proposed an idea that the next kitten she adopts can be our “hospital cat in training”

In the beginning, it was much easier to care for him in our hospital as he was quite young, in a cage and really not a lot of movement going on considering she got him from a litter that was found without the mother. (The rest of the litter was adopted) Fast forward to now and we have a 5 month old kitten still learning the ropes, but without any boundaries. 

This kitten essentially can be anywhere in our immediate private office and unfortunately that has caused many problems as he is still a kitten. And I repeatedly tell myself “he’s just a kitten, he’s just a kitten.” There will be some days where he will lick the lids of coffees and morning drinks. Other times it is food that is stolen directly out of the hands of our colleagues due to being so ravenous. He also is a frequent food stealer and drink tumbler if those items are left at our own personal desks unattended. 

Now I’d like to mention that this is a SHARED office and each of us (4 other individuals including myself share this office with our personal belongings and our desktop computers. At first I guess I thought it would be like old times. A seasoned wise furry friend just keeping us company like the previous cat. Now we have to worry about him jumping on the lunchroom table while we are trying to enjoy a lunch. 

I certainly don’t think it’s appropriate to allow a cat to jump on a kitchen table while people are eating or worrying about food being stolen if you leave it at your own desks. I also don’t think it’s okay to let your kitten wander so much to the point that he has cost the company a few hundred bucks because her kitten is not being monitored, allowed to roam in supply closets only to chew open brand new bags of prescription food for clients. 

I genuinely would love to say something, but I’ve already received some passive aggressive “he’s just a kitten” or “it’s not my fault he wants some food”. So this is a weird territory because: 

1. My boss doesn’t seem to want to redact the “hospital cat in training” beta launch, but this technician did just lose a cat recently 

2. She doesn’t seem interested in setting boundaries and finding a better way to have our space feel respected so we can all coexist in peace.

So AITA if I bring this up to my boss to see if she can set some hospital boundaries? Or should I just let this one ride out and let this kitten take up my entire personal office space and work in the parking lot 🥲

Lots of people collect things.  My Aunt Vivian used to joke that she collected people.  She’d always done it since I could remember—rolling along next to me as we went on one of our outings, she would always have a Polaroid camera dangling from a strap around her neck like a 90s kid’s idea of an old-fashioned reporter.  Not that I thought about it back then—she’d always had it, and she didn’t use it all the time, just when she ran across certain people.  I asked her once what made her decide who to take pictures of, and at first she just gave me her beautiful, mysterious smile.  She was twenty years older than me, but she looked much younger when she smiled like that.

Laughing, she held up the camera like she was going to take my picture.  “I just look for those people that are extra shiny to me.”  She lowered it again without snapping as her smile faded a little.

“Why don’t you take a picture of me then?  Aren’t I shiny?”  I had injected a bit of fake hurt into my voice—at least I thought it was fake.

Gripping the wheels of her chair, she turned and started heading across the food court where we’d just eaten lunch.  “You’re plenty shiny, sure.  But I already have you, don’t I?”

Running to catch up with her, I put my hands gently on the chair’s handles without really adding any push.  “Sure,  Viv.  Sure.”

She glanced back at me with a grin.  “That’s what I thought.”

**** 

She had hundreds of photos, all organized in albums by some organizational scheme that I didn’t understand.  Maybe it was alphabetical—after all, she never took someone’s photo without asking permission and getting their name.  The few times when I was really young that I’d suggested someone or something for her to take a picture of, she’d almost always politely refused.  No pictures of squirrels or dogs or trees, and no pictures of people unless they met Vivian’s “shiny” criteria and they agreed to be taken.

Stacks and stacks of albums of strangers, some shy or awkward or even annoyed, though many were smiling, happy to oblige the pretty woman in the wheelchair that thought they were worthy of her time and film.  When I was in high school they filled a bookshelf, and by the time I graduated college she’d devoted a walk-in closet to four larger shelves, all low enough that she could reach every book easily.

That ease of use was a necessity, though I didn’t figure that out until I was a bit older.  I lived a few hours away by that point, and while I still saw Aunt Viv at most big holidays and birthdays, I couldn’t deny that she felt more remote now.  Growing up we’d spent whole weeks together, just the two of us, and I missed that closeness, that friendship.  Maybe that’s why I went to see her on the spur of the moment, thinking it would be nice to get away from my graduate work and a good surprise to visit her without a particular reason.

I had to ring her doorbell several times before I got an answer, and when I did, I let out a small, involuntary gasp before putting my bag down and crouching next to Vivian.  

“What…are you sick?”

She gave me a wan smile that seemed to painfully stretch her dry, cracked lips.  Those lips were too pale, but everything about her seemed pale and fragile in that moment.  Everything but her eyes, that still danced with the same bright life and intelligence behind heavy, bruised-looking eyelids.

“A little, maybe.  Overtired, mainly.  Been working on a project I do every few months and it’s just…well, it’s taken more out of me this time than usual.”

Standing up, I grabbed my bag and walked in at her waving invitation.  “Do you need to go to a doctor or something?”

She laughed, but it was strained and thin.  “No, nothing like that.  I’ll be right as rain soon enough.”

I’d never known Viv to lie to me, but I didn’t believe her then.  Something was really wrong, and she was too stubborn or private to tell me about it.  That was her right, of course, but that fact didn’t help me worry less.  Giving her a smile I didn’t feel, I nodded.

“Okay, if you say so.  But at least let me help with whatever you’re doing, okay?  Just tell me what to do and I can do it while you rest.”

It felt like she considered my offer for a very long time.  It was probably less than ten seconds, but things seemed to stretch out forever as I waited awkwardly for her to reject my help.

“Okay.  I can trust you with it.  Follow me.”  Her expression didn’t change during this—just closed and neutral as she wheeled off toward the back of the house with me close behind.  I wasn’t surprised when she led me to her picture closet, but then I saw the interior of the room.

There were twice as many shelves now, and while some were empty, the filled space had clearly been growing at an increasing rate.  On the far end of the middle shelves I noticed a small stack of albums that were on a short table there.  What was she doing with them?

As if reading my thoughts, she answered right away.  “Pruning.  I only keep photos of people while they’re alive.  It’s a custom I have.  When I first started, I’d have to rely on newspapers and various paid services to find out when someone in my books passed.  But since the internet got big, it’s much easier.”  Vivian chuckled.  “Still time consuming, of course.  It takes way more time as I collect more people, and the longer I do it, the more likely that people will die.”  She shrugged.  “Still, it must be done.”

I stared at her.  Why?  Why did it need to be done?  It sounded boring and tedious, and what difference did it make?  I wanted to ask her, but I held my tongue.  For all her energy and interests, I knew that Vivian often had a hard and lonely life.  So what if she wanted to have odd hobbies and attach weird rituals to them?  Who did it hurt, and if it helped her, wasn’t it worth it?

“So what can I do?  Take out pictures of dead people?”

She grinned at me.  “No, I can do that part.  You can do the research.”

**** 

I spent the next two days “pruning” with Viv—I think we removed over three hundred people from over 4,000 in the books, though at some point I lost count.  When I left the next day, I wouldn’t say that Vivian looked like her old self, but she did seem more rested and relaxed.  She also made me promise to visit more often, and when I said I would, I meant it.

Over the next two years I did visit more, and other than a joking comment here or there, I never really brought up how quickly her collection was growing.  You might think she’d start running out of people in the area she lived, but she almost never took pictures there.  Instead, she traveled all over—West Coast, East Coast, big cities and little towns no one has ever heard of.  Looking up their obituaries and death certificates, I could have quickly accrued my own collection covering every state in the country.  I asked her once why she never travelled abroad for any pictures, and she just smirked at me.

“Harder to get death information ouf-of-the-country.”

I’d paused at that, weighing whether it was a joke or serious.  When her smirk broke into a grin, I returned it, going back to looking up if Ruby Holsek was still in the land of the living.  There was the name, and checking it against the picture…yeah it looked like she died six months earlier in a car accident.

**** 

During these years I didn’t really see my other family that often.  Christmas maybe, or when someone was very sick.  My time was taken up by school primarily, and when I had free time for family, I usually spent it with Viv.  Seeing her more often made it harder for me to notice her decline—harder, but not impossible.  I wanted to ask her what was going on and if she was going to be okay, because for all the time I’d spent with her,  I’d never fully understood what put her in that chair or kept her there.

In the end I couldn’t bring myself to ask her directly, worried that she’d get mad or depressed, or suddenly think I saw her as less of a person than a problem or the disease that put her in that position.  So instead I went home and asked my mother.

For her part, she looked startled.  She even paled a bit.  “Why are you asking about this?”

I shrugged.  “I’ve just been hanging out with Aunt Viv some.  And I worry about her.  She’s getting worse.  Weaker.”

Lighting a cigarette, my mother nodded.  “You always were close with her.  Closer than I ever was.  She was younger than me and your Uncle Andy.   Not by a lot, but enough.  Enough that she was the baby and we didn’t really want her around.”  She fluttered her hand dismissively.  “Not that we didn’t love her—we did.  But to a couple of older kids she was just a pain, and when she got older she started getting sick.  Everyone though she was going to die.”

My eyes widened.  “Is that when she went into the wheelchair?”

She shook her head.  “Not yet.  That didn’t happen until she was a teenager.  This thing she has…I don’t remember what they call it.  But it burns you out fast.  It starts with headaches and falling down more.  Then one day maybe your feet are numb or your legs don’t work good any more.  Before long you’re in a chair, then a bed, then you’re gone.”  She glanced up at me with a guarded look.  “At least that’s what they told us.

“It’s strange, hearing that your sister has a short shelf-life, like she’s a jug of milk or something.  Me and Andy figured she’d be gone within a year of two, and we felt guilty for not hurting more at the idea of losing her.  Again, it wasn’t that we didn’t love her.  It was more like we couldn’t really see the real her past all the responsibility and expense and hassle.  All the attention she got and how everything revolved around her.  And so, knowing that she was going to die soon, we really did feel sad about it.  Terribly sad.  But there was some relief there too.”

“Jesus.”  I just stared at her, not sure what to say.

My mother shrugged as she took another drag on the cigarette.  “I know how it sounds.  I do.  But we were kids.  And besides, she wound up living after all.”

Trying to keep my voice even, I asked a question that had been fluttering around in my head the past few minutes.  “How?  How did she live if she was supposed to die so quick?  Was she misdiagnosed?”

My mother shook her head.  “No one ever said it was a wrong diagnosis.  It was just chalked up to ‘a miracle’.  You’re too young to remember this, but your grandmother used to call her ‘miracle baby’ sometimes even after she was grown.  And she did it all the time when we were young.  It was annoying, but I got it.  It really did seem like something magical had happened—she went from looking worse on a weekly basis to being stronger and healthier again.  For awhile you couldn’t even tell anything was wrong with her.  Then she started slipping and falling again.  Not long after she had to go into a chair.

“Again we thought she was going to die soon, but no.  After a few weeks she was looking better.  Stronger and healthier.  She never got her legs back, but you couldn’t even tell it bothered her most of the time.  She’d just roll around, snapping pictures with those cameras of hers, happy and popular and full of life.”  She paused and shot me a look.  “She still doing that thing with taking pictures?”

I nodded silently.

My mother snorted.  “Figures.  She was always a weird girl.  I love her, but weird as hell.”

**** 

After that, I noticed the ebbs and flows in Vivian more—she would slowly decline, and then she’d spring back, though I realized now that her high point was always slightly lower than the time before.  And the catalyst for the improvement it was always the same—pruning out the dead people from her collection.

I think I’d noticed that from the start, but I always told myself that it was a coincidence or my imagination, or that the ritual itself or the company I provided were just giving her a temporary boost.   But as I watched her dip lower and lower only to come back again every time…well, eventually I knew something more was going on.  

That being said, I didn’t understand it, and I didn’t really want to question it if it helped her.  It wasn’t my curiosity or the growing sense of unease that I was a part of something strange and unnatural.  It wasn’t even the tickle in the back of my head warning that this wasn’t just magical, it was somehow wrong.  No, what caused me to finally talk to Aunt Vivian about it was the truth I was confronting more and more every time she opened the door.

“You’re dying.”

Aunt Vivian stopped sipping her coffee as she studied me over the rim of the cup.  We’d finished this round of pruning that morning, but she still looked thin and worn out.  “Aren’t we all?”

I frowned at her.  “That’s not what I mean.  I’m not stupid.  I know these pictures are helping you somehow.  Helping you fight…whatever it is that’s trying to take you.”  She didn’t say anything, so I went on.  “But I also know that you’re losing.  Even with taking more pictures and pruning more often, it isn’t bringing you back like it was.”

Sitting her cup down, she gave me a slight nod.  “Alright.  So what’s your point?  Because if this is your attempt at a pep talk, you really suck at it.”

I couldn’t help but smile a little, even though I felt like I could barely breathe.  “It’s not.  I just…I don’t understand how this works.  And I don’t really care, so long as it helps you.  But is there anything else we can do?  To make it work better or to heal you or something?”

I saw something shining in her eyes, maybe a brief sheen of tears, and then she was smiling at me.  She looked so beautiful in that moment that I laughed.  It didn’t seem fair that she could be so wonderful and have to face so much pain and worry.  I just…

“When I was young, I almost died.  Your mother may have told you this, and I won’t bore you with all the details, but I got a very bad, very aggressive disease that kills most people pretty quick.  And I could feel it working on me, like vines tightening around another plant until its dead.  I was scared, of course, and I’d try to do anything to distract myself.  I couldn’t play much with how I was feeling, but I still made myself walk around some every day, as though with enough exercise I could keep my limbs from betraying me.  

“I’d gotten an instant camera for my birthday that year, and I got the idea of taking pictures as I went around the neighborhood.  I took a couple of pictures of animals, but something told me to take pictures of people instead.  So that’s exactly what I did.

“The next day I felt better.  So I went out walking again, this time further.  In part because I had more energy.  In part because I somehow knew I needed to collect different people.

“The day after that, I felt even better, and that afternoon, I asked your grandfather to get me more film on his way home from work.”

“This went on for another week, and by the end of it, I felt like I’d never been sick.  If anything I felt better than I ever had, though I tried to hide it a little.  I wasn’t trying to lie, not really.  It was more just instinct that I didn’t want to stand out more than was necessary.  After that I took less pictures, but I still took them—I’d go a few days and then I’d get the urge.  The one time I ignored it, I started feeling sick again, and I didn’t need that lesson twice.  I was like you—I didn’t know what was happening, but I didn’t care so long as I stayed healthy.

“And I did…for a long time I did.  But this thing…I think of it like a tiger sometimes.  It’s always there, tracking me, trailing me.  Waiting to jump on me and bring me down.  I was fourteen when my legs started going again.  I took more pictures, and I could feel it helping a little, but it wasn’t nearly enough.  The tiger had me now, and it was going to drag me down to some place I couldn’t come out of.

“And then one day…one day our grandpa came to visit.  He was a preacher in another state, and it was rare that we ever saw him, but I guess my mother had told him that I likely didn’t have a lot of time left.  He came and sat with me for a couple of hours.  Talking to me, praying, telling me that God loved me.  He was a nice enough man, but he smelled like cloves and I didn’t really know him.  I just wanted him to go so I could sleep.

“He was about to go when he noticed the camera on my bedside table.  Asked me if I liked taking pictures.  If I would take a picture of him.  I wanted to say no, but something inside stopped me.  Instead, I picked up the camera, framed him, and hit the button.

“Then I hit it again.

“I knew right away it was different.  My skin was tingling as I waved to him and pretended to drift asleep.  I waited until I heard everyone going outside to see him off to see if I was well again.

“I fell to the floor.

“I had healed myself, partially.  I wasn’t dying anymore, not for the moment.  But my legs were still numb.  I tried over the next several weeks to get them back too—I took more pictures, but I always held off from taking more than one.”

“Why?”  I couldn’t help but interrupt.  “Why wouldn’t you take double pictures or a dozen pictures if that helped more?  You might be able to walk.”

She nodded with a rueful smile.  “Yeah, probably so.  But the reason I didn’t was because after my grandfather left our house that day, he died.  Just…stopped.  It was only an hour down the road from where I’d taken his pictures, and his car hadn’t even really wrecked.  It just rolled into a ditch after he stopped living.  They tried to claim it was a heart attack at the time, but I got the death certificate later.  Indeterminate cause of death.  I guess the medical examiner didn’t know to look for curses.”

I frowned at her.  “You don’t know you cursed him.”

Shrugging, she took another sip of coffee.  “I know that he died because of me, and that I benefited from it.  I know I’m doing a lesser version of the same to everyone I take pictures of, draining a bit of their life so I can live.”

I felt my stomach clench painfully.  “How do you know that?”

She raised an eyebrow.  “You know.  Why do you think I removed and destroy the photos of people who have died?  They don’t help me once they’re dead.  In fact, the opposite.  I sometimes wonder if the reason it hit me again so hard when I was fourteen was because I hadn’t known to prune.  That idea didn’t occur to me until a month or two after my grandfather died.  It felt like I was fighting death, after all.  Or bargaining with it.  And anyone who was already dead was just more weight against me.  So I started weeding out the people that were dead—it was just a few back then.  Right away I felt stronger.”

Giving a short, bitter laugh, she went on.  “And it’s not that I didn’t think about taking more double pictures back then.  But I was a child, and I felt good except for my legs.  So I told myself it was good enough.  And for a time, it was.”

I swallowed.  “So you never tried taking two again?”

Vivian smiled at me.  “I did, once.  I was in my late twenties.  My health was okay, but I was very depressed and lonely.  I wanted a full life, and I convinced myself I was rejecting a gift that I’d been given.  So I started watching the newspapers.  Found a man who had been let out on bail after killing his wife and child.  It didn’t take long before I had my pictures and he was dead.”

“Did it work?”

She waggled her hand back and forth.  “Yes and no.  I definitely felt stronger and more alive, but I still couldn’t walk.  That’s what made me realize, it wasn’t just the second picture and the dying that made it more powerful.  It was the connection.  I had gotten more from him dying, but far less than when my blood relative had died and brought me back from the edge.  But even my grandfather…he was kin, but I barely knew him.”  Her smile widened.  “Imagine if it was someone that I was kin to and I loved?”

I felt my skin grow cold.  “I…you want to use me?”

Aunt Vivian’s smile faded away.  “What would you say if I did?”

Swallowing, I nodded.  “I mean…yeah.  I don’t want to die, but if it helps you that much, maybe it’d be okay.”

She looked almost angry as her lips drew into a thin line.  “Get up then.  Go to your room and lie down on the bed.”

Nodding again, I stood up shakily and did as she told me.  When I was on the bed, I looked up to see her in the doorway to the room, camera in her lap.  Lifting it, she snapped my photo once.

“You shouldn’t be so quick to give your life away.  Take it from someone that’s fought for it every day for a very long time.”  Her face softened.  “I do love you for it, though.   Enough to not take a second picture.”

“I…are you sure?”

She raised a hand.  “Yes.  But I do need you to do something for me.  Toss me your phone.  I’m going to lock you in here.  There’s a bag in the bottom of the closet with bottles of water and health bars, and you have a bathroom.  In four days someone will come and let you out, but I need you to stay in here until that happens, okay?”

Throwing her my phone, she caught it deftly as I stared at her.  “A bag?  Have you been planning on locking me in here?”

Viv laughed softly.  “I have several plans all the time, even if I don’t know exactly when or if I’ll need them.  This was one of them, though I’d have called it a longshot.  Still, I’m very happy it worked out this way.”  She raised an eyebrow.  “Will you trust me and do as I ask?”

I nodded.  “Um, you’re not going off to kill yourself or something, right?”

Chuckling, she shook her head.  “You haven’t been paying attention.  I love living too much for that.  But you’re right.  Things can’t keep going like they are and I’ve been patient long enough.  It’s time to harvest what’s been planted.”

With that, she shut the door and locked me in.

**** 

I thought about breaking out over the next few days, but I wanted to keep my promise, so I didn’t.  And true to her word, on the fourth day, a guy I’d never seen before opened the door and told me my phone was on the kitchen table before walking back out.

When I got my phone, I had several missed messages.  A couple from friends, one from a girl I had been talking to lately, and several from my mother.  It was the last few of those that really caught my attention.

Are you going to be around this weekend?

You aren’t answering your phone.  Vivian is throwing this party (well, it’s at our house, so maybe I’m throwing it) but she wants all the family there.  Your sister is coming, and so is Uncle Andy and his family.  Viv will be heartbroken if you aren’t there.

Viv is about to start family pictures.  Where are you?

I stared at my phone.  The last text was from the night before.

“Oh fuck.”

**** 

The official report, which came weeks later, said that everyone must have died from some kind of gas leak, though there was no sign of anything like that the next morning when police arrived to do a wellness check at Uncle Andy’s wife’s request.  Seems she got a stomach bug at the last second and hadn’t made the trip after all, though their two little girls had.  Not that Vivian would mind that much.  Aunt Alison wasn’t blood after all, and they’d never been very close.

As for Viv, there was no sign.  Her bank accounts were empty, her photo albums were gone, and there was no trace of her at the party where most of her family had died.

Well, that’s not entirely true.

Because amid the dead bodies and decaying party food that filled the living room and kitchen of my parents’ house, one thing stood out.

- Add an item that changes a pokémons Main Skill. (*Lucario is my fav pokémon but his main skill with Dream shards is probably my least fav skill as I'm never short on dream shards. Don't you just wanna use your fav pokémon without worrying about underperforming?*)

    
- Adjust XP you get after sleep sessions and from Dream Shards. Make it a tad bit faster. It's way too slow. *I get that it's a sleep tracker and progress tends to be slow but it shouldn't be this slow to get a pokémon from level 6 to level 7*    

- Add more pokémon and more coverage to the ingredients and berries. What I mean by this is... there's so many pokémon having Ginger in their first slot or tomatoes but then there's not much pokémon covering stuff like Leek, Corn or Rousing Coffee in Slot 1. (*For example there is not a single pokémon covering Leek in slot 1. I'm trying to get my Quaxly to level 30 just so I can unlock Leeks. Same for some berries. Yache berries can only be obtained from the Dragonite evolution line and Altaria. More variety and coverage would be nice*)

- Game is suffering from not having enough variety imo. Yeah, ik we just got Mimikyu with an awesome main skill Berry Burst. My strongest pokémon so far but looking at my previous point they should really start adding more pokémon frequently to fix the previous issue.

- Give us a reason to go for evolved pokémon. Make them a bit more special. Yes they're already higher level than baby or basic pokémon but it's not as rewarding. (*To fix this problem... Maybe they could give us level 2 or level 3 main skill automatically depending on it's a first or second evolution. That way they're the same as if you evolved them.*)

- Add an in-game message function or pin a message to let the people in your friend list know what candy you need the most atm.

- Trading. I know this is a Sleep Tracker but it's still a pokémon game. You want to collect as much different pokémon as possible. And if you're unlucky like me who can't get a specific pokémon to spawn no matter how hard you try it would be welcoming addition. (*Been playing the game for 4 months now and still no Riolu.

How to Style Your Space with Couch and Loveseat Reclining Combinations
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Styling your space with couch and loveseat reclining combinations can create an inviting and comfortable atmosphere in your living room. These pieces aren’t just about function; they also add a touch of style to your home. Whether you’re starting from scratch or refreshing your current setup, here are some effective tips to make the most out of your reclining furniture.

### Create a Focal Point

Your couch and loveseat should be the stars of your living room. Position them to face each other or orient them towards a fireplace or television. This arrangement promotes conversation and creates a cozy gathering place. Be mindful of the distance; around 8 to 10 feet is ideal for conversation, while still allowing for the reclining feature to function smoothly.

### Choose the Right Color and Fabric

The color and fabric of your couch and loveseat can significantly impact the room's overall vibe. Consider the existing color palette of your space. If your room has neutral walls, a bold-colored reclining set can serve as a stunning contrast. Here are some fabric types to consider:

- **Leather:** Offers a sophisticated look and is easy to clean.
- **Microfiber:** Soft, durable, and available in a wide range of colors.
- **Linen:** Breathable and comes in various textures, giving a relaxed feel.

### Accessorize Smartly

Accessorizing your couch and loveseat reclining combinations can enhance their look. Here are some accessories to consider:

Check Details Here: https://loveseatreclinerguide.com/couch-and-loveseat-reclining  
  
- **Cushions:** Add life and comfort with textured or patterned cushions.
- **Throws:** A cozy throw blanket can make the space feel warm and inviting.
- **Accent Tables:** A stylish side table can provide convenience while enhancing the overall aesthetic.

### Incorporate Surrounding Decor

Matching your recliners with surrounding decor helps create a cohesive look. Consider the following elements:

- **Wall Art:** Hang artwork that complements the furniture colors.
- **Rug:** A stylish area rug can tie the whole room together; ensure it’s large enough to fit under at least the front legs of your reclining furniture.
- **Lighting:** Use table lamps or floor lamps to create a warm ambiance while also providing practical light for reading or relaxing.

### Space Planning

Before setting up your couch and loveseat, take measurements of your space. You want to ensure that the reclining mechanisms have enough room to operate fully without hitting walls or other furniture. Visualize the layout by using painter's tape to outline where the furniture will go, ensuring it doesn’t overcrowd the area.

### Think Functionality

While style is important, functionality should also be considered. Couch and loveseat reclining combinations are great for maximizing comfort, but think about how they fit into your lifestyle. If you often host gatherings, choose a setup that invites mingling while still accommodating relaxation. You can even include additional seating options like poufs or ottomans for extra space without sacrificing style.

### Mix and Match Styles

Don’t hesitate to mix different styles for a unique look. If your couch is modern, a traditional loveseat can create an interesting contrast. Just make sure to stick with a common color theme or fabric type to avoid clashing. Mixing styles adds character and reflects your personality in the room.

Check Details Here: https://loveseatreclinerguide.com/couch-and-loveseat-reclining  
  
### Regular Maintenance

To keep your couch and loveseat reclining combination looking fresh, regular maintenance is key. Vacuum upholstery to remove dirt and lint, and promptly clean spills to prevent stains. Periodically check the reclining mechanisms for wear and tear to ensure they continue to function smoothly.

By following these strategies, you can create a beautifully styled space that showcases your couch and loveseat reclining combinations while maintaining comfort and functionality. Enjoy your cozy retreat, perfect for both relaxing and entertaining!

### Conclusion

Selecting a couch and loveseat reclining set for your living room is a decision packed with benefits. Not only do these pieces provide unparalleled comfort, making your space an ultimate relaxation zone, but they also enhance the aesthetics of your home. With various styles and designs available, you can easily find the perfect set that speaks to your personal taste while fitting seamlessly into your decor.

While yes there is pain and it hasn’t been fun,  my pain has not been severe enough to make me cry or regret doing this. 

I wanna start by saying your surgery day depends on how you react to anesthesia. I have gone under surgery before somewhat recently and know I get extremely nauseous. I asked them for pills and an anti nausea patch. Which they put on.

11/19 Surgery Day- 
After surgery I wasn’t really in any pain, as my throat was still numb. However, I did have a feeling of something being stuck in my throat, like thick mucus I wanted to “hawk up.” I asked her if I could because of how bothersome it was and she warily said yes. I have a couple bites of applesauce, drink lots of water, and have a feeling on increased thirst, partly because of this.

*This feeling continued and on day 7 I still have, but the severity of it wanes throughout my experience. 

Upon returning home my nausea slowly increases. I take pain pills, I made eggs to help with nausea and drink a protein boost shake thing, which I think was my mistake (milk based) Standing up was making me nauseas as well and I ended up throwing up 4 times. Luckily, it was mostly water and was not painful at all. However, afterwords my throat started to feel a bit sore. Throat and uvula getting more and more swollen. 

Day 1 -11/20
Woke up a bit sore, swelling even more and is the worst part. Most of the only pain I feel is when I swallow. Swelling so bad, I start to lose my voice and go hoarse. Talking starting to hurt. Ate Mac & cheese. I can breathe but some points It’s a bit difficult. (Not in a scary way.) 

Day 2 -11/21
Woke up with pain. This is the worst day so far. I end up loosing voice and can’t talk at all, because of swelling. Ears hurt, neck stiff and aches and headache. Mucus even thicker and have a constant feeling of it being stuck in throat. (I end up massaging neck and jaw and stretching and it helps a ton.)

Day 3 -11/22
Able to talk, feeling better than yesterday. Slight headache still and I contribute to not having caffeine. I make coffee, let it cool just a bit so it’s not so hot and easier to drink. Helps and eases throat. 

Day 4-5- 11/23-11/24
Not much of note. Nothing too bad. I ease up on pain pills, as I’m not hurting as much and haven’t used bathroom yet. Eat soup. The light warmth helps ease throat. Stop pills and stsrt Tylenol.

Day 6- 11/25
I woke up to pain. Best way to describe is the ripping off of a bandaid, but in my throat. I end up taking half a pain pill because it’s hurting and annoying. Scabs starting to come off. I end up spitting out a chunk of it. I end up having some Yawning fits, those are kinda painful, but apparently common after surgery. This is first time I’m feeling real hunger and want big meals/fast food. Burger and fries etc. 

Day 7- 11/26
Today I woke up with sensitivity in throat. Have you ever breathed in cold air and it kinda stings your nose and throat? That’s what it feels like. 
Take a quarter of pain pill to stave off the feeling (finally able to go to bathroom.)
Say screw it and cook ground turkey with some peppers because I’m so hungry. Hurts swallowing and probably won’t do again, but felt nice to eat.  

Helpful tips that have helped TREMENDOUSLY with pain, the mucus feeling, swelling and just overall experience. 

-Drinking water! It’s essential and I keep it next to nightstand and anytime I wake up, I drink. This and ice help TONS with the extra mucus you have. Keeping hydrated will help keep scabs moist, which helps avoid more pain.
-ICE constantly sucking on ice. This helps numb the throat, that it makes swallowing so much easier! At times I can drink water and it feels normal. 
-While Ice is wonderful and necessary, I’ve found having something warm on the throat, helps, especially in the morning when I’m the most sore. This makes it feel better, way that tugging sensation when scans coming off, and then I go straight to sucking on ice cubes.
-Massage. Massaging my neck and underneath the jaw where tonsils are, actually helped a lot with the ear pain and neck pain. (Those pains only lasted half a day at most.) 
-Pain medicine they give you makes a lot of this tolerable. If you need to eat, take pain meds before eating, eating hurts more than drinking when you swallow. It’s uncomfortable and hurts, but not enough to stop me from finishing food.

Yes it sucks and I’ve had some bouts that have been painful, but none of my experience has been so bad as to make me cry out in pain or regret this. I know there’s an end to this and I did this for a reason.

*I will say a lot of my pain is actually coming from my tongue and uvula. Felt like they used my uvula as a punching bag, it felt/feels bruised. The side of my tongue towards the back where tonsils are, is raw, bruised and feels like maybe It’s cut? These have bothered me more than my tonsils have.

Summer is a bit slow to wake up, acting more on automatic for the first bit of the day. She starts her day with some physical activity, like a quick jog, it is generally around halfway through that she feels fully awake.

Autumn will either slap the sleep button repeatedly or get up and sit herself somewhere to do some mindless thing while waiting to be fully awake. She drinks coffee on some days but it is mostly just cream and sugar.

Winter is the hardest and slowest to wake up. Often waking up a good hour after the others are out of bed.

1h0tqxt,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1h0tqxt/my_evergrowing_family_threw_me_a_party_after_i/,My ever-growing family threw me a party after I won the lottery. Then the knives came out,"“Family is everything. Always remember that, Jordan.” Those were the words spoken by my parents on my 10th birthday, and they’ve echoed in my mind ever since. Now, as an adult with a psychology degree, struggling to make ends meet, those words felt more like a cruel joke. 



One Monday afternoon, in a moment of desperation, I stopped at a gas station and spent $20 on a scratch off ticket. When I got home and scratched it, my heart nearly stopped. Two million dollars. The numbers stared back at me. Ecstatic, I called my parents to share the news. Their joy matched mine, and they immediately started making plans for a huge family celebration. In retrospect, making that call was the worst mistake I’ve ever made. I should’ve kept it to myself. What happened next left me scarred forever.



It took weeks before I finally deposited the lump-sum check into my account. But as soon as it cleared, the knives came out. 



They threw me a grand dinner party to celebrate, with my parents, and five rough looking cousins I’d never met showed up. Becoming an instant millionaire and spending the night celebrating with loved ones felt like the perfect ending to my story. The table was overflowing with all kinds of food and drinks, but it was the wine that caught my attention. On a good day, I could easily down two to four bottles.



Unfortunately, the joy didn’t last. Things began to take a turn for the worse.



Almost everyone bombarded me with questions—demanding my bank account details and prying into what I planned to do with the money. They were relentless in their curiosity about my future, but I refused to share anything and stepped outside to clear my head. The wine I’d been drinking left a sour taste in my mouth, and a wave of nausea hit me. Stumbling onto the porch, I collapsed and blacked out. 



When I woke up hours later, I groggily got to my feet and went back into the farmhouse. Something was off. The house was shrouded in darkness, and no one was around. It was as if everyone had vanished without a trace. That was when the nightmare truly began.



When lights flickered back on, everyone was seated around the dinner table, staring daggers at me. My mother, Grace, launched into a tirade about how the farmhouse was supposedly days away from foreclosure. But that was a lie, since we paid it off last year through a loan. My father, Mark, pressed me to hand over my bank account details, claiming he was behind on child-support payments to his ex-wives. I held my ground, firmly refusing. My five rough-looking cousins sat in silence; their eyes fixed on me with unsettling intensity. Disgusted, I expressed my deep disappointment to my family and turned to leave, heading for my car.



They jumped on me before I could reach it. Someone jammed a needle into my arm, injecting me with an unknown substance. I blacked out, and when I woke up, it was midnight. I was inside a small-town jail cell, surrounded by two dead cops, with blood coating my hands. I looked up and saw my family members snapping pictures of me from outside the cell. 



Lord almighty, I’d been framed for murder by my own family. I screamed at them to let me out, insisting their plan would fall apart because of the surveillance cameras in the station. But my cousins only laughed, casually pointing out that the jail was old, and the cameras hadn’t worked in years. I froze at the revelation.



They swung open the cell door and advised me to run, cause as of today, I was officially a cop killer whose luck had run out. They bolted out of the police station. 



I stepped out of the cell and examined the bodies of the dead cops. Their throats had been slashed so deeply that the cuts exposed bone. I bolted out of the station after hearing sirens, but I was jumped again, this time by the five rough-looking cousins I’d never met. They injected me with an unknown substance and I passed out.



I jolted awake inside the town’s small church, lying close to the altar. The altar was smeared with flesh and blood. Turning around, I gasped at the rows of dead parishioners sitting in their seats, butchered. My heart pounded so hard it felt unbearable; was this some twisted nightmare, or had I truly killed these people, like the two cops at the station? I didn’t have the answers yet, but I was prepared to fight tooth and nail to uncover the truth.



I stepped out of the church and came face-to-face with a crowd in hooded white robes, their flashlights pointed at me. I considered running into the woods, since the church was deep in a secluded, forested area, but I wasn’t sure I could outrun them. My head throbbed, dizziness blurred my vision, and I felt completely drained, both physically and mentally. That’s when it hit me—what kind of drug had my family injected me with?



I dashed into the woods, glancing back to see if anyone was following. Reaching a clearing, I paused to catch my breath, waiting for the hooded figures to appear, but no one did. I spotted a small shed nearby and slipped inside, taking the chance to relive myself. Just as I finished, a powerful force slammed into the shed, flipping me upside down. It didn’t sound like any animal; it was more like a truck crashing into it. I scrambled out just as the shed tipped over. Before I could steady myself, conjoined twins rushed up to me with a taser, and the next thing I knew, I was on the ground, paralyzed, falling into unconsciousness, again.



I woke up on a stretcher in a decaying medical clinic, a middle-aged nurse with rotten teeth standing beside me. When I asked how I’d ended up here, she stayed silent, her gaze more focused on my pockets than my wellbeing. I got off the stretcher, warning her to stay away from me. She just stared at me, then whispered something chilling—she knew about the lottery I’d cashed recently. And that’s when it hit me: my family, the hooded figures in the forest, conjoined twins in the clearing and now this nurse— they were all after my money.



“I won it! It’s mine!” I shouted, struggling to stay upright. She laughed, exposing her decaying teeth, and murmured a few words that sent a wave of dread through me.



“Family is everything, Jordan,” she whispered, stepping closer to me. But she wasn’t family. I was certain she was bluffing. I turned and bolted out of the clinic, stumbling and nearly collapsing as I crashed to the ground, only to find myself surrounded by smirking bare-chested rednecks aiming their rifles at me. My vision wasn't getting any better and I knew I couldn’t fight them. I let them drag me into the back of their truck. 



The truck drove to the old circus grounds, long shut down over rumors of gambling and human trafficking. 



When I came to my senses, I was on a large wooden stage, staring at my seated parents, the hooded figures, my rough-looking cousins, the nurse with rotten teeth, the conjoined twins who’d tased me in the clearing, and the bare-chested rednecks, all watching me. I stood there on stage, frightened and in tears. How can my parents do this to me? I’ve always had a good relationship with them. At that moment, I wished more than anything to go back in time, to keep my winnings a secret. 



But now, it was too late.



My mother, Grace, addressed me directly. “Wire us the money, Jordan. And I promise you this will all be over soon.”



I stepped to the edge of the stage, my glare cutting through her like a blade. “You framed me for murders I didn’t commit. You’ve destroyed my life.”



They rose from their seats, tambourines in hand, playing with an unsettling enthusiasm. My parents had never touched an instrument in their lives, and I wasn’t about to stick around to find out what this sudden performance was all about. Without hesitation, I leapt off the stage and bolted toward the big top—a massive tent draped in bold red and white stripes. 



Inside, I found piles of dolls and rows of eerily still mannequins. Heart pounding, I crouched among the clutter, hoping to stay hidden. But I was wrong. Some of the mannequins weren’t lifeless props. Their eyes snapped open, glinting with life, and before I could react, they lunged at me, dragging me out of the tent toward the animal pens behind a row of ornate fences.



I screamed and struggled to fight them off. The distant sound of tambourine music still echoed through the air. They dragged me to a pen where a sleeping lion lay and shoved me inside, slamming the gate shut behind me. I looked up at the lion as it let out a low groan in its sleep, its massive body beginning to stir. One of the men, dressed unnervingly like a mannequin, pulled out an iPad, and shoved it through the pen. 



“Direct me to your website’s bank account,” he demanded.



I shook my head firmly. “No.” 



The lion’s eyes fluttered open, staring into my eyes. Holly mother, I was as good as dead.



The beast rose to its feet, towering over me, and leaned in close. Its rough tongue swiped across my sweaty face. I squeezed my teary eyes shut, bracing for the inevitable, but then an odd realization cut through my fear: the circus grounds had been shut down for decades. What were animals still doing here, locked inside cages? And then I wondered? Was any of this even real to begin with? The two dead cops. The lifeless parishioners. The hooded figures in white robes. The bare-chested rednecks. The nurse with rotten teeth. The conjoined twins who had tased me in the forest. And now this circus with caged animals that were closed decades ago. I knew I had been drugged, but maybe it was much worse than that? 



My eyes cracked open, meeting the lion’s unyielding gaze. It tilted its head, then sat back on its haunches. Before I could make sense of it, I noticed something that made my breath catch—a gold necklace hanging around the lion’s neck. It looked strikingly similar to the one my mother, Grace, always wore. What an odd coincidence, I thought. But I couldn’t shake the feeling. I had to be sure. So, I asked a crazy question.



“Mom? Is that…you?”



The men in mannequin costumes hissed at each other in hushed tones, their frustration clearly visible. The lion became irritated, slamming itself against the pen. 



The men rushed into the pen, restraining me. One of them jabbed a needle into my arm. The world around me dissolved into darkness—again.



I woke up, naked, lying in the middle of the street under the cover of night. My mother, Grace, sat eerily still beside me, her eyes closed as if in deep slumber. I staggered to my feet and her eyes cracked open, locking into mine. Her lips parted slowly, unnervingly wide, as she pushed her hand into her mouth. When she pulled it back out, a writhing snake dangled from her grasp. 



I screamed and bolted down the street, glancing over my shoulder to see if she followed. I reached a fence and scrambled over it and ran into the woods until the outline of our farmhouse emerged through the darkness. I ran into the main house, climbed up the stairs, found some clothes in my room and suited up.  



As I descended the stairs toward the living room, I saw my parents, plus everyone else, seated at the dinner table, each with a cup of coffee in hand, whispering in hushed tones. I joined them in silence, seething, but powerless against my predicament. 



Suddenly, they slowly turned their necks toward me, and began speaking in an eerie, guttural language. And that’s when I remembered. **Witchcraft**. My eyes widened as a memory surfaced—my grandmother had dabbled in witchcraft during her teenage years and surely had passed her teachings to my mother. Their words grew louder, dripping with malice. My body betrayed me, blood began to trickle down my scalp, seeped from my nose and poured from my mouth. 



And then I wondered? What if this wasn’t real as I suspected? What if I was a puppet in their dark ritual, controlled through witchcraft?



There was no time to dwell on the thought. My body lifted off the floor, floating helplessly in the air.



“I’ll give you what you want. Please, stop! It’s all yours!” I cried out.



I dropped like a stone on the floor, grimacing in pain, looking up, seeing their faces twisted in triumph. Their joy was evident, they’d finally got what they asked for. But they couldn’t be more wrong. I staggered to my feet with a devious scheme in mind. 



One of my cousins slid a note and pen across the table, expecting me to scrawl my bank information. Instead, I gripped the pen and lunged forward, driving it straight into my mother’s eye. The makeup of the room began to change. The walls shimmered and warped, pulsing as if alive. My family screamed, their voices deafening, as one by one, they vanished from their chairs.



I woke up in the bathroom, my mother lying beside me, unconscious. I jolted upright and scanned the room. My God! My own mother, with the help of my family, had practiced witchcraft on me, to get after the lottery money I’d won. I walked out of the bathroom, slipped into the hall and started hearing joyful voices. 



I looked down and saw my parents seated at the dinner table, plus, the nurse with decaying teeth, the rough-looking cousins, the conjoined twins who’d tased me, the bare-chested rednecks, and a small crowd of people cloaked in white robes.



I knew there was no way out of here without a bruising fight, but I had no intention of hurting anyone. Desperate for a moment to think, I slipped into hiding in the library—a small adjacent room. I scanned the shelves, crammed with books and family albums. 



My eyes fell on one of the albums, and curiosity got the better of me. I opened it, flipping through the pages. My heart sank. Staring back at me were faces I recognized. 



On one page, I saw a photo of myself as a child, standing outside a farmhouse beside a teenage girl with decaying teeth. She bore an uncanny resemblance to the nurse with the rotten smile. 



I turned the page, and my stomach churned. The conjoined twins who had tased me were in another photograph, standing next to me and my mother, as if they were a happy couple inside a mechanic shop. 



And it didn’t stop there.  



The town’s sheriff. The two deputies. Even the people in white robes from the dinner table. 



And then, there was the last page. 



What I saw made me stumble backward, collapsing onto the floor. Recoiling in complete horror and disgust.



It was a photo of me as a newborn.



I was cradled in my mother’s arms, surrounded by familiar faces. The younger conjoined twins stood proudly at her side. My father, Mark, was there too, along with a crowd of rough-looking teenage cousins and everyone else(sheriff, deputies, parishioners, bare-chested teenagers and younger faces I recognized at the dinner table wearing white robes). 



There was a scribble at the bottom of the page:



*Jordan Summers. Welcome to our ever-growing family.*



Silence tore me apart, then the tears came. The horrifying truth settled in—I had been born into some twisted, incestuous, religious, redneck nightmare of a family.



There was no time to waste. I had to escape. I opened the door cautiously, but the sound of footsteps ascending the stairs froze me in place. They were heading to the bathroom to check on my mother. I closed the door and rushed to the window. 



Outside, an unattended horse stood near the farmhouse entrance, its reins slack. I pushed the window open and slipped onto the roof. The drop below was steep.



I heard a commotion inside—they had found my mother.



I jumped. Pain shot through me as I landed hard on the ground, my leg snapping under the impact. I dragged myself to the horse, hauled myself into the saddle, and urged it into a gallop. Through the dense woods, I rode for what felt like hours, not caring where I was going, as long as it was far away from the farmhouse.



I emerged onto a road and followed it until I reached a bus station in the next town. With the last few dollars in my wallet, I bought a one-way ticket to Oregon. 



Once there, I started over. I changed my name, my social security number, and opened a new bank account with my hidden wealth. I dyed my hair pink and started wearing nose-rings. I found a small, cheap apartment and lived like a ghost, severing all ties to my family and former life. 



I kept my mouth shut and avoided anyone who might pry into my past.



But life had other plans.



I eventually found love, and within a year, Trinity and I were married. We bought a small farmhouse, miles away from the city.



My life was better. Peaceful. But the past never truly left me.



I was scarred forever.



And to those of you wondering if I ever told my wife about the lottery I had won.



A secret is a secret. 



I kept it to myself.

But some days, depending on what I eat, I don't even feel hungry enough to eat more. Should I just eat any way to get my body enough calories or does not feeling hungry mean I don't need them?
This usually happens when I'm eating whole foods so I get a lot of fiber and protein which I know makes you feel fuller. I also tend to have a coffee in the morning which reduces my appetite.
Most days I'll eat 1500ish or more.
I definitely lose weight when I'm undereating, but it's just confusing when people say that amount isn't healthy, but my body isn't telling me it's hungry.

I just feel we have to much down time in the day and although i do my best to keep her entertained, i do utilize screen time. 

I just wish i had more friends that i could get together with for a playdate/ coffee. 

We are not even in the thick of it yet with winter and i think im already cracking, it was easy when i could take the kid outside to run in the late evening.
