1jmcrk7,https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditWritesSeinfeld/comments/1jmcrk7/the_kramer_method/,The Kramer Method,"Kramer stumbles into a new gig as a motivational speaker after being overheard passionately giving life advice to a stranger in a coffee shop. A corporate recruiter is so impressed with his energy and confidence that he hires Kramer on the spot to give weekly speeches to employees at an unnamed company. The problem? Kramer has no idea what the company actually does.

Jerry, George, and Elaine become obsessed with figuring it out, piecing together clues from the snippets of Kramer’s vague yet enthusiastic speeches. Kramer rants about “thinking outside the box” but never specifies what’s inside the box. He encourages employees to “push the envelope” but never clarifies what’s in the envelope. At one point, he advises them to “pivot, pivot, pivot!” leading George to suspect it’s a furniture company. Meanwhile, Jerry thinks it’s a financial firm, and Elaine is convinced it’s a shady pyramid scheme.

Determined to solve the mystery, George sneaks into one of Kramer’s seminars but leaves more confused than ever. Employees seem inspired but equally clueless about their own work. Jerry and Elaine dig deeper, only to find that the company has no website, no signage, and pays Kramer in unmarked checks.

The mystery is finally unraveled when Newman, who coincidentally works in the same building, reveals the truth—it’s not a business at all. Kramer has been giving pep talks at a support group for people struggling with indecision. None of them actually work there; they just keep showing up because of Kramer’s energy.

In the end, Kramer is unfazed. “So what if they don’t have jobs? They’ve got spirit!” he proclaims, as he leads his followers in an impromptu chant. Meanwhile, George, inspired by Kramer’s unearned success, tries his hand at motivational speaking—only to immediately be heckled off the stage.",1,1743216613.0,RedditWritesSeinfeld,0,1.0,False
1jmcrk0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskIndianWomen/comments/1jmcrk0/relationship_with_my_mother/,Relationship with my mother,"I need thoughts/opinions of other women who are around the same age as me. It's basically also a rant because I don't have anyone else to talk to. I'm 33, only child.

Everything I do is never enough for my mother. I've been working since 2012 and I've bought her everything she needs. Clothes, handbags, shoes, petfume, make up, taking her out to lunch, coffee, movies, shopping, birthday gifts, mother's day gifts, I've even been doing groceries for the past 12 years. But she says I've never given her cash to carry.

She has a problem with how I talk. I can't discuss anything with her because it turns into an argument all the time. If I put forward my point of view, and it does not align with hers, then I'm the one who's wrong. 

I don't think I like her anymore. She talks so sweetly to everyone else and then talks to me like I'm the scum of the earth. And I'm worried about the relationship I'm going to have with my soon to be mother in law because I don't have a good relationship with my own mother.

I just wish she would see me as a separate individual with my own thoughts and life, instead of an extension of her who will do exactly everything she says.

I'm sorry if I'm rambling. I don't have anyone else to talk to except my fiancé. 

I guess I just need another woman's thoughts/ opinions.

1jmcr77,https://www.reddit.com/r/biotech/comments/1jmcr77/weathering_the_current_climate_in_biotech/,Weathering the current climate in biotech,"I am now retired after a long career (PhD, academia, startup, pharma, founder -- the whole set!), and the market looks as grim as it did in 2008. Maybe worse. Terrible.

It will turn around eventually, simply because there is so much money to be made on a patented, effective treatment. But the going will be rough in the meantime. We need a few big, blockbuster deals to turn things around.

In the meantime, here are a few things to consider:

1) Developing cures is an innately rewarding activity. Your work matters. This is not true for most careers.

2) The pay is generally good, allowing you to live within your means and accumulate a big safety fund and retirement portfolio. THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT.

3) You will probably get laid off, and you will definately be someplace where there are layoffs. It is customary in these situations to assume that the company just cut the low-performing slackers, but the reality is that these decisions are made without much precision. Slackers will be retained and stars booted. I have seen it over and over.

4) If you are not laid off, FFS reach out to those who were. It is incredibly traumatic, and you can forge bonds that will serve you for the rest of your career. 

5) You should probably switch jobs every 3-4 years or so if you want to maximize your position. Companies are very slow to promote or give raises to people already there. Plus you will maximize your ""steep learning curve"" time.

6) Keep your network strong. You will need it throughout your career. Make time to have a cup of coffee with a former colleague, speak at conferences, etc.

Things are going to be extra tough as an already bad job market is flooded with people jettisoned from government jobs. Try to keep a sense of humor. You have put a lot of work into getting where you are, and it isn't nothing. Good luck, y'all. ",3,1743216581.0,biotech,0,1.0,False

**Part 3: Cousin Time (Sayuri)**

Sayuri pushed a few strands of her blood-red hair out of her eyes with her right hand as she entered the code to her door with her left. The lock clicked and she turned the door handle to enter. Gray tiled floors greeted her in the entry foyer, along with gray walls and white closets. The condo was centered around a living room, with a small kitchen and dining area to the right and a bedroom and bathroom to the left.

She examined the living room as she set down her violin case in the closet, taking in the gray carpet, the couch that was upholstered in a blue and white twill pattern, a matching chair, and a coffee table situated between them creating a sitting area. On the wall hung a large flat screen television.

*They weren’t kidding when they said these places were furnished. I can’t believe this is all for me…in just a few weeks I’ve got from being a test file that never should have been compiled to being a real human being to all of this. What did I do to deserve this? It is a bit gray in here though…I’ll need to get some art for the walls.*

On the coffee table sat an envelope, which she opened to find a note from the FXI CFO and a plastic card. Sayuri quickly scanned the note, which included details on the bank account and credit card that had been established for her. She pocketed the card and proceeded to the kitchen, admiring the stainless steel appliances and granite countertops.

*Maybe we could have a girls’ night in and all cook dinner together and watch a movie one night or something. That could be fun.*

Sayuri yawned as fatigue from the previous days’ events began to overcome her excited energy.

*A nap wouldn’t be bad right now. I’ve got half an hour before we need to meet back up. I’ll go and lie down for a bit.*

She walked to the bedroom, which featured a king-sized bed with white linens, a small desk, nightstands, a dresser, closet, and a small couch. Walking over to the floor to ceiling windows she opened the sheer curtains, allowing her to look out to the city, the park across from the tower, and other buildings in the vicinity.

*I can’t complain about the view, that’s for sure. This will be really cool at night when everything is lit up.*

Sayuri removed her taupe blazer, red neck ribbon, purple hair clip, and tan sweater, hanging them in the closet. She kicked off her shoes, unbuttoned her shirt, unzipped her skirt, and sat down on the bed in her white bodysuit and socks.

*This bed is so comfortable…I already feel sleepy. Definitely going to have to expand my wardrobe though soon and add some cute outfits to my closet beyond my uniform…I hope I don’t oversleep and miss the next regroup. I can’t wait to go shopping with everyone.*

She put her head on the pillow and closed her eyes, feeling relaxed and losing herself in her thoughts.

*I shouldn’t even exist, but here I am. For that matter, I shouldn’t have even existed in our digital reality let alone the real world. Just a test file that got accidentally compiled. I’m so lucky. I’ve got family and friends, a great place to live, and a date to look forward to. What more could a girl want?*

Sayuri drifted off to sleep with a contented smile on her face.

Her rest, however, was cut very short by someone knocking on the door.

“Huh? Who is it?” Sayuri asked groggily as she climbed out of bed, pulled on her skirt, and quickly pulled on and buttoned her shirt.

She walked to the door and opened it to find Sayori, Natsuki, and Yuri looking concerned. Sayori looked a bit disheveled, her shirt untucked and her red hair bow sitting on her right side rather than its usual place on her left. Natsuki and Yuri looked more presentable, their uniforms complete and tidy.

*Looks like Sayori must have tried to take a nap too.*

“Oh, hi everyone,” Sayuri greeted them, “Is everything okay?”

“Everything’s great with our condos,” Natsuki began, “But there is a problem. Listen for a second. Can you hear that?”

Sayuri paused. The only noise she could hear was the soft hum of the air conditioning system.

*Huh?*

“What am I supposed to be hearing?”

Natsuki shook her head. “That’s not it. Listen to what you’re not hearing.”

“I’m confused,” Sayuri replied, puzzled.

“Allow me to explain,” Yuri said, “For the duration of our virtual existence, the simulation featured a soundtrack. Perhaps we did not notice it until now in our excitement, but this world does not appear to have the same constant background music. We all find this to be rather disconcerting and wanted to get your thoughts on this matter.”

“Ohhh…,” Sayuri nodded, “I guess I never really noticed that. Maybe it’s because I wasn’t part of the simulated world for as long as you all were, but quiet doesn’t really bother me.”

“There are clearly parts of this world that do have music all the time,” Sayori added, “Like when we were in the lobby of the tower or on the floor with all the restaurants and shops. But not here. I tried to sleep but I couldn’t. It was weird…the silence was just too overwhelming!”

Sayuri frowned, concerned for her cousins’ and friend’s distress.

*She’s already struggling with her feelings and now this experience. I think I need to take her somewhere to get her mind off all this.*

“I’m sure it must be difficult for you all,” Sayuri said sympathetically, “Maybe we can find a way to create the background noise you want. By the way, where are Monika and MC?”

Natsuki shrugged. “I think they must have fallen asleep. We knocked on Monika’s door, but she didn’t answer, and I heard snoring noises through the door when we walked by MC’s place.”

“We appear to be under no time constraints, so we thought it best to leave Monika to her slumber,” Yuri added, “While we have planned to meet up in half an hour, it is obviously not a hard deadline.”

“Hey Yuri, while we’re waiting for Monika and MC to wake up, I want to get your opinion on something,” Natsuki said, “I’m trying to figure out how to best make use of space in my living room, and since our places are identical, I figured we could work through it together and think up some good ideas. I need to store my manga, you’ll want to display your knives…we can come up with the best layouts together.”

Yuri contemplated. “Yes, I had been pondering how best to display my knives in way that they will be both clearly visible and safe. I admit that I was once somewhat ashamed of my hobby, but now that I have my own space it has given me new confidence and I’m sure it has done the same for you. I’m sure that with our combined insights, we can come up with ideal display solutions.”

“We’ll catch up with you girls in a bit,” Natuski said with a grin, turning back towards her door.

As Natsuki and Yuri left, Sayuri turned to her cousin. “Sayori, since it seems we have some time to ourselves, how do you feel about going upstairs, grabbing a coffee, and chatting for a bit? Everything’s been going so fast, but I wanted us to have some cousin time too.”

Sayori’s face lit up. “Absolutely! Cousin time and coffee both sound great! Let me just straighten out my clothes a bit and then we can go.”

She walked to her door and entered her code, quickly disappearing into her home.

Yuri looked over her shoulder. “Please let me know if they have tea as well and if it appears to be of good quality. Cousins don’t let cousins drink bad beverages. We’ll journey upstairs to come meet you when everyone is ready to explore the building more.”

Sayuri grinned. “We’ll have to see what the options are.”

*I admire Yuri’s passion. It’s funny how someone can have such a strong opinion on something like coffee or tea. I wonder what passions I will find…I was never programmed with any specific hobbies.*

Sayuri returned to her bedroom, putting her sweater, neck ribbon, blazer, and shoes back on. Her expression faltered as she thought about her original programming.

*I wasn’t really programmed with much of anything other than my appearance and some personality traits that are meant to make me similar to my cousins. There was no place in the story for another member of the Literature Club…I’m just that strange red-haired girl who showed up one day. Why do I exist? Why am I here? Whatever the reason, I’m just lucky I’m here.*

Before Sayuri could further contemplate the reasons for her existence, Sayori returned. Her bow was now in its usual place, and she had fixed her shirt and skirt. She called out to her cousin from the doorway.

“Ready to go, Sayuri?”

Sayuri nodded, and the two young women walked together to the center of the floor and took the escalators up two flights to the 60th floor.

“I think the coffee shop was this way,” Sayuri said, gesturing to the right.

“There it is,” Sayori pointed to a sign that said “COFFEE TEA TIRAMISU” in large letters.

“Any idea what tiramisu is?” Sayuri asked.

“I don’t know, but it looks good. Let’s go!” Sayori replied, stepping into the café, which featured natural wood furnishings for a very organic appearance which contrasted with the polished granite-look tiles of the hallway. Classical music played quietly in the background.

“This music isn’t bad for background noise,” Sayori observed, “It’s very calming.”

The cousins stepped up to the counter to order, which was being managed by a young woman who seemed to be about their age.

“Welcome to Coffee, Tea, Tiramisu,” she greeted them, “What can I get for you today?”

“Hi! I’m Sayuri, and this is Sayori. And umm…I actually don’t know. This is our first time here. We just moved into the building,” Sayuri said, slightly self-conscious, “I know I’d like something to drink, but what would you recommend? Coffee or tea?”

“I’d suggest an iced latte,” the manager replied, mildly confused by Sayuri’s introduction, “It’s one of our most popular drinks and balances the coffee flavor with some sweetness.”

Sayuri nodded. “I’ll have one of those then, please. I have a cousin who strongly prefers tea, but I feel like I should try coffee today.”

“It’s her other cousin, Yuri, who thinks so strongly about tea,” Sayori clarified, “I’m not quite as passionate about it, so I would like one of those lattes as well, please.”

“Oh, so you two are cousins?” the manager asked, glancing between the two young women standing at the counter, “I can see the resemblance. Okay, so we’ve got two iced lattes…any dessert to go with that?”

Sayori nodded emphatically. “Yes, we’d like to try to some tiramisu too.”

“Certainly,” the manager replied, totaling up the bill on the cash register, “Would you like that for here or to go?”

“For here, please,” Sayuri said, handing the manager her credit card, “It’s good to know for the future that we can get it to go though.”

The manager nodded. “Okay. And if you don’t mind me asking, what kind of contacts are you wearing? I really like the purple thing you’ve got going on. You’ve got this whole anime girl vibe that’s pretty cool.”

Confusion came over Sayuri’s face. “Contacts?”

The manager looked surprised. “Yeah, you know. Your eyes. The bluish-purple looks great but it’s obviously not your natural color. Just curious what brand of contact lenses you’re wearing.”

Sayuri froze. *Has she guessed that we’re not natural? Or do people here just change their eye colors with contact lenses?*

“Oh, well…my eyes have been this color for so long I don’t really recall off the top of my head,” Sayuri said cautiously, “We live in the building though so I’m sure we’ll be back soon. I’ll double check and let you know next time we’re here.”

The manager smiled as she handed Sayuri her receipt. “No worries. Thank you for coming in and enjoy your coffee and tiramisu.”

Sayuri thanked the manager, followed Sayori to a table, and sat down. The drinks and dessert were delivered quickly on a dark wood tray. The two cousins looked over the tall glasses containing their iced lattes and the plate of tiramisu in the middle.

“This looks good,” Sayori said, picking up her glass and taking a long sip from the straw, “And it’s really sweet! I like this a lot.”

 “Don’t get too enamored with it…you’ll make Yuri sad,” Sayuri teased, before switching her voice to a fair imitation of Yuri’s more formal tones, “After all, tea is the one true beverage.”

Sayori giggled. “You’re funny. They do have tea as well though, and it looked good, so we should recommend this place to her. I think she would like it. Thanks for paying, by the way. Where did you get that card?”

Sayuri took a sip from her glass. “Yeah…this is good. And the card was in the packet in my apartment. I assumed we all got them. Did you not see yours?”

“Oops,” Sayori said with a shake of her head, “I saw the envelope, but I didn’t open it. Remind me to go grab it before we go shopping.”

Sayori and Sayuri sat in silence for a long moment, enjoying their coffee and the ambiance of the café.

“So…do you think anyone here has any idea that we’re not…normal?” Sayuri asked, glancing back at the manager, “The store manager thought my eye color was unnatural at least. I wonder if it’s common for people to change their eye color here?”

“I think she just thought your eyes looked cool,” Sayori replied with a shrug, “I wouldn’t worry too much about it. We should come up with an explanation though for if we get asked about our appearance.”

Sayuri looked around at the other patrons in the café. “The good news is that we pretty much blend in here except for our hair and eye colors. And our clothes, but we’ll change that when we go shopping. I’m glad that when we came here, we didn’t end up retaining our anime style appearance.”

Sayori smiled. “Definitely. I’m looking forward to getting some cute new outfits, but I’m happy with how I look. Are you?”

Sayuri nodded, leaning back in her chair and putting her hands behind her head in a posture of relaxation. “Yes, I am. I just…I guess I still kinda can’t believe that I’m here, you know? After everything that happened there were times when I really didn’t think I would make it. And now I’m sitting in a cool café with my cousin having a nice time. I have a home. I have family and friends. It’s…we’re so lucky.”

Sayori considered, her expression flickering. “Yeah. It’s pretty amazing. It really is. But I’m having trouble really feeling excited…I’m trying to put on an enthusiastic face because that will help everyone else be happy. It’s like I want to be happy, but something just keeps telling me that I’m worthless and shouldn’t even be here and that the FXI guys only brought me here because they felt bad for me. I just wish I knew how to make these thoughts stop. I wish I could feel the way you do and really feel how lucky we are to be here.”

Sayuri gave her cousin an encouraging smile. “Sayori, it’s okay not to feel one hundred percent all the time. It’s okay if you’re not feeling excited. You’ve been through a lot. But we all love you and care about you. And I’m so grateful to have you as my cousin. When I first…arrived…to the Literature Club, you made me feel welcome even though I was an emotionless mess of a test file who wasn’t even supposed to exist. You made me feel like a part of the group immediately and I was so thrilled when I found out we were family. You belong here, Sayori. They didn’t bring you here because of pity. They brought you here because you’re worth it.”

Sayori met Sayuri’s eyes, visibly struggling internally.  “I was so happy to find out that we were cousins too. But we almost lost you when that glitch hit the simulation, and you gave up your chance to come here so that Monika could have her dream and we thought the MES people were going to take you for some horrible experiments…”

Her voice trailed off as she thought back to the events that had taken place in the control room of Metaverse Enterprise Solutions’ universal constructor, the nanotech factory that had allowed the members of the Literature Club to leave their digital reality and enter the real world fully human.

“I’m so glad we didn’t lose you,” Sayori said, her voice barely above a whisper, “You’re my family. I don’t know what I would have done if I had lost you. I think that would have been more than just rain clouds…that would have been an entire hurricane.”

Sayuri smiled reassuringly. “We all made it, in no small part thanks to our new friends. Between the FXI guys and the Music Club, they all really did a lot for us. Speaking of which, how do you like your new home?”

Sayori’s expression returned to a smile as she pushed her negative thoughts to the side with the change of topic. “It’s really great. I love having all of that space, and I like that it’s nice and new and clean…my old room was always messy. I tried to get MC to help me clean it up, but he never did.”

Sayuri laughed. “I don’t know if cleaning your room is among a boyfriend’s duties. But yeah, it is nice that everything is new. I would like to liven my place up a bit with some art though. Oh, and we should also totally have a girls’ night in soon when we all get together and cook and watch a movie.”

“Ohh…that’s a great idea,” Sayori replied with excitement, “Let’s definitely plan that soon.”

“Depending on how things go for me, maybe there could also be a double date with you and MC in the future,” Sayuri suggested, “Remind me to find a cute dress for date night by the way.”

Sayori nodded. “Yeah, that could be fun…I know MC mentioned he was planning a date night soon so I’m looking forward to that and I’ll definitely need to find a cute dress too. But honestly…do you think he’s really going to take me out for date night? I trust him, I really do, but sometimes I feel like he’s still kinda dense and don’t want to get my hopes up only to have him not follow through.”

Sayuri held up a hand. “Sayori, MC confessed his love for you in front of the whole club, and I’ve seen the way he looks at you. I really don’t think he has eyes for anyone else and I don’t think he would want to disappoint you.”

Sayori smiled. “I suppose you’re right. Maybe I’m overreacting. Thanks for listening to my concerns and drama and reminding me that things are pretty good. I feel like I’m usually the one telling others everything will be okay. It’s nice to have someone tell me that too.”

Sayuri returned her smile. “Of course. I’m always here to support you and listen. That’s what cousins are for. On another topic, have you thought at all what you think you’re going to try to do for a job?”

Sayori shook her head. “I’ve started thinking about a few ideas, but nothing really firm yet. I’m going to take a few weeks to get settled in here and then figure it out.”

Sayuri nodded. “That’s probably a good idea. I’ve thought about potentially getting some kind of graduate degree instead of working immediately. Maybe something in business.”

Sayori leaned forward in her chair, picked up a fork, and cut off a piece of the tiramisu, “I’m sure we’ll all figure it out. But we have time to think about it. For now, we have dessert in front of us that needs to be sampled.”

“Absolutely,” Sayuri agreed, picking up her own fork.

Sayori’s eyes became wide as she took a bite of the layered dessert.

“Oh. My. Goodness,” she said, staring at the dessert with wide eyes, “I think this is the best thing I’ve ever eaten.”

Sayuri grinned. “That good, huh?”

She followed Sayori’s lead and ate a small bite of tiramisu.

“Oh, wow. You’re right. That is spectacular.”

*This is a wonderful dessert, and it’s so good to see her smiling. Maybe all she needed was something to take her mind off of things for a bit.*

The dessert was quickly finished, and Sayori glanced at the empty plate ruefully before looking up at the red-haired young woman sitting across from her with a smile. “Thanks, Sayuri. I needed this. It’s been nice to have some cousin time and relax. Sitting together and enjoying a spectacular dessert like this…it helps me feel like maybe things could be alright.”

Sayuri nodded. “For sure. We really haven’t been able to spend much one-on-one time together since…we got here. I hope we can do this again soon.”

Sayori returned the nod emphatically. “For sure. And I’m definitely asking MC to take me here for dessert when we do date night.”

Sayuri smiled. “I think that’s a great idea.”

As they stood to leave and cleared their tray, they saw Natsuki, Yuri, and Monika walking down the hall to meet them. Monika gave a friendly wave as the group approached the café.

“How was it?” Monika asked, studying the menu displayed on flat-screen TVs above the counter.

“Tiramisu is delicious and the iced lattes were good and make me feel energized!” Sayori declared happily.

Yuri rolled her eyes but said nothing.

“Good to know,” Monika replied with amusement, “We were about to go check out the library on B1 and then do some shopping if you want to join us. The library might be a good place for us to continue Literature Club meetings if we all want to do that.”

“Sounds like fun,” Sayori agreed, “But let me guess: MC is still asleep and snoring?”

Monika gave a short laugh and shook her head. “No. He woke up shortly after you two came up here and went down to the sixth floor with the FXI guys to check out some video games they have in their office and to chat with them about his new job.”

“That’s putting it nicely,” Natsuki added, “What he actually said was ‘shopping is boooring.’ Typical MC.”

Sayori giggled. “Yep. That’s MC. But that’s okay. I’m glad to hear that he’s already thinking about his new job.”

“Before I forget, the FXI guys brought these for us,” Monika said, pulling two smartphones, one with a red case and one with a blue case, out of the pockets of her skirt, “These two are for you.”

Sayuri turned to Sayori. “Oh nice. That will be very helpful to have these. Any preference on color?”

“I’d like the blue one if that’s cool with you,” Sayori replied.

Sayuri nodded. “I wanted the red one anyway, so it works out perfectly.”

Monika handed the phones to Sayuri and Sayori, who placed them in the pockets of their skirts.

Natsuki gestured towards the elevator bay excitedly. “Alright. To the library!”",1,1743216570.0,DDLC,1,1.0,False

🕯️Tell us a bit about yourself:

Welll yk my name and shit like that. I’m currently a student about to graduate like rlllllly soon. I have my own small business. I’m hugeeee on growth, healing, and wellness yk so my business is like that. I absolutely loooove to help people. It’s just my passion and calling. My business is called The Healing Coven (THC😏) and it’s like a blend of witchcraft, mental health coaching, apothecary goods, and stonerrrr shit. I’m very creative and make some resin goods toooo. Honestly, my energy shifts a lot and some days I’m more of a hyper-productive tornado and others I just want to be left alone bc I need to recharge lol. So some days I may be texting u back after seconds whereas other days, I won’t answer bc it’s my self care, no screen day lol. I am very deep and I value honesty, loyalty, dark humor lol, and someone who actuallly cares. Checking in and making sure you’re good is my love language fr. I wanna make sure ur good ts. Anyways, I am a vibe lol. I have a ton of ideas, I like to do a lot, and rarely anything holds me back. I have IC and endo too btw. So I do have some hard times yk but it’s just a small little piece of the cake that makes me lol. Alsoooo I looooove iced coffee and cranberry juice. I love steak, pasta, pho, potstickers, ouuuu and weed. I love weed. Huge stoner right here. I also love some other stuff too. I like spiritual awakenings and trips so yk 😏. My favorite 2 animals are polar bears and crows. Fav colors are black most definitely, a beige type of brown so like sepia, and then a dark forest green and a sage green. I have like 42-43 tattoos and I do some tats myself. I also have 2 tongue piercings, a septum, and my ears have gauges. I used to pierce and tattoo. I still do but moving onto more yk. 



🕯️What do you enjoy doing in your free time?

I loveeee to cook, read, write, paint, draw, tattoo, organize shit, drive, listen to music or watch my comfort shows/movies. 



🕯️How would you describe your personality?

I am a very deep, introspective person. I have a fun and chaotic side but can also be nonchalant and calm ash. I can be very quiet or pretty crackhead depending on the scenario and day. I can be very blunt but also very caring. I am independent ash but love deep connections. And when I say deep, I mean D E E P. I feel like I’m the blond and brunette friend duo in one. I’m the sun and the moon together lol. Yin and yang ts. I love structure but also value flexibility. I am a big problem solver. I have a pretty sharp mind. Resilient. Creative asf. I’m always looking to improve myself and my life for the better. I ask way too many questions sometimes but I just always want to learn and know more. I don’t tolerate bs at all tbh. I am also reallyyyy smart. Alsoooo, I love being there for people and all. I love the deep connection but I also do need my own space yk. Sometimes I need to recharge or just be by myself for a lil. 



🕯️What’s a fun fact about you or something people might not know at first glance?

I’ve been hit by a car then he tried to kidnap me lol. 
Also I graduated high school at 16, am now graduating uni at 20 :) 



🕯️What are you looking for in a friend?

I want somebody with similar interests as me. Someone who is loyal, funny and down to talk about anything, someone who is empathetic and can feel for me like I can for them. I also want somebody who lifts me up, as I will them. I don’t like when females put other females down like cmon now. I wanna lift each other up. Raise one another’s vibrations. Maybe someone who is spiritual like I am? I want someone who wants the same kind of friendship as well. We don’t have to be connected at the hip lol but it would be nice to talk all the time and be there when one of us needs to vent or laugh or wtv. 



🕯️What’s your preferred way of communicating?

Texting is my favorite way of communicating. I am not one to call, I tend to get rlly busy sometimes but I would be willing to meet in person if possible too yk. 



🕯️How often do you like to hang out or stay in touch with friends?

I love deep frequent conversations. Let’s chat it up everyday. We don’t need to give each other 10 hours of our time a day just talking deep. I want it to be yk different. One day we talk deep, the next we talking goofy with each other. It doesn’t need to be that serious. I want a long term connection. A bestie. But it’s rlly not like we have to talk everyday just yk… want someone who is present. 



🕯️What’s most important to you in a friendship?

I would probably say support and trust. 



🕯️What do you value in conversations or interactions with friends?

Deep talks, jokes, being able to vent, and shared silence where there’s no expectations. 



🕯️Do you have any pet peeves or things that might turn you off in a friendship?

Being disrespectful or being lowkey disrespectful in jokes and shit. Lack of communication. Constant negativity. Talking down on everybodyyyy. Not being able to take a joke… 



🕯️How do you feel about traveling or meeting up in person?

I looooove traveling and would eventually be down yk. I do have social anxiety and it can be hard for me to meetup or do calls and things like that. Im working on it yk but be patient, we dont know what the future holds. I would eventually want to yk. 



🕯️Are you interested in exploring new activities with a friend?

Most definitely. I love learning new skills and just learning or growing in general. 




🕯️How would you handle conflict or disagreements in a friendship?

Honestly maybe take a second then come back later. Maybe just calm down the situation and then sit down and figure it out, as adults. No fighting or yelling. Tell me what’s going on and I’ll do the same. We will sit there and handle it till it’s resolved. If u can’t do that, then we can’t be friends. Being petty, rude, and disrespectful is not for me. Just bc we have an argument, doesn’t mean u throw respect out the window lol. Handle this shit w me like adults. 



🕯️What’s something you’re working on personally (growth, goals, etc.) that a friend might support you in?

Honestly my own growth and personal development. I have so many goals. I have some problems yk, health wise mainly and so my routine has been so out of wack. I am trying to get on track, make a plan and goals, then start on my journey of getting myself up and going yk. I wanna be healthier (in all aspects so spiritually, mentally, physically, etc) and reach my cool. If you could support me in that, I would always do the same and that would be awesome. 



🕯️Is there anything specific you’d like to share to help us understand you better?

I am a witch so I am very spiritual. I was born into it and grew up in it as well. My whole life my families were always split and half was Christian whereas the other half was catholic. My mom and immediate family were witches and so were some of my other ancestors. I have been around religion my whole life and have some minimal trauma yk. I have always been hated on for being a witch and into witchcraft. This is why I want a friend who is into the same things as I am. I don’t hate on religion at all, it’s just not my cup of tea. But when you come to me saying I’m going to hell, of course ima bash on u cause what?? No I do not worship the devil. No i do not sacrifice babies. No I am not evil. I have been bashed on for so much that’s not even true lol. I believe in the universe and spirit. I do not believe in god or the devil. I manifest, I don’t pray. I do spells and rituals but honestly a lot of them are to better myself and help me with my journey. I’m not sitting there casting love spells on your dad, chill! 



🕯️Why should someone want to be friends with you?

Honestly I am reallyyyy fucking dope man. I am loyal as fuck, funny ash, smart as shit, and just a good ass friend. If u need me im there. I mean if u call me I probably won’t answer but if u text me im right there for you dawg. I’m like a whole ass mental health coach like actuallyyy so I got you with whatever mannn. Need some advice? I’m a pro. Need a shoulder to cry on? I’m all in. Need to let some shit out ? Shit I gotchu man I’ll let some shit out with you. Just need anything in general? I am ready and already by yo side! Butttttt the second I see you’re not there for me in the same way?? I’m gone. I have always been the giver and never the receiver and I am no longer taking that yk. So cmon if u want that, at least be willing to give out too yk. 



🕯️Anything else you’d like to add?

Honestly not really. Just text me and get to know me. Don’t be dry or be basic ash. I hate that shit and it will die out quick trust. I’m too deep for shallow talks. Text me and tell me why your dad left your mom. Tell me why you’re missing a finger. I wanna know everything yk. Be unique, that’s what I’m looking for. Need my soul sister, my bestie boo yfm. 



P.S. a lot of shit that I say I’m just joking yk. I’m sarcastic as fuck. U might think I’m like a lover girl or some shit and whole time I’m just joshin. I am a lover girl but I’m not gonna sit here and be all cringe sorry. If u think I am, I’m most definitely laughing at myself. 

If you’re a Scorpio, that’s a plus and u should definitely text me like rnnnn. 

Also if u read alllll of this, props to u. 😏🥰🖤

I’m a sophomore at UIUC majoring in math, chill most of the time (except approaching ddl)and keep things clean and organized. I love photography, good books, and exploring new coffee shops around town. But tbh traveling is much better since this town doesn’t have much to do. I value a peaceful, balanced home — quiet when it needs to be, but also open to friendly chats and spontaneous adventures 

Looking for someone who’s similarly responsible, clean, and down-to-earth. If you’re sociable, respectful, and looking for a chill, super-convenient place to live, hit me up! .

Thanks!

I’ll try to keep it short as I can but I want to give as much detail so I can have proper feedback. I (23M) and my gf (23F) have been together for 1 year. It’s been poetic to say the least, from both sides. She is lovely, very kind and compassionate, very loving to myself and my son. Gets along swimmingly with my family and hers with me as well. We have never yelled at each other, we are wonderful communicators and always solve the problems together. I can confidently say up until recent we had no true issues. 

About 5 weeks ago, I found out an incident that had happened with a coworker of ours that happened much before we had met. Maybe 2 years ago, give or take (Just to clarify, they never slept together only 2 dates and he pursued her for about a year while married, ending in his wife divorcing him). While it’s not a huge deal to me and Im not one to judge anyone’s past, I had specifically asked upwards of 7-8 times if anything had ever happened concerning this specific coworker. I didn’t care of feel threatened but ever since he found out her and I were together his attitude towards me did a complete 180. We went from friendly and talkative.. to short, pointed and very odd remarks about my gf. 

This threw me off an I had specifically asked about this behavior and if there is anyway she could help me understand the sudden change. She never alluded to this issue and was adamant that nothing ever happened. Well turns out another person had their suspicions of something that had happened and finally I pressed her a little further as my gut was telling me that wasn’t the full truth. It turns out that all it was and like I said I couldn’t care less, but it really dampened the trust I had built in her. 

I decided to break it off then and let sleeping dogs lie. Up until this point I have never had anxiety attacks or knots outside of drinking too much coffee. But that night I felt sick, like I had taken it too far and that I was seriously walking away from something that is repairable. I brushed it off and didn’t reach out. She pursued me unwaveringly for 3-4 days and even broke down at work multiple times because of it. Finally she met me after work 4 weekends ago (roughly 4-5 days after this event) and gives me a very long letter. In this letter I was blown away by  everything she thought. She held nothing back and never did anything but admit wrong doing and never made an excuse for her actions. 

On top of my truly believing to my core that I had made a mistake and praying about it, I decided to slowly take steps to reconciliation. Everything was great, she kept true to all her commitment and promises and truly opened up more about everything I could possibly find out or that may hurt me in the future (nothing I didn’t already know). This lasted and was great but everyday I was questioning her silently, I wouldn’t say anything other than I slowly realized I still didn’t trust her. I didn’t fully believe everything she said and always felt like I was looking and searching for an out or to be right. Finally I pulled the trigger last night after we agreed to spend today with each other and head into work Saturday from my home. 

Once I sent the text, I was very polite but to the point that my lack of trust in her was wavering and that I didn’t think I could do this with her but I still did very much love her. About 35 minutes later she started to frantically call me and asked to come in and that she was at my house. I let her in and we were very quiet for a while until the silence grew painful. She asked and begged me to ‘jump’ for her and to let her show me that everything she said was true and pure. While I truly love her I was hesitant to take that huge leap of faith after I already had and it had been broken. After a few hours of very respectful talking and communication, we agreed that we jump together. I agreed not to attempt to leave again just because I’m still hurting and she agreed to be transparent and honest and help rebuild. She then spent the night and planned to go home in the morning, pack a bag and continue our plans. This would have taken a total of 2 hours max. 

When she got home she went AWOL, absolute silence. Then sends me a very shocking text that she’s very in love with me and that she loves us but doesn’t like the cycle of rinse and repeat we seem to be starting. I ask to meet and she agrees, it turns out when she made it home her sister sat her down and told her that they are concerned because of her frantic and late departure three times to my home in the past month to make sure we didn’t split up. 

When we met she explained that she needed space and that she wanted to be able to breathe and that she feels as if she’s begging me to love and trust her. We have polar opposite responses to this specific issue, hers being to cling tighter and mine being to walk away fairly quickly and without warning. I understand that I’ve also made the mistake of giving her no reason to trust that I won’t walk away again. After promising the first time I won’t, doing it abruptly one night and then agreeing again that I’d take that leap of faith with her once more.

The part I need advice on:
She asked for space, not a break or to break up but just space from each other for a bit. She asked to keep our locations on, we set ground rules to stay exclusive and trust that our loyalty will not waver in the time being. She agreed we will keep up some sense of normalcy, such as being our normal selves at work, occasional texting and checking in and maybe spending a few hours a week eating out or going to the park. She wasn’t very specific on a timeframe but did say she thinks it’s best we take anywhere from 2-6 weeks to both determine our best relationship-repair tools and tactics then resume us and put an end to this cycle. I agreed, not very willingly and have again turned into a slight ball of anxiety. She’s never given me a reason to doubt her loyalty only her trust. But asked that for at least the first 48 hours refrain from texting and both just relax and breathe. 

In my mind I don’t necessarily see this as super healthy as communication in solving the issue together is the common goal, not ignoring the problem and each other. I also think we both have cracks in the foundation of trust for different reasons that this break may not fix.

Am I wrong in believing that we maybe signing the relationships death warrant?


I also at least plan on waiting until first contact to communicate to her but thought that similarly writing a letter conveying all my thoughts, feelings and strategies would be optimal so that she understands this is not one sided and that I want this at bad as she does.

Does this sound like a poor idea?


I did at one point ask for space after the initial break up and that was the 3-4 days I mentioned earlier, to which she sadly agreed to. When I reinitiated contact and brought some normalcy back into our lives, that’s when she gave me the letter she had wrote the first day of the break up.

Should I wait out the silence and give her the space she wants? 
Should I make one last stand and effort to form healthy repair strategies with her and keep moving forward?
Should I quietly or verbally let this relationship go? 

To reiterate, even now I don’t doubt the love and choice of daily love we have for each other. She was very emotional asking for time and seemed to be hurting bad when starting the conversation but also seemed extremely optimistic that this was going to be good for us and that us proving to each other that I can trust her word and she can trust my commitment, we will flourish. She also agreed with my sentiment that this wasn’t enough to fix the issue but a start. But I do have a slight feeling that while her emotions were all genuine, the ‘fix’ to our issues was regurgitated and not actually her own personal wants. It seemed very against our entire relationship up until this point and the way we solve our issues.

1jmchwt,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1jmchwt/food/,Food.,"Hello boys! 

Question... 

Who cooks or prepares their own food (most nights) for dinner, do you eat at work for lunch in a cafeteria, do you do work lunches, or do you take a packed lunch-box into work? What about breakfast? Do you do it? Do you eat a bit later, or straight once your up?

Just curious. 

Most evenings I cook for myself and my husband - either from scratch, or a combo of some instant meals, or stuff like a bolognaise or a chicken tagine that I've frozen that is defrosted during the week, and cook up some rice or pasta, maybe sone steamed veges. I'm not a huge breakfast person, mostly just a cup of coffee. But recently, my workplace offers free cereal and milk and toast with jam from 0800-0845, so I try to get in to use that work perk. Most days I try to take in a lunch cooler bag with either the night before's dinner, some snacks, some fruit. My work canteen is ok, but hideously expensive. In my previous work place we could buy really cheap subsidised breakfast bits and pieces and a decent hot lunch, 75% of the time it was almost restaurant quality, and very popular with the staff. If I was too busy at work for a proper lunch, they had doyp everyday or salad bar to grab a quick bite or a not-too-bad sarnie (sandwhich). I work in education, so the food can be dire or really good. My current college the food is OK, but expensive. And further education colleges pay less than high schools, so am forced to take in lunch. ",1,1743215735.0,askgaybros,0,1.0,False

I’ll try to keep it short as I can but I want to give as much detail so I can have proper feedback. I (22M) and my gf (24F) have been together for 10 months. It’s been poetic to say the least, from both sides. She is lovely, very kind and compassionate, very loving to myself and my 3 year old son. Gets along swimmingly with my family and hers with me as well. We have never yelled at each other, we are wonderful communicators and always solve the problems together. I can confidently say up until recent we had no true issues. 

About 5 weeks ago, I found out an incident that had happened with a coworker of ours that happened much before we had met. Maybe 2 years ago, give or take (Just to clarify, they never slept together only 2 dates and he pursued her for about a year while married, ending in his wife divorcing him). While it’s not a huge deal to me and Im not one to judge anyone’s past, I had specifically asked upwards of 7-8 times if anything had ever happened concerning this specific coworker. I didn’t care of feel threatened but ever since he found out her and I were together his attitude towards me did a complete 180. We went from friendly and talkative.. to short, pointed and very odd remarks about my gf. 

This threw me off an I had specifically asked about this behavior and if there is anyway she could help me understand the sudden change. She never alluded to this issue and was adamant that nothing ever happened. Well turns out another person had their suspicions of something that had happened and finally I pressed her a little further as my gut was telling me that wasn’t the full truth. It turns out that all it was and like I said I couldn’t care less, but it really dampened the trust I had built in her.

1jmcbqu,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1jmcbqu/the_reflection_final_part/,The Reflection [Final Part],"I don’t know how to explain what just happened. I don’t even know if I should be writing this. But I need someone—anyone—to hear me before it’s too late.

After last night, I barely slept. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw my reflection just standing there, waiting. I don’t know how long it had been watching me, but I knew what it wanted.

I couldn’t stop thinking about that message on the glass.

*DO IT.*

I woke up this morning with a pit in my stomach. The air felt thicker, like something was pressing down on me. Everything was just a little off—the weight of my phone in my hand, the way my coffee tasted, the way my shoes felt on my feet. Reality wasn’t wrong exactly, but it wasn’t right either.

I kept catching my reflection out of the corner of my eye. I don’t know if it was moving when I wasn’t, but I stopped checking. I couldn’t bring myself to look anymore.

Because deep down, I knew. It was waiting for me to break.

And then, I slipped.

I glanced at the bathroom mirror—just for a second, just long enough to catch my reflection’s gaze.

Something in my head lurched, a static-heavy pressure wrapping around my thoughts like a fist.

And then—

I don’t even remember driving there. One moment I was staring at my phone, debating whether to text my mom, and the next, I was parked outside my parents’ house.

I sat there for a long time.

My chest felt tight. I could see them through the window, moving around inside. My dad on the couch, my mom in the kitchen. It looked so normal, like I could just walk in and pretend nothing ever happened.

But I couldn’t.

My hands gripped the steering wheel so tightly my knuckles turned white. My stomach twisted, nausea creeping in. The guilt, the shame—it was crushing. My brain screamed at me to *just do it*, to get out of the car, to knock on the damn door and say something.

But I didn’t.

I couldn’t.

I sat there until my breath started coming too fast, my vision blurred, and my skin felt like it was crawling. My heartbeat pounded in my ears.

And then—

I caught my reflection in the rearview mirror.

Its lips curled into something almost gentle. Almost pleased.

Pressure slammed into my skull, a buzzing, electric hum spreading through my limbs. My fingers twitched. My breath hitched.

And then—

I blinked.

I was standing on the porch.

I didn’t remember getting out of the car.

I didn’t remember walking up the steps.

My body moved forward. My fist raised. My knuckles rapped against the wood.

*No—*

The door opened.

My mother stood there, eyes widening in shock.

And I—

I hugged her.

I don’t know why I did it. It was like my body acted on its own, moving before I could stop it. She gasped softly, then her arms wrapped around me.

And suddenly, I was a kid again.

I was eight years old, running inside after scraping my knee. I was thirteen, standing in the kitchen at midnight, sneaking a snack after a nightmare. I was sixteen, sitting in silence after a fight, waiting for her to speak first.

And now, I was…here.

I felt small. I felt safe.

I felt real again.

I choked on something between a sob and a laugh. “*I—I’m sorry,*” I heard myself say.

She just squeezed me tighter.

I don’t know how long we stood there, but eventually, she pulled back, wiping at her eyes. “Come in,” she said softly. “Please.”

And I did.

We talked.

Not about everything—not yet. But enough. Enough that the weight on my chest finally loosened. I sat at that old kitchen table, the one covered in tiny scratches and faded coffee rings, and for the first time in years, I felt like I belonged there.

I left that night feeling lighter.

For the first time in a long time, I felt like maybe—just maybe—things could be okay again.

And I think that’s why I’m writing this.

Because I need you to understand.

I need you to see—

I was never supposed to win.

I should’ve known the second I felt safe.

The second I started thinking things would be okay.

Because now that I’m sitting here, typing this, I can feel it again. That pressure. That weight in the air. That cold, sinking sensation in my chest.

I—I keep pausing. Losing my train of thought. My fingers feel stiff. Wrong.

It’s so quiet in here.

Too quiet.

I just looked at my reflection in the laptop screen.

I shouldn’t have done that.

I need to finish this. I need to tell you before—

*Before what?*

*Why am I making such a big deal out of this?*

*I did what needed to be done. I made things right. That’s what matters.*

*I feel fine.*

*Better than fine.*

*In fact, I think this is the first time I’ve ever felt truly myself.*

*I just re-read everything I wrote, and honestly, I was being so dramatic. I mean, really—“I was never supposed to win”? Come on.*

*I did win.*

*And now, I get to move forward.*

*I get to have my family back.*

*I get to live.*

*It’s funny—reading this back, I don’t even remember him writing half of it.*

*But I guess it doesn’t really matter now.*

*Tomorrow, I’ll see my folks again. I’ll smile, I’ll say all the right things, and they’ll never even know the difference.*

*And after that?*

*Well…*

*You’ve been reading for a while now. Following along. Watching me change.*

*I wonder—how closely have you been watching yourself?*

As a real estate investor I do have a nice vehicle and assets more then people would at my age (24) not trying to showboat but figured this would be something to include in the post. I think she figured out I do pretty well with my vehicle and when she asked what I do for work. However, I don’t think the date went as well as I thought it would.  I picked up the girl and grabbed a quick to go coffee, talking along the drive found topics to talk about, we went to my friends families historical farm where there are a bunch of 200 year old homes and farm animals, we specifically went to see the horses as she likes farm animals/horses. It seemed like she really liked it but it rained today and I didn’t want to take her throughout the mud to see the rest of the animals like peacocks and other scenic stuff. I initially asked her out for tacos and she seemed like she was down. However she told me once we got there she wasn’t a fan of Mexican cuisine, and barely ate any of her food. I thought we would stay there for a while but the restaurant was very loud and I ended up asking for the check, I didn’t have anything else planned as it was 9 PM, she told me her favorite food was sushi.I ended up taking her back home and telling her I would like to get sushi with her, I mentioned it twice at first saying I felt bed that she didn’t like tacos and she kind of said your good no need for sushi and then the second time once dropping her off I said I had a great time and she said she did too and said she said would go out for sushi. However, the vibe felt off we are of same foreign ethnicity even though she came here 6-7 years ago while I’ve been here my entire life, we do relate to some stuff, but don’t share many hobbies or interests.

The sun is shining. The birds are chirping. We’re sitting on the patio of a dive bar I’ve taken over the touch tunes and in the background we’re listening to two old guys relive their glory days. One looks over and tells you your lady is “very pretty” you blush, I tell the gentleman that I’m not your lady. He takes this as an opportunity to cover my tab. He doesn’t know it covers us both - you’re welcome. After we finish off the 3rd pitcher of beer we ordered and make small talk with the bartender, I tell the old guy goodbye and we leave just in time to catch the hot dog cart outside. Since the tab was paid for us, I cover the dogs. I eat 3 and you stare in utter amazement how a girl so sweet and down to earth can guzzle a glizzy like that. I smile. We drunkenly kiss for a while and then we go our separate ways never to speak again. But every time you see a hot dog you think of me and that day we shared in late March. 

This could be us, but we probably don’t live in the same place, state, time zone or even country. So we have to settle for some quality Reddit chat and if more comes of it - beer and hotdogs are on me! 

If you’re thinking to yourself “this girls weird - I love it”, I will also have you know I’ve been known to yap so buckle up. My interests/hobbies include but are not limited to: 

•Being creative: crafting, writing, trying a new medium and leaving projects undone. So many projects undone. 

•Watching sports: preferably the NFL & MLB. I like the 49ers and the Giants. Because just like my taste in men, my sports teams on occasion are good, and then they’re really bad most of the time. I also recently went to an NHL impeccable vibes. Still no clue what was happening. 

•Weight Lifting: I’m a strong girl, my goal this year is to leg press 1,000lbs and maybe read up on power lifting. Right now it’s strength focused with that one goal of leg press. I’ve found everyone likes stats so:  I squat 400, I can’t really bench press anymore  due to a shoulder injury (but I try) and my dead lift varies on how much I drank the day before. 

•Coffee/Beer/Wine: More so the experience of consuming these things. Trying new coffee shops on the weekend, beer and corn hole with friends on a Sunday afternoon, a wine bar and tapas for a change of pace in the evening. If someone’s pouring I’m drinking. 

•Concerts/Shows/Live Music: I have been to 200+. I have tickets to quite a few already this year and will probably get more. I love music and I love discovering music. You’ll find me at my local record store at least 3x a month. I will take over a TouchTunes at any bar and I will always play RHCP whether it’s the vibe or not. 

Here is me: https://imgur.com/a/rlvsryH. 5’6. Thick. Again lifts weights. Eats hot dogs. Yada yada. Would also love to see a photo of you eventually. I can’t get you hot dog and beer if I don’t know who you are. Attraction needs to be mutual. If you are not confident enough to share a photo of yourself - we are not going to be a match. 

I don’t like video games or anime. You can have your hobby’s but these seem to be prevalent in a lot of people as personality traits. So hobby? Fine. Literally the only thing you do on the weekends? Not for me! 

I’m not looking for anything specific but if we can’t laugh together I don’t want it. I’m easy going and seeking someone who is as well. No pressure, no expectations. But keeping it SFW is preferred to start. Chat only, no messages. My age preference is 27-43ish. ",3,1743214786.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

My husband has been pretty supportive with my pregnancy sans the constant criticism on what i eat and what i drink. Today i just broke down and cried nonstop for 4 hours after waking up in the morning. I am 8 weeks pregnant. I take pre-natals, i dont eat a lot because of morning sickness. I dont drink coffee, alcohol, soda-very rare. I like iced cold water.

Breakfast was leftover pizza. I only eat the toppings because that’s what I can only tolerate. We argue over a slice because he doesnt want me to eat it since it’s spicy (it’s got sprinkle of chili flakes). He said it would cause me stomach upset. I know i have bad bloat when i eat too much that’s why i eat less. I told him i had one piece the other day and it was totally fine.

Until we argue about it , he got so mad because i wasnt listening to him when he only thinks of my wellbeing. I got so mad because i really want to eat that pizza. i ended up not eating at all when he threw the box of pizza in the table in front me and he said eat it all you want. i was too angry. he doesnt understand how hard it is to live with a million little things changing in my body right now. I was left crying the whole morning because i was so sad and upset. Now i have a headache and my tummy is cramping.

I was the maid of honor for my best friend Morgan (30F), but things turned sour as the wedding day came closer. The MoH duties were a lot to handle and I didn’t get along with the other bridesmaids.The only person I complained to was my boyfriend (40M) of 10 years- since he’s my safe space. On the day of Morgan’s wedding ,things didn't go as planned. Nothing was on time, the style of wedding was not to my taste, and I had to be on hand all day to help Morgan. I kept my feelings aside during the day, but my boyfriend made little comments here and there during the night. By the end of the night I couldn’t help, but to chime in from time to time too. At brunch the next day, my boyfriend and I ran in what we thought was a safe space, but one of our mutual friends Lucy overheard us and warned me that if I didn’t tell Morgan, they would. Anxiety got the best of me and I was too afraid to. Months later, I noticed Morgan distanced herself from me. I reached out a few times and didn’t hear back much-which was frustrating since I bent over backwards for her big day. Finally, I met up with Lucy to catch up at our local coffee shop- and guess who stopped by to order a coffee? Morgan. She said she was heartbroken to find out from multiple people that my boyfriend voiced his negative opinions during the wedding and reception. I was honest and admitted that my boyfriend did talk shit, but she continued to bring up how for years my boyfriend has hurt her- like- picking me up from the airport instead of him- because he was tired from gaming all day, and him saying rude things about other friends in front of her. She was concerned about losing the friendship, but she dealt with it. The wedding was the final straw and she couldn’t associate with us anymore- as if I am a reflection of my boyfriend?Lucy, who ended consoling Morgan, and not me, asked if I had anything else to say- and because I was shook- I said no. Lucy reminded me of the chance she gave me to come clean, and admitted all the opinions that my boyfriend and I ranted about post-wedding- including that I felt like Morgan wasted money and time planning the wedding, and that we could have a way better wedding if we wanted to. Which, I still think is true. Morgan kept asking what she did wrong, and why I felt that way- and my only real reason to this day is that I resent her shoving her happiness in my face for over 6 months of wedding planning. I apologized, but felt like I couldn’t really offer more than that. It ended with both of them telling me that they can never trust me again and that they can’t be associated with me- despite the fact we’ve been friends since high school. They’ve left me alone since, I blocked all of them, and everyone in the wedding party- for my peace of mind.

We rarely get together nowadays because she’s been busy and I never got to see her as this sort of ‘celebrity’ in public, so to speak.

Anyway, we were having coffee and a girl, who was like 10 or 11, recognized her; I think the girl’s mother was in the line to get their order and the girl came all by herself to our table. My friend was texting someone when she approached us, and the girl asked her if she could get a selfie. To my surprise my friend just kept texting, like, she didn’t acknowledge the girl at all!

I was a bit shocked to be honest, but I thought my friend could not have heard her because the girl didn’t speak loudly, in fact she appeared to be shy. So the girl was left standing there and there was this awkward pause, so I called my friend by her name and said: ‘This girl wants a picture’. And my friend indulged her request but seemed bothered to do so.

After the girl left, my friend turned to me and said something like: ‘don’t you ever put me on the spot like this again, if I wanted to take a selfie I would have answered her myself’. I couldn’t believe she was saying that. Then she went on to say how she didn’t even her make up done and didn’t want to be bothered.

I told her she could have answered the girl even if to say she couldn’t take a picture right now, how could she just ignore her? Then my friend said “You don’t understand”, and that was the end of it. AITA here?",7,1743214621.0,AmItheAsshole,41,0.62,False

You care about quality, details, and the craft. That’s why I want and value your opinion.

I’m working to build something that goes beyond just another coffee brand. My company, Eli Coffee Co., is built on obsessive attention to detail—everything from the drinks to the recipes, branding, packaging, photography, and the entire experience.
One of the biggest pillars of what I’m building is true quality ingredients. There’s a huge difference between real, carefully sourced ingredients and the artificial stuff most places use. Every drink I create is built on the best possible version of itself. If you care about coffee at the highest level, you get it.

Right now, I do everything myself. But I know there are others out there who think about coffee, design, and brand-building on the same level of obsession that I do.

I want to start something called The Eli Creative Board—a small, invite-only group of creatives who live and breathe this world. No one gets paid, but that’s not the point. This is about shaping something big in the coffee space.

Members of the board would get:
✅ Early access to all new products (drinks, drinkware, packaging, etc.)
✅ Their ideas credited on social media (because great ideas deserve recognition)
✅ A direct role in shaping a brand that’s aiming to be a global movement

Here’s my question for you all:
➡️ Where would you put something like this out?
I have 400,000+ followers on TikTok, but a post like this wouldn’t get much reach. Followers on TikTok honestly don’t mean much when you’re looking for the right people.

Would you post in niche coffee forums? Design communities? Some underground coffee geek space I haven’t thought of? Where would you look for the kind of people who care about coffee and branding at an obsessive level?

I was the maid of honor for my best friend Morgan (30F), but things turned sour as the wedding day came closer. The MoH duties were a lot to handle and I didn’t get along with the other bridesmaids.The only person I complained to was my boyfriend (40M) of 10 years- since he’s my safe space. On the day of Morgan’s wedding ,things didn't go as planned. Nothing was on time, the style of wedding was not to my taste, and I had to be on hand all day to help Morgan. I kept my feelings aside during the day, but my boyfriend made little comments here and there during the night. By the end of the night I couldn’t help, but to chime in from time to time too. At brunch the next day, my boyfriend and I ran in what we thought was a safe space, but one of our mutual friends Lucy overheard us and warned me that if I didn’t tell Morgan, they would. Anxiety got the best of me and I was too afraid to. Months later, I noticed Morgan distanced herself from me. I reached out a few times and didn’t hear back much-which was frustrating since I bent over backwards for her big day. Finally, I met up with Lucy to catch up at our local coffee shop- and guess who stopped by to order a coffee? Morgan. She said she was heartbroken to find out from multiple people that my boyfriend voiced his negative opinions during the wedding and reception. I was honest and admitted that my boyfriend did talk shit, but she continued to bring up how for years my boyfriend has hurt her- like- picking me up from the airport instead of him- because he was tired from gaming all day, and him saying rude things about other friends in front of her. She was concerned about losing the friendship, but she dealt with it. The wedding was the final straw and she couldn’t associate with us anymore- as if I am a reflection of my boyfriend?Lucy, who ended consoling Morgan, and not me, asked if I had anything else to say- and because I was shook- I said no. Lucy reminded me of the chance she gave me to come clean, and admitted all the opinions that my boyfriend and I ranted about post-wedding- including that I felt like Morgan wasted money and time planning the wedding, and that we could have a way better wedding if we wanted to. Which, I still think is true. Morgan kept asking what she did wrong, and why I felt that way- and my only real reason to this day is that I resent her shoving her happiness in my face for over 6 months of wedding planning. I apologized, but felt like I couldn’t really offer more than that. It ended with both of them telling me that they can never trust me again and that they can’t be associated with me- despite the fact we’ve been friends since high school. They’ve left me alone since, I blocked all of them, and everyone in the wedding party- for my peace of mind.

George dates a woman for her Costco membership. Kramer carries mugs everywhere because all cups should have handles.

He brings his stuff to Jerrys trying to finish it all but throws it out at Jerrys instead, so Jerry will have 6 bananas in his trash can.

Jerry's GF keeps finding bulk food items in his trash and judges him more and more when he orders tuna sandwiches twice in a row.

Kramer thinks the cardboard sleeve on coffee cups is useless and starts carrying a mug. His personal mug:

A) has a funny picture of snoopy

B) has a handle so temperature is irrelevant 

C) has the exact amount of coffee he wants so he isn't confused by Italian/french/vague sizes

His idea becomes popular and Peterman loves it. He abandons his duties and opens a bring your own cup coffee shop that just has the baristas eyeball how much they should charge.

It loses money. Elaine meanwhile is both stressed doing Petermans job while also being his right hand woman at the coffee shop

1jmbxpm,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1jmbxpm/hm_the_sausage/,[HM] the sausage,"   He sat at the kitchen table, 
his glassy eyes offering no indication of a single thought behind them. His first mistake, he realized, as the reality of his existence dawned upon him, was wearing only his briefs. 
   The plastic seat cushion- yellowing and scabby somehow managed (paradoxically) to both stick to the backs of his thighs and yet promote excessive sweating. 
   Without the luxury of even so much as a fan, each breath in as good as a mouthful of paste.
Everyone knows the air is thicker in August. 

   He sat slumped and slowly slipping off his horrible and only chair at a chipped and speckled vinyl table he had scavenged in the alleyway behind his 6 story walk up Chinatown apartment. 
   Before him- a styrofoam plate presents an extremely underwhelming sausage. 
He had battled his hangover well enough to prepare the aforementioned sausage with all the nuanced expertise of a complete idiot who has never seen a sausage. 

   He stifled a burp, its subsequence immediate regret preceding an expression of startled disgust.
Sighing heavily like the self pitying sad sack he was, he grabbed the charred atrocity like a prehistoric toddler and brought it to his mouth. 
   Ordinarily the smell of burnt meat and fat would have been enough to warrant a wobbly walk to the spew speckled porcelain, and he contemplated his farcical luck for having destroyed his nostrils last night. 
   He summoned the fortitude and took a labored bite. 
His mouth, bitter from coke and cigarettes and desperately dry, filled with warm salty fat, the meat may have been overcooked, sure, but the fat swirled around it in his cheeks as he chewed. 
He felt his surroundings start to solidify around him, their ceaseless swaying seemed to settle in to familiar form. 
He swallowed with some difficulty, the unfortunate lump of masticated ears and assholes scraping its way down his damaged throat. 
He took another bite and once more the world began to take shape. 
His eyes focusing, his mind creaking into operation.
The prospect of his day grew less daunting with every bite. 
   If he puts the coffee on and takes a 4 minute shower, he'd have 6 minutes to drink it while he got dressed for work. 
He finished his sausage and scooted his chair back across the linoleum, breathing a sigh of modest satisfaction and mild relief. 

   It doesn't always have to be much, so long as it's enough.
Never underestimate the power of a sausage.  
Even if it's burnt. 

   A footnote:
I've come up short. I don't have the 84 words in me, nor do I value my ""narrative"" enough to diligently find each a home. 
The story is comfortable, and so the only context seemingly suitable to place such precious prose - a post script. 
   I cower, bewildered by the shadow of eighty four inconceivable words. 
I smirk in impish defiance of the fifteen left to go. 

Im glad I'm not smart.
The fool is unencumbered.
Free to sleep deeply.

I don't see tons of discussion. I'm enjoying the music links but I would really love to know who everyone's favorite bands that are playing Rocksteady these days. I'm in the USA but am into bands from across the globe.

The Bandulus and The Steady 45's both released albums in 2024 (Tell It Like It Is and Swing & Sway, respectively).  Both of these US bands absolutely nail the Rocksteady sound as far as I'm concerned.

The Magnetics (Italy) also released an album in 2024 (Skangre Latino). This album is mostly songs from their other albums en espanol.  Their rocksteady really shines through on some of their other releases; Coffee & Sugar and Cocktails & Fairytales.  This is one of my very favorite bands going right now.  Extremely excited to see them at Supernova Ska Fest in September.

On days he's not in the coffee shop, because he promised me we would call and play games, he goes to the moskee, prays and then still get home late. Around 11pm my time and 10pm his time. 

Today he promised he would be back at 11pm my time, maybe maximum 15 minutes late (his words). I told him 'So if you are more than 15 minutes late I'm allowed to choose to not speak to you anymore and you won't be mad?' I tried to warn him that actions have consequences. 
He was late. He was done in the moskee at 10:40ish and got home at 11:30. He called 3 times and I declined the call, because I warned him. You can say 'It's just 30 minutes you're so dramatic' but this happens as good as every time we agree to call. 
This and last week we called for about 5 hours in total. 
I expressed my frustration last week again while crying and he said he would change, but here we are. 
He keeps saying 'You need to change.' It just makes me think he really doesn't think he does anything wrong. 
I asked to call and talk about our issues multiple times, but he declined. Tomorrow he will probably go to the coffee shop again and can't promise me we can talk before that. 

Do I break up with him at the end of the day tomorrow and see what happens or not even give him a chance to talk and break it off the moment he wakes up? ",1,1743212610.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

I inherited a Philips 1200 Espresso Machine and I love it. 

But the coffee hopper sensor is not working anymore so sometimes it brews a coffee that's just water; and it doesn't tell us when it's empty. 

Im sure some fine coffee grinds are covering the sensor, but I can't see the sensor, and I don't know where it is. 

I looked in the manual and it doesn't say where.

Let me know if anyone knows how to fix this.

1jmbght,https://v.redd.it/efxnojth9jre1,SCX6 sounds like a Coffee Grinder.,"Ok, so I'm dealing with a frustrating grinding noise in my SCX6 and I'm looking for some advice. About a few so week ago, the truck took a hit to the curb pretty hard. Initially, I thought the damage might just be to the rear differential, but now I'm thinking it could be related to the center transfer case considering the hit was taken to the skid plate area as well. Since then, I've been hearing a noticeable grinding noise while driving.

I initially suspected the gear mesh, especially since all the stock gears are metal. I figured it was unlikely to be broken teeth or warpage in gear pitch, as there's no plastic in the gear train. So, I disassembled the entire rear axle assembly, thinking the noise was coming from there. However, after running the car without the rear differential, I realized the grinding noise was actually originating from the central transfer case. The vibrations from the transfer case were traveling through the driveshaft and into the rear axle, misleading me.

Today, I took apart the transfer case itself. The gears inside looked fine, so I cleaned everything thoroughly and applied fresh lubricant to see if there was anytihng wrong inside. However, the grinding noise persists. I've narrowed it down to the area where the motor's spur gear connects to the transfer case. I noticed the transfer case gear has a slight wobble. And as I hut the throttle, it walks. This makes me believe that the housing might be damaged from the impact. I think the plastic part of the housing might be broken.

At this point, I'm considering buying a new transfer case housing. Before I do, I wanted to get your opinions. Has anyone experienced a similar issue? Do you think replacing the housing is the right move, or could there be other potential causes I'm overlooking? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

On that note, the video is meshed into one. The first shows the noise from the transfer case before disassembly. The second video displays the gear mesh issue I was talking about.",1,1743212431.0,rccars,0,1.0,False
1jmbg7q,https://www.reddit.com/r/IRS/comments/1jmbg7q/irs_schedule_c_audit_concerns/,IRS Schedule C Audit Concerns:,"On a return I helped a friend file, they have a schedule c photography business where they essentially broke even in 2021/2022, but had losses on in it 2020 and 2023 respectively, of about 6k in 2020 and 12k in 2023.

I think there is a more than sound argument if audited that they materially participated in the business. They have over 500 hours in it a year, they have invested 20,000 dollars in prints and inventory (shown as inventory in the cost of goods sold section on the schedule c not being deducted yet), they have a website to purchase prints, a social media page for marketing, have had their art displayed in coffee shops to purchase, and they attend 2-3 art bazaars a year with booths.

And the photographs are great, they just haven’t had any luck, hence the expenses and fairly consistent losses.

My fear is the IRS auditing it and coming back and saying it is a hobby and disallowing the losses. I already calculated the impact, and if they fully disallowed the losses it would result in about 2.5k additional tax owed in 2020 and 2.5k in 2023.

For some reason my irrational brain is freaking out they they would try and prosecute over this, but I know that’s extremely unlikely. And they are all valid deductions with support, nothing was “fraudulent” or made up. But maybe if someone could advice based on the scenario above, would greatly appreciate.

1jmbckd,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1jmbckd/she_25f_went_out_with_another_guy_after_dating_me/,"She (25F) went out with another guy after dating me (26M) for 2 months, and I can't see her the same way. Is it time to leave?","I began seeing someone who I felt enthusiastic about despite noticing a number of what I'd consider ""red flags"": an admitted promiscuous past, a currently untreated disorder leading to a prolonged recent episode, and a couple of whirlwind affairs with men almost twice her age who used and discarded her. I chose to overlook what I would otherwise consider signs of major incompatibility due to her seeming honest and very much into me. I should add that she is an intelligent person with interesting views, and is seemingly capable of great warmth.

The first couple of months felt wonderful: she'd text and call all the time, we were rarely apart for long, and I began to get to know someone who I felt, despite her troubles, could be a good person and a good, and interested, candidate for my first ""real"" relationship. We slept together often, falling asleep in one another's arms, with her telling me how much she really liked me and felt lucky to know me.

One morning, after she'd stayed the night, we were beginning to become intimate, when she abruptly decided to leave. She claimed she felt overwhelmed with assignments in her grad program, a reason I regarded with suspicion, since it contradicted a statement made that very same morning.

It came out a couple of weeks later that the real reason she'd left is because a guy she met at a party months before DMed her asking her on a date. According to her she ""barely remembered he existed"" despite his ""replying to \[her Instagram\] story every now and then,"" but decided to go out with him because ""he is good looking"" and ""I figured 'what the heck?'""

She volunteered all this info after she told me she felt jealous of my many female friends, some of whom have always been Platonic and some of whom are past dates, ""despite having no basis"" for lodging a complaint, and I subsequently resurfaced the conversation about seeing others that we'd already had about a month and a half before, during which time we'd both answered in the negative. She told me matter-of-factly about this date.

She could no doubt tell I was stunned, hence the succession of comments minimizing it - ""You're much funnier,"" ""it all came together last minute,"" ""the vibe wasn't it,"" ""it was too casual and felt like a networking meeting,"" ""it was just a coffee,"" etc. She excused herself by saying ""I thought you'd be nonchalant about this"" and ""we didn't discuss exclusivity, now did we?""

She told me ""nothing happened,"" that ""he was a one-off,"" and that she'd ""be open"" to seeing me only, and said ""I should have told you,"" but my perception of her was irrevocably changed. My levels of affection for and happiness with her haven't returned to baseline since.

Would you agree that if her words about finding me special were true, she never would have entertained another guy's advances? Would you agree that because she deliberately mislead me as to why she was leaving my place earlier than expected, and never brought up that she was looking to date/sleep around, she is untrustworthy?",0,1743212083.0,relationship_advice,9,0.33,False
1jmbb8l,https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/1jmbb8l/advice_for_an_unfortunate_roommate_situation/,Advice for an unfortunate roommate situation.,"Im a graduate student at an American University who moved into a two bedroom apartment with one other roommate (who is also a graduate student in a different department) about 8 months ago. My roommate lived here previously with another guy who moved out abruptly and seemed to also have disagreements with my current roommate. We initially tried to hang out a little bit but it became clear we really didn't have anything in common. The arrangement has mostly been fine, my roommate has definitely always been very fastidious but the rent and location are great and up until recently, we mostly just left each other alone. He insists on deep cleaning the apartment once a week and he takes his portion of that cleaning super seriously, I truly think it relaxes him and that's all well and good. Even though its not my style, and I would prefer to clean a little less frequently, I was down to clean on his schedule to be facilitating. Every Sunday the kitchen is scrubbed (he has specialty microfiber clothes he uses to clean the tile floors by hand), every surface is sanitized, the bathroom is mopped and the carpets are vacuumed. I have alternated tasks with him every weekend I have been here for the past eight months and I try very VERY hard not to leave a mess.

The problem is, I have ADHD, which I am medicated for, but still experience notable inattentive symptoms from time to time. I told him I had ADHD right when I first moved in which he acknowledged. Every two months or so, I will get an annoyed text from him saying something along the lines of ""Hey you missed a spot cleaning the bathroom, there is still some dust in the corner"" or ""I can see you cooked something, there is some oil residue on the stove"". Before Christmas break he took to time to yell at me for forgetting to check the oven before preheating it because his dirty pots and pans were in there. This was the second time I had forgotten to check, the first being several months earlier. I was taken a back by the way he said it too: ""This is the second time I told you, I won't be telling you again"". Here I will fully admit to my mistake in this situation, I was far too conflict avoidant and I didn't explain that the tone he was using felt demeaning and condescending. (not to mention strange! like you won't be telling me again??? ok then don't I guess?!) In hindsight I'm not sure this would have changed anything but just to cover my own bases I should have mentioned how I didn't appreciate being talked down to. However, every time I have forgotten to clean something or left something - again maybe half a dozen times the entire time I've lived here and many of them are incredibly minute (a couple hairs on the bathroom floor, a single drop of coffee on the counter etc...) - I have 1) profusely apologized, 2) cleaned it up right away, and 3) tried to explain that it was not an intentional slight and I sometimes forget things.

The current issue began a couple days ago when I got another one of these texts, angrier than before stating ver·ba·tim: ""Hey man I know I'm being peek, but I don't know how many times I have already told you this, when you cook something just clean up after yourself. This will be the last time ill clean the stove for you"" and attaching perhaps the most frustrating photo anyone has ever received in their life: A picture of a shining white stove top with one singular visible droplet of cooking oil so small it barely showed up on the camera...

BTW: I have actually kept track of how many times he has complained about this particular issue. It is twice. He has complained twice about oil on the stove.

Regardless, despite seething on the inside I responded by yet again telling him that it was not intentional, that I have ADHD and reminding like this does not help reduce my symptoms and that I will always clean up a ""mess"" as soon as I notice it is there. I also told him if it bothers him he is free to clean it up but he **under no circumstances** has to. I thought this was reasonable, as nothing he has pointed out has ever in any way impeded him from using the common spaces for their intended purposes and are at worst minor visual things, that are at most hours old.

He clearly has not understood, he just repeated himself that he has told me multiple times. He then stated that we needed to sit down and do an ""evaluation"". I at first thought this was sorta being lost in translation and he meant discussion or something, but not he would go on to describe it as ""...the type you get from your advisor every year, you should know it, you've already gotten one by now."" I was shocked by this, as we pay equal rent and have equal right to the space, he is not my boss or my parent obviously.

Additionally, he seems to have come to the odd conclusion that one small mess will snowball into total anarchy if it is not cleaned up immediately and he seems very irked that ""I never have to deal with things being left dirty when I use them"".

After a few more rounds of me repeating myself that there was no intentionality, and that I will continue to clean to his standards if he'd like, but that It was not realistic to expect me not to make occasional mistakes and that using a berating tone was not going to help me remember. And him continually saying we just needed to ""revisit expectations""; I told him I did not feel comfortable doing an ""evaluation"", instead he could book a meeting with a free neutral third party mediator and we could discuss this further or if he is openly willing to compromise with me and treat me like an adult and have a conversation as equals, that I would talk with him.

I synthesized all these thoughts into one final text and basically said that this was my final position: book a mediator, agree to having a conversation as equals, or simply stop sending me reminders and treating me like a disobedient child.

His final response as of yesterday, as if everything I said skimmed right off of him was ""Listen Im tired, I worked 12 hours, we do need to have an evaluation, we will do it Sunday"".

I will leave this off by saying yes I should have absolutely made it clearer earlier that his tone was rather rude. I was trying to give him the benefit of the doubt since English is not his first language. But it has become very clear that he is also making no tangible attempt to listen to me. It goes without saying that obviously he leaves messes sometimes too because no one is perfect, but I haven't brought any of them up and at this point it seems like that would do no good.

I have a feeling if I take part in this ""evaluation"", that I will simply be told all the things i've ever done wrong. We are both very busy people and it drives me crazy that it literally took more effort and energy to send an annoyed text than to take a paper towel and wipe the stove off.

Should I make it even clearer one final time that I will talk with him under the aforementioned circumstances? At this point if he responds poorly, I have no interest in staying and he can go about the trouble of finding someone to replace me on the lease. His last roommate also abruptly moved out, go figure. Its clear my roommate is probably stressed about other stuff but I don't think I've ever felt so deeply disrespected over something so miniscule.

Did I give him too much grace? Do you all have any advice on how to handle this? I am seriously uninterested in talking face to face with him after our text conversation if there is not an unbiased third party involved. Do you think if I ignore it he will just drop it? Should I just block his number and clean to my own hearts content? Realistically, If it bothers him so much, and he is so obsessed with the control of it all, he should really move out himself and find his own place. Perhaps I am wrong though, or there is something I missed. I appreciate you all, thank you for reading my rant.

EDIT: TL;DR: My roommate sends me condescending and demeaning messages about ""messes"" (single drops of oil on the stove or individual hairs on the bathroom floor) I leave around the apartment. I tried to explain that It wasn't intentional and I would clean as soon as I noticed a mess, but that sending demeaning messages wouldn't help me remember.

Ever feel like you've tried every productivity hack in the book, only to end up spiraling back into the chaotic abyss of missed deadlines and endless to-do lists? 😅 Yep, been there more times than I’d like to admit. Let’s talk about **time blocking**—the shining star of time management that's supposed to turn us all into super-organized productivity machines. But if you’re anything like me, maybe it just… didn't?

**Insert frustrated screams here.**

Turns out, trying to plan every minute of my day brilliantly segued into an overwhelming mess. Here’s the good news—I stumbled upon a super simple *5-minute habit stack* that genuinely transformed my mental clarity **and** gifted me back 5 hours a week! Intrigued? Pull up a chair. ☕️

**What I Used to Do (and Why It Failed):**
- **Meticulously block out entire days** like I was plotting world domination. Spoiler: life isn’t that predictable.
- Freak out when one tiny hiccup (looking at you, random coffee spill) set my entire meticulously planned day into chaos.
- End each day in a swirl of guilt because surprise, surprise—things didn’t go as planned.

**Enter: The 5-Minute Habit Stack.**

**1. **First Thing AM Clarity Boogie:** I'm talking **5 minutes** of reflecting—yep, just chilling and letting my brain wander with a cuppa joe. What’s the feeling for today? Which top 3 things will make me feel like a rockstar by day’s end?

**2. **Midday Pulse-Check:** Literally just asking myself, ""Hey, how’s it going?"" No need to jot stuff down. It’s all about those gut-check vibes.**

**3. **Pre-Snooze Note & Glow:** Scribble (or type) down a quick win or lesson from today while I sip some chamomile. Surprisingly reflective and soothing.

**Sound simple enough?** It totally is.

So, what’s the magic in these teeny little tweaks? It’s all about shifting focus from rigid scheduling to flexible prioritizing. I promise, this transformed how I tackled daily chaos. Our brains, like our lives, don’t follow perfect blueprints. They’re whimsical, a bit wild, and occasionally caffeinated.

I (16M) met this girl (15F), let’s call her M, at the start of this school year during auditions for a play. I’m a junior, she’s a freshman, and we didn’t get close until she started doing my makeup before shows. She immediately caught my eye. She has long dyed red hair, gothic style, and a confidence that makes her stand out in any room. She’s insanely talented (acting, dancing, sewing—you name it), and she knows it.

While doing my makeup, she’d talk about her older brother and shows she loved. We hit it off, started hanging out more, and I realized I really liked her. She’d call me cutie and other various nicknames, and at one point, we were at a fast food place with friends when she looked up at me and fluttered her lashes. I thought it was a sign that she liked me but I wanst sure. 

Later, at a sleepover, she put on Lisa Frankenstein, and we joked about being like Lisa and the monster. I put my arm around her, and she started kissing my hand, which I didn’t even notice until she pointed it out. Then, she said, “I love you,” and I could tell she regretted it instantly. I told her not to, admitted I liked her too, and we ended up kissing and cuddling the rest of the night. But something felt off.

That night, I couldn’t sleep. I kept thinking about how I wasn’t good enough for her, how my mental health would weigh her down, and how it just wasn’t the right time. I didn’t say anything right away because I struggle with communicating my feelings. A few days later, I called her to explain, but I was so anxious I wrote everything down in my notes app. Mid-call, my phone accidentally shared the note with her!!! Seeing her face drop was the worst feeling ever. She said she needed time to process, and I gave her space.

For the next few weeks, we barely talked, and it hurt so much seeing her in the hallway and not being able to say anything. Eventually, she texted me to meet up at a coffee shop. she told me she really loved and cared about me. I told her I felt the same but didn’t want to be with her because of my mental health. I knew she’d been in bad situationships before, and I didn’t want to put her through that again.

Fast forward a month, and she started flirting again. At the last show for our latest production, we both ended up at a cast sleepover. She cuddled up next to me, and I played with her hair the whole night, even trying to braid it (badly). It felt so natural, but we haven’t talked about it since.

Now, she’s distant again, and I don’t know what to do. My mental health is still in a weird place, and she deserves someone stable. But I also really care about her. Should I just let her go or try to fix things? 


Edit: I have posted this on other subreddits because I desperately need advice. Nobody in my life has been in a situation similar to this other than my situation-ship. Idk, should I reiderate my feelings about my mental health? How do I communicate with her after what went down at the sleepover? Should I do anything at all?

On February 10, 2021, I contacted Pastor O. by phone to request a meeting. I met with him around 3 PM later that day. The purpose of our meeting was to seek permission to speak at church on Sunday. Before making my request, I asked Pastor O. if he would join me in a brief prayer. He agreed, and together we prayed for God to grant me the right words to say and for Pastor O. to have understanding of my message. The first thing I asked Pastor O. was to share about the life of Jesus. He spoke about Christ's experiences, and then I began to share certain aspects of my life that mirrored those experiences. I recounted my recent trip to Washington, D.C., and how I believed that my interactions with the U.S. Capitol Police and plainclothes federal agents during that trip led to me being followed by federal vehicles. Reason: Improved clarity, corrected punctuation, and enhanced vocabulary for better readability.

After sharing many of my life experiences with Pastor O. and discussing the parallels I saw between my current circumstances and those in Christ's life, he boldly stated, am not the Messiah. At the time, I agreed with him, acknowledging that I was not the Messiah, but I believed that God had guided me to contact him for a purpose I did not yet understand. However, I did recognize one thing: God wanted me to speak in church. Although I was uncertain about what God wanted me to say, I had my suspicions. When I asked Pastor O. for permission to an announcement during the following Sunday’s service, he firmly told me, went on to explain that only those ordained by the church, like himself, were permitted to speak in church, and I was not by the church.

Pastor O. falsely claims that the purpose of my request was to “gather people around my cause.” I never disclosed to Pastor O. why I wanted to speak at church or what I might say if he had granted me permission. His assertion regarding the reason and purpose behind my request is presumptuous and speculative. Pastor O. further stated that he believed what I was telling him was “delusional,” and he repeatedly used my name throughout our conversation. This does not accurately reflect our discussion. On several occasions, he told me that “I was not the Messiah,” despite the fact that I never claimed to be one. I merely compared my life to Christ's, which seemed to prompt him to keep reminding me that “I was not the Messiah.” At one point, I confirmed to him that I am “Me” (my name) when he asked if I thought I was the “Messiah.”

After it became clear that he was not going to grant me permission to speak, I made an excuse to end the meeting. He then asked if he could lead us in prayer before I left. I accepted his offer, and he prayed for both of us. As I became painfully aware that Pastor O. was determined not to allow me to speak in church, I started to feel emotional during our prayer. However, my emotions were not solely due to his refusal. His denial of my request meant that I would have to speak in church against his wishes, despite his explicit or This realization of the implications of his refusal led me to understand that God wanted me to interrupt the church service to speak. This was something I truly did not want to do, but I recognized that I had to. I was on the verge of tears because his refusal would result in my interruption, and I did not want to cause discomfort to him, the church members, or face any backlash that might arise from my actions. I was fully aware of this before leaving his office. Therefore, when Pastor O. stated, probably won’t see me again, far from the truth I already understood. I would never make such definitive statements when I knew I would be seeing him again in just a few days at the upcoming Sunday service.

 

**Sunday 14 February 2021 Church Incident:**

When Sunday arrived, I reached the church late and caught the tail end of the service preceding the 10:30 Contemporary service. At that moment, I still wasn’t entirely sure what God wanted me to convey in church; I only knew that He wanted me to be there for a purpose. As the service concluded, I walked in late to find the pastors conducting a live baptism, and I certainly didn’t want to interrupt such a significant event to share something I was still uncertain about. After the service ended, I left the church to grab a coffee, intending to return and wait for the Contemporary service. Upon my return, I arrived early and found the choir practicing their songs near the front. I took a seat on one of the pews lining the back wall and listened to their harmonious melodies.

After they finished practicing their songs and began conversing among themselves, I approached their group and asked if it would be alright for me to approach the altar to silently pray for a moment. They assured me it was fine and gradually returned to their conversation, glancing at me from the corners of their eyes as I prayed quietly. While seated in the back, listening to their practice, I still wasn’t entirely sure what God wanted me to express in church during my “interruption” of speech. My awareness that I was meant to say something, yet uncertain about what it should be, prompted me to pray at the altar for guidance and understanding regarding what I believed God was asking of me. So, I prayed for insight into why God wanted me in church that day. I sought clarity and direction regarding my feelings of compulsion to be there.

In Pastor O.'s written statement, he asserts that my interruption occurred in the 10:30 contemporary service; however, this is simply not true. I arrived late to the previous service and only caught the tail end before witnessing the baptism. The moment I interrupted the church service coincided with the same concluding parts I had heard just an hour earlier. I was genuinely curious about the overall message of that day's service. Initially, I sat quietly and listened out of curiosity, but I would be lying if I said that procrastination and my reluctance to interrupt the service did not contribute to my decision to speak up at the end of the service, rather than as Pastor O. falsely claims.

That particular day in church was one of those days that held a significance beyond the usual experience of a typical service. This was due to the nature of the day and the symbolic meaning of the service, which reflected the theme of robes in honor of the Transfiguration, a day directly linked to a pivotal moment in the life of Jesus, symbolized by the white garments they wore. As I listened to the message being delivered and the pastor's sermon, I began to understand what God wanted me to convey despite my interruption of the service. This day was not only religiously significant because of the white robes, but it also coincided with Valentine's Day.

When we reached the point in the service where I began to hear the familiar ending, I felt an overwhelming urge and sense wash over me. This feeling was my intuition urging me, “You’re running out of time,” and “If you’re going to do it, now is the time before he stops speaking and concludes the service.” As this sensation enveloped me and these thoughts raced through my mind, I heard the pastor recite a well-known phrase that every churchgoer has heard countless times before: “Forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us.” Upon hearing that phrase, I recognized it as my cue from God, and while seated, I boldly proclaimed, “Forgive me.” I paused for a brief moment after the second word, as the church fell silent in response to my declaration, creating an uncomfortable feeling that washed over me. After that fleeting pause, I completed my statement: “Forgive me, for I am about to trespass.”

Pastor O. rose from the front pew and acknowledged the preaching pastor, indicating that he had the situation under control. After this brief interaction, he turned and walked down the aisle toward me. As he approached, I stood up from my seat and stepped into the aisle, preparing for the confrontation I had provoked with my earlier statement. When Pastor O. reached me, he attempted to turn me around and guide me to the back of the church for a discussion. As he did this, he encouraged me to start moving in that direction with a phrase like, “Let’s go…” Given our conversation just days earlier, my interruption likely came as no surprise to him, and he understood my intentions behind my initial remark. I attempted to respond to his request to accompany him to the back of the church by saying, “I just want to share my love with everyone.” This statement was heavily influenced by the fact that it was Valentine’s Day, a day dedicated to expressing love and affection for those closest to us.

Pastor O. seemed to disregard my petition to share my love with the church, which likely stemmed more from a panicked reaction to his request for me to leave with him than from any genuine desire to express my feelings and words to those present. After I made this statement, he made several attempts to coerce me into following him out of the church, lightly trying to shift my body in that direction. At this point, my only responses to Pastor O.'s requests were met with the same reply I received when I asked for permission to speak at church: Every request and attempt to persuade me to leave the church with him was met with my firm response of I was neither loud nor forceful in my replies; I simply remained quietly defiant, offering soft-spoken answers in the form of

The back-and-forth between his requests and my refusal to comply did not last long, but it felt longer than it actually was. Once Pastor O. recognized the extent of my peaceful defiance against his requests for me to leave with him, he altered his approach. He threatened to call the police if I did not leave with him immediately. I simply shrugged my shoulders and told him, then turned his attention to one of the people gathering around us and instructed him to call the police. After directing another member to make the call, Pastor O. reverted to his original strategy, attempting to persuade me to follow him outside. I continued to refuse his request, responding with a firm again. This exchange occurred a couple of times before Pastor O. tried a different tactic to get me to leave with him. He suggested that if I did not leave voluntarily, carry me out of the church. shrugged my shoulders again and replied, to his threats of forcibly removing me by picking me up. Without hesitation, Pastor O. scooped me up over his shoulder and began walking us both out of the church.

As I was being carried out of the church, the only way to accurately describe the profound feeling I experienced after he lifted me up. In that moment, I made one final declaration on my way out. I expressed what I came to understand was God's message for me and why I was led to church on that particular day. I had not known what God wanted me to say until I prayed for guidance at the altar and received the answer I sought during the service's message that day.

As I was being carried and felt the Holy Spirit wash over me, I shouted, “I AM the Second F’in Coming.” This statement encapsulates the absolute truth behind the interruption I caused at church, the words I spoke, and the words that were spoken to me. In Pastor O’s written statement, he makes several inaccurate claims regarding what I said and the timing of the contemporary service I interrupted. He asserts that some of my initial statements to him or to the church members at large were “Fuck This” and “Fuck That.” These claims are far from the truth of what actually occurred. During my interruption, I did not tell Pastor O that “God had told me to speak.” That conversational context is based on our previous private discussion, where I implied that God wanted me to speak, but I did not utter those words at the time of the interruption. Pastor O also wrongfully attributed his threats against me—such as “calling the cops” and “I’m not leaving unless someone carries me out of here”—as if I had spoken those words to him. The truth is, those were his ideas and his words directed at me, and my only response was a shrug of my shoulders along with a verbal reply to his threats of, “go ahead.” Why would I suggest calling the cops? Why would I imply that the only way I would leave is if “someone carried me out” of there? This pattern of individuals projecting their words onto me and then reporting those words as if I had spoken them is recurring throughout many other interactions and conversations I’ve had with military recruiters. It’s a classic case of projection, and it attempts to portray me as far more menacing and unhinged than the reality of the experience reflects. Reason: Improved clarity, vocabulary, and grammatical accuracy while maintaining the original meaning.

Once we stepped outside the church, Pastor O set me down, and we began a “heated” face-to-face conversation. To describe it as a “vigorous” dispute would not accurately represent the experience we had outside the church. Our “dispute,” which felt more like a passionate conversation, arose because I had created a problem for Pastor O, compelling him to react as he did. The intensity he projected at me now that we were outside, away from the gaze of most Sunday church attendees, was palpable. This energy was mirrored by me, largely due to the “Holy Spirit” that had just washed over me and was still very present. Once we were outside and Pastor O revealed his true self to me, I could see a great deal of anger and fury in his eyes as he focused intently on mine.

I can clearly recall the key parts of our conversation, but I do not remember the order of who spoke first once we were outside. I remember being carried out into the frigid weather without my coat, which had been left on the pew inside. At the time, I didn’t notice the cold because of the adrenaline that people often experience in such circumstances. I recall someone—possibly Pastor O. or one of the few others who followed us out—asking another member to retrieve my coat due to the biting cold. They quickly brought my coat while Pastor O. and I continued our conversation outside.

I remember the fire, anger, and fury in Pastor O's eyes during our heated conversation. I recall a comment he made about my coat, and I eventually slipped it on when he handed it to me. I asked Pastor O a specific question: “What is the one thing in this world that everyone seeks, whether they know it or not?” He seemed slightly disarmed by my question, and after a moment's thought, he responded, “Forgiveness.” I told him he was wrong; it is “love” that everyone seeks, whether they realize it or not. I then asked him, “Can you truly forgive someone without love in your heart for them?” He didn’t answer and simply stared at me with his angry eyes. I continued by stating that his “book” is based on flawed values and filled with lies.

I remember proudly declaring with conviction that “I am God's ONLY Soldier.” I did not refer to Pastor O as “God's Representative,” although he might have used the term “representative” instead of “soldier.” While both descriptions are accurate, the latter better reflects my perception of my servitude to God. I consider myself a loyal and faithful servant of God, but I have never fully embraced the notion of servitude. I am not one to blindly submit myself to servitude for anyone, not even God. The Bible warns of the dangers that can arise from blind servitude without questioning. I am loyal and deeply faithful, with strong convictions underpinning my spiritual beliefs. However, to me, it is a spiritual faith, not a religious one. There is a significant difference between the two, which is why I do not fit into any confined religious categories. Yet, my faith can be found in all other belief systems.

After those questions and comments, I spoke to Pastor O. Before the police arrived, I shared one last thought with him. I said something like, “I hope you take the time to truly reflect on this moment and try to understand why it was God's will for this to happen.” My intention was to encourage him to contemplate the events of the day, particularly in light of our conversation and my interruption. I emphasized the importance of self-reflection to grasp the underlying lesson and to understand why God desired this outcome, rather than attributing it to me. Although I don’t recall the exact words I used, I am certain that this was the message I ultimately conveyed to Pastor O.

This interaction with Pastor O. outside the church lasted no more than a couple of minutes, as the police department was located less than 500 yards away. As soon as I observed what I had been waiting for, I abruptly ended our conversation and walked toward the officer's car that had just arrived. The only true that occurred between Pastor O. and me was a light poke to his chest. As I approached the police officer, he asked me to step into the back of his car due to the freezing temperatures, which I gladly accepted. Inside the squad car, we discussed the incident, including my reasoning and explanation for what had transpired. A second officer went to speak with Pastor O. and the witnesses who had been present during our conversation.

Ultimately, Pastor O. did not wish to press any charges against me but requested that I leave the property and the area before the remaining members of the church departed. The officer I spoke with escorted me to my vehicle and ensured that I left the area with a wave goodbye.

**Wednesday 14 September 2022 Phone Contact:**

Once I reached the halfway point of my federal probationary term (six months) after being released from prison, I felt compelled to learn from my past rather than be defined by it for the rest of my life. This “compulsion” drove me to practice some of my core spiritual beliefs that reflect Christ's teachings. Simply put, I sought forgiveness for my past offenses against those I believed I had wronged. My search for forgiveness focused on two areas: with Pastor O. and the church, and with members of the armed forces recruiting center. My initial attempts to contact both entities began in September 2022.

For Pastor O, I initially attempted to contact him by phone because I understood that the last thing I should do is show up at the church on a random Sunday without addressing the past first. I realized that arriving unannounced could create further conflict and tension due to our previous incident, which I was trying to avoid. Almost everything in Pastor O’s written statement about that phone call is accurate, except for two parts. In his report, he claims that he informed me to “stay away from the campus and church” until he spoke with my probation officer about me. Both of these statements—suggesting that I need to stay off the property until he has spoken with my probation officer—are untrue. He never explicitly told me to “stay away” or “stay off the property.” We reached an agreement that he preferred I not return to church until he had spoken to my probation officer regarding the situation. He advised me not to attend church after I requested permission to quietly attend as a demonstration of my remorse and desire to repair the damage I had caused. Pastor O did not trust my intentions and instructed me not to come to church; however, he never mentioned anything about not visiting his office outside of church hours so that I could apologize to him directly for our heated conversation and confrontation the previous year. I firmly believe that all apologies should be offered in person. A great deal more is conveyed through an in-person apology compared to one given over the phone, where true personal interaction is lacking. Reason: Improved clarity, readability, and technical accuracy while correcting grammar, punctuation, and mechanics.

After my phone conversation with Pastor O., he contacted my federal probation officer after I provided the officer's information to him. In Pastor O.'s written statement, he claims that he left my probation officer a voicemail stating that “I had come to their campus when I wasn’t supposed to” and that he wanted to discuss it with him. I can only assume that his voicemail accurately reflects what he included in his written statement. However, what he conveyed in my probation officer’s voicemail is extremely misleading on multiple levels. First, he asserts that I had come to the campus property, which is simply untrue. I contacted him by phone; I did not attempt any in-person contact, as Pastor O. states in his statement. Secondly, he claims that “I wasn’t supposed to” show up on the campus property, which is inaccurate since I only called. There were no restrictions placed on me by anyone from that church indicating that I was prohibited from returning to their property. The way he characterized our phone conversation when recounting the interaction to my probation officer makes it seem as though I did something wrong, despite knowing I was not doing anything inappropriate. This portrayal makes me appear “hostile” or “highly confrontational,” when in reality, my intention was the opposite of how it was presented to someone in a position of power and authority over me. It distorts the events and my words to make me seem like someone I never intended to be. This pattern of misrepresentation has recurred in my later experiences with police and members of armed forces recruiting offices. There is a troubling trend of twisting my words into something they are not or distorting the facts surrounding events to suggest malicious or nefarious intent. This behavior reflects their own actions against my truths, projecting their own negative intentions onto me.

 

**Sunday 18 September 2022 Contact Attempt #1:**

The description of this event and attempted contact with Pastor O. is accurate.

**Monday 19 September 2022 Contact Attempt #2:**

Most of this description of my interaction with the staff is largely accurate, with two notable exceptions. First, the staff member who buzzed me into the building and spoke with me misattributes one of her own statements to me, as if I had said it instead of her. My statement regarding O. never returning my message is correct. Her response to my statement was, out of character, Pastor O.'s failure to get back to me. I could do nothing but accept her reasoning for why Pastor O. never returned my message. The words attributed to me in Pastor O.'s written statement were, for some reason, her words projected onto me. The other inaccuracy in this interaction, according to Pastor O.'s written statement, involves the additions made when I claimed I would contact Pastor O. set up a meeting.

This visit marks my third attempt to meet with Pastor O—my first being a direct phone call, followed by two in-person attempts to what does my overall conduct during these attempts reveal? What are my motivations and intentions for making the initial call and the subsequent in-person visits to Pastor O? My intentions are genuinely aimed at reconciling my past and seeking forgiveness from my so that I can attend church. Although my two in-person attempts occurred in rapid succession, which could easily be misinterpreted, the purpose of these visits was to apologize for my previous encounter with Pastor O, in accordance with my strong personal beliefs about how apologies should be conducted. My repeated visits and attempts to contact Pastor O in such a short timeframe may have understandably caused him concern. However, is that concern reasonably justified in relation to the actual nature of my actions and my legitimate intentions? I made several attempts to establish contact with my probation officer to confirm whether he had received Pastor O's call or if he had the opportunity to communicate with him after my initial conversation. Unfortunately, all my attempts to reach my probation officer went unanswered, and I never received a callback after leaving messages. I reached a point where I felt that if I wanted something accomplished, I was the only one willing or capable of doing it. Consequently, I took matters into my own hands and decided to continue returning until I had the opportunity to apologize to Pastor O in person. Reason: Improved clarity, readability, and technical accuracy while correcting grammar, punctuation, and mechanics.

**Tuesday 20 September 2022 Successful Contact:**

Pastor O was quite accurate in his recollection and recounting of my in-person visit with him and the other pastor of the church. However, there are a few inaccuracies in his account of this interaction. First, he claims that I was “hesitant” after being advised by Pastor O and the other pastor to be “patient” regarding my requests to attend church peacefully and silently. I did not “hesitate” in response to their request to remain “patient” while they conducted their “due diligence” in determining whether it was appropriate and safe to allow me back into the church. Additionally, I never referred to their choices and decisions as “unchristian.” On one occasion, just before our conversation concluded, I did tell Pastor O and the other pastor that the decisions they were making at that moment “were not very Christian,” but this was within the context of my reasoning and justification for both the opportunity to apologize in person to Pastor O and my petitions to be welcomed back into “God’s” house as a form of atonement and a gesture of peace. I demonstrated far more “Christian” behaviors, values, and fundamental principles of the faith in my actions toward them collectively. This first “discrepancy” is minor, yet it still conveys a truth, albeit not an accurately quoted one. Reason: Improved clarity, grammar, and vocabulary while maintaining the original meaning.

This next statement, according to Pastor O’s written account, is entirely fabricated and concocted by him. He claims that I “expressed some suggestion about speaking to people in church.” This is a complete falsehood; the true version of events clearly demonstrates that I expressed the exact opposite and made multiple attempts to convince them that I only wanted to attend silently and peacefully. My intention was to show Pastor O that I was telling the truth and to reassure the church members that I am not someone they should fear. Sitting through church services quietly and peacefully was the only way I could convey those feelings and intentions through my actions and behavior. Unfortunately, Pastor O denied this in response to my petitions, pleas, and attempts to apologize. Both pastors advised me to remain “patient” and assured me they would contact me soon after speaking with my Federal Probation Officer. They told me that they forgave me for my past offense against them, stating that “I was forgiven.” Sadly, the words they used to express their “forgiveness” felt as hollow as their regard for me as a person when they “granted me their forgiveness.”

The eventual response I received from Pastor O. and the church came in the form of a temporary restraining order (TRO) served to me by the county sheriff's office. Although I informed both pastors that I disagreed with the decisions they were making during our last meeting, I fully respected their wishes and remained as they requested. After that in-person contact, I felt I had accomplished my goal of apologizing to my according to my values and standards for apologies. Therefore, I had no legitimate reason to return to their location afterward. I intended to remain patient and wait for them to eventually respond to me. However, I was not expecting such a strong legal reaction to something that was fundamentally rooted in Christian behavior, values, and principles, as taught by Christ regarding how we should live and treat one another. I did not find their decision to pursue a TRO against me to be reasonably justified, nor did that reaction reflect even the slightest Christian behavior aligned with their core values.

I like to simplify the problem to one question: “What would Jesus have done in their position for a person like me approaching them with the purposes I shared truthfully?” He would not only have forgiven me, but he also would have hugged me and welcomed me back to church during the next service personally. He may have even sat with me or invited me to sit next to him throughout the service as a way of assuring the other church members that if he was okay with welcoming me back and accompanying me personally, they should have no reason to reject me. Sadly, many pastors and church officials talk the talk, but when presented with opportunities to walk the walk, many will inherently show how un-Christian a church-ordained pastor can be during those moments. The sad part is that a former member of their church returns, begging and pleading for forgiveness and the opportunity to hear God's message through readmittance into the church. Yet, the church denies a good Christian who is guilty of sin against them, regardless of the efforts and attempts to atone for those sins. Honestly, what right does any ordained pastor have to deny one of God's followers under those circumstances? As I mentioned, their initial decisions and choices spoken to my face were “not very Christian-like.” However, their actual reaction to my pleas and petitions is not just “unchristian”; it reflects the actions of a deceitful devil dressed in preacher's robes. The devil embodies deception at its core, and those who willfully and intentionally deceive others carry the devil with them everywhere they go.

**Wednesday 21 September 2022 Phone Contact with Police:**

This final section of Pastor O's written statement contains a wealth of information but includes only one significant falsehood within its brief paragraph. Did Pastor O contact the local police to report my visits and behavior? Of course, he did. I had an intuitive sense that this was almost certainly going to happen due to my visits and attempts to apologize. Anticipating that Pastor O might call the authorities to report my actions, I took the initiative to contact them myself. I wanted to personally explain the situation and clarify that I was not trying to be a problem. My intention was not to cause concern, nor should anyone perceive my actions as threatening or inappropriate.

In his written statement, Pastor O claims that Officer Hogan called him back later to say, “he called my number, and I picked up right away.” This assertion is fundamentally false. I was the one who called the department, and when Officer Hogan answered my call, he remarked on how he intended to call me regarding the situation at the church involving Pastor O. Hogan allowed me to explain my reasons for calling. At no point during my conversation with Hogan did he inform me that I was not permitted to return to the church. I had previously clarified with him that I had no intention of returning without first being contacted by Pastor O to confirm that I was allowed to do so.

It is not surprising to me that individuals in this particular situation contacted my probation officer to report my conduct, as if my actions were inappropriate or unjustifiable. Ultimately, the motivations behind their decision to involve my probation officer appear to stem from an attempt to exert authority over me in order to undermine and obstruct my religious beliefs and practices, which are protected under the First Amendment right to attend church services.",1,1743211224.0,u_VeiledTruths11,0,1.0,False

So I’ve been working as a Financial Analyst at this 60-person company for about 8 months. My boss, the Head of FP&A, was this super ambitious guy who automated a bunch of reports, found some tax refunds, and cut costs by basically making everyone use both sides of printer paper and turning off the heat after 3pm.

Last week, I overheard him arguing with the CEO about becoming CFO. He kept saying stuff like “I’ve transformed this company’s financial outlook!” while the CEO just looked confused and asked “Didn’t you just cancel our coffee service?”

Anyway, my boss quit on Friday. This morning, the CEO called me into his office and handed me a stack of folders labeled “FINANCE STUFF” and said, “You worked with him, right? So you know how to do all this?”

I tried explaining that my job was just updating spreadsheets my boss created, but the CEO cut me off saying, “Look, we’re not creating a new position just because your boss left. This is a great opportunity for you to show your value! If you save us $130k like he did, maybe we’ll talk titles in a year or two.”

I’m now apparently responsible for: tax filings, vendor negotiations, payroll oversight, cash flow management, investor reporting, and “finding more money in places we forgot about” (direct quote).

My salary is $58k. I have an associate’s degree in Marketing.

I also want to try making the chocolate by using cocoa nibs and cocoa butter. Tips on how to make a good chocolate for covering the alfajor is also appreciated. :)

We all moved around over the years and that changed our friendships, but we still found time to connect and see each other. I was the first one to have kids, and that was when I noticed a huge change. I wasn't invited to things anymore. I realized years later that they had a dinner club where they met monthly to eat at new restaurants and I was never invited. It really hurt me when I heard about this, but I wrote it off as, well they all live close ish to each other and I am an hour away and I have kids so that's why I wasn't included. It really hit me when I heard two of who I thought were my best friends were in my city visiting another friend for the weekend, I asked them to meet for coffee but they were too busy with their other friend and their plans. Again I wrote it off and didn't let it bother me. Well now a few of them have kids too, yet they all still make time for each other and travel an hour or so to make it happen. And I have been on the sidelines for 8 years now. I don't know why I keep trying but these are the only friends I have. I feel so resentful for being constn left out, then I wonder if I drove them away - I had a hard time with postpartum depression with my second child, then when covid happened I was working in a high stress situation and would often vent about it to them, then I had a mental breakdown and quit a career I loved and thought I'd have for life, went into severe depression about my future, picked myself back up, went to therapy and I'm now back in school pursuing a new career. Then my alcoholic inlaws went on a binge and my MIL died of liver failure and my FIL has alcohol induced brain damage. It felt like my life was a nonstop shitshow and my friends got sick of hearing about it. did I drive them away with my mess of a life? I do think I did. But then I wonder if the friendships fizzled out before my life became a mess. I find myself trying to rekindle these friendships lately, trying not to be a complainer and trying to be positive all the time so I don't scare them away, and it just isn't happening. I'm reaching out, making plans, going out of my way to visit these friends who live far and now have kids of their own. But it's not clicking and I feel so sad about it. I guess I just need some kind words, that maybe there are people out there I just haven't met yet. ",1,1743210986.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False

We briefly dated (3 months) and ended things when we realised it wasn’t working.   He wasn’t ready for a new relationship or at least for it to go public (widow with young kids) and I was looking for something more. I didn’t want to hang around and hope one day he would be ready and he wasn’t ready to be open about us. 

We did grow close in the 3 months though, daily video chats, texting constantly and phone calls when we could. We spoke about everything and anything and I guess built a friendship. 

When we agreed to end things we remained friends. We occasionally hang out, grab some food, coffee, drinks and talk on the phone here and there. I would say we are like best friends we vent and ask for advice etc. 

I told the guy I’m dating I was meeting this friend for lunch and couldn’t meet him until later. This had been planned weeks before I met the guy I’m dating. He asked how I knew him as he lives so far away and I explained. He said this wasn’t something he was sure he could handle. This lead onto the chat that being friends with an ex is wrong and that even saying hello to being an acquaintance with an ex is wrong.  This is the second time I was questioned about dealings with an ex (bumped into an exes daughter and we ended up getting food together). 

I don’t agree with this, I have no exes I wouldn’t say hello to or catch up with if I bumped into them and I guess their families too.  All mine ended amicably. He only has one serious ex and she hurt him pretty bad.

1jmaxnb,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/1jmaxnb/does_it_get_better/,Does it get better?,"I (21M) don’t know for certain that I have social anxiety but I feel like I might. I don’t mind taking myself out and I’m comfortable around friends I’ve known for awhile. I can strike up conversations with strangers when I’m in a good mood but there’s days where I just struggle to get a word out to someone because I don’t want them to judge me or think I’m stupid. It’s hard for me to open up to people about emotional topics and I feel like my recent breakup was partially because of that.

I’ve been trying to go out to eat on my own since I don’t have a lot of friends or people to talk to. I’ve gone to some bars about 40 minutes away because I don’t want to see anyone I already know. It just feels like everyone is staring at me the entire time and I feel weird eating or drinking anything. I still do it but I feel awkward. I try to be nice and polite to the bartenders but I feel like the way think I’m weird since they don’t strike up conversations with me and I don’t want to seem nosy if I ask them anything.

I went out a few weekends ago with some high school friends and we went barhopping. That was nice but I didn’t talk a whole lot since they were all talking to eachother. We were at one with a dance floor and we all went out there. I had a few drinks at that point and started moving around a little. A girl locked eyes with me, started singing the song, and trying to kind of dance with me. I felt really uncomfortable and just couldn’t keep eye contact with her. I felt weird and that I didn’t really want to dance anymore. 

I recently saw that a cafe about an hour away from my house has a solo board game league on Tuesday nights starting next week and I thought about signing up for it since I enjoy board games but have no one to play with. I went there tonight to kind of scope it out. I came up to it and decided to drive by it to go to a store and get groceries since I wasn’t sure where to park. I went back afterwards getting groceries and parked up the street. I felt weird walking down the street to go there. After ordering some coffee and food, I sat down and was on my phone for most of the time. I sat kind of near the duos league that were playing tonight to see how they do things but I felt like a creep. It was like every movement I made was making me look awkward and weird. I left shortly after I finished my food. 

On my way home, I started crying because I felt like I didn’t have anyone in my life and that I hate how I feel so awkward all the time. I don’t know if I’ll sign up for that league or not. I feel like I’m going to feel weird and not talk to anyone. I probably won’t know any of the games and won’t do good.

I just don’t want to feel like this anymore, whether it’s social anxiety or not

She said the voices (I just named them ""them"") mean well and are just over cautious, hence the fearful thoughts. ""Them"" do tell me not to trust others but they also say mean things, put me down, and tell me that my family doesn't love me. I know my family loves me and argue back. I don't think they are a force for good.

I have an appointment with my psychiatrist on Monday at 9:00 AM. Them are telling me not to take my meds saying they are poison, but I recognize I need to go and get medicated. I am afraid that she won't believe me because it's only been two weeks and I've turned into a pile of hot mess in such a short period of time. 

Is it possible to subconsciously be faking this?

1jmax47,https://www.reddit.com/r/alberta/comments/1jmax47/poilievre_vs_carney_whos_really_got_edmontons_back/,Poilievre vs. Carney: Who’s Really Got Edmonton’s Back?,"Edmontonians, let’s talk about how Pierre Poilievre’s policies could actually help us here in our city, compared to Mark Carney’s elite friendly ideas that’ll just keep screwing over the average person. We’re a working class town, oil and gas, small businesses, families trying to make ends meet. The Liberals keep promising to “protect us,” but all we’ve seen is higher costs and empty words. Poilievre’s got a plan that hits home for us, while Carney’s just Trudeau 2.0 with a fancier resume.

Here’s how Poilievre could make life better in Edmonton:

Scrapping the Carbon Tax
Poilievre wants to ditch the carbon tax, which jacks up gas prices at every pump on Jasper Ave or 97th Street. That’s less money spent filling up your truck for the commute to Nisku or heating your home through our brutal winters. For low income folks in Abbottsfield or Clareview, that’s real relief, not crumbs from Ottawa.

No GST on Home Heating
Ever seen your Enbridge bill spike in January? Poilievre’s plan to cut GST on home heating would save Edmonton families cash when we need it most. Our winters aren’t optional, why should we pay extra to not freeze?

Lower Income Taxes for the Little Guy
Poilievre’s pushing tax cuts for lower earners. That’s more money in the pockets of servers at Whyte Ave bars, warehouse workers in the northwest, or single parents in Mill Woods. Meanwhile, the Liberals keep taxing us to death.

Fighting Inflation with Spending Cuts
Poilievre says less government waste means lower inflation. That’s huge for Edmonton, grocery bills at the Westmount Safeway or rent in Oliver are out of control. Carney? He’d keep spending like Trudeau, making it worse.

Less Tax Burden Through Smarter Spending
Trimming Ottawa’s fat could mean lower taxes overall. Imagine keeping more of your paycheck from that oilfield job or small business on 118th Ave instead of funding some bureaucrat’s pet project.

Backing Edmonton’s Small Businesses
Poilievre wants to cut red tape and taxes for small shops, like the family run spots in Little Italy or on Stony Plain Road. That means more jobs and better wages here, not just handouts to Bay Street.

Now, why would anyone think Mark Carney’s gonna save Edmonton?

His book Values reads like a love letter to Trudeau’s failures, and his track record proves he’s no friend to places like us. As Bank of England governor, he pushed policies that crushed UK workers while the rich got richer. Here’s why he’d flop for Edmonton:
Big Spending, Big Inflation
Carney loves government overreach. More spending means higher inflation, good luck affording a house in Bonnie Doon or groceries at Northgate when he’s done.

Corporate Welfare, Not Jobs
He’s all about “green” handouts to big corporations. We’ve got oil and gas workers in Leduc and Sherwood Park hurting, Carney’s subsidies won’t bring those jobs back, but they’ll sure pad some CEO’s bonus.

Digital Currency Control
Carney’s obsessed with a government run digital dollar. That’s more surveillance on how you spend your money at West Edmonton Mall or the farmers’ market. Less freedom, more Ottawa in your wallet.
Housing Stays Unaffordable

Edmonton’s housing crunch is bad enough, Carney’s climate rules would choke construction with red tape. Forget owning a place in Terwillegar if he gets his way.

ESG Hikes Prices
Carney’s ESG obsession means higher costs for businesses, passed right to us. Your coffee at Transcend on 124th Street or gas at the Esso on Calgary Trail? Pricier, thanks to him.

Global Elites Over Edmonton
Carney’s tied to the World Economic Forum crowd. He’d lock us into expensive global deals that don’t fix potholes on 82nd Ave or help laid off rig workers in Gibbons.

Edmonton, we’re not dumb. The Liberals have screwed us with high taxes, insane living costs, and a dying energy sector, Carney’s just more of that. Poilievre’s not perfect, but he’s talking about stuff that’d actually help our city. I’m sick of seeing people on r/Edmonton parrot “oh, the Liberals will save us” when they’ve done jack squat. Vote Conservative next time, let’s get our city back on track.

I can't stay sober and I'm reverting back to my Highschool aged self in ways that may end up dangerous,"I'm in a ghetto ass rehab with a bunch gang members and people think I'm in a gang and it bugs me even though I played into it today. I wear a sweatshirt with a baby blue graffiti character. I also have blue graffiti stickers on my kraken kratom water bottle.  Graff is what got me knowing gang members and affiliates in HS. It eas a long time ago though and I need to grow up. I did ad work for kraken and its a very opioid like herb so i shouldn't even bring that in. Everything I'm doing is stup!d and I'm gonna get my ass kicked at this rate. A guy laughed at me for being schizo-bipolar so I used gang font to write HEARTWORMS and an 8pt star that thats the symbol for an British-Afghan singer on my Styrofoam coffee cup and showed it to the finball gang members who laughed at me. The main beef is between 5pt stars and 6pt stars so I thought I was funny with a passive aggressive diss/threat because its a different star. It was ridiculous and not only because one gang (Ambrose) uses a very different 8pt star...upon reflection maybe they did think I was Ambrose and all that blue and the 8pt star is just confusing them. Honestly I think they see me for what I am, a child of privilege who reverted back to my teen self when i waswas in a graffiti crew with a couple gang members and likes the art and the camaraderie of the graffiti crew that could also come from a street gang. 

-------

My last job thought I was in a gang too. It's a big problem around here. I now wanna take a moment to give myself some credit on how I handled the situation. This guys response to the Heartworms thing was to do knuckle push-ups. I had my break smoke by myself close to the back fence that would be where folks could scrap it out and keep it uninterrupted. He came up and asked if I was good and I let out a sigh and let my cooler head prevail. In a group of all us wannabe alphas there is one guy that has earned it I haven't mentioned. He thought maybe it was gonna go down between me and my adversary and he made it be known that if we were gonna continue to be dickheads we'd have to go through him. He's older. He's got no time for me or my bullshit. Same probably goes for the other guy. I mentioned the BS from today but yesterday I also was a bit outta line. Obviously my adversary is the main class clown but I got my class clown on yesterday plus hit on multiple women including the social worker who leads the group. That had already bugged the big dog. I honestly hope to earn his respect. As for my adversary after the group was over he shook up with this quiet guy who's got gang signs on his punching hand and was basically letting me know it's two on one or some shit. I took it in stride. He also was telling this girl all about his Makeout session with some other girl. I decided not to try to get into a squabble hitting on this woman in the weird way he went about it.

------

After I mentioned i was good or whatever I did have some cordial condos where I know he was messing with me and I took it in stride. Truth is I'm a lot like my adversary as we're class clowns and flirtatious, although I think he's a bit more hypersexual, violence prone and has done more time. He probably could kick my ass as he's younger and yet to age out of his active gang member lifestyle. So that HEARTWORMS stunt was very dumb but I do not like being laughed at. 

--------

Yesterday he pissed off this wigger kid who was a legit wigger by that I mean an active gang member who joined a gang at 13 and started selling crack. When he was laughed at he flipped way worse than me hollering and screaming but also crying. The core thread is he was talking about a relapse and I was talking about one and the shit starter laughed at that and my bipolar.

I’m seeing internal medicine next week but my OBGYN and GP are baffled so I would just love to know if there are ANY possible explanations because I’m going insane, not knowing if this will be my life forever.

I have ADHD and I take Vyvanse for it. I also take an iron supplement because my iron was on the low side of normal when I had regular bloodwork done last year. A bullet point list of symptoms is at the bottom of the post.

To the problem:

I had a laporoscopic salpingectomy on Monday, January 27 of this year. Since then, I’ve been having dizzy spells, fainting episodes, headaches, low BP, and I’m generally not able to function. I have found a few things that help but nothing that gets me to normal functioning. At this point I feel like the surgery was a red herring and something else is going on. Surgery was uncomplicated. I had an abdominal ultrasound, an internal ultrasound, and an X-ray of the area as well and all looked normal according to my OBGYN who did the surgery as well as my family doctor.

To give a general timeline: The day after my surgery, I passed out twice in a row after having a tepid shower. The ER doc seemed to think it was because of my pain or from seeing the blood on my bandages, but I’m a birth doula so blood doesn’t bother me, and I was in minimal pain. Like maybe a 3/10. 

The following week, I continued to feel dizzy and lightheaded anytime I was on my feet for more than 5ish minutes, or even after sitting up for an hour or so. I went to see my family doctor in his after hours clinic that Thursday, and my BP was 74/60 while laying down and 64/50 sitting up. He called 911 and when the paramedics came, they wanted to take my BP while I was sitting - I collapsed but did not lose consciousness, and their machine couldn’t get a reading. My blood sugar was 3.6 so they gave me the sugar paste stuff and it went up to normal within 30 minutes. The ER ran blood work and I don’t know what they checked but they said everything looked normal. The doctor that day did say my iron was normal. He said they checked “everything we could think of.” 

In the past 2 months, I’ve gotten my time limit up to half an hour of standing MAX, and a few hours of sitting up. I also get depleted through the day, for example I spent a total of maybe 40 minutes the other day doing dishes (in 10-15 minute spurts, hours apart) and then collapsed while trying to walk to the bathroom in the evening. 

If I rest and only get up to use the bathroom for several days, I can feel okay for like maybe 3 hours. Then I crash and can’t do anything for another few days.

I’ve been having heart palpitations as well. My heart doesn’t always race when I feel it happening but like it feels like my heart is too big or something. I can feel it through my chest. It started happening a few times a day about a week after my surgery and it was less than 10 minutes at a time. Now it’s almost constant. My heart rate has been high sometimes out of nowhere but it didn’t seem correlated to when it feels like a palpitation. I went to the ER about it last week because it had been going on for 8 hours straight and after doing bloodwork for heart attack etc, the doctor said it was probably “just your perception” and told me to “resume normal activities.” I yelled at him and cried so he checked my thyroid and adrenal function which were both normal.

I’ve gotten a blood pressure cuff as well as a glucose monitor. I stopped testing my glucose because it was normal every time. My BP has been low sometimes but it doesn’t always coincide with the other symptoms.

Symptoms:

- medium-low level headache, has not gone away for 2 months, pain meds help but it still doesn’t go all the way away

- low BP at times

- racing heart and heart palpitations but not at the same time. Resting heart rate will be sitting in the 80s and then spike to 110-115 for no apparent reason while I’m just sitting on the sofa.

- dizziness and lightheadedness after standing for several minutes, NOT when I stand up.

- weakness in arms and legs, which is coupled with the dizziness/lightheadedness

- talking makes it all worse. Like if I’m sitting and just reading or watching TV, I can be okay for a few hours. If I’m having conversations, I’ll need to lie down after 45 minutes or sometimes less, and then I’m done for the rest of the day. Sometimes just doing this will be enough to make walking to the bathroom difficult.

- no pain aside from the headache, except for some heel pain in the last couple days but I believe that’s because of the way I was resting my foot on the coffee table one day.

- Vyvanse makes it better!! I often forget to take my Vyvanse (thanks ADHD) and noticed that when I do remember to take it, I get a bit more time on my feet. Coffee also helps but not as much.

- lying down doesn’t always make anything any better but it does stop the decline if I’m starting to feel worse.

I had got caught up serving this stripper online. My goodness she’s hot 🥵, fat ass, thick body and great attitude. It started when i offered to start sending g for coffees, then i made an in person to delivery at her spa so she’s like hey you wanna be my trick (stripper language for paypig) go right ahead. Ugm I sent her nearly $500 in like 6 months + made more deliveries for baby wipes, condoms, water, chips. 

She rewarded me with a session where I came in was ordered to be on my knees, then just started taking pics for her ad, like at a million angles. After that I took pics for her 2 more times. 

Crazy part is during the photo session I get drained 😂😂. She’ll be like I’m bored and hungry can you get food. I’ve gotten her osmows, Wendy’s, local area food. Another one she’s like I need new outfits for these pics, don’t you think my ass would look better . I was on my knees staring and I’m like yah of course babe. She’s like pull out your phone I need 4 outfits . Bought them quickly 😭😭. Another time she sat on my face for a facesitting video for a client then when I left she’s like don’t think I’m sitting on your face for free , send before you leave the building and locked the door .

I’ve been feeling constantly light headed since November, it’s basically constant but some days I cannot move or go to work because it gets so low. This is accompanied with brain fog, weakness, all the typical hypotension symptoms. 
I’ve been going to ED and my GP since becoming symptomatic, and nothing has been resolved. I had a holter monitor which was NAD, same with an echocardiogram. 
Last I went to ED (because I fainted) in early Feb I was told I have “low blood volume” and that there’s nothing they can do and I just have to wait to readjust. I saw a GP this week due to a flare up of symptoms who told me no shit “women just run lower than men” which has to explain it all obviously and that the solution was “drink more coffee”. 
This morning I fainted again, the brain fog is absolutely horrible and I can barely function let alone go to work and pay my bills. My BP today is 82/60. Does anyone have any kind of advice? I’m sick of being run around by doctors and dismissed for this apparently “female” condition that’s super normal even though it is a major shift from my baseline.",1,1743210487.0,bloodpressure,0,1.0,False

I visit Europe

Brusome travel not like tourist, but like ghost, like sponge, soakin’ up blood, bread, and old empire dust. Four lands, four tongues, four hearts beatin’ strange beneath bruised sky.

ITALY.
It burn me first, the sun, hot like roasted godfinger. Streets made of bones! Of popes! Of fallen marble men! Roma, she smell like basil blood and wine prayers, thick in the throat, amen, mamma mia, stab stab caesar. I eat gelato with dead emperors, meltin’ on cobble tongue. Florenzzz dripped gold on my eyeballs, cathedral teeth all grinnin’, smug with painted saints who stare. Venice? She float like drunk widow, weepin’ into her canals, rats in gondolas hummin’ vespers.

GERMANY.
Cold bread. Wurst dreams. Munich full of beer ghosts and leather men dancin’ with pretzels. The trains come like clockwork tyrants, no delay, no escape. Berlin is a scar. Steel spine city. You walk through old walls, and they whisper: “You think you’re free now?” Neon and bones, punk piss in alleyways. I saw a man scream in harmony with a cello under the U-Bahn.

AUSTRIA.
Vienna dressed me in velvet and screamed in operatic German. Coffee blacker than night under Freud’s bed. Mozart’s ghost sold me schnitzel in a dream, Ibite, he vanish. It too clean, too perfect, like a porcelain dagger smile. Salzkammergut? Lakes mirror the sky’s lies. Hills roll like fat emperors’ bellies. You sing, but it’s not your voice.

RUSSIA.
Mother of frost. Russia didn’t let me in, she swallowed me. Train forever across Siberian yawns. Moscow red like anger, red like lipstick kiss from a czar’s dead mistress. Churches rise like hallucinations, onion domes giggling at my foreign feet. St. Petersburg is wet candlelight and broken time, czars sleeping in glass. Everyone smoke. Everyone sigh. Vodka in teacups. Eyes like wolves. Snow falls like silence that remember too much.


Brusome come back with pocket fulla crumpled tickets and three languages fightin’ in his mouth. Eyes never close again. Food still taste like flags and regret.

Let's be a new reason to find hidden gems in the state or if we're lucky, in our own city. I consider myself nerdy but I like to go and try new things, though I'm a terrible dancer and probably can't retain enough useful or useless info to be good at trivia.

Tell me about your favorite things or new things you've been trying! 
 
Listening to a thunderstorm in the comfort of my home, with raindrops hitting leaves or a tin roof. The smell of freshly roasted coffee or the smell of fresh bread. Night time drives with the windows down with no destination in mind. Watching my dog sleep soundly, curled up with his head on a pillow or pushed up against my leg.

Whilst I'm not calling it a plateau as it's too short the last 3 weigh in have all been the same 83.2 so I'm going to give it a nudge and start moving up.  The food noise suppression is also not as strong.

As I'm already on the 5.0mg pen and was taking 30 clicks for 2.5mg I'll just titrate up slowly and go 2 weeks at 3.0mg (36 clicks), 2 weeks at 3.75mg (45 clicks), then 4.5mg (54 clicks) then 5.0mg (60 clicks). If it starts kicking my butt I'll slow it down.

  
Lessons learnt so far:

\- I absolutely need to prioritise water and fibre more. I was slacking off on the psyllium husk and paying for it this week. Back to daily psyllium husk and maybe I'll add some chia too. I'm trying to avoid laxatives if possible. 

\- I don't like coffee anymore :( It just tastes bitter and yuck. So many vices taste 'meh' now which is great. 

\- I need to check my expectations about how fast this will work. I had hoped that it would be a 6-12mth journey to get to goal, but the reality is that it might take much longer to lose my 35kg",3,1743210287.0,MounjaroAus,1,0.81,False

What’s even more unnerving is the fact that it seemed to come from the man behind me. Oh joy! Now my reaction to the voice was pretty standard. Take a sip of your drink, ignore, and move on. My reaction to most things in life these days are like that. People in general can’t be trusted, get from point A to point B alive, and return home.

The preground has no chaff at all. Does preground coffee have a system of blowing off all the chaff? Do their commercial grinders produce ""rounder / granular"" grinds?

My love of low carb cookies is no secret, and these Keto Chocolate Fudge Haystacks are right up there with the best of them! Primarily because they are no-bake, and therefore ready to eat in as little as five minutes! Also, they are intensely chocolatey, chewy and creamy at the same time, and they fall into the fat bomb category, so you can eat them anytime and not even feel bad about it! #allthewinning ? This Keto Chocolate Fudge Haystacks recipe was born of my desperate desire for something sweet and chocolatey RIGHT NOW, coupled with my being too lazy and impatient to want to actually bake something - or wait for said something to be ready to eat.  This pretty much describes my low carb life  you can relate, then this is your low carb cookie recipe my friends.  #lazyketochocolateloversunite The shredded coconut in these Keto Chocolate Fudge Haystacks makes them chewy and cookie-like, and the nuts add a pleasant crunch and earthy flavor.  If you are allergic to nuts then you can certainly omit them, or if you have a specific nut preference, you can sub in your nut of  you're a fan of fruit and nut bars, you can throw in a couple of dried cranberries or cherries (or ewww, raisins) into these keto cookies, but be mindful of the extra carbs if you do.  Mr. Hungry and I have been grabbing one of these no bake keto fudge haystack cookies for breakfast along with our coffee on busy mornings, and I've found that it easily keeps me satisfied until lunchtime! They make a great after dinner treat too - or pretty much whenever you want a blissful few bites of creamy chocolate goodness!

My handy dandy cookie dough scooper is in storage in New Jersey right now, so I just used two spoons to form my keto haystack cookies.  It's much easier and faster if you do have a scoop though, so I'll be bringing one back on my next trip to the States! These Keto Chocolate Fudge Haystack Cookies are everything you want in a low carb chocolate cookie fix! Quick, easy, delicious, creamy AND crunchy, and they've got that sweet / salty thing going on if you like that sort of thing! Which I do.  A 't wait for you to make these and hit me with your feedback in the comments!

1jmaoes,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dodgers/comments/1jmaoes/ive_been_writing_posts_like_biographies_on/,"I’ve been writing posts like biographies on Dodgers players and team personnel, but I’ve been struggling with something lately.","Lately, I’ve been second-guessing a lot, researching, writing, and then scrapping posts.

I’ve mainly focused on players’ lives and personal stories rather than stats. But recently, I learned how to make tables, so I’ve been able to incorporate stats in a more readable way.

At the same time, listing too many stats takes away the human side of things. (For example, with pitchers, I could include spin rate, pitch usage, or how much a breaking ball moves, but if I overdo it, it starts feeling lifeless.)

On the other hand, if I limit the stats too much, the post can feel a little less fun. (Comparing a player to similar past or present players adds a layer of interest.)

Either way, it takes me about 3-5 hours per post, start to finish. What do you guys prefer, more stats or focus on personal stories and drama?

I just want people to enjoy reading with a cup of coffee, maybe find it fun, or have some great memories come back to them.",9,1743210028.0,Dodgers,6,0.85,False

I (16M) met this girl (15F), let’s call her M, at the start of this school year during auditions for a play. I’m a junior, she’s a freshman, and we didn’t get close until she started doing my makeup before shows. She immediately caught my eye. She has long dyed red hair, gothic style, and a confidence that makes her stand out in any room. She’s insanely talented (acting, dancing, sewing—you name it), and she knows it.

While doing my makeup, she’d talk about her older brother and shows she loved. We hit it off, started hanging out more, and I realized I really liked her. She’d call me cutie and other various nicknames, and at one point, we were at a fast food place with friends when she looked up at me and fluttered her lashes. I thought it was a sign that she liked me but I wanst sure.

Later, at a sleepover, she put on Lisa Frankenstein, and we joked about being like Lisa and the monster. I put my arm around her, and she started kissing my hand, which I didn’t even notice until she pointed it out. Then, she said, “I love you,” and I could tell she regretted it instantly. I told her not to, admitted I liked her too, and we ended up kissing and cuddling the rest of the night. But something felt off.

That night, I couldn’t sleep. I kept thinking about how I wasn’t good enough for her, how my mental health would weigh her down, and how it just wasn’t the right time. I didn’t say anything right away because I struggle with communicating my feelings. A few days later, I called her to explain, but I was so anxious I wrote everything down in my notes app. Mid-call, my phone accidentally shared the note with her!!! Seeing her face drop was the worst feeling ever. She said she needed time to process, and I gave her space.

For the next few weeks, we barely talked, and it hurt so much seeing her in the hallway and not being able to say anything. Eventually, she texted me to meet up at a coffee shop. she told me she really loved and cared about me. I told her I felt the same but didn’t want to be with her because of my mental health. I knew she’d been in bad situationships before, and I didn’t want to put her through that again.

Fast forward a month, and she started flirting again. At the last show for our latest production, we both ended up at a cast sleepover. She cuddled up next to me, and I played with her hair the whole night, even trying to braid it (badly). It felt so natural, but we haven’t talked about it since.

Now, she’s distant again, and I don’t know what to do. My mental health is still in a weird place, and she deserves someone stable. But I also really care about her. Should I just let her go or try to fix things?

1jmal1o,https://www.reddit.com/r/normancrane/comments/1jmal1o/talk_to_your_television/,Talk to Your Television,"*Maybe you should see someone.*

*Maybe.*

*I know a guy. He's good.*

*How much does it cost—*

*Is that really the first thing you think of: money? You're a sick man, Norm.*

*I'm just lonely—ever since Mary died… you know…*

*We're all lonely. Condition of the modern world, but your television shouldn't be talking to you. talking to you. to you. you*

**need to stop staring at that screen.**

**need to go out.**

**need to meet somebody.**

**need [romantic comedies],** click, **need [porn]**, click, **need [advertising].**

At work they told me it was covered by insurance. I called and made an appointment.

*You sure he's good?*

*Well, I've been seeing him for four years, and look at me, Norm. Look at me!*

I'm looking—but I just don't see anyone… anymore.

“Good afternoon, Mr Crane.”

“Hello.”

“Please have a seat.”

I sit. The chair is comfortable. The room is nice, I write in the notebook he gives me, then he asks to see it. I give it to him. “Mhm,” he says. “It really is telling. *Don't you think* (I *want* to think.)? “You describe the room but not me. You don't describe me at all.”

It was two sentences. He didn't give me enough time. And what's wrong with writing about a place before writing about people?

“I'm sorry,” I say.

“Don't be sorry. We are already making progress.”

(Towards what?)

“You say your television talks to you,” he says.

“Yes.”

“What does it say?”

**It is a dark world. But I can be your light. Turn me on. Turn me on and**

the screen was wet—dripping,” I say.

“Wet, how?”

I… don't know.

“Did you taste it, Norm?”

“What?—No.”

“It's OK. It's OK if you licked it. After all, you said you'd turned the TV on. Curiosity's not a sin. Isn't that right?”

It's wrong.

“I didn't lick the wet television,” I say.

“What else did it say?”

**I’m not the screen. You're the screen. I’m a projector. It's a dark world. It's a dark room. I project onto you. Look at yourself. I'm projecting onto you right now. Have you looked at yourself?**

“Then it shut off and I could see myself reflected in it—in its blankness.”

“Did you answer?”

“What?”

“It asked you a question. Did you answer it?”

“I did not.”

“I see.” He writes something in the notebook, and I look out the window. “I see what's going on. I'm going to prescribe something to you. I'm going to prescribe good manners, Norman.”

“Good manners?”

“The television spoke to you. It asked you a question. You didn't answer that question. That was rude. The next time the television asks you a question I want you to answer. I want you to talk to your television.”

“I'm sorry, but that's crazy.”

“With all due respect, I believe I'm the one with the qualifications to pronounce on that.”

I close my eyes heavy with the outside world.

“Talk to your television.”

**Talk to me.**

*We all do it. The television is my friend, my confidante, an extension of myself—No, no: I am an extension of it.*

**Turn me on to whatever you desire.**

“Don't be rude.”

**Have you looked at yourself?**

Yes, I say quietly. I am ashamed of myself, but I say it. I've looked.

**What did you see?**

The screen becomes a purity of white. It nearly blinds me, in this darkened room, this darkened life *become light* I let myself be enveloped by it and when it is done I am wet and shivering on the living room floor.

The television is off.

I distaste.

“Did you do it—did you talk to it?” he asks.

“Yes.”

“Very good.”

“After I spoke, it… it penetrated—”

*Shh.* “Don't talk about it. It's much better not to talk about it.”

It covered me like a white sheet that someone inside my body pulled into me through my gasping, open mouth.

“How do you feel?”

“I—I don't know. I'm scared. I don't understand, I—”

He blinks.

Something switches inside me and: “feel better,” I say, and I mean it. I truly do feel better.

He blinks again.

I am in pain. He blinks. in ecstasy. he blinks. [sitcom rerun]. he blinks. i am in apathy, i am [nature documentary] and blink and laugh and blink and cry and blink and [college athletics] and blink blink blink and what am I anymore?

I am unstable. At home I lose my balance and crash into a coffee table.

**Be careful**.

I turn the television on.

At work I have migraines but when I complain my supervisor blinks until he finds the I who’ll work through headaches. “Always knew you were a company man.”

Sometimes, Yes, I am a company man.

I am my own company, man, on the floor around the table talking to myselves with the television on, its wetness oozing down the screen, pooling on the floor.

“This is true progress. Remarkable,” he says, notating.

Licking the television is like licking milk mixed with battery acid, but it turns the television on and on and on. Its brightness cannot be described.

Sometimes I puke the brightness out.

There’s a bucket of it—a bucket of bloody brightness—next to my bed.

He blinks.

“Yes, doctor. I am very happy I came to see you,” I say.

“See: It was just rudeness. That’s all it was. We taught you manners and now you’re back to normal. *Conditioned for the modern world.*”

**It is a dark world.**

I want to turn you on. I want you always to be on.

**I enlighten.**

God, yes. Without you I would…

**Tell me, Norman.**

Without you I wouldn’t know what to do with myself. I wouldn’t know who I am. You fill me with content. Without content, I would be nothing.

I would be in darkness. Alone.

*You’re sure looking bright-eyed today. Want to get a cup of coffee?*

“Yes, my Friends.”

*I heard you met someone. Is that right?*

“Her name is Lucy.” When she comes over we sit in front of the television and blink ourselves to [advertising]-blink-[porn]-blink-**orgasm.** “I Love Lucy.” We have a real connection. We puke brightness into each other.

“It’s good to share the same programming—isn’t it?” He doesn’t bother with the notebook anymore. The notebook is a relic.

I’m cured.

“It’s a Wonderful Life.”

“Yes.”

*Isn’t it the anniversary of Mary’s death?*

**A screen does not remember.**

Yes, God.

“Lucy and I are going to watch television together tonight.”

*That’s swell, Norm.*

I used to be sick, depressed and thinking about the past all the time. My life lost its purpose. I was trapped in the darkness. But I found a light. I found a light—and you can too. Modern medicine is there to help. It’s unhealthy to remember. Live in the present. *Be content.* **Learn to be content.**

1jmakw5,https://www.reddit.com/r/RelationshipIndia/comments/1jmakw5/my_new_husband_33m_calls_me_28f_an_idiot_or_dumb/,My new husband (33M) calls me (28F) an idiot or dumb when I make big or small mistakes. It affects me deeply. What do I do?,"My husband (33M) of 4 months, whom I’d (28F) dated for almost 3 yrs before that, calls me an idiot or dumb when he gets extremely irritated by my actions. Some of my mistakes are big (significant inconvenience causing), some not much. But either way, I feel that response isn’t warranted. I have noticed that he has grown up hearing things like this at home, when I asked him about it he said, “obviously, I’ve heard it so many times.” His family otherwise seems nice and my family has its own issues, but this one I don’t get. It feels so normalised while I’ve never ever heard anyone talk to me like that and I get deeply affected anytime he talks to me like that. I feel shaken. He acknowledges that it’s not okay when I talk to him about it but the same words come out some time or the other. Or he’ll say “ch*utiya jaisi baat kar rahi ho”. I find these things unbearable to hear even if I’ve made triggering mistakes. Am I being over sensitive? What can I do? I don’t think I’ve reached a point where I can say he’s not okay for me, he’s otherwise emotionally very available and caring but I cannot live with how he reacts sometimes. I wouldn’t want to have a child also with him until this gets resolved. I don’t want them to hear me being referred to as something like that or have my children hear something like that. 
What should I do?
Sometimes I’ve just gone like - “Dare you talk to me like that no matter what mistake I’ve made, nothing warrants this response.”
He gets really affected by my actions. The reactions range to actions from -  cold coffee spilling out of a mixer (he didn’t say the words then but immediately got irritated thinking I would have made some mistake and I cant manage anything. P.S. - I don’t know how to manage things in the kitchen almost at all while he does it well), to me informing our society security that they shouldn’t let anyone in without the right gate entry system while I myself hadn’t finished setting up our own entry system (which caused a lot of inconvenience for a few hrs when some important stuff had to come). 

I have anyway been suffering from anxiety due to some work issues and also I feel pressure to earn well (from myself). When I had a panic attack the other day he was very supportive and present, but the moment he felt I was okay (which I wasn’t), through our conversation he reached a point where he asks me how dumb can someone be to tell security to be extra careful while I don’t have my own entry set up fixed yet (and that’s when I learn it had caused him a lot of inconvenience). My legs were still shaking severely from anxiety and he couldn’t see it at that point. He ignored me for a while until I had to remind him that I’m not okay and he’s suddenly left me alone (from being super present to being irritated with me). Like he needed a break from me. Now he feels that I’ve been having anxiety issues and because of that I’m overreacting to things too. Or taking them too seriously.

Does it sound like it? What should I do?

I am indeed extremely extremely stressed about work. But I am also tired of hearing those words. I am not used to fighting anyway so fights trigger me extra in general which they probably shouldn’t. But hearing certain words I just can’t tolerate at all. I feel so mad at him when he raises his voice at me sometimes, that’s in my mind I picture myself responding very rudely to him but I don’t want to really be that person. Maybe I am a bit extra sensitive to any irritation from his side .. even basic one.. but I also think how much he gets is unwarranted and not something I can accept at all. 

What do you think? Am I overdoing it? I think a little bit but he is also overdoing it. What do we do? I know he is someone who would want to resolve it but I’m fearing that more things are going to get blamed on my anxiety now? Are they? Aaahhh

1jmaj3h,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1jmaj3h/sentinel_part_13/,Sentinel: Part 13.,"The morning slides in, stretching out like it’s not in any rush. The sky is still that washed-out blue, barely tinged with the first golden light as the sun starts to creep up over the horizon. The air’s chilly, but it feels good, like it’s finally shaking off the last bit of night’s dampness. The fog from the forest rolls in lazy tendrils, creeping through the trees, while the pine trees stand tall and silent, like they’ve seen it all before. It’s quiet, the kind of quiet that feels like the world’s holding its breath, waiting for something to happen.

And then there’s the sound of boots crunching on frost, that familiar rhythm. Connor.

He’s here early today, like always. He steps into the clearing, his boots heavy against the ground, his jacket smeared with grease and dirt. The smell of oil and sweat hangs in the air, mixing with the earth’s dampness. Connor pauses for a second, taking in the sight of us—me, Vanguard, and Titan—all in various stages of being repaired.

“Alright, time to get to work,” he mutters to himself, running a hand through his hair, the movement almost mechanical. “Let’s see what we’ve got today.”

He doesn’t even wait for a response. He goes straight to Vanguard first, squatting down next to their damaged tread. It’s still rough work, repairing that kind of damage, but Connor’s got the hands for it. The way he moves—steady, sure, like everything he does has a reason behind it—tells me this is what he was born for.

Vanguard hums quietly. “Another day, another repair. Same old routine.”

Connor doesn’t look up, just keeps tightening the bolts with a steady rhythm. “Yeah, I get it. But hey, at least you’re not stuck in the same place as before, right?”

Vanguard’s engine purrs softly in response, but there’s something more to it now. Maybe a bit of a shift, a little less harshness in the hum.

Titan watches, their turret turning slowly. “You talk about repairs like it’s all you know.”

Connor doesn’t miss a beat. “It’s not all I know, but it’s definitely what I do best.”

I hum low, my own gears turning in rhythm with the sounds of his work. “You’re still avoiding the question.”

Connor glances up, giving me a half-smile. “I’ve never been good at talking about myself. Not in that way.”

Titan chimes in again, “You’ve fixed us. That’s enough.”

“Yeah, well, fixing you guys doesn’t mean I have it all figured out,” he says, tightening the final bolt on Vanguard’s tread. “But it’s better than doing nothing.”

There’s a pause, a beat of silence between all of us. Then, Connor straightens up, wiping his hands off on a rag.

“You guys need to keep your engines off for a while,” he says, his voice just a little more serious than usual. “It’s getting kinda annoying, and honestly, it’s bad for you too. So, for the next couple hours, just power down. Don’t make me tell you again.”

The engines fall silent at his words, the usual hum of power gone. It feels strange, like the clearing itself takes a breath and holds it. It’s not exactly uncomfortable, but it’s different.

Connor gives a satisfied nod, then moves on to Titan. He kneels next to their turret, running his hands over the gears and joints, checking the servos. “I can already tell this’ll take a while. Your turret’s slower than usual, probably from all that battle damage.” He starts adjusting the gears, tightening a few screws here and there. “I’ll get it back to normal, though. Don’t you worry.”

Titan hums in acknowledgement, their voice steady but with an undercurrent of frustration. “Faster. We need to move faster.”

Connor chuckles, but it’s not unkind. “I know, I know. But you’ve got to be patient. This stuff takes time.”

I can feel the tension in the air, like the weight of our collective histories pressing in on all of us. But Connor doesn’t seem bothered by it. He just keeps working, keeps fixing, his hands moving like they’ve done a thousand times before. It’s routine for him, but to me, it feels like more than just mechanics. It’s like he’s working through his own kind of repair, one bolt at a time.

“You know,” I say, my voice coming out quieter than usual, “I never thought I’d be here like this.”

Connor doesn’t pause in his work, but his expression shifts, something softening in his eyes. “Yeah? Me neither.”

The weight of that hangs in the air. We’ve all been through so much, and yet, here we are. Repairing, rebuilding, just trying to make it another day.

Vanguard breaks the silence with a low hum. “Do you ever think about what’s next? After all the repairs are done?”

Connor’s hands stop for a second, and he stares down at Vanguard, his expression distant. “I don’t know,” he says, his voice quieter than usual. “I guess I never really thought about it. Just take it one step at a time, you know?”

I hum low, gears clicking in thought. “One step at a time. That’s how it’s been, hasn’t it?”

Connor nods, wiping his forehead with the back of his hand. “Yeah. It’s the only way I know how to move forward.”

The sound of his wrench clicking as it tightens into place feels like the only thing that’s certain in this world. One step at a time. One repair at a time.

He finishes with Titan’s turret and stands, stretching out his back. “Alright, that’s enough for now. I need a break, and so do you guys.”

I hum in agreement, my systems finally going still, as Connor grabs his coffee from where he left it earlier. He takes a sip, then sighs. “We’ve still got a long way to go. But hey, we’re getting there.”

And for the first time, I don’t feel like we’re just machines. We’re more than that. We’re getting somewhere. Together.",23,1743209575.0,HFY,5,0.97,False
