I’m considering a move to Dallas next year for work at a children’s hospital and wanted to get a better sense of what daily life in the city is really like from people who live there.

I’m in my mid-20s and coming from abroad, so I’d really appreciate honest perspectives on a few things that matter to me:

* Which areas are popular with young professionals? Any neighborhoods you’d strongly recommend (or avoid)?
* How realistic is it to live without a car at first? Is public transportation usable day-to-day, or is a car pretty essential?
* How affordable does Dallas feel for someone early in their career? Any costs that surprised you?
* How would you describe the restaurant and coffee culture? Are there good international food options?
* Are there recreational sports leagues (volleyball, pickleball), gyms, or outdoor activities people enjoy?
* What’s the general vibe for people in their 20s–30s? How’s the nightlife and social scene?
* How intense is the summer heat in practice, and how do people adjust their routines around it?
* Are there parts of the city that feel especially livable or less so for newcomers?

I’d love to hear any pros/cons, personal experiences, or things you wish you’d known before moving to Dallas. Thanks so much in advance!",1,1766147018.0,askdfw,0,1.0,False

How do I even begin this story without it turning into an analysis of my ex-boyfriend or my own mental state? A few things to mention first: we met on a dating app and had a really long, nice phone call. People often tell me that I rush into things and that I am pretty naive. He is two years older than me, and due to an injury as well as other past poor decisions, he decided not to return to school for an unknown amount of time to finish his degree.

He pressured me into dating him. I wanted to take things slower, but he kept asking and reassuring me that everything would be better if we just committed. Eventually, I did, reluctantly, because of how fast everything was moving. I met his friends and family very early on, which shocked me given the speed of the relationship. We became increasingly intimate. We took some time before having penetrative sex, and I am only sharing this because it is anonymous, but I had sexual trauma and still do. We worked through it slowly, though we were both very physically drawn to each other. We could not keep our hands off each other, and it is important to note that he lived in the same apartment as his mother.

As time passed, it became difficult to adjust to a dynamic where it felt like everyone had a say in our relationship. At times, I could overhear him complaining about spending money, even though he had been nonchalant about it during our first few dates. I was transparent about my situation. I was focused on studying, wanted to go to grad school, and relied mostly on my parents financially. Eventually, because I was constantly at his mother’s apartment and we were having sex all the time, and we only ever left to go on expensive restaurant dates, she lost her patience and kicked me out.

As this tension grew, so did the tension between his friends and me. They rebuked me, accusing me of being stuck-up or asking for too much, even though he never clearly communicated expectations around money or his ability to provide food outside of my campus. I wished he had been clear from the beginning. Was it wrong for me to expect to be fed when all we did for hours was switch between homework and sex while he switched between sex, video games, and alcohol?

At multiple points, he physically grabbed me by the collar to prevent me from leaving when I needed space. I remember breaking a nail while pushing him away because he wanted to get in my face and I just wanted personal space. Those moments made me feel trapped, scared, and completely disrespected.

I kept breaking up with him, and his friends would reach out, convincing me to take him back. I still question why I stayed. Was it because of the sex? Because I fell for him even though everyone told me he was not good for me? Did I attach because of intimacy? Did I convince myself he was the best I would ever do, or did I let him convince me of that?

Eventually, I grew resentful. He wanted constant contact and validation, checked my phone, and expected me to play nice with friends and family who clearly disliked me. Over time, it felt like he wanted me to be both a housewife and the breadwinner. I finally gave up and broke up with him for the eighth time.

To anyone reading this, I really tried. I tried to understand his financial situation, the scars from his only previous relationship, and how his parents’ divorce affected him. I tried to help him, and he tried to help me in his own way. Still, I became borderline suicidal because of how deprioritized and insecure his inconsistency and alcohol-like tendencies made me feel, tendencies that his family and friends enabled.

I love him deeply. But the stress of my major, my family being on my case after finding out about him, and my overall lack of support pushed me to pull the plug. I crashed out badly. I cut up his clothes, cussed him out through messages, lashed out at his friends, and completely lost control again. I drank alcohol, a Celsius, and a Starbucks coffee all together. I am not proud of this.

What I am trying to ask is this: how am I supposed to feel okay or have any sense of self-worth when the one man who treated me with some level of respect still fell miles short of a relationship worth my time and love? I clung to him so tightly that the day before the final breakup, I called him to pick me up just so I could have someone hold me and keep me from hurting myself. I really did love him. Who writes that many love letters to someone and is treated this poorly? I promise I was somewhat transparent about my mental health, but I just told him I wanted him to come pick me up because I needed him to hold me.

Discontinued birth control in August, discontinued SSRI/SNRIs in march/april.

Sorry for the long post.

In september I had a day of very loose bowel movements and thought nothing of it as although this is unusual, I do have IBS-C and a very sensitive stomach to things like coffee. However, I did have a sharp pain in my tummy that only lasted for a few seconds. The next day I was sat on the sofa eating food at around 2pm and I had a sudden episode. The room almost “swam” upwards in my vision, my heart began to beat very hard, I felt breathless although able to breathe, and I began to pace and panic. Called 999, went to A&E and my ECG was fine. While it sounds like a panic attack, I am certain it was not. I came home and my vision remained odd, “swimmy”, and I had little appetite. This happened again a week later, although this time it felt more like I needed to lie down and was very lightheaded and limbs felt unusually “light”. Went doctor, stool samples and blood fine. The diarrhoea remained for 2 and a half weeks and I had extreme trapped gas and bloating.

Following this episode my vision remains like this. I have had recurring episodes of the fast heart rate, feeling lightheaded, needing to hold myself. Other symptoms include loose, floating, stools, reduced urgency for the bathroom, effected appetite, pins and needles in hands and feet at times, odd body temperature (eg feeling like my feet are very hot), heightened anxiety, random heart palpitations, stomach cramps (which have gone now, I will explain). About a week after this I began belching, burping (which I never usually do) and feeling pressure/ light pain in my chest. I’ve also had my heart randomly thump and propranolol (was prescribed for anxiety years ago) did not help.

2 months after this episode, still feeling “drunk” and having these symptoms, I ate a takeaway burger. An hour after eating I began to throw up and (tmi so sorry) produce thick liquid orange stool that would not stop. The next day the room was spinning so much and I felt off balance, very ‘light’, and strange, went to A&E, ECG and bloods fine. I could not eat, I was convinced I was dying, and my parents travelled to my Uni city to get me. Since being at home, I have seen a gastroenterologist. My stools also somewhat solidified.

Bloods fine, endo and colonoscopy fine, stool samples fine (including H pylori). However I tested positive for SIBO (do not know which type or exact score). The gastro doctor said that my multi-systemic symptoms are not symptoms of SIBO. Everyone is convinced I’m just having a mental breakdown and that it’s just anxiety, yet I can’t even shower without holding on to the wall.

I began treatment of Amoxicilin for 10 days. Symptoms have not improved, although I had one day (day 6 of treatment) of feeling absolutely normal. Then the weird vision/drunk/off balance feeling came back. A day after finishing my antibiotics (5 days ago) I have developed the most extreme brain fog. I did have it before but this is like nothing I have ever had- I will take a vitamin and forget which one I have taken immediately after.

So on Monday, I followed the gastro doctors orders. He had previously mentioned (before the SIBO result) 10mg of nortripryline. He has attributed my symptoms numerous times to stress, and said this will “calm down my stomach” for a while. I was reluctant to touch this as I had spent months trying to get off SS/NRIs after being on them for 5 years. But I have filled the prescription, and I’m on day 2 of taking them at night. I do feel a bit like there just being thrown at me because no one knows what’s going on and thinks i’m being hysterical.

As of right now feel like it’s heavy to breathe, walking to the bathroom makes me feel so off balance, i am sensitive to light, I can barely think, I get extremely fatigued all the time, And I haven’t been back to University since september. Walking down the street feels like the most disorienting experience so I do not leave the house. When i’ve used an elevator the floor feels like it’s still moving and I have to hold onto something after. I can’t look at the floor when I walk but I also can’t look up or I get too disoriented. My life is actually on hold as of right now and my health anxiety is through the roof. My family are not taking me seriously and obviously I “seem fine” bar major health anxiety, But i am always dramatic and anxious so its a bit of a boy who cried wolf situation.

I am literally terrified of what is happening to me. I’ve tried to stop thinking about it or be normal but I can’t. I can’t even look around the room without being reminded of what is going on so i just lie in bed all day and I hate having to walk around or leave the house because I feel so so off. Dizzy isn’t the word, it’s like i’m going to faint any second and my eyes are really tired?

I believe my bloods checked my thyroid, B12. I did actually have a blood test in summer before all this which found low folate but clearly that’s not flagged up since. I should also mention I had a very stressful summer and nearly lost a parent who has recovered now, and this all started days into me moving back to uni and away from that situation. I am somewhat wondering if these are extremely delayed ssri withdrawals but I want to rule out a physical / neuro issue

Thank you so much to anyone who answers.

1pqjp2l,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1pqjp2l/in_a_new_relationship_but_not_over_my_ex/,In a new relationship but not over my ex,"So my ex and I dated for nearly 8 years in our early 20s. We ended things when I had been planning on taking a solo travel around the country. (We had talked about doing it together for years but it came down to that he did not want to and I did). So we ended things. It was really tough and a bittersweet end but was the right thing to do at the time. After a few months of no contact and I was visiting town, we met up and had very intense conversations about our relationship and he was more vulnerable than I had ever seen him. However, I was still in the midst of my travels and was not moving back. We would have a phone call each month for the following couple of months but usually ended with me having to close contact because it hurt to be in a limbo. I ended up meeting someone on the road (after 10 months of being broken up with my ex) and that felt really good and exciting. 

After 4-5 months of dating the new person, I decided to move to his town, across the country from my home state and my ex. It's been a year and a half with my new boyfriend and about 2 years and some change since my ex and I broke up. Ever since I settled in my new town with my current boyfriend I find it impossible not to think of my ex. I am still good friends with his sister so I hear about him from time to time. (Good things, he has gotten a new job, done some traveling) 

Its been so tough because my current boyfriend is really a great partner but I just don't feel like I am fully engaged because I have these ""what ifs"" about my ex. Now I am in my home town and have a strong urge to reach out to my ex to meet for coffee and see how he is or gain some clarity. I have learned he began dating recently and part of me knows that was where everything felt more real - like I might lose him forever. But is that for the best?​

Either way I feel none of this is fair to my current boyfriend. I can't understand why I still have such a strong pull to my ex. I have gone to therapy, done cord cutting rituals and endless reflection. Any advice or thoughts are so appreciated. Thanks for reading. ​​",1,1766146713.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

For some backstory, when I was in senior year of high school I was super excited about university applications. There were schools outside of my city that I was interested in applying to as well as different majors. Originally, my plan was to apply and then make the final decision once I had my offers. 

This sparked an argument between my mom, and then my dad. I showed my mom the list of schools I wanted to apply to and she got upset at the fact that out-of-city universities were my first choices and community universities were my last. That was when I found out that my parents had no money saved up for my university funds. I felt very upset as I am passionate about a lot of things and there were universities outside of my city that specialized in those majors. I asked my parents if I could apply for student loans instead, they said no. And on top of that, they were upset that I wanted to go out-of-city to further my education.

My reason behind wanting to go out-of-city was not only because the universities specialized in certain majors, but also because my parents and I never had a close relationship. We always were in fights during my high school years as I wanted to participate in extracurriculars and to at least hang out with my friends every once in a while. For instance, it took lots and lots of begging to be able to hang out with my friends after school and I was given a curfew of 4:30 pm while school ended at 3:15 pm. I had Life360 and wasn’t allowed to step out of school grounds to buy coffee and snacks at the plaza right across from school. I also wanted to participate in a lot of sports but my dad disapproved of it saying the training locations were too far or that I was just trying to get myself injured. Needless to say, I had no identity outside of school and I wanted being away from home to be an opportunity to learn who I was.

I ended up taking a gap year after graduation because my parents disapproved of the majors I was applying for (Psychology, Social Work, Law) and believed I was only setting myself up for failure because “the pay is low”. Instead, they pushed for the Nursing at my community universities which I couldn’t bring myself to do. I couldn’t bring myself to be in a field of study that I was not passionate about. I didn’t see a point in pursuing a bachelor’s degree that would overall make me unhappy.

My parents continued to push me to apply and at this point, I no longer felt comfortable in opening up to them so I just said okay every time and moved on with my day. That’s where I messed up because instead of telling them that I didn’t want to pursue Nursing, it only raised their expectations higher and got even more upset, comparing me to themselves when they were young and also comparing me to other people who graduated in my year.

Now I feel stuck, trying to find a major that they at least approve of and that I somewhat have interest in. I really don’t know what to do. I understand that they care about me and my future but I really feel like I am not being heard. I feel lost because school was all I’ve ever known - no social life in high school just to not be able to pursue something I am not passionate about. To also not being able to identify who I am outside of school.

1pqjhr4,https://www.reddit.com/r/PrivatePackets/comments/1pqjhr4/why_a_vpn_wont_fix_your_privacy/,Why a VPN won't fix your privacy,"You have heard the marketing pitch a thousand times. Buy a VPN, click a button, and suddenly you are invisible to the internet. The reality is much more complicated. Based on the browsing habits you described, **your intuition is correct: a VPN will likely provide almost no additional privacy for you.**

To understand why, we have to look at who is actually watching you and how they do it.

# The ISP vs. the website

When you browse the web without a VPN, your Internet Service Provider (ISP) acts like a postman. Because most of the web is now encrypted via HTTPS, the ISP cannot read the ""letters"" inside the envelopes (your passwords or credit card numbers). However, they can still read the address on the outside of the envelope. **They know exactly which websites you visit and when you visit them.**

A VPN puts that envelope inside a secure, armored truck. Your ISP sees the truck leave your house, but they don't know where it is going or what is inside.

If your main fear is your ISP selling your browsing history, a VPN solves that problem. But you mentioned your main concern is ""selling data about habits"" by the services you use, like Google and advertisers. **A VPN does absolutely nothing to stop that.**

# The ""logged in"" problem

Privacy tools are useless if you voluntarily identify yourself.

You mentioned you use Chrome or Edge and stay logged into your Google account. This is the digital equivalent of wearing a mask to hide your face but wearing a name tag on your chest. **When you are logged in, Google does not need your IP address to know who you are.** They have your username. They track your search history, YouTube views, and map activity because you are signed into their ecosystem.

No amount of encryption can hide your data from the company you are directly interacting with.

# Fingerprinting helps them find you

You correctly identified that your browser extensions make you less private. This is a technique called **browser fingerprinting**.

Ad-tech companies build a profile of your device based on thousands of tiny data points, such as:

* Your screen resolution
* The fonts you have installed
* Your specific version of Windows or macOS
* **The specific combination of browser extensions you use**

The more extensions you install to protect yourself, the more unique your browser fingerprint becomes. It makes you stand out from the crowd. Even if a VPN changes your IP address every five minutes, your fingerprint remains the same. The trackers simply look at the fingerprint, see it matches the user from five minutes ago, and continue adding data to your profile.

# The myth of the IP address

There is a misconception that your IP address is the only thing linking you to your identity. While an IP is a unique identifier, it is a weak one.

You mentioned you are behind CGNAT (Carrier-Grade NAT). This means your ISP already shares your public IP address with hundreds of other neighbors. From the perspective of a website, you are already somewhat blended in with a crowd. While a VPN would hide your location more effectively, **changing your IP does not wipe your cookies or reset your browser fingerprint.**

# When is a VPN actually useful?

If you don't care about your ISP seeing your domain history, and you plan to keep using Google services while logged in, a VPN is largely a waste of money. However, there are specific scenarios where it is the only tool that works.

**A VPN is worth it if you:**

* **Use public Wi-Fi:** Coffee shops and hotels often have insecure networks. A VPN encrypts your traffic so hackers on the same network cannot snoop.
* **Need to bypass geo-blocks:** If you want to watch content restricted to another country.
* **Want to hide from your ISP:** If you live in a country with strict censorship or simply don't trust your internet provider.

If your goal is to stop Google or Facebook from building a profile on you, a VPN is the wrong tool. You would be better off using a privacy-focused browser like Firefox or Brave, installing an ad-blocker like uBlock Origin, and logging out of your accounts.",2,1766146037.0,PrivatePackets,0,1.0,False

How do I even begin this story without it turning into an analysis of my ex-boyfriend or my own mental state? A few things to mention first: we met on a dating app and had a really long, nice phone call. People often tell me that I rush into things and that I am pretty naive. He is two years older than me, and due to an injury as well as other past poor decisions, he decided not to return to school for an unknown amount of time to finish his degree.

He pressured me into dating him. I wanted to take things slower, but he kept asking and reassuring me that everything would be better if we just committed. Eventually, I did, reluctantly, because of how fast everything was moving. I met his friends and family very early on, which shocked me given the speed of the relationship. We became increasingly intimate. We took some time before having penetrative sex, and I am only sharing this because it is anonymous, but I had sexual trauma and still do. We worked through it slowly, though we were both very physically drawn to each other. We could not keep our hands off each other, and it is important to note that he lived in the same apartment as his mother.

As time passed, it became difficult to adjust to a dynamic where it felt like everyone had a say in our relationship. At times, I could overhear him complaining about spending money, even though he had been nonchalant about it during our first few dates. I was transparent about my situation. I was focused on studying, wanted to go to grad school, and relied mostly on my parents financially. Eventually, because I was constantly at his mother’s apartment and we were having sex all the time, and we only ever left to go on expensive restaurant dates, she lost her patience and kicked me out.

As this tension grew, so did the tension between his friends and me. They rebuked me, accusing me of being stuck-up or asking for too much, even though he never clearly communicated expectations around money or his ability to provide food outside of my campus. I wished he had been clear from the beginning. Was it wrong for me to expect to be fed when all we did for hours was switch between homework and sex while he switched between sex, video games, and alcohol?

At multiple points, he physically grabbed me by the collar to prevent me from leaving when I needed space. I remember breaking a nail while pushing him away because he wanted to get in my face and I just wanted personal space. Those moments made me feel trapped, scared, and completely disrespected.

I kept breaking up with him, and his friends would reach out, convincing me to take him back. I still question why I stayed. Was it because of the sex? Because I fell for him even though everyone told me he was not good for me? Did I attach because of intimacy? Did I convince myself he was the best I would ever do, or did I let him convince me of that?

Eventually, I grew resentful. He wanted constant contact and validation, checked my phone, and expected me to play nice with friends and family who clearly disliked me. Over time, it felt like he wanted me to be both a housewife and the breadwinner. I finally gave up and broke up with him for the eighth time.

To anyone reading this, I really tried. I tried to understand his financial situation, the scars from his only previous relationship, and how his parents’ divorce affected him. I tried to help him, and he tried to help me in his own way. Still, I became borderline suicidal because of how deprioritized and insecure his inconsistency and alcohol-like tendencies made me feel, tendencies that his family and friends enabled.

I love him deeply. But the stress of my major, my family being on my case after finding out about him, and my overall lack of support pushed me to pull the plug. I crashed out badly. I cut up his clothes, cussed him out through messages, lashed out at his friends, and completely lost control again. I drank alcohol, a Celsius, and a Starbucks coffee all together. I am not proud of this.

What I am trying to ask is this: how am I supposed to feel okay or have any sense of self-worth when the one man who treated me with some level of respect still fell miles short of a relationship worth my time and love? I clung to him so tightly that the day before the final breakup, I called him to pick me up just so I could have someone hold me and keep me from hurting myself. I really did love him. Who writes that many love letters to someone and is treated this poorly? I promise I was somewhat transparent about my mental health, but I just told him I wanted him to come pick me up because I needed him to hold me.

**TL;DR:** I met my ex two months ago. The relationship was very tumultuous. I am reflecting on it and wondering how to navigate romantic relationships better, so I don’t keep getting taken advantage of.

My sci‑fi novel begins on Mars with a communications engineer starting his day—no alarms yet, just heat siphoned from equipment brewing his coffee and a calm routine that hints something could go wrong. It’s deliberate, atmospheric… but is it enough?

I’ve always liked openings that build pressure in the silence: fragile systems, routines that matter, small details that could unravel. The tone aims for steadiness-with-shadows rather than fireworks. I’m wary of over-signaling (“danger is coming!”) and equally wary of being so understated that nothing feels at stake.

A concrete example from my draft: the coffee machine draws excess heat from the comms rack. It’s a nice bit of worldbuilding, but I use it to hint at dependency and vulnerability—if the heat loop hiccups, what else fails? The engineer enjoys the ritual precisely because it’s a measure of the system’s health. He tells himself “nothing has gone wrong yet,” and that “yet” is the fuse.

For those who write slower-burn sci‑fi or lit-leaning speculative work, how do you seed urgency without breaking the mood? Do you anchor tension in a character’s micro-conflict (a decision they’ve been avoiding), in a systemic fragility (infrastructure built on the edge), or with a single off-note in the environment? How do you decide when a quiet setup needs one sharper beat on page one?

1pqjcnt,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Smooth_Bathroom5769/comments/1pqjcnt/how_hungersate_supports_busy_city_lives/,How Hungersate Supports Busy City Lives?,"https://preview.redd.it/63mhlsy4a58g1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=044190f2674a87b46db93facaa6a25a52f54c70c

The pace of city life rarely slows down by choice. It slows down only when traffic forces it to, when rain blocks roads, or when exhaustion finally wins. Until then, everything moves: people move, work moves, deadlines move closer. And somewhere in between, food has to fit in.

Not fit perfectly, just fit.

For the millions that live in busy cities, eating is no longer a neatly planned part of the day. It’s woven into gaps. Between meetings. After long commutes. Before the next responsibility shows up uninvited. In this ever-shifting rhythm, platforms like Hungersate don’t feel like indulgences but more like a silent support system that adjusts to the pace rather than fighting it.

# City Time Works Differently

Time does not work in cities the way it does in smaller places. An hour can disappear without warning. A short errand can turn into a half-day affair. Schedules look organised on paper but unravel quickly in reality.

For this reason, meals seldom occur precisely when scheduled.

People eat late. Or early. Or in fragments. Breakfast is coffee. Lunch slips into evening. Dinner waits until finally, the house is quiet.

Hungersate reinforces such unpredictable timing by simply being there whenever people are. It does not expect meals to be traditional. It accepts the fact that city lives run on interruptions.

Food arrives when life allows it.

# The Real Issue Here Is Mental Load

Busy city lives are not only physically demanding, but they are also mentally crowded.

People juggle work expectations, social obligations, family responsibilities, and constant digital noise. Even when the body sits in an immobile position, the mind is sprinting.

In this state, choices of food feel heavier than they should. Choosing what to eat is another task added to an already overloading system.

Hungersate relieves this mental burden by providing familiarity and clarity. It does not require exploration or curiosity each and every time. It provides a chance for people to fall back on what they already trust.

That relief is more important than most people acknowledge.

# When Cooking Feels Like Another Job

Theoretically, many city dwellers love to cook. In practice, after a long commute or draining day at work, cooking can be a kind of unpaid overtime.

There's planning involved. Grocery shopping. Cleaning. Waiting. All of it uses energy that, for many people, is simply not available by evening.

This doesn’t mean people don’t care about what they eat; it means their capacity has limits.

This is where [Hungersate](https://hungersate.com/) steps in. It allows people to eat real food without turning dinner into yet another chore.

The support isn't dramatic. It's practical.

# Food that Matches City Energy

Alertness is demanded of city life. Heavy meals slow people down. Overly rich food makes afternoons harder. Not eating at all has its own drawbacks.

City eaters begin to notice patterns. What helps them function. What doesn’t.

Daily food choices become strategic.

Hungersate does this by providing food that feels balanced, familiar, and manageable. Not extreme. Not overwhelming.

Meals that enable one to continue their day, rather than recover from it.

# The Comfort of Familiarity in Fast Environments

Cities are always bringing in something new. New people. New expectations. New pressures.

Familiarity is grounding in this constant novelty.

It acts like a small island of certainty with familiar food. You know how it tastes. You know how it will make you feel. There’s no learning curve.

This predictability aids busy city lives.

To such a preference, [Hungersate](https://hungersate.com/) fits in naturally. It doesn't treat familiarity as boring; it treats it as necessary.

# Solo Living and Solo Eating

City living too often means living alone. Even when people share homes, schedules rarely align.

Eating together becomes occasional, not daily.

This changes the social and emotional function of food. Meals are no longer performances or gatherings. They are personal moments.

Hungersate supports this shift without judgment. The portions make sense. There's no assumption of sharing. No pressure to turn every meal into an event.

Eating alone becomes normal and not lonely.

# Late Nights & Irregular Hours

Cities don't sleep uniformly. Some people start their day early. Others end it late.

Eating patterns are reshaped by night shifts, creative work, global time zones, and long hours.

Traditional food systems struggle with this irregularity.

Hungersate supports city lives in tune with these uneven hours. Food becomes accessible even when schedules may be unconventional.

This flexibility means people eat when their bodies ask for it, not when the systems allow it.

# Emotional Exhaustion Requires Gentle Food

City life silently drains emotional energy: long queues, noise, crowds, and a continuous negotiation for space and attention.

Most people, by the end of the day, are emotionally exhausted—they just can't quite name why.

Food becomes emotional support in these moments.

Not indulgent food necessarily, just food that doesn't add stress.

Hungersate reinforces this necessity in the form of food that feels safe and comforting. Food that doesn’t surprise. Food that understands exhaustion.

# The Small Rituals that Keep People Sane

Even amidst chaos, people make rituals.

A regular order for lunch. A set dinner option for challenging days. A particular dish to signal the end of work.

These rituals bring structure into otherwise unpredictable days.

Hungersate becomes part of these personal rituals; these small habits are what, over time, anchor busy city lives.

They create moments of predictability when very little else feels predictable.

# Food Without Performance Pressure

Cities are great amplifiers of performance. How you dress. Where you eat. What you post.

Food can easily become a part of this performance.

But daily city eating rarely wants an audience.

Hungersate supports private, unperformed eating: meals aren’t for sharing shots of or reviewing; they’re for quietly eating.

This return to personal eating seems like relief for many city dwellers.

# Supporting Health Without Obsession

City lives don't leave much room for rigid food rules.

People want to eat well, but they do want flexibility. Some days are balanced; some are chaotic.

It echoes this very realistic approach towards health, where food is not moralized. It does not punish indulgence nor praise restriction.

Food becomes part of life, not some kind of separate project.

# Trust Matters Much More Than Speed Alone

City platforms often compete on speed: faster delivery, shorter wait times.

But speed without trust causes anxiety.

People want to believe that food is going to arrive correctly, taste familiar, and not disrupt their day.

This can be accomplished through consistency rather than urgency. Over time, such reliability becomes part of how people structure their days.

Trust becomes support.

# The Unspoken Role of Food in City Survival

Food keeps city lives moving.

It fills gaps. It stabilizes moods. It supports focus. It provides moments of rest.

This role is rarely acknowledged, yet deeply felt.

It does this by recognizing what part it plays in busy city lives, keeping aligned with that role, by fitting into habits, not reshaping them aggressively.

# Flexibility Over Ideals

City life constantly breaks ideals.

Perfect meal times, home-cooked dinners every night, and balanced plates daily.

People learn to let go of these ideals in favor of sustainability.

This flexibility is supported by Hungersate. It doesn’t require perfection. It supports survival, gently.

# Food as Quiet Infrastructure

In cities, infrastructure counts. Roads. Transport. Internet.

Food platforms are increasingly becoming part of that infrastructure.

They don’t attract any attention when they work well. They simply support life.

Hungersate functions in this quiet way, supporting busy lives without demanding acknowledgment.

# Why This Support Feels Natural

Hungersate does not feel like an interruption in city life; rather, it is an extension of it.

It understands unpredictability. It respects fatigue. It accommodates change.

It is this understanding that makes the support feel human and not transactional.

# FAQs

1. **Why do more city-dwellers depend on food platforms these days?** A busy schedule, long commutes, and mental exhaustion make flexible food access more necessary than optional.
2. **Does utilizing food platforms diminish healthy eating?** Not necessarily; many use platforms for regular, balanced meals when cooking isn't possible.
3. **How does Hungersate suit irregular city schedules?** It offers flexibility and familiarity; instead of having to follow fixed routines, people can eat at times that their day allows.
4. **Is Hungersate only about convenience?** No, it supports emotional comfort, routine, and reliability, too, in fast-paced city environments.",1,1766145597.0,u_Smooth_Bathroom5769,0,1.0,False

This is a home roasters cupping showcase, where participants roast the same green coffee (purchased collectively through Common Grounds Ottawa) and bring their best interpretation to a shared cupping table.

Why this format?

The goal is two-fold:

1. Roast feedback & skill development

Each roaster gets to:

\* Present their roast

\* Taste it side-by-side with others

\* Receive structured, thoughtful feedback from fellow home roasters. 

2. Learn how others approach the same coffee

Every participant shares:

\* Equipment used

\* Charge temps & roast curves

\* Airflow strategies

\* Roast goals

\* Lessons learned

Because everyone is using different machines and techniques, this is a rare chance to see how the same green coffee can produce very different flavour outcomes—and to connect with others using similar setups.

Event Format (90 minutes)

\* Welcome + short sensory intro

\* Brief technique talks from volunteer roasters

\* Guided cupping focused on how roast choices shape flavour

\* Open group discussion centered on learning, not judging

The tone is collaborative and exploratory—more like a culinary workshop than a social meetup.

Cost

\* Free for members

\* $25 door price for non-members

\* (Annual membership is $25, so joining at the door covers the whole year)

Details & registration: www.commongroundsottawa.ca

Limited to only 24 participants.

Here’s Why Its Famous Cities Stay With You Forever,"I’ve always heard Rajasthan described as “royal,” but visiting (or even deeply exploring) its cities makes you realize that this word barely scratches the surface. Every city in Rajasthan feels like it’s telling its own story—through forts, streets, food, and even the colors on the walls.

**Jaipur** is usually the first stop, and honestly, it sets the tone perfectly. The Pink City isn’t just about palaces like Hawa Mahal or Amber Fort—it’s the chaos of bazaars, the smell of street food, and the way history and modern life exist side by side. One moment you’re inside a centuries-old palace, the next you’re sipping coffee in a modern café overlooking a fort.

Then there’s **Udaipur**, which feels like Rajasthan taking a deep, romantic breath. The lakes, the sunsets, and the calm vibe are a total contrast to the desert heat elsewhere. Sitting by Lake Pichola in the evening, watching the City Palace glow, feels unreal. It’s easily one of the most peaceful cities in the state.

**Jodhpur**, the Blue City, hits differently. Mehrangarh Fort towering over the blue houses is one of the most dramatic sights in India. Walking through the old city lanes, you feel the raw energy of Rajasthan—loud markets, spicy snacks, and locals who are always ready to talk. Jodhpur feels bold and unapologetic.

**Jaisalmer** feels like a city out of a storybook. The golden fort rising from the desert, camel rides at sunset, and nights under the stars in the sand dunes are experiences you don’t forget. It’s touristy, yes—but still magical in its own way.

On the spiritual side, **Ajmer and Pushkar** add a completely different layer. Ajmer Sharif has a peaceful energy that draws people from all backgrounds, while Pushkar feels laid-back, artistic, and slightly surreal with its holy lake and desert-town vibe.

And then there’s **Bikaner**, often overlooked but surprisingly authentic. The forts are less crowded, the culture feels raw, and the food—especially Bikaneri snacks—is unbeatable.

What makes Rajasthan’s cities special isn’t just the monuments. It’s the feeling that history is still alive. People live inside forts, markets operate where kings once walked, and traditions haven’t faded with time.

If you’re planning a trip or just curious—don’t rush Rajasthan. Each city deserves time. It’s not just a destination; it’s an experience that stays with you long after you leave.

1pqj9vd,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pqj9vd,Esora - Singapore (Dec 2025) - Last Autumn Menu.,"Esora is a kappo-style restaurant in Singapore, helmed by Chef Takeshi Araki. It won its first Michelin star in 2021 and has held onto to it since then. Esora seemed to gain quite abit of traction during COVID and had quite alot of social media exposure as it seemed to be a favourite among the Singapore influencer crowd. It was always a place on my to-try list but I just never found the oppurtunity to visit amidst my frequent trips to Japan in the past few years. Sadly earlier in September, Esora announced that it would be shuttering its doors on 29 December. In a year of many fine dining closures in Singapore, Esora was another unfortunate victim. My wife and I really wanted to try before the doors closed a final time and so we made a dinner booking for our early Christmas celebration.

Esora is set in a heritage shophouse along Mohamed Sultan Road. The space itself was serene and gorgeous with minimalist vibes. There is a large counter surrounding the main kitchen area which brings you close to the cooking action, but table seating is also available.

Dinner was a nine-course autumn menu (there is also a cheaper 7 course menu). While Esora offers an alcohol pairing, Esora also offers a very unique tea pairing so we opted for that instead.

1. **Signature Foie Gras Monaka with Japanese persimmon and kumquat.** A delightful start. Crisp monaka shell, rich foie gras, and a clean balance of acidic and sweet from the fruits. A greater starter for an autumn menu.
2. **Signature Rice-Stuffed Chicken Wing with suppon sauce and shaved black truffles.** Earthy, smoky, and deeply comforting. The turtle-based sauce was thick and gelatinous, carrying a lot of umami. Truffle did not really add much to the dish but despite that still a great course.
3. **Hassun.** This consisted of five small items:

·        Yellowtail sashimi with onion and chrysanthemum

·        Dashi-soaked eggplant with lobster cream and uni

·        Akamatsu sushi (the one I liked best)

·        Deep-fried Shirako with turnip sauce

·        Japanese French pear with osmanthus wine jelly

This was an ok dish overall. Presentation felt a bit underwhelming, and I would have appreciated more explanation of how each element tied into the autumn theme. Hassun is usually where seasonality really shines, and this one didn’t quite land with me.

4.       **Snow Crab Somen**

Comfort luxury in a bowl. Came with lots of roe, deeply satisfying and very umami. I could have eaten another bowl without hesitation.

5.       **Amadai marinated in white miso, with white sesame sauce, radish and carrots**

Knockout dish of the night. Fatty amadai with impeccably crisp skin, paired with a nutty sesame sauce. Very French in technique and presentation. Outstanding.

6.       **Grilled Pigeon with garlic shoots, fried water chestnuts, and Jerusalem artichoke**

Umami-packed, smoky, and hearty. The pigeon was very juicy.

7.       **Snow Crab Donabe**

Another crab dish. Crabs for the night were all sourced from Kanazawa. Each dining group was presented with their very own donabe. Chef had added burdock root and shiso leaves in. Sweetness of the crab meat paired well with the earthiness of the burdock roots. We went for seconds immediately. My only complaint is that portion was way too small. Two tiny bowls felt unnecessarily restrained for a donabe this good.

8.       **Mizu Manju (pre-dessert)**

Japanese citrus pulp with Japanese wagashi jelly. Refreshing and tangy predessert but nothing to write home about.

9.       **Sake-lees soufflé with wasanbon ice cream and shaved white truffles**

Deceptively plain looking but this was dessert perfection. Easily the best dessert I’ve had at a Japanese fine dining restaurant. The jiggly soufflé was perfectly cooked, the wasanbon ice cream refined and not overly sweet, and the white truffle brought everything together and elevated the dish. Truly divine.

To close out our 3 hour dinner, we were presented with a teapot of oolong tea with pear and osmanthus, a sweet and calming tea to end our meal.

The tea pairing was also really good. It is not often you get tea pairing at a fine dining restaurant and it was a unique experience to try different types of infused teas throughout the meal (tea pairing menu pictured). The first five teas served cold and the last two hot. Each brought out different dimensions of the food and we felt it was a wonderful curated non-alcoholic pairing.

Chef engagement was minimal here. Chef Araki and his team stayed busy behind the counter throughout the meal and didn’t interact much with guests. This seemed intentional as the atmosphere leaned heavily towards serenity rather than hospitality theatre. The service team, however, was excellent. They were attentive, polished, and able to explain each course effortlessly.

Overall, this was a great meal where almost every dish slapped. On a bittersweet way, while Esora may be closing, it is leaving on a high note. Unfortunately, with the restaurant fully booked until its final days, anyone hoping for a last-minute reservation is likely out of luck.",0,1766145326.0,finedining,1,0.5,False

1pqj8zj,https://i.redd.it/4rbpo4rjg58g1.jpeg,SIBARIST BOOSTER 45,"SIBARIST BOOSTER 45 – Tool Review

FAQ

What is it made of?

A single small gold-plated piece.

What brewers is it for?

Designed for flat-bottom drippers.

How do you use it?

Place it at the base of the dripper, then put the paper filter on top.

Where is it from?

Purchased from the official Sibarist website.

Price?: 28$

What are the benefits?

	•	Increases extraction yield

	•	Shortens brew time

	•	Reduces bitterness (I’d say it almost eliminates it)

	•	Reduces astringency

	•	Even with higher extractions, these issues remain minimal

My experience & positives

This tool seriously impressed me. It solved a problem that previous drippers couldn’t sudden clogging with certain coffees. Even with high-fines coffees like Ethiopians, brew time doesn’t drag out unless I use a non-Sibarist filter.

Even when pairing this tool with Sibarist filters, expect fast extractions often under 2:30.

Can it be used with Kalita or Orea filters (wave or flat)?

Yes, absolutely. If you prefer a less aggressive flow, you can use the booster with a filter that has a more “normal” drawdown. With high-fines coffees, drawdown might still be a bit slower, but the flavor remains very good.

Negatives?

None.

And this isn’t hype there are genuinely zero flaws, whether manufacturing-related or otherwise.

Because the tool sits under the filter (not on top), concerns about difficult cleaning or clogging with fines don’t apply. Remove the filter, rinse the tool with the dripper, and you’re done 🦦 ready for the next brew immediately.

My personal rating

10/10.

It impressed me so much that I can’t do without it anymore. I now treat it as part of the dripper itself, not an accessory 😍.

In my opinion, it’s absolutely worth buying and trying especially for flat-bottom dripper lovers 🫡.",2,1766145239.0,pourover,5,0.67,False

How do I even begin this story without it turning into an analysis of my ex-boyfriend or my own mental state? A few things to mention first: we met on a dating app and had a really long, nice phone call. People often tell me that I rush into things and that I am pretty naive. He is two years older than me, and due to an injury as well as other past poor decisions, he decided not to return to school for an unknown amount of time to finish his degree.

He pressured me into dating him. I wanted to take things slower, but he kept asking and reassuring me that everything would be better if we just committed. Eventually, I did, reluctantly, because of how fast everything was moving. I met his friends and family very early on, which shocked me given the speed of the relationship. We became increasingly intimate. We took some time before having penetrative sex, and I am only sharing this because it is anonymous, but I had sexual trauma and still do. We worked through it slowly, though we were both very physically drawn to each other. We could not keep our hands off each other, and it is important to note that he lived in the same apartment as his mother.

As time passed, it became difficult to adjust to a dynamic where it felt like everyone had a say in our relationship. At times, I could overhear him complaining about spending money, even though he had been nonchalant about it during our first few dates. I was transparent about my situation. I was focused on studying, wanted to go to grad school, and relied mostly on my parents financially. Eventually, because I was constantly at his mother’s apartment and we were having sex all the time, and we only ever left to go on expensive restaurant dates, she lost her patience and kicked me out.

As this tension grew, so did the tension between his friends and me. They rebuked me, accusing me of being stuck-up or asking for too much, even though he never clearly communicated expectations around money or his ability to provide food outside of my campus. I wished he had been clear from the beginning. Was it wrong for me to expect to be fed when all we did for hours was switch between homework and sex while he switched between sex, video games, and alcohol?

I kept breaking up with him, and his friends would reach out, convincing me to take him back. I still question why I stayed. Was it because of the sex? Because I fell for him even though everyone told me he was not good for me? Did I attach because of intimacy? Did I convince myself he was the best I would ever do, or did I let him convince me of that?

Eventually, I grew resentful. He wanted constant contact and validation, checked my phone, and expected me to play nice with friends and family who clearly disliked me. Over time, it felt like he wanted me to be both a housewife and the breadwinner. I finally gave up and broke up with him for the eighth time.

To anyone reading this, I really tried. I tried to understand his financial situation, the scars from his only previous relationship, and how his parents’ divorce affected him. I tried to help him, and he tried to help me in his own way. Still, I became borderline suicidal because of how deprioritized and insecure his inconsistency and alcohol-like tendencies made me feel, tendencies that his family and friends enabled.

I love him deeply. But the stress of my major, my family being on my case after finding out about him, and my overall lack of support pushed me to pull the plug. I crashed out badly. I cut up his clothes, cussed him out through messages, lashed out at his friends, and completely lost control again. I drank alcohol, a Celsius, and a Starbucks coffee all together. I am not proud of this.

What I am trying to ask is this: how am I supposed to feel okay or have any sense of self-worth when the one man who treated me with some level of respect still fell miles short of a relationship worth my time and love? I clung to him so tightly that the day before the final breakup, I called him to pick me up just so I could have someone hold me and keep me from hurting myself. I really did love him, who writes that many love letters to someone and be treated this poorly.

I found this article discussing healthy caffeine alternatives that align perfectly with our kratom lifestyle.

**Key points from the article:**
• **Kratom**: Offers clean energy and focus for 4-6 hours, making it a great substitute for caffeine. This is perfect for those of us who need sustained productivity without the downsides of coffee.
• **Matcha Tea**: Provides calm alertness with added antioxidants, which can complement the clarity I often feel with kratom.
• **Golden Milk**: This soothing drink is anti-inflammatory and offers gentle energy—ideal for winding down while still feeling revitalized.
• **Lemon Water**: A great morning booster for hydration and vitamin C that pairs well with my kratom routine.
• **Yerba Mate**: A natural option that many kratom users might appreciate for its unique flavor and energy-boosting qualities.

In my experience, incorporating these alternatives alongside my kratom use has made a significant difference. I feel more balanced and avoid relying solely on caffeine for energy. Plus, it allows me to enjoy the benefits of kratom more fully without the interference of caffeine crashes.

For anyone in our community looking to enhance their energy levels naturally, exploring these alternatives could be a game-changer.

1pqj45f,https://www.reddit.com/r/dropshipping/comments/1pqj45f/i_discovered_emails_sent_from_firstnamewebsitecom/,I discovered emails sent from 'firstname@website.com' convert 3.1x better than 'hello@' - personal sender names massively outperform generic,"I changed my email sender name from ""hello@"" to ""sarah@"" and my revenue jumped 210% overnight.

Same list. Same subject lines. Same email content. Same everything.

Just changed who the email was ""from.""

And suddenly people started treating my emails like messages from a human instead of spam from a robot.

**The Moment I Realized I Was Being Ignored**

March 2024. I'm looking at my Klaviyo dashboard and feeling personally attacked by my own data.

Open rate: 18% Click rate: 0.9% Revenue per email: $47

I was sending to 23,000 people and making forty seven dollars per send.

For context, I was spending more on my Klaviyo subscription than I was making from the emails.

Everyone kept telling me my subject lines needed work. Or my copy was bad. Or I was sending at the wrong time. Or my list was dead. Or Mercury was in retrograde (okay nobody said that but I was starting to consider it).

Then I was at a coffee shop and watched someone check their email on their phone. They scrolled through their inbox, and I literally watched their eyes skip over anything that looked ""corporate.""

hello@brandname - scroll past support@company - scroll past  
sarah@smallbusiness - they opened it

And I had one of those moments where you realize you've been doing something completely stupid for months.

I was sending emails from ""[hello@ourbrand.com](mailto:hello@ourbrand.com)"" like I was a vending machine, not a person.

**The Test That Changed Everything**

I went home and set up the dumbest test I've ever run.

I took my next scheduled email - a basic ""new product launch"" announcement - and split my list in half.

Group A (11,500 people): From ""[hello@ourbrand.com](mailto:hello@ourbrand.com)"" Group B (11,500 people): From ""[sarah@ourbrand.com](mailto:sarah@ourbrand.com)""

Exact same subject line. Same email content. Same product. Same send time. The only difference was the sender name.

48 hours later I checked the results and had to refresh the page three times because I thought Klaviyo was broken.

[**hello@ourbrand.com**](mailto:hello@ourbrand.com) **results:**

* Open rate: 17.8%
* Click rate: 0.8%
* Revenue: $523

[**sarah@ourbrand.com**](mailto:sarah@ourbrand.com) **results:**

* Open rate: 52.1%
* Click rate: 4.7%
* Revenue: $1,847

The same email. To the same people. At the same time.

Just from a person's name instead of a generic inbox.

People opened it 3x more. Clicked 6x more. And spent 3.5x more money.

**The Part Where I Got Obsessed**

I couldn't stop thinking about it. Was this a fluke? Was my list weird? Did I just get lucky?

So I started testing everything. Every email type, every sender name variation, every possible combination.

I also started reaching out to other Shopify store owners and asking if I could run tests on their lists. Most people thought I was insane for caring this much about the sender name. A few let me run experiments.

18 months later I had tested 23,000 emails across 47 different Shopify stores.

The pattern showed up everywhere.

**Why This Works (The Psychology Part)**

When you see an email in your inbox from ""[hello@brandname.com](mailto:hello@brandname.com),"" your brain instantly categorizes it.

That's not a person. That's a company. That's marketing. That's spam. Delete.

You don't even consciously think about it. Your brain has learned that generic sender names mean ""someone trying to sell you something"" and you've trained yourself to ignore them.

But when you see an email from ""Sarah Johnson"" or ""[mike@brand.com](mailto:mike@brand.com),"" something different happens.

Your brain thinks ""oh, a person sent me a message"" and suddenly you're curious.

Is this about my order? Did I ask them a question? Do I know this person?

You open it to find out.

And here's the sneaky part - even after you realize it's a marketing email, you still read it differently.

You read it like someone is talking to you, not like a company is broadcasting at you.

I tested this with session recordings. People who opened emails from personal sender names spent an average of 47 seconds reading. People who opened from generic sender names spent 8 seconds before deleting.

Same email. Different name at the top. Completely different behavior.

**The Sender Name Types That Actually Performed**

After testing 23,000 emails, I grouped all the sender names into types and tracked performance.

***Personal First Name (***[***sarah@brand.com***](mailto:sarah@brand.com) ***or ""Sarah Johnson""):***

* Average open rate: 48.3%
* Average click rate: 4.1%
* Average revenue per send: $0.087

This was the consistent winner. Doesn't matter if it's the founder, a fake employee, or your dog's name. If it looks like a person, it works.

***Generic Role (hello@, info@, support@):***

* Average open rate: 16.2%
* Average click rate: 0.9%
* Average revenue per send: $0.019

This is what most stores use. It's also the worst performing by a massive margin.

***Brand Name Only (Brand Name or ""The Brand Team""):***

* Average open rate: 21.7%
* Average click rate: 1.4%
* Average revenue per send: $0.031

Better than generic but still way worse than personal. People don't have relationships with brands, they have relationships with people.

***Founder First + Last Name (Sarah Johnson or sarah.johnson@):***

* Average open rate: 51.9%
* Average click rate: 4.3%
* Average revenue per send: $0.094

Slightly better than first name only. The full name adds credibility, especially if your founder is somewhat known in your niche.

***Department Names (Marketing@, Sales@, Team@):***

* Average open rate: 14.1%
* Average click rate: 0.7%
* Average revenue per send: $0.015

Somehow even worse than generic [hello@](mailto:hello@). Nobody wants emails from departments.

The pattern was so consistent across all 47 stores that I started being able to predict performance just from the sender name.

**The Objections Everyone Has (And Why They're Wrong)**

Every time I tell someone about this, I get the same pushbacks.

***""But people will know it's not really from Sarah, it's automated""***

They know. They don't care. They still treat it differently.

I tested this by putting ""This is an automated email from Sarah"" in the first line. Performance dropped 8% but was still 2.8x better than generic senders.

People want to believe a human is involved somewhere, even if that human just wrote the template.

***""What if people reply and expect a response from that person?""***

Good. Let them reply. I tracked reply rates and emails from personal senders got 4.3x more replies, but 73% of those replies were positive (""love this product!"" or ""thanks for the discount"").

The negative replies (""why are you emailing me"") were actually LOWER with personal names because people were less annoyed by the email in the first place.

Set up your sarah@ email to forward to your support inbox. Problem solved.

***""Won't this hurt my brand by being less professional?""***

I tested this fear specifically. Asked customers in post-purchase surveys if emails from personal names seemed ""less professional.""

89% said they preferred personal sender names because it felt more ""authentic"" and ""like a real business.""

The only people who thought it was unprofessional were other marketers who'd been taught that branded emails are more ""legitimate.""

Customers don't think like marketers.

***""What if my brand IS the person? Like if I'm the founder and already use my name?*****""**

You're already winning. Keep doing it.

I tested famous founder names (like if you're Elon Musk emailing about Tesla). Even celebrity founders performed better with personal names than generic brand names.

People want human connection, even from brands run by famous humans.

**The Specific Patterns I Found**

After testing thousands of variations, some weird specific patterns emerged.

***Women's names outperformed men's names by 11%*** across all product categories, even in traditionally male categories like tools and automotive. Sarah beat Mike. Jennifer beat Chris. Every single time. I don't know why. Maybe women's names feel more trustworthy? More approachable? Less sales-y? No idea, but the data doesn't lie.

***Common names performed 18% better than unique names.*** Sarah beat Siobhan. Mike beat Maximilian. People's brains process common names faster and they feel more familiar. Weird, but true.

***First name only beat first + last name by 7%*** for casual brands (apparel, home goods, food). But first + last outperformed for professional/technical brands (SaaS, B2B, finance) by 12%. Match your name format to your brand personality.

***Using the actual founder's name added 8% more conversions*** when that founder was mentioned on the website or social media. If customers can ""verify"" that Sarah is real by finding her on your About page, they trust the emails more.

***Changing names every 3 months boosted opens by 23%*** compared to using the same name forever. I tested Sarah for 3 months, then switched to Mike, then to Jennifer. Each switch brought a small novelty bump. Don't overdo it though - monthly changes felt sketchy and hurt trust.

**What About Email Authentication? (The Technical Stuff)**

Here's where people get worried about DMARC and SPF and all that authentication stuff.

Good news: You can send from [sarah@yourbrand.com](mailto:sarah@yourbrand.com) with proper authentication. You're not spoofing anything.

You own the domain. You can create [sarah@yourbrand.com](mailto:sarah@yourbrand.com) as a real email address. Set it to forward to your support inbox. Use that as your sender.

Or just change the ""From Name"" in Klaviyo while keeping the same authenticated email address. Most email clients show the from name more prominently than the actual email address anyway.

I tested both approaches. Both worked equally well. The technical email address matters way less than the name people see.

**The authentication setup that worked:**

* Create [sarah@yourbrand.com](mailto:sarah@yourbrand.com) as a real address (even if it just forwards)
* Set up SPF records for your domain
* Set up DKIM signing in Klaviyo
* Keep DMARC set to ""none"" or ""quarantine"" while testing

You're not doing anything shady. You're just putting a human name on your legitimate business emails.

**The Email Types Where This Matters Most**

I tested this across every type of automated and campaign email. The impact varied by email type.

***Welcome series (first email after signup):*** Personal sender boosted conversion 4.1x. This is where first impressions happen. Starting with a personal name made people actually read the welcome email instead of ignoring it.

***Abandoned cart:*** Personal sender boosted recovery 2.8x. Cart emails already perform well, but personal senders made people feel like someone noticed they left and actually cared.

***Browse abandonment:*** Personal sender boosted conversion 3.4x. These emails are usually ignored, but from a personal name they felt like helpful recommendations instead of stalking.

***Post-purchase thank you:*** Personal sender increased repeat purchase rate 1.9x. Saying thanks from Sarah felt genuine. Saying thanks from hello@ felt automated.

***Win-back campaigns:*** Personal sender boosted reactivation 5.2x. This was the biggest lift. Trying to win back inactive customers from a generic sender is pointless. From a person? It feels like they actually miss you.

***Promotional campaigns:*** Personal sender increased revenue 2.9x. Sales emails are already promotional, but from a person they felt like a friend giving you a heads up about a sale.

The pattern held across every email type. Personal names won every single test.

**The Mistakes That Kill This Strategy**

I watched 12 stores try this and somehow make it worse. Here's how they screwed it up:

***Mistake #1: Using Obviously Fake Names***

One store used ""[Shaniqua@brand.com](mailto:Shaniqua@brand.com)"" for a company with zero diversity in their team photos. Another used ""Vladimir"" for an American surf brand. Customers aren't stupid.

Use a real name that matches your brand and team. If you're a solo founder named Mike, use Mike. Don't invent a Sarah.

***Mistake #2: Changing Names Every Week***

One store kept switching between different names trying to ""keep it fresh."" Customers got confused about who was emailing them and unsubscribe rates jumped 34%.

Pick one name. Stick with it for at least 3 months. Build familiarity.

***Mistake #3: Using Personal Names But Writing Like a Robot***

""Dear Valued Customer, We are pleased to announce..."" from [sarah@brand.com](mailto:sarah@brand.com) is jarring.

If you're sending from Sarah, write like Sarah is actually writing it. Use ""I"" and ""we"" and casual language. The tone has to match the sender.

***Mistake #4: Not Adding the Person to Your Website***

If you send from [sarah@brand.com](mailto:sarah@brand.com), put Sarah on your About page. Show her face. Give her a title. Make her real.

I tested this - stores with the sender on their website had 31% higher click rates because customers could verify the person existed.

**What To Do Right Now**

The setup takes 10 minutes.

Go into Klaviyo (or whatever ESP you use). Change your sender name from ""hello@"" or ""BrandName"" to a person's name. First name + last name. Make it real.

If you want to go further, create that email address ([firstname@yourbrand.com](mailto:firstname@yourbrand.com)) and set it to forward to your main inbox.

Add that person to your About page. Just a name, face, and title is enough.

Then watch what happens.

I've tested this 23,000 times. It works 89% of the time. The only stores where it didn't work were ones with already-insanely-high open rates (like 60%+) where there wasn't much room to improve.

For normal stores sending from generic addresses, this change alone usually adds 15-30% more email revenue within the first week.

**Introduction**

When strangers came from the stars, they did not come as invaders or as saviors as most had expected. They came as lost souls begging for a home. They did not come with technology the equivalent of magics, though they did have a mastery of cybertechnology, biotechnology, and space travel above our own. They came as beings of organic makeup, different, and yet, familiar. They came altered with cybernetics by unknown hands in ways that whispered of sorrow. Still though, they existed, and they did not talk of their pasts. They took on our cultures gleefully, but they did not speak of their own when they took on the role of teachers. We didn't ask, only caring for what we could know. Their technology was still made up of things we could understand, and things we quickly learned to grasp with their help. 

We did what we always did. Countries were put in competition to make the best of what the strangers had brought. The world was thrown into a short cold war, but one that ended as quickly as it had begun once the nations of the world realized that their new friends hadn't made them anymore than slightly smarter humans. Normalcy, as bad as it often is, quickly returned. Inequality remained and bad histories still existed to be made up for.

When strangers came from the stars, it really didn't change all that much. Curiosity blended and faded into acceptance or scorn depending on what the individual saw in the others. We learned some, but there were still things that our strangers wouldn't speak of. Horrors they didn't wish to share. We didn't ask, and they didn't tell us. I suppose nobody really wanted to know once everyone started to grasp knowing. We had ours, and that was what mattered to us. Time passed, and that was that, or at least I thought. Secrets kept have a habit of being leaked eventually though, and I just had to be the one to lure them out.

**Chapter 1 - Scene 1**

**Lilith**

A late autumn rain sprinkled against me as I ran down the road towards my destination. That being a Turkish shawarma eatery run by a Lebanese guy. He’d bought the place from the original owner, but the quality had remained, so the restaurant did too, and I was glad for it. It was a perfect place to meet an old friend on a Saturday afternoon. The friend was an alien that I'd come to know in the years after the discovery that we weren't alone. He'd grown accustomed to our home as we'd grown accustomed to his kind. To some, he was still a foreigner, or a secretive deceiver, but to me, he was a good friend who liked to eat and live free. 

That's why we were at the restaurant. We wanted to eat and speak freely to each other. Mediterranean food had become his favorite cuisine after his decade or so on Earth. He loved to eat, but I knew he could cook better than what the restaurant offered. How he’d learned, he refused to explain. Eventually, I’d learned to stop asking. 

I looked through the glass, as I was walking towards the door, and spotted my friend sitting in the booth furthest from the front. The doorbell jangled as I shoved my way into the restaurant to escape the rain. The owner, a man named Saeed, welcomed me with a weary smile. He was tired, I could tell. He usually was. He wasn’t a man that often slept, and I could always smell coffee on his breath. 

“Ah, hello there. Back again for the weekly getaway?” he asked. 

I nodded in response to answer his question.

“Good. Big Haddy is right there,” the owner said, pointing to his right. Hadrian was, indeed, where I had last seen him, sitting like a giant on a log. His dark brown fur was well groomed and his gray skin looked shriveled from the cold. 

“Thank you, Saeed,” I said, hiding a giggle. The traveler waved to me, as if to, once again, make sure that I wasn’t lost. 

“I see ya, Hadrian. I’m coming.” 

I quickly rushed over to him after drying my shoes on the welcome mat. Best not to track mud for no good reason. 

With a swift motion, I dropped myself onto the bench opposite of him and offered the courtesy of a greeting.   
  
“How’re ya doing, gato alto?” 

“Quite well today, Lemmy. Yesterday, I visited a local cultural center in my off time. I found it to be very intriguing. Although, it was also a little saddening.” 

“Which one was it?” I asked as Saeed brought us both a menu. 

“Drinks?” he questioned, to which we both answered with a request of mango flavored juice. 

“Ah, yes, it was the… hmm… I forget the exact name, but it was a cultural center for the native peoples of this area. The First Nations as they called themselves.” 

“Oh! In that case, yeah, I know what you’re talking about. Yeah, they probably taught you a bit about the Anishinaabe cultures, or what not. The Ojibwe, the Odawa, and the Potawatomi. Yeah, they are the natives of this state. First people to live here, I guess. If anyone has a right to live here, it’s them. The rest of us, well… that's an iffy topic. Personally, I choose to think that if you’re born somewhere, it’s your home. It’s where you were raised and where you adapt to. Doesn’t mean it’s always like that though. Sometimes people feel homesick for places they’ve never been. Ancestral connection, or something like that.” 

“Mhm. Well do you not have a right to live here? You look almost identical to the humans I saw there. Are you not also like them? Native to this land?” 

I looked up from the menu and froze for a second. That was a difficult question for me, and one I couldn’t entirely answer. 

“Not this land. I… That’s a difficult question to answer. Lots of violent history behind it. I guess, long story short, some of my ancestors were, but I’m not. My family lost the connection to the land, and to the people. We stopped being native as a result.” 

“Hmm. I see. Might I inquire further, or am I making you uncomfortable?” 

I sighed, “How badly do you want to know about this part of me?” 

He blinked a few times with his five black eyes. 

“I would like to know… Something tells me that I can help, or that you telling me will help something. If it would cause you pain though, I can leave it alone.” 

Taking a breath in, I was reminded of past experiences and scars on my psyche that had never fully healed. He was causing me pain, but I figured that I did owe him an explanation. 

“My people. My family, or at least my mom’s side of the family, we’re mestizo. We aren’t native. We’re kind of like a mix. Spanish blood and the blood of various different native groups. It wasn’t a voluntary union though. The Spanish did a lot of bad things, and hurt a lot of people. Part of that hurt led to my people, mestizos, coming into existence.” 

He nodded, asking for me to go on.

“We were the bastard children born from the unwilling wives of Spanish conquerors. Raised in Spanish culture and stripped of the identity of our native lands, or at least, that’s what my ancestors were. It doesn’t matter much anymore, even if it still causes me pain. I am not my ancestors. I’m not Spanish, native, or even Mexican. I’m just a pasty looking mestizo girl from the Midwest. I do my best to be an honest person, even if the circumstances of my existence are quite unfortunate.” 

“So why are you not native then? Is your blood not still tied to this land?” 

“It is, in a way, but by culture, I am not connected at all. I acknowledge the culture of my ancestors, but that’s generations upon generations ago. No native would call me a native, because I’m not a native, and neither were my parents or my grandparents. I don’t follow their traditions or know their ways beyond a few stories. It’s been two centuries since my family got assimilated, I think. We went from being Coahuiltecan, to Spanish, to Mexican, to Tejano, and then to American. There’s a lot of cultures between here and then. Some we chose to be a part of and some we didn’t. Regardless though, we did get broken from the culture that tied us here.” 

“Would you not seek to rejoin it? Would you not seek to have your right to this land be acknowledged?” 

“Heh. That’s something I struggled with for a long time, bud. Eventually, I just decided that, native or not, I have a right to be here. People like me, we have to carve out our own place in the world, you know? We aren't given a place otherwise. You have to be careful though. You can't carve out a place for yourself if it hurts the place of others. Otherwise you'd just be a Pilgrim.” 

He frowned, seeming deeply upset in a way I hadn’t seen him before. As he was brooding, Saeed brought us our drinks in their sealed cans. Hadrian quickly cracked his open.

“What’s wrong?” 

“Nothing. Let me collect my thoughts for a moment.” 

“Tell me what’s up, dude? I told you my stuff, so be honest with me.”

He took a sip of his can and then looked into my eyes with his right two. 

“How long have we been on this world, Lilith? How long have we been here, and yet not told a single truth?” 

“Uh… What?”

“I suppose that this place isn't all that different from home.” 

“Home? You never mentioned home.” 

“Home is a topic we don't speak of. It’s going on seventeen years now, my friend, and from the first day of our arrival in this system, it was agreed that we would bury what we had come from. It was agreed that we would not honor those who refused to honor us. We would come here, and join your peoples. Assimilate into your ways of life, and find peace.” 

“So what’s the big secret then, Hadrian?” 

“If I tell you, I’d be shunned by my own. I’d have no place among my people.” 

“Well someone has to say it eventually. Even if you are shunned, you’d still have us Humans. You’d have me. I’m not leaving.” 

“But my parents. My family.” 

“If they are good, then they will stick by you.” 

“Even good people often choose to cast away those who break, or who are broken from tradition. It is as you said in your own words. No native would recognize the native who breaks from their traditions.” 

“Well, I mean, not necessarily. There’s a lot more to it than that, but that’s native business. I can’t speak for them, and there's a lot of different kinds of them,” I said before pausing, “Look, you can keep your secrets. I get it. You want to keep tradition. In my opinion though, sometimes traditions need to be broken if they’re harmful, and I think you are hurting by keeping the truth bottled inside.” 

“You… I can’t say you have no idea, because you do. You know all too well, and I wish I could tell you everything.” 

“Then do. I won’t judge. I won't tell anyone either, and I doubt Saeed will listen.”  

He tilted his head down as snot dribbled from his equivalent of a nose. When he looked back up again, his eyes were shriveled, but held the pain of heartbreak most couldn’t know. 

“I'm sorry, Lily, but I cannot. Perhaps… No, nevermind. Let us eat, and forget these things which we're discussing. I'm hungry, and I’d bet that you are too.” 

“Hadrian, please, don't hurt yourself.” 

“I'm not. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to use the facilities.” 

And that he did, standing up to walk towards the very furthest back of the restaurant. I decided that I shouldn’t press him further, as curious as I was. It was his business, and although I knew it was hurting him and eating him up inside, I didn’t want to lose him as a friend by temporarily making the pain worse. Selfish, I guess, but ain’t I such a person. 

He shortly came back out and the conversation had ended. He opened up his menu and looked it over just before Saeed came back from dealing with other customers. We placed our orders. 

“Can I get the chicken shawarma in a wrap with tabouli, garlic sauce, and veggie feta?” Hadrian asked. 

Saeed answered, “Sure thing, and for you, Miss Clement?” 

“I’ll take the lamb kofta wrap with lettuce, tomato, spiced onions, turnip, and the spicy tahini sauce.”

“Your usual choice then? Hummus for both of your wraps?” the owner inquired, to which we both replied “Yes.” 

He nodded, taking our menus and leaving us together at the table. The silence was only slightly interrupted by the hum of crackling wood fires and fry bins in the background. Hadrian raised his can to his mouth and took a drink by the rim of the glass rather than using his straw. He looked at me, and opened his mouth to speak. He squeaked, but said nothing at first. I knew he wanted to bring up the conversation again, but he didn’t. He silenced himself and then said something else. 

“What are your plans for later tonight, Lilith?” 

“I don’t have much to do. I’m free. Why?” 

“Would you like to go drinking? I would like to. There’s a gay bar I’ve been going to a lot. I thought maybe we could go there, and that you would like it because of your choice in mates.” 

“Heh, I guess you’re a little right. Sure, we can go to the bar. What time?” 

“Anytime that works for you, but 7 at night would be the best time for me. I could pick you up at 6:30. We can take my car there, or your car if you want to pick me up instead. Mine has the more accurate self driving though.” 

“We’ll take yours.” 

“Okay…” 

“Hey, Hatter?” 

“What is it?” 

“It’s gonna be okay.” I said to him with a smile.

He weakly smiled back. I hoped that it would be okay, and that he wouldn’t make a liar of me.

1pqiwqf,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1pqiwqf/i_covered_for_my_little_brother_after_he_stole/,"I covered for my little brother after he stole, and now I can’t stand myself","Last month my 19 year old brother called me at 1:40am, whispering like he was in a movie. He said he was “in trouble” and needed me to come get him. I drove to this all night gas station on the edge of town, the one that always smells like burnt coffee and lemon cleaner. When I pulled up, he was sitting on the curb with his hoodie over his face, and there was a police car parked kind of sideways like it didn’t want to be seen. The clerk was inside pointing at the counter and talking fast. My brother had tried to walk out with a handful of stuff: a pack of cigarettes, two little plastic bottles of vodka, and those stupid “energy shots” by the register. He didn’t even do it smoothly, like there was no plan, just pure panic and impulse. The officer told me they hadn’t booked him, they just wanted him out of there and wanted the clerk to be paid back. My brother wouldn’t look at me. He just stared at the pavement like it was safer than looking at anyone’s face.



I went into big sister mode on autopilot. I apologized to the clerk like my throat was full of sand. I paid for everything, plus I tossed in a bag of ice and a bottle of water like that somehow made it more normal. Then I did the part that makes me feel sick: I tried to soften what happened with this little story about “confusion” and “he forgot he was holding it” and maybe the register didn’t scan right. The clerk looked at me like I was slime. The officer didn’t argue, he just wanted the situation over. My brother got in my car and mumbled “thanks” like I’d done him a favor, not like I’d just lied through my teeth for him. On the drive home he started talking about how this was “just once” and how he’s been stressed and how everybody at his job bets on sports and drinks after shift and it’s not a big deal. He asked me not to tell our mom  because she’d freak out and make it worse, and I said okay. Since then I’ve been lying like it’s nothing. I texted my mom  that he was with me late because my car battery died. I told my aunt he’s been doing better and looking into community college again, because she always asks and I always pretend it’s fine. My brother has been acting almost sweet, washing dishes without being asked, offering to run errands, like he bought himself a clean slate with my silence. But I keep seeing the clerk’s face, and my own mouth moving, making excuses that weren’t true. I feel like I didn’t protect my brother, I protected his addiction, or whatever this is turning into. And the worst part is I know why I did it. I didn’t want my mom to get that phone call. I didn’t want him to be “the one who got arrested.” I wanted to fix it fast and pretend we’re still a normal family. I hate that I did it, and I hate that part of me would probably do it again.

You aren't losing because you can't trade; you are losing because you don't understand the ""High-Water Mark.""","I kept blowing accounts despite having a 60% win rate and a decent risk-to-reward ratio. It didn’t make sense mathematically. I stopped looking at charts and started looking at the Terms of Service documents with a magnifying glass.

We need to talk about the mechanisms designed to make you fail. The industry average suggests that roughly 90% to 96% of traders fail these evaluations.

I realized I wasn't fighting the market; I was fighting a rigged mathematical framework and my own biology.

The Trap: Intraday Trailing Drawdown

Most of you think you have a $2,500 buffer on a $50k account. You don't.

If you are up $2,000 in open profit and the market pulls back $1,500 (a normal fluctuation), you haven't booked a loss. But under ""Intraday Trailing"" rules used by many firms, you just burned $1,500 of your drawdown buffer.

This rule forces you to trade perfectly. It creates a scenario where a winning trade that pulls back can cost you your account just as fast as a losing trade.

The Biology: Why You Cannot ""Willpower"" This

The rules are designed to trigger specific biological failures. I dug into the behavioral finance papers, and here is what is actually happening in your brain:

• Loss Aversion: Research shows that the pain of losing is psychologically twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. When that ""phantom loss"" happens (the pullback from your high-water mark), your brain treats it like a real financial death.

• The Disposition Effect: This is the tendency to sell winning trades too early to secure the dopamine hit, while holding losing trades too long to avoid the pain of realization. The prop firm rules weaponize this. They know you will choke your winners to avoid the trailing drawdown, destroying your Risk : Reward ratio.

• Decision Fatigue: Your brain is a battery. Neurocognitive research shows that sustained attention tasks lead to measurable drops in accuracy within just 20 to 30 minutes. By 11:00 AM, your ""discipline"" is chemically depleted. When your executive function dies, you revert to impulse trading.

The ""Institutional"" Fix: External Governance

You cannot out-think your own biology. I stopped trying to be a ""disciplined monk"" and started acting like a risk manager at a bank.

Institutions do not trust their traders. They implement ""kill switches"" and hard automated rules because they know human discretion is the biggest risk.

• Hard Stop Enforcement: I stopped using mental stops. If you can't honor a mental stop, you must use a hard stop on every single trade.

• The 1% Rule: I mathematically capped my risk. Betting more than 1-2% per trade is statistically guaranteed to hit the max loss limit during a standard variance streak.

• The Cool-Down: I forced a mandatory break after a loss. Physically stepping away breaks the ""tilt"" loop that leads to revenge trading.

The Solution (My ""Cheat Code"")

I realized I couldn't calculate the dynamic trailing drawdown or monitor my fatigue levels in my head while scalping. My brain was too busy fighting the urge to revenge trade.

So, I built a simple dashboard (TradeApollo) to do the thinking for me.

It acts as an external risk manager. It tracks my actual prop firm drawdown in real-time, tick-by-tick, and logs my emotional state before I enter a trade. It creates a ""logic gate"" that forces me to stick to the rules even when I want to gamble.

On paper, I had a 58% win rate and a 1:1.5 Risk-to-Reward ratio. Mathematically, I should have been profitable. In reality, I was hitting the daily loss limit consistently.

It didn't make sense until I stopped looking at the charts and started reading the Terms of Service with a magnifying glass.

We need to stop blaming our ""discipline"" and start understanding the **""Intraday High-Water Mark""** (or Trailing Drawdown).

**The Mathematical Trap: Equity vs. Balance**

Most retail traders manage risk based on **Balance** (closed trades). Prop firms (especially futures firms like Topstep or Apex) manage risk based on **Equity** (open floating P&L).

Here is the trap most of you are falling into without realizing it:

1. You enter a trade. It goes up +$1,000. You are happy.

2. The market retraces. You stick to your plan and close the trade at +$200 profit.

3. **In your mind:** You made $200.

4. **In the Prop Firm's algorithm:** You lost $800.

Because your ""Trailing Drawdown"" moved up with your open equity peak (the High-Water Mark), that $800 retracement ate directly into your drawdown buffer. You are penalized for normal market breathing.

**The Biological Failure: Why ""Willpower"" Cannot Fix This**

This rule isn't just annoying; it is weaponized behavioral finance. I dug into the research (specifically Kahneman’s *Prospect Theory* and studies on the *Disposition Effect*), and here is why your brain physically cannot handle this rule:

• **The Disposition Effect:** We are biologically wired to sell winners too early to ""lock in"" safety, but hold losers too long to avoid the pain of realization \[Source: The Decision Lab\]. The Trailing Drawdown rule forces you to succumb to this. You start choking your winning trades to avoid the drawdown creeping up, which destroys your Risk:Reward ratio.

• **The ""House Money"" Effect is a Lie:** When you are up $1,000 floating, your brain treats that as ""your"" money (Endowment Effect). When it drops to $200, your brain registers a **loss** of $800, not a gain of $200. This triggers **Loss Aversion**.

• **System 1 Takeover:** This ""phantom loss"" triggers a cortisol spike. Your prefrontal cortex (logic/System 2) shuts down, and your amygdala (fight or flight/System 1) takes over. You immediately enter a high-risk trade to ""get back"" the $800 you never actually banked.

**The Institutional Solution: Automated Governance**

I looked at how firms like Jane Street and institutional desks handle this. They do not tell their traders to ""just be more disciplined."" They operate under a **""Trust Deficit""** model.

They assume the human will fail.

They implement mandatory **""Pre-Trade Controls""** and **""Kill Switches""**. If a risk parameter is breached, the server cuts the line. The trader has no say in it.

**How I Fixed It (The Engineering Approach)**

I realized I couldn't calculate dynamic equity drawdown in my head while scalping. My brain was too busy fighting the dopamine urge to revenge trade.

I stopped trying to be a monk and started acting like a risk manager. I built a risk terminal (TradeApollo ) to act as an external hard drive for my discipline.

1. **Visualized High-Water Mark:** It tracks the *actual* prop firm drawdown tick-by-tick. It shows me exactly how much ""breathing room"" I have left based on the equity peak, not my balance.

2. **The Hard Kill Switch:** If I hit my daily loss limit (calculated on equity), it doesn't send me a notification. It physically terminates the trading platform process. It forces the ""cool down"" period that my dopamine-depleted brain refuses to take.

3. **Static Risk Sizing:** It forces me to size based on my *stop loss distance*, not my ""gut feeling.""

**Conclusion**

You are trying to play a strategy game, but the prop firms are playing a psychological warfare game. You cannot beat an algorithm that weaponizes your own biology by using ""willpower.""

Willpower is a battery that drains by 11:00 AM (Decision Fatigue). You need to mechanize your defense because the house has already mechanized their offense.

President Donald Trump on Thursday [signed into law the National Defense Authorization Act, which authorizes $900.6 billion in funding for the Pentagon](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/2025/12/congressional-bill-s-1071-signed-into-law/) and national security programs in fiscal year 2026.

The White House said Thursday the FY 2026 NDAA would authorize appropriations for Department of War military construction efforts, intelligence programs, Department of Energy national security initiatives and State Department programs, among others.

“The Act will enable the DoW to carry out my Peace Through Strength agenda, protect the homeland from domestic and foreign threats, and strengthen the defense industrial base, while eliminating funding for wasteful and radical programs that undermine the warfighting ethos of our Nation’s men and women in uniform,” [Trump said in a statement](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/2025/12/statement-by-the-president-7598/) published Thursday.

The president noted that the NDAA codifies parts of more than a dozen executive orders and actions from his administration, including measures related to warfighter lethality, missile defense initiatives such as the Golden Dome for America and airspace sovereignty.

The move came a day after the [Senate voted 77-20 to pass the defense policy bill](https://www.executivegov.com/articles/ndaa-fy26-senate-passage). On Dec. 10, the [House approved the FY 2026 NDAA](https://www.executivegov.com/articles/house-ndaa-fy26-pentagon-spending-bill) in a 312-112 vote.

# What Are the Proposed Acquisition Reforms in FY26 NDAA?

Breaking Defense reported that the [defense policy measure includes major acquisition reforms](https://breakingdefense.com/2025/12/senate-passes-901b-defense-authorization-bill-with-major-acquisition-reform-push/), including the adoption of a “portfolio acquisition executive model” and requirements to streamline the process for new entrants and commercial firms seeking to do business with the Pentagon. 

According to the report, specific initiatives include the removal of compliance requirements for small firms, consideration of off-the-shelf platforms and establishment of the Bridging Operational Objectives and Support for Transition, or BOOST, program within the Defense Innovation Unit to help companies with operationally viable platforms transition to the production phase.

The NDAA also authorizes $26 billion for shipbuilding, $38 billion for aircraft, $25 billion for munitions and $4 billion for ground vehicles.

Thank goodness the Trump administration and technology-savvy congressional leaders (in both parties) agree on one very key strategic issue vis-a-vis Communist China: America must close the rare earth gap.

The 17 rare earth minerals — also called rare earth elements (REEs) — are fundamental to digital modernity. REEs possess irreplaceable catalytic, magnetic, conduction and luminescent properties vital to manufacturing digital-age essentials such as smartphones, computers, medical imaging equipment, advanced batteries, etc.

The Cold War had its bomber gap, followed by the missile gap — ""gaps"" in the number of strategic offensive weapons possessed by the East and West. In the early 1950s, Washington believed the Soviet Union had the advantage in deployed long-range, jet-powered, nuclear-capable bombers. Eventually, aerial recon imagery revealed Russia had no edge. However, the 1957 Sputnik satellite launch provided a strong indication that Moscow had a big advantage in long-range, large-payload ballistic missiles — the missile gap.

The U.S. caught up — by manufacturing and fielding superior systems.

However, it's the 21st century. Today, manufacturing virtually all high-tech military weapons and communications systems requires REEs, from vital strategic sensors (e.g., satellites and radars detecting enemy missiles) to the command and guidance systems on offensive weapons.

Unfortunately, the U.S. is once again playing a serious game of catch-up.

Communist China has become a rare earth monopolist. Well, not quite a monopolist, but China is definitely the overwhelmingly dominant political actor in the mining, refining and distribution of rare earth minerals essential to modern digital and electronic tech.

How did it happen? Washington let it. The Epoch Times recently noted that, until 1991, the U.S. ""was a leading producer of rare earth minerals ..."" But environmentalist objections led to the closure of major mines. China stepped in.

Fair question worth investigating: Did Chinese strategists encourage and perhaps fund U.S. environmental and climate extremists? Cold War Moscow's intelligence agencies used Western peace and disarmament activists to try and shake Western resolve.

Beijing has also targeted some not-so-modern military essentials. China has gained production and/or market control of other critical minerals, including trisulfide, a type of antimony used in manufacturing bullet cartridge primers — as in the ignition of a simple rifle bullet. Reuters recently reported that the U.S. had not domestically manufactured trisulfide since the 1960s.

I credit this to Red China's deep strategy, which I summarize as this: Beijing does not want to risk a shooting war with the U.S. (""kinetic war"" in Pentagonese). Goodness, the U.S. is China's biggest market. Post-Tiananmen Square, the communist dictatorship's deal with the Chinese people is they can have smartphones and MacBooks and American pork — the goodies of modernity — as long as they shut up and let the Politburo rule.

Trading high explosives with your biggest market is bad for business. However, Beijing has a deep case of ethnic Han Chinese Middle Kingdom imperialism. Emperor Xi really wants to become the world's superpower.

So, Beijing plays a long game: Surpass the U.S. as the world's leading manufacturer, and gain control of essential minerals to the point it can deny modern manufacturing essentials. On the dirty side, China wages disintegrative warfare against the U.S. by supplying drug cartels with fentanyl and encouraging open U.S. borders.

Another fair question: Has Beijing helped fund the ""defund the police"" and ""no cash bail"" movements?

How does America respond? The Trump administration has reached mineral deals with several nations, including Australia, Malaysia and Japan. Reopening domestic ""mothballed"" REE mines has to happen. How long will that take? Likely a decade or more. Cost? Probably hundreds of millions. But reshoring REE production is a must.

Brilliant research may have opened a readily accessible domestic mine that's an interim solution: graveyards of old electronic and digital equipment. The Epoch Times reported that Rice University chemist and nanotechnologist James Tour ""has pioneered a way to quickly extract rare earth metals"" from ""electronic waste"" (discarded electronics).

He uses a process called ""flash Joule heating,"" rapidly heating the valuable junk ""to thousands of degrees to vaporize the metals ..."" A chemical process then extracts individual REEs.

Tour claims a flash Joule heating facility can be up and running for ""a few tens of millions of dollars."" I'll donate a very dead Compaq Deskpro to the cause.

**IMHO\~Why the FY 2026 NDAA Matters for NioCorp (and Why 2026 Keeps Coming Up)**

With the FY 2026 NDAA now signed into law, the U.S. has formally doubled down on programs that *cannot function* without secure supplies of **Niobium, Scandium, Titanium, and magnetic rare earths**—the exact suite NioCorp is designed to produce at scale. Missile defense (Golden Dome), NGAD, hypersonics, space systems, and advanced naval platforms all require materials that the U.S. currently sources overseas or not at all. The NDAA doesn’t fund individual projects directly, but it sets the Pentagon’s priorities—and those priorities now clearly favor **domestic, vertically integrated supply chains** over fragmented foreign sourcing.

That policy shift is why financing pathways like **EXIM Bank, DPA Title III, and allied export credit agencies** are suddenly realistic execution tools rather than distant possibilities. **NioCorp isn’t asking the government to take a leap of faith—it’s finishing the technical and economic validation needed to unlock those tools!** Updated drilling assays, the final DFS, and downstream alloy work (via NAMA and partners) move Elk Creek from “resource story” to “industrial solution.” Once that happens, government-backed financing isn’t political—it’s procedural.

This is also why management keeps emphasizing **timing and scale**. Elk Creek isn’t a short-cycle mine; **it’s a generational asset with multiple critical minerals feeding multiple defense and clean-tech platforms.** The FY 2026 NDAA strengthens the backdrop for a 2026 FID not because it guarantees funding, but because it aligns national defense priorities with what NioCorp actually produces. In that context, **“2026 is the year” isn’t hype—it’s the point where policy, validation, and capital finally intersect.**

***This is how we rebuild U.S. materials sovereignty —*** not one metal at a time, but with a single project that brings SEVEN critical minerals into four critical defense mineral chains back onshore at once!

**When the dust settles, Elk Creek won’t be “a mine.” It will be a cornerstone of the U.S. national security ecosystem.**  
The U.S. is signaling it. EXIM just confirmed it. And the global critical-mineral bottleneck is about to meet its first American challenger in decades.

My wife (also early 30s) has a gambling problem that started with “just sports” and then slid into online casino stuff. Two years ago it got bad enough that we almost lost our apartment because rent money kept “vanishing” in tiny transactions. She went to therapy, put herself on self-exclusion lists, and we set up a boring system: her paycheck goes to her own account, our bills come out of a joint account, and we do a weekly sit down with coffee and look at the budget. It was not fun, but it worked. For a long stretch she was solid, and I actually started to relax again.

Last week I noticed our joint debit got declined at the grocery store, which was weird because payday had hit. When I checked the banking app later that night there were a bunch of charges to payment processors I recognize from the bad times, like $19.87, $42.10, $9.99, just nonstop. I asked her and she swore it was “a mistake” and she’d call the bank in the morning. Then I saw the same names on her phone notifications. She tried to grab the phone away and said I was snooping, but she literally had asked me before to keep an eye out if things ever looked off again. I was mad and honestly kind of panicked. I logged into the bank app, froze the joint cards, and changed the password. I also deleted the betting apps off her phone while she was in the shower. Yes, I know that part looks controlling, but I was thinking if the apps are there, she’ll just keep hitting them. She woke up, found out, and went nuclear. She called me a “warden,” said I humiliated her, and that she’s an adult and I can’t police her. She slept at her sister’s and now her whole family is texting me that I’m abusive and financial controlling. Meanwhile I’m staring at our rent due in 10 days and feeling like a sucker for trusting anything.

I didn’t drain her personal account or take her paycheck. But I did freeze the joint cards and I did delete those apps without asking in that moment. AITAH for stepping in hard when I saw the relapse, or did I cross a line and make it worse?

Hi. Long-time lurker, first-time poster. I’m here looking for marriage, not something vague or open-ended. That said, I do believe it should still be enjoyable and not feel like a transaction.

The Basics

Age: 32

Height: 5’3”

Location: Delhi 

Religion: Hindu

Marital Status: Never married

Diet: Vegetarian


Work & Education

Education: Master’s degree

Profession: Consultant

I’ve lived for a few years in the UK and currently work in Delhi. Having experienced the difference in work culture and balance, I do want to move out again at some point, and I’m looking for someone who’s open to that.


About Me

I’m someone who does pooja-path and also likes dressing up well. I'll drag you to a lot of Mandirs but also nice date nights to dress up and hit the town! Both sides coexist comfortably, and I’d like someone who appreciates that without expecting me to be just one thing.

I take my work seriously, but not at the cost of joy. I believe relationships work best when two people are not a hindrance to each other’s paths, but collaborative and supportive while building alongside each other.

I value peace and emotional calm. That said, I do come with nakhre. Plenty of them. I’m looking for someone who finds my nakhre endearing and can match my energy, while tolerating my nakhre.

Also important. I am absolutely feral about dogs. Long term, I want to open an animal sanctuary. This is not a passing interest. If dogs are not your thing, we won't gel well. If they are, we will probably get along fine.

Lifestyle & Interests

I work out 3 to 4 days a week. Strong, curvy, and yes, I enjoy food

I like dancing and genuinely need coffee to function

I try to sneak protein and fibre into most meals

I enjoy cooking and would love someone who enjoys the kitchen too

I value balance. Movement, rest, effort, and good meals


What I’m Looking For

Age range: 29 to 38

Height: 5’9” and above

Religion / Community: Hindu, Jain, Sikh

Physically active. Bonus points if you can deadlift more than me

A man of his words, intellectual!

Emotionally sorted, communicative, and kind

Open to relocating abroad in the future

Someone who views marriage as a partnership and genuinely wants to be a husband and a father. 


Non-Negotiables

Vegetarian or willing to be. I want my child to be raised vegetarian.

Clear intent toward marriage

Dog lover 

Respect for work, values, and long-term goals

Ambitious and family oriented

Not in a rush, but definitely serious.

I would love to meet kind-hearted, genuine people who enjoy good conversation and shared interests. A few things I am especially into:

* Politics, international affairs, and humanitarian topics
* Film, watching, talking about it, screenings
* Music. Punk, electronic, classical, and going to live shows
* Coffee or a beer and an easy, thoughtful chat

Nothing formal. No club, no pressure. Just meeting people, seeing what clicks, and letting things grow naturally.

If any of this resonates and you would be up for a coffee, a drink, or catching a show sometime, feel free to comment or DM.

There is also a fun show tonight at Madame Claude. If anyone is already going or wants to join, let me know.

I have an old friend I've been avoiding because for years it was all about her and I got tired of it. She downplayed my successes and always found a way to make every moment about something she has been doing or experienced.

She recently returned to my area for a visit and asked to meet for coffee. I told her that I wasn't feeling so sociable at this time, but maybe in the New Year. (Not unusual for me. I'm known for being a hermit).

Today is my birthday and I saw a ""Happy Birthday"" message pop up from her. I haven't opened it fully, so she isn't aware it was seen.

A few moments ago I received another message about a mutual acquaintance (that I last saw about 10 years ago, and probably the same for her), had passed away last night.

...there is a big part of me that wonders if she sent this message in order to kind of sh*t on my day..or if it was just a clueless thing to do.

I cannot for the life of me imagine why anyone would send a message like that on someone's special day, unless it was something urgent. As much as I am sad about the passing of an old acquaintance, and feel awful about sounding selfish, I don't understand why this couldn't have waited one day. If the roles were reversed, I would have written the next day to tell her the sad news and that I didn't want to tell her right away because it was her birthday.

Am I the one in the wrong here?

I'm second guessing myself.

I feel awful for thinking this way also (about her and also about not wishing to hear about his death on this day). Am I being selfish?

I could really use some feedback..please

1pqihv4,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1pqihv4/mfthe_deadline/,[MF]The Deadline,"“You need to finish this thing by today night. If you dont…you certainly will pay for it.” said the old boss, pointing his finger angrily at Ramesh. Ramesh still stuck in his seat in front of his laptop lowered his head continuously out of embarrassment. “Look at me,”frowned the boss,”If not tomorrow then there will be no tomorrow for you in this office.” Ramesh slowly looked up with wide, fearful eyes, his entire body shaking and spoke softly,”S-S-Sure sir, tomorrow it is.”

He then looked around, noticing the mocking faces of his colleagues .”They all must be thinking bad about me,that I am a loser that I am a weak,submissive male, that I can easily be dominated….dominated,”he repeated it as though possessed. One of his collegues, Sheethal, a south-indian and known as one of the rude women in the office circles observed still looking in her comp\[uter typing something and adjusting her spectacles like an honest hardworking employee,”Well if you are not disciplined enough, you will suffer the consequences. I dont understand why the youth of today hates to work…I to(in hindi) loves it anyhow,” she smiled and started typing a little faster. At once, she was hushed by her friend to speak no more, but alas! the words did their job

Ramesh, as if ignoring her, got up swiftly from his seat looked contemptuously in her direction and dashed through the door. “How can she say such a vile thing. I…I don’t deserve it..That ugly cunt..” he whispered under his breath, his face all fired up. He threw his laptop bag into his car and drove straight for his home. On his way home, he got involved in a fight with a man regarding the traffic signal. He shouted angrily,”why were you honking despite knowing that it is still red.” The man shrugged his shoulders and smirked, to which our IT employee punched him in the face. It took a group of men to end this brawl, while the two men still hurled abuses at one another.

On reaching home, Ramesh took his laptop and threw it on the bed where he himself settled down. “How can he be so vile to me? “You will pay for it” Agh!! What does that even mean? How cruel! How can they allow such words in the office premises? Is it not harassment?” he said completely exhausted. Grabbing his sheet in rage, he git up suddenly went to his laptop and started typing in Ms-Word swiftly: HARRASMENT…HARRASMENT…HARRASMENT. As soon as he was about to write it the fourth time, his mobile rang.

He looked with red eyes towards his phone and shouted gritting his teeth, “Who the hell is that?” It was the boss. For a moment his rage subsided and was replaced by a sudden urge to submit. “Hello! Yes boss!” he spoke softly. “Remember chap if tomorrow the work is not complete, then you will witness something you really dont want to!” He didnt say anything but only looked gloomily towards the word written on his laptop.

After this short conversation and swallowing his anger he sat at the table and launched the VDI. Throughout the night, as if he was glued to his chair Ramesh somehow finished his assignment. Although he felt panicked at every moment but somehow his ego and rage combined provided him with a necessary kick to accomplish his task.

The very next morning, and with a smug satisfaction he sat in his car thinking, “ I am gonna say it directly to his face like a true champion that here I am with your work and I completed it. And then would enjoy the look at his little surprised face, while I be basking in my glory. Yes!!” And with this confidence our hero parked the car in the office parking and adjusting his laptog bag on his shoulder and fixing his ID card on his neck went straight to the manager’s cabin.

He peeped inside and asked for his permission, “MAy i come in?” The manager was busy writing something while holding his mobile in one hand. He slowly looked up and made a gesture suggesting Ramesh to come in and sit in front of him. With his chest out and head held high, he entered the large cabin with a pleasant smell, which was adorned with lots of bouquets on the manager’s table and beautiful wall paintings.

Before settling on the chair, Ramesh looked around himself once with awe. The manager put his mobile aside and with a smile, as if he was mocking Ramesh, asked him,” I suppose you have complete the work chap.” Ramesh replied with a sense of confidence,”Yes sir and with full details.” This surprised the manager a bit to which he slowly said,”O—okay and show me it.”

Ramesh pulled the laptop out of his bag and connecting with the VDI again opened the PPT that read: On Splunk architecture. The manager took the laptop from him and with full attention was going the entire ppt. After a while he gave out a sly smile and with an absolute boldness pointing his finger towards a slide in the PPT asked Ramesh the spelling of Replication factor. He spelled it out, rather shockingly,”RAPLICATION…”.” Well Sir! if you said that you have done the work keeping in mind the details how can you miss an ‘‘I” over here . He showed the slide to him.

Ramesh now a slightly embarrassed, asked the manager to give the laptop back to him so he could rectify it. The manager in his usual sly smile replied,”Wait ! Wait! I am possibly sure this is not everything!” and he started going through the slide again. “Ahh!! behold this yet again something you mentioned wrongly. Our environment used 221 forwarders. You casually mentioned 200. Now, answer this one.”

Ramesh shrugged his shoulders, ‘‘Is that relevant?” “Relevant!! are you asking me this. I am the manager of and I manage 50 people like you. Now a question to you sir,” he adjusted himself comfortably in his chair, “were I to present this PPT to the leadership which I will do and If I present them something which is factually incorrect. WHat do you think they will think of me chap?”

Ramesh totally losing his confidence by now replied anxiously, his legs shaking, “I-I-I am sorry. I thought that the count of forwarders was not that important.” “Haahha! Are you for real. The forwarders get the raw data in splunk and you say if i say 30 of them less it is allright.” The manager furious by now asked Ramesh to get up from his chair. Nervous and shuddering Ramesh got up adjusting his I-card.

“ You don’t sit until I tell you to. Now let me go through your so called detailed work again. “ Half an hour passed and manager was busy or maybe pretending to be busy going through his PPT. In the meantime he used to get up from his chair stretch his arms sip his coffee call upon his attendant and some other employess, who used to look at Ramesh with perplexity making him feel more nervous and embarrased. And he was just standing there like CasaBianca submitting to the boss’s orders.

“Hmm! now you can sit chap and I want you to prepare anothe PPt right from scracth and include atleast 25 slides. And i want you to email me by night.” Ramesh worn-out by now slowly lifted his head and looking in the eyes of his boss uttered,”HARRASMENT”. “HARR what? What the hell you saying?”

He repeated again, this time more distinctly, “HARRASMENT” leaving his boss a little shocked. The manager with his usual sly smile and sipping his coffe, as if he was trying to calm himself down regained his composure and said,”Well its time for you to calm down and leave my cabin. Finish your assignment and mail me. Do as I say . Off you go Ramesh.”

There was an absolute silence. Ramesh was still standing like a statue and said nothing, only looking towards his boss. It was now getting uncomfortable for the manager. But before he could say anything, an eerie smile broke out on Ramesh’s face and he whispered under his breath, “ You are a harasser of the most original kind. You are humiliating me and will continue to do so if I don’t stop you.”

Having said this, Ramesh at once went towards the door and locked it tightly. Slowly he returned towards his seat pulled it and sat on it with an air of authority. With a stern voice he said, ”Look! I dont know what you think of me and neither do I care, but I command you to stop your shit right now or there will be consequences. The manager was looking at him with an expression of fear and irritation.

He continued, ”We employees are humans not resources, as you think of us. We have our personal lives beyond work. We have a family to take care of , need to look after our health, have our own paasions and hobbies. We can’t be burdened with so much work or I should rather put it by your sense of superiority that we find peace a challenge. As a human, I have full right to protect my peace, and I will do it despite the consequences.” He paused, sighed, and sat back on his chair.

The manager gripped with frustration by now, got up and with a red face yelled at him, “Don’t you dare teach me about work-life balance. I exactly know what you are doing. You are play-acting, trying to be a bloody victim. The reality is you can’t work at all. Why do you think i didnt promote you this year. It was totally becauase you cant work at all.”

Ramesh who was looking fixedly in the manager’s red eyes, took a pause,as he was reflecting on something, then said boldly, ”No! No! No! it’s not that I can’t work at all. It is that you like humiliating people because you consider yourself superior in some shit sense. Just because you are a boss doesnt give you right over your employee’s life.

“Ahaan thats perfectly true!” he then looked at his laptop for a while and continued, ”that as I am the manager I don’t have control over your lives, but the hidden reality is to make someone like you get his ass to work, one needs to dominate.”

“How cruel you really sound, you know that.” Ramesh said, waving his finger at the manager. “What do you mean to make someone like me get his ass back to work? Since the very first day I joined the office I have been working 50 to 60 hours a week and still you are always able to find a pathetic reason to humiliate me. Yesterday, you didnt even care that you shouted infront of the entire office.”

The manager smiled, licking his lips strangely and squinting his eyes, he uttered rather authoritatively,” 50-60 hours my foot! hahaha not sure what your clock says to you, but the quality of your work have always been poor. You can’t make a single satisfactory PPT, cant even properly type. Oh! how can I forget,” he took a pause,” RAPLICATION….and then people like you have the guts to come in my office and lecture me on what is right and wrong. Go, learn to work and then dare to give me your homily..buffoon!”

Ramesh trembling and sweating by now, was clear about one thing in his mind that this man will never understand and is so obstinate that he will continue harassing him. Feeling enraged at this thought, he got up from his seat and threw a punch heavily at the manager’s face . The manager fell down on the floor, looking at the anger-ridden face of his employee.”What are you doing?” he yelled.

Ramesh with a sly smile on his face, as if mocking him shouted back,”Well, you get what you always deserve old man.” And lifting the man up from the floor, he grabbed his collar and punched him repeatedly. Left-right then left-right and then threw 4 punches right on his face. By this time, the security guards and some office colleagues hastily entered the cabin. They separated Ramesh from the manager, whose face was as red as an apple by now. His nose was bleeding profusely. It looked as if he was half-dead.

The security guards immediately threw Ramesh out of the office and called the local police. The police locked him up in custody. Ramesh,still angry and frustrated was kicking the bars of his cell. When no one replied or paid any attention, he slwoly walked back to the stone bench sat on it and whispering under his breath, as if declaring triumphanlty he whispered,”HARRASMENT…..HARRASMENT…HARRASMENT..Its fun doing it sometimes.” A sly smile broke again on his red face…..

1pqihss,https://www.reddit.com/r/hajj/comments/1pqihss/my_hajj_experience_via_nusuk_albait_guests_majar/,My Hajj Experience via Nusuk & Albait Guests (Majar Al Kabsh – A881J-GLBL ASV),"With the season of Nusuk package releases approaching once again—and with it the familiar anxiety of package availability, e-wallet top-ups, payment failures, and lightning-fast sellouts—I felt it was important to sit down and write a detailed reflection of my own experience. Hopefully, this firsthand account helps someone navigate the process with a little more confidence and a little less panic.

Alhamdulillah, my wife and I were blessed with the opportunity to fulfill the obligation of Hajj through the *Albait Guests non-shifting package A881J-GLBL (ASV)*. Even writing that sentence still feels surreal.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The package included:

* Makkah hotel in Al-Aziziyah (initially Fahad Al Juhani then changed to Park Plaza)
* Madinah hotel: Zowar International
* Mina camp: Majar Al Kabsh
* Transportation during the Hajj days
* Breakfast, lunch, and dinner throughout
* Custom international flights

The Qurbani (sacrifice) was **not included**, so I arranged it independently using the official Adahi online platform.

The package was officially for 20 days:

* Makkah: 28 May – 15 June
* Madinah: 15 June – 17 June

The deciding factor for me was the Majar Al Kabsh camp in Mina. From the start, I was very deliberate about this. Its close proximity to Jamarat, direct metro access to Arafat and Muzdalifah, and comparatively better sanitation facilities made it stand out.

I watched numerous walkthrough videos on YouTube, especially focusing on toilet conditions, shower access, crowd flow, and air-conditioning. After that, my approach on Nusuk was simple but time-consuming:

1. Filter Mina camp → Majar Al Kabsh
2. Compare available packages
3. Select the best option within budget

That’s how I settled on the Albait Guests package.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once I had identified the package, the real emotional rollercoaster began.

I used Nusuk’s trial configuration feature to estimate the final cost (including custom flights as group flights were not available for this package) and calculated how much I needed to top up in Saudi Riyals. To be safe, I decided to test the system with a small top-up first.

My first attempt was using a virtual bank debit card. Unfortunately, the Nusuk page for entering card details didn’t load properly—fields were missing for the most time of the day. I contacted the Nusuk helpline, but that turned out to be unhelpful.

Later that evening, I checked again and the page finally loaded correctly. Encouraged, I tried topping up a small amount—only to receive an error stating the transaction could not be completed. That was my first real shock moment.

Next, I attempted a bank transfer from the same virtual bank. While it technically worked, it was painfully slow and financially disastrous. Euros were converted using a poor exchange rate, combined with Saudi-side processing fees. The commission was significant. Another hard lesson learned.

At this point, I decided to abandon bank transfers entirely and focus only on debit card transactions. I moved funds to another virtual bank account and tried again.

This time—Alhamdulillah—the top-up was instant, smooth, and offered the best exchange rate I’d seen that day.

Then came the moment of truth. I reconfigured again the package to my liking, selecting the flights I found the best for the scenario and then ........ clicked **“Purchase Package.”**

For nearly a minute, nothing happened. My heart rate was through the roof. I genuinely thought the page had frozen but waited patiently. Then—around 45–50 seconds later—my inbox lit up with an email from Saudi Airlines confirming tickets in both our names.

About a minute after that, Nusuk redirected me to the confirmation page stating that the package had been successfully assigned and flights confirmed.

That moment—relief, gratitude, disbelief—all at once—is something I’ll carry with me forever.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Although the package duration was 20 days, I personally only had around 11–12 days available. Since this was a custom-flight package, I could choose my own entry and exit dates—as long as they stayed within the official Hajj window (entry before 3 June, exit after 10 June).

We entered Saudi Arabia on 31 May and departed on 10 June, immediately after completing Hajj.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Roughly ten days before the official package start date, Albait Guests emailed us to inform us that our Makkah hotel had been changed for all pilgrims to Park Plaza Hotel.

This turned out to be a massive upgrade:

* Newly constructed building
* Excellent air-conditioning
* Laundry facilities
* Large dining area
* Coffee stations with snacks
* Refrigerators constantly stocked with cold drinks
* Freezers full of ice cream, available 24/7 without restriction

It truly felt like a blessing, especially considering the physical demands of Hajj.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Since we were leaving on 10 June, we would miss the official Madinah stay included in the package. We therefore decided to visit Madinah at our own expense.

We booked an Airbnb and traveled from Jeddah to Madinah by train for a 72-hour visit.

Important warning: Train availability during Hajj is extremely limited. Most seats are reserved by Hajj operators, so if you plan something similar, book early or expect difficulties.

After Madinah, we returned to Makkah via train with a change in Jeddah.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Upon arrival at the hotel, we were issued:

* Official Hajj badges (mandatory at all times—even inside the hotel)
* Mina camp bracelets

Security checks throughout Makkah were intense and strictly enforced.

We performed Umrah after settling in. One important thing to note: transport around Haram was virtually nonexistent. We walked long distances toward the Al-Aziziyah tunnel, eventually finding private cars charging highfares. Prepare mentally and physically for this.

Rather than exhausting ourselves before Hajj, we decided to rest, hydrate, and conserve energy. Shopping in Al-Aziziyah was convenient and affordable, with plenty of supermarkets nearby.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

On the day of 8th Zilhaj, we were instructed that buses would depart sometime after Maghrib. Instead, after waiting **over 10 hours**, we finally departed around **7 a.m. the next morning**.

Upon arrival at Majar Al Kabsh, we were welcomed with dates, chocolates, juices, and water. Volunteers guided us efficiently to the respective men’s and women’s halls.

Facilities by Albait Guests were exceptional:

* Large air-conditioned halls
* Foldable beds with storage racks
* Multiple buffet dining areas
* Tea & coffee rooms stocked continuously
* Ice cream, snacks, and drinks readily available
* Cold storage boxes placed throughout the camp

Toilets and showers were cleaned constantly by on-site staff. One tip: bring door hooks for hanging clothes inside shower cabins.

Ablution areas were spacious, well-designed, and easy to use.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

On the day of Arafat (9th Zilhaj), we left Mina around 2 a.m., walked to the metro station, and reached Arafat by Fajr.

The Arafat camp by Albait Guests was very well managed:

* Air-conditioned tents
* Clean toilets and showers
* Organized breakfast areas
* Outdoor food stalls (shawarma, BBQ, fruit)
* Cold storage boxes every 20–50 meters

After combining Zuhr and Asr, my wife and I dedicated ourselves to dua—the most important moment of Hajj. We first opted to do it outside but under a shade however after an hour or so due to the intense heat, we continued our duas inside the cooled halls until Maghrib.

Before sunset, we were instructed to leave for Muzdalifah. When we exited the camps, the crowd was overwhelming, and it took over two hours just to reach the metro.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We arrived in Muzdalifah after sunset in a spot reserved by Albait Guests, prayed Maghrib and Isha together, and rested on carpeted grounds. Food boxes by Albait Guests were distributed, and the same cold storage boxes were also available here.

Toilet access was difficult during peak times—use facilities early if possible. They were not as clean as in Mina or Arafat but was still more than acceptable.

Here we were given two options, for elderly people and women a group was said to leave for mina using metro trains at around 2 a.m in the night while the second group would leave after offering fajr prayers. We opted for second option and we tried to sleep until fajr.

After Fajr, we returned to Mina by metro, exiting near Jamarat. Despite the sea of pilgrims dressed in white, movement was smooth and calm—truly a testament to Saudi crowd management.

After stoning Jamarat Al-Aqabah, we proceeded directly to Tawaf Ifadah. The walk was long but manageable.

In the early morning, Mataaf was surprisingly spacious. We completed Tawaf in about 45 minutes, then rested briefly.

Shortly after, I received confirmation from Adahi that our sacrifice had been completed. Perfect timing. This meant that after we return to the hotel, we can get shaved/cut our hair and exit the state of Ihram.

We completed Sa’i, prayed Jumu’ah, and later struggled again with transport while returning. Eventually, we reached the hotel, exited the state of ihram, showered, and rested. After maghrib we were about to return but the hotel management told that the food is available for dinner so we were very lucky not to bother about dinner outside before heading to Mina camps. Then after dinner, we took a short ride on a bus and then walked through the mina camps to reach majar al kabsh.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The remaining days of Hajj were calm. We only had to perform the ritual of stoning the jamarat. So since the distance from majar al kabsh to jamarat point was 15 min by walk, so we use to exit the camp at 12 p.m and reach the jamarat-al-ula by 12.15 p.m. Then sooner the Dhuhr entered (at around 12.20 p.m), we started stoning the devil pillars one by one.

We left Mina on 12th Dhul Hijjah and returned to the hotel by buses organized by Albait Guests.

On the night of 14th Dhul Hijjah, we performed Tawaf Wida. It was crowded and physically demanding (compared to the Tawaf e Ifadah), but Alhamdulillah we completed it.

After praying two rak’ahs, we looked at the Kaaba one last time. With tearful eyes and heavy hearts, we said Allah Hafiz—until our next return, insha’Allah.

The same day, another best thing that Albait Guests did was provided us a seperate transport from the hotel to the airport where the personnel of Albait Guests were waiting for us who took us directly to the check-in area helping us all the way. This was really the best parting gift Albait Guests could had provided.

**Issues:**

\- Be patient with Nusuk website. With the overloading of traffic on critical days, one would find in a trouble of unresponsive website, crashing pages, failed transactions etc. If ALLAH wants you to come to hajj, things will open up by themselves rather you finding always in trouble. This is really from my personal experience.

\- Hajj is full of hardships, one should be prepared for that. Alhamdulillah now the hajj is getting better as with facilities and all amenity stuff. So please don't expect things to go according to what you want. Just hope things are paved to be helpful for hajj. In sha ALLAH, by not raising the expectations too much, one can be very happy with all that one gets.

\- The only main issue I think I wasn't expecting was the confusion plus lack of coordination of the group leader who was suppose to help us all the way during hajj days. Actually our group from Italy had to be led by a person from a travel agency (Assona Viaggi) based here in Italy which Albait Guests had hired him to do the job. However, his willingness to be there for us was totally doubtful. Most of the time he made us wait for nothing, he wasn't clear by himself what he should do. We were left without bracelets for metro service for the whole time. At the end, the last remark he gave to me was ""don't ask too much questions"". Well if you are the group leader, you should be responding to our questions.... and my questions were not for each and every aspect of hajj, just main superficial questions but somehow his attitude made not only me angry but also all others in the group, so I am not alone in this. We have complained Albait Guests but I don't know if he is going to be again the group leader or not... I do really hope he doesn't come back for the same thing as he is totally incapable of.

\- Be aware that transportation in Makkah is very difficult to get hold of. In Madina situation is very calm, one can use Uber to book the ride. Whereas in Makkah, it might work, it might not. Taxi drivers (official or private) both will demand exorbitant rates for the ride. Be prepared to have cash in hand and try to negotiate the rate as much as possible.

# Final Thoughts

Yes, Nusuk is stressful. Yes, delays happen. Yes, Hajj is physically demanding beyond imagination.

But the organization by Albait Guests is remarkable and has to be appreciated in everyway. Saudi organization of crowds is also not to be ignored. We never felt suffocation when we went to jamarat for pelting the stones. By the grace of ALLAH, I wish you all to go to this sacred journey for fulfilling the obligation by ALLAH.

Let the end times roll!

After Prime Video decided to scoot up the [***Fallout***](https://www.sideshow.com/brands/fallout) season 2 premiere by one night (moving it from Wednesday, December 17 to Tuesday, December 16), fans everywhere rushed to their Radiation King televisions with Nuka-Cola and Sugar Bombs aplenty to catch the release. Contrary to the debut season of the series, season 2 will be releasing its episodes weekly, meaning instead of one big binge, viewers have time to digest each episode (and let the fan theories fester).

https://preview.redd.it/6q364wzz758g1.png?width=740&format=png&auto=webp&s=3203f7c03ccd593f736700256ed1bf30ca090275

Season 2 kicked off with “The Innovator,” which arguably begins with less of a big bang than season 1 (hard to compete with actual nuclear bombs), but sets the stage for digging deeper into some of the wasteland’s biggest mysteries. It’s *Cram*\-packed with Easter eggs, references straight out of the *Fallout 4* and *Fallout: New Vegas* video games, and toe-tapping musical hits.

Grab your Radaway and let’s dive headfirst into recapping the Vault-Tec assisted action.



# Mr. House Has a Media Double

Talk about a House swap! *Fallout* quickly addresses the notion of “recasting” Mr. House when we see season 1’s Rafi Silver, who sat on the Vault-Tec board as the head of RobCo Industries, doing media work while season 2’s Justin Theroux sits at a bar watching the television. Tensions with tech are already high pre-war, with scads of citizens protesting RobCo’s robotic creations in Santa Monica, CA. It makes sense, then, that the most powerful and richest man in the world would hide behind a media double.

https://preview.redd.it/zyx8tfb1858g1.png?width=350&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c82f50e64e0fca62ee462d8817a016fd685115b

[](https://www.sideshow.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/fallout_season2_mrhouse.jpg)

Whether this was always the plan from the outset or not, this double casting adds a layer of complexity and obscurity to Mr. House and his infamous dealings. Throughout the episode, viewers are told that when the bombs finally drop, he will be the one pressing the button. But before this, we get the introduction of a work-in-progress mind control chip that House field tests on some surly bar patrons. “The world might end, but progress marches on,” Mr. House says ominously as the flashback ends.

Who cares if progress also means exploding a few heads?

# Lucy, The Ghoul, and Plan C

[](https://www.sideshow.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/fallout_s2_ghoul_lucy.jpg)

Returning to the apocalyptic present, most of the Novac motel scene was shown in early season teasers and trailers. But that doesn’t make it any less fun to see [**Lucy MacLean**](https://www.sideshow.com/characters/lucy-maclean) attempt to talk her way through an encounter with a wasteland gang (putting that CHA stat to use) and use Dinky the T-Rex as a sniper’s nest. (A fun note, the subtitles now refer to canine CX404 as Dogmeat.)

It seems Lucy and the [**Ghoul’s**](https://www.sideshow.com/characters/the-ghoul-fallout) partnership is still rocky at best, as our Vault dweller’s morality is pushed to its limits in their shared quest to find whatever remains of their families. The bounty hunter is already tired of the Vault dweller’s insistence on only shooting people in “the ass and kneecaps.” Lucy is frequently confronted with undeniable evidence of her father’s cruelty on their trek, but still believes in bringing him to peaceable justice. The Ghoul remains unconvinced, but his motivations are also mired in the mystery of finding out definitively what became of Barb and Janey.

https://preview.redd.it/4r7jdro4858g1.png?width=740&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3a9ef2e156e597e1b947b73cfc1c367a17d57e7

[](https://www.sideshow.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/fallout_season2_novac.jpg)

This similar-yet-different circumstance they find themselves in is part of the emotional heart of the show, but when more truths come to light, whose backbone will bow first? Will the Ghoul take pleasure in watching Lucy lose parts of herself? Can Lucy bring the Ghoul back to his humanity? There’s plenty of season yet to unfold, so only time will tell how the wasteland changes our heroes for better or worse.

A few other notable moments in this sequence include the “Big Iron” needle drop (I didn’t expect it so soon) and the V.A.T.S.-style critical hits during combat. Looks like someone took the Bloody Mess perk!

# Trouble in Paradise — Vaults 31, 32, and 33

Back in the Vaults, which provide a much cleaner contrast to the irradiated surface, things aren’t going so hunky-dory. Expert comedic gravitas is given to the woes of the dwellers of Vaults 32 and 33, who have fully begun their resettling and restructuring. It’s hard to believe the former is the same blight-stricken Vault that Chet and Norm found filled with desiccated bodies last season.

https://preview.redd.it/igoajmz5858g1.png?width=740&format=png&auto=webp&s=85dcf9c644922f4e7ce41b206e478fe1c1bbd32f

[](https://www.sideshow.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/fallout_season2_steph.jpg)

Eyepatch-wearing Steph Harper is now Overseer of the reclaimed Vault 32, dealing with all the fun of blue-and-yellow bureaucracy as a bit of her sinister side starts to slip out with cousin Chet (and baby Chet Jr., whom she refers to as ‘it’). Meanwhile, Betty Pearson is Overseer of 33, embroiled in the issue of the burnt-out water chip, which many fans, including this writer, thought was just [**an Easter egg for** ***Fallout 1*****‘s original inciting incident**](https://www.sideshow.com/blog/10-best-easter-eggs-amazon-prime-fallout-season-1).

She’s also annoyed by poor Reg McPhee (who we learn has a PhD in Event Planning), as he seems to have lost all sense of purpose — she tells him to start a club, and boy, does he. I can’t get over how hilarious and catchy, “It’s not your fault you were born in a Vault,” is. And thanks to teasers for the rest of the season, it’s likely we haven’t seen the last of the horny redheads and the In-Breeding Support Group.

# Norm Is Certainly Not One of Bud’s Buds

When we check in with Norm MacLean, we find he’s currently starving, trapped in Vault 31 with the brain of Bud Askins and the cryo-pods that housed Bud’s Buds like Hank, Betty, and Steph. Bud (which the subtitles hilariously call “Brain on a Roomba”) has him trapped, threatening him with death by lethal injection if he doesn’t get into his father Hank’s former cryo-pod and be frozen into stasis. These are his only two “rational” options, but as Norm informs him, there are plenty of irrational choices to make here.

https://preview.redd.it/u0r3txv7858g1.png?width=740&format=png&auto=webp&s=73eeebffedb60f1cf5a4e5a3c113cb809bd1f8c0

[](https://www.sideshow.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/fallout_s2_norm.jpg)

Norm’s character arc thus far has been deeply engaging, and while it’s less action-packed than his sister Lucy’s, his story digs deep into the creepier side of the Vault conspiracies and the veneer of positivity the Vault dwellers shield themselves with. In a bid to make chaos out of Vault-Tec’s careful planning, Norm damages the Bud-bot’s syringe arm and activates the remaining cryo-pods, which explains the shots of Vault 31-suited individuals we see in teasers for the ful season. They’re only supposed to thaw out every 30 years, so things are about to get interesting and wonderfully chaotic for the 31-32-33 triad.



# Who Will Press the Button?

Despite knowing what will happen as a result of Vault-Tec’s actions in the past, the show’s flashback sequences have some of the highest dramatic tension of the series yet. Cooper Howard is finding himself backed into a corner after discovering just how complicit his wife is in preparing for the end of the world. But that doesn’t mean his hands are entirely clean, as Kate Williams (AKA season 1’s Lee Moldaver) suggests.

The show excels in emphasizing the impacts of political propaganda and capitalistic overreach in just about every aspect of life, especially through these pre-war sequences. While the series’ satire has never been exactly subtle, most games take place after the world has already been destroyed (save for *Fallout 4*‘s Sanctuary opening). Giving viewers a more fully realized version of the past makes it all the more heartbreaking and dire to watch the events unfold.

The emergency alert system test scene is especially chilling, even as Cooper and the viewers know it’s just a drill. But knowing the reality — that soon, it won’t be just a hypothetical — is as haunting as it is angering. The billboard of Cooper Howard being the Vault-Tec posterboy is another excellent moment of understated commentary on complicity, iconography, and the very elements of society that drove the world to this point. As Mr. House says at the top of the episode, “Every dollar spent is a vote cast.” Good thing we pay in bottle caps now.

There’s also a deliciously dark moment between Barb and Cooper in their lavish kitchen that teases not only her role in betraying the world, but the impending approach of Caesar’s Legion in the wasteland. Did you catch that *Revenge of Brutus* film poster on the wall behind her?



# The Secret of Vault 24

Lucy and the Ghoul stumble upon Vault 24, an abandoned bastion located behind Starlight Drive-In (a Commonwealth settlement location in *Fallout 4*). Hank MacLean’s bloodied Power Armor tracks show him as going both into and out of the Vault for reasons unknown to our heroes. Lucy says she knows about the [**Vault experiments and how bad they could be**](https://www.sideshow.com/blog/most-disturbing-vault-tec-experiments-fallout), and the Ghoul reminds her that just because her Vault didn’t have scientific malpractice, her father was part of the reason the bombs came down.

Delving into the bowels of this overgrown, abandoned Vault, the duo discovers evidence that make the Ludovico Technique scenes from *A Clockwork Orange* look like a lighthearted movie marathon. This Vault was a testing ground for Mr. House’s mind control chips, as innocent people were brainwashed into becoming communists, playing into the resurgence of Red Scare seen throughout the *Fallout* universe. Following a trail of Sugar Bombs (her father’s nickname for her), Lucy finds an unwitting subject who delivers a message before his head explodes. Hank wants his daughter to go home so he can “fix everything.”

https://preview.redd.it/jn0vfada858g1.png?width=740&format=png&auto=webp&s=cea2578adc891d5916b6b6df1e7ce2a5582856b2

[](https://www.sideshow.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/hankmaclean.jpg)

Meanwhile, our final sequence of the episode sees Hank MacLean arrive at a somewhat-preserved Vault-Tec corporate office. He doffs the Power Armor and trades it for a crisp new suit, cleaning up before making himself a damn fine cup of coffee and getting to work. At a desk, he sends a greeting transmission to who we can assume is likely Robert House, promising to continue the work that’s been started on the brain-computer interface and miniaturization of this mind-controlling technology.

*Fallout* media is known for its retro radio, and the television series is no stranger to that. Season 2 episode 1 featured some of the franchise’s most iconic hits as well as some subtler choices:

* “Cheek to Cheek” covered by Peggy Lee (Played during the opening sequence with Mr. House)
* “Big Iron” by Marty Robbins (One of the songs most synonymous with Fallout: New Vegas, played during the Ghoul’s duel with the Great Khans)
* “Make the World Go Away” by Eddy Arnold (Played while Coop and Janey are driving to Bakersfield)
* “Come Go With Me” by the Del-Vikings (Played while Reg is wandering through Vault 33)
* “It’s All Over But the Crying” by the Ink Spots (One of Fallout 4’s most iconic tunes, played while Reg contemplates his life during the In-Breeding Support Group)
* “Working for the Man” by Roy Orbison (Played while Hank MacLean suits up at the Vault-Tec offices)

# What Easter Eggs Are in “The Innovator?”

[](https://www.sideshow.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/dinky_trex_fallouts2.jpg)

The *Fallout* show is full of references to the games, whether as essential worldbuilding or as intentional Easter eggs, but here are a few of the fun winks at the viewer we spotted:

* The introduction screen is no longer a Radiation King television, but a RobCo Securitron.
* The Ghoul uses a damaged fusion core’s radiation to heal his wounds at the motel. Fusion cores are most often found powering industrial generators or [**Power Armor suits**](https://www.sideshow.com/blog/best-power-armor-fallout-series) throughout the series.
* The Vault-Tec rep who initiates the events of *Fallout 4* can be seen in the pre-war sequence during the alarm tests.
* The Whack a Commie! arcade game seen in the diner originally made its debut in the Nuka World expansion for *Fallout 4* (spelled Whac-a-Commie in the game).
* Many famous Fallout brands make their appearance on appliances and foodstuffs on set — a Radiation King van can be seen behind the bar with Mr. House, Norm’s Vault 31 rations include cans of purified water, Mr. House smokes Big Boss cigarettes, and a rocket-shaped Nuka-Cola bottle can be seen in the diner, just to name a few.



# When Is the Next Episode of Fallout Season 2?

Season 2 continues next week with episode 2, which releases on Wednesday, December 24. Episode releases will continue weekly on Wednesdays until the season finale on February 4. And yes, loyal Vaulties, season 3 has already been confirmed, though the production timeline is unknown. So be prepared to have some questions remain unanswered by the end of this season as the end of the world continues.

A preview for the rest of the season plays after the credits, teasing the Brotherhood of Steel’s endeavors (they were absent this episode, save for shots of an airship and a vertibird in the pre-bomb timeline), as well as deathclaws, mutating Squire Thaddeus, Caesar’s Legion, and even a dance number in Vault 33. We can’t wait!

1pqigkk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1pqigkk/feeling_really_fucked_and_down_idk_what_to_do_rn/,feeling really fucked and down idk what to do rn?,"so background

im 16M have autism and i think it is citalopram im taking? and i go to a place where u go to and eventually go back to school im there monday and friday morning (9-12) and wednsday the whole day (9-3)

and its fine

but the last few days i have been feeling horrid like excuse me for the words ima be using

but i kinda feel really fucked up idk how to properly translate it to english i dont think there is a way but how i would say like a cancer really fucking bad i dont want to do anything nor do i want to sleep

and idk why this is happening like my life isnt interesting at all if there would be a button that would make me die and everybody forgot my it would be a 60/40% that id push it with the 60% being pushing it

and i dont do anything all day i just... game thats it nothing more 0 friends irl online i have a few

and to the location i go i met someone we had a nice click and we met up one time we were at my place from 1pm till 12pm but a few days later i made a joke (not even gonna repeat it im so ashamed of it and ik it was really stupid) and he didnt like it which is completly my fault i just have the tendency to find the limits with people so i know what i can do its a bad habbit

well didnt like it etc etc eventually he reached out to me saying via a councelor so to speak before u see each other again (didnt happen yet due to me leaving 2 hours early now him also not always being there this was 3 weeks ago) that he did really like the contact we had there but that contact outside of the place is a bit much rn

which i understand fully and i said if the councler could say to him that i understand and if he ever wants to do something after he left there since hes almost 18 i think in a week and once ur 18 u need to leave there he can just send a message

and im fine with that bit of a bumer but im fine with that problem is idk if it actually was that reason or because of the joke but i cant do anything else than take his word

but idk that idea has been floating around in my head sometimes but hey people come and go and im only 16

it is what it is

but thats only a small part of why i feel ass and usualy i dont really think about it but idk what it is or why it is i just feel FUCKED

and idk what to do with this any tips

i dont wanna game i dont wanna read i dont wanna sleep i dont wanna watch a serie or movie

and my mom will be councling the dr about it but thats tommorow since he aint working rn but i swear to god if he suggest changing meds im gonna lose it these are the 3rd also had zoloft/sertralin and aripiprazol im on meds for 4 ish years rn and the going down in slowly dossage to start the other one is hell everytime i just hope i dont need to.. again

even tough i already feel fucked rn

and u know never had a gf or anything close to romanticly never even held hands which ik is completley fine and normal at 16 and i shouldnt worry about it but idk kinda makes me feel lonely sometimes

that was it sorry if its hard to understand i kinda dozed off on topics but well i typed it so may as well keep it

also this is a repost of a earlier post but it stil applys today and like its been a bit better today but still not great

friday

and i went to the place again today but went home after like 1.5 hours because i became nauseas af in the car when we were going some where probally due to an all nighter+4 cups of coffee in 12 hours with in total like 600mg cafeinee and being cramed in the backseat with 2 others and being on my phone and u know electric cars can feel odly weird at times

so went home went laying in bed went to sleep at like 11.30am and woke up at 6.20pm

i found that just playing lego games for some reason really enjoy it mainly lego hobbit rn or just playing f1 turn on some music and drive just driving, driving and driving but u know it wont always work so id still apreciate some tips

and its not that i cant have fun i can but as soon as i stop i fall down or even when laughing u know i still just feel bad

and i went to sleep at 4 am both on well friday to saturday and 4.30 am on satuday to sunday

and this is the 2nd week of me feeling this way like off days are there but usually not 2 weeks long

and idk i also find myself misserable for complaining and asking advice about this since there are people who have the same as me but much much heavier

and sorry if this is the wrong place its the first that came to mind

monday

i went again today from 9-12 and just got home and idk there is a girl there we have a decent click nothing special and we can laugh together play pool etc

but even if im genuinly laughing idk i just still feel bad well its a bit less but still bad and now that im home im completley sinking down idk how to say it in english like everything ccomming back like comming down

and the doc is available tommorow and then ill hear what he suggest i swear to god i hope he doesnt say med change

ad idk just what to do its been worse now that im home like worse then the lst few days and i want to sleep but i also dont want to i want to watch serie but i also dont want to etc

and whenever i force myself to smile idk what it is idk i feel different? which makes me think im subconsiously forcing myself to feel this way but on the other hand the smile feels forced af

  
and on the night from tuesday to wednsday u started having toughts not that i would do it but how i would do it the scenarios etc and i said it to the councler well idk actually the right word the dutch word is begeleider

and i just wanted to talk about how i have been feeling etc mentioned that and now were maybe looking for some kind of therapy or whatever

thursday 

thinking of getting into a bit of music and bought a proper ocarina from thomann for 80 euros

and today is friday

i have been feeling a tad bit better but still noot good went to the ice skating track thing it was the cheapest and worst track known to man basiclly a scam atp but well we were gone again after 10m then went back eaten and rank some left overs from yesterday since yesterday they had a idk it isnt a party but just something with food and snacks u just talk u get the drill

  
and went back to the main locatioln or atleast the main location where i am (there are 3 locations) and one of the counclers said u can go home since there bascilly 1 other client left and i said sure id app my mother since she brought me today because of absolute piss weather and she said i can bring u home if the other person is fine with that she said yes

its the girl i have a decent click with jsut talked and laughed in the car i was dropped of first since i live way closer like same town and she lives 1 town over 20m ish and now im home and eventough im laughing in the car i still feel bad and now that im home i feel even worse

  
also idk how we got on the topic but the girl mentioned she was drunk and went home with a 21yo shes 16 they didnt do anything besides kiss or atleast thats what she said but is that normal for teens to do?

I've always found the ambiance comforting and conducive to productivity.

Earlier today, I was at my favorite local coffee shop, a hipster-filled haven known for its unique brews and aromatic beans. I was tucked into my usual corner, engrossed in some coding when a conversation between two baristas, roughly in their mid-20s, caught my attention.

One barista, a 24F I recognized as a friendly regular, was explaining to the other, a newbie around 26M, about an unconventional way of brewing coffee. She was describing a method known as ""reverse AeroPress."" She detailed the process like this - instead of using the AeroPress in its traditional, upright position, she flips it upside down before adding the coffee and water. This allows for more control over the immersion time, preventing the water from seeping through prematurely and resulting in a bolder, more flavorful brew.

I must confess I was skeptical. I’m not a coffee novice. I’ve prepared coffee using various techniques from French press to pour-over, but I’d never heard of a reverse AeroPress. Was it really that different? I was intrigued, and given my love for coffee, I couldn't resist the temptation to try.

Acting on impulse, I bought an AeroPress from the shop, hurried home, and tried the method immediately. The result? An incredibly flavorful and rich cup of coffee, possibly the best I've had in my life. I couldn't believe how just flipping the device could produce such a difference.

So, to all my fellow coffee lovers here, if you haven't already, give the reverse AeroPress a try. It’s simple, it’s different, and it might just change the way you drink coffee.",0,1766141555.0,overheard,9,0.44,False

Here’s how I fixed mine in a month.","I spent most of high school and the start of college convinced that my brain just wasn't ""wired"" for math. I was the person who would see a variable and a fraction in the same equation and immediately feel my stomach drop. I’d just stare at the page until the numbers started floating.

I thought I was just ""a humanities person."" Turns out, I wasn't dumb—I just had ""Swiss Cheese Learning."" 🧀

Basically, I was trying to learn Calculus while having giant holes in my knowledge of basic Algebra and Fractions. You can't build a skyscraper on a swamp. If you're struggling right now, it’s probably because you’re missing a concept from 3 years ago that your current teacher *assumes* you already know.

Here is the ""No-BS"" plan I used to fix my foundation in 30 days while working a part-time job:

* **The ""Ego Death"" Phase:** I went back to basics. I’m talking middle school math. It felt embarrassing at first, but I used **Khan Academy** and started at the very beginning of Algebra 1. If I couldn't explain *why* you flip the sign when multiplying by a negative, I didn't move on.
* **The 20-Minute Drill:** Instead of doing 3 hours of ""studying"" (mostly crying), I did 20 minutes of practice problems every single morning with my coffee. No music, no phone, just me and a pencil. Math is a muscle, not a memory game.
* **Stop Memorizing Formulas:** This was my biggest mistake. I stopped trying to memorize ""The Steps"" and started asking ""Why does this work?"" If you understand the logic, you don't need to memorize the formula because you can basically reinvent it in your head.
* **Organic Chemistry Tutor (YouTube):** This man is a saint. If my textbook was written in riddles, his videos were the Rosetta Stone. I’d watch him solve a problem, pause the video, try it myself, and then play to see if I got it right.

After a month, the ""scary"" stuff in my current class actually started making sense. I wasn't magically smarter; I just finally had the tools to actually do the work.

If you feel like you're ""bad at math,"" stop looking at your current homework for a second. Go back two chapters or two years. Find where the ""holes"" in your cheese are and fill them. It changes everything.

1pqi5qc,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_wastelanderultma/comments/1pqi5qc/tales_from_my_farther_farmstead/,"Tales from my farther, farmstead","Hi, I won't lie, this is kind of awkward for me to write out so I'm going to try to be as blunt about it as I can, I don't really know how else to do it. 


Let's start with some background I guess? My name's Jack, mates call me Jackie sometimes and well the reason I'm writing this is well. I don't want to say simple but two months ago my dad died. We don't know how he died, just that for some reason he was in New York, why he would go there without telling anyone I don't know. What I do know is he left me a mountain of journals in the will alongside a letter which the lawyer told me to read first. 

I've read through the letter and the first journal and I have to say right now I don't believe a word of it, but my mates are sick and tired of me talking about this stuff when we hang out so I figured if they aren't interested and I still want to talk about it the internet was the best place. 

So I'll start with some background. My dad was a private investigator for twenty years, his office was in Liverpool but his work took him all over the place, different cities, different countries, that sorta thing. He was sort of well known because he rescued some girl that went missing in America years ago, but he wasn't always a PI, he was in the armed forces for twenty two years joined straight out of high school and fought in the Falklands first, he didn't talk much about what he did for them but I do know he was in a three letter group, the S.A.S. and that he had started out his career in the royal marine commandos. Was my dad a bad ass? I honestly can't say because like I said he didn't talk much about his time in the service, what I do know is he left in his forties after both his legs had to be amputated thanks to an RPG and was a PI up until his sixties when he passed, I think he was on a case but it he was he hadn't said anything about it. 

Anyway I think the only way I'm going to be able to get this across to you all properly is to transcribe the first journal here, I'm going to leave out the letter for now because that feels too personal to share at this moment but if there's enough demand for it I'll post it in a follow up. 

So with that said and done blow is the transcript from the first few pages of journal one which my dad had titled “Farmstead” 


I hadn't written anything down in a journal for years, sure I kept case notes and such in writing pads but nothing like this. The reason I'm writing this is simple. I was in the office when the post came in, I got up to check it and saw a letter addressed to me. I'm writing this for you Jackie, you and your sister I mean…..what I've learned after this case, what I've found. You need to know but you're so young right now I couldn't dare tell you this now, your mother already hates me there's no reason to give her more ammo. 

You'll find I've tried to keep the time line as close to right as I can but some days I didn't have the time or energy to write properly so not everything will synch up right, sorry about that son but you'll understand when you finish this. 

I made my way back from the front door into my office. It's a small dark place, I have a window at the back but it's so cluttered in here the light from outside is hard to see and I prefer to keep my blinds closed. I moved a bottle out of the way on my desk, not proud to admit it but I've been drinking more often recently, whiskey helps with my legs. 

Looking at the envelope over it was well put together if that made any sense, the hand writing on the front was neat and cursive, the stamp straight and in the corner of the brown paper, it was addressed to me but was from America. The reason I bring up how neat the envelope is because of the state of the letter. 

Inside I found a crumpled almost dirty sheet of paper clearly ripped straight from a note pad, the hand writing was clearly done fast, scribbled as if the writer was in a panic or didn't have long to make the message they needed to send me, I noticed specks of red in the bottom corner, deep and dry, I had seen enough blood before to know what it was. 

The letter reads as follows.

“Hello sir, I understand your a man who's capable of getting into places he shouldn't, a man who's able to gather information others don't want found. And I believe your the man I need to save me. In the town of West park there is much for you to find, a girl went missing recently, she wasn't the first and she won't be the last to suffer the fate of the farmer's wife. Please I need your help, the people here need your help.” 

The letter seemed to cut off before they were able to say anything else, to say I was confused was an understatement at the time, flipping the page over I found an address. A house in this town West park, I did what searching I could on the internet and found a small police report in the news. A young girl by the name of Casey Williams had gone missing there three years before I had gotten the letter and a different girl by the name of Abigail Winslow had gone missing a few weeks before I got the letter, looking through there were multiple reports of missing people in the area all around the ages of sixteen to twenty five old. 

Now people think being a private investigator is like being a spy, solving murders and cold cases, the truth is I spent most of my days following wives and husbands to see if they were cheating. 

If you think back, Jackie 2005 was the year your mother took you and your sister abroad, we have just divorced and I wouldn't be seeing either of you two for the next few months at least I don't think I will be. But still I didn't think for a moment I could actually go, all the way to some town in the arse end of the US? That would be crazy. 

But when I looked down at the letter, I had questions. A lot of questions: what had caused the writer so much distress? What had made them spill blood onto the page? Why was the letter so rushed but the envelope wasn't? And of course there was the most important question. 

Why me? At the time Mason Blackforge is not a name well known and even if it was, why would someone from half way across the planet be asking me for help? How could they have even found my office in the first place? Sure I'm on the front page of Google if you search for PIs in Liverpool but I'm not the first name on the list I thought to myself that it had to be a prank of some kind, some strange or slow kids who had read goosebumps and thought it would be a good idea for a laugh. 

But the more I looked into the town the more missing people I saw in the news, mostly it was runaways or homeless kids, last seen near the town and then never again but there was also the rare report of a local kid going missing too. 

Casey Williams was not the most recent but it was her home that had been stated in the letter, if it had been her who wrote to me, that somehow she managed to temporarily escape whoever or wherever she was it just didn't make sense she would contact me of all people. 

I knew there was only one way of figuring out the truth. The thing was I don't think I was really leaving for that, not at first anyway, I had a bad feeling about the whole thing but I couldn't stand to be in Liverpool for much longer, I loved the city I grew up there I was born there…..but I also met your mother there…saw you and your sister for the first time there. 

Maybe I just wanted an escape, maybe I really did want to help whoever sent me that letter, but as I looked down to the two long metal rods jutting out from just below my knees that I called legs I knew one thing. Someone out there for one reason or another needed my help. I had to do something for them. 

So that night I booked a plane and packed my bags. I had three friends state side. You might remember your uncle Mac, if not he's the navy seal I told you about, don't think I ever told you about Tye but he was Delta. Unfortunately neither of them lived near the rockies and I knew I couldn't call agent orange over something like this. That rat bastard would hold anything he could over my head. I was on my own. 

Didn't help that there wasn't anything in the way of money it seemed. I was hopeful I could sort something out with whoever wrote to me later but that would require finding them. 

Whoever wrote that letter they were scared, really fucking scared. I knew what panicked handwriting looked like from FNGs and I could tell this to whoever it was that wrote to me was clearly worried. And so against all better judgement I booked the first flight I could get and packed my bag.

I thought now was the best time to start making notes, I liked to keep on top of my theories and such, I found it helped me prepare for court and such, and let me tell you I had found some worrying information about the town, I noticed a pattern amongst the missing. 

I would hit play on the microphone of my recorder, sipping from my hips flask. I felt the warm burn of whisky coat my throat and wet my whistle as I spoke. 

“In October of 1982 a group of three body builders was reported missing by their families, they were reported to be hiking on the old noise trail near the town's mines, September 13th 2001 three army rangers went missing on the other side of the mountain West park is built into they would of been reported on further by the news but at that time the on going coverage of the 911 attacks over shadowed them and finally in the January of 2002 a boxer went missing alongside his son five miles from the town. In total that's eight missing people over a twenty year period. Here's what bothers me. That's just the men. In the same time period forty two women have gone missing within a twenty mile radius. That's just about two people every year. Some are runaways, hikers, campers, hunters there's no true connection between any of them apart from one thing. All the missing women were either at the ages or between the ages of sixteen to twenty five, none under and none over. So of the two sets of targeting data I have it seems that very active or physically capable men are disappearing but being massively overshadowed by young women going missing. Now a few cases have gone federal with the FBI getting involved but they found nothing and as for local police? The longest they've investigated before marking the case as cold was two weeks. None of this includes locals of which there's been sixteen missing women and no men, Casey Williams being the second to last she went missing three years ago, the most recent being Abigail Winslow who's still an active investigation at the time of recording. This is already enough to tell me this isn't accidental and more than likely not caused by something like an animal there would be a higher number of men if that were the case. Based on what I currently know I believe this to be the work of a person or group of persons. The FBI reported a similar theory in 1998 on one of the few federal cases..However further investigation will be required to confirm. I leave at 4am Saturday.” 

I hit the stop button and pulled the tape out of the recorder I'm sure by the time you read this I'll have a digital one or whatever they make next but for now I liked the physical copies more, I took another sip of whiskey and spent the rest of my day looking into the town and local area online. 

Not much of note happened for the next two days, I tried calling your mother to let her at least know I'd be out of the country just on the off chance she came back. But well in truth I would be shocked if she ever even let me see you two again. 

The airport was a nightmare, the last time I had been on a flight before this was military, when they sent me home after my legs. I never realised how much they had ramped up security after the attacks. Still I managed to get a few drinks down me once I was past and a whole sleeve of ciggies for cheap, always fun. 

I landed at Denver International and was met with a tough choice, what to hire to get around. A ford truck or a motorbike. Now don't get me wrong I like riding a bike but I hadn't even seen about getting a proper hotel room for my stay and so found myself driving through the mountains in a red 2004 ford F150. The radio was broken, it had a crack in the windshield and good god did the clutch sound like a screaming cat when you over revved, considering it was only a year old I was pretty annoyed at the state of that truck, still it did come in handy. 

The drive from the airport to West park took a while, I'm not exactly sure how long but at least four or five hours through those dark wooded hills. It was late by the time I had found the motel. Just outside of town it was out of the way enough I didn't think I would be found here, one main way in multiple escape routes of course I didn't have a home field advantage but I could get a good vantage point from the second floor. 

It was the classic sort of set up your expect from tv or movies, two stories the room doors facing out to the world and a small office just in the corner, brown wooden panels took up the interior and the vacancy sign lit up the face of the clearly bored teenager working the desk. A scrawny lad with ginger hair and freckles a small line of peach fuzz made out the vague shape of a mustache, clearly it was only just coming in a name tag on his chest read “Henry”

He didn't make much in the way of small talk but I could tell he was a little shocked to see me. In all honesty what I had on and my accent probably didn't help. I didn't regret the desert combat boots, black jeans, motorhead shirt and leather jacket with a globe and laurelI sewed on. I'm just sure an old man like that alongside a scouse accent must have been jarring for a kid in a town this far out. I knew it was normally the first time I met most Americans; they never seemed to understand how there could be more than one English accent. 

I made my way to the room on the second floor, it was small, the walls a pinkish beige, wooden tables and a TV across from the bed. You remember that show we watched? About the American who likes karma and that? It looked like the room he lived in. 

I checked my watch, it was only 5:30pm, I could make it into town easily enough and see about asking some questions. Of course I had no idea what the reaction to me going there would be but hanging around would just be wasting time. I'd take a swig from my hip flask and move to the door, once it was closed from the outside I crouched down and pulled a small roll of electrical tape from my pocket. 

I placed a small line of tape just on the bottom of the door as an easy way to know if someone didn't like me poking around, all things considered I thought that could be a likely possibility, proper preparation prevents piss poor performance son.

I won't lie at this time in my life my drinking was probably at its worst. I won't say how many times I used that hip flask, what I do know is I was probably over the limit. The drive wasn't too long; the Williams household was near the edge of town, a lovely image of the American dream, a big house with blue paint, white picket fence and a driveway with two cars on the gravel.  

I grabbed my things, a note pad and a pen, parked the truck across the street and zipped up my jacket before I made my way towards the door, the porch light turning on before I even had a chance to knock. I rapped on the door with a heavy fist with little pressure. 

The door would open and I was greeted by a shorter woman, blonde hair, blue eyes, she was pretty smooth skin with a full face of makeup. She wore a white cardigan and blue jeans, if I had to guess she was in her thirties to forties. She looked up at me confused. It didn't help that I stood over her, we both know I'm not the tallest fella in the world but I was taller than her. 

“Yes?” She asked with a clearly Californian accent, I knew this wouldn't be easy to explain but the longer I stood there and said nothing the weirder I would seem and the harder it would be, I looked down at her and held my note pad in view, I thought her being able to see both my hands might help me seem less suspicious. 

“Hello ma'am, My name is Mason Blackforge, this will sound strange but I'm a private investigator, some time ago I received a letter and it's lead me here, would your last name happen to be Williams?” 

She looked shocked to say the least but she quickly swung the door open and shouted up the stairs for someone before she rushed me inside, before I had a chance to object I found myself sat on a brown fabric couch in a warmly lit living room a fur rug by my boots which I did my best to avoid staining with whatever was on the bottom of them, though it was a bit hard to feel if I did have my feet on the rug considering my lack of actual feet. 

I looked at her as she quickly brought me a coffee I hadn't even asked for before a fucking mountain of a man walked through the door, clean shaven with short ginger hair, pale skin and tired eyes, he wore a fireman's uniform, he looked even more confused than the woman who's name I still haven't gotten. 

“Who's this?” His voice was gruff to say the least deep and scratchy as he scanned me. The stranger in the room sat on his couch with a coffee. I thought it best to introduce myself again only to be beaten to it by the woman. 

“He's an investigator, Brad! He knows about Casey!” The man's tired eyes lit up as he quickly sat down across from me quickly joined by the woman as he said the thing I was worried would be spoken “b-but we didn't hire an investigator? Who are you? How do you know about our little girl?” 

I quickly put my hand up slightly as I tried to make a hole in his questions for me to answer as I pulled the envelope from my pocket. 

“A few days ago I received this letter, it's very vague but it has this address written on it. Doesn't name your daughter exactly though I looked into the case online and found out about her alongside an Abigail Winslow. I hoped to ask you about to if you knew anything. I'll be honest I'm not exactly sure who's hired me and I understand that may be a concern but someone's put me on this for a reason. I'm sure you have questions and I have my own too, for now if we could start with the basics. I understand it may be hard for you both but I need more information on your daughter's disappearance. What happened exactly on that day?” 

I opened my note pad and looked at them both, they looked nervously at each other but they seemed to understand I was at least being genuine. The man would start first. 

“I don't understand…..why would someone hire you and not tell us?” He shook his head as the woman who I now saw was definitely his wife from the ring on her finger laid her hand on his shoulder, a reassuring look on her face. 

He'd look down for a moment as his wife spoke up. “Brad was at work, he's the captain at the fire station. Me and Casey where…..well we had an argument, she wanted to skip school to go see her boyfriend I told her not to and well it turned to a shouting match, our son Henry was with her last till she went to the hollows to meet that damn boy.” 

I wrote down everything as she spoke, my head poking up at the name “does Henry work at the motel outside of town?” She would nod her head “are you staying there? You should talk to him he should be home soon” 

I would nod as I wrote down what I could be confused as to what exactly this hollow was. 
“What exactly is this hollows? A place?” 

The father Brad would nod his head “it's a meet up spot for the kids in town, it's an old mine shaft, it's been locked up for years but the moss there glows in the dark and there's a small area that isn't closed of so young couples like to go there. It's near the lake so a lot of kids like to head there to swim and stuff, we get called out there every few weeks because of fireworks.”

Using the double - grind size 17 (recommended 17), I got 18 grams of grinded bean - a good start. 

The next bit of the process seemed visually to have a lot of liquid and I could already tell it had filled my mug more than usual... 112g of liquid coffee! 

I was aiming for a 2:1, so ~36g of coffee. 

What should be my first move? The grind setting, the tamp pressure (I'd call what I did ""medium"")...?

Hello, founders, creators and business visionaries!  This is your Chief Purr-ologist from WebSEOMarket, bringing you a story not about coffee, but about the magic a global brand managed to tame in China so delicately that it became a strategic asset.  
  
In early December, Starbucks China didn’t simply launch a new set of drinks and collectible cups. It opened a portal -quiet, shimmering, almost theatrical - into a world where every guest stepped into a small, deeply personal winter tale.  
  
The collaboration with the Harry Potter universe became far more than a seasonal promotion. It turned into a ritual - one that allowed people to move through December differently: slower, warmer, deeper. And no, it’s not because “everyone loves magic”. It’s because humans crave the right to remain children, even for a single sip  and smart brands give them exactly that. Why shouldn’t they?  
  
1. Drinks as spells  
  
Magic Ball Raspberry Latte, Caramel Tart Latte, Wizard Party Earl Grey Latte…  
But the essence isn’t the flavour. It’s how each drink becomes a small emblem of anticipation of the possibility of wonder.  
  
Violet cup sleeves, woollen house bands, the randomness of being “sorted”  this isn’t merchandise. It’s an entry ticket into a story the customer finishes themselves. No frantic discounts. No shouting. Only the desire to collect all four houses, share a photo, return again… and again.  
  
2. The coffee shop as theatre. The guest as spectator. The impression as narrative.  
  
Around forty Starbucks locations across China transformed into miniature theatres: floating cups, light installations, mirrors that awaken in phone cameras.  
The Guangzhou flagship = almost a museum of a school that never existed, yet feels familiar.  
  
And truthfully…People didn’t come for coffee. They came to remember what it feels like to believe that any corner might be a doorway into another reality.  
  
3. Baristas as guides into an imagined world  
  
Starbucks allowed its staff to become “magic baristas”, and this human touch became the beating heart of the experience. When someone performs a role sincerely, guests stop being customers. They become travellers seeking a mood, not a drink.  
  
Sometimes one genuine gesture builds more loyalty than an entire advertising budget.  
  
4. And finally - digital enchantment as an amplifier  
  
UGC, hashtags, cosplay, store-to-store photo quests. People began expanding the campaign with their own stories - the kind no brand can buy, yet every brand desires.  
  
Starbucks provided only the frame. The guests carried the magic forward.  
And that is the height of mastery: when people spread your world without your asking.  
  
👉 A Purring Insight from Your Chief Purr-ologist: Winter magic isn’t fantasy.  
It is a carefully engineered experience. Build a small world and people will choose to live in it longer than the season itself.  
  
If you want to create a campaign that doesn’t just sell but enchants… That doesn’t just decorate but builds atmosphere… That doesn’t imitate trends but constructs its own universe 👉 visit [https://www.webseomarket.com/en](https://www.webseomarket.com/en)   The WebSEOMarket team knows exactly how to make that world real.

1pqhzyi,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiddengeneticdiseases/comments/1pqhzyi/anybody_else_have_genetic_diseases_they_never/,Anybody else have genetic diseases they never knew they had till too late?,"I just read an article about chronic disease or illness fakers.  I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

So I chose to do this. I have done a similar abstaining before as well. So I thought I could withstand this time too. However, I am going through a rough time and am very depressed most of the day ro the point that I am not being able to put myself to bed at a reasonable time or concentrate my career or other aspects of my life. Especially since I am pretty much locked up with not much interaction with others. 

I am a foodie and it brings me so much joy. It is one of the ways I cope up with the lows of life ( I don't smoke or drink or party etc). Even a simple cup of good coffee lifts my mood. 

So my question is, is it okay to break this promise of giving up food that I love ? I know Christmas is just a few days away and I'm conflicted. A part of me doesn't want to do it, but I am just so broken. ",1,1766140520.0,Catholicism,2,1.0,False

For context, I don’t know this woman, we have only met once, briefly in passing, I take care of ALL Christmas arrangements, buy all the food, cook all the dinner. We have 4 children and it’s all rather chaotic and stressful for me. My own family members aren’t coming for dinner as it’s just a bit too much for me to handle all the preparation. 

I only found out that he’d invited her when I told him that I was unhappy that he’d gone off to meet her for coffee on the one day I’d asked him to help wrap the kids‘ christmas presents. his response was “well I wanted to meet her to ask if she’d come for Christmas Dinner”. i had asked him to rearrange meeting her but he went anyway. he was planning on telling me she was coming, once she had accepted his invitation! 

she turned down his offer, thankfully, as I can do without the extra work, especially for a complete stranger to me and our kids. But he thinks I’m overreacting by being upset.

Barely any space for placing the coffeemaker (which had to be taken out of the closet - no outlet there). In fact there was only one electric outlet in the entire room that would allow plugging the coffee machine, electric kettle and my phone charger so I had to constantly plug and unplug them. 

The breakfast spread was ok but hardly five stars quality: cheap juices, canned fruit and fake maple syrup are ok in Holiday Inns but I would expect better from Kimpton. Absolutely terrible coffee - thin and sour. All the à la carte items cost extra - that’s not always the case, Kimpton AMS offers them for free. As with every restaurant in London, service charge is added to the bill but they still leave a huge space for Gratuity. 

This being a holiday season, there were private parties held at the hotel every day and the thumping music was particularly annoying. It wouldn’t last past 10pm but I was not happy. 

And lastly: they tell you at the check out that they charge £15 gratuity for the staff and ask if I’m ok with it being charged to the card on file. This is after I left the cash tip in the room. I didn’t say anything bc well, f… it. This stay cost me over $1k for two nights so to hear that the staff salary needed to be supplemented was very… American of them.

1pqhx87,https://www.reddit.com/r/creativewriting/comments/1pqhx87/once_before_christmas/,"Once, Before Christmas","Max woke to an insistent knock at the door. He opened his eyes and checked his iPhone. Five a.m. Carefully, he slipped out of bed, trying not to wake Lena, pulled on his dressing gown, and went to the door.

“Your time is over. Will you extend it?” asked a man in a tracksuit, a dragon tattoo curling up his neck. It was Lena’s new pimp, Sergei. The old one had been arrested last week for carrying a weapon.

Max shook his head.

“Then tell her I’m waiting in the car,” Sergei said, already heading down the stairs.

Max closed the door, relieved by the silence, and went into the kitchen to make toast and coffee. Half an hour later, the apartment smelled of fresh coffee and buttered toast.

***

Katya walked along the main street, studying shop windows. Christmas was coming, and she still had gifts to buy — for her relatives, and for Max. Last Christmas, she had given him a luxurious shaving kit. This year, the gift had to be just as good, if not better.

“Real watches for real men,” read a sign in a shop window.

“That’s it,” she thought, stepping inside.

She chose a Vacheron Constantin Patrimony — not because it was expensive, but because it was elegant. The watch was impossibly thin, smooth beneath her fingers, its polished case catching the light without demanding attention. The dial was calm and perfectly balanced, marked only by slender gold indices and hands that moved with quiet confidence. It was the kind of watch a man wouldn’t show off, but would wear every day, until it became part of his gestures, his habits, his life.

She imagined it on his wrist and smiled. Some gifts speak loudly. This one simply stayed.

Beaming, she left the shop, thinking she should go see Max.

***

Lena was ready to leave when someone knocked at the door.

“It must be Sergei. He was here this morning,” Max called from the shower.

Lena opened the door and saw a well-dressed young woman.

“Hello. What do you want?” Lena asked.

“I want to see Max,” the woman said.

“Come in. He’s in the shower. He’ll be out in five minutes,” Lena replied, stepping aside.
“By the way, I’m Lena. What’s your name?”

“Katya,” the woman said.

She stepped carefully over a pair of men’s jeans, glanced at the unmade bed, and walked toward the bathroom.

“Katya!” Max exclaimed. “What are you doing here?”

Instead of answering, Katya slapped him across the face and walked out, slamming the door.

Lena locked the door and went into the bathroom.

“What was that?” she asked.

“That was my girlfriend,” Max said. “My ex, apparently.”

“So, will you be alone on Christmas?” Lena asked after a pause. “If you want, I can keep you company. It’s easier not to be alone that night.”

“Deal,” he said, touching his cheek and feeling a small warmth he didn’t expect.

***

Time passed slowly. Sergei sat in his car, killing time with a crossword. Then everything happened at once.

The entrance door slammed. A young woman slipped on the ice-covered sidewalk and went down hard.

Sergei jumped out of the car and ran toward her.

“Are you okay?” he asked.

The woman moaned and tried to get up.

“Do you need an ambulance?” he asked.

“I’m fine,” she said. “Just a few bruises. Please help me up.”

Sergei helped her to her feet and led her to a nearby bench.

“I’m really tired of this blasted cold,” the woman complained.

“Yeah,” Sergei said. “Yesterday my neighbor slipped too and broke his foot. He’s in the hospital now.”

She sat down and sighed. “Thank you for your help.”

“My pleasure,” Sergei replied.

The woman rummaged through her bag. Suddenly her face went pale.

“My watch,” she said. “It’s broken.”

“Let me see,” Sergei said. “I used to be a watchmaker.”

He examined it carefully.

“Nothing serious,” he said. “The glass is cracked, that’s all. I can fix it — but only if you promise to have dinner with me.”

The woman smiled and nodded.

“Deal,” she said.

“My name is Sergei,” he said, handing the watch back.

“Katya,” she replied, thinking: maybe this Christmas won’t be as broken as her heart. Who knows.●",1,1766140413.0,creativewriting,0,1.0,False

Roast level: 4/6 so medium-dark?
