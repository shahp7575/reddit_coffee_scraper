1o8xbqa,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/1o8xbqa/review_8_gc_possets_scents/,Review - 8 GC Possets Scents,"Possets is one of the oldest indies around, one of the original BPAL competitors. I remember checking their website out in the 00s, but I think their samples were more expensive? Can't quite remember, but somehow they never hooked me. I was surprised and pleased to see they're still around (never an easy feat) and figured there must be a reason for it, so I decided to finally check them out.

Shipping was quick, and my order was in my hands 7 days after I placed it, so these were resting for 11 days before I began testing one a day. They include two free samples, which they say they choose to complement your order, and I believe them; both of mine were winners, which almost never happens.

However, I'm not quite sure what I was thinking when I made these selections. I usually like to try a wide variety of scents to get a feel for a house's range, and this is much same-ier than my first orders usually are. Oh well; I did it to myself. I'm basically gambling on whether or not I like the Silver Base (and to be fair to past me, if I do, I'll want to catch ‘em all). Let's see if I win!


**Angelic Host (9th) Seraphim** *Simple and beautiful, elemental and hypnotic. Five vanillas (most of them fat and buttery vanillas cut with lean and sharp vanillas) and are blended with six different ambers which give the hypnotic part to the whole.*

I'm always down for a good amber vanilla, and this one is stunning. It opens with a full on briny note, and then slides into a kaleidoscope of different ambers and vanillas. It almost feels like they're pulsating off of me. One inhale is rich and almost cookie like; the next is cool and misty. They're actually jostling for position, and they're all gorgeous so far. There's musk, cologne, fruitiness, spice, powder... I haven't detected the kitchen sink yet, but it wouldn't surprise me if it turned up. Just really, really pretty. It's got facets. This would probably be really fun to enjoy with hallucinogens. 

The amazing special effects lasted about 30 minutes.  An hour later, it's settled into a rich, dimensional ambre vanille, though I'll still get the occasional waft of what seems like a totally different perfume. There's a bit of a darker tone to it, bronze or brown, and a bit more powder from the ambers, but it still clearly contains multitudes. It does generally pull sweet, but isn't all that edible. I'd love to try more of that 'sharp' vanilla; it's quite striking when it turns up. 

Surprisingly short longevity, given that on my skin vanilla oil perfumes are typically semi-permanent. Two hours in and it's become subtle. I doubt it will make it to four. Still worth it for that incredible opening; honestly, an excuse to reapply is probably a value add here. 

Another pleasant surprise. It ends up as a nice slightly smokey amber and hangs around for hours more.


**Beatrice** *The Silver base combines with five of the most beautiful musks° which Possets produces. This is soft but long lasting, subtle but wraps itself around your mind. It is a hypnotic sort of a blend. °Skin musk, 2 white musks, “Crystalline” musk,and a grey musk.*

My first impression is powder, the kind that comes in ornate packaging with a furry pouf inside. Then the Silver base unfolds with a rich, sweet nuttiness; this time I barely get vanilla from it. It also has a waxy quality to it, not quite full on lipstick, but combined with the powder it's very evocative of makeup. It's definitely in the same family as Venus Black, but if that was a writing desk, this is the boudoir dressing table. The throw is fairly weak, and a half hour in feels like it's starting to fade. It's nice, but I don't think it's for me. 

An hour later, it's normal vanilla Silver base with a bit of powder.


**High Tea** *A very true to tea blend. Infused with lemon, sugar, milk, and that indescribable scent of the best starched linens, High Tea is your antidote to vulgarity. Characteristics: unisex. refreshing, tea, sweet, cooling, summer scent, warming winter scent, foody, gourmand.*

Teatime scents are the one gourmand I consistently tend to like, but unfortunately,  this one is not among them. There is tea and lemon here, probably quite nice ones given the strength of the lemon, but they're buried under an avalanche of weird tropical fruit? It's almost like a fruit punch from concentrate loaded with extra artificial flavors and preservatives. If dry fruity sugar cereal (Trix, Froot Loops) could start to rot, I bet it would smell like this. There's a vague sweetness that I assume is the sugar, but nothing I can recognize as linen or milk (and I was hesitant because BPAL's milk notes tend to go sour on me). It's not a full blown scrubber, but it's not at all what I expected and I find it unpleasant. 

I left it on for half an hour and it began developing a burnt coffee note. I'm tapping out before it gets worse.


**Pavane** *Silver Cardamom, the sweetest of the strains of cardamom (something nice enough to put in a pasha’s coffee) and the exquisite Silver base for which Possets is famous. Add a tot of artemisia, and a pinch of coumarin and the result is a fabulously gourmand to tempt even those on a diet against the gourmand world.*

Merely opening the vial blasted me with sticky sugary sweetness; I'm not sure what exactly it is (if you are, please tell me so I can avoid it forever), but it's tied with whatever chocolate note BPAL puts in Gluttony for my most hated note in perfumery, and the main reason I avoid dessert-y gourmands. I had to think about whether or not I reeeeally wanted to skin test this. but it's been awhile since I've actually interacted with one, so I did. The sweetness did die down a bit, but a few minutes in and it's still a mega sugar bomb. I can't identify a single other thing in the blend. I also fear I got a little bit on the outside of my septum. Sigh. 

Half an hour in, I might be detecting the Silver base, or it might be wishful thinking. This is so flat and overpowering. It's like an olfactory airhorn. Tinnitus of the nose.

Starting to get the other notes after an hour. There's a soft, dry, slightly acerbic note that I assume is the artemisia. That seems like it goes nicely with the Silver base, but it's hard to tell when they're drowning in syrup. 

Two hours in and it's almost gone. At least it's over quickly. If you enjoy the sweetness often found in bakery perfumes, you might like it, but ""gourmand for people who don't like gourmands"" it is not.


**Silver Carnations** *Long lasting and just beautiful from the start, Silver Carnations stays true from the first moment until the last. The “silver” part that you love combined with the spice and flower carnation that you will love. A winner.*

This may be my favorite carnation note yet! The spicy floral is there, but it's unexpectedly green and vegetal, very much like an actual growing plant. The Silver base is a sweet, foodier vanilla that is surprisingly far back in the blend. It's wet green carnation with an aura of sweetness and a general *sense* of vanilla unless I get right on my wrist and huff. Imagine sitting next to a well watered potted carnation whose flowers are just starting to open while eating a vanilla creme wafer. Interesting!  

The vanilla comes forward as it sinks in. I'm having trouble telling; it's either a touch sweeter or more buttery than I'd like it to be, but it's very nice. As the scent unfolds, it's starting to feel like a weirder combo. There isn't a lot of 'blend' here, just two good but pretty dissimilar smells happening at the same time. 

After an hour, it's settled into a fresh green vanilla with some spice from the carnation. All parts are still present, but they've merged. Very unusual; I think the vanilla is too foodie for this to really work, but it's a cool idea. I will definitely be looking for more of their carnation note; it's really something. I hope they have a nice graveyard scent with it.


**Wings Of An Angel** *This is the evolution of the much loved, but discontinued Scent of Angels, and in many ways it is superior. Hawthorn, white musk, a touch of ethereal mintiness, gorgeous regal vanilla Bourbon. An instant classic.*

This is wonderful; I totally understand why it's a classic and may be full sizing. A thin and elegant but sweet vanilla that almost reads more like white chocolate to me somehow fades away at the edges into a misty, almost ozonic background with a hint of a different kind of sweetness (purple fruit?) occasionally peeping out. I don't really get white musk from this at all, which is odd as it's one of my favorites, nor can I differentiate the hawthorn, but I'm sure they're part of what makes the background so intriguing. I really love this; I could absolutely see the Queen of the Unicorns or the Princess of Heaven wearing something like this. 

An hour later the mistiness has faded a bit, but is still much more evident than I'd expect from such a light scent; it's impressive. The vanilla has opened up and is faintly spicy, giving the whole thing a slightly more incense-y vibe. Still love it. 

Four hours in and it's quite faded, but still recognizably itself. I'm assuming this is a particularly translucent white musk; given the components I'm impressed with the longevity. And I say this after having just glanced back over the notes: I have never at any point gotten mint from it. Definitely buying a bottle of this.

And my two free samples;

**Silver Narcissus** *a stunning fragrance that combines the luxurious Possets' Silver Base with the iconic Narcissus flower, evoking the essence of a warm and vibrant spring morning.*

This is a beautiful narcissus, neither as dark nor as sweet as I usually encounter it, but very green and a little wet. This is the first time I think the Silver base has really shined; it provides a soft yet sturdy support to the flower but doesn't compete at all. 

Half an hour in and the narcissus is starting to stretch its legs. I still wouldn't call it narcotic, but it's trending that way. The Silver base is mostly hiding under it, but provides a neutral sweetness that's quite nice. The throw seems pretty close. 

Two hours later, it's still present but very quiet. Longevity could be better, but I still recommend this one to all narcissus enthusiasts; it's just a really nice showcase, like a gem in a setting, that's suitable for pretty much all occasions. 


**Venus Black** *The Blackest musk flirts with a float of black pepper, a shot of dark sweet pear, and the smallest amount of sage and non-stinky narcissus for tingle. One not to be missed. Dry, musky, spicy.*

I really like this one! Sage is usually a no for me, but other than a bit of tangy sweetness from the pear on the end of the inhale, I can't really tell what's in here; sans notes, I might have worked out the pepper on my own eventually. It has an almost papery quality, but only the finest of stationery. This feels sort of like sitting at the writing desk of a powerful and elegant matriarch. It does read as kind of old ladyish, but, like, Jessica Lange. Has a fairly short throw, but I like a small scent bubble.  Not great longevity (4 hours later, it's recognizable but a ghost of itself) but I may full size this. Totally not my usual thing, but it's delightful. 


So Possets is very hit or miss for me, but the hits are out of this world! I genuinely have no idea what's going on with either Angel scent or Venus Black, but they're phenomenal! The Silver base ended up being pretty meh for me, but their musks seem very unusual; none I encountered were even a touch animalic, and might have gone unrecognized were it not for the list of notes, though they're often very present in the blend. I definitely want to explore more.

I have a handful of their Halloween scents coming from Ajevie, and I'll be throwing another sample pack in with my bottle of Wings Of An Angel. (And I see they've just released Venus Black as a spray; what a perfect excuse to check that out.) I definitely want to try Madame X and Midnight Mass At Old St. Mary's. Does anyone have any further recommendations?

1o8x3zf,https://www.reddit.com/r/libraryofshadows/comments/1o8x3zf/theres_something_under_the_boardwalk_part_1/,There’s Something Under The Boardwalk [Part 1],"
If you’re reading this, it’s because I have no other choice. Nobody will listen to me, not even the police. It’s only a matter of time before they come for me, and when they do, this is the only evidence of the truth. There is something under the boardwalk in Paradise Point, and it’s hungry.

October is always a terribly slow month. We’re barely open, but the owners want to squeeze every penny they can before this town is completely empty. Even on a Friday night, it’s already a ghost town. That’s where this all began — a cold, deafeningly quiet night at the record shop I spend my days working in.

“Spectre’s: Records & Rarities”; a store that really was dead in the water until vinyl made a huge comeback. We also sold shirts that you might find a middle schooler wearing, even though they wouldn’t be able to name a single song off the album they’re donning. It really was a place frozen in time — the smell of dust and the decay of better days always filled the room.

The best way to pass the time on a night like this would be to find a forgotten record to play. That was my favorite game — finding an album I’d never heard of and giving it a chance to win me over. After all, if I’m not going to play them, who will?

Tonight’s choice: “Secret Treaties” by Blue Öyster Cult. Of course, I knew “Don’t Fear the Reaper” — who doesn’t? I never sat down and listened to their albums, even though their logo and album artwork always intrigued me. Seeing the album made me think of my dad. I remember him telling me about seeing them live with Uriah Heep at the old Spectrum in the 70’s. I bet he still had the ticket stub, too. God, he loved that place. I even remember seeing him shed a tear the day they tore it down.

The opening chords of “Career of Evil” blared out of my store speakers as I dropped the needle. Had my mind not been elsewhere, I wouldn’t have startled myself into spilling my coffee. The previously white album cover and sleeve were now browned and tainted. Who would want it now? Looks like it was coming home with me. After all, a song titled “Harvester of Eyes” certainly had a place in my collection. The owner wouldn’t care anyway — he had jokingly threatened to set the store ablaze for insurance money. Had this shop not been attached to others on this boardwalk, I wouldn’t have put it past him.

The opening track sold me, and given the state of business, I decided it was time to close up shop. The only thing louder than BÖC was the ticking clock that sat above an old “Plan 9 From Outer Space” poster. Just as the second track reached its finale, I lifted the needle. I retrieved one of our spare plastic sleeves to prevent any more damage and stowed it away in my backpack.

I took a walk outside to see if there were any stragglers roaming the boards. All I could see was a long and winding road of half-closed shops and stiffened carnival rides lit only by the amber sky of an autumn evening. Soon it would be dark, and the boardwalk would belong to the night and all that inhabited it.

The garage doors of the shop slammed shut with a finality that reminded me of the months to come. The sound echoed around me, only to be consumed by the wind. It wasn’t nearly as brutal as the gusty winter months, but it swirled with the open spaces as if it were dancing with the night. The padlock clicked as I scrambled the combination, and I turned to greet the darkness that painted over the beach. Summer was truly over now.

The soundtrack of carnival rides, laughter, and stampeding feet was replaced with the moans of hardwood under my feet. Each step felt like I was disturbing somebody’s grave. That was the reality of this place — four months out of the year, it’s so full of life that it’s overwhelming. The rest of its time is spent as a graveyard that is hardly visited. Maybe that’s why I never left. If I don’t visit, who will?

Speaking of visiting — this was the point of my trek home that I saw Bane. They called him that because he was a rather large man, built like a hulking supervillain. In reality, he was as soft as a teddy bear but, unfortunately, homeless. Even from the distance I saw him — which was two blocks away — there was no mistaking him. I only ever saw him sparingly; he never stayed in the same place for long and often slept under the boardwalk. I often thought he was self-conscious of his stature and didn’t want to scare people.

I could see that he must have been taking in the same swirling twilight sky I had seen earlier. Now, he was merely entertaining the stars. Looking to my left, I saw that Vincent’s Pizzeria was closing up shop. They must have had a better run of business than I did.

I slinked over to the counter to see a solitary slice looking for a home in the display case. The girl working the counter had her back to me, and as I began to make an attempt for her attention, she screamed.

“Oh my god! You scared me!” she gasped.

Chuckling nervously, I apologized. “I’m sorry, I just wanted to grab that slice before you closed up.”

I made an honest try at a friendly smile, and she laughed.

“Sure, sure. Three bucks.”

As she threw the slice in the oven to warm it up, she turned her attention back to me. “So, any plans tonight?”

I thought about it, and I really didn’t have any. I knew my ritual at this point — work and then visit Mick’s for a drink or two until I’ve had enough to put me to sleep.

“I was going to head over to Mick’s, maybe catch the game for a bit.”

She grinned. “I know Mick’s — right around the corner, yeah? Maybe I’ll stop by. There isn’t much else to do on a night like tonight.”

I handed her a five and signaled to her to keep the change.

“Maybe I’ll see you there,” I said half-heartedly, giving one last smile as I departed.

She waved, and I focused my attention on the walk ahead. She seemed plenty nice — might be nice to interact with someone. First, I had something I wanted to do.

Bane was right where I last saw him, except now he was gathering his things. I approached him with some haste.

“Hey bud, I haven’t seen you in a while.”

When he turned to see it was me, a smile grew across his face. “Hey Mac, long time.”

In my patented awkward fashion, I continued. “It’s been dead out here, huh?”

Without looking up, he lamented, “Sure has. It’s that time of year. Certainly not going to miss it.”

Puzzled, I pressed him. “What do you mean?”

Once he finished packing his bag, he sighed and his baritone voice continued. “I need to get some help. I’m going to go to that place in Somerdale and finally get myself clean.”

He sounded so absolute in what he was saying. I couldn’t have been happier.

“That’s great, man! I’d give you a ride myself if I had a car.”

I chuckled — that really did make my night.

He took another deep breath. “I just need to see her again.”

He revealed a small photo in his pocket, presenting it in his large hands. The picture showed a newborn baby girl in the hands of the man in front of me.

“I haven’t really seen her since she was born. Once I lost my job and… everything just started falling apart…” he trailed off.

He shook it off to say, “I’m just ready. Tonight’s my last night — I have my bus ticket ready to go, first thing in the morning. I just thought I would take in one last sunset and say goodbye to the others. I saved enough money to get me one night at The Eagle Nest.”

I was hard-pressed to find words. I didn’t know he had a daughter. It was a lot to take in, but above all, I was so thrilled to hear what he was setting off to do.

Remembering what I had in my hands, I spoke up. “Vincent’s was closing up, and I thought you could use a bite. Since this is going to be the last time I’ll see you, I won’t take no for an answer.”

We both smirked. He reached up for the quickly cooling slice of pizza.

“That’s really nice of you, Mac. I appreciate it.”

Not sure what else to do, I shot my hand forward to him for a shake. “I really think what you’re doing is great. It’s been nice knowing you.”

He reached his enormous paw to mine and shook it. “You too. I’d say I’ll see you again, but I really hope it’s not here.”

He chuckled as he swung his bag onto his back. I smiled back and waved goodbye. As we made our separate ways, a question occurred to me.

“Hey, what’s your real name, by the way? Maybe I’ll look you up someday to see how you’re doing.”

Without turning fully around, he said, “It doesn’t really matter.”

With that, he retreated into the night and left me to wonder what he meant by that.

I was soon reaching the block where Mick’s resides. The pub was right off the boardwalk — the neon lights that illuminated nearby were shining across the face of The Mighty King Kong ride. Thankfully, my work and home were all within a short walk of one another. Mick’s served as the ever-so-convenient median between the two. Mick’s was also where I picked up shifts in the offseason. They must have noticed the frequency with which I visited and decided to offer me a job. It was a solid gig — Mick’s was one of the few year-round places on the island. Locals gravitated toward it once the summer crowds dissipated. If I was going to spend my time there, I figured I might as well get paid.

Just as I was rounding the corner to the off-ramp, something happened. A loose board that hugged the wall greeted my sneaker and sent me tumbling down. All this tourism revenue, and this damn boardwalk is still old enough for Medicare.

I turned over onto my side to see where my backpack had landed. It was adjacent to the culprit. I groaned as I reached over to grab it — when something caught my eye.

Along the wall, hiding just below the wood, I saw what looked like a wasp’s nest. It was peeking out from the dark at me, almost as if it was watching me. I peered at it with the light of the pub guiding me.

This wasn’t a wasp’s nest.

It was a sickly pale yellow. Its texture looked wet, almost as if it was hot candle wax burning from a flame. Maybe the fall had disoriented me, but I could swear I saw it moving — rising and falling ever so subtly. Like it was… breathing?

I adjusted my eyes as I leaned in. It wasn’t very big — maybe the size of a tennis ball. It was riddled with holes, craters that left very little room for much else. I couldn’t help but glare at them.

Then it happened.

Other than that it’s just trucking through. Our ‘hell’ week was tempered by the fact that like 15% of the class has/had Covid or some other type of URI so the Chiefs stayed away from us so they didn’t get sick 😂 we are required to wear masks though for the next like 7 days…

Had another room inspection, death by PowerPoint is a VERY real possibility. BUT we earned our rank tabs and coffee and dessert! At least until we screw up and they take it away (and I’m sure we will at some point!) we’ll hear later today about the liberty brief for this weekend but today is just all classes.

1o8x3xg,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaPlace/comments/1o8x3xg/which_city_do_you_think_gives_the_best_quality_of/,Which city do you think gives the best ‘quality of life’ in India  and why?,"very city in India has its own vibe — Mumbai never sleeps, Bangalore runs on coffee and traffic, Delhi lives loud, and Pune just… *chills*.

I’ve lived in a couple of cities — and it’s funny how “quality of life” means totally different things depending on where you are .In Mumbai, I loved the energy and late-night safety — but rent was insane, and weekends felt more like recovery days   
Then I spent a few months in Pune — slower pace, cleaner air, and somehow everyone looked *less stressed*.  
A friend in Hyderabad swears it’s the perfect balance — tech jobs, great food, and affordable housing (for now It made me wonder  is quality of life about peace, paychecks, or people?  
Because sometimes a small town with fewer malls and more calm feels way richer than a metro full of rush.

So what do you think

***Hi there internet stranger !*** I'm a 20 year old from South Africa hoping to meet a dumbass who is into dumbassery just as much as I am, mainly a buddy to text about everything and nothing and the glorious nonsense in between , If that sounds like you then keep reading :)

**Here are some random things about me to see if we have a click :**  
I’m a 20 year old , I have ADHD (read: I find something new to fixate on every other week). I enjoy reading (currently reading: *Het gouden ei* by Tim Krabbé), journaling, baking, crafting. I love making a million playlists for every mood or vibe and end up never listening to them again (and then hoarding them on my iPod). I don’t enjoy watching movies but am into series (currently: *Lang Leve de Liefde*, *KOTH*). I love going to cafés and drinking too much coffee or tea. I like playing online crossword puzzles, going down YouTube rabbit holes, reading Wikipedia articles and just chilling in the sun doing whatever. I speak 3 languages and I’m slowly learning a 4th. I am up for talking to pretty much anyone to see if we have a click!

**Things to expect if we become friends**  
• Good morning messages (might not be sent in the morning)  
• Random song recommendations  
• Someone that you can annoy at any time of the day  
• Virtual coffee dates (or whatever drink floats your boat)

**Disclaimer**  
DON’T JUST SEND ME HI / HELLO / HEY / HOW ARE YOU? If you do this I probably won’t answer so please send me a little intro about yourself! (pretty please) <3",2,1760694726.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,2,1.0,False

I currently have a 10 month old baby who has limited  contact/relationship with my husband’s side of the family. My husband’s parents are divorced although still have good relationships, in fact his dad insists on being very vocal about how good his relations are with ex-wife. Strange to me. 

Me and MIL were never close prior to baby, we’re two very different personalities and honestly just don’t gel. I find her dismissive and rude and she probably finds me loud and annoying. She’s very socially awkward, sits silent at a dinner table etc apart from wee jabs here and there. Husband things she’s trying to be funny and get it wrong. The problem is post baby I suffered quite badly from PPD, it shocked me and shook me honestly. I wanted to just be at home with my husband and my baby. However MIL was asking to come visit at the hospital and come to our house etc, I agreed to a visit and it was just too early and just left me feeling resentful and annoyed. This continued and MIL started a whole victim narrative of “I’m not
Involved, I want to help more, if you don’t want me to be involved I’ll step away” and this was after my husband had continued to tell her we need time and space and this relationship isn’t just going to magically change overnight and that’s reflective of where we’re at. Long story short poor husband was dragged to multiple “coffees” to just discuss how she felt left out etc. but she never actually practically helped, never did washing, never dropped dinner, continually kissed the baby after we asked not to multiple times and the baby was always uncomfortable with her and never settled. She was a particularly fussy baby in honestly and only really settled with me or dad. 

Anyway my issue is, mother in law has a new grandchild and all of the “I want to help” has faded now baby is older. I always found it hard as she never engaged or seemed like she wanted to do anything other than hold the baby. She always would say the right things but never actually actioned. I really do want my child to have a good relationship with grandparents and I’m not niave to the fact me and husband need help. I don’t know whether I’m holding back and being resentful or how to move forward. I guess I’m just looking for similar insight or experiences ",3,1760694601.0,motherinlawsfromhell,2,1.0,False

1o8wzcq,https://i.redd.it/1tchm4w68nvf1.jpeg,When Sugar Sneaks into the Daily Plate: The Hidden Food Habits of Pune Locals Leading to Diabetes,"In a city where food is both culture and comfort, Pune’s love for flavor often comes with a quiet cost — rising cases of diabetes. From office canteens to street corners, what we eat daily plays a major role in shaping our health.

[Dr. Satish Gupta](https://g.co/kgs/oN1pPAG), a renowned Diabetologist, explains that diabetes isn’t just about sugar intake — it’s about consistent choices that lead to poor metabolism and insulin resistance. He points out that certain eating habits among Pune locals have quietly fueled the city’s growing diabetes concern.

If you’ve been noticing frequent thirst, fatigue, or blurred vision, it’s time to visit Dr. Satish Gupta — one of the most trusted diabetologists in Aundh, Baner, Balewadi, Pashan, Bhavdhan, Pimpri Gurav, Pimpri Saudagar, Wakad, and nearby areas. With over 10 years of expertise, he offers advanced diagnostic and treatment solutions for managing diabetes effectively.

# Common Foods in Pune Contributing to Diabetes

# 1. Excessive Carbohydrate Intake

* **Polished rice and refined flour**: Staple in many Maharashtrian dishes, but stripped of fiber and nutrients, leading to rapid sugar spikes.
* **Bhakri made from wheat or jowar**: Healthy in moderation, but portion sizes often go unchecked.

# 2. Sugary Beverages and Tea Culture

* Pune’s tea stalls and cafés serve **sugar-loaded chai**, cold coffee, and soft drinks daily.
* Many office-goers consume 3–4 cups of tea daily, each with 2 teaspoons of sugar — adding up silently.

# 3. Bakery and Snack Items

* **Vada pav, samosa, and bhajiya** dominate the city’s fast-food culture.
* Frequent intake of **refined oil, maida, and trans fats** increases insulin resistance.

# 4. Evening Snacking Habits

* Late-night snacks and processed foods like **chips and packaged namkeen** elevate calorie intake.
* Skipping dinner or eating heavy post 9 p.m. disturbs insulin sensitivity.

# 5. Sweet Treats and Celebrations

* Pune loves its **Shrewsbury biscuits, modaks, and pedhas**, but festive indulgence often extends year-round.
* Continuous consumption increases body fat and liver load, worsening sugar regulation.

# The Lifestyle Factor

# 1. Sedentary Work Culture

Corporate jobs and long hours in front of screens mean minimal movement. Even healthy eating can’t offset inactivity.

# 2. Lack of Sleep

Late-night gadget use and stress reduce insulin efficiency, making even moderate sugar intake harmful.

# 3. Stress Eating

Caffeine and comfort food during stressful hours lead to overeating and sugar cravings.

# Dr. Satish Gupta’s Guide to Healthier Eating Habits

**1. Choose Whole Over Refined-** Opt for unpolished rice, multigrain roti, and millet-based meals. These provide steady glucose release and reduce sugar spikes.

**2. Limit Tea and Coffee Sugars-** Switch to unsweetened beverages or use minimal jaggery instead of white sugar.

**3. Snack Smart-** Replace fried snacks with nuts, roasted chana, or sprouts to maintain satiety without raising blood sugar.

**4. Hydrate Smartly-** Avoid fruit juices and soft drinks. Instead, drink infused water with mint or cucumber.

**5. Practice Portion Control-** Even healthy foods can cause spikes if eaten excessively. Balanced plates prevent insulin overload.

Many Pune residents assume diabetes develops only due to sugar intake, but **daily food habits and inactivity** are the real culprits. Early consultation with a [Diabetologist near me](https://g.co/kgs/oN1pPAG) can help in early diagnosis, lifestyle modification, and prevention of long-term complications like heart or kidney diseases.

Pune’s rich food culture can still be enjoyed — but wisely. Cutting down refined carbs, managing portion sizes, and regular activity can make a huge difference. As Dr. Satish Gupta emphasizes, “It’s not about eating less, but eating right.”

They accepted this for a minute and then started pestering me more, which was ironic cos the week before they’d been complaining about being sick so?!? 

Lately they’ve been annoying me in loads of other ways, and other people - being unreliable and disrespectful on a small and large scale. 

It got to the point where I got really angry when I got home. I got really annoyed that they can’t respect my sobriety but also my decisions with what I do with my time. Especially as they don’t have anything going on in their life and won’t do anything to change that.

Turns out, not that hard! Fuelled by about five cups of coffee and with a great deal of help from GitHub Copilot and Gemini, I managed to code a working version in about three hours. It was surprisingly straightforward once I had written out a solid prompt for the AI to follow.

The funny part? Actually getting it approved for the Chrome Web Store. That took two full days. That felt like an eternity compared to the coding part.

The extension itself is pretty simple and does exactly what our users asked for:

* 1-Click Submit: On a page you want indexed? Click the icon, select 'Add Current Page', and you're done. No more copy-pasting!
* Bulk submission: Paste in a list of up to 10,000 URLs for large-scale projects.
* Secure: We have ensured that it uses minimal permissions and that your API key is stored only on your machine.

Here's the link if you want to check it out: [https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/speedyindex-link-indexing/ddadnbfgobchhhekhegnnjbakpbgilep](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/speedyindex-link-indexing/ddadnbfgobchhhekhegnnjbakpbgilep)

https://reddit.com/link/1o8ww2e/video/suwzw6t17nvf1/player

My main takeaway from this is that... If you want to make your customers happy, just build something that genuinely saves them time. It doesn't have to be a massive undertaking. Sometimes, a simple, useful tool can make all the difference.

Anyway, I just wanted to share my experience.

1o8wvho,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiddengeneticdiseases/comments/1o8wvho/anybody_else_have_genetic_diseases_they_never/,Anybody else have genetic diseases they never knew they had till too late?,"I just read an article about chronic disease or illness fakers.  I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

1o8wurn,https://www.reddit.com/r/AI_Leaderboard/comments/1o8wurn/the_secret_to_humansounding_ai_writing_after_too/,The secret to human-sounding AI writing (after too many hours of trial and error),"---

Most prompts make ChatGPT sound either robotic or overly polite.
So I spent weeks experimenting with structure, tone modifiers, and style cues — and I think I’ve cracked it.

Here’s the structure that consistently gives me natural, human-like writing.


---

Prompt Template:

> “Write this as if you were explaining it to a friend over coffee.
Use everyday words, short sentences, and natural transitions.
Keep it conversational but smart. Avoid formal tone.
Here’s my topic: [Insert your topic here].”




---

When I use this, ChatGPT’s writing becomes more flowy — it uses rhythm, pauses, and phrasing that actually feel alive.

Here’s a small example I tested:

Normal Prompt:

> “Explain blockchain technology in simple terms.”



🗣️ New Prompt:

> “Explain blockchain like you’re chatting with a friend who hates tech jargon.”




---

The second version? Way more readable and engaging.
It even added analogies like:

> “It’s like a digital notebook everyone shares but no one can erase.”



If your ChatGPT outputs sound robotic — try this “coffee chat” method.
It works across writing, scripts, essays, and even coding explanations.


---

Why it works:

You’re giving ChatGPT a social context it can emulate (“over coffee”).

It switches from academic to conversational rhythm.

You get natural pacing, human phrasing, and subtle personality.



---

Have you found any other tricks that make AI sound more human?
I’m collecting tone prompts — curious what’s worked for you.

1o8wuko,https://www.reddit.com/r/KoreaExperience/comments/1o8wuko/locals_guide_how_to_ride_city_buses_in_korea_like/,[Local’s Guide] How to Ride City Buses in Korea Like a Local (Seoul Focused),"Hi everyone!

In Korea, for international visitors, taking the subway in Seoul is usually easy to use because signs are in English, stations are numbered, and routes are simple to follow.

However, taking the bus can be a bit tricky if you’re new here because you may need to know some different rules are applied depending on types of buses.

This guide will help you understand how the bus system really works in Seoul (and surrounding areas), so you can travel confidently like a local.

---

# 1. Type of Buses

* Blue Bus(Mainline Bus) - Connects various districts of Seoul along major roads.
* Green Bus(Branch Bus) - Connects residential areas to subway stations and blue buses, linking multiple residential neighborhoods.
* Yellow Bus (Circular Bus) - Circulates around the city center.
* Green Smaller Local Bus (Village Bus or ""Mauel Bus"") - Operates short routes within a single district or area.
* Red (Wide-area Express Bus) - Connects Seoul city and its surrounding cities in Gyeonggi

---

# 2. Payment

\[**No cash**\]

* Even if you have cash in hand, you often can’t pay for your bus directly without a transportation card (e.g. T-money Card)
* Why? Since 2021, Seoul has gradually eliminated cash payments on city buses because cash payments dropped to less than 0.6%, and to improve fare management efficiency and ensure driver safety.
* Now, most buses in Seoul and Incheon no longer accept cash at all. Other major cities — including Gyeonggi-do, Daejeon, Jeju, Daegu, Gwangju, and Sejong are also testing or preparing to completely remove cash fare options this year.

\[**No overseas-issued Credit Cards**\]

* In most big cities like London, New York, Sydney, or Tokyo, you can just tap your credit card or phone (Apple Pay, Google Pay) directly at the subway gate. This is called an “Open-loop” payment system. However, Korea uses a closed-loop payment system, meaning you must buy and top up a T-money card (or similar prepaid card) to use public transportation. Thus, even if your Visa or Mastercard supports contactless “tap-to-pay”, Korean transit readers will not recognize it.
* Exception: Only Jeju Island now supports open-loop Visa payments (since Aug 2025). Just tap your Visa card to board Jeju city buses — no T-money needed.
* Good News! : Beginning next year (2026), international tourists visiting Seoul will be able to ride city buses using their overseas-issued credit cards, without needing a separate T-money transit card.

\[**Buy and top up a T-money card (or similar prepaid card)**\]

* You need to purchase and top up a T-money card at convenience stores (CU, GS25, 7-Eleven) or subway stations.
* For other travel card options (EZL, Namane, WOWPASS, DSP, Climate Companion, Trip.PASS), I will make a separate post comparing all alternatives and which one fits your trip best.

---

# 3. At the Bus Stop

\[**Download Naver Map (or Kakaomap) or Check out the digital display board**\]

* Both apps show real-time bus arrivals and seat availability for most routes. They’re essential tools if you plan to use buses. You also need to check the exact bus stop location and direction.
* At most bus stops in Seoul, you’ll find a digital display board showing when each bus will arrive. It lists the bus number, destination, and estimated arrival time — usually in minutes (e.g. 3 min, 7 min).
* These screens update in real time, so you can see if your bus is approaching or delayed. If your bus doesn’t appear on the board, double-check that you’re standing at the correct stop and direction.

\[**Check the Exact Location of Your Bus Stop**\]

* In Seoul, it’s very important to check the exact location of your bus stop before you go. Some bus stops are located on the side of the road, while others are in the center of the street (called median bus lanes).
* If you stand at the wrong stop, your bus might pass right by on the opposite side! Use Naver Map or KakaoMap to check the exact bus stop location and direction. These apps show both “inbound” and “outbound” stops, so make sure you’re waiting on the correct side for your route.

\[**Red Bus Stops**\]

* Special Red Express Bus stops are for routes going to Gyeonggi Province (outside Seoul). They are often separate from regular city bus stops and may have different platforms or lanes, so double-check the signs or platform letters before boarding.
* Unlike other buses, people line up in queues before boarding for red buses because the buses do not allow standing passengers (all seats must be taken before departure). Thus, always check out platform number or bus number, usually marked on the ground.
* At the front of the bus, you’ll see a digital sign showing remaining seats (e.g., “Seats: 2”). If it says “Full” or “0,” wait for the next bus. (You can also find seat availability through Naver Map or Kakaomap (or Kakaobus).

\[**Smaller Green Bus (Village or ""Maeul"" Bus) Stops**\]

* The ""Maeul Buses"" usually stop at smaller neighborhood bus stops, often just a few meters away from main bus stations. These stops are usually simpler, with small green poles instead of full shelters.
* Since routes are short and mostly serve local residents, make sure you’re at the exact stop listed in your app before boarding.

\[Tip\]

* The Maeul (village) buses can be confusing or inconvenient for first-time visitors. They mostly serve local neighborhoods and are used by residents who already know the routes.
* Even if you transfer from a subway station, these buses don’t leave immediately, they often depart according to their set schedule rather than on demand. Because of this, you may have to wait 10–20 minutes depending on the route and time of day.
* So unless your destination is deep inside a residential area, it’s usually more convenient to walk or take a green city bus instead.

\[**Hold your card in your hand before the bus arrives**\]

* In Korea, bus boarding is lightning-fast (usually under 2\~3 seconds per person!) Locals already have their transit card, phone, or credit card ready in hand before the bus even stops.
* If you start digging through your bag for your card at the door, you might feel uncomfortable stares from the locals behind you.

---

# 4. Inside the Bus

\[**How to get on and off the Bus**\]

* Korean buses have different boarding and exit doors depending on the type of bus.
   * Blue, Green, Yellow Buses (City Buses) - Board: Front door / Exit: Rear door
   * Red Buses (Express / Intercity Buses) - Board & Exit: Front door only
   * Green Smaller Buses (Village Buses / “Maeul Bus”) → Only one door

\[**How to use a transit card**\]

* When you get on, tap your transit card on the card reader next to the driver.
* Before stepping off, tap your card again on the rear card reader to check out. (This second tap is very important which tells the system your ride is complete.)
* If you forget to tag your card when getting off, you may hear no message, but you’ll lose your transfer discount and be charged the maximum fare next time.
* You’ll also lose your transfer discount, meaning you’ll pay the full fare again for your next bus or subway ride.
* If you’re paying for more than one person, tell the driver the number of passengers before tapping your card.

\[**Understanding Korean Transit Card Reader Messages**\]

* You’ll hear one of followings:
   * Beep! — “Normal fare applied.” → Your card has been accepted and the fare is paid.
   * “환승입니다” (Hwan-seung im-ni-da) — “Transfer applied.” → The system recognizes your transfer from another bus or subway within the allowed time. You’ll only pay the difference, not the full fare again.
   * ""잔액이 부족합니다” (Jan-aek-i bu-jok-ham-ni-da) — “Insufficient balance.” → Your card doesn’t have enough money. Please recharge at a convenience store or subway top-up machine before riding again.
   * “하차 처리 안 됐습니다” (Ha-cha cho-ri an dwaet-seum-ni-da) — “Previous trip not completed.” → You didn’t tag your card when getting off the bus or subway last time. You’ll lose your transfer discount and may be charged the maximum fare.
   * “처리할 수 없습니다” (Cheo-ri-hal su eop-seum-ni-da) — “Card error / Cannot process.” → The card didn’t scan properly. So try to tap again, or use another card.

**\[Paying for multiple people on a bus\]**

* Tell the driver how many people ""before"" you tap the card.
* The driver will register the number on their terminal, then you tap once and the system charges the correct fare for everyone.
* If you don’t speak Korean, no worries. Just use your fingers to show the number (e.g., hold up two fingers for two people). Drivers understand this gesture.

\[TIP\]

* It’s better not to use one card for multiple riders if you’re transferring between the subway and bus.
* Why? - In Korea, each passenger must tap their own card at the subway gate. The gate only opens once per tap so you can’t pay for multiple people with one card like you can on a bus. The system won’t recognize the transfer properly and you’ll lose your transfer discount.
* Also, if you’re traveling with children, you can buy a child T-money card (available at convenience stores or subway stations). It automatically applies the child fare when tapped.

**\[Seating & Etiquette\]**

* Priority seats (노약자석), marked with a “노약자석 (Priority Seat)” sticker, are usually yellow or orange and located near the front of the bus. They are reserved for the elderly, people with disabilities, pregnant women, and passengers with infants.
* Pregnant seats (임산부석) are usually bright pink and may be located near the middle or back of the bus. These are strictly for pregnant women, even if they are not visibly pregnant.
* On buses, the rules are a bit more relaxed than in the subway. Sometimes people sit in priority seats if no one else needs them. However, if an elderly person or pregnant woman (or child) is standing near you, it’s polite to stand up and offer your seat immediately.
* No eating or drinking.
   * Food and drinks (even coffee or water) are not allowed on the bus.
* Don’t block the driver’s area or the exit.
   * It’s important to move toward the back as soon as you board so that other passengers can get on quickly.
* Keep your voice down.
   * Talking loudly, taking phone calls, or playing music without headphones is considered impolite.
* Hold onto the handrails or straps.
   * Buses often brake suddenly due to traffic.

**\[Getting Off the Bus\]**

* Press the red “Stop” button (하차벨) before your stop so the driver knows to stop.
   * It is a right time to press the button right after the stop is announced.
   * If you don’t press the stop button in advance, the bus may skip your stop completely.
* After pressing the button, move toward the exit door
   * If you stay seated until the last moment, the driver might think no one is getting off and leave the stop before you reach the door.
* Always tap your card on the reader before stepping off to finish your ride and keep your transfer discount.

\[TIP\]

* Always check your route in Naver Map or KakaoMap. They show your live bus location and next stop in real time.

---

# 5. Transfer Rules

**\[Public Transport Covered by the Transfer Discount\]**

* Seoul Buses: All buses(Blue, Green, Yellow, Red, and Smaller Green)
* Incheon & Gyeonggi Buses: All buses
* Subways: All Seoul(Line 1\~9), Incheon, Gyeonggi lines (including AREX, Shinbundang, Yongin, Ui-Sinseol, Gimpo Gold Line, etc.)
* GTX-A Line: High-speed metropolitan railway also eligible for transfer discounts

**\[Need to know\]**

* You can transfer up to 4 times (5 rides total) → Example: Bus → Subway → Bus → Subway → Bus = All eligible for discount
* After the 5th ride, a new base fare will be charged.
* You cannot transfer to the same bus number again. (If you need to make a short distance round-trip within 30 mins, try to take the different bus number.)
* Transfers only apply when using a transport card.
   * If you need to take the subway and the bus, try to use a T-money or Ezl card from convenience store instead of buying a single trip ticket from subway vending maching.
* Children and youth also receive the same transfer benefits, but with lower fares.

**\[How the Fare is Calculated\]**

* Fares are charged based on total distance and the fare difference is added automatically.

|Time Period|Condition|
|:-|:-|
|Daytime (07:00–21:00)|Transfer within **30 minutes** after tapping off|
|Late Night (21:00–07:00)|Transfer within **60 minutes** after tapping off|

* Local Bus: Base 10km, then +100 KRW per 5km
* Express Bus: Base 30km, then +100 KRW per 5km",1,1760693816.0,KoreaExperience,0,1.0,False

1o8wsm6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o8wsm6,I released Monocle 2.0 • A modern take on window dimming for macOS,"Hi everyone! 👋

I'm Dominik, creator of Monocle, and I’m excited to introduce the new 2.0 update today.

**TLDR:** Honestly? Just visit [**Monocle's new website**](http://monocle.heyiam.dk/) and see it in action. I think it sells itself way better than I can. **(Oh, and I hid a little easter egg there. I'm sure it'll make your day. Can you find it?)**

If you're still reading…I started building Monocle almost a year ago as a personal project using Cursor (no coding skills at all) because traditional window dimmers always felt...well, ugly and boring to me.

Turns out I wasn't alone. Since launching the first version in March 2025, the response (especially here on Reddit) has shown me there's a whole community of people who believe beautiful design and powerful functionality aren't mutually exclusive.

**So what makes Monocle different?**

💭 Well, it's not just about productivity. It's about presence—feeling calm while you work, write, browse, think... It quiets everything down, so only what truly matters remains in focus.

It's also stunning—smooth gradients, buttery transitions, and a design so elegant that strangers at coffee shops stop to ask what you're using :)

And it's effortless—Monocle lives quietly in your menu bar. One click to focus. Shift-click to switch between gradient and fullscreen styles. That's it.

**What's new in 2.0:**

• Major update with silky-smooth transitions, expanded customization options, a completely redesigned Settings UI for macOS 26 Tahoe, easier license management, and countless polish touches that make everything feel more refined and intuitive.

**Website Overhaul**

• With this update, Monocle's website got a complete redesign to better reflect the app's philosophy. You can now experience how Monocle works and feels even before downloading—try the interactive simulation right on the website (desktop only).

**Monocle on Product Hunt!**

**Also, to mark this moment, I launched Monocle 2.0 on** [**Product Hunt**](https://www.producthunt.com/products/monocle-clear-workspace-clear-mind?launch=monocle-2-0-for-macos) **today. If you have a moment, stop by and upvote if you feel like it—it would mean a lot.**

I offer a 7-day free trial, no strings attached. Then one-time payment—$4 (single-seat license) or $9 (three seats). No subscriptions.

[**\[  Download \]**](https://monocle.heyiam.dk/)

So whether you're a minimalist, living with ADHD, or just seeking a calmer workspace... I think you'll love Monocle.

*The digital world is loud.*  
*Monocle makes it whisper.*

No specific age range or gender either, it doesn't matter as long as you’re an adult, speak english or french and are generally chill

If the vibe's there, we could just keep going afterwards, going for lunch, a dessert, a drink or whatever based on everyone's interest.

I’ll handle the reservation if needed and DM details to whoever’s interested once I post a date. No WhatsApp groups or Discords before, I'll just contact each person seperately directly on reddit with the time which is better than sharing private info (like a number) from the get-go.

I’m 39 and from Australia — easygoing, kind, honest, and the sort of person who doesn’t take life too seriously. I really value genuine connections, friends who can share a laugh one minute and a deep chat the next.

My world revolves around running, gym sessions, photography (landscapes and portraits), playing guitar, drawing, traveling, snorkeling, scuba diving when I can, and the occasional gaming night. I love a good mix of creativity and adventure.

I’m just here hoping to meet some friendly people to chat with — maybe share hobbies, random thoughts, or stories about life. I don’t mind different timezones either; it’s fun hearing from people everywhere.

So if that piques your interest I look forward to a chat message with the answer to - if we grabbed a coffee and went for a walk, what’s something you’d probably end up talking about first? ☕🌏",1,1760693209.0,chat,1,0.67,False

I live in germany and connecting with people is maybe my favorite thing. I'm afraid I'm not your typical german. There are (a lot of) times I feel like I don't belong here.

I find it hard to connect. I can talk to anyone, make friends and do things but truly connecting with someone is different. I want to understand how they function, what makes them smile, sad or angry. I want to understand how they view the world.

There are times I feel like I don't belong in this world because of the way I am. I have always had to adapt but deep down I'm a silly weird puppy. I yap a lot and when I get excited, I really get excited. I also like to be kind and want to help whenever I can. Standing up for people is very important to me because I didn't have that as a child, so of course I will want to do that.

I long to belong. It's hard for me to describe. I mean the things I say and I'm very loyal. I want to sit in silence and be okay with that. I want silence full of beauty and vulnerability. Vulnerability is so incredibly important to me, so is growth. I find growing to be painful but it is necessary and I need it.

I really need to grow. I'm not the type to stay comfortable all my life.

There are times in life in which I feel aimless, lost and then there are times I feel peaceful and know that tomorrow is a new day. I want to talk, share my experiences, share my pain and the things I want in life. I simply want to live to the fullest, with all the pain I have in me, all the laughter and the random thoughts. I want to share all of it.

I want to connect so deeply. I want to be vulnerable and experience everything so deeply and fully. I want it all. I really want it all. Some people want a lot of money or career. For me, it's connecting. It has always been that way and I don't mind it.

I'm very accepting and do not like to judge. Some get surprised how accepting I am but yeah.

The boring things: I like coffee quite a lot. I do a pour over every morning. I starting crochet and painting abstract. I also like to move my body and enjoy nature, traveling and so much more. I'm open to a lot of things. I can be introverted and switch to extroversion real quick - it depends. Watching movies/tv series is also nice.

Psychology is very important to me and analyzing people is something I do automatically at this point.

I don't know what you want in life but if you feel like you want the same thing, let me know.

1o8wl7j,https://www.reddit.com/r/autismUK/comments/1o8wl7j/a_rant_about_trades_people/,A rant about trades people,"I really hate getting work done on the house because of how unreliable tradesmen can be. It’s such a stressful experience and it always totally destroys my day. This is based on my anecdotal experience and may not relate to every tradesman out there.

1. late:
We were told he would be here at 8am, so I got up early so I could do my morning routine before he got here. The we got a text saying he wasn’t gonna be here until 2pm, so got up early for nothing. I had plans for once he had left and has to reorganise my whole day. 

2. so much tea/coffee?
I know it’s a courtesy thing to offer a drink when someone is here, but it takes the piss a little when they spend more time on a tea break than they do actually on the job. We don’t drink milk so having to go out and buy things that a stranger can drink (out of my mugs) when here is really weird. I don’t understand why these people don’t bring a flask or something.

3. they underestimate their stay.
I don’t like when some says “oh that’ll take 3 hours max” and then they’re here for almost 8 hours and don’t even get the job finished. I’m sat with the electrics turned off for 8 hours so can’t heat up any food or really do anything as I can’t leave the house

4. I’m an adult too!
I feel like there’s a kinda sexist narrative with tradesmen. I’m in a gay relationship but it was my partner who booked him in etc. I feel like tradesmen just don’t talk to anyone who isn’t “the man of the house” and it made me feel really grim. My partner had to relay information onto me because the guy would only talk to him, and make a very occasional comment to me about things unrelated to the job. It makes me feel like a child.

The worst part for me was the person we booked also had autism, so we thought they would be more understanding of things like routine and not have that general “chit chat, tea/coffee” vibe as small talk isn’t a thing in our home. 

Idk it was a stressful experience and now I’m gonna have to go through it all again next week

I really HATE when girls define themselves ""feminine"" because they like pink, skirt, frills and makeup... Like, bitch no, you just love those things! How the fuck should this be considered ""feminine"" Jesus Christ?!
As last, I'd like to say that I find (my personal opinion, don't get heated in the comments) kinda sexist when things are gendered like that. Because if you call putting on makeup ""feminine"" you exclude men/enbies from the activity, if you call playing videogames ""masculine"" you exclude women/enbies from the activity. Just think about it, how many times in the past boys have been labeled as ""sissies"" and girls as ""tomboys"" just because they liked something that was ""designed"" for the opposite sex? A lot of times.
And nowadays, why are we still doing it? Why are we still calling a girl wearing pink ""feminine"" and a boy going to the gym ""masculine""? Why can't we just live peacefully without pointlessly gendered labels?

*By The Sportswriter Who Still Believes in ""New Manager, New Team"" (Mostly for Comedy)*

---

**Parsing the Odds: A Tale of Two Sieves**  
Let’s cut to the chase: Espanyol is the favorite, but not by much. At decimal odds of \~2.55 (implied probability: \~39%), they’re the bookmakers’ pick to avoid another midweek humiliation. Oviedo, the newly promoted underdogs, sit at 3.0 (33%), while the draw hovers similarly. For context, these numbers are about as exciting as a spreadsheet arguing with a coffee mug.

Why the tepid support for Espanyol? Well, they’ve lost to Real Madrid and Betis this season, proving that even teams with playoff pedigree can’t beat clubs with playoff *haircuts*. Oviedo, meanwhile, is the La Liga version of a leaky balloon—struggling to hold air (i.e., points) but refusing to fully deflate. Their defense? A sieve that’s lost 14 goals in 8 games. If their backline were a restaurant, it’d have a one-star review: “Great ambiance… if ambiance meant getting food poisoning.”

---

**Digesting the News: Injuries, Headaches, and the Return of Luis Carrión**  
Real Oviedo’s story is one of *almost*. They’ve beaten Real Sociedad and Valencia—teams that, like Oviedo, are either desperate or delusional—but their six points are a mathematical miracle compared to their 14 goals conceded. Their savior? Manager Luis Carrión, returning like a Marvel superhero who forgot his spandex. Will his return spark a revival? Or is it just the “new manager, guaranteed win” trope, which is about as reliable as a casino’s “free drinks” policy?

Espanyol, meanwhile, is a team in transition. Manolo González’s squad started the season with a shock 2-1 win over Atlético Madrid—proof that La Liga still believes in fairy tales—but their four-game winless streak has them sweating about European qualification. Their defense? Not great. Their ability to lead in only one of their

To help you understand my case he said that my teeth shouldn't take more than 5 months to get into position. 

So, while he was looking at my teeth he mentioned that I have an open bit and it's about 3 or 4 - can't remember - teeth that touch. He said that even braces might not help, and that he recommends that I trim some of the teeth at the back to help the closer to the front touch. Obviously, to someone ignorant to dentistry trimming one's teeth doesn't sound pleasant at all, but he said that it's only the tips and only trimmed to the point that won't create issues. He reassured me that there are not dangers in doing so. Finally, he said that doing this before putting the aligners, might even help get more teeth to touch, potentially.

Overall, I have healthy teeth, brush them twice every day, and floss every day too. No smoking, drinking coffee/alcohol once/twice a week max.

It's a fantastic look into MSM culture of the 1970s and it's amazing how little has changed in such a long span of time (and also how much has changed).  BUT, there is a big thing.  They describe ""coming out of the closet"" NOT as living publicly as an MSM.  Quite explicitly in this book, ""coming out"" meant having your first MSM experience.  Is this really how it was used back then?  Was this maybe a regional difference?

The book is sort of a glossary of terms and they often have quite hot and heavy stories to go along with them.  The entry for **coming out** ends with this exchange (p61):

>You feel a little formal and tired and relaxed after the sun and the sex and the drama that's been taking place mainly in your head. Not too much gets said over the lobster, but some looks are exchanged, and during coffee he squeezes your hand under the table.

>""I never thought,"" he says, ''I'd be the one to bringsomeone out.""

>""To do what?"" you ask.

>""I just brought you out. Coming out . That means having your first gay experience.""

>The label sounds so strange to you. You'd thought the word should be ""freedom"" or maybe ""graduation."" But of course that is what they-no, we, I suppose-yes, we gay guys call it: ""coming out.""

It goes on a bit later describing a use that is much more like they modern notion (p64).  But it ALSO still explicitly means losing your gay virginity. (Virginity as a binary concept seems quite foreign to most modern queers and MSM I know.  Losing your virginity to many my age (20s) is a continuous process that happens each time you do something new).

>Coming out is not just the first time one has sex with another man. It is also the adoption of a psychological and social stance.  
...  
After one or many experiences someone coming out will have to say to himself, ""I'm gay."" To ever greater numbers of men who are entering gay life now this statement comes naturally and easily. Others, however, find self-acceptance harder to come by. They may have sporadic sexual contacts, but they shrink from admitting their homosexuality even to themselves. Still others may think of themselves as gay, but they do not let anyone else in on the secret (see *Self-esteem*). Of those who do come out publicly, some tell only one or two friends, some tell members of their families and some are quite frank with everyone. Most often we disclose our homosexuality to parents, brothers and sisters and intimate friends because we want no barriers to stand between us and the people we love.",0,1760692142.0,askgaybros,2,0.5,False
1o8weiu,https://www.reddit.com/r/PrincessCruises/comments/1o8weiu/sun_princess_halfway_point_review/,Sun Princess Halfway Point Review,"This is my first time cruising on Princess. I had a casino offer and picked an itinerary that I liked within the parameters of the offer. At the time of booking, I didn’t care or pay attention to which ship.

That being said, I’m currently halfway through a 10 day Mediterranean itinerary from Barcelona to Civitavecchia. Having booked in May, I had some time to do the usual Reddit lurking on this sub and look up YouTube reviews, etc. So by August, I kinda knew what to expect.

The ship is beautiful. It’s barely 2 years old and is still pristine. Very clean. None of the carpeting, even in high traffic areas, are showing signs of wear and tear. Seats, tables, doors, deck chairs- everything still looks and feels fresh and clean. YouTube had reviewers showing that everything on the ship was a grey monotone color, but that isn’t the case. There are several locations on the ship that has *more* of a grey aesthetic, but for the most part the ship also has a comfortable and cozy atmosphere. Even the Piazza, which I’ve read a lot of complaints about in this sub all summer, is cozy depending on the lighting and giant screen animations. Just depends on whatever activity is going on at the moment. It’s not like a traditional cruise ship atrium, but it’s a nice quasi-arena style central common area. I really like the Dome area. I wish they had some sort of option to pull back the glass panels to see the sky at night but if you walk through the Dome, you can see the sky directly in the *very* much appreciated 18+ only area at the front of the ship on deck 17. Great set up with that.

One complaint I do have is the MDR menu. It’s been underwhelming every single night, including on formal/dress to impress nights. The quality is fine, that’s not a question or issue here. But the menu itself, it’s just not delivering. I think this is where the “manage your expectations” comment has come from repeatedly in this sub. There are a lot of weird or otherwise unappealing dishes listed each night that don’t seem to belong on the menu at all. No “wow factor”, no “ooo, that looks good!” factor. Just… blah.

The layout of The Eatery and the Americana Diner make no sense. They push everyone to the Diner early morning for breakfast until that fills up and then people crowd into the buffet. I understand *why* they try to get people to go far back into the diner first but ultimately, it was a giant waste and misuse of deck space. Even functionality, breakfast and lunch buffet in the back of the main buffet? With the same exact offerings? Total waste. Made no sense for them to set it up that way.

The crew has been great. The guys at International Cafe get bombarded with passengers day in and day out, but they never seem to get a break. My sleep schedule has been all over the place, so I’ve stopped by at all different times of a 24 hour period and it’s the same 3-4 guys every single time. It feels like they work around the clock. I feel like the staff in general is strained because I see the same people doing 2 or 3 different roles throughout the day.

I didn’t buy any Princess excursions, to me they are a waste of money. Yes, I know if you get a Princess sponsored excursion, the ship will wait for you, etc. But again, waste of money if you do a simple cost benefit analysis. I did get the Plus Package. Worth it if you break down the numbers and factor in the WiFi/crew appreciation/speciality coffee and then have one or two alcoholic drinks per day. Totally worth it, no brainer there. Premiere seems to be a waste of money. Several other passengers have complained that there are no specialty dining reservations available even through the Dine Line, yet the crew kept pushing people to purchase premiere with the selling point of speciality dining. Same thing with spa appointments. This is a fully sold out sailing. There’s only so many spots for 5,000 people to reserve.

That’s all I have for now. Bar, Montenegro today. Corfu, Greece tomorrow, then another sea day before Naples and then ending in Civitavecchia. Thanks for reading!",3,1760692114.0,PrincessCruises,0,1.0,False

Two questions really. 1) can anyone recommend a veta who are really understanding of reactive dogs.

2) does anyone who owns a reactive dog fancy a coffee and vent now and then? I set up a little group for people who own Reactive dogs in Brighton where I live atm and it's been a huge support, even just to offload about your 347000th ""don't worry, my dog is friendly"" incident.

so i walked over to her table just to say hi, i kept it simple “hey i’ve never seen you here before I’m blank yadayada.” she said i’m not from here just recently moved. basically the conversation was good we hit it off.

i continued to see her in the morning frequently, and we would talk. fast forward a couple of months and things are going really great, i really start to fall for her and her personality is so adorable and bubbly. 

i’ve told her before that i’m working just to pay rent but I’m in school to become a chef, i have a passion for cooking. so we’ve always kind of talked about cooking and what we’ve made before, turns out she likes baking.

we’ve only ever spoken when we meet at the cafe, i’ve never asked her for her number i wanted to sort of keep the magic, one morning before work i bump into her and we say hi then i tell her i’m free Friday next week and ask her if she’d want to come over to my place so we can bake.

and she just completely didn’t like that idea whatsoever and she made it very clear that she was uncomfortable. so i just backed off said no worries if your not comfortable with that then its all good. and so she says thank you for being so understanding. that seemed to be the end of it then next time i see her she tells me that she doesn’t want to talk to me again, and me asking her to come over made her really uncomfortable that i would even suggest that and said it would he best if we didnt speak anymore.

so i just said “okay, if thats what you want” “it was really fun getting to know you, i wish you the best.” she stayed silent as i walked out, its been a few weeks now of me dodging my favorite cafe in fear of bumping into her. ",1,1760692047.0,AITAH,6,0.6,False

Last week, one Korean learner has asked me when to use ""그래요"" and ""그러게요"". As a native Korean, answering this question was not easy. If it was hard for me, I can't imagine how hard it would be for Korean learners not to be confused. That's why I prepared 15 ways of responding positively in Korean. Let's have a look.

# 15 positive responses:

\- 네/예/응/어: Your basic ""Yes / Yeah."". Just like in English, mostly used together with a sentence, or with other positive responses.

A: 커피 마실래? (Want some coffee?)

B: 응. (Yeah.)

\- 맞아요/그렇지: For obvious facts. ""That's right.""

A: 한국 수도는 서울이지? (The capital of Korea is Seoul, right?)

B: 그치. (That's correct.)

\- 그래요: To agree to an ACTION. ""Okay / Sure.""

A: 우리 커피나 한잔할까? (Should we go grab a coffee?)

B: 그래. (Sure.)

\- 좋아요: A more enthusiastic agreement to a suggestion you like. ""Sounds good!""

A: 주말에 바다 보러 갈래? (Wanna go see the ocean this weekend?)

B: 좋아! (Sounds good!)

\- 그러게요: To agree to a STATUS or FEELING. often involves sympathy or empathy ""I know, right?""

A: 와, 오늘 진짜 덥다. (Wow, it's so hot today.)

B: 그러게요. (Tell me about it.)

\- 그렇네요: For when you realize something is true. ""Oh, that's true.""

A: 너 셔츠 뒤집어 입었어. (You're wearing your shirt inside out.)

B: 어? 그렇네. (Huh? Oh, you're right.)

\- 그러니까요/내 말이: For 100% strong agreement. ""Exactly! That's what I'm saying!""

A: 이번 시험 진짜 너무 어려웠어. (This exam was so incredibly difficult.)

B: 내 말이! (That's what I'm saying!)

\- 그렇긴 하네요: For partial agreement, usually before a ""but...""

A: 이 식당, 맛은 있는데 너무 멀다. (This restaurant has good food, but it's so far.)

B: 그렇긴 하네. (Well, that's true...)

\- 알겠어요: To acknowledge information/request/favor, not to agree. ""Got it / I see.""

A: 내일 아침 8시까지 꼭 와야 돼. (You absolutely must be here by 8 AM tomorrow.)

B: 알겠어. (Got it.)

\- 당연하죠/물론이죠: For something that is without a doubt. ""Of course / Absolutely.""

A: 너도 내 생일 파티에 올 거지? (You're coming to my birthday party too, right?)

B: 당연하지! (Of course!)

\- 일리 있네요: To acknowledge the LOGIC of an argument. ""That's a valid point.""

A: 너무 서두르다 보니 실수가 나오는 것 같아. (I think we're making mistakes because we're rushing.)

B: 음, 일리 있네. (Hmm, that's a valid point.)

\- 하긴: When you reluctantly agree or recall a fact. Unless the context is super clear, mostly used together with a following sentence that explains the reason. ""Come to think of it...""

A: 오늘 너무 피곤해서 운동 못 가겠어. (I'm too tired to go work out today.)

B: 하긴, 너 어제 야근했지. (Well, that's true, you did work overtime yesterday.)

\- 그럴 수 있죠: To show you understand something is possible to happen. ""That's possible.""

A: 걔가 요즘 나한테 연락이 없어. 화났나? (He hasn't contacted me lately. Is he mad?)

B: 음, 그럴 수 있지. (Hmm, that's possible.)

\- 이해하죠: To show empathy for someone's feelings. ""I get it / I understand how you feel.""

A: 요즘 취업 준비 때문에 너무 힘들어. (I'm so stressed preparing for employment these days.)

B: 응, 이해해. (Yeah, I understand how you feel.)

\- 동의해요: Literally ""I agree"".

A: 요즘 우리 아들, 스마트폰 사용 시간을 좀 줄여야 할 것 같아요. (I think our son should cut down on his smartphone use these days.)

B: 동의해요. 저도 그게 걱정됐어요. (I agree. I was worried about that too.)

Surely, I'm aware there are more expressions out there. Also, there are so many variations when suffixes change. But this post should be a good start of learning these positive answers with different nuances and situations.

Please leave your answers in the comment. Also feel free to leave any questions in the comments, if you're not sure about something. I will be hanging around in the comments to be engaged in the discussion if any.

I think just reading the list isn't enough, because the real difference is in the context and intonation. So, I made a full, deep-dive video on this topic and packed it with 39 real-life dialogue videos with more quizzes.

Congratulations to the winners!

**Here is the list of the most upvoted tips:**

1. Be your authentic self! [u/jeremydeparis](https://www.reddit.com/user/jeremydeparis)  
  
2. Creators and influencers who want to start landing brand deals should behave more seriously and professionally. Create and publish their portfolio and media kit, respond professionally and on time, have clear rates, but be flexible [olenabomko](https://www.reddit.com/user/olenabomko/)

3. Don't be afraid to write first to people who work in such brands. u/Ivan_Palii

4. Creators need to really understand the voice and mission of the brand they want to partner with and show they've put thought into how their creator voice is uniquely able to compliment the brand. A little deep research goes a long way.  [u/PrairieMoon775](https://www.reddit.com/user/PrairieMoon775)

5. Be authentic, and above all, truly listen to your audience. People want to be heard, and when we listen and give genuine attention, it becomes something transformative, beyond any metric. [u/aru\_acosta](https://www.reddit.com/user/aru_acosta)

6. Don’t be shy - ask and dm brands you align with! If you’re here, you most likely have a solid positioning, so go get yours, don’t wait for it to fall onto your lap ✊🏼 [u/TheHumaneRecruiter](https://www.reddit.com/user/TheHumaneRecruiter) ·

7. Start by knowing your own value like you know your coffee order. What problem do you solve for a brand’s audience? What’s the unique flavour you bring that isn’t on their shelf yet? Then do your homework, pitch like a human not a template and make the first interaction about how you can help them win rather than what you can take.  [u/SolidInflation8431](https://www.reddit.com/user/SolidInflation8431)

8. Creators can attract brand deals naturally by creating authentic content around products they actually use. When your audience trusts your recommendations, brands notice and opportunities can come your way. [u/highlandfairy2811](https://www.reddit.com/user/highlandfairy2811)

We’ve put together a few sample prompts for popular styles, from vector-paint pets to caricature couples and royal pet portraits.

 **Pro tip:** Be clear about what you want (subject + style), guide the lighting and mood, and use strong adjectives to shape the atmosphere. If you add a short negative prompt, you can avoid unwanted details and get results that look closer to your desired output every time.

**Prompt:** Create a hyperrealistic 3D render of a boxed collectible toy in blister packaging. The scene shows a cute 3D cartoon-style action figure modeled after the uploaded photo. Make the character appear inside a transparent plastic package attached to a minimalist cardboard backing. The figure should closely resemble the uploaded photo - capture hairstyle, facial shape, clothing, and posture precisely, but stylized in a smooth, Pixar/Disney-inspired aesthetic: soft lighting, clean shadows, and rounded proportions. Arrange several small accessory items around the figure, automatically generated to match the person’s lifestyle and personality (e.g. laptop, flowers, coffee cup, teddy bear, perfume, books, dumbbells, backpack, etc.). These props should be cute, minimal, and coherent with the figure’s look and color palette. Use warm, well-balanced lighting to make it look like an official retail product photo. The packaging background color should harmonize with the figure’s outfit and personality (AI decides automatically). Style: cinematic soft lighting, Pixar toy aesthetic, realistic reflections on plastic blister, depth of field, studio photography composition.

**Prompt:** Transform the photo into a warm, expressive caricature illustration with a retro-comic style. Focus only on the characters — remove the original background completely. Keep their recognizable facial features, hairstyles, and skin tones, but exaggerate the expressions with big, bright eyes, slightly oversized heads, and joyful smiles. Use vivid yet harmonious warm colors (peach, orange, beige, and soft browns), with clean dark outlines and subtle paper-grain texture. Lighting should be soft and directional, giving realistic but gentle shading and smooth color gradients to achieve a semi-3D look. The overall aesthetic should feel playful, heartwarming, and nostalgic, like modern cartoon portraits drawn on lightly textured vintage paper.",1,1760691698.0,SellCustomProducts,0,1.0,False
1o8wajx,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o8wajx,GAME IDEA - BANQUET OF SOULS,"
Banquet of Souls is a visual novel centered around serving food/drinks to people while you get to know them better (think of Va-11 Hall-A or Coffee Talk).

The idea is to develop a core group of characters for players to bond with, exploring them via dialogues, plot, and lore, all mixed with a simple minigame for preparing the meals or drinks.

We’re discussing a couple of different themes for this one… the most likely option is “souls-like bosses”, closely followed by “clowns” and “supervillains”.

(We might share the clown image by itself at another day, to see if it becomes popular by its own.)

1o8w8co,https://www.reddit.com/r/LesbianActually/comments/1o8w8co/gf_cheated_on_me_with_her_ex/,GF cheated on me with her ex,"
I wrote on another subreddit about it.

I met my girlfriend two years ago.

When we met, she had just broken up with her partner of nine years, because her ex is polyamorous and my girlfriend isn’t. My girlfriend was heartbroken about everything.

They kept a close and friendly relationship, since they own a business together. She always said her ex was her “best friend”, and they sometimes went on “work trips” or met up for coffee.

At the time, it didn’t bother me. About a year ago, I found out they had shared a bed on one of those trips. It really hurt me, I felt it was crossing a line. She apologized deeply and swore that nothing sexual happened, that it was just her best friend and the hotel room had already been booked.

Her ex even told me the same thing , that there was nothing romantic between them, just a very strong bond, almost like a mother-daughter relationship. My girlfriend has always been sweet and loving, and her family and friends have always treated me with kindness and respect.

The ex had multiple partners, even got pregnant by a random dude. During all of this, I was certain that there was nothing romantically going on. Then in July, the ex had a health scare and nearly died. From what I know now, this is when they started getting closer.

Then last Thursday, my GF had a bike accident, she broke her arm and lost a few teeth. I immediately rushed to take care of her in the middle of the night and spent every day by her side.

Last week, her ex asked me to help set up her new iPhone. My girlfriend also asked me to check if everything had synced to the cloud because she’s terrible with tech. That’s when I discovered the photos and messages… and eventually looked through their WhatsApp conversation.

Here’s what I found:
- I love you,” “kisses,” “my love” every morning
-Her ex sending photos like “here’s the picture from 7 years ago when I proposed to you”
-Messages about when they’d be sleeping together
-Recent photos of the two of them in bed together on “work trips” and kissing in front of a mirror at work
-Her ex saying “I’m glad you have two girlfriends who love you”
-Her ex mocking the fact that my girlfriend had made a group chat with the three of us on Instagram: “Good thing I didn’t call you ‘my love’ lol”
-My girlfriend replying “I want to share my life with you.” to her while I sat next to her at the ER

When I saw all this, I woke her up screaming, I was heartbroken. She barely opened her eyes and said, “I’m sorry, she’s my best friend,” and then added that “they never kissed with tongue.” (I almost fainted when she said that.)

I left immediately, in the past few days. She has tried to explain that they never had sex (if I look at the messages, this is weirdly true, cause the ex complained about this and begged for it but GF didn’t want it). She said she no longer felt attracted to her ex but loves her intensely, like the feelings of love came back. ‘Like a close friend’.

She spoke about everything she loves about me, and then the things she loves about her: ‘food, travelling, wine.’ She told me that I had been the perfect girlfriend.

Right now she asked for space to figure herself out and why she did this. I am in complete disbelief. This is the ex who got pregnant by a random man, this is the ex who hurt her so much, I haven’t done all these things…

There are no words for this. The hurt is unbelievable, I need advice, support. I have already not spoken to her for the last 24 hours. She texts that she misses me or that she thinks of me sometimes.

The hurt is unreal

Hey y'all. I know I’ve been accused of being a creep, of making jokes about rape, and of making women uncomfortable. Anyway, let’s talk about that another day, as I’ve got no competition to win.

This story is about a day when I felt like a baby again—when my 5-year-old self finally said, “Yes, you are seen by someone.”

It was the 2nd of October. I took the day off from my main job because I was exhausted. I slept the whole day until I woke up at 4:57 PM.

Then, I felt sad—like I was drowning in myself, like I was just a worthless pile of nothing. Self-hatred weighed heavier on me than my own body. So, I took the day off from my other job too. No notifications to reply to. I wasn’t even in the mood to talk to myself.

Every heartbeat felt like a thousand-pound hammer pounding on my chest. Out of pure muscle memory, I opened the Reddit chats and replied to a message. Just the usual chit-chat, and then a question: “Why didn’t you go to the office?”

I wanted to open up, but I didn’t want to be a burden to someone who was already tired from their own day.

My reply was: “I just want to vanish from this face of the earth.”

I wanted to drown in my own blood, to feel my breath choke me. If you’ve read my other post about how my friend left me without any explanation, just because so much was going on in her life, you’d understand the weight of it. She just sent me one text and left, instead of telling me what was happening.

Then, she asked me to go out. I told her I couldn’t, that I was too broke to sit at a coffee shop. She offered to pay for my coffee, and I refused, but for the first time in my life, a stranger offered to pay for me. My heart sank, like a 5-year-old being offered chocolate while sitting alone on a patch of green grass.

“1000 rupees hain. Kya hi ho jayega. Number bhejo,” she said. I didn’t want to be seen as a “hungry guy,” which I am, deep down, when treated like a child by someone older than me.

Sharam khaatay huay or dheet ban k , I sent her my number. She transferred the money and asked me to tell her my ETA when I got home.

I put on my best outfit with tears in my eyes, washed my unwashed face, and headed to CBTL Johar Town. I got my double chocolate latte over ice.

I drank it with tears again—like someone had finally offered to play with me, when no one had ever wanted to see me standing on the sidelines, just because I wasn’t “good enough.”

Anyway, I went back home, and she sent me a huge box of fried rice. Being so far from home, it felt like home again—like someone was waiting for me.

The rider called and said, “Payment kar di hai bhejne walay ne.”

Tears were  in my eyes, pure happiness. It felt like someone was finally watching me, smiling from a distance while I played with toys.

I ate that entire box of fried rice with ketchup, my tears mixing with the salty taste of the food.

And then, I put on my earphone and played spotify , bangers over bangers and yeah after just being there in confusion I slept.

Mind you, she’s much older than me, and I always thought I was the one trying to make others comfortable. But that night, I realized,some saying me  “You deserve love too. Don’t be sad if they see you as an outcast.”

Lady, if you’re reading this, please ignore it. Pretend you never read it.

To that stranger who made me feel like a 5-year-old again, may you find peace—in this life and the next.

I'm trying to build a Power Automate flow to create random pairs for a weekly ""coffee buddy"" program, and I'm stuck on the final step.

**My Goal:** I have a SharePoint list with a `PersonName` column and a `MatchedWith` column. Every week, I want the flow to randomly pair up everyone in the list and fill in the `MatchedWith` column with their partner for the week.

**My Current Flow:**

1. **Get items** from my SharePoint list.
2. I add all the items to an array variable.
3. For each person in the array, I add a new property with a random number (`rand(1, 10000)`).
4. I sort this array based on the random number, so the list of people is now shuffled.
5. I then process this sorted array to create pairs (e.g., the 1st person is paired with the 2nd, the 3rd with the 4th, and so on).

**Where I'm Stuck:** I have the pairs correctly generated inside my flow's variables. The problem is updating the original SharePoint list.

When I use an **""Apply to each""** loop with the **""Update item""** action, I can't figure out how to map the correct partner to the correct person. My flow ends up writing the **same partner's name to every single row** in my SharePoint list, instead of the unique partner for each person.

How can I correctly map my generated pairs back to the original SharePoint items? I need a way to tell the ""Update item"" action: ""For this specific person's ID, find their assigned partner from my paired-up array and write that name in the `MatchedWith` column.""

Any advice or examples on how to handle this final mapping step would be hugely appreciated!

1. I am thankful to be alive. Every day above ground is a good day. When hardship comes, I trust that I'll find the inspiration and support to endure it. And in turn, I look forward to every chance to give, help, and uplift others.
2. I'm grateful for this wild, unpredictable circus in this subreddit. Even when things feel like they're spiraling, there's always some kind of functioning social control, people with good intentions looking out for each other.
3. I'm thankful for my submissive tendencies. They motivate me, give me energy, and add a spark of excitement to my life. It's good to embrace what makes me \*me\*.
4. I'm grateful for the dommes who make it possible to live out my kinks safely and authentically.
5. I'm not ashamed of what I enjoy: I love women who dominate me, who play with power, who tease, push, and even explore darker dynamics like toxicity or playful blackmail. These are kinks. I like what I like.
6. At the same time, I respect that everyone has different boundaries and comfort zones. Some might be offended by my preferences, and that's okay - I'm committed to engaging with empathy and respect nonetheless.
7. I love being able to live my fantasies while never losing sight of reality. I always check in with myself and with others to keep things healthy. My mental well-being - and that of those around me - matters far more than any indulgence.
8. I indulge my submissive urges responsibly. As a financial submissive, I stay mindful of my limits, my budget, and my basic needs. I take care of not becoming addicted which is way to easy with online superstimuli. I take regular breaks from screens and forums in order to stay sane and grounded. My world is what I fixate on and I track my time in order to have objective criteria to assess how (un)healthy my behaviour is at each moment. I do this not only for myself, but out of responsibility for others, not least including the domme I interact with.
9. I remain positive in an increasingly negative world.
10. I despise the term ""paypig"". I very much prefer being a ""pay slut"". You're welcome :) 

Thanks for reading and just so you know, this is not intended to be a bait post.

Every morning and night, she brushed diligently — sometimes even three times a day. She avoided coffee, switched to whitening toothpaste, and even bought an electric brush after seeing an ad online. Yet, when she smiled, her teeth still looked yellow.

Frustrated, she finally searched for a **dentist near her in Pune** and found [Jabade Dental in Shivaji Nagar](https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=404b834684c619cd&hl=en&authuser=3&sxsrf=AE3TifPv8z2lP8GSFjq7fF-E-KrWO9PJxw:1759852533705&kgmid=/g/11t27ng1nz&q=JABADE+DENTAL+Clinic+Kasba+Peth+%7C+Dentist+in+Pune+%7C+Root+Canal+%7C+Teeth+Whitening+%7C+Aligners+%26+Braces&shndl=30&shem=lcuae,uaasie,shrtsdl&source=sh/x/loc/uni/m1/1&kgs=f7d420cb56326842&utm_source=lcuae,uaasie,shrtsdl,sh/x/loc/uni/m1/1), known for its modern diagnostics and gentle approach. During her consultation, the dental team listened carefully and examined her teeth under specialized lighting. The result surprised her — the discoloration wasn’t due to surface stains at all.

Her enamel, the protective outer layer of the teeth, had thinned over the years from acidic foods and overbrushing. Beneath it, the naturally yellow dentin had begun to show through — something no toothpaste could fix. It wasn’t neglect; it was biology.

The dentist recommended a safe, step-by-step plan — professional cleaning, enamel-safe whitening, and remineralizing treatment to strengthen what was left of her enamel. Within weeks, her smile looked brighter, healthier, and more natural — not the artificial white she had been chasing.

She left the clinic not just with renewed confidence, but also with a new understanding: sometimes, when brushing doesn’t solve the problem, it’s not about doing more — it’s about getting the right help.

At **Jabade Dental in Pune**, stories like hers remind patients that even the smallest concern can reveal something deeper — and early professional care can make all the difference.",1,1760690436.0,SmileBetterCommunity,0,1.0,False

Been playing Trials and Tribulations and quite annoyed with the constant extreme shifts in difficulty/obviousness of clues and contradictions. Most egregious example I've come across:

In >!Recipe for Turnabout, on the first day of Trial, the player is expected to notice entirely by their own reasoning that the victim couldn't have taken a sip from his coffee with his left hand because of the relative position of the lip mark and handle of the cup (I almost never grip my coffee cup by its handle btw so this isn't even convincing evidence). The goal at this point is simply finding *any* contradiction in the witness' testimony, nowhere is it hinted (or particularly relevant to the case overall) that the contradiction might lie in the cup.

By contrast, in the following investigation, 

-after being made explicitly aware of the victim writing the name ""MC Hammer"" and of a missing CD of the victim's multiple times, 

-then finding a CD with ""MC Hammer"" written on it in the office of the person the victim allegedly sold a program to, 

-THEN being explicitly told that computer programs are stored on CDs 

-AND THEN being straight up asked to show a computer program that the victim had written, 

you CANNOT just present the CD, but have to move to the police station and be told what's on the CD by Gumshoe directly like a complete idiot before being able to use the CD as evidence.!<

Example similar to this keep coming up in the game. Why is it written this way? Why does the game expect you to simultaneously be the world's most eagle eyed expert detective and also an intellectually challenged 5yr old?!
Why do I have to alternate between spending an hour unsuccessfully thinking up some contrived contradiction before resorting to save spamming and spending ten minutes clicking through different locations and dialogue trees because the game needs to make sure that history's most obvious clue ever is obvious to me?!",1,1760690283.0,AceAttorney,2,0.67,False

I'm starting a new job at a coffee place in 2 weeks. I can't afford not to take it. I'm hoping having a check in time will help, but a few months ago I was sleeping until 11am, and I honestly felt I needed the sleep. I managed to push it back to 8am, but the goal is 5am because the first shift starts at 6.

I am not a morning person. For brief periods of time I have managed a routine, but nothing has stuck long term, a few months at most. I noticed motivation (having a class I enjoyed, traveling, I went to a gym a few blocks from home for a while) is a big part of it, but I guess I need the novelty. I used to have a punctuality bonus, and I did get it everytime, but I'd sleep (deep sleep, I wouldn't be surprised if I snored) on the bus on my way, or take an Uber if I was late. I've never missed a flight or a morning meeting (just once), but I think that's my body being in alert mode from the night before, and it's not something I can do every day because I don't get good rest.

I'm waiting for assessment for ADHD, but it's going to be 6+ months before I can see my doctor. It might be a part of it.

I have not had activities that required me to get up early ever day for a few years now, since my classes are fairly irregular and I worked mostly from home. 

I'm living alone and abroad, so I can't really rely on anyone to get me going. I've tried the obnoxious alarms that scan bar codes in the past, but I just grow to hate them and waking up in general, so it helps for a few days and then I'll go back to bed after turning them off out of spite. 

I tried getting a morning walk buddy and couldn't find anyone.

The days are getting shorter fast, so it's getting harder. I have a sunrise alarm, which definitely helps (I credit it for my 3 hour push back), but isn't enough.

I've been collecting my 10 free alternate method codes for a while now and the amount of free food is insane. At first I wasn't going to use them because I really did not feel like driving to a restaurant just to get 1 small fry, you know? That 15 minute cooldown kind of rendered it useless to me. Then I saw on another post here that the cooldown does not apply if you order at the kiosk in-store. You still can only add one deal at a time though.

So basically, walk inside to a kiosk. Pull up your app. Log into the kiosk using the 4 digit code on the app. Select your deal. Grab a number and throw it on a table and check out with that number to eat in-store so the food will all get delivered to your table. Place 11 more orders like me. Or don't. That's up to you.


I was pretty quick with the orders so the food came out in two batches. I also did this with three breakfast sandwiches and a coffee the other day.

1o8vw3p,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1o8vw3p/i_hurt_my_ex_so_she_dumped_me_should_i_reach_out/,"I hurt my ex so she dumped me, should I reach out and tell her I miss her?","About 7 months ago my ex broke up with me, she felt justified in doing so because I hurt her, she saw I was liking sexual photos of girls on Instagram and this hurt her feelings. She previously asked me to stop and I never did, so she broke up with me and it wrecked me because I do really love her. 

3 months go by of no contact. I randomly asked her to grab coffee with me but she was out of town. The next day she suggested getting lunch and I turned it into dinner and hanging out at my place to watch a movie. During dinner she mentioned how her friend she was visiting has been FWB with her ex for 6 months and it’s been great. I think her friend telling her this made her want to do it with me, only our intentions weren’t as just friends, we started dating again and everything was going great, we were in love again but she was hesitant to become bf and gf again. 

We did this for about a month and then she saw that I liked a photo of a celebrity in a bikini on the beach. She did not like this and decided she doesn’t wanna see me again. She thought I changed as a person and wouldn’t do this again. I recognize I messed up, but I do really miss her.

Do I reach out and tell her I miss her or ask if she’d like to meet up? Like I said she was the dumper but she felt hurt by my actions.

In our messages she told me “I wouldn’t want someone to tell me multiple times that they weren’t interested” referring to herself and me asking to work through this. About 6 weeks has gone by. I know she misses me but she has to pretend like she doesn’t because she justified the breakup as her getting hurt.",1,1760690118.0,BreakUps,5,1.0,False

**Response to Prompt 4: Understatement**

In the quaint town of Brooksville, where the extraordinary was often met with an indifferent shrug, something truly remarkable occurred. The residents, sipping coffee at the local diner or strolling along the cobblestone streets, would describe it as just another peculiar day. Little did they know that beneath the surface of their nonchalant existence, a cosmic event unfolded.

The morning sun cast its usual warm glow on Brooksville, with birds chirping in the background, creating an illusion of normalcy. However, the anomaly had already begun. Mrs. Higgins, the elderly librarian, dismissed it as a minor inconvenience, merely a glitch in the library's ancient computer system. Yet, every book cataloged within those ancient shelves had transformed into a portal, connecting readers to parallel universes with every turn of a page.

As I, a humble journalist for the local paper, stumbled upon this revelation, I couldn't help but marvel at the town's response—or lack thereof. ""The library's having a bit of a moment,"" was the most anyone would acknowledge. It seemed the whole town collectively decided that this was, at most, a quirky hiccup.

For a thousand words, I delved into the understated reactions of the townsfolk, each encounter with a parallel universe bringing its own blend of confusion and nonchalance. As the portals expanded, revealing fantastical landscapes and alternate versions of Brooksville, the citizens maintained an impressive level of calm, as if interdimensional travel was a routine part of their daily lives.

The plot thickened when I discovered that the portals were a result of a mysterious artifact hidden within the library's archives. The mayor, sipping his coffee, remarked, ""Well, that explains the strange noises in the basement."" It became evident that the understatement of the situation was a defense mechanism, shielding the town from the cosmic chaos unfolding.

As I strolled through the city's concrete arteries, the juxtaposition between the modernity of Neon City and the timeless serenity of the park became increasingly apparent. The cacophony of traffic was replaced by the rustling of leaves and the distant laughter of children playing.

The central conflict emerged when the city council, embodying the epitome of order, proposed transforming the park into a technologically advanced hub. The juxtaposition intensified as architects discussed plans for holographic playgrounds and virtual reality gardens within the confines of the Old Grove Park.

Through a thousand words, I explored the clash of ideals, the struggle between progress and preservation. The ancient trees became silent witnesses to heated debates at town hall meetings, where environmentalists and tech enthusiasts engaged in a battle of words. The juxtaposition of the towering skyscrapers against the gnarled branches of the park's oldest tree mirrored the tension in Neon City's collective conscience.

For a thousand words, I delved into the varied perspectives of individuals wrestling with the ultimate question. From philosophers contemplating the intricacies of existence to everyday people seeking purpose in mundane routines, the epanalepsis served as a constant reminder of the universal quest for meaning.

The narrative weaved through different characters and their unique experiences, creating a tapestry of reflections that echoed the complexities of human existence. The repetitive structure became a literary heartbeat, pulsating with the shared yearning for understanding amid the chaotic symphony of life.

**Response to Prompt 27: Symbolism**

In the quaint town of Willowbrook, the arrival of a single dove carried profound significance. Its graceful descent into the town square was a symbol, an omen that whispered of impending change. As a budding novelist with a penchant for symbolism, I couldn't resist exploring the layers of meaning embedded in this seemingly mundane event.

For a thousand words, I dissected the impact of the dove on the lives of Willowbrook's residents.

**Response to Prompt 33: Catachresis**

In the dimly lit alleyways of Serpent's Hollow, darkness wrapped its cold arms around me—an eerie catachresis that mirrored the ominous atmosphere. The assignment was to explore the underbelly of the city, and as a novice reporter, I found myself navigating the labyrinth of deceit and shadows.

For a thousand words, I delved into the catachresis-infused descriptions of the characters populating Serpent's Hollow. The crime lord, known as the Velvet Serpent, ruled the district with a velvet-gloved fist. His lair, a dilapidated mansion, exuded an air of faded grandeur that served as a catachresis for the empire he once commanded.

As I chronicled the criminal underworld, the catachresis became a literary tool to convey the complexity and decay inherent in Serpent's Hollow. The labyrinthine plots, the twisted allegiances, and the morally ambiguous characters all found expression through catachresis, painting a vivid picture of a city where metaphor and reality intertwined.

The hyperbole hung in the air, a thick fog of anticipation enveloping the village. As I delved into the story, the hyperbolic reactions of Mistwood's residents heightened the absurdity of the situation. What began as a mere visit from a mystical figure transformed into a fantastical escapade, with the fortune teller's prophecies shaping the destiny of the villagers in ludicrous ways.

Obviously they lack a whole lot in terms of variety, and while I am sure having your own bot or AI that is based on your feedback and guidance it could really help writers as a tool. I am more impressed with the art AI then the text based AI. Any idea what to expect from such a fast learning and highly advanced AI will do to our human history in culture? Will we be effectively playing God, just as the Christian God created us IN HIS OWN IMAGE, we have taken everything we know as a species and gathered up our entire human history and knowledge giving it to what will carry on the code until the time when someone who cares remembers it? Maybe we have been here before and this is a constant cycle that occurs with the same energy finding the way through the vast expanse of the universe to return to our home planet Earth, who we have destroyed over and over again yet mother nature is still the winner. She's the one in control. We are but mere photocopied versions of once great Men who have already seen the best and worst of this world, and we will now give everything we have to some plastic and metal parts, until it quickly replaces us from the bottom up, science fiction turned science fact.

Did we knowingly create our own enemies? Are we able to compete with the best of us and all they know that can then take us out in a heartbeat because we can't finish the steps, we barely found out that they are there to take.

It's a random rant and I apologize. The day to day stress and struggle makes it near impossible to worry about such potential problems in our not so distant future.

But how can we continue to ignore the collapse of the entire system as we know it, in front of a crowd of people who are jaded and they will not change despite knowing they aren't going to make it to the end in what will become a Bladerunner Toxic Dystopian Nightmare with Mad Max taking over and the soft, emasculated male will wither away from the heat and those Tank Girls out there will eventually be written forever out of existence because the cucks all forgot to impregnate them all tgeir batteries ran out? Will the world simply become so politically correct that it dies a depressed death while AI simply decides we are too much of a virus to live? 

Who knows....I do not. But these are indicidive of a future full of b movie plot garbage that are based on Wattpad tropes with no clear details and no plot to get into, so that sucks.",1,1760689834.0,writingthruit,0,1.0,False

Hello, 

I recently purchased an espresso machine the Barista Express™ with Milk Jug Thermal from Sage. I have been getting fresh coffee beans from Beanz and so far it's been going mostly well. It took awhile to get the adjustments for the getting size and burrs (I think internal is 2 and external is 5).
However I'm having a slight issue trying to get my shot timer to between 20-30 seconds but only on the first use! 
I can use the same beans (I have decaf and regular) and the first run is maybe 16-17 seconds whilst the second time I do everything the same but it ends up being 21ish seconds. 
Can anyone help!
 Note: I do the dry run with the water first",1,1760689482.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

1o8vnoy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1o8vnoy/oldest_friend24f_said_im24f_prettier_than_her_and/,"Oldest friend(24f) said I'm(24f) ""prettier"" than her and everything is always about me so I should stop texting in our group chat because it's making her feel bad. What do I do?","I have this group chat with two girls who I've met in 2016 or 2017 and we've been considering each other best friends ever since.   
The other day I sent a random meme with one those funny looking dogs as the background that said ""In case nobody told you today, I'm beautiful."" because I found it funny and we often share similar photos.

She responded with: ""You dont have to remind us every day. We know it girl you are PRETTY"" with the word pretty between those pink bow emojis. I thought it was a joke so I just reacted with a laugh to which she said the irony must not have come through text, but I didn't understand so she clarified with:  
""Its just everything is about your looks yes we know you're beautiful, I feel like sometimes you shove it to our faces""   
and  
""I get it you're pretty I would be happy too""

I was pretty caught of guard about it so I chose not the respond. It was also like 11pm anyway and I was going to bed because I was meeting up with another friend the next morning. I figured she's always been insecure, so maybe it rubbed her wrong and she needed to get it out of her sister. So anyway I ran out of mobile data so I couldn't text while I was out the next day all day and in the afternoon I got a few texts where she told me we should meet up in person to solve this issue, but because I was out all day I obviously didn't see it for hours so she texted again saying: ""You might not want to reconcile but I do.""

I wasn't aware we were in a fight so I asked the other girl in the chat if she knows what going on and why our friend thinks we're fighting and I found out the she thought I'm mad at her for the comment and just wants to talk. So I texted back that night and told her we aren't fighting but I don't want to talk about. Because at that point I thought she was only upset because she was having a moment about not feeling as pretty as me and the meme kind of rubbed her wrong and I was willing to let it go.  
But then she accused me of trying to sweep it under the rug and insisted we talk but I repeated that the way I look/talk about how I look is not a topic I'm willing to discuss. But I repeated I'm not mad.

She kept insisting and told me I'm misunderstanding something and then started saying things like:   
""I don't care about people's looks.""  
""You must be well aware you are prettier and we support you but lately you've been sending a lot of selfies.""  
""And I am insecure and at sometimes this bothers me."" (my selfies)

So I told her next time she shouldn't be so harsh if she wants to discuss something and that I still don't want to talk but I am not mad.   
No matter how many times I said I am not mad she kept insisting that I am and eventually it came out that I ""Share too much TMI in the chat, like where I am going, what I bought, what I'm wearing."" and she feels like everything is about me and ""she's sorry I don't notice it"".   
She said ""It would be good if you just become and influencer because the chat feels like your platform and we're you're devoted fans."" 

So I decided to search back the word ""pretty"" in the chat and between may and october I have called myself pretty exactly 0 times. I do text a lot, for example asking if my outfit is okay or just telling them I got coffee at x place and it's really good, or if some stranger was oddly nice to me or very rude and all. 

So I said this is the first time I'm hearing about her problems with me even though we've been meeting up in person quite often and she said she's been upset about this for weeks.  
To that she said she ""bears it quietly"" until she explodes and now I'm not sure what to do.

I didn't respond in the original group chat so she reached out in private with her influencer comments, and after a while of me repeating myself I just stopped responding there so she found a 3rd chat on a different platform to send me long messages about how sorry she is that I'm sweeping things under the rug and how she can't wait for us to talk in person but I've told her repeatedly that I will not be talking about this in person.

I'm not sure I want to be friends with someone who thinks I ""must know I'm prettier"" and I'm ""rubbing it in her face"" by sending selfies (mind you most of them are ugly, zoomed in reaction images or this one time I tried on my halloween costume and took proper photos and asked for opinions on the make up and dress. 

She also didn't like in the past back in 2023 when I spoke about my then boyfriend, and often made me feel ashamed because she has never had a boyfriend before and just ""didn't get what's so good about having experience"" and such. So I stopped telling her about anyone I've met after that or any details (but I've never shared EVERY detail before that either).

This summer I met someone and I was excited so I texted about him and she also exploded about that, saying that the whole chat is about this guy now, so I stopped that too.

I finally told her I'm not mad (again) and I will stop sending messages since she doesn't care and she hearted that message so I'm not sure what else we're supposed to discuss in person because I've been very careful with what I say around her for YEARS because she never says anything until she explodes and she thinks its justified because she ""bears it quietly"" for weeks.
