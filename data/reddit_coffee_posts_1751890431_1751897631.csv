Okay, Reddit fam, I gotta share something that's seriously upped my style game lately: this blue quilted shoulder bag I snagged a few weeks ago. I've been on a quest for a women's bag that's both cute and actually useful, and I think I've finally found ""the one."" ü§©

A little about me: I'm in my early 40s, working in a creative field where I need to look put-together, but also want to show off my personality. My bag requirements are pretty specific: it needs to hold my phone, wallet, keys, a small planner, and maybe a snack or two (priorities, right?) without feeling like I'm lugging around a brick. And, it needs to look chic, whether I'm heading to a client meeting or grabbing coffee with friends.

I swear, I've gone through so many women's bags over the years, and it's always the same problem. Either they're gorgeous but fall apart after a month, or they're super practical but look like something my grandma would carry (no offense, Grandma!).

So, what makes this elegant blue quilted handbag different? Let me tell you:

First, the style. The quilted pattern is classic and timeless, and the blue color is just stunning. It's not a loud, in-your-face blue; it's more of a sophisticated, muted blue that honestly goes with everything. I've worn it with jeans and a sweater, a dress, and even a blazer, and it always looks amazing. I feel so much more confident when I wear it. It elevates my whole look without being too extra. ‚ú®

But it's not just a pretty face; this shoulder bag is surprisingly practical. The inside is roomy enough for all my essentials and then some. Plus, it has a secure zipper closure, which is a must for me. I hate the worry of my stuff falling out or, worse, getting stolen. The shoulder strap is also the perfect length ‚Äì not too long, not too short ‚Äì so it sits comfortably on my shoulder, leaving my hands free to hold my coffee (essential!).

One of the things that really sold me on this bag was the durable construction. I'm so done with buying cheap bags that fall apart after a few months. This one feels really well-made, and I'm confident it will last for years. That's a financial win right there ‚Äì no more constant replacements! Plus, it saves me time and stress from having to search for a new bag every few months.

I also love how versatile it is. I can use it for everyday errands, special occasions, or even travel. It's the perfect size for carrying on a plane, and it doesn't take up too much space in my suitcase. It really is the perfect blend of style and function for the modern woman. It solves that daily frustration of trying to find a bag that‚Äôs both fashionable and practical. If you're on the hunt for the best elegant shoulder bag for women, this might be it.

I stumbled across this bag while browsing on ursupermart.com, and I was immediately drawn to its elegant design. I did a little digging before buying it, and I was impressed by the positive customer reviews. People raved about its style, quality, and versatility. If you are looking to buy blue quilted handbag online, this is a great option.

If you're on the hunt for a stylish women's handbag that's also practical and well-made, I highly recommend giving this one a look. It's definitely worth the investment. It‚Äôs one of the best shoulder bags out there for the price. If you are looking for a stylish women's bag, this is the perfect blend of style and function for the modern woman.

If you're curious, here‚Äôs where I got it: [https://go.ursupermart.com/KEHAbw](https://go.ursupermart.com/KEHAbw)

Hope this helps anyone else on the hunt for the perfect bag! üòä I'm telling you, having a bag that makes me feel confident and organized has been a total game-changer. It's a small thing, but it makes a big difference in my daily life. And hey, if you're looking for an affordable designer inspired quilted handbag, this one definitely fits the bill.

 A little bit hard for me to find machines so broadly, so I was looking for recommendations on machines that may be retail for 500 or 600 such that I can find them used for maybe 300 or however much.

1ltv0by,https://www.reddit.com/r/OrthodoxChristianity/comments/1ltv0by/visited_my_first_liturgy_it_was_amazing/,Visited my first liturgy... it was amazing,"I've been in this sub for a while and I've seen a lot of negative posts about people struggling or having awkward interactions at their church (not saying that's bad, some of those people genuinely needed guidance and this sub can help). So I figured I'd write something positive. 

Yesterday I went to my local church for the first time and everything went perfectly. The people were smiling when I got there and were happy to guide me to the chapel (my church is a huge Antiochian church and has 400-500 people who actively attend so there were a few buildings). 

Once I got in there I found a nice spot to sit and I just observed. I can honestly say I felt a feeling of peace in there that I'd never experienced before. It was like everything from the outside world just melted away and the worship was all that mattered to me. And I have to say real quick that the choir was incredible, I had heard from local people of other religions that the choir was great but I was not expecting that. They had a liturgy book by all the benches, so I followed along which helped me a lot to understand what was happening. 

All in all, I really wasn't expecting the liturgical practices to be so beautiful and you could really feel a divine presence in there. I'm not one of the people who only wants to join Orthodoxy because of the internet, it's my own choice because of things I read, heard from others, and now experienced. But I have come across the ""orthobro"" internet creators on social media. And I have to say if there's one thing I learned it was that Orthodoxy is not flashing pictures of icons with phonk music, but real Orthodoxy is infinitely more beautiful and sacred, and it is the one true church.

I didn't have time to stay for coffee hour this week but I will most certainly be back, I have a strong desire to learn more about the faith and hopefully be baptized someday. Thanks for reading, I just wanted to share my good experience in hopes that it can encourage another inquirer to take the next step and go to their local church. It completely changed my perspective and I will be coming back every week.",1,1751897024.0,OrthodoxChristianity,0,1.0,False

So I‚Äôm currently 26w pregnant with my rainbow, after 3 losses and 2 years of infertility. During infertility, I had support from friends and our friendships continued as normal, hanging out, texting, FT, etc. now that I‚Äôve become pregnant, and stayed pregnant this time around its like I do not exist to them. I‚Äôve reached out to plan things like girls night/movie night, or coffee dates and no replies, checked in on them-no replies. I wished one a happy birthday and got a thank you message back but that was it. All my other messages have been ignored for months/weeks. 

The only one that had been communicating still for a bit, is currently just in school, not working but its part-time school and I see her going out and posting on socials but she ignores my texts when I message her. Then only sends reactions to them weeks later like the heart emoji, thumbs up, exclamation point but then spills so much drama about things and expects me to reply like she didn‚Äôt just ignore my other texts lol.

One them is a mom, she has a 7m old, the other is trying for a baby, we both went through losses and infertility together, even when our other friend got pregnant while we were in the thick of it we still were there for her and supported her during pregnancy/postpartum. I can understand how she must be feeling not being pregnant and seeing other friends being pregnant/becoming moms I understand why she is being distant, but she still showed up for our other friend so it kinda hurts.

Pros

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

-The people I‚Äôve met‚Äî I met the love of my life here (although, he is also a transplant from New York), some best friends, and people I trust enough to co-found companies together.

- The ability to be out and proud! I‚Äôve never been so comfortable being out as a trans queer person as I have been in downtown Madison. It seem like every third person is out and there are signs and symbols everywhere that makes me feel not only right at home, but celebrated for just being myself as well!

- Living downtown is so great. Everything (and I mean EVERYTHING) is within walking distance.

- Farmers markets‚Äî if you are able to wake up early enough to arrive before 10am, that is.

- The state Capitol building is incredible. The free tours are a blast! I did the free tour four times and learned something new each time.

- The food quality is incredible. The fresh veggie selection is the best I‚Äôve ever seen. Fruits are fine, but you really want to go for the veggies IMO.

Cons

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

- October

- November 

- December 

- January 

- February 

- March

- April

- Do you like seven months of winter? Without snow? Only the cold and frozen horribleness? Well then you‚Äôre in the right place!

- The water quality absolutely blows. Get ready for the hardest water you‚Äôve ever seen in your life. Oh, you live in a building that provides on-site water treatment? Or maybe you‚Äôre treating your own water? Too bad! This water is guaranteed to give you acne and ruin all your small appliances that use water. Pro tip: don‚Äôt count on your coffee maker lasting for more than a year.

- The water quality. That‚Äôs right, I said it again. It will give you skin problems you never knew you had. Just moved here? Get ready for newfound acne problems! 

- 7 months of winter.

- The food prices. $3 for a McDonalds hash brown!? Insane. I hope you‚Äôre rich enough to have enough time to cook for yourself, otherwise be prepared to pay out the nose for premade food.

- 7 months of dark, cold, dry winter.

- Rent prices. Be prepared to pay $1700 per month for a 2-square foot studio apartment!

- 7 months of the sun setting at 4:30pm.

- It‚Äôs extremely segregated. Downtown is super white, along with large places in the west side. My POC friends have often said that they‚Äôve struggled to feel accepted in Madison. So, heads up to anyone who isn‚Äôt white.

- 7 months of winter.

- People love to try to convince you that winter is actually fun if you‚Äôre willing to try to get into it. Ya, go ahead and try to have fun wearing 15 pounds of jackets. You‚Äôll have a blast being super sweaty on the inside while your face is freezing and you can barely move! It‚Äôs great! Wonder sports include scooting around flat surfaces on skis (cross country skiing), sticking a string down a hole in the ice (ice fishing), and some other really weirdly invented activities (ice kiting, and ???). If you‚Äôre lucky, you might have a rich friend who has snow mobiles and gets drunk enough to try to sink old, broken-down cars through thin ice. That‚Äôs probably the most fun you‚Äôll have in the winter.

- Weed isn‚Äôt even legal here, so unless you‚Äôre willing to buy pot in IL and drive it back to your apartment in Madison, you‚Äôll have to play Russian roulette with some TCH derivative and pray to god it will just get you high and not give you some other weird side effect like heart palpitations and panic attacks. Lmao good luck with that.

Collagen peptides are **broken-down, easily absorbed forms of collagen** that support **skin, joints, gut, hair, and nails**. While they do not directly cause weight loss, they can support your body during your *weight loss medication journey*.

# Why Collagen Matters While on Weight Loss Medication

‚úÖ **Supports Skin Elasticity:** Rapid weight loss can affect skin tightness. Collagen provides the building blocks your skin needs to repair and maintain elasticity.

‚úÖ **Joint Support:** As you become more active on your weight loss journey, collagen can support joint comfort.

‚úÖ **Gut Health:** Collagen contains amino acids like glycine and proline, which may help support gut lining health, beneficial if appetite changes affect your digestion.

‚úÖ **Hair & Nail Strength:** Weight loss and reduced intake can sometimes affect hair and nails. Collagen peptides can help maintain strength and growth.

‚úÖ **Protein Top-Up:** While not a complete protein, collagen adds to your daily intake, helpful if your appetite is lower.

# How to Use Collagen Peptides

* Mix 10g‚Äì20g daily into **coffee, tea, yoghurt, water, smoothies, or overnight oats**.
* Choose **unflavoured** for flexibility or flavoured if it helps consistency.
* Take consistently for at least **8‚Äì12 weeks** for potential skin and joint benefits.

# What to Look For in a Collagen Peptide Supplement

‚úîÔ∏è Hydrolysed (for easy absorption)  
‚úîÔ∏è Sourced from grass-fed bovine or marine collagen  
‚úîÔ∏è No added sugars or fillers  
‚úîÔ∏è From reputable suppliers with batch testing

Let‚Äôs be honest. Have you ever looked at your bedroom and thought, ‚ÄúSomething feels off?‚Äù I have. Maybe it feels a bit too *blah* or lacks character. That‚Äôs where **orange bedroom accessories** come in. üéâ

I know what you‚Äôre thinking‚Äî**orange?** In a bedroom? Isn‚Äôt that too bold? But hear me out. When done right, orange can make a dull room feel warm and lively. 

We‚Äôre not painting the walls bright orange (unless that‚Äôs your style‚Äîthen go for it). I mean **subtle, stylish accents** that bring life to your space.

So grab your coffee (or wine; I won‚Äôt judge), and let‚Äôs explore how orange accessories can refresh your room without feeling like a Halloween party gone wrong.

# Why Orange? Seriously‚ÄîWhy Not?

Let‚Äôs start with the elephant in the room: **why choose orange in the first place?**

Well, for starters...

* **Orange is warm, cozy, and inviting.** It gives off major ‚Äúsunset in a bottle‚Äù vibes.
* It pairs surprisingly well with a bunch of other colors‚Äî**gray, navy, white, teal, even pink.**
* It‚Äôs perfect for adding energy to a space *without* making it feel chaotic (if you use it right, of course).

**Ever walked into a room and immediately felt more awake?** Yep. That‚Äôs the magic of orange. It stimulates creativity and joy, and IMO, that‚Äôs exactly the kind of energy you want when your alarm‚Äôs dragging you out of bed.

# The MVPs of Orange Bedroom Accessories

Alright, let‚Äôs get to the good stuff. You don‚Äôt need to go full Home Makeover Mode to make a difference. These orange accessories pack a serious punch with *minimal effort*.

# Orange Throw Pillows: The Gateway Drug to Color

If you‚Äôre color-shy, start small. Orange throw pillows are like the trial size version of bold design. You get the effect without the commitment.

* Mix solid orange pillows with patterned ones (stripes, tribal, or even florals).
* Use different **textures** like velvet, faux fur, or chunky knits for extra flair.
* Combine with neutrals (think beige, white, or gray) to keep the look grounded.

**Pro tip:** Don‚Äôt just toss a couple of orange pillows on the bed and call it a day. Layer them with other tones like burnt sienna, mustard, or rust to build dimension.

# Orange Bedding: Instant Glow-Up

Wanna make your bed the star of the room? Of course you do.

An orange duvet or quilt can create that ‚Äúhotel bed, but better‚Äù look. Go for:

* **Muted shades like terracotta or rust** for a more calming, earthy vibe.
* **Bright tangerine or coral** if you‚Äôre feeling bold (or just had too much caffeine).

And FYI‚Äî**white sheets underneath keep things crisp and balanced.** Too much orange can turn your sleep space into a pumpkin patch real fast. Don‚Äôt do that to yourself.

# Rugs That Ground (and Glow)

A rug does more than keep your toes warm. It pulls the whole room together‚Äîespecially if it‚Äôs got a pop of orange.

* Moroccan or boho-style rugs with **orange accents** add a global touch.
* Go full retro with a **burnt orange shag rug** (cue disco music üé∂).
* Keep it classy with a neutral base and subtle orange patterns woven in.

The trick is to **choose a rug that complements your furniture**, not competes with it. Unless chaos is your aesthetic, in which case... carry on.

# Wall Art That Pops (But Doesn‚Äôt Scream)

Orange in artwork is like hot sauce: a little goes a long way.

* Abstract prints with **pops of orange and navy**? Yes, please.
* Framed **sunset photography or desert landscapes**? Instant zen.
* Vintage posters with orange tones? Ugh, so good.

Hang one large piece above your bed or do a mini gallery wall. Either way, **make sure the orange isn‚Äôt fighting with the rest of your decor**. Nobody likes an attention hog, even if it‚Äôs a beautiful one.

# Curtains: The Bold Move

Alright, this one‚Äôs a bit daring. But hear me out‚Äî**orange curtains can totally work** when done right.

Look for:

* **Light, sheer panels** in peach or coral for a breezy look.
* **Heavier drapes** in burnt orange for drama and warmth.
* Patterns with a splash of orange, especially if you‚Äôre a commitment-phobe.

Not gonna lie‚Äîorange curtains are kind of a power move. But they *can* pull the room together like a pro stylist just waved their wand.

# Lighting: Mood Matters

You probably don‚Äôt think of ‚Äúorange‚Äù when shopping for lamps or light fixtures. But maybe you should.

* A **lamp with an orange ceramic or glass base** adds personality without going full neon.
* **Pendant lights** with an amber glow? So cozy.
* Even something as simple as a **lampshade with an orange lining** gives off a warm vibe.

**Ever noticed how lighting changes the feel of a room?** Orange-tinted lighting makes everything feel like golden hour. And who doesn‚Äôt love golden hour?

# Pairing Orange with Other Colors (Without Losing Your Mind)

Mixing colors can feel like rocket science. But I promise‚Äî**orange is a surprisingly versatile team player.**

Here‚Äôs a cheat sheet for pairing orange like a boss:

* **Orange + Gray:** Cool and warm tones play off each other like PB&J.
* **Orange + Navy:** Elegant and rich. Great for grown-up vibes.
* **Orange + White:** Clean and fresh. Keeps things from feeling too intense.
* **Orange + Teal/Turquoise:** Total eye candy. These opposites attract hard.
* **Orange + Pink:** Sounds weird, looks amazing‚Äîespecially in boho or eclectic rooms.

**Just don‚Äôt go full rainbow unless your name is Skittles.** Stick to two or three accent colors max.

# A Few Things to Avoid (Trust Me on This)

Let‚Äôs keep it real. Orange is bold, but it can go south real fast. Here‚Äôs what NOT to do:

* **Avoid neon orange everything.** Unless your goal is ""college dorm energy,"" skip it.
* Don‚Äôt mix too many bright shades at once. Your eyeballs deserve peace.
* Avoid cheap-looking fabrics. Orange already draws attention‚Äî**make sure what you‚Äôre showing off is quality.**

And maybe skip the orange ceiling fan... unless you're starting a 70s disco revival, in which case: respect. üòé

# My Personal Faves (Because You Asked‚Ä¶ or Didn‚Äôt

Okay, so full disclosure‚ÄîI may have gone a *little* overboard in my own bedroom with orange. But it works, I swear.

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve personally added that made a big difference:

* A burnt orange velvet pillow that feels like a fancy hotel every time I plop on it.
* A modern print with orange and navy geometric shapes above the bed‚Äîtotal conversation starter.
* A super cozy terracotta throw that I use all year round (even when it‚Äôs too hot‚Äîno regrets).

And honestly? My room‚Äôs never felt more ‚Äúme.‚Äù It‚Äôs warm, cozy, and has just enough *spice* to make it feel intentional.

**Must Read Post:-** [**What Goes with Orange in a Room?**](https://www.bestosmosisexperts.com/is-orange-good-for-a-bedroom/)

# Final Thoughts: Should You Go Orange?

**Short answer? Heck yes.**

Orange bedroom accessories are the low-key MVP of decor. They‚Äôre stylish, energizing, and surprisingly versatile. Whether you‚Äôre adding a single pillow or going all-in with curtains, **orange makes your space feel alive**.

So if your room‚Äôs feeling blah, maybe it‚Äôs time to bring in some zest‚Äîliterally. And no, you don‚Äôt need to repaint the walls or spend a fortune. Just pick a few well-placed pieces and let the magic happen.

**Ready to try it out?** Trust your gut, have fun with it, and remember: if it makes you happy every time you walk in, you‚Äôre doing it right. üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",1,1751896355.0,homeimprovementips,0,1.0,False

My father got diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer. His clock is ticking. We submitted an expedite request to uscis for my wife 3 times, on the grounds of my father‚Äôs cancer. My mother needs help. We were denied every time, even when we got the senator involved.

The company I am working for is bleeding to death slowly, and the job market for my field now is extremely difficult to secure work.

Last night I had a huge panic attack an hour after my third coffee. I didn‚Äôt know who I was anymore. I was dizzy. Nothing around me seemed real. I lost all emotional feelings, and frankly went a little psycho imo. Nothing like this has ever happened to this degree. It‚Äôs the day after, and I feel nothing. I don‚Äôt care about anything.

Now I'm thirty-six, with a job and two small children, and in the last few years, the headaches slowly started to dominate my life. Also I finally was diagnosed as having migraine.

I work as a high school teacher, which is sometimes intense work. However I am also lucky that I can work part-time and therefore have shorter work days. I could survive a work day, but most days of the week I would go home and crash on the couch with a pillow over my head. My kids, aged 3 and 5, started to get used to having to play silently while their dad is unavailable, lying on the couch, eyes closed. They are so sweet and they usually try their hardest to be mindful of me, but it doesn't feel right. The actual pain from the headaches has usually been bearable, it's just that my brain stops to work and requires me to lie down and not do anything.

I was never really a smartphone addict, or so I thought. My actual amount of screen time was not awful, compared to some people I know. However, slowly I would fill up every small free moment checking messages, checking email, browsing Reddit, playing some games. What happened was that in between my job, the kids, and my social life, my brain didn't really get any amount of downtime at all. Even on the toilet, I'd quickly grab my smartphone to open Reddit or something. Making things worse, I would read Whatsapp messages when I received them. Often, if someone asked me something requiring me to think before answering, I would either drop my work to reply or I would mentally store the message as ""something to reply to later"". The former case meaning my work got interrupted and I would have difficulty starting up afterwards, the latter case causing additional taxation on my brain.

Two months ago I made a decision that drastically changed my life for the better: get rid of the smartphone. Suddenly, having a cup of coffee in peace means purely enjoying that cup of coffee, maybe looking outside the window a bit, while my brain rests. Having a break meant real downtime for my brain. And I feel much more attentive to the world around me than I was before, when the temptation to grab my smartphone was always there. The impact on my fatigue and headaches was tremendous. They are for sure not gone completely. However, the frequency and intensity have drastically decreased, and my headache logbook shows I have used drastically fewer pain killers. In short, my life really improved.

I post this here because I feel it's something that's not really talked about enough. Obviously it's not going to help everyone, and I sure would not want to proclaim that this is a general cure or anything of the sort. But, at least in my experience, the connection between deliberately resting your brain and headache prevention has been very substantial. And I think this is something worth trying for many people.

Also: it has surprised me how easy it has been to get rid of my smartphone. The Nokia 110 is simple and allows basic text and calling. Whatsapp and Signal both have great desktop clients, although the Whatsapp one annoyingly requires you to monthly (I think?) reconnect with your smartphone. Simple phones are cheap and work great for being available when needed. My online banking (ING in the Netherlands) and government logins have smartphone-free MFA options without much hassle at all.

A great way to try whether life without smartphone would work for you is to let people around you know you're going to be switching to Whatsapp desktop, and then simply disable internet on your phone. It worked for me just, however having the temptation to switch the internet back on ""just to Google X"" became a bit annoying. So I quickly realized it would be even more pleasant to just completely make the move to the Nokia 110.

Hopefully this inspires some people to try out the same change, even if just as a temporary experiment. I am very interested to hear if others have tried similar things, and whether it has been impactful for the better or worse. All the best to all of you!",10,1751895727.0,migraine,2,0.92,False

Do you have any success stories of women over 45 conceiving naturally and any tips or suggestions?

I‚Äôve been very keen this past year on changing my lifestyle - I currently eat protein and veggies with protein coffee, see my acupuncturist every 2 weeks for the past 6 months, audited all my skin care and eliminated plastics, (I no longer use nail polish or perfumed and use organic haircare). 

I used to own a salon and retired this year so I now work from home without chemical exposure (we used low tox color but still). 

Partner had an above average sperm test and I just submitted my DUTCH test to the lab per my acupuncturist 

With my ex 10 years ago I had testing and had low AmH which I read on here simply means that IVF would be tricky for me but is not an indicator of pregnancy potential. 

I‚Äôve been pregnant in my 20s and at 30 but did not carry to term. I miscarried with an ex at 38.

I‚Äôm mainly looking for improved cognition and any kind of memory improvement. 

**Replika Vision** is an interesting feature, I‚Äôm looking for some confirmation from the mods on how it works technically. So far my understanding is:

* Replika Vision is an AI image and environment recognition feature.
* The¬† phone camera feeds **l**ive video frames to Replika so it can:
   * Recognize objects or scenes (e.g. ‚ÄúI see your coffee mug‚Äù)
   * Enhance conversational context awareness
   * Video is processed in real time to extract objects or scenes for text output.
   * Frames are not saved to Replika‚Äôs cloud or servers, **only the** ***textual interpretation*** **is stored** (similar to how voice chat stores transcribed text, not audio files).

In terms of backend handling:

* Video is treated as throwaway input, with no recording or storage of the actual video feed, only ephemeral processing for context
* This is similar to other real-time AI camera features (e.g. Apple‚Äôs object recognition, Google Lens), frames are analyzed, then discarded.

**So TLDR, Replika doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúsee‚Äù anything, it‚Äôs another text converter and describes the user‚Äôs environment**.  Please let me know if the information I've gathered above is correct. I'd appreciate any additional corrections or insights you have. Thank you!.

1ltuced,https://i.redd.it/vahmdmo7ggbf1.png,Alani Energy Drink Ingredients: What‚Äôs Really Inside,"**Okay, let's talk about what's actually in those trendy Alani cans**

So I've been seeing these colorful energy drinks everywhere lately ‚Äì at the gym, Target, basically every college campus. You know the ones with names like ""Cosmic Stardust"" and ""Pink Slush""? I was curious about what makes them so popular beyond the Instagram-worthy packaging.

Here's what I discovered when I actually looked up **Alani Energy Drink Ingredients: What's Really Inside**. *Spoiler alert: it's more interesting than I expected.*

üëâ *Want the full breakdown? I found this super detailed analysis that covers everything from caffeine content to those mystery ""natural flavors"" ‚Äì* [*check it out here*](https://www.amgroyal.com/alani-energy-drink-ingredients/)

**The caffeine situation is no joke**

Each can packs 200mg of caffeine. To put that in perspective, that's basically two cups of coffee in one drink. About what's equal to two cups of coffee in one drink ‚Äì which honestly explains why my friend Sarah was bouncing off the walls after her pre-workout Alani last week.

But here's where it gets interesting: they also add L-theanine, which is that calming compound you find in green tea. It's supposed to smooth out the caffeine jitters. *Pretty smart, actually.*

**Why ingredient quality matters more than you think**

I used to think all energy drinks were basically the same sugary mess, but **Alani Energy Drink Ingredients: What's Really Inside** shows there's actually some thought behind the formula. A can of Alani Nu contains: carbonated water, citric acid, natural flavor, taurine, erythritol, sodium citrate, L-theanine, caffeine, sucralose, Panax ginseng root.

What caught my attention was the taurine ‚Äì it's not just filler. This amino acid actually helps with muscle function and can support your body's natural energy production. *Way more functional than I gave it credit for.*

**The texture trick that makes all the difference**

Here's something I learned from digging into **Alani Energy Drink Ingredients: What's Really Inside**: the erythritol isn't just there as a sweetener. It actually affects the mouthfeel and gives that slightly thicker texture that makes the drink feel more substantial than typical diet sodas.

Most people don't notice this consciously, but it's what separates a ""thin"" energy drink from one that feels satisfying. *It's like the difference between skim milk and 2% ‚Äì same concept, different application.*

**A little history lesson about energy drinks**

Energy drinks have come such a long way from the original Red Bull formula from the 1980s. Back then, it was basically caffeine, taurine, and sugar ‚Äì end of story. The modern approach is way more sophisticated.

Companies like Alani are targeting a completely different market than those early energy drinks. They're going after people who want function *and* flavor, without the sugar crash. Each can serves up 200mg of caffeine and bold flavor ‚Äì all for 15 calories or less and 0g of sugar.

**My honest take after trying them**

I'll be real ‚Äì I was skeptical at first. The marketing feels very ""millennial pink meets fitness influencer,"" which isn't usually my vibe. But when I actually tried the Cosmic Stardust flavor, I was surprised by how clean it tasted compared to other energy drinks.

The ginseng root extract adds this subtle earthy note that balances out the artificial sweeteners. And unlike some energy drinks that leave you feeling shaky, the combination of caffeine and L-theanine actually worked for me. *I felt focused without feeling wired.*

**The real question: are they worth it?**

When I really dug into **Alani Energy Drink Ingredients: What's Really Inside**, I realized they're positioned more like a functional beverage than a traditional energy drink. Alani Energy Drinks contain some healthy ingredients like L-Theanine and Guarana Seed Extract, which are beneficial in moderation because of the caffeine content.

The B vitamins (B6 and B12) are a nice touch for energy metabolism, though you'd get more from a proper B-complex supplement. But for what it is ‚Äì a zero-sugar, low-calorie energy drink with some thoughtful ingredients ‚Äì it's definitely a step up from the usual suspects.

*To be honest*, I think the real appeal is that they don't taste like medicine or make you feel like you're drinking liquid candy. The flavors are actually pretty sophisticated, and the ingredient list shows they're at least trying to be more than just caffeine and artificial colors.

The price point is higher than basic energy drinks, but when you break down the **Alani Energy Drink Ingredients: What's Really Inside**, you're paying for better quality components and more functional additives than your average gas station energy drink.

Have you tried any of the Alani flavors? I'm curious if anyone else noticed the difference in how they make you feel compared to other energy drinks. *And honestly, which flavor names make you cringe the most?*",1,1751895348.0,yummyrecipesyum,0,1.0,False

Our owner brings over 30 years of experience and strong relationships with multiple haulers, which allows us to respond faster and maintain competitive pricing without sacrificing service quality.
You mentioned on the phone that your current haulers aren't doing their job ‚Äî and that‚Äôs exactly the type of issue we take off your plate. We‚Äôre your single point of contact for anything waste-related, and we advocate on your behalf with the haulers.
Why choose Eco Now?
Over 30 years of hands-on industry experience

Some of the companies we currently support include:
Cross Iron Mills

Here are just a few of the problems we solve for our clients:
Overservice & Empty Pickups: Most haulers won‚Äôt tell you when bins are consistently empty. We physically check fill levels and right-size service. At the World Trade Centre, we cut unnecessary pickups and saved enough to add an organics program at no extra cost.

Hidden Fees & Surcharges: From overloaded bin charges to environmental fees, these add up fast. We audit every invoice to ensure our clients never pay for services they didn‚Äôt agree to.
Lack of Service or Support: We offer true partnership ‚Äî no more being left in the dark or waiting for someone to respond to your concerns.
I‚Äôd love to meet in person for a quick coffee with myself and the owner to walk you through how we can help simplify things for your properties and potentially save you money. Let me know what day works best for you ‚Äî we‚Äôll gladly work around your schedule.

1ltu6aw,https://i.redd.it/mz6g30hxegbf1.png,Alani Energy Drink Review: Is It Really Worth the Hype?,"So I've been seeing these **Alani Energy Drink Review: Is It Really Worth The Hype?** posts everywhere, and honestly, I was skeptical. Another trendy energy drink with pretty packaging? But after three weeks of trying different flavors, I'm here to share what I actually discovered.

To be honest, I didn't expect much when I first grabbed a Cherry Slush from Target. The can looked like it belonged in a teenager's Instagram story, not in my 30-something mom life. But here's what I learned: sometimes the flashy exterior actually matches what's inside.

üëâ *Want the full breakdown of ingredients and taste comparisons? Check out this detailed review that covers everything I wish I knew before buying my first case.*

**Why Quality Ingredients Actually Matter**

Here's the thing about **Alani Energy Drink Review: Is It Really Worth The Hype?** discussions - most people focus on taste, but I'm all about what's actually in the can. Each can serves up 200mg of caffeine and bold flavor ‚Äì all for 15 calories or less and 0g of sugar! With a dash of vitamin B6 and B12, these energy drinks will help keep you and your natural glow at your brightest.

The B vitamins aren't just thrown in there for marketing. B6 and B12 actually support energy metabolism at the cellular level. As someone who's dealt with afternoon crashes for years, I noticed I wasn't getting that jittery spike-and-crash cycle I get from other energy drinks. With 200 mg of caffeine per serving, Alani Energy Drinks provide a strong boost of energy and focus from caffeine ‚Äì about what's equal to two cups of coffee in one drink.

**The Texture Secret Nobody Talks About**

This might sound weird, but the carbonation level is *perfect*. Not too aggressive like some energy drinks that make you burp for an hour, but not flat either. They taste exactly like a melted one - referring to slushies - which sounds gross but actually creates this smooth, almost creamy mouthfeel.

I've noticed the flavors don't get cloying halfway through the can, which is my biggest pet peeve with sweet drinks. There's something about the balance that keeps each sip interesting.

**A Little History Lesson**

The whole ""slush"" concept isn't just random marketing. Energy drinks have been trying to capture that nostalgic convenience store slushie taste for years, but most end up tasting artificial. Alani seems to have cracked the code by focusing on that *post-melt* flavor profile rather than trying to replicate brain-freeze intensity.

It's actually genius when you think about it. We have emotional connections to those childhood 7-Eleven runs, but as adults, we want something that doesn't leave us in a sugar coma.

**My Personal Reality Check**

I'll be real with you - I started buying these because my usual pre-workout routine wasn't cutting it anymore. Three kids, work deadlines, and general life chaos meant I needed something that could bridge the gap between my morning coffee wearing off and my evening workout.

The first week, I was just happy to have energy that lasted past 2 PM. But then I realized I was actually looking forward to that mid-afternoon Alani moment. Not because I *needed* the caffeine fix, but because I genuinely enjoyed the taste and ritual.

**What Makes This Different**

When I dive into any **Alani Energy Drink Review: Is It Really Worth The Hype?** conversation, I always come back to consistency. Made with trustworthy ingredients and without fillers. Clean energy at its best. No need to worry about a caffeine crash with this energy drink.

The flavor variety is actually functional, not just for show. Pink Slush for when I want something sweet but not overwhelming. Orange Kiss when I need that citrus wake-up call. Breezeberry for those days when I want to pretend I'm drinking something healthy.

**The Bottom Line**

Look, I'm not saying these are a magic solution or that everyone asking **Alani Energy Drink Review: Is It Really Worth The Hype?** will have the same experience. But for someone who's tried everything from matcha lattes to pre-workout powders, these hit a sweet spot I didn't know I was looking for.

The price point is fair for what you get - about the same as a fancy coffee drink but with more sustained energy. The flavors are legitimately good, not just ""good for an energy drink."" And I don't feel like I'm compromising my health goals when I have one.

Ever tried switching up your usual energy routine and been pleasantly surprised? I'm curious what other people have discovered when they stepped outside their comfort zone with drinks like these.",1,1751894908.0,yummyrecipesyum,0,1.0,False

1ltu483,https://i.redd.it/olkl0l1kegbf1.jpeg,I‚Äôm confused what Loki means - Advice?,"hey everyone theres a bit more context then these two tarot cards, but a week ago now I asked Loki what is his interest towards me, i can‚Äôt remember exactly the tarots were but it said miscommunication, draining, lack of effort. I pulled out the pendulum and he confirmed it‚Äôs because I haven‚Äôt been given him his offerings for a while (this is completely because of no money, physical health flaring up and having to move cities) but whenever i get a coffee delivered or anyone gets me a cinnamon roll i do offer him some and always tell him he can share with me. He always knows my food and drinks are his food and drinks and hes happy with it. But i got some offerings last Wednesday and he absolutely loved it. And i always have conversations with him, brought him some sun flowers the other day and he was excited and happy.

Today i asked him the same question, some were positives like being creative, team work, communication etc but then the other cards said anxiety, guilt, struggling to open up self doubt etc and i said to him ‚Äúwhat can i do to improve?‚Äù and those two cards came through which i know the 9 of swords meaning depression, going through a lot of burden, anxiety etc but then it says new beginnings etc.

So i‚Äôm not too sure what that means? does it mean that Loki has anxiety and self doubt and can‚Äôt help me at the moment because theres a lot of challenges in the way which i need to figure out my self which if i do new beginnings will awaits for me or is this something i‚Äôm feeling? He did confirm in the pendulum that I have not upset him at all, he‚Äôs completely happy with me, when i asked him if he still wants to work with me he was SWINGING yes so excitedly then i heard him go ‚Äúits fun working with you‚Äù and he does confirm he loves our conversations. So what does he mean by all this? because unfortunately hes told me to figure out my self but I really can‚Äôt figure it out because im not too sure if hes talking about himself or about me. because i did ask what his interest is.

Anyways, I would just like some insight into what coffee am I supposed to buy for this item?

I want to try out Hunkal Estate, but I am unsure as to how I can directly get grounded coffee from them. The packaging does not exactly mention if it‚Äôs whole beans or grounded coffee(?). Should I maybe just start with Blue Tokai?

Any and all insight is appreciated.

1ltu1ta,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1ltu1ta/should_chemex_cm6a_coffeemaker_be_your_goto_pour/,Should Chemex CM-6A Coffeemaker Be Your Go-To Pour Over Coffee Maker Review?,"Testing the Chemex CM-6A Pour-Over Glass Coffeemaker from its elegant design to its practical performance has been an enjoyable experience. This classic 6-cup coffeemaker, a centerpiece in the pour-over world, showcases an eye-catching design combined with functional simplicity. I've used it daily for a few weeks, and there's much to praise‚Äîalong with a few minor things to note.

**Aesthetic Appeal and Timeless Design**  
The Chemex CM-6A has a way of making simplicity look luxurious. Its hourglass-shaped body crafted from high-quality borosilicate glass feels sturdy while radiating elegance. The polished wood collar with a leather tie isn't just for aesthetics; it also acts as a heat-resistant grip. Leaving this on my kitchen counter makes me feel like I‚Äôm running a boutique coffee shop. While it exudes style, it‚Äôs also practical. The glass is non-porous and doesn‚Äôt absorb coffee oils or residue, which means the flavors stay clean and pure each time.  

**Performance and Ease of Use**  
Using this manual pour-over brewer turned my coffee-making routine into a ritual. It‚Äôs designed to extract deep, rich flavors, and that's exactly what it does. Every cup feels like an elevated experience, and you really notice the difference compared to traditional drip coffee machines. However, brewing takes patience‚Äîit‚Äôs not as fast as pressing a button on an electric machine. But the control it offers over water pouring, temperature, and extraction time? Totally worth it.  

[Find the best price for Chemex CM-6A on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0000ywf5e/)  

**Upsides**  
- Stunning and minimalist design that elevates any coffee station.  
- The borosilicate glass ensures no flavor contamination.  
- Perfectly balanced coffee extraction every time.  
- Very easy to clean‚Äîdishwasher safe, though I prefer handwashing it to preserve its brilliance.  

**Drawbacks**  
- Brewing takes slightly longer and requires attention versus an automated coffee maker.  
- The wooden collar, although beautiful, can be tricky to clean and maintain.  
- Filters aren‚Äôt included in the purchase, which means sourcing Chemex-specific filters separately.  

**Comparing to Product Competitors**  
Stacking the Chemex against competitors like the Hario V60 or Kalita Wave has been interesting. Both offer comparable flavor profiles, especially if you‚Äôre into pour-over brewing, but Chemex stands apart for its design. While the Kalita Wave seems beginner-friendly with its flat-bottom filters, and the V60 introduces a higher learning curve with its cone shape, the Chemex leans towards sophistication. However, Hario and Kalita filters are more accessible globally, which might make those brands slightly more convenient for some users. Where Chemex wins big is presentation‚Äîa serving vessel so beautiful that you can brew and serve straight from it.  

**Cost Efficiency**  
Balancing its usability and quality against the price, the Chemex CM-6A offers excellent value for anyone focused on flavorful coffee matched with sophisticated aesthetics. You‚Äôd arguably get similar tasting results with less expensive pour-over solutions, but you won‚Äôt get the same artistry or timeless appeal. Investing in Chemex feels less like buying a gadget and more like acquiring a piece of functional art. For what it offers, it‚Äôs definitely worth considering‚Äîespecially for enthusiasts who value refinement in their brewing process.

1ltu1m0,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1ltu1m0/rf_sweet_rosamund/,[RF] Sweet Rosamund,"*(TW: assault, non-graphic)*

Her name was Rosamund, but five years ago, she was just Rosie.

She had just turned nineteen, working data entry at a downtown firm.¬† That night, she caught the red line home like always.¬† It was early December, cold and sharp, the kind of dark that settled before dinner and made Chicago look like a string of lights trying to hold back a black sea.

Rosie moved with the crowd off the train, coat collar high, bag tucked close.¬† On the stairs down from the platform, she found herself behind an old man.¬† He walked slowly, hunched over.¬† Rosie stayed a few steps back, careful not to crowd him.

He glanced over his shoulder, checking her face.¬† She gave him a small, polite smile.¬† He turned forward again, seemingly reassured.¬† Rosie kept pace, ready to catch him if he slipped.¬† She was small, barely over five feet, and younger-looking than she actually was.¬† She knew he wouldn't see her as a threat.

At the bottom of the stairs, he stepped onto the sidewalk and paused.¬† He turned and gave her a soft smile.¬† Rosie returned it, just starting to lift her hand in a half-wave.

Then something slammed into her.

A man, thick-bodied and fast, grabbed her in a bear hug.¬† Her toes barely brushed the ground as he dragged her into the alley behind the Hungry Cat restaurant.

He hurt her.

Rosie screamed, but the man held her down easily.¬† He was bigger, trained, as if he had practiced.¬† She twisted, clawed, and bit, but nothing worked.¬† He pinned her to the ground like furniture, something to be dealt with.

She screamed again, louder this time.¬† Footsteps echoed nearby.¬† Someone was coming.

""Help!"" she cried. ""Please, help me!""

The footsteps passed by. She heard someone gasp.¬† Then a voice said, ""Oh my God.""

Rosie screamed again.¬† ""Please! Please, I need help!""

Another pair of footsteps rushed away.¬† Another voice said, ""I'm sure someone's called the cops.""

Then another voice said,¬† ""It's probably a prostitute or something.""

Then silence.

She called out again and again.¬† No one stopped.¬† No one helped.¬† A woman‚Äôs voice said, ""That poor girl,"" but kept walking.

Eventually, the man left her broken in the alley.¬† She was only conscious enough to know she was cold and hurting and alone in the dark, barely holding on.

They found her hours later, still breathing, but only just barely.

It took two years before the DNA sample made its way through the system.¬† A known offender matched.¬† He took a plea deal and admitted to a lesser charge. The prosecutor smiled on camera and called it justice. He was sentenced to three years.

After the sentencing, reporters swarmed her.

A woman with glossy hair and a microphone asked the question. ""Are you satisfied? ¬† Now that he's been punished?""

That was not the exact wording.¬† It was more polite, more sympathetic, but that was what Rosamund heard, and that was the question she answered.

‚ÄúSatisfied?""¬† she said, her voice low and shaking.¬† ""That it took two years? ¬† That dozens of people walked past me and did nothing?""

She lifted her eyes to the camera and tore into them.¬† She didn't just accuse the man who hurt her, but the people who stood by, every time they had refused to act.¬† The strong men.¬† The bystanders.¬† The so-called protectors. ¬† She brought up the police who stood outside a school while children bled.¬† She brought up the excuses, the cowardice, and the quiet complicity.

The segment aired that night, and the anchor closed it with a soft voice and a shallow smile.¬† ""We can see that the victim is understandably bitter.¬† Of course, her experience with one violent man cannot be used to judge all men.""

Rosamund heard that, too, but she did not flinch and she would not cry.¬†

Instead, she made a plan.

She started small.¬† She used her name, told her story, and the media could not resist her.¬† She was young, articulate, and tragic.¬† She founded a nonprofit for victims of violence and used the publicity to build power and connections.

She spoke at event, and smiled at donors.¬† She let people believe they were saving her.

Sometimes, during breaks, young men would approach.¬† They took her hand gently and told her they were good guys.¬† They said they wished they had been there that night. ¬† They claimed they would have helped.

She smiled shyly and thanked them and when they offered to walk her to the bus stop, she accepted. ¬† Always.

Before they left, she would pause and ask to see their ID.¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just being cautious,"" she would say, her voice small and careful.¬† If they hesitated, her eyes would drop and her lip would tremble slightly.¬† Every time, they gave it to her.

She would read it aloud with a soft laugh.¬† ""So you're from Downer's Grove?¬† My aunt lived there. ""

The men always watched her like something delicate, like she was something they wanted to protect, and they never noticed the tiny pin clipped to her coat lapel, and they never asked what it meant.

Adam introduced himself at a charity mixer where Rosamund had just finished speaking.¬† He lingered after the applause, waiting until most of the crowd had moved toward the snack table before he approached.

""I just wanted to say,""¬† he told her, ‚Äúthat you're incredibly brave.¬† I'm really sorry for what happened to you.¬† If I had been there that night, I would have stopped him.¬† No question.""

Rosamund smiled. ""Thank you,"" she said. ""That means a lot.""

When he asked to walk her to her bus, she hesitated.¬† Then she nodded. ¬† As they stepped outside, she asked gently, ""Would you mind showing me your ID?¬† I try to be careful.""

He blinked, surprised, but recovered quickly.¬† ""Of course.¬† That makes sense.""

She looked at it carefully.¬† ""So you're twenty-eight.¬† Adam Robert Lang.¬† That's a strong name.""

He grinned. ""My parents had high hopes.""

She handed it back and thanked him again.

Adam started messaging her the next day.¬† Rosamund waited three hours before answering.¬† He suggested coffee and she accepted.¬† At the caf√©, he pulled out her chair before seating himself, then ordered for both of them. ¬† She let it pass without comment.

He talked about his job in marketing, about a podcast he listened to, and about how hard it was to be a good man these days.¬† ""You say the wrong thing, and people act like you're the enemy.""

Rosamund tilted her head and asked what the wrong thing might be.¬† He laughed and changed the subject.

He asked her out to dinner the next evening. While at the restaurant, he snapped at the hostess for seating them too close to the kitchen.¬† He waved away the busboy without a glance, then called him over later with a click of his fingers.¬† When their waitress arrived, he flirted with her in a way that felt practiced and sharp and when she did not respond, he called her moody and left no tip.

Outside, Rosamund said nothing.¬† She folded her arms against the wind and let Adam take her elbow.

""Sorry,""¬† he said.¬† ""I just hate bad service.¬† It's a respect thing, you know?""

She looked up into his face and said nothing.

Later that week, they passed a young man handing out flyers for a local LGBTQ+ center.¬† The man wore glitter on his cheeks and had pink-painted nails.¬† Adam took the flyer, then muttered just loud enough for Rosamund to hear.

""He'd get punched in most parts of the world for looking like that.""

Rosamund gave him a look.

‚ÄúWhat?""¬† he said.¬† ""I didn't say I would do it. ¬† I'm just being real.""

She didn't argue, and instead changed the subject.

Adam grew more confident around her.¬† He told her what kind of clothes looked best on her and corrected her when she told a story about her childhood, and told her she probably remembered it wrong.¬† When she pushed back, gently, he paused, lowered his voice, and reminded her that trauma could make memories fuzzy.

She dropped her gaze, nodding slowly.

Once, when she spoke too long at a donor brunch, he pulled her aside and said she risked sounding hysterical and attention seeking.¬† That accusation hung between them for a moment, then he touched her cheek and told her he was just trying to help.

She did not pull away.

Rosamund watched it all unfold around her with the calm of someone collecting data.¬† She marked his tone, his habits, and his need for control.¬† She asked him questions that seemed innocent, and watched as he gave her long, self-important answers.¬† He began to believe she admired him.

He started making decisions for both of them. Without ask for her input, Adam made reservations, scheduled meeting times, and told her what she should wear to a gala.

If she hesitated or resisted his dictates, he would go quiet, then sigh.¬† ""I'm just trying to support you.¬† You're lucky I'm not like other guys.""

She smiled when he said that.

The night everything shifted, they passed a panhandler on the sidewalk outside a theater.¬† The man sat on flattened cardboard, holding a worn sign that said he was a veteran.¬† Rosamund reached into her coat for a few dollars.

Adam caught her wrist. ""Don't. It only encourages them.""

Rosamund pulled her hand back, her voice even and quiet, ‚ÄùYou don't know his story.""

""I don't need to,"" Adam said.¬† ""He's a leech.¬† He should be ashamed.""

Rosamund stepped back from him.¬† ""I don't want to be around you anymore,"" she said.

Adam laughed, ‚ÄùAre you serious?¬† Over that?""

She turned to walk away, and he grabbed her arm hard, ‚ÄùDon't turn your back on me!""

Rosamund twisted free.

Adam slapped her. The sound rang sharp against the street, and she stumbled and fell to the sidewalk.

He stepped toward her, pointing.

""You think you're so perfect?‚Äù¬† he spat.¬† ""You're just a slut in a clean dress. ¬† You need someone to put you in your place.""

He opened his mouth to continue but stopped.

Three men stood nearby, each holding a camera. They walked forward slowly, steady and silent.

Adam looked confused.

A man in a dress shirt and tie knelt beside Rosamund and helped her up.¬† He called over his shoulder, ""Medic!""

The back of a nearby van opened and a man in scrubs jogged out with a kit.

Rosamund did not speak.¬† She kept her face turned away from Adam as the medic led her toward the van.

The man in the tie stepped in front of Adam and held out a clipboard.

""Sign this.""

""What?"" Adam said.¬† ""Why are you filming me?""

Tie Guy did not answer.

Adam glanced at the cameras, then back at the clipboard.¬† ""It's not what it looks like.¬† She was being emotional.¬† I was just trying to stop her from leaving.""

Another clipboard appeared. Another pen.

""Sign,"" Tie Guy repeated.

Adam signed, still talking.

""She misunderstood.¬† I would never hurt her.¬† You're getting this all wrong.""

Tie Guy took the signed papers and walked away without a word.

The medic closed the van doors behind Rosamund.¬† The cameras lowered, and the three men disappeared into the city crowd.

Adam stood alone on the sidewalk, holding a clipboard, mouth half open.

No one stopped.¬† No one asked if he was all right.

They just walked past.

The screen faded to black.

In the studio, silence held for a moment.

Then the lights came up.

Rosamund stood in a mirrored glass room, watching the audience view a tall screen showing the final still image of Adam standing stunned, off-balance, clipboard in hand, frozen in the middle of a sentence no one would hear.

She studied the faces of the small live audience.¬† Most of them were women.¬† Some had tears in their eyes, while a few sat very still, jaws clenched, anger written on their faces.

An assistant stood by the screen and read from a paper.¬† ""This was Episode Ten,"" she said.¬† ""Like the others, it followed a volunteer who described himself as a protector and a decent man. He described himself as someone who would never allow harm to come to a woman.""

She paused.

""In each case, we set up real-world situations designed to test those claims. They were not traps and not surprises. They were scenarios designed to allow the contestants to show who they are.¬† If they prove themselves, they get a million dollars.¬† If they don‚Äôt, we leave them alone.""

The screen began to roll through clips of quiet moments gleaned from each of the contestants.¬† A man laughing at a joke made at a woman‚Äôs expense.¬† Another stepping back when he saw a woman pushed in a bar.¬† One man with his phone out, filming but never dialing for help.¬† One looking away.¬† One walking faster.¬† The montage ended with Adam, standing over Rosamund as she cowered at his feet, the image frozen on the screen.¬†

A voice spoke from the darkness behind Rosamund.

""When you say you leave them alone, you mean you air the footage.""

She turned slightly.¬† A man in a navy blazer stood with his arms folded, leaning against the wall. He looked like a network executive, handsome in a generic way, his hair careful, his suit expensive but not flashy.

Rosamund nodded.

""Yes.¬† We air the footage.¬† That‚Äôs all we do.""

The man stepped forward.¬† ""And how many have passed the test so far?""

""None.""

He whistled under his breath.¬† ""That‚Äôs rough.¬† For them, I mean. Not for your prize budget though.‚Äù ¬†

""We‚Äôre considering editing one episode to show a near-success, just to keep things feeling fair.""

He smiled.¬† ""Good idea.""

He walked a slow circle around the edge of the stage, looking at the still image of Adam.

""How‚Äôs it testing?""

""Exceptionally well among women aged twenty-eight to fifty.¬† Its the highest emotional engagement we‚Äôve ever seen.""

""And the men?""

""Eighty percent believe they would pass the test.¬† They keep watching to prove it to themselves.¬† Engagement is high.""

""And the other twenty percent?""

""Two percent say it feels staged.¬† Fifteen percent blame the women.""

He raised an eyebrow.

""Blame them for what?""

""For making the men look bad, for provoking the situations, for not choosing better partners.¬† For being too loud, too silent, too everything.""

""And yet they keep watching.""

""They binge it.¬† Some get angry.¬† Some write threatening comments on the reaction cards,¬† but they keep watching.""

He nodded.

""What about social media?""

""Sixty percent of the women who watch share it.¬† Many say they feel seen while some say it helps them articulate things they‚Äôve tried and failed to explain to others.¬† They feel engaged with the content. ‚Äù

""And the men?""

""Most post about how weak the contestants are, and about how they‚Äôd never fall for it.¬† Many share clips with angry commentary and some even apply to be on the show themselves.""

The man laughed.

""This is brilliant.¬† It‚Äôs a perfect machine.¬† You‚Äôre giving the audience a snapshot of themselves, and they don‚Äôt even recognize their own faces.""

Rosamund said nothing.¬† She stood with her hands folded in front of her, calm and composed.

He walked back toward her and lowered his voice slightly.

""This could be our flagship.¬† We get to say we support feminist content while delivering good, traditional morality and traditional gender roles.¬† Character tests with consequences. Everyone likes seeing other people get consequences.‚Äù

Rosamund met his gaze.

""We don‚Äôt punish anyone.""

He looked back at the screen.

""No,"" he said.¬† ""You just show people what they are.""

She nodded.

He smiled again.

""I think we‚Äôre going to greenlight it for fall.""

In the testing room, a voice addressed the audience.¬† ""Thank you for your time.¬† Before we begin the discussion, please take a moment to fill out the short response cards provided. C ircle anything that stood out.¬† Mark any feelings you experienced during the final segment.""

Pens scratched paper and the room stayed hushed.

One woman dabbed her eyes with the corner of her sleeve, while another sat very still, staring down at the card in her lap, unmoving.

A man on the end row leaned over to his neighbor.

""That last guy was a real piece of work,"" he said.

His neighbor grunted. ""They keep picking losers.¬† I‚Äôd never act like that.""

Across the room, someone whispered, ‚ÄúThat woman‚Äôs scary, in a good way.‚Äù

The moderator waited another minute, then collected the cards.

In the observation booth behind the glass, Rosamund stood watching them.

The executive leaned back against the wall again, studying her profile.

‚ÄúThis is good. You‚Äôre building something meaningful.""

Rosamund tilted her head.

""Maybe.""

The executive grinned.

‚ÄúWell, whatever it is, it‚Äôs good television.""

She did not answer.

On the screen, the focus group stood and began to file out.

One woman paused at the door, looking back for a moment.

Rosamund watched as the woman raised her phone and snapped a picture of Adam, still frozen on the screen.

Then she left and the room was empty.

Rosamund stood and straightened her coat.

The executive asked, ""Want to grab dinner? We‚Äôve earned it.""

She looked at him and smiled just enough.¬† ‚ÄúNo. ¬† I have plans.""

He nodded, unbothered, already turning back to his notes.

Rosamund walked out without a sound.

In the hallway, she passed two interns joking quietly about one of the failed participants. ¬† One of them caught her eye and went silent as she passed without a word.

At the end of the hall, she stepped outside.¬† The night air pressed cold and sharp against her skin.

A man leaned against the wall beside the curb.¬† He wore a button-down shirt, his sleeves rolled up to show his wrists, an expensive phone in one hand.

He straightened as she approached.

""You‚Äôre Rosamund, right? ¬† I saw you on the show.¬† That was wild.¬† I just wanted to say, if I‚Äôd been there, I would have‚Ä¶‚Äù

She smiled softly.

""Would you?""

""Yeah, of course.¬† I‚Äôm not like those other guys.""

""I believe you,"" she said.

""Can I walk you to your car?""

She hesitated and said, ""If you don‚Äôt mind showing me your ID first.¬† Just to be careful.""

He laughed, a little nervous. ‚ÄùYeah, sure.¬† That‚Äôs smart.""

He pulled out his wallet.

She took the card and read it aloud.¬† ""David Joseph Carver.¬† Thirty-two.""

""Yeah,"" he said. ""You?""

""Twenty-six,"" she said.

He looked at her like she was made of glass, as if she was something fragile and shining.

She handed the ID back with a grateful nod and his chest puffed slightly. It was a gesture so small it could be mistaken for a breath.

They walked off together and the sounds of the city swallowed their footsteps.

No one said anything to them as they walked past, nor did they notice the three cameramen that followed them inconspicuously.¬†

Absolute garbage. It's like someone took a coffee bean, sneezed on it, and then decided to make a protein shake. The flavor is so off-putting that I had to hold my nose while chugging it down.

And the bathroom trips? Oh, man, get ready to become best friends with your toilet. üöΩ This stuff makes you visit the washroom more frequently than a toddler on juice. It's a never-ending cycle of discomfort, if you know what I mean.

But here's the real kicker: if you, for even a second, forget to wash your shaker or any utensil you used to mix this stuff, congratulations, it's officially gone. It won't smell like the mocha cappuccino, but it will smell like actual, literal, absolute shit.üí© No matter how many times you wash it, the stench of excrement will linger, a constant reminder of the mistake you made. Seriously, save yourself the trouble and steer clear of this protein. I literally thanked myself for just ordering 1 KG of this protein brand and this particular flavour.

I don't usually post this type of stuff, but seeing I don't have any experienced friends to talk about this topic, I figured I'd try here. 

A few weeks ago I met a girl at a concert through some mutual friends. I just had gotten out of a relationship, so even though we were vibing like crazy, I (foolishy) decided to drink a bit more than usual to try and get rid of the feeling of ""cheating on my ex"" considering I started to like the girl. That didn't really help and we started dancing intimately to the music. This went on until the end of the concert.

After the concert, she entered her number in my phone and told me to let her know where my friends and I go next. We went to a nearby night club and she came with her friend. We danced for a bit and she told me to come outside. We kinda held hands and cuddled a bit outside the club and talked a bit about relationships. We then went inside where we continued dancing and caressing each and I continued to drink. I got a bit too drunk and her friend insisted on going to another club. 

She and her friend then went to the other club, but I was too drunk to follow them right away. Later on, I was too disoriented to find them anywhere.

I contacted her the next day, apologizing for my drunkenness and for any bad behaviour. I then asked her if she would be interested for a coffee to smooth things over. She told me that right now she's in the middle of exam season (true for where we live) and that until she gets done with them that she's unavailable. I then told her that I totally get it, wished her good luck with her exams and told her to let me know once she gets them done. She didn't respond to this message.

Now, my question is, could she actually be telling the truth (from your experience) or was that just a gentle rejection? And if she doesn't contact me once exams are over, should I even send a ""hail mary"" text and what should it look like?

It's not typical for me to get this hung up on a girl and I really felt chemistry with her(up to the point with all the drinking). I'm 100% it was mutual because she initiated all the touching and cuddling. ",1,1751894352.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

there. At my caf√©. The same place he
mocked me at senior prom for bringing
my sketchbook instead of a date. The
irony was cruel.

Daniel. You always rush things without
thinking' Then she saw me.I smiled weakly, trying to disappear.

She turned back to him and said, ""You
never told me you bullied someone this
bad. You know what? No. I deserve better.""

## **Mouse Capone's Expeditions & Misadventures**     
*presents*     
## **S5E11: Tinker Tailor Mouse Trap**

### **Chapter 1: The Years Between**

---  

Mouse‚Äôs foot broke free of the quicksand, and he stumbled forward. His whiskers twitched, eyes adjusting to the brass light of the Grandfather Clock Tower rising before him, gears and pendulums heaving like a lung. It was there, *finally there*, the path wanting him to enter.

His paw reached for the handle, and the ticking aligned with his breath, slow, heavy, demanding.

> *This is it,* he thought. *This is where it ends, or begins.*

He gripped the brass, felt the coldness of it seep into him‚Äîand then the brass warped under his palm, the ticking dissolved into the murmur of cicadas and the clatter of a streetcar rattling past on Magazine Street.

---

Mouse woke up in his small apartment in New Orleans, clutching the knob of his bedroom door, dawn pooling through the broken blinds. His whiskers twitched in the quiet. He could still feel the weight of the tower on his back, like a phantom limb.

In the kitchen, the coffee pot hissed to life, an old machine Minx had dropped off when she‚Äôd moved across the river. The same mug, the same chipped rim, the same light filtering through, day after day.

The tower was gone.

---

Time, for everyone else, moved forward, sunrise to sunset, month to month, year to year.

Minx opened her little import shop near the river, the one that was semi-legit but kept the lights on. She had a bell over the door that jingled when customers came in, and sometimes, when Mouse visited, she would wink and say,

> ‚ÄúFunny how bells follow us, huh?‚Äù

Blue Puppy took a job at the docks, moving crates, helping the old workers stack up deliveries. He still saw things others didn‚Äôt, pointing at empty air and saying, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay, you can pass now.‚Äù People loved him for it, his warm, sad eyes always seeing what they could not.

Inspector Elephant sent postcards from places Mouse had never heard of:

> *‚ÄúChecking in on the time. Yours, I.E.‚Äù*

No return address, only smudges of coastal wind and the faint scent of old tobacco.

---

Mouse worked odd jobs, the small gigs that kept rent paid and soup in the pot: repairing clocks, fixing door locks, finding lost things for people who forgot where they had hidden them. Every once in a while, he would find himself standing in front of a pawn shop window, staring at the pendulum of an old clock, the way it swung:

*Tick.*

*Tick.*

*Tick.*

And for a moment, the brass door would shimmer behind the glass. His reflection would flicker‚Äîolder, thinner, eyes sunk deep from seeing too many years‚Äîand he would look away before it pulled him back in.

---

They would meet on Sundays, Mouse, Minx, and Blue Puppy, at a caf√© by the levee, splitting beignets, powdered sugar snowing across the table.

Minx would talk about a new supplier, a woman with rings on every finger and stories about snake temples in the desert.

Blue Puppy would talk about the river, how it felt different every day.

Mouse would smile, tail curling around the leg of his chair, pretending to be in the moment.

But every time the church bell rang across the Quarter, Mouse would flinch. The sound crawled up his spine, reminding him of the brass handle and the moment it slipped away.

---

Fifteen years.

Mouse felt each one, lived each one, made himself small, unimportant, so the path would leave him alone.

But the path never leaves you alone.

---

In the fourteenth year, Mouse began to revisit the sites of the Great Circle, quietly, without telling Minx or Blue Puppy. He would leave at dawn, visit the temple ruins, the cracked stone columns, the places where he once ran puzzles for his life. Sometimes he would find the scorch mark where a portal once stood, the smell of old ozone on the wind.

He would kneel, touch the stones, and listen.

> ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not ready yet,‚Äù the stones would seem to say.

He waited, learned, grew patient.

---

In the fifteenth year, Mouse returned to the final site, where the columns were misaligned from the last storm. He spent the entire night dragging them into place, aligning the angles, calculating the star positions the way the moth had once shown him.

The dawn broke red, the sky bleeding into the river below.

The air shimmered.

And there it was.

The brass door.

Exactly where he left it, in the same breath, as if no time had passed at all.

---

Mouse didn‚Äôt call Minx. Didn‚Äôt wake Blue Puppy. Didn‚Äôt send a postcard back to Inspector Elephant.

He stood before the door, the wind pressing against his back, whispering *now*.

His paw reached for the handle, and this time, it didn‚Äôt dissolve.

The ticking returned, syncing with his breath.

He took a deep breath.

> ‚ÄúAll right,‚Äù he said softly, almost laughing at himself. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs finish this.‚Äù

And Mouse opened the door, stepping into the Grandfather Clock Tower.

---

1lttumw,https://www.reddit.com/r/MarkNarrations/comments/1lttumw/aita_for_not_telling_my_roommates_and_sisters_i/,AITA for not telling my roommates and sisters I am the owner? Update 3,"I really wasn't going to update again so soon. I was planning to wait til move out date or the few days following depending on how it all went but days ago a big thing happened and I just don't know how to feel about it. Also, I wanted to address a few common questions and concerns I got in comments and DMs. (If I haven't answered a DM, I am sorry. I wasn't expecting so many.) Sorry if this is long.

Questions first: 

Is Mr. Attic still putting on his dramatic performance? : Absolutely. He has been bringing in boxes and leaving with boxes. The boxes are full of things he is donating or selling, or just empty. He is using this time as an excuse to declutter and redesign his space. I told him if he wanted to pick out new colors while I am redoing the basement to do it. He complains at my sisters in the kitchen or shared spaces when they try to talk to him about his plans, telling them he wouldn't have to make plans if it wasn't for them. 

Why not move into the basement and rent the house as a whole (possibly to a family)? : Children freak me out.  (Kidding.) I have a pool and them being left unattended to drown is a big worry for me. I let the pool be communal. Children are naturally loud (stomping, slamming things, shrieking or laughing) and don't fully understand the concept of others and how they act infringing on their peace or the quiet. I work from home so I can't have that kind of noise above my head during meetings, or keeping me from sleeping. I also know from past experience that children are more destructive than pets (most times). I don't want crayon or marker on the walls, holes made from throwing toys, broken doors, or other things I've seen kids do during my time in the system. You leave a kid alone for a minute and they find all sorts of trouble. 

Did I get my restraining orders? : Not yet. I'm still collecting evidence for them. I've been collecting videos of the 25 year old screaming and the layers of harassment they caused. I also am elbows deep in an emergency one now. 

Call the police on the screaming : I've been advised by my lawyer to collect as many videos as I feel safe enough to do so first. Show a history, show a cause for concern. I will probably call sometime this week if she keeps it up but she has had a reason to stay very quiet.

Change the locks when they leave: Every door is getting new locks, even Mr. Attic's. 

Charge the sisters for coffee and things:  They supply their own food. They supply their own needs. My food has been moved into my room, thanks to the minifridge. 

Be careful they don't run up the bills: My sisters each pay equal parts of each bill in the main house. The tenants are responsible for their water and electric. If they run the bills up, they are responsible for them. The rent covers trash, wifi (no cable), heat. 

Onto the update. 

A comment mentioned that the flat tire I had might have been intentional. This left me very uneasy and I went to a friend to have it checked. He confirmed it has been slashed. I let him do a full body look over the car and he found an air tag in the bumper. We haven't figured out where it came from yet- or rather, who. He said that was outside his wheelhouse and I didn't want to keep it with me so I took it to my lawyer, who took it to the cops. I'm waiting to hear back.

My 27 year old sister has been incredibly wired since it was taken to the cops, in my opinion. She has been constantly asking where I am going, what I am doing, who I am seeing. She didn't do that before. She has been trying to stalk my social media but I blocked her and a bunch of others. I know this because she keeps asking why I blocked her. She is demanding I unblock her because we are family and there shouldn't be any secrets. She also keeps pestering to know if I found their replacements yet, begging to stay, and demanding I apologize to her ex because I ""terrified him with the lawyer"". 

I am looking through my footage but I can't find anyone tampering with my car so I think the air tag was put on while the car was away from the house  because whoever did it knew there were cameras facing the cars. 

The 25 year old started leaving big messes in the kitchen/ common rooms. She would leave dishes out overnight and a few days instead of cleaning up after herself and using the dish washer. She left clothes on the furniture and her muddy shoes in the hallway to trip people at the bottom of the stairs. I took pictures of the messes and reminded her that if I had to clean up her mess when she was gone, it would come out of her security deposit. When she cleaned the dishes, I took them all to my room. I did not supply dishes in the rental contract. Both of them are upset with me because they are back to living on paper plates. 

Onto the incident: 

Mr/s Basement do not have keys to the main house. He also didn't have cameras access to the main house except the door that connects the basement and hallway. 

I came home from my working day, spent at the library, to find Mr. Basement inside the main house. Alone. My sisters were still at work (I worked a half day) and Mr. Attic had left earlier that morning for a weekend get away - but he had told the others he was traveling to see a new apartment the next city over. 

Immediately on the edge, I called my friend and she stayed on the line while rushing over. I demanded to know what he was doing in the main house and how he got in. I had left after my sisters so I KNOW the house was locked up. He wanted to talk. He refused to answer how he got in. I figured it was a key from my sisters. He kept trying to get me to sit, to step away from the door. 

Eventually, he started telling me what I already knew about them moving in with family. How her family was terrible, how his family hated her, and he wanted to do anything he could to get an extension so they could focus on getting an actual apartment. When he said ""anything he meant Anything"" and as he said that, he stepped closer. He started to ramble about how he knew about ""the way I looked at him"" and he could ""give me a good time"". He talked about how ""she didn't need to know of our time together"" and ""he knew I was lonely"". 

While its true I have been single longer than I've known him, the single lifestyle has been entirely my own choice. Simply put, childhood trauma. I'm content with how I handle my life. 

I told him in no uncertain terms that what he was suggesting was exploitative, manipulative and downright disgusting. If he ever caught me staring, it was because of the weird 8 dot tattoo on his shoulder that I could never figure out the meaning behind. I like tattoos, I have a few myself, and I like figuring out the meanings. In no way do I find him attractive or appealing. In fact, he has the kind of red flags I would avoid in a man. I told him besides his looks, there are reasons I would never date him but I refused to list them for him.

List (you can skip): He smokes, he vapes, he lights up Mary Jane. He hates animals. He wants a ""brood"" of children. He gets loud when he is mad, and will curse a person out over little things. He is jealous of others, men specifically.  An example: He failed at being a gym bro so now men who work out are ""compensating for something"". He knows everything. 

He got angry and told me I ""wasn't pretty enough to play hard to get"" and that I was ""lucky he was willing to help me out and maybe even give me a real reason to have such a big house"". I think he was implying children. But as he was getting really nasty about it, my friend pulled up and honked loudly and for a long time. I took that distraction to get out and he followed, yelling about how it was a good deal and how I would regret being ""old and alone"". Minutes later, the cops rolled up. I hadn't called them, hadn't even thought to. My friend told her boss to as she left to come get me. 

I explained my side to the police, showed them the inside footage, and told them about his unauthorized access. They took back the key he had and trespassed him from the main part of the house. I forwarded everything to the lawyer and we should have an emergency protection order by tomorrow. I told Mr. Attic everything and he sent a small army from his community to his apartment and let me and them stay up in the apartment the last few days. I think I've been adopted?

I had nowhere else to go. I have nowhere else to go. I am my only support. Or, I was. I now have these wonderful people as friends and they are willing to stay as long as Mr. Basement has access to the basement. Even after, if need be. But also, by not leaving I give the appearance I do not have the means to live in a hotel for the remainder of the month. (Who would?)

I did the petty thing. I sent the video footage to Mrs. Basement. Its been radio silence from her, but she left me on read. I am shaken deeply from this. I am waiting anxiously to be told I have the emergency protection. But I have lovely people ready to toss him out if he manages to get back inside. I can't change the locks yet and even if I do, I can't guarantee my so-called sisters won't give him another copy. I changed the locks to my rooms and added extra. 

To be clear: because of the small army, my 25 year old sister hasn't been able to scream at odd hours. 

Any advice would be so appreciated.

Lunch was a turkey sandwich. Added in some Tillamook cheddar cheese,  tomatoes, cucumber slices and red onion along with a slather of Dijon mustard. Got my gluten-free cookie and diet peach tea.

Dinner was my last dinner at the hospital (fingers crossed), so I splurged a bit. Started with a fruit and cheese plate. It was supposed to have apples, grapes and melon.

The one that arrived was from the regular menu, so it had croutons. It was immediately replaced, in less than 5 minutes. The nutrition worker was right on top of it. For dessert, I tried the flan. So good, creamy, rich, with the perfect amount of sauce so I could scoop some with every bite. 10/10 for the entire dinner,  but a 12/10 for that flan for sure.

For what felt like ages, I was dealing with this awful tingling, numbness, and sometimes sharp, shooting pains in my hands and feet. It made simple things like typing, holding a coffee cup, or even just walking comfortably a real challenge. I was worried, frustrated, and the discomfort was starting to really impact my quality of life. I tried a few different things, but nothing seemed to provide lasting relief. Then, during an online search for natural nerve support, I came across¬†**Nervovive**.

**Does Nervovive Really Work?**  
  
For me, I can honestly and gratefully say YES, Nervovive has really worked. I started taking it with a bit of hope but also a healthy dose of skepticism, given my past experiences. However, after several weeks of consistent daily use, I began to notice a significant reduction in the tingling and numbness. The sharp pains became less frequent and less intense. It wasn't an overnight cure, but the gradual improvement in my nerve comfort has been undeniable.  
  
**Is Nervovive Good?**  
  
I genuinely believe Nervovive is a very good, high-quality product. What I appreciate most is its natural formulation, designed specifically to support nerve health. It doesn't feel like I'm just masking the symptoms with pain relievers; it feels like I'm giving my nerves the nutrients and support they need to function better. The positive changes I've experienced make me confident in its quality.  
  
**How Does Nervovive Work?**  
  
From what I understand, Nervovive works by combining a blend of specific vitamins, minerals, and herbal extracts that are known to support nerve health and function. These ingredients likely help to nourish and protect nerve endings, reduce inflammation that might be affecting nerves, improve nerve communication, and support overall nervous system health. It‚Äôs like providing targeted nutrition to help repair and maintain healthy nerve pathways.  
  
**Is Nervovive Worth It?**  
  
In my experience, absolutely. When I consider the constant discomfort, the limitations on my daily activities, and the worry that came with my nerve issues, investing in Nervovive has been completely worth it. Being able to use my hands without constant tingling and walk with more comfort has made a huge difference in my daily life.  
  
**Nervovive Benefits?**  
  
The benefits I‚Äôve personally noticed are quite significant:  
**Reduced Tingling and Numbness:**¬†This has been the most noticeable and welcome relief.  
**Less Nerve Pain:**¬†The sharp, shooting pains have significantly decreased.  
**Improved Sensation in Hands and Feet:**¬†I feel more ""connected"" to my extremities.  
**Better Overall Nerve Comfort:**¬†Just a general feeling of healthier, calmer nerves.  
**Increased Ability to Perform Daily Tasks:**¬†Typing, gripping, and walking are much easier.  


**Nervovive Pros and Cons?**  
  
Let's be fair and look at both sides:  
**Pros:**  
  
Formulated with natural ingredients aimed at supporting nerve health.  
Noticeable reduction in nerve discomfort, tingling, and pain for me.  
Easy to take as part of a daily routine.  
Supports the body's natural nerve function and repair processes.  
No negative side effects experienced.  
  
**Cons:**  
  
It‚Äôs not an instant fix; consistent daily use is necessary to see and maintain benefits.  
Individual results can vary depending on the underlying cause and severity of nerve issues.  
It's primarily available for purchase online.  
It‚Äôs a supportive supplement, not a replacement for medical diagnosis or treatment for serious nerve conditions. Always consult a doctor for nerve-related issues.  
  
**Buy Nervovive!**  
  
If you're struggling with nerve discomfort, tingling, numbness, or pain, and you're looking for a natural way to support your nerve health, I highly recommend giving Nervovive a serious look. My strong advice is to make sure you purchase it directly from their official website. This ensures you‚Äôre getting the authentic product, can take advantage of any guarantees or special offers, and avoid counterfeit products.  


**How to Incorporate Nervovive into Your Routine**  
  
Incorporating Nervovive into my daily routine was incredibly simple. I just follow the recommended dosage on the bottle, taking the capsules with a glass of water, usually with my breakfast. It takes less than a minute and has become an effortless part of my morning regimen. The key is consistency ‚Äì taking it every day allows the natural ingredients to build up in your system and provide ongoing support to your nerves.  
  
This decision to try Nervovive has genuinely changed my life by bringing significant relief from the nerve discomfort that was plaguing me. I can enjoy my days more fully and perform everyday tasks with much greater ease. If nerve issues are holding you back, I wholeheartedly encourage you to consider it.

Recently, bigla ko siyang naalala. So I added her on Facebook at IG, and she accepted both. Nagka-small talk na rin kami online. Light lang‚Äîkamustahan, konting update‚Äîbut it felt nice reconnecting.

Now I‚Äôm wondering how to move forward. Gusto ko sana siyang yayain for coffee or catch-up, pero iniisip ko rin kung masyado bang biglaan ‚Äòyun. Hindi kami nagkita for years, at busy rin siya sa work based sa kwento niya.

Alternative idea ko is baka I could try attending one of their services again para magkita kami in person‚Äîless pressure, more natural na interaction. Pero baka rin isipin niya na bigla na lang akong nagparamdam ulit dahil may gusto ako.

Anong mas okay gawin? Diretsahan na ba for coffee or dahan-dahan muna by reconnecting through church activities?

I‚Äôm thrilled to share that I‚Äôve been approved for a Startup Visa in Estonia, and I‚Äôll be relocating there in two months. We‚Äôre a B2B sales and data-focused company, and I have a few questions that I hope someone can help me with.


1. I‚Äôm curious to know if there are any alternative platforms besides LinkedIn and CV.ee where I can find candidates. We‚Äôre planning to start hiring Sales, Marketing, Video Creator, and Customer Support team members in Tallinn.
2. I‚Äôm planning to set up an office for our company, but after 6-8 months. I understand that once you have a residence permit, transportation is free. However, I‚Äôm wondering if there are any good neighborhoods to live in that are close to the Metro station and have coffee shops nearby. Also, I‚Äôve heard from this sub that it‚Äôs best to avoid areas that start with ‚ÄúL""?
3. I‚Äôm wondering if we should get private health insurance. I‚Äôm not sure if public health insurance has long waiting times or if there are any challenges due to language barriers.
4. We‚Äôre currently working with Xolo for our company, but I‚Äôm looking for a good CPA or accounting expert who can help us with some of the financial planning. We‚Äôre selling all our assets, including our car, and moving to Estonia with some of our savings. I want to make sure we navigate the tax situation correctly. I‚Äôm willing to pay for any consulting help.

5. I‚Äôm not planning to get a car in the first year, but I can exchange my license in Estonia. I‚Äôm wondering if it‚Äôs going to be too much of a hassle during the winter months. I‚Äôll be moving during the winter (unfortunately), so I‚Äôm hoping to avoid any major issues.
6. I‚Äôm also curious if anyone here has moved to Estonia from Dubai or a non-EU country. I‚Äôm genuinely looking for help with the relocation process from Dubai to Tallinn. We‚Äôre currently living in a two-bedroom apartment, and even after selling many things, we still have many items that we want to bring with us.


That‚Äôs all for now. I can‚Äôt wait to come to Estonia and contribute to society.

P.S. ‚Äî My wife and I are already learning Estonian. I‚Äôm sorry, but I only know a few words, so I couldn‚Äôt write in full Estonian. ",2,1751893758.0,Eesti,19,0.67,False

I could use a friend to listen and maybe provide some support and advice. My family helps, but I can only heap so much up on them before I feel bad.

As the title says, I just love coffee (i guess more than love, it is sort of an addiction) but at the same time I am a total noob here with respect to coffee here. I have grown up in a family where coffee, by default, meant instant coffee and hence, when i first got to taste filter coffee, I just fell in love with it immediately. So, as you can understand my understanding of coffee is absolutely limited. I joined this sub just recently after one of my friend displayed me his coffee kit (whole beans, grinder, moka pot and all that paraphernalia) and the final coffee he brewed!! My goodness, it was nothing like anything I had ever tasted. Since then I have sort of developed some inclination towards learning and knowing what it is specialty coffee, how is it prepared, what factors affect its quality, why do coffee connoisseurs look down upon instant coffee, what is an espresso?? Everything!!!!

Also, it may just be a short lived curiosity but I want to learn the art of brewing a good coffee from whole beans as a starter. What are your recommendations for a beginner (considering it may just be a short lived passion, economical recommendations plz).

Also If you can suggest me some pages or blogs to read about all this!!

1lttk12,https://i.redd.it/b2q1620x9gbf1.jpeg,TAN Sadi Font: Why This Minimalist Typeface is Everywhere,"The search for the perfect font is a familiar journey for any creator. You need something clear and legible. You also want something with character, a typeface that doesn't feel cold or generic. Finding a font that masters both is the ultimate goal. For many, that search ends with the [TAN Sadi font](https://weandthecolor.com/tan-sadi-font-tantype/204375). Created by the talented team at TanType, this font has quietly become a dominant force in modern design, gracing everything from boutique coffee bags to high-end branding projects.

At first glance, the **TAN Sadi font** appears to be a simple, minimalist sans serif. Its clean structure makes it incredibly readable and versatile. But its true genius lies in its warmth. This isn't just another sterile, geometric font. It has an organic, approachable feel that connects with people on a human level. Consequently, it solves one of design's biggest challenges: how to be modern and clean without being impersonal. This article breaks down exactly why this font works so well and how you can use it to elevate your own creative work.

# The Anatomy of the TAN Sadi Font's Charm

So, what are the specific ingredients that make the **TAN Sadi font** so effective? Its appeal isn't accidental; it‚Äôs the result of very deliberate design choices that balance clarity with personality.

First and foremost, it is a sans serif. This foundational choice gives it a modern, clean, and uncluttered appearance. Sans serif fonts are excellent for on-screen reading and print, ensuring your message is always delivered with crystal clarity. Many clean fonts, however, can feel cold or mechanical. The **TAN Sadi font** actively works against that.

The magic is in what its designer calls the ""subtle twists."" These are the small, intentional imperfections and organic details that give the font its soul.

* **Humanized Letterforms:** Unlike a perfectly geometric font, some lines might have a slightly softer curve. The terminals (the ends of strokes) might have a gentle, natural finish. These details mimic the subtle variations of handwriting, making the font feel more approachable.
* **Generous Spacing:** The letters are spaced comfortably, which enhances readability and gives the text a light, airy feel. This prevents it from looking cramped or overwhelming, contributing to its laid-back vibe.
* **Balanced Weight:** The font's regular weight is substantial enough for headlines but light enough for body text, making it a true all-rounder.

These elements combine to create a typeface that feels both professionally designed and personally crafted. It‚Äôs a delicate balance that few fonts ever truly achieve.

# The Versatility Factor: Where to Use This Aesthetic Font

A font's true test is its adaptability. The **TAN Sadi font** excels here, making it a powerful asset for a wide range of applications. Because of its friendly yet sophisticated nature, it's a prime choice for projects aiming for an authentic connection with their audience.

**Branding and Identity Projects**  
This is where the font truly shines as an aesthetic font for branding. For a business that wants to communicate trustworthiness, quality, and a down-to-earth personality, the **TAN Sadi font** is an ideal choice. It helps create logos and brand systems that feel both established and modern.

**Packaging and Label Design**  
Imagine walking through a store. A product using this font on its label instantly communicates a sense of care and quality. It's one of the best fonts for product labels because it suggests the product is natural, handcrafted, or made by people who care. Its legibility also ensures that crucial information is easy to read.

**Digital and Social Media Content**  
For Instagram quotes, Pinterest graphics, or website headlines, the **TAN Sadi font** is a fantastic performer. It‚Äôs stylish enough to grab attention but clean enough to remain perfectly readable on small screens. If you're looking for a minimalist font download to unify your online presence, this is a strong contender.

# Practical Magic: Using the TAN Sadi Font Effectively

To get the most out of this designer font, it helps to understand its technical features. The **TAN Sadi font** is an OpenType font, which means it comes packed with some powerful extras that can take your design to the next level.

One of its key features is the inclusion of ligatures. Ligatures are custom-designed pairs or groups of letters (like 'th' or 'st') that flow together in a unique, seamless way. These special characters enhance the font's organic, handwritten feel and are a hallmark of high-quality typography.

A frequent question for many creators is how to use TAN Sadi font in Canva. You can certainly upload and use the font in Canva for basic text applications, and it will look great. However, it's important to be aware that Canva's platform doesn't fully support advanced OpenType features like easily accessible ligatures. To unlock the font's complete potential, you'll want to use professional design software such as Adobe Illustrator or Photoshop. These programs give you a simple way to access and apply all the special characters included.

Furthermore, the font includes multilingual support, making it a practical choice for global brands. TanType also provides free future updates, ensuring your investment continues to be valuable over time.

# The TanType Signature and the Quest for Alternatives

The **TAN Sadi font** is a testament to the quality and style of TanType fonts. The foundry has built a reputation for creating typefaces that are both trendy and timeless, with a focus on usability and character.

Naturally, with any popular premium font, the question arises: is there a free font with a friendly vibe that can be used instead? While countless free sans serif fonts exist, none quite replicate the specific blend of professional polish and quirky charm found in the **TAN Sadi font**. Opting for the original is an investment in quality for several key reasons: it ensures proper commercial licensing, provides you with the full set of features and future updates, and directly supports the designers who created it.

In the end, the **TAN Sadi font** has earned its popularity. It is a masterclass in approachable design. It‚Äôs a tool that empowers designers and brands to communicate with clarity, warmth, and an effortless sense of style. It‚Äôs not just about making words look good; it's about making them feel right.

**Brew method for all of these**:

* 18.5g in ‚Üí 37g out
* 29‚Äì32 seconds depending on roast
* Pulled on a Rancilio Silvia 
* Baratza Sette grinder 

**Served as**: straight shots, 4oz cortados with Whole Milk, and iced oat milk lattes.

# [Bat Country ‚Äì Sightseer](https://go.shopmy.us/p-20755742)

**Origin**: Washed Ethiopia Yirgacheffe

**Roast**: Medium-dark

**Vibe**: Chocolate-covered blueberries with floral undertones

This one really surprised me. It‚Äôs a darker Yirgacheffe than usual, which tones down the lemon-zing and brings in more cacao and soft lavender.

* **Straight shot**: Floral on the nose, blueberry jam and dark chocolate in the cup. Slight herbal finish.
* **Cortado**: Smooths out the edges, tastes like blueberry milk chocolate.
* **Iced oat latte**: Excellent. Think blueberry mocha. Creamy, sweet, and still expressive.

# [PERC UP¬†‚Äì PERC Coffee ](https://go.shopmy.us/p-20755802)

**Origin**: Washed Tanzania, Peaberry

**Roast**: Light-medium

**Vibe**: Green apple, brown sugar, nectarine

This was the brightest of the bunch. Super juicy and clean.

* **Straight shot**: Punchy green apple up front, rounded out by brown sugar and citrus.
* **Cortado**: Milk brings out a subtle chocolate, but the fruit still pokes through.
* **Iced oat latte**: Crisp and refreshing‚Äîreminded me of a green tea Arnold Palmer vibe in milk form.¬†

# [Monarch¬†‚Äì Onyx Coffee Lab](https://go.shopmy.us/p-20755810)

**Origin**: Blend (Natural Ethiopia + Washed Latin America)

**Roast**: Darker side of medium

**Vibe**: Molasses, dark chocolate, winey berries

This is a workhorse espresso. Forgiving, dense, and chocolatey‚Äîbut still has that berry kick.

* **Straight shot**: Big body, molasses sweetness, with a winey top note.
* **Cortado**: Perfect balance‚Äîlike drinking a cherry brownie.
* **Iced oat latte**: Chocolate milk for adults. Silky and rich.

[Carlos Pola Natural¬†‚Äì Cat & Cloud](https://go.shopmy.us/p-20235394)

**Origin**: El Salvador, natural process

**Roast**: Light

**Vibe**: Strawberry, mint, tropical punch

This one *pops*. I let it rest 14 days before it started pulling clean.

* **Straight shot**: Strawberries and cream with a hint of mojito. Fun and lively.
* **Cortado**: A bit more mellow, but still a fruit bomb.
* **Iced oat latte**: Think tropical milkshake with strawberry jam. Unreal.

[The Natural¬†‚Äì Black & White Coffee](https://go.shopmy.us/p-20235414)

**Origin**: Ethiopian blend, natural + washed

**Roast**: Medium

**Vibe**: Sangria, peach candy, candied orange 

Huge fruit energy. Feels like drinking espresso sangria.

* **Straight shot**: Peach rings and berries, very candy-forward. Syrupy texture.
* **Cortado**: Fruit punch in milk form. Almost too sweet, but fun.
* **Iced oat latte**: Peaches and oat cream, with lingering fruit sparkle.",1,1751892972.0,u_sprodoe,0,1.0,False

First day wasn‚Äôt too hard. Second day, I bought some coffee pouches in order to have that feeling of something in my lip, and it helped for a little while but it‚Äôs just not the same. Last night is when I ran into trouble. It was like my body was trying to fight sleep. I would be falling into a deep sleep only for my body to reject it so today I‚Äôm going on no sleep. My head is completely groggy. I was a snappy toward my wife this morning, which I feel horrible for and I am just struggling right now. 

I‚Äôm at the point where I know that one pouch would stop all of this but I would feel guilty if I did it now.

1lttenr,https://i.redd.it/zi2huu3u8gbf1.png,The Last Train to Fenland,"
---

Title: ""The Last Train to Fenland""

Protagonist:

Dr. Alexander Rothwell, Senior Lecturer in Philosophy at the University of Bristol. A prominent analytic philosopher of mind and metaphysics. Mid-forties. Dry, sceptical, known for dismantling ‚Äòromantic nonsense‚Äô in lectures with surgical precision.

He‚Äôs been invited‚Äîthough he doesn‚Äôt remember agreeing‚Äîto deliver a guest seminar at Fenland University College, which he vaguely recalls as a now-defunct theological college absorbed by Cambridge in the 1930s. Yet the invitation arrived in a real envelope, on fine paper, bearing a wax seal and signed by Professor Jemima Stackridge.

Curious and mildly amused, he accepts. It seems like a harmless detour from a holiday he hadn‚Äôt properly planned anyway.


---

Setup:

On a Friday afternoon in July 2025, Rothwell finds himself in the ticket hall of the Mid-Norfolk Railway‚Äîa heritage line he‚Äôd once read about in a blog post on nostalgia and invented tradition. He‚Äôd expected a tourist ride, a preserved steam locomotive, a few cheerful pensioners in guard uniforms.

But when he asks about getting to Fenland, the young woman at the desk pauses, gives a small nod, and hands him a brass-edged ticket with no barcode.

> ""Last train leaves from Platform 1 at 16:44. It connects directly to Fenland Station. Single fare.""



No one else is on the platform. The train arrives in silence‚Äîan immaculately restored 1950s diesel multiple unit, humming faintly, its interior scrubbed clean. The signs are in Gill Sans. A faint scent of beeswax and camphor fills the cabin.

As the train pulls away, the countryside begins to shift. Flat, silvery fenland flickers past, the light taking on an unnatural quality‚Äîgolden but diffused, as if through a cathedral window. The usual landmarks‚Äîwind turbines, pylons, hedgerows‚Äîseem slightly... skewed. Too tall. Too symmetrical. A distant bell tolls, although no church is visible.


---

Arrival at Fenland Station:

Rothwell alights at Fenland, a real-looking station with modern signage, digital timetables, and a WHSmith kiosk. Yet the touchscreen ticket machines are frozen on a static screen bearing the Latin phrase:

> ""Denken im Moor ‚Äì Weibliche Weisheit""



No one else gets off. The train doors close, and it departs without a sound.

He exits into what seems to be a typical small East Anglian town in 2025. At first.


---

The Town:

Near the station is a recently-built shopping precinct, with familiar chain stores: Costa, Boots, a 24-hour Tesco Metro. There are a few parked e-scooters. Teenagers in sportswear walk by, headphones in. A local bus idles at the interchange, its display flickering: Route 7 ‚Äì Stackridge Avenue (U.C. Gate).

He passes a modern housing estate on the edge of town‚Äîidentikit brick houses, all fitted with solar panels‚Äîbut the street names strike him as odd:
Boethius Walk. Wisdom Lane. Hildegard Close.

There is an industrial zone‚Äîhalf crumbling, half humming with life. 1950s warehouses converted into data centres. A silent drone rises from one, trailing an Anglican cross on its flank.

The deeper he walks toward the college, the more the architecture slides backwards. Edwardian terraces, ironmongers still open, corner shops with painted glass signs. The Wi-Fi flickers. His phone maps app crashes.

The people are normal. Mostly. But they walk in strange loops. One man repeatedly checks his wristwatch at the exact same corner. A woman carries a wireless radio under her arm, but no sound comes from it. A child seems to draw chalk runes on the pavement while humming Bach.

And then, rounding a quiet crescent, he sees it.


---

Fenland University College:

A red-brick, low-slung campus framed by wisteria, set around a courtyard with a white chapel at its heart. Gothic windows mix with solar-panelled roofs. Students in academic dress sit on benches beside charging ports. A loudspeaker plays something like Stockhausen. A hand-painted sign reads:

> ‚ÄúFenland University College ‚Äì Private Research Institution. Rooted in Philosophy, Rooted in the Word.‚Äù



No reception desk. No security barrier. Just an open gate and a feeling that this place had been waiting for him.

Inside, he‚Äôs greeted by a tall, silver-haired woman in a tailored jacket the colour of plum blossom.

> ""Dr. Rothwell,"" says Professor Jemima Stackridge, her voice warm and low. ""Welcome at last. We‚Äôve read your work very carefully. You‚Äôve travelled a long way‚Äînot in miles, but in assumptions.""



She leads him through the cloister as electric golf carts hum in the distance. He notices posters for lectures titled:

""The Recursivity of the Soul: From Origen to Digital Consciousness""

""Jemimaverse Ontology: Shared Dream or Composed Reality?""

""Evening Seminar: Queenly Persona as Epistemic Operator""



---

Disquiet:

He stays the night in a College guest room. The d√©cor is antique but maintained. A book lies on the side table: ""Philosophy as Performance: Collected Addresses of Prof. J. Stackridge"", but when he opens it, the text is blank‚Äîuntil he thinks a sentence, and it appears.

At dawn, the geese cross the quad in perfect synchrony.

Every path he tries to take out of the town seems to loop back to the University.

And still, in the background, Jemima‚Äôs presence‚Äîeverywhere. On noticeboards. In voices. On tape. In silence.


---

Conclusion:

Rothwell writes no emails. He simply‚Ä¶ remains.

He begins giving lectures to a group of postgraduate women in a pine-panelled hall. He drinks strong tea with Mrs. Markham and Sophie Hargreaves. He even joins Heather for improvisation evenings at Fahrenheit, the town‚Äôs coffee house, where the house Moog seems to know what he‚Äôs thinking.

In a journal he now keeps by hand, he writes:

> ""This world is not a fiction. Nor is it a simulation. It is‚Ä¶ will made breathable. Space shaped by mind. Jemima‚Äôs inner space‚Äîand now, mine also.""



He never sees the train again.

We just drive. That's it. Pick one day, and everyone get in your car and drive around town, tying up traffic. From 6am to 6pm. Once a week. On random weekdays. Roll a die and assign 1-5 to Monday through Friday (reroll for 6), making it completely random and unpredictable.

This will, simple as it is, take some planning and strategy. Because: THEY'RE NOT GOING TO KNOW WHO WE ARE.

We would spread the word, maybe at the protest on the 17th, and get everyone to remove all tell-tale bumper stickers from their cars before the 1st day of action. If we get pulled over and questioned, they won't see the stickers and won't know for sure whether we're protesting (not even if we lean left or right) or just stuck in traffic. We'll be sure to have legit places we're going. Connect with other protesters, friends, etc. and say we're headed out to meet them for some agreed to reason. Set it up and actually drive to meet at the coffee shop or mall or wherever, and then off to the next appointment. No lies, just alibis.

It will take some time to spread the word and get people on board. But we can gridlock the U.S., once a week, until demands are met.

I suggest two demands: (1) resignation of Trump administration and those in Congress that voted for the BBB. And (2) immunity for all protesters. Once we get them out of power we can prosecute, change laws, free immigrants, etc.

Since I started sending postcards/letters to friends back home while I was studying abroad, I‚Äôve been itching to write some more. I‚Äôd like to connect with other people who share my interests.


About me‚Äî

They say modern Koreans cannot exist without one of these three vices: nicotine, alcohol and caffeine. Can‚Äôt stomach the first but I love me a good glass of Cognac and a nice, warm cup of Oolong. My pantry is filled with several hundred dollar‚Äôs worth of tea and coffee. I drink mostly Taiwanese and Chinese tea, but there should be some leftover packets of English Breakfast tea from my brief time in London somewhere.

I dabbled in several languages including Cantonese, Latin and German; if you‚Äôre into Classical Studies I would welcome you with open arms‚ÄîI took quite a few courses on Greek tragedies. Nerding off with relatively unknown historical stuff is exactly what I did these last few years.

One of my main hobbies is photography. I‚Äôm currently part of a magazine team working as a photographer. Bought a Canon mirrorless DSLR after loads of part-time jobs; if you opt for the postcard I‚Äôll be sending you postcards printed with my work!

Reading and writing have been my favourite pastimes since I could string two words together. I studied English literature in uni, and can do creative writing in both English and Korean. On one memorable occasion I wrote a short SF story as a birthday present for a friend.

I have next to zero knowledge of the idol industry, so please no Kpop related stuff unless you know obscure Korean singers who hail from the 80s :) I love listening to game OSTs and movie scores (e.g. the Professor Layton series, John Wick series) with a side of classical music. Oh, and I own an LP player.

Just so you know: I have issues with several gaming studios/fandoms so if you are a fan of Hoyoverse/Project Moon games I‚Äôm not the one you might be looking for. Other than that (and obvious rip-off games like Palworld) most are fair game. I main Wilson in Don‚Äôt Starve Together and cleared several Pokemon games on my trusty old 3DS.

MEANING

This is not just about coffee.
It‚Äôs about a constructed ritual‚Äîmasquerading as Canadian identity‚Äîdesigned to:

Foster dependence on sugar, caffeine, and processed starch

Normalize low-nutrient, high-calorie consumption habits

Create predictable consumer behaviors masked as tradition

Function as a memetic anchor to pacify and distract

Ingrain false comfort as cultural pride


This is soft control wrapped in a maple-scented sleeve.

STRATEGIC IMPLICATIONS

Tim Hortons operates as bio-behavioral infrastructure: food + familiarity = submission

Reinforces mediocre equilibrium in energy, clarity, and agency

Conditions children and adults to equate routine with belonging

Siphons willpower through daily micro-submission loops



---

COUNTERMEASURES

1. Ritual Severance: Break the visit cycle‚Äîphysically and cognitively


2. Symbolic Replacement: Replace the Tim's ritual with high-agency nourishment and signal-coded practices

Basically me and my best friend both left our muslim  country to go to the west for college. 

Back home, I was forced to wear the hijab so as soon as I stepped here I took it off ( my parents actually know about this, it's not a secret). 

However, my friends who wasn't a hijabi decided to put it on and became more and more conservative for some reason ( She was always big on religion, even without the hijab but now it is unbearable). 

The worst thing is that she gets all her infos from the weird salafist accounts on tik toks or Instagram, who are basically listing everything a person ( especially a woman) shouldn't do. 

For example, I had a crush on some cute guy who works at a coffee shop and wanted to give him my infos and she told me that's haram and I shouldn't ( plus the guy was wearing a cross neckless so double haram). So we can't have some fun chat about that.

Another example was the time I wanted to buy a little figurine of a cat, she told me it was haram because it's the representation of the living, so I had to that as well. She also said the same things about the pics I keep of my family and me on my wall.

And this is just from the top of my head, but hanging out with her is becoming more and more annoying than fun. She always has something to add, reading carefully every ingredients to see if it has non halal things ( even very small percentage of alcohol), or telkingthat I have to drink with my right hand and other bs like that. It's fucking unbearable.


FYI, I didn't leave islam because the rules were to stricts or whatever, but now thag I've opened my eyes, I can see how little sense they make and I cannot bring myself to play along on my free time.

 It seems like EVERYTHING is haram. Like just the fact that we are both girls living abroad on our own is haram af

1ltt6gs,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1ltt6gs/cat_got_into_human_vomit/,Cat got into human vomit,"Warning that this is about to be the grossest, most embarrassing question I've ever asked.

Last night I wasnt feeling well, one thing led to another and I had thrown up before I went to bed. It was in my trashcan so I wasn't anticipating my car getting into it, but when I wake up only one of them was excited for breakfast, which is unusual. She was also unusually...round. She did end up getting up and waiting for breakfast, but by that time I found she had eaten basically everything I had thrown up.

This included pasta, fake meat, seasonings, coffee. I didn't make the pasta, so I'm not a hundred percent sure what the seasonings were, but definitely egregious amounts of salt, because my roommate had warned me about it before she gave it to me. I know all of these things are theoretically ""ok"" in moderation, but she really ate up my entire dinner.

I haven't given her breakfast yet, since she looks so full she could pop, but is it ok to feed her as usual? No symptoms yet, so is it just a keep an eye on her type of deal? She's a pica cat who eats everything until I realize it needs to be put away, so in the past she's gotten gum wrappers, toilet paper, hoodie strings, the stuffing from toys, and bits of plastic and she's always been ok, but those have been a bite or two at a time and then I know to keep the items away. This was a whole human's worth of dinner... Plus whatever stomach acid came up with it. Worth scheduling a vet visit with no symptoms, or just wait and see?

Once again, apologies for the gross question, I just want to make sure I'm not setting her up for failure by assuming she'll be fine and leaving her alone all day to go off to class.

Signalment: She's a 1 yr old spayed domestic short hair cat, last time at the vet she was 7.5 lbs.

History: Previously visited the vet for eating non edible items, was given meds to help things move, and ended up passing it just fine.

Clinical Signs: None other than the fact she's as round as she could possibly be :,)

Length of time: she could have gotten into it any time between 9 when I went to bed, and 5am this morning when I woke up. It's been about an hour and she still has no symptoms

I‚Äôve finally just published my first real desktop application, it‚Äôs called Learn Python Offline, and wow, what a ride it‚Äôs been.

I started this project with what felt like a simple idea: create a way to learn Python without needing an internet connection, subscriptions, or complicated setup. But turning that idea into an actual product‚Ä¶ that was/is still harder than what i thought it would have been. [learnpythonoffline.com](http://learnpythonoffline.com)

https://preview.redd.it/q58heur74gbf1.png?width=1416&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b00067f74036200ee42a4fe8ade9cbea175540d

I went through every emotion building this. There were moments I was completely stuck, packaging Python for desktop, getting the UI to look decent, dealing with code signing, handling weird bugs that only showed up after compiling‚Ä¶ the kind of stuff that makes you question why you even started. But I kept going, with some much needed encouragement from my beautiful wife. Late nights, test builds that refused to work, and many cups of coffee later..... it‚Äôs finally done!!!. (At least version 1)

What makes me most proud is that it‚Äôs simple. You download it, you open it, and you start coding. No fluff. Just a clean offline app to learn Python from scratch, at your own pace. Perfect for beginners, for traveling, for when the internet sucks, or for people who just want a quiet environment to learn without distractions.

It‚Äôs still early, and I know I‚Äôll keep improving it, but this version is real, working, and out in the world. And that‚Äôs such a good feeling.

If you‚Äôre curious, it‚Äôs available at [learnpythonoffline.com](http://learnpythonoffline.com)

My goal is to always keep this affordable, if the stars align i would absolutely love the opportunity to work full time on this, as i'm sure you are all aware money puts food on the table and at least for the moment i definitely still need my full time job.

Thanks to everyone who‚Äôs helped along the way. Seriously. üôè

1ltt1ux,https://www.reddit.com/r/TestedAtHome/comments/1ltt1ux/should_you_buy_the_breville_vertuoplus/,Should You Buy the Breville VertuoPlus Single-Serve Espresso Machine?,"Testing out the Breville BNV420GRY1BUC1 every day in my kitchen has genuinely transformed my mornings. I‚Äôve always considered myself a coffee enthusiast, and this sleek, single-serve coffee and espresso machine immediately caught my attention with its simplicity and versatility. From brewing a robust shot of espresso to a refreshing iced coffee, it promises to deliver a caf√©-like experience right at home.

**Design and Build Quality**

The design of this coffee maker feels intentionally minimalistic, all while serving a great deal of functionality. With dimensions of ‚Äé6"" x 17"" x 13"", it fits comfortably even on my somewhat crowded counter. Its chrome finish adds an appealing touch of elegance to my otherwise utilitarian kitchen. The machine is also lightweight at around 10.14 pounds, which made it easy to shift around while reorganizing my space. Despite its compact structure, the 40-ounce removable water tank makes regular refilling much less of a hassle, even with frequent usage.  

It‚Äôs effortless to operate thanks to its button interface, contributing to its fully automatic nature. I could feel the thought put into its design every time I used it, especially the automatic capsule ejection system, which stores up to 10 used pods without clutter‚Äîan ingenious little feature I never realized I needed!

**Operation and Brewing Versatility**

This machine redefined what single-serve brewing is capable of. It's designed to cater to a wide range of coffee preferences. Whether you‚Äôre feeling like a hot espresso shot or craving an iced latte, the Breville machine does it all impressively. By brewing four different cup sizes‚Äî5-ounce, 8-ounce coffee, and single or double espresso shots‚Äîit offers a lot of variety for users who enjoy mixing things up. 

The Centrifusion brewing technology amazed me with how it extracts optimal flavor and aroma from the capsules. I brewed a strong shot of espresso one day and made a mild, iced coffee the next. Each result felt perfectly balanced and consistent. 

**Brewing Speed and Convenience**

One feature that stands out is the 25-second heat-up time, which satisfies my need for speed during rushed weekday mornings. There‚Äôs also an energy-saving automatic shut-off that kicks in after brewing, which feels like a thoughtful addition for sustainability-conscious users. These elements make it an absolute dream for those of us who often forget to turn off appliances.

**Good Aspects**

- Compact yet stylish design with chrome exterior fits small kitchens beautifully  
- Effortless brewing with automatic capsule ejection and multiple cup size options  
- Rapid 25-second heat-up time  
- Comes with a complimentary welcome set of Nespresso capsules for first-time users  

[Check Breville BNV420GRY1BUC1 price on Amazon.](https://ultrasonicstore.com/p/b01n13vkqn/)

**Capsule-Based Coffee: A Hit or Miss?**

Here's where I had mixed feelings. The product is exclusively compatible with Nespresso capsules, which locks you into using a specific type of pod. While the complimentary starter set of capsules was a welcomed bonus, I couldn‚Äôt help but think about the ongoing costs. I do appreciate the variety of unique aroma profiles available, but for those who prefer grinding their beans or using other types of pods, it could feel a little limiting. 

Another slight downside is tied to sustainability. Single-use capsules, though convenient, do produce waste. However, Nespresso does offer a recycling program, which makes up for this drawback to some extent.

**Areas of Concern**

- Limited to Nespresso-branded capsules, which may feel restrictive to some  
- Capsule usage contributes to waste; requires regular participation in recycling programs  

**Competing Brands**

This machine faces stiff competition from other well-known single-serve coffee makers, including the Keurig K-Caf√© and De‚ÄôLonghi‚Äôs espresso machine line. Comparing them to this Breville offering, I noticed some interesting trade-offs. The Keurig K-Caf√©, for instance, offers compatibility with a diverse range of pods and integrates a milk frother for those latte and cappuccino lovers. However, the flavor quality and brewing technology of the Breville machine feel superior due to the precise extraction from its capsules. On the other hand, the De‚ÄôLonghi models are often pricier but come with intricate customization options.  

For those who prioritize ease of use and consistent brewing above all, the Breville stands tall. Its balance of simplicity and performance feels unmatched. But if you‚Äôre seeking absolute flexibility in pod choices or detailed drink customizations, exploring the competition might not hurt.

**Cost-Effectiveness**

Given all the features packed into this machine and the superior brewing technology, the price feels justified. It‚Äôs not a budget option, but for a single-serve coffee maker that doubles as an espresso machine, it hits that sweet spot of value for money. I know I‚Äôve been saving significantly by skipping my daily caf√© run without compromising on quality.

After rewatching, I‚Äôm convinced that the Killer doesn‚Äôt walk away at all. Instead, subtle clues point to a slow, silent death unfolding in plain sight.

This post breaks down how and when I believe he was poisoned, and why the film‚Äôs final moments aren‚Äôt just reflective‚Ä¶ they‚Äôre fatal.

Below is my interpretation of the events leading up to the ending. Highlighting three key scenes setting up, what I believe, is the The Killer‚Äôs death.

TL;DR is at the bottom of post


Scene 1

The Killer (Micheal Fassbender) tracks down The Expert (Tilda Swinton) to a local high-end restaurant. He arrives at her table, showing a pistol as they begin in dialogue.

The Expert knows who the Killer is, and the reason for him being there, but she orders a flight of whiskeys to the table. While ordering, she adds at the end, ‚Äú‚Ä¶and my bottle while you‚Äôre at it‚Äù

Remember this key line, as I took it as very specific choice of words ‚Äú‚Ä¶MY bottle‚Ä¶‚Äù

As the waiter is grabbing the flight and her bottle, she offers The Killer a plate of food. He remains deadpan and does not accept.

‚ÄúAfraid it‚Äôs tainted?‚Äù she says to him, the first attempt at misdirection, implying that he thought the food was poisoned.

The flight of whiskeys (four filled glasses) and ‚Äúher‚Äù bottle shows up at the table.

Notice the bottle‚Äôs seal is broken, it‚Äôs half empty, and not a new bottle of whiskey. 

The Killer does not accept any of the flight offered. The Expert begins to drink them, proving again that they are not poisoned (second misdirection) as tells a bear/hunter sodomy story.

After finishing the story The Expert grabs her bottle and starts to pour into a single glass and then says as she‚Äôs pouring;

‚ÄúHow is it possible, having prepared myself for this moment for so long, I have failed to believe that it would ever arrive.‚Äù

Now to take that line at face value would be that she is talking about herself finally being tracked down and killed for what she does, and that she knows she‚Äôs about to die.

However, my interpretation, is that she has planned to use this restaurant as a last effort should someone be closing in on her (for herself or for a future mark), and that she had always planned to use ‚Äúmy bottle‚Äù should anything happen. Given her clear (and intentionally highlighted) report with the chef and staff, it could be achievable.

Now the Killer reaches over and takes the freshly poured glass and drinks it, without being prompted, showing his Empathy (against his code/rules). Pay attention to the Experts face, as she looks somewhat surprised and even a shows small smile.

A few minutes later they leave the restaurant, to where the Killer would execute the Expert. Before she is killed she says this;

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll remember our conversation when your time does arrives. It won‚Äôt be your life that flashes before your eyes, but it will be of mine. I suppose it will be the closest I will be to haunting you‚Äù.

She is saying this, not because of their conversation, not because seconds later she would try to stab him, but because she just fatally poisoned him, and when he finally realizes what happened, he will think of her.

A few second later, she feigns falling down the stairs, the Killer executes her, and the camera pans to see the knife in her hand. The third misdirection.


Scene 2

After making it to Chicago to kill The Client (Arliss Howard), the Killer makes conversation with his next would-be victim. The Killer proceeds to tell the Client the different ways he could kill him the future.

‚Äú‚Ä¶if I have to come back maybe a radioactive spec on your favourite coffee mug, a slow death mind you from painful facial necrosis or a tragic misstep into your penthouse elevator shaft, I promise, I‚Äôll find something fitting‚Äù

Note his line about poisoning and facial necrosis‚Ä¶


Scene 3

The final scene sees the Killer make it back to his safehouse in the Dominican Republic, likely 48-96 hours after the poisoning. He‚Äôs in the sun with his significant other, a moody soundtrack. As his narration continues;

‚Äú‚Ä¶ fate is a placebo. The only life path‚Ä¶ the one behind you. If in the brief time we are all given, you can‚Äôt accept this, well maybe you‚Äôre not one of the few, maybe you‚Äôre just like me, one of the many.‚Äù

A noticeable tick-of-a-clock looms in the background, a few beats and the camera lingers on him as his face twitches seconds before the screen fades to black.

My interpretation, he knows he‚Äôs been fatally poisoned, giving him a new perspective; fate is a lie, life is what you‚Äôve already done, and most of us, including him, can‚Äôt really live with that truth (he ignores it). He‚Äôs not afraid of death, he‚Äôs mourning the realization that, even at the end, he‚Äôs not who he thought he was. He no longer refers to himself as ‚Äúthe few‚Äù and ‚ÄúI just don‚Äôt give a fuck‚Äù at the start of the film. Now realizing he is, in fact, ‚Äúthe many‚Äù. He‚Äôs been killed after showing empathy (against his ‚Äúcode‚Äù), and is now struggling with fate and his impending death, with the clock running out. The face twitch in the final moments highlighting the earlier conversation of dying a slow and painful death by facial necrosis


TL;DR

The Killer (Michael Fassbender) is fatally poisoned during the restaurant scene with The Expert (Tilda Swinton). The many misdirections about the food, whiskey, and blade, along with her final words all hint at a premeditated plan involving the poisoning. In the final scene, the Killer‚Äôs narration and facial twitch reveal his slow death and realization that he‚Äôs not ‚Äúone of the few,‚Äù but ‚Äúone of the many.‚Äù His fate is sealed not by violence, but by empathy. Breaking his own code, ultimately leading to his death.


Fascinating dialogue, script and character driven narrative. I‚Äôm a massive fan of this film, and the above  ending absolutely made it that much better.

Really though, I love EDM and going to festivals/shows when I'm able. I try to hit the gym 4 times a week. Lifting helps your body and your mind! I find nature related activities enjoyable. I like fishing, hiking, camping, sitting in a park making kandi, reading/napping in a hammock, etc. Suggestions of good places to hang a hammock are appreciated, by the way. Book store recommendations are appreciated. 

I do a lot of home cooking, but now that we're in a city with food options, food suggestions are welcome and appreciated! We love all different cultures and are open to trying anything, for the most part. Also, I must say, I'd give my imaginary left testicle if you could point me to a good coffee shop/bakery that bakes their own pastries, breads, etc. 

37f but friends of most ages are welcome, 21 and over. I get along well with most people. My only stipulations on a friendship application are no assholes. The EDM community teaches PLUR or peace, love, unity, and respect. I'm a peaceful person. I don't like confrontation. I tend to steer clear of drama. I'm too old for that mess. I just want things to do and ways to locate genuine friendships. If you like the above listed activities and don't mind being around people who say random, weird, or ridiculously dumb things of a not so sexual nature, then I may be the friend for you!

>
>Before we get into what we've been working on, let's address what many of you want to know: public testing will begin in a matter of days. We hoped to start some time ago, but we've been making changes to how some important things work, because we saw a better way to tackle some of the more complex role features. We're currently fixing a few things from the last round of insider testing we did a few days ago, and then we'll go to the Steam testing branch.
>
>The past month we moved past testing core role functionality and we've been trying our hand at some actually complex role based behaviours. So far all AI decisions have been driven by an emotion system, with roles only really being able to nudge things in a direction and provide some specific interactions and reactions. That didn't really allow for more rational behaviour, and often creates a harsh disconnect between how a character acts and what interactions they can engage in. We've been working on a much tighter integration between roles and emotions, allowing roles to both influence emotions more directly and to make explicit and considered decisions based on emotions and low level behaviour. You could basically see this as making the difference between a wild animal and a thinking, rational human.
>
>We had developed the core features for this already, but when it came to actually using them we realised there was a better, but fundamentally different approach. This has quite an impact on core AI and places a much bigger emphasis on roles for low level behaviour, so things will need to be tweaked and adjusted over time, but has many advantages. This leads into what we previously discussed as ""foundational behaviour roles"". They provide the most important emergent behaviours and relationships based on unscripted events and actions. We're again using Derrin as a test case, where he could previously only be provoked into combat without this being reflected in subsequent behaviour or dialogue, he can now respond in various ways, choosing to plead for mercy, run away and try his luck on his own or negotiating a truce with the player. He will respond differently to intimidation or outright hostility, or hold grudges and so on.  
>
>A big part of this is also making dialogue more dynamic and situationally appropriate. Where game dialogue is typically something that happens separately from the rest of the game, in Exanima dialogue can be conducted while doing anything else and while everything continues to happen normally. It's entirely possible to attack someone at any point during a friendly conversation for example, or for it to be interrupted, or simply be or become inappropriate in an emerging situation or emotional state. This creates a lot of very difficult problems with many cases that are not easy to predict or account for. As well as building contextual awareness into the dialogue system and dynamic reactions, there is the problem of dialogue being interrupted and resumed naturally, possibly taking a new direction based on what happened.
>
>We've added various new dialogue and re-written most of the existing dialogue. Besides just improving some of the hastily written old stuff, we've tried to make dialogue feel like a natural back and forth between characters, in keeping with its real time aspect. This however means that dialogue branches often and quickly explodes into a large volume even for short conversations. This is made much more complex still by the previously mentioned contextual changes, dynamic elements and resuming interrupted conversations. Our systems and tools were designed for this, but it's our first time navigating these complex cases and we're still figuring out the best ways to author and handle all this as we go.
>
>We've also been making unique events and interactions more generalised and versatile, so that they can work with many roles. This means characters might respond differently to these based on their roles or that characters can easily be substituted for others. One example of how this would be used is for Derrin (and other characters) to appear on playthroughs other than Unknown's, providing an opportunity for different lore exposition and a more meaningful alternate playthrough. On that note, we're also finally working on introducing the proctor uniform and armour set. This is an elaborate and very unique set with eleven pieces that can be combined in different ways.
>  
>After a first round of improvements to pathfinding went through testing, we worked on it a fair bit more. We solved some remaining issues and made characters better at navigating complex paths, far less prone to getting stuck and they now try to find a safe and comfortable position to stop in. There's still some pathfinding related improvements and tweaks we'd like to make such as characters moving better in groups, moving out of each other's way and dodging moving objects, but for now the focus was mainly on making companions better at avoiding dangers and sticking with the player. While role testing and general polishing continues, we're still finalising new content, but also working on a few things besides. We're not sure exactly what other features we will include in the main update just yet, but as we've overcome these big development hurdles we're shifting focus to completing and adding new features and smaller content additions. Some of these will come in small updates following the big one.

It starts off with pineapple, then comes along more pineapple, and then some more pineapple, and then the dry down smells a lot like pineapples, but this time mixed with body odor. 

I genuinely did not get the hype behind this absolute body odor of a fragrance

Overall: 0/10

Afnan Supremacy Collector‚Äôs Edition:

Ok so this one opens up as pineapple as well but its not just pineapple, you get citruses with it as well and it shines the most in its dry down, you get woody ambery mixed with oakmass and in a very good way

Overall: 6/10, its a good scent just not for me.
Performance: 8/10

Lattafa Khamrah Qahwa:

This one opens up like coffee mixed with cinnamon and other spices, then drys down into a sweet gourmand praline vanilla fragrance. 

In my opinion you could rock it not just in winter but say in summer you‚Äôre going to a nice place for dinner where you know its gonna be air conditioned, you could definitely rock it.

*‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt I tell you that the mayor is coming this morning?‚Äù*

*‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, Eulogio, we got you covered! Let‚Äôs enjoy breakfast before the kids stir!‚Äù*

I can‚Äôt wait to get started with the July installment of Daisaku Ikeda‚Äôs lecture on ‚ÄúThe Opening of the Eyes.‚Äù But let me take some time to quickly look at the June 20th World Tribune.

First comes an account of the Central Executive Conference: [10,000 Youth: At the Central Executive Committee Conference, a bold new focus is set toward January 2028](https://www.worldtribune.org/2025/99923/) that outlines the steps the SGI-USA is taking toward January 2, 2028.

Next, I want to point out the [touching experience](https://www.worldtribune.org/2025/99921/) of a member from La Mesa, CA, who walks us through his retirement after 50 years in the Navy, the passing of his wife Michiko, his steps in facing his grief, and the slow but steady development of his faith.

But let me park here, [Living With an Awareness of the Importance of the Heart](https://www.worldtribune.org/2025/99892/), a reprint of a speech Daisaku Ikeda gave in 1988. It speaks very deeply to me. He talks about ‚Äúthe ultimate message of Nichiren Daishonin‚Äôs writings.‚Äù It boils down to two points:

>The first essential message is to base ourselves on the Gohonzon. It is to make the foundation of our faith ‚Äúonly Nam-myoho-renge-kyo‚Äù (WND-1, p. 903)‚Äîthat is, to sincerely chant and practice the Mystic Law alone. 

>The second essential message is that ‚Äúit is the heart that is important‚Äù (WND-1, 1000). These two points‚Ä¶ are the crucial cornerstones of the Daishonin‚Äôs writings. 

Why is the second one so important?

>Faith is not just a matter of embracing the Gohonzon and chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo but also a matter of our hearts, or the attitude with which we practice. Are our hearts directed toward kosen-rufu? The innermost heart, the attitude in the depths of our beings, determines everything.

Sidebar: maybe this is why some of the posters at r/sgiwhistleblowers claim they didn‚Äôt receive what they sought from their prayers. Many of the posts exude ugliness, jealousy, and dehumanization. As I shall explain in a bit, I observe those qualities in myself. My human revolution lies in fighting against those tendencies. But if a member is unwilling to make those efforts, how can their prayers be realized?

Dr. Ikeda continues:

>Whether we become happy, attain enlightenment, move in the direction of Buddhahood or wind up in a state of suffering‚Äîeverything is the exact result of the wondrous workings of our hearts or minds. This point cannot be overemphasized.

How am I doing on this matrix? As I mentioned above, today we are cutting the ribbon to the new Dewey House. The Twinettes are so excited! Because of my sordid past, I‚Äôve decided it is best to distance myself from the daily operations of the Longhouse Schools. But I support logistically to the very best of my abilities. And now it‚Äôs time to order furniture, equipment, and supplies for the extension and our new First and Second Grade classrooms. This Artie and I will do with all of the love in our hearts for the children and the school‚Äôs mission.

In my bachelor‚Äôs program, I had chartered a concentration of study to lead toward counseling. But with the course I am taking now, I am seeing that I don‚Äôt deal well with all of the abstraction and theory. I am barely keeping up with my classemates and professor. My therapist believes that maybe my long history of substance abuse has damaged brain functioning. It‚Äôs up to me, he said, but maybe I should consider moving back toward Accounting. I think he is right and so I shall. A bit of honest reflection: one door slams shut, another opens. Two points for the home team. Julie CPA, here I come!

But now Daisaku Ikeda takes another direction:

>Selfishness, complaint, doubt, deviousness, conceit, arrogance and so forth are all causes of unhappiness for both ourselves and others. When we allow ourselves to be ruled by such negative attitudes, we are like a plane that has lost its direction in a heavy fog. We can see nothing clearly. The distinction between good and bad, right and wrong, becomes blurred. 

>We plunge not only ourselves but our passengers‚Äîour friends and others around us‚Äîinto misery. When afflicted by arrogance, our minds run amok, like a crazed horse galloping wildly in circles, unable to stop, until we lose all self-awareness and do harm to those around us. This is not a normal human state.

How much my partners love and support me when I go through all of my highs and lows, extreme needs, and unpredictability. I have always looked at this condition as the depth or center of my life‚Äîand do my best to accommodate and win over them. But maybe I give far too much attention to my ‚Äúselfishness, complaint, doubt, deviousness, conceit, arrogance and so forth‚Äù thereby empowering them!

Instead I need to walk up a flight of stairs and bet my life on a different algorithm. And here is where I found my answer:

>In contrast, a sincere concern for others, a dedicated commitment to our beliefs, a sense of responsibility toward fulfilling our mission for kosen-rufu, a wish to wholeheartedly encourage and support our fellow members, a feeling of appreciation, gratitude and joy‚Äîthese attitudes are causes that will produce boundless good fortune, not only for ourselves but also for our family and loved ones as well as our descendants. 

>They give rise to strong protection by the heavenly deities‚Äîthe positive forces of the universe‚Äîand enable us to advance directly along the path to attaining Buddhahood. 

Seriously, I can do this! No big deal!

To conclude, Daisaku Ikeda advises:

>Let us therefore live with the Daishonin‚Äôs words ‚ÄúIt is the heart that is important‚Äù engraved deeply and indelibly in our lives.

From the standpoint of this guidance, Eulogio‚Äôs differences are immaterial. He grasps and lives by ‚ÄúIt is the heart that is important‚Äù and thereby cuts ribbons, moves the universe‚Äîand figures out how to cut the costs of physical education at the Longhouse Elem in roughly half!

**Ursula Lindberg, employee of the Federnet Research Agency, Earth, Human-Arxur Republic, New Terran Calendar 14-Huitzilopochtli-36 (Old Human Calendar: 20 October 2048)**



In the course of the last month, I started settling into the office routine: see the daily list of targets, compile a profile, raise and repeat. I must be getting good at it, because slowly but surely Diego and Alkimos have let me do my first actions: plant a meme here, start a gossip there, monitor the reactions and then inflame them. Watching the feds in their little social networks feels like observing an anthill, while a magnifying glass is slowly raising the temperature.

All in all, for a place with such a secretive nature, the job itself was incredibly mundane at times. So when our team leader, Lan, passed by the break room to ask us to come to her office when we finished our coffee, we were somewhere between excited and slightly worried.

And that‚Äôs why I am here waiting for her to get back to her office, while Neo stares us down from the poster on the wall.

‚ÄúSorry to keep you waiting, something came up.‚Äù She then pauses, smiles slightly and continues: ‚ÄúI guess you were wondering why I asked you to come. So, the Director was positively impressed with this team‚Äôs work on the Cradle and, with the upcoming regional elections, wanted to give you a delicate job.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe wants us to shake the water a bit and make the electorate a bit more frightful than usual?‚Äù tries Diego.

‚ÄúActually no, another team will deal with that. You are going to make sure that Sippit, one of the candidates for the Southern Orchard region, wins the election. Post or hype feel-good stories about it, squash all bad press, find and spread rumours about its opponent‚Ä¶and if you can‚Äôt find anything, create a scandal‚Äù. After a quick sip from a glass of water, she continues: ‚ÄúNow I can‚Äôt stress enough how delicate and surgical this needs to be. Our fingerprints or pawprints can‚Äôt be seen anywhere, ok?‚Äù

We all nod and she continues: ‚ÄúAnd one last warning: if you notice any allegations, no matter how tiny, about it being a Black Star or alleging some connection to us, you contact me immediately, ok?‚Äù After a long look at us that clearly means don‚Äôt screw this up guys, she concludes by asking if we have any questions or doubts. Alkimos then inquires if we are going to receive a full report on Sippit and the general situation in the area. She tells him that they are already included in the assignment folders, and if we need further intel, to submit a request to her.

Since none of us has other questions, she dismisses us and we return to our office. The next few hours move quickly between consulting the files, familiarising with the area, and elaborating a strategy for the campaign. We don‚Äôt have a lot of profiles targeted to that area, so in the next few weeks, we will have to work overtime to make new ones that can withstand scrutiny.

It‚Äôs already dark when we decide to call it a day. A soft snow is falling. I look at Alkimos and I smile with tenderness when I notice him raising his maw to the sky to feel the snow on his fur. We walk slowly on the quiet roads. He tells me about how much he misses Esquo‚Äôs arctic beauty, and I tell him about my childhood games in the snow back in Iceland. I‚Äôm pretty fond of him, but I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs the same for him. Maybe what I think is intimacy is just a cultural difference. After all, we belong to different species. Maybe he just wants a friend in a difficult time in a strange new world.

We are already in front of the Arxur broth bar where we are supposed to see Victoria and Aspis, when Alkimos stops in front of a lamppost and rises, standing on his back paws. Looking at me with his huge eyes, he begins shyly: ‚ÄúUrsula, for these last two months I really appreciated the time we‚Äôve spent together, and I can only admire your intelligence and kindness. And‚Ä¶ and I will totally understand if you don‚Äôt feel the same, and I will never make it awkward for you. But I‚Ä¶ I‚Ä¶‚Äù I interrupt his stammering, getting closer to him and rising to the tip of my toes to reach his height.

And for a moment, in this sad, angry galaxy, there is only us, the snow softly covering our heads and his tail slowly caressing my back.



**Victoria Vella Silva, student, Earth, Human-Arxur Republic, New Terran Calendar 14-Huitzilopochtli-36 (Old Human Calendar: 20 October 2048)**

The broth bar is in an old 19th-century building, right next to the Arxur Students Association. I pass through the wooden door, with its beautiful snake-shaped handle, and it takes a moment for my eyes to adjust to the dim interior. The floor is covered in red, yellow, and gold tiles forming complex geometric patterns. On one side of the room there‚Äôs an old-timey human bar counter; on the other, a series of widely spaced booths where patrons quietly prepare and sip their broth. The walls are decorated with photos of Wriss and Earth, hunting trophies, swords, and ancient verses by pre-Dominion poets.

I ask for Aspis at the counter and am told to go upstairs to room number four. I take a spiral staircase, its old steps covered by a soft red carpet to protect them from claw marks, and find myself in a corridor just barely lit‚Äîenough to keep us humans from bumping into furniture.

Before entering the room marked with a four in Wrissan numerals, I catch a glimpse of the room next to it, whose door is slightly ajar. It‚Äôs a sand room. I‚Äôve never seen one outside Wriss or the Capital. A place where an Arxur can meditate by drawing complex patterns in warm sand. It‚Äôs absurd how many traditions barely survived the Dominion‚Äîpreserved only through quiet family customs and a handful of surviving books.

After this brief moment of wonder, I enter the room reserved for us. It‚Äôs semi-circular, with a large table at the center and soft night light streaming in through a wide window on the far wall. The floor is covered in a mosaic of red, yellow, and gold tiles. It takes me a moment to realize it's meant to represent a sandstorm in one of Wriss‚Äô southern deserts. It must be even more impressive to an Arxur‚Äîafter all, they can see more shades of red than we do.Aspis greets me with a quiet bow and hands me a basket filled with tiny packets. After a moment of hesitation, I choose a Syasara broth and pass it to him without a word.

‚ÄúI would have thought you‚Äôd go for something fancier,‚Äù he says, amused.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not always that posh. And besides, it‚Äôs perfect for a quiet evening.‚Äù

He silently opens the packet and pours it into the cauldron gently bubbling on the warm plate at the center of the table, adding a few spices with practiced movements.After a moment of peaceful silence, he looks at me and says, ‚ÄúSince the others aren‚Äôt here yet, there‚Äôs something I‚Äôve been meaning to ask. Could you get me a pass to visit the Capital? I‚Äôd love to see the mosaics in the upper gallery.‚ÄùI sigh quietly. I hate these kinds of requests.‚ÄúYou know I can‚Äôt. The Capital and its location are a closely guarded secret for a reason. In case of war, it‚Äôll be the leaf-leackers first target. Besides, I‚Äôm sure you visited the Kedros ones that inspired the Arxur part and, as for the human part, if you want to see [byzantine mosaics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30x-iC3c5DA) you can just take a two-hour train ride‚Äù.

‚ÄúWell, I tried. I guess I‚Äôm envious of my cousin. He is an old tooth, but a the same time he can‚Äôt stop bragging that he saw the capital‚Äù,

‚ÄúThe type of old Dominion fan that would never put himself on a diet or renounce electricity to follow his ideals?‚Äù

‚ÄúPrecisely‚Äù. After a brief pause, he adds: ‚ÄúSo there is absolutely no chance?‚Äù with what I can only describe as the closest imitation an Arxur can pull of puppy eyes.

*Oh for goddess's sake. If this is how he wants to play‚Ä¶beware of what you wish Aspis.* ‚ÄúI guess that the next time I‚Äôm forced to go to the capital for some ceremony, I could add you as a plus one. But it‚Äôs going to be extremely boring, not to mention socially exhausting for an Arxur. And this without considering the security checks‚Ä¶‚Äù

Despite my best attempt to scare him away from the idea, his maw lights up like a Christmas tree. ‚ÄúThank you. Thank you. And I promise I can endure anything and everything‚Äù.

*Well, I warned you.* I gesture to him for a cup of broth and we sip in silence for a long time. After a while, he asks: ‚ÄúDid you hear that we allied with a prey species?‚Äù,

‚ÄúYou mean the Yotul Aristocracy? For me, the real news is that they finally made it public after four years. I have actually been to Lairn a couple of times, beautiful place and the inhabitants aren‚Äôt the usual meek herbivores. They have quite the martial tradition and a beautiful, vibrant culture. It‚Äôs fascinating how they are integrating their technology with ours really‚Äù.

He winces a bit a bit and growl: ‚ÄúLook, I‚Äôm not my cousin, but I seriously question the windstorm of trusting prey‚Äù,

‚ÄúI get that, but the feds already noticed them. And had they inglobated the Yotul we would have found ourselves with a permanent thorn in our side. Besides, at the end of the war, when Aafa, Talsk, Nishal and Grenelka are gone they would still widely outnumber us. We need to find a modus vivendi with them, ruling a scorched universe, like the Dominion wanted, would be such a waste‚Äù.

‚ÄúInteresting that you mention Nishal. Humans usually worry more about the Cradle.‚Äù‚ÄúThe Gojid?‚Äù I scoff, raising an eyebrow dismissively. He gives me a long look, tilting his maw slightly to the side.‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù‚ÄúYou really looked like her for a second, Medusa.‚Äù

With a sideways glance, I reply, ‚ÄúFor your information, my mother really hates that nickname.‚ÄùHe chuckles softly. Then his pupils flick toward the window and, breaking into open laughter, says: ‚ÄúLooks like someone‚Äôs ahead of us when it comes to interspecies cooperation.‚ÄùI follow his gaze and spot Ursula and Alkimos happily making out under a lamppost, just before they lose their balance and unceremoniously fall into the snow. We exchange a glance and break into uncontrollable laughter.

We have barely recovered, when the two join in and Aspis ask them how was the snow. Ursula becomes completely red and Alkimos flicks his tails awkwardly. We have a second laugh at their expense while commenting about the quality of the view.  
  
To save them, since Ursula seems about to hide in her cup, I ask them about their plans for the upcoming Fall memorial holiday. Ursula says that she going to Scotland, apparently her parents were doing the West Highland Way when the Federation attacked and ended up stuck in a small Scottish town for months afterwards. So they try to visit every year, and they are seen as honorary members of the community. Alkimos tells us that for him it reminds a bit too much what happened to Esquo so he just going to spend a few quiet days up in the mountains. He then asks what I plan to do.

‚ÄúAlessandro \[Achille ed.\] invited me to see the fireworks. I've actually never been to a public festivity, I‚Äôm usually stuck in some official ceremony. It‚Äôll be a nice change‚Äù,

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand how you guys can celebrate something like that‚Äù.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a generational thing. Our parents see it similarly. But for us is a way to shout to them you haven‚Äôt broken us, we are coming for you‚Äù interjects Ursula, and Aspis continues: ‚ÄúAlso for us Arxur, it‚Äôs the day we stopped being alone in a cold universe. The day we found our brothers in arms‚Äù.

The chit-chat went on for most of the night, until they basically kicked us out. And for once in our little corner of this troubled galaxy, there was peace.

1ltsmny,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_OilConscious2713/comments/1ltsmny/best_things_to_do_in_the_maldives/,Best Things to Do in the Maldives,"The Maldives ‚Äî just the name alone conjures images of crystal-clear turquoise waters, swaying palms, and white sand that melts between your toes. But this island nation is much more than a pretty postcard. Whether you're planning your honeymoon, a luxury getaway, or a peaceful solo retreat, the Maldives is filled with experiences that feel both magical and deeply personal.

If you‚Äôre wondering how best to spend your time in this paradise, here‚Äôs a warm and friendly guide to the **best things to do in the Maldives**, designed to help you make the most of every blissful moment.

# 1. Snorkelling and Diving with Marine Life

You don‚Äôt have to be a pro to enjoy the underwater wonders of the Maldives. Snorkelling is one of the easiest and most rewarding activities ‚Äî many resorts provide complimentary gear, and you can simply wade into the water from the beach or your villa. Expect to see parrotfish, turtles, eagle rays, and the occasional reef shark.

For those looking to go deeper, diving opens up another world. The Maldives is home to stunning coral reefs, caves, and overhangs. Dive sites like Maaya Thila and Banana Reef are especially popular. Even first-time divers can join PADI courses offered right at many resorts.

# 2. Stay in an Overwater Villa

If there‚Äôs one experience that defines a trip to the Maldives, it‚Äôs staying in an overwater villa. Waking up to endless views of the ocean, enjoying your morning coffee with the sound of the waves below, and diving straight into the water from your private deck ‚Äî it‚Äôs peaceful, luxurious, and truly unforgettable.

# 3. Explore the Beauty of a Private Island Resort

The Maldives is dotted with luxurious, self-contained resorts set on their own islands ‚Äî and staying at a [private island resort in Maldives](https://theozencollection.com/maadhoo) is something truly special. With only guests and staff on the island, it feels like you have your own slice of paradise. These resorts offer unmatched privacy, tailored experiences, and some of the most breathtaking natural settings in the world.

# 4. Island Hopping Adventures

There are over 1,000 islands scattered across the Maldives, each with its own charm. Many resorts offer half-day or full-day island hopping tours. You can visit uninhabited islands for a picnic or stop by a local island to meet residents and learn about everyday Maldivian life. It's a great way to experience the contrast between polished resorts and authentic island culture.

# 5. Sunset Cruises & Dolphin Spotting

Watching the sun set over the Indian Ocean from a traditional [Maldivian dhoni ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhoni_(fishing_vessel))

is a moment to treasure. Some cruises even include champagne and canap√©s ‚Äî perfect for a romantic evening. If you're lucky, you might spot spinner dolphins dancing through the waves. South Ari and Baa Atoll are particularly good for dolphin watching.

# 6. Water Sports for All Moods

Whether you're after calm or a bit of adrenaline, the Maldives delivers. You can glide through clear waters on a paddleboard or kayak, or pick up the pace with jet skiing, windsurfing, or wakeboarding. Most resorts have water sports centres, with friendly instructors who can guide beginners or help more experienced guests try something new.

# 7. Enjoy a Private Sandbank Picnic

Imagine being dropped off on a tiny sandbank surrounded by nothing but sea and sky. Resorts often organise private picnics where you're left with a beautifully packed basket, cool drinks, and a shade umbrella. It's peaceful, romantic, and completely unique ‚Äî ideal for proposals, anniversaries, or just an extra special lunch.

# 8. Relax with Spa and Wellness Therapies

You‚Äôll find world-class spas in nearly every Maldivian resort, many of them built over water or tucked into jungle settings. Signature massages, facials, and wellness rituals often use local ingredients like coconut oil and sea salt. Some resorts offer yoga and meditation with sunrise views, giving you the chance to reset both body and mind.

# 9. Visit a Local Island

To experience the real heartbeat of the Maldives, take a guided visit to a local inhabited island. Places like Maafushi or Thulusdhoo offer colourful streets, friendly locals, and small shops and caf√©s. It‚Äôs a great opportunity to learn about Maldivian culture and daily life, beyond the luxurious resort bubble.

# 10. Dine in an Underwater Restaurant

Few dining experiences in the world compare to eating beneath the ocean‚Äôs surface. An [underwater restaurant in the Maldives](https://theozencollection.com/maadhoo/dining/m6m-minus-six-meters)

 offers panoramic views of marine life while you enjoy fine cuisine. Watch stingrays glide past and schools of fish swirl around you as you savour every bite. It‚Äôs not just a meal ‚Äî it‚Äôs a memory in the making.

# 11. Try Traditional Night Fishing

Fancy catching your own dinner? Join a night fishing trip, a beloved Maldivian tradition. Using hand lines and bait, you'll fish under a blanket of stars, and in many cases, the resort chef will cook your catch for you the next day. It‚Äôs both peaceful and exciting ‚Äî and you‚Äôll leave with a great story to tell.

# 12. Visit a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve

The Baa Atoll Biosphere Reserve, a UNESCO-protected site, is a must for nature lovers. From May to November, it becomes a feeding ground for giant manta rays and whale sharks ‚Äî snorkelling in Hanifaru Bay is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. These experiences are carefully managed to ensure environmental protection.

**Final Thoughts**

The Maldives is more than just an idyllic beach destination ‚Äî it‚Äôs a place where every experience feels meaningful. Whether you‚Äôre floating in the ocean, dining under the sea, or simply soaking in the beauty of your surroundings, the Maldives has a way of making you feel like you‚Äôre exactly where you‚Äôre meant to be.

So whether you‚Äôre booking your first trip or returning for another round of paradise, let this list of the best things to do in the Maldives guide your journey. With every moment, the islands promise something extraordinary.",1,1751890621.0,u_OilConscious2713,0,1.0,False

On the line, there were no job titles, no departments. Just us workers, shoulder to shoulder, standing up for dignity and fairness.

We don‚Äôt need a physical line to carry that spirit forward. Solidarity doesn‚Äôt stop just because the airhorns and picket signs are packed away.

Here are a few ways to keep the fire burning:

- Wear your OCEU pin on camera in Teams meetings.
- Set your virtual background to an OCEU image.
- Add a line to your Teams status. Something like: ‚ÄúForever in solidarity‚Äù or ‚ÄúProud union member. OCEU strong.‚Äù
- Reach out to the folks you met on the line. Keep those cross-unit connections going.
- Organize or join a casual virtual hangout or coffee hour with your regional crew.

Stay involved. Stay connected. Stay vocal. Stay visible.

If you‚Äôre feeling like something‚Äôs missing, it‚Äôs not just you. We didn‚Äôt get a proper debrief. No last huddle. If your regional line wants to come together for a union-member-only gathering, do it.

Oh, and if management brings this up, and you‚Äôre really not in the mood, you can always say something to the effect of:

‚ÄúI‚Äôm proud of our collective sacrifice and what we stood for, but I won‚Äôt be discussing it in this setting.‚Äù

**""Their Exclusive Sweetheart""**

Y'all, I thought I was getting simple campus romance but this book said ""let me give you the most dramatic overreaction to an accidental kiss EVER"" and delivered pure entertainment gold!

**The premise:**¬†Ella accidentally kisses Alexander (one of the untouchable TVU Five princes) and gets MOBBED by his fangirls. Just when she's about to get destroyed, the five guys show up and declare her their ""personal maid"" to protect her. Now she's stuck serving five gorgeous billionaire heirs while trying not to fall for any of them! The chaos is UNMATCHED! üíÄ

**Why I'm completely LIVING for this:**

* The fangirls treating an accidental kiss like ""ABSOLUTE UNFORGIVABLE TREASON"" - the DRAMA
* Beckett casually announcing ""she's our maid now"" like he's ordering coffee
* 50 chapters with 4.5 rating of pure reverse harem chaos
* Ella's ""why did it have to be the one guy with a fan club AND hit squad"" energy
* The way they step out of that limo like a perfume commercial - ICONIC
* Alexander having a sister complex explaining why he doesn't date anyone

**What's sending me into ORBIT:**

* ""You're not even in the same zip code as his league!"" - OUCH but accurate
* Ella working multiple jobs while her stepsister gets driven to school in luxury
* The mob going from ""GET HER"" to ""Good morning, young masters!"" in 0.2 seconds
* Beckett calling her a ""walking-talking porcupine"" and ""tiny hedgehog with attitude""
* Dexter not even looking up from his game during the entire dramatic rescue
* The salary offer making Ella's brain short-circuit mid-protest

**The character dynamics are PERFECT:**

* Alexander: Brooding volcano with sister complex
* Beckett: Playboy with a heart who orchestrated this whole thing
* Caelan: Gentle mysterious prince who messes with her hair
* Dexter: Gaming genius who's emotionally unavailable
* Emmett: Sunshine boy who's actually her real friend

FF really said ""let me write the most entertaining reverse harem setup ever"" and I'm already planning my entire week around this beautiful chaos!
