Curious how you read the situation

Still can’t tell if I am imagining this, or if it was real.

This has been stuck in my head for a long time and I’m trying to sort out if I’m reading too much into it.

There was a girl I used to see all the time at my gym. We’d talk pretty often—not just surface level stuff. She’d tell me about her life, school, and places she liked. It felt natural, not forced.

Right before the semester ended, I finally asked her out for coffee. She said she was really busy with exams and packing to leave. When I asked, her face turned red and she got visibly flustered. I gave her my number and she said she’d text me later. She never did.

Here’s the part that keeps looping in my head.

A couple weeks later, I was walking down the street and didn’t even notice her walking past me. I was looking down. She and her friend passed me. Then, after we were already well past each other, she turned around.

She didn’t just look back.

She bit her finger and smiled.

Her friend turned around and looked back too.

That one small moment has lived in my head ever since.

Years later, I found out she dated a guy who looks oddly similar to me in some ways—not identical—just enough that it made me stop and think.

And more recently, she popped up under “people you may know” on Snapchat even though I don’t have her contact.

I’m not trying to make this into something it wasn’t. I’m genuinely asking: did I miss something real, or does your brain build meaning out of unresolved moments?

Has anyone else had something like this stick with them?",1,1765681979.0,AskGirls,0,1.0,False

I'm a 38M poly + pan walking contradiction, and I'm okay with that. I'm simultaneously too goofy for most situations and a head-in-the-clouds armchair philosopher.

My primary focus is my family, but love opportunities to learn more about other people and myself along the way. 

My interests are also all over the place. I enjoy fitness, primarily jogging and short hikes. I love music; currently working through some refreshers on more girlie pop artists but Spotify says I'm more ""indie punk."" I also enjoy poetry and philosophy, alongside mainstream movies and old video games. I'm generally nerdy about a little bit of everything, and connect well with people that carry a lot of passion in their personal interests. Tell me about your current obsession.

I'm looking primarily for close friends and seeing what happens from there. I'm generally a passionate person in most realms, so I'm typically a bit doting and a terrible flirt toward people I enjoy.

Before ordering, I already knew I wasn’t that hungry, so I kept it simple. I ordered one main dish and water. No appetizers, no drinks, no dessert.

Everyone else ordered cocktails, extra sides, and shared appetizers. A couple people even ordered dessert and coffee at the end.

When the bill came, it was pretty high. One of my friends immediately said, “Let’s just split it evenly, it’s easier.”

I looked at the receipt and noticed my portion was significantly less than everyone else’s. I said I’d rather just pay for what I ordered, or at least split the shared items separately.

That didn’t go over well.

They said splitting evenly is just “what you do” in groups and that I was being difficult and cheap over a small difference. One person even said it was embarrassing to nickel-and-dime friends.

I wasn’t trying to make a scene, I just didn’t think it was fair for me to subsidize everyone else’s drinks and extras when I was intentionally keeping my order small.

Things got awkward and I ended up paying only my share, but the vibe was off the rest of the night.

Now I’m wondering if I should’ve just sucked it up to keep the peace.

However we were just about the only people in the whole park. 

We then walked over to Kiener Plaza. It was full of people. The ice rink was full. The lodge tent had karaoke. People were taking photos at the different photo ops they have setup. It was so full of life. 

We had to walk around the Peabody building to get from City Garden to Kiener. The plaza was dark and uninviting. That building isn't supposed to be there and it completely ruining the cohesiveness of the green spaces downtown. Taking a stroll through City Garden and Kiener was a great time but I don't think most of the people at Kiener even knew that City Garden is there only a block away. 

With all the other work done downtown to improve foot traffic and add attractions to bring people to the city, removing that building would link the Arch to the civil courts building like originally intended and create a fluid greenspace that could be more easily enjoyed without having to walk through the dark Peabody plaza.

## Part One: The Wreck

The distress beacon was three days old by the time Jamal Kotto's salvage ship, the *Hyena*, picked it up. In the salvage business, three days might as well be three weeks—anything worth taking would already be gone, stripped by faster ships with better equipment and fewer scruples. But Jamal had learned a long time ago that the jackals who arrived first weren't always the ones who made the best profit. Sometimes the real prizes were the things other salvagers missed or couldn't carry or didn't understand the value of.

Besides, this particular wreck was on Ganymede, and Ganymede had complications.

""It's a passenger liner,"" said Zhen, his navigator and occasional conscience. She was studying the beacon data on her screen, her face lit blue by the display. ""The *Pride of Europa*. Three hundred and forty-seven souls aboard when it went down.""

""When it crashed, you mean.""

""When it crashed,"" Zhen corrected. She didn't look at him. They'd been working together for six years and she knew when he was being pedantic to avoid thinking about dead passengers. ""Looks like a propulsion failure. They tried to make an emergency landing but the hull breached on impact. Atmosphere loss was catastrophic.""

""Survivors?""

""Beacon says seventeen. But that was three days ago.""

Jamal nodded slowly. Seventeen survivors on Ganymede three days ago meant maybe five survivors now, if they were lucky. Ganymede's thin atmosphere wouldn't kill you immediately, but the cold would. And the radiation. And the native life, if you were unlucky enough to encounter it.

""How many other salvage ships have responded?""

Zhen pulled up the traffic logs. ""Four that we know of. The *Caracal* got there first, then the *Vulture*, then two independents we don't have IDs for. All of them logged departure approximately twelve hours after arrival.""

""Quick job.""

""Or a picked-over job.""

""Either way, we're going to take a look."" Jamal keyed the nav computer. ""Set course for the crash site. And Zhen? Prep the cold weather gear. If there are survivors, we're bringing them home.""

Zhen finally looked at him, her expression unreadable. ""Since when do we do rescue work?""

""Since I decided we're not complete assholes. Log it as a humanitarian effort. The Coalition pays bounties for survivor recovery.""

""The Coalition pays bounties for a lot of things. Doesn't mean we usually go after them.""

""This time we do.""

Zhen didn't argue further. She knew that tone. Jamal was going to do what Jamal was going to do, and she could either help or get out of the way. She'd spent six years deciding to help.

The *Hyena* began its approach to Ganymede three hours later.

---

The *Pride of Europa* had come down hard in the northern highlands, a region of ancient ice and younger canyons where Ganymede's geological past was written in layers of water and rock. The crash site was visible from orbit: a long scar in the ice where the liner had skipped and tumbled, ending in a debris field that stretched for nearly a kilometer.

""Jesus,"" Zhen muttered as they descended. ""They must have been coming in hot.""

""Too hot for controlled descent. Looks like they lost attitude control completely."" Jamal studied the wreckage through the viewport. The liner had broken into three main sections, each surrounded by smaller debris—hull plating, cargo containers, personal effects scattered across the ice like offerings to gods who didn't care. ""Any life signs?""

Zhen checked her sensors. ""I'm picking up something. Could be survivors, could be residual power from the ship's systems. Hard to tell with all the metal.""

They set down half a kilometer from the main wreck, close enough to reach on foot but far enough to avoid any unstable structures. The *Hyena* wasn't equipped for rescue operations—it was a salvage vessel, built for hauling cargo and staying in orbit while work crews went surface-side—but it had the basics. Pressure suits. Emergency medical supplies. A shuttle that could carry twenty people if they didn't mind being uncomfortable.

Jamal and Zhen suited up in silence. The ritual was familiar: check seals, check oxygen, check communications, check weapons. The weapons weren't for the wreck—they were for what you might find around a wreck. Ganymede had native life, and while it wasn't intelligent in any way humans would recognize, it was opportunistic. Bodies attracted scavengers. Scavengers attracted predators. And predators didn't care if you were a corpse or just looked like one in a pressure suit.

""Remember,"" Jamal said as they cycled through the airlock, ""we're looking for survivors first, salvage second. Anything valuable we can carry, we take. Anything too big or too dangerous, we mark for a second trip.""

""And if we find other salvagers still working the site?""

""We share. Professional courtesy. The wreck's big enough for everyone.""

Zhen nodded, but her hand stayed near her weapon. Professional courtesy was fine in theory. In practice, salvagers could be territorial, especially when a wreck was this fresh.

They crossed the ice field in long, bounding strides, Ganymede's low gravity making each step a controlled fall. The sun was a dim point overhead, Jupiter's bulk dominating half the sky, its bands of color muted in the thin atmosphere. Beautiful, if you liked desolation.

The main section of the *Pride of Europa* had come to rest against a low ridge, its hull crumpled like paper. Jamal could see where other salvagers had already been—cut marks on the hull, boot prints in the frost, the telltale signs of forced entry. But the salvagers were gone now, and whatever they'd taken, they hadn't taken everything.

""Life signs are coming from the aft section,"" Zhen reported. ""Looks like part of the environmental system is still functioning. If anyone's alive, they're in there.""

They found the entrance the previous salvagers had cut: a rough hole in the hull, edges still warm from the torch. Jamal went through first, his light cutting through the darkness of the passenger deck.

The interior was a nightmare of twisted metal and frozen bodies. The passengers had died quickly when the hull breached—violent decompression didn't leave much time for suffering. Small mercy. Jamal had seen enough wreck victims to know that quick was better than slow.

""This way,"" Zhen said, following her scanner. They moved deeper into the ship, past the passenger cabins and through what had been the dining area. Someone had already been through here—personal items were scattered, anything valuable removed. But the bodies remained. Other salvagers took cargo and equipment. Jamal and Zhen had a rule: they didn't loot corpses.

The life signs were coming from a sealed section near the rear of the ship. As they approached, Jamal could see that the door had been reinforced from the inside—metal plating welded over the entrance, a makeshift airlock created from emergency supplies.

""Smart,"" Zhen said. ""They sealed themselves in when the hull breached. Probably saved their lives.""

Jamal knocked on the door. Three times. Pause. Three times again. The universal signal for friendly contact.

For a long moment, nothing. Then a voice, weak and distorted by a helmet radio: ""Who's there?""

""Salvage crew from the *Hyena*. We're here to help. How many survivors?""

Another pause. Then: ""Five. We need medical attention. Radiation exposure. Frostbite. One of us is—"" The voice broke. ""One of us is dying.""

""We're going to get you out. Stand back from the door.""

It took twenty minutes to cut through the reinforced entrance. When the makeshift airlock finally opened, Jamal found himself looking at five people in various stages of dying. They were wearing passenger-grade pressure suits—adequate for short-term emergency use, useless for extended survival. Their faces were visible through the helmets: young, old, terrified, exhausted.

The one who had spoken was a woman in her forties, her face gaunt with dehydration and cold. ""Are you really here to help? Or are you just another salvage crew looking for cargo?""

""We're here to help,"" Jamal said. ""But we're also a salvage crew. Those things aren't mutually exclusive.""

The woman laughed, a bitter sound. ""At least you're honest.""

---

Getting the survivors back to the *Hyena* took another hour. One of them—a teenage boy—couldn't walk, his legs too frostbitten to support his weight. Jamal carried him in a fireman's carry, the boy's weight barely noticeable in Ganymede's low gravity but awkward in the pressure suit.

Once aboard, Zhen got to work with the medical supplies. She wasn't a doctor, but she'd had enough emergency training to keep people alive until they could reach a proper facility. IV fluids for the dehydrated ones. Warming blankets for the hypothermia. Radiation meds for everyone. The dying one—an elderly man with lungs full of frozen blood—she made comfortable and administered enough painkillers to make his last hours peaceful.

The woman who had spoken to Jamal turned out to be named Dr. Helena Voss, a xenobiologist who had been traveling to Europa's research station when the *Pride of Europa* went down. She sat in the *Hyena*'s galley, wrapped in a thermal blanket, sipping coffee that she held with shaking hands.

""Thank you,"" she said when Jamal joined her. ""For coming back. For not leaving us.""

""Coalition pays bounties for survivor recovery.""

""Is that the only reason?""

Jamal considered lying. Decided against it. ""No. But it helps justify the fuel costs.""

Dr. Voss smiled faintly. ""How much of a bounty?""

""Ten thousand per survivor. Plus reimbursement for medical supplies and transport.""

""So you're making fifty thousand off us. Sixty, if Mr. Chen survives the night.""

""Forty,"" Jamal corrected. ""Mr. Chen won't make it, and I'm not ghoulish enough to keep him alive artificially just to claim the bounty.""

""That's decent of you.""

""It's pragmatic. The Coalition checks. If they think you're gaming the system, they stop paying.""

They sat in silence for a moment. Then Dr. Voss said, ""The other salvage crews. The ones who came before you. They didn't even check for survivors. They cut into the ship, took what they wanted, and left. We could hear them through the hull. We banged on the walls, screamed, used every emergency signal we had. They ignored us.""

""I'm sorry.""

""Don't apologize for other people's cruelty. Just—"" She looked at him, her eyes red with exhaustion and grief. ""Just tell me you're different.""

""I'm different,"" Jamal said. ""But not by much. I came for the survivors because the Coalition pays. I'm staying for the salvage because that's my job. Don't make me into a hero. I'm just a jackal who showed up late to the kill.""

""A jackal who saves lives.""

""A jackal who gets paid to save lives. There's a difference.""

---

They spent the next two days working the wreck. The other salvagers had taken the obvious prizes—cargo containers full of trade goods, the ship's computer core, anything that could be quickly removed and easily sold. But Jamal had spent twenty years in the salvage business, and he knew that the obvious prizes weren't always the most valuable.

He found a data archive in the captain's quarters—personal logs, passenger manifests, potentially embarrassing or valuable information about the liner's final voyage. Worth money to the right buyer, if only for blackmail purposes.

He found three crates of rare earth minerals in a hidden cargo bay, the kind of contraband that legitimate shipping companies pretended they never carried. Worth a fortune on the black market.

He found seventeen more bodies and no more survivors.

On the third day, as Jamal was preparing to leave, Dr. Voss came to him in the cargo bay where he was securing the last of the salvage.

""I want to hire you,"" she said without preamble.

Jamal looked up from the cargo netting he was adjusting. ""For what?""

""There's something in the wreck I need to retrieve. Something the other salvagers missed because they weren't looking for it. I'll pay you twenty thousand credits to get it.""

""What is it?""

""Research samples. Biological material from Europa. Irreplaceable.""

""Biological material."" Jamal straightened. ""From Europa.""

""Yes.""

""The same Europa that's under strict quarantine because of potential biohazards? That Europa?""

Dr. Voss's face tightened. ""The samples are completely contained. Triple-sealed canisters designed for transport. There's no danger.""

""Then why didn't you mention them when we first picked you up?""

""Because I wasn't sure you'd understand their value. I wasn't sure you'd risk going back for them. I wasn't sure—"" She stopped. Started again. ""I wasn't sure I could trust you.""

""And now you are?""

""Now I'm desperate. Those samples represent three years of research. If they're lost, if they freeze or if another salvage crew takes them without understanding what they are—"" She shook her head. ""I need them, Mr. Kotto. Name your price.""

Jamal considered. Twenty thousand credits was good money, but biological samples from a quarantined moon were the kind of thing that could get you arrested. Or worse. The Coalition took biohazard protocols seriously, and violators tended to disappear into detention facilities that officially didn't exist.

""Thirty thousand,"" he said. ""And you sign a document stating that you take full legal responsibility for the samples. Anything goes wrong, it's on you, not me.""

""Done.""

They shook hands. Jamal wondered if he was making a mistake. Probably. But thirty thousand credits would pay for a lot of fuel and a lot of mistakes.

---

The samples were in what remained of the research section, a sealed compartment that had survived the crash relatively intact. Dr. Voss guided them through the wreckage, her knowledge of the ship's layout making navigation easier.

""The canisters are in a reinforced vault,"" she explained as they moved through the twisted corridors. ""Triple-sealed, as I said. The outer seal is rated for hard vacuum, the middle seal for temperature extremes, the inner seal for biological containment. Even if the vault breached in the crash, the samples should be secure.""

""Should be,"" Jamal repeated.

""Will be. I designed the transport system myself.""

They reached the research section to find that someone had been there first. The vault door was open, the lock burned through with a cutting torch. Inside, the vault was empty.

Dr. Voss made a sound like she'd been punched in the stomach.

""Gone,"" she whispered. ""They're gone. Someone took them.""

Jamal examined the vault. Professional work. Clean cuts. No signs of struggle or hasty looting. Someone had known exactly what they were looking for and exactly how to get it.

""Who else knew about these samples?"" he asked.

""My research team. The shipping company. The Coalition oversight committee."" Dr. Voss was shaking. ""But none of them would—""

""Someone would. Someone did."" Jamal pulled up the logs from his helmet recorder, reviewing the footage from their first visit to the wreck. ""The *Caracal*. It was the first salvage ship on site. Twelve hours on the wreck before departure. Plenty of time to find a vault in the research section if they knew what they were looking for.""

""Can we track them?""

""Maybe. If they're still in the system. If they haven't already sold the samples."" Jamal made a decision he knew he'd probably regret. ""I'll put out some inquiries. See if anyone's heard of biological samples from Europa hitting the black market. But Dr. Voss? If we find them, if we recover them, my fee goes up.""

""How much?""

""Fifty thousand. Plus expenses. Plus you tell me exactly what's in those samples and why they're worth stealing.""

Dr. Voss looked at him for a long moment. Then she nodded.

I'm hoping someone can recommend a good illustrated book that goes over the different star classifications. It'd also be nice if it went into stelar evolution and the various life cycles of stars (supernovae, black dwarfs, white dwarfs, etc.). The ideal would be a coffee-table book that goes into a lot of detail with lots of beautiful full-color illustrations.

Fairly good Japanese ♡ LINE/Mixi2 ready.

5'11"" (180 cm) bear build — trimmed beard, thick arms, broad chest. Boyish smile under the beard.

About me:

* Cook cast-iron steaks here, okonomiyaki and oden when I’m in Japan
* Retro games (SNES co-op nights), spooky movies, history books at 2 a.m., perfect pour-over coffee
* Travel rhythm: long summers traveling, Midwest winters, always planning the next flight

What I want most:

I’ve loved deeply before, though I’ve never been married. I know how rare and precious that quiet, intense love is; the kind where every day we choose each other, support each other, and slowly build the exact life we both dream of.

That’s what I’m ready for now: one woman, one home (whether in Indiana or Japan), mornings making coffee together, evenings with your head on my chest, and decades of taking care of each other. I will always take the lead, but I lead with my whole heart.

You:

* Japanese (living anywhere)
* 23–46
* Looking for something serious that leads to living together forever
* Petite is a big plus (the height difference is perfect)
* Bonus if you like retro games, cooking together, or spooky movies

A little more about the woman I hope writes me:

You’re kind, thoughtful, and value loyalty above everything. You want a partner who listens on the hard days and celebrates the small wins with you. You dream of building a home filled with quiet rituals we create together — quiet mornings, shared meals, planning the next trip. You don’t need to be perfect; you just need to be ready to choose “us” every single day, the same way I will.

Reply with:

* One thing you’d love to do together on a lazy Sunday
* Where you are right now (city/prefecture in Japan, or US city)
* One question for me

First five thoughtful replies get a 60-second calm voice note (English or Japanese).

I’m patient and only looking for one person.

""Heard the Voss family found their long-lost daughter after ten years?""

""What about their adopted girl?""

""Not only that—there's words saying Voss daughter spent her heat cycle with the adopted one's fiancé!""

""Yikes. If I were the adopted one, I'd hightail it out of the Voss family ASAP.""

A striking young woman with long hair leaned against the window, massaging her throbbing forehead. She frowned. Weird—I've drunk a lot last night, but not enough to sleep for such a long time.

Listening to the gossip outside, she let out a bitter laugh.

Ten years ago, Clara Voss—the daughter of the noble Voss family from Alpha Prime—vanished in a starship crash. The Voss family was crushed. Later, they went to an orphanage on Wasteland Star and adopted a little girl who looked just like Clara, around the same age. They named her Iris Voss.

A decade later, Clara turned up. The Vosses were over the moon! They showered her with all the love she'd missed—splurging on her favorite clothes, jewelry, the latest holo-pads, and starfighters. They even made Iris move out of the princess tower.

All because Clara had gushed, ""Iris' room is so pretty!""

The Vosses spoiled Clara rotten—and Iris thought it was only fair. After all, she was just the adopted kid. Clara was the real heiress.

Iris moved out quietly, trying her hardest to be kind to Clara. But she never imagined her own fiancé would spend his heat cycle with Clara...

Shaking off the memories, Iris yawned lazily and turned to pack. It was time to leave the Vosses anyway.

Packing was easy—she had almost nothing to take. She wanted none of the Vosses' stuff.

Iris slipped into her Imperial University freshman uniform—white and blue, cuffs tucked into her black boots. She pulled her long hair into a ponytail and checked her reflection.

The only thing left was her holo-pad...

Her older brother, Nathan Voss, had given it to her for her birthday two years ago. Nathan had always been good to her. He was stationed on an alien planet overseeing energy resources and hadn't been home in six months. But Iris knew even this gentle brother would love his biological sister Clara more than her.

She planned to wipe the holo-pad's data and give it back to the Vosses.

Just as she was about to format it, a notification popped up, ""Central Core: Miss Iris Voss, your genetic matching marriage application has been received. Processing data... Running genetic comparison...""

Iris froze. The watch-shaped holo-pad slipped from her hand and clattered to the floor.

On Alpha Star, there were two ways to get married. Most people chose free love and marriage. The second was genetic matching: you applied, and the Central Core would compare your DNA with every eligible single on the planet. You'd automatically be matched with the person who fit best.

In short, you were asking the Central Core to assign you a husband or wife.

This second option was mostly obsolete. It was impersonal, caused tons of marital fights, and barely anyone used it anymore.

A cold glint flashed in Iris' eyes.

Who's accessed my holo-pad and sent the application?

She stormed out and called the robot butler, ""Who came into my room last night?""

The butler's electronic eyes darted around. Without wasting time, Iris accessed its central control system to pull up the surveillance footage from when she'd been drunk.

The records were deleted?

Heh. Recovering data was child's play for Iris.

Minutes later, the restored footage showed a sneaky figure slipping into her room. It was Clara!

And Iris made another shocking discovery—Clara had spiked her drink last night...

The Vosses' kitchen was huge. Most days, housekeeping robots cooked all the meals. But this morning, Clara—wearing a white dress and curly hair—stood by the stove in a pink apron, bustling around.

""Mom, my oatmeal might not be as good as the robot's,"" she said to Margaret Voss beside her.

Margaret, a soft-looking woman, smiled fondly, ""Anything my daughter makes is the best in the galaxy!""

Clara grinned. Before she could speak, heavy footsteps thundered over. She turned—and Iris slapped her hard across the face.

Clara clutched her cheek and burst into tears. ""Iris! Why'd you hit me?!""

Margaret's eyes turned red. She pulled Clara close and glared at Iris. ""Iris! What's wrong with you this morning? Why'd you hit Clara?""

""Ask your daughter what she did to my holo-pad,"" Iris snapped.

""No matter what she did, hitting her isn't okay!"" Margaret shot back.

Iris scoffed, ""What if she applied for a genetic matching marriage in my name?""

Margaret froze. She looked at her daughter, who started sobbing even harder.

""Mom, I didn't mean to! I just wanted to download some study materials from her holo-pad,"" Clara wailed. ""You know, Iris got into Imperial University. we're about the same age, but I never got to study properly 'cause I was lost as a kid... I just wanted to study hard for a year and apply next year.

""Iris was drunk and asleep last night. I didn't want to wake her, so I downloaded the stuff myself. I must've hit the wrong button and sent the application by accident! I really didn't mean it!""

Margaret's heart ached. Her daughter had suffered so much alone. Just thinking about it made her feel guilty.

She turned to Iris, frowning. ""Iris, Clara didn't do it on purpose. If you don't like the husband the Central Core picks, the Voss family will pay for your divorce.""

Iris stared at the woman who'd once been kind to her—treating her forced marriage like it was no big deal. A chill ran down her spine.

""Do you know what else she did last night? She snuck into the kitchen and spiked my drink. Then she snuck into my room and used my holo-pad to apply for the genetic match. Putting it all together, she just wants to kick me out of this family.""

Margaret looked shocked. ""No, that can't be...""

Iris' voice was calm. ""Believe it or not, I sent all the surveillance proof to your email.""

Margaret's eyes widened. She glanced at her weeping daughter, then hesitated. Finally, she said, ""Iris, Clara must've had her reasons. Can't you forgive her? She's been through so much! I raised you for ten years—didn't that teach you to be more forgiving?""

The words made Iris' heart go cold, but she stayed calm. ""Mrs. Voss, I haven't forgotten the ten years of care. You spent 168,000 Stellacreds on me—I'll pay every cent back.""

With that, she turned to leave.

Margaret realized what Iris had called her and froze. ""Iris... you're calling me Mrs. Voss? Are you cutting ties with us over this?""

Clara looked up, seeing the doubt and sadness in her mother's eyes. She wailed louder, ""It's all my fault! Iris is mad 'cause of me and Ethan! Take your anger out on me instead! Iris, the Voss family raised you for ten years—how can you be so heartless? It'll break Mom's heart!""

Iris turned back, and sure enough, Margaret's eyes were filled with tears. Like Iris was the bad guy all along.

Watching Clara's over-the-top performance, Iris suddenly realized: with Clara around, the Vosses would never have peace. Let them spoil her—she didn't care anymore.

Just then, her holo-pad beeped.

Iris looked down.

The marriage application has been approved?

She formatted the holo-pad on the spot and dropped it on the floor. Then she walked toward the door.

Margaret called out, upset, ""Iris! Where are you going?!""

Iris waved without looking back. ""I'm going to the Central Core Civil Registration Office to pick up my husband.""  

Chapter 2 Do You Like My Pheromones?

Alpha Star's Central Core stood dead center of the Alpha Prime.

Every aspect of daily life for the planet's residents got handled here—including marriage registrations.

Civil marriage services were tucked away on the 77th floor of the main tower, a quiet nod to Starfall Eve, the ancient love festival from Terra Prima that humans still honored in small, meaningful ways.

Iris took a free public shuttle to the Central Core, then scanned her iris to enter.

As soon as she stepped inside, a sleek, professional-looking guy in a silver uniform and glasses approached.

""Miss Iris Voss?"" he asked.

""That's me,"" she replied.

""Please follow me to the V... VIP lounge. Your match is already waiting.""

""Thanks, lead the way.""

Iris had zero interest in a blind marriage—this whole thing was a disaster, plain and simple. She hadn't sent that stupid genetic matching application; Clara had, out of her twisted need to get rid of her.

Plus, she was flat broke now that she'd cut ties with the Vosses. No fancy clothes, no family connections, nothing but the clothes on her back and a few personal items.

Chances were, her so-called ""match"" would take one look at her and run for the hills. And that was exactly what she wanted—if he refused the marriage, the whole thing would get canceled automatically, and she could move on with her life at Imperial University.

She followed the staff member through seemingly endless halls. Other people passed by, staring at her curiously. But when Iris met their gaze, they quickly looked away.

Iris frowned. Something felt off. But it was her first time getting married—maybe the stares were because she'd chosen genetic matching? After all, barely anyone used that option anymore.

""So, what's my match like?"" Iris asked the glasses guy.

He seemed nervous, pushing his glasses up instinctively. ""You'll see when you meet him.""

They stopped at a lounge door with a gold-engraved symbol. It looked familiar to Iris—like some kind of totem.

""Miss Voss, please go in. Your match is inside,"" the guy said respectfully.

Iris raised an eyebrow. ""Aren't you coming with me?""

He blinked, shaking his head. ""Marriage is private. You two should talk alone. If you need anything—coffee, water—just tell the service robot inside.""

Iris nodded. ""You've been great. Do you take ratings? I'd give you nine stars.""

The guy's expression turned weird. He forced a smile. ""Thanks. I'll take that if you're satisfied later.""

His words felt odd. And he was being way too respectful. Maybe he still thought she was the Voss family's heiress?

Iris shrugged it off, turning to push the door open.

The metal door closed softly behind her.

The lounge was bright, with floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking crisscrossing skyways. The decor screamed luxury—wine racks lined the walls, and the circular red sofa in the center was made of rare star beast leather, soft to the touch.

Then Iris smelled it—rich, woody cedar.

It was the smell of pheromones.

And there, sitting on the carpet by the window, was a stunning boy.

His features were delicate and sharp. Leaning against the wall, it was hard to tell his height, but his long legs suggested he was tall. He wore a simple white shirt and black pants, with intricate embroidery on the cuffs and waist—definitely high-end.

Silver-gray hair fell in messy bangs, framing eyes like glowing sapphire—deep as the cosmos. Those beautiful eyes were fixed on Iris, unblinking.

Behind him, several fluffy white tails swished gently.

The sight was breathtaking.

As Iris breathed in the thick pheromones, the room felt like it was heating up.

""Your pheromones smell nice,"" she said.

""Do you like them?""

His voice was low and slightly hoarse—like music from an ancient instrument, melodic and warm.

Iris' heart raced. But she forced herself to stay rational.

""I'm sorry, but I didn't send that marriage application. I'm here to talk. First, though—you should take an inhibitor.""

The boy's fluffy white fox ears twitched. He blinked slowly, confusion flickering in his eyes.

Clearly, his heat cycle was hitting hard—his consciousness was clouded by beastman instincts.

Iris stared at those fuzzy ears, her heart tingling like a cat was scratching at it.

Crap. His pheromones are working.

Fox beastmen's pheromones were more alluring than succubi's.

Iris cleared her throat, trying to calm down. ""Did you forget your inhibitor? I'll go find one for you.""

She turned to leave, moving as fast as she could without seeming rude. If she stayed any longer, she might do something stupid—like kiss him, or worse. Since her beastman awakening, Iris had never liked anyone's pheromones this much. Not even her ex-fiancé, Ethan Hale.

Ethan had always been the picture of a perfect gentleman—polite, respectful, never pushing her for more than she was ready for. He'd told her time and time again that he used inhibitors during his heat cycles, that he wanted to wait until they were married to be intimate.

Turns out, he'd been lying through his teeth. He'd spent his last heat cycle with Clara instead—her so-called ""sister"" who'd stolen her family, her fiancé, and now tried to ruin her life with a fake marriage application.

Huhh, that's men.

But this fox-eared boy? Everything about him clicked with her—his looks, his voice, that amazing cedar scent that made her feel safe and wanted all at once. He was way better than Ethan, in every single way.

But Iris clung to her last bit of sense. She'd come here to end a marriage, not start a new one. And taking advantage of someone during their heat cycle? That was low—lower than Clara, even. She'd never forgive herself if she did that.

Just as her hand touched the doorknob, the cedar scent exploded around her—thicker, more intense, wrapping around her like a vice and making her dizzy with desire.

""Iris, don't go...""

His voice was right behind her, soft and pleading, and his warm breath brushed against her ear. Iris' cheeks flushed bright pink, heat spreading down her neck and onto her shoulders.

It hurt more than I expected. Being unemployed right now doesn’t help. Birthdays hit harder when you already feel stuck. I felt dumb for hoping, then realized hoping isn’t dumb. Wanting clarity isn’t wrong either.

Amenti is dead.



15,000 years ago a train of sub-mile sized impactors - the Seven Suns - bombarded our planet.

The skies had been full of falling stars for decades, yet back then we still remembered what it means - besides beautiful views. We remembered. And we feared. And the fears turned out to be true.

The electroacoustic [trumpets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qG7qHtm5cM8) of [skyquakes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHi6LjKuNl4) announced each turn of punishment, one after the other beating the weakened humanity even further into oblivion. Some were separated by days, and others - by years. Just as humanity thought they have been lucky to survive and hoped to catch a breath.

Some say there were ten major impactors.

The first ones boiled oceans and poisoned rivers with acid fallout. Because of famine and wars, very few were alive by the time the seventh destroyer arrived. It committed the unthinkable - it pierced the heart and burned the mind of civilization. It melted Atlas, the pillar of heaven, and destroyed Amenti - the seed of humanity. The disunited, dispersed groups of humans on this planet no longer had any information about what was happening after that.

The Seventh came at night, like a thief, invisible against the background of space, hidden from radars by the cloud of smaller dust and pebbles - the shattered to pieces body of Tiamat. Until it became the Seventh Sun.

The Seventh Sun hit Richat like a sniper aiming for the head. It destroyed Atlas. It cracked the walls of the metal ellipsoid and flooded the titanic high-tech shelter with magma, burning everything inside. It took away humanity's memory, lobotomized civilization, left us debilitated, weakened, destroyed.

I have a few stories coming from the perspective of common people living in an alternative universe, which is just like Earth - but myths were real there. No magic. No aliens. Just a prehistoric Golden Age civilization.

The intent is to make it scientifically accurate and tied to our boring planet - so that you would look around and for a moment wonder if it could be real. (The answer is ""no"", by the way.)

In 200 years, this cycle will end. It may end badly - like it's happened before. Very badly.

Shelters will be unlocked. Closed. Reopened again in the new Earth.

The complex of subterranean cities around Derinkuyu can sustain a population of several hundred thousand, with its twenty levels down going all the way to the subterranean aquifer rivers. Soon it will start being cleaned and fitted with modern technology - computers, machinery, coffee makers.

All of Europe and Middle East is interconnected by tunnels. It has massive urban sprawl - just underground. It's not even a secret.

Amenti... The main shelter of the planet. Hundred feet tall ceilings. Nine major floors. A giant ellipsoid submerged in the Earth's crust to survive ANYTHING. Yet it didn't survive the direct impact. Amenti will never reopen.

15,000 years ago a train of sub-mile sized impactors - the Seven Suns - bombarded our planet.

The skies had been full of falling stars for decades, yet back then we still remembered what it means - besides beautiful views. We remembered. And we feared. And the fears turned out to be true.

The electroacoustic [trumpets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qG7qHtm5cM8) of [skyquakes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHi6LjKuNl4) announced each turn of punishment, one after the other beating the weakened humanity even further into oblivion. Some were separated by days, and others - by years. Just as humanity thought they have been lucky to survive and hoped to catch a breath.

Some say there were ten major impactors.

The first ones boiled oceans and poisoned rivers with acid fallout. Because of famine and wars, very few were alive by the time the seventh destroyer arrived. It committed the unthinkable - it pierced the heart and burned the mind of civilization. It melted Atlas, the pillar of heaven, and destroyed Amenti - the seed of humanity. The disunited, dispersed groups of humans on this planet no longer had any information about what was happening after that.

The Seventh came at night, like a thief, invisible against the background of space, hidden from radars by the cloud of smaller dust and pebbles - the shattered to pieces body of Tiamat. Until it became the Seventh Sun.

The Seventh Sun hit Richat like a sniper aiming for the head. It destroyed Atlas. It cracked the walls of the metal ellipsoid and flooded the titanic high-tech shelter with magma, burning everything inside. It took away humanity's memory, lobotomized civilization, left us debilitated, weakened, destroyed.

My work is giving $100 bonus Amazon Gift cards for 3 weeks in December due to a ton of mandatory overtime. 

If I get the max, it should be 300. The first week I did get the max and I predict I will continue to do so. 

I happen to be really broke right now. I haven’t bought a toy or fun item or gadget for myself in months. I am a single 52 year old man. I own a small home and have a dog. I collect guitars and have had to sell everything but one. I collect Blu Rays and have had to sell many. I collect vinyl records. I am set on a good phone and computer. I have security cams. I enjoy watching YouTube and I used to play video games but sold all my systems and now just have retro games set up on an emulator. I also had many books and graphic novels but sold
them all. I enjoy Star Trek, Star Wars, solar stuff (I have a small system of panels and batteries), keto cooking and coffee. 

What would you do with 300 credit at Amazon? There is no one I need to gift it to. Is there one large purchase that could be fun for someone like me, or should I leave it as a tab to slowly dwindle down with everyday small needs like doggie pads, coffee beans, underwear, etc?

What would you do? And is there an item that would be interesting?

TLDR; one big purchase or leave a tab to dwindle down with everyday purchases?",2,1765679124.0,makemychoice,7,1.0,False
1pm2u2q,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mistborn/comments/1pm2u2q/era_4/,Era 4,"The air in the trading cubicle was dry and smelled faintly of ozone and stale coffee. Kellen leaned closer to the five glowing monitors arranged in a semicircle around him, the main chart—a volatile 5-minute movement on the synthetic silver futures—pulsing a sickly green.

He pinched a small, dark pellet from the pillbox recessed into his console and slipped it beneath his tongue. **Atium.**

The metal burned, a quiet, icy flicker in his stomach, and the universe *cracked*.

Where the glowing green line of the chart had been, Kellen now saw an impossibly complex cascade of ethereal, grey-white projections. The main projection, the most likely future path, snaked upward for the next three minutes, then dipped sharply—a guaranteed window to sell and re-buy.

But the real problem wasn't the future; it was the noise.

""Damn it,"" Kellen muttered, rubbing his eyes. ""Too many Eyes on the field today.""

He could sense them, other traders in this enormous glass-and-steel Hive, each one a hungry Mistborn just like him, chasing the exact same arbitrage. With every one of them burning Atium, their individual projections overlapped and interfered. The future wasn't a clean line; it was a chaotic tapestry of possibilities, a field of **shadows** cast by hundreds of competing Allomantic visions. The main projection was fuzzy, constantly flickering as rival decisions nudged the true price line. It was like trying to navigate by a single candle in a room full of mirrors.

*Wait.* The main line was solidifying. Kellen saw the sharp, beautiful drop. *Now.*

His fingers flew across the keyboard, executing a short sell order, pushing ten million credits onto the line. He held his breath, the Atium burning hot and clean, tracking the future line.

*One minute... two minutes...*

The real chart dropped just as the projection promised, a perfect, crystalline move. Kellen bought back, netting a clean 1.2% profit, then slumped back in his chair. He spat out the spent Atium dross. It had only been a short flicker, but the sheer mental strain of resolving the signal from the shadows left his head pounding.

He looked back at the screen, but his eyes were too far gone. The fluorescents overhead had leached all the color and contrast from the world; the bright numbers swam in a painful haze. He didn't have time to rest—the next window was opening.

Kellen sighed, reached into his sleeve, and found the tiny shard of metal he needed. **Steel.**

He popped the shard into his mouth and burned.

Instantly, his vision shifted. The world around him faded into a muted grey, but the metal of his computer monitors, the wiring in the wall, and the keyboard beneath his fingers suddenly burst into life. Lines of brilliant, pulsating **blue** shot out from his eyes, converging on every metallic component.

He didn't need to *see* the pixels with his eyes. He could *feel* the arrangement of the monitor's circuitry and the flow of information across its metallic frame. The data streamed across his Allomantic vision, a complex, legible network of intersecting blue threads. The numbers were not bright lights; they were strong, geometric connections. With his actual eyelids closed against the fluorescent glare, Kellen read the entire market using only the perfect, restorative vision of a Steel-burner.

""Kellen, you're not leaving, are you?""

Kellen jumped, cutting his Steel-burn instantly. His boss, Mr. Corliss, stood in the cubicle entrance, his tie loosened, a predatory look in his eyes.

""The closing bell rang ten minutes ago, sir.""

""Yes, but the Asian markets are opening early on the copper indices. We need a strong hand to ride the first two hours. Can you stay?""

Kellen looked at the time. He had promised his wife he'd be home. But he also needed the bonus.

""I can, sir,"" Kellen said, already standing.

He walked quickly to the stairs. Down in the building's lobby, the janitorial service was already setting up for the night. Kellen bypassed the sleek, automated coffee machine and headed straight for the small, unmarked vendor cart hidden behind the main desk.

""Hey, Joe. The usual.""

Joe, a man with a tired smile, slid him a plain white mug. It wasn't coffee at all, not really. It was a potent, bitter brew infused with dissolved, strained **Pewter**. The **Pewter Coffee**.

Kellen paid, then tipped the whole mug back in one long, searing swallow.

The effect was instantaneous and glorious. A wave of physical energy—not just alertness, but raw, boundless *stamina*—roared through him. The aches in his back vanished. The residual headache from the Atium melted away. His senses sharpened, his hands steadied, and his mind felt like a well-oiled machine. He didn't just feel awake; he felt **solid**.

He tossed the empty mug into a waste bin and took the stairs two at a time, the overtime hours stretching ahead of him, not as a burden, but as a challenge his invigorated body was now eager to meet. With the Steel vision in reserve and the memory of the market's future still lingering, Kellen knew he wouldn't just trade copper tonight; he would *dominate* it.",0,1765679123.0,Mistborn,2,0.4,False

Posting on behalf of a friend who’s a lesbian and having zero luck on Bumble locally. She’s genuinely trying to meet people, go on dates, and see where things go — not just swipe forever — but it feels like she’s already hit the end of the app’s population for Guam.

So I’m curious: Where are women here actually meeting each other? Are people using Hinge, HER, Tinder, or something else entirely? Or is dating here mostly happening through friends, events, or social circles instead of apps?

She’s open to low-pressure stuff like coffee, walks, or casual hangs — just wants to meet new people in real life at some point.

Would love any recommendations, success stories, or honest insight into whether this is just how dating is here.

Does it get better?,"Very underwhelmed by the first mystery's writing and solution. It's disappointing because the premise, like most of these games, is strong, and I wasn't bothered by the minigames at all. I am about ready to drop it, but is it too early?

first mystery rant:

>!Using autonomous railcars as a mechanism for obfuscating the details of a murder is a somewhat interesting idea. I definitely think a clever murder mystery could have been created with this concept, but to me this first puzzle appears to be the product of someone who attempted to do just that and failed spectacularly.!<  
  
>!First and foremost, an adequate motive for framing you is never presented at the time. The notion that it is to cover up the crime for the Amaterasu corporation makes little to no sense because as Zange pointed out, there is nothing stopping a master detective from working with Amaterasu Corp. The fact is, 5 world class detectives died on their train, that shit looks bad and it is going to be investigated. !<  
  
>!Second, the framing itself requires a considerable amount of coincidences to occur to succeed. First, it is contingent on the fact that he is able to get 5 world class detectives to drink poisoned wine or coffee under fairly suspect circumstances. I guess that scrawny furry was prepared to throw hands with anyone that wasn't feeling particularly thirsty that day? Or what if they drink at very different times? Also, he sets his room on fire with perfect timing. I thought Yume sees when people are using superpowers? /s  Also, what if the defenseless detective doesn't feel compelled to fully explore a train that is guaranteed to have a mass murderer on it? !<

>!Third, the detective's deductive process hardly comes to any definite conclusion if it weren't for the fact that a literal god of death is able to verify the validity of what would otherwise be baseless conjecture. Flickering lights and a little bit of shaking on the train is hardly enough evidence to prove the convoluted car swapping maneuver (which is also the only clever part of this murder mystery). That maneuver also just didn't need to happen. Zilch is capable of fully operating the train. The writer could have easily just given him the ability to override the locks on the doors so that he can climb on top of the train and run over to the other side. !<

>!I'm sure there's more, but bottom line is the writing is weak af. I mean like, if I need to start considering whether or not a billion dollar mega corporation has constructed a little hinky dinky murder mystery to confuse me before they arrest me like when tf have we lost the plot? /end rant!<",1,1765678931.0,RainCode,7,0.57,False

The commencement speaker finishes his speech, and the master of ceremonies informs everyone they can turn their tassel to the left. I hugged my best friend, Brianna, and turned my tassel left. I look up in the stands and see my family and friends cheering and waving. My class exited to the lobby, and I spotted my family. I run into my mama’s open arms and step back to give her a good look. 
    

She has tears in her eyes. “Congratulations, baby girl. I can’t believe my babies are growing up.” She looks at all my siblings, and my dad comes up behind her and wraps her arms around her waist. 

He leans down and kisses her cheek. “We are a great team. I’m so very proud of you, Nadia.”


My dad unwraps his arms from my mom’s waist and gives me his special bear hug. Next in line is my brother Alex, who will graduate from Washington State next year. Alex wraps his arm around my shoulders. “I’m proud of you, sis. Sorry, the Seattle Storm deal didn’t work out.” 


Wrapping my arms around him, I say, “Thanks, it still stings, but things could be worse.”

Noelle is next, and then Seamus, Aniyah, and their children. We all walk towards the cars, and Aniyah hands Seamus Jr to my brother Alex, who walks by Seamus Sr. 


She leans into me. “I’m so proud of you, sis. I’m serious, Ms. Future pharmacist.”
With a smile, I give her a big hug. “Thank you for everything. If you ever need me to pay rent at the condo, I can.”


She shakes her head. “No. You can stay in the condo rent-free for however long you need. We want to make sure you have nothing to worry about.” We get to the car, and she looks around. “Don’t mean to worry you, but where is Nathan?”

I shrugged my shoulders. I can deal with Nathan later and determine why my boyfriend missed my graduation. 

My dad whistles, and we turn to him. “Everyone meets at Seamus and Aniyah’s for the party.”


Aniyah gives me one last hug before I get into the backseat of my parents’ SUV with my siblings. When we arrived, my sister had done a fantastic job decorating. As I looked around, I saw my friends and other family members starting to arrive. I tried to enjoy the party but kept looking at the door, waiting for Nathan to walk through. I walk over to the couch on the far side of the living room and open my unread texts. 

Brianna plopped beside me.“Hey girl, what’s up? You’ve been distant since graduation.”

I looked over at her. “Nathan didn’t come and won’t answer my texts.” 

She hugs me. “This is your day. Don’t let him bring you down. Down, you can worry about him tomorrow.”

“Easier said than done.” Glancing back at my text messages, I see he opened and read them.

Brianna grabs my phone. “That’s enough of the asshole today. We just graduated from college, and your sister organized an amazing party.”

She holds out her hand. I grab her hand, and she leads me back to the party. The party continued, and I almost forgot Nathan didn’t attend my graduation. The front door opens, and 

Nathan smiles with a bouquet in hand. 

He greets my family and friends before joining me at my side. He leans down and I give him my cheek, which doesn’t go unnoticed by Aniyah.

“If you could excuse us, I think I see one of my twins up to no good. It was nice for you to show up, Nathan.” She places her arm in the crook of Seamus’s elbow and walks away. 


I smile a little at the slight shade. I turned to Nathan. “Can we talk in private?”
I don’t give him a chance to respond before I pull him outside to the balcony. “Where were you?” 

He rolls his eyes, and it pisses me off further. “Work kept me late today, babe. I’m so sorry. I was with an important client, so I didn’t have time to text you.""

He stepped closer and leaned in, and I placed my hand on his chest to stop him. 

“You could have called or texted me this morning and told me you couldn’t come. I’m sure you weren’t with your client all day.” 

He sighs and runs his hands through his hair. “What more do you want me to say? I fucked up, and I can’t go back to change it. Please don’t make a bigger deal out of this.”

I take a deep breath to hold back tears, and he leans in and kisses me, and I allow him. He wraps his arms around my waist, deepens the kiss, and I lean closer. 

He breaks the kiss, kisses my neck, and whispers, “I’m sorry, baby, I am. Let’s go back to your place and let me show you how sorry I am.” 

I fake a smile. “I think there is something you can do to make it up.”

He smiles, takes my hand, and leads me back to the party. We continue to mingle, and I pretend everything is okay, but I can’t keep going through this cycle. The party winds down, and my family, Nathan, and I stay to help Seamus and Aniyah clean up.

Aniyah and I are cleaning the kitchen when she looks over my shoulder. “So why did Nathan miss your graduation and half of your party?”

I set the rag down on the island, leaned on it, and sigh. “He said it was because of work.”

Aniyah raises an eyebrow. “Do you believe him?”

I shrugged my shoulders. “Who knows what the truth is? I don’t think I honestly care about his excuses anymore.”

Aniyah reaches out and touches my hand. “Don’t stay in a relationship longer than you should. I don’t know everything happening in your relationship, but I can tell you this: Seamus wouldn’t dare miss my graduation and show up late to my party.”

I place my hand over hers. Before being with Seamus, she was in a toxic relationship, and now she’s concerned about me. I am sure my family would understand if I talked to them about my relationship, but I feel ashamed of the situation. My dad was always an excellent role model as a husband and father when I was young. It embarrasses me to think I stayed with Nathan, the opposite of my father. Nathan comes into the kitchen and wraps his arms around my waist.

I school my expression and smile. “I think it’s time for us to leave. Thank you, Aniyah, for the party. I’ll text you later.” 

She weakly smiles at me as Nathan guides me to his car and opens the door for me. It’s a short car ride back to my condo and an even shorter elevator ride. After the elevator opens, I quickly remove my heels, and Nathan does the same. He walks to the kitchen, and I head over to the couch.

“Do you want some wine?”

“Sure, thank you.” 

He enters the living room with a glass of wine for me and a scotch for himself. His hand found its way to my thigh when I sipped my drink. “I’m so sorry for missing your graduation, but it’s not like it will be your last.”

With my lips pursed, I respond. “It may not be my last, but it was important to me, and you missed it.”

He gulps his drink and sets it on the coffee table. “I didn’t mean to miss, and I’m sorry I belittled your graduation. I know things have been difficult this year, and I’m sorry. I promise things will get easier once I get established at work.” He scoots closer, and I place my glass on the coffee table.

“You have been saying that for the last year, and it seems like everything has been getting worse. I feel you don’t value me or this relationship.”
Instead of responding, he kisses my neck and hands down my back. “I do value this relationship and you.”

I push his chest, but he doesn’t stop. “Don’t you want me to make it up to you?”

“Nathan, please stop. We need to have this conversation.”

He runs his hands up my dress and traces his knuckles through my folds. “Are you sure you want to stop this?”

He nips my throat, and I moan. We need to have this conversation, but this feels so good. Nathan stops and takes off his shirt, and I bite my lip. “I thought you would like this view.” 

He leans back in to kiss me, and I turn my head.

“I’m sorry, Nathan. I can’t do this anymore.”

He sits back and runs his fingers through his hair. “It’s fine. We can finish this later.”

“No, Nathan, we can’t finish this later. I can’t keep doing this with you.”

“Wait, you’re breaking up with me?”

“Yes, this year has been shit, and today was the final straw.” I look up at his face, and his face is turning red.

“I can’t believe this. You want to throw away 3 years because I missed a graduation because of work.” He gets up, puts his shirt on, and paces in front of the couch. 

“It wasn’t just because of the graduation, it’s canceling on dates, it’s going hours without texting me back. It was cheating on your coworker the year before. I honestly think you are still seeing her.” Tears form in my eyes as the words leave my mouth. He apologized for cheating and said it’s stopped, but with all that has happened, I don’t think so.

“How many times do I have to apologize for that.” He reaches down, grabs his glass, and throws it across the room, and it shatters as it hits the wall. “I’m not fucking her. I don’t want her. I’ve done everything I can to prove I’ve changed, but you won’t let it go.”

“Get out.”
	
“What?”
	
“You heard me. Please get out; you are already mad and throwing shit. Nothing is going to get resolved tonight.”
	
He sat down and ran his hands through his hair. “I’m sorry for throwing stuff. I’m sorry for missing your graduation. I’m sorry that I haven’t been the boyfriend you deserve.”
	
He stood up, walked over to me, and pulled me into a hug. I take in his scent, and tears stream from my eyes.
	
I pull back and look up at him. “I’ll leave tonight, but I want to talk about this. I don’t want us to end like this.”
	
“Neither do I, but we’re going in circles.”
	
“Let me help you clean up the mess at least. “
	
I nod, and Nathan helps me clean up the glass, and he leaves without another word.

Me: Hey, girly pop. Want to go out tonight?

Brianna: I thought you would be with Nathan.

Me: Not tonight. We got into it. I don’t want to talk about it tonight.

Brianna: I’m coming over

Me: Thank you. 

I sit down on my couch and scroll through the many congratulations messages and the Facebook photos my family has uploaded. I hear my elvator door ping and Brianna walks in with a bottle.	

“I picked this up. I figured you might need a pick-me-up, and Jack always helps.”
	
I smile at her. “That sounds lovely. I have Coke in the fridge.”
	
Brianna follows me to the kitchen, and we mix drinks and turn on music.

“Some of our lovely classmates have sent me some places where college grads get in for free.”
	
She does a shimmy and heads into my room. I laugh, “Well, let’s get going.”
	
She goes into my closet and comes out in a short purple dress with a high neck and a low scoop in the back. “This will look beautiful on you. Why haven’t you worn this before?”
	
“I purchased it for a date with Nathan,” I explain with a shrug, “but he canceled at the last minute, so it’s been sitting in my closet ever since.”
	
She throws the dress at me, goes back into my closet, and pulls out a dark red pantsuit. “Can I wear this?”
	
I stand, take off my dress, and begin putting on the purple dress. “Sure, it probably looks better on you than it did on me.”
	
She slips into the tailored pantsuit, its fabric hugging her form perfectly. I take a moment to observe her, noticing how the material accentuates her figure in a way mine never could. I’m tall with an athletic build, some curves, but Brianna is of average height, with thick thighs and a curvy silhouette that commands attention.
	
I whistle. “Damn girl, you can keep that pantsuit. It looks so good on you.”
	
She smiles and twirls and looks me over. “And you clean up nice, little lady. What are you doing with your hair?”
	
I look in the mirror, and I currently have my curls up in a slick back ponytail. “Maybe keep it like this?”
	
She looks me up and down and then checks her phone. “Let me refresh your curls, and then we are good.”
	

After she fixes my curls, we head out and call a Lyft to a club. As promised, we got in for free. We entered the club filled with pulsating music and lively energy. Brianna grabbed my hand and led me to the bar, where we ordered tequila shots and took them back. 
	
One of my favorite songs starts playing, and I grab Brianna as we head to the dance floor. I sway my hips to the rhythm, letting the music carry me away, when suddenly, a pair of hands settle on my hips. The person pulls me closer, and we begin grinding in sync with the beat. As I turn to catch a glimpse of my mystery dancer, his face flickers into view through the strobe lights. Hazel eyes, brown skin, a well-maintained goatee—he’s slightly taller than me, around six feet. His muscular arms and solid build immediately draw my gaze. 

I give him a small smile, and he smiles and leans close to my ear. “I have a section. Do you want to join me?” 

“I have a friend with me. Can she come?” 

He looks over my shoulder and sees Brianna, and he nods. I grab Brianna’s hand, and we follow the mystery guy up to his section, which is secluded by curtains. When we enter the section, another mystery guy is sitting on a couch. The section is lighter, and I glance at the mystery guy again - he looks even hotter in the light. Brianna and I take a seat across from the mystery guys.
 
The man who invited us to the section ordered a round of shots before he spoke. “Welcome, ladies. My name is Javier, and this is my best friend, Isaiah.”

I smile. “Thank you for inviting us up. I’m Nadia, and this is my bestie, Brianna.”

The server comes back with rounds, and Brianna and I grab ours, and we cheer with the guys and take the shots. 

Isaiah speaks this time. “What brings you two here?”

Brianna leans in. “We just graduated from UW today.”

“Congratulations, ladies. I graduated 10 years ago.”

Brianna and I exchanged looks and smiles. 

Brianna’s song comes on, “This is my song. Come dance with me, Nadie?”

“My feet are hurting.” I look over and notice Javier whispering to Isaiah, and Isaiah stands.

“I can come to dance with you. If you allow me,”

Brianna giggles, “Well, come on, I don’t want to miss it.” She grabs Isaiah’s hand and leads him out of the section.

Javier gets up, and I thought he was going to the bathroom, but he sits next to me.

“Is there a reason you moved closer to me?”

“I wanted to hear you better. So, what did you graduate with?

“Chemistry and you?”

“Business administration. I don’t say this often, but you are beautiful.” 

My cheeks heat at the compliment. It’s been a long time since I flirted with anyone else. 

“Thank you” 

He stretches his arm along the back of the couch. The server comes back, and I hear him order a bottle, and the server leaves again. 

I bite my lower lip without meaning to, the bass from the song thumping beneath my feet. Javier’s eyes flick down for a split second—quick, respectful, but definitely noticing.

I look away, pretending to focus on my drink before setting it on the table. The music shifts into a smoother rhythm, something warm and familiar that loosens the tension in my shoulders.
Javier pats the spot beside him—closer this time.

An invitation, not a command.

I hesitate for half a heartbeat, then move over, settling next to him with just enough space between us to pretend it’s intentional.

“That dance wore you out?” he asks, a teasing smirk tugging at his mouth.

“A little,” I say, brushing a curl behind my ear. “Or maybe your friend’s tequila did.”

He laughs softly, his arm draped casually along the back of the couch, close enough that the heat from his skin gathers at the nape of my neck.

The server walks away just as the music shifts, the beat flipping into something smoother, richer—Latin, rhythmic, the kind of song that makes your body move before you even realize it.
Javier’s head lifts slightly, a smile tugging at his mouth.


“Oh, I know this one,” he says, tapping his fingers to the opening beat. “You ever danced bachata before?”

I laugh. “Uh… no. I barely survived high-school prom.”

He grins, slow and warm. “Come on. I’ll show you.”

He stands and offers his hand, palm open. It takes me a second to decide, but curiosity—and maybe the tequila—nudges me forward. I place my hand in his, and he gently guides me a few steps from the couch, still inside the privacy of the curtained-off section.

“Okay,” he says, positioning himself in front of me. “Bachata is simple. It’s all about the rhythm. Four steps.”

He taps his foot lightly.

“One… two… three…”

Then he lifts his hip slightly.

“And four.”

I try to copy him, but end up doing something closer to a confused side shuffle. I wince. “I think my feet just filed for divorce.”

He laughs, a deep, warm sound that sends a flutter through my chest.

“Relax,” he murmurs, stepping closer but still giving me space. “Don’t think. Just follow me.”

He places one hand lightly at my waist—barely there—his touch warm but respectful. With his other hand, he gently takes mine, guiding it onto his shoulder.

“Now,” he says softly, “let me lead.”

The music wraps around us, soft and rhythmic. He moves first—slow, deliberate steps—and I follow, my body aligning with his naturally. After a few tries, I start finding the rhythm, letting the beat settle into my hips and legs.


“There you go,” he murmurs. “See? You’ve got it.”

“No,” I tease, “you’re just patient.”

“Patience is a virtue,” he says, “and right now, it’s paying off.”

His thumb brushes lightly along the back of my hand. I don’t think he meant it to—it feels more like a reflex than a flirtation—but it sends a quiet warmth up my arm.

We move in slow circles, the world outside the curtains fading behind the sway of our bodies and the soft hum of the guitar. Our hips don’t touch—just the occasional brush of knees, the whisper of fabric, the shared warmth of two people learning each other’s rhythm.

For a moment, I forget everything else.

Nathan.

The argument.

The ache in my chest.

All I feel is the music… and Javier’s steady presence guiding me through it.

When the song ends, he pulls back just a little, but his hand lingers at my waist—light, unsure, as if waiting for permission to let go.

“You’re a quick learner,” he says.

“And you’re a good teacher,” I reply, breathless in a way that has nothing to do with dancing.

We both stand there for a moment too long, the silence warm and charged, before he finally lets his hand fall away gently.

1pm2q0p,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Apprehensive-Elk8360/comments/1pm2q0p/aita_for_ghosting_my_70yearold_boss_after_she/,AITA for ghosting my 70-year-old boss after she kissed my shoulder,"I (now 25 F) live in a small town. Most people who live here are conservative and religious. I am not. (this is relevant) I am an artist and student, and I was looking for a part time job to earn some extra money. I ended up applying for a job at a family owned coffee shop, art gallery, and bakery. Mary (70s) and Jake (80s), the couple who owned the bakery, were hoping to sell the business. I was told to drop off my resume at the cafe for Mary. While I was there, I ordered a latte for the drive home and while I was waiting, I heard the staff talking about me in the kitchen. One girl said how gorgeous I was. She (Faith) had made a point of complimenting me once before, telling me I was freaking gorgeous, hair, outfit, everything."" I was flattered, but uncomfortable. A few days later, I had a job interview. Mary (my boss) was friendly and professional during my interview. She told me that the group of women I would work with were easy to get along with and no one should ever have any issue working with them. That should've been my sign. My second sign should have been the wages. However, I was told to expect a $2 per hour raise once I surpassed a certain amount of hours. I arrived early on my first day of work, and Mary introduced me to my coworkers, Belinda (40s) and Trudy. (50s) My introduction and initial training went well, and at 10 o'clock, when Mary was leaving for the day, she went in for a hug. (no permission) I was a bit taken aback, because I was not expecting that, and I am not a hugger. (past trauma) However, I reciprocated because the hug was sudden, almost like a pounce. I brushed this incident off and assumed everyone at this job were hugger.s. I want to say that it was a dream come true for me to work with women (past trauma)My job was going really well, we had a lot of older women who were regulars, and they all seemed to really like me. I had some experiences with creepy male customers, but I expected to, and it was nothing too crazy. Belinda trained me. I liked my coworkers. Mary came in every day to make sure everything was going smoothly, but she would leave around 10. She really liked me. She would give me lots of compliments (mostly about my looks) and talk to me a lot, asking about my life, background, and art. I watched to see if my coworkers hugged each other, or if Mary hugged them, but I never saw it. It was getting warmer, and I wore a sweater to work when I should've worn a t-shirt. Half-way through the day, Faith looked at me and said, ""How can you stand wearing sweaters all the time? It's so hot, I couldn't stand it."" I laughed a told her I needed to go shopping for summer clothes and that I didn't know it was going to get hot. I wear a lot of vintage pieces and I make some of my clothes, so my wardrobe has taken a long time to build up. The next week I wore a green dress to work. This was a dress I made for myself. When I walked in, Mary told me how pretty I was and before she left, she gave me another hug. (she did not hug anyone else) I thought it wasweird, but I chalked it up to 'grandmotherly behavior.' Later, Faith asked me where I'd got my dress, and when I told her I had made it myself, all my coworkers were shocked and told me how good it looked. A week later, Faith asked me if I go to church. When I said I didn't, she seemed surprised and asked if I wanted to find a church. I said 'maybe' although it was a definite 'no.' (my mistake) She listed all the churches nearby. When I said I attended a concert at one of them, she was surprised and told me that ""those people accepted sin into their church."" She did not elaborate on what sin she was talking about, and Trudy jumped into the conversation and told Faith that it was good to be accepting, which I agreed with. It's important to remember that Jake and Mary were trying to sell their business privately, off the market. When I started working they zeroed in on me and my husband as potential buyers. My husband (now 31) is known as an entrepreneur in our community, and he has experience in buying and running business. We had recently sold a business, and my husband was in school for a career change that he is passionate about. It's scary to have your new boss say, ""Hey, do you want to own this place?"" But I wasn't against it at first. I did find the whole thing odd but the art gallery would have fit well with my career. Jake had a meeting with me to tell me how he'd like to sell and how much the business made. I was suspicious he was overstating the figures and I was confused why my coworkers weren't offered this opportunity. I knew Belinda had turned them down so that she could start her own business. She was in the process of leaving her job. I didn't know why Faith wasn't interested, since she had been there for several years. I thought it might be a good opportunity for her.Soon after my conversation with Faith about church my work schedule changed from working the coffee bar with Faith to baking in the kitchen. A few weeks after that my hours changed after Belinda quit. There were 2 new employees, and I was assigned to Trudy's days off. We were all close to the same age. One day my coworkers had a conversation about how they thought Mary was a conservative Christian. This led to Stacy writing a Christian quote on the task board, to see if Evelyn would comment on it or get rid of it.It was common for Stacy and Faith to make judgemental comments about people and how 'sinful' they were. Based on my experience with religion, these comments were alienating so I made to sure be polite to them, but keep to myself.One day, my husband came into the cafe to study, as he often did, and he surprised me with flowers. I didn't know he was there until I heard Faith say loudly, ""Well, aren't you the perfect husband!"" I heard him laugh and ask for me. I went out and took the flowers and rang up his order. I brought the flowers back while Faith went on about how sweet he was, how I was living the dream, and how she only got flowers on her birthday. (she was not in a relationship) The more she talked, the angrier she sounded, to the point where I changed the subject. I was losing enthusiasm for my job.I always finished my tasks before noon, and with 4 people to make sandwiches and serve coffee, it left us with down time. (small town, not busy)Sometimes if I finished early on a week day I would ask off early. Atp my coworkers and I went out for dinner. Faith told us to dress up. I wore red heels and a white lace shirtdress. (which I made) When I got there, I realized I was overdressed. Everyone else had worn short dresses and sneakers. I felt so embarrassed about misunderstanding. The night ended with Stacy guessing my enneagram number and telling me my traits i.e. conservative, judgemental, traditional, practical, and perfectionistic. I told her politely that she was mistaken. They listened to worship songs on the way home and Faith got mad when a birth control ad came up and said that people like that needed jesus. while I googled what an Enneagram was. 
   The events of the evening hit me pretty hard afterwards, because I finally realized that this wasn't my crowd, and it never would be. When I got home I cried. I worked the next day and finished my tasks early. I messaged Mary to ask for additional work, since it was a slow day and there were 5 of us working. Mary told me to make a cake. I ended up using the wrong mixer by accident. Faith told me I had ruined the cake, but helped me switxh to a different mixer. I was finishing up the cake (it was not ruined) and a timer went off. I went to the stove and shut the timer off, checked the oven, and saw there was a piece of quiche for a customer being warmed up. I asked who the quiche was for, and Faith told me that ""if a timer went off, you need to turn it off immediately, check the stove, and serve the quiche."" It wasn't my job to serve customer orders that day. I finished the cake and prepped it for the oven. I planned to put it in the main oven, since it was too hot to be running two ovens, and there was plenty of space. As I prepared to put the cake into the main oven, Faith said she had only seen Mary use the big oven for this recipe, and that I should have preheated it first. I took the cake out and paused in front of the big oven. ""Don't you even know how to turn it on?"" Faith appeared beside me, turned it on and walked away. Faith told me my cake might fall because I hadn't preheated the oven.The cake was perfect. The next day, I received a long text from Mary. She told me she needed to retrain me and that she wanted to change my schedule so I could work with her all day. I was confused why I needed more training, since Belinda had trained me to do everything, and I asked Mary if the schedule change would be long term. She responded by telling me  i just wasn't ready to work up front yet. I had been consistently up front until my schedule changed weeks ago with no communication. I said I'd rather meet in person to discuss the changes. She agreed.he meeting began with her asking about my work preferences, and I told her I didn't prefer baking. I also said that there was not enough baking to keep me busy. She agreed, and said that they had too many staff at the moment, and wondered if I would rather make sandwiches and serve customers. I said I would prefer that to baking and she said that was good, because she didn't think I was ready to work the bar. (Again I had for two whole months without complaint) She said that Faith (and herself) had noticed once that I asked about how to make drinks, which was unfortunate, because I needed to ask questions to learn, but my questions were inconvenient to the other staff.we decided that I would start making sandwiches. Just as I thought the meeting was over, Mary leaned forward, looked deep into my eyes and said, You're so quiet and reserved, I never know what you're thinking."" I leaned back a little and smiled. I didn't know what to say. ""You're so reserved,"" she repeated. ""I want to make sure you aren't holding anything back. Are you and I good?"" I stared, then matter-of-factly stated that things were fine, thanked her for meeting with me, and left. When I went back, Mary was there to great me and gave me detailed instructions.I listened but I knew how to do all the things.She told me to make a sandwich for her before she left, which I did. Before she left she came down to my station and apologized for leaving me in a lurch.I assured her I was fine and I had everything under control.""Thank you, thank you!"" She sounded a little breathless, and I looked down to see if she was okay. She was standing really close to me. She came closer and gave me a really snuggly hug and as she drew back she grabbed my arm with both hands, and kissed my upper arm/shoulder. I was in shock. I left at noon and I never came back. I refused to put in my two weeks notice, I didn't pick up my last paycheck, and I didn't respond to any of Mary's messages, which she ended with ❤️ Mary. I blocked her.

note that when i was a newborn, i got coffee spilled on my head which left me with a scar that most likely deeply influenced on my personality and ADHD
i genuinely despise how emotionally unstable im becoming. it started since as long as i can remember but reached a breaking point when i was 12 years old and since then its been getting worse
this year i changed schools because the last one i was in was really unfair to me and didnt acknowledge any struggles id bring up (im a very shy and reserved person when talking about them, i usually not say anything and keep it to myself because in the same school when i told my problems i was brushed off for being a ""manchild"")
ive lost almost all my real life friends, usually either because of just us growing up or them making fun of me in a vulnerable moment and the only one i still have is the most social person i know, so usually we dont have much time to talk or hangout.
im not doing great at my new school either. all my classmates think im weird and the popular kids there tried to do the thing where they talk to a neurodivergent supposedly being ""their friend"" when they were making fun of everything i liked and then complained when i found a joke about god funny (funnily enough, if god did exist he would despise these people) but anyways.
these past few days have been super hard for me because i cant go without thinking once about my social situation i cant stop thinking about it and i almost cry everytime i think about it because i feel ive dissapointed my parents for being a socially rejected freak i have literally lost motivation for every single hobby ive had. i no longer enjoy drawing or making music as i used to and they were the only things going for me.
my usual day at school is:
sitting on class fidgeting a bit, on breaks walk around the school, people usually get weirded out by this the most. every single time i try being in a group that accepts me im never included and i get it, i try to talk but it never seems like they care and meanwhile its sad i just try to ignore it the best i can
i genuinely feel so lonely because even the kids who get along with everyone dont like me. theres this one girl who always tells me to go away or stop walking and looks at me like im a creature from area 51 when she hangs out with even weirder dudes in my class who brag about drawing porn even if its a group full of people she tells me to get away and i genuinely ask what have i actually done wrong other than being unsettling to people when i walk and laugh/talk to myself
i try to be a very normal and supportive person when i talk to them too but their impression of me never changes
i feel even more guilty because of the fact this is a new setting and im still getting fucked over by neurotypicals
and thats what i hate the most about my emotional instability
i overthink every single action someone does to me. if its positive i think about it often and feel wanted but if its negative i will fantasize about deeply hurting the person who ever did something negative to me and i hate it. i hate that now i walk around and i cant think about anything other than hurting the people that dont treat me well. i despise those people though, they are a genuine cancer to society and have fucked my mental health severely.
every single day is just me thinking about that or thinking about being friends with them too, i fantasize about hanging out with them, talking to them about things that i like, i hate it so much because in reality their most defining and unique trait is the same one the rest have.
ive lacked genuine friendship for so long i hate it when i almost form one and then it crumbles because the other person isnt interested.
i hate being an outsider to literallt everything and everyone i want to know.
i hate being envious about neurotypicals/social people because i know i will never be in their shoes
i hate being lonely 24/7 and having to rely on my daydreaming to not feel like shit
i hate feeling horrible and the only times when i vent about it nobody gives a fuck
i hate losing passion for everything that i loved doing before for no explanation at all
i hate how i look because i know girls here dont fw it
i hate that my mom thinks that my interest are cause of being on the internet and meeting ""weird"" people, she always tell me to not categorize myself but its obvious she says that for her own well. not mine. she didnt want her child to turn out like this so she says that to console herself. she doesnt accept his interests and thinks im being influenced by queer or autistic people.
i hate the fact that i can cry without making any noise at all
i hate almost every single aspect of my life because i know people dont like me. there will ve genuinely horrible fucking people but they choose them over me.
i hate the fact people talk about being good to mentally challenged people until it's about me
i hate not sharing anything with almost anyone in a normal social place
i hate hugging my pillow thinking its someone else
i hate never being good at anything specifically and just being decent. never the best. so many things i did that i dont do anymore, and even if i do im just decent.
i hate being euphorically happy and then switching up to crying about my problems.
i hate walking around thinking about having supportive friends because thats the most loser behavior ever
i hate having to save my tears until i ask the teacher if i could go to the restroom
i hate that literally all of them will scold me for being too distracted yet never help me or note it out.
i feel extremely alone all the time now. there has been times where i try to talk to people and they leave on read and im just there waiting for something to happen.
ive never been loved by a girl and i hate when im touched by one for the smallest thing
i hate having limerence and i hate overthinking about every single thing i do or other people do.
i hate the fact that i have to sit on my room alone while my brothers are going out to their social events/friends while im here trying to figure out what the fuck to do
i hate the most that when i talk about it it sounds like a smaller deal than it is so i just look like a pussy but i genuinely am so lonely right now i overthink about everything i overthink if the person takes longer to respond if they no longer text like they used to that they no longer talk if someone has blocked me i overthink it all and i feel like such a weak pussy for it

I originally thought that was unusual since that's not something I used to see when I lived here around 2012. Turns out it was foreshadowing current problems.  
  
After forgetting to pee before leaving the movie theater I assumed there would be some sort of public restroom along my walk to my hotel room to make up for my mistake. I was SO wrong. You don't know how hard it was to walk that far on a full coffee bladder without just peeing on the sidewalk. Even places like the metro center only had washrooms for ticketholders.  
  
I don't care if people do drugs in the bathroom as the security personnel claim. I would rather piss one stall over from a guy passed out on heroin on the shitter than to literally piss on the street where people hang out with their kids. But this city made me reconsider my moral compass tonight.

I did not pee on the sidewalk, but there are no shortage of people who would in this situation. Fix your public restroom situation, Halifax! It shouldn't take walking into 6 large buildings and asking for assistance to find a place to pee. Anywhere outside this city I could realistically expect the first place I stop at to have a place to use the washroom. Truro is becoming more pedestrian-friendly than an actual city.

first, dizziness (obviously) but not like, literal i'm about to fall over dizziness. it comes really heavily anytime i really move my eyes or my head at all in a little buzz. along with that i often feel whats almost like a weird jolt. my heart pounds for about half a second, i twitch a bit, and my head aches and the dizzy comes. this all happens really quick, within like actually one second. even in writing this i've experienced over like probably 20 or 30 of these jolts.

when i'm not moving too much, (which is normal, i spend a lot of time gaming on my laptop or scrolling on my phone) it's still there, but in a different way. my head faintly aches, i feel that sort of dizziness, and i offen feel fatigue along with it. muscle aches, etc. but throughout the day i'll constantly be feeling that awful jolty dizzy feeling and it really, really blows.

now for some possible causes i've considered- 

1. i'm in the middle of having some dental work. back in november i had an infected tooth and since then i've had a root canal which was paused and is getting picked up again later this month because my roots are weird. i dont experience too much pain with the tooth, though.

2. i drink a lot of energy drinks. this dizziness episode started last thursday, which was the day i ran out of monsters. this wouldnt be the first time i've had withdrawls and this is definitely not what it felt like before. and also, i figure the alleged withdrawls would go away after a couple days, it being saturday now. it still not having gone, i had a cup of coffee today, which did nothing to help.

3. i'm on various medications, including 5mg of estrogen, effexor, and others which dont really matter. the headache was at its worst today, which i also forgot to take my meds, lol. i dont know if those withdrawls come so soon but they could, so i guess when i take them tomorrow i'll see if i feel better and maybe update this post.

i struggled to find somewhere to post this because it feels like such a weird and uncommon issue. hell, i barely know what migraines are like, if this even is one, or if i've ever had one. being born a male i tend to understate my problems a lot, even to myself. assuming that my issues simply can't be that bad, but through transitioning i'm learning to really feel and connect with my emotions and that what i feel is real and valid. anyways, i see a lot of posts on r/anxiety similar to this but i don't really think this is an anxiety related issue, and r/advice or something feels too broad, lol. anyways, my point is thank you to anyone who interacts with this post. i know that this is probably a far cry from the awful shit that some of you have to deal with, and to all of you i want to tell you how incredibly fucking strong you all are. you're a badass, don't forget that. thanks again, and goodnight <3",1,1765678030.0,migraine,2,1.0,False

It is Saturday so the perfect day for a break. I don't feel as bad as when I ate that bad ramen but my stomach is achy and their is a mistiness in my mind that makes it hard to make words work the way I want them to. No cause, just a monthly down period I have grown begrudgingly used to. I did write the next sections of outlines last night and review it today, just to keep myself feeling a little busy.

I'm rather tired but I am hoping my evening coffee will wake me up a bit. I've been having some interesting dreams lately. I forget to tell you that the day before I had a dream I was back in school and I was plotting revenge against one of my old music teachers. I'm sure I've mentioned before how much I resent them for various reasons. I was dreaming of the first teacher; a man who made us play a stupid musical baseball game instead of actually teaching us about music and once stared me down like he wanted to beat me because I accidentally banged on a gong too loud. I'm sure it made him feel very tough, intimidating a ten year old into submission. I didn't actually get any sort of revenge on him in my dream and in hindsight I don't even know what sort of revenge would have been reasonable. My biggest regret when it comes to him was simply not calling him out on his unprofessional behaviour and perhaps telling my parents how uncomfortable his staring made me. The time to do so has long passed though and I really have no idea why my mind conjured him up to me that night.

Last night, I had an even stranger dream about being some king of anthropomorphic lion warrior fighting against an attacking army of anthropomorphic lion vampires. Dreams are funny like that. At least there was no zombies. I did get pounced on and bit in the end though. Oh well. I think after I was turned the vampire lioness and I became rather good friends at least. Strange.

Anyway, that is all I have to tell you about. Just a couple of strange dreams. I may try to write tonight or at least write some more outline. Wish me luck in my foggy brain getting something done.

I (50/m) had something happen today where I was seriously wondering if I should go to the ER. Something bit me while in garage getting Christmas decorations. Side of head swelled…slurred speech. 

At same time, had the kid (8/m) run out into the road. Grabbed him..had to go to neighbors to ask to take a look at me and possibly help corral my little one. (I live alone -widows 1 1/2 years). They weren’t home. No family that really gives a crap within three states…and even then, they don’t want to have to handle it. 

Ran out into road again as he broke my grip. Got him back inside. Took antihistamines and cold compress, marked where bite and swelling was to look later. 

During that, he flooded the kitchen. Spent the day downing coffee because…well…antihistamines. During that time he destroyed several of my late wife’s favorite decorations. (I’m not at all a holiday person, she was, so I honor her memory with putting some of that out). 

Flooded kitchen again after I tried to block with chairs. Threw his “spill proof” cup hard enough to break against the wall and leave me to mop wall/ceiling/floor. 

While moving his school notebook, a sheet fell pit where he had been kept away from a fun activity at school Friday because of his being aggressive. 

I KNOW I have it so much better than most. It’s just so very hard lately. I don’t see an end. Just him getting bigger, as I grow older. Any support or extracurricular activities are during the times I have to be at work, or geared to “Mommy & me”. Single dad support is looked at as being a failure of some macho code around here (and a lot of online too).

For example, I always talked about doing hiking trips in Norway but she was highly critical of the idea by saying that these types of activities aren’t comfortable and that I would regret doing it. Only for her to come back later by saying that she met a new friend and she might join her on a hiking trip in Switzerland. Suddenly, this whole hiking idea is no longer uncomfortable and she likes it?

Another example is when she knows that I’m passionate about cooking and I usually share the things I make with her. Only for her to come to me saying that cooking isn’t that complicated and people make a big deal out of it and that cooking is nothing but following a recipe so technically it’s impossible to mess up.

Another example is when I told her that I went to a record listening party where they were playing house music and she said oh I don’t understand what’s the deal with house records these days.

Another example is how I shared my passion for coffee with her and her answer was that coffee making isn’t a hobby, you just need to be rich enough to buy a coffee machine and invest in the equipment.

Although her comments do not personally affect me but I do wonder if her reactions are worthy of calling her my friend, or if I should be wary of considering someone like her as a friend. I don’t know if I should consider this as a major red flag to end a friendship or take space, does someone have advice for me? Did anyone live a similar experience?

To be honest, I have changed countries in the past years of my life so making friends have been very difficult for me. Hence why I’m trying to hold into the friendships that I have.

It was one of the most painful watching experiences I’ve had in awhile and I watched The Coffee Table (2022) the other week. I think that says a lot.

At no point did I feel any relief, it was just painful the whole way through. The entire film feels like being gaslit over and over and over. We see through Pete’s perspective, therefore we are being manipulated just as much as he is. This is the type of movie that puts you in a weird mood for a few hours after you see it. Maybe it just really got to me because I have social anxiety it’s an extremely accurate depiction of how it feels. 

This movie is my absolute worst nightmare. I honestly don’t understand how it’s marketed as a comedy, I didn’t laugh at all. The supposedly “funny” moments just feel unsettling juxtaposed with all the characters’ bizarre behaviors. The final scene with Pete’s girlfriend literally made me cry because I felt so bad for him. This person who is alluded to as Pete’s only lifeline from his psycho friends turns out to be just like them in the end.

That being said, I liked the film because, among other things, it perfectly achieves what it sets out to do. It portrays the reality of social anxiety and the blurring of the border between reality and paranoia. I recommend it if you aren’t mentally unstable.

I'm 25, I like science related stuff, coffee & chocolate, anime, series, electro (especially Tame Impala and Justice) as well as jp city pop, future funk, lofi, and pop. My fav games include Noita, Caves of Qud, Baba is you, Portal 2, Spore, and Skyrim. My fav outdoor activities are seeing my friends and traveling. I enjoy indoor climbing and martial arts too but it's been a while and I'm not very good at it. I handle stress badly and prefer not talking about my past or future.

I selected a few questions from the introduction post. Do not hesitate to ask me anything if necessary.

>* If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?

I do not feel loneliness, I'm always in my own company. Sometimes there's people too, and sometimes I'm glad that they are here.

>* Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forms of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.

I'm not artistic but I enjoy art independently of the medium. I like to view it through the lens of information theory, differential geometry, signal processing, and probabilistic modeling. I'm not really sure if that is of any help, but I attached some photos I took to the post (hope you enjoy them).

>* Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?

Did you ever watch your friend play a video game and at some point there is something that you are nearly sure is a trap? What would happen if he stepped on it? Did you ever feel the need to use various tactics to subtly guide him towards the trap for the sake of fun and curiosity? I do, even if sometimes I have to be the one to set up the trap from the beginning. 

>* How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?

I enjoy very much creating a full plan from A to Z. I do not enjoy following it at all.

>* What’s important to you and why?

Having fun. Sometimes it's about solving problems, and sometimes it's about trying new things. Many of my decisions are based on how much fun I can have. It's fun to have fun.

>* How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what’s around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?

Reality is a fascinating subject of study and I put my interest in it for social integrity, but it's not something that I value particularly highly. Daydreaming is one of my favorite hobbies, I immerse myself in my thoughts completely and answer the world in autopilot.

>* How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you’ve made it?

If the decision can be made through reasoning I'll take as much time as I need, otherwise a coin flip is enough. Once decided, the answer won't change.",2,1765677198.0,MbtiTypeMe,3,1.0,False

I am hoping to make a new online friend that is fun/funny, genuine, willing/able to put effort into conversations(I will do the same!). I would prefer to chat with people around my age, or older(please no one under 30!), that is able to text/write full words lol - a bit of slang is cool, but I can’t do the whole “u” instead of “you” thing etc all the time! 

Some things I enjoy that could give an idea if we have interests in common, or just to start a conversation: music! My favorite band is blink 182, and has been since I was 14 - also pretty into Alkaline Trio, mgk, Taylor Swift etc etc. I enjoy shopping and getting my nails done - I see a very talented nail tech that makes all my nail art dreams a reality. I love coffee, movie and tv shows, with a preference for anything horror. I love to exercise daily, and love to go for long walks. Other things too, but I don’t want to give everything away here, or make this intro too long.

1pm1ykr,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheImprovementRoom/comments/1pm1ykr/how_to_be_extremely_confident_even_if_youre_quiet/,How to be extremely confident even if you're quiet (what 10 years of studying people taught me),"I used to think confidence meant being loud, charismatic, the life of the party.

Then I spent a decade watching how the most respected people in rooms actually behave. The pattern I found changed everything: the quietest person often held the most power.

Real confidence isn't loud. It's calm, controlled, and magnetic in a way most people can't explain.

Here's what I learned:

1. Silence is your superpower, not your weakness

Most people panic when conversation stops. They rush to fill every gap with words, jokes, anything to avoid awkwardness.

Let it breathe.

When someone asks you a question, pause for two seconds before responding. Sounds simple but it does something powerful it shows you're thinking, not performing. People unconsciously read this as high status.

I watched this happen in a meeting last week. Guy got asked a tough question. Counted to two. Then answered calmly. Everyone leaned in. The person who immediately word-vomited right after was forgotten in seconds.

2. Your body language talks louder than your mouth

Quiet confident people move differently. They're slower. More deliberate.

Next time you reach for your coffee, move 20% slower than your impulse tells you. When you walk somewhere, reduce your pace slightly. Rushed movement screams anxiety. Unhurried movement whispers control when you slow down physically, your nervous system actually calms down. Your body language doesn't just communicate to others. It communicates to you.

Stand like you own your space. Feet shoulder-width. Shoulders back but relaxed. Not aggressive, just grounded. Take up the room you're entitled to without apology.

3. Say less, mean more

I used to think I needed to contribute to every conversation to be valued. Wrong. Quiet confident people are selective. They speak when it adds value, not just to be heard.

Before you talk, ask yourself: Does this need to be said? Does it need to be said by me? Does it need to be said now?

When you DO speak, cut the fluff:

* ""Let's try a different approach"" beats ""Um, I was kind of thinking maybe we could try something else?""
* ""I disagree"" beats ""I don't know, I guess I see it differently, but maybe I'm wrong""

People remember the person who said three meaningful things, not the person who said thirty forgettable ones.

4. Master the strategic pause

This changed everything for me. When you finish making a point, stop talking. Don't explain further. Don't soften it. Just let it land.

Most people get uncomfortable and keep talking, which dilutes their message. You staying quiet after making your point is confidence. Silence makes people think about what you said instead of waiting for you to finish so they can talk.

5. React less than everyone else

Quiet confident people consistently under-react compared to the room. Someone tells a funny story and everyone's laughing loud? You smile genuinely but don't perform it. Someone shares exciting news and people are gasping? You say ""That's great"" with controlled enthusiasm.

Plus when you DO show big emotion, it carries weight because it's rare. Your excitement becomes valuable because you don't give it to everything.

6. Have strong opinions you state calmly

This is what separates quiet confidence from just being shy. Shy people avoid stating opinions because they fear judgment. Quiet confident people have clear views they're willing to share without aggression.

You can say ""I completely disagree with that approach"" in a measured, calm tone. The delivery makes the strong stance even more powerful. You're not trying to convince anyone or win an argument. You're just stating your truth.

I've watched this play out hundreds of times people respect clear positions even when they disagree. Wishy-washy stances get dismissed immediately.

7. Control your attention like it's currency

Your attention is valuable. Treat it that way.

When someone's talking to you, turn your full body toward them. Don't let your eyes scan the room. Don't check your phone. Be fully present for those two minutes.

People will remember you as one of the best conversationalists they've met. Not because you said anything profound, but because you actually listened. Almost nobody does this anymore.

also know when to withdraw attention. If a conversation isn't valuable or someone's being disrespectful, politely exit. Your time has boundaries. That's self-respect, and people can feel it.

8. Don't overshare - create layers

Most people anxiety-dump their entire life story trying to create connection. Quiet confident people reveal information slowly.

Surface level stuff first - where you're from, what you do. Then interests and perspectives as rapport builds. Deep vulnerabilities and dreams? Only with people who've earned it.

Scarcity creates value. When you don't give everything away in the first conversation, people become more curious about you. Mystery is magnetic.

9. Stay calm when people try to rattle you

Someone insults you? ""Interesting take"" with a slight smile. Someone tries to one-up you? ""Good for you"" with genuine neutrality. Someone baits you into arguing? ""I see it differently"" and move on.

Reactive people give their power away. When you can't be baited, you can't be controlled.

This is genuine calm that comes from being secure enough that other people's opinions don't shake you.

10. Build real competence in private

Here's the truth nobody wants to hear: You can't fake deep confidence.

But you CAN build it by getting genuinely good at things when nobody's watching. Every skill you master in private adds to your foundation.

Lift weights until you're objectively strong. Learn something until you're objectively competent. Build something until it objectively works.

Confidence is just self-trust. Self-trust comes from evidence. Evidence comes from doing hard things and succeeding. Stack enough of that, and you walk into any room with unshakeable calm.

What this looks like in practice:

You walk into a room. You move deliberately. You observe before jumping in. Your phone stays in your pocket. When someone speaks to you, you give them your full attention. When you speak, every word counts. When there's silence, you're comfortable in it.

People can't explain why they're drawn to you. They just are.

Quiet confidence isn't about being invisible. It's about being so secure you don't need constant validation.

1pm1xjq,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1pm1xjq/aio_for_giving_my_sister_the_silent_treatment/,AIO for giving my sister the silent treatment after she berated me?,"I (19) have been letting my sister (17) use my car while hers has been out of order for about 2 months now. Its gotten to the point where she uses my car more than I do outside of my shifts at work ( im a barista at a well known coffee chain) so I gently brought up the idea of my sister pitching in with maintenance since the oil needs to be changed alot earlier than normal due to the added mileage. She somewhat agreed, but not until after getting a dig in at me about being 19 living with her and my parents and having a gap semester before applying to college. I tried to keep the conversation engaged because I didn't feel like i was being listened to and was getting some unnecessary flack to which she just told me to “fuck off and shut up” and continued to tell me that im just a disappointing bum.

A few days later my sister and i had a conflicting schedule with my car, to which i would drive to work, my mom would drop off my sister at my place of work so she could drive my car and then be back before i got off later. at this point i made a peace offering by making her one of her usual drinks for free without her having to ask. she doesnt say thank you and instead gets mad at me for interrupting her scrolling on her phone while she waited for me to clock out.

Later on the drive home, i tried opening up another conversation with her and asked why she thought that i was a disappointment, to which she responded that i have no career lined out while im in a dead end job, as well as that i have no friends, struggle with keeping my spaces clean, and that the only person i have to lean on is my partner who “is going to get tired of you driving him around and buying him things and hes going to leave eventually” insinuating my partner is only with me to use me. she continues to talk about how shes better than me because of her career preparation, her athletic hobby, her friends and her active education status, as well as that she has more value as a person than me because of how much she would bring to society with her career path.

after i left the conversation and gave myself some time to cry things out (and avoid her until she leaves in my car to go to her job) i wrote out a small letter to text to her to tell her i want to cut any contact that i can with her, until she betters herself. the letter goes as:

“**Im proud of you. I always have been, and you’ve been a person that I’ve always been proud of your physical accomplishments, and im glad you’re working towards the future you want. But it doesnt matter how our paths differ, and i never wanted support or praise from you for how im doing in my life right now but going as far as to think im lesser than because of my current point in life isn’t something i think our relationship as siblings can come back from right now. I never felt like i had to be someone you looked up to or liked, or sought out, i just wanted to be someone you didn’t mind being around when you have to and to be there when you wanted. I care about you, and i want to see you happy, i just know that theres not much i can do to make you happy, so im not going to try. Im still here if you ever want to seek me out or try to love, but im not going to be the one to bridge any gaps.** “

from then on its been a full week and we haven't said a word to eachother, though she shows no remorse and continues on with her schedule with my car. I would escalate further to take away the keys to my car, however my parents are more in control of the situation and my hands are tied. so at this point i just dont plan on ever speaking with her again, and moving out sometime soon instead.

i feel like i might be overreacting since this is my little sister after all, and as an older sibling im expected to be there for her in any way that i can.

  
**edit:**

the car isn't in my name, it is in my parents, i just make the insurance payments by sending the funds to my parents, i am just registered as a driver. i also pay for all maintenance and my own gas of course. (the car was a gift from a family member so there are no payments nor down payment for any party) both of my parents now know about the treatment, my mom brushed it off and my dad is trying to start a conversation with the both of them about it. the only reason i have not taken back the keys to my car is that my parents would get extremely mad at me for ruining my sisters job by not allowing her to use my car as transportation to her shifts at her place of work. there are also two other cars that are sometimes available (my dads and moms car) however im not sure of my parent schedule. i just know there have been one or two times where she would be able to drive them instead but prefers driving my car.",4,1765676419.0,AmIOverreacting,25,1.0,False

I met a guy (he’s Korean, I’m German, if that matters) on a friends making app.

December 8

We matched on an app and decided to meet on the same day. It was framed as a friendly meeting, not an official date. He asked me to get coffee, so we went to a café first. We talked a lot, laughed, and quickly realized we had many things in common and were each other’s type. During coffee, he already asked if I’d like to meet again on December 10.

After that, we went for dinner and had a few drinks (but stayed sober). While eating, he suddenly touched my hand and told me I was pretty.

Later, we went to a karaoke room. While I was singing one song, he stood behind me, touched my hair, and smiled at me.

When we went outside, he looked disappointed and said he didn’t want the evening to end. We took photos together in a photo booth and went for a walk. While walking, he put his hand into my jacket pocket and held my hand. He mentioned that most places on that street were either for couples or restaurants, so I jokingly said, “Shall we pretend to be a couple?” He liked the idea.

The connection felt really good, easy conversation, lots in common, good chemistry. He gave me compliments and thanked me for the evening, saying he made a great memory thanks to me. We ended up going to a motel and had sex. When we went to sleep, he asked me to hug and cuddle him.

The next morning, until checkout at 11am, he kept pulling my arm around him and wouldn’t leave my side. When we parted at the subway, he thanked me again, texted me when he got home, and even asked where I was and when I’d arrive home.

December 10

We met at my place. I cooked for him and we planned to watch a movie together. Before he came, I sent him a photo of the food, and later he told me he showed it to his mom. She complimented my cooking, and he proudly told her that he made a German friend. He even took some food home and ate it with his mom.

At my place, he chose a scary movie. During the movie, he held my hand, caressed it, squeezed it when I got scared, and rubbed my arm. Afterward, he felt tired, so we laid down and rested. Again, he took my arm and put it around his body, cuddled tightly, and we slept like that for about two hours.

We had dinner, and he kept saying how delicious my food was. After dinner, we cuddled more. He touched my hair, held my face, told me I was pretty, and we had sex. After sex, we cuddled again and watched TV. He left around 10pm because he had work the next day. Before leaving, he gave me a big hug.

December 12

We met again at my place. I cooked, and he said it was the best food he’s ever had. We watched TV and cuddled for about an hour. Then he suddenly brought up “what we are.”

He said that I'm totally his type but he hasn’t thought of me as more than a friend yet, and asked if it would be okay if we didn’t have a relationship and just met casually as friends or friends with benefits. He emphasized the “yet,” which confused me even more.

He also told me that he deleted the app where we met. Apparently, because he doesn't use the app anyway.

We talked more and ended up agreeing on clear FWB “rules”:

• hanging out outside as friends

• doing fun activities together

• having sex

• only sleeping with each other and not meeting other sex partners

I told him I didn’t necessarily mind FWB (I’ve done FWB once before) but honestly? That experience was much more casual. There was no constant cuddling, no romantic gestures, and no emotional closeness like this.

That same day, we had sex again, spent the evening cuddling, kissing, watching movies, and went to bed together. 
The next morning, he was supposed to go to his academy for test prep, but he skipped it just to stay with me longer. Is this normal?

Another thing that confuses me:

When we chat, he always asks about my day, if I slept well and shares details about his own day as well. He tells me when he arrives at work, when he finishes work, what he’s doing during the day, and when he’s going to bed. This feels emotionally attentive and consistent, which doesn’t match what I personally understand as FWB.

My questions:

• Is this actually normal FWB behavior?

• Is exclusivity + emotional closeness still considered FWB?

• Does “not more than a friend yet” actually mean something, or is it just a soft rejection?

• Why would someone delete the app, act this affectionate, and still say they don’t want a relationship?

• Does he want a relationship without being aware of it?

I'm not looking for a relationship with him or anything. It's just that his behaviour makes me confused.

One of the main issues I have is that they seem to see me as a family member, not as a business owner and manager. For example, if ask them to change their approach to a certain task, something they become defensive and shut down. 

Unfortunately, we have argued a few times and in moments of anger a few of them have said things that imply that they are doing me a favour working for me, as if the job was a huge inconvenience for them, but I genuinely don’t get where this idea comes from. 

I pay all of them a better rate than I pay everybody else, I give them generous Christmas bonuses, more holiday than the rest of the team not to mention things like big bottles of olive oil, coffee (big bags of grains), etc. I don’t keep score of what I give them, but some of the things they said to me when they were angry, like threatening to leave on the spot, in the middle of service, made me sad. I’ve worked in a few places before I had my own business and I have never spoken to a manager like this. 

I often ask my partner if it’s my behaviour that is the issue and I’m told that although I could soften my delivery, my partner doesn’t think my requests are unreasonable. My partner works at the business, but I don’t have a problem with him.

1pm1tfd,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/1pm1tfd/to_those_protesting_hamiltons_brewery/,To those protesting Hamilton's Brewery,"In Rancho Cucamonga, California. 


First, I've done my share of protests - against war in the early 2000's, women's march and immigrants march in 2016, No Kings, etc. - and second, I have to admit that I'm just having a really bad day and week and year, so I'm much more upset than I usually would. 


I went to Hamilton's for the birthday of a friend, and to be more fair it was the girlfriend of my girlfriend's co-worker. I told my girlfriend that I would make an appearance, say happy birthday, buy the girl a drink and then go home to my childhood pet who was diagnosed with late stage cancer last night. 


As I approached the brewery, you were shouting and waving your signs and all that good protest fun, but as I tried to enter the lot there was too much of a crowd to safely get through. So I went to my office down the street to take care of something else, and on my way back I parked across the street in order to not endanger you. 


Apparently that's not a good idea! You took pictures of my car and reported me to the property manager of the lot where I parked, who immediately called to have me towed! And of course, I don't find out about this until I've walked all the way down past the train tracks to use the crosswalk and gotten across the street. The police informed me that you had called for the tow truck. It didn't make sense to take all the time to go back, get my car, move it into the lot you're impeding, just to pop in and say hi. I ran in, gave my greetings, and left. On my way back to my car you yelled at me that next time I would get towed, because this time I beat the tow truck. 


Now, like I said, I've done protests. I know how self righteous it can feel, and how much you can start to see anyone who crosses the picket line as evil because they're not on your side. It's a dangerous part of mob mentality, and it's something to be wary of in an activity like that, because it tends to turn decent people with good intentions into monsters. 

You are not monsters. But goddamn are you some stupid fucking assholes. I'm all for protesting in order to support your beliefs, but you pathetic morons aren't even protesting anything sensible - an existing business moved two blocks and you're trying to get people to boycott it because drunk driving is bad? Where the fuck were you before? Hamilton's may have actually reduced their seating options when they moved, because they don't have the big outdoor area between warehouses anymore. And you aren't saying anything about Hamilton's encouraging drunk driving, or not properly cutting people off! You're not mentioning some disaster that may have happened as a result of the move, you're really just saying ""Boycott this brewery because there are too many bars in the world!"" 


And when I park in a safer location because I don't want to accidentally hurt you? You jaywalk across a busy street to take pictures of my car! You are actually creating **more danger** by being there! 


But hey, you succeeded. You changed a bad behavior of mine! I will never ever park in that piece of shit property manager's lot again - I won't even walk through it! If I'm at Hamilton's and feel like venturing over there for some food, if I hear anyone talking about going over there, I'll remember this. Calle Ocho has great coffee, but I'm not welcome in that lot. 


You know where I *am* welcome? 


Fucking Hamilton's! I drive past it every day! The owner was nice to be today, even though I didn't have time to actually support his business! I'm gonna start dropping in on my lunch breaks, and my drive home from the office! And I still won't oppose your argument - drunk driving is definitely bad, and I won't ever do it. But you people guaranteed that whenever I feel like hitting up a brewery, it absolutely will be the one you chose to protest.

“It’s a sauna in there,” Space Sergeant Butch Calhoun muttered as he emerged from the Myung-ho Chae Recreation Facility (MCRF) into the sterile darkness of the hyper-filtered air.

Why was there a recreation facility named after Myung-ho Chae? Well, he was a Cosmic Corps legend. A planetary engineer serving in the early days, he was heroically crushed to death by twenty-seven tons of paper files while conducting an inspection based on the rumor of an improperly formatted decimal point sometime in 2037.

The Cosmic Corps Ball, which occurred deca-biannually, was winding down; it was almost time to start planning the next one in eighteen days. Orbiters, as the personnel of the Cosmic Corps were called, spent fifty-four percent of their time planning events. Butch removed his “throwback” suit jacket, which made him look like a low-budget airline pilot, and his starched dress shirt and hung them on the railing beside the building’s back exit. He intended to return for them later, but never did.

Butch had made a responsible decision to walk back to his quarters, as he had a few too many foams. Beer was too heavy to regularly transport from Earth, so Orbiters drank foam. It was a beverage made locally from fermenting a mash of a bioluminescent moss, which was the only vegetation on Glozanth IX, a Class-M-Questionable planet located in the Snörple Drift, a chaotic star cluster infamous for failed experiments. The closest taste an Earthling could associate it with would be wasabi.

He wasn’t far from the MCRF when someone shouted out.

“Hey, stop!”

A skinny, pale, blond Orbiter in an orange and teal Class Beta uniform bearing a rank junior to Butch’s urgently ran up to him.

“You’re in breach of Cosmic Corps Regulation Manual 94X-3A!” he shouted at Butch, and stood on his toes to get a better look.

“And you’re intoxicated! You’re a danger to yourself and others!”

The junior Orbiter wrapped his arms around Butch and attempted to pick him up. Butch was burly, strapping even, and didn’t budge when the young Orbiter tried to apprehend him. Butch put “Drizzle”, at least that was the name embroidered on his uniform, into a headlock. He was deciding whether to let Drizzle go, or to rough him up to teach him a lesson, when he was interrupted by more shouting.

“Hey!”

A group of three Orbiters had been walking down the same sidewalk several hundred feet behind Drizzle, and saw him in Butch’s clutches. Butch wasn’t about to let Drizzle go, but he saw what he thought was a foam-induced apparition… Drizzle licked his own eyeball.

Butch was trying to understand what he was seeing as the footsteps of the other Orbiters rapidly approached, then he felt the cold, slimy sensation of Drizzle licking his arm. Butch instinctively threw him onto the ground in a heap at the feet of the other Orbiters who had arrived to rescue him.

Such a display could only mean one thing: this guy was a Zarv in disguise.

The Zar’Vokian were mankind’s mortal enemy in the galaxy, a bipedal lizard-like race. It all started centuries ago, an incident that has been mythologized in Zar’Vokian folklore as “The Great Slight of Zar’Vok-Tuun.” A simple misunderstanding during the First Contact Summit on the neutral moon Diplomia-9, a human ambassador accidentally served ranch dressing to the Zar’Vokian diplomat Zar’Vok-Tuun, who had explicitly requested “the creamy white sauce made of fermented spores and crushed lava hornets.”

The result was instant purging for Zar’Vok-Tuun; more plainly, public diarrhea. The humans laughed, the Zar’Vokians vowed revenge.

What humans saw as a “harmless mix-up,” the Zar’Vokians viewed as an unforgivable spiritual desecration of their sacred gut biome. Unlike traditional warfare, the Zar’Vokians believe in “a thousand humiliations over one clean kill.”

Their tactics had thus far been: swapping salt with sugar in the Myng-ho Chae (a different Myung-ho Chae) Chow Hall (MCCH), adjusting all the chairs to be slightly too low, replacing caffeinated coffee with decaffeinated coffee, reprogramming base AI assistants to refer to the Orbiters as “toots”, and secretly installing bidets that announce “shame detected!” when used.

Each successful infiltration was followed by a ritual celebration, during which human prisoners of war are forced to wear giant fruit-shaped hats while having their buttocks gently whipped by the tails of Zar’Vokians circled around them in a conga line during a communal dance, while the event is broadcast to the Zar’Vokian Parliament, who hiss in approval while sipping from tiny mugs.

“He’s a Zarv spy,” Butch said plainly, pointing to Drizzle.

Drizzle whined as the other Orbiters helped him to his feet.

“He’s a crazy drunk!” Drizzle pointed accusingly at Butch.

“Whoa, calm it down Orbiter. We don’t need to be put on lockdown, just go sleep it off,” one of the strangers cautioned Butch, while another summoned the Cosmic Cops from his watch.

Orbiters wore watches that could make phone calls; they also monitored their blood sugar and video game usage. Orbiters were required to play video games for forty-two hours a week; it helped keep their testosterone and interest in the opposite, or same, sex to a minimum, giving them more time to plan parties.

Butch turned around to walk away, but before he could take more than a few steps the lights and sirens of two Cosmic Cops zipping to the scene on hover-cycles overtook him. They asked no questions. They simply blasted the group with an energy net, rendering them helpless, and dragged them to the Myung-ho Chae Law Enforcement Center (MCLEC) to sort it out.

They quickly determined that Butch was the primary suspect and put him into a cell alone. He did the only thing he knew to do in confinement, push-ups and various calisthenics.

Drizzle feigned dizziness and fell to his hands and knees, exaggerating his non-existent injuries while the others gave statements to the Cosmic Cops. One ran to get a pain reliever and water, the other ran to get a tourniquet, and in the confusion Drizzle, who was in fact a Zarv infiltrator, slinked out of the MCLEC and into the night.",1,1765675853.0,u_TugboatMacAbernathey,0,1.0,False
1pm1qq6,https://www.reddit.com/r/CampHalfBloodRP/comments/1pm1qq6/morgan_poisons_a_satyr_atlas_job/,Morgan Poisons a Satyr | Atlas Job,"ooc; Not my best work if I'm gonna be honest, but I have to get back into writing somehow. Hopefully still enjoyable! 

tws: not much! just be aware the entire premise is poisoning someone's drink. 

***

**Atlas: 1 | Camp: 3**

And that's only if you counted the shtick with the Golden Gate Bridge as a success. Otherwise, Atlas isn't winning at shit. How had they lost New London and both underwater ventures?

*Morgan's* wins, in contrast, are incalculable. 

She has completed four jobs over the course of her time with his forces. She has, importantly, not been captured in either battle she took part in. Since that battle, she came home and has won two sparring matches against empousai—Morgan *hates* empousai—who now owe her first picks of their dinner, taken over a couple patrol shifts from a demigod who gets her soda and other mortal delicacies in return, and actually put up a fight against Gail Williams before having her ass handed to her last time they sparred. 

So, basically, Morgan is doing great even though her generals and leaders are messing up at every turn. Unfortunately, she can't help the fact that her success is tied to theirs. Not just success, but her survival. She's in too deep now and has gotten too far here to abandon ship. 

Morgan obviously just needs to press her advantage more. She can poison a satyr. Who cares? She would be *safe*. In this world, safety just required the unwilling sacrifices of others sometimes. 

She departs for New Orleans camp once again shortly after signing her name on the board. 

When she steps out from the portal, she does not think about the reminder of where she heard about the siege at Camp Fish-Blood. That doesn't get her thinking about the deep sea, or how waking up in the underwater trenches where Atlas's forces fled in the wake of their defeat had made her breath catch each and every time. She definitely doesn't feel turned inside-out right now, realizing that this place making her think of Camp Fish-Blood is undeniably warm. When Morgan was underwater she thought she might be cold forever, iced through, only to realize on land that a jacket hadn't miraculously been added to her things, so she was still going to be cold. 

She pretends not to bask in the sun long enough that it's worth staying the night, and spends the next day asking after this satyr, trying to figure out what he looks like or where he might've come from. 

She talks to a cyclops who tells her the goat was definitely sniffing around the river, but he couldn't tell how close. 

""Obviously I'm going after him anyway, I don't care how close. Is everything with you guys about your goddamn eye problem?""

He frowns. ""I don't have an eye problem. I was born this way."" 

""If you weren't, you might know about depth perception."" 

She pulls a *gotcha* face. Then Morgan has to go, because judging from her extensive experience in making this exact joke, these kinds of conversations don't usually end well for her. The cyclops's patrol partner who got a better look comes back to camp an hour later, and Morgan asks the dracanae the same questions about the satyr. 

""I would gladly accompany you on your quest. Satyrs... I would love a taste again."" 

""Naw. I'm poisoning him."" Morgan waves the little vial of green sludge to show. ""From the Mother Keeper, so you know it's legit. Right?"" 

""Oh, the *Mother Keeper*. Well-"" The dracanae lets out a hissed sigh. ""I suppose, he might get what he deserves. I would rather rip those creatures limb from limb, but if the Mother Keeper is sending you... Don't worry.""

""Why?""

""Oh, she is a powerful creature. I am certain she learned all the best tactics in the *last* war of this nature."" The dracanae holds Morgan's eyes like this is the height of gossip. ""He'll get what's coming his way."" 

Morgan stuffs the vial back in her pocket before leaning in herself, just enough to prove her interest. And if she narrows her eyes just this way, lets just the touch of a smile curl her lip just so, then she'll really sell it—this casual cruelty that the senior members of Atlas's forces love. ""The last war, huh?"" *The one we lost*. ""Well, if we all do our part, maybe this one will end a little better."" She readjusts her posture. ""I'd better get going, make her proud and all. The satyr?"" she prods. 

The dracanae gives her a description: Brown-haired, been sniffing around their end of the river, all the satyr-y bits, a t-shirt with words on it, and carrying a bag. It's just in time, because Morgan can't hold onto her Emilia impression that long.

She lets the mask drop—and it is just a mask, just an impression, just her doing what it takes to win some around these people. If there's nothing to replace the mask, no animated smugness or an exaggerated roll of her eyes, then that's because Morgan is focused. 

It's not because whenever there's no one looking at her, Morgan feels like she might as well be back in the deep sea trenches they fled to after losing the battle. Through the cold and the dark and the miserableness, Morgan imagined herself one tiny morsel swimming around in a cold primordial soup of defeated monsters. Nothing going for her, nothing to gun for. 

Good thing Atlas fished her out of that sludgy existence. Gave her back the sun and something to do. 

Morgan just has to find this satyr. 

***

Morgan takes a couple bets on his location. A bag could mean he goes to a school. That's how that idiot Branch, Morgan's supposed satyr protector, had identified her. She finds the camp's bend in the river, tracks a hiking trail back to a neighborhood, and finds the corresponding school district. If she allows for the amount of time it takes to dust off her brand new backpack and change into the fresh clothes that'll allow her to blend in, she can get there around three, and she thinks most schools end around that time. 

She misses when she was a dumb recruit who didn't have to plan this shit. In those days, when she walked and walked to the bus stop and took the bus and still ended up in the wrong spot, she could just blame it on another soldier. 

This school apparently ends their day just before three, so Morgan's bus gets stopped in the traffic of dozens of idiot teenage drivers before she can get there. 

But surely, the satyr could still be here. Do satyrs drive? And besides, would a satyr be the first out of a school? Didn't she used to see Branch spend a weird amount of time at her school in Tampa, eyeing her and talking to counselors and joining random clubs? 

*He'll be here. The world owes me some fucking luck.*

Lots of kids are still hanging around waiting to be picked up or talking to each other when Morgan heads in. Morgan watches them slouch as she walks through the halls, pass around phones, laugh or gossip or look bored. A group of girls sit on the floor for some reason. One with long blonde hair looks her way, raises an eyebrow, and turns back to the group to giggle. Morgan realizes she'd been looking at them. 

What the fuck is she doing. 

She glares back, but it's way too late. That just means she's been looking at them longer too. She's not even *here* to talk to girls who think they're the shit. She's not even here to talk to any dumbass teenager! 

She's supposed to find the one who isn't, the one who's out of place, like she is. The only one who has some inkling of the hidden world she knows about, of sieges and monsters and war. Then she just needs to...

There. Some kids with words on their shirts. Two have brown hair. Close enough to the description the dracanae gave. 

""Hey,"" she says. They look at her weird. Morgan doesn't care. ""I'm new here, I was wondering if—""

The boy who talks to her is possibly grosser than anyone she's ever met. Definitely younger—ugh, *freshmen*—and he sniffles like he needs to blow his nose and his shirt has something way too nerdy on it. But worse than anything is the look in his eyes, like she's an opportunity. 

Morgan has learned not to like that look, because she was always alone as a child and then got prettier as she grew and then she ended up in a war camp where everyone seemed to have something to prove, usually violently. She tightens her fist, reminding herself that she's fucking, like, Superman compared to these shits. 

""Say six seven,"" he says. 

""Why?"" If this is some trick, something that will curse her, one of those words with power— wait. Mortals don't have those. 

""Just say it."" He looks at her like he's holding in laughter. Morgan eyes the rest of the group. The only other girl there looks apologetic, but also a little amused. Morgan can see the bounce in her pigtails as she fails to hold in laughter. 

""It would be kind of funny,"" she offers. ""But it's really stupid.""

""Six seven?"" Morgan says. They burst out laughing, repeat it in some inane voice. The boy who first talked adds some hand gesture. Morgan can't help but sag in her relief. There were worse things than being singled out because she wouldn't understand a joke. 

Her pleasant surprise continues as the girl explains that their school had caught back onto a meme from ages ago and they show her a video and it turns out this is exactly the kind of dumb shit she thinks is funny. She doesn't even have to worry about associating herself with cringey losers—Morgan will never go to this school, she doesn't have to climb any social ladder. 

""Do you know anyone who like, goes to the river? Maybe hikes?"" They think this is a weird question, of course. Morgan doesn't respect them enough to worry about their opinion. 

""Oh!"" the girl says. ""The activism club has a thing with the river lately.""

They turn into themselves to discuss this matter, talking about who even cared about the activism club because it only had like one member, and how the girl only knew because she'd been hanging up their own poster, because they were also starting a club and would Morgan like to join it and play their game that was a little like DnD but modified to be more artsy because they didn't like the violence and it was called so and so, but Morgan had walked away. 

***

*Nature spirits for a cleaner river!*

Morgan sighs when she sees it, wonders if this is really the best that Camp Half-Blood has to send. She follows the posters until one names a classroom and then follows the classroom numbers until she finds two-oh-seven and enters to find the activism club— and her mark. She just needs to make herself as obvious as possible. 

""Nature *spirits*?"" she questions. She eyes the kids in the room, waiting for one of them to jump up, point at their hooves and say *yes, absolutely! You've found us*. But neither of them have horns or hats to hide their horns, and they truly look young, naivety shining in their eyes. 

""*Do* you know why we call it nature spirits?"" one asks the other. They're cutting something up with scissors.

""I don't know, it was like that when I got here. Did you call it that?"" 

They both turn to the part of the room Morgan had missed, because she hadn't expected anyone there behind the desk. He is wearing a baseball cap, and his hair is brown only in the barest sense of the word, because if Morgan had described him she would find it more notable that it's also shot through with gray. She supposes age wouldn't be a dracanae's concern. 

As Morgan considers the satyr in front of her, he seems to be considering her back, and gives a slow tilt of his head. He's not very old by any means—she supposes that's why he can still get away with wearing a cheesy shirt with his *Nature spirits for a cleaner river!* slogan—but his eyes crinkle kindly. 

His voice, when he speaks, is also gentle. ""Would *you* have any guess as to why I call it that?"" 

Morgan is reminded unexpectedly of Bill, the man who lived next door to her her entire childhood. It's a very unwelcome reminder. The vial burning a hole in her pocket burns hotter. ""Yes,"" she says icily. 

""Well then, students, I'm going to speak to our guest for a moment."" He winks at them conspiratorially. ""Don't worry, I'll try to get her to join the club."" 

They smile back, one nods at her encouragingly, and Morgan must face the fact that this—is he a teacher?—is very well-liked. 

""Not actually,"" he says with a chuckle once the door is closed and they are alone in the hall. ""So...""

""I—"" How did demigod stories usually go? ""I've been on the run.""

He nods. ""Well, you're here now. Good thing you saw my sign.""

""It's not very subtle.""

""Well, it's not supposed to be. Those who need to can find me, those who don't, well, they think it's silly. And the movement is real, you know. Some students join because they know the the pollution of the Mississippi has reached such a critical point, while you and I, we know the danger to the naiads. It leaves them very sick."" 

""Tell me about it."" Morgan did not feel well after her two days of training in the Mississippi either. The satyr takes her distaste for something else.

""Sorry. You said you've been on the run. I'm here to help."" His concern is painfully genuine even as his tone stays conversational, like she might run if he doesn't hide it from her. 

It makes it all the easier to let her face fall, and from then the effect snowballs. Morgan fixes her gaze on the hem of his shirt until her eyes burn red like she might cry, then looks up, clenching her jaw like she's trying to stop herself. The full picture of a demigod trying not to fall apart at the first sign of kindness. 

Morgan, indeed, waits for all this to become true, instead of a ploy to get him alone. She waits for the angel on her shoulder to take over, to have one of the surprises introduced to her today force her to stop. Anything from the good-humored freshmen or naive activism club, to the way this satyr turned out to be someone like Bill instead of someone like Branch, and that she might hate Bill now but a younger version of Morgan had wanted nothing more than to hear him say 'I'm here to help'. 

""Please,"" she says. There's a well of fear and helplessness in her gut just waiting to be drawn on. Morgan pours all of it into her act. ""I don't know where I'm supposed to go, I'm being chased I think—""

She doesn't stop when he promises to help, pops his head back in the classroom to say the club is over for today, and leads her to the teacher's lounge where they can talk safely. She doesn't suddenly feel that personable spark when he tells her to call him Mr. Henry, or when she gives him some fake name in return. Guilt doesn't overtake her as he offers Morgan a seat in a comfortable chair and he takes a squeaky plastic one that looks like its on its last legs. She doesn't feel the overwhelming urge to confess when a steaming cup of tea is placed in front of her. Morgan doesn't really feel anything. 

""You okay?"" he asks. ""You're staring. Did you want coffee instead?"" He gestures at his own cup. 

Had she been staring? Zoned out? 

No. No, if she'd been staring, it was just because she was thinking about how to finish the job. She touches her cup, expecting to want to wrap her hands around it for the warmth, but that urge evaporates immediately. Being cold right now is better. 

The satyr breaks the silence again. ""I forgot to ask- are you hurt? I have some ambrosia."" Morgan shakes her head before she can think better, before he adds, ""godly food, it heals,"" on at the end, and her interest is piqued. Morgan has rationed the hunter's vial of nectar like gold, and here this satyr just has it lying around. 

""I, I haven't gotten hurt yet, but can it really do that? Heal me?""

""Yeah. You just have to be careful. I hear too much is also bad for you."" 

""Do you think I could have some? Just in case?"" She hopes her interest looks pitiful and desperate instead of opportunistic. 

He looks longingly at his coffee, but stands up. ""I'll have to keep some, for the next one like you. Not that we get many these days. It's not a good time for demigods to be running around..."" 

*Because we have them*, Morgan thinks. She knows some are being recruited straight out of schools like this. But Henry the satyr won't have to be concerned about it for much longer. 

While he looks through the cupboards, she twists the cap off the vial with one hand in her pocket. She bites her lip when there's a tiny sound of fractured glass—Morgan does not always know her strength. But it's just the cap bit, and the contents don't spill, and he doesn't hear. She reaches over and pours the liquid silently into the coffee. 

A second later she is presented with a cube of the mysterious ambrosia, barely more than a square inch. ""Thank you,"" she says earnestly. She brings her cup to her lips, wants to remind him of his own. 

She can't drink anything right now, but he does. Knocks it back like it's a whiskey at the end of a long day.

Morgan waits a bit. Listens to him say something about a satyr network and a place she can stay the night. 

It was too easy. ""Say, uh, you feeling okay?"" 

The satyr nods slowly. 

She does take a second to look him over, inspects his face for signs of a cold sweat or his mouth for whatever it looked like when someone started foaming at the mouth. 

""Huh. The tea isn't sitting right with me, I think."" She didn't drink it. She can't fathom drinking anything at the moment, knowing how easy it was to do this. 

""Like how?""

""Like uh, like it's sitting weird."" She eyes him, waiting for the agreement, any sign of the effects. It's not regret exactly, but perhaps the same urge that makes people poke at their own wounds, that makes her ask, ""Do satyrs have anything like ambrosia? Y'know, fast healing skills?""

""Why?""

""You know, like, if you weren't feeling well."" He looks slightly amused.

""Not to my knowledge. The satyr life span doesn't work like yours, though. We're nature spirits. When we finish breathing, we return to nature and live again as something new."" He sounds reflective. ""Like some heroes do. But for us, there's no need, even, for the trials and moral judgements in your afterlife. I like to think it's what we are granted in exchange for devoting our lives to you."" 

Morgan can only stare blankly at that. Certainly, this kind of selflessness hadn't been the case with Branch. He had hated his job, hated her, and called in the kidnapping squad at her first refusal. 

She scoffs. ""Right, yeah. And we have to prove ourselves."" 

""You'll do fine,"" Mr. Henry assures her. Huh. He still isn't foaming at the mouth or anything. ""What's the worst you can do, as long as you're well-intentioned? Trust me. That's all it takes to be a hero.""

Only Morgan is in far too deep for that. No trial would end well for her. That's why she's banking on the world Atlas has in store for them. 

""All this to say, we'll get you to Camp Half-Blood safely, Shannon. There's no need to be nervous."" 

Morgan frowns before remembering the fake name she gave. God, it'd really been *so* easy. It's almost funny. 

""It'd be really crazy if, you know, there was something weird in these cups or something."" She makes a show of looking into her own, as if the tea hasn't steeped so long she can't see the bottom. 

Mr. Henry looks at her weird. 

""Or in your, uh, coffee machine. Do you even know where that comes from?"" He hazards a peek over his shoulder at the coffee machine. Evidently, no. ""I saw this post once, online. This guy was talking about how much he loved like, the special rice from his rice cooker, and then he opened it and found a bunch of fried lizards inside.""

""That's- lovely. Yes. But I don't think there are lizards in the staff coffee machine.""

""Hm. You're right. But you're feeling fine, still?"" 

Morgan will laugh about it someday, this stupid conversation. She'll laugh about it because Mr. Henry won't matter because she'll be living in a world where poisoning satyrs isn't evil. She'll tell the story of this whole day, make this moment into a real knee-slapper, and then some monster next to her will joke about why demigod fingers taste better when grilled. That's the world that's coming, and Morgan will not be one step behind it.

""Yes, of course. Are you?"" He looks really confused. 

""Yeah. Look, man, thanks for the tea, but I'm not staying a night here. It doesn't—"" Morgan has almost forgotten her act. She reminds herself to stick the landing. ""It feels too exposed. I'm leaving town, I have to keep going."" 

""Oh, hey, there's no need to rush out."" He stands when Morgan does. She stuffs the ambrosia in her pocket, makes a big show of picking up her bag. 

""No, look, I have to. I just want to be somewhere *safe*. I have an aunt in Morgan City—"" It's a real place, she saw it on a map, ""—she'll let me stay. Find me there if you're really worried. Otherwise, why should I even trust you? Why should I go to camp?"" 

Rushed, sloppy execution, but that's fine. He seems to believe it. Oh, he looks *really* worried. Perfect then. 

""Thanks for everything,"" she throws over her shoulder. And if, finally, her throat burns with those words, if she feels some regret for the satyr who's only crime was trying to help some naiads, it's easy to ignore. He follows her out, but she quickens her pace, and she thinks he gives up when they pass a janitor because they'd probably look suspicious. If she's really lucky, he'll go to Morgan City before dying and New Orleans will be off anyone's radar. 

Morgan wants to believe the tide will be in her favor. After all, she's been on top of the fucking world lately. ",3,1765675847.0,CampHalfBloodRP,1,1.0,False

1pm1ork,https://www.reddit.com/r/pericarditis/comments/1pm1ork/spouse_was_diagnosed_with_pericarditis_seeking/,spouse was diagnosed with Pericarditis (seeking advice and support),"hi everyone, sorry for the long post (slight vent, seeking advice, success stories and support) I've been reading, soaking up info, and other's experiences non-stop.

on Dec07 my spouse (29M) had a slight fainting spell that was mostly dizziness and that led to high palpitations (140 bpm), he's a very anxious person so it was difficult to help him relax once he got scared by his own pounding heart.

two days after that, on Dec09, after several tests he was diagnosed with acute viral pericarditis (his kidneys, liver and heart reacted to the virus), his kidneys and liver are overall fine, there's no tumors or abscesses, just slight viral inflammation and was told to drink at least 8 glasses of water per day (also husband has a history of hepatitis so it's not unusual for his liver to show some inflammation whenever he's gotten sick)

his heart in general (and all of this other tests) were ruled out as ""within normal range for an adult male"" so all ok, except for the pericarditis.

the doctor says we caught it early and other than the on-and-off pain in his chest or upper back and high palpitations he doesn't have any other symptoms—he's not out of breath (can speak normally, shower, get dressed just fine) or in excruciating pain, he's not having cold sweats, swollen legs, fainting/dizzying spells, nor tremors.

he doesn't drink alcohol/energy drinks, and only used to have some coffee every other day (it was mostly milk), but has now fully quit coffee and the odd soda.

he was prescribed Colchicine x2/day for 1 month, Vitamin C and Bisoprolol x1/day, and a stomach protector for as long as needed. I see everyone say they were prescribed Ibuprofen too, but he's scared to take it because of his liver—he started treatment on Dec09, so it's been just five days, while he's had some slight stomach issues that seem to be resolving, and the Bisoprolol seems to be helping his palpitations...albeit slowly (went down from 130bpm and now seems to go from 110 to 92bpm throughout the day), and while he's calm enough during daytime (reads, watches tv shows, even plays video games) he's still terribly anxious especially at nighttime something makes him nervous and his heart goes up to 120-130bpm again—I do my best to help him calm down, we're even sleeping with the lights on, and he manages to calm some after about an hour (HR around 111 usually) and then falls asleep. The heart palpitations and his own fear have been the hardest part of this, he goes through a few crying moments throughout the day, too. He's not one to cry so easily, so seeing him like this breaks my heart.

while the doctor's attitude has been very upbeat about it all, and even said he didn't need to be completely sedentary, and I know a friend who had pericarditis and was fine after a 1 month long treatment, the whole situation of seeing my other half go through all of this and being told it's his heart left me both incredibly sad and scared.

I do my best to stay strong for him and help, I stay positive and have been very adamant that he's to rest, don't let him do anything but go to the bathroom and slowly walk downstairs once or twice a day (he likes to sit under the sun, it helps him relax), I don't know what else to do—ask for Ibuprofen? Turmeric tea? At times I'm calm, try to think rationally and tell myself he'll be okay, but then I get hit by this wave of sadness and have to force back tears.

I don't really know what I'm doing, but I needed to get it all off my chest. Please, what are your happy stories? Do you have any advice or words of comfort? I'd really appreciate it 🥲💔 My heart goes out to all of you going through this.",1,1765675684.0,pericarditis,0,1.0,False

1pm1mm5,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1pm1mm5/how_to_express_myself_emotionally_better/,How to express myself emotionally better?,"I’m a fairly socially awkward mid-late 20s M who only started dating ~3.5 years ago after finishing college/landing my stable job. Definitely a bit of confidence struggles in starting late, and I often fell back on the excuse of not wanting a known end/long distance date of graduation. 

I’m 5’8” and reasonably fit, but not muscular. Given my awkwardness meeting people out of the blue the first time and lack of experience, I have relied exclusively on dating apps to this point as I try to find someone who I’d want to spend the rest of my life with. 

If I spend about 5 hours in a week on apps, I can usually get a conversation started with someone I’m interested in with about a 1/4 chance of it turning into a first date (not really drinking/coffee makes that a bit tougher). However, I consistently get the impression after going out once or twice, I start to struggle somewhat to come up with things to talk about and almost universally, that I am fully expressing myself emotionally. The one time I’ve had something last more than 5 dates even directly told me that I am “very kind and generous, but it is difficult to generate any sort of emotional connection with” me. I definitely feel a connection myself, but it is clear others aren’t. What can I do to express myself emotionally better outwardly? What can I expect to see/pick up on to see if I’m on the right track?

TL;DR: socially awkward guy looking for a better way to express himself emotionally ",1,1765675507.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False
