Packed with essential minerals, vitamins, and antioxidants, it‚Äôs a powerful ally in supporting overall health. Here are a few ways to incorporate it into your routine:

1. Make Sea Moss Gel

* How to Prepare: Soak the dried sea moss overnight, rinse it, then blend with water until smooth.
* How to Use: Add a spoonful of the gel to smoothies, coffee, tea, or juices for a nutritious boost. The gel lasts up to 2 weeks in the fridge!

2. Add to Foods üç≤

Use sea moss gel as a thickener for soups, sauces, and stews. Its texture blends well, adding creaminess without altering flavor. For those following keto, it works great as an egg white substitute in certain recipes.

3. Enhance Your Skincare

Sea moss gel can be used topically. Apply a thin layer as a face mask for 15-20 minutes, then rinse with lukewarm water. This helps hydrate, balance skin tone, and provides a natural glow!

4. Boost Nutrition

For a quick nutrient intake, simply add Moroccan Gold Sea Moss to salads as a crunchy topping, or stir into your favorite salad dressings for a mineral-rich twist.

With its almond-like flavor and mild sea undertone, Moroccan Gold Sea Moss adds both taste and a wealth of nutrients to your diet.

$15 flat in town, willing to consider driving longer distance.

I drove professionally as a delivery driver here in Bloomington/Normal for 10 years for various restaurants. Have never had a suspension or DUI. Learned roadside maintenance on the job and eventually started just doing most work on my car myself.


About my car: It's a fairly well kept Gen 2 Prius from 2006. In its prime at 128k miles. Up on all maintenance, recently just flushed coolant, replaced hybrid battery with a brand new aftermarket upgraded pack, changed sparkplugs and oil. Brake pads are due next oil change. Clean interior with seat covers and bluetooth radio adapter you can use if you want. Hatchback with great capacity. I can fit 8' boards in here with it closed, or at least $1000 worth of Chinese food.

for over a year i make my pour over with a **Kalita Wave** and a **Timemore Sculptor 078s.** Mostly I use a washed coffee from Nicaragua with flavors of cherry and honey. My recipe is 60g blooming, 30sec, up to 250g, 30sec, up to 400g, 30sec and finally to 500g in about 3:15 to 3:30 min with 30g of coffee in. The taste is about absolute clear drink with a good amount of acidity and notes from honey in the end. No bitterness in the drink.

Recently, I only use my Sculptor for Espresso Shots and switched for filter on a **Fellow Ode Gen 2.** I use the same recipe as above, but with any type of grind size, I only get flat and bitter drinks. Very small flavors of cherry are there, but maybe a quarter of the drink with the Sculptor. Moreover, I played a bit with temperature from 90 to 95 degrees Celsius. Originally I used 95.

For now, I ""seasoned"" the Fellow with approx. 2kg of Beans, but at this point there is no light at the end.

**Any ideas what I could do, to get away of the flat bitterness?** Is there such a big difference between the Sculptor and the Ode? I mean, there are both flat burrs, originally in a same price range. Only the size of the burrs is a point.",1,1730721697.0,pourover,0,1.0,False

Hi! I've had the majority of my setup for a little over a year, but in general, I'm still new-ish to espresso-making as I'm almost completely self-taught. 

Recently I've not been enjoying my coffee as much. I think as I've getting more lattes from local places (instead of Starbucks lol), I've been able to recognize the quality difference or something? Regardless, the past few times I've made my lattes at home, they've tasted watered down, or just in general not as ""rich"" in flavor.

Is my equipment just not good enough? Or is it a technique I'm missing? I just wanna be able to make quality coffee at home so I don't have to go keep spending $6 a latte elsewhere ü•≤

  
\-My process-

1. Turn the machine to the ""steaming"" setting, allowing that to warm up as I prepare everything else
2. put a scoop of pre-ground espresso into my porta-filter (I've been using the double-shot portafilter that came with the machine).
3. level out the espresso by turning the tamper on the non-smooth side, and then making sure its flat by pressing down with the smooth-side
4. Use the spring-loaded tamper to pack in the espresso more (Though most the time it doesn't feel like the tamper handle moves much, and so it seems like just a repeat of step 3)
5. Once the light on the machine is green, I steam my milk (usually about 8oz of 2% milk) until the thermometer reaches the middle of the green
6. Purge and clean my steaming wand
7. switch over to the espresso setting, and brew until the espresso reaches about the 2oz (sometimes more) line on my espresso measuring cup 
8. pour my espresso into my cup with Torani Syrups (I try to stay as sugar free as possible)
9. pour my steamed milk into the cup

 - slightly reduced anxiety
 - deeper sleep, no waking up
 - better mind-muscle connection at the gym
 - reduced side effects of caffeine
 - reduced procrastination, which reduces my anxiety further
 - helps me use my judgment more instead of my emotions

Effects of my mother:
 - dream supressant, no more nightmares
 - deeper sleep
 - lower heart rate
 - reduced bed-time anxiety

I take a 500 mg withanolide generic with 10mg piperine. 

Other supplements I take:
 - Magnesium
 - Vitamin D 
 - Caffeine in form of coffee

Supplements I've dropped:
 - CBD (greatly reduced my anxiety, but increased my appetite and reduced my attention span)

I recommend replacing CBD and melatonin with Ashwaghanda.",1,1730721242.0,Supplements,1,1.0,False

Backstory and advice needed 

I‚Äôve had chronic UTIS for the past 2 almost 3 years. They come every 4 months, sometimes every 2 months. Before they were because of latex condoms (I have very sensitive skin and assume that was why), they stopped for a bit then started up again. After 3ish times I went to the doctor and I had ovarian cysts (17 at the time) that ruptured and were probably causing them. Now no matter what I do, proper hygiene, pee after sex, not even having sex for a week or more I still get them. I take cranberry pills and try to keep my sugar down and don‚Äôt drink coffee. Can anyone please help me? I‚Äôve stayed up entire nights (12-8 am) because AZO tablets (ultra strength and taking 2 at a time, if the time passes even 4), 2 arthritis Tylenol AND ibuprofen don‚Äôt work until much later (I take at 12 am they don‚Äôt work until 9 am or so, but with other pain they work almost immediately) they aren‚Äôt super super painful or filled with blood, but the right amount of discomfort to cry over. Please someone help me, I feel like they are ruining my life and sleep schedule. 
Also to clarify my boyfriend is very clean and I make sure he is I highly doubt he is the sole problem (like I said we will test and not have sex for 2 weeks and still I will get a UTI)

Also I‚Äôve been having UTI like symptoms (urge to pee) and the culture came back as not a UTI. please can anybody tell me if they think this is something more? My doctors keep dismissing me and I feel like it could be something more like a kidney infection (they can last for years) Please tell me if this is ‚Äúnormal‚Äù or if anyone can relate!!!!

EDIT: I was put on birth control (Kelnor) to help with the cysts and they shouldn‚Äôt be the cause

I tried to google this, but all I could find on the topic revolved around breakfast, specifically, and how taking Vyvnase with a meal can prolong the absorption rate and peak time (not quite sure what peak time means). Furthermore, a lot of people said if they DON'T eat before/with their dose the effects kicked in faster and felt stronger. Some people cited that they experienced more 'negative' side effects. But then stated that if they DO eat before/with dose they wont feel the 'positive' effects at all or are lessened greatly. 

This confuses me... I usually wake up 3-3.5 hours before I have to leave for work and I take my dose, with water, first thing so it has ample time to kick in. Typically I don't eat breakfast but will have two cups of coffee. I don't really experience any of the aforementioned 'negative' side effects so the empty stomach issue some people get doesn't seem to apply here. But, if I do decide I want to eat breakfast, I CERTAINLY don't want to have to go to work for 9 hours and feel none of the benefits! My job is labor and mental intensive sooo that won't go well lol

To my question; If I take my dose at, lets say 6am, on an empty stomach, wait the two hours for it to be fully absorbed and kicked in, then decide at 10am I do want to eat, will eating food after that absorption window impact the efficacy? Will food lessen the potency or the length of time you will experience the therapeutic benefits?

Like she couldn't even wait 20 seconds to let the poor boy speak the most horrific confession on stand for the first time. Then she hounded him again and again about where he was in relation to the coffee table. It was unbearable! Her constant sassy remarks in court may be funny now, but I have a feeling it would have annoyed the jury at the time, may have come across as attention seeking behaviour, she clearly enjoyed having the audience there.

There are also some parts they decided to include that just weakened the gravity of Erik's situation that led to it being made a mockery of by un-compassionate people. Like making Erik share the fact he'd use a lot of lemon, or sneak cinammon into his dad's coffee, or that he would try to bake his mother a cake and burned it so she beat him up. These could all be true, but they're so over the top, they weakened their case in a way I think. I also really hated that they kept using the term 'sex' when they were referring to the rape and abuse. Words have power and sex is absolutely the wrong word to use, even if that's how jose described it.

With Lyle, idk why, but his testimony just completely rips my heart into pieces I absolutely have no doubt those emotions were real. So why is it, with Erik's testimony, I felt like it came across insincere and performative; almost a bit cringey? My guess is that it comes down to Jill's delicate and sensitive style.

Also the statements they remember from those nights sound too much from a screenplay. Like ""Why should I help him? No body helped me"" ""You think I didn't know? I've known all along"" ""We all make decisions in life, son. Erik made his and you made yours"" Idk they felt fake, and I feel like their lawyers told them to say these things to try and tell a good story.

The Suit sat across the coffee table in my living room. I was in a chair and Jane laid on her back next to the suit on my couch.

The Suit silently reached into his pocket and pulled out a small black bag with zippers. He held it up. It was a small travel pouch with no logo. ""Here's a riddle for you, Mr. Foreman. How many people are in this room right now?""

""How many...people?"" I stared at the Suit through his dark sunglasses. His head was titled as he unzipped the bag but I did not have the angle to catch a glimpse of his eyes.

""How many people are in this room right now?"" The Suit asked again.

I glanced at Jane, but she was quietly staring at my celling once again. ""Ugh. Three of us?""

""That's usually the first guess people give,"" the Suit said. He removed a glass syringe that was pitch black in color. A plastic wrapping kept its needle sterilized. The vicious fluid in the small glass tank resembled black tar. ""I'm curious to see if your answer will go up or down once I tell you about her.""

Out of the corner of my eye, I thought I saw Jane wince.

""You should know that Jane is not human.""

I sighed. ""Somehow I thought this was one of those jobs that go 'there.' So is the answer to your riddle 2, or is there something you want to tell me?""

The Suit only smiled in response. ""Jane is one of a kind."" He almost sounded like he was calling the name of a pet dog. ""Jane, would you mind demonstrating?""

""No thanks,"" Jane said quietly.

""Then I suppose you'll have to settle for me telling you, Mr. Foreman. Jane is quite modest in front of people. Right now she's flesh and blood as this petite woman with striking features and an abrasive manner of speaking, but this is what she truly is.""

The Suit placed the syringe on the coffee table. Beneath my living room lights, it sat unassumingly still.

""What is that stuff?""

""That..."" The Suit pointed at me. ""...Is a question this government has invested a tremendous amount of time and money into investigating. The short answer is that this black fluid is the material composing Jane's body. If you look at it under a microscope, it resembles a clump of stem cells are at rest in a liquid state but can very easily turn solid. Long story short, when these cells are exposed to a source of human DNA, they can mimic it perfectly and then form an indistinguishable replica of a human being.

""Are you saying that if she touches me, she could imitate me?""

""Not quite,"" The Suit said. ""It's not so efficient as that, but you get the idea.""

""So did she always....look like that?""

""No,"" Jane said firmly. ""Next question, please.""

I looked at the suit.

""Where did she come from?""

""The Black Lagoon,"" Jane said flatly.

""She's joking,"" the Suit said. ""Jane was born in Florida, much like yourself, Mr. Foreman.""

""Oh,"" I said, feeling the tension in my own voice. ""Where at? I'm Ft. Lauderdale.""

""Tampa,"" Jane said, unenthusiastically.

The Suit spoke again. ""My point is, Jane was an ordinary woman up until she was exposed to this material on a mission. She was a once a bit of a rising star in our organization looking to contain or eliminate the supernatural. But unfortunately, she came across a being made of this material. I told you that these cells can replicate human DNA when given a source. It used Jane. All of Jane, to be precise.""

""He's trying to say, I was eaten,"" Jane said flatly. ""At least it was in the line of duty.""

""Jane went from being our star agent to our star subject. Our entire department abandoned its former subjects and re-allocated all of our resources to determining what the hell Jane had found. This material was indeed eating her from the inside out, flesh and bone alike, but we had no idea how or why. At first, we thought that this black fluid was a virus of some sort or a flesh-eating bacteria.""

""My God."" I looked at Jane in horror. ""Is...is she contagious?""

""If only,"" Jane said.

""Relax, Mr. Foreman. Biohazard controls were put in place, but do you want to know the astonishing part of all this? The fluid only attacked Jane's cells. Even attempts to weaponize this as a biochemical agent failed - if this is a virus, then it seems as though only one person may have it at any time. More akin to a curse than anything else. For some reason, Jane's consciousness controls these things, even after they consumed her actual body. She's a like a lighthouse leading ships. It's a good thing all those years in the hospital hooked up to tubes and wires didn't make you into a raving lunatic, eh Jane?""

""Yeah, yeah,"" Jane said.

""Did you say you tried to weaponize this stuff?"" I stared at the syringe on my coffee table, not far from a cold cup of Columbian medium roast. ""Isn't that war crime?""

""Yes,"" the Suit said smugly. ""For what it's worth, part of the reason we did that was as justification to allow Jane to leave that facility. She was a medical prisoner for 12 years, Mr. Foreman. Jane killed one of the doctors treating her. Accident or no accident, there are plenty of people who believe she should have stayed locked away. What do you think?""

""I think....you're paying me. So my opinion doesn't matter.""

""Good boy,"" Suit said. ""Now, as I've said, there are plenty of members within the organization that are fierce opponents of Jane's release from the facility designed to study and contain her. They've entered a Cold revolt against our Director, and Jane has been tasked with bringing them back into the fold. Your mission-

'-if you choose to accept it,"" Jane said, cutting off the Suit mid-sentence. Her grin was ironic. ""Not that you're in a position to turn it down.""

The suit scowled and spoke again. ""Your job is to go with her, you and whatever team you see fit, and then provide crowd control to minimize casualties. Each scientist has an invaluable amount of knowledge that is not easily replaced. Above all, you have to protect Jane while she works.""

""Protect her?"" I shook my head. ""Let me get this straight. You all work for a spooky organization and you're at each other's throats. Classic civil war. The fact that you're turning to outside help means your side's the one on the back foot. How am I doing?""

""Not bad!"" Jane said giddily. ""Not bad at all.""

I looked at Jane. ""If you can do anything to anyone, why do you need to bother putting down this rebellion?""

""Because the people rebelling are doing this because they see me as existential threat. I'm not made to be a fugitive, and if given enough time, they'll come after me anyway.""

""Alright,"" I said, turning back to the Suit. ""The rest of it I understand, but you make it sound like she's immortal. How am I supposed to protect her?""

""The facility in question knows full well that we will send Jane to stop their little tantrum, so it's logical that they're working day and night to figure out a way to kill her or neutralize her.""

""This Director they're rebelling against. Has he tried to kill Jane?""

""Many times,"" Jane said. ""He gave up after incinerating me didn't work. His lack of success convinced him to stop trying.""

""So Jane crushes this revolt, then your Director wins by centralizing control. And if they manage to kill Jane, then his number one problem goes away and he starts handing out pardons.""

""You're not as dumb as I pegged you initially, Dwight,"" Jane said. The compliment was backhanded, but Jane seemed earnestly happy that I understood that she was between a rock and a hard place.

""That checks out,"" I said. ""But suppose they've made something to take her on. What am I supposed to do against anything they've made that she can't already handle?""

""It's really quite simple. Jane's able, even capable. But the facility in question and the people running it spent years theorizing ways to kill Jane, and we can't risk having all of our eggs in one basket in case they've finally succeeded. In addition to everything else, we're paying you to act as our Ace in the Hole. We need you to carry a piece of Jane in the event she's overcome. And I don't mean carry it in your pocket."" The Suit reached forward, and slid the syringe across the coffee table.

""I already told you she's not contagious. Her sentience lives in every piece of her, and while her personality is quite toxic once you get to know her, Jane has perfected her ability to exist within another human's body unobtrusively - she learned many hard lessons when she killed that doctor. Tragic figure, beautiful, didn't agree with the experiments but volunteered because she was Jane's friend when she was the star agent. Better you hear this from us than the late Doctor's friends in the facility. That's whose face and body Jane wears now. ""

Jane made herself as small as possible.

I stared at the needle, then the motionless fluid in its body, then looked back at the Suit in horrified astonishment.

""Still don't get it? Inject that into your arm."" The Suit smiled from ear to ear. ""Whichever one you use less, of course.""

""You...you're insane if you think I'm injecting that into my arm!"" My hand instinctively went towards my concealed holster.

Jane's eyes widened slightly, not out of fear but genuine concern.

""We didn't come here to fight. I promise you that trying to shoot me will only bring the police here, and we all have enough problems to deal with right now."" Jane closed her eyes. ""Look, I can speak first hand at how terrifying it is to have something alien inside of you. Believe me when I say that I don't want to do that to anyone else for no reason, and never lightly. The people in the facility experimented on me for 12 years and want me dead, so I'm not in short supply of enemies. Don't kid yourself into thinking I have any reason to make more than I already have.

""Maybe you should have done the talking from the start,"" the Suit said ironically.

""Please just shut up,"" Jane said, before speaking to me again. ""What'd you say earlier? This is one of those jobs that go, there. Yeah, I don't have a perfect track record being a freak of nature, but that's where the bitcoin comes in. We're not the good guys, but we didn't come here to rip you off, either. So right now you can pick a fight that no one wants, or you can take $5 million in exchange for a calculated risk. And I'll sweeten the deal with one other thing.""

I looked at her pensively. ""Oh yeah, what's the cherry on top?""

""Leverage,"" Jane said. ""Money's great, but I'm asking you to put skin in the game by trusting me, and it would be wrong to make you do that in blind faith to anyone. There's nothing you can to do me, nothing's that hasn't been tried already. Whatever I do to you or your people would be temporary; would you consider accepting if I gave you something that I value more than my life? Temporarily, of course.""

I gritted my teeth. ""I would *consider.* What do you have to put down?""

Jane opened her eyes. ""I have a husband. HIs name is Nathan. He's not like me. He can't fight but he's, uh...he's all I've got that really matters anymore."" Jane said, looking pained. ""He's volunteered as leverage. If I try something, he's very much capable of dying. But that goes the other way too.""

""...What happens if I still say no?""

Jane looked frustrated. ""What more do you want? What more could you possibly need?""

""I've been in enough fights to know when to turn one down. I won't get my people killed fighting for you. I never asked for your money and can keep your husband. I'll send the bitcoin back, and you have my utmost respect for being honest with me about the risks. But my calculations tell me to say no. This is the part where I politely ask you to both to leave. Now.""

Jane glared at me. ""You were right when you said that our side is on the back foot. And I wasn't lying when I said this isn't work you get to turn down.""

""Leave. Now."" I removed my gun from my holster. "" I stood my ground. ""Like you said, none of of need the police on our backs.

""Shooting me won't do anything,"" Jane said bluntly.

""It really won't,"" The Suit said, austerely excited. ""Jane's tried that already.""

""Enough! I don't want anything to do with either of you. Any of you!"" I raised my gun, but did not point it at either of them just yet. ""Make this easy, just go. I won't ask again.""

""Make this easy, he says."" Jane scowled.

""So much for good cop, bad cop."" The Suit was smiling. ""You're losing your touch, Jane.""

Jane sighed. ""I really didn't want to give him a demonstration...I want you to know that I take no pleasure scaring people half to death. I read your psych evals - you're afraid of drowning. I tried being reasonable, but what I'm about to do you will feel just like drowning. Last chance to take the syringe.""

I thought back to my life in Florida. I remembered jumping of a pier into the water before I knew how to swim; I'd made a game of grabbing onto an inflatable tube, and it had almost cost me my life. I decided to jump in then, and I would do so again now.

""You're not doing anything to me, not without a fight.""

""Today's not the day to try facing your fears, Dwight.""

""I say it is,"" I pointed my gun at her. ""Whatever you are, you don't scare me. Jane.""

""That's because the scary part of me snuck around you.""

I turned around, and sure enough there was a undulating blob of what appeared to be living ink. It rested atop the head of my chair, and I wondered wildly how long it had been waiting there like a sword above my head while I'd been sitting. The whole time? Possibly.

""Oh shit!""

The ink lunged at me. I tried to point my gun at it but clamped onto my head. I heard a bullet discharge from my instinctive grasp, but the blob was already in my ears. I tried to scream but that let it enter my mouth. I clamped my eyes shut but it was going through my nose.

My lungs burned for air, and I felt myself sinking deeper and deeper and deeper. I reached out wildly for something to grab onto, something to keep me afloat, but if there‚Äôs been a way to avoid this than it had slipped through my grasp.

1gjc8az,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1gjc8az/trip_report_ukraine_in_2024/,Trip Report: Ukraine in 2024,"I hesitated quite some time to write about my Trip in Detail public but I guess half a year later it's time for it. There has been a Trip Report from someone else about [visiting Ukraine in 2023](https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/13ielov/trip_report_ukraine_in_2023/) which inspired me to also write about my experience this year. Iam Male 25 from Germany. I took the Trip in early May this year.

**Considerations pre Trip**  
I have been interested in off the beaten Track Destinations basically ever since it was possible for me to travel. I was last year in Norther Cyprus and Lebanon, so I had some limited experience with Solo traveling in non-Mainstream Locations. I was interested in visiting Ukraine for multiple years already, but first COVID put a hold on my Plans and then in 2022 the beginning of the Invasion. 2 years after that I was still interested and put many hours into researching if and how visiting Ukraine is possible and what are the risks that come with it. In the end, I can't and won't encourage anyone to go there. I took very careful considerations and came to the conclusion that I am willing to take a Trip not further east than Kiev and Maximum 1 Week, no longer. Influential was surely also that I know someone living in Kiev I was able to get some up-to-date information on how the situation is on the ground, and that I basically put so much time effort into researching, I could at one point not bail out and don't do it anymore, I was too deep into it.

**Planning the Trip**  
From all the research I did, I had a very good idea of how to do it. I then booked a Flight to Hungary, from where I was about to start the Rail Journey east. Hungarian MAV Rail 2nd Class to Zahony which is close to the Border to Ukraine and then a Border Train to a Town in Ukraine called Chop where immigration into Ukraine will happen. From there 1h Train to Mukachevo where I had booked a Hotel for a Night. Then on the next Day, 14.5 Hours Overnight Sleeper Train 1st Class to Kiev. I booked a Hotel in Kiev for 4 Nights, good Location in Downtown Kiev including breakfast. I left Kiev on a 10,5h IC Train to Przemy≈õl in Poland, which was connecting onto an 8,5h Overnight Sleeper Train of Regiojet to Prague. From there, Eurocity Train to Regensburg, which is the rough Region where I live. I was able to get a Ukrainian E-Sim from a Friend of mine which was a great help, I had basically unlimited Internet from the Moment of crossing the Border. I took around 350 Euros in Cash with me, even tho Creditcards are widely accepted in Ukraine, better safe than sorry. I took only the bare minimum of Stuff with me in my Carry on, no Laptop, No Camera only phone and clothes basically.

**Getting into Ukraine**  
My Trip started from Munich Airport, from where I took a Flight to Hungary. I had booked a Hotel close to the Train station in Budapest, my Train was departing the next Day. The Night was rather rough as I thought a lot about what I was about to be doing. I had only told a handful of Friends/Family Members about my Plans, not even my Mother (she would have been too scared unnecessarily). On the next Morning there was no return, I went onto the first train of many more to come and went east. During the ride, I started a conversation in broken English with a Ukrainian woman going back into Ukraine. She asked me why I was going into Ukraine and then just answered, ""We have Millions of Men in your Age wanting to leave Ukraine, but they can't, and you are entering just casually?"". That made me think of what I am doing here, truly. The first time during this Trip I considered abandoning my Plans, after some Hours I arrived at Zahony, where everyone has to disembark and then reenter the Train with a Passport Control of Hungarian Officers before. I had left the EU and was about to enter Ukraine. The Train started moving and after a Couple of hundred meters it drives on a Bridge above a River, which is the Border between Hungary and Ukraine and at the same time means a Time Difference of +1 Hour. My first time Zone Land crossing. The Station of Chop is not far after the Border and quite a contrast to the Hungarian Station a few Kilometers away. Now, the part I was scared the most of was about to come: Immigration into Ukraine. Obviously I had my full Travel Plans with me printed out on paper, the Details of my Friend I was about to meet in Kiev plus an explanation why I want to go into Ukraine based on that. Given the Situation and Stories I read online, I was nervous, but in the end, everything worked well. I was not asked a single Question during Passport Control and only a couple of Questions regarding my Carry on Goods (Cigarettes, Alcohol and Money in Cash) in Ukrainian during Customs Check I had to translate with Google Translate to know what they mean. I think I was not asked more questions, as no one there was able or wanted to speak English. Chop is a rather small crossing, I don't think many foreigners come through there. That was it, I was in Ukraine, a surreal feeling that remains till today. On that Day I had no more for this report interesting Memories. In the evening while walking through Downtown Mukachevo I saw the first signs of war: Pictures of fallen soldiers from the regions which were displayed on the Town Square.  
I have to add that since I boarded that Train in Zahony I was often looked at very strangely by Ukrainians, must have been for many quite interesting to see a non-Ukrainian 25-year-old Male heading into Ukraine, I bet some thought I am going to fight on the front. These stares and looks continued through my whole trip, reaching its peak on the Train leaving Ukraine.

**The long Journey to Kiev**  
As my Train to Kiev was not about to leave until 5 PM, I had the possibility to visit [Kosino](https://maps.app.goo.gl/VW8yJ1mfBx4nyd4U8), which is a very famous Thermal Spring Bath in Ukraine. I was told before the war it was packed all day, when I was there tho, it was not super busy, even tho it was orthodox Easter holidays. As Germans are usually like, I was way too early on the Platform of Mukachevo Train Station waiting for my Train. Before my Train arrived, there was another Sleeper Train also going east to a City I guess the world by now knows well about: Zaporizhzhia. Many Soldiers in Uniform were waiting together with their Wives and Children for that train. They embarked, said goodbye to their Family and went into war. Some if not many of the soldiers saw them for the last time there. When I realized what I am actually seeing, when I realized fully that there is a brutal war going on in the east, I was really considering for the 2nd time during this Trip if I should stay in Mukachevo for an additional Night and then go back into Hungary the next Day. Don't get me wrong here, I obviously was aware of the War and all the Situation in Ukraine, but seeing Men giving farewell to their Families before going into War where some of them will eventually die, that hit me different.  
My Train then eventually came, I embarked, got into my 1st class cabin and there I was, Solo on the longest Train Journey of my life so far towards Kiev. I sat on the Window for a couple of hours, admiring the absolute beautiful Scenery of the Carpathian Mountains. As I read afterward, I had taken there one of the most beautiful Trainroutes in the whole of Ukraine. After we Stopped in Lviv at around 1030PM, I tried to get some sleep, which I did succeed in after some time despite the constant movement and Noise in the Train. I had the luck of staying alone in the Cabin for the whole night, so I woke up well rested the next morning on the outskirts of Kiev.

**Kiev, the Capital**  
Kiev Train Station is quite straight forward. I got myself a very cheap Uber to my Hotel, checked in and then went towards Maidan by Metro. The Kiev Metro is an absolute masterpiece of soviet Infrastructure. A single Journey is as cheap as 19 Cents. Disembarking at Maidan and actually standing on the Square where 10 years ago the Maidan Protests were taking place which more or less lead towards the current situation, felt surreal and looking at the pictures still feels today. In new cities, I like to research some famous sight I want to see, but also just walk and see where I end up from time to time. That's how I spend my first Day in Kiev. I went from Maidan to [Mykhailivska ](https://maps.app.goo.gl/27JHfgk9UwRmh3dQ9)Square, where some completely destroyed Russian Military Vehicles and Tanks are displayed to remember the Attack on the City 2 years earlier. Walking by the nearly endless wall of Fallen Soldiers since 2014 there made me realize how long this brutal War had been going before the Invasion of 2022. Seeing these was another step of realization of what actually is going on in the country. This process would reach its peak later that Day. After a good but rather late Lunch, I went to the [Glass Bridge](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Bf4iMrMh2dg2h34o7) and enjoyed the View. Later that evening, I found out that this Bridge was bombed by the Russians some month prior, but it did not collapse. On my Way back to the Hotel, I walked to Maidan to get into the Metro from there. On Maidan however, was a large group of Soldiers and other People gathered around the [Independence Monument](https://maps.app.goo.gl/DsvwX9M9MxYaVdHg6). Coming closer, I realized that this was actually a funeral for a fallen Ukrainian Soldier. I carefully approached and joined the crowd rather towards the Edge for over an hour. I could not understand anything but what i saw was unlike anything i have ever experienced. Seeing the Monther of the fallen Soldier doing her speach under Tears was heartbreaking and deeply moving. What i guess was the Grandmother of the Soldier tried to make a speech aswell but she was unable to to do so and nearly collapsed while trying. Thats the final stage of my realization of how brutal War is and in which Situation this Country is in right now.  It was the 3rd time i considered aborting on the Spot and getting into Poland asap. Getting sorted mentally was not easy that evening as also on TV the majority of the Program is about War.

**Preparations for the Night**  
During the phase of the war when i took the Trip, the Russians mostly did fire Rockets and Drones going deep into the country only during the Night, which is why I was expecting an Attack each night. I had at all  Time a Backpack with me which had my Passport, a Powerbank, 1,5L Water and some Snacks in it. This would serve me in case I had to go into a Bunker for some Hours. This backpack was always ready to grab when I was in my Hotel Room. During my Trip, i closely monitored the situation in the Country via an App and the Telegram Channel of the Ukrainian Airforce. In case of an Alarm, they broadcast whats the reason for it there. The first and Second Night was uneventful. 

**Museums and bad Weather**  
During all my Trip so far the Weather has been amazing. 20-23¬∞ and no Clouds. That changed a bit on Day 2 in Kiev as i was greeted by some Drizzle. I continued to explore Maidan a little more and then went to the [National Military History Museum](https://maps.app.goo.gl/bk2hdgcQGo6UeQ6w6) which was a very Interesting experience. Right after entering the Museum i was finding an abandoned Ticket Desk. After some time a Guard came but he did not speak English. After another couple of Minutes a Women from the Office came and explained me in nearly perfect English that i have to buy the Ticket Online. I did so, showed the confirmation to her and was allowed entry. As there are simply no Tourists in Kiev because of the War, i was the only visitor of the Museum and had no rush to explore everything in depth. The majority of the Museum was themed about the current War. They had many Items since the 2022 Invation on display like used Launchers donated by Western Countries. They had aswell Multiple Drones on Display including Bayraktar TB2. I could go on basically forever what they had on Display as iam interested in this Topic, but that would not serve the purpose of this Trip Report. For some exhibition Rooms i had a Guard comming with me to unlock it and enable Power which was very kind of them. Overal i can highly recommend that museum. I had spent close to 5 Hours in it so it was time to grab a Coffee in a nearby Park, relax a bit and then heading back to the Hotel to get some Lunch.

**Motherland Statue and Chernobyl Museum**  
The 3rd Day brought amazing Weather again so i went with a Bus towards the Motherland statue. On the way leading to it were many ex Soviet Tanks and other Military Vehicles on Display where i spend over an Hour looking at it. Comming closer to the Motherland Statue i noticed a ton of Black Mercedes and lots of Armed Soldiers and Police patroling the Area. That is nothing unusual as Kiev is crowded with Soldiers and Police with Guns patroling the Street. When i came closer they told me to go which i surely did. Later that Day i found out Selensky had given a speech just below the Statue which is why it was locked by Security Forces. After another Uber Ride i was in Podil which features a nice Ferris Weel and the Chernobyl Museum. I spend around 2 Hours in the Museum but i did not really like the Experience there. Because of many School Classes it was crowded and very little information in English. I got someting to eat and rode the ferris wheel which was an interesting experience. I made my way on foot up towards the [St. Andrew's Church](https://maps.app.goo.gl/7FVS5QMTmA2yZVqj7). On the street many Street vendors have their booths set up so i was shopping some Souvenirs for Family and Friends and had some good conversations with the sellers abot their current Situation and the Situation of Ukraine. On the Evening i met up with my Friend living in Kiev and we went somewhere to eat dinner. 

**Turbulent last Night**  
My last Night in Ukraine was unlike the ones before. At around 4 AM the Air Raid sirens went of, Russia had launched another Attack on the Ukrainian Energy Infrastructure. The Attack was going for around 3 Hours and multiple explosions were heard over Kiev as the Air Defense shot down approaching Rockets and Drones. I had an App Installed on my Phone which would give me an Alarm in Addition to the Sirens outside. It was working fine when i was still at home. One thing i did not think of tho was that if Quiet Mode is enabled, that Alarm wont go off on my Phone. Because of an Enabled Quiet Mode i basically slept through all the Attack and was only waken up by some Sirens at around 0630AM the next Morning. By the time i realized what is going on the Attack was already over. As my Hotel did not have a Bunker and my Room was not on the Top floor, i decided to stay in my Room anyways should at Attack during the night occur as it would be safer than going out towards the nearest Bunker. Most Ukrainians do so too btw.

**The long Journey Home**  
After reading the News and some Messages from Friends reading about the Attack in German News, i headed with an Uber to the Train Station. To enter the Station its required to go through a Security Screening like at an Airport. I went after some waiting to my Train to go back to Poland. The Journey was supposed to take 10 Hours. On the Track i was again starred at very strangely by locals. Most Passengers on that Train were Women with Toddlers or Babies, Seniors above 65 Years old and a handfull of Foreigners. I met 4 men from the US/Canada who where on the Front fighting. Out of respect i of course did not ask any questions about that, tho i have deep respect of them. After around 2 Hours another Air Raid Alert was going off. The Trains continue driving regardless of any Alarms. In Lviv Border Guards, some with AK74s, board the Train and check for Documents, another period of tension for me. In the End everything worked out for me. I was not asked any Questions even tho these Border Guards spoke good English. My Bags werent checked aswell. Some Ukrainians had to disembark at an unofficial Stop right before the Border which took over 2 Hours. It was sad to see these sometimes young men not being allowed the leave the country while i had no Problems at all. I realized the streng of the German Passport in that Moment and was glad to have one.  
With a 2 Hour Delay we entered Przemysl. The Waiting time for the EU Entry took quite some time aswell so i was exhausted when boarding my Regiojet Sleeper Train to Prague. I made my Bed and fell asleep basically immediately.  
I woke up shortly before reaching Prague from where i continued to Regensburg on the same Day. Disembarking at my local Station knowing i made the Journey from Kiev all the way home by Rail only was an overwhelming feeling.

**Home!**  
What can i say now afterwards? Was it worth it? For me personally yes. I was able to get impressions from a country in a very special Situation which is also great stuff to tell people about. Ukraine is not just War and destruction as it might sometimes seem like while watching the news. I was feeling safe during my whole trip. Going nowadays into Ukraine requires a deep personal consideration of risk vs. benefit. ""Safe"" is considered by each individually. For me Kiev was ""Safe"" when i visited, i would have never taken the trip otherwise! I dont want to encourage anyone to do the same and travel to Ukraine currently. Its a very special type of travelling, especially solo like me.  
Would you have visited Tel Aviv 2 years ago before the recent agressions? If yes the Situation in Kiev in May was not very different: A Lot of Air Defense (""Iron Dome"") around to city which will shoot down most approaching Rockets and Drones before they Impact.   
**Please do your own research!**

What was *not* perfect about these poutines? The sauce taste was perfect. The sauce/fries ratio was perfect. The poutine temp (very hot) was perfect. The fries, my Lord, the fries were perfection (sweet inside, crispy outside, not too salty, not oily). That leaves... the cheese. Honestly, there was a good quantity of cheese (perfection level for me) but I kind of have a pet peeve for tiny curds. I like the big ones. These weren't chopped or anything though, so they've got that going for them. It's like they came from a baby curd factory... They were also kind of cold, no squeak was to be had from the cheese, yet it did not seem refrig kind of cold because the texture was that of fresh cheese. I spent much of my time eating the poutine, analysing the cheese because of these discrepancies. What I can say is, despite the not perfect cheese, I would eat one of these with my coffee right now (it's 6h30 a.m.). 



So, I dock -.5 for the cheese and -.5 for... wtf. They dribble flavored salt on the top (you see those specks on the cheese, that's salt, not sauce crystals). I don't think any poutine needs extra salt and I would def ask them not to add that the next time I will most definitely return.

  
The price was ok: 27$ tax in for a small and medium regular poutine. Beware: they no longer have the galvaude here. There are only the Regular or the Tousignant, which is loaded with cardiac arrest: ground beef, sausage and bacon (an atrocity if you ask me).

After spending another morning looking like I'd stuck my finger in an electrical socket, I finally broke down and bought what's essentially a spacecraft engine for my head. 

Here's what happened.

# Update:

**BEST PRICE on the Dyson Supersonic Hair Dryer here:**

[https://amzn.to/3YoW1jL](https://amzn.to/3YoW1jL)

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# First Impression

So, this thing came and it felt like meeting an online date who actually looks better than their profile picture. It was simultaneously thrilling and deeply suspicious. But I've always been a sucker for premium packaging.

Inside, the Dyson Supersonic sits there looking like something NASA rejected for being too fancy. It's got this futuristic donut-shaped head that makes traditional hair dryers look like they were designed by cavemen who just discovered electricity.

My first thought was, great, I've just spent my entire grocery budget on something that looks like it could open a portal to another dimension. But then I picked it up, and it felt different. Not just ""oh, this is nice"" different, but ""where have you been all my life"" different. It's like when you finally buy good sheets after sleeping on whatever Target had on clearance for the past decade.

The design is so minimal and sophisticated that it made my bathroom look like it needed a makeover. Suddenly, my plastic shower caddy looked like it belonged in a college dorm room. Thanks, Dyson, for giving me yet another expensive problem to solve.

# My Favorite Features

**The Motor:** This thing uses Dyson's V9 digital motor, which apparently spins at 110,000 rpm. For reference, that's faster than some airplane engines. It's basically a jet engine for your head, but somehow quieter than my neighbor's opinions about my parking skills. The power-to-size ratio is impressive though, you really feel it.

**Temperature Control:** My old hair dryer basically came with two settings: Arctic Blast and Surface of the Sun. But the Supersonic has three precise heat settings, plus a cold shot button that actually works immediately. Also, the heat sensor checks temperature 40 times per second, which is more attention than I've received in any relationship.

What's really wild is that it maintains consistent temperature throughout your time using it. No more of that oh god, it's burning my scalp followed by wait, why is it suddenly cold. 

**Magnetic Attachments:** There's 5 attachments that snap on magnetically, and it gives me that satisfaction feeling like finding the last puzzle piece. They're actually impossible to attach wrong, which is perfect for morning-zombie me who can barely function before coffee. The magnets are strong enough to hold on during use but won't require a workout to remove. Even better, they actually stay cool to the touch, so I'm not burning my fingers when I try to adjust mid-dry.

My favorites are the styling concentrator which is like having a precision laser for your hair, and the diffuser actually diffuses instead of just making weird noises.

**Air Multiplier Technology:** Dyson's proprietary air multiplication tech means it dries hair faster while causing less damage. It's like having a gentle breeze and a hurricane at the same time, but make it fashion. The airflow is so precisely controlled that your hair doesn't end up looking like you just stepped off a motorcycle in a windstorm, which I really appreciate.

**Weight Distribution & Ergonomics:** The motor's in the handle instead of the head, making it really well balanced. Finally, something in my life that is. This means you can dry your hair without developing the arm muscles of a professional tennis player. The cord is also long enough to reach across my bathroom without requiring an elaborate pulley system of extension cords.

# Real-World Performance

So, does it actually work? 

Short answer: Yes. Long answer: Oh my god, yes.

My usual hair routine used to go something like this:

\- Wash hair

\- Check phone while hair drips

\- Start drying

\- Get bored

\- Check phone again

\- Resume drying

\- Wonder why I'm still not done

\- Consider just wearing a hat

\- Finally finish 30 minutes later

**With the Supersonic, it's more like:**

\- Wash hair

\- Start drying

\- Check phone out of habit

\- Realize hair is already dry

\- Stand there confused about what to do with all this extra time

# The Results Breakdown:

**Drying Time:** What used to take 20+ minutes now takes 5-7.

**Hair Health:** My hair actually looks better. Not ""I'm just saying that to justify the price"" better, but legitimately healthier. Less frizz, more shine, and fewer split ends. It's like my hair finally decided to cooperate after years of rebellion.

**Noise Level:** It's quieter than traditional dryers, which means I can actually hear my podcast while drying my hair. Or my children plotting destruction in the next room.

# The Not-So-Great Parts

**The Price Tag:** Okay, so this thing costs more than my first car payment. Yes, it's worth it. No, I won't tell my mother how much it cost.

**No Travel Case:** For the price, you'd think they'd throw in a bag. But no, you'll need to buy that separately because apparently, we haven't spent enough money yet.

**The Addiction:** Once you try it, you can't go back. Hotel hair dryers will become your nemesis. You'll pack this thing even for overnight trips. 

# Final Verdict

The Dyson Supersonic is for you if:

* You value your time more than your money
* You've ever wished for salon-quality hair at home
* You appreciate good engineering enough to get excited about airflow physics
* You want to make all your friends jealous of your hair care routine

It's not for you if:

* You think hair dryers should cost less than a weekend getaway
* You're perfectly content with your current hair situation
* You need that money for trivial things like food or shelter
* You don't want to become that person who talks about their hair dryer at parties

So, is it worth it? Like a good therapist or expensive wine, yes ‚Äì but you'll never admit how much you spent on it to your parents. It's the kind of purchase that makes you feel guilty until the first use, after which you'll become that annoying friend who won't shut up about their hair dryer.

I think the Dyson Supersonic is what happens when engineers decide to solve a problem nobody asked them to solve, and somehow end up creating something we never knew we needed. It's excessive, it's expensive, and it's absolutely fantastic.

1gjc2ud,https://www.reddit.com/r/ahmedabad/comments/1gjc2ud/harassed_by_a_cop/,Harassed By a cop ,"A very strange incident took place last night: I was sitting in the car with a female friend of mine on VIP road just a little ahead of Hanuman Mandir [some 100 metres away from her Society] we were sitting and talking as she was leaving the city the very next day. It was around 10 PM. 

A bike came towards us from the opposite direction and a man got down in a white shirt, he took it off and it was a cop in uniform. I didn't startle or get scared because I knew there was nothing wrong or illegal in what were doing and sitting in the car while having coffee isn't against the Law. He knocked on my window and asked me what we were doing here, I replied that we're sitting and having a meal. He started asking if our parents knew that we're with each other. I asked him how does that matter? [Both our parents knew our whereabouts] but he was extremely persistent on making me step out of the vehicle. I asked him to show me his badge number and reason to make me step out or else I'm not going to do so as per my safety. He further insisted to take the car to the Bopal police station to settle the matter there. I refused to do so and said If there's nothing illegal in what I'm doing, I do not wish to waste my time in the police station. 

He was still very persistent to call our parents, which I eventually ended up calling because I was in no mood to argue and prove a point by bruising someone's ego. He talked to my friend's parents and only then was he ready to let go. 

Throughout the entire incident, I didn't once step out of the vehicle or roll my window completely down. I was stern with my voice and knowing that I wasn't doing anything wrong, I didn't drive off or panic either. However, he never once asked me to show my licence or identity proof. Was he really there for the safety of another woman or was he trying to extort money from two young people? Why do two adults both over the age of 21 receive threats like ""call your parents"" even after they're lawfully 2 consenting adults?

Got diagnosed w PMDD and went on norethindrone. Possibly helped for a little while and took away my periods.. But I got off 7-8 months later due to weight gain (116-127 in that time period), brain fog, anxiety, and the constipation coming back for longer durations. Now I‚Äôm having some issues all month except during or right after my periods for a few days (best days of my life!). 

Had a CT scan, colonoscopy, endoscopy, and everything is okay. Now I have Idiopathic Constipation w PMDD. 

Im currently taking motegrity (idk if this still works), mag citrate 300mg, and two different fibers. Miralax in my coffee helps keep me somewhat regular but I still feel lower belly bloat. Guess I‚Äôm not getting everything that‚Äôs needed out.. out. Eating when truly hungry and chewing a lot aswell. 

-  Anybody have any recommendations? What‚Äôs your relief regimen?

Side note: hate this condition and will be forever fighting against it :) not letting it control my entire life again :) hustling on the good days and resting on the bad ones :) this takes so much patience!! 

Hope yall are working hard to not let this all control you. I‚Äôm proud of all of you how‚Äôve struggled deeply with this. I‚Äôm proud that you‚Äôve kept going strong!",5,1730719882.0,PMDDxADHD,0,1.0,False

1gjc1r5,https://www.reddit.com/r/barista/comments/1gjc1r5/how_do_you_put_up_withdeal_with_annoying_coworkers/,How do you put up with/deal with annoying coworkers?,"TL;DR: My coworker frequently 'delegates' annoying jobs and cleaning tasks (which they occasionally created) to other people and prioritises themself, and treats working relationships like outside of work relationships. What would you do?

I work at this awesome little local cafe on weekends and after school and shifts like that. I've been a barista there for a bit over a year and I love making coffee, practicing latte art, and usually interacting with my coworkers while working, especially those of a similar age to me. Emphasis on usually. I really, strongly dislike working with a person who I also go to school with.

We're friends outside of work, have hung out quite a lot as part of a larger friend group and all that, but I just fundamentally disagree with how they behave at work. Their priorities, behaviours, and maybe even their (work) beliefs based on what I've seen are not really appropriate. Now, I could be completely wrong, or in the wrong myself, but any second opinions on how to generally handle this would be greatly appreciated.

My main issue is how they seem to think that what they're doing is the most important thing happening at that moment. Like, today they were making coffees and spilt some milkshake over the bench next to the blending machine thingos. Rather than spend 15 seconds finding a cloth and wiping up the mess, they immediately went back to making drinks and instructed another junior, who had a completely different job to do and was just in the area to clean up the mess. They just come off as so entitled and self-important, it just pisses me off. Unfortunately, this wasn't an isolated experience and they frequently 'delegate' less savoury tasks to others. Not always, but enough that it has been commented on by a number of people.

My second issue is more specific to me - I find their behaviour inappropriate in a professional, working situation. Like, the environment in the cafe is really pretty informal - when someone makes a mistake or has to do some annoying job, you fellow barista may laugh at you but it won't feel targeted and overall its a supportive place. But, this coworker feels like they bring outside of work relationships with them and I really don't like it. There's an informality, a kind of criticising air that I really hate working around.

Overall, it's probably partly a me problem but I really don't like working with this coworker. I don't have a consistent shift with them (thank f\*ck) and I don't want to restrict my availability by asking not to work shifts when they're already working. Do any of you have any tips for kind of blocking out the annoying things about working with them but still be productive and be able to work productively? Thanks in advance.

P.S. I should probably note that my shift today started 4 hours before theirs, during which a rush continued for virtually the entire time and by the time they arrived I was already pretty gassed (not enough sleep nor espresso in my system) and was making more mistakes and was not in the mood for anything I perceived as annoying behaviour. That's partly why I think it was a me thing, I might have just been in a bad mood and been picking apart little things.",2,1730719813.0,barista,0,1.0,False

Recovering alcoholic writer Stefan Queen was travelling by car to his local polling station. He was driving at 80mph in a 40 zone. Democracy was on the line. Stefan's vote would decide the entire election, and subsequently the continued survival of the human race. He hadn't been able to sleep a wink all night thinking about Trump, and the cocaine-laced coffee he'd had that morning had his heart jackhammering harder than a gang-bang in a sewer.

Stefan took his eyes off the road and his hands off the wheel for just a second to compose a tweet. *Donald Trump is dangerou bgkjbfjksbdz*. He didn't have time to finish the tweet, let alone send it to his millions of followers, as his car veered off the road and into a crowd of people. Stefan screamed into his N95 as Mrs. O'Leary, a local religious zealot and ride or die MAGAt, grabbed hold of his bonnet and clawed at the windshield. Stefan bravely activated the windshield wipers. Mrs. O'Leary slipped out of sight and under the wheels of his car, as Stefan let out a heroic ""heh"" and tried to regain control of his vehicle.

The demonic Tesla had a mind of it's own however, and was no doubt being controlled remotely by Elon Musk. Stefan had never seen such blatant election interference in his life. Stefan braced himself as his traitorous transport travelled straight towards a chestnut tree. The car slammed directly into it, launching Stefan straight through the windshield. In his rush to vote against Trump, Stefan had neglected to wear his seatbelt. Thankfully his N95 cushioned his fall, and only about half of his face was scraped off as a result. Stefan tried to move and felt his body roar out in pain. Some bones were definitely broken. He hadn't been in this much agony since his last booster jab.

As Stefan clawed his crippled body towards the crumpled chassis of his car, a red eyed rodent watched rapaciously from above. It was frothing at the mouth, and had a tiny MAGA hat on its head. Stefan had disturbed the beast from its slumber, and it wanted revenge. The squirrel stalked Stefan as he finally reached the wreckage, his howls of pain muffled by the N95 on his lacerated face. His trembling hand reached inside the clump of twisted metal and retrieved his miraculously unscathed phone. Stefan opened TWITTER. It hurt to type but the urge to tweet overrode his discomfort. *Former President and convicted felon Donald J. Trump literally just crashed my car.* He hit send, and billions of ~~bots~~ red hot blooded good old American Joes who love democracy and hate fascism liked his tweet.

As though incensed by Stefan's truthful tweet, the squirrel leapt from a branch above and divebombed straight towards Stefan, coughing out COVID spores as it flew through the air. The squirrel landed in his lap and began digging at Stefan's crotch. Thankfully Stefan had had his cock and balls removed years ago. He knew that would pay off eventually. Repulsed by the rancid, rotting smell emanating from Stefan's nether regions, the squirrel turned around and slashed out at Stefan's face. That's when future female President MOMALA ""I AIN'T GOT TIME TO BREED"" HARRIS descended from the Heavens with a tranquiliser gun and a bag of Doritos!!

""Don't."" she warned the squirrel, wagging her finger in its face. Consumed by fear, the squirrel bolted away for the nearest tree. Momala coolly aimed up her shot and fired. The tranquiliser dart ripped straight through the squirrel's cranium. Momala cackled in victory as the squirrel slumped over. Its reign of terror was at an end. ""Thank you Madam Vice President!""

*Read More:*¬†[*Why Amazon Video Product Ads Convert Better: The Power of Visual Storytelling*](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/why-amazon-video-product-ads-convert-better-the-power-of-visual-storytelling/)

# Product Specs vs. Brand Story: What Buyers Really Care About

# The Importance of Product Specifications

Product specifications refer to all the important information about a product. It is usually accompanied by size, material, weight, and functionality. The buyers bank on these specifics to determine whether such a product will suit their needs.

* For example, a person who wants a laptop will most probably prioritize specifications like processing power, RAM, storage capacity, and battery life. This kind of information presented with the utmost clarity and accuracy by a seller could go a long way toward winning the confidence of a buyer who feels that he is in a position to decide well.

However, spec-based alone contributes only to a buyer-product transactional relationship. This is most apparent in categories like electronics or appliances, where technical details are important.¬†

But while product specs are a strong foundation upon which to understand the product, they rarely achieve the emotional resonance that truly dictates a buying decision.

# The Role of Brand Storytelling

A brand story is the history or account of a product or a brand. It can tell the values or missions and also the special path that transformed into a brand. It is this kind of story that can produce an emotional connection to the target market so that the buyers can associate at the deepest level with the brand.¬†

* For instance, a brand that emphasizes its sustainability and ethical sourcing in its brand story can attract environmentally conscious consumers who value these issues.

When a brand has a great story, it invites buyers to become part of that story.¬†

* Take TOMS Shoes, for example. Its ‚ÄúOne for One‚Äù initiative means that for every pair purchased, a pair is donated to someone in need. That‚Äôs a very powerful story that sets TOMS apart from competitors and aligns with the values of customers who wish to make a positive impact through their purchases.

# Unlocking the Purchasing Behavior: Emotional Attachments

In several studies, emotional attachments form an integral part of consumer behaviors. The most simple buyers based on feelings rather than logic decide their purchases. Whenever they are able to associate with the emotionally charged brand story, they feel attached or loyal to that brand.¬†

* In fact, Apple is quite a good storyteller. The central element of their marketing campaigns involves innovation, creativity, and a way of life that resonates with the target audience. This often results in an emotional pull to Apple products over competitors offering better specs at lower prices.

# Brand Authenticity Matters

With authentic claims, authenticity is critical in the market today. Consumers are very discerning and can easily detect any false claim. It is a brand story that has genuine values and a true mission of talking to buyers.¬†

* For example, Patagonia expresses its¬†[Amazon brand](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/9-reasons-why-your-amazon-brand-needs-an-engaging-storefront/)¬†story as a celebration of the activist attitude towards environmental causes. Customers, in return, buy the product for its cause, and customer loyalty is higher.

When product specifications are supported by a real brand story, they take on new importance.¬†

* For instance, a brand selling running shoes will talk about its technology and design but also the cause it supports by promoting running in local communities; that is how product specs take on a larger story that consumers can connect with and support.

*Read More:*¬†[*The Mobile Conundrum: Optimizing Amazon Listings for Smartphone Shoppers*](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/the-mobile-conundrum-optimizing-amazon-listings-for-smartphone-shoppers/)

# Differentiation in an Overcrowded Marketplace

When there are millions of products on¬†**Amazon FBA,**¬†it gets very competitive, and thus, differentiation is what one needs. Product specifications may not be the only factors that make a difference in crowded marketplaces. A captivating brand story can be the unique approach, targeting a buyer‚Äôs focus.¬†

* For example, when a customer wants to find a skincare product, he or she can find several products with almost the same ingredients. But when a brand tells its story about where it came from, how it was inspired, and what benefits it has to customers, then the competition rises.
* Consider Drunk Elephant as an example, a skincare brand focusing on ‚Äúclean-clinical‚Äù products but telling the personal story of its founder. By such communication, the customer emotionally connects with the brand and simultaneously knows what is different and what the benefit is in a product.

# The Shift Toward Experience Over Specifications

A modern customer favors an experience over mere material possessions. A story by a brand based on customer experiences is more effective than a specification list itself.¬†

* For example, if a kitchen equipment seller shares stories about families coming together to make memories with their product, the buyer finds an emotional value in cooking and family bonding. This relationship might make the prospective buyer more likely to buy the product than if they were only given technical specifications.

# Building Trust with Storytelling

Trust is crucial in any online marketplace such as¬†**Amazon FBA.**¬†Buyers will generally not buy products that lack transparency or authenticity. A brand story about the journey of the brand, challenges faced along the way, and achievements can help build credibility.¬†

* For instance, a small business can gain trust by announcing grassroots roots and including statements from actual customers. Buyers tend to buy when they feel they know the brand personally.

# Visual Storytelling Role

Adding pictures to your brand story can give it a more lifelike impact. Good photographs and videos that narrate tell product specifications well, too. For example,¬†[lifestyle images](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/mastering-the-balance-of-infographics-and-lifestyle-images-in-2024/)¬†show how one can use the product to tell a story, which would appeal to the buyer.¬†

* It is pretty effective, especially when a buyer has many choices in¬†**Amazon FBA**, for instance. A seller of outdoor gear could take¬†**listing images**¬†and videos that tell of adventures through their products; this would transform mere specifications into a story.

# Testimonials and Social Proof

Through customer testimonials in your brand story, you can successfully integrate both product specifications and emotional connections. Real-life experiences from satisfied customers are what make the authenticity and credibility of the brand stick in the minds of the buyers.

* For instance, a fitness equipment-selling brand might include testimonials sharing how the product has transformed users‚Äô lives. This integration of social proof and storytelling can really drive the purchasing decision.

# Balance Between Specs and Story

A compelling brand story is important, but it must not completely outshine product specifications. Buyers still want to know the details that would affect performance and usability.¬†

The best way of combining both is one that lets customers be well-informed about the important information they need while at the same time, making them feel emotionally attached to the brand.¬†

* For example, a technology brand selling a new gadget may provide an entire specification along with an innovation story and the direction of the brand for the future. This is a combination of the rational and emotional mindset of the consumer in determining a purchase.

# Branding and Long-Term Loyalty

Customer loyalty is not a one-time purchase; when a customer identifies the story of a brand, they will come back to it again. A good story, therefore, creates loyalty by inducing a sense of belonging and even community.

* Inspirational brands like Nike, which speak so much about inspiration and perseverance, generate an enormous return for these brands, paying a premium and yet yielding loyalty not because of product specs but the overall storyline of the brand that talks to people‚Äôs values and aspirations.

# Brand Story in Alignment with Target Audience

Understanding who your target audience is forms the basis of building a brand story. A value- and desire-driven story may resonate better with your audience than any other because it speaks to the pain points, needs, or desires of your audience.¬†

* For example, when your target market is a millennial who values sustainability, that can really be woven into a brand story and make some significant connections. Brands like All Birds have been able to leverage their brand story in conjunction with the audience‚Äôs values in such aspects as using eco-friendly materials and practices.

This impacts how visible your product will be on Amazon FBA¬† as well. A well-crafted brand story can help improve rankings from related keywords.¬†

Every time the customer searches for products according to their personal values, an effective brand story makes it easier to find your product. You improve the visibility of your product using related keywords yet remain emotionally connected with your potential buyer.

# Crafting a Unique Brand Story for Amazon FBA Success

# The Founder‚Äôs Journey: A Personal Touch

Telling the story of a founder is one of the most interesting ways to get in touch with audiences. It humanizes the brand, and customers connect with the person behind the product.

* For instance, a skincare brand begins with an experience where its founder had a problem concerning issues to the skin, then proceeds to try to create solutions to such problems that would be great for everyone. That‚Äôs not only authenticity but relates to a similar struggle.

In winning adversity, success sometimes manifests in the face of overcoming challenges. Stories of how some people have overcome adversities can inspire and motivate customers. A small business, which started when the economy was at its worst and eventually thrived, can attract consumers who like resilience.

* For instance, a food brand can tell its audience how it started from a small kitchen operation to becoming a thriving brand, all fueled by dedication and passion.

# Sustainability commitment. Brand for purpose

It is a highly distinctive brand that prioritizes sustainability in today‚Äôs world. A firm narrates a compelling story by talking about its commitment to eco-friendly practices and ethical sourcing of materials.

* The clothes brand can talk about making clothes from recyclable material, thus offering fair labor practices appealing to an eco-conscious shopper who wants purchases to align with their values.

# Innovations Customer Centric Driven¬†

Brand Story Innovations are driven based on consumer needs: This will depict a message of improvement and responsiveness.¬†

* For example, a technological gadget brand that focuses on how consumer suggestions have been used to advance its product will come up with a personal story of collaboration with its consumers. This will imply trust in the brand as well as the value given to every feedback from its audience.

# Heritage Celebration: Restore Traditions and Cultures

Any brand that celebrates heritage or cultural roots can forge an emotional bond with the customer. A food brand sharing a recipe passed on through generations may appeal to those who seek authenticity.¬†

* For instance, a spice brand may narrate how the founder‚Äôs grandmother taught the grandmother of secrets behind traditional cooking to attract authentic and traditional buyers.

# Community Involvement: Giving Back to Society

Community involvement and social responsibility are the most powerful stories that a brand can tell. Beauty brands donate a portion of their profits to local charities or otherwise as the brand seems to engage in community development drawing customers to ethical consumption.¬†

This commitment increases not only brand loyalty but also builds a respectable image in the marketplace.

# Craftsmanship and Quality: The Artisan Approach

What may define a brand from another might be the emphasis on the craftsmanship and detail in coming up with the product. A jewelry brand, for example, can use the story of how each piece is carefully crafted to portray that quality and detail in it.¬†

* Such appeal by a brand to the craftsmanship and detail with which products are created would appeal to artisanal good lovers and willing payers.

# Power of Collaboration: Joining with Other Brands

Partnering with other brands can give brands a unique story that increases their visibility. Imagine a soft drink brand partnering with a local bakery to create some special flavor pairings.¬†

This may attract people looking for unique taste combinations; the collaborative story brings excitement but also extends its audience to both parties involved.

# Wellness Focus: Health, Well Being

In an increasingly health-conscious market, a brand that focuses on wellness becomes a beacon for a loyal following. A nutritional supplement brand that shows the stories of customers reaching their health goals because of its products creates a very inspiring story.

¬†The wellness focus resonates with consumers and helps to position the brand as one trusted in and on their health journeys.

# The Adventure Spirit: Embracing Exploration and Discovery

A brand that speaks to adventure and exploration inspires the imagination of its audience. The outdoor gear brand inspires its customers by showing them real adventures in which people use the products in harsh conditions.¬†

This story inspires the customer to see himself in an exciting scenario, creating a strong bond with the brand.

# Family Values: The Legacy Passed Down

Family values when attached to a¬†[brand story](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/why-is-amazons-brand-story-significant-for-your-brand/), are warm and inviting. The food brand would come in with recipes passed through generations of comfort and nostalgia for those looking for it.

¬†In such a case, pasta boasts of its Italian roots by emphasizing the family tradition from which the products originated in their claims of authenticity and root-ness.

# The Innovation Pioneer: Industry Leader

The innovative brands talk of being a pioneer. Tech brands present themselves from being startups to leaders in their industry by stressing groundbreaking products that take the market by storm and attract tech-savvy customers. The story gives the impression that the brand is innovative and plays the game of the future.

# The Unsung Hero: Daily Champion

It creates a great emotional relationship with the brand by focusing on and making heroes out of everyday ones. Think of a brand manufacturing cleaning products that communicate the stories of essential employees who are utilizing their cleaning products to clean up their communities.¬†

This kind of brand campaign can help develop the brand identity of a firm while increasing customer loyalty since many admire the values represented by this type of brand.

# ¬†Cultural Stories: Cultural Diversity Inclusive

It celebrates cultural diversity and inclusivity, thus being more meaningful to a larger population. Fashion brands sharing the stories of models from diverse backgrounds or telling of cultural awareness would appeal more to those consumers seeking representations.¬†

The story promotes the feeling of belongingness, which in turn helps strengthen a relationship with the brand.

# Passion for Craft: The Story Behind the Product

Storytelling that refers to passion and dedication in making the product is very engaging. For example, a coffee brand tells the story from bean to cup, paying attention to the selection and roasting processes that can make a coffee lover buy the coffee.

¬†That is because this story communicates quality and passion for the product. Most consumers appreciate fine products.

# Change Adaptability: Keeping Pace with Consumers‚Äô Needs

The ability to be flexible on changing consumer tastes is a beautiful story that brands can bring about. A fashion brand that is able to evolve from using non-toxic materials due to customer demands will attract consumers who care about the environment. The story here explains how the brand evolves and stays responsive to the needs of consumers.

# ¬†The Local Connection: Support Small Businesses

A brand story that emphasizes local roots and small business support can speak to consumers who care about making a positive difference.¬†

* For example, if a skincare brand sources its ingredients from regional farmers, then customers might find appeal in community support. This story not only strengthens brand loyalty but also creates a positive image for your brand in the marketplace.

# The Science of Innovation: Relied Upon by Research

Brands that tell how evidence-based their products are tend to attract customers who perceive them as evidence-based products to consumers. A skincare firm could have a strong story demonstrating to the consumers how all those formulations are based upon different studies from dermatology.

Science builds the strength of credibility and puts the brand in authority that is trusted by that respective industry.

# The Origin Story of How an Offer Went from Concept to Distribution

Something that is shared from design to market entry makes for an interesting story. A gadget brand might show its new innovative product during the designing and testing stage, attracting customers by their love for technology. Such a back-story tells a lot about transparency and builds excitement in a future buyer.

# A vision of the Future: Communicating long-term goals

Consumers might be motivated by a brand story talking of a future vision. A renewable energy brand could easily attract green-conscious customers who care about their future by sharing their commitment to a sustainable future.

¬†It will position the brand as an industry leader to appeal to those who wish to be part of something positive while strictly following the current trend.

# Creating an Emotional Hook in Your Brand Story

# Share Real Experiences

Authenticity is critical when you want to develop an emotional hook in your brand story. The consumer today is wise and can easily catch a sense of insincerity or marketing gimmickry.¬†

Real experiences are the only things that could make your audience connect to you better, whether it‚Äôs the journey of the founder, testimonials from the customers, or¬†[behind-the-scenes](https://www.bing.com/ck/a?!&&p=14123cd005ed1c71JmltdHM9MTcyOTkwMDgwMCZpZ3VpZD0yNzJjMjUzMi0wNTEzLTYyNzctMjhiOC0zNzJhMDQxYTYzMDQmaW5zaWQ9NTIzOA&ptn=3&ver=2&hsh=3&fclid=272c2532-0513-6277-28b8-372a041a6304&psq=behind-the-scenes+stories+forbes&u=a1aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZm9yYmVzLmNvbS9zaXRlcy9yb25jYXJ1Y2NpLzIwMjEvMDQvMDQvYmVoaW5kLXRoZS1zY2VuZXMtb2YtYmVzdC1idXlzLXJlY29yZC1zZXR0aW5nLXR1cm5hcm91bmQtd2l0aC1odWJlcnQtam9seS8&ntb=1)¬†stories.¬†

* Take Coca-Cola‚Äôs ‚ÄúShare a Coke‚Äù campaign. The brand replaced its iconic logo with popular names. It personalized the brand and created a sense of community, leading to increased sales and brand engagement, by encouraging consumers to find bottles with their names and share the experience with friends and family.

# Nostalgia

Nostalgia is one of the most powerful emotional triggers that can be applied effectively in brand storytelling. Those brands that evoke some fond memories are directly connected on an emotional level with their audience.¬†

* For example, in the case of LEGO, it has capitalized on the nostalgia factor by marketing its old sets in a nearly new product. Nudging parents to relive their childhood LEGO memories, the brand creates a nostalgia, which inspires purchases both for themselves and for their children. This emotive hook pushes sales but also leads to a deeper connection with the brand since it makes LEGO appear as that source of creativity and joy centuries ago.

# Use of Humor and Lightheartedness

Humor can serve effectively to build an emotive hook. When a brand makes consumers laugh, it not only grabs attention but also develops a positive association. The first brand I have learned is Old Spice, as this brand used humor during its product advertising.

* For instance, one of the memorable ‚ÄúThe Man Your Man Could Smell Like‚Äù makes buying a deodorant very interesting. Humor through its brand story has positioned Old Spice away from many brands to create a relationship, though emotional with the client that enjoys a lighthearted advertisement.

# Pain Points

A good emotional hook also refers to the pain points of your target audience. Brands can create a dramatic story by showing that they understand their audience

* For instance, Dove‚Äôs ‚ÄúReal Beauty‚Äù campaign challenged standard beauty-oriented thinking and insecurity in many women regarding their appearance. By showing real women, with different shapes, sizes, and backgrounds, Dove was able to create a familiar storyline while also encouraging people to hold their heads high.

¬†The emotional connection with customers was higher when purchasing Dove because they knew they were assisting a brand that was distinct from others, for it was about authenticity and self-acceptance.

# Emotional Hook: Building Community Around Your Brand

Emotional hook can also refer to building a sense of community around your brand. The more the customer belongs to you, the more engaged he is with your brand. Harley-Davidson created a sense of belonging for their customers.¬†

By focusing the brand on the lifestyle and camaraderie attached to the product, the brand develops an emotional involvement over and above the sale of the product.¬†

This sense of belonging promotes loyalty and will have customers that are more likely to act as advocates for the brand, thereby organically generating growth through word-of-mouth.

The final strong emotional hook comes from the expression of the values that your brand believes in. Today‚Äôs consumer increasingly wants to support a cause by purchasing a product with a brand that believes in those causes.¬†

* Patagonia has made environmental responsibility and sustainability its core belief for building its brand. A promise by Patagonia toward earth preservation and an appeal to consumers to consume less leads to a story that clicks for the conscious consumerism for environment care.¬†

A shared sense of values strengthens an emotive bond and converts consumer groups into supporters of that particular brand.

# How to Use Data to Enhance Your Brand Story

Customer feedback is a treasure trove of information that can improve your brand story. Sellers can view product reviews, ratings, and questions from¬†**Amazon FBA**¬†customers. Careful analysis will enable you to determine common themes and sentiments that arise from your customers‚Äô experiences.¬†

For instance, if many customers compliment the durability of your products, you can integrate this as the key component of your brand story.

* TrailBlazers is a firm that manufactures hiking equipment. By reading commentaries from customers, they noted that the customers are always concerned about the durability of their equipment during extreme conditions. Instead of talking about technical specifications, the brand turns its story on how their equipment withstands the test of time in all types of conditions. This makes their target buyers listen to and believe them as they also project them as a brand built on trust and quality.

# A/B Test Your Brand Story Elements

Another data-driven way of helping you amplify your brand story is A/B testing. This can help test different versions of your brand messaging,¬†**listing images**, and visuals to gather more valuable data on what resonates best with your audience.

* For example, if you were thinking about the emotional aspect of your brand versus the practical benefits of your products, you can create two totally different¬†**Amazon FBA**¬†listings-one that would focus on emotional storytelling, and another that would focus on product features.

If you imagine running a HappyPaws, your brand in pet supplies, and the decision to A/B test on two versions of a product listing for that premium dog bed. Either it is comfort and quality through materials or it tells the story of how the bed helps dogs sleep better and live happier lives.¬†

You will be able to tell which one suits the buyers the most and, based on the performance metrics, which include conversion rates and customer engagement, modify your overall brand story.

# Engaging Market Trends into Brand Story

To properly have a brand story, for example, you‚Äôll want to stay updated on the market as well as the needs of consumers. You will view reports that industries or social media and competitor strategies will eventually bring you to noticing emerging themes which fit your brand identity.¬†

If you‚Äôre one who discovers more consumers to take towards wellness and self-care, you would take the cue and jump on the trend.

* Take an example of a skincare brand, GlowEssence, focused on natural products. Analyzing its market data, it found that there was a rising trend among consumers for clean and organic skincare. GlowEssence renews its brand story with a clear message that it only uses natural ingredients and seeks to serve everyone to achieve healthy skin without the usage of toxins.¬†

Such an approach is driven more by data and not only will appeal to a larger audience but also establish GlowEssence as a natural skincare movement leader.

# Tailoring Content to Different Customer Segments

Data analysis will help you segment your audience properly. You can tailor your brand story to fit different customer groups by identifying the different segments within your customer base: first-time buyers, repeat customers, or premium buyers.

* For instance, CozyNest, an imaginary brand of home products, would examine the sales report and deduce that one group of customers frequently bought luxury bedding sets, while another group had a preference for budget-friendly sets. On such findings, CozyNest can create different brand stories for each segment.

¬†The story may then focus on the high-end, excellent quality, and exclusivity of the products for a high-end consumer, while for the budget consumer, it should talk about value and affordability without compromising on quality. Such a targeted approach helps improve engagement while increasing conversion.

Perfecting your story by using social media metrics is taken advantage of as follows:

* Social media is a treasure trove of data that can inform your brand story. When it comes to the engagement of users regarding different elements in your storytelling, you should analyze metrics such as likes, shares, and comments.

¬†Therefore, if some piece of information related to your community involvement is getting immense attention, this may suggest that your consumers are interested in that aspect of your brand.

* A brand called FitLife is an imaginary mythical fitness apparel that posts workout tips and community success stories on social media frequently. Through analytical tools for engagement metrics, they determine that customer transformation stories garner the most activity.¬†

Having understood this, FitLife comes to a conclusion to add more customer success stories in their brand story in the way FitLife products empower the user to achieve their fitness goals. This has not only supported their brand equity but also seen to be very empathetic to their customers.

# Measuring the Effect of Your Brand Story on Sales

In the end, your brand story can also be measurably effective. Using tools such as¬†**Amazon FBA‚Äôs**¬†performance analytics, the sale data conversion rates, and other customer retention metrics can be tracked before and after the changes to the story. Comparing metrics will indicate whether changes to the story influence sales and loyalty.

* For example, a new fashion brand, TrendSetters, develops a new story that conveys its commitment to sustainable fashion. It measures the sales and comments later on. Finally, it witnesses a very steep surge in sales along with hundreds of excellent comments, which simply validates that what it claims has a bearing in the minds of environmentally aware customers.

The statistics make it bold enough to concentrate on investment in such a message and subsequently develop the story.

# How to Use Influencer Partnerships to Share Your Brand Story

# Identify the right influencers for your brand

The first step in disseminating your brand story is choosing the right influencer who will be with you for the spread of your brand message. You, therefore, need to identify who shares your brand values and aesthetics.¬†

This helps make your story authentic for the people as it portrays what they believe in; the case is the same for the skin care brand that will join a beauty influencer if it is inclined towards more natural products with ethical practice.¬†[Find the influencers](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/how-to-find-the-influencers-to-promote-your-amazon-product/)¬†with the passion to believe in the purpose and mission of your brand so that you may heighten your chance of getting the proper messaging across about your story.

# Building a Cooperative Storytelling

Once you‚Äôve zeroed in on an appropriate influencer, then collaborating in storytelling comes into place, which essentially includes making collaborative content wherein the message for your brand story becomes enfolded within the distinctive voice and style of your chosen influencer.

* For instance, if you are selling handmade jewelry, you can collaborate with a fashion influencer who will show how your pieces complement different outfits. The influencer can share the personal story of discovering your brand and the story behind the craftsmanship of each piece. This collaboration brings your brand to life while adding depth to the story, which makes it more engaging for the audience.

# Effective Use of Social Media Platforms

Many social media platforms influence, and each provides unique means through which to share the story of a brand. Instagram gives, for example, the scope of visually aesthetic storytelling through¬†**listing images**¬†and reels.¬†

An influencer may share a string of photos focusing on the products he has, and the caption of each image is going to reflect the brand values and mission. Through TikTok, users can connect to short, creative videos in which you can present your story with entertaining and informative content.

* For instance, a food influencer could produce a recipe video using your kitchen gadgets, telling the story of how your products make their cooking experience so much fun.

# Authentic Content: The Authenticity Factor

When using the tool of¬†[influencer marketing partnerships](https://www.bing.com/ck/a?!&&p=72a9abaec970fa0bJmltdHM9MTcyOTkwMDgwMCZpZ3VpZD0yNzJjMjUzMi0wNTEzLTYyNzctMjhiOC0zNzJhMDQxYTYzMDQmaW5zaWQ9NTIxMQ&ptn=3&ver=2&hsh=3&fclid=272c2532-0513-6277-28b8-372a041a6304&psq=influencer+partnerships+medium&u=a1aHR0cHM6Ly9tZWRpdW0uY29tL0B5YWRhdmFiaGk5ODM1L2luZmx1ZW5jZXItbWFya2V0aW5nLXBhcnRuZXJzaGlwcy1hLWd1aWRlLTg1NDFlNTZiNzBiNQ&ntb=1)¬†to share your brand story, authenticity is key. Audiences can quickly recognize insincerity, so be sure to give influencers the freedom to present your brand in a way that feels authentic to them.¬†

* For example, if your brand embodies sustainable practices, partnering with a more environmentally conscious influencer that tends to reflect your brand values will create a much more authentic story.¬†

This means the influencer may speak to their personal commitment to sustainability and how your products fit into that life, all while effectively reinforcing your brand story without sounding overly scripted or forced.

# Interaction with Influencer Content and Building Community

After influencers publish content featuring your brand story, engage with their post. Responding to their comments, sharing their post on your own social channels, and saying thank you for the support all will go a long way to foster community.¬†

* For example, if the influencer shares a story of a heart-wrenching usage experience with your product, comment on it with a word of appreciation, thus showing appreciation for the influencer as well as building rapport among his or her audience. This type of engagement might make people curious about the brand and its story behind it and eventually may even convert to sales.

# Quantifying Influencer Collaboration Outcomes

Measuring effectiveness will require tracking key performance indicators. Some of the possible metrics to track include the rate of engagement, traffic being referred to your¬†**Amazon FBA**¬†listing, and sales conversion rates.¬†

* An example would be in a scenario where an influencer uses a promotional code among his audience, helping you understand how many sales that resulted from that code, thereby measuring the success of your influencer partnership. It helps in giving you a refining influencer strategy over time and proper optimization of future campaigns by analyzing the metrics.

# Case Study: Success Story of a Fitness Apparel Brand

A good example of telling a brand story using influencer partnerships was the success story of a fitness apparel brand with fitness influencers on social media. This brand had an interesting story centered around empowering each individual to embrace his/her fitness journey.¬†

The brand engaged with influencers who shared their personal transformations in fitness. Every influencer created content showcasing the apparels while narrating the specifics of his/her journey of persistence and dedication.¬†

The authentic representation of the brand story resonated with followers and led to increases in brand awareness and sales.

# How to Use Storytelling in Email Marketing Campaigns

# Designing an Engaging Email Template

Now that you have a brand story, you have to create an engaging email template that will support your story. Your visuals of your email should be connected to your story.

* For example, if your brand story is about handcrafted products, then you would use earthy tones and¬†**listing images**¬†of artisans in action. A lifestyle email that demonstrates the use of your products in everyday life will help fortify your brand story. You can make an attractive email that captures the essence of your brand identity, which makes it easier to tell an effective story.

# Using Subject Lines to Pique Interest

Subject lines are key in email marketing. They define whether the recipient will open your email or not. Write subject lines that can evoke curiosity or emotion, related to your story.¬†

* For example, if your brand is all about overcoming struggles to make quality products, a subject line like ‚ÄúOur Journey from Struggle to Success: Discover Our Story‚Äù evokes a lot of interest among the people. This strategy not only invites opens but also structures the context of your email so that it ties into your brand story.

# Story-telling in a Segmented Manner

Email marketing cannot work without proper segmentation. Proper segmentation means sending messages that are addressed specifically to your target groups of audience.¬†

* For example, if you have various customer personas, such as eco-conscious buyers or luxury product enthusiasts, make your brand story adapt to these. For the eco-conscious, it is your commitment to sustainability and ethical practices.¬†

In contrast luxury buyers, focus on the craftsmanship and exclusivity of the products. Personalized storytelling increases relevance and engagement and will convert more.

# Telling Stories in Product Launch Emails

Launch new products by associating elements of your brand story to build excitement and anticipation. You could launch a new skincare line because you have been inspired by personal experiences that you may have had dealing with some skin issues.¬†

This will not only inform them of your product but also build more of an emotional relationship with your brand.

# Using Customer Stories to Raise Your Story

Through email marketing, customer testimonials and stories can elevate your brand story very significantly. Authenticity is added to your story through the actual experiences of satisfied customers.¬†

* For example, if it is home decor, try using a customer story that transformed their living place with the help of your products. Try sharing before and after¬†**listing images**¬†of the customer and testimonials of how your brand contributed positively to their life.

¬†It not only builds up credulity but adds strength to the argument above that your brand stands for something more than just the product-those things which can enrich one‚Äôs life.

*Read More:*¬†[*Lessons Learned After Creating 25,000 Amazon Listing Images*](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/lessons-learned-after-creating-25000-amazon-listing-images/)

# Develop a Storyline Series of Emails

Consider developing a storyline series of emails that are gradually revealed to your brand. This serialized approach keeps the reader interested over time and gives them something to look forward to in your emails.¬†

* For instance, you can present a five-chapter set of emails, and each time, you focus on different chapters concerning your brand story-from start with the first challenges towards customer success stories and, finally, future hopes. All this will create a scenario where you explain your story in detail yet still, connect with the audience as well.

# Conclusion

While product specifications give you the basic information, it is the story of your brand that is appealing to consumers and will bring them back for more. A good story will appeal to the emotions of the customer and turn a casual browser into a devoted buyer.¬†

Your journey, values, and mission shared with your audience not only make your products different but also give them a sense of belonging and trust in you.

¬†In the end, it‚Äôs your brand story that will transform an otherwise straightforward buy into a rich experience, making customers return to your brand again and again over the competition. Tap into the power of storytelling, and watch sales increase and brand loyalty deepen.

He's always been petty and apparently loves to get attention by doing damage around the house, even if I play with him daily; I can't seem to set a boundary and I always had to work around his behaviour to limit the damages: I stopped using my coffee machine because he would constantly make it fall over to spill the water in the tank, I stopped using my night table because everything I put on it gets quickly pushed off, I stopped trying to have him use a kitty bed because he would always pee in it, I had to put his water bowl in the shower to avoid turning my kitchen floor into a pool because more than half of the water gets splashed everywhere, and I had to find a water bowl that would not be easily tipped over because no matter the size, his priority was to get the water out, either by pushing it with his head or with his paws.  
Lately, he's been trying to get my attention by scratching my tv screen and computer monitors, and this is where I find it really complicated to dissuade him.  
I can't ignore it, because I'd like to avoid damage to something I can't quite repay if it gets damaged;  
I tried almost everything, saying ""No"" with an assertive tone, making noise when he does that, turning on the vacuum cleaner whenever he touches the screens, closing him out of the room for 5 minutes each time, hissing like an idiot, even using plastic soft spikes did not stop him.  
In the same room there's a scratching post which he uses daily, so it's clear that he just wants to play more and more, but sadly, I have to work.

[1 Hour Camping With Cryptids Horror Story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CciTcNb44Q0)

Me and my two friends went on a 3-day camping trip last year, i saw something that I wasn‚Äôt supposed to see, and I‚Äôm not ready to go back there. You don‚Äôt have to believe me, but I just need someone to hear my story so I can finally put this thing behind me. Here‚Äôs my story

**Day 1**

The first day of our camping trip was everything I‚Äôd hoped for: long hikes, laughter echoing between the trees, and that fresh smell of pine that reminded me why we were out here, away from everything. Sam, Ben, and Lily were my best friends, and we‚Äôd been talking about this trip for months. Three days in the woods, just us, away from work, responsibilities, screens. It was perfect.

We‚Äôd chosen a spot deep within Pine Ridge, miles from any town. We‚Äôd seen maybe two other campers that day, but by evening it was just us, and the forest had gone dead silent.

We set up camp near a clearing, with a thick wall of trees behind us and the fire casting a circle of light that felt safe, almost cozy, if you ignored how dark it was outside its glow. As the night crept in, the air grew colder and sharper, and I could feel a tension I couldn‚Äôt quite place. At first, I chalked it up to excitement and maybe a bit of caffeine from the coffee I‚Äôd made right before we started hiking.

Lily was the first to break the quiet. ‚ÄúHey, who‚Äôs got a good ghost story?‚Äù She grinned, eyes catching the light, looking around at the rest of us, daring us to break the peace.

‚ÄúOh, I‚Äôve got one,‚Äù Ben said, rubbing his hands together like some villain in an old movie. ‚ÄúYou all know about the Pine Ridge Witch, right?‚Äù

The rest of us chuckled, but I noticed how Ben‚Äôs eyes had gone wide, almost theatrically so, as he leaned closer to the fire. ‚ÄúThey say she lives deep in these woods. That if you walk alone at night, you might see her pale face in the shadows, watching you. And if you‚Äôre unlucky, she‚Äôll follow you back to camp. She‚Äôs been around since the first settlers, they say, bound to the woods by some old curse.‚Äù

‚ÄúBen, that‚Äôs ridiculous.‚Äù Sam threw a twig into the fire, and it snapped with a spark, casting strange shapes onto the trunks around us. But there was something in Ben‚Äôs voice, a kind of tremor, like he almost believed his own tale.

We laughed it off and settled into a comfortable silence, each of us sipping our drinks and watching the fire crackle. That‚Äôs when I heard it.

A faint rustling in the underbrush, maybe fifteen feet behind me. I turned, expecting to see a rabbit or maybe a fox, but the darkness swallowed everything past the firelight. The noise stopped, but the silence that followed was even worse. It felt‚Ä¶ wrong, like something was watching us. My skin prickled, and I felt the need to break the quiet.

‚ÄúYou guys hear that?‚Äù

They all stopped, listening, but after a beat, Sam shrugged. ‚ÄúProbably just an animal. Nothing out here except squirrels and raccoons, maybe a deer if we‚Äôre lucky.‚Äù

He tried to laugh, but it came out forced. I could tell he was unnerved too.

But then it happened again, louder this time, like someone‚Äîor something‚Äîwas moving, a deliberate step in the leaves. I gripped my flashlight, sweeping it over the trees. ‚ÄúMaybe I should check it out?‚Äù

Sam gave me a look. ‚ÄúOr, maybe you shouldn‚Äôt.‚Äù

The thought had just formed when I saw it‚Äîa shape in the darkness, still and silent, but unmistakable. It was‚Ä¶ me. Standing just outside the fire‚Äôs light, partially hidden by the trees.

For a second, I thought I was seeing my own reflection, a trick of the fire and shadows. But the face‚Äîit was too pale, too motionless. My stomach dropped, and the light shook in my hand as I stared, transfixed.

‚ÄúJames, what‚Äôs up?‚Äù Ben called out, but his voice was faint, far away. I couldn‚Äôt look away from the figure, from‚Ä¶ myself.

I took a step back, my foot crunching in the leaves, and just like that, it was gone. No sound, no movement, just vanished.

Ben and Sam didn‚Äôt believe me, and it annoyed me, they knew i wasn‚Äôt the type to joke about this stuff.

Never the less we had to go to bed, i just wasn‚Äôt sure if i was seeing things or if this thing was real. I really just wanted Ben and Sam to believe me so we could go home.

**DAY 2**

¬†

I woke up on the second day of our camping trip with a splitting headache. The kind that feels like something heavy is pressing down on your skull. I rubbed my temples, trying to shake off the feeling, but that strange tension from last night lingered, prickling at the edges of my awareness. Maybe it was the poor sleep or Ben‚Äôs ghost story, but I felt like I hadn‚Äôt fully woken up.

The others were already up, huddled around the fire and talking in low voices. Lily looked up as I shuffled over, her face lighting up in that reassuring way of hers. ‚ÄúMorning, James! You okay?‚Äù

I gave a quick nod, brushing off my unease. ‚ÄúYeah, just‚Ä¶ didn‚Äôt sleep well.‚Äù

Ben shot me a grin. ‚ÄúYou freaked yourself out with that ghost story, huh?‚Äù He nudged Sam, who snickered.

I wanted to laugh along, but my mind kept flashing back to the figure I‚Äôd seen‚Äîor thought I‚Äôd seen‚Äîin the shadows. I could still picture its face, exactly like mine but somehow wrong. The skin had been too smooth, stretched like wax over the bones, and the eyes‚Ä¶ they‚Äôd looked right at me, without blinking.

‚ÄúHey, you with us, man?‚Äù Sam was looking at me, his head tilted slightly.

‚ÄúYeah, yeah.‚Äù I forced a smile, kicking myself for letting it get to me. I was probably just overtired or‚Ä¶ something. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs hit the trail.‚Äù

The plan for the day was to hike deeper into the woods and explore some of the rougher paths. I was determined to shake off whatever fog I was in. There was nothing out here, I told myself. Just trees and shadows and my overactive imagination. We‚Äôd come here to escape, to get away from work and the city, and I wasn‚Äôt about to let my own head ruin it.

But as we trekked through the dense underbrush, something felt‚Ä¶ off. I couldn‚Äôt put my finger on it. Everything seemed normal at first‚Äîthe trees towering above, the sunlight breaking through the branches, dappling the forest floor. The scent of pine was fresh and crisp. But the deeper we went, the more I felt like we weren‚Äôt alone.

It wasn‚Äôt just a feeling this time; there were signs. Strange signs. At one point, we came across a line of footprints, barely visible in the packed earth. They weren‚Äôt animal tracks, either. They looked almost human, but the shape was wrong‚Äîtoo narrow, the toes too elongated, like whoever had left them wasn‚Äôt quite‚Ä¶ human.

‚ÄúCheck this out,‚Äù I called, kneeling down by the tracks.

Ben leaned over my shoulder. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs probably just from another camper. Some people come out here barefoot, right?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, maybe.‚Äù I tried to sound casual, but my heart was thudding in my chest. The tracks looked fresh, almost as if they‚Äôd been made minutes before we arrived. And as we continued, I noticed more of them‚Äîalways close to our path, always just a little too recent.

We reached a clearing around noon, and everyone was ready for a break. Lily spread out a blanket, and we all collapsed around it, passing around snacks and water bottles. I tried to shake off the creeping unease, telling myself it was just a trick of my mind.

As I sat there, though, a strange feeling washed over me‚Äîa prickling at the back of my neck, like eyes boring into me. I looked around the clearing, scanning the trees, but I couldn‚Äôt see anything out of the ordinary. Still, I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling.

‚ÄúYou sure you‚Äôre okay, James?‚Äù Lily asked, looking at me with a raised brow.

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I muttered, not wanting to make a big deal of it. But I wasn‚Äôt convincing anyone. My friends exchanged glances, the kind you exchange when you‚Äôre not sure if someone is joking or genuinely losing it.

The rest of the day passed in a haze of forced conversations and strained laughter. My friends tried to cheer me up, making jokes and taking pictures of the scenery, but every time we stopped, I felt that same heavy weight pressing down on me, like a dark cloud I couldn‚Äôt escape. And whenever I glanced over my shoulder, I could have sworn I saw something moving between the trees‚Äîa flicker of a shape that disappeared whenever I tried to focus on it.

As dusk settled in, we made our way back to the campsite. The air had grown colder, and the trees seemed darker than they had that morning, their branches like bony fingers reaching down from the sky. We built up the fire quickly, everyone eager to banish the chill and huddle close to its warmth. The night was already settling in, and it seemed thicker, more oppressive than the night before.

By the time we finished dinner, I was exhausted, but sleep was the last thing on my mind. My friends drifted into easy conversation, but I could only listen half-heartedly, glancing out into the woods, scanning for any sign of movement. Every snap of a twig, every rustle of leaves, had me on edge.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre acting weird, man,‚Äù Ben finally said, nudging me. ‚ÄúYou really do think you saw something last night, don‚Äôt you?‚Äù

I opened my mouth to deny it, to laugh it off, but the words caught in my throat. I wanted to tell him, to explain what I‚Äôd seen, but I knew they wouldn‚Äôt understand. And truth be told, I didn‚Äôt really understand it myself.

‚ÄúIt was probably nothing,‚Äù I managed, forcing a grin. But the words felt empty, hollow.

The fire crackled, sending sparks dancing into the night, and for a brief moment, I felt a little more at ease. But then, just as quickly as it had come, the peace was shattered by a sound‚Äîa low, guttural growl, coming from somewhere just beyond the firelight.

Every head whipped around, eyes wide as we listened, straining to hear. The sound came again, closer this time, sending a chill down my spine.

‚ÄúDid‚Ä¶ did you guys hear that?‚Äù Lily whispered, her voice barely audible.

We all nodded, frozen in place. The growling grew louder, more insistent, and then we heard it‚Äîthe unmistakable sound of footsteps, heavy and deliberate, circling our campsite. My stomach twisted, and I gripped the flashlight, my fingers slick with sweat.

I turned it on and aimed it into the trees. The light cut through the darkness, illuminating the trunks and branches, but there was nothing there. Just shadows and silence.

‚ÄúJames, don‚Äôt,‚Äù Sam whispered, grabbing my arm. But I shrugged him off, stepping closer to the edge of the firelight.

And then I saw it.

A shape, barely visible between the trees, lurking in the shadows. It was just like last night‚Äîonly this time, it was more solid, more real. The figure stood there, watching me, its face just visible in the dim light. My heart stopped as I realized it was‚Ä¶ me, once again.

Only this time, the resemblance was even more disturbing. The figure‚Äôs eyes were hollow, empty black pits, and its mouth was twisted into a horrible grin, too wide, stretching across its face in a grotesque parody of my own expression.

I staggered back, my breath coming in shallow gasps. ‚ÄúGuys‚Ä¶ do you see that?‚Äù

They followed my gaze, but their faces remained blank, confused. ‚ÄúSee what, James?‚Äù Ben asked, a hint of irritation creeping into his voice.

The figure took a step closer, its movements jerky and unnatural, like a puppet on strings. I felt paralyzed, trapped between the creature and my friends‚Äô skeptical stares.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs right there!‚Äù I insisted, my voice rising in desperation. But when I looked back, the figure was gone, vanished into the shadows as if it had never been there.

My friends exchanged worried glances. ‚ÄúMaybe you need to lie down,‚Äù Sam suggested, his voice tight with concern.

I opened my mouth to argue, but I knew it was useless. They didn‚Äôt see it. They couldn‚Äôt see it.

As I lay in my tent that night, staring up at the dark canvas, I felt a creeping certainty settle over me. Whatever I‚Äôd seen, whatever was out there in the woods‚Ä¶ it was watching me. And it wasn‚Äôt done.

¬†

**Day 3**

¬†

I barely slept that second night. Every sound outside my tent jolted me awake, and every time I closed my eyes, I saw that‚Ä¶ *thing* staring back at me with my own face, twisted and wrong. By the time dawn finally broke, I was exhausted, strung out, my mind running in a thousand directions. I kept telling myself it was all in my head, that I was letting Ben‚Äôs ghost stories and the shadows play tricks on me. But deep down, I knew better.

I crawled out of my tent, blinking at the sunlight that pierced the trees. The others were already awake, sipping coffee and packing up the gear we‚Äôd scattered the night before. They looked up when I approached, and I could tell by their faces that I looked as terrible as I felt.

‚ÄúRough night?‚Äù Sam asked, trying to keep his tone light.

I nodded, not trusting myself to say anything. How could I explain what I‚Äôd seen? That I‚Äôd looked into the eyes of something wearing my face like a mask? That I felt like I was being hunted? They wouldn‚Äôt believe me. I wasn‚Äôt even sure I believed myself.

‚ÄúLook, man,‚Äù Ben said, clapping a hand on my shoulder, ‚Äúwe‚Äôre gonna have a good day today. Forget whatever freaked you out last night. We‚Äôre here to have fun, right?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I muttered, forcing a smile. But as I looked out into the forest, I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that something was watching us. I could almost feel its gaze, cold and heavy, pressing down on me.

We spent the day wandering further into the woods, but every step felt like a descent into darkness. The trees grew thicker, taller, closing in around us like a living wall. The air felt denser, colder, as if the forest itself were suffocating us. The others laughed, took photos, chatted, but their voices sounded distant, muffled, as though I were hearing them from the bottom of a well.

Around noon, we came across another strange sight‚Äîa pile of stones stacked in the middle of the trail. It looked like a cairn, but something about it felt‚Ä¶ wrong. The rocks were smeared with a dark, sticky substance that looked suspiciously like blood. I stopped, my skin prickling.

‚ÄúWhat‚Ä¶ is that?‚Äù Lily asked, her voice barely a whisper.

Ben laughed nervously. ‚ÄúProbably just a prank. Some other campers messing with us.‚Äù

But as I stared at the stones, a cold dread settled over me. This wasn‚Äôt a prank. It was a warning.

We skirted around the pile and kept walking, but the feeling of being watched grew stronger with every step. The forest was completely silent now, no birds, no rustling leaves, nothing. Just an oppressive, all-encompassing quiet that set my nerves on edge.

The others tried to laugh it off, to ignore the strange occurrences, but I could see the fear creeping into their eyes. We were all on edge, and I knew they could feel it too. We weren‚Äôt welcome here. We needed to leave.

When we finally made it back to camp, the sun was beginning to set. The sky turned a deep, angry red, casting long shadows across the ground. We sat around the fire, but the usual chatter and laughter were gone. No one wanted to say it, but we were all thinking the same thing‚Äîwe had overstayed our welcome.

As darkness settled over the forest, the tension grew unbearable. The fire crackled, sending shadows dancing across the trees, and every so often, I thought I saw something move just beyond the light. The others were quiet, shifting uncomfortably, each of us trapped in our own thoughts.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think I can sleep tonight,‚Äù Lily whispered, her voice barely audible over the crackling flames.

‚ÄúMe neither,‚Äù Sam muttered, his eyes fixed on the darkness beyond the firelight.

I felt a surge of relief, knowing I wasn‚Äôt alone in my fear. But it was a hollow comfort. Whatever was out there, it was closing in, waiting for the right moment.

Then, just as the fire began to die down, we heard it‚Äîa low, guttural growl, so close I could feel it vibrating in my chest. My heart pounded, and I saw my friends freeze, their faces pale in the dim light.

‚ÄúDid‚Ä¶ did you guys hear that?‚Äù Ben whispered, his voice trembling.

We all nodded, too afraid to speak. The growling grew louder, circling us, moving from one side of the campsite to the other. And then, out of the corner of my eye, I saw it‚Äîa shape in the darkness, just beyond the fire‚Äôs glow.

It was *me* again, but worse this time. The creature‚Äôs face was a twisted mockery of my own, its mouth stretched into a horrific grin that seemed to split its face in half. Its eyes were dark pits, empty and endless, and its limbs were too long, bending at unnatural angles.

I felt a scream rising in my throat, but I couldn‚Äôt move, couldn‚Äôt breathe. The creature stepped closer, its movements jerky, like it was trying to mimic the way I walked. It stopped just at the edge of the firelight, its empty eyes fixed on me.

‚ÄúJames?‚Äù Sam‚Äôs voice was barely a whisper, his gaze locked on the creature.

I opened my mouth to respond, but before I could speak, the creature did something that sent a chill down my spine‚Äîit *smiled*. Not a grin, not a mocking smirk, but a cold, lifeless smile, as if it were trying to comfort me. And then, in a voice that sounded like mine but twisted, distorted, it spoke.

‚ÄúCome with me.‚Äù

The words echoed through the silence, and I felt a wave of nausea wash over me. I wanted to run, to scream, to do anything to get away, but my body felt rooted to the ground.

Then, as quickly as it had appeared, the creature began to fade, dissolving into the darkness like smoke. The growling stopped, and the forest fell silent once more. My friends stared at me, their faces pale, their eyes wide with terror.

‚ÄúWhat‚Ä¶ what was that?‚Äù Lily whispered, her voice trembling.

I shook my head, unable to find the words. How could I explain that I‚Äôd been staring at myself? That something had taken my face, my voice, and used them to try and lure me into the darkness?

We spent the rest of the night huddled around the fire, too afraid to sleep, too afraid to move. Every sound, every shadow sent a fresh wave of fear through us, and by the time the first rays of sunlight pierced the trees, we were exhausted, shaken to the core.

We packed up in silence, no one daring to speak of what we‚Äôd seen. As we made our way out of the forest, I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that we were being watched, that the creature was still out there, waiting for us to return.

As we finally reached the edge of the forest and stepped into the safety of the open road, I glanced back one last time. And there, just beyond the trees, I saw it‚Äîa figure standing in the shadows, watching me. It was my own face staring back at me, that twisted, lifeless smile etched across its lips.

I turned away, my heart pounding, and we hurried back to the car. But as we drove away, I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that I‚Äôd left a part of myself in those woods. And deep down, I knew that no matter how far I went, no matter how hard I tried to forget, it would always be there, lurking in the shadows, waiting.

Waiting for me to come back...

I tried to get into oatmeal several times but it only stuck once I started making them creamy-style (cooked low and slow in milk). I can't stand the sticky,  claggy, dry texture of oats cooked on high heat!

I keep a bag of quick oats, milk, and frozen strawberries at work and make it there. 

I mix 1/4 mug of quick oats + half mug milk together in a bowl and cook in the microwave on low for 4-5 minutes, stirring a few times towards the end. I stir in a teaspoon of sugar at the end if I want.

In another bowl, I microwave 150g of strawberries for 2 minutes, until it's sweet and sticky. I pour that over my prepared oats and serve with coffee or earl grey.

My mind was foggy, and I felt like I could fall asleep right there on the steps outside the building. I just booked a Grab to ride to Mandaluyong, ready to just sit in silence, unwind, and process the day.

A few minutes later, a car pulled up, and the driver, who looked about my age, gave me a nod and a quick smile as I climbed into the backseat. ‚ÄúGood evening po‚Äù he greeted, his tone friendly but laid-back. He wore glasses that framed his face nicely, which instantly reminded me of my crush, and I could already feel a small grin forming as I settled in.

The car started moving, and we spent the first few minutes in silence, with the soft hum of the car and the occasional headlights of passing vehicles as our background. Then he asked, ‚ÄúNaglalaw school ka po? Ang bigat ng mga libro mo kanina, napansin ko.‚Äù

I blinked, a little surprised. ‚ÄúOo nga, grabe sa bigat. Sakto nga sa mood ko ‚Äòyung tahimik na biyahe ngayon,‚Äù I said, smiling as I tried to play it cool.

He chuckled, glancing at me in the rearview mirror. ‚ÄúSame tayo. Minsan mas gusto ko talaga tahimik, pero sayang naman ‚Äòyung pagkakataon na may ka-age na pwedeng makakwentuhan.‚Äù

He had a natural charm and an easy way with words. I found myself leaning forward a bit, somehow drawn in, and before I knew it, we were talking. We laughed about Manila‚Äôs chaotic traffic, swapped recommendations for the best late-night food spots, and even shared stories about college days and the small things we missed. I couldn‚Äôt remember the last time a conversation flowed this naturally, especially with a stranger.

There was an unexpected connection there, something a little more intense than simple small talk. I noticed his hands gripping the steering wheel with confidence, and when he‚Äôd glance back at me, there was a spark in his eyes, like he was just as drawn in by our conversation.

‚ÄúMay favorite ka bang spot sa Mandaluyong for coffee or anything? Baka next time ikaw naman mag-recommend,‚Äù he said, his voice soft but with a hint of something more.

A playful feeling stirred in me. ‚ÄúMeron. Pero baka may bayad ‚Äòyung recommendation ko,‚Äù I teased.

He laughed, his grin warm and a little mischievous. ‚ÄúSige, basta ba reasonable ‚Äòyung fee.‚Äù

As we got closer to my place, I found myself reluctant for the ride to end. I could feel the butterflies in my stomach, and yeah, maybe even something a bit more. There was something about the combination of his easy confidence, the late hour, and the intimacy of that shared space. I could feel the tension growing, the air thick with possibility.

We pulled up to my stop, and he turned around, meeting my eyes with that familiar spark. ‚ÄúSana okay ‚Äòyung biyahe, at hindi naman nakadagdag sa pagod mo.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay? More than okay,‚Äù I said, my voice a bit softer than I intended. ‚ÄúActually‚Ä¶baka gusto mo ng coffee next time. On me,‚Äù I added, feeling my cheeks warm as I said it.

His smile widened, his eyes still locked on mine. ‚ÄúLooking forward to it,‚Äù he replied, his voice low, almost like a promise.

I got out, closing the door behind me but taking one last look as he drove off. My heart was racing, and as I unlocked my door, I laughed at myself, thinking, So ganito pala pag single, kinikilig nalang kahit kanino. 

It was a simple moment, but it left me with that thrill that lasted for days. Kuya sana ikaw naman sakyan ko next time jk hahahahaha. Sana ikaw din mabook ko pag uuwi ako Cavite chos",5,1730718946.0,OffMyChestPH,1,0.86,False

Basically, you do surveys to earn points, and you can cash out once you have enough. Plus, they have a few bonus features to boost your earnings, which makes it a bit more interesting!

**Earn Money by Taking Surveys**  
The main thing here is the surveys. They‚Äôre usually pretty quick and straightforward, and you earn points for each one you complete. I‚Äôve been doing them during coffee breaks‚Äîit‚Äôs a nice way to feel productive and earn a little something on the side! ‚òïüí∏

**Earn by Playing Games: A Mix of Fun and Frustration ü§®**  
Prime Opinion actually lets you earn by playing games too, which is cool, but fair warning: some of these games can be a bit unpredictable with rewards. Some are worth it, while others make you work a little harder than I‚Äôd like. But hey, if you like gaming, it‚Äôs another way to earn while having fun. üéÆüïπÔ∏è

**Weekly Raffles: Win Up to 1,000 Points! üéÅ**  
If you‚Äôre consistent and do at least one survey every day for seven days, you get entered into a raffle. Last time, I won 500 points (roughly $5), which covered my coffee costs for the week! ‚òï Not a bad deal, so I try to keep up with the streak.

**Leveling Up: Unlock Extra Perks üìà**  
There‚Äôs a level system too, which makes it feel a bit like a game. Each time you level up, you unlock features and earn extra points. Maybe one day I‚Äôll hit level 99 and be the ""Survey King""! üëëüòÇ

**Quick Bonus: Use My Link for an Extra +10% on Surveys üéâ**  
If you use my link, you‚Äôll get a 10% bonus on surveys for your first 24 hours, which means you can boost your points right from the start! It‚Äôs a win-win for both of us. üéâ

**Leaderboard System: Serious Effort Needed üòÖ**  
There‚Äôs also a leaderboard, but I‚Äôll be honest‚Äîit‚Äôs a bit intense. I haven‚Äôt made it up there yet because you need to fill out a ton of surveys to stay on top. Maybe one day I‚Äôll reach ""survey warrior"" status!

**Create Virtual Credit Cards with Your Points üí≥**  
One of the coolest features: you can actually create virtual credit cards with your points. I made one for Amazon, and it worked perfectly. It‚Äôs a fun way to treat yourself with what you‚Äôve earned!

If you‚Äôre looking to make a little extra in your free time, Prime Opinion is worth a shot. I‚Äôve been using it while commuting or waiting around, and those points start adding up.

[1 Hour Camping With Cryptids Horror Story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CciTcNb44Q0)

Me and my two friends went on a 3-day camping trip last year, i saw something that I wasn‚Äôt supposed to see, and I‚Äôm not ready to go back there. You don‚Äôt have to believe me, but I just need someone to hear my story so I can finally put this thing behind me. Here‚Äôs my story

**Day 1**

The first day of our camping trip was everything I‚Äôd hoped for: long hikes, laughter echoing between the trees, and that fresh smell of pine that reminded me why we were out here, away from everything. Sam, Ben, and Lily were my best friends, and we‚Äôd been talking about this trip for months. Three days in the woods, just us, away from work, responsibilities, screens. It was perfect.

We‚Äôd chosen a spot deep within Pine Ridge, miles from any town. We‚Äôd seen maybe two other campers that day, but by evening it was just us, and the forest had gone dead silent.

We set up camp near a clearing, with a thick wall of trees behind us and the fire casting a circle of light that felt safe, almost cozy, if you ignored how dark it was outside its glow. As the night crept in, the air grew colder and sharper, and I could feel a tension I couldn‚Äôt quite place. At first, I chalked it up to excitement and maybe a bit of caffeine from the coffee I‚Äôd made right before we started hiking.

Lily was the first to break the quiet. ‚ÄúHey, who‚Äôs got a good ghost story?‚Äù She grinned, eyes catching the light, looking around at the rest of us, daring us to break the peace.

‚ÄúOh, I‚Äôve got one,‚Äù Ben said, rubbing his hands together like some villain in an old movie. ‚ÄúYou all know about the Pine Ridge Witch, right?‚Äù

The rest of us chuckled, but I noticed how Ben‚Äôs eyes had gone wide, almost theatrically so, as he leaned closer to the fire. ‚ÄúThey say she lives deep in these woods. That if you walk alone at night, you might see her pale face in the shadows, watching you. And if you‚Äôre unlucky, she‚Äôll follow you back to camp. She‚Äôs been around since the first settlers, they say, bound to the woods by some old curse.‚Äù

‚ÄúBen, that‚Äôs ridiculous.‚Äù Sam threw a twig into the fire, and it snapped with a spark, casting strange shapes onto the trunks around us. But there was something in Ben‚Äôs voice, a kind of tremor, like he almost believed his own tale.

We laughed it off and settled into a comfortable silence, each of us sipping our drinks and watching the fire crackle. That‚Äôs when I heard it.

A faint rustling in the underbrush, maybe fifteen feet behind me. I turned, expecting to see a rabbit or maybe a fox, but the darkness swallowed everything past the firelight. The noise stopped, but the silence that followed was even worse. It felt‚Ä¶ wrong, like something was watching us. My skin prickled, and I felt the need to break the quiet.

‚ÄúYou guys hear that?‚Äù

They all stopped, listening, but after a beat, Sam shrugged. ‚ÄúProbably just an animal. Nothing out here except squirrels and raccoons, maybe a deer if we‚Äôre lucky.‚Äù

He tried to laugh, but it came out forced. I could tell he was unnerved too.

But then it happened again, louder this time, like someone‚Äîor something‚Äîwas moving, a deliberate step in the leaves. I gripped my flashlight, sweeping it over the trees. ‚ÄúMaybe I should check it out?‚Äù

Sam gave me a look. ‚ÄúOr, maybe you shouldn‚Äôt.‚Äù

The thought had just formed when I saw it‚Äîa shape in the darkness, still and silent, but unmistakable. It was‚Ä¶ me. Standing just outside the fire‚Äôs light, partially hidden by the trees.

For a second, I thought I was seeing my own reflection, a trick of the fire and shadows. But the face‚Äîit was too pale, too motionless. My stomach dropped, and the light shook in my hand as I stared, transfixed.

‚ÄúJames, what‚Äôs up?‚Äù Ben called out, but his voice was faint, far away. I couldn‚Äôt look away from the figure, from‚Ä¶ myself.

I took a step back, my foot crunching in the leaves, and just like that, it was gone. No sound, no movement, just vanished.

Ben and Sam didn‚Äôt believe me, and it annoyed me, they knew i wasn‚Äôt the type to joke about this stuff.

Never the less we had to go to bed, i just wasn‚Äôt sure if i was seeing things or if this thing was real. I really just wanted Ben and Sam to believe me so we could go home.

**DAY 2**

¬†

I woke up on the second day of our camping trip with a splitting headache. The kind that feels like something heavy is pressing down on your skull. I rubbed my temples, trying to shake off the feeling, but that strange tension from last night lingered, prickling at the edges of my awareness. Maybe it was the poor sleep or Ben‚Äôs ghost story, but I felt like I hadn‚Äôt fully woken up.

The others were already up, huddled around the fire and talking in low voices. Lily looked up as I shuffled over, her face lighting up in that reassuring way of hers. ‚ÄúMorning, James! You okay?‚Äù

I gave a quick nod, brushing off my unease. ‚ÄúYeah, just‚Ä¶ didn‚Äôt sleep well.‚Äù

Ben shot me a grin. ‚ÄúYou freaked yourself out with that ghost story, huh?‚Äù He nudged Sam, who snickered.

I wanted to laugh along, but my mind kept flashing back to the figure I‚Äôd seen‚Äîor thought I‚Äôd seen‚Äîin the shadows. I could still picture its face, exactly like mine but somehow wrong. The skin had been too smooth, stretched like wax over the bones, and the eyes‚Ä¶ they‚Äôd looked right at me, without blinking.

‚ÄúHey, you with us, man?‚Äù Sam was looking at me, his head tilted slightly.

‚ÄúYeah, yeah.‚Äù I forced a smile, kicking myself for letting it get to me. I was probably just overtired or‚Ä¶ something. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs hit the trail.‚Äù

The plan for the day was to hike deeper into the woods and explore some of the rougher paths. I was determined to shake off whatever fog I was in. There was nothing out here, I told myself. Just trees and shadows and my overactive imagination. We‚Äôd come here to escape, to get away from work and the city, and I wasn‚Äôt about to let my own head ruin it.

But as we trekked through the dense underbrush, something felt‚Ä¶ off. I couldn‚Äôt put my finger on it. Everything seemed normal at first‚Äîthe trees towering above, the sunlight breaking through the branches, dappling the forest floor. The scent of pine was fresh and crisp. But the deeper we went, the more I felt like we weren‚Äôt alone.

It wasn‚Äôt just a feeling this time; there were signs. Strange signs. At one point, we came across a line of footprints, barely visible in the packed earth. They weren‚Äôt animal tracks, either. They looked almost human, but the shape was wrong‚Äîtoo narrow, the toes too elongated, like whoever had left them wasn‚Äôt quite‚Ä¶ human.

‚ÄúCheck this out,‚Äù I called, kneeling down by the tracks.

Ben leaned over my shoulder. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs probably just from another camper. Some people come out here barefoot, right?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, maybe.‚Äù I tried to sound casual, but my heart was thudding in my chest. The tracks looked fresh, almost as if they‚Äôd been made minutes before we arrived. And as we continued, I noticed more of them‚Äîalways close to our path, always just a little too recent.

We reached a clearing around noon, and everyone was ready for a break. Lily spread out a blanket, and we all collapsed around it, passing around snacks and water bottles. I tried to shake off the creeping unease, telling myself it was just a trick of my mind.

As I sat there, though, a strange feeling washed over me‚Äîa prickling at the back of my neck, like eyes boring into me. I looked around the clearing, scanning the trees, but I couldn‚Äôt see anything out of the ordinary. Still, I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling.

‚ÄúYou sure you‚Äôre okay, James?‚Äù Lily asked, looking at me with a raised brow.

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I muttered, not wanting to make a big deal of it. But I wasn‚Äôt convincing anyone. My friends exchanged glances, the kind you exchange when you‚Äôre not sure if someone is joking or genuinely losing it.

The rest of the day passed in a haze of forced conversations and strained laughter. My friends tried to cheer me up, making jokes and taking pictures of the scenery, but every time we stopped, I felt that same heavy weight pressing down on me, like a dark cloud I couldn‚Äôt escape. And whenever I glanced over my shoulder, I could have sworn I saw something moving between the trees‚Äîa flicker of a shape that disappeared whenever I tried to focus on it.

As dusk settled in, we made our way back to the campsite. The air had grown colder, and the trees seemed darker than they had that morning, their branches like bony fingers reaching down from the sky. We built up the fire quickly, everyone eager to banish the chill and huddle close to its warmth. The night was already settling in, and it seemed thicker, more oppressive than the night before.

By the time we finished dinner, I was exhausted, but sleep was the last thing on my mind. My friends drifted into easy conversation, but I could only listen half-heartedly, glancing out into the woods, scanning for any sign of movement. Every snap of a twig, every rustle of leaves, had me on edge.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre acting weird, man,‚Äù Ben finally said, nudging me. ‚ÄúYou really do think you saw something last night, don‚Äôt you?‚Äù

I opened my mouth to deny it, to laugh it off, but the words caught in my throat. I wanted to tell him, to explain what I‚Äôd seen, but I knew they wouldn‚Äôt understand. And truth be told, I didn‚Äôt really understand it myself.

‚ÄúIt was probably nothing,‚Äù I managed, forcing a grin. But the words felt empty, hollow.

The fire crackled, sending sparks dancing into the night, and for a brief moment, I felt a little more at ease. But then, just as quickly as it had come, the peace was shattered by a sound‚Äîa low, guttural growl, coming from somewhere just beyond the firelight.

Every head whipped around, eyes wide as we listened, straining to hear. The sound came again, closer this time, sending a chill down my spine.

‚ÄúDid‚Ä¶ did you guys hear that?‚Äù Lily whispered, her voice barely audible.

We all nodded, frozen in place. The growling grew louder, more insistent, and then we heard it‚Äîthe unmistakable sound of footsteps, heavy and deliberate, circling our campsite. My stomach twisted, and I gripped the flashlight, my fingers slick with sweat.

I turned it on and aimed it into the trees. The light cut through the darkness, illuminating the trunks and branches, but there was nothing there. Just shadows and silence.

‚ÄúJames, don‚Äôt,‚Äù Sam whispered, grabbing my arm. But I shrugged him off, stepping closer to the edge of the firelight.

And then I saw it.

A shape, barely visible between the trees, lurking in the shadows. It was just like last night‚Äîonly this time, it was more solid, more real. The figure stood there, watching me, its face just visible in the dim light. My heart stopped as I realized it was‚Ä¶ me, once again.

Only this time, the resemblance was even more disturbing. The figure‚Äôs eyes were hollow, empty black pits, and its mouth was twisted into a horrible grin, too wide, stretching across its face in a grotesque parody of my own expression.

I staggered back, my breath coming in shallow gasps. ‚ÄúGuys‚Ä¶ do you see that?‚Äù

They followed my gaze, but their faces remained blank, confused. ‚ÄúSee what, James?‚Äù Ben asked, a hint of irritation creeping into his voice.

The figure took a step closer, its movements jerky and unnatural, like a puppet on strings. I felt paralyzed, trapped between the creature and my friends‚Äô skeptical stares.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs right there!‚Äù I insisted, my voice rising in desperation. But when I looked back, the figure was gone, vanished into the shadows as if it had never been there.

My friends exchanged worried glances. ‚ÄúMaybe you need to lie down,‚Äù Sam suggested, his voice tight with concern.

I opened my mouth to argue, but I knew it was useless. They didn‚Äôt see it. They couldn‚Äôt see it.

As I lay in my tent that night, staring up at the dark canvas, I felt a creeping certainty settle over me. Whatever I‚Äôd seen, whatever was out there in the woods‚Ä¶ it was watching me. And it wasn‚Äôt done.

¬†

**Day 3**

¬†

I barely slept that second night. Every sound outside my tent jolted me awake, and every time I closed my eyes, I saw that‚Ä¶ *thing* staring back at me with my own face, twisted and wrong. By the time dawn finally broke, I was exhausted, strung out, my mind running in a thousand directions. I kept telling myself it was all in my head, that I was letting Ben‚Äôs ghost stories and the shadows play tricks on me. But deep down, I knew better.

I crawled out of my tent, blinking at the sunlight that pierced the trees. The others were already awake, sipping coffee and packing up the gear we‚Äôd scattered the night before. They looked up when I approached, and I could tell by their faces that I looked as terrible as I felt.

‚ÄúRough night?‚Äù Sam asked, trying to keep his tone light.

I nodded, not trusting myself to say anything. How could I explain what I‚Äôd seen? That I‚Äôd looked into the eyes of something wearing my face like a mask? That I felt like I was being hunted? They wouldn‚Äôt believe me. I wasn‚Äôt even sure I believed myself.

‚ÄúLook, man,‚Äù Ben said, clapping a hand on my shoulder, ‚Äúwe‚Äôre gonna have a good day today. Forget whatever freaked you out last night. We‚Äôre here to have fun, right?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I muttered, forcing a smile. But as I looked out into the forest, I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that something was watching us. I could almost feel its gaze, cold and heavy, pressing down on me.

We spent the day wandering further into the woods, but every step felt like a descent into darkness. The trees grew thicker, taller, closing in around us like a living wall. The air felt denser, colder, as if the forest itself were suffocating us. The others laughed, took photos, chatted, but their voices sounded distant, muffled, as though I were hearing them from the bottom of a well.

Around noon, we came across another strange sight‚Äîa pile of stones stacked in the middle of the trail. It looked like a cairn, but something about it felt‚Ä¶ wrong. The rocks were smeared with a dark, sticky substance that looked suspiciously like blood. I stopped, my skin prickling.

‚ÄúWhat‚Ä¶ is that?‚Äù Lily asked, her voice barely a whisper.

Ben laughed nervously. ‚ÄúProbably just a prank. Some other campers messing with us.‚Äù

But as I stared at the stones, a cold dread settled over me. This wasn‚Äôt a prank. It was a warning.

We skirted around the pile and kept walking, but the feeling of being watched grew stronger with every step. The forest was completely silent now, no birds, no rustling leaves, nothing. Just an oppressive, all-encompassing quiet that set my nerves on edge.

The others tried to laugh it off, to ignore the strange occurrences, but I could see the fear creeping into their eyes. We were all on edge, and I knew they could feel it too. We weren‚Äôt welcome here. We needed to leave.

When we finally made it back to camp, the sun was beginning to set. The sky turned a deep, angry red, casting long shadows across the ground. We sat around the fire, but the usual chatter and laughter were gone. No one wanted to say it, but we were all thinking the same thing‚Äîwe had overstayed our welcome.

As darkness settled over the forest, the tension grew unbearable. The fire crackled, sending shadows dancing across the trees, and every so often, I thought I saw something move just beyond the light. The others were quiet, shifting uncomfortably, each of us trapped in our own thoughts.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think I can sleep tonight,‚Äù Lily whispered, her voice barely audible over the crackling flames.

‚ÄúMe neither,‚Äù Sam muttered, his eyes fixed on the darkness beyond the firelight.

I felt a surge of relief, knowing I wasn‚Äôt alone in my fear. But it was a hollow comfort. Whatever was out there, it was closing in, waiting for the right moment.

Then, just as the fire began to die down, we heard it‚Äîa low, guttural growl, so close I could feel it vibrating in my chest. My heart pounded, and I saw my friends freeze, their faces pale in the dim light.

‚ÄúDid‚Ä¶ did you guys hear that?‚Äù Ben whispered, his voice trembling.

We all nodded, too afraid to speak. The growling grew louder, circling us, moving from one side of the campsite to the other. And then, out of the corner of my eye, I saw it‚Äîa shape in the darkness, just beyond the fire‚Äôs glow.

It was *me* again, but worse this time. The creature‚Äôs face was a twisted mockery of my own, its mouth stretched into a horrific grin that seemed to split its face in half. Its eyes were dark pits, empty and endless, and its limbs were too long, bending at unnatural angles.

I felt a scream rising in my throat, but I couldn‚Äôt move, couldn‚Äôt breathe. The creature stepped closer, its movements jerky, like it was trying to mimic the way I walked. It stopped just at the edge of the firelight, its empty eyes fixed on me.

‚ÄúJames?‚Äù Sam‚Äôs voice was barely a whisper, his gaze locked on the creature.

I opened my mouth to respond, but before I could speak, the creature did something that sent a chill down my spine‚Äîit *smiled*. Not a grin, not a mocking smirk, but a cold, lifeless smile, as if it were trying to comfort me. And then, in a voice that sounded like mine but twisted, distorted, it spoke.

‚ÄúCome with me.‚Äù

The words echoed through the silence, and I felt a wave of nausea wash over me. I wanted to run, to scream, to do anything to get away, but my body felt rooted to the ground.

Then, as quickly as it had appeared, the creature began to fade, dissolving into the darkness like smoke. The growling stopped, and the forest fell silent once more. My friends stared at me, their faces pale, their eyes wide with terror.

‚ÄúWhat‚Ä¶ what was that?‚Äù Lily whispered, her voice trembling.

I shook my head, unable to find the words. How could I explain that I‚Äôd been staring at myself? That something had taken my face, my voice, and used them to try and lure me into the darkness?

We spent the rest of the night huddled around the fire, too afraid to sleep, too afraid to move. Every sound, every shadow sent a fresh wave of fear through us, and by the time the first rays of sunlight pierced the trees, we were exhausted, shaken to the core.

We packed up in silence, no one daring to speak of what we‚Äôd seen. As we made our way out of the forest, I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that we were being watched, that the creature was still out there, waiting for us to return.

As we finally reached the edge of the forest and stepped into the safety of the open road, I glanced back one last time. And there, just beyond the trees, I saw it‚Äîa figure standing in the shadows, watching me. It was my own face staring back at me, that twisted, lifeless smile etched across its lips.

I turned away, my heart pounding, and we hurried back to the car. But as we drove away, I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that I‚Äôd left a part of myself in those woods. And deep down, I knew that no matter how far I went, no matter how hard I tried to forget, it would always be there, lurking in the shadows, waiting.

Waiting for me to come back...

[1 Hour Camping With Cryptids Horror Story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CciTcNb44Q0)

Me and my two friends went on a 3-day camping trip last year, i saw something that I wasn‚Äôt supposed to see, and I‚Äôm not ready to go back there. You don‚Äôt have to believe me, but I just need someone to hear my story so I can finally put this thing behind me. Here‚Äôs my story

**Day 1**

The first day of our camping trip was everything I‚Äôd hoped for: long hikes, laughter echoing between the trees, and that fresh smell of pine that reminded me why we were out here, away from everything. Sam, Ben, and Lily were my best friends, and we‚Äôd been talking about this trip for months. Three days in the woods, just us, away from work, responsibilities, screens. It was perfect.

We‚Äôd chosen a spot deep within Pine Ridge, miles from any town. We‚Äôd seen maybe two other campers that day, but by evening it was just us, and the forest had gone dead silent.

We set up camp near a clearing, with a thick wall of trees behind us and the fire casting a circle of light that felt safe, almost cozy, if you ignored how dark it was outside its glow. As the night crept in, the air grew colder and sharper, and I could feel a tension I couldn‚Äôt quite place. At first, I chalked it up to excitement and maybe a bit of caffeine from the coffee I‚Äôd made right before we started hiking.

Lily was the first to break the quiet. ‚ÄúHey, who‚Äôs got a good ghost story?‚Äù She grinned, eyes catching the light, looking around at the rest of us, daring us to break the peace.

‚ÄúOh, I‚Äôve got one,‚Äù Ben said, rubbing his hands together like some villain in an old movie. ‚ÄúYou all know about the Pine Ridge Witch, right?‚Äù

The rest of us chuckled, but I noticed how Ben‚Äôs eyes had gone wide, almost theatrically so, as he leaned closer to the fire. ‚ÄúThey say she lives deep in these woods. That if you walk alone at night, you might see her pale face in the shadows, watching you. And if you‚Äôre unlucky, she‚Äôll follow you back to camp. She‚Äôs been around since the first settlers, they say, bound to the woods by some old curse.‚Äù

‚ÄúBen, that‚Äôs ridiculous.‚Äù Sam threw a twig into the fire, and it snapped with a spark, casting strange shapes onto the trunks around us. But there was something in Ben‚Äôs voice, a kind of tremor, like he almost believed his own tale.

As I lay in my tent that night, staring up at the dark canvas, I felt a creeping certainty settle over me. Whatever I‚Äôd seen, whatever was out there in the woods‚Ä¶ it was watching me. And it wasn‚Äôt done.

¬†

**Day 3**

¬†

I barely slept that second night. Every sound outside my tent jolted me awake, and every time I closed my eyes, I saw that‚Ä¶ *thing* staring back at me with my own face, twisted and wrong. By the time dawn finally broke, I was exhausted, strung out, my mind running in a thousand directions. I kept telling myself it was all in my head, that I was letting Ben‚Äôs ghost stories and the shadows play tricks on me. But deep down, I knew better.

I crawled out of my tent, blinking at the sunlight that pierced the trees. The others were already awake, sipping coffee and packing up the gear we‚Äôd scattered the night before. They looked up when I approached, and I could tell by their faces that I looked as terrible as I felt.

‚ÄúRough night?‚Äù Sam asked, trying to keep his tone light.

I nodded, not trusting myself to say anything. How could I explain what I‚Äôd seen? That I‚Äôd looked into the eyes of something wearing my face like a mask? That I felt like I was being hunted? They wouldn‚Äôt believe me. I wasn‚Äôt even sure I believed myself.

‚ÄúLook, man,‚Äù Ben said, clapping a hand on my shoulder, ‚Äúwe‚Äôre gonna have a good day today. Forget whatever freaked you out last night. We‚Äôre here to have fun, right?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I muttered, forcing a smile. But as I looked out into the forest, I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that something was watching us. I could almost feel its gaze, cold and heavy, pressing down on me.

We spent the day wandering further into the woods, but every step felt like a descent into darkness. The trees grew thicker, taller, closing in around us like a living wall. The air felt denser, colder, as if the forest itself were suffocating us. The others laughed, took photos, chatted, but their voices sounded distant, muffled, as though I were hearing them from the bottom of a well.

Around noon, we came across another strange sight‚Äîa pile of stones stacked in the middle of the trail. It looked like a cairn, but something about it felt‚Ä¶ wrong. The rocks were smeared with a dark, sticky substance that looked suspiciously like blood. I stopped, my skin prickling.

‚ÄúWhat‚Ä¶ is that?‚Äù Lily asked, her voice barely a whisper.

Ben laughed nervously. ‚ÄúProbably just a prank. Some other campers messing with us.‚Äù

But as I stared at the stones, a cold dread settled over me. This wasn‚Äôt a prank. It was a warning.

We skirted around the pile and kept walking, but the feeling of being watched grew stronger with every step. The forest was completely silent now, no birds, no rustling leaves, nothing. Just an oppressive, all-encompassing quiet that set my nerves on edge.

The others tried to laugh it off, to ignore the strange occurrences, but I could see the fear creeping into their eyes. We were all on edge, and I knew they could feel it too. We weren‚Äôt welcome here. We needed to leave.

When we finally made it back to camp, the sun was beginning to set. The sky turned a deep, angry red, casting long shadows across the ground. We sat around the fire, but the usual chatter and laughter were gone. No one wanted to say it, but we were all thinking the same thing‚Äîwe had overstayed our welcome.

As darkness settled over the forest, the tension grew unbearable. The fire crackled, sending shadows dancing across the trees, and every so often, I thought I saw something move just beyond the light. The others were quiet, shifting uncomfortably, each of us trapped in our own thoughts.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think I can sleep tonight,‚Äù Lily whispered, her voice barely audible over the crackling flames.

‚ÄúMe neither,‚Äù Sam muttered, his eyes fixed on the darkness beyond the firelight.

I felt a surge of relief, knowing I wasn‚Äôt alone in my fear. But it was a hollow comfort. Whatever was out there, it was closing in, waiting for the right moment.

Then, just as the fire began to die down, we heard it‚Äîa low, guttural growl, so close I could feel it vibrating in my chest. My heart pounded, and I saw my friends freeze, their faces pale in the dim light.

‚ÄúDid‚Ä¶ did you guys hear that?‚Äù Ben whispered, his voice trembling.

We all nodded, too afraid to speak. The growling grew louder, circling us, moving from one side of the campsite to the other. And then, out of the corner of my eye, I saw it‚Äîa shape in the darkness, just beyond the fire‚Äôs glow.

It was *me* again, but worse this time. The creature‚Äôs face was a twisted mockery of my own, its mouth stretched into a horrific grin that seemed to split its face in half. Its eyes were dark pits, empty and endless, and its limbs were too long, bending at unnatural angles.

I felt a scream rising in my throat, but I couldn‚Äôt move, couldn‚Äôt breathe. The creature stepped closer, its movements jerky, like it was trying to mimic the way I walked. It stopped just at the edge of the firelight, its empty eyes fixed on me.

‚ÄúJames?‚Äù Sam‚Äôs voice was barely a whisper, his gaze locked on the creature.

I opened my mouth to respond, but before I could speak, the creature did something that sent a chill down my spine‚Äîit *smiled*. Not a grin, not a mocking smirk, but a cold, lifeless smile, as if it were trying to comfort me. And then, in a voice that sounded like mine but twisted, distorted, it spoke.

‚ÄúCome with me.‚Äù

The words echoed through the silence, and I felt a wave of nausea wash over me. I wanted to run, to scream, to do anything to get away, but my body felt rooted to the ground.

Then, as quickly as it had appeared, the creature began to fade, dissolving into the darkness like smoke. The growling stopped, and the forest fell silent once more. My friends stared at me, their faces pale, their eyes wide with terror.

‚ÄúWhat‚Ä¶ what was that?‚Äù Lily whispered, her voice trembling.

I shook my head, unable to find the words. How could I explain that I‚Äôd been staring at myself? That something had taken my face, my voice, and used them to try and lure me into the darkness?

We spent the rest of the night huddled around the fire, too afraid to sleep, too afraid to move. Every sound, every shadow sent a fresh wave of fear through us, and by the time the first rays of sunlight pierced the trees, we were exhausted, shaken to the core.

We packed up in silence, no one daring to speak of what we‚Äôd seen. As we made our way out of the forest, I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that we were being watched, that the creature was still out there, waiting for us to return.

As we finally reached the edge of the forest and stepped into the safety of the open road, I glanced back one last time. And there, just beyond the trees, I saw it‚Äîa figure standing in the shadows, watching me. It was my own face staring back at me, that twisted, lifeless smile etched across its lips.

I turned away, my heart pounding, and we hurried back to the car. But as we drove away, I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that I‚Äôd left a part of myself in those woods. And deep down, I knew that no matter how far I went, no matter how hard I tried to forget, it would always be there, lurking in the shadows, waiting.

Waiting for me to come back...

You know that the moka is made by two parts where you screw it together. that part isnt smooth but it's rough like there is a substance. I cleaned with soap everything and when i was wiping it up, that screwing part was loosing some metal tiny chunks of stuff that colored my sheet to a grey color.

before this rainbow i tried to buy some express moka, the classic one. someone has a perfect screw component, smooth. Others the screw component are little damaged and when you screw it together, you have this rub sensation where the metal rub to the other metal and starts to lose metal. the problem is that if that's the case, when you screw it toegether, it's possible that some chunks of metal will go into the coffee and you will drink the coffee

[1 Hour Camping With Cryptids Horror Story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CciTcNb44Q0)

Me and my two friends went on a 3-day camping trip last year, i saw something that I wasn‚Äôt supposed to see, and I‚Äôm not ready to go back there. You don‚Äôt have to believe me, but I just need someone to hear my story so I can finally put this thing behind me. Here‚Äôs my story

**Day 1**

The first day of our camping trip was everything I‚Äôd hoped for: long hikes, laughter echoing between the trees, and that fresh smell of pine that reminded me why we were out here, away from everything. Sam, Ben, and Lily were my best friends, and we‚Äôd been talking about this trip for months. Three days in the woods, just us, away from work, responsibilities, screens. It was perfect.

We‚Äôd chosen a spot deep within Pine Ridge, miles from any town. We‚Äôd seen maybe two other campers that day, but by evening it was just us, and the forest had gone dead silent.

We set up camp near a clearing, with a thick wall of trees behind us and the fire casting a circle of light that felt safe, almost cozy, if you ignored how dark it was outside its glow. As the night crept in, the air grew colder and sharper, and I could feel a tension I couldn‚Äôt quite place. At first, I chalked it up to excitement and maybe a bit of caffeine from the coffee I‚Äôd made right before we started hiking.

Lily was the first to break the quiet. ‚ÄúHey, who‚Äôs got a good ghost story?‚Äù She grinned, eyes catching the light, looking around at the rest of us, daring us to break the peace.

‚ÄúOh, I‚Äôve got one,‚Äù Ben said, rubbing his hands together like some villain in an old movie. ‚ÄúYou all know about the Pine Ridge Witch, right?‚Äù

The rest of us chuckled, but I noticed how Ben‚Äôs eyes had gone wide, almost theatrically so, as he leaned closer to the fire. ‚ÄúThey say she lives deep in these woods. That if you walk alone at night, you might see her pale face in the shadows, watching you. And if you‚Äôre unlucky, she‚Äôll follow you back to camp. She‚Äôs been around since the first settlers, they say, bound to the woods by some old curse.‚Äù

‚ÄúBen, that‚Äôs ridiculous.‚Äù Sam threw a twig into the fire, and it snapped with a spark, casting strange shapes onto the trunks around us. But there was something in Ben‚Äôs voice, a kind of tremor, like he almost believed his own tale.

We laughed it off and settled into a comfortable silence, each of us sipping our drinks and watching the fire crackle. That‚Äôs when I heard it.

A faint rustling in the underbrush, maybe fifteen feet behind me. I turned, expecting to see a rabbit or maybe a fox, but the darkness swallowed everything past the firelight. The noise stopped, but the silence that followed was even worse. It felt‚Ä¶ wrong, like something was watching us. My skin prickled, and I felt the need to break the quiet.

‚ÄúYou guys hear that?‚Äù

They all stopped, listening, but after a beat, Sam shrugged. ‚ÄúProbably just an animal. Nothing out here except squirrels and raccoons, maybe a deer if we‚Äôre lucky.‚Äù

He tried to laugh, but it came out forced. I could tell he was unnerved too.

But then it happened again, louder this time, like someone‚Äîor something‚Äîwas moving, a deliberate step in the leaves. I gripped my flashlight, sweeping it over the trees. ‚ÄúMaybe I should check it out?‚Äù

Sam gave me a look. ‚ÄúOr, maybe you shouldn‚Äôt.‚Äù

The thought had just formed when I saw it‚Äîa shape in the darkness, still and silent, but unmistakable. It was‚Ä¶ me. Standing just outside the fire‚Äôs light, partially hidden by the trees.

For a second, I thought I was seeing my own reflection, a trick of the fire and shadows. But the face‚Äîit was too pale, too motionless. My stomach dropped, and the light shook in my hand as I stared, transfixed.

‚ÄúJames, what‚Äôs up?‚Äù Ben called out, but his voice was faint, far away. I couldn‚Äôt look away from the figure, from‚Ä¶ myself.

I took a step back, my foot crunching in the leaves, and just like that, it was gone. No sound, no movement, just vanished.

Ben and Sam didn‚Äôt believe me, and it annoyed me, they knew i wasn‚Äôt the type to joke about this stuff.

Never the less we had to go to bed, i just wasn‚Äôt sure if i was seeing things or if this thing was real. I really just wanted Ben and Sam to believe me so we could go home.

¬†

**DAY 2**

¬†

I woke up on the second day of our camping trip with a splitting headache. The kind that feels like something heavy is pressing down on your skull. I rubbed my temples, trying to shake off the feeling, but that strange tension from last night lingered, prickling at the edges of my awareness. Maybe it was the poor sleep or Ben‚Äôs ghost story, but I felt like I hadn‚Äôt fully woken up.

The others were already up, huddled around the fire and talking in low voices. Lily looked up as I shuffled over, her face lighting up in that reassuring way of hers. ‚ÄúMorning, James! You okay?‚Äù

I gave a quick nod, brushing off my unease. ‚ÄúYeah, just‚Ä¶ didn‚Äôt sleep well.‚Äù

Ben shot me a grin. ‚ÄúYou freaked yourself out with that ghost story, huh?‚Äù He nudged Sam, who snickered.

I wanted to laugh along, but my mind kept flashing back to the figure I‚Äôd seen‚Äîor thought I‚Äôd seen‚Äîin the shadows. I could still picture its face, exactly like mine but somehow wrong. The skin had been too smooth, stretched like wax over the bones, and the eyes‚Ä¶ they‚Äôd looked right at me, without blinking.

‚ÄúHey, you with us, man?‚Äù Sam was looking at me, his head tilted slightly.

‚ÄúYeah, yeah.‚Äù I forced a smile, kicking myself for letting it get to me. I was probably just overtired or‚Ä¶ something. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs hit the trail.‚Äù

The plan for the day was to hike deeper into the woods and explore some of the rougher paths. I was determined to shake off whatever fog I was in. There was nothing out here, I told myself. Just trees and shadows and my overactive imagination. We‚Äôd come here to escape, to get away from work and the city, and I wasn‚Äôt about to let my own head ruin it.

But as we trekked through the dense underbrush, something felt‚Ä¶ off. I couldn‚Äôt put my finger on it. Everything seemed normal at first‚Äîthe trees towering above, the sunlight breaking through the branches, dappling the forest floor. The scent of pine was fresh and crisp. But the deeper we went, the more I felt like we weren‚Äôt alone.

It wasn‚Äôt just a feeling this time; there were signs. Strange signs. At one point, we came across a line of footprints, barely visible in the packed earth. They weren‚Äôt animal tracks, either. They looked almost human, but the shape was wrong‚Äîtoo narrow, the toes too elongated, like whoever had left them wasn‚Äôt quite‚Ä¶ human.

‚ÄúCheck this out,‚Äù I called, kneeling down by the tracks.

Ben leaned over my shoulder. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs probably just from another camper. Some people come out here barefoot, right?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, maybe.‚Äù I tried to sound casual, but my heart was thudding in my chest. The tracks looked fresh, almost as if they‚Äôd been made minutes before we arrived. And as we continued, I noticed more of them‚Äîalways close to our path, always just a little too recent.

We reached a clearing around noon, and everyone was ready for a break. Lily spread out a blanket, and we all collapsed around it, passing around snacks and water bottles. I tried to shake off the creeping unease, telling myself it was just a trick of my mind.

As I sat there, though, a strange feeling washed over me‚Äîa prickling at the back of my neck, like eyes boring into me. I looked around the clearing, scanning the trees, but I couldn‚Äôt see anything out of the ordinary. Still, I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling.

‚ÄúYou sure you‚Äôre okay, James?‚Äù Lily asked, looking at me with a raised brow.

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I muttered, not wanting to make a big deal of it. But I wasn‚Äôt convincing anyone. My friends exchanged glances, the kind you exchange when you‚Äôre not sure if someone is joking or genuinely losing it.

The rest of the day passed in a haze of forced conversations and strained laughter. My friends tried to cheer me up, making jokes and taking pictures of the scenery, but every time we stopped, I felt that same heavy weight pressing down on me, like a dark cloud I couldn‚Äôt escape. And whenever I glanced over my shoulder, I could have sworn I saw something moving between the trees‚Äîa flicker of a shape that disappeared whenever I tried to focus on it.

As dusk settled in, we made our way back to the campsite. The air had grown colder, and the trees seemed darker than they had that morning, their branches like bony fingers reaching down from the sky. We built up the fire quickly, everyone eager to banish the chill and huddle close to its warmth. The night was already settling in, and it seemed thicker, more oppressive than the night before.

By the time we finished dinner, I was exhausted, but sleep was the last thing on my mind. My friends drifted into easy conversation, but I could only listen half-heartedly, glancing out into the woods, scanning for any sign of movement. Every snap of a twig, every rustle of leaves, had me on edge.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre acting weird, man,‚Äù Ben finally said, nudging me. ‚ÄúYou really do think you saw something last night, don‚Äôt you?‚Äù

I opened my mouth to deny it, to laugh it off, but the words caught in my throat. I wanted to tell him, to explain what I‚Äôd seen, but I knew they wouldn‚Äôt understand. And truth be told, I didn‚Äôt really understand it myself.

‚ÄúIt was probably nothing,‚Äù I managed, forcing a grin. But the words felt empty, hollow.

The fire crackled, sending sparks dancing into the night, and for a brief moment, I felt a little more at ease. But then, just as quickly as it had come, the peace was shattered by a sound‚Äîa low, guttural growl, coming from somewhere just beyond the firelight.

Every head whipped around, eyes wide as we listened, straining to hear. The sound came again, closer this time, sending a chill down my spine.

‚ÄúDid‚Ä¶ did you guys hear that?‚Äù Lily whispered, her voice barely audible.

We all nodded, frozen in place. The growling grew louder, more insistent, and then we heard it‚Äîthe unmistakable sound of footsteps, heavy and deliberate, circling our campsite. My stomach twisted, and I gripped the flashlight, my fingers slick with sweat.

I turned it on and aimed it into the trees. The light cut through the darkness, illuminating the trunks and branches, but there was nothing there. Just shadows and silence.

‚ÄúJames, don‚Äôt,‚Äù Sam whispered, grabbing my arm. But I shrugged him off, stepping closer to the edge of the firelight.

And then I saw it.

A shape, barely visible between the trees, lurking in the shadows. It was just like last night‚Äîonly this time, it was more solid, more real. The figure stood there, watching me, its face just visible in the dim light. My heart stopped as I realized it was‚Ä¶ me, once again.

Only this time, the resemblance was even more disturbing. The figure‚Äôs eyes were hollow, empty black pits, and its mouth was twisted into a horrible grin, too wide, stretching across its face in a grotesque parody of my own expression.

I staggered back, my breath coming in shallow gasps. ‚ÄúGuys‚Ä¶ do you see that?‚Äù

They followed my gaze, but their faces remained blank, confused. ‚ÄúSee what, James?‚Äù Ben asked, a hint of irritation creeping into his voice.

The figure took a step closer, its movements jerky and unnatural, like a puppet on strings. I felt paralyzed, trapped between the creature and my friends‚Äô skeptical stares.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs right there!‚Äù I insisted, my voice rising in desperation. But when I looked back, the figure was gone, vanished into the shadows as if it had never been there.

My friends exchanged worried glances. ‚ÄúMaybe you need to lie down,‚Äù Sam suggested, his voice tight with concern.

I opened my mouth to argue, but I knew it was useless. They didn‚Äôt see it. They couldn‚Äôt see it.

As I lay in my tent that night, staring up at the dark canvas, I felt a creeping certainty settle over me. Whatever I‚Äôd seen, whatever was out there in the woods‚Ä¶ it was watching me. And it wasn‚Äôt done.

Passionfruit and mango yoghurt tasting notes.

Beans look darker than other decafs, suspect Oddkin roast on the darker side (matches a previous purchase from them also).

V60, Tetsu method, 86c, 75g bloom 45 secs, 5 high agitation pours, 4:10 TBT. Strong mango and passionfruit nose, which comes through on palate also. Juicy acidity upfront, but lovely lingering sweetness at the end. Maybe a touch thin. Will try 88c next time.

Highly recommend.

Me and my two friends went on a 3-day camping trip last year, i saw something that I wasn‚Äôt supposed to see, and I‚Äôm not ready to go back there. You don‚Äôt have to believe me, but I just need someone to hear my story so I can finally put this thing behind me. Here‚Äôs my story

**Day 1**

The first day of our camping trip was everything I‚Äôd hoped for: long hikes, laughter echoing between the trees, and that fresh smell of pine that reminded me why we were out here, away from everything. Sam, Ben, and Lily were my best friends, and we‚Äôd been talking about this trip for months. Three days in the woods, just us, away from work, responsibilities, screens. It was perfect.

We‚Äôd chosen a spot deep within Pine Ridge, miles from any town. We‚Äôd seen maybe two other campers that day, but by evening it was just us, and the forest had gone dead silent.

We set up camp near a clearing, with a thick wall of trees behind us and the fire casting a circle of light that felt safe, almost cozy, if you ignored how dark it was outside its glow. As the night crept in, the air grew colder and sharper, and I could feel a tension I couldn‚Äôt quite place. At first, I chalked it up to excitement and maybe a bit of caffeine from the coffee I‚Äôd made right before we started hiking.

Lily was the first to break the quiet. ‚ÄúHey, who‚Äôs got a good ghost story?‚Äù She grinned, eyes catching the light, looking around at the rest of us, daring us to break the peace.

‚ÄúOh, I‚Äôve got one,‚Äù Ben said, rubbing his hands together like some villain in an old movie. ‚ÄúYou all know about the Pine Ridge Witch, right?‚Äù

The rest of us chuckled, but I noticed how Ben‚Äôs eyes had gone wide, almost theatrically so, as he leaned closer to the fire. ‚ÄúThey say she lives deep in these woods. That if you walk alone at night, you might see her pale face in the shadows, watching you. And if you‚Äôre unlucky, she‚Äôll follow you back to camp. She‚Äôs been around since the first settlers, they say, bound to the woods by some old curse.‚Äù

‚ÄúBen, that‚Äôs ridiculous.‚Äù Sam threw a twig into the fire, and it snapped with a spark, casting strange shapes onto the trunks around us. But there was something in Ben‚Äôs voice, a kind of tremor, like he almost believed his own tale.

We laughed it off and settled into a comfortable silence, each of us sipping our drinks and watching the fire crackle. That‚Äôs when I heard it.

A faint rustling in the underbrush, maybe fifteen feet behind me. I turned, expecting to see a rabbit or maybe a fox, but the darkness swallowed everything past the firelight. The noise stopped, but the silence that followed was even worse. It felt‚Ä¶ wrong, like something was watching us. My skin prickled, and I felt the need to break the quiet.

‚ÄúYou guys hear that?‚Äù

They all stopped, listening, but after a beat, Sam shrugged. ‚ÄúProbably just an animal. Nothing out here except squirrels and raccoons, maybe a deer if we‚Äôre lucky.‚Äù

He tried to laugh, but it came out forced. I could tell he was unnerved too.

But then it happened again, louder this time, like someone‚Äîor something‚Äîwas moving, a deliberate step in the leaves. I gripped my flashlight, sweeping it over the trees. ‚ÄúMaybe I should check it out?‚Äù

Sam gave me a look. ‚ÄúOr, maybe you shouldn‚Äôt.‚Äù

The thought had just formed when I saw it‚Äîa shape in the darkness, still and silent, but unmistakable. It was‚Ä¶ me. Standing just outside the fire‚Äôs light, partially hidden by the trees.

For a second, I thought I was seeing my own reflection, a trick of the fire and shadows. But the face‚Äîit was too pale, too motionless. My stomach dropped, and the light shook in my hand as I stared, transfixed.

‚ÄúJames, what‚Äôs up?‚Äù Ben called out, but his voice was faint, far away. I couldn‚Äôt look away from the figure, from‚Ä¶ myself.

I took a step back, my foot crunching in the leaves, and just like that, it was gone. No sound, no movement, just vanished.

Ben and Sam didn‚Äôt believe me, and it annoyed me, they knew i wasn‚Äôt the type to joke about this stuff.

Never the less we had to go to bed, i just wasn‚Äôt sure if i was seeing things or if this thing was real. I really just wanted Ben and Sam to believe me so we could go home.

¬†

**DAY 2**

¬†

I woke up on the second day of our camping trip with a splitting headache. The kind that feels like something heavy is pressing down on your skull. I rubbed my temples, trying to shake off the feeling, but that strange tension from last night lingered, prickling at the edges of my awareness. Maybe it was the poor sleep or Ben‚Äôs ghost story, but I felt like I hadn‚Äôt fully woken up.

The others were already up, huddled around the fire and talking in low voices. Lily looked up as I shuffled over, her face lighting up in that reassuring way of hers. ‚ÄúMorning, James! You okay?‚Äù

I gave a quick nod, brushing off my unease. ‚ÄúYeah, just‚Ä¶ didn‚Äôt sleep well.‚Äù

Ben shot me a grin. ‚ÄúYou freaked yourself out with that ghost story, huh?‚Äù He nudged Sam, who snickered.

I wanted to laugh along, but my mind kept flashing back to the figure I‚Äôd seen‚Äîor thought I‚Äôd seen‚Äîin the shadows. I could still picture its face, exactly like mine but somehow wrong. The skin had been too smooth, stretched like wax over the bones, and the eyes‚Ä¶ they‚Äôd looked right at me, without blinking.

‚ÄúHey, you with us, man?‚Äù Sam was looking at me, his head tilted slightly.

‚ÄúYeah, yeah.‚Äù I forced a smile, kicking myself for letting it get to me. I was probably just overtired or‚Ä¶ something. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs hit the trail.‚Äù

The plan for the day was to hike deeper into the woods and explore some of the rougher paths. I was determined to shake off whatever fog I was in. There was nothing out here, I told myself. Just trees and shadows and my overactive imagination. We‚Äôd come here to escape, to get away from work and the city, and I wasn‚Äôt about to let my own head ruin it.

But as we trekked through the dense underbrush, something felt‚Ä¶ off. I couldn‚Äôt put my finger on it. Everything seemed normal at first‚Äîthe trees towering above, the sunlight breaking through the branches, dappling the forest floor. The scent of pine was fresh and crisp. But the deeper we went, the more I felt like we weren‚Äôt alone.

It wasn‚Äôt just a feeling this time; there were signs. Strange signs. At one point, we came across a line of footprints, barely visible in the packed earth. They weren‚Äôt animal tracks, either. They looked almost human, but the shape was wrong‚Äîtoo narrow, the toes too elongated, like whoever had left them wasn‚Äôt quite‚Ä¶ human.

‚ÄúCheck this out,‚Äù I called, kneeling down by the tracks.

Ben leaned over my shoulder. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs probably just from another camper. Some people come out here barefoot, right?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, maybe.‚Äù I tried to sound casual, but my heart was thudding in my chest. The tracks looked fresh, almost as if they‚Äôd been made minutes before we arrived. And as we continued, I noticed more of them‚Äîalways close to our path, always just a little too recent.

We reached a clearing around noon, and everyone was ready for a break. Lily spread out a blanket, and we all collapsed around it, passing around snacks and water bottles. I tried to shake off the creeping unease, telling myself it was just a trick of my mind.

As I sat there, though, a strange feeling washed over me‚Äîa prickling at the back of my neck, like eyes boring into me. I looked around the clearing, scanning the trees, but I couldn‚Äôt see anything out of the ordinary. Still, I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling.

‚ÄúYou sure you‚Äôre okay, James?‚Äù Lily asked, looking at me with a raised brow.

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I muttered, not wanting to make a big deal of it. But I wasn‚Äôt convincing anyone. My friends exchanged glances, the kind you exchange when you‚Äôre not sure if someone is joking or genuinely losing it.

The rest of the day passed in a haze of forced conversations and strained laughter. My friends tried to cheer me up, making jokes and taking pictures of the scenery, but every time we stopped, I felt that same heavy weight pressing down on me, like a dark cloud I couldn‚Äôt escape. And whenever I glanced over my shoulder, I could have sworn I saw something moving between the trees‚Äîa flicker of a shape that disappeared whenever I tried to focus on it.

As dusk settled in, we made our way back to the campsite. The air had grown colder, and the trees seemed darker than they had that morning, their branches like bony fingers reaching down from the sky. We built up the fire quickly, everyone eager to banish the chill and huddle close to its warmth. The night was already settling in, and it seemed thicker, more oppressive than the night before.

By the time we finished dinner, I was exhausted, but sleep was the last thing on my mind. My friends drifted into easy conversation, but I could only listen half-heartedly, glancing out into the woods, scanning for any sign of movement. Every snap of a twig, every rustle of leaves, had me on edge.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre acting weird, man,‚Äù Ben finally said, nudging me. ‚ÄúYou really do think you saw something last night, don‚Äôt you?‚Äù

I opened my mouth to deny it, to laugh it off, but the words caught in my throat. I wanted to tell him, to explain what I‚Äôd seen, but I knew they wouldn‚Äôt understand. And truth be told, I didn‚Äôt really understand it myself.

‚ÄúIt was probably nothing,‚Äù I managed, forcing a grin. But the words felt empty, hollow.

The fire crackled, sending sparks dancing into the night, and for a brief moment, I felt a little more at ease. But then, just as quickly as it had come, the peace was shattered by a sound‚Äîa low, guttural growl, coming from somewhere just beyond the firelight.

Every head whipped around, eyes wide as we listened, straining to hear. The sound came again, closer this time, sending a chill down my spine.

‚ÄúDid‚Ä¶ did you guys hear that?‚Äù Lily whispered, her voice barely audible.

We all nodded, frozen in place. The growling grew louder, more insistent, and then we heard it‚Äîthe unmistakable sound of footsteps, heavy and deliberate, circling our campsite. My stomach twisted, and I gripped the flashlight, my fingers slick with sweat.

I turned it on and aimed it into the trees. The light cut through the darkness, illuminating the trunks and branches, but there was nothing there. Just shadows and silence.

‚ÄúJames, don‚Äôt,‚Äù Sam whispered, grabbing my arm. But I shrugged him off, stepping closer to the edge of the firelight.

And then I saw it.

A shape, barely visible between the trees, lurking in the shadows. It was just like last night‚Äîonly this time, it was more solid, more real. The figure stood there, watching me, its face just visible in the dim light. My heart stopped as I realized it was‚Ä¶ me, once again.

Only this time, the resemblance was even more disturbing. The figure‚Äôs eyes were hollow, empty black pits, and its mouth was twisted into a horrible grin, too wide, stretching across its face in a grotesque parody of my own expression.

I staggered back, my breath coming in shallow gasps. ‚ÄúGuys‚Ä¶ do you see that?‚Äù

They followed my gaze, but their faces remained blank, confused. ‚ÄúSee what, James?‚Äù Ben asked, a hint of irritation creeping into his voice.

The figure took a step closer, its movements jerky and unnatural, like a puppet on strings. I felt paralyzed, trapped between the creature and my friends‚Äô skeptical stares.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs right there!‚Äù I insisted, my voice rising in desperation. But when I looked back, the figure was gone, vanished into the shadows as if it had never been there.

My friends exchanged worried glances. ‚ÄúMaybe you need to lie down,‚Äù Sam suggested, his voice tight with concern.

I opened my mouth to argue, but I knew it was useless. They didn‚Äôt see it. They couldn‚Äôt see it.

As I lay in my tent that night, staring up at the dark canvas, I felt a creeping certainty settle over me. Whatever I‚Äôd seen, whatever was out there in the woods‚Ä¶ it was watching me. And it wasn‚Äôt done.

¬†

**Day 3**

¬†

I barely slept that second night. Every sound outside my tent jolted me awake, and every time I closed my eyes, I saw that‚Ä¶ *thing* staring back at me with my own face, twisted and wrong. By the time dawn finally broke, I was exhausted, strung out, my mind running in a thousand directions. I kept telling myself it was all in my head, that I was letting Ben‚Äôs ghost stories and the shadows play tricks on me. But deep down, I knew better.

I crawled out of my tent, blinking at the sunlight that pierced the trees. The others were already awake, sipping coffee and packing up the gear we‚Äôd scattered the night before. They looked up when I approached, and I could tell by their faces that I looked as terrible as I felt.

‚ÄúRough night?‚Äù Sam asked, trying to keep his tone light.

I nodded, not trusting myself to say anything. How could I explain what I‚Äôd seen? That I‚Äôd looked into the eyes of something wearing my face like a mask? That I felt like I was being hunted? They wouldn‚Äôt believe me. I wasn‚Äôt even sure I believed myself.

‚ÄúLook, man,‚Äù Ben said, clapping a hand on my shoulder, ‚Äúwe‚Äôre gonna have a good day today. Forget whatever freaked you out last night. We‚Äôre here to have fun, right?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I muttered, forcing a smile. But as I looked out into the forest, I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that something was watching us. I could almost feel its gaze, cold and heavy, pressing down on me.

We spent the day wandering further into the woods, but every step felt like a descent into darkness. The trees grew thicker, taller, closing in around us like a living wall. The air felt denser, colder, as if the forest itself were suffocating us. The others laughed, took photos, chatted, but their voices sounded distant, muffled, as though I were hearing them from the bottom of a well.

Around noon, we came across another strange sight‚Äîa pile of stones stacked in the middle of the trail. It looked like a cairn, but something about it felt‚Ä¶ wrong. The rocks were smeared with a dark, sticky substance that looked suspiciously like blood. I stopped, my skin prickling.

‚ÄúWhat‚Ä¶ is that?‚Äù Lily asked, her voice barely a whisper.

Ben laughed nervously. ‚ÄúProbably just a prank. Some other campers messing with us.‚Äù

But as I stared at the stones, a cold dread settled over me. This wasn‚Äôt a prank. It was a warning.

We skirted around the pile and kept walking, but the feeling of being watched grew stronger with every step. The forest was completely silent now, no birds, no rustling leaves, nothing. Just an oppressive, all-encompassing quiet that set my nerves on edge.

The others tried to laugh it off, to ignore the strange occurrences, but I could see the fear creeping into their eyes. We were all on edge, and I knew they could feel it too. We weren‚Äôt welcome here. We needed to leave.

When we finally made it back to camp, the sun was beginning to set. The sky turned a deep, angry red, casting long shadows across the ground. We sat around the fire, but the usual chatter and laughter were gone. No one wanted to say it, but we were all thinking the same thing‚Äîwe had overstayed our welcome.

As darkness settled over the forest, the tension grew unbearable. The fire crackled, sending shadows dancing across the trees, and every so often, I thought I saw something move just beyond the light. The others were quiet, shifting uncomfortably, each of us trapped in our own thoughts.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think I can sleep tonight,‚Äù Lily whispered, her voice barely audible over the crackling flames.

‚ÄúMe neither,‚Äù Sam muttered, his eyes fixed on the darkness beyond the firelight.

I felt a surge of relief, knowing I wasn‚Äôt alone in my fear. But it was a hollow comfort. Whatever was out there, it was closing in, waiting for the right moment.

Then, just as the fire began to die down, we heard it‚Äîa low, guttural growl, so close I could feel it vibrating in my chest. My heart pounded, and I saw my friends freeze, their faces pale in the dim light.

‚ÄúDid‚Ä¶ did you guys hear that?‚Äù Ben whispered, his voice trembling.

We all nodded, too afraid to speak. The growling grew louder, circling us, moving from one side of the campsite to the other. And then, out of the corner of my eye, I saw it‚Äîa shape in the darkness, just beyond the fire‚Äôs glow.

It was *me* again, but worse this time. The creature‚Äôs face was a twisted mockery of my own, its mouth stretched into a horrific grin that seemed to split its face in half. Its eyes were dark pits, empty and endless, and its limbs were too long, bending at unnatural angles.

I felt a scream rising in my throat, but I couldn‚Äôt move, couldn‚Äôt breathe. The creature stepped closer, its movements jerky, like it was trying to mimic the way I walked. It stopped just at the edge of the firelight, its empty eyes fixed on me.

‚ÄúJames?‚Äù Sam‚Äôs voice was barely a whisper, his gaze locked on the creature.

I opened my mouth to respond, but before I could speak, the creature did something that sent a chill down my spine‚Äîit *smiled*. Not a grin, not a mocking smirk, but a cold, lifeless smile, as if it were trying to comfort me. And then, in a voice that sounded like mine but twisted, distorted, it spoke.

‚ÄúCome with me.‚Äù

The words echoed through the silence, and I felt a wave of nausea wash over me. I wanted to run, to scream, to do anything to get away, but my body felt rooted to the ground.

Then, as quickly as it had appeared, the creature began to fade, dissolving into the darkness like smoke. The growling stopped, and the forest fell silent once more. My friends stared at me, their faces pale, their eyes wide with terror.

‚ÄúWhat‚Ä¶ what was that?‚Äù Lily whispered, her voice trembling.

I shook my head, unable to find the words. How could I explain that I‚Äôd been staring at myself? That something had taken my face, my voice, and used them to try and lure me into the darkness?

We spent the rest of the night huddled around the fire, too afraid to sleep, too afraid to move. Every sound, every shadow sent a fresh wave of fear through us, and by the time the first rays of sunlight pierced the trees, we were exhausted, shaken to the core.

We packed up in silence, no one daring to speak of what we‚Äôd seen. As we made our way out of the forest, I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that we were being watched, that the creature was still out there, waiting for us to return.

As we finally reached the edge of the forest and stepped into the safety of the open road, I glanced back one last time. And there, just beyond the trees, I saw it‚Äîa figure standing in the shadows, watching me. It was my own face staring back at me, that twisted, lifeless smile etched across its lips.

I turned away, my heart pounding, and we hurried back to the car. But as we drove away, I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that I‚Äôd left a part of myself in those woods. And deep down, I knew that no matter how far I went, no matter how hard I tried to forget, it would always be there, lurking in the shadows, waiting.

Waiting for me to come back...

1gjbm44,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1gjbm44/friendship_aitah/,Friendship AITAH,"Sorry for the length just thought you would need some context.

Friends for about 2 yrs. Month ago had family member  evacuate to my house during recent Florida hurricane. Around same time I was dealing with some BS regarding my house which atty is involved. Had trip planned to Universal Studios for Halloween. Not my jam but agreed to go as friend really wanted to go. Family member  was at my house for 9 days. I‚Äôm old school, believe in paying attention to house guest and yes I did minimize but not cut off texting with friend at this time. Was in a class setting when friend brings Universal trip asking if I told everyone and was I excited. I was distracted (was teaching a class) and responded with no I‚Äôm distracted and hoping I just remember to grab 1/2 and 1/2 for coffee in the morning. Yes I was distracted and honestly not thinking about universal. Next day family member leaves and I receive this rude text from friend telling me I‚Äôm an asshole and the friendship is over. She‚Äôs sick of hearing about my house problems and the fact I was not excited about universal trip she‚Äôs done with me. Whoa what? I said I‚Äôve had a family member staying with me for 9 days and sorry I was not talking about universal but I‚Äôm distracted. Well I‚Äôm uninviting you to universal. I had not talked to her about recent house issues so no clue where that came from. She backed down but was cold to me for about week. (we did go to universal)

Fast forward to this weekend. Late last week I get dreaded HOA letter with violations about landscaping at my house. I have 5 days to get it fixed or face fines. I briefly mention to friend HOA sent me notice I have to get all this crap done. (Learned I‚Äôm not allowed to talk about my house so I didn‚Äôt go into detail about it) worked on house Friday afternoon. I kick into high gear early Sat morning. I realize early on I have nail appt later in day I need to reschedule. No point in doing nails as I‚Äôve got couple days of garden stuff to get done.I typically go same time as friend. I reach out to nail salon and say hey I‚Äôm going to need to reschedule. Son shows up at house, I‚Äôm asking him to help me, he goes off to get mulch. I keep going. He‚Äôs back and I‚Äôm still going on garden work.

I have a lot to still do. Nail appt time rolls around and I get text from friend where are you. I said I had to reschedule dealing with house stuff. I need to get HOA off my back. Well boy was I in for a shock. 1st I was told how rude I was for not texting her. Then I was told friendship is over again, she‚Äôs not putting up with me. Then goes on about how much of AH I am because I could text nail salon but not her( yes timing was just as I said son showed up as I was sending text) then she kept it going. She just said some really stupid crap about me and what a loser I am and she‚Äôs going to do this and that and say shit about me. She‚Äôs knows from another friend I lied to her about not including her in an invite to a wedding shower(she was never invited) and it just would not stop. (That‚Äôs just a stupid excuse she doesn‚Äôt even know the couple getting married) We had a trip planned next year, now she‚Äôs not going and I can go F myself. Ok, I‚Äôm done. This seems a bit of a strong reaction to not texting her I can‚Äôt make a nail appt. I blocked her on phone. It was a long day and I‚Äôm over it.

2nd time she didn‚Äôt like something with me and she immediately says friendship is over. Instantly over no hey you hurt my feelings just a right to you‚Äôre an AH and I‚Äôm not your friend anymore with just rude childish texts after the statement. 

What I haven‚Äôt said is, she likes to have a few drinks every night and get buzzed. I‚Äôve noticed she changes when this happens. We did Universal trip and the morning of she was drinking starting at 11 am and continued the whole day. I didn‚Äôt say anything. I don‚Äôt drink or smoke weed. She does both. Both times she‚Äôs come down on me she‚Äôs been drinking and smoking weed. Yes I know this for a fact. 

AITA? I did not intentionally not text her I was rescheduling nail appt. It was an honest mistake. I know this was selfish of me to not think of her, but feel the threats of we‚Äôre not friends anymore for the 2nd time is ridiculous. Btw we‚Äôre not youngsters here. Mid 50‚Äôs. I really feel like I don‚Äôt know how to be friends anymore? Yes I do get distracted at times and she knows this and knows why. I‚Äôm not looking to justify my behavior but understand why I‚Äôm such a bad friend and AITAH.

Edit add

Week between universal and wedding shower 2 things happened. My low back got pissy and I was having terrible spasms. Friend had party planned which I knew I better show up to or I would face her wrath. I was in tremendous pain, could barely stand but went to party. Stayed for couple hours. The wedding shower event. We have mutual friend. I introduced her to this friend. I have known other friend for 8 yrs, attended holidays with her and her family, went to engagement party etc. mutual friend did say hey if you wanted to bring other friend invite her.  When 1st blow up happened said friend also make big deal about how she didnt know anything about the wedding shower and she wasn‚Äôt going to that either. I said what‚Äôs to know it‚Äôs a wedding shower, you know as much as I do it‚Äôs for her daughter. So I‚Äôm Not sure why she made a big deal about it back then but I got  the impression it wasn‚Äôt a big deal for her to go or not go. She did not know couple getting married (other friends daughter) friend did not attend engagement party either. Well I‚Äôm not feeling this party either because of back pain and the fact it‚Äôs an hour ride to get there but I need to go. I was going to make the appearance, stay for an hour then leave. Trust me it was a brutal ride there and I could barely stand once I got there. I thought other casual tag along invite but I just dont have patience for other friend right now I‚Äôm in too much pain and she wasn‚Äôt invited anyways and she made a big deal about it when she got pissed at me last time. I didn‚Äôt see this as rude as she wasn‚Äôt invited to begin with. Yes I was thinking about me then and the pain I was in. I was in fence if I should text her as I thought she‚Äôd say we‚Äôre not friends again. Tbh I. Kinda afraid of doing everything g wrong around her after 1st bow up.

Edit add #2

Yes she was drinking when she was at nail salon. She always brings her extra large Stanley with her ‚Äúadult beverage‚Äù she‚Äôs done this every time she‚Äôs gotten her nails done ",8,1730718119.0,AITAH,16,1.0,False

[1 Hour Camping With Cryptids Horror Story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CciTcNb44Q0)

Me and my two friends went on a 3-day camping trip last year, i saw something that I wasn‚Äôt supposed to see, and I‚Äôm not ready to go back there. You don‚Äôt have to believe me, but I just need someone to hear my story so I can finally put this thing behind me. Here‚Äôs my story

**Day 1**

The first day of our camping trip was everything I‚Äôd hoped for: long hikes, laughter echoing between the trees, and that fresh smell of pine that reminded me why we were out here, away from everything. Sam, Ben, and Lily were my best friends, and we‚Äôd been talking about this trip for months. Three days in the woods, just us, away from work, responsibilities, screens. It was perfect.

We‚Äôd chosen a spot deep within Pine Ridge, miles from any town. We‚Äôd seen maybe two other campers that day, but by evening it was just us, and the forest had gone dead silent.

We set up camp near a clearing, with a thick wall of trees behind us and the fire casting a circle of light that felt safe, almost cozy, if you ignored how dark it was outside its glow. As the night crept in, the air grew colder and sharper, and I could feel a tension I couldn‚Äôt quite place. At first, I chalked it up to excitement and maybe a bit of caffeine from the coffee I‚Äôd made right before we started hiking.

Lily was the first to break the quiet. ‚ÄúHey, who‚Äôs got a good ghost story?‚Äù She grinned, eyes catching the light, looking around at the rest of us, daring us to break the peace.

‚ÄúOh, I‚Äôve got one,‚Äù Ben said, rubbing his hands together like some villain in an old movie. ‚ÄúYou all know about the Pine Ridge Witch, right?‚Äù

The rest of us chuckled, but I noticed how Ben‚Äôs eyes had gone wide, almost theatrically so, as he leaned closer to the fire. ‚ÄúThey say she lives deep in these woods. That if you walk alone at night, you might see her pale face in the shadows, watching you. And if you‚Äôre unlucky, she‚Äôll follow you back to camp. She‚Äôs been around since the first settlers, they say, bound to the woods by some old curse.‚Äù

‚ÄúBen, that‚Äôs ridiculous.‚Äù Sam threw a twig into the fire, and it snapped with a spark, casting strange shapes onto the trunks around us. But there was something in Ben‚Äôs voice, a kind of tremor, like he almost believed his own tale.

We laughed it off and settled into a comfortable silence, each of us sipping our drinks and watching the fire crackle. That‚Äôs when I heard it.

A faint rustling in the underbrush, maybe fifteen feet behind me. I turned, expecting to see a rabbit or maybe a fox, but the darkness swallowed everything past the firelight. The noise stopped, but the silence that followed was even worse. It felt‚Ä¶ wrong, like something was watching us. My skin prickled, and I felt the need to break the quiet.

‚ÄúYou guys hear that?‚Äù

They all stopped, listening, but after a beat, Sam shrugged. ‚ÄúProbably just an animal. Nothing out here except squirrels and raccoons, maybe a deer if we‚Äôre lucky.‚Äù

He tried to laugh, but it came out forced. I could tell he was unnerved too.

But then it happened again, louder this time, like someone‚Äîor something‚Äîwas moving, a deliberate step in the leaves. I gripped my flashlight, sweeping it over the trees. ‚ÄúMaybe I should check it out?‚Äù

Sam gave me a look. ‚ÄúOr, maybe you shouldn‚Äôt.‚Äù

The thought had just formed when I saw it‚Äîa shape in the darkness, still and silent, but unmistakable. It was‚Ä¶ me. Standing just outside the fire‚Äôs light, partially hidden by the trees.

For a second, I thought I was seeing my own reflection, a trick of the fire and shadows. But the face‚Äîit was too pale, too motionless. My stomach dropped, and the light shook in my hand as I stared, transfixed.

‚ÄúJames, what‚Äôs up?‚Äù Ben called out, but his voice was faint, far away. I couldn‚Äôt look away from the figure, from‚Ä¶ myself.

I took a step back, my foot crunching in the leaves, and just like that, it was gone. No sound, no movement, just vanished.

Ben and Sam didn‚Äôt believe me, and it annoyed me, they knew i wasn‚Äôt the type to joke about this stuff.

Never the less we had to go to bed, i just wasn‚Äôt sure if i was seeing things or if this thing was real. I really just wanted Ben and Sam to believe me so we could go home.

¬†

**DAY 2**

¬†

I woke up on the second day of our camping trip with a splitting headache. The kind that feels like something heavy is pressing down on your skull. I rubbed my temples, trying to shake off the feeling, but that strange tension from last night lingered, prickling at the edges of my awareness. Maybe it was the poor sleep or Ben‚Äôs ghost story, but I felt like I hadn‚Äôt fully woken up.

The others were already up, huddled around the fire and talking in low voices. Lily looked up as I shuffled over, her face lighting up in that reassuring way of hers. ‚ÄúMorning, James! You okay?‚Äù

I gave a quick nod, brushing off my unease. ‚ÄúYeah, just‚Ä¶ didn‚Äôt sleep well.‚Äù

Ben shot me a grin. ‚ÄúYou freaked yourself out with that ghost story, huh?‚Äù He nudged Sam, who snickered.

I wanted to laugh along, but my mind kept flashing back to the figure I‚Äôd seen‚Äîor thought I‚Äôd seen‚Äîin the shadows. I could still picture its face, exactly like mine but somehow wrong. The skin had been too smooth, stretched like wax over the bones, and the eyes‚Ä¶ they‚Äôd looked right at me, without blinking.

‚ÄúHey, you with us, man?‚Äù Sam was looking at me, his head tilted slightly.

‚ÄúYeah, yeah.‚Äù I forced a smile, kicking myself for letting it get to me. I was probably just overtired or‚Ä¶ something. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs hit the trail.‚Äù

The plan for the day was to hike deeper into the woods and explore some of the rougher paths. I was determined to shake off whatever fog I was in. There was nothing out here, I told myself. Just trees and shadows and my overactive imagination. We‚Äôd come here to escape, to get away from work and the city, and I wasn‚Äôt about to let my own head ruin it.

But as we trekked through the dense underbrush, something felt‚Ä¶ off. I couldn‚Äôt put my finger on it. Everything seemed normal at first‚Äîthe trees towering above, the sunlight breaking through the branches, dappling the forest floor. The scent of pine was fresh and crisp. But the deeper we went, the more I felt like we weren‚Äôt alone.

It wasn‚Äôt just a feeling this time; there were signs. Strange signs. At one point, we came across a line of footprints, barely visible in the packed earth. They weren‚Äôt animal tracks, either. They looked almost human, but the shape was wrong‚Äîtoo narrow, the toes too elongated, like whoever had left them wasn‚Äôt quite‚Ä¶ human.

‚ÄúCheck this out,‚Äù I called, kneeling down by the tracks.

Ben leaned over my shoulder. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs probably just from another camper. Some people come out here barefoot, right?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, maybe.‚Äù I tried to sound casual, but my heart was thudding in my chest. The tracks looked fresh, almost as if they‚Äôd been made minutes before we arrived. And as we continued, I noticed more of them‚Äîalways close to our path, always just a little too recent.

We reached a clearing around noon, and everyone was ready for a break. Lily spread out a blanket, and we all collapsed around it, passing around snacks and water bottles. I tried to shake off the creeping unease, telling myself it was just a trick of my mind.

As I sat there, though, a strange feeling washed over me‚Äîa prickling at the back of my neck, like eyes boring into me. I looked around the clearing, scanning the trees, but I couldn‚Äôt see anything out of the ordinary. Still, I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling.

‚ÄúYou sure you‚Äôre okay, James?‚Äù Lily asked, looking at me with a raised brow.

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I muttered, not wanting to make a big deal of it. But I wasn‚Äôt convincing anyone. My friends exchanged glances, the kind you exchange when you‚Äôre not sure if someone is joking or genuinely losing it.

The rest of the day passed in a haze of forced conversations and strained laughter. My friends tried to cheer me up, making jokes and taking pictures of the scenery, but every time we stopped, I felt that same heavy weight pressing down on me, like a dark cloud I couldn‚Äôt escape. And whenever I glanced over my shoulder, I could have sworn I saw something moving between the trees‚Äîa flicker of a shape that disappeared whenever I tried to focus on it.

As dusk settled in, we made our way back to the campsite. The air had grown colder, and the trees seemed darker than they had that morning, their branches like bony fingers reaching down from the sky. We built up the fire quickly, everyone eager to banish the chill and huddle close to its warmth. The night was already settling in, and it seemed thicker, more oppressive than the night before.

By the time we finished dinner, I was exhausted, but sleep was the last thing on my mind. My friends drifted into easy conversation, but I could only listen half-heartedly, glancing out into the woods, scanning for any sign of movement. Every snap of a twig, every rustle of leaves, had me on edge.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre acting weird, man,‚Äù Ben finally said, nudging me. ‚ÄúYou really do think you saw something last night, don‚Äôt you?‚Äù

I opened my mouth to deny it, to laugh it off, but the words caught in my throat. I wanted to tell him, to explain what I‚Äôd seen, but I knew they wouldn‚Äôt understand. And truth be told, I didn‚Äôt really understand it myself.

‚ÄúIt was probably nothing,‚Äù I managed, forcing a grin. But the words felt empty, hollow.

The fire crackled, sending sparks dancing into the night, and for a brief moment, I felt a little more at ease. But then, just as quickly as it had come, the peace was shattered by a sound‚Äîa low, guttural growl, coming from somewhere just beyond the firelight.

Every head whipped around, eyes wide as we listened, straining to hear. The sound came again, closer this time, sending a chill down my spine.

‚ÄúDid‚Ä¶ did you guys hear that?‚Äù Lily whispered, her voice barely audible.

We all nodded, frozen in place. The growling grew louder, more insistent, and then we heard it‚Äîthe unmistakable sound of footsteps, heavy and deliberate, circling our campsite. My stomach twisted, and I gripped the flashlight, my fingers slick with sweat.

I turned it on and aimed it into the trees. The light cut through the darkness, illuminating the trunks and branches, but there was nothing there. Just shadows and silence.

‚ÄúJames, don‚Äôt,‚Äù Sam whispered, grabbing my arm. But I shrugged him off, stepping closer to the edge of the firelight.

And then I saw it.

A shape, barely visible between the trees, lurking in the shadows. It was just like last night‚Äîonly this time, it was more solid, more real. The figure stood there, watching me, its face just visible in the dim light. My heart stopped as I realized it was‚Ä¶ me, once again.

Only this time, the resemblance was even more disturbing. The figure‚Äôs eyes were hollow, empty black pits, and its mouth was twisted into a horrible grin, too wide, stretching across its face in a grotesque parody of my own expression.

I staggered back, my breath coming in shallow gasps. ‚ÄúGuys‚Ä¶ do you see that?‚Äù

They followed my gaze, but their faces remained blank, confused. ‚ÄúSee what, James?‚Äù Ben asked, a hint of irritation creeping into his voice.

The figure took a step closer, its movements jerky and unnatural, like a puppet on strings. I felt paralyzed, trapped between the creature and my friends‚Äô skeptical stares.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs right there!‚Äù I insisted, my voice rising in desperation. But when I looked back, the figure was gone, vanished into the shadows as if it had never been there.

My friends exchanged worried glances. ‚ÄúMaybe you need to lie down,‚Äù Sam suggested, his voice tight with concern.

I opened my mouth to argue, but I knew it was useless. They didn‚Äôt see it. They couldn‚Äôt see it.

As I lay in my tent that night, staring up at the dark canvas, I felt a creeping certainty settle over me. Whatever I‚Äôd seen, whatever was out there in the woods‚Ä¶ it was watching me. And it wasn‚Äôt done.

¬†

**Day 3**

¬†

I barely slept that second night. Every sound outside my tent jolted me awake, and every time I closed my eyes, I saw that‚Ä¶ *thing* staring back at me with my own face, twisted and wrong. By the time dawn finally broke, I was exhausted, strung out, my mind running in a thousand directions. I kept telling myself it was all in my head, that I was letting Ben‚Äôs ghost stories and the shadows play tricks on me. But deep down, I knew better.

I crawled out of my tent, blinking at the sunlight that pierced the trees. The others were already awake, sipping coffee and packing up the gear we‚Äôd scattered the night before. They looked up when I approached, and I could tell by their faces that I looked as terrible as I felt.

‚ÄúRough night?‚Äù Sam asked, trying to keep his tone light.

I nodded, not trusting myself to say anything. How could I explain what I‚Äôd seen? That I‚Äôd looked into the eyes of something wearing my face like a mask? That I felt like I was being hunted? They wouldn‚Äôt believe me. I wasn‚Äôt even sure I believed myself.

‚ÄúLook, man,‚Äù Ben said, clapping a hand on my shoulder, ‚Äúwe‚Äôre gonna have a good day today. Forget whatever freaked you out last night. We‚Äôre here to have fun, right?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I muttered, forcing a smile. But as I looked out into the forest, I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that something was watching us. I could almost feel its gaze, cold and heavy, pressing down on me.

We spent the day wandering further into the woods, but every step felt like a descent into darkness. The trees grew thicker, taller, closing in around us like a living wall. The air felt denser, colder, as if the forest itself were suffocating us. The others laughed, took photos, chatted, but their voices sounded distant, muffled, as though I were hearing them from the bottom of a well.

Around noon, we came across another strange sight‚Äîa pile of stones stacked in the middle of the trail. It looked like a cairn, but something about it felt‚Ä¶ wrong. The rocks were smeared with a dark, sticky substance that looked suspiciously like blood. I stopped, my skin prickling.

‚ÄúWhat‚Ä¶ is that?‚Äù Lily asked, her voice barely a whisper.

Ben laughed nervously. ‚ÄúProbably just a prank. Some other campers messing with us.‚Äù

But as I stared at the stones, a cold dread settled over me. This wasn‚Äôt a prank. It was a warning.

We skirted around the pile and kept walking, but the feeling of being watched grew stronger with every step. The forest was completely silent now, no birds, no rustling leaves, nothing. Just an oppressive, all-encompassing quiet that set my nerves on edge.

The others tried to laugh it off, to ignore the strange occurrences, but I could see the fear creeping into their eyes. We were all on edge, and I knew they could feel it too. We weren‚Äôt welcome here. We needed to leave.

When we finally made it back to camp, the sun was beginning to set. The sky turned a deep, angry red, casting long shadows across the ground. We sat around the fire, but the usual chatter and laughter were gone. No one wanted to say it, but we were all thinking the same thing‚Äîwe had overstayed our welcome.

As darkness settled over the forest, the tension grew unbearable. The fire crackled, sending shadows dancing across the trees, and every so often, I thought I saw something move just beyond the light. The others were quiet, shifting uncomfortably, each of us trapped in our own thoughts.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think I can sleep tonight,‚Äù Lily whispered, her voice barely audible over the crackling flames.

‚ÄúMe neither,‚Äù Sam muttered, his eyes fixed on the darkness beyond the firelight.

I felt a surge of relief, knowing I wasn‚Äôt alone in my fear. But it was a hollow comfort. Whatever was out there, it was closing in, waiting for the right moment.

Then, just as the fire began to die down, we heard it‚Äîa low, guttural growl, so close I could feel it vibrating in my chest. My heart pounded, and I saw my friends freeze, their faces pale in the dim light.

‚ÄúDid‚Ä¶ did you guys hear that?‚Äù Ben whispered, his voice trembling.

We all nodded, too afraid to speak. The growling grew louder, circling us, moving from one side of the campsite to the other. And then, out of the corner of my eye, I saw it‚Äîa shape in the darkness, just beyond the fire‚Äôs glow.

It was *me* again, but worse this time. The creature‚Äôs face was a twisted mockery of my own, its mouth stretched into a horrific grin that seemed to split its face in half. Its eyes were dark pits, empty and endless, and its limbs were too long, bending at unnatural angles.

I felt a scream rising in my throat, but I couldn‚Äôt move, couldn‚Äôt breathe. The creature stepped closer, its movements jerky, like it was trying to mimic the way I walked. It stopped just at the edge of the firelight, its empty eyes fixed on me.

‚ÄúJames?‚Äù Sam‚Äôs voice was barely a whisper, his gaze locked on the creature.

I opened my mouth to respond, but before I could speak, the creature did something that sent a chill down my spine‚Äîit *smiled*. Not a grin, not a mocking smirk, but a cold, lifeless smile, as if it were trying to comfort me. And then, in a voice that sounded like mine but twisted, distorted, it spoke.

‚ÄúCome with me.‚Äù

The words echoed through the silence, and I felt a wave of nausea wash over me. I wanted to run, to scream, to do anything to get away, but my body felt rooted to the ground.

Then, as quickly as it had appeared, the creature began to fade, dissolving into the darkness like smoke. The growling stopped, and the forest fell silent once more. My friends stared at me, their faces pale, their eyes wide with terror.

‚ÄúWhat‚Ä¶ what was that?‚Äù Lily whispered, her voice trembling.

I shook my head, unable to find the words. How could I explain that I‚Äôd been staring at myself? That something had taken my face, my voice, and used them to try and lure me into the darkness?

We spent the rest of the night huddled around the fire, too afraid to sleep, too afraid to move. Every sound, every shadow sent a fresh wave of fear through us, and by the time the first rays of sunlight pierced the trees, we were exhausted, shaken to the core.

We packed up in silence, no one daring to speak of what we‚Äôd seen. As we made our way out of the forest, I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that we were being watched, that the creature was still out there, waiting for us to return.

As we finally reached the edge of the forest and stepped into the safety of the open road, I glanced back one last time. And there, just beyond the trees, I saw it‚Äîa figure standing in the shadows, watching me. It was my own face staring back at me, that twisted, lifeless smile etched across its lips.

I turned away, my heart pounding, and we hurried back to the car. But as we drove away, I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that I‚Äôd left a part of myself in those woods. And deep down, I knew that no matter how far I went, no matter how hard I tried to forget, it would always be there, lurking in the shadows, waiting.

Waiting for me to come back...

In all these situations if I was in a strong position to quit job in 2010, I would not have got bullied in 2021 and developed PTSD.

I don‚Äôt want to misread her actions as her wanting me back or something but I am definitely standing my ground and sticking to my stance. Do I unblock her phone number and ask her to meet over coffee to discuss whatever is still on her mind? ",2,1730717675.0,theotherwoman,1,1.0,False
1gjbi3h,https://www.reddit.com/r/cults/comments/1gjbi3h/has_anyone_successfully_talked_a_family_member/,Has anyone successfully talked a family member out of a cult?,"I'm curious if anyone out there really has an experience of helping someone open their eyes. When I look up online I always see the same advices :
- people who don't want to open their eyes never will.
- the only person who can help is themselves.
- Being too direct only reinforce cult beliefs
- The only thing you can realisticaly do is to not enable them but to be ready to help if they want to get out. 

That's the theory and that works when you don't have to engage daily with the person but in my case this is my mother in law. None of her 3 children shares her beliefs. She seems to be inclined to jump from cult to cult  she tried them all (JW, new ages angels/rebirth/shamanism, extreme veganism, meditation etc) she's sometimes so extreme she gets kicks out of cults because she questions autority and states that everyone should be vegan and eat raw food, never complain, never curse, never drink coffee, yada yada.

 I don't see my partner or his siblings ever cutting contact with her and I can't blame them, they're worried she might die any day of health problem. They don't agree with her and never encourage her, but they don't want to lose her. Family dinners are truly hell and end in tears almost every time.

1gjbd3b,https://www.reddit.com/r/AeroPress/comments/1gjbd3b/stirring_is_not_only_agitation/,Stirring is not only agitation,"It also brings down the brew temperature, like significantly.

Recently I 've been messing around with recipes with very fine grind settings (espresso-fine) and pretty long steep time (4~6 mins). In theory, doing so will produce over-extracted (and by that people actually mean astringent?) coffee but I decided to stir the hell out of these brews anyway to increase the extraction yield even more. 

The brews turned out to be pretty tasty. They were full-bodied. They were sweet. So higher extraction yield dosen't always mean bad coffee? But I want to make the coffee even sweeter by cranking up the extraction yield even higher. With the assumption that **vigorous stirring brings down brew temperature a lot** in mind, I did an experiment:

1. Use very fine grounds (~18g) as usual.
2. Add boiling water (~100ml) as usual, the slurry temp is ~92 ¬∞C.
3. Stir vigorously as usual, now the slurry temp drops to ~80 ¬∞C. That's a drastic drop.
4. Add more boiling water (~130ml) to bring up the temperature again. The slurry temp is ~95 ¬∞C now. Hooray!
5. Wait for 4 mins and plunge, taste the coffee.

Now it tastes like shit.

That unpleasant flavor we call over-extration is very noticable here. The coffee is so harsh that I feel like my throat is burning. I pour the coffee into the sink and think to myself: what's happening here? Is it...

A: Since vigorous stirring brings down brew temperature a lot, I wasn't acutally making coffee with very high extration yield before, so of course the coffee tastes fine and bringing up brew temperature will ruin it.

B: **Strategies to boost extration yield actually have very different effects**. Maybe the extration process of astringent compounds in coffee is much more sensitive to brew temperature than to grind size and steep time.

What's your experience with strring and brew temperatue? I 've drunk 4 cups of coffee today and can't do anymore experiment for now. Please share your thoughts on this.",5,1730717050.0,AeroPress,5,0.86,False

To all the colours you brought into our view.

&nbsp;

Your strength, a calm, steady kind of power,

The rock I leaned on, hour by hour.

&nbsp;



There‚Äôs this spark in you, so playful and free,

The way you‚Äôd laugh brought the best out of me.

&nbsp;



I miss those goofy days, those jokes we‚Äôd share,

How we‚Äôd turn the everyday into something rare.

&nbsp;


I think about those mornings, easy and slow,

Coffee, toast, whatever was in flow.

&nbsp;


And yeah, you were right about the wooden bowl,

Somehow, they make every flavour feel whole.

&nbsp;


Your mind, sharp and quick, was something to see,

Picking apart every thought with ease.

&nbsp;


You‚Äôd share ideas with that smart, clever grin,

Making even small things feel like a win.

&nbsp;


Your passion, alive, intense, and pure,

Made every moment feel just so secure.

&nbsp;


I remember us making mulled wine by the stove,

Pouring warmth into winter, sip by sip, clove by clove.

&nbsp;


And then there‚Äôs your loyalty, solid and true,

A safe place I knew I could always run to.

&nbsp;


You were truly my anchor, my steady ground,

In a world that‚Äôs always spinning around.

&nbsp;


I miss the simple things, just hanging with you,

Laughing about nothing, our inside jokes, too.

&nbsp;


Being silly together, our vibrations high,

Our energy blending like stars in the sky.

&nbsp;


The taste of your lips as my fingertips trace,

Across your perfect, soft cheeks, our little space.

You were my joy, my peace, my endless fight,

The one whose love kept my soul‚Äôs light bright.",2,1730716866.0,Poems,0,1.0,False

and cancelled plans

late night conversations,

and that 2 am nervous dance,

\-

if it were up to me,

I would ask you

About the way you were to me

When we spoke late,

Like strangers after a lukewarm date,

like everything second rate,

.  
Like I didn‚Äôt matter to you

as much as you said I did to you,

with  flood in your eyes

and breath in your soul

.  
Like I was just another,

among the many other,

who met,

.  
touched,

fucked,

and left

\-

Tell me,

you who are no longer mine,

did you show them your stash,

of notes that you thought were too embarrassing

to be seen by another pair of eyes,

tell me, did they kiss you then,

and tell you with eyes without judgement, that embarrassment is not shame?

that expression is not just for seeking fame?

.  
did they see that little scar on your left calf,

did they kiss it, too, like I did that day

when you couldn't find your self worth tucked in a place

where you always kept it for a rainy day?

.

did they catch the small curve of lips you make,

and the little droplets that form just above your furrowed brows,

when you are exhausted,

when you don't like a place.

or a person,

and just want to go home

and curl in bed  with a good movie and a great cup of coffee for eternity, maybe even an ice cream or two,

did they too, clutch your hand and pull you from it all,

without caring about either the place or the people in the hall,

and put you in the car, and drive 18 miles back to your home,

with their hand on your forehead,

kissing your fingers all the way,

and wrap you in the bed with your movie and your cup, and your ice cream

and sleep beside you without a word, like I did?

Did they?

\-

Or have I been misled,

Tell me, before my conviction is dead,

have I been getting too ahead,

in thoughts of what you thought of me?

.

Tell me,

history mine,

did they see you for who you are

Did they raise the bumps of your skin with the tip of their fingers,

Did they send you in sweet daze with the smell of love that lingers,

did they really make love to your body, your whole body, and make it sing,

did they truly speak to your soul, did they give it wings?

Did they make you feel what it means to be alive in your bones,

to be made love to your  tenderness, not just your callous zones,

Did they look, unblinking, at what you think are your imperfections

as if those were the last thing they ever longed for?

\-

if it were up to me,

I would ask you

Tell me,

bygone love,

did anyone ever make your whole being starve,

to be touched the way I touched you?

to be kissed the way I kissed you?

or to be made love to?

.

If it were up to me,

I would ask you

Was it that easy,

switching me off?

.

Was it your own decision,

or someone else‚Äôs revision,

of what you actually wanted to do, or say, or be

or were you just honouring

my decision all along,

of what I said in pain,

of never speaking again?

\-

If it were up to me,

I would set myself free

from you

and your memory

and the twenty six days we

stopped the universe for,

to live a lifetime,

every single day

.

if it were up to me,

I would, trust me I would, forget you‚Ä¶

not think of you,

not look at your traces,

still lurking in my messages,

and my delete folders with thirty days restoration periods, 

and the cryptic public comments we left for each other on our shared songs,

that we now ruined for each other

.

If it were up to me,

I would, oh I swear I would...

not let you be the tornado to the leaf that is me

.

If it were up to me,

I would shut you down,

do you really think it is anyone's own choice,

that we... *like,* to drown?

If it were up to me,

I would knife the part of my soul where it says your name in bold letters without my permission

\-

But you know that it isn‚Äôt,

that it isn‚Äôt up to me,

it isn't,

I can't,

not anymore

you know that,



don‚Äôt you?

We‚Äôre literally sat in the airport waiting for our flight back home and I figured I‚Äôd give our wrap up to help anyone else looking to travel to Troms√∏.

We had a great experience. We got 4 very snowy days (which we loved) but that can also be limiting for some activities or wanting to see the northern lights. We went into our trip thinking they‚Äôd be fun to see but that it wasn‚Äôt really in our control if we did or didn‚Äôt. We opted to do the cable car and Telegrafbuka instead of a northern lights chaser tour. 

As for tours, we did the free walking tour that leaves at the cathedral at 10am and found it really interesting but also a great way to get oriented with the city. We also booked reindeer feeding at Tromso Arctic Reindeer and it really was a highlight of the trip. As an fyi, if you book at the tourist centre, there‚Äôs a 65KR service charge. It wasn‚Äôt a big deal to us but it could be for others. 

We also ventured out to the ice rink to see the local team play and had a lot of fun with that as well.

In terms of food and drink, we had a bit of a hit and miss. We really enjoyed Openhall for their beer taps but it is a bit pricey. Fint for a bite of breakfast and coffee. Havi for sushi was a huge highlight and their 30 piece meal for 2 was super reasonably priced. And we got a kick out of Bastard and Misfit Tiki Bar for some cocktails. And then obviously Raketten for a hot dog.

Getting around is dead easy. We stayed at the Moxy and the 28 bus picked up and dropped off right outside. We kind of foolishly bought the airport bus return ticket, had we known how easy the city transit was, we would‚Äôve done that from the jump.

On a whole, we had a great time and I hope you have a blast too üòÅ stay warm and dry!",9,1730716278.0,tromsotravel,4,1.0,False

Firstly, they actually wore gloves during most of the preparation stage so #babysteps. For real though, the cleanliness was still incredibly lacking but yanno. Secondly they used sausage and even said something to the effect that we're not getting into that ... And I chuckled. 

Anyhow, at one point they said that they have one more relapse before it's just active addiction. Then went on to clarify that they've used 3x in the past 10 days (even though I could have sworn that like three days ago they had like 9) and if the use one more time it's full blown active. Now, excuse me if I'm wrong, but that's fuckin crazy, right? I grew up in AA as the kid in a corner with a book while the old dudes smoked and drank shitty coffee, and have been in and out of the rooms in my own right for decades now and I've never heard such bullshit.

Let's say that someone has a period of sobriety and uses, right? That there is the relapse. The relapse continues until there is another period of sobriety with commitment and work being done to maintain that sobriety. If I were to use today and not again until Friday, that's still the same relapse!! Each individual day doesn't constitute a relapse.

Idk, I feel like I'm not making sense lol. Just their logic is quite comical. Like, ""If I use just one more time, then I'm gon be in active addiction. So I've got to rein it in quick.""

","Maintaining mental clarity is essential for productivity and overall well-being. By integrating physical exercises, mindful techniques, and brain-supporting supplements, you can enhance cognitive function and sustain focus. This article explores ways to support mental clarity through simple lifestyle practices and introduces the benefits of NEURIVA Plus, a clinically tested brain supplement designed to boost memory and focus.

**Exercises to Enhance Cognitive Health**

Incorporating specific exercises into your daily routine can greatly support cognitive health. Neck exercises, for instance, are effective for alleviating tension and improving blood circulation to the brain. Reducing stiffness in the neck and shoulders enables better blood flow, which promotes mental clarity. Similarly, breathing exercises that focus on slow, deep breaths can relax the mind, increase lung capacity, and improve oxygen delivery to the brain, which enhances cognitive performance. Another beneficial activity is the ""Snowflake Exercise,"" which promotes eye health, strengthens the nervous system, and improves concentration. These exercises offer a holistic way to boost both physical and mental well-being.

[Experience improved brain performance and unlock your full potential. Enhance your memory and focus with our clinically tested brain supplement. Formulated with coffee cherry Neurofactor, plant-sourced phosphatidylserine, and B vitamins for optimal brain health.](https://preview.redd.it/mfdyfw4s1vyd1.png?width=970&format=png&auto=webp&s=86f36d99818d95e774a6ed1f7436c873d6814fca)

**Behavioral Practices for Mental Clarity**

Practical strategies such as limiting screen time and practicing cognitive-behavioral techniques can make a noticeable difference in mental clarity. Reducing the amount of time spent on social media and minimizing exposure to distressing news can lower stress levels and prevent information overload. Aiming to limit news consumption to 10‚Äì15 minutes a day can help you stay informed without absorbing too much negativity. Additionally, practicing behavioral techniques to manage emotional responses to stress can improve mental resilience. Over time, these practices can enhance your ability to regulate negative emotions, contributing to long-term cognitive health.

**Brain Supplements to Support Mental Clarity**

For those looking for additional cognitive support, NEURIVA Plus offers a well-rounded brain supplement aimed at enhancing memory and focus. This nootropic is formulated with key ingredients like Neurofactor, derived from whole coffee fruit extract, which is clinically tested to increase levels of Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF). BDNF is essential for brain cell connections and plays a vital role in promoting synaptogenesis, synaptic plasticity, and overall neuronal health. Alongside Neurofactor, NEURIVA Plus includes plant-sourced phosphatidylserine and essential B vitamins (B6 and B12) that support brain energy production, neurotransmitter synthesis, and mood regulation.

**High-Quality, Trustworthy Ingredients**

NEURIVA Plus stands out for its commitment to quality, using vegetarian, gluten-free, GMO-free, and decaffeinated ingredients. The supplement requires only one capsule a day, making it convenient for adults looking to support their brain health without a complicated routine. Each capsule delivers a potent blend of brain-supporting nutrients designed to fuel cognitive performance. As with all Schiff products, NEURIVA Plus is backed by a commitment to purity, freshness, and labeled potency, providing users with peace of mind regarding supplement quality.

**Track Your Progress with the NEURIVA Brain Gym App**

For those who enjoy tracking their cognitive improvement, NEURIVA also offers a Brain Gym app, available on both the App Store and Google Play. This app provides digital tools to assess and monitor your cognitive skills over time, allowing you to set and achieve mental clarity goals. Whether through exercises, mindful practices, or a trusted supplement like NEURIVA Plus, supporting mental clarity is within reach, helping you to stay sharp, focused, and resilient in everyday life.
