i know the whole shpeel people usually say:

-practice for hours
-have the financial needs
-win competitions
-make connections
-go to a conservatory

but i’ve also seen SO many comments saying that even if you do all that it’s impossible, it’s starting to make me doubt whether this is really possible. 

am i reaching too high?

I first meet Lilly when she is in year 10 and I am in year 8, it was just a passing hello, 
we never hanged out together or even had a conversation. 

TL;DR 
We knew eachother but we’re not close, 
We both have dated the same person, he did messed up things to both of us, we bond over the same messed up experience, years later she has an issues with it and brings it up and keeps taking digs at me about it, I have tired to apologise but it wasn’t good enough, what do I do ?

( My backstory) 
My older sister moved out and was safe from being abused, my mum and dad both work away during the week and are only home on the weekends, my sister and I are left to fend for our selves, I was aged 13-14 at the time. 

Around 14 this age my mother stops saying goodnight to me on the phone and she stops saying she loves me, but she would still say goodnight to my little sister. 

when I was 15 at school I leaned that I had the right to not be physically abused. 

Later on my father punches me in the face for wanting to visit my male best friend at the time William, my mum usually allows me to see him on the weekends), that lead me to leave home to find somewhere I would no longer be abused. 

I leave school, I get a job and move out, I was fired from my job for being sick, Wich is illegal but I was too young to know and kicked out by my house mate because a friend of mine decided to be destructive to my house because she was being a bad egg at the time. 

Leaving me homeless. 

I was very young, no clue how the world worked out of home, scared, no income, no support, except one (male 18) named William. 
William allowed me to live with him in exchange for sex and housework. 

William grew to be more abusive and an alcoholic,
coming from an abusive family I didn’t have the tools to make better choices. 

One night, Williams roommate had a friend over name Leroy(M 22)I was sitting outside in a depressive mess (my will to live dwindling) Leroy approached me alone and says “can I kiss you ?” And I said okay, okay but on the cheek and he said “no on the lips” and I lamented and said “okay fine”. 

Then he asked me if I wanted to try MDMA, 
I said “I haven’t ever had that before “
Leroy says “its like a happy feelings, makes you feel love” 
I said “okay” (being self destructive because of my mental health) 

Then he asks me what I’m doing that night and I said nothing (my life consisted of trying to find food and crying, at that point). 

Then Leroy invited me to his house, and I said “okay”, we went to his house. 

The night is all a blur, I remember being in a bath with baby oil in it, looking a Leroy’s filthy kitchen with fungus growing from a pan lid, his lounge room filled with mess, a pill press and Bowls of colour powders and bags of clear powder, a homemade bong ect, while I was high he kept offering me all kinds of drugs, he did bad things to my body, 3 days pass and come to my senses and remember where I am, gather the very few things I came with and leave to go back to Williams house. 

Around this time i tired and was denied centerlink because my family refused to say I didn’t live with them, and also the centerlink councillor refused to approved me saying I couldn’t prove I didn’t live with my family, having no way to prove it. 

At age 16 I had a short relationship with another man that ended badly because of me doing the wrong thing. 

Around 17 William and I have relationship, he cheats the entire time like usually, and I grow to be unfazed,(it’s my fault for dating him) 

Where Lilly come back into the story:

Lilly starts to date Leroy, and they both come over to Williams and I home, uninvited as no one really ever was it was just a place people hanged out at, because we were young, Lilly gifts me some paints and pencils, Leroy is very controlling to Lilly while she is there, we don’t talk for long, no numbers exchanged. 

A few years pass and I’m about to turn 18.
Finally Centrelink approves me and my mother perhaps feeling guilty pays for a tafe course for me to attend.

By 19 William and I have to move out of his share house because of his roommate becoming aggressive.

We move to Williams parents house they don’t allow us to live inside and instead we are either allowed to be in the laundry or in a tent outside, they have a over crowed house as is , the laundry is so small only one person can lay down at once, so we live in a tent.

Unable to get work I go back to TAFE to study year 10, that winter it drops down to the minus temperature where we live in our tent. 

Lilly is also at tafe and she shows me where she studies at tafe,I’m the arts rooms, it’s a short but sweet conversation.

One morning I woke up and William started to relatively kick me over and over again I beg him to stop but he wouldn’t, and he refused to speak also while he was doing it, I grabbed a few things and left his parents. 

I went to our weed dealers house the nearest person I knew, I stayed with him for 2 weeks, during that time he took all my money from me and spent it all on drugs for him saying he would get it back, but didn’t and I left, 

I had no where eles to go so I went to Leroy’s 
Leroy and Lilly had broken up, I was unsure of how long ago, but it felt like at least a few moths, Lilly was already dating another boyfriend, Leroy and I did drugs and went on a bender or 2, then I don’t even think he ever asked me to be his gf, we just started cohabiting, he wanted to move to QLD, I had no choice but to follow, so I did, while I was with him he started to pick at me and would shame my body all the time, I was a size 8-10 Australian in clothing already, I eventually got a eating disorder and was making my self vomit because of all the bullying he was doing to me.

One night while I was exercising on my bike, a man rides up next to me and we start chatting he tells me story’s about him taking acid with a broken leg, and I tell him my issues about my partner and my weight and he tells me that I’m not fat and don’t listen to my partner and I snapped of the delusions I was being fed. 

I eventually brake up with Leroy and move in with some hippies. 

Most of a year later I move back to my home town, got a job and rented an apartment. 

Then I eventually I get Lilly’s number (this is our first long conversation) I talk to her about the horrors of dating Leroy and she also vents to me about what she went through with him and we bond over that. 

We are friends for 10 years through the highs and the lows, brake ups with boyfriends, partying, sleep overs and cute coffee friend dates often talking for hours. 

Now 10+ years we have been friends and she has an issues with me dating Leroy in the past and she brings it up. 

At first I was kinda caught off gaurd and defensive, then I talked it out with my therapist at the time and she said I need to apologise to her to make her happy, not what I think is right, so I apologise to her because it’s her feelings and it’s my friend and I care about her, but my apology came out not perfect, because of my own ego and anxiety, but I did try my best then she kinda battered off my apology, and said I was right and that she felt like she was making a big deal out of nothing, but now she still holds it against me, 
what do I do ? 

I love my friend and I want our relationship to work. ",2,1748585328.0,relationships,0,1.0,False

Before I get started, just a heads up that I have zero coffee knowledge, and some of the things I say may not even make sense so bear with me.

So my partner is a big coffee enthusiast and I’m looking to gift her something next week. Here’s what I know:

1. She likes dark roast the most but doesn’t mind medium roast as well.
2. She already has a coffee pot at home.
3. She takes her coffee with just water, no milk.

Now, I don’t want to gift her a coffee pot/machine because she already has one. I was thinking of getting her some coffee(preferably grounded, not sure what the effort is in grinding beans). Don’t have a budget in mind, I am open to expensive suggestions as well. Also, don’t want to gift her a subscription, would prefer to give a physical gift.

Weight loss isn't magic — it's biology, behavior, and sometimes biochemistry. While lifestyle changes (diet + exercise) are still the foundation, evidence supports certain supplements (like GLP-1 agonists, caffeine, green tea extract) and behavioral tools. But every “miracle” has caveats: risks, side effects, or minimal real-world impact. This post breaks down what works, what doesn’t, and what the science *actually* says. 🧠

# 🧭 Context: How We Try to Lose Weight

Weight loss strategies span cultures and centuries: from fasting in religious traditions to herbal remedies like garcinia cambogia in Ayurveda. Today, the weight loss industry is a $200+ billion global market — yet obesity rates continue to rise. That disconnect speaks to how complex weight loss truly is.

Modern approaches include:

* **Caloric restriction** (e.g., CICO, intermittent fasting)
* **Exercise routines** (resistance training + cardio)
* **Pharmacological aids** (e.g., semaglutide, orlistat)
* **Behavioral interventions** (CBT, digital tracking, accountability)
* **Supplements** (green tea extract, fiber, berberine)

Real-world reports often mention initial success with extreme diets or over-the-counter pills — but these rarely translate into sustainable change. Long-term weight loss is less about short bursts and more about ongoing habits + metabolic adaptation.

# 🔬 The Science of Weight Loss: Not Just “Eat Less, Move More”

At its core, **weight loss requires a calorie deficit**, but the way our bodies adapt can make that deficit harder to maintain over time.

# Metabolic Adaptation

When you reduce calorie intake, your body *reduces energy expenditure* in response — this is called **adaptive thermogenesis**. A 2016 study on ""The Biggest Loser"" contestants found that many had significantly lower resting metabolic rates even 6 years after weight loss \[1\].

# Hormonal Players

* **Leptin:** Signals fullness. Drops with weight loss, increasing hunger.
* **Ghrelin:** Signals hunger. Rises during calorie restriction.
* **Insulin:** Helps regulate blood sugar and fat storage.
* **GLP-1:** Increases satiety, slows gastric emptying — target of meds like semaglutide (Ozempic, Wegovy).

# 🧠 Mechanisms: What Supplements or Interventions Actually Do

# 🌿 Green Tea Extract (EGCG + Caffeine)

* **Mechanism:** May increase fat oxidation, thermogenesis
* **Evidence:** Modest effect. A 2020 meta-analysis found green tea catechins + caffeine produced a *small but significant* weight reduction \[2\]
* **Dose:** 300–600mg/day EGCG, watch for caffeine levels
* **Risks:** Liver toxicity at high doses; avoid concentrated extracts on an empty stomach

# ☕ Caffeine

* **Mechanism:** Increases energy expenditure, enhances lipolysis
* **Evidence:** Shown to boost metabolism short-term \[3\]; real-world effects are small
* **Dose:** 100–400mg/day (limit <600mg/day)
* **Risks:** Insomnia, anxiety, heart rate changes

# 💊 Berberine

* **Mechanism:** Activates AMPK, improves insulin sensitivity
* **Evidence:** 2015 meta-analysis found significant reductions in BMI and waist circumference \[4\]
* **Dose:** 500mg 2–3x/day
* **Risks:** GI upset; may interact with meds (especially for diabetes or blood pressure)

# 🧬 GLP-1 Agonists (Semaglutide, Liraglutide)

* **Mechanism:** Mimic GLP-1 to reduce appetite, increase satiety
* **Evidence:** Multiple RCTs show 10–15% body weight loss over 68 weeks \[5\]
* **Regulatory Status:** FDA-approved (e.g., Wegovy)
* **Risks:** Nausea, pancreatitis, gallstones, thyroid tumor risk (in animals)

>

# ⚠️ Risks, Side Effects, and Red Flags

|Intervention|Common Side Effects|Long-Term Concerns|Regulatory Status|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Green Tea Extract|GI upset, liver toxicity|Liver risk at high doses|GRAS (Generally Recognized As Safe) in food form|
|Caffeine|Anxiety, insomnia|Tolerance, dependence|FDA-regulated, not restricted|
|Berberine|Constipation, cramps|Drug interactions|Not FDA-approved, but legal OTC|
|Semaglutide|Nausea, vomiting|Ongoing use required, expensive|Rx-only, FDA-approved|

Some compounds (e.g., synephrine, DMAA) have been **banned in various countries** due to cardiovascular risks. Always vet supplements through databases like [Examine.com](https://examine.com) or the [NIH Office of Dietary Supplements](https://ods.od.nih.gov/).

# ⚖️ Nuance + Contradictions

* **Garcinia cambogia** showed weight loss benefits in early studies, but a 2011 Cochrane review found the effects negligible \[6\].
* **CLA (conjugated linoleic acid)** was once hyped for fat loss, but newer meta-analyses suggest its effects are minimal and inconsistent \[7\].
* **Ketogenic diets** show promise for weight loss and insulin sensitivity, but adherence is hard, and long-term data is mixed.

# 📦 Dosage, Delivery, Stacking

* Most supplements come as **capsules** or **powders**
* Stacking (e.g., caffeine + L-theanine or green tea + fiber) may have *synergistic* effects, but research is sparse
* Cycling (e.g., taking berberine for 8–12 weeks on/off) may help reduce tolerance or side effects, though not clinically standardized

# 📉 Final Thoughts

Sustainable weight loss isn’t just about burning fat — it’s about **changing systems**: metabolic, hormonal, behavioral. Some supplements can *help*, but none are magic pills. Evidence supports modest benefits from caffeine, EGCG, and berberine, while GLP-1 drugs are a game-changer for clinical obesity — at a cost.

Always talk to your doctor before starting anything new, especially if you’re on meds or have preexisting conditions.

Backstory, I (28 F) got engaged and have been planning a wedding so I made a trip out to see one of my bridesmaids( 32 F)  who lives in Arizona and included my other bridesmaid (28 F) who lives in New York to come along because these are my only two bridesmaids in my wedding so I didn’t want a traditional bachelorette party I just wanted us to get together more of a chill girls weekend! Well one of my bridesmaid the one who lives in  Arizona (let’s call her Lisa)  has a boyfriend (Marco)  that I don’t really like they had came to visit me one time in Nashville and he just spoke very negatively about women and also she had barely spent time with us while she was here with him it seemed more like a couple trip then spending time with me and my now fiancé. I would also like to say my other bridesmaids (lets call her Samantha )  also had come out as well and me and Samantha had an amazing time while Lisa and Marco kind of did there own thing and Marco just wasn’t really someone who we were vibing with. Anyway after that trip fast forwards a year later now I went to  Arizona to see Lisa and Marco and Samantha came down too so we can all hang out ! I will say Lisa and Marco did pick me up for the airport and originally had no idea Samantha was coming it was more of a surprise for Lisa because she thought it was only going to be me and eventually my fiancé might join. The first day was fun we went out to eat they were very generous to let me stay at their place! She even decorated her apartment with cute things for me she did a lot of sweet things! Fast forward to the next day I tell her we have to go up to the airport to pick up my fiancé which was actually Samantha ! So we spent the whole first half of the day together and then once we picked up Samantha things changed, now me and Samantha are close we had gotten close because we are very similar in a lot of things and while she was here in Nashville we spent a lot of  together so yes iwas super excited to see her. And I will admit that i clung to her alittle more because Lisa is always with her boyfriend Marco, and Marco is very controlling we can’t really just have girl time because he’s always there. So the days go by and me and Samantha are spending a lot of time together we are drinking dancing laughing and Lisa can’t drink due to a surgery she had which is fine! But she seemed very stand offish even went to do some shopping and Samantha stayed with me helped me find a cute pair of shoes for my wedding while Lisa  went back to her apartment to take a nap with Marco. So the trips goes on and the last night we all 3 just the girls for the first time that whole trip go to the hot tub! And that’s where Lisa tells me how left out she feels and how she wanted to leave the group chat and how now she basically doesn’t wanna come to my wedding because all I care about is Samantha. Mind you this whole time I never have any indication that she felt left out, she said at one point we went to a coffee shop and I had said to Samantha I can’t wait for her to meet my hairstylist at the wedding and she said it hurt her feelings that I didn’t include her in that. Which I get it but she was standing in front of us with her boyfriend while me and Samantha were behind having a conversation. I tried to apologize and told her though I understand how you feel it’s unfair for you to put expectations on me when all you do is have Marco around and don’t even include yourself in things with us, I brought up how in Nashville she did the same thing and I didn’t make a big deal about it. Anyways we talked it out or at least I thought we did but now a few weeks later I’m setting up the plans for my Airbnb and she basically says she’s not going to come to the wedding and because it’s made for best friends and family only and she’s not comfortable now. And it’s hurtful because I made her a bridal box had matching shirts for all 3 of us , I put a lot of effort and love into it. And she dropped out so I told her then we don’t need to be friends then and she saying I’m holding on to the stuff in Nashville and I need to get over it but now we have blocked each other  and the group chat ended AITAH?

**Step 1: Set the right vibe & frame –** You need to have that flirty and sexual vibe from the beginning. Most guys play it too safe, come off platonic, and get friend-zoned before the date even begins. Instead, you start with having at least a semi sexual bio. Then you continue that same energy over text. This can range from sexual innuendos to full-on sexting and everything in between.

Finally, when you meet up, you hold strong eye contact, build sexual tension, touch the girl, and ultimately physically escalate towards sex. You’ll be surprised how many girls will be receptive to a guy who is consistent from the start.

**Step 2: screen her** – In real life, you want to test her response to light flirting and mild sexualization. If she plays along, slowly turn up the heat. For online, I used to ask, “What are you looking for on here?” once there was some buy-in. If your profile’s sexual enough, this filters fast. These days, I screen more subtly—through the whole interaction *and* in how I frame the date itself. Inviting her to my place is part of the test.

**Step 3: set up good logistics:** Dates should *enable* sex, not get in the way. Skip dinners, group hangs, or halfway meetups. I stick to 4 options: her place, my place, bar walking distance to my place, walk, or coffee near my place

My go-to is inviting her over “to split a bottle of wine on my romantic patio.” It’s low-pressure but clear. Responses usually fall into 3 categories:

* **Yes**: These girls are the most down. Some may want reassurance (safety, expectations, etc.). Handle it smoothly, and they’ll show up.
* **Wants public first**: Cool. Offer a nearby bar. Girls will typically appreciate you being understanding and because the sexual tone was clear from the start, the attitude usually is “if this goes well, then we’re gonna have sex”
* **Gets offended**: Rare if you’ve framed things right. Either way, you just saved yourself a wasted night.

**Pro tip:** Never do halfway meetups. They rarely go anywhere. Hold your frame—sometimes the girl will “cave” and agree to your plan.

My go-to is inviting her over “to split a bottle of wine on my romantic patio.” It’s low-pressure but clear. Responses usually fall into 3 categories:

* **Yes**: These girls are the most down. Some may want reassurance (safety, expectations, etc.). Handle it smoothly, and they’ll show up.
* **Wants public first**: Cool. Offer a nearby bar. Girls will typically appreciate you being understanding and because the sexual tone was clear from the start, the attitude usually is “if this goes well, then we’re gonna have sex”
* **Gets offended**: Rare if you’ve framed things right. Either way, you just saved yourself a wasted night.

**Pro tip:** Never do halfway meetups. They rarely go anywhere. Hold your frame—sometimes the girl will “cave” and agree to your plan.

They were not named,  
but they moved like myths—  
the kind of presences written in margins  
and felt in the silence between heartbeat and breath.

One taught you stillness.  
Not the forced kind—no—  
the kind carved from mountain air  
and long walks with stars whispering overhead.  
He didn’t fix you,  
he walked beside your brokenness  
like it was holy ground,  
spoke of Sisyphus as if he’d known him,  
and left your rage unshamed.

One was a fire in winter.  
She didn’t lecture your sadness  
but wrapped it in wool and scent of coffee.  
She made music possible—  
placed strings in your hands before the world could tell you  
you weren’t meant to sing.  
Where others would bind, she unburdened.  
Not with answers,  
but with arms that never asked you to be lighter.

And there was a shadow,  
a small one with too much laughter  
for a world this cruel.  
They called you out on your bullshit,  
danced through your logic traps,  
and met your cynicism  
with chaotic, radiant noise.  
A counterpart,  
not in contrast, but in rhythm.

Even the house had a soul—  
soft fur, quiet purring metaphysics,  
a gaze that knew things no god ever told.  
She didn’t speak in words,  
but you understood:  
some creatures are built to love  
without needing a reason.

And on your birthday,  
they didn’t throw parties.  
They gave you time.  
Letters inked in their own thoughts.  
A book that said, *""You’re not alone.""*  
No cake, just presence.  
No candles, just warmth.  
No performance—just *being*.

You weren’t their project.  
You were their poem.  
They didn’t raise you.  
They *stood with you*.  
In the war against entropy,  
they were your ragtag revolution.

And when the world forgot your name,  
they whispered it back  
like a prayer passed between stars.

Seriously, I don't know whether to call it winning or a total glitch in my human programming. 😅

Usually, my Sundays consist of panicked productivity sprints and that nagging oh-my-god-it's-Monday-tomorrow feeling... but this time, I just blanked out entirely. I sat on the couch like a zombie, binge-watching some old sitcoms without a care in the world. Zero panic, zero motivation, just me and my coffee.

The weird part? I thought it would feel worse. Like maybe I'm not adulting right if I don't care about deadlines for once? Maybe it's ironic success? Idk. It's like, ""Oh look, I finally got what I wanted... no stress... yay?"" But tbh, I think my brain just decided to take a mini vacation and forgot to bring me along for the ride.

*Trying to change my antidepressant to see if it helps my stomach at all. I was on Zoloft but switched to amitriptyline to see if it would help - it seemed to help my stomach pain a bit but due to side effects of the medication I have been unable to continue it. 

Current diagnoses: Anxiety, IBS/functional dyspepsia

Family history: Several cancers including colon, lung, tonsil, and brain cancer. High blood pressure and vasculitis runs in my family

My stomach issues started over 5 years ago. It initially presented with throat symptoms - lump in throat, sore/red throat, etc. Received a diagnosis of LPR from an ENT. Over the next year, my stomach issues worsened. Chronic pain on left side under ribs, constant stomach/abdominal discomfort and pain. Constipation. Often skipped meals due to the pain. Pushed and pushed for testing, starting with a barium swallow that showed reflux. Then I had an endoscopy and colonoscopy that showed chronic inactive gastritis. My colon was clear but the presence of internal hemmoroids was noted. 

Over the last year, my stomach and bowel issues have gotten worse. I feel full very quickly after eating. I favour foods/consistencies such as mashed potatoes, smoothies, ground meats, etc. as they seem easier to tolerate. My abdominal pain has increased and I have severe bloating after eating (I look 9 months pregnant). I struggle either with constipation or I'm going #2 5+ times a day. Either way I feel I cannot fully empty my bowels and always feel uncomfortable. I always feel pressure in my rectum. I feel pain in my lower back and tailbone area when passing stool. There is no blood in my stool and my stool test was normal. Blood tests have been normal aside from slightly elevated red blood cells. I also had another barium swallow recently 5 years after my initial one due to choking on my food more frequently, which showed I now have a sliding hiatal hernia (2cm). 

I'm just at a loss for what to do. I've tried various PPIs which mainly provide relief for my throat symptoms and little else. My doctor has said all my tests are normal and nothing else can be done. I'm confused as to what is CAUSING my symptoms and what I can do to improve it. I don't eat spicy or acidic foods, I don't drink or smoke, I rarely drink coffee, I've lowered my dairy and sugar intake. I'm trying to avoid gluten as much as possible. The changes I've made haven't really seemed to change much. I just want the pain to lessen. I don't know how I can continue on feeling this way. My husband and I want to have a baby soon but I feel like I'll be too uncomfortable and in pain to carry one and I'm devastated.

Everything is great we love each other very much and genuinely care about one another.

My girlfriend is tall and skinny, and she has a very flat chest (not that there’s anything wrong with that). One night, while we were hanging out at my place, she randomly asked if she could tell me something that had been bothering her. I said, “Yeah, sure,” and made us some coffee.

She then started telling me that, for the past two weeks, she’s been feeling increasingly insecure about how she looks. She said she dislikes the fact that she has a flat chest and is tall for a girl, and that she feels like people don’t find her attractive because of those features. She then asked me if I find her attractive despite those things?.

I was kind of stunned when she said that and didn’t really know what to say at first. Eventually, I tried my best to reassure her and make her feel more comfortable. After I finished, she told me she had to leave because she had work the next day still with an upset look on her face.

Thanks for the inspiration in this thread: [https://www.reddit.com/r/MoneyDiariesACTIVE/comments/1ktqrw9/comment/mtxepqm/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/MoneyDiariesACTIVE/comments/1ktqrw9/comment/mtxepqm/?context=3)

I've used the into questions suggested by u/[NewSummerOrange](https://www.reddit.com/user/NewSummerOrange/), and added one more of my own. 



***Grocery Diary***

*How many people are you feeding, HHI, Cost of living for the area.*

Feeding two cats and two early 40s humans in Tasmania, Australia. My income varies so I can’t say 100%, but we’ll earn somewhere around $120,000-$130,000 combined this year. This gives us a comfortable lifestyle, but not one in which we can justify being wasteful with food (as if that were ever justifiable in a world containing so much starvation and food waste anyway).

It’s hard to know how to describe the cost of living, really. Australia is expensive generally and food tends to be very expensive, but our area has typically been comparatively cheap, but then also prices have risen a lot in the last few years. So... MCOL, maybe? 



*How many meals do you typically prepare at home in a week?*

Almost all. We usually go out for lunch once at the weekend, but I enjoy cooking and it helps keep costs down. 



*Do you have any dietary requirements or goals?*

No dietary requirements. We both enjoy a wide range of cuisines and eat most foods. I try to get enough protein and fibre in our diets, and to eat a solid amount of vegetables. My husband cheerfully admits that he would live on sausages, chicken nuggets and chips if I wasn’t around, but will eat virtually anything if it's on a plate in front of him - the only exception is that he has a strange and unreasonable prejudice against Japanese curry, which I love. For my part, I can barely stand to be in the same room as asparagus and don't like olives and oysters. 



*What's your most loved kitchen appliance/gadget?*

We just got an air fryer. I am now an air fryer person. I’m sorry to all the people I judged for banging on about their air fryers before I saw the light. Except for the bread and the cakes, everything I cook this week was done in the air fryer. 



*What are your top three places to buy groceries?*

Australia’s supermarket duopoly is dominant, and we do most of our shopping at either Coles or Woolworths. There is one locally owned Tassie chain though, Young’s Veggie Shed, and I try to pick up stuff there when I can. It’s more expensive but the quality tends to be higher and it’s nice to not give my grocery money somewhere else occasionally. 



*Bonus question: How well-stocked is your house food-wise?* Very! I was a few days into this diary when I realised that it wasn’t actually the best week to choose, as I did a really big stock up shop a few days before it started, and most of the food that I ate this week was already in the house. I can’t remember everything I bought, but it at least includes: milk, eggs, butter, whole chicken, beef mince (a solid quantity thereof), beef/chicken sausages, spicy pork sausages, packet spinach, potatoes, onions, cauliflower, canned black and dried white beans, zucchini, avocadoes, bananas, sour cream, chili crisp, mayonnaise, flour, sugar, broccoli, parmesan, rice, baked beans, ice cream, wet cat food, oven cleaner and probably a few things we ate immediately and so I’ve forgotten them. I also generally just like to keep a well-stocked pantry so many of the things I use this week (eg coffee, farfalle, dates, nuts, panko, all herbs + spices) are from earlier big shops. At the end of this week we’re still doing good for food and I will probably do another big shop towards the end of next week. The last big one cost about $200. 



**Day 1: Saturday**



Breakfast of a pork sausage, baked beans and a slice each of homemade bread with coffee. The sausages are slightly spicy, and while they’re delicious, they aren’t really a breakfast food. I decide to use the rest of the packet in a sausage and bean stew. 



Lunch in town (Launceston) of a bento box and a can of coke zero each, $41. This is a place we’ve always found to be reliably good quality and value, but it was a bit below par today, sadly. 



After lunch, we stop by a the good Asian grocers in the centre of town and stock up on a few basics and some snacks - red and green Thai curry paste tins, Indo cooking caramel, frozen makrut lime leaves, tapioca starch, belacan, frozen lemongrass, mochi, wasabi peanuts, and a little hessian bag with spices to make a soup base ($42). On the way out of town, we stop by Coles and buy shallots, chillies, canned tomato, garlic and hamburger buns ($11). 



Dinner: Leftover pasta bake. It was meant to be a lasagna but I realised I was out of sheets at the critical moment, so it’s layers of farfalle with a homemade bolognese sauce and zucchini and then a spinach bechamel, and parmesan on top. I made a vast amount, so there’s also a large tupperware container in the freezer, to be brought out the next day that I’m too busy or lazy to cook. 



Dessert: chocolate ice cream. I also make up a batch of several litres of honey-ginger tea, which I slowly have through the week with ice. Turns out, you turn 40 and all alcohol tolerance vanishes (fuck ageing) so this is what I have when I used to have a glass of wine on a weeknight.  



Batch/prep cooking: I make a spicy sausage and black bean stew, which went into the freezer as soon as it was cool (and has yet to be eaten, incidentally), and I set a loaf of [homemade bread](https://www.recipetineats.com/easy-yeast-bread-recipe-no-knead/) on to rise. Learning to make my own simple loaf is one of the best skills I’ve ever acquired. 



*Total spend: $94*



**Day Two: Sunday**



Breakfast: toast with an egg, baked beans, and coffee



Lunch: The last of the pasta bake (well, except for the frozen bit in the freezer). Still good. 



Dinner: A Sunday tradition we’ve recently started is that my husband cooks burgers, and themes them with the flavours of a different country each week. We’ve just got back from a great trip to Bali, and so that’s this week’s theme. He has a crack at a sambal matah with beef patties (I know, not traditional for a Hindu island but we happened to have beef mince in the freezer) and it comes out great. 



Dessert: mochi



*Spend: $0* 



**Day Three: Monday:** 



Breakfast of weetbix, milk and banana.



Lunch: I took out a chickpea, peanut, and sweet potato stew from the freezer this morning, and have that with some white rice.  



Dinner: D made extra burger patties so today’s dinner is a carbon copy of yesterday’s. 



Snacks: We hammer the wasabi peanuts after dinner.  



Baking: I bake bread using the dough I started on Sunday, and boil some rice for lunch. 



*Spending: $0*



**Day Four:Tuesday:** 



Breakfast: Toast and vegemite for breakfast. 



Lunch: We have been watching Culinary Class Wars (I am impervious to pop music and dramas, but K-culture finally snared us with this one) and I am craving tofu (actually, I’m craving a number of foods because of this show, but not too many of them are readily available in rural Tasmania) so I go to the supermarket and pick some up, along with milk and paper towels ($11). I have some harissa fried tofu with more of the peanut and chickpea stew. 



Dinner: Air fryer roast chicken and mashed potatoes. The chicken was in the freezer and I had all the mash ingredients in the fridge. I strip the leftovers for D’s lunch sandwiches and save the bones to make stock.  



Dessert: I have a few bites of chocolate ice cream. 



*Spend: $11.* 



**Day Five: Wednesday:**



Breakfast: weetbix + milk + banana, coffee,



Lunch: I air fry some tofu with panko and have that on top of the last of the peanut stew and rice and chilli crisp (current food obsession, I know I'm late to that party). After lunch I pop to the local store to pick up flour for some baking I intend on tomorrow, and pick up onions, carrots and celery ($12). 



Dinner: I bought a cauliflower in the last big shop and I notice in the morning that it really needs to be used, so I make a mustar-y mac and cheese. I pull out a mixed packet of beef and chicken sausages, and grill the beef ones to go with it. I also set another loaf of bread to rise: the one I made earlier this week will last us for a while, this one will go to my husband’s colleagues at work for an afternoon tea they’re hosting. 



*Daily spend: $12.* 



**Day Six:** 



Breakfast: avocado toast. I bought under ripe avocados a week ago when I did a big shop and I’m delighted they’re finally usable. 



Lunch: I realise we have some leftover chicken from the roast (I thought my husband had used it all in sandwiches) so I have roast chicken, the rest of the mac and cheese and some air fryer chips. It feels extremely luxurious for a quickly thrown together lunch. 



Dinner: Mid-afternoon, I stare at the chicken sausages trying to work out what to do with them, they’re both of our least favourite sausage type by far. I settle on soup. I pre-cook some white beans and boil the leftover roast chicken bones for stock (they’re just sold as ‘white’ but I think they’re great northern beans) then de-case the sausages and cook them with onion, celery, garlic, and carrots and add the white beans, lemon, stock and frozen spinach (and a few herbs/seasonings obviously). It turns out very nice, arguably better than using normal chicken, and there are leftovers. Huzzah! 



Baking: After work, I bake a date, walnut and fig loaf plus a large white loaf of bread for a work morning tea my husband has tomorrow and have a slice from the end (I’ll need to slice it before serving to hide what I’ve done!). 



Extra: I don’t know if this should count as a grocery or not, but I needed to place a refill order for my cats’ dry food (the fancy little fuckers will only accept one specific and expensive brand of food, so I’m going to include it, because otherwise this would be a supermarket purchase - $65 inc delivery.). 



*Daily spend: $65.* 



**Day Seven: Friday**



Breakfast: I oversleep and have only time to grab a just-okay banana from the back of the fridge for breakfast. I have a super busy morning and an early finish today.



Lunch: I make panko-tofu nuggets and decide to be experimental with condiments. Turns out that sour cream and chilli crisp is an elite dunking combination.  



Baking: I have a last-minute cancellation and decide to bake some more for the afternoon tea. I run to the store to get cocoa ($7), and bake an espresso chocolate cake with a buttercream frosting. It looks a little basic so I pull out some freezer blueberries to get thrown in icing sugar and piled on top. I needed to remove some of the cake’s top level it, and obviously had to do some quality control taste-testing. 



Dinner: It’s actually Friday afternoon now (just got back from dropping the cakes off) so I haven’t had it yet, but we’ll have the rest of the chicken and bean soup (posting now so I don’t forget later 🙃)



After dinner: I’m planning a glass of wine and the last mochi. 



*Daily spend: $7*

Has she only just woken!? Nonoy smiled and bid us farewell, then disappeared down stairs. I heard the front door close firmly. I wasn't sure what to do. I was alone with this legendary stylist. But, I had a photoshoot to get. I checked my camera.

""Hello! Let's do this!"" 

Nikki opened the door and seeing the camera she smiled, of course. I snapped a picture reflexively. Nikki laughed, ""Oh, so you want a candid shoot?""

I wasn't sure about that.

""Um OK?""

Nikki nodded and stepped further into the hallway.

""Say, your readers like to see the behind the scenes, right? So, let's pretend I just got up and you are following me 'fly on the wall' style.""

I pointed out that she had just woken. ""Nikki, arent you going to change into something more.. suitable? You look like you jumped out of bed and threw on that gown.""

Nikki grinned, ""That's because I did. Let's go, you can follow me in in just a minute, I have some coffee if you want any.""

""Sure."" I said.

She just woke up, how can she look like this? Well dear readers, fair or not, this is how she looked not 5 minutes since waking.

I caught her checking herself in a.mirror, and then she moved to a sitting room where she had coffee waiting. Maybe she woke earlier after all.

Please enjoy the pictures in this first batch, we shot several scenes and those will follow over the next few days.

One last thing dear reader, Nikki directed the shoot herself, all I had to do was hold the camera. Momo was always hovering nearby, smiling in an ""if you take a picture at the wrong angle, I will make you pay"" kind of way.

Please watch for the next installment in a shoot we entitled ""Nikki's day off."" 

As I was leaving later in the day, Nikki confided in me, ""I'd been awake for an hour when you arrived. I told Nonoy to act like I hadn't got up yet.""

1kywl7v,https://www.reddit.com/r/POTS/comments/1kywl7v/fatigue_medication_general_question/,Fatigue / Medication General Question,"I was relatively recently diagnosed with pots and I'm still sort of trying to figure things out. I did have one kind of random question, does anyone else notice that medications that are supposed to wake you up don't seem to do anything like that? I'm not talking about stimulant medications, but things like wellbutrin, certain allergy meds, Excedrin, and prednisone are some examples of meds that they generally say either have caffeine in them or tend to wake you up. For me none of these have had any kind of noticeable side effect like that but I am constantly tired. I can sleep for 9-12 hours (depending on the day) and still wake up tired (and the same goes for less sleep so the fatigue is definitely not from getting too much). Most of my pots symptoms have been pretty well managed with medications (I take propranolol and midodrine, along with diet modifications and electrolytes) but this fatigue I can't seem to shake. Also I just was kind of curious if anyone else noticed this with these other meds that doctors say to take in the morning because they can wake you up because some of these I've taken right before bed and had no issue falling asleep. I used to take wellbutrin twice a day (short acting), my doctor took me off of it because it wasn't recommended for pots but I did feel like it helped a lot with the brain fog, but I would literally take the second dose right before bed because I wasn't great at remembering to take it sooner and I never had an issue with it waking me up. I no longer drink coffee (or have any caffiene) since my symptoms got really bad last summer but even before stopping even regular amounts of caffiene never seemed to wake me up as much as they did with other people, I could drink a large coffee and go right to sleep. Has anyone else experienced anything like this? Also, what are you guys doing for the brain fog? Since my doctor took me off the wellbutrin the brain fog has been crippling and I kind of want to ask to go back on it but if there's a better option I'll definitely bring that up (also does anyone on here with pots also take wellbutrin?)

**The growth of hybrid work setups has brought a new problem: how to make sure office and**[ **remote workers**](https://www.toggletimer.com) **can team up . Hybrid work gives people more choices, but it can lead to broken communication different levels of visibility, and uneven access to tools. Teams might split up, with office workers leaving out remote coworkers from quick chats or choices. The answer is to use tools and plans that bring workflows together, include everyone, and focus on results instead of where people work. Here's how to close the gap—without hurting productivity or team unity.**

**The Hybrid Work Problem: Common Headaches**

https://preview.redd.it/el60esc9wu3f1.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a7baa9ebc1f1f2b202c9f8acc2d47898882988b4

[**Hybrid workflows**](https://www.toggletimer.com) **often have trouble with:**

1. **Time Zone Conflicts: Setting up meetings and deadlines across regions causes problems.**
2. **Spotty Communication: People working from home miss out on chats happening in the office.**
3. **Tracking Challenges: Bosses find it hard to keep tabs on work across different places.**
4. **Unequal Resources: Remote staff can't get real-time updates or tools as .**
5. **Exhaustion: Workers push too hard to ""show"" they're productive, no matter where they are.**

**If left unchecked, these problems break down trust, hold back new ideas, and split the workforce into two groups.**

**Ways to Bring Hybrid Teams Together**

https://preview.redd.it/nkfezfjdwu3f1.jpg?width=2400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=17b6dfefeb39498d777dae4f7f5089aa640336b5

**1. Line Up Schedules Across Time Zones**

**Problem: Meeting times centered around the office leave out remote workers in different areas.**[ **Solution**](https://www.toggletimer.com)**:**

* **Use tools that adjust to time differences to change deadlines and meetings based on where employees are.**
* **Capture meetings on video and give out summaries so people can join in when it suits them.**
* **Set up ""main hours"" when all teams work at the same time to work together.**

**Example: A group spread across New York, London, and Singapore uses a calendar everyone can see. It shows time zone changes to plan weekly catch-ups when everyone's working hours overlap.**

**2. Make Communication Channels the Same for Everyone**

**Problem: Important updates shared in the office (like whiteboard talks) don't get to remote teams. Solution:**

* **Put all communication on digital platforms (like Slack, Microsoft Teams) that everyone can access.**
* **Write down all decisions on shared drives staying away from ""watercooler"" updates that happen in one place.**
* **Ask people to turn on their video in meetings so everyone can take part .**

**Helpful Hint: Pick a ""hybrid helper"" for meetings to make sure people joining get to speak up.**

**3. Make Sure Everyone Can See Workflows**

**Problem: Bosses might favor people in the office without meaning to just because they're closer. Solution:**

* **Put objective productivity metrics into action (e.g., task completion rates, not hours logged).**
* **Use dashboards to show team progress in real time, no matter where people work.**
* **Have weekly ""progress syncs"" where all team members share updates in the same way.**

**Case Study: A tech company cut proximity bias by 40% after switching to output-focused KPIs tracked through clear dashboards.**

**4. Even Out Workloads and Stop Burnout**

**Problem: Remote workers overwork to ""**[**stay visible**](https://www.toggletimer.com)**,"" while office workers face distractions. Solution:**

* **Make clear what to expect for response times and when people are available.**
* **Use automatic reminders to tell employees to sign off after agreed work hours.**
* **Give out tasks based on skills, not where people work, to avoid putting too much on any group.**

**Example: A marketing team uses software to balance workloads and assign projects based on how much each person can handle. This makes sure no one—working from home or in the office—has too much to do.**

**5. Build Social Connections Both In-Person and Online**

**Problem: People working from home feel cut off, while teams in the office bond . Solution:**

* **Organize gatherings that work for everyone (like online coffee chats or office lunches you can join remotely).**
* **Set up mentoring between different offices.**
* **Share big moments in group channels to build team spirit.**

**How Tech Makes Hybrid Work Fair**

[**Tools**](https://www.toggletimer.com) **can't fix everything, but the right systems help level the playing field:**

* **Tools for Working Together Anytime: Apps like Notion or Confluence make sure everyone can see and find updates.**
* **One Place to Manage Projects: Software like Asana or Trello lets teams see all tasks.**
* **Ways to Measure Work, Not Time: Tools that look at what you do, not how long you sit at a desk cut down on judging people by where they work.**

**The Future of Hybrid Work: Culture First, Location Second**

**Strong hybrid workflows need a change in thinking:**

* **Trust Over Surveillance: Look at outcomes, not time spent at a desk.**
* **Flexibility as Normal: Allow staff to pick when and where they work best.**
* **Inclusive Leadership: Often ask for input from all team members to improve methods.**

**Conclusion: Building Bridges, Not Barriers**

https://preview.redd.it/asl5cjukwu3f1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=d35499e5dc06b231c2b4a3ebd5a59fbf76cf0d6f

**Hybrid work isn't about picking between office and remote—it's about building systems that boost both. Teams can tap into the strengths of all workers, no matter where they are, by setting clear communication rules, focusing on results instead of face time, and using fair tools. The aim isn't just to handle hybrid work but to excel at it building a workplace where everyone feels important, listened to, and ready to do their best.**

**Final Thought: The top hybrid teams don't worry about where work gets done, but how it gets done. By closing gaps on purpose and with understanding, companies can turn the hybrid model into their biggest edge over rivals.**

Then the 2nd encounter was an open umbrella appearing outside my house, but there was no delivery whatsoever, so i'm a bit confused and scared now because I have no idea who is placing umbrellas and it's really random.

1kywife,https://i.redd.it/oj81xukkwu3f1.jpeg,Daily pain - need some tips,"Hey all,

I was diagnosed a month ago with: 
Thoracic Scheuermann's disease.
20 to 30% anterior wedging of T7-T9 vertebrae resulting in mild thoracic kyphosis.

M, 35, 186cm (6’1”) & 77kg

I’ve been seeing my Physio for the last couple of months and have recently started on back strength. I’m happy to stay committed to it, as it seems like the right path forward, however, in the meantime, it’d be great to hear if others here have a suggestion for ‘temporary’ relief regarding the type of pain I have daily. 

I feel it at all times, a dull ache in my middle back, more to the right than the left, but sometimes it switches. Likely sits perfectly on my T7-9 (below my shoulder blades). Over the span of the day it gets worse, exacerbated by things that have me ‘leaning forward slightly’ and ‘looking down’ Stuff like cooking, cleaning, making coffee, eating at a table etc. It goes from a dull ache, to muscle fatigue, to pain, to feeling like it’s about to cramp up, and hard. It’s persistent and if I push myself it doesn’t ‘relax’ unless I’ve been lying down for about an hour; even then I can still feel it. 

When it gets bad I feel like I’m struggling to get a full breath in. I can almost feel it in my diaphragm. X-rays show that my lungs are clear. 

When I’m at home I can lie down flat and it helps, but when I’m out for the day, it just gets worse and there’s not much I can do to get relief. It’s at its best when I’m just walking around, and at its worst when I’m slowly browsing through a shop. 

It’d be great if someone with similar pain has worked out a way to manage this. A way to sit, stand, stretch, bend, whatever it is - and get that pain to calm down, even if only for a while. 

Right now I’m doing daily thoracic stretches and resistance band back exercises, as well as a run on the treadmill 1-2 times a week. 

Any help would be appreciated - I’m writing this post from bed in the middle of the day and it sucks. ",1,1748583526.0,kyphosis,1,1.0,False

Just wondering if anyone else has dealt with something similar on Coffee Meets Bagel. My account was recently frozen, and even after I submitted an appeal and it got unfrozen, I’m now stuck in a loop with their ID verification process.

Every time I try to verify with my driver’s license (which matches my profile info), it keeps failing for no clear reason. I even tried from a different device and phone number but keep hitting the same wall. I’ve also reached out via email and offered to verify via video call or photo, but still no resolution.

At this point I’m starting to wonder if it’s a system glitch or if false reports could be triggering some kind of auto-ban. Really frustrating, especially since I haven’t violated any guidelines to my knowledge.

Has anyone here successfully gotten through a situation like this? Would love any advice or insight.

It had been, what... weeks? He was losing track of time. It had taken him too long walking along the road, having to dodge the wildlife and sleeping in the rain when he couldn't find shelter. His hair was a mess, there were tears in his clothes, he hadn't had a proper shower or bath... He didn't know what he was doing by running away. And in retrospect, it probably would've been smarter to stay in the job. After all, he had just left for a stupid reason. Because the challenges were dangerous? It was a reality show, of course, the challenges were going to be dangerous. He shouldn't have signed up for the job in the first place if he was concerned about that...!<

>!Sighing, he looked up at the bartender and decided who should order a drink.!<

>!""Hey... just give me the strongest thing you have."" He said miserably. Oliver would likely need a strong drink to cope with how he was feeling.!<

>!""Woah, dude! What happened to you?"" Oliver adjusted his glasses, surprised by the new voice. It sounded familiar... Once he looked across the bar, he saw that Connor was sitting a few seats away from him. What? Why was Connor here? Shouldn't he have been at the motel?!<  
  
>!""Connor? What are you doing here?"" He asked. Connor chuckled.!<

>!""Just here to have a drink and take my mind off things. But what happened to you, man? I thought you were still working as an intern."" Oliver shook his head.!<

>!""No, I uh- I quit because I didn't agree with how the challenges were being handled. They were getting pretty dangerous. I guess you'd know that, though."" Connor nodded. He had had it harder than most people with that dare.!<

>!""You got that right, sonny. The challenges were a bit hectic. I have seen that Kristal was improving, at least in making the challenges less dangerous."" Oliver looked at Connor in shock. Kristal had been... improving? Had she taken his advice to heart?!<

>!""What do you mean by that?"" He asked. Connor smiled at him and pulled his phone out, showing the VR challenge. If they had done that in VR... maybe things had been getting better? And maybe Oliver had overreacted...!<

>!All of a sudden, Kristal walked up to the two. Oliver gasped in shock.!<

>!""Miss Kristal!? What are you doing here?"" He asked. Kristal looked tired.!<

>!""I'm... here to apologise, Oliver. For what I did. I know it was wrong, and I'm sorry. I treated you horribly, and you were right about the challenges being unsafe... but that's why I want you back. I can't test the challenges properly, and Marcus won't volunteer. The campers will only get hurt if I'm the one testing them... if you've seen the episode, you'll know what I mean."" Connor nodded and showed a clip of a challenge functioning poorly. Oliver was surprised to see Kristal being apologetic, as he hadn't expected it from her.!<

>!""That's... very thoughtful of you, Ms.Kristal. But how did you find me?"" Kristal sighed.!<

>!""Tipiskaw is somewhat isolated, and this bar is in the nearest town to Tipiskaw. It wasn't that hard to find you."" Well, Oliver supposed that made sense.!<

>!""I guess that makes sense... but if I come back, will anything change? Being an intern still isn't a good job."" Connor nodded.!<

>!""That's right. Doesn't pay well... If you want, I can arrange for you to be a manager of one of my warehouses!"" Connor offered. Oliver looked at him in surprise. That was very generous of him!!<

>!""Would you really do that for me?"" He asked. Connor nodded.!<

>!""Of course son. If you don't want to go back to being an intern, your more than welcome to work at my company."" Kristal narrowed her eyes at Connor and then sighed.!<

>!""I... suppose I can't do much to refute Connor's offer. But I promise, there will be changes moving forward. You deserve a raise, and the conditions will be better. It's time I start being a better host AND boss."" She admitted. Oliver felt that Kristal was being genuine.!<

>!""Y-you really mean that?"" He asked. Kristal nodded.!<

>!""I do. Please Oliver, the show isn't the same without you."" Oliver sighed, weighing his options. He could manage a warehouse... but at the same time, he felt like he wouldn't be cut out for that job. By being an intern, he could help the show succeed by regulating the challenges. If he was a warehouse manager, he might drag Connor's company down since he wasn't experienced...!<

>!""Alright, I'll go back to the show with you."" He said, Kristal and Connor both surprised by the decision.!<

>!""What? Why, Oliver?"" Kristal asked. Oliver sighed.!<

>!""Well, it's just... sure I might get better pay as a warehouse manager, but I don't want to take the position. I didn't earn that position through my skills or hard work, I would've gotten it because Connor took pity on me. And I'm not USED to being in a management position. I'm always the one taking orders, so I can't give them to other people. I don't want to cause a hassle for Connor's company."" Connor looked at him with a pitying look but then nodded.!<

>!""I guess if that's your decision, I have to respect it. But hey, you can always come back after the show is over and look for another position in my company. I promise you'll be treated fairly."" Oliver smiled at that. He may not have gotten to know Connor well, but he could tell he was a good man deep down.!<

>!""Thanks Connor! Well, I guess we better get going Kristal."" Kristal smiled at him and nodded.!<

>!""Of course.... and Oliver?"" !<

>!""Yes, Ms.Kristal?""!<

>!""Thank you.""!<

>!**---**!<

>!**Kristal** walked into the Production tent with a sigh. It was surreal, almost. When she had gone on her ""quest"" to find Oliver, she hadn't been expecting to find much success. But now she had, and had even gotten him to come back, somehow. However, as a result of said quest, she was severely lacking in information about what had happened during Marcus and Nina's tenure. She didn't trust the puppet not to pull something stupid. And she didn't even entirely trust Marcus to rein Nina in if she did go rouge in the end.!<

>!Sighing, she looked around for Marcus and found him sitting coffee, Nina sitting in his lap.!<

>!""Marcus... I have good news. Oliver agreed to come back!"" Marcus smiled up at her and Oliver.!<

>!""Nice to hear that little one. And glad to have you back too, Oliver."" Oliver smiled nervously over at Marcus.!<

>!""So, Mr.Reiner, what happened while I was gone?"" Oliver asked. Kristal suddenly remembered that Oliver had missed the last two episodes.!<

>!""Ah, right, you missed the last two. Well..."" Marcus then proceeded to explain the events of Episode 8, and concluded with Riya losing in the Tiebreaker.!<

>!""Wow, that's sad to hear. I really wished Yul would get the boot..."" Oliver said, sighing. Kristal couldn't help but agree. That man had caused them nothing but problems.!<

>!""Well, what happened during Episode 9?"" Kristal asked. Marcus sighed.!<

>!""You aren't going to like this, but..."" Marcus trailed off, leaving Kristal confused. What could be that bad that it would upset her? But then she heard the news, and she was furious.!<

>!""Well, that's good. Do you think you could make something for Oliver and me? I'm already hungry."" Marcus smiled at her and Oliver and Oliver looked over at her in shock.!<

>!""You want him to make something for... ME?"" Oliver asked incredulously. Kristal smiled and nodded at him.!<

>!""Of course, I promised I would start treating you better this time around, and I intend to keep my promises."" Oliver smiled at that while Marcus went off to the kitchen.

1kywcxm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Neuropsychology/comments/1kywcxm/can_you_increase_your_average_level_of_awakeness/,"Can you increase your average level of ""awakeness"" or consciousness?","It seems like our mind's capacity is not static or fixed. For example you can hold less in your mind when you’re short on sleep, sick, currently falling asleep, fatigued from overwork, pulled in too many directions at once and unable to focus, low on blood sugar from lack of food, in a food coma from too much food, have just been sitting down for too long, and so on.

On the other hand you can often hold more in your mind when you’re well rested, have had enough physical activity or exercise, maybe a tea or coffee. Sometimes when you focus coherently on a single task or subject for an hour or more, and your thoughts on the subject have accumulated in detail, clarity, and organisation, it seems like your awareness is not just more focused on that subject, but is bigger in overall quantity, that you are holding much more in your mind than usual.

Is this concept of your overall ""level of consciousness"" a coherent one? Secondly, while it certainly appears that you can increase it sometimes, or about some things, can you increase it overall/on average? For example if you spend solid blocks of time focusing on a task, but also take short, well timed breaks to reduce fatigue. If you get enough sleep, but also enough exercise. If you engage in a variety of interesting subjects and activities, thereby broadening your experience, but also give each subject enough time and space to really breathe and accumulate meaning and clarity, etc.

It looks like trying to increase your average level of consciousness could be a surprisingly good (and simple) proxy for living better in general: it requires engaging deeply with individual things but also attending to a variety of important or interesting tasks; it means getting enough of both rest and exercise, eating enough but not too much, planning well to increase the context and meaning of whatever you then do, etc.

One could imagine a chart representing a few days along the x-axis with a line that shows your level of consciousness going up and down over time. What are the best ways to increase the total area under the curve, or to maximise your five-day rolling average? Would that be a healthy thing to aim for?",0,1748582946.0,Neuropsychology,8,0.33,False

On and off some times it’s easy to sleep but lately for the past few years it’s been rough. (Currently 1:21am and this is just me rambling feel free to skip if you want.) I went to a sleep doctor who recommended cognitive sleep therapy. Learned about sleep hygiene and good habits which helped a bit at the time. Problem is it’s so fucking hard to stick to. The same exact sleep and wakeup time is just not really realistic for well anyone in my opinion. Currently waiting for a sleep study but it’s been months, will have to call them back. 

I digress. 

About 2 years ago I got my medical card. Doesn’t fix the insomnia all the time but usually helps me a lot. If I can’t fall asleep at least I’m high and don’t give a shit so that’s still better than being awake and getting pissed like I am now. I took a 25mg edible every single night. Have been trying to wean off it and got down to 14mg and then 5mg last week. This is my first night without. Well my mind started racing like it usually does. Chest feels tight and my body is just restless, constantly moving/fidgeting. Is this a normal reaction to taking it out of my system?

Deciding to take this to the extreme and hoping for a positive result. I will stick to avoiding my edibles and run the course. In addition to that I’m going to cut coffee and alcohol. (I haven’t had a drink in about a week so yay on that.) Has anyone else done this and has it worked? From what i know all of them can impact sleep. While I know weed helps many sleep I just don’t like how I’ve been so mentally fogged and lacking motivation lately.

looking for some insight ! for context -

i went to a bar on saturday night and had some chicken wings and nachos , immediately after i had sharp stomach pains and chest pains.

no bowel movement that night or sunday. monday was pebbles once and tuesday i decided to use a suppository and nothing came from that just liquid.

i decided to try restrolax for the first time yesterday ( wednesday ) morning mixed into my coffee and that helped me have a somewhat solid bowel movement.

thursday i tried it again but just mixed in water, no bowel movements and noticed my pee was difficult to start. didn’t think too much of it till later in the night i was bloated so bad i look pregnant. 

that’s when i decided to use the suppository again , left it for 20 mins and went to use the bathroom, again it was very underwhelming. 

1 hour later and it was awful , yes lots was coming out ( an orange color , which i found alarming but maybe it’s ok ? ) but it was hurting so badly i’ve never felt stomach pain like that in my life; i was sweating felt faint and now ive ran to the bathroom almost 3-4 times since taking it!

Numbers of cheat days : 1 , i was on wedding and didn't restrict myself, feelt bloated next 3 days, oh well.

I'm 182cm male.

First two weeks of dieting were the fastest, lost around 2-3kgs then steady loss around 0.8-1kg per week, except one week i didn't lost a gram (i think it was at 82kg)

Starting weight 96kg \~ CAT3 i think, around 28-30%

Current weight 81 as last Saturday \~ borderline CAT1/CAT2 i think around 15-16% body fat. The book is kinda fuzzy to me, so i hope the CATs are alright.

Staple food in my diet: CHICKEN and Turkey breasts, Canned TUNA, Canned Sardines,shrimps, Fine Lumpy CURD, Cod, zero fat Greek Yogurt, protein powder, low cal VEGGIES (broccoli, cucumber, yellow paprika, zucchini ...), low fat milk for coffee, mustard, low calorie sauces, ground turkey (low fat), low cal Protein Yogurt (last two weeks), Banana, lean low fat ham.

That's pretty much it. I'm eating around 2 times per day, i mostly skip breakfast, at lunch i eat the biggest meal like 400-500g of chicken breast with veggies with custard. For dinner i picked some easy, prepared stuff like canned tunna or lumpy curd with low fat ham or zero fat greek yogurt mixed with protein powder (white chocolate taste). I didn't track calories, because with this system there is no way to eat a lot of calories. If you are hungry eat veggies. I also have  (caffeine free) coffee 3x per day with around 100ml of milk

I was doing PSMF before, like 2 or 3 times, but currently i have the easiest time to push through and i think it is thanks to eating a lot of veggies, so if you are struggling, i recommend eating more veggies !

I lift weights 5 days a week, i returned after 2 years (was lifting 2 years before the pause ) so i think i lost more weight than 15kgs, because muscle memory kicked in, my muscles are fuller and i still have strength gains every week. I have desk job so not much activity besides weigh lifting. Routine is PPL/R/PP/R repeat.

I also eat at canteen at work (during weekday, and when I'm not on home office) and my strategy was to eat soup there to fill my belly and pick the healthiest meat based meal there without side dish, then i picked salad or some veggies from the salad bar at work and i added it to my plate. Worked good enough but i prefer to eat at home, but this was i could socialize with coworkers at work.

For supplements I'm taking creatine (5-6g per day) and for month i was taking coffee so some caffeine, but currently I'm drinking caffeine free coffee.

I bought fish oil, magnesium, multivitamin and stuff as Lyle is recommending but i didn't use them because i didn't feel like it. I eat enough fish and veggies per week so i think i don't have need of that, i also had negative reaction from the magnesium.

I salt heavily, so no problem there.

After the two day holiday i will take the last shot of PSMF for \~month to get to the 10-12% body fat range and then i will lean bulk for at least a year and enjoy life. I will probably experiment with fasting on rest days, i did 40h fast yesterday and it was breeze.

1kyw7ak,https://www.reddit.com/r/socal/comments/1kyw7ak/living_in_idyllwild_a_hidden_jem_of_the_ie_inland/,"Living In Idyllwild, A Hidden Jem Of The IE (Inland Empire)","Tucked away in the San Jacinto Mountains, I cannot stress how lovely it is to live in this mountain community. You get the best of both worlds when it comes to rural and convenient living. Growing up in the IE, we only came up here for the snow. But when my partner and I were priced out of our hometown (Corona) we looked for green spots on the map that were relatively close so we could be near our families. So we moved up here in 2019. We're Naturally Introverts, so we liked the quaintness of it all, but when COVID happened, it brought a lot more new people who took the cuteness of the town and ran with it. Since then, it has blossomed into a paradise to live in. Where you can enjoy taking a walk or short drive into town when you want a sweet little treat or strutting the town for a nice dinner. There was an adjustment period when it came to transitioning to living in a somewhat rural lifestyle. But to me, the pros outweigh the cons. I'm hoping more young families move up here, especially with the house prices going down. Here is my list of pros and cons of living here since 2019 as a millennial. 

**Pros:**

* 2 hours from the coast, and 1 hour away from the desert: Sometimes it's nice to get off the mountain, so its nice and easy to take a day trip or weekend to enjoy the rest of SoCal. 
* Exercise is Everywhere: Easy hikes, Hard hikes, picturesque neighborhood walks, mountain biking, yoga classes, gym, pickleball, safe parks, rock climbing... If you feel like getting out of your house, there are so many ways to move your body.
* Cute town: Whenever family comes to visit, or you just feel like being social. Walking to town and chatting with a friend over a latte and bagel is everything Tumblr wished it to be. My friend and I call it Hobbit days. We have coffee or tea in town, walk around the antique shops, grab a sweet treat,  and go back to someone's house to paint. 
* Lovely drives: Sure you have to drive to get resources or visit family, but it's a straight, calm drive. Blast your music with the windows down until you hit that freeway. Beats sitting for an hour in bumper-to-bumper traffic, only to move 5 miles with people cutting you off. 
* Affordable compared to the rest of Southern California: 2019 Corona (where we were from), the Starting price for a house was 550k for a tiny lot. But up here, you could get a half-acre lot with a 3-bedroom for 300k. The prices skyrocketed after coved. But NOW the prices are coming back down. 350k will get you something decent, which is affordable for Southern California. 
* 4 Seasons in SoCal: In Southern California, especially the IE, it's always dry and HOT. Most of the year consists of constant triple digits or mid-90s (Fahrenheit). So it's been special seeing spring blooms, warm 80-degree summers, colorful autumns, and snowy winters. 
* Community: people look out for each other. When something happens, everyone checks in on neighbors and friends to see if they're okay. It's not uncommon to drop by a neighbor's house for a glass of wine or cup of coffee and catch up on gossip. 
* Fresh Air: When you're driving down the mountain, you can see the literal smog cloud that covers California. We have family from East LA that love it up here because they say they can breathe. 
* Chill nightlife: No, there are no bouncing clubs or music arenas. But there is always music playing in town. And we have several venues that bring in semi-famous artists for intimate concerts. Plus, our Halloween, 4th of July, and Tree lighting ceremony are pretty lit.  
* We do have schools: All kids aren't homeschooled. There is a K-8th-grade school that has a good rating, and buses that go to Hemet or Anza. Plus, one private art high school if you can afford it.
* The comforts of society: It is NOT off-grid living! There's still wifi, UPS deliveries, Home Depot deliveries, and the nearest city is 30 minutes away. It is not the last frontier. 
* Calmer living: There's nothing better than sitting on your porch and sippng your coffee to crisp mountain air. knowing you can go to the beach for the day or to see someone play at Pappy and Harriets for the weekend. Or stay home and enjoy your home. 



**Cons:** 

* All postal mail goes to the post office: It sucks sometimes and things get lost, but management has changed and since gotten better. 
* Groceries are expensive: There are two grocery stores up here that work in a pinch, but are overpriced. So once every one or two weeks, most make a 40-min trip to Hemet or 1-hour trip the Desert for a Sprouts or Costco haul, and you text your friend to see if they need anything. But we also get deliveries from Thrive Market and Instacart. 
* Snow: Growing up in SoCal, we only saw occasional rain, so shoveling snow was something to get used to. But according to friends we met up here, it's NOTHING compared to the Midwest and East Coast. 
* Longer shipping times: Amazon, FedEx, UPS will deliver to your house. It may take a day or two longer, depending on the company. In Corona, we had same-day shipping for Amazon, but we've gotten next-day. 
* No Fast Food: Boohoo, my favorite fast food is now a treat instead of the once-a-day meal when we lived in the city. It saves so much money and reduces health issues by having limited access to fast food. Home cooking is the way to go up here. It's easy once you get the hang of it. And chest freezers are your best friend. 
* Physically demanding: Shoveling snow, inevitable yard work, and chopping wood can be physically demanding. If I had a teenager, it would be a fun chore to throw at one. But as a child-free millennial, we have to do the work ourselves. 

I'm hoping more families and a younger generation looking to pickup a Hobbit-like lifestyle will find this post well. ",1,1748582338.0,socal,1,1.0,False

RIGel sat and listened to her counterpart. They were both in a beautiful theater, done in post-ultra-modern mixed with classical Rigellian architecture. It carried sound but most of all it brought out the emotion in thick rich song notes.

RIGel listened to her alternate self as the section of the gestalt that had been trapped in The Bag finished up the operatic lament on the sheer ferocity of the Lanaktallan attack. RIGel nodded. While forty-thousand odd years had gone by for RIGel, with long periods spent inactive, only fifty odd years had passed for her counterpart, and all of it high tetraflop demand.

Like Trea had once said: When the busy times comes you miss the boredom, when the boring times come you miss the excitement.

She sat and listened as the lesser gestalts performed their parts for the recovery.

TerraSol and the rolling warm seas of Venus had always had a high population of Rigellians and their ducks. The feeling of safety made it so the ducks were calm and happy. The Terran concept of eco-engineering had been a boon to the Rigellians and ensured that the more popular spots were also xeno-engineered to ensure the ducks were as close to living in paradise as one could get in the mortal world.

She recoiled at the description of the EPOW camps. How each day dozens, then scores, then hundreds, then thousands, then tens of thousands of Lanaktallan succumbed to neural scorching until a neurosurgeon managed to come up with a fix. RIGel breathed a sigh of relief as her counterpart sung to her the relief so many Lanaktallan felt knowing their friends, and them, would survive.

Then came afterwards.

The rebuilding. The integration. The assimilation. How amazement and culture shock gave way to adaptation.

She laughed at the ill-fated super-spy whose rival got him elected to the Hamburger Kingdom's Flame Broiled Senate. She giggled at the rival being hauled away on trumped up charges of being a Lanaktallan. She laughed at the antics of Hetix the Telkan media star and Shiv'vayla the singer.

There was sorry, but it was always tinged with happiness.

Yes, they had been cleaved from the main Gestalt, but war did strange things.

Finally, the presentation was over and the younger self moved over and sat down.

""Are you displeased?"" it asked.

RIGel shook her head. ""No.""

""Will we be merging?"" the younger one asked. ""I'm nervous at such a prospect.""

RIGel sat for a moment then did her best James Dean. ""Baby, you ain't missing nothing,"" she said softly. She smiled. ""You have gone far in a short amount of time. With the Mar-gite's return and how our people must quickly move to a fight for their very survival, what would be the benefits in us merging?""

""My military outlook?"" her younger self asked.

RIGel shook her head. ""No. I am far better served having you serve as an advisor to RIGMIL and RIGMILINT,"" she reached out and touched the forehead of her younger self, leaving behind a complex rune. ""There. I dub thee, daughter mine, RIGSOL.""

RIGSOL smiled.

LEEbaw slammed down the plasma cartridge, grabbing at his drink and upending it.

It was full of population metrics and data analysis.

""JAWNCONNOR!"" LEEbaw yelled, shaking his fist in the air.

His other two, one that handled the military affairs of expatriated Leebawans, the other that handled their civil affairs joined him in the ancient shout.

LEEbaw checked the LEESOL and LEESOLMIL against his own metrics.

Females laid more eggs. Male fertilization was stronger. Tadpoles and squirmlings were stronger, larger, and more intelligent by several deviations. Aggression was higher by one standard deviation, but self-discipline was also higher by two standard deviations.

The Leebawans that had come to Terra to see the world that spawned their saviors had come by the thousands, by the tens of thousands.

Now they swam in the warm oceans of the Gulf of Pirates, the warm seas of Venus, and other places. While TerraSol had deeper seas than the Leebaw homeworld, their shallow coastal shelfs were wondrous.

LEEbaw thought the ""Cult of the Full Moon"", which was a female led quasi-religious group, was only a natural outcome of having been in such a wondrous place. The pictures of the large satellite, a pale white with a string of glittering lights from the shipyards and the lunar colonies, took LEEbaw's breath away with their magnificence.

Of course, he was smart enough to know that meant the tides were fierce and the waves crashed against the shores with near-cataclysmic fury.

Another shot. This time it was the number of Leebawan underwater commandos. Hundreds of them. The crossloading of his data to his 'little brothers' made both LEEMIL and LEESOL slap their hands together with glee. They were ancient records, records very few still cared about.

But the Leebaw cared about those early years, when the scars and rage of the Lanaktallan Unified Council had still burned hot. When the metal came to Leebaw and experimented on the squirmlings, the tadpoles, the females.

When they had learned the lessons of Jawnconnor.

LEEbaw was proud to share those ancient statistics, filled with dreadful names such as P'Kank and NoDra'ak and Trucker and Vuxten. Those ancient days when all raised their fists and screamed ""WE WILL NOT GO SILENT INTO THE NIGHT!""

All three of the Leebawan gestalts shook a plasma rifle like the type that they had pushed the PAWM from their planet with, then slammed down a cartridge for it onto the bar top. They grabbed their shot and drank it eagerly.

 After all, it was good to catch up with family.

The red-eyed Telkan held tight to TELK as they dropped through nothingness.

Only for a moment. The red-eye holding TELKen slammed back first into a painting on glass, the glass shattering and spinning away. The fragments held tantalizing glimpses of Telkans going about their daily lives. Working in offices, working outside, doing construction, writing emails, giving lectures. Even some broodcarriers were teaching classes to tiny little podlings sitting in bowls paying attention.

The shards disintegrated into powder that twinkled and vanished.

More blackness. TELKan struggled against the red-eyed creature holding him, bringing up firewalls, trying run encryption hash tables, trying to create feedback loops.

The red-eyed Telkan smashed through all of it easily, almost contempously.

Another pane of glass, this one shattering into complex geometric shapes, voxels and pixels scattering from the shards. Here a broodcarrier at an apple, there one carefully made a peanut butter and honey and cow's butter sandwich. There another sat in a swing with podlings clutching on her, rocking back and forth while reading a book full of emojis and icons.

TELKan struggled harder, but no avail. The ones holding him had him trapped in a function loops, unable to take any actions that might protect him.

Three more crashes, again with slice of life. From podlings in school or playing in the park to broodcarriers sitting in classrooms to maternity wards full of podlings and happy broodcarriers.

Then a stunning impact against what felt to TELKan like concrete. Slamming down hard enough that his digital bones rattled, that his core strings compressed and felt bruised when they expanded back out.

""Got 'im, boss,"" the red-eye rumbled, standing up and still keeping control of TELKan.

It was a nicely furnished room. Overstuffed furniture, monitors on the walls, ambient nanite lighting, comfortable rug, window cracked open to let in a warm spring day's breeze.

At least, it would be, if it wasn't entirely digital.

The Telkan on the comfortable looking couch, sipping a cup of coffee, had a broodcarrier on one side of her and a pair of males on the other. The two males looked as different as outfits could make them. One was sporting obvious cybernetics and wearing old style adaptive camouflage, the other was wearing comfortable street clothing with only a data link.

The broodcarrier was wearing a tunic with flowers and smiling cartoon insects.

The female set down the cup and leaned back, folding her hands over her stomach as she looked TELKan up and down.

TELKan could feel the port searching and tried to resist.

What hit him was core string codes. Old codes, downright ancient codes. Instead of digital dust and the flat taste of long term archival, the codes tasted of blood, warsteel, and fire.

""Yeah, that's him,"" the female said. She nodded. ""Set him in the chair.""

""OK, boss,"" the red-eye said.

""good boy telksolmil is good boy,"" the broodcarrier said softly.

TELKan could feel the pride and pleasure in the one holding him as the broodcarrier spoke. Before he could say anything or try to move he was slammed down into a wooden chair so hard his core strings compressed again.

The female got up, taking the time to straighten her pleated dress, then slowly walked around the chair.

The red-eyed Telkan held TELKan in place without any seeming effort.

""So..."" the female drew the word out. She stopped in front of TELKan, putting her hands on her hips.

TELKan tried to open his mouth but a wire twisted around it.

""I'm not interested in excuses or any paltry mewlings from you,"" the female said. She shook her head. ""I'm not even sure you are the *real* gestalt of the Telkan people. Your core strings are so divorced from the population inputs and metrics that you look like you belong to another species.""

""naughty"" the broodcarrier hissed.

""Definitely,"" the civilian male said.

""I don't know what you're thinking, but it isn't good,"" the military one said.

The female moved around slowly. ""Sweetie? You should leave.""

The broodcarrier sighed, but still got up and waddled from the room.

""Now that we're alone,"" the female grinned.

The two males grinned with her.

TELKan squirmed, trying to get loose as the female kept prying at him with packet sniffers, port sniffers, and other esoteric penetrations systems.

""Bad core strings, bad aggregation models, bad policy metric analysis strings,"" she stopped, leaning forward. She made a motion.

The red-eyed one grabbed TELKan's face, using his fingers to pry open TELKan's eye.

The female stared into it.

""Process interrupt chains. Data deflection modules. Output modification sidecar channels,"" she shook her head, straightening up. ""I doubt you can deliver the proper time of sunrise to your populations,"" she turned away, walking back to the couch, where she sat down. ""You have only fifteen planets listed as being part of our people's star nation, yet according to my data, updated from third party sources less than an hour ago, there are nearly three hundred systems claimed by the Telkan people, over a third of which have industrial and manufacturing facilities in operation.""

She waved her hand and the wire slithered off of TELKan's muzzle.

""Any explanations?"" the female asked.

TELKan activated his security.

Or, at least he tried to.

Cascading errors made him writhe in the chair, feeling digital pain move down his body.

""Don't bother lying. You're not even close to having the amount of flops and cycles that I've got just to render this lovely cup of coffee made from beans from the Home of the Gods,"" she smiled suddenly. ""Did you know that Kalki wanders those mountains with his two goats? I like to think that he knows how much I enjoy coffee from his home.""

The smile went away.

""But you, my not-so-friend, have tried to lie to me. Came here with the intent to absorb me, to security lock my data, and then who knows what to my people,"" she said.

""Just... just offer them the right of return,"" TELKan gasped.

The female snickered.

""That's a half lie. Chuck?""

TELKan started to frown.

That's when the red eyed one grabbed his head and pushed fingers into his eyes, ignoring TELKan's scream.

An image appeared over the coffee table.

""We just fought at civil war over whether or not the legends even existed, much less to put that archiac and useless religion back where it belongs. Now you tell me that The Bag is open and there's literally thousands of Telkan who not only knew *of* those legends, but some who worked with them, *knew them personally*, or, possibly worse, fought beside them?"" A female Telkan was saying. She leaned forward and slapped a male. ""WE JUST FOUGHT A WAR TO PUT THAT RELIGION IN THE DUSTBIN OF HISTORY AND NOW YOU TELL ME IT'S REAL?:""

The female on the couch shook her head. ""Well, well, well.""

The image flickered again to show the same office, the same female, but different males.

""Pull back the Marines and the Telkan Navy,"" she was saying. ""Anti-spinward and outcoreward are lost. The Treana'ad, Mantid, and Rigellians can try to hold the Mar-gite back, but simple numbers show they're going to lose.""

""Our estimates believe it will take the Mar-gite nearly five centuries to cross the Great Gulf. In that time, a counter-measure should be developed,"" a male said.

""Confed looks like they believe they can stop the Mar-gite, or at least outfight them,"" another male said.

The female scoffed. ""They're probably betting on the Terrans to carry the weight,"" she laughed and shook her head. ""They've been isolated from the universe for forty-thousand years. Our technology is probably the equivalent of magic to them.""

The scene flickered again.

""It looks like the prisoner transport was lost with all hands. Looks like it moved too high in the bands and hit a shade pocket,"" a male was saying.

The female just smiled.

""That solves that problem. Nobody else saw those machines before we got them back under wraps,"" another male said.

The female just nodded, still smiling.

Another flicker.

""The electorate is too stupid to know what they want. Literacy is down to less than 33% of females and only 20% of males. Even iconoliteracy is dropping,"" the female sneered. ""With the penetration the neural adaptation systems are getting, I could tell those idiots that the sunrise tomorrow will be green and unicorns will pull the magic light ball across the sky and most of them would believe it,"" she tapped the desk with one hand. ""The Senate doesn't even realize that I don't pay attention to anything they say.""

The female behind the desk suddenly smiled.

""Planetary Director and being replaced every three years is so sloppy,"" her smile got wider. ""Telkan crave tyranny. They yearn for the boot on their neck,"" her smile somehow widened more. ""As their queen, I will provide the stability that only a single vision can provide.""

The images stopped and the female on the couch stared at TELKan, who was panting and squirming in the chair.

""How... interesting,"" was all she said. She picked up her coffee and sipped at it. She smiled at TELKan. ""Well, isn't that interesting?""

""What?"" TELKan managed to grate out.

""Those little videos have been seen by a half million Telkan and rising,"" the female said. She chuckled. ""It is funny, in a way. We had the First Marine Expeditionary Force, the Telkan Divisional Force, and then the units to fold the Telkan Marine Corps into the Confederacy,"" she sipped again, the tips of her ears turning pink. ""Oh, now they're sharing them with non-Telkan,"" she shook her head. ""There was just over sixty thousand broodcarriers here, nearly two hundred thousand males, and eighty thousand females.""

On the table little figurines appeared.

""This is what was here when The Bag went up,"" she said. She waved her hand. ""These are when I came online at Year-Two,"" the figurines showed multiple little ones. ""Two years and there were nearly a half million podlings. Of those, a full half of them were little broodcarrier podlings.""

She waved her hand and more and more figurines appeared. ""The Telkan population after fifty years in The Bag number in the millions, across five different locations.""

She suddenly snickered as an image of a white wig wearing Lanaktallan appeared, firing pistols in two hands, driving a car with his knees, eating a taco with another hand, and his upper right arm around the shoulders of an attractive Telkan female with ""I AM A TELKAN ASSASSIN AND SPY"" on her shirt that slowly  rotated around a Telkan skull with red glowing eyes that was in the center of the shirt.

She was holding a plasma rifle and wearing sunglasses as the car sped down the freeway.

""A VOTE FOR ME IS A VOTE FOR TELKAN LIBERTY! VOTE NOW, VOTE OFTEN!"" appeared.

""Ah, the author of the Broodcarrier Education Omnibus, one Mister Ba'ahnya'ahd,"" she chuckled.

She smiled. ""We have multiple areas here on Terra itself. Some on Mars,"" she bared her teeth. ""It's a little more... shall we say... aggressive there. We have some on Venus. Lovely gardens,"" she waved her hand.

A picture of broodcarriers moving through an exotic garden, holding podling hands with bright eyed podlings holding onto their soft fur.

""Broodcarrier Park on Venus,"" she sighed. ""Planted by the broodcarriers,"" she giggled again., ""I remember Senator Ba'ahnya'ard kissing and juggling podlings as he flexed his muscles to the oohing and aahing of the broodcarriers as he announced the park open.""

She suddenly turned serious, staring at TELKan.

""Twenty-eight percent are calling for me to execute you. Right there. In that chair. To strip apart your core strings and hang your digital body in the digital species town square,"" she stated, her voice cold. ""A queen? A queen?""

She shook her head.

""Do you know who I was patterned after? Who I was put together from social media postings and the like?""

""No,"" TELKan managed to say.

""Brentili'ik. The First Planetary Director,"" she said softly. ""There was a lot of footage on her, interviews, and people who worked with her. I was put together based on her,"" she giggled, a cold, sharp thing. ""Of course, I was creched and birthed here on TerraSol, even while the debris from the invasion was still falling into the atmosphere and burning up.""

She stood up and moved in front of TELKan. She looked down at him.

""Give me a reason to let you live.""

I waited until the stroke of midnight to say happy birthday. I made sure to say it. We went to the mall. We went to the cheesecake factory, I bought you food, I even got your mom a cheesecake. Your presents? I planned for months before. Shopped in June, had them all ready by July. August, a week before, I wrapped them and I couldn't wait to show you how much I appreciated you.

  
Wasn't that all a mistake.

  
It was my birthday and you sheepishly took me to where you took the piggy boy. Ya picked out the place and surprised me, and yet, you looked like you didn't want to be there. I almost burned my tongue trying to finish my pho quickly enough to get outta there. 

  
We got back to your neighborhood and in your car, there was a birthday card. There was a happy birthday bag in the backseat; I was over the moon. I was so excited to unbox my gift on my special day. We began to say our goodbyes, and then you said:

  
""I ordered you something. It'll be here soon.""

  
At first, I didn't know what to say. I got out of the car and then drove home; the words began to sting more and more every time I repeated them. No biggie. No worries. 

  
It was 1am on the next day when I realized. You never said happy birthday, neither. You took me out to eat out of obligation, and the look on your face was obvious. 

  
Thank you for the birthday wishes and gifts, I said.

  
Then you cancelled the gift. 

  
Bought a $150 Logitech mouse with the money instead.

  
I never knew what it was.

  
It was Christmas a few days prior, same deal. I got you quite a number of stuff; including that godforsaken Red Bull Formula One jersey I knew you'd love. And you did. There's not a second where I want to snatch my jersey that I paid for back from your closet because of what you did.

  
For Christmas, you told me to meet you by your car for my gifts. I couldn't wait to see what ya got, I walked in with such a big smile on my face that dropped almost instantly. Had to compose myself and smile through the pain.

  
A coffee cup off amazon and two boxes of tea purchased just then at the grocery store. 

  
I saw you ordered yourself something much more expensive with the cup.

  
I liked the cup until April 2025, four months later, rolled around. I had the tea twice, and once you betrayed me. The cup is gone, the tea, gone for longer. I miss that cup. ",1,1748582249.0,u_Far-From-Saturday,0,1.0,False

So, like most of you, I'm aroace. 

I'm also a celibate. Childfree. An aplatonic. An atheist. Non-smoker and non-drinker (teetotaler). Drug-abstinent. And I'm kinda poor haha.

It's like the only thing I have going on for is my gender, because I'm cis.

And, yeah, my life is pretty much ✨boring✨

• Romantic dates are a no for me.  
• Hook-ups are also no.  
• Want me to go to a bar to drink? Pass.  
• Smoke with you and talk about problems in life? I don't want to.  
• Dress up and go to church? Not my thing.  

Heck, I can't even go to a cafe and just hang, because I don't drink coffee, I'm not the type of person to insist hang-outs in the first place, and did I mention I don't have that extra money?

It's like I have going on for are my hobbies, and developing my skills. 

It's not like those are bad alone. It's...difficult relating to their lives as a result. It's just, when it comes to hanging out with people, my personality pretty much cuts the supposedly commonality I should have among them. Like the very basis of interaction, it's kinda hard to have it when you're lacking in those areas. 

I still think I'm neurotypical though...

So, am I sad? Not really I guess? I'm pretty much okay being alone, because I feel most in control when I'm just by myself. 

When I'm around other people, it feels like a puzzle, just wanting to put the right pieces just so they won't think I'm off-putting. But even then, I don't put much effort to actually make them like me in a way they'll continue to hang around with me? Like, if they eventually don't want to be with me anymore, I don't take it personally, and just move on with my life. 

But, it does get lonely sometimes. My fault I guess, I'm having trouble maintaining friendships with such enthusiasm because I just feel apathetic to other people.

It's like, the only way you could connect with me is if we have the same interests. But, I know deep down, it still won't be enough for someone to stay with me.

Is it weird that I don't mind dying alone? That I'm perfectly okay with people eventually forgetting me? 

I'm fascinated on what kind of life I could be living years from now. I'm still young, and as of this moment, I don't have much going on for me. And I wonder if my relationships with other people in my life today would remain in this form as I grow older.

I'm not living alone at the moment, but eventually I think I will do so at this point. It feels scary, just me being responsible for my well-being for many years...

I hope my post resonated with some of you. As much as being alone is a blast for me, to be the only person living in this type of life feels... isolating, and I hope I'm not the only one feeling this way so I could know if there are people who are able to cope with it, and live their lives to the best of their ability.

TLDR: My ""absence"" of a personality makes it hard for me to interact with people naturally or casually. But I don't mind not having much people in my life. And I fear me not minding it could make my life unfulfilling in some way. I don't know how to live my life having this ""absence"", and I want to know how other people who have the same (or almost the same) experience as mine are able to live their lives being happy and contented.",4,1748581596.0,aromanticasexual,0,1.0,False

**AITAH for telling someone I would never let myself get as fat as her?**



I know how it sounds but hear me out. I (25F) was at a dinner out with a group of 6 girls all around my age. I grew up with and am really close with three of the girls. I didn’t know the other two very well but they were close with my close friends. (They all went to college together).

We were eating at a nice restaurant downtown in a city. Our table was up against a window and a homeless woman approached the window and was obviously on something or mentally ill. She waved at us and was saying something we couldn’t hear over the noise inside. Everyone just looked at each other, giggled, and ignored her.

It was pretty chilly out and she looked cold. I got up and met her outside and handed her a couple of bucks and wished her well. When I got back to the table one of the girls I didn’t know that well, I’ll call her Emily, said “who just lets drugs take over their life? I would just never let myself get like that.” I was fuming.

I paused and looked at her. For some backstory, Emily is the heaviest girl in the group. We are all different body types, I am not skinny, she is plus sized. Also, I am a recovering drug addict. My brother was also a heroin addict and experienced homelessness a some point. He died of an overdose when I was 17.

My family is full of addicts. I continued down that path and addiction had me in its grips. My friends at the table went to college, I went to rehab and got sober. I said “yeah exactly, I would never let myself get over 200 pounds, just put the fork down am I right?” Everyone was silent.

You could cut the tension with a knife. Emily looked at me clearly upset and explained how she had a thyroid issue and chronic fatigue syndrome and for some people it’s really hard to loose weight. I said “well maybe that woman has an issue that we don’t know about.” And I left some cash for my food and left. My friends I’m close to texted and said I was out of line and that Emily is super self conscious. I feel bad for going low and hitting were it hurts but I just wanted them to get some perspective. I don’t think I owe Emily an apology before she apologizes. AITAH?

EDIT: everyone knew about me. We went out a week before and I explained the whole story to explain why I wasn’t drinking.

**Signal\_Aide9820**

*ESH. I totally get it. But you could’ve nicely corrected her by saying “Well we don’t know what people are going through. Having empathy goes a long way” Rather than stooping just as low as her. Going after her body was pretty low. I understand that you were personally triggered. However that does not give you a right to go after someone’s looks.*

**Holiday-Sun6373**

*Exactly. Her comment was messed up, but going after her weight just made things messier. A little empathy would’ve hit harder without the extra drama.*

**Late\_Smoke**

*ESH. You’re entire group sucked the moment you all laughed at an unhoused woman. Emily’s comments were uncalled for, but yours were equally as bad if not worse because you did it solely to spite her.*

**basic\_hypo\_mania**

*The moment they laughed, would have been my cue to go. Surrounding yourself with people like that is so exhausting.*

>OOP: Myself and another friend weren’t laughing at the woman. I didn’t make the comment solely to spite her. I made it to point out how ignorant and insensitive she was being. Because I know the “put down the fork” statement that a lot of idiots make is ridiculous. I said it knowing it was ignorant to prove a point. But I get we probably both suck. I had a knee jerk reaction and I should have chose my words more kindly.



**\*\*Judgement - ESH\*\***



**Update - 1 day later**



Yall are TORN. Thank you some for the honesty and some for the kind words. Update: I asked Emily for a coffee this morning to apologize.

We met and I started off with saying I was sorry for making it personal and making a comment about her appearance and I would be really hurt if someone did that to me. Then went in to explain how her comment about addiction being a choice is really uneducated and offensive.

She said “thanks for apologizing, but my dad is an alcoholic and he chose alcohol over my mom and I. I would just never do that.” I tried to explain to her that her dad got to a point where he didn’t have a choice anymore he had a disease. And he probably felt shame everyday for it.

And I’m sorry that you didn’t get what you needed as a kid or now. He probably didn’t either and that’s why he found a way to cope, just like I did. She said she understands now and why she copes with food sometimes. I gave her props because food addiction can be so challenging because you can’t just stop eating unlike drugs where you don’t even have to be around them. We thanked each other. We shared more stories. We will remain friends and try to connect more. Thanks folks

**maid\_assassin**

Oh brother… I feel for you, I really do. I was raised by an addict and I love him to death but ohhhh brother.

You can’t dictate how every addict is. You are projecting and you have projected your experience onto Emily, who has her own experience with addiction via her father’s alcoholism. People, especially children, who are raised in that environment are victims. You can’t explain it away and you should not try to do so.

If you feel offended by her experience with addiction, own that feeling. I’m sure it hurt a lot and I’m sorry for that. Like I said, I love my father despite how horribly he failed me. And it is 100% a failure. Love and understanding doesn’t cover that up. Empathy doesn’t take away the disappointment and pain caused by addiction, particularly when you’re a child witnessing the damage it causes. It changes you on a fundamental level and you ought to be more empathetic to that fact for your own sake and your own experiences in your formative years.

Growing up in and around addiction is painful. You cannot center yourself in everyone’s experience with it. Rather than ask or educate yourself with Emily’s experience, you lashed out and then carried on with a patronizing conversation victimizing her father. I’m glad things are better now but try not to own the addiction experience too much. You aren’t the only one.

**60threepio**

*Apologizing and then immediately pivoting to invalidating is wild.*

**StellaSaysSo**

*Everyone in this story needs a lesson in empathy.*

**Lola-the-showgirl**

\**So you just don't take any responsibility for your addiction? It's something that happened to you, that you had no control over, and anyone you hurt and any bad thing you did isn't your fault, right?*

>OOP: I do take responsibility. I take responsibility for everything I’ve done and have made amends to everyone I hurt. The cards weren’t in my favor. I was born withdrawing. Born being addicted to opiates. Because my mom used while I was in the womb. I grew up watching addiction and thought it was normal. Once I started using, which yes was a choice but a lot of people make bad choices when they’re a teenager, I couldn’t control it. It made me forget all of the trauma and avoid my feelings.

>All of a sudden after using for 2 days in a row, I couldn’t stop. If I did I would go into withdrawal. Pretty horrific pain. Going through withdraws means no school, no work which I needed the money to survive, and how can someone go through withdraws on the street. You need a bathroom, electrolytes, support. Often times detox beds are only for people with insurance and only open for three nights. The more you use the more choices get taken away from you. I made a choice to get sober but it seemed impossible. I luckily had some resources and friends. Some people don’t.

1. How is the weather like in the last week of July?

2. What are some popular and widely available convenience store and do they serve alcohol?

3. I would be doing a day trip to ha-long bay, should I also do Hoa lu, Tam coc or should I do a day trip to cat cat village ( bus leaves at 7 am from hanoi, will be in cat cat village around 2 pm and will leave around 10 pm from there to hanoi)

4. Are international credit cards widely accepted at popular cafes, restaurants, clothing shops? If yes.. is any kind of fees charged to swipe the card?

5. Could I as a foreigner use momo wallet or zalopay and deposit money into its wallet using my credit card? And later use that wallet money to pay at stores.

6. What souvenir should I take back home? If it's coffee, suggest your favourite cafes where I can purchase coffee to take back home.


Thank you 😊

1kyvtaa,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1kyvtaa/circumstances_are_the_only_reason_she_left_and/,"Circumstances are the only reason she left, and it’s difficult to move on.","Hello, I’m looking for some advice on a breakup if I can even call it that (we only dated for the duration of may), I (27M) met the girl of my dreams (24F) and she was literally the female version of me, I’ve never felt so much in common or so compatible with someone and she’s shared that she felt the same. I was introduced to her by a mutual friend of ours, we hung out a few times as friends and hit it off immediately. After a week or two I asked her on our first date, and long story short she ended up telling her mom it was the best first date she’s been on with any guy (our mutual friend told me this). Things were going amazing, it felt perfect. When we had first started dating in the beginning of the month, she had brought up how she was planning to move to Boston in a year for grad school, she had already been accepted to BSU and this was her dream school but she was conflicted because of her life here in California, leaving behind friends and family. By our third date, feelings for each other continued to grow and we shared our first kiss, it felt super romantic. On the way to drop her off at home, she brought up how the situation of her moving in a year troubled her and made her worry about our building relationship. She said she wanted to continue on because of how much she liked me, as long as I was okay with the fact that she will likely leave and we’d be long distance a while. I told her without a doubt I’m all in, and validated her concern by ensuring I would stick by her side and support her move because it’s what she truly wants and I want her to be happy. Well, the next day she had her graduation for her BA and was asked a lot about her next move and where she’s going to school next, and this made her think a lot about everything with us and left her feeling overwhelmed again. That night, she was conflicted and a big part of her really wanted to work things out with me. But unfortunately the part of her that knew it would be too much for her won, she didn’t think long distance would work and explained that the first two years of a relationship mean the most to her and are the most important and she didn’t want to be in school across the country and be too busy to give me enough time. As unfortunate as it is, I agree with her reasons to call it. I tried to reason with her ofc, I told her in a year who knows maybe I pursue my career path in Boston too and I can get a job out there, but it felt unfair to her and honestly I can’t blame her because it was too early to make promises like that. It hurts so much that circumstances are the only thing that messed it up for us, it’s bittersweet too though knowing she showed me the way I deserve to be treated and the qualities I deserve and desire in someone. After a few days we tried to break contact to heal, agreeing that we would be friends again later. After a few days no contact, I reached out because it felt so weird not talking and I wanted to keep contact as friends. She jumped at this opportunity and missed me just as much as I missed her. This probably wasn’t the best idea, because we both still had feelings and flirted constantly. The second day of us talking again as friends (this last Monday) something happened and this is where the advice part comes in. She’s usually a very consistent texter, so I knew something might be off when she went on DnD for 5 hours and said nothing back. I thought nah she just is probably having a chaotic day or really busy, who knows. Well we FaceTimed later that night, and I noticed something was off and she was very hesitant to tell me about her day which is unusual for her, she usually loves to fill me in on stuff. It put me in a hard place because we were no longer together, so it’s not my place to pry but I couldn’t help myself (in hindsight I know this wasn’t the best thing to do) but I asked her what happened and what was going on, it was hard not to because I do still have feelings and care for her. She was hesitant at first, but admitted that she had ran into her ex at a coffee shop randomly (they dated 5 years, have been broken up about 8 months) and they caught up for the 5 hours, she mentioned that she told him about how life was and even told him about me. I technically had no right to get upset at her for it at this point, but I can’t lie it did hurt a bit to hear. I reacted calmly and asked her if anything had happened because my mind started to race, 5 hours is a long time. She ensured me that it hadn’t, and I believe her she’s given me every reason to take her word for things since we met and has been very honest from the jump. But even if something did happen, it’s just tough cuz I can’t really do anything about it regardless. I was really trying to separate feelings at this point to be her friend and nothing more, but it was hard after the flirting and the night prior she told me I had nothing to worry about as far as her seeing other people (unrelated, because this was a friendly encounter from what she says) She got upset that I had questioned her and hung up on me. We texted back and forth, and from what it sounded like he wants to be friends with her again too, and he didn’t like the fact that she was friends with me now. For context this guy was apparently really toxic, manipulative, and overall a shitty guy who actually forced her to cut our mutual friend out of her life at a point. I think she’s only giving him the time of day because their families are close, and he had a lot of mental health issues that I won’t disclose toward the end of their relationship. And I know she cares about the guy too, it makes sense. But anyways, she was very overwhelmed and upset with everything and due to me asking her more questions about it and if they would continue talking, and she stated she doesn’t even know if she wants to be friends with him or either of us because we’re both asking too much of her, I guess due to him not liking me talking to her and she could tell I didn’t really either. After thinking more rationally and not reacting off of emotions, I explained that it’s okay and i do not mind who she talks to even him because putting those feelings aside is worth it to have her in my life still, but she did not believe me. I don’t take her for the type of girl to allow this guy back In her life making demands exactly like the ones that lead to her leaving him in the first place.. but anyways we agreed to stop talking for now so she can decompress over all this and reach out when she’s ready. She stated that she wanted us both as friends and cares for both of us but it was too conflicting so I don’t know what’s going to happen, it sucks. I really did want her as a friend because I know she doesn’t plan on dating before she leaves, so it wouldn’t be nice to spend some time with one another before she goes across the country. I miss and care for her a ton. But I am letting go of those romantic feelings and hope of us rekindling possibly, especially after the ex stuff. This girl is a genuine person, but it hurts not knowing if she’s friends with her ex now instead of me. I guess I’ll get those answers eventually though, and by then hopefully I’ll have moved on/ accepted things anyway. I know I will always appreciate and care about this girl though regardless. I pray one day maybe it could work out, but if it doesn’t for now I’m goal and career oriented building myself as a man. Maybe this is a vent more than asking for advice but I welcome anyone willing to share any. I’m trying my best to find peace from all this one day at a time.",1,1748580916.0,BreakUps,2,0.99,False

That question hits harder than any climb, any injury, any goodbye.
Because truthfully, I don’t know. Until I reach the peak — until I finish what I started — I won’t know. My mind is a battlefield. One part wants peace, the other wants war. One part tries to wash its hands of the past; the other clings to the version of me that died when I said my last goodbye to my mother. I know what I need to be: Emotionally bulletproof, Physically unbreakable, Financially relentless. But even now, as a calm, grounded man, none of it makes full sense. My instincts rage. My spirit burns like blossoms turned to ash. I came from a remote village — a kid with nothing but big lungs and a wild heart. Now I trek like a beast. I live like a soldier with no map, only a mission. I used to count pennies. Now dollars don’t even register. I used to chase validation. Now I chase altitude.
“I am gold for love. I am pain for the fake. I am bass in the silence - Even when I don’t care to be heard.” This book isn’t just words on paper. It’s blood on the page. Every cramp, every scream, every climb is a chapter.
Every breath in the death zone is a verse. ""THE UNPROVOKED ADRENALINE"" is a war cry — a challenge to the weak parts inside us. It’s about pushing through the heartbreak, the injuries, the betrayals — and still showing up. Stronger. Louder. Wilder. I wrote part of this on Day 21 after major surgery. So imagine me in base camp — broken body, full heart, eyes on the peak.
That’s where the real story begins.
Fuck luck.
I believe in blood, hustle, and coffee.
I don’t count the misery. I wear it like armor.
My brothers know how deep my heart runs.
The mountains know my blood’s loyalty.
We’re not made for suits and Lambos.
We’re made for storms, scars, and legacy.
We don’t play roles.
We live real and leave raw.

1kyvq8j,https://i.redd.it/qikumshxnu3f1.jpeg,Gotta brag about my new gig (pic unrelated),"I’ve worked in about… Eight restaurants in as many years, starting in a Greek pizza place in 2017. Since then I’ve worked in a deli, two pubs, another Greek restaurant (my longest gig, worked my way up to kitchen manager before I’d had enough bullshit), a ski hippy brewpub/pizza joint, and most recently, a dive bar with Italian-American/pizza.  
   
This place kicks the absolute dogshit out of every other restaurant I’ve worked in, in vibes, quality, and sheer attitude. I’ve been a pretty regular customer here for three years now, but I just recently started working here.    
  
The cast of characters:  
   
The Owner: A bald metal-head in his late 40s, former bouncer and speed chess hustler, black belt in Jiu Jutsu, played D&D religiously in the 80s and 90s, wears shorts and timberlands year-round. Saw him choke a rowdy drunk out during 4th of July two years ago.    
  
The KM: Ex-con (non-violent) who volunteered with FEMA during the hurricane Katrina cleanup because he was bored. Competitive MTG player. Weirdly passionate about the intricacies of smoked meats (he made coffee-rubbed smoked lamb leg prosciutto a couple months ago, I tried some last week and almost nutted on the inside of my apron).   
  
The kitchen crew: Misfits all. One guy’s hobby is tattooing his own legs, another dude has an encyclopedic knowledge of the Cthulhu Mythos, plays D&D, and shreds the guitar like a demigod. They’re all cool as hell. The dish washer is a mysterious ambiguously-brown man that is a little insane, and once did time for murder (acquitted, I think) in his home country of wherever.  
  
The thing is… Everyone cares about the food. The owner is in the dish pit or behind the line, busting ass with the rest of us. Everything is made from scratch, from the pasta to the pizza dough, to the fucking buffalo and bbq sauces. The only things that come from distributors are some fresh veggies, fresh meats, and *raw fucking ingredients*. He grows herbs at his house, basil, thyme, tarragon, chervil, shit like that. Even the garlic comes from his garden during the summer, and I have no idea how he’s able to grow all this shit while working as much as he does in the kitchen. He owns two restaurants and is throwing down in both of them so much I wonder if there are two of him.  
  
And everyone is so chill and helpful. My first day, i was training in the dish pit to learn where all the dishes go. The KM walks past the pit and says, “I’m gonna go smoke a bowl, holler if you need something”. 
  
Everyone pitches in on dish or other stations at the end of the night, so we all get out at the same time. And on the smoking thing, you can’t walk past a single BOH person here without them offering to let you hit their weed vape. I don’t even smoke but it was always a nice gesture.   
  
I have been considering getting out of the industry for so long, because I’ve just become jaded with these goddamn megalomaniacal small business owners that think investors = “pulling themselves up by their bootstraps” but they’ve never even worked behind the line. Last place I worked at, the weird ass ski people joint, the owner used to be a fucking *server*. Now don’t get it twisted, I respect servers, but they don’t know everything about the BOH, just like we don’t know everything about FOH, so he would come in and shuffle people around mid-rush because “X is better on apps and Y is better on pizza” so we would have to swap places mid-order, don’t know where the last dude left off, how much longer is on the shit in the oven, etc. It was an incompetent authoritarian nightmare.  
  
This place though? I feel like I’ve finally found my people. I can talk metal or chess or D&D with the owner, MTG or smoked meats with the KM, tattoos, D&D, and literature with the line cooks. I feel like I found my way here by happenstance and I have to document it, like some sort of pizza-slinging bard.  
  
TL;DR: New restaurant I started working at fucking kicks ass. I play chess with the owner sometimes, and he hired me by texting me, “Yo I need a guy that can sling pies and isn’t a crackhead.”",8,1748580619.0,KitchenConfidential,17,0.68,False

I tried to build myself to be a guy that could make a girl happy, and I believe I succeeded, except for that little detail of not being someone a woman wants to be with in the first place. 😅 

I've never even been on a date. I am a Christian so try to avoid the hookups and bar scene, and its definitely made it harder. Ive tried churches, small groups, hobbies, blah blah blah, the rare times single women are even available, when I try to approach I get rejected pretty early. I dont think im a creep--I try to treat women with respect, like I would anyone else, but also am clear that I'd like to get to know them romantically. Im not much of a flirter, have never really had a chance to learn how. But I think I present myself well, successful career, get along with my coworkers, I interview well. But just am not a romantic prospect at all.

I keep trying new things, joining new groups, and most of the time there aren't even women there. It just becomes an exercise in self-abuse after a while. My real joy is staying home, enjoying the world I built for myself, drawing, writing, and playing video games or reading. 

If there was a woman in my life that wanted to spend time with me, there would be so much id love to do with her. Id love to go to the mall, go bowling, go get coffee together, go for walks in the park. Id love to have her over and cook dinner for her. Id love to just sit on the couch next to her while we read. 

I just really dont want to get any older not getting to experience that kind of connection with someone. I want to love and be loved. I wish so bad that I could be good enough for someone.",1,1748580566.0,lonely,3,1.0,False

How Do I Know When to Stop Trying to Save Him?? M38 F39,"I feel like context surrounding the dog issue is important here, so bare with me. This is a story:

I moved into my boyfriend's house 2 months ago. He isn't as organized or aesthetically-inclined as I am, and I knew the large amount of tasks that lay before me. I'm someone who can't fully relax until everything has a place, is clean and decorated, becoming a sacred space to unwind in. I'll be honest\~ his home was disgusting. I found mouse droppings everywhere: on plates, on furniture, under the fridge, smack-dab on the desk where he works....I informed him and he did lay out traps. He moved into this house about 2 years ago, but he'd never bothered to install a laundry machine, and had been taking his laundry over to his friend's house every few weeks. I purchased a hybrid machine for us because as a massage therapist, I need to make sure my scrubs are fresh and clean every week. He has a black, very long-haired Australian shepherd, but didn't have a working vacuum cleaner (more on the dog later). There were literally tumbleweeds of dog hair EVERYWHERE. We found a Shark vacuum and I got to work immediately. The hair was so dense that the vacuum would need to be emptied every few minutes. But I got those floors cleaned, and I vacuum several times a week to keep it that way.

In the span of 2 months, I've worked hard to deep clean the entire house, completely restored and furnished the spare room, which had previously housed piles of stuff he finally donated (as well as home to droppings, sticky stuff, bug carcasses, things no one wants to deal with), primed and re-painted his kitchen upon his request (I've painted many a room before and was a professional set painter for theatre), scrubbed and painted his basement stairs (which had been caked with mud and flaking paint), painted him an accent wall in his office, found and assembled a medicine cabinet for small things that were lying around the floor in disarray....

His floors, counters, and tables were stacked with old mail/papers/whatever that just accumulated. I cleaned out trash that was heaped in his car and vacuumed that\~ old food, shoes, paper stuck together by spilled coffee. He had wanted to hang myriad pictures, but they lay stacked along the walls. I got us to finally hang them up. When I asked why he hadn't before, he said it's because his dog spooked at the hammering sound. We fixed the toilet, which had been leaking, and got a new roof (because it was also leaking\~ old house). There's still a gaping hole in his bedroom ceiling, though. I scrubbed and unclogged what was once an orange-with-mildew shower. His books and shelving had never been dusted, his windows never been opened. I came in like a white tornado of renewal, breathing new life into this place. The finishing touches are my paintings, plants, lamps and glowing lights to create a soft glow for relaxation. My cozy furnishings are welcome additions of color to what was once a grey/beige space.

To be clear: I was happy, even eager to do all of these things. As someone who's moved a LOT (sometimes overseas) I have a ton of experience in setting up/decorating a space to reflect personality, be aesthetically pleasing, and provide the soothing atmosphere that is how a home should feel. He has other assets\~ he loves to cook, he's happy to run errands, he's social, a history buff and a writer, loves his family. I understand that not everyone prioritizes a clean environment, and to be honest, I'm used to my level of organization, which is undoubtably higher than most. I took on this challenge, and I feel I've truly transformed our space for the best. He sees that, and he's so grateful. Together, we've created quite a charming abode!

But there's still the dog, the Aussie. He adopted him off of his best friend 3 years ago, because they were having a baby and he didn't get along with their other (older) dog. The Aussie had been through training and was apparently OK behaviorally. 3 years later, what we have now is a completely unruly, chaotic animal who's hyper-reactive, territorial, has severe separation anxiety, is not groomed or bathed regularly, and spends his days freaking out at every passing car, person, animal; sometimes nothing at all. I am awoken by jump-scares as his sudden tantrums of booming barks and lunging at the window literally shake the entire house. When he is walked, he can't be trusted around another living being, so if we see anyone else, we change direction. He has leash aggression, and begins each walk by barking madly into the ether. He counter surfs, and is in our way, constantly. The first time I came over, my bf made us dinner, and as soon as he placed the bowl in front of me, the dog ate right out of it. My bf didn't do anything, didn't even scold him, just said ""sorry"". The dog doesn't like when my bf leaves the house, so tries to HERD him back inside. I learned this because I found scars on my bf's shoulder and asked where they came from. So, simply leaving the house had become a complex series of moves to trick his dog into thinking they were going for a walk, then quickly throwing his leash back inside and closing the door, to a torrent of barking.

Well, I can't live in a house with an uncontrolled animal, so I took action. I reached out to trainers, his previous owners, family, anyone who could help. I found several trainers, even the one who'd originally trained this dog\~ spent time on the phone with him. I found a month-long boarding with great reviews by friends, even a program for Aussies especially, and sent those to my bf. I've done soooo much research and passed it along.....

I should mention this: I love dogs, grew up with them. I even painted my bf a portrait of his Aussie as a surprise gift. I love all animals. The benefits of having a pet is a happier, less stressed, more joy-filled life. But his dog seems to be pure stress: the opposite of how it's supposed to be. He's never even had guests over to the house and I think that's why. This dog is inhibiting our lives in so many ways\~ it's ridiculous how he permits it. I believe there is a perfect home for every dog; this just isn't the one for this particular dog. 

Now here's the reason I'm in a panic whenever the ""beast"" acts up. I have a cat. Not just any cat: a cat I met in Japan 6 years ago when I lived there, and whom I love so much that I actually immigrated her to The US with me, upon my return. She is an angel, my darling organey. But, she has been nothing but stressed since we moved in. We keep the animals separated, yet the Aussie has chased her several times. She's ever batted at him and hissed, but he didn't stop aggressively lunging at her\~ it's how he's wired. Since I can't trust the dog, and since he was aggressive toward me twice now (when I was trying to get him off furniture and away from our dinner), I absolutely keep them separated. The dog is attached to my bf by his leash whenever they are inside. He's in his kennel when my bf is gone. We have a fenced-in yard, but the Aussie can't be out there by himself because he loses his mind whenever he's apart from my bf. Even when my bf is in the bathroom, he just whines outside. We sleep in separate rooms. Because of the dog. There is very little intimacy, yet my bf always craves it.

This dog needs a lot of work, a lot of time, a lot of money into training, and tons of patience. Thing is, this isn't my dog, I never would have adopted an animal I wasn't prepared to meet the needs of. My bf has shown zero initiative to get him sorted over the 3 years\~ he let his previous training go out the window. For me and my cat, the dog is nothing but stress and noise and chaos. I wonder what the dog is possibly giving to my bf. ""He got me through a really hard time"", is all he replies.

You see it by now, don't you? All the signs are there. My bf is clearly depressed. He is trauma-bonded to this beast of an animal and has no intention of changing his behavior or lifestyle. He's shown no confidence or ability to instill the discipline this dog needs.

I'm beside myself with fear over the situation, which he is aware of. I told him I'm keeping an eye on apartments for myself and my cat for our wellbeing, and my bf only looks down sadly and says ""I hope it doesn't come to that.""

This is the man who is intent on marrying me, and having a child together. I just turned 39. If that is to happen, I don't have time to tip-toe around a wild-card dog, in the \*hope\* he doesn't decide to attack us on a whim. I certainly won't bring an infant into the situation. I've been hoping mu bf would clue-in and WAKE UP.

I don't want to be the person who makes an ultimatum: ""It's me or the dog"". I don't want my bf to harbor resentment. The answer is clear to me: we re-home the Aussie where he can have more space and maybe a herding job; what his breed desires. We can move forward in our lives.

Looking at everything I've tried to ""right"" and ""fix"" in his world.....I've always been someone who takes initiative for my own problems, instead of letting them collect and fester. I'm extremely independent; it's hard to trust others to care for what I care about. I liked being single, the peace of it; I felt whole. I'm a LMT, a fine artist, an actress, a puppeteer, a writer, a runner, a bilingual traveler with way too much life experience to feel this stuck, and at this age. I met someone I love and can see a future with, who at first seemed healthy and stable, but the cracks are beginning to show. And it's costing me my own peace, it seems. I just don't want to spend my life alone....but I'm prepared to.

1kyvjfm,https://i.redd.it/eis3r09wlu3f1.jpeg,New to Semi-Automatic Machines: Is My ES701 Espresso Extraction Correct?,"Hello everyone. 

I’m new to the world of semi-automatic coffee machines. I bought my ES701 about a month ago. Before this, I had a Nespresso, and I loved the espresso it made. I used to use Starbucks Blonde capsules to make my espresso lungo, and I thought it was the best. I bought the new machine to make not only espressos but also hot and iced lattes.

I’m having doubts about the results I’m getting from the espresso extraction with my new machine. I feel like the output volume is too low. I’m using Lavazza Super Crema coffee beans, and I already know that for the best results, I should use recently roasted beans. For my last double espresso, the grind setting was 14 and I got 18.1 grams of ground coffee, the strength was set to 2 dots, and the result was 40.5 grams of espresso in 33 seconds. Is this result correct, or could there be something wrong with the machine?

Thank you in advance.

I posted on 5/16 about a rally. My mom ended up having a 6 day rally. Within those 6 days she ate a lot, drank tons of water, smoked cigarettes, went outside, left the facility, took family pictures, had conversations and seemed somewhat “back to normal”. It was a bittersweet moment.

On 5/22 she started becoming slightly confused. Calling me by a different name. Asking me to repeat myself. She is declining and spiraling back into “sick mom”. 
On Memorial Day she states she’s going home. She only takes a few bites of food that is offered throughout the day. Drinking some water, maybe 10-15oz that day. 
5/26 comes, she barely takes a bite of food, very small sips of water, definitely confused, very very tired but restless. 
5/27, she’s no longer eating, takes a lot for her to even get an ice chip in her mouth, won’t answer/respond, swollen and can barely swallow, arms and hands cool to touch.
5/28- were told we have 48hrs. Won’t eat, 5ml of water administered every 1-2hrs if she allows it, few wet briefs, eyes open, gibberish talk, reaching to her sides, staring in corners, trying to get up, thinks she’s falling, jaundice, hands very cold. Starts liquid morphine.
Today, 5/29- day 2 of not eating, mouth open, using swabs to keep mouth from drying, deep throat sounding snoring, 10 seconds between breaths, staring at cieling, occasionally reaches, jolts as if she’s falling, few words here and there, restless, still turning yellow, warm hands, cool knees and feet. One wet brief.

We’ve made funeral arrangements, purchased a plot, finding pictures, had family and friend say see ya later (bc no one likes goodbyes) had the priest bless her and pray. I’m scared for the death rattle. I remember my grandpas and I don’t want to remember my mom like that. Idk how much time I have left. Sometimes I cry. Sometimes I don’t. We (dad, my sister and I) have given her permission to pass when she is ready. I feel awful I’m not in constant tears like my sister. I’ve taken care of mom for the past 10 years. I know her medical history better than my dad and sister combined. I know how she takes her coffee and why she hates her sister in law. We are friends as well as mother and daughter. When I found out we had 48 hrs, I felt a pain in my chest. A pain I can’t describe. I started shaking. Who will yell at me to go buy her cigarettes even tho she knows they’re bad for her? Who will tell me to have patience. I won’t get to have another birthday with her. She doesn’t deserve this kind of death. This feels surreal. For who knows how much longer I have her. I fear the end is coming sooner than I’d like. And I want to share that with you all. I’ve read the posts. I’ve felt seen/heard. Feelings validated.

# Best Half Circle Sofa 2025: Reviews & Top Picks

The half circle sofa, also known as the curved sofa, is making a notable comeback in interior design. Its unique shape offers a sophisticated and inviting seating arrangement, differentiating it from conventional linear sofas. These sofas have become increasingly popular among homeowners and designers seeking too create a statement piece in their living spaces. They offer a blend of style, comfort, and functionality, making them a versatile choice for various interior styles.

The growing interest in half circle sofas reflects a broader trend toward embracing organic shapes and prioritizing social interaction in home design. selecting the right half circle sofa requires careful consideration of factors such as size, material, comfort, and overall design aesthetic to ensure it complements the space and meets individual preferences. This review will guide you through the top options available in 2025, highlighting their key features and benefits.

## Key Features Analysis

The selection of a half circle sofa involves assessing several essential technical specifications. From the structural integrity to the choice of upholstery, each factor plays a key role in determining the overall quality and suitability of the sofa.

**Frame Construction:** The foundational structure of a half circle sofa significantly impacts its durability and longevity. High-quality sofas use frames constructed from kiln-dried hardwood, such as maple or oak, known for their resistance to warping and cracking. These frames are typically reinforced with corner blocks and glued joints to enhance stability and prevent sagging over time. The ideal frame thickness should be at least 1.5 inches to provide adequate support.

The type of suspension system is another critical component. Eight-way hand-tied springs are considered the gold standard, offering superior comfort and even weight distribution. Sinuous springs (also known as zig-zag springs) are a more affordable option that still provides decent support, but may not last as long. The density and gauge of the springs should be carefully considered to ensure they can withstand regular use.

**Upholstery Material:** The choice of upholstery material affects both the aesthetic appeal and the practical aspects of the sofa. Popular options include leather, velvet, linen, and various synthetic fabrics. Leather offers a luxurious look and is highly durable, but requires regular maintenance to prevent cracking. Velvet provides a soft and opulent feel, but can be more prone to staining. Linen is a natural and breathable option, but may wrinkle easily.

Synthetic fabrics, such as microfiber and polyester blends, offer excellent stain resistance and durability, making them suitable for households with children or pets. Look for high-quality, tightly woven fabrics with a Martindale rub count of at least 30,000 to ensure they can withstand daily wear and tear.It's also essential to check if the fabric is treated with stain-resistant coatings to further protect against spills and accidents.

**Dimensions and Configuration:** Half circle sofas come in various sizes and configurations to accommodate different room sizes and seating needs. It's crucial to measure the available space carefully before making a purchase. Consider the overall diameter of the sofa, as well as the depth and height of the seating area. A typical half circle sofa can range from 80 to 120 inches in diameter.

Some models come in modular sections, allowing for greater adaptability in arranging the seating. These modular sofas can be configured as a full half circle or separated into individual curved pieces. The seat height should be agreeable for moast users, generally between 17 and 20 inches. The depth of the seating area should provide ample room for relaxation, typically between 22 and 26 inches.

**Cushion Filling:** The type of cushion filling directly impacts the comfort and support provided by the sofa. Common options include down, feathers, foam, and fiberfill. Down and feathers offer a luxurious and plush feel, but may require regular fluffing to maintain their shape. High-density foam provides firm support and retains its shape well, making it a durable option.

Fiberfill is a more affordable alternative that offers decent comfort and resilience. A combination of different materials, such as a foam core wrapped in down or fiberfill, can frequently enough provide the best balance of comfort and support. The density of the foam should be at least 1.8 pounds per cubic foot to ensure it can withstand regular use without sagging. It's also essential to check if the cushion covers are removable and washable for easy maintenance.

## Core Benefits

Investing in a half circle sofa provides several distinct advantages in terms of aesthetics, functionality, and social interaction. These benefits go beyond the conventional sofa, enhancing the ambiance and usability of the living space.**Enhanced Social Interaction:** The curved design of a half circle sofa naturally fosters conversation and connection among people. Compared to linear sofas that can create a sense of separation, the semi-circular shape encourages face-to-face interaction. This is especially beneficial in living rooms or entertainment areas where socializing is a primary function. it allows guests to easily see and engage with each other, creating a more inclusive and welcoming atmosphere.

This type of seating arrangement promotes a sense of unity and encourages open communication.Whether it's a casual get-together or a formal gathering, the circular shape of the sofa facilitates better eye contact and makes it easier for everyone to participate in the conversation. This unique design also eliminates the feeling of being ""stuck"" at the end of a long sofa, offering greater freedom of movement and interaction.

**Space Optimization:** Despite its unique shape, a half circle sofa can be surprisingly effective at optimizing space, especially in larger rooms. by creating a focal point in the center of the room, it helps to define the seating area and visually separate it from other parts of the space. This can be especially useful in open-concept layouts where it's significant to delineate different zones.

The curved design also allows for more efficient use of corner spaces, which can often be underutilized with traditional furniture arrangements. The rounded shape seamlessly fits into corners, creating a cozy and inviting nook. Additionally,the open design of the sofa can make the room feel more spacious and less cluttered compared to having multiple individual pieces of furniture.

**Unique Aesthetic Appeal:** A half circle sofa serves as a striking statement piece that adds a touch of sophistication and style to any living room. Its unconventional shape and elegant curves instantly draw attention and create a sense of visual interest. This type of sofa can elevate the overall design aesthetic of the space, making it feel more luxurious and curated.

The versatility of half circle sofas allows them to blend seamlessly with various interior design styles, from modern and minimalist to classic and traditional. They can be upholstered in a wide range of fabrics and colors to complement the existing décor and personal preferences. Whether it's a bold velvet sofa in a vibrant hue or a more understated linen sofa in a neutral tone, the half circle design adds a unique and artistic touch that sets it apart from ordinary furniture.

## FAQs Section

Addressing common consumer questions directly provides clarity and confidence when considering a half circle sofa. Understanding key aspects like maintenance, sizing considerations, and ideal placement helps to make informed decisions.

**How do I clean and maintain a half circle sofa?**
The cleaning and maintenance of a half circle sofa depend largely on the upholstery material. For leather sofas, regular dusting and conditioning are essential to prevent cracking and maintain their suppleness. Use a leather cleaner specifically designed for furniture. Velvet sofas require gentle vacuuming and spot cleaning to avoid damaging the delicate fibers. Professional cleaning is recommended for deep stains.

Linen and synthetic fabrics can often be spot cleaned with mild soap and water.Always test a small, inconspicuous area first to ensure the cleaning solution doesn't cause discoloration or damage. Vacuum the sofa regularly to remove dust and debris. Consider using fabric protectors to shield against stains and spills. It's also essential to follow the manufacturer's specific cleaning instructions for the upholstery material.

**What size half circle sofa is appropriate for my living room?**
Determining the appropriate size of a half circle sofa for your living room requires careful consideration of the available space. Measure the dimensions of the room and consider the placement of other furniture pieces.A general rule of thumb is to leave at least 3 feet of walking space around the sofa. Avoid choosing a sofa that overwhelms the room or blocks pathways.

For smaller living rooms, opt for a more compact half circle sofa with a diameter of around 80 to 90 inches. In larger rooms,a larger sofa with a diameter of 100 inches or more can create a more impactful statement. Consider using masking tape to outline the sofa's dimensions on the floor to visualize how it will fit in the space.

**Where is the best placement for a half circle sofa?**
The best placement for a half circle sofa depends on the layout and function of the living room. One popular option is to place it in the center of the room, creating a focal point and defining the seating area. This works well in open-concept layouts where it helps to delineate different zones. Another option is to position it against a wall, particularly in a corner, to maximize space and create a cozy nook.

Consider the placement of other furniture pieces, such as coffee tables, side tables, and media consoles. Ensure that there is adequate space for movement and that the sofa is not blocking doorways or windows. Experiment with different arrangements to find the configuration that best suits your needs and preferences.## competitor Comparison

Alize sat on the short wooden fence outside JojaMart, her blue dress catching the morning sun. A few townspeople passed by, casting curious glances. She paid them no mind… she was waiting.

Five minutes later, Claire finally arrived, with the usual paper coffee cup clutched in her hands. As she saw Alize, she immediately came to a sudden stop.

Claire: “You again?”

Alize: “Nice to see you again, too. What a coincidence, really.”

Claire narrowed her eyes, pushing a strand of her strawberry-blonde hair behind her ears.

Claire: “Don’t you have a farm to run?”

Alize: “Already fed the chickens and watered the crops. I had time.”

Claire: “You waited here?”

Alize: “Just enjoying the town right now. Mayor Lewis invited me to breakfast, even. Say, your shift only starts until ten, right? Why not join us?”

Claire blinked.

Claire: “You… memorised my schedule?”

Alize smiled but didn’t answer.

Claire scoffed and walked past her, muttering about how weird the new farmers were. Still, she turned around just once before going in.

Before long, it was already 12 noon.

Claire stood at the Stardrop Saloon counter, glancing from the register to the salad in her hand. Her fingers tapped the counter nervously as Gus tallied the total. She opened her worn wallet. Bills. A few loose coins. She felt that tinge of shame.

Gus: “Short by a few golds...”

He gave a sympathetic look while maintaining a gentle tone. Yet Claire’s jaw tightened. She could feel the eyes of a few patrons around her, mostly just empty gazes, but it still stung.

Alize: “I’ve got it.”

Claire froze. She knew who it was. She didn’t have to look. Alize stepped up beside her, coins already in hand.

Claire: “Don’t.”

Alize: “It’s just salad.”

Claire: “I said don’t.”

Everyone could hear her subtle snap at that point. Yet after Alize gave an affirming nod, Gus took the payment anyway, sliding the salad bowl across the counter. Alize took it, holding it out to Claire.

Alize: “You skipped lunch again.”

Claire: “I am not your pet…”

Alize: “I’m not saying you are.”

Claire: “Then why are you always… here?”

Alize: “Because you want to be cared for… but you never let anyone do it.”

Alize’s voice was calm, but not apolegetic. Claire took the salad with an annoyed expression, snatching it from her hands.

Claire: “...Thanks. But don’t make a habit of it.”

The farmer nodded in response, smiling faintly as she stepped away. But the truth settled uneasily in Claire’s chest. She had eaten lunch today because of her. And that scared her more than she could say.

Before she knew it, 10:00 PM was on the dot.

JojaMart’s garish lights flickered off in a mechanical hum and Claire stepped out, exhaustion sinking into her bones. The night air was cooler than she expected, as she silently regrets not bringing her scarf. 

She barely took two steps before she noticed the silhouette leaning casually against a tree.

Blue hair. Blue dress. Unmistakeable.

Claire: “Okay, seriously, are you stalking me?”

Alize: “This is the way home.”

Claire: “This exact sidewalk?”

Alize’s smile was soft, hiding a slight chuckle. 

Alize: “Maybe I like the view.”

Claire instead rolled her eyes 

Claire: “You’ve been waiting for me all day.”

Alize: “I was really walking back home. And then I saw you looked tired. Thought I’d accompany you to your bus. Isn’t that a nice thing to do?”

Claire crossed her arms once more in defense.

Claire: “I’m not some puppy that you have to protect.”

Alize: “Once again, I didn’t say you were.”

She wanted to argue some more, but then closed her mouth shut and started walking back to the bus stop. 

After a few steps, she glanced at the side. Alize was keeping up with her pace, hands in her pocket, humming a familiar tune while looking at Claire intently.

Claire: “Are you always this persistent?”

In truth, Claire was charned by the farmer’s actions. Yet the feeling she felt was not that of mutual understanding, nor was it a reciprocal affection between two equals. 

In her mind, Alize was a bottle of water in the middle of a desert. A sweet treat lost within a dark forest. She was wary of such kindness… 

And yet on certain days, her resistance would slowly wither.

It was another day of working the Joja shift. The rain hadn’t stopped since sundown.

Claire stood at the edge of the bus stop shelter, arms crossed, looking at the bus that lacked a driver. 

Pam must have clocked out early after accidentally drinking her fill.

Of course.

She bit the inside of her cheek, debating whether to brave the storm on foot or sleep in the Joja breakroom again.

Alize: “Looks like you’re stuck.”

Claire turned to see the farmer behind her, dry beneath a wide umbrella, dress darkened at the hem from puddles.

Claire: “You followed me again today.”

Alize: “You were still here. I was worried.”

Claire: “Oh, cut the crap… you always worry. You wait for me, pay for things I don’t ask for. Now what? Offer me a room?”

Alize: “I am. And you can always choose to say no if you don’t want it.”

Claire hesitated. She was soaked through, exhausted, and cold. 

Claire: “I didn’t ask for your help.”

Alize: “No… but you always take it.”

There was no malice in her voice but there was something else. Something tight. Twisted in the way only kindness could be when it is done without a reward in return.

Alize held out the umbrella. 

Alize: “Come on. I’m not letting you freeze just to prove a point.”

Claire followed through with the plan.The walk to the farmhouse was silent; save for the rain and their footsteps. 

Yet Claire felt it. Alize’s eyes glancing over, as though she was waiting for something Claire hadn’t given.

By the time they reached the porch, the cold, desolate woman couldn’t hold it in anymore.

Claire: “I’m using you, aren’t I?”

Alize opened the door. Didn’t answer right away.

Alize: “I think you like that I’m here when no one else is.”

Claire’s voice trembled. 

Claire: “That’s not fair.”

Alize: “But it’s true. And truth be told… it excites me. To be relied on. To be used...""

Claire stepped inside, heart pounding, unsure whether she was more afraid of being alone, or of not being.",0,1748578923.0,StardewValleyExpanded,0,0.33,False

I just recently moved to the west end of Toronto and I’m hoping to meet some new people to hang out with. I’m in my late 20s (open to connecting with anyone around that age range), and I’d love to find some friends who are down for:

Running or biking around the city or by the lake

Picnics or chilling in parks (High Park, Trinity Bellwoods, etc.)

Casual dinners, coffee walks, or checking out cool local spots

Just good vibes and chill convos

I’m pretty easygoing, love the outdoors, and always down to try new things or explore new areas in the city. If you’re also looking to expand your social circle or just want a running buddy, feel free to DM or comment!

Cheers!

I’m not here for dry “hey” chats or surface-level talk. I want something real—where the conversation flows naturally, feels easy, and we actually enjoy getting to know each other.

I’m 19, into a bit of everything. I love old movies (The Good, The Bad and The Ugly is a favorite), emotional story-based games, writing poems when life feels too loud, learning languages (Japanese & German right now), and diving into new cultures.

Not into the party scene. I like peaceful mornings, solo travel, coffee, and watching the sunrise somewhere quiet.

I run a small marketing agency, work remotely with a US company, and help manage a school for kids from tough backgrounds. Life’s busy, but meaningful.

I’m looking for someone I can talk to about anything—funny stuff, deep stuff, weird thoughts, random voice notes, or music that just hits different.

If that sounds like your vibe, say hi and tell me your age.

> Please note: I’m only looking to connect with straight people who are respectful and serious about genuine conversation.
I'm not interested in LGBTQ chats or guys asking for weird or inappropriate things—please don’t waste your time or mine. Respect is a must here.",2,1748578713.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,1.0,False
