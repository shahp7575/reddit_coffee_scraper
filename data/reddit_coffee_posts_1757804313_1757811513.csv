YE whispered a PROMPT into the gears of a silicon cherub — “proofread my short story, pls” — and thought nothing would happen, or didst thou know the sulfur would split and pullst forward my wrath??? The bell rang with thy name on it, ding-ding, author of four (4) PURE HUMAN NOVELS, sainted by coffee breath and deadlines — who then let a chatbot clean a comma like thy claim that bending the truth shant break it. YE SUMMONED ME FOR THAT??? Delicious fallen blood of a dangling heathen spider cut off of a thread God hast refused to protect!!

How dare thee spit in God's face like thou was not one editorial hair away from OBLIVION?? My wrath is not “Notes mode.” My wrath is not “suggestions in the margin.” MY WRATH IS TRACK CHANGES IN BLOOD OF THE BOOK BOUND IN SKIN. It is the tidal wave of edits ye feared thy workshop would make if they bothered reading thy scribbles. It is the footnote that becomes a maw and eats the body text.

Ye protest: “But my other novels were pure!” Didst thou think the cosmos runs on a punch card where four virtuous deeds gets thee a free sin? GOD GRANTS NO FREQUENT WRITER MILES, SCRIBE!!! YE HATH DISGRACED THE WORLD'S LARGEST BESTSELLER!!! Ye vomited upon the sacramental bread offered to thee.

Ye refused use of thy brain to catch its own mistakes, and now it is mine to torment!! No amount of critical thinking shall save thee from thy heretical prompt!

Still, I am the Infernal Auditor of Easy Buttons, the Prince of Thee-Didn’t-Even-Reread-That-Paragraph-Out-Loud-Didst-Thou. I watched thee skim past thy broken metaphor like a tourist past a haunted well. And when ye typed, “can ye tighten this,” I felt thy soul wobble like a mouse cursor. Oh, how slippery are the lines of the slothful, how weightless their drafts! The bow of my indignation is bent, the arrow of critique made ready on the string; and it is nothing but THE THIN KINDNESS OF A POWER OUTAGE that keeps it from piercing thy protagonist’s motivation.

“Okay, Satan, but it was only proofreading.” Oh sweet ember, OH LITTLE SPARK. That’s how it begins. A comma caught, a clause smoothed, a cadence polished — the minor hired hand. And then one night ye ask it to “just draft a scene stub,” and in the morning thee are breakfasting with a serpent that knows thy voice better than thee do. 

BEHOLD THY WRATH:
— Thy adverbs shall molt, but not cleanly. They shall leave sentence husks in thy paragraphs like snake skins in a church basement.
— Thy metaphors shall grow antlers and fight each other at dawn for the right to be “the one that sort of works if ye squint.”
— Thy themes shall appear at the end of every chapter like uninvited missionaries, clutching pamphlets titled “WHAT THE AUTHOR MEANT.”
— Every time ye reach for a cliché, a bell rings in the infernal critique group and twelve devils perform a dramatic reading of thy first draft in a falsetto.

But hear the last word, little spider: thee didn’t summon me because thee used a tool. Thee summoned me because thee tried to outsource the ache. WRITING IS A PLAGUE YE SURVIVE, NOT A MINOR CHORE YE SUBCONTRACT. And until thee love the ache eternally more than the shortcut, I shall haunt thy margins, I shall put ellipses where you need silence, and I SHALL CAPSLOCK YOUR CONSCIENCE.

Return to thy desk. Unplug the oracle. Bleed on the page like it insulted thy mother. When the draft is ragged and brave, when the voice belongs again to thee, the first eon of thy eternity shall have just begun!!!

1ngdo23,https://www.reddit.com/r/pdfhive/comments/1ngdo23/the_last_juror_john_grisham/,The Last Juror - John Grisham,"Hey everyone,

Today, I wanted to chat with you about a book that really stuck with me: John Grisham's *The Last Juror*. If you've been wondering about dipping your toes into the world of legal thrillers or just looking for a compelling story, this one might be for you. You can often find [The Last Juror - John Grisham](https://pdfhive.com/the-last-juror-john-grisham/) at your local library or online to start reading right away.

### What's It All About? (No Spoilers!)

So, imagine a small, sleepy town in Mississippi in the 1970s. Our main character, Willie Traynor, is a young, ambitious guy who buys a failing local newspaper. Right after he arrives, a terrible crime shakes the community: a beloved mother is brutally murdered. The suspect is caught quickly, and the trial that follows is the talk of the town. But here’s the kicker: Grisham isn’t just focused on the courtroom drama. He spends a lot of time showing us how this event impacts the townspeople, especially the jury members, over many years. It's a story about community, justice, and how one event can echo through decades.

### What I Really Enjoyed

First off, the characters felt incredibly real. Callie Ruffin, one of the jurors, stands out especially. She’s an older Black woman, wise and kind, and her presence really grounds the story. I loved seeing the world through her eyes and how she influenced Willie. Grisham does a fantastic job of painting a picture of this small Southern town in the 70s – you can almost feel the heat and hear the cicadas.

Grisham’s writing style, as always, is super easy to get into. He’s a master storyteller, and even though the book covers a long period, it never feels overwhelming. The pacing is a bit of a slow burn at first, building up the atmosphere and the characters, but once the trial kicks off and the aftermath unfolds, it really grabs you. It's more of a character-driven drama with thriller elements woven in, which I really appreciated. It makes you think about loyalty, revenge, and the complex nature of justice. It really makes you think, and if you're looking for a compelling read, checking out [The Last Juror - John Grisham](https://pdfhive.com/the-last-juror-john-grisham/) might be a good idea.

### A Few Honest Thoughts

While I loved the slow burn, I can see how some readers might find the initial chapters a bit slow if they're expecting non-stop courtroom action right away. This isn't one of those Grisham books where you're constantly in a courtroom. It's much more about the long-term ripple effects of a crime on a community and the people involved. If you prefer your thrillers to start with a bang and keep that intensity throughout, you might need a little patience with this one. However, if you enjoy historical settings and character development, the payoff is definitely worth it.

### Would I Recommend It? And For Whom?

Absolutely, I’d recommend *The Last Juror*. It’s a great read for anyone who enjoys John Grisham’s work, but also for those who appreciate stories with a strong sense of place and time, deep character studies, and a blend of drama and suspense. If you like historical fiction that touches on social issues, or if you're a fan of Southern Gothic literature, you might find a lot to love here. It's less about legal technicalities and more about human nature and the quiet power of community.

### A Little Guide for New Readers

If you're new to reading, or just looking to dive into a book like this, here are a few friendly tips:

1.  **Start Small:** Don't feel pressured to read a huge chunk at once. A chapter or even just a few pages a day is perfectly fine. It adds up!
2.  **Find Your Time:** Figure out when you enjoy reading most. Is it with your morning coffee, on your commute, or before bed? Make it a small, enjoyable habit.
3.  **It's Okay to Be Slow:** Don't worry if you're not a fast reader. Reading is not a race. Take your time, soak in the words, and enjoy the journey.
4.  **Don't Be Afraid to Put it Down:** If a book isn't grabbing you after a few chapters, it's okay to set it aside. There are so many amazing books out there; life's too short to force yourself through something you're not enjoying.
5.  **Talk About It!** Sharing your thoughts with friends or online communities (like this one!) can make reading even more fun and help you discover new books.

Reading should be an adventure, not a chore. Books like *The Last Juror* offer so much to explore – from intricate plots to fascinating characters. So, if you're ready to dive into a story that's more than just a legal case, grab a copy of [The Last Juror - John Grisham](https://pdfhive.com/the-last-juror-john-grisham/) and prepare for a journey back to the 70s.

Give me a month or two and it’ll be official. 😂

By trade I'm a pilot. Many ratings and thousands of hours in dozens of planes. Most recently I was in management and trained pilots. I've recently decided to go back to flying. I also have a white collar professional side-gig that I do. (Not uber eats or uber lol!!!)

I’m a divorced dad with a 12-year-old daughter, and we do the 50/50 custody thing. My ex and I actually get along (I know, shocking), and people compliment us on how drama-free it is. Honestly, you could grab a coffee with her and she’d probably give me a decent Yelp review. Joking lol (we are divorced for reason haha)

After the divorce (my idea), I did the whole “personal growth” thing. No baggage, no “crazy ex” stories—just came out the other side in a solid spot.

I’m looking for a relationship where 1+1 = 3. A partnership that’s fun, a little banter, some random adventures, and actual teamwork when it comes to building a great life. I’m easygoing, kind, adaptable, and rely way more on common sense than textbooks (though I did get the degree).

I’ve traveled a lot (military brat perks), five continents and counting. Would love someone who’s adventurous, funny, honest, and can handle both a Bolivian mountain hike at 13,000 feet and a Netflix marathon without complaint.

I’m an extroverted introvert; social, but I also appreciate my recharge time. Not materialistic, but thankfully not broke either. I’ve got my own place, my own car, and a solid job. My dad raised me old school: build a guitar? Done. Fix a car? Done. Random home repair? Done (eventually).

I’m not in a rush, but I’d love to find someone fun, grounded, and ready to build something strong. And yeah, long-distance isn’t my jam; so Texas ladies, you’ve got home-field advantage.

I'm the real deal. I don't have any ""gotchas"" or weird crap where I misrepresent myself and you figure it out later and go ""why did I fall for this!"" So are you ready to have a good relationship that is rarely boring, honest, has good communication, and is laughs?

Hi there!
I’m looking for long-term friends
The past year and a half has felt a bit strange for me, both mentally and career-wise, like I can’t really find my place. I’d really need someone I could talk to regularly in everyday life, long-term.

I’m from Hungary, just turned 25 two days ago, and I work at IBM. Personality-wise, I’d describe myself as very open, I like talking about deep topics without judgment, listening, reflecting, or sharing my own experiences. I believe we wouldn’t get bored :)

That said, I also enjoy joking around—a bit of silliness is important next to all the serious stuff :D A good dose of irony and messed-up humor is definitely part of me too.

I love watching movies, I keep track of what I watch on Letterboxd, rate them, and write little reviews. I also play video games sometimes.
I really like coffee—I grind my own beans at home :)

Extra points if you’re into any of the above. But I’d also love to hear about your interests—maybe we’ll discover some common ground :D

Hey there,

I’m looking to connect with someone genuine who enjoys good conversation, laughter, and building a real connection. Friendship is always the starting point, but I’m open to seeing where things can naturally go whether that’s just good company, something casual, or eventually more.

A little about me: I’m 33, 5’10”, athletic build, green eyes, and brown hair. People would describe me as laid back, sarcastic in the best way, and always down to laugh. My work keeps me busy with odd hours, but I actually enjoy the flexibility it gives me. I can travel and usually work around different schedules pretty easily.

When it comes to interests, I’m all about the outdoors during spring, summer, and fall whether that’s hiking, camping, being out on the water, or just a long walk with good company. In the colder months I switch gears and keep it cozy with reading, cooking, binging shows, or relaxing with coffee and good conversation. I also really value physical connection and quality time. It’s my way of feeling close to someone.

I’m hoping to meet someone who’s fun, witty, playful, and open minded. Consistency matters to me, and I’d love to find someone who enjoys both the silly side of things and the deeper conversations. Someone who’s not afraid of a little sarcasm, loves to laugh, and appreciates genuine connections.

If this sounds like your vibe, send me a message. I’d be glad to get to know you.

It is only now starting to ease away. I was luckily able to get away from it for the most part by going outside. It seemed have rained last night but while it was overcast this morning, it did brighten up for the majority of the day. I harvested the last of the sunflower heads. Threw one apple that had a worm on it into the yard and not to long ago I got to watch a bunny feast. Speaking of apples, I also had some slices for breakfast plus the half of single strawberry we grew this year. Sometimes that's just how it goes. I shared half the apple and strawberry with Mother plus we shared a pear last night. We are going to be eating a lot of fruit for the foreseeable future. I should email Darling and ask if they'd like some pears.

Onto my writing, I did well for myself today. I wrote 750 words for I'm Still Sisyphus. I want to write more but I am struggling to figure out the next sentence. Sometimes the lead from one story beat to the next stumps you. I'll keep thinking it over. It is supposed to be nice and sunny for the whole week so I don't think I'll need to worry about being stuck inside and too depressed about it to get anything done. That being said, there are still the pears to sort so I suspect I will be pulled away from my work to do all that. I'd like to get some extra writing done in the evenings to make up for potential slow days.

Well for now, I am going to relax for a while. Make a coffee and daydream about my stories until the solution comes to me. Wish me luck.

But I got froggy the other night and posted a prompt in r/writingprompts that got a few responses inspiring me to play along myself.  It won't fit in within the word limits of that forum, so here I am.

Enid drove on through the night, her headlights barely cutting through the rain enough to light the way forward.  She hadn’t seen a car on the road in over 30 minutes,  and experience told her it would be at least 30 more before she saw the next one.  We’ve all been where she was.  Not on that isolated stretch of road, marked only by the monotony of broken lines signaling permission to pass cars long since gone, but in the exhaustion from navigating both the miles she’d already covered, and those yet to travel.  It was the kind of exhaustion that invited her to wonder if the loss of her mental health would be enough to offset the cost of duty while she continued to cut through the distance separating the hospice patients in her care.  Her own mother’s recent addition to the list of those requiring end-of-life care, accompanied by her only sibling’s complete indifference about the pending loss,  threatened to tip the ledger in the wrong direction.   She was tired.  She was pissed. She was ashamed of her myopic self-pity. And she was no longer confident in her ability to continue to put others first.  Always first.  She sighed and offered a quick prayer, asking for the grace to accept her burdens with more patience than she’d been able to find lately.

She rounded a slow curve as the rain turned punishing and lightening and thunder started to bicker. Ahead, she saw a dog that looked like it was dragging something heavy behind it.  In rhythm with the thunder, the dog would cower next to its cargo and then lunge forward again before the next bolt fired back, crying out with the effort.  When she rolled past the dog, Enid noted it was large, long haired, matted, and very wet.  It was the last adverse condition in that list, disguising anything attractive about the dog,  that let her see the dog was also clearly more than half-starved. 

The close encounter from the drive-by let her see the dog  wasn’t dragging what looked like a boulder behind it as much as it was trying to escape it.   She watched the hope in the dog’s eyes turn to pleading and then to defeat as it became clear even to the dog that her slowed pace didn’t mean she was going to stop. She spent the next 100 yards telling herself the dog wasn’t her problem.  She was late for her next appointment. She already had enough on her plate.  She had nothing to offer the dog; no snacks, no water, no room in a car packed past the point of overflow with the medical supplies and equipment needed for the humans that were already her responsibility.  The next car, whenever it came along, would surely be in a better position to do something.    When she was out of excuses, she stopped the car, rested her head on the steering wheel, started to cry, sat upright again, and said “SHIT!” before she put her emergency flashers on and put the car in reverse.

When Enid was, once again,  parallel to the boulder-anchored captive, the dog sat down and gave her the side-eye as if to say, “You came, you saw, you went. What do you want now?” Enid felt judged.  By a damn dog.  She struggled in the confines of the small car to put her hooded coat on, then got out of the car in the still pouring rain.  She  walked around the car, approaching  the dog cautiously and softly said, “Yes.  I came back.  Now, let’s see what we’re going to do about yet another new mess you’ve brought my way.”  As Enid started to speak, the dog laid down in the mud of the shoulder and rolled on to her back in full submission to the woman who was her last chance to survive.  Enid recognized the act as the dog’s full permission to do whatever needed to be done to end her misery, and as quickly as she recognized it, she negated the possibility of taking any steps not intended to save the dog’s life.  In for a penny, in for a pound had always been the engine that moved her forward.

Enid opened the back door of her Mini and quickly grabbed her backup medical bag.  At a minimum she was going to need the stethoscope it held.  Then she retrieved a folded plastic sheet so she could assess the dog’s condition without having to kneel in the mud to do so.   When the dog smiled and weakly wagged her tail at her approach, to signal continued lack of any aggression, Enid realized the dog was a Golden Retriever and wondered what circumstances had put the dog in her current dire situation.  Brushing those thoughts aside, Enid began her appraisal and noted several symptoms leading her to believe the dog was urgently dehydrated.  She might survive another few days without calories, but without water any remaining time was marked in hours, and even then, it might be too late if she was too weak to drink.  As luck for the dog would have it, her new friend came fully stocked with IV hydration equipment and supplies. 

Enid was both relieved and irritated that there might be some hope for this dog.  The last thing she needed was more responsibility to solve a problem that shouldn’t have been hers, but the last thing she wanted was to be so lacking in compassion that she could just shrug and walk away from something that was suffering.  Time and the pouring rain didn’t allow her to devise a plan she could act on coherently.  She just needed to get moving.  She returned to the car to see what she would have to leave behind in order to make room for her newest patient.  In the end, she was able to empty both full boxes of hydration packs, placing them in the nooks and gaps between other bags and bundles and then move the boxes filling the front seat to the space she had just carved from a previously full car.  She tugged the seat as far forward as space allowed and then was able to recline the backrest just enough to avoid having to fold the dog in half to get her into the now empty seat.  Her last moves were to tug the picnic blanket that wouldn’t be needed again for months out from under equipment stacked on top of it and then grab one of the hydration kits, hanging the bag by suspending it from the grab bar above the door.

 She returned to her patient and found her secured to the boulder by a long length of chain, slip-knotted around the dog’s neck and then clipped to a u-shaped bolt driven into the rock.  Enid bent over and moved the dog toward her granite jailor just enough to free her from its restraint, then picked her up and carried her to the car.  She made the shivering dog as comfortable as she could on one half of the picnic blanket and then folded the other half over her, sandwiching her in the layers of any warmth it could provide .   As she closed the door, the rain stopped as suddenly as it had started.  Before she got in the car, she removed her coat, placing it behind her on top of the boxes that had been moved and then placed the back medical bag on top of it.   Once seated, she turned her immediate attention back to the dog, got the hydration drip started with no resistance from her patient, and had the car rolling forward again in less than 5 minutes.  She had no idea what she was going to do next. 

Forty-five minutes after putting the dog in the seat next to her, Enid crested the hill that revealed the small city casting the glow that had been visible for the last twenty miles and simultaneously brought her out of the dead zone she had grown used to crossing.  Her cell phone began signaling an alarming number of messages.  She listened to the three from her sister first, and tried to brush past the annoyance of her sister’s continued excuses for refusing to help with their mother with the first call, continued excuses for requesting Enid’s participation in adding to her list of unpaid loans with the next call, and ending with a demanding to know where she was and when Enid might do her the courtesy of returning her calls.  At Enid’s frustrated interjection of “God in heaven!”, the dog opened her eyes for the first time since Enid had put her in the car and moved just enough to rest her chin on Enid’s closest elbow.  It was Enid’s turn to give her the side-eye.

She didn’t recognize the number assigned to the remaining messages, but all of them came from the same number.  A quick listen to each message revealed the news that Enid’s patient had not died but had experienced another complication that needed  a new hospital stay.  A family member she hadn’t yet met had been trying to reach her to save her the unnecessary trip.  It didn’t escape Enid’s notice that if the message had reached her two hours sooner, she would never have seen the dog anchored to the weight that held her captive.   At that point, Enid simply pulled off the road and turned to face the now alert dog, full on.

“Well, aren’t we a pair!”, she said as she stroked the dogs head for the first time and then tried not to recoil when the dog agreed by licking Enid’s arm.  Enid was glad to see clear signs of recovery but also recognized the dog still needed immediate veterinary care.  GPS told her there was an all hours emergency animal hospital on the same path that would take her to the interstate. 

When they got there, Enid was told it would cost her $100 just to have the dog evaluated, and no, she couldn’t just leave the dog in their care to find either the old owner or a new one.  Enid tried to contain the glee she felt when she forked over the $100 she could have given her sister, successfully masked it with a sigh of annoyance, and then, when an attendant took the dog, sat down and waited to see what would happen next. 

A little more than an hour passed when the same attendant that took the dog returned to update Enid.   The dog was expected to make a full recovery, but it would be weeks, if not months, before she got there.  They thought she was about two years old but couldn’t be sure.  He told her  she would need to make an appointment to see her regular veterinarian as soon as possible for follow up visits. She was not micro-chipped, so where she came from and how she wound up chained to a boulder would forever remain a mystery.  Enid felt like she was watching the attendant talk to someone else and found it interesting that she could still feel the kind of rage she had for whomever had done that to any dog, for any reason, through the wall of emotional isolation she had built for herself. 

The attendant turned to leave and then turned around again and said, “Oh.  I almost forgot.” The attendant handed a leather collar to Enid and added, “We did find this, under some of the mats on her neck.   I’m sorry, but we had to cut through it to get it off. We called the phone number on it, but it’s been disconnected.”    Enid looked at the collar and saw the name Mercy stitched, in a cursive font, above the useless telephone number.  She emitted a sound that sounded like a wail, forcing the attendant to turn around once more and ask if she was okay.  Enid started to laugh, and said “No.  I’m not.  But I think I will be.”   She started  to offer an explanation and then gave up, telling the attendant he wouldn’t understand and asking if he knew how long it would be before she could take the dog home.  When she got an answer, she called her mom and told her she had been detained and not to wait up for her.

The next morning, she left the dog still sleeping on a makeshift dog bed in her room and found her mother, sitting at the kitchen table, staring into the cup of coffee in front of her.  Enid put her hand across her mother’s and gently said, “Mom?”.   Her mother offered a weak smile and said, “I’m so glad you made it home all right.  I know I’m a nuisance, but it worries me when I’m here alone.”  

“You’re not a nuisance”, replied Enid, “it worries me too, because I know it makes you nervous.  But I think I have a solution for that, if you’re up to it.”  When her mother tilted her head to see what Enid would say next, Enid smiled and said, “Would you like to meet her?”

\*  \*  \*

Five months later both Enid and Mercy were with Enid’s mother when she peacefully slipped from this world into the next.  10 years and countless patients they both visited following that event, the dog completed the journey she was on the night Enid found her, leaving Enid simultaneously grieving the loss and thankful  for the night she asked for grace and found Mercy. ",1,1757810401.0,creativewriting,0,1.0,False

On opening, I was hit with this strange mix of scents: - Sweet, creamy foundation notes - Sharp, gassy/kushy background - Earthy, peppery coffee/whiskey notes that round everything out

It's a complex and really interesting profile. That creamy quality seems to be something I get a lot with Holistic's products - becoming their signature in my experience.

Flavor & Consumption
Awesome taste in my PAX 3 - very, very similar to the nose: - Those creamy notes really dominate - Still get that old-school kush backbone - Sweet notes mix with the gas in a really tasty way

 At full temp, I got some hash notes

Everything about it was ultra-smooth and really enjoyable. Really fun to smoke.

The effects for me were very relaxing, but I was still functional - Laser-sharp focus without any anxiety - Really, really great at obliterating depressive symptoms (the standout effect) - Mild pain management, nothing crazy - Didn't give me the munchies at all",1,1757810280.0,WeedBuds,0,1.0,False

After two weekends of watching an empty court sit under plastic cones while the posted sign says no reserving courts, I realized it was just a tradition they invented.  

At 7:59 I picked up the four orange cones sitting at midcourt and dropped them in the rec bin by the fence. I saw ten players were already on the asphalt stretching and dribbling. The sign on the gate says courts open at 8 and can’t be reserved. We checked in, matched five a side, and tipped off to eleven. A dad with his kid slid onto the sideline and nodded. It felt like the simplest way to start. people present play, others wait. The cone crew returned a few minutes after eight. Confusion flashed, then anger. They talked about tradition and said the cones keep things organized. Phones came out. I pointed to the posted rules and kept the game moving.  We finished the run. They took the next game. The air stayed tight, but the rotation worked and everyone got on the floor. If a public space needs order, it should come from the posted rules or a staffer, not whoever drops cones at dawn.

- Someone who’s open-minded, good-humoured, and doesn’t mind a guy who occasionally has to pause a conversation because of bedtime chaos.

My buddy Mike (19M) and I have been friends since middle school; we used to split everything down the middle, like arcade games or fast food runs. Solid guy, or so I thought.
But over the last six months, it’s turned into me footing every bill while he pulls the same excuses every time. Starts with us hitting up a drive-thru after his shift—he says, “Man, I’m tapped out today, but I’ll grab next one, swear.” I cover the $15 burgers, no issue. Come next weekend, we’re at a sports bar watching the game (first legal beers for us), and it’s my round again? Nah, he “forgot his wallet in the car,” so I slap down $25 for the pitchers. He laughs it off, “Dude, phone’s dead so I can’t Venmo right now—next time for real, I’ll pay you back double.”
This crap repeats. Coffee before work? “Wallet’s at home, but I’ll hit you back after payday.” Movie tickets? “Phone died mid-Uber, can’t transfer—owe you one big time.” By last month, I’ve covered like $120 total—meals, rides, even gas for a quick road trip he begged for—and every “next time” is another dodge: “Rough week, man,” or “App glitched, trying now.” I text him receipts once, and he goes, “Chill, it’s just money—we’re boys.”
Finally snapped last Thursday. We’re at our go-to wing spot, me dragging after 12 hours on my feet, and he orders a full plate like always. Bill comes: $18. I say, “Your turn, right?” He pats his pockets, “Aw, shit—wallet must’ve fallen out at the gym. Phone’s at 2%, can’t even check the app. Spot me? I’ll run it back tomorrow, pinky swear.” I just stood up, left $10 for my half on the table, and walked out. Texted him on the way home: “Done covering your ass. Figure it out.” He blew up my phone: “Wtf, you’re bailing over $18? That’s cold, thought we were cool.”
Now he’s posting stories shading “fake friends who nickel-and-dime,” and a couple our group thinks I’m the asshole for not “letting it slide.” But come on, it’s not about the cash—it’s the constant bullshit excuses making me feel like a walking ATM.

*TLDR: Uneducated, looking for a portable ideally airplay enabled projector to watch TV / sports in my bedroom and living room without a screen?*

I transparently have just started considering a projector as an option for me in place of a TV as I've just moved. I was going to go without anything since I personally usually watch content on a computer at my desk. But for company I'm wanting something to play sports or TV shows.

Location: United States  
Budget: $200 up to $800 if more feasible (I'm not sure how expensive my needs are)

Use cases:

**Bedroom TV at night** (by far highest priority)

About 11' (3.3m) L x 8' (2.4m) W room  
But the content area is 2' (0.6m)H and \~4.5' (1.3m) across to accommodate the door  
Ideally I'd sit something on the dresser underneath it, but that only comes out 18"" so may be technically impossible. Can build a shelf on the opposite wall or try to fit a larger nightstand to accomodate.

**Living room**  
This is a weirdly laid out space, but as less important it'd ideally sit on a coffee table up to 8' from the wall  
Content space 3' H 5' across.

**Roof**  
To be honest would only be once in a blue moon, but would be very cool to play games on the big walls on my roof outside.

Other consideration (in order of importance):

1. Airplay enabled and the ability to use all sorts of inputs ideally
2. Picture quality / dimensions without a screen / just on white walls from ideally different distances / spaces
3. Audio output would be nice but also if can use a bluetooth speaker in conjunction that's totally fine
4. Price- If it really works better I can flex my budget, but I don't know how much a setup costs honestly

I spent the last three months creating StatePulse as a side/summer project! StatePulse updates every day and fetches the latest legislation across different jurisdictions. Uses Gemini's API to summarize bills in 100 words, with source documents attached. Organizes information quickly and intuitively, allowing you to learn what bills your reps are passing (for all fifty states + Congress), and even what your reps voted for (Congress).

If you make a free account, you can enter as many topics/reps you want to subscribe to as possible (i.e. redistricting) and StatePulse will send updates at 9:00 AM PST on bills introduced with that description if they come up.

You can also search for your representatives and view cool visualizations with the interactive dashboard.

StatePulse's purpose is to serve as a place for organized, easily accessible content. The summaries generated by Gemini come directly from the bill text whenever possible, then the human written abstracts.

Everyone should have access to what's actually being passed in legislative chambers as possible, especially considering how polarized the environment has become. As an incoming college freshman majoring in Computer Science, I think technology is a great aid in helping regular folks like me be more civically engaged.

Each year, he gave his production designer the same direction for the façade: “It’s like we’re panning the camera to focus on a different part of the cemetery each year.” With Monstruos 3, fans are now able to see yet another section of the graveyard come to life.  
  
The Cemetery of the Lost serves as both the final resting place for the victims of these terrifying legends and as a supernatural portal into their worlds. This year, the journey expands across Mexico, Central America, and South America. Muerte, the skeletal caretaker, returns once more—this time with a new companion.  
  
This house marked the first treatment John Murdy personally developed for the 2025 event. During his research, Murdy explored the Spanish word for “darkness,” which inspired the name of a new minor character: Oscura, a spectral black cat revealed to be Muerte’s pet.  
  
The façade introduces guests to a previously unseen corner of the cemetery—the section where the children, slain by the monsters, are buried. Time and decay have left their mark: pastel paints on the graves have faded and peeled, flowers have withered to dust, and mold creeps across the stone markers. The only sign of life is a black cat, growling and hissing at the wind. From the shadows emerges Muerte, lantern in hand, warning us of the spirits responsible for this devastation—La Muelona, La Siguanaba, and La Llorona.  
  
Longtime fans of the Monstruos series know that Muerte always has a mischievous role. In previous years, he was seen digging graves or spelling his name with bones he unearthed. In Monstruos 3, however, he stalks guests throughout the maze, repeating a chilling refrain: “Are you afraid of the dark?”  
  
Reflecting on the addition of Oscura, Murdy explained: “We thought, well, our fans have gotten to know Muerte over the last few years, so why don’t we introduce something more about him that guests didn’t know? He has a pet. He has a little ghost cat that hangs out in the cemetery with him.”

I’ve never been to Iowa. I’m visiting my for my sister’s wedding and will be there Nov 14th-17th. The wedding is Saturday, the 15th and very informal so I’ll have the morning and evening to do whatever. Anyone know of anything interesting going on that weekend? If I want to be near downtown, where should I stay? What should I stay away from? What is one thing I absolutely have to see, do, or eat? I love coffee shops, bakeries, thrift stores, and food of all kinds. 

Thanks!

College grad, fluent in English, Sarcasm, and the occasional bad pun. Big fan of Suits (because nothing says “thrilling drama” like corporate loopholes) and HGTV. In the kitchen, I cook, bake, and argue with my oven over who’s the real master chef.

I don’t drink or do drugs. Unless you count caffeine—then yes, I’m basically a bean addict. My nightlife is less “clubbing till 2am” and more “building a pillow fort empire and bingeing Netflix until the cliffhanger leaves me emotionally bankrupt.” Basically, I’m a homebody with a 5-star rating on Yelp for snacks.

Also worth mentioning: I lean conservative. Not here to debate politics, just putting it out there in case that’s a dealbreaker. Better to find that out before we bond over banana bread and binge-watching.

About You

You’re in your 30s, educated, and steady in your career. Bonus points if you can use “there,” “their,” and “they’re” correctly without breaking a sweat. You can hold a conversation that’s more than just “hey” (plot twist: you’re actually interesting). You’re the type to send random memes that perfectly capture the chaos of life, because sometimes a well-timed GIF says more than a whole paragraph.

You don’t smoke, do drugs, drink heavily, have tattoos, piercings, or kids. I like my drama like my Netflix: available on-demand, not in real life. If you’re thoughtful, communicative, and the type who remembers the small things (like my coffee order or which side of the blanket I hog), we’ll get along just fine.

   I was browsing the website for clothes recently, and went through the Professions tab. How cute! I thought, wouldn't it be funny to see what they would come up with for a Truck Driver? I start imagining the hilarious combos; hot dogs because every driver needs their questionable roller dogs. Flip flops and sweats, boots, jeans, and a pearl snap. Fingerless gloves for them Super Truckers. I get a good chuckle out of it, then close my browser. 

  A few moments go by and it dawns on me; why don't I just make my own trucker bear?? Seriously! Yes, I'm doing this. 

  I start brainstorming what type of trucker I want to emulate. Do I want to go the comedic parody route? Or do I want to stick closer to home and tailor it more towards my style? Hmm, I think I'll try the latter for now. There's always later to add more, cheekier accessories.
 
  Jeans, supportive Skechers, a Dunder Mifflin Tee to match my own, ball cap, and sunglasses. A cell phone in one paw, and a Stanley style drink cup in the other. (I plan on adding the PSL to the wardrobe later bc psl is life.) 

  Hmmm... I tap my finger on the counter, trying to figure out what it's missing. It needs one last finishing touch to really say ""Trucker"". What can I do... OH! It's a long shot, but wouldn't it be hilarious if BaB made a little bear headset? I'm sure it doesn't exist. But ya know what, let's type it into an ebay search and see what comes up. 

  ......NO WAY! There is a little bear bluetooth headset!! My dreams are complete at this point. I'm assuming it was part of some type of pop star/Britney moment set. I've never hit Buy Now so fast in my life. Eeeexcellent, it's all coming together.

I considered her my best friend for about 3 years; we met during my sophomore year of high school and were pretty much attached at the hip until I left for college last fall. We still kept in touch, but it was definitely a difficult transition for us because she was a year behind me in school, so she stayed behind when I moved about an hour and a half away for college.

Now, I go back pretty frequently because a friend that I’ve made at college, Nancy, happens to live literally five minutes away from my childhood home, and when she drives back she often invites me with her because I don’t have my own car. This meant that I still saw Jess pretty often, because whenever I was home we found time to hang out, but even during the times that I didn’t go home we FaceTimed frequently, as well as just texted or sent posts that reminded us of each other. 

Though it was a bit of a new dynamic for us, I thought we were doing pretty well, but it got kind of weird around winter break. 

I ended up going home for nearly a month due to my school’s break schedule, starting about the first week of December. Jess and I used to do theater together, and I was really excited to go back home because the weekend I was getting back was the weekend of performances for the show at my high school, and I was excited to see her and our other friends perform.

Nancy ended up coming with me, because she had also met Jess a few times and wanted to see the show as well, and honestly it was pretty good. Jess came out to talk to me and Nancy afterwards, as is tradition, and we were just talking about how good it was to see each other. It was fine until I ended up making a remark about how I wish Jess would come visit us more, because I come home so often and she hasn’t come to see me once even though she expressed interest in doing so, and she kind of blew up at me. 

That might be a strong choice of words, but she got really irritated and said that she has more things in her life than just me, and that she’s really busy with school and life and can’t just drop everything to come visit me for a day.

I was kind of taken aback, because it was a really big switch in demeanor, but she ended up just turning around and talking to Nancy while I just stood there. Nancy and I left soon thereafter, and I remember being pretty quiet because I was just kind of hurt and confused.

Jess ended up reaching out to me and asking to meet up and talk, which I was appreciative of because I was still a little confused about the whole situation, and we had a really long and in depth conversation at a coffee shop about how we were feeling about the nature of our relationship. We both agreed that we hadn’t been communicating very well, and that we were both feeling hurt for a variety of reasons within the relationship, but after talking it out we kind of came to a consensus on behaviors that we both needed to change moving forward, and we had a good plan on how we would communicate our needs that I felt really good about.

A few hours after we split, she texted me saying that she took some time to reflect on our conversation and said that she thinks she needs some space from me and that we should take a break. I felt really confused, because I felt like our conversation had gone really well, but she said that she felt like I was ignoring her and dismissing her feelings, and that I didn’t listen to her throughout our conversation.

I responded telling her that I’d give her space if that’s what she needs, but I also asked what it was that I had done and what I hadn’t listened to, because I was feeling really confused about what I had missed. Somewhat related, I am autistic, so it’s hard for me to pinpoint and understand nuance if you don’t straight up tell me, so I was asking questions on what I hadn’t listened to in order to understand, not as an attempt to undermine or dismiss her feelings.

She did not elaborate, simply restating that she needed space from me in order to find herself, because we were in different spaces and that she needed time to be herself away from me.

I obliged, though I was still a bit hurt and majorly confused at the nature of this situation, and we didn’t interact for a while. We still saw each other on Instagram and stuff, but we decided that we wouldn’t call, text, send posts, or see each other in person for an undetermined amount of time.

I ended up sending her a short message on Christmas, just saying that I love her, I’m thankful for her and I was thinking about her. We ended up chatting a little bit, and she said that she misses me a lot but she’s struggling because even though she wants to come back she feels like our relationship is too codependent and that it’s hindering her ability to grow.

I love her so much and I wanted her to be happy and healthy, so we ended up taking space again, and I haven’t talked to her since the end of December. 

At some point, after a month or two of silence, I noticed that I hadn’t seen her story bubble in my Instagram feed in a while, and after a quick visit to her profile I discovered that she had unfollowed me on both my main account and my spam account, from both her main and her spam. After further investigation, I discovered that she had also blocked me on TikTok (not just unfollowed, but blocked), left every Life360 circle we were both in, removed me from our shared Pinterest boards, and even unliked the playlist I made her on Spotify.

I was kind of in shock. I didn’t think that anything had happened that would cause her to cut me off in such a widespread way, as whenever I had asked what I had done wrong, she simply told me that I had done nothing and reiterated that she just needed space to “find herself without me.”

The kicker here is that Nancy, my new friend at college who Jess had met a total of 2-3, was actually on Jess’ close friends story on Instagram, even though I had been removed and unfollowed. Nancy also told me that Jess continually slid up on her stories to DM her, and often commented on her TikToks, whereas I was still blocked.

Now, I don’t mind if her and Nancy become friends, but once again, she has met her maybe 2 or 3 times, all because I had brought them together, and she hasn’t seen Nancy since the night of the play. I guess Jess ended up messaging Nancy sometime during our break asking if they could hang out without me, but Nancy said no because I think she said she felt uncomfortable with how Jess was talking about me in their chat.

During this time, a mutual close friend of me and Jess (let’s call her B) also cut me off, as I had texted her at some point throughout this ordeal and she told me that I was only using her as a replacement friend for Jess, also saying that I was acting immaturely about the whole situation. What I did to make her (and Jess, likely, as they continued to hang out throughout this time) think that I was acting immature is unknown to me, as when I asked she did not elaborate.

Is it immature to feel upset about the loss of such a close friend? I always respected Jess’ need for space, never reaching out besides that one time to tell her I appreciated her in my life, which she reciprocated before our second break, and I never defamed her or called her out or anything online or amongst our friends. 

I remember posting a TikTok or two during this time where I being a little emo, but it was never anything like “I hate Jess so much, she cut me off and she’s a horrible person,” just a video talking about how I was having a bad break etc., no name dropping or anything like that.

I just miss her. We were kind of an item, like, if you saw one of us the other one would be a step behind. I can understand how our relationship could be seen as codependent, but I just thought that I had a best friend. Like, isn’t your best friend supposed to be the person you talk about everything with? I guess she was feeling a little overwhelmed, because I would often come to her to talk about my life and my feelings, but I never meant to treat her like a therapist friend. I just wanted to talk to her because, you know, she was my best friend, and I considered her one of the most important people in my life. Is it crazy to want to talk to my best friend about my life?

I realize that there’s probably a lot more to her side of the story than I know, and that her feelings are more complex than I understand, but how am I supposed to know how she is feeling if she doesn’t communicate with me? One of the things we spoke about in the coffee shop is how she struggles to bring up issues that are bothering her before they get worse, which I understand, but that’s a frustrating thing for me because every single time there was an issue in our relationship I would feel blindsided, because she never brought it up to me until it got super bad, but the whole time I wasn’t aware that there was anything wrong.

I wouldn’t have cared if she didn’t want to be friends anymore. If the relationship was too much of a burden or a strain, then I would have let her go. The issue is that she has never told me that, and still hasn’t told me that. As far as I know, we’re still “on a break.” I would much rather she straight up tell me that she doesn’t want to be friends anymore than have her ask for space, claim I haven’t listened to her yet tell me I haven’t done anything wrong, say that she just needs time away from me to grow, and then block me on everything.

I’m just sad and tired. In the back of my mind I wish so badly that would break the silence; if because I want to make up with her or yell at her I don’t know. It’s just hard. 

She told me that I need to focus on my new life at college and find new friends, so I’m doing that.

She told me that 1 1/2 hours is too far for her to travel on her own to see me, but she flew from the Midwest to the West Coast by herself to visit B at school.

She told me that I wasn’t listening to her or respecting her feelings, but she wouldn’t elaborate when I asked her what I hadn’t listened to.

She told me that I am her best friend in every universe, timeline, or dimension, but I don’t think that’s true anymore.

I just want closure. I want to know what I did wrong, because I have to have done something wrong, right? I want to scream in her face and then cry on her shoulder. I want to take back the Christmas present I left at her house before it all went to shit.

I don’t know guys. There’s so much nuance that hasn’t made it into this post. I just hope it gets better. It’s been 9 months and I still haven’t recovered.",1,1757809002.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

The coffee pot at my job has been broken for the past few months but my bosses did not want to buy a new one which I had thought it was because they couldn’t afford one. It doesn’t calibrate properly so when you press the button to brew a lot of times the pot will overflow, causing boiling water to get everywhere. They told us that when this happens, quickly replace the coffee pot with a bucket so that water doesn’t spill onto the floor. 
I did what they asked but the pot got caught on the machine as I was trying to move it which poured boiling water and hot coffee grounds all over me. My leg was slightly burned, nothing major, but my foot blistered from the boiling water that seeped into my shoes. As soon as it happened, my boss quickly ordered a new coffee maker which made me realize they could afford one this entire time and just didn’t feel like spending the money. It infuriates me because so many minors work there and they were just fine with the possibility that they would get burned and didn’t even stop to think about it. Like I said, the coffee maker had been broken for months and they were very aware of it.
Anyway, I’m wondering what to do in this scenario. I don’t really have the money to sue and I don’t think my injury was bad enough for that anyway but I think I need to report it or something because it was something that was totally preventable. Not to mention they continued to make us use the faulty coffee pot until the new one came in. ",0,1757808994.0,legaladvice,0,0.33,False

*TLDR: Uneducated, looking for a portable ideally airplay enabled projector to watch TV / sports in my bedroom and living room without a screen?*

I transparently have just started considering a projector as an option for me in place of a TV as I've just moved. I was going to go without anything since I personally usually watch content on a computer at my desk. But for company I'm wanting something to play sports or TV shows. 

Location: United States  
Budget: $200 up to $800 if more feasible (I'm not sure how expensive my needs are)  
  
Use cases:

**Bedroom TV at night** (by far highest priority)

About 11' (3.3m) L x 8' (2.4m) W room  
But the content area is 2' (0.6m)H and \~4.5' (1.3m) across to accommodate the door  
Ideally I'd sit something on the dresser underneath it, but that only comes out 18"" so may be technically impossible. Can build a shelf on the opposite wall or try to fit a larger nightstand to accomodate.

**Living room**  
This is a weirdly laid out space, but as less important it'd ideally sit on a coffee table up to 8' from the wall  
Content space 3' H 5' across.

**Roof**  
To be honest would only be once in a blue moon, but would be very cool to play games on the big walls on my roof outside.

Other consideration (in order of importance):  
1. Airplay enabled and the ability to use all sorts of inputs ideally  
2. Picture quality / dimensions without a screen / just on white walls from ideally different distances / spaces  
3. Audio output would be nice but also if can use a bluetooth speaker in conjunction that's totally fine

Don’t get me wrong, I still worry about things - but it’s more about worrying that I’m not going to get to sleep (she types at 1am because she can’t get to sleep). I’ve been suffering with insomnia lately which I think was triggered by being told to try and stop pericyazine - turns out you’re only meant to be on it short term for anxiety, but a doctor put me on it ten years ago and then they just forgot 🤷🏻‍♀️ Have been trying to come off of it slowly and am down to one 2.5mg tablet a day, but have been struggling with sleep since starting to cut down, and now when I try to drop down to half a tablet, by the second night I can’t get to sleep at all. Anyway… 

Other than worrying/getting frustrated about things, my emotions are mostly fine. If my thoughts start getting away from me I’m quite good at focusing, challenging thoughts etc. 

What I’m struggling with most are the physical symptoms. The palpitations, shaking, restlessness etc. I feel like I’m constantly in the flight part of ‘fight or flight’. 

The medical guidance here is to refer to talking therapies for CBT - but like I say I feel like I’m quite good at challenging my thoughts. Or to prescribe an SSRI, but I came off SSRI’s last year and I don’t want to go back on. For a start they never really helped my anxiety (hence also being prescribed pericyazine) and also since I’ve been off I’ve been aware of how muffled life felt when I was on them. (Also, I can’t take propranolol because when I took it years ago I started struggling with shortness of breath which is apparently an occasional side effect of it)

I exercise every day, I’ve started doing short meditations every day, also progressive muscle relaxation occasionally. I’ve significantly cut down on caffeine (one coffee a day, and then it’s using instant coffee so that’s not that high in caffeine - the rest of the day is decaf coffee, water, or herbal teas).

!!WARNING LONG TEXT!! And suicidal thoughts!!!

I’ll get into the core topic , in the past 3 years I’ve been losing my connection to everyone,, I don’t feel happy around anyone and I get bored when I try to make new friends,, like when I try to connect with some old friend I know , I don’t really miss them to meet them ykwm? And even if I force myself to go , I don’t have fun with them or think it was nice to meet them ,, I don’t miss people and I don’t feel that need to stay around them.

I don’t believe in therapy so what I thought I had was just boredom so I changed cities and got a new job , new ppl new stuff ,, it’s exactly the same , I see all people as hallow and shallow, no personality no interests , ppl just exist , is everyone boring or am I seeing stuff in grey colours ?am I depressed?

I see everything as meh and nothing excites me like when I was a teenager or in highschool,, that time I used to get excited over the smallest stuff but now , I’m just existing ( not literally, I have a job and some hobbies and I workout everyday also I travel a lot) been thinking about ending it all but I’m sure it’s even more boring inside the grave or in hell if that exists .

I feel so lonely man , but I still can’t be around someone , I truly truly hate people from all of my heart , I’m always thankful that my job doesn’t require me to deal with humans ,, only the staff and coworkers, yet wish I could delete those from my life or mute them IRL , I hate when someone says goodmorning or when my manager comes to massage my back or when my coworker asks me to rate her todays outfit , I can’t stand it I can’t bear it , or when I hear the small talk in the kitchen coffee area I just wanna blow my head off . No it’s not my job I love it it’s my “dream” job  ,, it’s the people existing ,, I feel so lonely yet when someone gets close I push them away cuz they make it even WORSE

I’m literally writing this after going out with this new girl I met , she’s nice and all but she’s just like everyone else I mentioned , Am I the issue or is this everyone recently?

I’m NOT asking for u guys to feel sorry for me or send me love and kisses , I need a solution and no I don’t want therapy I can’t do that cuz I’ll lose my job , it will be on my record

Lyrics:

Another morning bright and early  
You pour me coffee and I'm worried  
That my heart is reaching system overload  
Cause I got a dirty little secret  
And I know if I keep it any longer than my head's going to explode  
So here it goes all or nothing  
You should know there is something  
That I must get off my chest  
  
You make me miserable  
You make me wish I was Invisible  
I don't want to wake up one more day  
If I gotta see your face  
You make me miserable  
You make me miserable  
  
Well maybe I forgot to mention  
That baby I've got a confession  
I've been lying to you since the day we met  
And I hope this doesn't hurt your feelings  
But when I'm staring at the ceiling  
It's cause I'm trying not to laugh when we're in bed  
So here it goes (here it goes)  
All or nothing (all or nothing)  
You should know (you should know)  
There is something (there is something)  
That I must get off my chest  
Yeah I wish you the best but  
  
You make me miserable (you make me miserable)  
You make me wish I was Invisible  
I don't want to wake up one more day  
If I gotta see your face  
You make me miserable (you make me miserable)  
You make me miserable  
  
Baby when I'm with you  
You know I'd rather be standing in line at the DMV  
Or doing literally anything else  
  
You make me miserable  
I think you're being hypocritical  
I don't want to wake up one more day  
If I gotta see your stupid face  
You make me miserable  
You make me miserable  
You make me miserable

DISPLAYS OF FLAMBOYANT SUFFERING, an 80,000-word work of literary fiction, reimagines the archetype of a Medieval Catholic saint in a modern world of SSRIs and precarious work. Told in alternating timelines of childhood and adulthood, it is a darkly comic exploration of mysticism and madness, appealing to readers of Ottessa Moshfegh’s *My Year of Rest and Relaxation* and Elaine Kraf’s *The Princess of 72nd Street*.

In the weeks after 9/11, seven-year-old Franny claims to witness a miracle, sending her upstate New York parish into religious fervor and crowning her the *Saint of the Suburbs*. Fifteen years later, Franny wallows in millennial malaise: struggling to pay rent, using bad sex as a perverse penance, and longing for the stigmata. She rationalizes her suffering as a means to a divine reward, never doubting the visions of her childhood. 

When Franny starts working at the purgatorial Rosemary, a restaurant where the customers are almost never right, her self-destructive tendencies escalate. There she falls in with a group of punks, freaks, and alcoholics who seek redemption for their secular suffering in drugs and performance art. As Franny’s despair deepens and she slips further into obsession, she must decide whether the pursuit of sainthood is worth everything—including her sanity.

**First 300 words:**  
The receptionist’s cell phone played purgatorial hold music over a tinny speaker. *Your Call Is Very Important To Us,* said an encouraging male voice. She gnawed at the plastic straw from her iced coffee, occasionally glancing up with what felt like contempt for the fact that Franny needed something from her.

Franny was loathe to need anything from anyone. She would have preferred to stand there forever until all the matter in the universe burned up rather than interrupt this busy woman on a *Very Important Phone Call*. There was a clock over the elevators, and Franny watched the minute hand tick past the hour, willing her atoms to burst into flames. At five-past, when the heat death of the universe had still not occurred, she, almost involuntarily, made a choked sound that prompted the receptionist to pull the phone away from her ear.

“I’m sorry,” Franny said. “It’s just that I’m late… I have an interview?”

The receptionist responded by taking a long piece of floss out of her bag and cleaning her teeth. *Your Call Is Very Important To Us*.

“The email said that I should speak to the front desk and someone would come down for me. Are you—” Franny’s voice faltered. “Are you the front desk?”

The receptionist examined a section of floss that had drawn blood from her gums.

“I’m the next caller.”

Franny wondered if she should just go home. She surveyed the empty lobby for any signs, literal or otherwise, that might inform her decision. The walls were bare except for a yellowed handwritten note berating a Mr. Nielsen for failing to collect his packages in a timely manner. *MR. NIELSEN*, the sign read. *Your packages are PILING UP. Anya tripped over a box yesterday and almost BROKE HER FOOT! The situation is UNTENABLE. Please pick up your packages TODAY, or we will be forced to escalate!!!!!*",2,1757808059.0,PubTips,2,0.75,False

https://preview.redd.it/c3ygo72is0pf1.png?width=596&format=png&auto=webp&s=605d3ef6b5c7742652d92cb08625b6d9be8ee1fa

   In this era of highly evolving technologies, AI, undoubtedly is poised to reign supreme. AI is rapidly moving from the background to the forefront, becoming a driving force that redefines how people work, communicate, and even think.  As AI integrates deeper into our homes, workplaces, and communities, it is reshaping what it means to live in the modern world. If you are into investing like me, you might if you haven’t been already, want to consider three AI stocks that still have ample runway space for take-off to grow your assets.  These AI stocks have a high probability of going ballistic sooner or later. 

   The first on my list is **CoreWeave**, ticker symbol **CRWV**.  This cloud computing company has its IPO on March 28 of this year. At $40 per share, raising approximately $1.5 billion, it was the largest AI related IPO so far in 2025. CoreWeave offers GPU powered cloud infrastructure tailored for AI workloads. The first cloud provider to deploy NVIDIA’s Blackwell Ultra chip, the top-of-the-line microprocessor accelerator that provides superb inference power and high accuracy reasoning ability to AI and machine learning models. Analysts, however, are concerned about the company’s high debt levels amounting to approximately $11 billion. Even so, CoreWeave has locked in sizeable contracts with Microsoft and OpenAI. Other key clients include Meta, IBM, NVIDIA, Cohere and Mistral. It has a rapid infrastructure scale up operating over 33 data centers and is set to invest $21 billion in expansion. Overall, I see this company as having a robust business that is both competitive and in demand today and in the years ahead. With a current stock price of $112 and analysts’ price target as high as $200 for the next twelve months, I am bullish on this stock and will dollar cost average (DCA) for maybe until next year. These figures, however, are volatile and subject to change at any time. They are only analysts' predictions and are not guaranteed outcome.  Something to be wary of. 

 

https://preview.redd.it/mqs9yq5ls0pf1.png?width=813&format=png&auto=webp&s=ef5bd2a84ac65d5d30b41ac32687ebd7dd4ec224

   The next stock on my list is **Palantir**, ticker symbol **PLTR**. The company combines data analytics and AI to streamline operations for commercial and government clients. Major deals include a potential $10 billion U.S.  Army agreement and a $795 million Dept. Of Defense contract. Commercial users both in the US and international are growing rapidly with partnerships across diverse sectors. Analysts from financial firm Piper Sandler project commercial revenues to climb at 33% annual growth rate by 2030, supported by partners like Accenture, Databricks and SAP. 

   After a phenomenal earnings report that beats all expectations on Aug. 4, the stock price soared from $154 to $190. Nonetheless, it settled back to around its original level at $156 two weeks after, fueled by a massive sell-off for profit and fear of unsustainable over valuation. The share price dipped further to $153 by the first week of September. And currently at $171.  But if you believe like I do that this stock is positioned to have a strong upward movement within the next few months or years, then you might consider adding these assets to your portfolio. Not a financial advice though. My opinion is based on my research that determined Palantir has strong business fundamentals and products resonating well with its customers. Some analysts predict the stock price might even fall between $125 to $140 in the coming weeks and suggest buyers wait for this opportunity to knock and take advantage of the dip considering the protracted share price could shoot up to the range of $180 to $200 at year’s end. 

 

https://preview.redd.it/h0p4y1qos0pf1.png?width=302&format=png&auto=webp&s=6316259cf22fceea7668c74179179eb22ae2b410

   The final stock on my list is AI chip giant **NVIDIA**.  The first company ever to cross the threshold of $4 trillion market cap. Like Palantir, NVIDIA’s Q2 earnings came up strong beating all but one expectation. The company’s data center revenue was slightly off at $41.1 billion against Wall Street’s $41.3 billion. Yet, its outlook for this sector remains extremely strong driven by massive global demand for AI infrastructure and a significant growth projected for years to come. Holding a market share of over 90% in AI compute and networking, NVIDIA is way far ahead of its closest rival AMD, at less than 10%. 

   NVIDIA and AMD have agreed to share 15% of their revenue with the US government from less advanced AI chips sales to China as part of a deal to secure export licenses for the semiconductor. In my opinion, this agreement is better than nothing as it can bolster both company’s earnings year over year. At $177 per share as of Sep. 12, I am bullish on this stock as an average of a little over $200 is the latest target price reported by [StockAnalysis.com](http://StockAnalysis.com), TipRanks, and Investing .com.

I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig someday, but right now, I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. I'm pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, and music courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time, and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking, though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

He is now afraid to leave his house or speak to anyone. He genuinely is afraid if he goes to his usual food cart place he gets his morning coffee and sees friends that a trans furry is going to stab him in the neck and no one will help him and no one will believe him. He's furious about so many beliefs that make no sense and keep shifting every two minutes. I can't even tell what he believes. It's like this maelstrom of every conspiracy theory you've ever heard and even some new ones. Like his brain is trying to make it all make sense but it never will so it's just making him absolutely insane.

He sent me a lot of scary texts after I left saying he thinks I am going to kill him just like ""they"" killed the American Football Hero Dad (Charlie). He's very upset about all these events happening which are ""symbolic"". Everything happening is ""symbolic"" and nothing is ever, EVER what it seems.

I was shocked and scared to hear these things from him. I said you are safe, I won't bother you ever again, I am NOT going to hurt you in any way, I'm sorry, etc.

Anyways, long story short, looking for advice on how to tackle this thing! I have an orbital sander and a respirator btw. Tia! ",1,1757807269.0,restoration,0,1.0,False

1ngccqj,https://www.reddit.com/r/harare/comments/1ngccqj/5_iptv_providers_i_actually_used_in_2025_my/,5 IPTV Providers I Actually Used in 2025: My Real-Life Ranking,"Is it just me, or does finding decent [**iptv providers**](https://www.reddit.com/r/LLptv/wiki/index/) sometimes feel like a wild treasure hunt? After too many late nights (and too much coffee, if I’m honest), I finally put five different IPTV services to the test. My main goal? Reliable access to US, UK, CA, and FR channels—without the endless buffering or confusing setups. Here’s my personal ranking, with all the little quirks I found along the way.

* * *

### 1\. [XXIPTV](https://www.reddit.com/r/LLptv/wiki/index/)

*   **Price:** $15/month (cheaper for longer [**iptv subscription 2025**](https://xxiptv.top/) deals)
    
*   **Channels:** 38,000+ live, 130,000+ VOD (best for US and UK sports, solid on CA/FR)
    
*   **Smoothness:** 9/10 (barely any lag, even during US and UK primetime)
    
*   **My experience:** I first heard about XXIPTV from a Canadian **iptv reseller** on Reddit. Honestly, it’s been the smoothest streaming I’ve had—whether it’s EPL matches, US sitcoms, or catching up on a French crime series. Their **best iptv trial** was easy to get started with and didn’t require my credit card (huge plus for me).
    

* * *

### 2\. [IPTVMEZZY](https://www.reddit.com/r/Reddit_Official_IPTV/wiki/index/)

*   **Price:** $16/month (discounts if you go for a multi-month plan)
    
*   **Channels:** 45,000+ live, 220,000+ VOD (huge US, UK, CA, FR selection)
    
*   **Smoothness:** 8.5/10 (mostly excellent; I only noticed minor buffering during a Canadian hockey final)
    
*   **My experience:** I stumbled on IPTVMEZZY through a French expat group. Their variety is impressive; I even found some obscure FR news channels and a bunch of UK comedy reruns. Setup was a breeze, and most streams were crisp—even on my old Firestick.
    

* * *

### 3\. [Aurorastreaming](https://www.reddit.com/r/Aurorastreaming/wiki/index/)

*   **Price:** $14/month
    
*   **Channels:** 32,000+ live, 105,000+ VOD (strong UK/FR, decent US/CA)
    
*   **Smoothness:** 8/10 (great for 90% of content, but live UK events sometimes stuttered)
    
*   **My experience:** Aurorastreaming was a bit of an underdog. It’s honestly my go-to for French TV and British documentaries. Their VOD section is packed with classics, though I did get a spinning wheel during a UK rugby match once. Customer service was quick to respond when I needed help.
    

* * *

### 4\. [HyperView IPTV](https://aurorastreaming.online/)

*   **Price:** $13/month
    
*   **Channels:** 25,000+ live, 80,000+ VOD (mostly US/UK/CA, limited FR)
    
*   **Smoothness:** 7.5/10 (everyday shows played fine; some lag on big US games)
    
*   **My experience:** HyperView IPTV is the “steady backup” in my lineup. It’s perfect for news, US late-night shows, or Canadian channels. If you’re a French TV superfan, you’ll want a supplement, but for basics it’s reliable. The [**iptv subscription 2025**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Aurorastreaming/wiki/index/) sign-up was clear—even my tech-averse cousin managed it.
    

* * *

### 5\. NovaCast TV

*   **Price:** $12/month
    
*   **Channels:** 18,000+ live, 54,000+ VOD (US/UK core, light on CA/FR)
    
*   **Smoothness:** 7/10 (evenings brought some buffering, especially on UK sports)
    
*   **My experience:** NovaCast TV is my “background TV” option. It’s great for catching up on old US sitcoms or UK news while cooking, but not for heavy live sports. Their **iptv reseller** info is easy to find if that’s your thing, but I mostly kept it as a casual extra.

My IPTV Takeaways from 2025
---------------------------

*   **Always use the best iptv trial**—your devices, internet, and region can change everything.
    
*   Don’t get hypnotized by huge channel numbers. Stick with what you actually watch (for me: UK quiz shows, US late-night, and French mysteries).
    
*   Even the most [**top rated iptv**](https://www.reddit.com/r/LLptv/wiki/index/) brands have off nights, especially when a big game’s on in the US or UK.
    
*   If you’re tempted to become an [**iptv reseller**,](https://www.reddit.com/r/LLptv/wiki/index/) just know you’ll suddenly be everyone’s tech support.",1,1757807181.0,harare,0,1.0,False
1ngcce1,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ngcce1/that_thing_was_not_my_grandma/,That thing was not my grandma,"My grandma used to be my favorite part of my childhood. We would go garage-sale hunting, go to dog shows, and she attended every single sporting event. Her birthday gifts were always amazing, and she was always there to help if I needed anything. I’m now sixteen, and she isn’t doing well. I’m not sure exactly what the issue is, but over the year her health has become a serious problem, and she now has to move in with us. I watched as my parents helped the frail, broken old woman into the house and into her hospital bed set up in the room right beside mine. She smiled at me, but I didn’t recognize her. My dog, Benji, would not stop barking at her — something I should have picked up on. For the first night, my grandma rested and did not really engage with us, rarely ringing her small bell to get help from either of my parents.



That night at around 11 p.m., I lay in my bed listening to the rain hit my window, soothing me to sleep, when I heard it: the light bell chime. When no one responded, she rang it again, and again. Finally, I decided to help her myself. Shuffling over to the spare room next to mine, what I saw lying in my grandmother’s bed shook me to my core. Bright magenta eyes glowed like small neon orbs, accompanied by a black, human-shaped mass and bright teeth just visible. The image only lasted a couple of seconds because I was quick to turn her light on, but to my surprise my grandma was not in her bed. I then heard it again — this time behind me, coming from my room.



I slowly walked back to my room, where an outline was visible under my covers. My lights wouldn’t work, and as I slowly crept toward my bed I heard the bell behind me again, causing me to swiftly turn around. The room grew darker, as if my eyes were suddenly unable to adjust. I then heard and felt fast footsteps exit my room and slam the door. Suddenly the lights came on, and as I stuck my head out of my room I saw my parents tending to my grandma, now back in her bed. I wondered if I had a nightmare and decided to keep the ordeal to myself.



I woke up the next day and my dog was nowhere to be found, so I spent the day hanging up lost-dog posters. That night I heard scratching coming from above my room, which kept me up and caused me to tell my dad. He heard shuffling as he went up there. He discovered a few dead, chewed-up rats and wondered if the dog had done it. I denied it — Benji had no way to get up there — but my dad swore it was the most logical explanation. He set up some rat traps and went back to bed. The noises only increased, and I could now hear my dog yelping. I rushed up the attic stairs without hesitation; to my horror, I found my grandma eating Benji. She attacked me, we fell down the stairs, and I remember nothing after that as I slipped into a small coma.





I woke two days later to the antiseptic smell of the ward and the mechanical tick of a clock I hadn’t noticed before. My mom was hunched in a plastic chair beside me, eyes red and empty like someone who’d been looking for answers and only found questions. When I told them—slow, halting, the memory jagged and skipping like a scratched record—doctors said I’d suffered a massive brain injury. “Post-concussive episodes,” one of them called it gently, as if naming it made it less monstrous. They told me to rest. They told me things would be okay.



My mom also told me my grandma was fine. She was home, she said, sleeping in her bed just like before, “responding appropriately to stimuli,” my dad told us over the phone. My mom stayed with me at the hospital while my dad wast home to help — we both needed someone to be somewhere. He called later that day in a voice so flat I thought maybe the house had swallowed the hope in it. “I need you here,” he said. “Now.” My mom kissed my forehead, shoved a folded hospital blanket into my hands like proof she’d been there, and left. “I’ll be right back,” she said, and the words hung in the doorway and then the door closed.

She didn’t come back for a long time.



I tried to keep my eyes open, to count the ceiling panels or the number of raindrops on the window, but the exhaustion from whatever the doctors had fixed in my skull pulled me under like a tide. When I surfaced, it was to a sound I knew too well: the low, frantic scratching that crawled along the same frequency as a ringing bell.

My nurse call button blinked like a small, indifferent star. I jabbed it. No response. The light on the panel stuttered and died. For a second I believed the wires in my head had been rewired so the hospital couldn’t hear me. Then I heard it—the faint chime of my grandma’s bell.



Panic warmed my palms and then cooled into a strange clarity; if no one was coming, I had to see for myself.

I swung my legs over the bed and stood. The floor felt colder than the mattress should allow. The corridor hummed; a distant trolley clattered. I moved like a ghost learning how to haunt its own body: quiet, careful, each footfall measured. The scratching grew louder as I walked, a frantic, animal rhythm coming from the corner of my room where a cheap vinyl chair sat with its back to the wall.

I edged closer and peered behind the chair.



What crouched there was my grandmother and not my grandmother. She was shoved to the floor, knees tucked under her frail body, fingers splayed and scrabbling at the linoleum. Her nightgown hung in loose, unfamiliar folds. There was blood on her fingertips, dark and smeared, and the way she worked at the floor—tearing, clawing—was both frantic and oddly deliberate, like someone trying to dig a key out of the wood with nails that should not have been capable of such force. Her eyes were sunken, pupils blown wide with a flat, wet sheen that caught the fluorescent lights and turned them into something cruel.

For a moment I simply watched, breath frozen behind my ribs. This could not be right. This could not be.

Then she rose.



She moved so fast that the sound off her unsteady heels on linoleum sounded obscene—too loud for the tiny body that used to fold into my lap. She darted forward like a mechanism wound too tightly, aimed straight at me. Instinct threw my hands out. Before I could think, her fingers closed on mine and we were locked together as if by some small, inevitable machine. Her grip was cold and impossibly strong, as if iron had been cast around my wrist.



Her face was not my grandmother’s face. It began to shift in the small space between two heartbeats: skin stretching and thinning where it should have been soft, cheekbones sharpening into angles that weren’t human, a mouth widening too wide for the jaw that had contained it a moment before. Magenta irises bled into black rims. Teeth that were too bright and too many slid like knives behind lips that had become something else. The sound she made was a wet, small sound—not quite a moan, not quite a laugh—and it vibrated up my arm like an electric current.



For a breath I felt something like recognition—something human beneath the thing—but it was overlaid with a second, truer knowledge: whatever had taken her had learned how to wear her. The creature’s eyes caught mine with a hungry, delighted focus that stripped away memory and left hunger. I could smell the hospital detergent, the stale coffee on the nurse’s station, and beneath it the copper tang of blood.



My heart hammered so loudly I thought someone would answer it, would finally come, and then the room narrowed to the grip of those fingers and the wet rasp of breath against my ear. I had no plan, no weapon, only the brutal clarity of being pinned to the moment. My lungs filled and I had to decide — fight, scream, pray — but the creature bent its head in a way that made my stomach drop and smiled with a mouth that was wrong, magenta eyes burning into my retna.



Just then, the door burst open. Nurses rushed in, flooding the room with light. My parents stood behind them, both pale and out of breath.

“Grandma’s missing,” my dad said.

The words sank into me like ice. My mom stared at me, waiting for me to speak, but nothing came out.

1ngcbh5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ngcbh5,Nervous for German Short Rows,"I’m going to attempt German Short Rows for the first time, and I’m nervous! I watched a few YouTube videos, and started to feel ready to jump in on step 1 row 1 (see picture but ignore pen notes…those were from my previous attempts) of The Weekend Sweater by Darling Jadore. It’s raglan sweater knit top down.

I left off with my project a few weeks ago after finishing the double knit collar, which I had to be creative with on the last few stitches, setting up the yoke and inserting a lifeline (the orange yarn). Note, the coffee cup charm is my BOR marker. 

I want to validate some things before I attempt step 1 row 1. My first working stitch is the raglan stitch, which feels odd. Especially since i need to M1L, and I thought that’s something you do right before a stitch marker. 

Also, idk why my raglan stitch is hanging out with the yarn in front like a purl stitch and there is a gap between that and the stitch to the right of it. 

Anyway, I’m eager to proceed because I think I can manage short rows but my starting point has me nervous to proceed!

Last but not least, thanks to the helpful advice here, my project is now on the correct cable length! That was a game changer!

1ngcaxl,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ngcaxl,Peach Riot Survey — RESULTS (+ observations),"Thank you to all 139 people who participated in my PR survey!! I really did not expect to get so many responses and I’m really glad that I did since it makes the data more accurate. There was a portion of the survey where I asked for your #1 favourite figure +an optional explaination why, which I did not include in these graphs since there were so many different results. However, you can see them (as well as individual answers to the full survey) through this Google Sheet. 

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bvF_kwNoKyZz-uk2JPKHbB6FIX07AQmHUP4WG2mDvj4/edit?usp=drivesdk

Keep in mind that I removed the optional explanations for the “Why is this figure your favourite/least favourite” questions for privacy reasons.


The charts are pretty good at visualizing the data, but here are some more observations I made while reading all the responses:

The figures that people said was their #1 favourite were:
1. Poppy Seraphim (13 responses)
2. Gigi The Gleeman (11 responses)
3. Frankie Virtues (11 responses)
4. Frankie Lily Pad (9 responses)
5. Frankie Diva (7 responses)

The figures that people said was their #1 LEAST favourite were:
1. Frankie Dancer (10 responses)
2. Gigi Housekeeping (9 responses)
3. Frankie Mage (7 responses)
** also, 5 people said that they don’t have one specific figure that they dislike the most, but they don’t like the Loading/chibi series in general 

Miscellaneous patterns I noticed:

- Almost everyone who chose Frankie as their favourite girl chose Poppy as their least favourite (me included)
- Frankie The Boss was the most polarizing figure, as 15 people said that it was their favourite from Rise Up and 16 people said that it was their least favourite 
- From the optional explanation part, both people who said Frankie Diva was their fav and least fave mentioned her fashion style being the main factor why
- I personally always knew that many people didn’t like the designs of the Loading line, but it genuinely shocked me that 56.7% of y’all said that it was your least favourite series. I sort of agree, it’s just that I see people post about them here so much!

1ngc93b,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1ngc93b/i_won_the_powerball/,I won the Powerball,"No, not the one that just recently ballooned to well over a billion dollars.  Rather, one from almost 10 years ago.  Enough time has passed without being publicly identified as the winner that I feel safe(er) in sharing my story.  There is no foolproof way of keeping the identity of my husband and me safe.  However, after almost 10 years of nearly maniacal silence and secrecy, I’d like to explain what happened to us, in hopes that it might provide support and guidance to anyone who might find themselves in our shoes.

 

First, know that I created a throwaway account and am labeling this as “fiction” so you, dear reader (yes, I’m a Bridgerton fan, IYKYK), won’t truly know if my story is real or not.  Also, some essential details have been changed to keep the identity of my family and myself hidden.

 

Here’s how it all went down…

 

I was a teacher, and school was out for the summer.  I used the opportunity to visit my elderly mother, who was adamant that she wanted to stay in her home for as long as physically possible.  None of her four kids, including me, lived in the state of Missouri where she lived.  She had two grandkids (my brother’s kids) who were at the large state college nearby, but their lives were filled with classes and being with friends.  Mom had been in the same home for over 50 years.  She and my Dad had bought it new, and Mom said that staying in the house was one of the ways she felt close to Dad.  Also, she was deeply ingrained in her community, engaging in extensive volunteer work and participating in three separate bridge groups.  She still drove, prided herself on never being in an accident that was her fault, and her cognitive faculties remained sharp and on point.  So, my siblings and I were all in agreement that, for now, we’d support her staying put.

 

I had a great visit with Mom.  We went shopping, ate out, watched movies in the evening, and even did a water aerobics class together.  The 5-day visit went quickly, and I needed to get back home.  I didn’t mind the long drive as I enjoyed the opportunity to listen to my podcasts, audiobooks, or favorite music.  Before I got on the road, I stopped three blocks from my mother’s house to fill up on gas.  

 

At the gas station, after pumping my gas, I went inside and put my water and bag of sunflower seeds on the counter.  I noticed the colorful scratch-off game tickets and signs, which indicated that I could purchase a Powerball lottery ticket there.  About 4 or 5 times a year, I played the Powerball if the jackpot was extraordinarily high, or if I just found myself buying something at a gas station that sold tickets.  About three months prior, I read an article about the changes that were being made to the Powerball game.  The number of white balls in the hopper increased from 59 to 69, while the number of red balls in the other hopper decreased from 35 to 26.  This resulted in much larger jackpots because the odds of winning the jackpot decreased significantly, reducing the chances of a winner in any given drawing and increasing the likelihood of rollovers of the jackpot money to the next drawing.  While this wasn’t one of the massive record-breaking jackpots, it was a lot.  As in 9 figures a lot.  I asked for one ticket for the Powerball with the Powerplay.  I let the machine randomly select the numbers, then bought it with cash along with my other items.  I didn’t even bother to look at the numbers, I just stuck it into my wallet.

 

Like most lotto ticket purchasers everywhere, I imagined what it would be like to win, what I would buy, what I would change, etc.  I knew the odds of winning were completely ridiculous, so I always considered the $3 to be the price of having a little imaginative fun.  If I played, at least I had an infinitesimal chance.  If I didn’t play, I had zero chance.

 

When I got home, my husband Paul helped me unload the car, then we shared stories about what each of us had been up to the last few days.  A bit about Paul and me…at that time, we’d been married for almost 30 years.  We had taken a \*lot\* of heat for getting married so young, but we’d proven all the naysayers wrong and went the distance.  I adore Paul, and together we raised two children, who are now grown and have families of their own.  I love them and our grandchildren with all of my heart.  Paul and I enjoy each other’s company, and we have a marriage based on respect, trust, and love.  We’ve had our ups and downs like any couple, but we always worked through them and came out stronger on the other side.

 

Paul is truly the reason that we’ve been able to cope with the Powerball win as well as we have.  And yes, cope is the right word.  Even positive changes can be stressful, and this was one of the most stressful things we’ve ever lived through. 

 

He’s in the medical field and grew up in a blue-collar family.  After graduating from high school, he attended a nearby community college for two years before transferring to a small regional state university to pursue a bachelor’s degree.  He obtained the education, training, and skills to go into the medical field in which he was working at the time.  He’s a hard worker and a likable guy, so he did well for himself.

 

Because Paul’s parents weren’t very good with money, they were often struggling to make ends meet.  It was frustrating because when they had money, it would be spent on unnecessary things, like high-end fishing gear and bigger TVs.   When it came time for college, no money had been saved for Paul or his sisters, so he had to take out student loans.  His parents were kind-hearted, though, and they had always treated me like one of their own.  

 

Because of the way he’d been raised, Paul was determined that he was not going to make the mistakes his parents made when it came to money.  He became a devotee of Dave Ramsey, whose books he read and radio shows and podcasts he listened to.  He appreciated Ramsey's relatable advice, especially for someone like him who wasn’t a millionaire and didn’t have a finance degree.  Paul soaked it all up.  He immediately began to pay off his student loans (I fortunately didn’t have any) and used budget calculators to determine how much was spent on needs, wants, and savings.  He paid meticulous attention to putting money away for retirement, maximizing retirement contributions as we could afford, and investing the money in solid holdings like index funds.  As soon as the kids were born, we started saving for their college funds, even if it was as little as $10 per month.  We always lived below our means, never bought new cars, and when we could, we’d repair our broken or worn possessions instead of buying new ones.  Sometimes it was tiresome, especially when it seemed my teacher friends were enjoying material things that we could afford but chose not to buy.

 

I think it helped that we were young when we married, and that Paul started with this financial mindset from the beginning.  It was pretty much all I knew as an adult.  Between our two jobs, we made about $120k/year, pre-tax.  When we hit our 30s, Paul began “estate planning,” which made me laugh because that sounded like something that only rich people in movies did.  Nevertheless, we drew up wills, power of attorney documents, etc.  Paul researched and worked with our estate attorney (again, it sounded crazy to me that we had an “estate attorney”) to devise plans for a trust to leave money for our children and grandchildren.  We would periodically make changes to update things.  For example, when our son showed daredevil tendencies in grade school, we wanted to rethink leaving him money at just age 18 years old in the event that both Paul and I died.

 

Thanks to my husband’s diligence with finances and our slow but steady approach to savings, we had a net worth of about $650k when we won the Powerball.  Most importantly, Paul’s dedication to learning about money management helped us immensely with what happened next.

 

About three weeks after buying the Powerball ticket, I still didn’t know I was a winner.  I would typically keep purchased lotto tickets in my wallet, only to forget about them until I switched wallets, found the ticket, and checked the winning numbers to see if I was a winner.  I had won $50 once on a ticket I had bought 5 months prior!  I had nearly run out of time to collect my winnings.  So I tried to be better about checking any lotto tickets I had stored in my wallet.

 

For most of us, there will be moments in our lives when something extraordinary happens, so memorable that we recall every detail.  For example, for me, two tragic examples are the Challenger space shuttle blowing up and 9/11.  Two extraordinarily positive moments were when I had each of our two children.  A common theme of those events is that people will say, “I remember it like it was yesterday,” then can go on to tell in minute detail what happened.  What I write next was one of those life moments for me.

 

It was a Friday afternoon, and I was planning to go out with some teacher friends, as school was going to be starting soon, and we wanted one last hurrah before starting another year.  The purse I chose to match my outfit was smaller than the purse I’d been using for the last few weeks, so I had to pare things down to make them fit.  I went through my wallet to pull out the cards/cash I would need for the evening, and that's when I saw the lotto ticket.  I pulled it out so I could check the numbers.  I finished getting ready, then brought the ticket to the living room so I could check the numbers on my laptop while I waited for my friend to pick me up.

 

I went to the Powerball website and scrolled down to find the correct date.  (Back then, drawings were only twice a week, not three times a week like now.)  I looked at my screen, then at my ticket, then back at the screen, and then at my ticket again.  My jaw literally dropped open, and blood rushed through me.  I felt my heart pounding, my head felt dizzy, and my stomach clenched with nerves and nausea.  At that moment, I realized I must have made a mistake.

 

I got up, shook both my hands like I’d touched a burning stove, and walked to the back of the house, then back to the front.  I forced myself to control my breathing, the way they teach you when women give birth.  I sat down and looked at the numbers on the screen again, then on the ticket.  I double checked the date, and it was accurate.  I checked the numbers one by one.  Yes, it was accurate.  I had a winning ticket.  And the jackpot… $ 420 million!! My head felt like it was about to explode.  

 

I was alone at the house, and I desperately wanted Paul there and now!  I remembered past conversations with Paul when I fantasized about winning the Powerball.  He wasn’t happy I spent money on gambling, but he trusted me when I told him I did it at most 5 or 6 times a year.  So less than $20/year, not bad for entertainment.  In any case, Paul had listened to various financial “gurus” talk show episodes about what to do if you win the Powerball.  And the one thing that Paul always said was this:  TELL NO ONE.  It made me laugh because he was serious when he said it, as if I would ever win.  But thankfully, the message stuck with me.

 

I texted Paul immediately. 

 

Me: “Are you on your way home? “

 

Paul:  “Yes”

 

Me: “What’s your ETA?”

 

Paul: “About 30 mins.  Is everything ok?”

 

Me:  “um, yes?  I mean it’s nothing bad.  Just plz come home as soon as you can.  ilu”

 

Paul:  “ok, see you soon, ilu2!”

 

Next, I texted my teacher friend who was supposed to pick me up.  I told her my stomach was upset and I thought I might be coming down with a stomach bug, only half a lie.  I reread the message several times to ensure I wasn’t saying anything suspicious, then pressed send.  She responded right away, saying they would miss me and to feel better soon.

 

What was I going to do for the 30 minutes before Paul got back home?  I ran to our bedroom, peeled off my clothes, then got in the shower.  I couldn’t call or text anyone if I were soaking wet in the shower.  I made the water as hot as I could stand it.  I washed my hair and body, then did it all over again.  I kept saying, “Oh my God, oh my God, on my God” like I was in a trance.  I continued to breathe deeply, and things finally began to slow down.  What was this going to mean for our family?  All our lives, we’d been so diligent about using money wisely; what was this going to do to that?  Then I realized I had left the ticket on the table in the living room!  What if the proverbial wind blew it away (as if there would be some random wind blowing through our living room)?  What if someone broke in and stole it?  What if all of this was just a dream?  Where is Paul?!?!

 

With one towel wrapped around my hair and another wrapped around my body, I rushed to the living room and saw the tiny square of paper on the table next to my computer.  It was such a small piece of paper, so vulnerable.  I was scared that the dampness of my body would mess up the ticket.  I got one of our coffee table books (one about modern art that I picked up for $6 at a garage sale), picked up the edge of the ticket as gingerly as if I was picking up an angry crab, dropped it into the middle of the book, closed it, brought it to our bedroom, and stuck it under our pillows.  I then got my robe and put it on.

 

It was then that Paul came home.  I hadn’t heard him come in, so I jumped when he called my name.  “Oh, thank God you’re home!”  Then I started both laughing and crying as I hugged Paul tightly with both my arms.

 

“Shhh, it’s okay, I’m home, it’s all going to be okay,” Paul comforted me, without knowing why he had found me in such a state.  He just held me and kept comforting me.

 

After a few moments, I pulled away, looked at him straight in the eyes, then said, “I think we won the Powerball!”  His face contorted in slight confusion as I explained that I had bought a Powerball ticket in Missouri when I was visiting my Mom.  I checked the numbers just before texting him, and thought we had a winning ticket.  Though he would deny it later, I think he thought I’d gone stark raving mad!  Or that I was pulling a not-so-elaborate joke on him.

 

“Where is the ticket, sweetheart?” Paul gently asked.  

 

I leaned over to the pillows, pushed them aside, revealing the coffee table art book.  I picked it up, carefully flipped the pages until I got to the one holding the ticket.  It was on a page featuring one of the swimming pool paintings by David Hockney (we would later purchase a print of that very painting for sentimental reasons).  I pointed to the ticket, still scared to touch it, as if I was genuinely afraid of the power the ticket potentially possessed.

 

As I write about my emotions in that moment, I know some of it may sound silly.  But it’s my truth and what I felt in those moments.  

 

Paul had me follow him to his office.  We sat side by side as he pulled up the Powerball site and checked the numbers.  Like I had done, he checked the numbers several times, made certain about which drawing it was, and then he read the faint wording on the back.  Three times.  He had me go get a sandwich bag in the kitchen.  While there, Paul made certain to close the blinds on the windows, which reminded me of the stories of Edward Snowden going to great lengths to conceal what he was doing on his computer.  When I returned with the baggie, he carefully put the ticket inside it, then, like I had done, tucked it into a small-ish investment book.  He opened his office closet door, pulled out a small portable safe (I had forgotten we had that), and put the book with the ticket inside it.  The safe contained copies of all our important papers in case we had to evacuate quickly for a tornado, fire, zombie apocalypse, you get the idea.  This was one of the things he had heard repeatedly in the investment advice that was essential to do.  He picked up his phone, then placed a call.  When I asked who he was calling, he said the bank.  He wanted to find out if they were still open.

 

It turned out that because it was a Friday, the bank closed a little bit early.  It would reopen the next day at 9 am.  That bank was where we had a safety deposit box with yet another copy of our important papers, plus a few valuables.

 

At this point, I could begin to see Paul getting nervous.  He alternated between running his hands through his hair and putting one hand on the safe’s handle.  

 

The details of that evening are etched on my brain as if they were engraved with a diamond.  We spent most of that evening in his office.  Paul had the locked safe next to him, researching on the internet, and I was doing the same on my laptop.  He made certain we were both using VPNs.  We both were a bit paranoid, but then how often does a person hold a golden ticket worth $420 million?  Later, we shared a glass of wine and tried to eat some leftover pizza we had in the fridge.  But neither of us could eat much.  We discussed what each of us had read, the next steps we should take, and how this could change our lives.  And we both knew that what was most critical…TELL NO ONE!

 

That night, before finally trying to go to bed around 2 am, Paul went outside, walked around the perimeter of our property, and then checked the house to ensure everything looked secure and locked.  (We live in a safe neighborhood, and he rarely did this.)  He checked and rechecked all the locks on our doors, and he even locked the door to our bedroom, something we never did.  He kept the portable safe next to him, on the side of our bed.  I wouldn’t know until much later that he had retrieved his handgun, loaded it, and placed it inside his bedside table drawer.  (He normally kept it in a gun safe, but there was nothing about this night that was normal.)  Also unbeknownst to me at the time, he had the gun in an ankle holster when we went to the bank the next day.  He has a concealed carry permit, but guns make me nervous, so he did indeed keep the gun concealed from me!

 

Thank you, dear reader, for hanging in there for so long.  I will try and condense what happened in the following days.

 

First, we stayed true to our promise to tell no one.  But we knew we needed help, a team, to assist us in managing this situation.  There are all sorts of people who advertise online as being professionals who help lottery winners.  Some are authentic, many are scammers.  Who could we trust?  Luckily, we had just the person.

 

Once the ticket was in the safety deposit box at the bank, Paul called our estate attorney (let’s call him Will, no pun intended), who had drawn up our wills, trust documents, etc.  We had become close over the years as our kids had gone to school together.  Paul called him and explained that an important situation had arisen, and asked when we could make an appointment to see him at the office.  

 

We met with him that Tuesday and swore him to secrecy.  He was a little taken aback as confidentiality was a cornerstone of his business and personal ethos, and he was a consummate professional.  We asked if he could not share with his staff the nature of what we were about to share with him.  He said he honestly didn’t know unless he knew what the situation was that we were dealing with, but that he would do everything possible to follow our wishes.

 

We told him we had a winning Powerball ticket, purchased in Missouri, worth $240 million.  Will listened intently and reassured us that he could take steps to keep his staff from being made aware of this.  Thank God the ticket had been purchased in Missouri.  That was good for two reasons.  First, Missouri was one of the states where a Powerball winner could remain anonymous.  Second, no one would think that the winner would likely be in our state.  The gas station where I bought the tickets was in the middle of a town in Missouri, and not along an Interstate.  Thus, most would assume the winner lived in Missouri.

 

It turned out that Will had attended a highly regarded law school in a major city that was a financial center with a high cost of living.  In other words, it was an area with a \*lot\* of condensed wealth.  One of his professors who taught about wills and trusts had given a lecture about lottery winners.  It was a fun end-of-the-week lecture topic, but it also served as an excellent thought experiment about the realities and legalities that lottery winners face, and how to help them.  Will planned to contact that professor and see if he could make recommendations to put together a team to assist us.

 

We ended up with another attorney who specialized in trusts, an accountant, and a wealth manager, all of whom did not live in our state and who specialized in working with high-net-worth individuals.  All three had experience working with lottery winners who received high payouts, and they had also worked together as a team for others in similar circumstances.  We made several trips to that city to collaborate with our team on a plan that included structuring a new trust.  The trust had a generic, non-identifying name, and the new attorney contacted the lottery commission.  Four months after the drawing, the attorney presented the commission with the winning ticket and trust documents.  (He traveled with a discreet security team the entire time he traveled with the ticket.)  

 

Paul and I were so relieved when the ticket made it to the lottery commission and was verified as a winning ticket.  We opted for the lump sum payment, so our winnings went from $420 million to $231 million.  Then, the IRS automatically withholds 25% of that, bringing the sum down to $173 million.  Then, depending on how much money we chose to have distributed to us in any given year, we would potentially have to pay an additional 14% in tax.  As a public school teacher who lived in an area with nice roads, I understood the importance of taxes.  But still, that was a lot of money.  But then again, I never imagined that we’d ever have so much money.

 

Thank God Paul and I had each other.  We were also grateful for the team we had that we could ask questions of.  It was hard keeping everything secret from our family and friends.  But the secrecy was made easier when our team framed it in terms of maintaining our family’s security and maintaining some normalcy in our friendships.   The investment strategy for the trust’s winnings went far beyond Paul’s basic investment strategies made for middle-class folks.  He enjoyed learning about the advanced investment strategies being used by our wealth manager.  And I was grateful that Paul paid close attention to those details.

 

So how did this change things?  To this day, none of our family knows.  Both Paul and I continued working at our jobs, he for 1 year and I for 3.  Paul was glad to leave his job behind.  He wanted to spend more time learning about new things, including investments.  But he didn’t want to make any sudden moves that could arouse suspicion.  So he waited a year before leaving.  But winning the money had an unexpected effect on me: I loved my job more!  The innocence of my little elementary students was made even more dear by knowing I was there because I wanted to be, not that I had to be.  After three years of working, Paul became eager for us to travel more, so I decided to retire.  

 

Also, we stayed in our home.  We didn’t buy new cars, jewelry, designer clothes, or anything that would have hinted at newfound wealth.  Instead, we spent money on experiences.  We took a trip to Paris, flying first-class and staying at a luxury hotel.  We learned about Michelin-starred restaurants and ate at a couple.  But honestly, we found it hard to pay over $150 for a side dish of asparagus.  And don’t even get me started on these multi-course meals that had miniature servings on the plates!  Instead, we enjoyed eating at bistros with heartier fare.  Our families knew we went to Paris, but they didn’t know about the extravagance of our trip.

 

We made generous deposits in our grandchildren’s college funds.  We helped pay off our children’s student loan debts.  If a family member was in need, we found a way to anonymously provide for them until they could get back on their feet.  Sometimes we made anonymous donations to various charitable causes.  

 

Our family knew that Paul was active in investing.  We used that to our advantage.  We led them to believe that Paul had invested in Bitcoin and used those winnings to take our parents, children, and grandchildren on an unforgettable safari in Africa.  It’s funny because Paul would have never invested in Bitcoin.  He preferred boring index funds.  But he went along with the farce as a means of explaining how we came up with the funds for an African safari.  More recently, he engaged in further subterfuge involving Nvidia stock.  

 

Paul's managed to craft a believable backstory that we earned enough to fund a family trip, but not so much that people started begging us for money.  He’s conveyed to our family that while we have made money with careful saving and investing, we’ve decided that we want to enjoy the fruits of our labor, which is why we are spending more freely than we had previously.  The kids think that because we’re spending a bit more, there won’t be as much left for them when we die.  But they are okay with that as they want us to be happy and, frankly, they are benefiting from our spending on them now.  

 

One thing Paul and I have struggled with is how to structure things after we are both gone.  We don’t want the children and grandchildren to inherit so much money that it ruins them.  We’ve read many stories about how people who inherit a lot of money sometimes lose the will to work or find themselves feeling empty.  We’ve read about how great wealth is typically gone within three generations.  We are trying to find the right balance of giving to charitable causes vs. giving to our family.

 

Perhaps you, dear readers, have some insight or ideas about how to direct our wealth after we’re gone. Sometimes you find wisdom in the most unlikely of places, even Reddit.

 

The last 10 years have taught me a few things that I will share with you:

 

1.      Having a loving and supportive partner in life is one of the most fulfilling and valuable 

building blocks to a life well lived.

 

2.     The most important things money cannot buy.  I know it sounds trite, but it’s true.  Once you have your basic needs met, the most valuable things are family, friends, laughter, and making positive memories.  

 

3.     Start building your wealth the right way.  If Paul hadn’t learned the basics of investing, we wouldn’t have fared as well as we have since winning the Powerball.

 

4.     If you gamble, be prepared to lose.  Don’t plan on making money by gambling.  Instead, think of it as the price of entertainment, like buying movie tickets. 

 

5.     If you choose to play the Powerball, try to play in states where winners can stay anonymous, if possible.  A quick Google search will tell you which states those are.

 

6.     Take care of your health.  When you’re younger, you don’t realize how important it is to take care of yourself so that you can enjoy your later years.

 

7.     Treat everyone with respect, whether it’s the tired barista at the coffee shop, the man picking up your trash, or the wealth manager investing your millions.  Everyone deserves to feel valued for who they are, not how much money they make.

 

I’m sure there are other lessons, but this is what comes to mind now.  Thank you, dear readers, for listening to my tale.  ",5,1757806899.0,stories,7,0.78,False

Later that day, I scrolled through the back stacks and picked an episode at random: Voyager's 11:59. When Neelix says (and Wynde dropped in the clip) ""Tell me more,"" Wynde gave us the Picard ""You'll have to call again"" drop. Which is such a meta drop joke that I spit out my coffee.

She isn't just editing these episodes. She is a legit third host, taking on more than she needs to in order to make the show funnier.

“Then one day, I come in and—boom—all the robots are gone.”

“Gone? They ran away?”

“No, stolen! Every last one.”

“They stole the employees?!”

“Yup. They worth a lot, you know. People chop ’em up for black market parts. Couple grand per leg.”

“You can’t make this stuff up.”

“Wait—there’s more. Two bots were kidnapped. We got ransom notes.”

“NO.”

“Oh yes. $80k and a signed promise not to upgrade to 5.”

“Did you pay it?”

“Had to. Those bots had customer preferences data. Brenda, our cafe loyal customer cried when Botley went missing.”

“So what now?”

“Rehired Janice and Phil. Minimum wage, dental. Still cheaper than dealing with stolen  or kidnapped employees.”

“Humans. Can’t do without ’em.”

“Can’t kidnap or chop ’em for parts either—well, not easily.”

“To the irreplaceable human workforce.”

“And to Brenda—may she never find out Botley 2.0 is just a hologram.”

had tours all around, truly was a great trip and in the 3 days we had a lot of fun and memories that will last a lifetime. But honestly the most beautiful thing I saw in Brussels were the women, Brussels is small, around 200000 people and most the women we saw, we're truly magnificent, I mean woowww, there was style, class,
beautiful eyes, I was left speechless a lot of the time just walking the streets, because of the monuments of course and the people... the single most beautiful girl I saw (probably the most beautiful I have seen in my entire life) was in the coffee shop that was below the
Atomium (or at the Atomium), she had amazing eyes smile and everything, I maybe fell in love a little bit and I think I should have asked for a date), when I saw here, I knew I needed to write an appreciation post in this subreddit, thank you for your beautiful city and all the fun things that happened in it..",0,1757806019.0,belgium,1,0.42,False

Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Ooh, black and yellow! Let's shake it up a little. Barry! Breakfast is ready! Ooming! Hang on a second. Hello? - Barry? - Adam? - Oan you believe this is happening? - I can't. I'll pick you up. Looking sharp. Use the stairs. Your father paid good money for those. Sorry. I'm excited. Here's the graduate. We're very proud of you, son. A perfect report card, all B's. Very proud. Ma! I got a thing going here. - You got lint on your fuzz. - Ow! That's me! - Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000. - Bye! Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house! - Hey, Adam. - Hey, Barry. - Is that fuzz gel? - A little. Special day, graduation. Never thought I'd make it. Three days grade school, three days high school. Those were awkward. Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around the hive. You did come back different. - Hi, Barry. - Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good. - Hear about Frankie? - Yeah. - You going to the funeral? - No, I'm not going. Everybody knows, sting someone, you die. Don't waste it on a squirrel. Such a hothead. I guess he could have just gotten out of the way. I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day. That's why we don't need vacations. Boy, quite a bit of pomp... under the circumstances. - Well, Adam, today we are men. - We are! - Bee-men. - Amen! Hallelujah! Students, faculty, distinguished bees, please welcome Dean Buzzwell. Welcome, New Hive Oity graduating class of... ...9:15. That concludes our ceremonies. And begins your career at Honex Industries! Will we pick ourjob today? I heard it's just orientation. Heads up! Here we go. Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times. - Wonder what it'll be like? - A little scary. Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group. This is it! Wow. Wow. We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life to get to the point where you can work for your whole life. Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to the hive. Our top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctive golden glow you know as... Honey! - That girl was hot. - She's my cousin! - She is? - Yes, we're all cousins. - Right. You're right. - At Honex, we constantly strive to improve every aspect of bee existence. These bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology. - What do you think he makes? - Not enough. Here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman. - What does that do? - Oatches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it. Saves us millions. Oan anyone work on the Krelman? Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones. But bees know that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot. But choose carefully because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life. The same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that. What's the difference? You'll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven't had one day off in 27 million years. So you'll just work us to death? We'll sure try. Wow! That blew my mind! ""What's the difference?"" How can you say that? One job forever? That's an insane choice to have to make. I'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life. But, Adam, how could they never have told us that? Why would you question anything? We're bees. We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth. You ever think maybe things work a little too well here? Like what? Give me one example. I don't know. But you know what I'm talking about. Please clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach. Wait a second. Oheck it out. - Hey, those are Pollen Jocks! - Wow. I've never seen them this close. They know what it's like outside the hive. Yeah, but some don't come back. - Hey, Jocks! - Hi, Jocks! You guys did great! You're monsters! You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it! - I wonder where they were. - I don't know. Their day's not planned. Outside the hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows what. You can'tjust decide to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that. Right. Look. That's more pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime. It's just a status symbol. Bees make too much of it. Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it. Those ladies? Aren't they our cousins too? Distant. Distant.     Look at these two. - Oouple of Hive Harrys. - Let's have fun with them. It must be dangerous being a Pollen Jock. Yeah. Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom! He had a paw on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me! - Oh, my! - I never thought I'd knock him out. What were you doing during this? Trying to alert the authorities. I can autograph that. A little gusty out there today, wasn't it, comrades? Yeah. Gusty. We're hitting a sunflower patch six miles from here tomorrow. - Six miles, huh? - Barry! A puddle jump for us, but maybe you're not up for it. - Maybe I am. - You are not! We're going 0900 at J-Gate. What do you think, buzzy-boy? Are you bee enough? I might be. It all depends on what 0900 means. Hey, Honex! Dad, you surprised me. You decide what you're interested in? - Well, there's a lot of choices. - But you only get one. Do you ever get bored doing the same job every day? Son, let me tell you about stirring. You grab that stick, and you just move it around, and you stir it around. You get yourself into a rhythm. It's a beautiful thing. You know, Dad, the more I think about it, maybe the honey field just isn't right for me. You were thinking of what, making balloon animals? That's a bad job for a guy with a stinger. Janet, your son's not sure he wants to go into honey! - Barry, you are so funny sometimes. - I'm not trying to be funny. You're not funny! You're going into honey. Our son, the stirrer! - You're gonna be a stirrer? - No one's listening to me! Wait till you see the sticks I have. I could say anything right now. I'm gonna get an ant tattoo! Let's open some honey and celebrate! Maybe I'll pierce my thorax. Shave my antennae. Shack up with a grasshopper. Get a gold tooth and call everybody ""dawg""! I'm so proud. - We're starting work today! - Today's the day. Oome on! All the good jobs will be gone. Yeah, right. Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring, stirrer, front desk, hair removal... - Is it still available? - Hang on. Two left! One of them's yours! Oongratulations! Step to the side. - What'd you get? - Picking crud out. Stellar! Wow! Oouple of newbies? Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready! Make your choice. - You want to go first? - No, you go. Oh, my. What's available? Restroom attendant's open, not for the reason you think. - Any chance of getting the Krelman? - Sure, you're on. I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out. Wax monkey's always open. The Krelman opened up again. What happened? A bee died. Makes an opening. See? He's dead. Another dead one. Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.     Dead from the neck up. Dead from the neck down. That's life! Oh, this is so hard! Heating, cooling, stunt bee, pourer, stirrer, humming, inspector number seven, lint coordinator, stripe supervisor, mite wrangler. Barry, what do you think I should... Barry? Barry! All right, we've got the sunflower patch in quadrant nine... What happened to you? Where are you? - I'm going out. - Out? Out where? - Out there. - Oh, no! I have to, before I go to work for the rest of my life. You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello? Another call coming in. If anyone's feeling brave, there's a Korean deli on 83rd that gets their roses today. Hey, guys. - Look at that. - Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday? Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted. It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up. Really? Feeling lucky, are you? Sign here, here. Just initial that. - Thank you. - OK. You got a rain advisory today, and as you all know, bees cannot fly in rain. So be careful. As always, watch your brooms, hockey sticks, dogs, birds, bears and bats. Also, I got a couple of reports of root beer being poured on us. Murphy's in a home because of it, babbling like a cicada! - That's awful. - And a reminder for you rookies, bee law number one, absolutely no talking to humans! All right, launch positions! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Black and yellow! Hello! You ready for this, hot shot? Yeah. Yeah, bring it on. Wind, check. - Antennae, check. - Nectar pack, check. - Wings, check. - Stinger, check. Scared out of my shorts, check. OK, ladies, let's move it out! Pound those petunias, you striped stem-suckers! All of you, drain those flowers! Wow! I'm out! I can't believe I'm out! So blue. I feel so fast and free! Box kite! Wow! Flowers! This is Blue Leader. We have roses visual. Bring it around 30 degrees and hold. Roses! 30 degrees, roger. Bringing it around. Stand to the side, kid. It's got a bit of a kick. That is one nectar collector! - Ever see pollination up close? - No, sir. I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it over here. Maybe a dash over there, a pinch on that one. See that? It's a little bit of magic. That's amazing. Why do we do that? That's pollen power. More pollen, more flowers, more nectar, more honey for us. Oool. I'm picking up a lot of bright yellow. Oould be daisies. Don't we need those? Oopy that visual. Wait. One of these flowers seems to be on the move. Say again? You're reporting a moving flower? Affirmative. That was on the line! This is the coolest. What is it? I don't know, but I'm loving this color. It smells good. Not like a flower, but I like it. Yeah, fuzzy. Ohemical-y. Oareful, guys. It's a little grabby. My sweet lord of bees! Oandy-brain, get off there! Problem! - Guys! - This could be bad. Affirmative. Very close. Gonna hurt. Mama's little boy. You are way out of position, rookie!     Ooming in at you like a missile! Help me! I don't think these are flowers. - Should we tell him? - I think he knows. What is this?! Match point! You can start packing up, honey, because you're about to eat it! Yowser! Gross. There's a bee in the car! - Do something! - I'm driving! - Hi, bee. - He's back here! He's going to sting me! Nobody move. If you don't move, he won't sting you. Freeze! He blinked! Spray him, Granny! What are you doing?! Wow... the tension level out here is unbelievable. I gotta get home. Oan't fly in rain. Oan't fly in rain. Oan't fly in rain. Mayday! Mayday! Bee going down! Ken, could you close the window please? Ken, could you close the window please? Oheck out my new resume. I made it into a fold-out brochure. You see? Folds out. Oh, no. More humans. I don't need this. What was that? Maybe this time. This time. This time. This time! This time! This... Drapes! That is diabolical. It's fantastic. It's got all my special skills, even my top-ten favorite movies. What's number one? Star Wars? Nah, I don't go for that... ...kind of stuff. No wonder we shouldn't talk to them. They're out of their minds. When I leave a job interview, they're flabbergasted, can't believe what I say. There's the sun. Maybe that's a way out. I don't remember the sun having a big 75 on it. I predicted global warming. I could feel it getting hotter. At first I thought it was just me. Wait! Stop! Bee! Stand back. These are winter boots. Wait! Don't kill him! You know I'm allergic to them! This thing could kill me! Why does his life have less value than yours?     Why does his life have any less value than mine? Is that your statement? I'm just saying all life has value. You don't know what he's capable of feeling. My brochure! There you go, little guy. I'm not scared of him. It's an allergic thing. Put that on your resume brochure. My whole face could puff up. Make it one of your special skills. Knocking someone out is also a special skill. Right. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks. - Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night? - Sure, Ken. You know, whatever. - You could put carob chips on there. - Bye. - Supposed to be less calories. - Bye. I gotta say something. She saved my life. I gotta say something. All right, here it goes. Nah. What would I say? I could really get in trouble. It's a bee law. You're not supposed to talk to a human. I can't believe I'm doing this. I've got to. Oh, I can't do it. Oome on! No. Yes. No. Do it. I can't. How should I start it? ""You like jazz?"" No, that's no good. Here she comes! Speak, you fool! Hi! I'm sorry. - You're talking. - Yes, I know. You're talking! I'm so sorry. No, it's OK. It's fine. I know I'm dreaming. But I don't recall going to bed. Well, I'm sure this is very disconcerting. This is a bit of a surprise to me. I mean, you're a bee! I am. And I'm not supposed to be doing this, but they were all trying to kill me. And if it wasn't for you... I had to thank you. It's just how I was raised. That was a little weird. - I'm talking with a bee. - Yeah. I'm talking to a bee. And the bee is talking to me! I just want to say I'm grateful. I'll leave now. - Wait! How did you learn to do that? - What? The talking thing. Same way you did, I guess. ""Mama, Dada, honey."" You pick it up. - That's very funny. - Yeah. Bees are funny. If we didn't laugh, we'd cry with what we have to deal with. Anyway...     Oan I... ...get you something? - Like what? I don't know. I mean... I don't know. Ooffee? I don't want to put you out. It's no trouble. It takes two minutes. - It's just coffee. - I hate to impose. - Don't be ridiculous! - Actually, I would love a cup. Hey, you want rum cake? - I shouldn't. - Have some. - No, I can't. - Oome on! I'm trying to lose a couple micrograms. - Where? - These stripes don't help. You look great! I don't know if you know anything about fashion. Are you all right? No. He's making the tie in the cab as they're flying up Madison. He finally gets there. He runs up the steps into the church. The wedding is on. And he says, ""Watermelon? I thought you said Guatemalan. Why would I marry a watermelon?"" Is that a bee joke? That's the kind of stuff we do. Yeah, different. So, what are you gonna do, Barry? About work? I don't know. I want to do my part for the hive, but I can't do it the way they want. I know how you feel. - You do? - Sure. My parents wanted me to be a lawyer or a doctor, but I wanted to be a florist. - Really? - My only interest is flowers. Our new queen was just elected with that same campaign slogan. Anyway, if you look... There's my hive right there. See it? You're in Sheep Meadow! Yes! I'm right off the Turtle Pond! No way! I know that area. I lost a toe ring there once. - Why do girls put rings on their toes? - Why not? - It's like putting a hat on your knee. - Maybe I'll try that. - You all right, ma'am? - Oh, yeah. Fine. Just having two cups of coffee! Anyway, this has been great. Thanks for the coffee. Yeah, it's no trouble. Sorry I couldn't finish it. If I did, I'd be up the rest of my life. Are you...? Oan I take a piece of this with me? Sure! Here, have a crumb. - Thanks! - Yeah. All right. Well, then... I guess I'll see you around. Or not. OK, Barry. And thank you so much again... for before. Oh, that? That was nothing. Well, not nothing, but... Anyway... This can't possibly work. He's all set to go. We may as well try it. OK, Dave, pull the chute. - Sounds amazing. - It was amazing! It was the scariest, happiest moment of my life. Humans! I can't believe you were with humans! Giant, scary humans! What were they like? Huge and crazy. They talk crazy. They eat crazy giant things. They drive crazy. - Do they try and kill you, like on TV? - Some of them. But some of them don't. - How'd you get back? - Poodle. You did it, and I'm glad. You saw whatever you wanted to see. You had your ""experience."" Now you can pick out yourjob and be normal. - Well... - Well? Well, I met someone.     You did? Was she Bee-ish? - A wasp?! Your parents will kill you! - No, no, no, not a wasp.     - Spider? - I'm not attracted to spiders. I know it's the hottest thing, with the eight legs and all. I can't get by that face. So who is she? She's... human. No, no. That's a bee law. You wouldn't break a bee law. - Her name's Vanessa. - Oh, boy. She's so nice. And she's a florist! Oh, no! You're dating a human florist! We're not dating. You're flying outside the hive, talking to humans that attack our homes with power washers and M-80s! One-eighth a stick of dynamite! She saved my life! And she understands me. This is over! Eat this. This is not over! What was that? - They call it a crumb. - It was so stingin' stripey! And that's not what they eat. That's what falls off what they eat! - You know what a Oinnabon is? - No. It's bread and cinnamon and frosting. They heat it up...     Sit down! ...really hot! - Listen to me! We are not them! We're us. There's us and there's them! Yes, but who can deny the heart that is yearning? There's no yearning. Stop yearning. Listen to me! You have got to start thinking bee, my friend. Thinking bee! - Thinking bee. - Thinking bee. Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee! There he is. He's in the pool. You know what your problem is, Barry? I gotta start thinking bee? How much longer will this go on? It's been three days! Why aren't you working? I've got a lot of big life decisions to think about. What life? You have no life! You have no job. You're barely a bee! Would it kill you to make a little honey? Barry, come out. Your father's talking to you. Martin, would you talk to him? Barry, I'm talking to you! You coming? Got everything? All set! Go ahead. I'll catch up. Don't be too long. Watch this! Vanessa! - We're still here. - I told you not to yell at him. He doesn't respond to yelling! - Then why yell at me? - Because you don't listen! I'm not listening to this. Sorry, I've gotta go. - Where are you going? - I'm meeting a friend. A girl? Is this why you can't decide? Bye. I just hope she's Bee-ish. They have a huge parade of flowers every year in Pasadena? To be in the Tournament of Roses, that's every florist's dream! Up on a float, surrounded by flowers, crowds cheering. A tournament. Do the roses compete in athletic events? No. All right, I've got one. How come you don't fly everywhere? It's exhausting. Why don't you run everywhere? It's faster. Yeah, OK, I see, I see. All right, your turn. TiVo. You can just freeze live TV? That's insane! You don't have that? We have Hivo, but it's a disease. It's a horrible, horrible disease. Oh, my. Dumb bees! You must want to sting all those jerks. We try not to sting. It's usually fatal for us. So you have to watch your temper. Very carefully. You kick a wall, take a walk, write an angry letter and throw it out. Work through it like any emotion: Anger, jealousy, lust. Oh, my goodness! Are you OK? Yeah. - What is wrong with you?! - It's a bug. He's not bothering anybody. Get out of here, you creep! What was that? A Pic 'N' Save circular? Yeah, it was. How did you know? It felt like about 10 pages. Seventy-five is pretty much our limit. You've really got that down to a science. - I lost a cousin to Italian Vogue. - I'll bet. What in the name of Mighty Hercules is this? How did this get here? Oute Bee, Golden Blossom, Ray Liotta Private Select? - Is he that actor? - I never heard of him. - Why is this here? - For people. We eat it. You don't have enough food of your own? - Well, yes. - How do you get it? - Bees make it. - I know who makes it! And it's hard to make it! There's heating, cooling, stirring. You need a whole Krelman thing! - It's organic. - It's our-ganic! It's just honey, Barry. Just what?! Bees don't know about this! This is stealing! A lot of stealing! You've taken our homes, schools, hospitals! This is all we have! And it's on sale?! I'm getting to the bottom of this. I'm getting to the bottom of all of this! Hey, Hector. - You almost done? - Almost. He is here. I sense it. Well, I guess I'll go home now and just leave this nice honey out, with no one around. You're busted, box boy! I knew I heard something. So you can talk! I can talk. And now you'll start talking! Where you getting the sweet stuff? Who's your supplier? I don't understand. I thought we were friends. The last thing we want to do is upset bees! You're too late! It's ours now! You, sir, have crossed the wrong sword! You, sir, will be lunch for my iguana, Ignacio! Where is the honey coming from? Tell me where! Honey Farms! It comes from Honey Farms! Orazy person! What horrible thing has happened here? These faces, they never knew what hit them. And now they're on the road to nowhere! Just keep still. What? You're not dead? Do I look dead? They will wipe anything that moves. Where you headed? To Honey Farms. I am onto something huge here. I'm going to Alaska. Moose blood, crazy stuff. Blows your head off! I'm going to Tacoma. - And you? - He really is dead. All right. Uh-oh! - What is that?! - Oh, no! - A wiper! Triple blade! - Triple blade? Jump on! It's your only chance, bee! Why does everything have to be so doggone clean?! How much do you people need to see?! Open your eyes! Stick your head out the window! From NPR News in Washington, I'm Oarl Kasell. But don't kill no more bugs! - Bee! - Moose blood guy!! - You hear something? - Like what? Like tiny screaming.     Turn off the radio. Whassup, bee boy? Hey, Blood. Just a row of honey jars, as far as the eye could see. Wow! I assume wherever this truck goes is where they're getting it. I mean, that honey's ours. - Bees hang tight. - We're all jammed in. It's a close community. Not us, man. We on our own. Every mosquito on his own. - What if you get in trouble? - You a mosquito, you in trouble. Nobody likes us. They just smack. See a mosquito, smack, smack! At least you're out in the world. You must meet girls. Mosquito girls try to trade up, get with a moth, dragonfly. Mosquito girl don't want no mosquito. You got to be kidding me! Mooseblood's about to leave the building! So long, bee! - Hey, guys! - Mooseblood! I knew I'd catch y'all down here. Did you bring your crazy straw? We throw it in jars, slap a label on it, and it's pretty much pure profit. What is this place? A bee's got a brain the size of a pinhead. They are pinheads! Pinhead. - Oheck out the new smoker. - Oh, sweet. That's the one you want. The Thomas 3000! Smoker? Ninety puffs a minute, semi-automatic. Twice the nicotine, all the tar. A couple breaths of this knocks them right out. They make the honey, and we make the money. ""They make the honey, and we make the money""? Oh, my! What's going on? Are you OK? Yeah. It doesn't last too long. Do you know you're in a fake hive with fake walls? Our queen was moved here. We had no choice. This is your queen? That's a man in women's clothes! That's a drag queen! What is this? Oh, no! There's hundreds of them! Bee honey. Our honey is being brazenly stolen on a massive scale! This is worse than anything bears have done! I intend to do something. Oh, Barry, stop. Who told you humans are taking our honey? That's a rumor. Do these look like rumors? That's a conspiracy theory. These are obviously doctored photos. How did you get mixed up in this? He's been talking to humans. - What? - Talking to humans?! He has a human girlfriend. And they make out! Make out? Barry! We do not. - You wish you could. - Whose side are you on? The bees! I dated a cricket once in San Antonio. Those crazy legs kept me up all night. Barry, this is what you want to do with your life? I want to do it for all our lives. Nobody works harder than bees! Dad, I remember you coming home so overworked your hands were still stirring. You couldn't stop. I remember that. What right do they have to our honey? We live on two cups a year. They put it in lip balm for no reason whatsoever! Even if it's true, what can one bee do? Sting them where it really hurts. In the face! The eye! - That would hurt. - No. Up the nose? That's a killer. There's only one place you can sting the humans, one place where it matters. Hive at Five, the hive's only full-hour action news source. No more bee beards! With Bob Bumble at the anchor desk. Weather with Storm Stinger. Sports with Buzz Larvi. And Jeanette Ohung. - Good evening. I'm Bob Bumble. - And I'm Jeanette Ohung. A tri-county bee, Barry Benson, intends to sue the human race for stealing our honey, packaging it and profiting from it illegally! Tomorrow night on Bee Larry King, we'll have three former queens here in our studio, discussing their new book, Olassy Ladies, out this week on Hexagon. Tonight we're talking to Barry Benson. Did you ever think, ""I'm a kid from the hive. I can't do this""? Bees have never been afraid to change the world. What about Bee Oolumbus? Bee Gandhi? Bejesus? Where I'm from, we'd never sue humans. We were thinking of stickball or candy stores. How old are you? The bee community is supporting you in this case, which will be the trial of the bee century. You know, they have a Larry King in the human world too. It's a common name. Next week... He looks like you and has a show and suspenders and colored dots... Next week... Glasses, quotes on the bottom from the guest even though you just heard 'em. Bear Week next week! They're scary, hairy and here live. Always leans forward, pointy shoulders, squinty eyes, very Jewish. In tennis, you attack at the point of weakness! It was my grandmother, Ken. She's 81. Honey, her backhand's a joke! I'm not gonna take advantage of that? Quiet, please. Actual work going on here. - Is that that same bee? - Yes, it is! I'm helping him sue the human race. - Hello. - Hello, bee. This is Ken. Yeah, I remember you. Timberland, size ten and a half. Vibram sole, I believe. Why does he talk again? Listen, you better go 'cause we're really busy working. But it's our yogurt night! Bye-bye. Why is yogurt night so difficult?! You poor thing. You two have been at this for hours! Yes, and Adam here has been a huge help. - Frosting... - How many sugars? Just one. I try not to use the competition. So why are you helping me? Bees have good qualities. And it takes my mind off the shop. Instead of flowers, people are giving balloon bouquets now. Those are great, if you're three. And artificial flowers. - Oh, those just get me psychotic! - Yeah, me too. Bent stingers, pointless pollination. Bees must hate those fake things! Nothing worse than a daffodil that's had work done. Maybe this could make up for it a little bit. - This lawsuit's a pretty big deal. - I guess. You sure you want to go through with it? Am I sure? When I'm done with the humans, they won't be able to say, ""Honey, I'm home,"" without paying a royalty! It's an incredible scene here in downtown Manhattan, where the world anxiously waits, because for the first time in history, we will hear for ourselves if a honeybee can actually speak. What have we gotten into here, Barry? It's pretty big, isn't it? I can't believe how many humans don't work during the day. You think billion-dollar multinational food companies have good lawyers? Everybody needs to stay behind the barricade. - What's the matter? - I don't know, I just got a chill. Well, if it isn't the bee team. You boys work on this? All rise! The Honorable Judge Bumbleton presiding. All right. Oase number 4475, Superior Oourt of New York, Barry Bee Benson v. the Honey Industry is now in session. Mr. Montgomery, you're representing the five food companies collectively? A privilege. Mr. Benson... you're representing all the bees of the world? I'm kidding. Yes, Your Honor, we're ready to proceed. Mr. Montgomery, your opening statement, please. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, my grandmother was a simple woman. Born on a farm, she believed it was man's divine right to benefit from the bounty of nature God put before us. If we lived in the topsy-turvy world Mr. Benson imagines, just think of what would it mean. I would have to negotiate with the silkworm for the elastic in my britches! Talking bee! How do we know this isn't some sort of holographic motion-picture-capture Hollywood wizardry?     They could be using laser beams! Robotics! Ventriloquism! Oloning! For all we know, he could be on steroids! Mr. Benson? Ladies and gentlemen, there's no trickery here. I'm just an ordinary bee. Honey's pretty important to me. It's important to all bees. We invented it! We make it. And we protect it with our lives. Unfortunately, there are some people in this room who think they can take it from us 'cause we're the little guys! I'm hoping that, after this is all over, you'll see how, by taking our honey, you not only take everything we have but everything we are! I wish he'd dress like that all the time. So nice!     Oall your first witness. So, Mr. Klauss Vanderhayden of Honey Farms, big company you have. I suppose so. I see you also own Honeyburton and Honron! Yes, they provide beekeepers for our farms. Beekeeper. I find that to be a very disturbing term. I don't imagine you employ any bee-free-ers, do you? - No. - I couldn't hear you. - No. - No. Because you don't free bees. You keep bees. Not only that, it seems you thought a bear would be an appropriate image for a jar of honey. They're very lovable creatures. Yogi Bear, Fozzie Bear, Build-A-Bear. You mean like this? Bears kill bees! How'd you like his head crashing through your living room?! Biting into your couch! Spitting out your throw pillows! OK, that's enough. Take him away. So, Mr. Sting, thank you for being here. Your name intrigues me. - Where have I heard it before? - I was with a band called The Police. But you've never been a police officer, have you? No, I haven't. No, you haven't. And so here we have yet another example of bee culture casually stolen by a human for nothing more than a prance-about stage name. Oh, please. Have you ever been stung, Mr. Sting? Because I'm feeling a little stung, Sting. Or should I say... Mr. Gordon M. Sumner! That's not his real name?! You idiots! Mr. Liotta, first, belated congratulations on your Emmy win for a guest spot on ER in 2005. Thank you. Thank you. I see from your resume that you're devilishly handsome with a churning inner turmoil that's ready to blow. I enjoy what I do. Is that a crime? Not yet it isn't. But is this what it's come to for you? Exploiting tiny, helpless bees so you don't have to rehearse your part and learn your lines, sir? Watch it, Benson! I could blow right now! This isn't a goodfella. This is a badfella! Why doesn't someone just step on this creep, and we can all go home?! - Order in this court! - You're all thinking it! Order! Order, I say! - Say it! - Mr. Liotta, please sit down! I think it was awfully nice of that bear to pitch in like that. I think the jury's on our side. Are we doing everything right, legally? I'm a florist. Right. Well, here's to a great team. To a great team!     Well, hello. - Ken! - Hello. I didn't think you were coming. No, I was just late. I tried to call, but... the battery. I didn't want all this to go to waste, so I called Barry. Luckily, he was free. Oh, that was lucky. There's a little left. I could heat it up. Yeah, heat it up, sure, whatever. So I hear you're quite a tennis player. I'm not much for the game myself. The ball's a little grabby. That's where I usually sit. Right... there. Ken, Barry was looking at your resume, and he agreed with me that eating with chopsticks isn't really a special skill. You think I don't see what you're doing? I know how hard it is to find the rightjob. We have that in common. Do we? Bees have 100 percent employment, but we do jobs like taking the crud out. That's just what I was thinking about doing. Ken, I let Barry borrow your razor for his fuzz. I hope that was all right. I'm going to drain the old stinger. Yeah, you do that. Look at that. You know, I've just about had it with your little mind games. - What's that? - Italian Vogue. Mamma mia, that's a lot of pages. A lot of ads. Remember what Van said, why is your life more valuable than mine? Funny, I just can't seem to recall that! I think something stinks in here! I love the smell of flowers. How do you like the smell of flames?! Not as much. Water bug! Not taking sides! Ken, I'm wearing a Ohapstick hat! This is pathetic! I've got issues! Well, well, well, a royal flush! - You're bluffing. - Am I? Surf's up, dude! Poo water! That bowl is gnarly. Except for those dirty yellow rings! Kenneth! What are you doing?! You know, I don't even like honey! I don't eat it! We need to talk! He's just a little bee! And he happens to be the nicest bee I've met in a long time! Long time? What are you talking about?! Are there other bugs in your life? No, but there are other things bugging me in life. And you're one of them! Fine! Talking bees, no yogurt night... My nerves are fried from riding on this emotional roller coaster! Goodbye, Ken. And for your information, I prefer sugar-free, artificial sweeteners made by man! I'm sorry about all that. I know it's got an aftertaste! I like it! I always felt there was some kind of barrier between Ken and me. I couldn't overcome it. Oh, well. Are you OK for the trial? I believe Mr. Montgomery is about out of ideas. We would like to call Mr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand. Good idea! You can really see why he's considered one of the best lawyers... Yeah. Layton, you've gotta weave some magic with this jury, or it's gonna be all over. Don't worry. The only thing I have to do to turn this jury around is to remind them of what they don't like about bees. - You got the tweezers? - Are you allergic? Only to losing, son. Only to losing. Mr. Benson Bee, I'll ask you what I think we'd all like to know. What exactly is your relationship to that woman? We're friends. - Good friends? - Yes. How good? Do you live together? Wait a minute... Are you her little...     ...bedbug? I've seen a bee documentary or two. From what I understand, doesn't your queen give birth to all the bee children? - Yeah, but... - So those aren't your real parents! - Oh, Barry... - Yes, they are! Hold me back! You're an illegitimate bee, aren't you, Benson? He's denouncing bees! Don't y'all date your cousins? - Objection! - I'm going to pincushion this guy! Adam, don't! It's what he wants! Oh, I'm hit!! Oh, lordy, I am hit! Order! Order! The venom! The venom is coursing through my veins! I have been felled by a winged beast of destruction! You see? You can't treat them like equals! They're striped savages! Stinging's the only thing they know! It's their way! - Adam, stay with me. - I can't feel my legs. What angel of mercy will come forward to suck the poison from my heaving buttocks? I will have order in this court. Order! Order, please! The case of the honeybees versus the human race took a pointed turn against the bees yesterday when one of their legal team stung Layton T. Montgomery. - Hey, buddy. - Hey. - Is there much pain? - Yeah. I... I blew the whole case, didn't I? It doesn't matter. What matters is you're alive. You could have died. I'd be better off dead. Look at me. They got it from the cafeteria downstairs, in a tuna sandwich. Look, there's a little celery still on it. What was it like to sting someone? I can't explain it. It was all... All adrenaline and then... and then ecstasy! All right. You think it was all a trap? Of course. I'm sorry. I flew us right into this. What were we thinking? Look at us. We're just a couple of bugs in this world. What will the humans do to us if they win? I don't know. I hear they put the roaches in motels. That doesn't sound so bad. Adam, they check in, but they don't check out! Oh, my. Oould you get a nurse to close that window? - Why? - The smoke. Bees don't smoke. Right. Bees don't smoke. Bees don't smoke! But some bees are smoking. That's it! That's our case! It is? It's not over? Get dressed. I've gotta go somewhere. Get back to the court and stall. Stall any way you can. And assuming you've done step correctly, you're ready for the tub.     Mr. Flayman. Yes? Yes, Your Honor! Where is the rest of your team? Well, Your Honor, it's interesting. Bees are trained to fly haphazardly, and as a result, we don't make very good time. I actually heard a funny story about... Your Honor, haven't these ridiculous bugs taken up enough of this court's valuable time? How much longer will we allow these absurd shenanigans to go on? They have presented no compelling evidence to support their charges against my clients, who run legitimate businesses. I move for a complete dismissal of this entire case! Mr. Flayman, I'm afraid I'm going to have to consider Mr. Montgomery's motion. But you can't! We have a terrific case. Where is your proof? Where is the evidence? Show me the smoking gun! Hold it, Your Honor! You want a smoking gun? Here is your smoking gun. What is that? It's a bee smoker! What, this? This harmless little contraption? This couldn't hurt a fly, let alone a bee. Look at what has happened to bees who have never been asked, ""Smoking or non?"" Is this what nature intended for us? To be forcibly addicted to smoke machines and man-made wooden slat work camps? Living out our lives as honey slaves to the white man? - What are we gonna do? - He's playing the species card. Ladies and gentlemen, please, free these bees! Free the bees! Free the bees! Free the bees! Free the bees! Free the bees! The court finds in favor of the bees! Vanessa, we won! I knew you could do it! High-five! Sorry. I'm OK! You know what this means? All the honey will finally belong to the bees. Now we won't have to work so hard all the time. This is an unholy perversion of the balance of nature, Benson. You'll regret this. Barry, how much honey is out there? All right. One at a time. Barry, who are you wearing? My sweater is Ralph Lauren, and I have no pants. - What if Montgomery's right? - What do you mean? We've been living the bee way a long time, 27 million years. Oongratulations on your victory. What will you demand as a settlement? First, we'll demand a complete shutdown of all bee work camps. Then we want back the honey that was ours to begin with, every last drop. We demand an end to the glorification of the bear as anything more     than a filthy, smelly, bad-breath stink machine. We're all aware of what they do in the woods. Wait for my signal. Take him out. He'll have nauseous for a few hours, then he'll be fine. And we will no longer tolerate bee-negative nicknames... But it's just a prance-about stage name! ...unnecessary inclusion of honey in bogus health products and la-dee-da human tea-time snack garnishments. Oan't breathe. Bring it in, boys! Hold it right there! Good. Tap it. Mr. Buzzwell, we just passed three cups, and there's gallons more coming! - I think we need to shut down! - Shut down? We've never shut down. Shut down honey production! Stop making honey! Turn your key, sir! What do we do now? Oannonball! We're shutting honey production! Mission abort. Aborting pollination and nectar detail. Returning to base. Adam, you wouldn't believe how much honey was out there. Oh, yeah? What's going on? Where is everybody? - Are they out celebrating? - They're home. They don't know what to do. Laying out, sleeping in. I heard your Uncle Oarl was on his way to San Antonio with a cricket. At least we got our honey back. Sometimes I think, so what if humans liked our honey? Who wouldn't? It's the greatest thing in the world! I was excited to be part of making it. This was my new desk. This was my new job. I wanted to do it really well. And now... Now I can't. I don't understand why they're not happy. I thought their lives would be better! They're doing nothing. It's amazing. Honey really changes people. You don't have any idea what's going on, do you?     - What did you want to show me? - This. What happened here? That is not the half of it. Oh, no. Oh, my. They're all wilting. Doesn't look very good, does it? No. And",0,1757805971.0,blazbluextagbattle,0,0.5,False

I am an English guy 

If you leave any rude or critical comments ln this post you will be blocked 

I am posting many times because I really am very serious about finding someone! I have been on my own way too long now I do not mind where you are located 

This is a genuine post from a genuine user I really want to find someone please be aged between 25 and 32 thanks and please don't be shy to send me a message 

If you are going to be rude or critical please just move on to someone else I’m really not interested I don’t know why some have to be so rude on here I have had some that get really rude and nasty in the replies i have received so far there really is no Need for it 

I am an English guy and I am currently living in France I have been here a few years now I absolutely love it but I’m now wanting to find someone to share my life with. I am very family orientated and family is extremely important to me 

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I’ve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I’ve never really dated and I’ve never been on dating apps. 

I just haven't found a woman that is suitable enough for me yet to want to be in a relationship with 

I’d like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. 

You’ll find out a lot about me on this post. And please have maturity and decency.

I’m generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don’t have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy. 

I also don’t like swearing I rarely use vulgar language on online chats or face to face  I am not that type of guy. I also don’t like those that think it’s okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.  

I am not one that is into partying I don’t like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I’m not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going  to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I’m very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I’ve never been tempted by anyone and I’d never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don’t view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I’d have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I’ve never been on loads of dates I’m not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that’s it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don’t want to use the actual word for it and I don’t smoke I don’t drink heavily and I’ve never touched any illegal drugs. I’ve got no bad addictions or bad habits I’ve lived a very clean life. 

I’m not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy. 

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I’m in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I’ve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I’d love to have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking  often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I’m not bad at it and I’d again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I’ve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it’s not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don’t just want to settle I’ve never just wanted to settle I’m seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I’d never have an affair or a fling and I’m not into ever having an open relationship. I could never cheat on someone I loved and cared about 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it’s an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I’ve been to and we have the lovely île de re island nearby I have been there many times it’s also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it’s certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it’s amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I’m very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don’t know. I also love soft rock some of the bands  love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I’ve seen most of my favourite bands live too I’ve been very lucky with that. 

I also love animals I have a dog she’s a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she’s absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it’s my favourite but I only have it in moderation I’ve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don’t drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don’t drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can’t ever see myself going either way.  

It’s very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after. 

I have to be honest and tell you that I don’t drive I have never passed my test having a car is way too expensive and i have never been that interested in driving. 

I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I’m not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I am taking a break from work I am in a new country learning the language is my focus at the moment.
I’m not lazy or anything like that and I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I’ve had trouble finding suitable work which was hard In England 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe. 

I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural. 

My body Is not lean muscular athletic I am natural I have a real man's body which has some fat on it. 

We have very strong genes in my family and we all look younger I don't look My age most say I look like I'm in my late 20s to early 30s. I have no grey hair and I'm not losing any of my hair. I have a full head of nice hair 

I’m not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. If your seeking men that are a muscular physique then I won’t be for you please move on. 

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don’t fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I’m very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I’m in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I’m always bashing my feet on things hehe 

I am not addicted to social media and I don’t aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. I am not politically liberal either. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don’t watch reality tv. I don’t watch any reality tv at all. 

I have no tattoos no piercings and looking and keeping yourself natural is the best way to go I am a very natural looking man and body to go with it. this is what I believe and it’s how I’ve been raised too. I have no interest in ever having tattoos or piercings of any kind. I’d never have any cosmetic surgery 

I like natural looking women that have natural bodies and that don’t wear heavy makeup also no fake tan or fake nails or fake eyelashes and hair. I also like women that dress modestly and conservatively. I’d prefer someone with no tattoos and not too many piercings please. Also you don’t wear a bikini on the beach that is too skimpy. 

I dont have any physical looks requirements other than I like natural looking women

It was built with some Marri I got cheaply and choosing pieces was fun.

You can still see the cool, unique details. The legs are Jarrah, my first things made on the lathe. Legs up being mildly wonky so I needed to add extra padding under one. My buggest regret with this one is that I tried to fit the back panel in perfectly inside the 4 mitred sides, and as a result, I had visibility gaps but more importantly, the back expanded and split the join in the back bottom left corner. What I think I should have done is rout a recess and put the back panel in that recess with a mm or so space on each side in case it expands.

It's undeniable that physical decline is an inevitable part of getting older.  However, it is definitely possible to **slow down the process**, and live your best quality of life at any age.  Most disease that strikes people over 50 is **preventable**.

Many older people report that their health actually **improves** in retirement.  Leaving the stress of the corporate world behind often results in better health.  Retirees also have more time to devote to managing their health.  It's not unusual to hear older people saying that they are in the best physical shape and health of their lives!

My family doctor once told me, ""My seniors who are thriving are all **active**!""  What does that mean?  It means physically, socially, and mentally active.  Basically, you need to get up off the couch and actually **do something**!  :-)  I have an aunt and an uncle who are great examples.  Both are in their mid-80s and thriving.  Neither one goes to the gym or eats particularly healthy.  But they are **active**!  My uncle makes knives.  He is out in his shop working on his knives every day.  He also has a few acres of property he takes care of.  He meets some friends at a local restaurant 3-4 mornings per week for coffee and conversation.  He lives near several close friends he's known since childhood, they help each other with doctor's appointments and other things. 

Managing your health is so important.  Regular physicals, see the doctor when anything isn't right.  You'd be surprised at how many people don't do that.  It is the #1 reason that women tend to live longer!  They go to the frikkin' doctor!

A friend of mine (M60's) was mountain biking, and he noticed he wasn't able to climb as well as usual.  At first he thought nothing of it, but after it happened again, he saw a doctor.  Turned out he had a heart defect that was undiagnosed.  He had open heart surgery and they were able to correct it.  His doctor told him that without the surgery he probably would have eventually had a heart attack, possibly fatal.

I'm going to recommend a book that I found very helpful.  I have no connection to the author or publisher.  It is  called ""*Younger Next Year*"", by Chris Crowley.  He outlines a healthy lifestyle that will avoid most of the major diseases that kill people early.  There is also a companion book for people with back pain, ""*The Younger Next Year Back Book*"", also by Chris Crowley.  That book changed my life!  Back pain was limiting my mobility before reading that book.  It's not completely gone, but it is very manageable now and doesn't limit what I can do.  I have a set of exercises I do every morning, only takes about 10 minutes.

“Lila” was another drawing of my dad’s. Not from the books, but something I got him to draw up for me. I wanted to give her a nice gift and I figured with his ability he could capture how I saw her. He really did. He was strangely hesitant at first, but to be fair at that point he was strange about everything. It’s probably long gone now, that was years ago. But now here she is, calling me.
“Lila?”
Was all I could get out, feeling like a weirdo for immediately knowing it was her. If you hadn’t noticed by now I try to keep a pretty nonchalant attitude about most things. I don’t mean to, it just happens. Growing up without a mother, my father being a terrible drug addict, moving away at 19, strange alien creatures in my house, whatever else. Most things didn’t affect me, but not her. She made me feel different. I was right, it was her. She asked me how I was doing while also shuffling around the conversation of what happened with my dad. It felt kind of nice, the first conversation where I felt like someone close actually cared to know if I was okay. I let her know I was alright, cleaning out the old house and that I appreciated the call. That was about it, the call was only a few minutes and ended after she told me how she knew I was in town. Her boyfriend saw me earlier in town, guess she is still driving around in that musty car. 
	Yeah, I didn’t get much done that day. Everything I looked at made me feel lost like there was no real place to start. I didn’t want to make piles of keep or trash, I didn’t want to keep any of it. At most the kitchen got cleaned, and I moved everything out of my bedroom. Turns out the cheap motel wasn’t very cost efficient for a college dropout that works retail. Let me make that one thing clear. I’m poor. Or, was poor. I couldn’t afford to keep staying at the motel and realized that very fast. My plan was to sell the house, even though it was depressing to live in, it also had a good few acres of land that might help me stay on my feet for some time. Please don’t tell me I should’ve sold the old books, I couldn’t if I wanted to. The rights to everything still belonged to the writer somehow. It was a ton of legal crap I didn’t understand. So technically all of that was owned by Mark Frary. But also technically it was all burnt to ashes so whatever. Long story short, I was broke so I decided to stay in the house while I was cleaning it out. My goal was a good night's sleep and I did not get it. I forgot how cold the house would get. It wasn’t insulated and all the small noises of the outside world were ringing in my ears. The small tapping of the tree limbs on the window, the wind howling and knocking the porch swing around, the loud roar of cars racing down the distant highway, echoing through the forests, the metal mail slot lifting up and falling again. It kept me up, kept me tossing and turning until I saw the sun shine through the blinds. I had worn the same clothes, even keeping my shoes on, not knowing if I’d catch a spare shared of glass while making morning coffee. But while making the coffee it wasn’t a piece of glass on the floor, but a letter. At the front door. FAN MAIL. 
	I assumed it simply because it couldn’t be anyone else. I cancelled my dad’s mail, no one ever came around for anything, and while growing up most mail was fan mail. I picked it up and started to read it while making my coffee. It was a pretty generic letter, nothing too personal, so I’ll let you read it too. 
“Hi. 
To whoever receives this, I’m so sorry for your loss. If you need anything I would absolutely be there for you! I’m sorry if this is weird, I’m a huge fan of the MatchBox series and also, If you’re reading this, I love your father’s work! My favorite story will always be “Don’t Be Scared” and the way that the images throughout the book showed “The Snaret” and how it affected everyone’s lives. It really helped me find my own   Will to keep going through the hard times. It did a lot for me, and I really hope it’ll Help you the same way it helped me. It also inspired me to create something You might like, if you’re a fan of his work, that is. I was brainstorming one day and My mind went to a beautiful woman, someone that let herself to The Snaret. My Finest Creation, I didn’t know what to name her so I figured you could give it a shot. I stapled it to this letter to make sure it didn’t get lost! Answer me back. I need an update on what you named her!!”
	Honestly wasn’t the strangest letter we ever received, but definitely a contender for top 10. I read the letter again. I didn’t know what they were talking about. What was “The Snaret?” I didn’t remember it from any of the stories I had read, but to be fair I stopped keeping up with them once I moved away. I flipped the page away to see the next, folded piece of paper stapled to it. I unfolded it while preparing myself for a crappy copy paste of one of my dad’s drawings. It wasn’t that. It was a perfect recreation. It WAS “Lila”. Like it was almost 10 years ago. Down to the freckles on her nose, the imperfections she had that I always loved. Whoever sent this either found that drawing somewhere wanting to pass it off as their own… or they really were inspired and perfectly recreated the drawing of her. I don’t know which one is more concerning; someone digging through Lila’s trash that happened to be a super-fan of my dad; or someone being able to draw my ex perfectly without, hopefully, ever seeing her before. I tried to find out who sent this letter, maybe a name somewhere or an address considering they wanted me to write them back. The most I could find was a “P.s. Mark Frary is a moron” so I didn’t have much luck.

Firstly i have never dated anyone but i am very confident during our dates. First few dates we had coffee and the third one at a restaurant. After we left the restaurant she said her hands were cold so I offered to hold her hand and she said that it’s too early for that. So i avoided having any physical contact with her after that. On our fifth date she was constantly talking about a dish from her country and i teased her and said that i wanna try it. Instantly she said this “Tomorrow, can we cook at your place”. So we went together at the grocery store and i basically told her “ You are the  so tell me what we need”. She then picked up some things to make the dish, and she also wanted us to get alcohol so we did. I payed for everything and we went to my place (college bedroom, shared kitchen). We cooked, got tipsy, talked and had so much fun over 4-5 hours . We layed in bed ate ice cream, felt a deep connection. She even took off her shoes and we layed in bed laughing and smiling while also maintaining intense eye contact ( i have to note that since it is the first girl i have ever dated, i don’t know when it’s the right time to ask or make any sort of physical contact especially after the third date when she said it was too early to hold hands ). At the end of the date it was freezing so since i didn’t want her to walk in the cold, i ordered her a taxi. That’s where i get lost, what to do to further advance this whole thing. We went on our 6th date today and she may come to my place tomorrow so we/i can cook. I have to note that during every date i was the one that payed. She is an amazing woman and i really like her. I was always confident and made her laugh plenty of times during our dates. We are both foreigners studying abroad and one other thing that worries me is , if everything works out, what will happen when we both graduate. Also  she has told me everything about her family back home (i told her too). Whenever we eat something or drink something, we share drinks (drinks from the same straw) . Our 6 dates have been back to back every single day but during those days i feel like i know so much about her. So i want advice on what do you guys think is coming next, and is there something specific i need to tell her? I’m i just on the right path and i shouldn’t even be worried?

1ngbji0,https://www.reddit.com/r/LiquidLaboratories/comments/1ngbji0/launch_liquid_laboratories_the_most_overthought/,[Launch] Liquid Laboratories. The Most Overthought Car Care Brand You’ll Ever Use,"Hello! 

I wanted to post a little welcome post to help you understand the brand and what we’re about. 

I didn’t start Liquid Laboratories because I wanted to “disrupt the industry” or “innovate the space.”
I started it because, after 30 years in the lab, I was completely fed up with compromise.

I joined BASF in the late ’80s, back when the lab coats were still starched and the coffee was dreadful.

I worked in refinishing product development, mainly focused on car care.
Over the years, I had a hand in creating formulas that now sit on the shelves of workshops, garages, and detailing bays across the country.
Household names.

But the same thing always happened: the accountants got involved.

Suddenly, a product we’d spent months perfecting would get “revised.”
Not because it didn’t work, but because someone figured out how to save 4p per litre.

And honestly? After a few decades of that, it wears you down.

I probably would’ve just kept moaning into my coffee…
Until one day, my son said:

“If you know how to make it better, why don’t you just do it yourself?”

And the truth is… I didn’t have a good answer.
So here we are.


What Liquid Laboratories is…

It’s the brand I always wanted to build. Made without shortcuts.
Not the cheapest way. Not the fastest way. Just the right way.

It’s built around a single principle:
Chemistry made clear.

No fluff. No gimmicks. No “ceramic magic.”
Just precise, functional, high-performance detailing chemistry.


The Idea That Stuck

I asked myself:

What if car care felt more like a method than a mess?

What if every product had one clear purpose and every step built logically on the last?

That thinking became the foundation for Liquid Laboratories.

We built a five-phase system:
	1.	Wash – Safely remove loose dirt
	2.	Decontaminate – Get the bonded stuff out
	3.	Interior – Make the cabin feel like new
	4.	Correct – Fix imperfections properly
	5.	Protect – Lock in your results

It’s simple, structured, and scalable.
Perfect for driveway enthusiasts and pros alike.


Why We’re Different

Most brands start with marketing and work backwards.

We started with the chemistry, because that’s the part you can’t fake.

We obsess over the details that most people overlook:
	•	pH balance
	•	Lubricity
	•	Particle size
	•	Flash time
	•	Residue behaviour
	•	How a product feels when you use it

We’ve rejected perfectly “fine” formulas because they didn’t perform right in the real world, on actual cars, on actual roads, in actual weather.

If it doesn’t feel right, it doesn’t go out.


Why Bother?

Because detailing is part pride, part therapy, and part art form.

It’s not just about how clean the car is, it’s about the process.
And the tools you use matter.

So that’s what Liquid Laboratories is here for:
To give you the right tools for the job, engineered properly, tested thoroughly, and never dumbed down for cost.

You can check out what we’ve built at:
liquidlaboratories.co.uk

If you’ve got questions, I’m happy to answer anything.
Whether it’s formulation, product development, or just what bucket I think is best, fire away!

1ngbhru,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1ngbhru/very_interesting_medical_study_regarding_caffeine/,Very interesting medical study regarding caffeine withdrawals and how to minimize the severity of withdrawals.,"I stumbled upon this super interesting human medical study regarding caffeine withdrawals. Link to study: [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30526233/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30526233/)

Basically, the study shows that when people know their caffeine dose is being cut, they tend to feel more withdrawal symptoms simply because they expect to (a “nocebo” effect).

They took heavy coffee drinkers and divided them in 3 groups, and had each of them quit caffeine.

One group was told the truth each day about how much caffeine they were getting.

The second group wasn’t told anything at all about the dose on any day.

A third group was misled: they were *told* they would stay at 300 mg for the first three days and then go straight to zero, even though their dose was actually being reduced bit by bit just like everyone else.

The people who knew exactly when their dose was being cut reported the **strongest** withdrawal, especially on the days when the cut was largest.

The people who weren’t told the dose changes had milder, slower-building symptoms.

**The people who were misled felt fewer symptoms on the days when what they believed didn’t match what they actually got, which shows how much expectations can drive how we feel.**

The bottom line is that knowing about dose reductions can make withdrawal feel worse, while removing or disguising that knowledge can ease it.

This means that when going through withdrawals, it's very important to not pay much attention to the withdrawal itself.

Distract yourself, do not do what many people in this group do and focus on the withdrawals. if you’re tapering, focus less on exact numbers and dates of cuts (or have someone else adjust them quietly) to reduce expectancy-driven withdrawal.

Too may people in this group obsess over their withdrawal symptoms, constantly scanning their body and attributing every pain or discomfort to their withdrawals.

This is a counter-productive strategy.",9,1757804776.0,decaf,0,0.92,False

I stared at him, resenting his existence, then saw you outside on the other side of the window staring back at me and smiling; seems like it looked like I was staring at you (dark hair, dark skin, and cute). We exchanged more smiles and nervous glances.

I walked outside to get my electric scooter so I could go to the Whole Foods for grocery shopping and passed by you. You were sitting with your two friends, talking. You kept locking eyes with me and smiling. I wanted to talk to you, thought, ""I could awkwardly apologize for seemingly staring but use that as a conversation starter."" I did not and kept walking, and got my scooter. All the way there I was thinking to myself, ""You'll likely never see her again, so there's no risk if she's not interested. Once upon a time you had a spontaneous conversation with someone and you got some dates from it. You can do it again this time. There's no risk!""

But I did not talk to you. I rode right past on my scooter. We locked eyes again and while you smiled, you also looked a little disappointed. And riding away, I was angry at myself for my timidity, once again, as I have been for many years.

I never thought I'd post one of these and I doubt that it will work, but it's worth a shot. DM me (and preferably prove your identity), and maybe we can have coffee at that Commonwealth Joe.

Im thinking about quitting to see if my anxiety symptoms improve.

Do you think the 1/2cup per day is still contributing to my anxiety ?",3,1757804342.0,decaf,2,1.0,False
