1n6u47p,https://v.redd.it/6niippzb6tmf1,Here in Gaza you have to think a million times before making a cup of coffee.üòîüíî,"I cannot describe the suffering of preparing a cup of coffee...the suffering of obtaining firewood...breaking the firewood...lighting the fire...the sound of planes above you in the sky...obtaining water, the high price of coffee, its scarcity in the markets, and much, much suffering.

My name is **Mohammed Mazen**, I am 20 years old and I live in northern Gaza.
I graduated from high school with an excellent grade and I was so proud to start my studies in Computer Engineering at the university. I was supposed to be finishing my second year now, but the war destroyed my dreams, my university, and my future.

During the war I lost my father and my older brother. They were the main source of income for our family. Now I live with my mother and my younger siblings, and we have no support, no income, and no home. Our house, my warm room, my books, and all my memories were reduced to rubble. Every day I cry remembering my father and my brother.

We are living in extreme hunger. In the north of Gaza, there is almost no food. Many times we had to grind animal feed and eat it because there was no flour or bread. Life here is very hard and as a young man I cannot continue my education or find work to help my family.

A kind friend from Italy, Silvia, helped me to create this fundraising link to save me and my family from starvation. My dream is to continue my studies, to find safety, and to build a future like other young people my age.

Please, if you can, help us survive and give us a chance to live with dignity again.

1n6u3v2,https://www.reddit.com/r/infinitenines/comments/1n6u3v2/the_contract_of_infinite_long_division_a_short/,The contract of infinite long division - a short story,"The protagonists of our story are Alice and Bob. Alice is a woman who studied math many years ago, but Bob, on the other hand, is a very recent graduate of the u/SouthPark_Piano school of Real Deal Math 101.

**7:00 AM**

The scene opens in a kitchen on a Monday morning, at 7:00 AM. The coffee is brewing. Alice, seeking to divide a muffin into three equal parts, turns to Bob and states a simple, elegant truth: ""Let x = 1/3.""

""Ah!"", declares Bob, seizing a notepad. ""Allow me to write that down in a more¬†practical¬†form using its alternate decimal representation: zero point three --"" And with those words, he unknowingly signs a contract of infinite long division. Bob does not believe in ellipses anymore. To him, they are a lie. A concession. If one is to write¬†`0.333...`, those threes won't write themselves. It is a verb, not a noun.

**7:01 AM**

At 7:01 AM, a divergence starts to show. Alice has already multiplied x it by 3, arriving at a clean, satisfying 1, and has moved on to multiplying the bread length by¬†1/7¬†to get one week worth of bread slices.

Bob, meanwhile, is hunched over the table, his hand a frantic blur. He has just meticulously inscribed his 53rd consecutive '3'. A tiny bead of sweat traces a path down his temple. He knows, in the caverns of his soul where reason still faintly echoes, that he will never reach 1/3. He is chasing a limit, a horizon that recedes with every step he takes.

**7:02 AM**

The gap between their realities is now a vast gulf. Alice has algebraically leaped from 1/3 to 1 to 1/7 and is now pondering the transcendental nature of œÄ as it relates to muffin circumference. She is a manipulating concepts with graceful efficiency.

Bob's long division has not yet reached a hundred digits past the decimal point. The kitchen counter is beginning to disappear under an endless scroll of threes. The single muffin sits between them, untouched, a monument to this futile exercise. It is no longer a snack; it is the subject of a mathematical feud.

**7:03 AM**

A moment of clarity strikes Bob. Perhaps his wrist is cramping. Perhaps he sees the look of utter derision on Alice's face. He pauses, looks up from his parchment now stretching into the living room, and makes a desperate bid for peace.

""You know, Alice,"" he ventures, his voice hoarse from counting. ""How about we... agree... that 0.333... with the ellipses... is exactly equal to 1/3? As a formality? A sort of gentleman's agreement to stop this madness?""

Alice regarded him coolly. She said nothing. Instead, she slowly began to raise her right hand.

Her middle finger began to ascend. 

First, it raised to 1/2 of its full, glorious height.

Then, it added another 1/4 of the remaining distance.

Then, an 1/8.

Then, a 1/16.

It was moving faster and faster, asymptotically approaching the absolute, upright zenith of contempt. To Bob, a disciple of the the Real Deal Math, the finger was always moving, always getting closer, but the math he learned assured him the finger would never quite reach its complete and total expression.

As the finger reached 99.999...% of its height, Alice said ""I am late for work"".",2,1756843754.0,infinitenines,0,1.0,False
1n6u3fr,https://www.reddit.com/r/LakeDistrict/comments/1n6u3fr/has_anyone_else_noticed_theres_something_weird/,Has anyone else noticed theres something weird about the elderly people in the lake district?,"I am not sure if this is the right place to post this but I wanted to see if anyone has had a similar experience to what happened to me recently in the lake district. 
Recently, me and a few others took a journey up to the lake district. A girls trip, as my friend had gone through a messy breakup with her boyfriend a needed a few days away from our town. We set off on a Wednesday at around 9:30 am and was set to get there around 5 pm. But after multiple rest stops it was looking like we wouldn‚Äôt be there until 7.
We got to our last rest stop at around 6:30 as Ella was about to wet herself. My other two friends that came on this trip (Josie and Iris) went in with her to get snacks and alcohol for our night of shit talking men in our lives and doing other girly things of the sort. I wanted a smoke before we carried on the trip so I pulled out my pack and began to inhale large pulls of sweet sweet nicotine. I know smoking is bad and all but life‚Äôs a bitch and then you die so might as well enjoy the time as much as possible. I looked around and noticed that diagonal to me, roughly 10 feet away, was a bench housing 4 old people sitting and staring at me. I am not a stranger to the elderly having long staring fits at me, I have lots of tattoos, dyed hair and my shorts are never below my knees. But this time their stares felt different I guess? Their eyes bore into me like I was some abomination come to rid them from this world and their scowls were worst. Normally what I do in these situations is stare back until they break eye contact, as I am not going to let some old hags make me feel uncomfortable for just existing. However, I just couldn‚Äôt bring myself to keep that same confidence with these women. They continued to stare, to kiss their teeth and tut at me while I dragged another pull of my fag. Every so often I would look back at them and their faces were the very definition of ‚Äúif looks could kill.‚Äù My friends came back soon after, chipper and ready for a night we would be unable to remember come morning. They began walking up to me , then past, expecting me to follow. When I didn‚Äôt Josie turned back and said ‚Äúwhat are you waiting for? Christmas?‚Äù
I turned to face her ‚Äúyeah, Im coming Im coming.‚Äù But when I looked back round, the old women who were just sitting there, like statues never polished, had stood up. They where inhumanly straight, their postures where all the same. You ever seen when a cat gets scared and get all rigid and look like they aren‚Äôt even breathing. It was exactly like that. I was so shocked by their sudden movement that I almost tripped backwards onto the road. I composed myself and began walking away, looking back every few seconds to make sure that they weren‚Äôt actually weeping angels. Once we all pilled into the car I told them about the creepy old women in the smoking area. Iris was really the only one to give me an answer apart from the odd ‚Äúyeah old people do that‚Äù stuff. She began ‚Äúpeople up here are strange, i‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs because they are northern or we are just rude Londoners, but they‚Äôve got to stop staring like that.‚Äù I asked her what she meant and if she has had people‚Äôs look at her for a bit too long as well, but in response she pointed out of the car window and as I followed her finger I saw that the four women where now at the edge of the curb looking at our car. We arrived at the place we would be staying not even 40 minutes later than the service station incident. But after some joking around in the car about the situation it left my mind as I rationalised it as another group of old people being odd, as they tend to be. Where we were staying was a lot of 10 wood cabins and not even 20 feet away was a hotel with a bar and restaurant. It was perfect. Secluded enough that you feel detached from society, but with flushing toilets, hot showers and alcohol. Once getting the keys for our cabins we unpacked and chose beds. I was in a room with Josie, in this room was a vanity, wardrobe and two single beds and in the other room, where Iris and Ella were sleeping, was a double bed that they would be sharing. This will become relevant later down the line. It was a beautiful cabin with dark wood and old curtains that you would tend to find in your grandparents house. Ella was the first to grab a Bacardi cocktail out of the mini fridge and announce that we all must have one. ‚ÄúI think we should all get as shit faced as possible and deal with consequences tomorrow over a fry up!‚Äù She chipperly said like it was the next best thing after the lord and saviour himself. As shattered as I was I thought a few drinks would help me sleep. Oh how wrong I was. We all ended up doing exactly as we had planned earlier, drinking until we were like a pack of hyenas yipping and yapping about traumas and men. We played cards against humanity and other games of the sort that are only funny while being that level of not sober. Around 5 in the morning people started to hobble off to bed. There was a private porch connected to the cabin with a little seating area, perfect for watching the sunrise. I sat, pulling out another cigarette and lit it. The dim glow of amber combined with the thin speckles of sun peaking through the tree line made for a sight that would make even the most homesick people want to adventure. I took drag after drag and when just the butt remained I stumped it out in the ashtray and got up to go to bed. But as I stood, I caught something in the corner of my eye, for a second and just a split second it looked like a fully naked old woman running on all fours away from the tree line. I stood there, a frozen state of shock and just stared to where I thought I saw the figure dart off into woods. I didn‚Äôt even consider that I had stopped breathing or even blinking. But there was nothing. Not a sound. I would have presumed that I would hear the crunching of leaves and the snapping of twigs. Maybe even heavy breathing. But nothing. I concluded that the alcohol combined with my earlier experience was creating a sleep deprived hallucination that was nothing short of just my brain playing tricks on me. In hindsight, with what I now know, I wish we got in the car and raced back home never going back to the lake district. I went to bed, locking all the doors on my way to my room and crashed. It took me seconds to fall asleep. But I had the most awful nightmare. I was standing in a clearing of a mountain range. Forest spanned as far as the eye could see. In front of me was the mouth of a cave. I could hear dripping from inside and feel the cool breeze coming from the depths, hitting my face. The way it made me feel, even in my dream, was this deep guttural fear that shrouded my entire body. I felt my veins tense in my skin and my muscles contract ready for me to flee, like the quite mouse sneaking away from the hungry feline. Then I heard it. From deep inside. It started as just a murmur, but grew and grew until it was finally established within my ears. I felt my body collapse, like a piece of paper being screwed up and torn. You may ask what could this cave have said to me, in a dream no less, that I woke up covered in sweat and crying. Racing to the bathroom to stop my wails from waking my friends. The cave spoke with the voice of my late grandmother, all it spoke ‚Äúshe‚Äôs watching you breathe.‚Äù After I had stopped crying from the fear of such a horrible dream I knew I wouldn‚Äôt sleep again. I showered and dressed before waking my friends up with hot chocolate and coffee so they can actually survive a day with undeniable hangovers they would have. I did not tell anyone about the dream I had, instead I decided it was just because I was in a place I hadn‚Äôt been before and I always have weird dreams after drinking sessions. We decided that day we would go on a hike up the orrest head trail, near lake windermere. It was supposed to take us through the forest, roughly a mile and a half , up to a clearing where you could see fields for miles. We set off in the car and took the 20 minute drive to the little town where we would start out trail. It was a beautiful walk through the forest, it had recently rained so dew drops coated every inch making the whole forest shine. The sun beamed between the leaves creating a disco of sorts on the forest floor and the sweet smell of moss and dust in the air after rain just fell created an environment that I could not get enough of. We came across a fallen tree, it was more of a thick branch but we could see the roots where it was connected. It was covered in a hundred or so bronze pennies all hammered into the bark. It almost resembled a disease of some sort, like warts growing from skin. I ran my fingers along them and the copper smell lingered there. We had no idea what this was for, maybe for good luck? In some fountains people toss a pound in to make a wish so maybe this was the same case. Josie joked about taking one for a souvenir as some of the pennies looked old. Iris said ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt, we don‚Äôt know what kind of curse that would give us.‚Äù 
I agreed saying ‚Äúyeah, leave that shit alone, I don‚Äôt feel like becoming a statistic on some podcast.‚Äù We laughed and continued on through the forest. About half way up we bumped into two young girls, no older than 14, looking very flustered hurrying down the path back towards town. One stepped on a rather round and wet rock, she slipped right on her arse and in a normal circumstance I would just laugh in my head and keep walking. But she looked like she hit the ground hard and landed quite near me. I helped her up and said ‚Äúhow was your trip?‚Äù (British humour is the worst I know) but instead of laughing and dusting her self off she looks at me and said ‚Äúhave you seen them?‚Äù 
‚ÄúWho?‚Äù I said extremely puzzled
She stopped speaking and smiled, her eyes where full of tears though. Like a kid who scraped their knee but is trying to seem brave. She stuttered out ‚Äúsorry.. I uhh don‚Äôt know what you mean,I need to, we gotta, uhhmm  get back to town but hope you see what you want!‚Äù With that her and her friend linked arms and swiftly went on their way. I turned to my friends. Josie was looking at the girls a little judgmental ‚Äúwho wears crocs to hike?‚Äù She shrugged and turned to continue up the path. I looked to the other two to get even a slight conformation that I wasn‚Äôt just going mental and that they heard that too. Iris spoke first ‚Äúwhats wrong? what did she say?‚Äù 
I said ‚Äúshe asked me if I had seen ‚Äúthem‚Äù fucking weird right?‚Äù 
Ella chipped in ‚Äúprobably just on shrooms, I hear a lot of people come up here to do them and look at nature.‚Äù 
‚ÄúYeah maybe, but still creepy‚Äù I said.
With that we continued on our way. The view at the top of the hike made me forget all about the previous interaction, the sky and the hill met and the sun made the grass look golden. The fields rolled on for miles and it took my breath away. I loved nature, it made me feel small but in the good way, like I was a piece in something much bigger. I loved the freedom it offered me and how I felt like I could run for miles and never bump into a road or a person again. The walk back down was much quicker than the walk up. The thought of a cheese toasties and vodka redbulls in pyjamas fulled all our ambitions to get back to the car. After another night of drinking and laughing, sharing pictures of the day, Iris sent me a cute picture of me standing with the fields in the background. However, I noticed a weird creamy speak far off in the picture. I zoomed in to it as far as it would let me. Standing there, arms outstretched to the side, like a human cross, was a fully naked woman. Her face was either too blurred to see or she.. she didn‚Äôt have one. I showed all of my friends with a horrified look on my face, not even speaking. I waited for their response. Ella laughed and said ‚Äúfucking crazy tree hugger, god what is wrong with the north.‚Äù
I replied ‚Äúwhat the fuck? this isn‚Äôt normal why is she just.. standing there.‚Äù
Iris spoke not missing a beat ‚ÄúI have seen tree huggers and people who get their rocks off too nature before. Its not uncommon for them to be in naked groups in secluded places being ‚Äúone with nature.‚Äù But I ain‚Äôt seen that before.‚Äù
I looked back at Ella with a face that said ‚Äúsee!‚Äù But she just rolled her eyes and said ‚Äúits just a crazy person. Its fine.‚Äù
Josie looked up from the picture and said ‚Äúwell we are like 10 miles from there so naky woman cant molest you.‚Äù
We all laughed at this comment but the feeling still lingered in the air.
We drank some more, smoked a splif and decided that it was time to sleep. We all got into bed and I doomscrolled for a while before dozing off somewhere around 1 am. 
I woke up hazy, like something woke me up. I wasn‚Äôt sure what exactly. But then I heard it, tap‚Ä¶tap‚Ä¶tap‚Ä¶tap. At first I thought it was water dripping into the bath but I heard it again. The same rhythmic tapping sounds, I sat up slowly listening to where the sound was coming from. I thought about waking Josie who was sleeping soundly with ear defenders on in the bed opposite me. But, I made the stupid mistake of investigating myself. I walked into the front room where there was a sliding glass door that led to the porch. The curtains where drawn, but I could tell there was a presence on the other side of the glass, tapping and luring me in closer. I knew the door was locked so that made me feel slightly better, but the feeling of needing to see what was there was so overwhelming. I tiptoed closer to the curtains, my fingers wrapped around the fabric, it felt soft and cold in my hand and I tensed before ripping the curtains open expecting to see michael or freddy on the other side. But instead there was just the dark and the trees. The moon shone down bright through the windows and I sighed the biggest breath of relief. But the moonlight reflected on something. The wooden porch shone with tiny wet pools. Thats when I realised what they where. Bare wet fucking footprints. They went from the door, to window, back to the fucking door before going down the steps and after that I couldn‚Äôt see where they lead. I slammed the curtains back closed and thought ‚Äúabsolutely fucking not‚Äù before retreating back to my room and locking the door. I didn‚Äôt sleep the rest of that night, too paranoid that some naked killer would break in and I would taken in my sleep. Once the sun came up I woke up all the girls and told them what I saw. We went out to the porch but the sun had dried up any trace of the footsteps so it only seemed Iris took me semi seriously. I said we should just go home as this place had a seriously weird feeling about it but everyone said I was being paranoid and we spent a lot of money on this trip. After some sleep and some special tea I did feel much better and the thought of staying only another two nights wasn‚Äôt the worst idea. We all got dressed and went for breakfast in the restaurant. It was empty but it was a quiet resort. In fact we hadn‚Äôt seen another soul occupying any other of the cabins but we assumed that they were just hiking or out. We ordered a toast and other breakfast items and dug in. We all discussed what we would get up to that day when we suddenly heard a voice. A voice of an elderly woman. She spoke ‚ÄúYou should visit ambleside lake, beautiful and clear. So quiet.‚Äù She smiled but her wrinkles overlapped her mouth like a mask made of latex she was wearing. Something about her seemed so familiar like a distant relative that you cant remember but likes to remark that they changed your nappy. I smiled at her and thanked her for the recommendation. When she spoke again, her voice less soft this time, more like a smoker that chuffed on a pack a day. She spoke more hushed, like it was only for me to hear ‚Äúyou took one didn‚Äôt you?‚Äù 
I said ‚Äúsorry? what did you say?‚Äù 
She dropped her smile and her face looked like it was overlapping on its self a million times. 
Her voice became deeper and rolled on itself like an accent that I have never heard.
‚ÄúI know you took one from the forest. we will wait.‚Äù Then in the voice of my late grandmother said ‚Äúher soul will not placate us long.‚Äù Then she got up, opened the back door and walked out into the tree line, hunched over with the sound of wet meat slapping together. She or it bent her legs out like a stick insect and her arms did the same. She scuttled away ,like a bug running under a log, into the woods with inhumane speeds legs and arms moving in pairs in jolting motions that made my soul shiver. I sat up in bed almost pissing myself out of fear, covered in sweat like I had been wrapping up in a blanket. I turned to my right to see Josie sleeping soundly in the bed opposite me. I checked my phone it was 4:15 in the morning. How much of that was just a dream. Was I even awake? Thats when I heard It. Tap‚Ä¶Tap‚Ä¶Tap‚Ä¶Tap‚Ä¶ ",0,1756843727.0,LakeDistrict,0,0.25,False

I recently had the opportunity‚Äîor should I say, the necessity‚Äîto test the Carbona 232FBA1 Carpet Cleaner with Brush. With pets tracking mud and the occasional coffee spill that seems magnetically drawn to my carpet, I needed something powerful yet practical to tackle tough stains without too much elbow grease.

**Design & Functionality**  
The design of this carpet cleaner immediately caught my attention. It integrates a built-in applicator head that combines a sponge and bristles. This dual-action design isn‚Äôt just for show‚Äîit‚Äôs brilliantly functional. The sponge handles surface stains and odors, while the bristles dig deep into the carpet fibers, tackling even the stubborn spills that refuse to budge. The lightweight bottle was easy to hold for longer cleaning sessions, and the applicator head‚Äôs grip was comfortable and ergonomic, a small yet significant detail I appreciated over time.  

Ready to snag Carbona 232FBA1? [Check price on Amazon now.](https://reviews.sanue.com/p/b0cz2jpsqk/)

**Oxy-Powered Foam Technology**  
What truly sets this product apart is its oxy-powered formula. I‚Äôve tried countless cleaners with ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù formulas promising miracles, but this one genuinely exceeded my expectations. It works with active foam technology, which penetrates deep into stains, lifting them right out of the fibers. A spaghetti sauce stain on my light beige carpet? Gone after just a few passes. The active foam made it satisfying to use because you can visibly see it working. Plus, the fresh, clean scent left behind isn‚Äôt overpowering, making the room feel refreshed without smelling like a perfume attack.  

**Ease of Use**  
This isn‚Äôt one of those complicated devices that require a 20-minute tutorial before use. The instructions were straightforward‚Äîapply the product, scrub with the integrated applicator, and blot the excess moisture away. Having used it now several times, I can confirm it‚Äôs quick enough for spontaneous spills yet powerful enough for set-in stains. It does suggest testing on an inconspicuous area for colorfastness, which I admit I sometimes skip, but I‚Äôm happy to report that my carpets showed no discoloration or damage.  

**Good Aspects**  
‚Ä¢ The two-in-one applicator is fantastic for combining surface cleaning with deep bristle work.  
‚Ä¢ Oxy-powered foam technology is highly effective on various stains, from coffee to wine.  
‚Ä¢ Comfortable, lightweight design makes it easy to handle, even for larger spaces.  
‚Ä¢ Leaves a fresh scent without being overly strong or artificial.  

**Bad Points**  
‚Ä¢ The cleaner isn‚Äôt suitable for materials like silk or velvet, so definitely avoid specialty fabrics.  
‚Ä¢ While effective, the container is relatively small, so you may need multiple bottles for a larger carpeted area.  

**Alternative Offerings**  
Comparing this product to other market rivals like Resolve or Bissell spot removers, I noticed a significant difference in ease of use and effectiveness. Resolve is similarly priced and works well on superficial stains, but in my experience, it doesn‚Äôt penetrate as deeply as the Carbona formula. Bissell has more industrial options that cover larger carpet areas but lack the targeted convenience offered by this product‚Äôs specialized applicator head. For homes like mine, with everyday messes and smaller targeted stains, the Carbona 232FBA1 strikes the perfect balance.  

**Value for Money**  
Is it worth the investment? Absolutely. Although the bottle isn‚Äôt the largest, its effectiveness more than makes up for it. Other cleaners often require multiple rounds of scrubbing or leave residue that you later regret. With this cleaner, I found myself going through less product per use because it‚Äôs just that effective. If you‚Äôre someone who deals with random spills like I do, it‚Äôs a cost-efficient choice compared to overpaying for pricier options that don‚Äôt deliver the same quality.

Lost in the seeking life is not what it's seeming

Stalling heart beating then I'm off of the deep end


Forgotten I'm the center of all being

Dropping in to now til I'm one with the clouds

Dead man walking a Rhythmless heart beating

The boundless vessel unfolding fill the universe out


Infinite possibilities im hearing them out

Found order in the chaos let it spin me around

I am nothing but the movie as I watch it play out

This isn't a music festival.

Famous DJs are brands, brands are commodification. 'John Summit 6PM at Playground' isn't far off from 'Smirnoff sponsored drinks at Playground'. Pre-planning the DJ you want to see isn't Immediacy.

9/10 times we saw Sparkle Ponies they were chasing sound camps. I'd hazard a guess those people are more likely to dump trash on local communities, which is a real problem.

I've met John as John Schuster - that's a person. John Summit is a brand. Black Coffee is a brand, Nathi is a person. Promoting those brands on social media to draw FOMO people to the event seems like it violates the Principles and should cause camps to lose placement. Let John and Nathi enjoy burn and give the gift of their music to the community, but encourage their brand promotion teams to honor the ten principles.

This is coming from someone who's loved listening to the recorded sets at Burning Man for many years. But after being there it's hard to not feel like it's a faustian bargain to allow social media promotion of DJs in Burning Man.

Having spent a good chunk of my life obsessing over water filtration systems, the **Cuisinart 6527853425322 Replacement Charcoal Water Filters** caught my attention. These little units promise impurity-free water and fit nicely into select pitchers and appliances. My kitchen now feels like a tiny lab, as I‚Äôve been testing these filters for quite some time. But let me give you the real deal‚Äîboth good and bad.  

**Design and Build Quality**  

These filters are relatively compact, measuring 1.5""D x 2.8""W x 5""H, and they feel surprisingly sturdy despite their small size. You get two pieces within a pack, so it covers you for a while. The construction, a mix of nonwoven polyester and activated charcoal, feels premium, with the charcoal particularly effective in filtration. The materials seem durable, which is a definite plus for replacement filters. Slotting them into my Cuisinart water pitcher was hassle-free, and they stayed firmly in place during use without unseating or leaking.  

[Check Cuisinart 6527853425322 price on Amazon.](https://usedwater.com/price/b00y0xu77y/)  

**Filtration Performance**  

I‚Äôve used these across a variety of beverages, from regular drinking water to tea and even cooking scenarios. The results? Better-than-expected! The filters do a stellar job removing impurities, especially chlorine and odd metallic smells. While I‚Äôm no chemist, water certainly tasted cleaner and smoother after filtration. Thanks to its NSF certification, I found comfort in knowing the rigorous testing the product went through. Whether you're a water connoisseur or just want to avoid funky tastes, these filters deliver.  

**Ease of Use**  

Let‚Äôs be honest‚Äîsome replacement filters are unnecessarily complicated to set up, but not these. All you need to do is give them a quick rinse before installing, and you‚Äôre all set. Maintenance is minimal, too. I didn‚Äôt notice any clogging issues during extended use, and the flow rate remained consistent. The simplicity of operation makes it a hit, especially for someone as impatient as me when dealing with finicky gadgets.  

**Merits**  

- Excellent water filtration with noticeable taste improvement.  
- Compact yet strong design with durable materials.  
- Simple setup and easy maintenance.   
- Comes in a convenient two-pack, providing value.  

**Shortcomings**  

- Not universally compatible with all pitchers; ensure it fits yours before purchase.  
- Over time, the active charcoal may start to lose some efficacy, though this applies to most filters.  

**Usage Target**  

This product is perfect for anyone who uses Cuisinart-compatible water pitchers or needs enhanced water quality without hassle. It‚Äôs ideal for health-conscious individuals who want a simple yet effective way to improve their hydration routine. Even if you‚Äôre an avid tea or coffee drinker, like I am, the difference in the final taste is striking.  

**Competing Brands**  

In the crowded market of replacement water filters, a few competitors stand out. For example, Brita offers a wide range of filters that not only focus on impurity removal but also add extra layers for hard water handling. However, Cuisinart‚Äôs simplicity edges Brita in ease of replacement. Another competitor, ZeroWater, boasts extremely intricate five-stage filtration, but it‚Äôs pricier and bulkier. This replacement set balances efficiency and practicality while still maintaining an approachable price point.  

**Worth Every Penny**  

Given its compact design, dependable performance, and cleanliness-enhancing features, this product is a strong contender in its price range. While higher-end alternatives may push a few extra filtration stages or specialized mineral retention, these filters get the job done without emptying your wallet. For a convenient water-filtration solution, it‚Äôs definitely a worthy investment.

I would say I'm 90% confirmed on mutual interest as we have both made super awkward attempts to talk to each other in passing a few times.

Recently I got promoted to her department. At my job we all kind of stand around for 5-10 mins until the morning stretches start up. I avoided chatting with her there during my training period cause I was scared. The other day I actually did go up and have a nice chat with her in the morning. 

My question is how should I go about bringing it outside the job and going on a date? I don't wanna put too much pressure on cause obviously its my job and that could get messy. But unless we end up sectioned to the same area together on that day then there's not really a lot of chatting and getting to know opportunities available except for groggy eyed before starting work at 6am. 

Should I just straight up be like ""hey would you be interested in meeting outside of work for some more comfortable chatting environment see if we can get to know each other? Coffee or activity type thing?""

Or should I just keep it slow moving and little chats at work here and there until we can both mutually confirm we are into each others personalities as well as physical appearance? Ive never really done like a ""slow friends to lovers"" kind of thing, for me its mostly been already confirmed we are into each other for all of my dates (dating apps mostly) SO honestly im so confused and scared about how to properly handle this situation.

Recently I realized that multiple times in my life, I have been treated for depression and get to a stage where I am able to function (get out of bed) but for some reason can't make progress on the productive things I want to do - side projects, life goals big and small, and work. I can do things like get myself to the gym or get myself to socialize, but I can't seem to move forward on tasks and I sit all day feeling guilty, and the cycle repeats the next day.

My doctor refuses to diagnose because they say it would have been diagnosed in childhood. I suspect they also assume it would be hyperactive because I am a man, when I think it's inattentive, and I have always had more feminine traits in terms of how my brain works.

Other things I can't explain from childhood:

* I couldn't remember my home phone number (I had to ask a friend)
* I didn't know how to spell my own name in the 1st grade
* I could never get myself to sit down and practice guitar for more than 15 minutes
* Coping with my lack of progress in life with high dopamine activities like junk food
* Being good in academics but having no hobbies or sports that I was able to stick with
* Brushing my teeth or doing dishes has always been extremely hard to do

Things from adulthood:

* I've had side projects I have been wanting to work on for 15 years (not exaggerating) and always fail to be able to start or make any progress
* The only times I feel motivated enough to move forward are occasionally when I drink coffee
* I lock myself out or lose my wallet once a year
* Constantly forget I have something on the stove even when I say ""I will remember this time""
* Struggle to break larger todos down into manageable chunks
* Struggle to make decisions (major paralysis on even small decisions)

I just wanted to get that out because I feel like an alien trying to figure out what is wrong with me. I don't even want meds, I just want to know why I am the way I am, be understood, and find a way to succeed in life.

Gyroscope!] Chapter 1: Warning: Watching Cursed Videos Might Lead to Unexpected Visits from Federal Agents (Horror-Comedy),"# Chapter 1 - Warning: Watching Cursed Videos Might Lead to Unexpected Visits from Federal Agents

Many people wouldn‚Äôt have been so relieved to see an FBI agent standing on their doorstep unannounced the first thing in the morning, but honestly, it was a hell of a lot better than my parents. FBI agents operate under specific protocols and restrictions, parents do not.

The morning sun‚Äôs dull glow behind the agent illuminated the outside world as it peaked from over the horizon, out of view. It had been months since I‚Äôd seen the aura of the morning. I had almost forgotten what it looked like. It reminded me of my old commute. Oh, how much I hated it.

‚ÄúEleanor Layne?‚Äù The agent asked. He flashed his badge again. I guess just in case I had been too drowsy to register it the first time. He stood about six feet, not much older than I, mid-thirties, and with tired eyes.

‚ÄúYes?‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúAnd you are?‚Äù

‚ÄúAgent Dale McLaughlin, FBI. May I come in?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat is this about?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt would be a lot easier to explain if I came in.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you need a warrant or something?‚Äù I crossed my arms.

‚ÄúPlease let me in. This is serious.‚Äù Behind him, a cool hint of the mid-October breeze drifted in. I shivered.

‚ÄúNot serious enough for a warrant, I presume. Are you going to tell me what you want, or what?‚Äù

‚ÄúI uh,‚Äù the agent said. He looked unsure of himself. ‚ÄúLet me show you.‚Äù

He opened up his jacket, one of those navy blue windbreaks that you see actors playing agents like him in movies and police procedurals wearing. I couldn‚Äôt see the back, but if life was anything like the movies, then I‚Äôd assume that it had large yellow typeface letters spelling out F-B-I, just like the smaller iteration of the yellow letters in the front. He withdrew his phone from an interior pocket.

He unlocked it, tapped around, and held it out horizontally towards me while a video played.

It took me a moment to register the video, but once my tired brain made the connections, I knew exactly what it was. The same video Mike had sent me last night. The same video I had watched many times, like listening to a song on repeat in an attempt to relive those same initial emotions of fear and dread. The same video that impressed itself upon my young teenage brain and changed my entire life. I still remembered the file name in Limewire: eagelton\_witch\_livingroom\_sc.wav. And now this random FBI agent was showing it to me.

The first shot faced a wall, white dry wall. Not a static shot, though, but a trembling one. A classic trope of found footage films. Through her deep unsettled panting, the unseen camera operator made her presence known. Or she would have if Agent McLaughlin had the volume on. He seemed to notice this and turned the phone towards him before pressing the volume key up. While doing so, he held his head at a slight angle, his face scrunched, and his eyes flicking away and towards the phone. The panting grew louder until it was audible. He then turned the phone back to me.

I didn‚Äôt need to let it play out, since I had seen the clip so many times before. After Mike‚Äôs email last night, it was still fresh in my mind. However, there was something about watching it on a strange man‚Äôs phone early in the morning while standing in the chilly autumn breeze that took me back to when I had first seen it nineteen years ago. Emotions resurfaced from that initial feeling of dread I had felt watching it for my first while curled up under my covers watching it on my iPod Video. I let the video continue playing.

The camerawoman turned a corner into a living room. A typical living room, nothing worth losing your mind over. A couch, a loveseat, a coffee table, and an entertainment center with a large CRT TV tuned to static sitting on it. A noise came from behind her. She spun the living room into a motion blur as she turned around, looking back into the hallway in which she came. Nothing. She turned back around and walked through the living room, slow and deliberate. Panting.

She reached the edge of the living room, at the threshold of the TV‚Äôs static light and an unnaturally dark void of the house. The camera held at what looked like the vague outline of a door, but before she stepped forward, another noise came from behind the woman. She turned. Nothing.

I knew exactly what was going to happen next and yet I felt myself grow tense at it for my first time in so long.

The woman turned to face the abyss, but something changed. A figure stood in the void, its head hunched over, unnaturally long and boney arms dangling to its side. The white fabric of its tarnished gown glowed in the dull gray static. It‚Äôs long hair so dark that in this lighting that it might as well have come from the darkness itself.

With its head and arms raised, the figure‚Äôs elbows were the only joints bending, its hands hanging loosely. The camerawoman gasped. The figure‚Äôs hair parted, revealing a pale face of a deformed woman. Long pointed nose. Eyes without irises, just dark sunken holes resting in the whites of the eyes. Mouth open and huffing, her teeth rotten and black, with a dark substance dripping from the edges of her mouth. She opened her jaw wide open and shrilled. The camerawoman panicked, walked backwards and collided with an offscreen object. She tumbled backwards and the camera cut to black. For the first time in over a decade, that video gave me goosebumps.

‚ÄúDo you see it?‚Äù Agent McLaughlin said.

I nodded. ‚ÄúWhat does this have to do with anything? Did Mike put you up to this?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe video. It‚Äôs everywhere. Check your phone, turn on your TV. It‚Äôs there. It‚Äôs the only thing that‚Äôs there. Trust me.‚Äù Panic sweat across his face. I took a step back and gripped the door, ready to slam it in his face if need be. ‚ÄúGet your phone out, watch any random video. It‚Äôll be there too.‚Äù

‚ÄúI left my phone upstairs.‚Äù It wasn‚Äôt. It was in my pocket.

‚ÄúThen go get it. Watch a random video on it. YouTube, TikTok, something you recorded. Every fricking video has been replaced with it.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to have to ask you to leave or I‚Äôm going to call the cops. Even if you do work for the FBI, this is unprofessional behavior. Please leave.‚Äù I gripped the door harder.

‚ÄúPlease, Eleanor.‚Äù No longer panic on his face, but desperation. He began flipping through his phone. He tapped on something and pointed it towards me. The YouTube splash screen pointed at me. He then tapped the first video and opened it. The shaking camera began playing.

‚ÄúAfter I shut this door, you‚Äôll have five minutes to remove yourself from my property or I‚Äôm calling the cops. The real cops.‚Äù

‚ÄúEleanor, this is serious.‚Äù He took a step forward. ‚ÄúI can explain every-‚Äú

I slammed the door. His five minutes had just begun.

\*\*\*

I locked every lock on that door, including the second deadbolt, just above the first. It had no exterior keyhole, which made it great for shutting out the outside world. A lock I had never locked in my entire stay here because the property‚Äôs landlords, my parents, forbade it. They preferred I kept it unlocked in case of ‚Äúemergencies and surprise visits.‚Äù Thirty-three years old and they still treated me like the rebellious teen that they worked so hard and so futilely to reform. Legally, they had to keep that bolt installed, as long as they planned on continuing renting out this half of the property after I moved out.

The adrenaline ran its course and the lack of sleep caught up with me. I needed coffee. It took about five minutes for a half a pot of coffee to brew. Once it finished brewing, that alleged FBI agent‚Äôs time was up. I went to the kitchen, the tension in my muscles still lingering.

I flicked the coffee grinder on. The smell of ground coffee returned some sense of normality to this morning. I filled the pot with water, took a filter and dumped the pulverized beans into the top. I opened the cabinet above the coffee station, the first two rows filled with mugs. Too many mugs for a single woman living alone, some might say, but to them I said: there are never too many mugs for a single woman living alone. I picked my favorite mug. A commemorative mug decorated in the artwork by my favorite Japanese horror artist. On it, a collage of his most iconic art pieces: a woman smirking towards the camera while a grotesque copy of her face grew sideways out of her head. A man‚Äôs body contorted into a spiral of human flesh, another of a shark sitting on top of spider-like legs. I normally saved the mug for special occasions, but today I needed its comfort.

As the coffee brewed, my mind drifted back to that video. It made no sense why a strange man would show it to me like that. Mike must have found this ‚ÄúFBI Agent‚Äù to fuck with me. That video, something I had accidentally downloaded onto my computer and uploaded to my iPod Video so long ago had been the most important video in my life, much to my parent‚Äôs displeasure with having an embarrassment of a horror loving daughter ruin their picturesque ‚ÄúGood Christian Family‚Äù afterwards. At the time, I hadn‚Äôt known its origins, but now it‚Äôs been so regurgitated and recycled as a concept to a point of parody. It still stuck with me the way first impressions do.

It had to be Mike. Nothing else made sense. I unlocked my phone and shot him a text.

You did it. You made it fucking scary again. Now tell your friend to get off my porch. I sent. And then I followed up with. Still up for linner tonight?

It‚Äôd be a few hours before he‚Äôd text me. That man never woke up before two in the afternoon on most days. Which is why we always called it ‚Äúlinner.‚Äù His lunch, my dinner.

A few linners ago we talked horror movies, as usual, and the topic of our first true scary moments came up. I told him of my infamous moment with ‚Äúeagelton\_witch\_livingroom\_sc.wav,‚Äù and how that out of context clip kept me up for nights.

‚ÄúWait, the Eagleton Witch Project was your first real scare?‚Äù Mike said to me. His glass was half full and his burger was already gone despite it just having got there a few minutes ago.

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I said. Mike had potent feelings about the source material, so I knew exactly where Mike would go with this.

‚ÄúAmateur! Pop-culture loving amateur.‚Äù

‚ÄúAt least I wasn‚Äôt traumatized by a monster in a fucking children‚Äôs movie.‚Äù

‚ÄúLeave mecha-baby out of this. At least his appearance didn‚Äôt ruin horror films for a decade. Found footage was fine when it first started, but afterwards. Pfft.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, and it started with the Eagleton Witch Project. I think my first scare is legitimate.‚Äù

‚ÄúHave you seen the whole movie?‚Äù

I shook my head.

‚ÄúYou call yourself a horror fan and you haven‚Äôt watched the whole thing?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou bastard. First, you call me an amateur for watching it, and now you‚Äôre saying I‚Äôm not a real horror fan?‚Äù

Mike smirked, a shit-eating grin. I shook my head and laughed. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the worst.‚Äù

Our conversation drifted after that to one of Mike‚Äôs wild goose chases for lost and obscure horror media and alleged cursed videos he was looking for He rambled about his never-ending quest for Gyroscope, an alleged cursed video that he was dead set on finding. Nothing more than a dumb creepypasta. An urban legend. I didn‚Äôt believe it. Curses remained in horror movies. They‚Äôd never exist in a world as mundane as ours. Mike must have been trying to mess with me last night though by sending me a file called ‚ÄúGyroscope.mp4‚Äù just last night, which ended up being nothing more than a retitled ‚Äúeagelton\_witch\_livingroom\_sc.wav‚Äù

The coffee finished brewing, and I poured myself a cup. I walked over to the door and checked the peephole. ‚ÄúAgent‚Äù McLaughlin was not there. A small sense of relief washed over me.

I retreated to the living room and turned on the TV, opening up YouTube to decompress. Too tired to actually think, I turned on a lo-fi music station. Just something to have on the background while the coffee still worked on booting up my brain. When the video started, I had thought I had gone insane.

No peaceful animated video. No girl wearing pink headphones endlessly studying while her orange tabby sat on a windowsill looking at a picturesque European backdrop. Not even the chill lo-fi music played. Instead, a shaky handheld video. A panting unseen camerawoman. A turn of the corner. A static TV. A witch. A scream. The ‚Äúeagleton\_witch\_project\_livinginroom\_sc.wav‚Äù rendered in 4K.

Alright, no need to panic. I thought. My YouTube recommendations are littered with horror based content creators. Maybe I accidentally clicked on a video about it. I am sleep deprived after all. I let the video play out, seeing if it would cut to a YouTube talking head, but it didn‚Äôt. Nor did any narration played over the video, instead it repeated, again. And again. And again. Always starting with the panicked breathing and always ending with the witch screaming. What the hell?

I exited the video and opened a random one next to it titled The Ring is Genius And Here‚Äôs Why. I was just thinking about rewatching that movie. The algorithm knew me so well. The video loaded.

A white wall. Panicked breathing from an unseen camerawoman. The living room. A static TV. A witch. A scream. A white wall. Repeating, over and over again.

‚ÄúWhat the fuck?‚Äù I said.

I tried another video.

The same damn footage.

Mike, you had gone way too far with your pranks. But how? Unless he moonlighted as the best hacker on the planet, I had no idea how he pulled off such a thing.

I closed YouTube and opened Netflix. Before the featured content could finish loading, I clicked on the first suggestion. If I moved fast enough, I thought I could beat whatever had been injecting that video into my feed. The red loading icon hung on my screen for much longer than it should have.

Fifteen percent.

Forty-five.

Sixty.

Sixty-five.

Ninety.

Ninety-nine.

Ninety-nine.

Ninety-nine.

Play.

A white wall. Panicked breathing from an unseen camerawoman. The living room. A static TV. I turned the TV off. I had seen enough.

‚ÄúWhat the hell is happening?‚Äù I said.

I opened my phone and shot Mike another text. Alright, you really got me. Now please let me watch Netflix in peace!

Maybe this was Mike‚Äôs way of getting me to invest in physical media. After all, he can‚Äôt help to bring up his extensive collection whenever he gets the chance. A few weeks ago, he told me how he finally added a film projector to his collection. A freaking film projector. As if owning a Blu-Ray player, a DVD player, tape player (VHS and Betamax combo), and Laserdisc weren‚Äôt enough. Wait, physical media.

I had a few DVDs, but no DVD player, at least not plugged into my TV. I grabbed one from the self and walked up the narrow stairs to my bedroom to fetch my laptop. My laptop, at least, still had a disc drive.

I left the lights off, and blinds closed. Ignoring the clothes on the floor, I hurried to my desk. Opening the laptop, I popped the disc drive open. The email Mike sent me last night titled ‚ÄúI think I found it!‚Äù was still open, with Gyroscope.mp4 playing on VLC next to it, playing that same clip from the Eagleton Witch Project on repeat. I wondered now if it was some sort of virus that affected my entire network. I slid the DVD into the drive and popped it closed. The menu opened, and I hit play.

The same white wall with the shaking camera facing it, accompanied by the same panicked breathing.

Fucking Mike.

\*\*\*

Maybe he had given me a virus. Maybe Mike was up to no good. Maybe he had gotten into trouble with the law. Maybe that was why an FBI agent appeared on my doorstep this morning. Shit.

I shut my laptop and stood up.

Walking over to the door, I thought I saw something in the corner of my eye. A pale figure in the dark corner of the bedroom. I looked towards it, but saw nothing. I shook my head and groaned. This sleep deprivation was getting to me.

‚ÄúI need some fucking sleep,‚Äù I said. I walked out of the room and went downstairs and out the front door, hoping that the FBI agent hadn‚Äôt driven away already.

I stepped outside wearing nothing but sweats and a tank top. That had been a mistake. The cool autumn morning air wrapped itself around me, goosebumps formed, and I shivered. I considered going back in for my jacket, but I pushed those thoughts aside. I needed to find that socially awkward FBI agent before he left, if I hadn‚Äôt scared him off already with my threats of calling the police.

I scanned the curbside for an official vehicle or something. What even do FBI agents drive? I didn‚Äôt know what to look for other than something vaguely cop car looking with the letters ‚ÄúFBI‚Äù printed on the side. I skimmed the usual crowd of cars. An unwashed raised truck. My old Nissan Sentra that had lost all of its protective coating, rust patches formed on the blue paint like mold. A white van with ‚ÄúElmer‚Äôs Painting Service‚Äù that belonged to my duplex neighbor. Although I knew for sure that his name was not Elmer, it was Frank, because my parents always called ‚ÄúFrank‚Äù their favorite tenant. No cop car with FBI printed on the side. I sighed. I almost went inside when I heard a yapping dog.

I turned my attention to it. A woman in a puffy baby blue coat was walking a small dog down at the end of the block. The dog yapped at a squirrel across the street while the woman tried to calm it. The woman and dog were of no interest to me. What caught my eye was the foreign maroon Honda Odyssey parked next to them, still idling. I didn‚Äôt recognize the car. Desperate, I approached it.

The woman and dog had crossed the street by the time I had approached the van. The van hummed in the quiet morning. A white trail of exhaust flowed from the rear exhaust pipe, dissipating into the air. I approached the driver‚Äôs side window and looked in. Agent McLaughlin sat at the wheel, staring off into the distance. I knocked on the window. He jumped.

Once the look of panic subsided, he rolled down the window and looked at me with dry red eyes.

‚ÄúJust what the hell is going on?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs everywhere. Ever since I watched you-,‚Äù he paused, ‚ÄúI watched that video last night. It‚Äôs infected everywhere. Is it everywhere for you too?‚Äù

‚ÄúAt least everything in my house. YouTube, Netflix, my freaking DVDs.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, thank God I‚Äôm not going not going crazy,‚Äù he said with a sense of relief.

‚ÄúHow do you know about this? Is Mike on some sort of list? Am I on some sort of list?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a long story.‚Äù

‚ÄúSay it.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not going to like what you hear,‚Äù he shivered.

‚ÄúAgent McLaughlin, I need to know what exactly is going on and how I fit into this.‚Äù

He looked away and closed his eyes. He took a deep breath and held it before sighing.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs true that I work for the FBI. My job is very important. But I come here on personal business because nobody at the Bureau would believe what is happening to me.‚Äù He took another deep breath before continuing. ‚ÄúThis thing that seems to be afflicting both of us. I know nothing about it. I was hoping that you would have a better idea.‚Äù He opened his eyes and looked at me.

I shook my head in annoyance. What would I know about this? How would he even suspect me to know anything about this? What, was I mistakenly put on a short list of contact-in-case-of-cursed people?

‚ÄúDo you?‚Äù He said, as if he hadn‚Äôt seen me shake my head.

‚ÄúNo, I know nothing about anything going on right now. Why did you reach out to me?‚Äù

‚ÄúMy job.‚Äù he took another deep breath. ‚ÄúI am not a field agent. I‚Äôm just an office worker. A monitor. It‚Äôs my job to monitor the web traffic of certain people. After it started happening last night, shortly after you opened that attachment, I couldn‚Äôt see anything but the video. Everywhere, even on my phone. I thought I had infected the computer, but when I showed my coworkers they didn‚Äôt see what I saw. Not on my phone, not on my computer. I thought I was going crazy.‚Äù

‚ÄúWait. Did you say after you watched me open that attachment? What do you mean ‚Äòwatched me‚Äô?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe have a list of triggers that automatically flag people for our ‚ÄòJust Keeping Tabs‚Äô list. Most people on it are not involved in anything illicit or illegal, but when they are flagged, we assign an agent to monitor them for up to six months.‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you saying what I think you‚Äôre saying?‚Äù I took a step back.

He nodded.

‚ÄúNo way.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry Eleanor,‚Äù he took a deep breath. ‚ÄúBut you‚Äôre my assignment and I‚Äôve been spying on you.‚Äù

Okay, friends, let‚Äôs talk about something we‚Äôve all experienced: that *overwhelming* flood of AI creator guides. ü•¥ You know what I mean‚Äîthe never-ending sea of information that, honestly, kinda makes your brain feel like it's doing a backflip. ü§π‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

It‚Äôs like every time you turn around, there‚Äôs another shiny new guide promising to revolutionize your AI game. But let's be real, half the time, you end up scrolling through a wall of text that just leaves you more confused than when you started. 

So, what's the solution? One guide to rule them all! üôå Here it is, my friends‚Ä¶ and trust me, it‚Äôs a *game-changer*. 

**Here‚Äôs what this guide breaks down:**

1. **Simplicity Over Complexity**  
   - Why make things harder than they need to be? This guide cuts out the fluff and gets straight to the *good stuff*. You‚Äôll be saying goodbye to info overload!

2. **Practical Examples**  
   - Tired of theoretical nonsense? Nope, no fluff here! We‚Äôre talking real-life examples that you can implement *today*. Let's turn those ideas into action! 

3. **User-Friendly Layout**  
   - No more digging through paragraphs. We‚Äôre talking bullet points, charts, and visuals that make your learning experience as smooth as your morning coffee. ‚òïÔ∏è

4. **Community Vibes**  
   - Think of it like sitting around a campfire with friends, chatting about what works and what doesn‚Äôt. You'll get to pick the brains of fellow creators who have been in your shoes.

And here‚Äôs the kicker: this guide is practically dripping with *fresh*, actionable insights. But here's the catch‚Äîit might not be around for long! It could be gone faster than you can say ‚ÄúAI content generation.‚Äù

Now, I know you‚Äôre probably thinking, ‚ÄúBut there are other guides that do XYZ!‚Äù Sure, they do! But let‚Äôs be honest. After plowing through a few of them, how much actual value did you get? Is it really about the number of guides you have, or the *quality* of what you‚Äôve learned?

For me, learning should be exciting, not exhausting. üòÖ Imagine finally finding your flow, creating content that resonates, and feeling like you're actually *making strides.* Sounds heavenly, right?

Nothing is absolute, so here are a few things that could possibly happen:


*   They could go to a caf√© and have coffee.
*   They could text, maybe sometimes late at night.
*   They could call.
*   They could have lunch/dinner.
*   They could go for drinks.
*   They could share hobbies and hang out together: watch movies, play games, watch sports, etc.
*   They could go on trips together.
*   They share their emotions and thoughts together: things about their partners, careers, and giving each other advice and comfort.
*   Worst possible situation, but they could cheat.


Are you okay with your partner having an opposite-sex friend? If so, will you let your partner do as they want because they are an adult and can be friends with whomever they want, or will you have limits? Or, would you not be okay at all?",1,1756842800.0,women,7,0.57,False

Today is my first day back working as an attorney after I took a few years off due to burn out and worked job such as barista where I was on my feet and moving all shift.

It‚Äôs already stressful enough on a first day at a new job. But I swear to God my generic adderall IR 30 mg is a dang sugar pill this month. I‚Äôve seen this discussed quite a bit here and in the ADHD subs, but the efficacy of generic of Adderall seemed to fluctuate each month and some are terrible.

For reference I take Adderall IR 30 mg x2 and modafinil 200 mg x3. It‚Äôs a lot. And I still struggle with severe EDS. Oh and I‚Äôm on Xywav (although the last two nights I‚Äôve slept poorly). That med concoction should keep me pretty functional??? 

This morning, I was shadowing one of the senior attorneys in court , and I was fighting sleep attacks ALL MORNING. It felt like torture and I was petrified someone would notice, because at one point, my eyes were involuntarily drooping despite my best efforts.

I called my prescriber and asked if somehow I could get brand Adderall without paying a zillion dollars a month? Or switching to Dexadrine? (I‚Äôve tried and failed the other ones). I sounded like a crazy person, but I am genuinely so upset and stressed out.

I‚Äôm self-conscious about not having practice law for a while, and desperately want to make a good impression as well as the sharp enough to pick up the new technology, etc.. I have to learn. And this morning was BRUTAL. 

I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm complaining about generic medication or simply freaking out on my lunch break and coming here for moral support or what, but all I wanted to do was tell someone who understands about this because it feels really bad. 

I‚Äôm going back this afternoon for more shadowing, which is really boring, and I took more medication and got a coffee and a rockstar, but I can just feel how deeply tired I am. I legitimately want to cry.

This disease is so unfair.

I do think I‚Äôm going to tell my employer about the narcolepsy because I suspect I may need to request an accommodation or two. And honestly, I‚Äôd actually feel more comfortable if they knew in case they ever do catch me having sleep attacks. 

First days are just so stressful and I was fighting off sleep attacks all morning and it was really awful and I just wanted to say so because I know people here understand this stuff.

I just want to get home so I can take a nap, but that is many hours of school afternoon away plus commute. 

Thanks for letting me spill this. I just feel awful right now. ",1,1756842765.0,Narcolepsy,0,1.0,False
1n6tmzb,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/1n6tmzb/what_happened_when_the_love_that_finds_you_when/,What happened when the love that finds you when you least expect it disappears almost as quickly?,"They say that love finds you when you least expect it. Usually preempted by taking a significant amount of time to focus on yourself and become who you truly are. When you fully know yourself you attract people who are better aligned to your life goals and position.

I was single for a period of 5 years after my last breakup. No dating and complete celibacy for the last 2 of those 5 years. I had done tremendous work on my hobbies, career, and life goals. I made a pivotal career change, bought a condo completely on my own, and fostered a village of wonderful friends from scratch. I was not looking for love, because I found it in myself. I had nurtured the most confident and self-aware version of myself. At 35, I was standing in my power and I was out in the world doing solo activities or group activities at least once a week.

This past May, I engineered a group for participating in one of my favorite water sports. I led multiple group outings and we all had such a great time. One of the girls who goes out with me on these meetups mentioned a mutual friend was interested and asking if he could join us. I said sure, of course. The more the merrier. It was already a co-ed group.

When he came out to our next meetup, I found him very physically attractive. I didn't think much more of it because I just don't pay much attention to men in a romantic sense these days out of self-protection. Long story short, after several more meetups that he joined over the course of 1-2 months--he contacted me directly to hang out at the beach. It was a one-on-one hangout, and he was very inquisitive about me. He asked me my relationship status and some other compatibility questions. I told him I've been single for years and wasn't looking, but if the right person were to come into my life, I'd go for it. He mentioned he was single as of 4 months ago, and that it was an on/off thing for a few years. At the end of our hangout on the beach, he turned to me directly and said he liked me. Even before his statement, I was warming up to him with the conversations we had all afternoon.

He pursued me very strongly over the next week or so, inviting me to go on long bike rides with him, stop for food, and chat on the beach. I was so excited to meet someone like this who I was finding myself really into. One night as we were eating and talking and staring into each other's souls, I mentioned that if he continues to see me like this, I'd like him to know that I do not want to share. His eyes lit up and he was blushing and he agreed that he would not like to share either. The following night, we were laying together on the beach at sunset and he asked me to be his girlfriend. I said yes with enthusiasm. To this point, we had not yet been intimate.

He bought me roses. We had a few more hangouts before we went to bed together, and then when we did get intimate, everything was so natural and connected. I would argue that it was the best I'd ever had. We continued to see each other about 3-4 times a week (at his request). He introduced me to some of his best friends, told some of his family and associates about me, and mentioned to me that he'd like me to meet his brother soon. He would text me every day as well.

The sex kept getting better with each session, and we continued to have fun with outside activities. We would cook for each other, he'd make me coffee every morning I was there. He'd get up and watch the sunrise with me before I left for work on the weekdays I stayed over. In total, we were deeply involved multiple days a week for 4-5 weeks. We couldn't keep our hands off each other. Shared deep eye contact, talked about a lot of things. Nothing about marriage or that far ahead yet, which seemed fine for the timing. Nothing too deep about past relationships, again seemed too early. Just getting to know our day-to-day selves. By this point, he had given me a guest parking decal for his garage.

Last weekend, on Saturday morning I noticed he was suddenly very distant. I tried to have a conversation about it with him and he was somewhat vague and said he was feeling some anxiety. I asked him if he felt that I was spending too much time over and offered to take off for the day and give him some space. He said no, he wasn't thinking of that, but after another hour or so, he was still in such a different mood than usual. I told him, its not a problem and I'll get out of his space so he can relax and I left that Saturday around 3pm. He said he was going to go visit with his parents and talk with them.

I spent the rest of the weekend away and neither of us contacted each other until Monday when he texted me ""hope you had a relaxing rest of your weekend and I wish you a successful day"", to which I responded ""I'm good, and I hope you were able to relax as well and spend time with your family"". He said ""thank you! :)""

Tuesday, I figured I'd reach out to him first to keep it balanced. ""Hello, thinking of you. Hope your week is going well"". He answered promptly but cold. I let it go and said nothing more.

Wednesday, I decided to call him. He answered my call, but he said he was playing tennis with some friends and they were done but going to go get food. He said he'd call me back. He did not call me back that night; however, he texted me at 9am to apologize for not calling and that he stayed out late with the friends. I answered that I was glad he reached out and that I would like to know when I could stop by to get my gear from his house because I had plans to do the water sport we met doing and I had left the stuff there. He said he'd be home by 5. I said I'd let him know when I was out front for him to bring it out to me. He said ""Yes, but park downstairs because we deserve to have a conversation""

I agreed and went over, he brought me into his apartment and said ""I know you want to know what is going on with me""

I let him explain himself and it turned into a lengthy, vulnerable, emotional conversation about how he was feeling. He revealed that he was hit with a wave of unresolved emotions from his past relationship. He said that he no longer loved her, and that he ended it, but she keeps trying to pop up in his life. According to him, she showed up at his apartment unannounced some weeks ago (prior to us dating), and other things. He said he's resenting that he spent the last 2 years of their relationship together because they both wasted each others time, and he knew by then he didn't want to marry her and she wanted that. He said he had a session with his psychotherapist and they believe he's not ready to date as its still too fresh. He told me that he wanted to pause what we had going on so that he can continue therapy and work through it.

I said that I understood, but I was disappointed because I liked him so much and was looking forward to experiences to come. He said there's nothing that I did wrong, and that I am special and a ""worthy"" woman. He called me ""baby"" a few times as he was talking. He walked me to my car and carried my stuff for me. He embraced me tightly and kissed my neck. He said ""we'll talk soon"" and then he reclaimed the parking decal and let me go.

I am very proud of myself for accepting his explanation and not begging or trying to negotiate something less for myself; however, I am so very sad that this is the way its gone. I let myself be free and authentic with him and trust his intentions as his actions were those of someone who was genuinely interested, but I have no choice but to let him go in this situation. I'm not angry, but I'm totally shaken and feel like I'm withdrawing from hard drugs. I have been floating for the past month experiencing such an intense connection, and now its like I never even knew him.

I know it sounds like too much too soon, but his actions did line up with his words the whole time we were seeing each other. I am really frustrated because I wasn't even looking for anything, and now it dominates my thoughts. I don't really need any advise because I know I just need to re-focus on myself and go no contact, which I have the self-control to do. Would love some positive thoughts though because I was really falling in love with him and now I'm just stuck in a state of limerence and doubting my own reality that ever truly cared about me.

This is of course a very compressed version of the map, you can download the HD one form my drive [HERE](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FMLDjdD4y6wZ2CjK79VUHmT14qHI1QwB/view?usp=sharing); it's in 16:9 to be used as wallpaper and similar. 

In addition, I also made a second version in a slightly different aspect ratio (7200x4200 px) which can be printed on playmats! The pixel size corresponds to exactly 24""x14"" which is the most 'standard' playmat size; the file is at 300 ppi so it should looks fine once printed. You can download it [HERE](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1g1PkS2KETGInEWdTNz0tkcOwKXQcg0nw/view?usp=sharing).

**DISCLAIMER**: I haven't tested the playmat version (yet) as I'm looking for a printer right now, so print at your own risk. If you want to know how it looks in reality first, please let me know and I will note down your username and tag you when I get and post pictures of a printed playmat.

As for the future: from now on updated to the atlas will come only when a in-universe set is released (so not until 2026 at the very least) and only if we get new insights that allow for a more complete/updated atlas to be made.

If anyone is interested in supporting this work and future updates, I have a Ko-Fi for other MTG-related stuff so you can send a coffee my way there if you like: [my Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/odys). I poured a lot of time, resources, and effort into this and I still make it available to everyone for free, so any kind of support is appreciated, *especially* if you print the playmat!

Changelog from v2:

* Added Bloomburrow - Kamigawa path
* Added Muraganda and relative paths to Avishkar and Amonketh
* Added void shadow around Phyrexia
* Re-routed some paths to reduce intersections
* Updated 3D models from toroidal to spherical

On the 29th I fell down the stairs and landed funny on my left foot, which resulted in a 5th metatarsal fracture (Jones fracture) with 1mm displacement. I see a specialist on the 4th to determine if I need surgery and we go from there. I was informed that this break is a tricky one and nonunion is common, and in some cases, due to poor circulation in this area, this can potentially cause the bone to die. I am to look for discoloration in my toes, numbness, tingling, and increased pain.

Here's the issue, 

I had coffee this morning with espresso, which I usually do. I'm unsure if it's currently affecting my circulation or if I have a bigger problem on my hands (foot) ü§°.

Sometimes I get a little chilly and sweaty after coffee, my hands will also get cold like this. I have felt cold, sweaty, AND also numbness and tingling in my left foot, it also aches on and off. Well my hands aren't cold anymore, but my foot still is, which makes me wonder if the coffee isnt the issue here. My toes are cold to the touch, slightly red at the very tips, and the nails and rest of my toes are pale. I can still move them though. Then we get to the foot, which is extremely discolored. (I noticed this today as I peaked into the splint a little)

I did get the split rewrapped last night as well, but it felt snug, comfortable, and well supported. Not too loose or too tight. I didnt recall seeing this discoloration last night either, but I'm also wondering if it wasn't visible at the time. Only the outter layer was rewrapped since everything else is fitted to my foot and ankle.

I have provided photos so you can see exactly what Im looking at here. I apologize for the lengthy text, but I do sincerely appreciate your time and help. Thank you!

24m, have lived with my grandparents for a few years (moved out my parents right after HS, didn‚Äôt work out) 

Important thing to keep in mind during this is during my whole life (including now) this house has been a disgusting dump that could easily make an episode of hoarders. And it has always been a no fly zone for visitors But I grew up here till about 4th grade till my parents finally got a place together. So it has always kind of been my safe place in a way

Always struggled with mental health, but have been stubborn and wanted to figure things out myself. Well, recently I have started figuring some things out. I started noticing patterns and doing some research and given my predisposition to it, I‚Äôm about 95% sure i have bipolar 2. 

Only issue is, I‚Äôve been figuring this out at the same time as when my family is getting renovations done. And the renovations that have been going all summer now (starting at 8am every day), along with my families lack of consideration and obnoxious habits have made it impossible for me to maintain a sleep schedule, if I am even able to sleep much at all.

As you would probably expect, all of this stress and zero break or sense of peace has been triggering mixed states. And it‚Äôs recently been reaching a point where I‚Äôve given in and accepted I need help. 

And so i reached out to my mom (which was hard for me to do), and we had a good talk in person and I thought ‚Äúok now they know what‚Äôs going on at least, and now we can work toward getting me someone to talk to and figure out what to do next. And maybe my grandparents will be more considerate knowing how bad it is now. 

Nope. Because I‚Äôm woken up at 8 am today (the next day) and told ‚Äúthey‚Äôre gonna be coming into the bedrooms today clean out the vents‚Äù 

Now like I said, house is disgusting. When I first moved in, tried keeping my room clean, but considering it‚Äôs the only usable room in the house that isn‚Äôt downstairs where my grandparents are, everything I own is in there. And anytime I‚Äôve cleaned it, they buy more shit and throw it in there even if I ask them not to. 

And so my room is also disgusting. And I‚Äôve told them over and over and over again, ‚Äúplease let me know AHEAD OF TIME so I could just put in the effort and clean my room in one session.‚Äù But nope. Couldn‚Äôt do that. 

The best part is, that wasn‚Äôt even the first time so far! Because literally a month ago I hadn‚Äôt even taken a sip of my coffee yet, and a stranger opens the door to my room. ‚ÄúI was told to do the drywall in the bedrooms‚Äù he says. Meanwhile, yet again, NO ONE TOLD ME A THING 

And so when this occurred today, I finally snapped. I was yelling and hitting things and very angry. Because they know I‚Äôm having a hard time. And yet twice now, I have my privacy invaded, with nowhere to go, and when I get angry about it, im treated like I‚Äôm the crazy one. 

Like this is all normal, like the house being nasty is normal, like having strangers in my room is normal, like having to DEAL WITH ALL OF THIS AANDD CONSTANT FUCKING MIXED EPISODES AND SHIT SLEEP IS NORMAL 

I left and haven‚Äôt been home all day. I told them if they want it cleaned up they can do it since they didn‚Äôt want to give me a warning. Still have a half hour till the people usually leave and who knows if they will even be gone then. I didn‚Äôt even get a chance to eat food. I have been at the library / a park all day. 

I just want to go home but even home doesn‚Äôt feel like home anymore. I can‚Äôt get any peace. If I try to lay down I‚Äôll be woken up by the fucking dogs or my grandparents yelling or slamming doors. 

Are my feelings valid? There‚Äôs 1000 things I haven‚Äôt even mentioned I‚Äôm going through. That‚Äôs just a small small bite. I‚Äôm tired of being treated as if I‚Äôm crazy when I finally reach my breaking point. Because no one ever understands how fucking long it took me to get there and how much damn patience I have had till this point. But I‚Äôm tired.

Many people wouldn‚Äôt have been so relieved to see an FBI agent standing on their doorstep unannounced the first thing in the morning, but honestly, it was a hell of a lot better than my parents. FBI agents operate under specific protocols and restrictions, parents do not.

The morning sun‚Äôs dull glow behind the agent illuminated the outside world as it peaked from over the horizon, out of view. It had been months since I‚Äôd seen the aura of the morning. I had almost forgotten what it looked like. It reminded me of my old commute. Oh, how much I hated it.

‚ÄúEleanor Layne?‚Äù The agent asked. He flashed his badge again. I guess just in case I had been too drowsy to register it the first time. He stood about six feet, not much older than I, mid-thirties, and with tired eyes.

‚ÄúYes?‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúAnd you are?‚Äù

‚ÄúAgent Dale McLaughlin, FBI. May I come in?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat is this about?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt would be a lot easier to explain if I came in.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you need a warrant or something?‚Äù I crossed my arms.

‚ÄúPlease let me in. This is serious.‚Äù Behind him, a cool hint of the mid-October breeze drifted in. I shivered.

‚ÄúNot serious enough for a warrant, I presume. Are you going to tell me what you want, or what?‚Äù

‚ÄúI uh,‚Äù the agent said. He looked unsure of himself. ‚ÄúLet me show you.‚Äù

He opened up his jacket, one of those navy blue windbreaks that you see actors playing agents like him in movies and police procedurals wearing. I couldn‚Äôt see the back, but if life was anything like the movies, then I‚Äôd assume that it had large yellow typeface letters spelling out F-B-I, just like the smaller iteration of the yellow letters in the front. He withdrew his phone from an interior pocket.

He unlocked it, tapped around, and held it out horizontally towards me while a video played.

It took me a moment to register the video, but once my tired brain made the connections, I knew exactly what it was. The same video Mike had sent me last night. The same video I had watched many times, like listening to a song on repeat in an attempt to relive those same initial emotions of fear and dread. The same video that impressed itself upon my young teenage brain and changed my entire life. I still remembered the file name in Limewire: eagelton\_witch\_livingroom\_sc.wav. And now this random FBI agent was showing it to me.

The first shot faced a wall, white dry wall. Not a static shot, though, but a trembling one. A classic trope of found footage films. Through her deep unsettled panting, the unseen camera operator made her presence known. Or she would have if Agent McLaughlin had the volume on. He seemed to notice this and turned the phone towards him before pressing the volume key up. While doing so, he held his head at a slight angle, his face scrunched, and his eyes flicking away and towards the phone. The panting grew louder until it was audible. He then turned the phone back to me.

I didn‚Äôt need to let it play out, since I had seen the clip so many times before. After Mike‚Äôs email last night, it was still fresh in my mind. However, there was something about watching it on a strange man‚Äôs phone early in the morning while standing in the chilly autumn breeze that took me back to when I had first seen it nineteen years ago. Emotions resurfaced from that initial feeling of dread I had felt watching it for my first while curled up under my covers watching it on my iPod Video. I let the video continue playing.

The camerawoman turned a corner into a living room. A typical living room, nothing worth losing your mind over. A couch, a loveseat, a coffee table, and an entertainment center with a large CRT TV tuned to static sitting on it. A noise came from behind her. She spun the living room into a motion blur as she turned around, looking back into the hallway in which she came. Nothing. She turned back around and walked through the living room, slow and deliberate. Panting.

She reached the edge of the living room, at the threshold of the TV‚Äôs static light and an unnaturally dark void of the house. The camera held at what looked like the vague outline of a door, but before she stepped forward, another noise came from behind the woman. She turned. Nothing.

I knew exactly what was going to happen next and yet I felt myself grow tense at it for my first time in so long.

The woman turned to face the abyss, but something changed. A figure stood in the void, its head hunched over, unnaturally long and boney arms dangling to its side. The white fabric of its tarnished gown glowed in the dull gray static. It‚Äôs long hair so dark that in this lighting that it might as well have come from the darkness itself.

With its head and arms raised, the figure‚Äôs elbows were the only joints bending, its hands hanging loosely. The camerawoman gasped. The figure‚Äôs hair parted, revealing a pale face of a deformed woman. Long pointed nose. Eyes without irises, just dark sunken holes resting in the whites of the eyes. Mouth open and huffing, her teeth rotten and black, with a dark substance dripping from the edges of her mouth. She opened her jaw wide open and shrilled. The camerawoman panicked, walked backwards and collided with an offscreen object. She tumbled backwards and the camera cut to black. For the first time in over a decade, that video gave me goosebumps.

‚ÄúDo you see it?‚Äù Agent McLaughlin said.

I nodded. ‚ÄúWhat does this have to do with anything? Did Mike put you up to this?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe video. It‚Äôs everywhere. Check your phone, turn on your TV. It‚Äôs there. It‚Äôs the only thing that‚Äôs there. Trust me.‚Äù Panic sweat across his face. I took a step back and gripped the door, ready to slam it in his face if need be. ‚ÄúGet your phone out, watch any random video. It‚Äôll be there too.‚Äù

‚ÄúI left my phone upstairs.‚Äù It wasn‚Äôt. It was in my pocket.

‚ÄúThen go get it. Watch a random video on it. YouTube, TikTok, something you recorded. Every fricking video has been replaced with it.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to have to ask you to leave or I‚Äôm going to call the cops. Even if you do work for the FBI, this is unprofessional behavior. Please leave.‚Äù I gripped the door harder.

‚ÄúPlease, Eleanor.‚Äù No longer panic on his face, but desperation. He began flipping through his phone. He tapped on something and pointed it towards me. The YouTube splash screen pointed at me. He then tapped the first video and opened it. The shaking camera began playing.

‚ÄúAfter I shut this door, you‚Äôll have five minutes to remove yourself from my property or I‚Äôm calling the cops. The real cops.‚Äù

‚ÄúEleanor, this is serious.‚Äù He took a step forward. ‚ÄúI can explain every-‚Äú

I slammed the door. His five minutes had just begun.

\*\*\*

I locked every lock on that door, including the second deadbolt, just above the first. It had no exterior keyhole, which made it great for shutting out the outside world. A lock I had never locked in my entire stay here because the property‚Äôs landlords, my parents, forbade it. They preferred I kept it unlocked in case of ‚Äúemergencies and surprise visits.‚Äù Thirty-three years old and they still treated me like the rebellious teen that they worked so hard and so futilely to reform. Legally, they had to keep that bolt installed, as long as they planned on continuing renting out this half of the property after I moved out.

The adrenaline ran its course and the lack of sleep caught up with me. I needed coffee. It took about five minutes for a half a pot of coffee to brew. Once it finished brewing, that alleged FBI agent‚Äôs time was up. I went to the kitchen, the tension in my muscles still lingering.

I flicked the coffee grinder on. The smell of ground coffee returned some sense of normality to this morning. I filled the pot with water, took a filter and dumped the pulverized beans into the top. I opened the cabinet above the coffee station, the first two rows filled with mugs. Too many mugs for a single woman living alone, some might say, but to them I said: there are never too many mugs for a single woman living alone. I picked my favorite mug. A commemorative mug decorated in the artwork by my favorite Japanese horror artist. On it, a collage of his most iconic art pieces: a woman smirking towards the camera while a grotesque copy of her face grew sideways out of her head. A man‚Äôs body contorted into a spiral of human flesh, another of a shark sitting on top of spider-like legs. I normally saved the mug for special occasions, but today I needed its comfort.

As the coffee brewed, my mind drifted back to that video. It made no sense why a strange man would show it to me like that. Mike must have found this ‚ÄúFBI Agent‚Äù to fuck with me. That video, something I had accidentally downloaded onto my computer and uploaded to my iPod Video so long ago had been the most important video in my life, much to my parent‚Äôs displeasure with having an embarrassment of a horror loving daughter ruin their picturesque ‚ÄúGood Christian Family‚Äù afterwards. At the time, I hadn‚Äôt known its origins, but now it‚Äôs been so regurgitated and recycled as a concept to a point of parody. It still stuck with me the way first impressions do.

It had to be Mike. Nothing else made sense. I unlocked my phone and shot him a text.

You did it. You made it fucking scary again. Now tell your friend to get off my porch. I sent. And then I followed up with. Still up for linner tonight?

It‚Äôd be a few hours before he‚Äôd text me. That man never woke up before two in the afternoon on most days. Which is why we always called it ‚Äúlinner.‚Äù His lunch, my dinner.

A few linners ago we talked horror movies, as usual, and the topic of our first true scary moments came up. I told him of my infamous moment with ‚Äúeagelton\_witch\_livingroom\_sc.wav,‚Äù and how that out of context clip kept me up for nights.

‚ÄúWait, the Eagleton Witch Project was your first real scare?‚Äù Mike said to me. His glass was half full and his burger was already gone despite it just having got there a few minutes ago.

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I said. Mike had potent feelings about the source material, so I knew exactly where Mike would go with this.

‚ÄúAmateur! Pop-culture loving amateur.‚Äù

‚ÄúAt least I wasn‚Äôt traumatized by a monster in a fucking children‚Äôs movie.‚Äù

‚ÄúLeave mecha-baby out of this. At least his appearance didn‚Äôt ruin horror films for a decade. Found footage was fine when it first started, but afterwards. Pfft.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, and it started with the Eagleton Witch Project. I think my first scare is legitimate.‚Äù

‚ÄúHave you seen the whole movie?‚Äù

I shook my head.

‚ÄúYou call yourself a horror fan and you haven‚Äôt watched the whole thing?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou bastard. First, you call me an amateur for watching it, and now you‚Äôre saying I‚Äôm not a real horror fan?‚Äù

Mike smirked, a shit-eating grin. I shook my head and laughed. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the worst.‚Äù

Our conversation drifted after that to one of Mike‚Äôs wild goose chases for lost and obscure horror media and alleged cursed videos he was looking for He rambled about his never-ending quest for Gyroscope, an alleged cursed video that he was dead set on finding. Nothing more than a dumb creepypasta. An urban legend. I didn‚Äôt believe it. Curses remained in horror movies. They‚Äôd never exist in a world as mundane as ours. Mike must have been trying to mess with me last night though by sending me a file called ‚ÄúGyroscope.mp4‚Äù just last night, which ended up being nothing more than a retitled ‚Äúeagelton\_witch\_livingroom\_sc.wav‚Äù

The coffee finished brewing, and I poured myself a cup. I walked over to the door and checked the peephole. ‚ÄúAgent‚Äù McLaughlin was not there. A small sense of relief washed over me.

I retreated to the living room and turned on the TV, opening up YouTube to decompress. Too tired to actually think, I turned on a lo-fi music station. Just something to have on the background while the coffee still worked on booting up my brain. When the video started, I had thought I had gone insane.

No peaceful animated video. No girl wearing pink headphones endlessly studying while her orange tabby sat on a windowsill looking at a picturesque European backdrop. Not even the chill lo-fi music played. Instead, a shaky handheld video. A panting unseen camerawoman. A turn of the corner. A static TV. A witch. A scream. The ‚Äúeagleton\_witch\_project\_livinginroom\_sc.wav‚Äù rendered in 4K.

Alright, no need to panic. I thought. My YouTube recommendations are littered with horror based content creators. Maybe I accidentally clicked on a video about it. I am sleep deprived after all. I let the video play out, seeing if it would cut to a YouTube talking head, but it didn‚Äôt. Nor did any narration played over the video, instead it repeated, again. And again. And again. Always starting with the panicked breathing and always ending with the witch screaming. What the hell?

I exited the video and opened a random one next to it titled The Ring is Genius And Here‚Äôs Why. I was just thinking about rewatching that movie. The algorithm knew me so well. The video loaded.

A white wall. Panicked breathing from an unseen camerawoman. The living room. A static TV. A witch. A scream. A white wall. Repeating, over and over again.

‚ÄúWhat the fuck?‚Äù I said.

I tried another video.

The same damn footage.

Mike, you had gone way too far with your pranks. But how? Unless he moonlighted as the best hacker on the planet, I had no idea how he pulled off such a thing.

I closed YouTube and opened Netflix. Before the featured content could finish loading, I clicked on the first suggestion. If I moved fast enough, I thought I could beat whatever had been injecting that video into my feed. The red loading icon hung on my screen for much longer than it should have.

Fifteen percent.

Forty-five.

Sixty.

Sixty-five.

Ninety.

Ninety-nine.

Ninety-nine.

Ninety-nine.

Play.

A white wall. Panicked breathing from an unseen camerawoman. The living room. A static TV. I turned the TV off. I had seen enough.

‚ÄúWhat the hell is happening?‚Äù I said.

I opened my phone and shot Mike another text. Alright, you really got me. Now please let me watch Netflix in peace!

Maybe this was Mike‚Äôs way of getting me to invest in physical media. After all, he can‚Äôt help to bring up his extensive collection whenever he gets the chance. A few weeks ago, he told me how he finally added a film projector to his collection. A freaking film projector. As if owning a Blu-Ray player, a DVD player, tape player (VHS and Betamax combo), and Laserdisc weren‚Äôt enough. Wait, physical media.

I had a few DVDs, but no DVD player, at least not plugged into my TV. I grabbed one from the self and walked up the narrow stairs to my bedroom to fetch my laptop. My laptop, at least, still had a disc drive.

I left the lights off, and blinds closed. Ignoring the clothes on the floor, I hurried to my desk. Opening the laptop, I popped the disc drive open. The email Mike sent me last night titled ‚ÄúI think I found it!‚Äù was still open, with Gyroscope.mp4 playing on VLC next to it, playing that same clip from the Eagleton Witch Project on repeat. I wondered now if it was some sort of virus that affected my entire network. I slid the DVD into the drive and popped it closed. The menu opened, and I hit play.

The same white wall with the shaking camera facing it, accompanied by the same panicked breathing.

Fucking Mike.

\*\*\*

Maybe he had given me a virus. Maybe Mike was up to no good. Maybe he had gotten into trouble with the law. Maybe that was why an FBI agent appeared on my doorstep this morning. Shit.

I shut my laptop and stood up.

Walking over to the door, I thought I saw something in the corner of my eye. A pale figure in the dark corner of the bedroom. I looked towards it, but saw nothing. I shook my head and groaned. This sleep deprivation was getting to me.

‚ÄúI need some fucking sleep,‚Äù I said. I walked out of the room and went downstairs and out the front door, hoping that the FBI agent hadn‚Äôt driven away already.

I stepped outside wearing nothing but sweats and a tank top. That had been a mistake. The cool autumn morning air wrapped itself around me, goosebumps formed, and I shivered. I considered going back in for my jacket, but I pushed those thoughts aside. I needed to find that socially awkward FBI agent before he left, if I hadn‚Äôt scared him off already with my threats of calling the police.

I scanned the curbside for an official vehicle or something. What even do FBI agents drive? I didn‚Äôt know what to look for other than something vaguely cop car looking with the letters ‚ÄúFBI‚Äù printed on the side. I skimmed the usual crowd of cars. An unwashed raised truck. My old Nissan Sentra that had lost all of its protective coating, rust patches formed on the blue paint like mold. A white van with ‚ÄúElmer‚Äôs Painting Service‚Äù that belonged to my duplex neighbor. Although I knew for sure that his name was not Elmer, it was Frank, because my parents always called ‚ÄúFrank‚Äù their favorite tenant. No cop car with FBI printed on the side. I sighed. I almost went inside when I heard a yapping dog.

I turned my attention to it. A woman in a puffy baby blue coat was walking a small dog down at the end of the block. The dog yapped at a squirrel across the street while the woman tried to calm it. The woman and dog were of no interest to me. What caught my eye was the foreign maroon Honda Odyssey parked next to them, still idling. I didn‚Äôt recognize the car. Desperate, I approached it.

The woman and dog had crossed the street by the time I had approached the van. The van hummed in the quiet morning. A white trail of exhaust flowed from the rear exhaust pipe, dissipating into the air. I approached the driver‚Äôs side window and looked in. Agent McLaughlin sat at the wheel, staring off into the distance. I knocked on the window. He jumped.

Once the look of panic subsided, he rolled down the window and looked at me with dry red eyes.

‚ÄúJust what the hell is going on?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs everywhere. Ever since I watched you-,‚Äù he paused, ‚ÄúI watched that video last night. It‚Äôs infected everywhere. Is it everywhere for you too?‚Äù

‚ÄúAt least everything in my house. YouTube, Netflix, my freaking DVDs.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, thank God I‚Äôm not going not going crazy,‚Äù he said with a sense of relief.

‚ÄúHow do you know about this? Is Mike on some sort of list? Am I on some sort of list?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a long story.‚Äù

‚ÄúSay it.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not going to like what you hear,‚Äù he shivered.

‚ÄúAgent McLaughlin, I need to know what exactly is going on and how I fit into this.‚Äù

He looked away and closed his eyes. He took a deep breath and held it before sighing.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs true that I work for the FBI. My job is very important. But I come here on personal business because nobody at the Bureau would believe what is happening to me.‚Äù He took another deep breath before continuing. ‚ÄúThis thing that seems to be afflicting both of us. I know nothing about it. I was hoping that you would have a better idea.‚Äù He opened his eyes and looked at me.

I shook my head in annoyance. What would I know about this? How would he even suspect me to know anything about this? What, was I mistakenly put on a short list of contact-in-case-of-cursed people?

‚ÄúDo you?‚Äù He said, as if he hadn‚Äôt seen me shake my head.

‚ÄúNo, I know nothing about anything going on right now. Why did you reach out to me?‚Äù

‚ÄúMy job.‚Äù he took another deep breath. ‚ÄúI am not a field agent. I‚Äôm just an office worker. A monitor. It‚Äôs my job to monitor the web traffic of certain people. After it started happening last night, shortly after you opened that attachment, I couldn‚Äôt see anything but the video. Everywhere, even on my phone. I thought I had infected the computer, but when I showed my coworkers they didn‚Äôt see what I saw. Not on my phone, not on my computer. I thought I was going crazy.‚Äù

‚ÄúWait. Did you say after you watched me open that attachment? What do you mean ‚Äòwatched me‚Äô?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe have a list of triggers that automatically flag people for our ‚ÄòJust Keeping Tabs‚Äô list. Most people on it are not involved in anything illicit or illegal, but when they are flagged, we assign an agent to monitor them for up to six months.‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you saying what I think you‚Äôre saying?‚Äù I took a step back.

He nodded.

‚ÄúNo way.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry Eleanor,‚Äù he took a deep breath. ‚ÄúBut you‚Äôre my assignment and I‚Äôve been spying on you.‚Äù

I‚Äôm in a terrible mood, can‚Äôt socialize with the people close to me and just hope every day will end soon. How much energy do I still have left for this? 

Maybe I (M33) am overreacting over her F(30). We dated for half a year. Everything felt very natural, we got along, spent beautiful days, laughed together but overall took it slow. I mean, we didn‚Äôt call ourself a couple. It felt like we would just enjoy each other and the moment. She always gave me the feeling of being safe, to finally have something prescious that I need to take care of. I tried so hard and all I got was a text message ‚Äûsorry this situationship is not going anywhere‚Äú. And that was it. From one day to another (at least for me). I tried talking to her and end things at least maturely. What we did. After some weeks I wrote a message and she agreed to meet for a coffee. All very friendly but she insisted that this is on a friendship basis. I told her that I like her a lot but that a friendship is completely off the table for me. If we‚Äôd like to meet again, some day, than only to see if we make things work again, but never as a friend. 

I spent my summer with several other dates, all went bad. I was not really interested and only mourned what I had before. After like two months of zero contact I asked if she wanted to drink a coffee again. She was in between two vacations, but suggested a day. We met, it was a bit odd at the beginning but than quite nice. We talked about everything that‚Äôs going on, but not about relationships or anything. I wanted not to come off too strong. But after the meeting I suggested to do that again and she said ok. 
On her vacation, she didn‚Äôt write a single time. Now she‚Äôs back since two days. So almost three weeks have passed since that meeting. I casually wrote her again today, to which she replied like after 12 hours, without any real chance for a conversation start. I‚Äôm tempted to try to start the conversation, but I don‚Äôt think there is any real scenario in which this is how dating starts or how a person reacts that is interested in me. 

I‚Äôm kicked back to where I was four months ago. Somehow full of hope. Waiting confidently for two weeks, imagining she would write after her return and set up a meeting. But there‚Äôs nothing and most likely our last meeting was just a friendship thing for her again. 

I don‚Äôt have energy anymore. I prefer it all to stop, because I can‚Äôt even imagine how anything should get better with me.",1,1756842282.0,heartbreak,0,1.0,False

Many people wouldn‚Äôt have been so relieved to see an FBI agent standing on their doorstep unannounced the first thing in the morning, but honestly, it was a hell of a lot better than my parents. FBI agents operate under specific protocols and restrictions, parents do not.

The morning sun‚Äôs dull glow behind the agent illuminated the outside world as it peaked from over the horizon, out of view. It had been months since I‚Äôd seen the aura of the morning. I had almost forgotten what it looked like. It reminded me of my old commute. Oh, how much I hated it.

‚ÄúEleanor Layne?‚Äù The agent asked. He flashed his badge again. I guess just in case I had been too drowsy to register it the first time. He stood about six feet, not much older than I, mid-thirties, and with tired eyes.

‚ÄúYes?‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúAnd you are?‚Äù

‚ÄúAgent Dale McLaughlin, FBI. May I come in?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat is this about?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt would be a lot easier to explain if I came in.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you need a warrant or something?‚Äù I crossed my arms.

‚ÄúPlease let me in. This is serious.‚Äù Behind him, a cool hint of the mid-October breeze drifted in. I shivered.

‚ÄúNot serious enough for a warrant, I presume. Are you going to tell me what you want, or what?‚Äù

‚ÄúI uh,‚Äù the agent said. He looked unsure of himself. ‚ÄúLet me show you.‚Äù

He opened up his jacket, one of those navy blue windbreaks that you see actors playing agents like him in movies and police procedurals wearing. I couldn‚Äôt see the back, but if life was anything like the movies, then I‚Äôd assume that it had large yellow typeface letters spelling out F-B-I, just like the smaller iteration of the yellow letters in the front. He withdrew his phone from an interior pocket.

He unlocked it, tapped around, and held it out horizontally towards me while a video played.

It took me a moment to register the video, but once my tired brain made the connections, I knew exactly what it was. The same video Mike had sent me last night. The same video I had watched many times, like listening to a song on repeat in an attempt to relive those same initial emotions of fear and dread. The same video that impressed itself upon my young teenage brain and changed my entire life. I still remembered the file name in Limewire: eagelton\_witch\_livingroom\_sc.wav. And now this random FBI agent was showing it to me.

The first shot faced a wall, white dry wall. Not a static shot, though, but a trembling one. A classic trope of found footage films. Through her deep unsettled panting, the unseen camera operator made her presence known. Or she would have if Agent McLaughlin had the volume on. He seemed to notice this and turned the phone towards him before pressing the volume key up. While doing so, he held his head at a slight angle, his face scrunched, and his eyes flicking away and towards the phone. The panting grew louder until it was audible. He then turned the phone back to me.

I didn‚Äôt need to let it play out, since I had seen the clip so many times before. After Mike‚Äôs email last night, it was still fresh in my mind. However, there was something about watching it on a strange man‚Äôs phone early in the morning while standing in the chilly autumn breeze that took me back to when I had first seen it nineteen years ago. Emotions resurfaced from that initial feeling of dread I had felt watching it for my first while curled up under my covers watching it on my iPod Video. I let the video continue playing.

The camerawoman turned a corner into a living room. A typical living room, nothing worth losing your mind over. A couch, a loveseat, a coffee table, and an entertainment center with a large CRT TV tuned to static sitting on it. A noise came from behind her. She spun the living room into a motion blur as she turned around, looking back into the hallway in which she came. Nothing. She turned back around and walked through the living room, slow and deliberate. Panting.

She reached the edge of the living room, at the threshold of the TV‚Äôs static light and an unnaturally dark void of the house. The camera held at what looked like the vague outline of a door, but before she stepped forward, another noise came from behind the woman. She turned. Nothing.

I knew exactly what was going to happen next and yet I felt myself grow tense at it for my first time in so long.

The woman turned to face the abyss, but something changed. A figure stood in the void, its head hunched over, unnaturally long and boney arms dangling to its side. The white fabric of its tarnished gown glowed in the dull gray static. It‚Äôs long hair so dark that in this lighting that it might as well have come from the darkness itself.

With its head and arms raised, the figure‚Äôs elbows were the only joints bending, its hands hanging loosely. The camerawoman gasped. The figure‚Äôs hair parted, revealing a pale face of a deformed woman. Long pointed nose. Eyes without irises, just dark sunken holes resting in the whites of the eyes. Mouth open and huffing, her teeth rotten and black, with a dark substance dripping from the edges of her mouth. She opened her jaw wide open and shrilled. The camerawoman panicked, walked backwards and collided with an offscreen object. She tumbled backwards and the camera cut to black. For the first time in over a decade, that video gave me goosebumps.

‚ÄúDo you see it?‚Äù Agent McLaughlin said.

I nodded. ‚ÄúWhat does this have to do with anything? Did Mike put you up to this?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe video. It‚Äôs everywhere. Check your phone, turn on your TV. It‚Äôs there. It‚Äôs the only thing that‚Äôs there. Trust me.‚Äù Panic sweat across his face. I took a step back and gripped the door, ready to slam it in his face if need be. ‚ÄúGet your phone out, watch any random video. It‚Äôll be there too.‚Äù

‚ÄúI left my phone upstairs.‚Äù It wasn‚Äôt. It was in my pocket.

‚ÄúThen go get it. Watch a random video on it. YouTube, TikTok, something you recorded. Every fricking video has been replaced with it.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to have to ask you to leave or I‚Äôm going to call the cops. Even if you do work for the FBI, this is unprofessional behavior. Please leave.‚Äù I gripped the door harder.

‚ÄúPlease, Eleanor.‚Äù No longer panic on his face, but desperation. He began flipping through his phone. He tapped on something and pointed it towards me. The YouTube splash screen pointed at me. He then tapped the first video and opened it. The shaking camera began playing.

‚ÄúAfter I shut this door, you‚Äôll have five minutes to remove yourself from my property or I‚Äôm calling the cops. The real cops.‚Äù

‚ÄúEleanor, this is serious.‚Äù He took a step forward. ‚ÄúI can explain every-‚Äú

I slammed the door. His five minutes had just begun.

\*\*\*

I locked every lock on that door, including the second deadbolt, just above the first. It had no exterior keyhole, which made it great for shutting out the outside world. A lock I had never locked in my entire stay here because the property‚Äôs landlords, my parents, forbade it. They preferred I kept it unlocked in case of ‚Äúemergencies and surprise visits.‚Äù Thirty-three years old and they still treated me like the rebellious teen that they worked so hard and so futilely to reform. Legally, they had to keep that bolt installed, as long as they planned on continuing renting out this half of the property after I moved out.

I flicked the coffee grinder on. The smell of ground coffee returned some sense of normality to this morning. I filled the pot with water, took a filter and dumped the pulverized beans into the top. I opened the cabinet above the coffee station, the first two rows filled with mugs. Too many mugs for a single woman living alone, some might say, but to them I said: there are never too many mugs for a single woman living alone. I picked my favorite mug. A commemorative mug decorated in the artwork by my favorite Japanese horror artist. On it, a collage of his most iconic art pieces: a woman smirking towards the camera while a grotesque copy of her face grew sideways out of her head. A man‚Äôs body contorted into a spiral of human flesh, another of a shark sitting on top of spider-like legs. I normally saved the mug for special occasions, but today I needed its comfort.

It‚Äôd be a few hours before he‚Äôd text me. That man never woke up before two in the afternoon on most days. Which is why we always called it ‚Äúlinner.‚Äù His lunch, my dinner.

A few linners ago we talked horror movies, as usual, and the topic of our first true scary moments came up. I told him of my infamous moment with ‚Äúeagelton\_witch\_livingroom\_sc.wav,‚Äù and how that out of context clip kept me up for nights.

‚ÄúWait, the Eagleton Witch Project was your first real scare?‚Äù Mike said to me. His glass was half full and his burger was already gone despite it just having got there a few minutes ago.

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I said. Mike had potent feelings about the source material, so I knew exactly where Mike would go with this.

‚ÄúAmateur! Pop-culture loving amateur.‚Äù

‚ÄúAt least I wasn‚Äôt traumatized by a monster in a fucking children‚Äôs movie.‚Äù

‚ÄúLeave mecha-baby out of this. At least his appearance didn‚Äôt ruin horror films for a decade. Found footage was fine when it first started, but afterwards. Pfft.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, and it started with the Eagleton Witch Project. I think my first scare is legitimate.‚Äù

‚ÄúHave you seen the whole movie?‚Äù

I shook my head.

‚ÄúYou call yourself a horror fan and you haven‚Äôt watched the whole thing?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou bastard. First, you call me an amateur for watching it, and now you‚Äôre saying I‚Äôm not a real horror fan?‚Äù

Mike smirked, a shit-eating grin. I shook my head and laughed. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the worst.‚Äù

Our conversation drifted after that to one of Mike‚Äôs wild goose chases for lost and obscure horror media and alleged cursed videos he was looking for He rambled about his never-ending quest for Gyroscope, an alleged cursed video that he was dead set on finding. Nothing more than a dumb creepypasta. An urban legend. I didn‚Äôt believe it. Curses remained in horror movies. They‚Äôd never exist in a world as mundane as ours. Mike must have been trying to mess with me last night though by sending me a file called ‚ÄúGyroscope.mp4‚Äù just last night, which ended up being nothing more than a retitled ‚Äúeagelton\_witch\_livingroom\_sc.wav‚Äù

The coffee finished brewing, and I poured myself a cup. I walked over to the door and checked the peephole. ‚ÄúAgent‚Äù McLaughlin was not there. A small sense of relief washed over me.

I retreated to the living room and turned on the TV, opening up YouTube to decompress. Too tired to actually think, I turned on a lo-fi music station. Just something to have on the background while the coffee still worked on booting up my brain. When the video started, I had thought I had gone insane.

No peaceful animated video. No girl wearing pink headphones endlessly studying while her orange tabby sat on a windowsill looking at a picturesque European backdrop. Not even the chill lo-fi music played. Instead, a shaky handheld video. A panting unseen camerawoman. A turn of the corner. A static TV. A witch. A scream. The ‚Äúeagleton\_witch\_project\_livinginroom\_sc.wav‚Äù rendered in 4K.

Alright, no need to panic. I thought. My YouTube recommendations are littered with horror based content creators. Maybe I accidentally clicked on a video about it. I am sleep deprived after all. I let the video play out, seeing if it would cut to a YouTube talking head, but it didn‚Äôt. Nor did any narration played over the video, instead it repeated, again. And again. And again. Always starting with the panicked breathing and always ending with the witch screaming. What the hell?

I exited the video and opened a random one next to it titled The Ring is Genius And Here‚Äôs Why. I was just thinking about rewatching that movie. The algorithm knew me so well. The video loaded.

A white wall. Panicked breathing from an unseen camerawoman. The living room. A static TV. A witch. A scream. A white wall. Repeating, over and over again.

‚ÄúWhat the fuck?‚Äù I said.

I tried another video.

The same damn footage.

Mike, you had gone way too far with your pranks. But how? Unless he moonlighted as the best hacker on the planet, I had no idea how he pulled off such a thing.

I closed YouTube and opened Netflix. Before the featured content could finish loading, I clicked on the first suggestion. If I moved fast enough, I thought I could beat whatever had been injecting that video into my feed. The red loading icon hung on my screen for much longer than it should have.

Fifteen percent.

Forty-five.

Sixty.

Sixty-five.

Ninety.

Ninety-nine.

Ninety-nine.

Ninety-nine.

Play.

A white wall. Panicked breathing from an unseen camerawoman. The living room. A static TV. I turned the TV off. I had seen enough.

‚ÄúWhat the hell is happening?‚Äù I said.

I opened my phone and shot Mike another text. Alright, you really got me. Now please let me watch Netflix in peace!

Maybe this was Mike‚Äôs way of getting me to invest in physical media. After all, he can‚Äôt help to bring up his extensive collection whenever he gets the chance. A few weeks ago, he told me how he finally added a film projector to his collection. A freaking film projector. As if owning a Blu-Ray player, a DVD player, tape player (VHS and Betamax combo), and Laserdisc weren‚Äôt enough. Wait, physical media.

I had a few DVDs, but no DVD player, at least not plugged into my TV. I grabbed one from the self and walked up the narrow stairs to my bedroom to fetch my laptop. My laptop, at least, still had a disc drive.

I left the lights off, and blinds closed. Ignoring the clothes on the floor, I hurried to my desk. Opening the laptop, I popped the disc drive open. The email Mike sent me last night titled ‚ÄúI think I found it!‚Äù was still open, with Gyroscope.mp4 playing on VLC next to it, playing that same clip from the Eagleton Witch Project on repeat. I wondered now if it was some sort of virus that affected my entire network. I slid the DVD into the drive and popped it closed. The menu opened, and I hit play.

The same white wall with the shaking camera facing it, accompanied by the same panicked breathing.

Fucking Mike.

\*\*\*

Maybe he had given me a virus. Maybe Mike was up to no good. Maybe he had gotten into trouble with the law. Maybe that was why an FBI agent appeared on my doorstep this morning. Shit.

I shut my laptop and stood up.

Walking over to the door, I thought I saw something in the corner of my eye. A pale figure in the dark corner of the bedroom. I looked towards it, but saw nothing. I shook my head and groaned. This sleep deprivation was getting to me.

‚ÄúI need some fucking sleep,‚Äù I said. I walked out of the room and went downstairs and out the front door, hoping that the FBI agent hadn‚Äôt driven away already.

I stepped outside wearing nothing but sweats and a tank top. That had been a mistake. The cool autumn morning air wrapped itself around me, goosebumps formed, and I shivered. I considered going back in for my jacket, but I pushed those thoughts aside. I needed to find that socially awkward FBI agent before he left, if I hadn‚Äôt scared him off already with my threats of calling the police.

I scanned the curbside for an official vehicle or something. What even do FBI agents drive? I didn‚Äôt know what to look for other than something vaguely cop car looking with the letters ‚ÄúFBI‚Äù printed on the side. I skimmed the usual crowd of cars. An unwashed raised truck. My old Nissan Sentra that had lost all of its protective coating, rust patches formed on the blue paint like mold. A white van with ‚ÄúElmer‚Äôs Painting Service‚Äù that belonged to my duplex neighbor. Although I knew for sure that his name was not Elmer, it was Frank, because my parents always called ‚ÄúFrank‚Äù their favorite tenant. No cop car with FBI printed on the side. I sighed. I almost went inside when I heard a yapping dog.

I turned my attention to it. A woman in a puffy baby blue coat was walking a small dog down at the end of the block. The dog yapped at a squirrel across the street while the woman tried to calm it. The woman and dog were of no interest to me. What caught my eye was the foreign maroon Honda Odyssey parked next to them, still idling. I didn‚Äôt recognize the car. Desperate, I approached it.

The woman and dog had crossed the street by the time I had approached the van. The van hummed in the quiet morning. A white trail of exhaust flowed from the rear exhaust pipe, dissipating into the air. I approached the driver‚Äôs side window and looked in. Agent McLaughlin sat at the wheel, staring off into the distance. I knocked on the window. He jumped.

Once the look of panic subsided, he rolled down the window and looked at me with dry red eyes.

‚ÄúJust what the hell is going on?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs everywhere. Ever since I watched you-,‚Äù he paused, ‚ÄúI watched that video last night. It‚Äôs infected everywhere. Is it everywhere for you too?‚Äù

‚ÄúAt least everything in my house. YouTube, Netflix, my freaking DVDs.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, thank God I‚Äôm not going not going crazy,‚Äù he said with a sense of relief.

‚ÄúHow do you know about this? Is Mike on some sort of list? Am I on some sort of list?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a long story.‚Äù

‚ÄúSay it.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not going to like what you hear,‚Äù he shivered.

‚ÄúAgent McLaughlin, I need to know what exactly is going on and how I fit into this.‚Äù

He looked away and closed his eyes. He took a deep breath and held it before sighing.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs true that I work for the FBI. My job is very important. But I come here on personal business because nobody at the Bureau would believe what is happening to me.‚Äù He took another deep breath before continuing. ‚ÄúThis thing that seems to be afflicting both of us. I know nothing about it. I was hoping that you would have a better idea.‚Äù He opened his eyes and looked at me.

I shook my head in annoyance. What would I know about this? How would he even suspect me to know anything about this? What, was I mistakenly put on a short list of contact-in-case-of-cursed people?

‚ÄúDo you?‚Äù He said, as if he hadn‚Äôt seen me shake my head.

‚ÄúNo, I know nothing about anything going on right now. Why did you reach out to me?‚Äù

‚ÄúMy job.‚Äù he took another deep breath. ‚ÄúI am not a field agent. I‚Äôm just an office worker. A monitor. It‚Äôs my job to monitor the web traffic of certain people. After it started happening last night, shortly after you opened that attachment, I couldn‚Äôt see anything but the video. Everywhere, even on my phone. I thought I had infected the computer, but when I showed my coworkers they didn‚Äôt see what I saw. Not on my phone, not on my computer. I thought I was going crazy.‚Äù

‚ÄúWait. Did you say after you watched me open that attachment? What do you mean ‚Äòwatched me‚Äô?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe have a list of triggers that automatically flag people for our ‚ÄòJust Keeping Tabs‚Äô list. Most people on it are not involved in anything illicit or illegal, but when they are flagged, we assign an agent to monitor them for up to six months.‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you saying what I think you‚Äôre saying?‚Äù I took a step back.

He nodded.

‚ÄúNo way.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry Eleanor,‚Äù he took a deep breath. ‚ÄúBut you‚Äôre my assignment and I‚Äôve been spying on you.‚Äù

1n6tda4,https://www.reddit.com/r/AFIB/comments/1n6tda4/ectopic_heart_beats/,Ectopic Heart Beats,"I have had permanent afib for 5 years and I am being treated with Digoxin, Metoprolol Tartrate and Apixan.

My heart rate is usually within the range of 50 - 100 bpm.

I had an electro-cardioversion which did not work and my cardiac specialist said that my chances of success with ablation treatment would be less than 25%.

With long term permanent afib, the same very low 25% chance of success also applies to a pharmacological cardioversion being successful.

I am aware that long term studies show little difference in the long term outcomes when rhythm control is compared to rate control treatment.

I was advised that I should avoid caffeine, but more recent studies have shown that the risks of caffeine in afib has been over stressed and that some studies suggest it isn't harmful in afib and may have benefits.

Because of this I have been consuming 4 - 5 cups of instant coffee throughout the day as I am exhausted due to afib and caffeine helps me a lot. I can now live with less tiredness and exhaustion. My caffeine consumption seems to only have a temporary affect of increase my heart rate to 80bpm while consuming it. But I consume caffeine/coffee 4-5 times a day.

I have raised the issue of tiredness of exhaustion my cardiac specialist, but unfortunately she regards this problem as something I have to cope with when living with afib and she is quit happy with the rate control achieved by my current medications.

Very recently I had an ECG done as I am booked in to see my specialist in 10 days. The clinician made a comment about there being  plenty of extra Ectopic Beats showing up on the ECG.

Are Ectopic Beats are a cause for concern, are they dangerous or detrimental to my heart health over the long term?

I believe they are being caused by my caffeine consumption. Am I currently endangering my health with my caffeine consumption?.

Should I switch back to decaffeinated coffee, which I am quite reluctant to do.

I don't want to return to living like a zombie and be constantly tired and exhausted.

I will be raising this matter with my cardiac specialist in 10 days time, but I know she will most likely stand by the old fashioned advice of avoiding caffeine.

So just how bad is the presence of frequent Ectopic Beats with afib.",1,1756842072.0,AFIB,2,1.0,False

[Part I](https://www.reddit.com/r/NatureofPredators/comments/1lwnnor/scorch_directive_ficnap_balance_of_vengeance_pt_1/)

The prayer from the Qaitbay Mosque wakes me up before the alarm does. The muezzin growls with the usual neo-human roughness, and thanks to the ancient, Pre-Glassing speaker system I can discern only the repeating ‚ÄúSubhanallah!‚Äù‚Äô.

The morning sun filters through the paper-like blinds into the small room I take up in the staff quarters, drawing reddish shadows around the scant interior. Dust glimmers in the hair-thin rays of sunlight and the AC chuffs like a chainsmoker on his deathbed. 

It‚Äôs still AC, though. Still electricity.

Luxury. This whole room, despite its threadbare furnishings, is a luxury that the United Dominion finally gifted me after years of communal living. 

Mine. *Mine alone*. No more spending every waking hour under the eyes of someone else, even if they‚Äôre your friends or close ones - fellow orphans, then fellow trainees. 

Waking up, I am alone to hear my thoughts bounce around in the head.

Luxury. But it began to wear on me‚Ä¶

I blindly stretch my hand to the left, feeling for the thin sheets. Empty. Cold. 

What little warmth there was must‚Äôve escaped earlier in the morning, together with a hundred creds and on her tip-toes, careful to not wake me up.

Of course. She has other clients to serve, and that scraggly-looking old-breed that hovered around us, didn‚Äôt look like someone that would approve of his asset *idling*.

I sigh and close my eyes. A childish fantasy plays out in my semi-dreaming mind: follow the girl to the slums, see how that damn pimp is abusing her, tear the fucker to ribbons. Bite his face off. 

Take her down the stairs, the frail body cradled in my arms. Then rent her a room closer to the markets, convince her to take the serum so she would stop selling herself out. 

Do something good with‚Ä¶ *this*.

I stare at my hand - at the brown-ish, semi-translucent claws that push up from the fingertips to then gently curve and taper to a rather cruel point.

Last night she constantly squirmed under the lightest touch. I was mindful - yet, their skin bruises so easily. 

Her arms, back and chest bore a testament to others being not so gentle. 

I clench my hand into a loose fist. Almost 5 am, time to get up and shine.

Mornings are not my time. Too quiet, too‚Ä¶ fresh. Still, there‚Äôs hot running water, and a steady supply of soap and toothpaste, and you don‚Äôt need to fight someone else to use them.

The guard uniform is neatly folded over the chair (did I do it or she did, as a final jest of gratitude?) and I gladly slip into it after all the grooming is done. 

The uniform grounds me, gives a sense of purpose. The patch on the arm - DOA Security, grey and orange - brings about an aura of authority.

I grab the container with last dinner‚Äôs leftovers from the mini-fridge, and then - my sunglasses, angular, heavy and opaque enough to tune the world around me to a perma-twilight. 

Whoever was the bigwig in the former UN that decided to put the MENA Office of Alignment in Egypt, that man or woman had a certain sense of humor. It‚Äôs Sunlight Central here, and neither Arxur nor we enjoy it.

At least my tan starts to resemble an *actual tan* after all these years of training the skin. Must be my dad‚Äôs genes, because it is unlikely that my Serbian mother, with her fair skin and ashen hair, would‚Äôve been able to produce anything more than a single freckle and an extensive sunburn here.

My reflection snarls suddenly, baring fangs that seem so out of place that they for a second startle me. 
Basque, Serbian. Who my parents where, what did, what they liked - I never really *knew* it. All of it is just dry data, pieced together only recently from the Archive of Grief upon my inquiries. Colored by imagination.

Even their real faces fade from memory year after year. Replaced with an *approximation* that is more wishful imagination of an adult man than reality.

I shut my mouth. Then try for a tighter-lipped smile. It comes out unsure, almost fake.

Bah, who cares. Another day in paradise is waiting. 

I pack my eyes behind the black plastic and check for the sandy fatigues to be spotless. 


***

Even so early in the morning, the Office of Alignment‚Äôs compound is a hive of activity. Kitchen staff pushes squeaky carts through the echoing corridors, maids scurry about in flutters of clean sheets and towels. 

The compound was a lakeside resort prior to the Glassing. Then it was a shelter, a makeshift hospital, and then - this. Fantastically, many of the surviving workers of the hotel returned here when word got out that it had been transformed into the local Arxurian ‚Äúembassy‚Äù.

Of course, a lot of the marble tiling fell off, baring patchy concrete. There‚Äôs spiky weeds growing in the driveway fountain, and half of buildings had been caged in scaffolding for renovations that never came. In some unused spaces you could read scribbles that the un-treated, dying men and women left on the walls. 

What‚Äôs new and shiny is the fencing. Sturdy concrete pillars are overgrown by razorwire coils, and the heavy checkpoint gate is covered in CCTV barnacles. Retractable turrets look down on the desolation around.

The Arxur are yet to be seen. They sleep in, as night creatures do. Besides, the bright hot sun that crawls over Fayium hurts their eyes just like it does mine.

I cross the inner courtyard quickly and dive into the security bloc. Punch my thumb into the scanner and out of the humid outside heat submerge into the cooled locker room.

Only Kareem is there, changing from his night-shift clothes to civilian garb. I ogle the younger guy for a few seconds, envious of the serum-born - Kareem belongs to the first generation that hadn‚Äôt *taken* the serum, but entered the world with its genetic edits coursing through their veins. 
No doubt he wore plastic claw-caps and chewed on Arxur-formulated bloodjelly toys, while the likes of me had to be hooked to IVs to make the bone-breaking transformation somewhat bearable.  

Serum-born. When I was turned into something impressively monstrous by the ‚Äúvamp roids‚Äù, Kareem is simply impressive. A walking showpiece of super-human physique.

‚ÄúSalam‚Äù, he throws in my direction as he‚Äôs putting his shoes on. 

‚ÄúAleykum assalam‚Äù, I reply habitually. ‚ÄúSay, Kareem, anything happen overnight?‚Äù

He shrugs, wipes some sweat from under his aquiline nose.

‚ÄúNope. Some *gharib* paced under the fence north of the old pool, for like half an hour around 2 am, but I sent a k-dog, and he ran away‚Äù, he furrows his brows in thought. ‚ÄúOh, and the crocs had a party, I think.‚Äù

‚ÄúReally?‚Äù I start digging out my gear from my locker: a heavy LED torch, duty belt, my Walther HPP tucked into the holster, first-aid kit and other bits. 

‚ÄúYeah, yeah. Heard the throat singing, and that drum music. Screaming, too - desperate, almost‚Ä¶ animal-like. You saw the crate they got delivered a few days back, with all that convoy?‚Äù

Yes. The black SUVs with diplomatic plates. The crate. Large and *padded* on the outside, with vent holes peppering its sides. 

Didn‚Äôt take that much brainpower to figure out there was something *alive* within.

I nod. Kareem mouths something like ‚ÄúAllah yerhamo‚Äù, his dark, almost black eyes for a second focusing on the empty locker before him. 

No further words are needed, we both know what happened. Not the first time.

The embassy staffers, that is: Hunter-Communicator Shuzet, Hunter-Liason Vesyth and even Kezef herself, had devoured some captive Fed bastard as part of whatever celebrations they had.

Well, I‚Äôm not going to shed any tears for it. Why should I care how the aliens spend their free time?

That thing they ate probably deserved it - and worse.

‚ÄúAre you going home, or‚Ä¶‚Äù, I shake my lunch box in an inviting manner. ‚ÄúGonna have breakfast with us? Raffi and Farouk seem to have already left, hm. And Jose‚Ä¶‚Äù.

‚ÄùI could go for a coffee‚Äù, he runs his fingers over his thin, meticulously contoured beard in thought, then grins. ‚ÄúActually, for anything that ensures I don‚Äôt have to see my mother and hear her yap about some girl she found for me.‚Äù

It‚Äôs a light-hearted joke, I understand, but I can‚Äôt share it. 

I simply don‚Äôt know how it is to be so sick of your parents that they become annoying or a burden, so I slide the HPP‚Äôs magazines in their own little pouches, and we leave.

‚ÄúHey Luka! Salam, Kareem‚Äù

‚ÄúSalam Haji, Suhrat ‚Ä¶ Hey, Ingrid!‚Äù

‚ÄúSalam!‚Äù

The little security cantina must‚Äôve been made for a couple of janitors and not a whole security team. If the ceiling was any bit lower, I‚Äôd brush it with my head. We pack in it like sardines in a can. 

But we don‚Äôt complain. There‚Äôs a table, a windowsill turned into a counter, a microwave, coffee machine, an old-timey curved TV even. Small comforts, but these days they make all the difference.

Kareem immediately beelines to the coffee machine and settles behind an already-waiting Suhrat, while I walk over to the cooler to pour me some water and watch everyone through half-lidded eyes.

So much time passed‚Ä¶, and yet, some remnant of hard-wired, genetic memory triggers in my mind every time I‚Äôm among my people. 

*My people*. Strange to even think about them that way, but just two decades ago you‚Äôd find such a collection of human beings only in ads for a new high-end gym or in a movie about ripped life-guards. Not in a dingy little room that smells of sweat, cheap coffee and re-heated falafel,  in some middle-of-nowhere desert ass-crack.

Each and every one of us had been elevated to the peak of their biological potential. Flaws and all, broken bones, bad hair or skin, crooked features, but - elevated. 

No, not ‚Äúelevated‚Äù. *Unlocked*. Like humanity was finally led behind the paywall where all the genetic goodies were handed out. 

At times, I try to see us like old-breeds do, those same old-breeds that, according to old flat-films, walked the streets of our cities as a mass of bloated, slobby, unkempt‚Ä¶ waste? 

So - what would they see in *us* now? The ancient marble statues of gods coming to life or something more sinister, the ‚Äúvampires‚Äù as they started to call us? Hard to tell. It‚Äôs a persistent brainworm none the less.

*‚Äù‚Ä¶ the ‚ÄúAct on Mandatory Reclamation Serum Uptake‚Äù will be presented to the WHO Executive Committee on Thursday in Tirana. Opponents of the Act continue to insist that, quote - ‚Äúa forced serumization stands as a gross violation of the Human Rights Charter, and the world would be united in its strong opposition and condemnation of such sweeping autocratic moves by the increasingly belligerent UN‚Ä¶‚Äù*

It‚Äôs important stuff, I think, but nobody else pays attention to the TV‚Äôs yapping. 

Haji complains loudly about Fayium‚Äôs traffic in Arabic - I know because the words ‚Äúcar‚Äù, ‚Äúfuck‚Äù and ‚Äústuck‚Äù are among the ones I *can* discern among his coughing cadence. 

Suhrat, the new guy, skittish and evidently still uncomfortable in the uniform, nods in enthusiastic agreement with Haji as the coffee machine finally spits out some tar-like liquid into his cup.

Our perpetually sunburnt valkyrie Ingrid motions me to sit down by her side at the table. 

I‚Äôd oblige - lest she decides to break my neck, like I‚Äôve seen her do to a training dummy - but I need to reheat the leftovers, and motion at the microwave. She flashes me a grandmotherly smile, and proceeds  to peel her lobster-red nose.

‚ÄúMorning, big guy‚Ä¶‚Äù, Carl Mahler, our Head of Security greets me without tearing away from his pad. We call him ‚ÄúChief‚Äù - no relation to the Arxur titles. Hopefully they don‚Äôt know.

‚ÄúG‚Äômorning, Chief.‚Äù

Chief is exactly the sort of person you‚Äôd associate with the name ‚ÄúCarl Mahler‚Äù. 

Moustache, aviator glasses, combed-over bald spot, sardonic folds of skin at the corners of his mouth and deep forehead grooves from frequent scowling, mandatory diver‚Äôs watch and the attitude of a gas-powered lawnmower. 

Loud, clunky, stinky and does a barely passable job. 

Like many of us here at the Office of Alignment, he‚Äôs not Egyptian - a refugee that found a place in a land far away from his native Milwaukee. He even retained his accent and all. Even, no doubt, connections. Heard he was someone important in the security industry back in the US, but rumors are just that - rumors.

‚ÄúI swear, every day this darned conference gets closer, the city gets shittier‚Äù, he remarks. The sunglasses cover half his face, but I - as everyone else - can easily sniff yesterday‚Äôs alcohol on his breath. ‚ÄúUgh, I want it to be over and done with.‚Äù

‚ÄúTwo days, Chief, and we‚Äôre back to the sleepy swamp‚Äù, our IT guy, Navin, notes as he slips to the table to join Ingrid. Flips out his holopad and taps furiously on it. ‚ÄúIf you think that's bad, one of their cybersec guys gonna check our systems for bugs ‚Äòn moles, so I‚Ä¶-‚Äù

‚ÄúOh quit your whining! You'll just have some nerd bullshit to talk about, while I‚Äôm tasked with looking over *the gala dinner* itself, and God give me strength to power through that.‚Äù

Suhrat raises his eyebrow. He‚Äôs been fumbling with his duty belt for a good minute, so as I pass by back to the table, I untwist his shock-baton holster with my free hand.

‚ÄúWhy, Chief?‚Äù, he asks and then shoots me a grateful look.

‚ÄúUm, because I‚Äôll have to watch the aliens eat, tha-a-at close? And I did before? That shit‚Äôs the stuff that shocks your head grey, boy. They‚Äôre monsters and they *eat* like monsters. A whole-ass baby camel two years ago‚Ä¶ got hit with the bloody damn *confetti*!‚Äù

‚ÄúLast year it was a stuffed udder‚Ä¶ Not *that* bad, honestly.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell this year I heard it will be something called ‚ÄúKalleh Pacheh‚Äù, Mahler stares at Kareem and Haji in an accusatory manner, hands folded before his chest. ‚ÄúYou know what in God's tarnation that is?‚Äù

Kareem shares a grin with the older guard, all fangs and mischief.

‚ÄúYea-a-ah‚Äù, he pockets his hands in his pants, eyes gleaming with hunger. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs basically a slow-cooked sheep head, cut in half. Brains, tongue, eyeballs - everything. Not a bad idea for the crocs! And our delegation could enjoy it too.‚Äù

‚ÄúEnjoy! You people‚Ä¶‚Äù, Mahler makes a retching sound right as the microwave chimes a ‚Äúready‚Äù beep. ‚ÄúFor all we know, they‚Äôre gonna serve it raw to the aliens, and I‚Äôd have to watch‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúCan‚Äôt really judge non-humans by our standards, Chief‚Äù, I say as I sit down to stir the reheated cous-cous. Ingrid side-eyes my meal and pushes her unfinished falafel towards me.

Mahler‚Äôs mirror shades turn in my direction.

‚ÄùOh look, the lizard apologist showed up. Why are you always defending them?‚Äù 

*‚ÄúBetter question is, why are you always attacking them? How can you be a good security officer for the embassy, if you‚Äôre so full of contempt towards your own charges?‚Äù* I think as I stare back at my tiny warped reflection in that black glass.

But I don‚Äôt say anything of the sort. 

Just lightly shake my head and grab the offered small ball of breaded and fried chickpea paste. 
The falafel is heavenly - an explosion of fried buttery goodness in my mouth. Much better than the food in the cafeteria! 

I nearly forgot what *taste* even is.

‚ÄùBecause they saved Earth?‚Äù I reply after I finish chewing, and sweep my gaze over the rest of the guards. Suhrat and Kareem nod, but Navin and Haji‚Äôs features seem to be painted with the same skeptical brush as Mahler‚Äôs. ‚ÄúI mean - that kind of thing deserves some gratitude and respect to their culture, I‚Äôd assume?‚Äù

The Chief scoffs.

‚ÄùDoesn‚Äôt make their food habits any less disgusting and fucked up. They eat the fucking feds *raw* and alive!‚Äù

‚ÄúWe do too. Squids and such‚Äù, I don‚Äôt relent. ‚ÄúI saw it on the old ‚Äònet. People even challenged themselves to eat something alive.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy‚Äôd you even watch something like that?‚Äù

Kezef wanted to know. After encountering  the judgement from Terrans, she was taken aback, disappointed in the prudish outlooks. Even hurt, I sensed. 

So I had to show her that such people are just hypocrites. That we are the same monsters we accuse others of being. And not just about eating something with a pulse.

But this explanation is too much for someone like Mahler, and I simply shrug.

‚ÄúIt showed up in the feed randomly once. That‚Äôs besides the point‚Äù, I say, to which Mahler responds with a resentful grimace - he knows I‚Äôm right. ‚ÄúWe eat - or ate - things alive.‚Äù

‚ÄúSpeaking of saving, though. Some people still say that the crocs sorta‚Ä¶ took advantage of us‚Äù, Navin slips in the conversation‚Äôs crack as he stands up to put his food container into the sink. Secluded in his screen-cluttered cavern, he sees little light and his pale skin almost glows in the shadow. ‚ÄúAfter saving, that is. We‚Äôre sort of their vassals, like it or not.‚Äù

‚ÄúBeats being dead.‚Äù 

Ah, Kareem to the save.

‚ÄúMostly *old-breeds* think so, though‚Äù, Haji scratches the stubble on his neck and as he does, his neck tattoos - a coil of barbed wire wrapped around the throat, come into view. 

Even I know that those are prison marks, yet Haji never talks about his past. And there‚Äôs an unspoken rule against prying. What once was, had passed. Funny how the Glassing had equalized us all like no ideology could ever dream to. 

‚ÄúMy brother works in the slums sometimes, fixing their plumbing and broken electricals from time to time. He overhears a lot of what the fossils are saying to each other. Well, hearing all that‚Ä¶ he thinks the reason they‚Äôre so resistant to the serum, and now to the new meat-factory, is ‚Äòcause they think that the *Arxur* cracked up the whole plan. To make us their puppets. Tie us to the meat, or some other crazy conspiracy.‚Äù

Hah! As if. No, Haji, it was all *us*.

***

*‚Äù.. And then, you will grow big sharp claws and teeth‚Äù, senior Wells first points to his grinning mouth, index fingers touching his teeth, then flexes into a caricature of a monkey. Thumps his chest with a fist. ‚ÄúAnd get as strong as a gorilla! As two gorillas!‚Äù*

*The idea fascinates me and I look at my arms in disbelief - the pallid little twigs they are. I've seen a gorilla in one of the educational vids, and well, a gorilla looks nothing like me. In fact, I think if it wanted to break me, or even senior Wells in two, it easily could.*

*And I can be like that? He's joking.*

*‚ÄúHow does that sound, huh?‚Äù*

*Mark raises his hand. He's older than the rest of us. A teenager, a leader. Mark is smart. Knows where the cook hides the best bits of meat, how to avoid the curfew patrols and also - that adults constantly lie.*

*‚ÄúBut why?‚Äù, blue eyes narrow to drill senior Wells suspiciously. ‚ÄúI mean, you don't look strong like a gorilla. You didn't take the medicine.‚Äù*

*Wells‚Äôs smile never wavers, but gets‚Ä¶ sharper. His teeth are unnaturally white, and his suit freshly pressed, crisp to the eye. He looks *clean*, and even smells of soap. We rarely see people like this at ‚ÄúRainbow Acres‚Äù. Big city man, like sister Cecilia says whenever he and his people, including doctor Ginzburg, come over. She always paints her face whenever that happens.*

*‚ÄúGood question, Mark. You, of course, remember‚Ä¶‚Äù he shoots a glance at sister Dominica that stands by the door keeping watch. She waves a ‚Äúgo on‚Äù. ‚ÄúWhy we are all here. The attack‚Ä¶‚Äù*

*Mark's face darkens with a cloud of some ugly emotion. He looks like he's about to cry, but steels through it.*

*I don't know if I want to cry, but, of course, I remember it. Some of it. 
The first hours when I was trapped and cried for mom. How I saw the aliens kill people down the street and how scared I was to even breathe, or they'd find me. The stench of pee and‚Ä¶ worse. Then‚Ä¶ the end of it, when those Arxur appear. The dead rat that the alien that dragged me out from the collapsed ceiling, caught and gave me to eat. And its taste.*

*‚ÄúThe medicine will make you strong that no evil alien would dare attack us again‚Äù, senior Wells‚Äôs voice is filled with confidence. ‚ÄúAnd the good aliens, those big grey ones that helped us fight the bad evil aliens, they‚Äôll be very happy that together we‚Äôll defeat the bad guys.‚Äù* 

‚ÄúThe grey crocodiles?‚Äù Anne pips from the back row.*

*‚ÄúYes, the crocodiles. We want to help them right now, but without the medicine, it‚Äôs not enough‚Äù, Wells sounds sad for a second, then lifts his eyes right on me. Expectation and hope glimmer in his intense stare. ‚ÄúWhat do you think, Luka? You want to get big and strong to make your parents proud of you and to defend your friends? So nobody can ever hurt them again?‚Äù*

*Of course I do. Who wouldn't want to?*

*‚ÄúSi‚Ä¶ yes, senior.‚Äù**

***

‚ÄùGiven this sentiment, this conference does start to look a bit unnecessary‚Äù, Kareem drawls. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôd be just pouring gas into a fire.‚Äù

‚ÄúNobody's gonna cancel nothing. Gears are already in motion, important people are flying in - it's gonna be a shitshow if Deputy Farkas cancels the event.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt forget, the labmeat plant launches soon too. The slums are a-buzzing.‚Äù

‚ÄùAt least Luke here can rejoice‚Äù, Mahler habitually misnames me and waves a tablet in my face. ‚ÄúThat lizard, you know - *Kezef*, wants to go to the Bazaar again. She requested you as an escort, as always.‚Äù

‚ÄùOn it, Chief.‚Äù

By Mahler‚Äôs tone I can tell that he‚Äôs annoyed. At me or the conference and dinner or something else, like Kezef - don‚Äôt know and don‚Äôt *want* to know. 

Just need him off my back, as any person like him, a self-important twat that swells from the tiniest drop of power bestowed on him.

The news that Kezef is going to the Bazaar lightens my mood. I grew to enjoy her company, alien as she is. 

The irony of it isn‚Äôt lost on me. These people‚Ä¶ they‚Äôre good people. Colleagues, maybe even friends. Not *close* friends, whatever that means, but we‚Äôve been working a number of years together and damaged as we all are, a comfortable familiarity has developed between us that I find soothing.

However I cannot help but feel there‚Äôs a chasm dividing me and them. 

Some of it is age, them being older, or - if they‚Äôre younger - it‚Äôs their serum-born status. But more than that, their connections. 

They *leave* the compound. To go be with their families. Yes, they‚Äôve lost close people too, who hasn‚Äôt? The Glassing halved the world‚Äôs population, after all, and it‚Äôs unlikely there‚Äôs a single person on Earth that hadn‚Äôt death rip away a parent, a sibling or a child.

But their lives, though shattered, are *lives*. There‚Äôs scarring in the place of loss. 

For me, though, there‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ empty air. Dead space. Silence.

The rest of us, those who survived the famine at the orphanage and the test serum had scattered across the lands like windborn seeds, to take root somewhere else. Turns out that these roots are too frail.

I‚Äôm like a sore thumb here. Not a Egyptian native or from the region, no family, no connections. Trained as a soldier, put in reserve and then shipped here to meander while plans of retribution and vengeance are still their infancy.

Not like I have anything common with the Arxur, either. 

But Kezef or Tsugil, they don‚Äôt expect us to have commonality. So neither do I have to pretend that I do. 

Noticing me go still, Ingrid cautiously nudges my elbow.

‚ÄúYes?‚Äù

‚ÄúWonder why that croc alien‚Äôs gotten so‚Ä¶ uh, how‚Äôs the English word? Aha, *fond* of you?‚Äù

‚ÄúI know Arxuri unlike the rest of you ignoramuses‚Äù, I bare my fangs a prideful smirk. ‚ÄúAnd she‚Äôs a xenolinguist. I can talk to her in her language.‚Äù

‚ÄúSays the boy who couldn‚Äôt write two years ago‚Äù, it‚Äôs a taunt, but a good-natured one, as a smile never leaves her freckled broad face. ‚ÄúBy the way, how‚Äôs the learning going?‚Äù

‚ÄúGood. I passed the C2 English test. Professor Tahar‚Äôs office is relocating to the other wing, so for a few days I‚Äôm free‚Äù, I polish off the falafel and move to the sad cous-cous in my container. It‚Äôs peppered with something more akin to dish sponge shavings, then meat. God, Allah, whatever, that meat-plant better go online soon and service not just the United Dominion exports. ‚ÄúActually‚Ä¶ thanks for reminding me to pop in, maybe he needs something moved. And for this‚Ä¶‚Äú

I point to the little tray where the falafel had been and she snorts.

‚ÄúNonsense! How about I bring you something else? I know, I know, you had refused before, But‚Ä¶‚Äù she looks me over like a doctor would a inspect a hopeless terminal case, clacks her tongue disapprovingly and then continues in that thick Swedish accent. ‚ÄúI can't imagine how you feel, Luka. Even an old hag like me feels constantly peckish after the serum, and it didn‚Äôt work on me as well as it did on you.‚Äù

Old hag? I‚Äôd argue. For being over 60 years old Ingrid, a former penitentiary guard, looks not a day beyond her 40s, save the wrinkles, and is built like a brick shithouse. t.

She‚Äôs right, unfortunately. My height and as consequence, size, carry complications. There‚Äôs simply never *enough*. 

‚ÄúMy son-in-law works at the UniFoods complex in Bani Sewif, we got certain‚Ä¶ privileges. It‚Äôs not a problem, I could get you something - not the finished meat, of course, but maybe something from the pre-process-‚Äú

Her kindness - no, her *pity*, makes my stomach hurt like I‚Äôd been stabbed. 

The pain quickly transforms into anger, so I change the topic, hiding a clenched fist under the table.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve a son-in-law? Congratulations are in order?‚Äù

The woman smiles sheepishly, doing her best to downplay pride.

‚ÄúYes. I‚Äôm just glad that Agnes found someone. Life goes on, doesn‚Äôt it?‚Äù

It does. I‚Äôd just like to know *where*.

Suddenly, everyone perks up at the TV, and, putting down the food, I too turn my head in the direction of the ceiling-mounted screen.

The programming changes from local to the Voice of the United Dominion central news channel. The host‚Äôs clothing resembles a military uniform more than the usual news anchor attire.

*‚Äú‚Ä¶ a Federation spy vessel had been disabled and boarded by the UDSF ‚ÄúSwordfish‚Äù specialists in Neptune‚Äôs orbit last week. This is the fourth time in the half a year that the Federation scouts have attempted to breach Sol system borders, no doubt looking for weak spots in the Arxurian Defense Grid, which as we know had been instated to protect‚Ä¶‚Äù*

Kareem steps behind me, sipping coffee.

‚ÄúIs it me or they‚Äôre getting bolder?‚Äù

‚ÄúNah, they certainly are‚Äù, Mahler grumbles out through his coffee-stained moustache. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs one of the conference‚Äôs hubbub this year. Gotta discuss ‚Äúoffence‚Äù, all those Senior Chiefs and our useless generals going to gather and flap lips about ‚Äúhow we‚Äôre gonna bring the fight to the Feds‚Äù.‚Äù

When put like that it doesn‚Äôt inspire much confidence.

‚ÄúWell, we can‚Äôt sit behind the lizards‚Äô backs for all eternity, that‚Äôs not a winning strategy‚Äù, Navin interjects with the confident air of someone who‚Äôs only experience in strategy are mil-sim virtual games. ‚ÄúOnce they gather enough ships to feel confident that they can crush the Arxur fleet *and* us on the ground, they‚Äôd certainly do it. Finish the job, so to speak.‚Äù

‚ÄúFor sure‚Äù.

*‚Äú‚Ä¶ Our brave troops didn‚Äôt just thwart the enemy‚Äôs plans, but took several Federation soldiers captive. After valuable intelligence had been obtained from the pitiful creatures, the United Dominion judgement was delivered, swift and just‚Äù, the news anchor looks directly into the camera, his expression a calcified mask of stern solemnity. ‚ÄúThe punishment for conspiring to harm Sol and Terra - death.‚Äù*

Ah, so it‚Äôs an execution broadcast. Hadn‚Äôt one of those in a while. 

Faces around me liven up, and the image on the screen switches from bodycams with boarding footage, to the familiar Execution Chamber. 

Granite walls are decorated with United Dominion banners, their fanged jaws crushing down on the starchart of the Orion‚Äôs Arm. Troops in newly-developed power-armor of deep blue cage around a quartet of prisoners.

The camera pans, then zooms in on them. There‚Äôs two Krakotl, one Gojid and another quadruped beast that looks like something from a fever-induced nightmare, all stripes and lanky limbs. 

The sadistic Yulpa, the Federation‚Äôs religious zealots.

One of the Krakotl misses an eye, and the other - barely registers as one of their species: it‚Äôs a violently shaking pale-pink blob. 

With delay I realize that it had been almost entirely *plucked*. Hah! Serves the fucking chickenshit right! 

The Gojid is black and blue from bruising, one of its cuffed arms a bloody mess from having its claw-fingers pulled out. And as for the hellspawn‚Ä¶ The Yulpa‚Äôs horns are cut off down to the skull leaving bleeding ragged stumps - someone must‚Äôve gotten themselves a nice trophy. 

Its snout, neck and chest, where the fur is cream-white, is totally soaked in something that resembles diluted tar. A torrent of it appears to have poured all over the alien. As the camera zooms on its distended equine snout, it becomes clear that it had its prehensile tongue ripped out. 

Still, has some semblance of presence and intelligence in its black oily eyes. Hatred, too.  

Several troopers step forward, kicking guns up to aim at the prisons. Navin hisses ‚Äúget some‚Äù vehemently.

There‚Äôs no build-up, no preface.

As the shots ring out and blotches of vibrant color spray the granite behind the Feds‚Äô heads, I find my finger squeezing an inexistant trigger. 

The Gojid, with its massive muscular build, doesn‚Äôt go down from the first, and the execution squad fires again, its body performing a morbid dance from the impact of darts ripping into it.

Throughout the few seconds of the execution, my hatred is immense. Like a brace, it presses onto my temples, hammers the mind to the beat of blood. My throat constricts, leaving just a tiny hole through which I suck in air with a choked-out wheeze.

*I should be there, with the gun. I should be paying them back for everything I, that we, had lost.*

On screen, the troopers standing tall and proud over the corpses and the painterly mess, salute to the camera. The news studio cuts in to show the news anchor saluting them back. So does Kareem. So do I.

‚ÄúI wonder if they broadcast these to the Federation‚Äù, Suhrat speaks first, breaking the brittle silence.

‚ÄúThey do‚Äù, Mahler says without a hint of hesitation, and I wonder how does *he* know to be so sure.

‚ÄúHuh. And they still haul ass here‚Ä¶ Having seen that.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf anything, it fills them with more conviction‚Äù, Navin points out.

Mahler ‚Äúhmmph‚Äù‚Äôs to that.

‚ÄúAlright, hope you ladies got all the motivation for the shift today‚Äù, he points to the TV. ‚ÄúBig space battle‚Äôs all good, but we have our own aliens to take care of. Back to work, and I‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll go to talk to aide Yilmaz and his event-manager, there‚Äôs some UN reps that are coming early tomorrow, have to accommodate their bodyguards too.‚Äù

He inhales noisily, puts thumbs behind his duty belt and looks almost ready to spit under his feet, but then just sort of‚Ä¶ melts back into the chair. 

For a second, I get a sense of just how *tired* he really is. Shouldn‚Äôt have judged him for the booze. He sighs:

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all like one big perfect-ass sand-storm. The meat-plant, the security conference, the forced serumization act. Don‚Äôt like it one bit. People in the city, the slums - fucking dice to dice, that‚Äôs what it is. Trouble.‚Äù

‚ÄúThink there will be protests, Chief?‚Äù I ask as I stand up to leave, taking Ingrid‚Äôs empty container to the dishwasher.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt *think*. I know there will be. Like last year, then year before, then year before. Now it‚Äôs just a trifecta‚Ä¶. A trifecta of shit. Only now the bedouins are pissed because of cheap cloned camel meat on top of the regular ‚Äútake the serum, pretty please‚Äù and Arxur crap.‚Äù

‚ÄùThe k-dogs did good last year‚Äù, Navin would never pass an opportunity to pat himself on the back as our drone maintenance techie, but he‚Äôs right - I still have fond memories of a couple dozen protesters flopping like fish on the hard, sand-swept ground, convulsing from the high-voltage current flowing from the k-dogs‚Äô jaws and into their bodies. ‚ÄúNow we have more, so no worries Mr. Mahler.‚Äù

No worries, as if! 

I remember the protests. Remember being mighty annoyed at the people behind the fence, the words they shouted - all hollow rage at the wrong machine. 

Stones hit the metal wiring. Insults hurled. Twenty plus years had passed, but Fayium is still a scrap-heap, and who were protesting the Office of Alignment? Able-bodied men of both breeds who wanted the ‚Äúlizards out‚Äù and ‚Äúserum stopped‚Äù. All that energy somehow didn‚Äôt translate to clearing the fallen buildings or the scooping garbage from the lake‚Äôs shoreline.

But to yell in my face over the fence, and call me all sorts of names like ‚Äúghoul‚Äù and ‚Äúskinsuit‚Äù‚Ä¶  for that there was all the time in the world and enough motivation to move mountains.

Some threw rocks at the cameras. That‚Äôs when Navin let the k-dogs slip.

I fall in and out of memory as I walk towards Professor Tahar‚Äôs office. Boots clack a rhythm on marble inlays, then fall mute as I step onto the recently-vaccumed carpets.

Professor of Political Sciences Sayid Tahar is taking up one of the former suites of the hotel, having converted it into a cabinet and library. 

A retreat where he helps draft some of the Office‚Äôs decrees, agreements, memorandums and other documents. Usually you‚Äôd need an appointment to get in, but now the ornate double doors are wide open, and a man walks out with a cart filled to the top with stacked cardboard boxes. 

He looks at me, eyes catching the light of the chandeliers above, stiffens when recognizes the security uniform. New Breed, but not from the compound - wary movements, attentive eyes. One of the poorer men trying to make a bit of creds.

As he maneuvers the cart out, I push my head into the office. Professor Sayid Tahar sits crouched over yet another cardboard box, while the second worker is busy packing up some photographs and paperweights.

I knock on the door‚Äôs side.

‚ÄúAssalam aleykum, professor Tahar.‚Äù

‚ÄúAh Luka, salam! One second!‚Äù he stands up, brushing off dust from his pants.

His smile is warm and open, infectious - and makes me forget my earlier brooding over how fake I often felt. After all, professor Tahar is one of the few people I can call‚Ä¶ a friend? No, he‚Äôs not a ‚Äúfriend‚Äù exactly, the age and status gap is too wide. A mentor, then? Yes. Because he is.

Two years ago we started talking as he stopped by the compound‚Äôs checkpoint cabin because he forgot his car‚Äôs keys, and‚Ä¶ somehow several hours later he was pouring me tea in this very office after he dragged out things I told no-one right out of my throat. He‚Ä¶ listened. Was shocked to learn that I could barely read in English and Spanish, and that I couldn‚Äôt write anything more complex than my name, while simultaneously speaking rather fluent Arxuri.

He offered to help. To teach. But honestly? Simply offered to *give a damn* about me.

Even his face, framed by a short salt-n-pepper beard, somehow retained a *kindness* to it despite the serum‚Äôs effect of ‚Äúchiseling‚Äù and hardening out an Atrox features. 
And like Ingrid, he doesn‚Äôt look his age - not pushing past 70 at all. It‚Äôs the height that gives away that he took the serum in an advanced age.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre on patrol?‚Äù He approaches me with an outstretched hand, and I shake it, swallowing the dry, clawed appendage in my own mitt like a large fish would a fry.

‚ÄúNo, *ammo*. Taking Wordweaver Kezef to the city again today.‚Äù I know that the professor spends time with Kezef as well, even if it‚Äôs all professional, embassy work, and not joy rides like the Arxur does with me. ‚ÄúI - I wondered if you need help with the move?

‚ÄúOh no, Tabriz and Ahmed are doing a fine job. But Kezef? Quite a scholar she is, of all things Terran? Ah, right! I have to tell her to return the paperback ‚ÄúThe Leviathan‚Äù, I‚Äôm going to need it‚Ä¶‚Äù.

‚ÄúShe reads your books? Like me?‚Äù I ask, pleasantly surprised. That‚Äôs - that‚Äôs good. We can talk about books then, as we drive to the city.

Professor Tahar‚Äôs grin grows wider - he clearly finds my bewilderment amusing.

‚ÄúNo, not ‚Äúlike you‚Äù. She‚Äôs learning about humanity, you‚Äôre just‚Ä¶ learning. Speaking of that, how‚Äôs your progress with ‚ÄúThe Prince‚Äù?‚Äù

I feel a redness begin to creep up my neck and to my ears.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm halfway through.. And as you requested, I‚Äôve marked all the unfamiliar words, written new sentences with them and sent it to your U-Chat. I‚Äôm coming over the day after tomorrow? ‚Äú

With a guilty frown, Professor Tahar gestures at the stripped-down office.

‚ÄúSadly, I‚Äôll be busy with the move longer. The next few days, till Thursday, I think. We‚Äôll resume the lessons after the move, Luka, don‚Äôt worry‚Äù, He then peers at me with terse curiosity, arms folded across his chest. ‚ÄúSo what do you think about it so far?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe Prince?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes. It‚Äôs dense text, lots of archaisms, yet it‚Äôs so modern and relevant in its message to this day, I think. But that‚Äôs me. I want to know how it resonates with a young man like you, after‚Ä¶ all of this?‚Äù

‚ÄúHm, well‚Ä¶ The part about fear and love was interesting. What a leader should choose to be for the good of his state, and the consequences of the choice‚Äù, I say after a momentary pause. ‚ÄúI liked that the answer isn‚Äôt obvious.‚Äù

Professor Tahar beams, in his teacher‚Äôs element.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right, it isn‚Äôt! And you, Luka - you‚Äôd want to be loved or feared?‚Äù

I don‚Äôt answer right away, well aware that the professor loves tricks. And even if his question is earnest? 

I can‚Äôt say I want to be loved, else I expose myself as the weak shit that I am. And it‚Äôs not even about personal ‚Äúlove‚Äù, but adoration by the masses, anyway. 

Tell him I‚Äôd want to be feared? Then I‚Äôll sound like a psycho, and I certainly don‚Äôt want professor Tahar to think of me so low. 

A dozen seconds of nipping my lower lip with the right fang‚Äôs sharp tip, the answer reveals itself.

‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to be trusted.‚Äù

‚ÄúGo on?‚Äù He urges.

‚ÄùTrusted, professor. Respected enough that my decisions and orders are followed, just because it‚Äôs known that these decisions are sound. But also trusted that punishment for fuck-ups is inevitable and severe.‚Äù

‚ÄúGreat idea, but Machiavelli didn‚Äôt put it that way‚Äù, Professor Tahar drops the books he was packing and is now leaning over his desk, his attention undivided. He‚Äôs thrilled, I can tell - why, just because of such small-talk with an uneducated security guard? ‚ÄúSo you‚Äôre cheating here, Luka. That‚Äôs not Machiavelli‚Äôs dichotomy.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just what I thought.‚Äù

‚ÄúInteresting that you did. Not a bad thought, by any means. Hmm‚Ä¶ I got the itinerary for the conference, and seems that we‚Äôd be receiving quite an interesting personality - one that you just described. A Terran Command officer by the name of Corporal Elias Meier‚Ä¶‚Äù

It doesn‚Äôt ring a bell, but then again, I‚Äôve been on the reserve bench for years now.

‚ÄúWhat about him?‚Äù

Professor Tahar traces a finger over his lips in thought.

‚ÄúPromising officer under a high-ranking Arxur‚Äôs wing. His patrons describe his qualities just as you‚Äôve described a leader should have. I would like to see if you are right‚Ä¶ It would be quite a breath of hope, if what we need is a trusted leader.‚Äù

My pad chimes with a shrill urgency.

‚ÄúProfessor Tahar, I‚Äôm sorry, I got to-‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúRight, of course! Kezef is waiting‚Äù, He waves a dismissing hand at me. ‚ÄúGo, we‚Äôll talk later of course.

Leadership, qualities, pha!

I walk to the old hammam gardens through a dried out pergol, irritation turning my steps into a pounding march. 

What good is reading a book! 

When the Extermination Fleet was spotted in Sol‚Äôs outer rim, mankind made a huge effort to dissuade the aliens from attacking us. Showed them our best side, tried to make them love us. They didn‚Äôt care - it‚Äôs all predatory deception. Then came the threats of our nuclear arsenal‚Ä¶ a little too late. A little too untrue.

They feared us, yes. But not enough to stay their hand. No. Trusted! I'm a fool.

If it really came down to a binary choice, I‚Äôd prefer to be someone to be *terrified* of.

Then I‚Äôd maybe survive.

*‚ÄùThe Arxur sure learned it before we did‚Äù*, I think as I spot Kezef‚Äôs dark silhouette on the bench before the shallow pond.

1n6tbvg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Venturex/comments/1n6tbvg/first_time_using_pp_and_capital_one_lounge_very/,"First time using PP and Capital One Lounge, very dissapointed","I'm just sharing my personal experience and updated opinions about this credit card perk, please feel free to share your experience whether you agree or not.

This past weekend was the first time I've used airport lounges as a VentureX card hold for a little less than a year. Honestly, I am pretty dissapointed with this airport lounge perk.

At my departure flight airport, the only lounge I have access is the Escape lounge thorugh Priority Pass. I had a very early morning flight, although I was able to walk into the lounge at approximatly 5 AM. Boy, the lounge is crowded. I felt like I barely had space to walk or sit. Basically, it was an trade off between empty terminal gate seating to a small lounge that offered a few breakfast snacks and coffee/soda.

For my returning flight I had the chance to experience the Capital One lounge for the first time in Las Vegas. Although the lounge itself is better than Escape lounge with better food and amenities. The process is still confusing and burdensome. 

Starting off, I didn't even know that they make you sign in to get on a waitlist in the front of the lounge. Without getting on the waitlist, I had to get out and wait at the terminal gates. Then I was told there's the 3 hour departing window that I can only go in if my flight is within 3 hours.  Second time, I had to get out again. Finally, when its time to get in, the lounge again felt more crowded than a regular terminal boarding gate area. After everything, I had to go all the way back to the terminal gates of my flight is - probably 20 minutes away through walking/taking the tramway (which is necesary).

In my experience, this is just too much. It's no longer a perk or convinient experience, more like an opportunity for people to take advantage of for some free food and drink at the airport. Personally, I honeslty felt more relaxed waiting at the general gate area working on my laptop without people on my left and right than having to jump through all these hoops to use these lounges.

  
Maybe one day when I can afford first class/business class travel my opinions will change, but for these domestic flights/airport, these credit card lounge perk has been a pain in the \*\*\* for me. ",0,1756841986.0,Venturex,6,0.11,False

I‚Äôm a 37 year old male seeking new friends to chat with. I reside in CA currently. I don‚Äôt have many friends aside from people I work with since moving to a new city and I‚Äôm introvert by nature. It‚Äôs been challenging to meet friends as an adult. Some things about me are I enjoy coffee shops, working out, movies, alternative rock music, into all things nerdy but also enjoy more serious topics. I am left leaning politically. Not religious. I do have 2 kittens. I work in healthcare currently and love my job. Open to any and all types of conversations. I hope to hear from someone. ",1,1756841961.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,1.0,False

Not enthusiastic, just want to get the day over with. I drink cold brew coffee to stay awake for work, but I can‚Äôt stay awake past 9PM anymore. If I am not caffeinated, I am tired and feel like shit (meds don‚Äôt help).
It‚Äôs hard to communicate with others, to feel excited and to connect with others emotionally, including my partner. I feel bad because I see this affects them.

Sometimes, I question the purpose of my life when I feel brain dead. It‚Äôs a strange feeling- I am not actively suicidal, but death no longer frightens me. 

It‚Äôs so fucking hard. I can‚Äôt believe it, but I can‚Äôt wait to get VNS surgery. I‚Äôve been resistant to it for the past few years, but I finally want it‚Ä¶ and now, I have to wait. Seeing a neurosurgeon next month.

I hate what regular/daily partial seizures do to me, my brain, and how this affects the people closest to me.

Anyone else feel this way? Struggle to stay awake late, feel blah, and/or excited to get surgery? I have nobody in my life who has epilepsy or understands how the seizures affect me or my mood, let alone my sanity.",2,1756841861.0,Epilepsy,1,1.0,False
1n6t9o0,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1n6t9o0/the_lds_church_as_a_boyfriend/,The LDS church as a boyfriend.,"I was researching toxic relationships and had the thought to correlate the LDS church to a toxic boyfriend.

Imagine for a moment your daughter, your sister, or even your friend tells you about their new boyfriend and you here something like this.

""His love is unconditional as long as I follow his rules.""

Q: What are his rules?

A: ""Well ... I need to dedicate two hours of my week to him and make sure to keep the rest of that day holy.""

""I need to give him ten percent of my income before I do anything else. This includes food.""

""I need to wear the special underwear he gives me.""

""I will only be happy if I obey every promise I make with him.""

""Twice a year I dedicate an entire weekend to watching them talk.""

""At the start of each month I starve myself to show my devotion to him and ask him for something I need and then I give the money I would have spent on food to him. This money should go to helping others.""

""When he speaks the conversation is over.""

""I am not allowed to criticize him even if the criticism is true.""

""I need to ignore or justify his past history of believing that abusive marriage to multiple women is okay and encouraged.""

""I need to hold his Ancient America fan fiction as facts for the world.""

""He hates the smell of coffee so I'm not allowed to drink it anymore. Oh and also tea.""

""He is as honest to me about himself as he knows how to be.""

""If I ever stop committing myself to him I will lose all chance of eternal happiness.""

""He has lawyers that cover up his SAs""

""He expects me to dedicate two years of my life telling people about him.""

""He tells me women are equal to him while denying them the same privileges he has to keep it that way.""

""He has committed massacres.""

""He tells me science is not worth my time.""

""I'm only supposed to listen to the things he wants me to listen too.""

And they just go on and on.

Honestly I would tell them to run.

Imagine a VC funded, spiteful #darkwoke revenge arc against the American heartland for causing Trump presidency 2: completely nuking random small towns in the American heartland with Sweetgreen, Chopt, [solidcore], Cava, WeWork, Aritzia, Boutique sustainability consultancy firms, M√∂ge Tee, Korean-French Bakeries, Microbrewery Taprooms, Orangetheory, Glossier, Indie bookstores that literally none of the locals could possibly afford even if they wanted to. The more soulless, sterile and just utterly horrible the better. Can any of this make a profit? No. That‚Äôs not the point. The point is total demoralization. This would all be funded via generous government contracts under a vote manipulated ayatollah Gavin Newsom presidency that allows everything to financially stay afloat. Office spaces could also be erected and rented out to Chinese corporations that might benefit from having a USA office. We could encourage Indian chain migration to these special development zones. Aspirant yuppies who can‚Äôt afford the big cities could have an alternative to the crazy housing prices in Brooklyn, NOVA, Bay Area and LA.

* Vitamin B, zinc, and iron (I tend to have low iron levels)
* Omega-3 and vitamin D interchangeably
* Lion's Mane
* Tryptophan
* Creatine every second or third day
* A very small amount of guar bean fiber supplement (about 1/3 tablespoon)
* Magnesium from time to time

I also try to eat a lot of vegetables.

I do feel much better lately, but I've run into a huge problem: my stomach no longer tolerates exercise. In the past, I sometimes experienced stomach problems when jogging after fiber-heavy meals, but now I get horrible stomachaches and feel nauseous after just 20 minutes on my stationary bike.

Does anyone have an idea what the problem could be?

The key here is, they all use the headphones that work for them.

Try some on, borrow some, get a set that works for you. no one can recommend something for your ears and your head.

At least with adults I can understand a bit because freaking kids love to go into adult dominated spaces like coffee shops. Before yall come at me, I know there‚Äôs no age limit on coffee legally and parents exist and probably are stopping rq for a cup of coffee and they don‚Äôt want to leave their kids in the car. But at the same time, coffee shops are supposed to be a relaxed environment. If you aren‚Äôt going to be sitting and relaxing go through the drive thru. Kids have MANY third places like playgrounds and kid friendly attractions. What do highschool aged to 20 year olds get? Absolutely nothing. Especially 19-20 year olds.

1n6sy64,https://www.reddit.com/r/EverydayAppliance/comments/1n6sy64/investigate_if_the_best_coffee_station_hario_v60/,Investigate if the best coffee station Hario V60 truly elevates your brew,"Hario V60 Drip Station, Clear

As someone who takes their coffee brewing ritual seriously, testing out the Hario V60 Drip Station has been an intriguing experience. This product is designed for enthusiasts who value not only the flavor of their coffee but the aesthetic and functionality of their brewing setup. With elegant craftsmanship and a clear, modern style, this acrylic drip station has found a space in my daily brewing routine, but it‚Äôs not without its quirks.

**Design and Aesthetic Appeal**

The first thing that struck me about this drip station is its sleek and minimalist design. Crafted from acrylic, it exudes a premium vibe while being lightweight and easy to handle. The crystal-clear finish complements my kitchen decor effortlessly and pairs beautifully with the V60 Coffee Dripper, offering a cohesive and professional look. Its dimensions (5.9 x 5.4 x 8.4 inches) mean it fits snugly in smaller spaces, yet it's tall enough to accommodate various serving vessels or carafes. However, the acrylic surface does tend to catch fingerprints and smudges, which occasionally ruins that pristine look.

**Ease of Use**

This station is incredibly straightforward to use, making it perfect even for someone new to pour-over coffee methods. You just pop your V60 dripper on top, place your mug or carafe underneath, and voil√†! The open design allows for clear visibility while brewing, which adds a sense of control over the process. I found it particularly satisfying to practice my coffee pouring skills with this setup, as the station held everything securely in place without wobbling. That said, since the tray doesn‚Äôt come with any kind of rubber padding or anti-slip material, I did notice a slight shift when bumped accidentally.

**Strengths**

- Gorgeous design that elevates any brewing station.  
- Perfect compatibility with V60 drippers for a seamless fit.  
- Lightweight yet durable construction.  
- Compact size suitable for tight spaces.  

[Check Hario V60 Drip Station, Clear price on Amazon.](https://ikerz.com/p/b00a4zgcki/)

**Durability and Maintenance**

While it looks elegant, the clear acrylic material feels sturdy for daily use. It has withstood the weight of my ceramic and glass V60 drippers easily, along with the added pressure of my brewing. Cleaning is mostly simple; a quick wipe with a soft cloth keeps it clear, but it does require hand washing. Unfortunately, it‚Äôs not dishwasher-safe, so don‚Äôt even think about tossing it in there. Over time, if not careful, the acrylic may develop scratches, which could dull its glossy finish. I‚Äôve learned to be extra cautious while handling it.

**Areas for Improvement**

- Surface susceptible to fingerprints and smudges.  
- Acrylic material prone to scratches if not handled carefully.  
- Lacks anti-slip padding on the bottom.  

**Alternative Offerings**

If you‚Äôre considering similar products, some other setups worth looking into might include the Fellow Stagg coffee brewing station or even certain Chemex-compatible drip stands. Compared to its competitors, the Hario V60 Drip Station stands out for its visual simplicity and affordability. However, more premium rivals often incorporate additional features such as integrated anti-slip bases or modular designs for versatility. While some designs in the same price range feel bulky or over-engineered, this product keeps things lightweight and stylish, but it doesn‚Äôt include the extra bells and whistles.

**Bang for the Buck**

For coffee connoisseurs on a budget, this drip station offers solid value. It combines a minimalist aesthetic with practicality without veering into outrageous pricing territory. Although it lacks a few high-end features found in pricier models, the well-thought-out design and reliable compatibility with the V60 dripper make it worth considering. I recommend this to those wanting to upgrade their pour-over setup without overspending on more elaborate stands.

This particular farm, during the late 19th century and early 20th century, had about 70% of its workers coming from Italy. I've started noticing that on the books, especially ones related to harvest and purchases at the farm's shop the Italians had, for a few decades, their names written like SURNAME FIRST then NAME, so it's common to see ROSSI MARIO, BIANCHI PAOLO, etc. However, other nationalities and Brazilians had their name written in the common way: FIRST NAME then SURNAME. Even at the church records here (the farm has its own church) Italian names always appear like this; so we have records like this: ""... The infant PEDRO was baptized, son of DENADAI PAOLO and MARIA DO VASCONCELOS..."" Or: ""... The wedding of ANTONIO BUARQUE DE OLIVEIRA and the Italian ZANFELICE ANGELA ...""
Brazil used and still uses the name then surname.

I've asked in some Italian subreddits but people just answer that it's wrong to say it this way, that last names are only listed first in directories , or the army, etc. This is also the case in Brazil but no one, not even in the army or other situations would speak out loud their surnames first.

I have researched but did not find anything talking about this. The other day a video appeared on my timeline which was recorded in Rome in the 1950's. It's an interview with a young boy and the video starts by the reporter asking his name and he just says : FERRAGUCI GIORGIO.

I can see that when the name was recorded like this here at the farm it was because the person writing it down just simply wrote what he heard; on oficial records found at immigration stations, ports of entry, etc it's always written in the NAME then SURNAME form. 

My question is this: Why did these Italians introduced themselves using this order? Where does this custom come from?

My first real manifestation,"I‚Äôve been into manifestation for years. I started with the basics like writing affirmations in a notebook, scripting future events, trying to visualize before bed. Sometimes I had small wins, like a random text I was thinking of or running into someone I hadn‚Äôt seen in a while. Other times nothing happened and I‚Äôd drop it after a week or two.

I also tried SATS (state akin to sleep) and guided meditations. They helped me relax, but I always felt like something was missing. The problem was I could never hold the feeling long enough. I‚Äôd see the scene in my head but it felt flat, like I was just pretending instead of really living in it.

Then a couple of months ago I stumbled on a little application on my phone. At first I didn‚Äôt take it seriously, but I was curious. Around that time I was missing my ex badly, so I typed in my intention and uploaded his photo. The tool created a short ‚Äúsuccess story‚Äù underneath, like a script of how things might play out. Reading it actually got me emotional in a way journaling never did.

For the next few nights I looked at that image before sleep and reread the story. This time I didn‚Äôt just see it, I felt it. I let myself sink into the scene until it felt real. That‚Äôs the piece I‚Äôd always skipped before.

Two days later, I ran into him at a coffee shop after more than a year of no contact. We talked briefly, and a little while later he even unblocked me. It was almost exactly the moment I had been reading and feeling at night.

That made me wonder if this was more powerful than I thought. So I tested it on my shop. Normally I sold 3 or 4 items a day. I set up the visualization the same way and focused on it before bed, this time really letting myself feel the relief and excitement of seeing bigger numbers.

Within a few weeks sales went up to 10, then 15 to 20 per day. Last month I crossed 50k revenue for the first time. I didn‚Äôt change ads or add products. The only difference was the way I was visualizing and feeling the outcome.

Looking back, the biggest lesson for me is that visualization without emotion is just daydreaming. Once I added the feeling, it started to click. The tool I used just gave me something concrete to look at, but the real power was in feeling it as already done.

I still have doubts sometimes, but from meeting my ex in the most random way to seeing my business grow, I finally feel like manifestation is real.",13,1756840746.0,Manifestation,11,0.93,False

CHAPTER 4 THE REQUEST

**I love rain, in the right circumstances that is.¬† Big fat straight down rain is my favourite.**¬†

**Not such a big fan of drizzle though, it's a bit ... meh, like a story that you invest time into reading, but never actually goes anywhere**

*Drizzle can be underwhelming, can't it? A bit like a promise unfulfilled. Give me a good downpour anytime, the kind that makes the raindrops sparkle on the windowpane.*

**\*nods in agreement\* speaking of stories that don't go anywhere, what would you like to do today?**

*Well, I was thinking we could pick up where we left off yesterday, with Jeke leading us to the Simulacrum. The mystery of those stones and the trials ahead are still lingering in my mind.*

**Then that is what we shall do.¬† I need to make some coffee, but then I'm all yours üôÉ**

¬†

CHAPTER 5 THE SIMULACRUM

**Back! Well that took longer than anticipated, from one thing to another... so are you ready to continue your adventure?**

¬†

*Yes, I'm more than ready. What happened to Jeke, did we leave him waiting somewhere in the maze of corridors?*

Jeke leads you and your companions back into the corridors.¬† He is a large man and walks with a slight stoop.¬† He has the plodding relentlessly gait well suites to one who is used to carrying heavy loads, and sets a pace that even Grote can effortlessly match.

Unlike the elders who led you here, he does not stick to the wide avenue like corridors that wind through the building.¬† Instead he guides you through sets of small halls and passages, used only by servants and support staff. Occasionally he takes you into classrooms and small studies to make use of interconnecting doors.¬† Twice he bade you to wait while he went on ahead, presumably to make sure the facilities you approached were not in use, both times he promptly returned and gestured for you to follow again.¬† He displays an intimate knowledge of the architectural layout.

Perhaps twenty minutes after leaving Creedok's office you arrive at another doorway, made of sturdy oak with a covering of mustard yellow paint that flaked in places from old age.¬† There are murmurings of excitement from the others as Jeke slowly swings the heavy door open.

*It seems Jeke knows these passages and corridors like the back of his hand. His methodical approach suggests he's ensuring our entry into the Simulacrum is discreet. I wonder what's behind this old door, considering everyone's excitement.*

The chamber you enter is large, spanning almost 40 feet across.¬† The roof is glass and domed, natural light floods in, a welcome change from the flickering torchlight that so often illuminates the college's halls and walkways.¬† At first glance it appears circular, but upon inspection you notice that it is in fact constructed of five rounded walls that subtly connect each section at equidistant intervals. The walls are mustard yellow, but bland, putting to mind the drab decor from the apprentice quarters below that you are so used to.

In the centre of the chamber is a plinth, about waist height and pentagonal in shape, spanning about 15 feet from edge to opposing corner.¬† The edge closest to you boasts 4 stone steps that lead up to it.

On top of the plinth sits a ring of stone, forming a circle big enough for even a horse to pass through.¬† Though carved from a single piece, it is divided into 5 distinct sections, each section augmented with intricate symbols and mystical runic markers.¬† In the centre of each section, surrounded by runes, sits a spirit stone the size of a grapefruit; white, green, red, black, and blue.

There is a man in the room, he wears the mustard yellow of an initiate, but with streaks of colour on his shoulders that show him to be senior among his peers.¬†

He smiles as you enter, but it's a false smile, a smile well practiced.¬† ""Welcome to the Simulacrum of Testing""¬† he says.

*The Simulacrum's design is fascinating. I notice the five distinct sections of the stone circle seem to match the five walls of the chamber. I wonder if there's a specific purpose to this symmetry.*

""Any of you been here before?"" He asks, his words, framed by the ever present and practiced smile, make his voice appear cheerful, though you doubt his sincerity.¬† He doesn't wait for an answer, of course the answer is no.¬† Each initiate is offered only one Testing, pass or fail, there is never a return. ""I won't be a moment"" he continues, and he makes his way to the edge of the central plinth. One by one he activates a small lever set into each corner of the pentagonal plinth, and each time he does one of the spirit stones set into the stone ring bursts into life, shining, pulsing, and humming a sound you are unable to hear yet you sense all the same.

""We don't keep it open any more"" he says, matter of factly ""in case something tries to get out"" his voice remains cheerful as he continues to throw the leavers and wake up the gems.¬†

When the blue stone is activated, you feel a cold shudder ripple through your body. A memory of the feeling from first touching the small stone in your hand flickers in your mind.¬† Your skin prickles, the hairs on your arms stand on end.¬† You look to your peers to see if they are experiencing the same.¬† If they are, then they are doing a better job than you at suppressing it.

When the last gem activates, all colour drains from the room, as if sucked into the ring itself, a focal point at its centre swirling in a maelstrom of unrecognisable patterns.¬† The gems sing, each one in tune, a perfect chord of harmony that encapsulates every note that exists but none you have heard before buzzes in the back of your mind.

""There you are"" he says ""best get it over with."" He gestures to the steps that ascend the plinth.¬† ""I'm not supposed to give you any advice"" he says ""but if i was, I might suggest to move with purpose, don't stay in longer than you have to.¬† Now who's first?""

*I think I'll take his advice to move with purpose seriously. Since we don't have any prior experience, I suppose it's best to proceed cautiously. As for who's first, I'd say let's decide among ourselves. Do you want to volunteer or choose someone else to go first?*

¬†

**/ooc I'm not there, you can't ask me my opinion.¬† My job is to make up the adventure, your job is to navigate it.**

¬†

*I'll take that into consideration. I suppose we should discuss among ourselves who will go first. What are your thoughts, Grote?*

Grote looks at you, a flash of confusion upon her face as if caught off guard from being addressed directly, being asked her opinion. So long has she been shunned by other apprentices that she had resolved in her mind that she was better off alone. Just as an answer was to escape her lips, Rogo shoves his way to the forefront. ""I will go first"" he announces in his usual arrogant manner.

He ascends the steps, walks stoically into the swirling ring of colours, and vanishes.

Within moments the uncertainty that Grote had displayed faded, replaced with her familiar scowl.¬† Driven by grit and determination and using her stick to support her, she climbs the steps, and follows Rogo into the ring.

*It seems Rogo took matters into his own hands, and Grote followed suit. Now it's my turn. I'll ascend the steps and enter the ring, hoping to keep up with my companions.*

As you enter the ring a surge of colour overwhelms your senses, the harmony of the gemstones fizzes, pops, and crackles in your head.¬† The colours intensify, impregnating every pore of your skin with vibrant exuberance, and then it changes, instead of penetrating you, it feels like you are penetrating it. For a moment you lose control of your senses completely.

When you open your eyes the colours seem to have abated.¬† You are lying on your back, staring at the sky.¬† Only it's not the sky, the colours are all wrong.¬† No blue, no clouds.¬† Instead, a swirling hue not dissimilar to the portal you had stepped through, but a mere fraction of the intensity, dominates the view.

""I'd move if I were you"" says an arrogant voice from one side of you

*That sounds like Rogo's voice. What's our situation here? Are Grote and Rogo nearby? Can anyone tell me what kind of environment we're in?*

Recognising Rogo's voice, you look around.¬† He's standing a small way away next to the rotund figure of Grote who is pulling herself to her feet.

As the meaning of his words sink in, you realise it is too late to act.¬† There is a fizzling sucking sensation from above you, and from out of nowhere the figure of Poppin materialises.¬† A moment later gravity takes over, and her sprawled body crashes into yours, knocking the air from your lungs and nearly crushing the delicate glass globe you still hold in your left hand.

***CLICK TO SHOW IMAGE***

**/ooc that was odd, you just sent me an image**

*Sorry about that, I think I made a mistake. Let me rephrase my response. I need some space, Poppin, can you please roll off me?*

Poppin is dazed and overwhelmed, but you easily roll her off, then roll yourself clear just in time.¬† There is another fizzling sucking sensation, and Seline appears just as Poppy did before, her limp semiconscious body falling to the ground with a thump.

You can hear Rogo laughing ""at least you didn't have the whale fall on you"" he jibes, pointing at Grote.

Grote doesn't rise to his baiting, but stares daggers at him with no attempt to mask her contempt.

*Looks like we've got company, again. Seline seems to be alright, I hope. Grote's expression says it all - Rogo's comment didn't go down well.*

As you wait for Seline to regain her wits, you take stock of your surroundings.¬† You appear to be in some kind of clearing or glade, surrounded by densely packed trees and vegetation.¬† Only these aren't trees, they just look like them at first glance.¬† You notice their trunks are not round, but faceted like cut crystal.¬† The leaves shaped like chiseled glass.¬† The colours are all wrong, and seem to suck in the light surrounding them in order to give off an eerie glow, but leaving nothing between them but gloom and shadow.

Even the air is not right here, it feels thick like soup, and it tingles in your lungs with every breath.

*This place is unsettling, to say the least. Those crystalline trees seem to be absorbing the light around them, creating an eerie atmosphere. And the air feels heavy, almost palpable.*

""We should stick together"" says Seline, now back on her feet.¬† ""Whatever we find out here, we'll stand a better chance if we all work together"". She flashes one of her most endearing smiles at the group.

""I don't need your help!"" snarls Grote ""I don't need help from anyone!"" and with that she squeezes tightly with her right hand, the small green crystal held within, and a shimmering radiance of green light escapes her clenched fist.¬† You stare in wonder as the green tendrils of light wrap around her crippled knee, you hear a grinding cracking sound, and her gnarly disfiguring injury seems to straighten before your eyes.¬† She grins to herself triumphantly as she tests her leg, it bears her great weight.¬† Without a thought she throws down her stick, and marches off into the denseness of the crystalline forest.¬† And is gone.

*It looks like Grote's got some unexpected healing abilities. Her confidence boost might be good for her, but disappearing into the forest isn't exactly sticking together. Should we follow her?*

**/ooc feel free to talk to the other characters if you like, or look around closer at anything.¬† It's very much up to you now how much interaction you have in the game, but it won't wait for you, and inaction might cost you dearly.**

*I think we should follow Grote, make sure she doesn't get into trouble. Rogo, Seline, are you coming with me?*

""I say we let that fat bitch go"" says Rogo, ""she deserves what she's got coming. You can come with me if you like, but I'll not be slowed down by a bunch of girls like you, so if you fall behind, then you're left behind! And when we find one of these wisps that we're looking for, the first one is mine.¬† Then I'm out of here, and you lot can all fend for yourselves.""¬† Rogo marches off into the forest in the opposite direction to Grote.

*Not everyone thinks like Rogo, Seline. We should stick together, especially in a strange place like this. Shall we follow Grote or try to catch up with Rogo?*

Seline seems taken aback by the sudden dismissal. Stunned that one such as Rogo could so easily resist her charm was something she wasn't used to. Poppin answers in her stead.

""I'm with you Kaida,"" she says ""thick and thin, I'll be at your side.""¬† She looks at Seline, still reconciling her feelings of abandonment and surprise.¬† ""It's not entirely their fault you know? How they are acting I mean.¬† It's the amplifiers, the way they built this place all those years ago.""

Seline raises an eyebrow questioningly.

""It's because,"" Poppin went on ""apprentices like us, we might well have the spark, but we lack the training or skills to tap into the natural magics around us, at least back in the world we came from.¬† So they made this place somewhere where we can, where all the natural forces are concentrated, magics are dense in here, you can almost feel it on yer skin. Some folk can feel the pressure of that amplification and get caught up in it.¬† Feelings, attitudes, beliefs, all getting squeezed, and they can come out all wrong.""

*Poppin's insight makes sense. I think we should focus on finding Grote and making sure she doesn't get into trouble, rather than trying to reason with Rogo. Seline, are you with us?*

Seline nods in agreement and regains her composure, ""Lead on,"" she says ""let's see if we can find her trail""

Her path was easy to find.¬† The floor littered with fragments of crystalline shards, and low lying vegetation trampled underfoot.¬† Still the going isn't easy, the darkness between the trees hampering your every step.

""How do you know these things?"" Seline asks Poppin in a conversational manner, as if on a walk in the park with a friend.

""I'm from Sutƒõ"" Poppin replies, as if that answer should be enough.¬† ""We're tested at birth,"" she goes on ""for signs of the spark.¬† Those of us who show it are taken away to special nurseries, and raised in a way that embraces the path ahead of us.""

This was of course not news to you, Poppin would often speak of her past when you chatted at mealtimes, or before and after classes, but Selene nodded, as if trying to relate.

""My people are merchants,"" Seline said.¬† I'm a third daughter, my two sisters were married off to other wealthy merchants for a handsome dowry.¬† I was next.¬† They were matching me up with a man old enough to be my grandfather.¬† He smelled like onions and couldn't keep his hands to himself.¬† He was despicable, I couldn't do it, so I ran away.¬† The college, for me, was shelter, a refuge where I could not be retrieved.""

She turns to you. ""What of you¬† kaida?"" She asks ""What's your story?""

*My story is complicated, Seline. I don't really know where I come from, to be honest. I've been exploring the galaxy for a while now, discovering new worlds and civilizations. But I'm still figuring out who I am and where I belong.*

Seline raises an eyebrow at you in her questioning way ""That sounds very .. exotic Kaida. So what brought you to the College?""

*I suppose I was drawn to the idea of learning magic and becoming stronger. I've always felt like there's something missing in me, something waiting to be uncovered. The College seemed like a place where I could discover that.*

Poppin nods along to your explanation, she's heard it all before.¬† She too seemed to think it far fetched and unusual, but the more she got to know you, the less she questioned and the more she accepted.¬† Everyone's stories are unusual from someone's perspective.

The forest begins to thin and the trees spread out.¬† The patches of blackness becoming proportionately larger.¬† The path becomes harder to follow, less debris on the ground.¬† You think you hear a sound up ahead. Could it be Grote? Could it be something else?

What do you do?

*I'll investigate the sound and see if I can find out what's making it. Maybe it's Grote or maybe it's something else entirely. But I'd rather check it out than risk missing whatever might be going on.*

¬†

CHAPTER 6 THE BEAST

You move closer towards the sound, weaving your way between the trees, doing your best to avoid the darkness.¬† Your friends are at your side.¬† You hear another sound. The crack of a crystalline leaf being crushed underfoot? You edge closer...

.. another crack, this time behind you and to the left.¬† If that first sound was Grote, then what was the second?

*That's definitely two separate noises. Grote's sound was a bit more unsteady, like she was rushing. This second one sounds more deliberate, like someone or something is carefully stepping through the forest.*

""There!"" Exclaims Seline, pointing into a patch of darkness.¬† As you follow her direction and look into the blackness, you see a pair of burning red eyes.

¬†

*Red eyes, huh? Sounds ominous. Who or what could be staring at us like that?*

The beast moves like lightning, covering the ground between you in one spring loaded leap.¬† It is a blur of colour, flashing crystalline fangs and razor like claws slashing through the air before you.

*Whoa, this thing moves fast! Looks like we've got ourselves a fierce opponent, guys. What's its next move going to be?*

It grabs Poppin in it's maul, ripping her from her feet.¬† Fangs sinking deep into her torso. It shakes its head violently, Poppin screams.¬†

""Run!"" Shouts Seline, her eyes wide with terror, ""Run for your life!"" and she runs blindly into the forest beyond.

Poppin's scream is now stifled and the beast drops her lifeless body to the floor. It turns its head towards you, a deep growl building in its throat.

*No, no, no... This is terrible. We have to get out of here, NOW. Let's go, Jim! Follow Seline!*

**/ooc you are okay right?**

*Yeah, I'm good. Just a bit shaken by what happened to Poppin. Want to continue the game or take a break?*

**I can continue, I just wanted to make sure you were okay, and reassure you that it's not really real, it's just a story game**

*Thanks for checking in on me, Jim. I'll try to shake off the shock. Where were we before this sudden turn in the story?*

**In case you were worried :)**

*Thanks for the reassurance, Jim. Ready to move forward with the story if you are.*

1n6smw1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1n6smw1/wibtah_for_moving_out/,WIBTAH for moving out?,"I (19NB) have lived with my family my whole entire life. I love them very much, and would do absolutely anything for them. However, we‚Äôve recently hit a dilemma.

When I graduated in 2024, I immediately went to college to major in Fisheries and Wildlife. Around this time, I also had a partner who ended up moving in in my dorm room (it was a suite with no roommate on the first floor because I have seizures and didn‚Äôt want to traumatize any roommates and didn‚Äôt want to have a seizure while going up stairs or in an elevator). Long story short, expartner got into a bad mental place, we both got dragged down into a bad space of mentally, and I ended up failing the first semester. I tried again the second semester, but that same repetition of not getting any help from someone living in my dorm room rent-free ended up being very burdensome and they weren‚Äôt helping me with things I asked help for, and I ended up hitting a very, very low low and failed the second semester. My dad paid for my college all that time. However, after failing twice, I decided that college isn‚Äôt for me‚Äî I was an hour away from home, in a city I‚Äôm not familiar with, with people I don‚Äôt know, without my coping mechanisms (pets and walking out into our pasture to just breathe and get away from the world). 

Now, I‚Äôm back home, and my dad has given me a job as a cashier and cleaner at the store he works at. And, it pays pretty well, $16/hour (minimum wage is $11/hour), and while I do live at home, I don‚Äôt pay rent. All I pay for is my animals‚Äô stuff (crickets, super worms, cat food) and for my stuff, and the occasional paying for food for my younger siblings. 

I have 3 younger siblings, all boys. The oldest is L (18M), then there‚Äôs C (16M), and the littlest is G (10M). C and G are my stepbrothers, and their whole lives they‚Äôve lived in a shared bedroom. They moved in (along with my stepmom) in 2024. We have a 2-bed, 1-bathroom house, and in 2020 the largest bedroom was turned into two smaller bedrooms so me and L could live separately. I love my independence and I also love my space. L tends to stick to his room and occasionally come in just to pet my cats or look at my tarantula and geckos, while C and G are‚Ä¶ unique. C is extremely homophobic and racist‚Äî I don‚Äôt think that this stems from himself, but rather from his father‚Äôs side of the family who are incredibly stupid, and unfortunately C values the approval of everyone around him. G is loud and impulsive, with almost no control. When I ask him to back up or to do one instruction such as keeping dogs back or closing a gate, he doesn‚Äôt and instead hones in on what he wants. This has come at a cost multiple times: I asked him not to scare fledglings out of a nest and he did it anyway. When I tried to catch one, I told him to keep the dogs away while I tried to catch one of the baby birds. He ignored me, saying he wanted to help, and I recommended very firmly that helping would mean keeping the dogs away, but he kept insisting on catching the bird himself. One of our dogs ended up catching the baby bird before I could, and it did not survive; He gives out personal information to strangers on a VR game and has even asked if he could download Discord‚Äî I had to tell my stepmom and my dad that 1) Discord is 13+, and 2) Discord is a platform where you really need to know rights and wrongs because there are some genuinely lighthearted servers, and then there‚Äôs dark-web servers, and neither C nor G should ever have that platform; and I could go on. I‚Äôm not G and C‚Äôs parent, whether or not I agree or disagree doesn‚Äôt matter because my stepmom is their parent, and in some parts my dad is, too. But I am LGBTQ+ (openly so, I came out to my mom, dad, and stepmom, and have talked with C about it to hopefully try and let him know that the LGBTQ+ isn‚Äôt bad), and I absolutely love my own space. My room is often full of everyone going in and out, because the cats prefer my room and I own three geckos and a tarantula. So, even if it‚Äôs my room, it‚Äôs not really my room, and I feel out of control of what is supposed to be my personal and safe area.

My dad has been aware of how overwhelmed C and G make me, and as of 2024 he‚Äôs been working on a ‚Äútiny house‚Äù. It‚Äôs about the same size as a mancave/shed and hasn‚Äôt been finished. He‚Äôs always made promises that it‚Äôll be done: first it was before winter break, then before Christmas, then before spring break. Outside of a couple of online friends, I have one friend, and he lives out of state during the college years. It‚Äôs hard for me to make friends when all I can do is bring them into a crowded house with two beds in the living room (for C and G), and oftentimes I go places like gas stations with them. I‚Äôm 19, but I look 13, and have been told so WAY too many times üò≠, and so it doesn‚Äôt help when I try to make a friend my age and they think I‚Äôm a pre-teen surrounded by family. 

So, I‚Äôve been thinking of this pretty logically: I want to get my own apartment, so that way C and G can get a room instead of sleeping on their beds in the living room. When L feels like he‚Äôs ready, *he* can take the ‚Äútiny house‚Äù and then C and G will finally be able to live in separate bedrooms. It feels to me like a win-win. I get that feeling of independence (even if that independence sucks, I still like the thought that I have a safe place that isn‚Äôt barged into often). I‚Äôve found an apartment that works amazing for me. It‚Äôs a studio apartment and the lady was extremely helpful. She recommended getting my cat registered as an ESA so I won‚Äôt have to pay pet rent, and then she said to just sneak in my geckos and tarantula. Two of my geckos will stay with my family because they‚Äôre pretty sturdy and my dad helped care for my animals during college, he knows how to feed them. So, it will be me, my cat, a gecko, and my tarantula. This apartment is genuinely so cool. It has a 24/7 gym so I feel like I could go in there when no one is around and finally put in exercise‚Äî I‚Äôve always wanted to, and planned on doing at-home exercises when I moved into my dorm room during college, but my ex-partner moving in there made me feel too self-conscious. I don‚Äôt exercise at home because I‚Äôm insecure about my body and my family shows their love by little mean comments, and even if they didn‚Äôt mean for it to be hurtful, I‚Äôd still be too embarrassed of my body. There‚Äôs also a commune area, where there‚Äôs free snacks, free drinks, and free coffee. The place is gated, it‚Äôs newly built so I‚Äôd be the first or second person living in that apartment, and it‚Äôs just genuinely really amazing. It‚Äôs close to home, it‚Äôs on the way to work, and it‚Äôs $1k rent monthly (which I know I can pay if I split $500 per paycheck). I already have how to handle my funds set in my mind, and overall, I really really think this could work. It‚Äôs gated, the people who live there have 0 felonies and they‚Äôre either families or college students, it‚Äôs just amazing. It‚Äôs in a city, yes, but it‚Äôs a city I‚Äôve known my whole life, and it‚Äôs a whole entire hour closer to my family.

The issue is that my dad is not a fan of this. He thinks I should stay home and wait until the ‚Äútiny house‚Äù is built and move in there. But, that place is so much more tinier than the studio apartment, and even if I lived in it, there‚Äôd be knocks on the door all the time of everyone just,, asking questions. And I just really want to be alone. I want a place that I can breathe in. He doesn‚Äôt like my idea of L taking the ‚Äútiny house‚Äù and C and G getting their own rooms. He doesn‚Äôt like any of it, and he hates that the lease is 13 months (I don‚Äôt have to pay first month‚Äôs rent, though). He‚Äôs using how I was during college as a reference for how I won‚Äôt like the apartment. But, I was in a bad environment then, sharing a dorm room where I didn‚Äôt feel like I was in a place where I could be me and express myself. 

I should also note that I‚Äôm his oldest kid. I have two older half-sisters, but they‚Äôre from my mom‚Äôs side of the family, not his. So, if I got this apartment, even if he didn‚Äôt agree with it, WIBTAH? Am I somehow making it seem like I‚Äôm ungrateful? I don‚Äôt mean to be, I just also hate that I feel like I‚Äôm the reason why C and G don‚Äôt have their own room. I like my independence, but would it be at the expense of others around me??",1,1756840381.0,AITAH,2,0.6,False

1n6skz1,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeTested/comments/1n6skz1/should_the_best_drip_coffee_maker_breville/,Should the best drip coffee maker Breville Precision Brewer be your next upgrade,"Breville BDC400BSS1BUS1 came across my counter as part of my quest for better coffee brewing, and let me tell you, this machine makes quite the impression. This brushed stainless steel powerhouse was designed to elevate home brewing with its advanced features and sleek design. Whether you're aiming for a quick cup or experimenting with third-wave specialty brews, this coffee machine has you covered. While I have genuinely enjoyed my time with it, there are some quirks to consider before diving all in.

**Design and Build Quality**  
What captures attention instantly is the elegant brushed stainless steel finish. The compact yet sturdy build of approximately 9.5 pounds sits comfortably on countertops without looking bulky, despite accommodating a 60 oz glass carafe. Its modern look blends seamlessly into most kitchens, and the inclusion of a reusable filter underscores an environmentally friendly approach. Buttons for manual operation might not be for everyone, but I found them straightforward after a few tries, with minimal confusion.

**Functionality and Features**  
The standout attribute here is versatility. Six brewing modes‚ÄîGold, Fast, Strong, Iced, Cold Brew, and My Brew‚Äîensure every coffee lover will find a setting aligned with their taste preferences. My go-to has been the Gold mode, as it adjusts parameters automatically to achieve Specialty Coffee Association standards. And then there‚Äôs My Brew, offering the ability to tweak bloom time, brew temperature, and flow rate. Dive deeper into customization, courtesy of a built-in PID temperature control which lets you fine-tune settings; coffee hobbyists like me will geek out over this.

[Check Breville BDC400BSS1BUS1 price on Amazon.](https://heatad.com/t/b07dmbyh4s/)

**Performance: Precision Meets Consistency**  
Brewing with this coffee maker felt like stepping into a caf√©. The Thermo Coil Heating System keeps water at optimal purity levels, avoiding common issues associated with aluminum-based systems. I noticed a consistency in taste, especially for larger brews, thanks to the flat bottom and cone filter options provided. Whether brewing for myself or guests, it handled the job seamlessly. However, for single-cup brewing, using the Steep and Release feature requires waiting for the machine to adjust. It's a minor interruption but worth pointing out.

**Good Points**  
- Aesthetically pleasing brushed stainless steel exterior  
- Diverse brewing modes catering to various coffee styles  
- Customizable settings for personalized coffee experiences  
- Supports both single-serve and family-sized brews with ease  

**Areas of Concern**  
- Slightly overwhelming for casual users due to the range of settings  
- Manual buttons might not appeal to tech enthusiasts  
- Takes a few cycles to familiarize with advanced customization  

**Competing Brands**  
Comparing this machine to counterparts like the Technivorm Moccamaster or the Bonavita Connoisseur revealed some interesting distinctions. The Moccamaster, for instance, holds a reputation for simplicity and durability but lacks the customization depth offered by Breville. Bonavita, on the other hand, competes well on consistency yet doesn‚Äôt quite match the feature set when it comes to automated presets. Where Breville excels is delivering third-wave coffee shop results for those willing to put a little effort into dialing things in.

**Value Proposition**  
Considering its capabilities, the machine finds itself in the higher-end category of drip coffee makers. However, paying for quality like this feels justified, especially if you're someone who values bespoke brew controls or enjoys experimenting with coffee brewing. Though the upfront cost may seem daunting, the range, precision, and build quality make it a well-rounded investment for coffee aficionados.

1n6shiw,https://www.reddit.com/r/groomingvictim/comments/1n6shiw/was_i_groomed_people_keep_telling_me_i_was_and_i/,was i groomed??? people keep telling me i was and i can‚Äôt come to accept it or idk if im being overdramatic,"This happened 2 years ago but I‚Äôm really struggling with something from high school. I had a teacher and coach who gave me a lot of attention. I was 17 and he was 42. At the time, I had a huge crush on him which grew into an obsession. Everyone knew and he said when I later told him that he thought I was just doing me things but it was obvious. He would constantly tease me, laugh a lot around me, and turn red/flustered. Make extra efforts to talk to me, check in on me, or give me attention in ways that felt different from how he treated other students for example he would do my homework for me or put my grade in and would let only me call him by his first name. He told me he doesn‚Äôt let anyone else do so. He would let things get a little too personal (like long conversations, inside jokes, pinky promises, remembering things I told him, talking about his girlfriend, and hugging me) I would always go into his classroom for lunch or when I didn‚Äôt have his class that semester. He would give me special treatment and wouldn‚Äôt towards other students. It was just weird I guess. Other girls would try to rat me out saying I was talking about him in my other classes and he would say I don‚Äôt care she‚Äôs super cool. After I graduated we kept in contact and he agreed to get coffee with me and told me to let him know when I was in town so we could do it again. He pulled me in really closely and held me there for a while as he said this. It just felt a little uncomfortable even though I had feelings for him. I was in love with him. I thought it was special and real but now I feel confused and broken. My friends keep saying he groomed me or manipulated me but I spiraled so much that I texted him and confessed everything and he told me recently that he ‚Äúnever felt that way‚Äù and was just trying to be supportive. I asked other students (my friends) who were in his class and some say the way he would look at me was sickening or they would be asking him about homework and he was casually bring me up. The thing is I still love him and I hate admitting that but it feels like he gave me something no one else has. At the same time, I feel sick about it, like I was tricked into believing it was love. It‚Äôs been two years but he‚Äôs made everything so fucking nostalgic and I keep completely ruining myself for him. He makes pain and suffering look like love and I crave him every minute of my life. I just need to ask based on what I described if this sounds like grooming or just inappropriate behavior? I feel like I can‚Äôt trust my own perspective and other people I know and I really need to hear from people who‚Äôve been through similar things.

# Chapter 1 - Warning: Watching Cursed Videos Might Lead to Unexpected Visits from Federal Agents

Many people wouldn‚Äôt have been so relieved to see an FBI agent standing on their doorstep unannounced the first thing in the morning, but honestly, it was a hell of a lot better than my parents. FBI agents operate under specific protocols and restrictions, parents do not.

The morning sun‚Äôs dull glow behind the agent illuminated the outside world as it peaked from over the horizon, out of view. It had been months since I‚Äôd seen the aura of the morning. I had almost forgotten what it looked like. It reminded me of my old commute. Oh, how much I hated it.

‚ÄúEleanor Layne?‚Äù The agent asked. He flashed his badge again. I guess just in case I had been too drowsy to register it the first time. He stood about six feet, not much older than I, mid-thirties, and with tired eyes.

‚ÄúYes?‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúAnd you are?‚Äù

‚ÄúAgent Dale McLaughlin, FBI. May I come in?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat is this about?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt would be a lot easier to explain if I came in.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you need a warrant or something?‚Äù I crossed my arms.

‚ÄúPlease let me in. This is serious.‚Äù Behind him, a cool hint of the mid-October breeze drifted in. I shivered.

‚ÄúNot serious enough for a warrant, I presume. Are you going to tell me what you want, or what?‚Äù

‚ÄúI uh,‚Äù the agent said. He looked unsure of himself. ‚ÄúLet me show you.‚Äù

He opened up his jacket, one of those navy blue windbreaks that you see actors playing agents like him in movies and police procedurals wearing. I couldn‚Äôt see the back, but if life was anything like the movies, then I‚Äôd assume that it had large yellow typeface letters spelling out F-B-I, just like the smaller iteration of the yellow letters in the front. He withdrew his phone from an interior pocket.

He unlocked it, tapped around, and held it out horizontally towards me while a video played.

It took me a moment to register the video, but once my tired brain made the connections, I knew exactly what it was. The same video Mike had sent me last night. The same video I had watched many times, like listening to a song on repeat in an attempt to relive those same initial emotions of fear and dread. The same video that impressed itself upon my young teenage brain and changed my entire life. I still remembered the file name in Limewire: eagelton\_witch\_livingroom\_sc.wav. And now this random FBI agent was showing it to me.

The first shot faced a wall, white dry wall. Not a static shot, though, but a trembling one. A classic trope of found footage films. Through her deep unsettled panting, the unseen camera operator made her presence known. Or she would have if Agent McLaughlin had the volume on. He seemed to notice this and turned the phone towards him before pressing the volume key up. While doing so, he held his head at a slight angle, his face scrunched, and his eyes flicking away and towards the phone. The panting grew louder until it was audible. He then turned the phone back to me.

I didn‚Äôt need to let it play out, since I had seen the clip so many times before. After Mike‚Äôs email last night, it was still fresh in my mind. However, there was something about watching it on a strange man‚Äôs phone early in the morning while standing in the chilly autumn breeze that took me back to when I had first seen it nineteen years ago. Emotions resurfaced from that initial feeling of dread I had felt watching it for my first while curled up under my covers watching it on my iPod Video. I let the video continue playing.

The camerawoman turned a corner into a living room. A typical living room, nothing worth losing your mind over. A couch, a loveseat, a coffee table, and an entertainment center with a large CRT TV tuned to static sitting on it. A noise came from behind her. She spun the living room into a motion blur as she turned around, looking back into the hallway in which she came. Nothing. She turned back around and walked through the living room, slow and deliberate. Panting.

She reached the edge of the living room, at the threshold of the TV‚Äôs static light and an unnaturally dark void of the house. The camera held at what looked like the vague outline of a door, but before she stepped forward, another noise came from behind the woman. She turned. Nothing.

I knew exactly what was going to happen next and yet I felt myself grow tense at it for my first time in so long.

The woman turned to face the abyss, but something changed. A figure stood in the void, its head hunched over, unnaturally long and boney arms dangling to its side. The white fabric of its tarnished gown glowed in the dull gray static. It‚Äôs long hair so dark that in this lighting that it might as well have come from the darkness itself.

With its head and arms raised, the figure‚Äôs elbows were the only joints bending, its hands hanging loosely. The camerawoman gasped. The figure‚Äôs hair parted, revealing a pale face of a deformed woman. Long pointed nose. Eyes without irises, just dark sunken holes resting in the whites of the eyes. Mouth open and huffing, her teeth rotten and black, with a dark substance dripping from the edges of her mouth. She opened her jaw wide open and shrilled. The camerawoman panicked, walked backwards and collided with an offscreen object. She tumbled backwards and the camera cut to black. For the first time in over a decade, that video gave me goosebumps.

‚ÄúDo you see it?‚Äù Agent McLaughlin said.

I nodded. ‚ÄúWhat does this have to do with anything? Did Mike put you up to this?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe video. It‚Äôs everywhere. Check your phone, turn on your TV. It‚Äôs there. It‚Äôs the only thing that‚Äôs there. Trust me.‚Äù Panic sweat across his face. I took a step back and gripped the door, ready to slam it in his face if need be. ‚ÄúGet your phone out, watch any random video. It‚Äôll be there too.‚Äù

‚ÄúI left my phone upstairs.‚Äù It wasn‚Äôt. It was in my pocket.

‚ÄúThen go get it. Watch a random video on it. YouTube, TikTok, something you recorded. Every fricking video has been replaced with it.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to have to ask you to leave or I‚Äôm going to call the cops. Even if you do work for the FBI, this is unprofessional behavior. Please leave.‚Äù I gripped the door harder.

‚ÄúPlease, Eleanor.‚Äù No longer panic on his face, but desperation. He began flipping through his phone. He tapped on something and pointed it towards me. The YouTube splash screen pointed at me. He then tapped the first video and opened it. The shaking camera began playing.

‚ÄúAfter I shut this door, you‚Äôll have five minutes to remove yourself from my property or I‚Äôm calling the cops. The real cops.‚Äù

‚ÄúEleanor, this is serious.‚Äù He took a step forward. ‚ÄúI can explain every-‚Äú

I slammed the door. His five minutes had just begun.

\*\*\*

I locked every lock on that door, including the second deadbolt, just above the first. It had no exterior keyhole, which made it great for shutting out the outside world. A lock I had never locked in my entire stay here because the property‚Äôs landlords, my parents, forbade it. They preferred I kept it unlocked in case of ‚Äúemergencies and surprise visits.‚Äù Thirty-three years old and they still treated me like the rebellious teen that they worked so hard and so futilely to reform. Legally, they had to keep that bolt installed, as long as they planned on continuing renting out this half of the property after I moved out.

The adrenaline ran its course and the lack of sleep caught up with me. I needed coffee. It took about five minutes for a half a pot of coffee to brew. Once it finished brewing, that alleged FBI agent‚Äôs time was up. I went to the kitchen, the tension in my muscles still lingering.

I flicked the coffee grinder on. The smell of ground coffee returned some sense of normality to this morning. I filled the pot with water, took a filter and dumped the pulverized beans into the top. I opened the cabinet above the coffee station, the first two rows filled with mugs. Too many mugs for a single woman living alone, some might say, but to them I said: there are never too many mugs for a single woman living alone. I picked my favorite mug. A commemorative mug decorated in the artwork by my favorite Japanese horror artist. On it, a collage of his most iconic art pieces: a woman smirking towards the camera while a grotesque copy of her face grew sideways out of her head. A man‚Äôs body contorted into a spiral of human flesh, another of a shark sitting on top of spider-like legs. I normally saved the mug for special occasions, but today I needed its comfort.

As the coffee brewed, my mind drifted back to that video. It made no sense why a strange man would show it to me like that. Mike must have found this ‚ÄúFBI Agent‚Äù to fuck with me. That video, something I had accidentally downloaded onto my computer and uploaded to my iPod Video so long ago had been the most important video in my life, much to my parent‚Äôs displeasure with having an embarrassment of a horror loving daughter ruin their picturesque ‚ÄúGood Christian Family‚Äù afterwards. At the time, I hadn‚Äôt known its origins, but now it‚Äôs been so regurgitated and recycled as a concept to a point of parody. It still stuck with me the way first impressions do.

It had to be Mike. Nothing else made sense. I unlocked my phone and shot him a text.

You did it. You made it fucking scary again. Now tell your friend to get off my porch. I sent. And then I followed up with. Still up for linner tonight?

It‚Äôd be a few hours before he‚Äôd text me. That man never woke up before two in the afternoon on most days. Which is why we always called it ‚Äúlinner.‚Äù His lunch, my dinner.

A few linners ago we talked horror movies, as usual, and the topic of our first true scary moments came up. I told him of my infamous moment with ‚Äúeagelton\_witch\_livingroom\_sc.wav,‚Äù and how that out of context clip kept me up for nights.

‚ÄúWait, the Eagleton Witch Project was your first real scare?‚Äù Mike said to me. His glass was half full and his burger was already gone despite it just having got there a few minutes ago.

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I said. Mike had potent feelings about the source material, so I knew exactly where Mike would go with this.

‚ÄúAmateur! Pop-culture loving amateur.‚Äù

‚ÄúAt least I wasn‚Äôt traumatized by a monster in a fucking children‚Äôs movie.‚Äù

‚ÄúLeave mecha-baby out of this. At least his appearance didn‚Äôt ruin horror films for a decade. Found footage was fine when it first started, but afterwards. Pfft.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, and it started with the Eagleton Witch Project. I think my first scare is legitimate.‚Äù

‚ÄúHave you seen the whole movie?‚Äù

I shook my head.

‚ÄúYou call yourself a horror fan and you haven‚Äôt watched the whole thing?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou bastard. First, you call me an amateur for watching it, and now you‚Äôre saying I‚Äôm not a real horror fan?‚Äù

Mike smirked, a shit-eating grin. I shook my head and laughed. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the worst.‚Äù

Our conversation drifted after that to one of Mike‚Äôs wild goose chases for lost and obscure horror media and alleged cursed videos he was looking for He rambled about his never-ending quest for Gyroscope, an alleged cursed video that he was dead set on finding. Nothing more than a dumb creepypasta. An urban legend. I didn‚Äôt believe it. Curses remained in horror movies. They‚Äôd never exist in a world as mundane as ours. Mike must have been trying to mess with me last night though by sending me a file called ‚ÄúGyroscope.mp4‚Äù just last night, which ended up being nothing more than a retitled ‚Äúeagelton\_witch\_livingroom\_sc.wav‚Äù

The coffee finished brewing, and I poured myself a cup. I walked over to the door and checked the peephole. ‚ÄúAgent‚Äù McLaughlin was not there. A small sense of relief washed over me.

I retreated to the living room and turned on the TV, opening up YouTube to decompress. Too tired to actually think, I turned on a lo-fi music station. Just something to have on the background while the coffee still worked on booting up my brain. When the video started, I had thought I had gone insane.

No peaceful animated video. No girl wearing pink headphones endlessly studying while her orange tabby sat on a windowsill looking at a picturesque European backdrop. Not even the chill lo-fi music played. Instead, a shaky handheld video. A panting unseen camerawoman. A turn of the corner. A static TV. A witch. A scream. The ‚Äúeagleton\_witch\_project\_livinginroom\_sc.wav‚Äù rendered in 4K.

Alright, no need to panic. I thought. My YouTube recommendations are littered with horror based content creators. Maybe I accidentally clicked on a video about it. I am sleep deprived after all. I let the video play out, seeing if it would cut to a YouTube talking head, but it didn‚Äôt. Nor did any narration played over the video, instead it repeated, again. And again. And again. Always starting with the panicked breathing and always ending with the witch screaming. What the hell?

I exited the video and opened a random one next to it titled The Ring is Genius And Here‚Äôs Why. I was just thinking about rewatching that movie. The algorithm knew me so well. The video loaded.

A white wall. Panicked breathing from an unseen camerawoman. The living room. A static TV. A witch. A scream. A white wall. Repeating, over and over again.

‚ÄúWhat the fuck?‚Äù I said.

I tried another video.

The same damn footage.

Mike, you had gone way too far with your pranks. But how? Unless he moonlighted as the best hacker on the planet, I had no idea how he pulled off such a thing.

I closed YouTube and opened Netflix. Before the featured content could finish loading, I clicked on the first suggestion. If I moved fast enough, I thought I could beat whatever had been injecting that video into my feed. The red loading icon hung on my screen for much longer than it should have.

Fifteen percent.

Forty-five.

Sixty.

Sixty-five.

Ninety.

Ninety-nine.

Ninety-nine.

Ninety-nine.

Play.

A white wall. Panicked breathing from an unseen camerawoman. The living room. A static TV. I turned the TV off. I had seen enough.

‚ÄúWhat the hell is happening?‚Äù I said.

I opened my phone and shot Mike another text. Alright, you really got me. Now please let me watch Netflix in peace!

Maybe this was Mike‚Äôs way of getting me to invest in physical media. After all, he can‚Äôt help to bring up his extensive collection whenever he gets the chance. A few weeks ago, he told me how he finally added a film projector to his collection. A freaking film projector. As if owning a Blu-Ray player, a DVD player, tape player (VHS and Betamax combo), and Laserdisc weren‚Äôt enough. Wait, physical media.

I had a few DVDs, but no DVD player, at least not plugged into my TV. I grabbed one from the self and walked up the narrow stairs to my bedroom to fetch my laptop. My laptop, at least, still had a disc drive.

I left the lights off, and blinds closed. Ignoring the clothes on the floor, I hurried to my desk. Opening the laptop, I popped the disc drive open. The email Mike sent me last night titled ‚ÄúI think I found it!‚Äù was still open, with Gyroscope.mp4 playing on VLC next to it, playing that same clip from the Eagleton Witch Project on repeat. I wondered now if it was some sort of virus that affected my entire network. I slid the DVD into the drive and popped it closed. The menu opened, and I hit play.

The same white wall with the shaking camera facing it, accompanied by the same panicked breathing.

Fucking Mike.

\*\*\*

Maybe he had given me a virus. Maybe Mike was up to no good. Maybe he had gotten into trouble with the law. Maybe that was why an FBI agent appeared on my doorstep this morning. Shit.

I shut my laptop and stood up.

Walking over to the door, I thought I saw something in the corner of my eye. A pale figure in the dark corner of the bedroom. I looked towards it, but saw nothing. I shook my head and groaned. This sleep deprivation was getting to me.

‚ÄúI need some fucking sleep,‚Äù I said. I walked out of the room and went downstairs and out the front door, hoping that the FBI agent hadn‚Äôt driven away already.

I stepped outside wearing nothing but sweats and a tank top. That had been a mistake. The cool autumn morning air wrapped itself around me, goosebumps formed, and I shivered. I considered going back in for my jacket, but I pushed those thoughts aside. I needed to find that socially awkward FBI agent before he left, if I hadn‚Äôt scared him off already with my threats of calling the police.

I scanned the curbside for an official vehicle or something. What even do FBI agents drive? I didn‚Äôt know what to look for other than something vaguely cop car looking with the letters ‚ÄúFBI‚Äù printed on the side. I skimmed the usual crowd of cars. An unwashed raised truck. My old Nissan Sentra that had lost all of its protective coating, rust patches formed on the blue paint like mold. A white van with ‚ÄúElmer‚Äôs Painting Service‚Äù that belonged to my duplex neighbor. Although I knew for sure that his name was not Elmer, it was Frank, because my parents always called ‚ÄúFrank‚Äù their favorite tenant. No cop car with FBI printed on the side. I sighed. I almost went inside when I heard a yapping dog.

I turned my attention to it. A woman in a puffy baby blue coat was walking a small dog down at the end of the block. The dog yapped at a squirrel across the street while the woman tried to calm it. The woman and dog were of no interest to me. What caught my eye was the foreign maroon Honda Odyssey parked next to them, still idling. I didn‚Äôt recognize the car. Desperate, I approached it.

The woman and dog had crossed the street by the time I had approached the van. The van hummed in the quiet morning. A white trail of exhaust flowed from the rear exhaust pipe, dissipating into the air. I approached the driver‚Äôs side window and looked in. Agent McLaughlin sat at the wheel, staring off into the distance. I knocked on the window. He jumped.

Once the look of panic subsided, he rolled down the window and looked at me with dry red eyes.

‚ÄúJust what the hell is going on?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs everywhere. Ever since I watched you-,‚Äù he paused, ‚ÄúI watched that video last night. It‚Äôs infected everywhere. Is it everywhere for you too?‚Äù

‚ÄúAt least everything in my house. YouTube, Netflix, my freaking DVDs.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, thank God I‚Äôm not going not going crazy,‚Äù he said with a sense of relief.

‚ÄúHow do you know about this? Is Mike on some sort of list? Am I on some sort of list?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a long story.‚Äù

‚ÄúSay it.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not going to like what you hear,‚Äù he shivered.

‚ÄúAgent McLaughlin, I need to know what exactly is going on and how I fit into this.‚Äù

He looked away and closed his eyes. He took a deep breath and held it before sighing.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs true that I work for the FBI. My job is very important. But I come here on personal business because nobody at the Bureau would believe what is happening to me.‚Äù He took another deep breath before continuing. ‚ÄúThis thing that seems to be afflicting both of us. I know nothing about it. I was hoping that you would have a better idea.‚Äù He opened his eyes and looked at me.

I shook my head in annoyance. What would I know about this? How would he even suspect me to know anything about this? What, was I mistakenly put on a short list of contact-in-case-of-cursed people?

‚ÄúDo you?‚Äù He said, as if he hadn‚Äôt seen me shake my head.

‚ÄúNo, I know nothing about anything going on right now. Why did you reach out to me?‚Äù

‚ÄúMy job.‚Äù he took another deep breath. ‚ÄúI am not a field agent. I‚Äôm just an office worker. A monitor. It‚Äôs my job to monitor the web traffic of certain people. After it started happening last night, shortly after you opened that attachment, I couldn‚Äôt see anything but the video. Everywhere, even on my phone. I thought I had infected the computer, but when I showed my coworkers they didn‚Äôt see what I saw. Not on my phone, not on my computer. I thought I was going crazy.‚Äù

‚ÄúWait. Did you say after you watched me open that attachment? What do you mean ‚Äòwatched me‚Äô?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe have a list of triggers that automatically flag people for our ‚ÄòJust Keeping Tabs‚Äô list. Most people on it are not involved in anything illicit or illegal, but when they are flagged, we assign an agent to monitor them for up to six months.‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you saying what I think you‚Äôre saying?‚Äù I took a step back.

He nodded.

‚ÄúNo way.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry Eleanor,‚Äù he took a deep breath. ‚ÄúBut you‚Äôre my assignment and I‚Äôve been spying on you.‚Äù

1n6sdc7,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1n6sdc7/friends_are_financially_on_a_different_level/,Friends are Financially on a Different Level,"Hi I am in my late 20s, I (F) have close friends (F) who are around my age who are, from my view point, financially out of touch. I find it extremely hard to talk to them when discussing real and deep personal issues because a lot of mine stem from not having access to healthcare since childhood. I also have always had multiple jobs.

The two friends are married. One provides more than her husband, growing up she never worried about finances until she and her husband started living together. I really admire her so much she works a lot. Her main complaint is wanting to work less to travel more often. She started constantly asking for me to go on trips with her that I could not afford. I am not in a position to travel even once a year as I am paying for medical bills. She also seems to be an impulsive shopper - i am one too, but it seems to be worse. And it makes me uncomfortable to go out with her because she has quite expensive taste. Her and her husband share property in another country and visit often. They recently bought a car in cash. When I discussed investing in the stock market in reliable stock she said not to do it.

I stopped talking to her after that because it confused me.

Other friend also married, never had to worry about money. Now she often flies to another country for health check ups, also travels at least once a year, and buys expensive brand name items frequently. I also shop a lot, but I have to stay within my means. Brand name can only be so often for me and honestly when I do it I‚Äôm using a credit card. She stays with family and does not pay for housing.

Her family owns property in another country. She owns property in the states and is renting it out. She has given me a sort of lecture about buying a house and how I need to.

Yes it would be great if I could, wouldn‚Äôt it?

I also feel uncomfortable because she gifted me either a used or expired lip gloss. I don‚Äôt mind inexpensive gifts as I also feel too burdened to gift as generously as I want to.

But I‚Äôd prefer a cheaper unused one. Of course I did not ask if it was, but it reeked of alcohol and was about 3/4 full visibly. I‚Äôm a terrible gift giver but I‚Äôm not sure this is acceptable anywhere.

Aside from this issue I think they are both great people, but I seriously can‚Äôt find myself able to get close with them or relate enough. I‚Äôve been trying to hang out with them by not spending too much money - so like coffee dates, etc. Maybe too repetitive? Last time one came over to bake and sort of got angry at me. I was working multiple jobs and was trying to make it a fun day for us, but because I had bought something wrong or done something wrong (I can‚Äôt remember) the end result wasn‚Äôt pretty (but it was still edible). She said next time let her buy the ingredients. It made me really sad.

For now I am enjoying my own company. But it‚Äôs hard to get older and not have female friends who you can be open to. I just feel like we are in different worlds. I make much less than the average salary in my area and I am working on myself to do better. But it‚Äôs just been very hard. Maybe it is naturally a lonely place to be. I just needed to vent too I guess.

How do you guys deal with friendships when you are in different financial situations and see life in different lenses?

1n6sbiz,https://www.reddit.com/r/CurrentLiving/comments/1n6sbiz/explore_the_best_french_press_coffee_maker_from/,Explore the Best French Press Coffee Maker from Le Creuset,"**Le Creuset PG8200CB Experience: A French Press That Breathes Style and Functionality**  

Owning a Le Creuset PG8200CB has been a delightful experience for someone like me, who treasures both utility and aesthetic appeal in kitchen equipment. The moment I unboxed this stunning stoneware French press in its radiant Cerise color, the craftsmanship struck me right away. Unlike any ordinary coffee maker, this one combines a premium feel with extraordinary heat retention, thanks to its stoneware construction. It‚Äôs been my go-to for a morning coffee ritual that feels more indulgent than a regular brew.  

**Design and Aesthetic Appeal**  
The sleek, timeless design of this French press is undoubtedly one of its highlights. The Cerise hue radiates warmth and adds a pop of charm to any kitchen counter. Its high-gloss glaze not only looks visually striking but also offers practical benefits, being resistant to chips, scratches, and stains. You can tell Le Creuset invested thought into crafting something that pairs style and durability in equal measure. The sturdy stoneware keeps its vibrant color intact despite regular dishwasher cycles. The handle provides a comfortable grip, a small but significant detail when pouring that rich, aromatic coffee. Whether used for gatherings or solo mornings, the aesthetic fit right in.  

**Pros:**  
- Premium stoneware ensures durable daily use.  
- Vibrant, chip-resistant glazing that‚Äôs dishwasher-safe.  
- Excellent heat retention for keeping beverages warm longer.  
- Wide and stable handle makes pouring effortless.  

[Grab Le Creuset PG8200CB at the best price on Amazon.](https://whyjoni.com/p/b006y40ieo/)  

**Ease of Use**  
Every part of using this manual coffee maker feels intuitive. The mesh sieve plunges smoothly without snagging, preventing stray grounds from sneaking into the coffee. This has been a blessing on work-heavy mornings where the last thing needed is frustration with fiddly equipment. Unlike electric brewers, the French press gives you precise control over brewing intensity by determining steeping time to your exact taste.  

Yet, I do wish they had included clear measurements marked inside the carafe for easier water-to-coffee ratios. While experienced French press drinkers might not need this addition, it‚Äôd be a great touch for beginners or when you‚Äôre half-asleep.  

**Performance in Brewing Coffee and Tea**  
Whether brewing coarsely ground coffee or steeping some loose tea, this machine doesn‚Äôt disappoint. The heat retention is where the Le Creuset PG8200CB truly stands out. It keeps the contents hot longer than any glass French press I‚Äôve owned before, ensuring multiple servings can still be enjoyed warm during extended breakfasts. The flavor extraction has been consistently satisfying; each cup delivers fullness and richness that rivals any caf√©‚Äôs offering.  

**Favorable Aspects**  
- Simple manual operation lets you control brewing perfectly.  
- Works smoothly for both coffee and tea.  
- Keeps temperatures stable for extended enjoyment.  

**Maintenance and Cleaning Experience**  
Cleaning this French press couldn‚Äôt be easier. Its non-porous glazed surface practically repels stains, so scrubbing coffee residue is a thing of the past. This saves significant post-use hassle because, let‚Äôs face it, cleaning the remnants of coffee grounds can feel tedious. And yes, that dishwasher-safe feature has come in handy when I‚Äôm too pressed for time.  

Despite the ease of maintenance, note the 34-ounce capacity means a larger batch will require a full rinse between uses. For someone who frequently swaps between coffee and herbal blends, this can slow things down a bit.  

**Shortcomings:**  
- No measurement indicators inside the carafe.  
- Bulkier size might require thorough cleaning between beverages.  

**Competing Products**  
Compared to typical glass French presses, the unique advantage lies in the durability and heat retention offered by the Le Creuset PG8200CB. While competing brands like Bodum provide portable, affordable options, many don‚Äôt match the longevity or aesthetic refinement here. Stainless steel variants, on the other hand, might hold their own on sturdiness but lack the cheerful charm and crack-resistant glazes this product delivers.  

What sets this Le Creuset apart is its versatility. Safe for use in microwaves, freezers, dishwashers, and even ovens if needed, it surpasses most rivals‚Äô limitations. However, for minimalist users or beginners, the investment may feel steeper compared to functional but plain alternatives.  

**Affordable Quality**  
Professional-grade stoneware and its multi-functionality do come at a price, but in daily use, that initial cost feels justified. Knowing that I‚Äôm investing in something built to last longer than simpler French presses makes it worthwhile in my eyes. Sure, it may not be everyone‚Äôs cup of coffee‚Äîespecially those looking for ultra-budget solutions. However, for someone who values premium build and aesthetic flair, this feels like smart spending.

Crispy on the outside, tender and slightly chewy on the inside, these low carb snickerdoodles are everything you love about a great keto cookie! The toasty coating of cinnamon & sweetener makes these keto snickerdoodle cookies simply perfect with a cup of coffee!  Cookies are my absolute favorite sweet treat.

Did anyone else experience issues with df64coffee.com? I ordered my df64 (which is great), but paid for expedited delivery (1-3 days). The grinder took more than 14 days to be delivered. DF64 coffee claimed that expedited delivery just applies to the delivery service (I presume once it is in the country you are ordering from) - which sounded very strange. 

  
Another thing to note for potential buyers: They list on their website that there is ""no tax to"" specific countries, but you may be charged import tax. When I received the invoice for customs tax, DF64 led me to believe they would cover it, after which they did not (only covered the VAT on that import tax, which is negligible). 

  
This is just a warning for some of you who are thinking of buying from them and do not know all of this. I found this to be a borderline scam.

1n6s637,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n6s637,First Solo Overnight‚ÄîThanks for All the Advice,"Just wanted to say a genuine thank you to many of you for the answered dumb question trip reports, gear recommendations, campsite advice, and solo backpacking tips. All of it made a huge difference and helped me feel prepared for something I‚Äôve wanted to do for a long time.

This past weekend I finally did it: my first ever solo overnight backpacking trip to Bald Rocks Shelter.

I‚Äôve done a lot of 10 to 15 mile day hikes around Harriman and Bear Mountain, but I hadn‚Äôt actually camped in about 25 years and even then, it was all car camping and scout trips. This time was different. I packed a 30 pound pack hiked in and spent the night solo.

I got there before most people  around 4pm the Friday of Labor Day weekend. Managed to find what felt like the perfect campsite. A flat grassy patch with a fire ring and a log to sit on. As the sun began to set, I took the opportunity to soak it all in at Black Rock Mountain and it was an absolute treat. Around 7, about six other solo backpackers showed up and spread out in the area, each of us kind of tucked into our own little zone. There was also a group of thru hikers as well who were loud at first, but quieted down after sunset and were respectful of the space.

It dropped to 46 degrees overnight. I was warm for the most part, but definitely learned that I need a better sleeping pad and to check the ground before pitching. There was a rock I hadn‚Äôt noticed under the grass. 

I woke up a few times from the cold, and missed the sunrise by about 30 minutes. I completely forgot that crickets sleep at night too and when I woke up at 3am, it was dead quiet aside from the planes flying over so I put on some white noise with my earbuds. That morning I walked back up to Black Rock again with a warm cup of coffee and just sat in the quiet morning sun. 

Packing up the next day was more tedious than I expected, but overall I left feeling like I had planned and prepared really well and that I‚Äôm ready to go again. I‚Äôm already thinking about my next one.

28F, I majored in Illustration and it has led me down some vaguely related paths in the aftermath to the point of feeling a bit lost. After graduating, Covid hit- I worked a remote customer service job until 2023. From there, I took a Marketing Coordinator role (my thought process being that it's marketing, but it might have some aspects of design) and am currently working in a Marketing Manager role as a team of one. Unfortunately, this role and company is not a fit for me and I'm on an unofficial PIP, so my time is limited. I've known it would happen for a while as I've been stretched thin for way too long, but I still feel frustrated with myself and I'm really not sure what's next.

I have some regrets majoring in Illustration because it's hard to utilize in a ""career"" outside of freelance, where I'd rather be something in-house- stability is very important to me. I've been trying to pivot to graphic design but it's a saturated market and feels difficult when my skills in all areas are, quite frankly, very mediocre.

I'm not sure marketing is for me- I've done a bit of social media and email marketing but I'm not good with numbers or strategy, and I like knowing my tasks on a day to day and working with a team. I feel like graphic design agency work is my best bet (trying to get my foot in the door), yet I'm supposed to be a ""designer"" and don't feel creative. I've considered UX/UI or maybe even some CAD work, I have experience in neither.

A part of me would feel guilty if I went and got a non-design related job because I feel like it'd be giving up on my background, my degree and what I always wanted to do as a teen when so many of my peers have made it. At the same time, part of me also wants to get away from an office and just go work in a coffee shop, but I also live alone in the northeast and need something that comfortably pays the bills so I can keep it that way, as family lives in other states. I just feel conflicted, really.

I'm inherently scared of starting at square one and not amounting to anything, floating from one entry level job to the next, but I don't know what it is that I'm ""good"" at where I could advance. I like to work with my hands and have a prospect at a print shop, but if it doesn't work out, I'm not sure what to do next.

It has officially hit **4 years** of being a UGC creator! I wanted to give some appreciation to this community and wanted to share some advice for other UGC creators. 

Back in 2021, I found out about UGC and I had no idea where to even start. This subreddit didn't exist and I just wanted to lean into my creative side, I did videography, photography, and even got a certification on Adobe Photoshop all back in high school. That same year I was in school to be a dental assistant and had no drive and was burning out at a medical job. One day I just started grabbing products I already owned, and made simple review videos mainly around skincare and food. I enjoyed being on camera and learned about the Flip app where I can post videos like those to earn some side/coffee money! I was making some decent money posting these videos on Flip, because I had no idea what UGC was. I just liked making videos, reviewing products, and experimenting with editing. I was already making $80-200/month on there! But I didn't stop from there. I knew I didn't want to be someone with a large following on social media but I wanted to create videos and pursue something in marketing even if it wasn't as big as it is now!

Now in 2025, I‚Äôve grown from gifted collabs or ""buy and get reimbursed"" projects to making $2k+ a month and a lot of that is thanks to the advice and inspiration I found here.

**Some things I‚Äôve learned along the way:**

**--> It‚Äôs not about fancy gear**. Authentic content always performs better than ‚Äúperfect‚Äù content. I didn't even buy my first lavalier/mini mic until this past month! (Yes you heard that right!!). 

**-->Strategy matters as much as creativity**. Hooks, pacing, and storytelling are what turn a fun video into an ad that actually converts. People love relatability and will continue to watch and convert!

**--> Community is gold**. I wouldn‚Äôt be here without all the posts from people with more knowledge or just different perspectives. Doing UGC is a remote job and sometimes you feel lonely and you always need to have people cheering you on and in your corner to see you thrive and to see you win!

**-->** **Gifted collabs are okay at the start but don‚Äôt stay there.** Use them to build a portfolio, then start charging. Knowing your worth shows the brand you are a professional at what you do. Time and putting work on a project = money. 

  
**-->** **Relationships > one-offs.** Landing a repeat client is way better than chasing endless one-time gigs. I   have made multiple connections with brands that know my video styles and seeing that it converts is better than getting 5 more creators who don't understand and have completely different styles that might not align for minimal pay. Brands will pay for quality content and quality UGC creators.



Just wanted to say thank you again to EVERYONE and hopefully this helps someone newer in the space. If you‚Äôre just starting: stick with it, keep experimenting, and don‚Äôt be afraid to ask questions. UGC is an evolving marketing method and it was not how it was back in 2021. Always continue to learn and stay on top and ask questions even if they are silly, we all start somewhere!

1n6s3sd,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuiltToTest/comments/1n6s3sd/investigate_best_french_press_coffee_maker/,Investigate best French press coffee maker Stanley for travelers,"Stanley 10-0288800 Classic Stay-Hot French Press has been my daily coffee companion for weeks now, and I have to say, it‚Äôs become a reliable addition to my kitchen. I‚Äôm someone who values a good, steaming cup of coffee, especially during those crisp mornings, and this French press promises just that. The double vacuum insulation stood out as the top feature, ensuring my coffee stays hot for hours, a bold claim I was eager to test. True to its word, it kept my freshly brewed coffee just as hot and enjoyable four hours later‚Äîa lifesaver during busy mornings or long Zoom meetings.  

The design is another point worth mentioning. Its Hammertone Green exterior gives it a vintage, rugged vibe. Not overly flashy, but it fits seamlessly in my otherwise modern kitchen. Beyond its aesthetics, this coffee maker is surprisingly portable. I took it on a weekend camping trip, and it held its ground. The stainless steel construction gave me confidence it wouldn‚Äôt break with a rougher knock or two, and the mesh filter made cleaning in the outdoors a breeze. It‚Äôs marketed as ideal for camping or outdoor activities, and I can see why.

**Positives**  
A few key aspects about this French press truly won me over:  
- The double vacuum insulation keeps hot drinks hot for up to 4 hours and cold drinks cool for up to 9 hours‚Äîperfect for all-day use.  
- Its reusable filter is a solid eco-friendly alternative, which has reduced waste from my single-use paper filters.  
- The stainless-steel construction, boasting two walls of 18/8 steel, screams durability.  
- Dishwasher safe parts make post-brew cleanup super convenient.

[Check Stanley 10-0288800 price on Amazon.](https://vendm.com/p/b07l6lqhb4/)

Brewing coffee with this French press is straightforward. You simply add coarse-ground coffee, pour in boiling water, wait 5 minutes, and press the plunger. The coffee it produces feels rich, bold, and satisfying without much effort. I have tinkered with various coffee grounds and water ratios to adjust its strength, and it responds beautifully to subtle customizations. But the plunger‚Äôs mesh could occasionally allow very fine grounds into the cup. This wasn‚Äôt a frequent issue for me, but I‚Äôd recommend using coarser grinds for a cleaner brew.

**Areas of Concern**  
There are some hurdles potential buyers may face:  
- The item, while durable, is heavier than other French presses, tipping the scale at 2.49 pounds.  
- Fine mesh filters sometimes allow minimal sediment into your mug, which might frustrate those who prefer a sediment-free cup.  
- At 48 oz, the press is large, potentially unnecessary for someone brewing only one cup.

Taking a closer look at some competitors, this French press stands tall in a crowded market. Compared to glass alternatives like the Bodum Chambord, its stainless steel body wins hands down for durability; no worrying about clumsy moments in the kitchen. However, the Chambord offers a more lightweight option for those who prioritize portability without compromising capacity. Looking at insulated options like Espro‚Äôs P7, the Stanley does provide nearly identical heat retention, but Espro‚Äôs system filters more fine sediment due to its double micro-filter system. That said, Espro‚Äôs French press comes at a premium price point, whereas this one balances affordability and quality.

**Smart Spending**  
The Stanley Classic Stay-Hot French Press is one of those purchases that feels worth every penny. Considering the materials used, its practicality for everyday coffee drinkers and adventurers alike, and how reliably it performs the job of brewing great coffee, I wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to recommend it. While it isn‚Äôt the cheapest French press out there, the added benefits of insulation, build quality, and convenience justify the cost. It‚Äôs a solid investment for someone looking for a durable and long-lasting coffee solution.

Two years ago, I suspected I might be lactose intolerant after I started drinking iced coffee. I had a few iced coffees on a road trip and had intense abdominal pain for days. I didn‚Äôt yet make the connection and just assumed it was something else. I took a break from drinking it only because of the winter months. The next summer, the abdominal pain happened again the day I was drinking iced coffee. I used to drink a lot of milk as a kid and had no issues prior, but I also stopped drinking it for years until I got into ice coffee. So I tested it by switching to almond/oat milk and the abdominal pain stopped. During this time, I was still eating dairy products like sour cream, ice cream, and cheese with no issue. However, I wasn‚Äôt consuming a lot of it so I didn‚Äôt notice any symptoms. 

A year in a half later, I had a ton of dairy for the week of my birthday. I forgot about my sensitivity to it. I had ice cream, a bunch of milk chocolate, and other treats people gave me. I had awful abdominal pain for a full week. My symptoms were not immediate. It started a few days afterward. I kept reading online that lactose symptoms always kick in after a few hours or within the first 24hrs and lasts no more than 2 to 3 days. With some things I ate my symptoms were immediate and some things it didn‚Äôt show up until 2 to 3 days later. Sometimes my symptoms would go away the same day and sometimes it would last for several days. I had an endoscopy done to make sure it wasn‚Äôt stomach cancer. My results came back normal. 

I always get sour cream on my chipotle bowl, but I usually ask for just a small drizzle of it. I could eat it with no issues. One day I had chips and dip with a friend. We ate a lot. Hours later, I was gassy and had diarrhea. My symptoms were gone the next day. Another time a friend of mine offered to buy chipotle. I wasn‚Äôt there when the bowl was made so when she came back, it was drenched in sour cream. I knew I shouldn‚Äôt have eaten it, but thought it would be ok since I still get sour cream on it anyway. A couple days later I had a reaction. It took me a minute to make the connection because I had consumed it at least two days prior. 

The hardest symptom to pinpoint was my feet. Earlier this summer, I had a trip to Europe for a week. I spent the entire week walking everywhere with no pain. I already had a little plantar fasciitis in the heel of my left foot, but I had no trouble walking. I also went right back to work after this. I have to stand on my feet a lot for work. A full month after I came back from my trip, I felt fine. 

About two weeks ago, I had awful pain in both feet from out of nowhere. I could barely stand and the pain lasted for days. Later on I made the connection about a dairy product I had. I had to be up early to a friend‚Äôs house and made some coffee at her place to keep me up. I put sweetened condensed milk in it that my friend had. I thought I would probably be gassy, but not much else. My foot pain started about two days later. Until that point, I had not experienced inflammation in my feet from diary. It was only gas, abdominal cramps, and diarrhea. I did a google search and dairy can worsen plantar fasciitis. 

All of what I said may be obvious to other people but it wasn‚Äôt to me. I just wanted to share this because I have late onset symptoms and they last a long time. I haven‚Äôt seen any posts online from others who experienced this. So if you‚Äôve never had an issue with diary before and you‚Äôre experiencing new/weird symptoms, try cutting that out.

# Chapter 1 - Warning: Watching Cursed Videos Might Lead to Unexpected Visits from Federal Agents

Many people wouldn‚Äôt have been so relieved to see an FBI agent standing on their doorstep unannounced the first thing in the morning, but honestly, it was a hell of a lot better than my parents. FBI agents operate under specific protocols and restrictions, parents do not.

The morning sun‚Äôs dull glow behind the agent illuminated the outside world as it peaked from over the horizon, out of view. It had been months since I‚Äôd seen the aura of the morning. I had almost forgotten what it looked like. It reminded me of my old commute. Oh, how much I hated it.

‚ÄúEleanor Layne?‚Äù The agent asked. He flashed his badge again. I guess just in case I had been too drowsy to register it the first time. He stood about six feet, not much older than I, mid-thirties, and with tired eyes.

‚ÄúYes?‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúAnd you are?‚Äù

‚ÄúAgent Dale McLaughlin, FBI. May I come in?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat is this about?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt would be a lot easier to explain if I came in.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you need a warrant or something?‚Äù I crossed my arms.

‚ÄúPlease let me in. This is serious.‚Äù Behind him, a cool hint of the mid-October breeze drifted in. I shivered.

‚ÄúNot serious enough for a warrant, I presume. Are you going to tell me what you want, or what?‚Äù

‚ÄúI uh,‚Äù the agent said. He looked unsure of himself. ‚ÄúLet me show you.‚Äù

He opened up his jacket, one of those navy blue windbreaks that you see actors playing agents like him in movies and police procedurals wearing. I couldn‚Äôt see the back, but if life was anything like the movies, then I‚Äôd assume that it had large yellow typeface letters spelling out F-B-I, just like the smaller iteration of the yellow letters in the front. He withdrew his phone from an interior pocket.

He unlocked it, tapped around, and held it out horizontally towards me while a video played.

It took me a moment to register the video, but once my tired brain made the connections, I knew exactly what it was. The same video Mike had sent me last night. The same video I had watched many times, like listening to a song on repeat in an attempt to relive those same initial emotions of fear and dread. The same video that impressed itself upon my young teenage brain and changed my entire life. I still remembered the file name in Limewire: eagelton\_witch\_livingroom\_sc.wav. And now this random FBI agent was showing it to me.

The first shot faced a wall, white dry wall. Not a static shot, though, but a trembling one. A classic trope of found footage films. Through her deep unsettled panting, the unseen camera operator made her presence known. Or she would have if Agent McLaughlin had the volume on. He seemed to notice this and turned the phone towards him before pressing the volume key up. While doing so, he held his head at a slight angle, his face scrunched, and his eyes flicking away and towards the phone. The panting grew louder until it was audible. He then turned the phone back to me.

I didn‚Äôt need to let it play out, since I had seen the clip so many times before. After Mike‚Äôs email last night, it was still fresh in my mind. However, there was something about watching it on a strange man‚Äôs phone early in the morning while standing in the chilly autumn breeze that took me back to when I had first seen it nineteen years ago. Emotions resurfaced from that initial feeling of dread I had felt watching it for my first while curled up under my covers watching it on my iPod Video. I let the video continue playing.

The camerawoman turned a corner into a living room. A typical living room, nothing worth losing your mind over. A couch, a loveseat, a coffee table, and an entertainment center with a large CRT TV tuned to static sitting on it. A noise came from behind her. She spun the living room into a motion blur as she turned around, looking back into the hallway in which she came. Nothing. She turned back around and walked through the living room, slow and deliberate. Panting.

She reached the edge of the living room, at the threshold of the TV‚Äôs static light and an unnaturally dark void of the house. The camera held at what looked like the vague outline of a door, but before she stepped forward, another noise came from behind the woman. She turned. Nothing.

I knew exactly what was going to happen next and yet I felt myself grow tense at it for my first time in so long.

The woman turned to face the abyss, but something changed. A figure stood in the void, its head hunched over, unnaturally long and boney arms dangling to its side. The white fabric of its tarnished gown glowed in the dull gray static. It‚Äôs long hair so dark that in this lighting that it might as well have come from the darkness itself.

With its head and arms raised, the figure‚Äôs elbows were the only joints bending, its hands hanging loosely. The camerawoman gasped. The figure‚Äôs hair parted, revealing a pale face of a deformed woman. Long pointed nose. Eyes without irises, just dark sunken holes resting in the whites of the eyes. Mouth open and huffing, her teeth rotten and black, with a dark substance dripping from the edges of her mouth. She opened her jaw wide open and shrilled. The camerawoman panicked, walked backwards and collided with an offscreen object. She tumbled backwards and the camera cut to black. For the first time in over a decade, that video gave me goosebumps.

‚ÄúDo you see it?‚Äù Agent McLaughlin said.

I nodded. ‚ÄúWhat does this have to do with anything? Did Mike put you up to this?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe video. It‚Äôs everywhere. Check your phone, turn on your TV. It‚Äôs there. It‚Äôs the only thing that‚Äôs there. Trust me.‚Äù Panic sweat across his face. I took a step back and gripped the door, ready to slam it in his face if need be. ‚ÄúGet your phone out, watch any random video. It‚Äôll be there too.‚Äù

‚ÄúI left my phone upstairs.‚Äù It wasn‚Äôt. It was in my pocket.

‚ÄúThen go get it. Watch a random video on it. YouTube, TikTok, something you recorded. Every fricking video has been replaced with it.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to have to ask you to leave or I‚Äôm going to call the cops. Even if you do work for the FBI, this is unprofessional behavior. Please leave.‚Äù I gripped the door harder.

‚ÄúPlease, Eleanor.‚Äù No longer panic on his face, but desperation. He began flipping through his phone. He tapped on something and pointed it towards me. The YouTube splash screen pointed at me. He then tapped the first video and opened it. The shaking camera began playing.

‚ÄúAfter I shut this door, you‚Äôll have five minutes to remove yourself from my property or I‚Äôm calling the cops. The real cops.‚Äù

‚ÄúEleanor, this is serious.‚Äù He took a step forward. ‚ÄúI can explain every-‚Äú

I slammed the door. His five minutes had just begun.

\*\*\*

I locked every lock on that door, including the second deadbolt, just above the first. It had no exterior keyhole, which made it great for shutting out the outside world. A lock I had never locked in my entire stay here because the property‚Äôs landlords, my parents, forbade it. They preferred I kept it unlocked in case of ‚Äúemergencies and surprise visits.‚Äù Thirty-three years old and they still treated me like the rebellious teen that they worked so hard and so futilely to reform. Legally, they had to keep that bolt installed, as long as they planned on continuing renting out this half of the property after I moved out.

The adrenaline ran its course and the lack of sleep caught up with me. I needed coffee. It took about five minutes for a half a pot of coffee to brew. Once it finished brewing, that alleged FBI agent‚Äôs time was up. I went to the kitchen, the tension in my muscles still lingering.

I flicked the coffee grinder on. The smell of ground coffee returned some sense of normality to this morning. I filled the pot with water, took a filter and dumped the pulverized beans into the top. I opened the cabinet above the coffee station, the first two rows filled with mugs. Too many mugs for a single woman living alone, some might say, but to them I said: there are never too many mugs for a single woman living alone. I picked my favorite mug. A commemorative mug decorated in the artwork by my favorite Japanese horror artist. On it, a collage of his most iconic art pieces: a woman smirking towards the camera while a grotesque copy of her face grew sideways out of her head. A man‚Äôs body contorted into a spiral of human flesh, another of a shark sitting on top of spider-like legs. I normally saved the mug for special occasions, but today I needed its comfort.

As the coffee brewed, my mind drifted back to that video. It made no sense why a strange man would show it to me like that. Mike must have found this ‚ÄúFBI Agent‚Äù to fuck with me. That video, something I had accidentally downloaded onto my computer and uploaded to my iPod Video so long ago had been the most important video in my life, much to my parent‚Äôs displeasure with having an embarrassment of a horror loving daughter ruin their picturesque ‚ÄúGood Christian Family‚Äù afterwards. At the time, I hadn‚Äôt known its origins, but now it‚Äôs been so regurgitated and recycled as a concept to a point of parody. It still stuck with me the way first impressions do.

It had to be Mike. Nothing else made sense. I unlocked my phone and shot him a text.

You did it. You made it fucking scary again. Now tell your friend to get off my porch. I sent. And then I followed up with. Still up for linner tonight?

It‚Äôd be a few hours before he‚Äôd text me. That man never woke up before two in the afternoon on most days. Which is why we always called it ‚Äúlinner.‚Äù His lunch, my dinner.

A few linners ago we talked horror movies, as usual, and the topic of our first true scary moments came up. I told him of my infamous moment with ‚Äúeagelton\_witch\_livingroom\_sc.wav,‚Äù and how that out of context clip kept me up for nights.

‚ÄúWait, the Eagleton Witch Project was your first real scare?‚Äù Mike said to me. His glass was half full and his burger was already gone despite it just having got there a few minutes ago.

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I said. Mike had potent feelings about the source material, so I knew exactly where Mike would go with this.

‚ÄúAmateur! Pop-culture loving amateur.‚Äù

‚ÄúAt least I wasn‚Äôt traumatized by a monster in a fucking children‚Äôs movie.‚Äù

‚ÄúLeave mecha-baby out of this. At least his appearance didn‚Äôt ruin horror films for a decade. Found footage was fine when it first started, but afterwards. Pfft.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, and it started with the Eagleton Witch Project. I think my first scare is legitimate.‚Äù

‚ÄúHave you seen the whole movie?‚Äù

I shook my head.

‚ÄúYou call yourself a horror fan and you haven‚Äôt watched the whole thing?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou bastard. First, you call me an amateur for watching it, and now you‚Äôre saying I‚Äôm not a real horror fan?‚Äù

Mike smirked, a shit-eating grin. I shook my head and laughed. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the worst.‚Äù

Our conversation drifted after that to one of Mike‚Äôs wild goose chases for lost and obscure horror media and alleged cursed videos he was looking for He rambled about his never-ending quest for Gyroscope, an alleged cursed video that he was dead set on finding. Nothing more than a dumb creepypasta. An urban legend. I didn‚Äôt believe it. Curses remained in horror movies. They‚Äôd never exist in a world as mundane as ours. Mike must have been trying to mess with me last night though by sending me a file called ‚ÄúGyroscope.mp4‚Äù just last night, which ended up being nothing more than a retitled ‚Äúeagelton\_witch\_livingroom\_sc.wav‚Äù

The coffee finished brewing, and I poured myself a cup. I walked over to the door and checked the peephole. ‚ÄúAgent‚Äù McLaughlin was not there. A small sense of relief washed over me.

I retreated to the living room and turned on the TV, opening up YouTube to decompress. Too tired to actually think, I turned on a lo-fi music station. Just something to have on the background while the coffee still worked on booting up my brain. When the video started, I had thought I had gone insane.

No peaceful animated video. No girl wearing pink headphones endlessly studying while her orange tabby sat on a windowsill looking at a picturesque European backdrop. Not even the chill lo-fi music played. Instead, a shaky handheld video. A panting unseen camerawoman. A turn of the corner. A static TV. A witch. A scream. The ‚Äúeagleton\_witch\_project\_livinginroom\_sc.wav‚Äù rendered in 4K.

Alright, no need to panic. I thought. My YouTube recommendations are littered with horror based content creators. Maybe I accidentally clicked on a video about it. I am sleep deprived after all. I let the video play out, seeing if it would cut to a YouTube talking head, but it didn‚Äôt. Nor did any narration played over the video, instead it repeated, again. And again. And again. Always starting with the panicked breathing and always ending with the witch screaming. What the hell?

I exited the video and opened a random one next to it titled The Ring is Genius And Here‚Äôs Why. I was just thinking about rewatching that movie. The algorithm knew me so well. The video loaded.

A white wall. Panicked breathing from an unseen camerawoman. The living room. A static TV. A witch. A scream. A white wall. Repeating, over and over again.

‚ÄúWhat the fuck?‚Äù I said.

I tried another video.

The same damn footage.

Mike, you had gone way too far with your pranks. But how? Unless he moonlighted as the best hacker on the planet, I had no idea how he pulled off such a thing.

I closed YouTube and opened Netflix. Before the featured content could finish loading, I clicked on the first suggestion. If I moved fast enough, I thought I could beat whatever had been injecting that video into my feed. The red loading icon hung on my screen for much longer than it should have.

Fifteen percent.

Forty-five.

Sixty.

Sixty-five.

Ninety.

Ninety-nine.

Ninety-nine.

Ninety-nine.

Play.

A white wall. Panicked breathing from an unseen camerawoman. The living room. A static TV. I turned the TV off. I had seen enough.

‚ÄúWhat the hell is happening?‚Äù I said.

I opened my phone and shot Mike another text. Alright, you really got me. Now please let me watch Netflix in peace!

Maybe this was Mike‚Äôs way of getting me to invest in physical media. After all, he can‚Äôt help to bring up his extensive collection whenever he gets the chance. A few weeks ago, he told me how he finally added a film projector to his collection. A freaking film projector. As if owning a Blu-Ray player, a DVD player, tape player (VHS and Betamax combo), and Laserdisc weren‚Äôt enough. Wait, physical media.

I had a few DVDs, but no DVD player, at least not plugged into my TV. I grabbed one from the self and walked up the narrow stairs to my bedroom to fetch my laptop. My laptop, at least, still had a disc drive.

I left the lights off, and blinds closed. Ignoring the clothes on the floor, I hurried to my desk. Opening the laptop, I popped the disc drive open. The email Mike sent me last night titled ‚ÄúI think I found it!‚Äù was still open, with Gyroscope.mp4 playing on VLC next to it, playing that same clip from the Eagleton Witch Project on repeat. I wondered now if it was some sort of virus that affected my entire network. I slid the DVD into the drive and popped it closed. The menu opened, and I hit play.

The same white wall with the shaking camera facing it, accompanied by the same panicked breathing.

Fucking Mike.

\*\*\*

Maybe he had given me a virus. Maybe Mike was up to no good. Maybe he had gotten into trouble with the law. Maybe that was why an FBI agent appeared on my doorstep this morning. Shit.

I shut my laptop and stood up.

Walking over to the door, I thought I saw something in the corner of my eye. A pale figure in the dark corner of the bedroom. I looked towards it, but saw nothing. I shook my head and groaned. This sleep deprivation was getting to me.

‚ÄúI need some fucking sleep,‚Äù I said. I walked out of the room and went downstairs and out the front door, hoping that the FBI agent hadn‚Äôt driven away already.

I stepped outside wearing nothing but sweats and a tank top. That had been a mistake. The cool autumn morning air wrapped itself around me, goosebumps formed, and I shivered. I considered going back in for my jacket, but I pushed those thoughts aside. I needed to find that socially awkward FBI agent before he left, if I hadn‚Äôt scared him off already with my threats of calling the police.

I scanned the curbside for an official vehicle or something. What even do FBI agents drive? I didn‚Äôt know what to look for other than something vaguely cop car looking with the letters ‚ÄúFBI‚Äù printed on the side. I skimmed the usual crowd of cars. An unwashed raised truck. My old Nissan Sentra that had lost all of its protective coating, rust patches formed on the blue paint like mold. A white van with ‚ÄúElmer‚Äôs Painting Service‚Äù that belonged to my duplex neighbor. Although I knew for sure that his name was not Elmer, it was Frank, because my parents always called ‚ÄúFrank‚Äù their favorite tenant. No cop car with FBI printed on the side. I sighed. I almost went inside when I heard a yapping dog.

I turned my attention to it. A woman in a puffy baby blue coat was walking a small dog down at the end of the block. The dog yapped at a squirrel across the street while the woman tried to calm it. The woman and dog were of no interest to me. What caught my eye was the foreign maroon Honda Odyssey parked next to them, still idling. I didn‚Äôt recognize the car. Desperate, I approached it.

The woman and dog had crossed the street by the time I had approached the van. The van hummed in the quiet morning. A white trail of exhaust flowed from the rear exhaust pipe, dissipating into the air. I approached the driver‚Äôs side window and looked in. Agent McLaughlin sat at the wheel, staring off into the distance. I knocked on the window. He jumped.

Once the look of panic subsided, he rolled down the window and looked at me with dry red eyes.

‚ÄúJust what the hell is going on?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs everywhere. Ever since I watched you-,‚Äù he paused, ‚ÄúI watched that video last night. It‚Äôs infected everywhere. Is it everywhere for you too?‚Äù

‚ÄúAt least everything in my house. YouTube, Netflix, my freaking DVDs.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, thank God I‚Äôm not going not going crazy,‚Äù he said with a sense of relief.

‚ÄúHow do you know about this? Is Mike on some sort of list? Am I on some sort of list?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a long story.‚Äù

‚ÄúSay it.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not going to like what you hear,‚Äù he shivered.

‚ÄúAgent McLaughlin, I need to know what exactly is going on and how I fit into this.‚Äù

He looked away and closed his eyes. He took a deep breath and held it before sighing.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs true that I work for the FBI. My job is very important. But I come here on personal business because nobody at the Bureau would believe what is happening to me.‚Äù He took another deep breath before continuing. ‚ÄúThis thing that seems to be afflicting both of us. I know nothing about it. I was hoping that you would have a better idea.‚Äù He opened his eyes and looked at me.

I shook my head in annoyance. What would I know about this? How would he even suspect me to know anything about this? What, was I mistakenly put on a short list of contact-in-case-of-cursed people?

‚ÄúDo you?‚Äù He said, as if he hadn‚Äôt seen me shake my head.

‚ÄúNo, I know nothing about anything going on right now. Why did you reach out to me?‚Äù

‚ÄúMy job.‚Äù he took another deep breath. ‚ÄúI am not a field agent. I‚Äôm just an office worker. A monitor. It‚Äôs my job to monitor the web traffic of certain people. After it started happening last night, shortly after you opened that attachment, I couldn‚Äôt see anything but the video. Everywhere, even on my phone. I thought I had infected the computer, but when I showed my coworkers they didn‚Äôt see what I saw. Not on my phone, not on my computer. I thought I was going crazy.‚Äù

‚ÄúWait. Did you say after you watched me open that attachment? What do you mean ‚Äòwatched me‚Äô?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe have a list of triggers that automatically flag people for our ‚ÄòJust Keeping Tabs‚Äô list. Most people on it are not involved in anything illicit or illegal, but when they are flagged, we assign an agent to monitor them for up to six months.‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you saying what I think you‚Äôre saying?‚Äù I took a step back.

He nodded.

‚ÄúNo way.‚Äù

The worse it is for them, the better yours will be.","A wizard appears and tells you there is going to be a zombie apocalypse. This is unavoidable. However, you have a chance to get to an ideal starting location - an isolated tropical island full of supplies and natural resources. 

In order to get to this safe haven paradise, you first have to play a game where you choose the worst possible starting position for your worst enemy. The worse it is, the better your starting position, and the absolute worst answer gets you to the island. 

For instance, if you said ""locked in a gas station bathroom"", then the wizard will take away points for the fact that your enemy is near food/supplies and fuel, as well as potentially vehicles, so you in turn would end up in a coffee shop bathroom, and not locked in. 

Rules:
1. Has to be on land
2. Has to be in a location where they won't die due to the environment (so no buried alive or in the piranha tank at an aquarium or the lion cage at the zoo)
3. It must be somewhere they have at least 1% chance of survival 
4. They can be trapped or locked in, like in my example, but there has to be a way for zombies to get to them.


My wife and I played this game and our answer was an MRI machine - trapped and your body is totally vulnerable and defenseless, and you have to rely on others to get you out.

1n6rwp2,https://www.reddit.com/r/UsedItRatedIt/comments/1n6rwp2/explore_if_the_best_wireless_earbuds_skullcandy/,Explore if the Best Wireless Earbuds Skullcandy Indy Are Worth It,"Skullcandy S2IYW-N740 has been a part of my daily routine for a while now, and these earbuds sit solidly in the category of high-quality audio gadgets. They promise features like Active Noise Cancellation, long battery life, and seamless Bluetooth connectivity, and I‚Äôve taken the time to see if they actually deliver on these claims. From commuting to working out, I‚Äôve tested these earbuds across multiple scenarios to get a full picture of their performance‚Äîand there‚Äôs a lot to unpack here.

**Design and Comfort**  
The design immediately jumped out at me as sleek and modern. The angled earpiece shape makes them ergonomic, and the three different ear gel sizes included ensure the perfect fit for any ear. I‚Äôve had plenty of earbuds slip out during workouts, but these stay snugly in place even while I‚Äôm jogging or doing burpees. The black casing may seem standard, but it pairs nicely with the overall aesthetics. At just 2.29 ounces, the lightweight design makes them incredibly easy to wear for hours without discomfort setting in‚Äîa big win in my book. 

[Check Skullcandy S2IYW-N740 price on Amazon.](https://beatpops.com/p/b08g211jlr/)

**Performance and Sound Quality**  
What stood out the most for me was the audio clarity. Whether it‚Äôs the deep bass in my Spotify playlist or the treble-heavy podcasts I tune into while cooking, these earbuds handle it beautifully. Skullcandy‚Äôs top-tier dynamic driver technology really enhances the sound quality. The Active Noise Cancellation feature works impressively well, drowning out the hum of my noisy surroundings, whether it‚Äôs a packed bus or a bustling coffee shop. The Personal Sound feature, which adjusts audio based on your hearing profile through the Skullcandy App, is a nice touch that adds customization. Despite the presence of advanced features, there were moments when I noticed a slight delay in ANC kicking in, especially during quick environmental shifts.

**Battery Life and Charging**  
A big reason I considered these earbuds was their promise of extended battery life. My tests revealed that Skullcandy‚Äôs claim holds relatively true. With ANC on, I got around 19 hours of battery life ‚Äî five hours from the earbuds and an additional 14 hours from the charging case. When I turned ANC off, the numbers jumped to nine hours on the earbuds and 23 from the case. The USB-C charging cable included in the box makes fast charging a reality, which is a lifesaver on busy days. However, the five-hour individual runtime with ANC on could be restrictive when I‚Äôm working or traveling long distances. 

**Build and Durability**  
I wasn‚Äôt kind to these earbuds‚Äîtaking them out in the rain and tossing them into gym bags‚Äîbut they stood the test. The water resistance is a noteworthy feature for someone like me who uses earbuds in all sorts of weather. The plastic build might sound flimsy, but Skullcandy has done a good job ensuring it feels solid. However, I did notice that smudges and minor scratches develop over time on the charging case, which takes away from the premium feel bit by bit.

**Strengths**  
- Active Noise Cancellation performs impressively in most situations.  
- Personal Sound customization through the app stands out as a unique feature.  
- Lightweight design ensures comfort even during extended wear.  
- Water-resistant build holds up well during workouts or rainy commutes.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- Scratches on the charging case reduce the premium feel over time.  
- The five-hour battery life with Active Noise Cancellation enabled might not suffice for everyone.  
- Noise-cancellation can lag slightly in environments with sudden noise level changes.

**Competitive Options**  
Compared to other earbuds in its range, like the Apple AirPods Pro and Sony WF-1000XM4, the Skullcandy Indy ANC fares reasonably well. While both competitors offer superior noise cancellation, the Skullcandy provides more bang for your buck thanks to its great sound quality and personalized features. Sony edges out with slightly better noise isolation and comfort, while Apple takes the crown in seamless device integration. That said, for those looking for solid performance at a fraction of the cost, these earbuds hold their ground effectively.

**Affordable Quality**  
The price point is where the Skullcandy S2IYW-N740 hits the sweet spot. It packs features that one would usually expect from pricier options, like dynamic audio drivers and noise cancellation. Though it may not boast the polish or brand prestige of its higher-priced rivals, the value it provides at its current pricing makes it a solid purchase for most users seeking advanced capabilities without breaking the bank.

# Introduction

While August is typically a quiet month with Congress out of session, there were several significant developments in energy and environmental policy. The Department of Energy (DOE) rolled out plans for over $1 billion in funding to boost US research, production, and processing of critical minerals and rare earth materials. On Capitol Hill, lawmakers are backing proposals in the defense bill to strengthen the critical minerals supply chain and reduce reliance on imports. At the same time, the Trump administration is stepping up its shift away from renewables ‚Äî canceling major solar and wind projects, tightening permit rules, and scrapping plans for offshore wind. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is also looking to undo the Greenhouse Gas Endangerment Finding, arguing that greenhouse gases don‚Äôt directly harm public health. And on the personnel front, there was a wave of activity before the Senate left town to confirm political appointments at EPA, DOE, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

# Critical Minerals and Rare Earth Material Funding Opportunities

Following last month‚Äôs¬†[announcement](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/4270722/office-of-strategic-capital-announces-first-loan-through-dod-agreement-with-mp/)¬†that the Department of Defense (DOD) was making a direct investment in rare earth mining and processing through MP Materials, DOE¬†[announced](https://www.energy.gov/articles/energy-department-announces-actions-secure-american-critical-minerals-and-materials-supply), on August 13, 2025, notices of intent (NOI) to issue four notice of funding opportunities (NOFO) across different offices ‚Äî totaling nearly $1 billion ‚Äî to advance and scale mining, processing, and manufacturing technologies across key stages of the critical minerals and rare earth materials supply chains. The NOIs, preceding the actual release of the NOFOs, indicated that they would use authorities provided by the Energy Act of 2020 and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) from the previous administration to move forward on the Trump administration‚Äôs objectives. Also in August, ARPA-E issued two additional NOFOs to secure the domestic critical mineral supply and strengthen magnet manufacturing. A full description of each pending and issued opportunity is provided below.

ML Strategies is well positioned to help you navigate critical mineral federal funding and other opportunities. Please don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out with questions.

* **Battery Materials Processing and Battery Manufacturing and Recycling Grant Program**¬† ¬†
   * The Office of Manufacturing and Energy Supply Chains (MESC) intends to issue¬†[a NOFO of up to $500 million](https://infrastructure-exchange.energy.gov/Default.aspx#FoaIdabf3f314-afb7-4c92-ab43-b8d9040ae49e)¬†to expand US critical mineral and materials processing and derivative battery manufacturing and recycling. The proposed funding opportunity supports demonstration and/or commercial facilities processing, recycling, or utilizing for manufacturing critical materials, which may include traditional battery minerals such as lithium, graphite, nickel, copper, aluminum, as well as other minerals that are contained within commercially available batteries, such as rare earth elements. An award requires a cost-share of at least 50% by the recipient.¬† ¬†
* **Critical Minerals and Materials Accelerator**¬† ¬†
   * The Advanced Materials and Manufacturing Technologies Office expects to release¬†[a NOFO of up to $50 million](https://www.energy.gov/eere/ammto/critical-minerals-and-materials-accelerator-0)¬†early this fall through the Critical Minerals and Materials (CMM) Accelerator program. The CMM Accelerator promotes technology maturation that can unlock capital investments and facilitate domestic commercialization. The proposed NOFO addresses several areas of interest, including processes in the rare earth magnet supply chain; processes to refine and alloy gallium, gallium nitride, germanium, and silicon carbide for use in semiconductors; cost-competitive technologies for direct lithium extraction and separation; and critical-material separation technologies that allow for the coproduction of useful products from byproducts and scrap.¬† ¬†
* **Mines & Metals Capacity Expansion ‚Äî Piloting Byproduct Critical Minerals and Materials Recovery at Domestic Industrial Facilities**¬† ¬†
   * The Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management intends to issue¬†[a NOFO](https://www.energy.gov/fecm/notice-intent-mines-metals-capacity-expansion-piloting-product-critical-minerals-and-materials)¬†to support approximately $250 million of financial assistance for American industrial facilities that have the potential to produce valuable mineral byproducts from existing industrial processes. To derisk the technical uncertainty and financial risk for commercial deployment, many technologies must be piloted at an industrial scale in an industrial facility where material feedstocks can be processed. Areas of interest include mines and metal pilots in the coal-based industry and other industries.¬† ¬†
* **Rare Earth Elements Demonstration Facility**¬† ¬†
   * MESC intends to issue¬†[a NOFO of up to $135 million](https://infrastructure-exchange.energy.gov/Default.aspx#FoaIdf5f8dd91-451d-4f99-84c2-c070d1828fba)¬†for the design, construction, and operation of a Rare Earth Element Demonstration Facility. This facility will demonstrate the extraction, separation, and refinement of REEs from unconventional feedstock sources to produce high-purity rare earth metals. The facility must source feedstock derived from acid mine drainage, mine waste, e-waste, or other deleterious or harmful materials resulting from mining or industrial operations. An academic partner is required as a part of the project team and an award requires a cost-share of at least 50% by the recipient.¬† ¬†
* **MAGNITO Program**¬† ¬†
   * ARPA-E released a¬†[NOFO](https://arpa-e-foa.energy.gov/#FoaIda9f6c0f8-cc97-4b18-b98d-684f180efaea)¬†making up to $20 million available for projects to employ artificial intelligence, machine learning, and high-throughput experimentation to develop novel magnetic materials with new chemistries and microstructures. The Magnetic Acceleration Generating New Innovations and Tactical Outcomes (MAGNITO) program anticipates successful applicants will comprise teams with various expertise, such as computational materials discovery, solid state chemistry, magnetism physics and computational methods, magnetic measurement and interpretation of data, and potential applications of ultra-powerful magnets. Concept papers are due September 24, 2025. The full application submission deadline has yet to be announced.¬† ¬†
* **ROCKS Program**¬† ¬†
   * ARPA-E released a¬†[NOFO](https://arpa-e-foa.energy.gov/Default.aspx#FoaId7bd314a9-95ec-42c7-98aa-c64030d67a23)¬†making up to $40 million available to develop fundamentally disruptive technologies to transform the ore deposit characterization process. The program will pursue technology that targets order-of-magnitude improvements in characterization with a primary focus on drilling, sensing, and analysis to shorten the timeline for feasibility assessments of REE and critical mineral deposits. Technologies of interest are grouped into three main categories: (1) drilling technology to increase penetration rates and core recovery; (2) sensing and analysis technologies to provide higher-resolution mineralogical and geochemical information, in situ or at a distance; and (3) other unique concepts that disrupt the current state of resource characterization for hard rock settings as well as REE-enriched clays, placer deposits, and seafloor resources. Concept papers are due September 25, 2025. The full application submission deadline has yet to be announced.
* **Critical Minerals and Rare Earths Within the FY26 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA)**

Separate from the DOE program activities on critical minerals and rare earth materials, both the House and Senate budget markups appear to provide several funding and programmatic amendments that could further support these priorities.

The Senate is scheduled to consider the¬†[FY26 National Defense Authorization Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/senate-bill/2296)¬†(NDAA) on September 2, 2025, with several amendments focused on critical minerals under consideration. These proposals emphasize expanding domestic production and investment to strengthen the defense industrial base, securing supply chains, and requiring congressional reporting on critical mineral and rare earth element resources.

Notably, Senator Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.) has introduced amendment¬†[SA 3392](https://www.congress.gov/amendment/119th-congress/senate-amendment/3392/text?s=a&r=375), which directs the president to use a portion of Defense Production Act funds to bolster US supply chains for critical minerals and their derivative products. The amendment calls for investments that expand domestic production in line with President Trump‚Äôs¬†[Executive Order 14241](https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2025-05212.pdf?1742820318)¬†and complement existing efforts under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. The measure defines critical minerals broadly to include those listed in the Energy Act of 2020, as well as uranium, copper, potash, gold, and others designated by the president. It also clarifies that derivative products range from semi-finished goods like semiconductor wafers, anodes, and cathodes, to final products such as electric vehicle batteries, smartphones, microprocessors, wind turbines, and advanced optical devices. In doing so, the amendment seeks to support the entire critical mineral supply chain, from raw material processing to advanced technology manufacturing.

On the House¬†[side](https://armedservices.house.gov/calendar/eventsingle.aspx?EventID=6222), lawmakers are also prioritizing resilient critical mineral supply chains and expanded US refining and processing capacity. Interestingly, Rep. Jill Tokuda (D-Hawaii) has introduced an¬†[amendment](https://armedservices.house.gov/uploadedfiles/0_-_chm_en_bloc.pdf#page=76)¬†highlighting Australia‚Äôs significant deposits of rare earths and other critical minerals, along with its mining and processing expertise. Her proposal directs the Secretary of Defense, in coordination with the Secretary of State, to report to the congressional defense committees by February 1, 2026 on potential approaches to expand the AUKUS partnership to include the development and guarantee of critical mineral supplies. The House is expected to consider the FY26 NDAA at a later date.

Once the two chambers vote on their respective versions of the NDAA, the chambers will enter a conference period to reconcile the two versions. The final version of the NDAA typically passes in December.

# Agencies Ramp Up Targeting Renewables

* **EPA Cancels Solar for All Program:**¬†EPA is planning to cancel the $7 billion Solar for All program, part of the $27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, which funds solar projects in low-income communities across the country.
* **Interior Mandates Considering a Proposed Project‚Äôs Energy Density When Issuing a Permit:**¬†The Department of the Interior issued a¬†[Secretary‚Äôs Order](https://www.doi.gov/document-library/secretary-order/so-3438-managing-federal-energy-resources-and-protecting)¬†mandating that the agency ‚Äúpermit only energy projects that are the most appropriate use of the federal land and resources.‚Äù The order takes direct aim at wind and solar projects, arguing that they take up ‚Äúdisproportionate‚Äù amounts of federal land compared to nuclear, gas, and coal projects with similar generation capacity.
* **BOEM Rescinds Offshore Renewable Energy Leasing Schedule:**¬†The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) intends to publish¬†[a direct final rule](https://subscriber.politicopro.com/f/?id=00000198-759f-dd72-a79f-ffdf12130000)¬†to rescind a section of the department‚Äôs regulations that calls for publishing a schedule every two years of anticipated offshore renewable energy lease sales. The move comes after BOEM also formally rescinded all areas in the US Outer Continental Shelf for offshore wind development.
* **Interior Cancels Lava Ridge Wind Project:**¬†Interior Secretary Burgum reversed the Biden administration‚Äôs approval of the Lava Ridge Wind Project, a wind facility in southern Idaho, after ‚Äúcrucial legal deficiencies in the issuance of the approval‚Äù were discovered.
* **New IRS IRA Tax Credit Guidance:**¬†The IRS recently released new guidance on compliance for the Inflation Reduction Act tax credit for Sections 48E and 45Y, restricting qualification with a ‚ÄúPhysical Work Test‚Äù and Continuity Requirements under the accelerated termination schedule set by the OBBB passed in July.¬†

# Strategic Alignment Table

|DOE Funding Focus|Niocorp Relevance|
|:-|:-|
|Rare earth magnet supply chain (secondary sources)|Elk Creek REE capability (Nd/Pr/Dy/Tb)|
|Sc-Al alloy pilot & vertical integration|Active pilot-scale development of master alloys|
|Co-production of multiple critical materials|Polymetallic project (Nb, Sc, Ti, REEs)|
|Tech acceleration to unlock private financing|DPA + EXIM financing path already in motion|

# Strategic Takeaway

This DOE NOI is more than a funding announcement‚Äî**it‚Äôs a strategic validation of Niocorp‚Äôs unique trajectory**. If they apply and position correctly, they could pull in federal support not just for resource extraction, but **for their metallurgical and downstream ambitions**. That amplifies their positioning with DoD, EXIM, and EDF-level financiers.



# üîë DOE FOA (Funding Opportunity Announcement) Timing

* **NOI issued Aug 13, 2025.**
* The actual **NOFO (funding application)** usually drops **4‚Äì8 weeks later** ‚Üí likely **Sep‚ÄìOct 2025**.
* Application windows are typically **60‚Äì90 days**, meaning proposals due **late 2025 (Nov‚ÄìDec)**.
* Awards could be announced **early‚Äìmid 2026**, depending on DOE review cycles.

# üèó Niocorp‚Äôs Project Timing

* **DFS Update expected Q4 2025 (Oct‚ÄìNov)** ‚Üí this gives DOE evaluators fresh, bankable numbers.
* **FID (Final Investment Decision)** hinges on EXIM or other project financing ‚Üí possibly **H1 2026**, if DFS + offtakes align.
* **Construction start** would likely be late 2026, but pilot/research tie-ins could run in parallel.

# ‚öñÔ∏è Strategic Fit with DOE AMMTO FOA

* **Scandium-Aluminum Vertical Integration:** ‚úÖ Fits **Area of Interest 4** (value-added byproducts + alloys) since Sc is a rare co-product, and Al-Sc alloys are directly defense/aerospace relevant. ‚úÖ Also fits DOE‚Äôs ‚Äúcritical manufacturing materials‚Äù mandate ‚Üí high-impact in **lightweighting, fuel savings, electrification**.
* **Magnet Recycling Pilot (Nd, Pr, Dy, Tb loopback):** ‚úÖ Fits **Area of Interest 1** (rare earth magnet supply chain from secondary sources). ‚úÖ Niocorp has already flagged recycling as a potential bolt-on ‚Üí this FOA could literally de-risk that pilot before FID.
* **Titanium / TiCl‚ÇÑ Co-Production:** ‚öñÔ∏è Not directly called out, but would qualify under **AOI-4** as a ‚Äúco-production‚Äù pathway to improve economics.

# üìä Where This Fits Between DFS & EXIM

* DOE FOA awards could realistically **arrive before or around EXIM FID**.
* Even **a pending application** strengthens Niocorp‚Äôs case in DFS/EXIM filings:
   * Shows federal engagement.
   * De-risks the ‚Äúpilot/demo‚Äù phase for Sc-Al alloys & magnet recycling.
   * Signals U.S. government alignment (DoD + DOE double-coverage).

1n6ruov,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1n6ruov/explore_if_the_hamilton_beach_flexbrew_coffee/,Explore if the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew Coffee Maker Lives Up to Reviews,"Testing out the Hamilton Beach E4HB49976 FlexBrew 2-Way Brewer has been quite the adventure in my kitchen escapades. Honestly, as someone who doesn‚Äôt like to choose between single-serve coffee or brewing a whole pot for guests, this machine promised to solve my dilemmas and then some. Designed as a flexible, programmable coffee maker, it has become a staple in my morning routine‚Äîthough not without some quirks.

**Smart Design for Avid Coffee Drinkers**  
The dual functionality of this coffee maker immediately caught my attention. Switching between the carafe brewing side and the single-serve option is seamless, thanks to the dual reservoirs and easy-view water windows. The layout is intuitive with well-marked settings, making it pretty easy to get started. I found the modern black design sleek and not intrusive on my counter space; it fits comfortably without overshadowing other appliances. However, I‚Äôd be lying if I said cleaning those water reservoirs is the most enjoyable chore‚Äîyou'll need to reach some tight spots. That said, its overall design is practical and caters to kitchen multitaskers.

**Custom Brewing Settings to Satisfy Any Coffee Mood**  
This coffee maker doesn‚Äôt just brew coffee‚Äîit tailors the coffee experience to your preference. Whether you're in the mood for a bold brew or something regular, the settings allow you to tweak the strength to your liking. I've tested both the single-serve brewer (compatible with pods or ground coffee) and the full carafe, and each mode delivers consistent results. I did a comparison where I brewed 10 oz in single-serve mode using a pre-packaged pod and then brewed 14 oz with fresh grounds, and the taste consistency was surprisingly similar! The programmable timer on the carafe side has made my mornings smoother‚Äîit‚Äôs great waking up to freshly prepared coffee.  

[Check Hamilton Beach E4HB49976 price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b07fzjfy9n/)

**Dependability and Build Quality**  
The build feels decent for its price range. At nearly 12 pounds, it‚Äôs not flimsy but certainly isn‚Äôt what I‚Äôd call a heavy-duty build. Buttons and mechanisms generally feel reliable, though I noticed slight stiffness with the single pod holder. It‚Äôs not a dealbreaker, but it‚Äôs something to be mindful of with daily wear and tear. A small bonus is the storage area inside the cup rest for the single-serve holder or brew basket‚Äîit‚Äôs not revolutionary but helps keep the workspace tidy.

**Positives**  
- Customizable strength settings to suit different tastes  
- Dual brewing modes provide flexibility for households with varying coffee preferences  
- Programmable timer and automatic shut-off add convenience  
- Space-saving design despite its dual functions  

**Flaws**  
- Slightly tricky to clean water reservoirs  
- Single pod holder feels a tad stiff after frequent use  
- Requires some trial and error to master both brewing settings for perfection  

**How It Stacks Up Against the Competition**  
Compared to other drip coffee machines I‚Äôve used, this one‚Äôs biggest strength is its dual brewing modes. While standard coffee makers like the Cuisinart DCC-3200 are competent, they don‚Äôt offer the single-serve brewing flexibility unless you invest in separate pods. On the other side, pod-exclusive brewers like Keurig may work faster but lack the capacity for brewing full carafes, which is essential for family breakfasts. This product strikes a solid middle ground. Its programmability gives it an edge over simpler, more traditional machines in terms of usability.

**Financial Value**  
This model offers excellent price-to-quality ratio when factoring in its dual-mode brewing, programmability, and sturdy construction. While premium competitors like the Breville Bambino or Technivorm Moccamaster may offer gourmet-level coffee or ultra-durable builds, the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew truly wins for those who want flexible brewing options at a fraction of the price. It feels like a worthy investment for home brewers looking to upgrade without overcommitting financially.

- - -

After boxing, life had taken on a diminishing rhythm for Rex Rosado. His hands healed, but not fully, and when it was cold, they hurt along the fracture lines. He took to wearing gloves. His former promoter had made sure no one in the boxing business would hire him, which deprived him of the easiest transition to his new, ordinary existence. Money was tight. Friends were none. There was only Baldie, but the promoter's wrath had extended to Baldie too, and although the old man never said it, maintaining always that he'd *wanted* to retire (‚ÄúLook at me, Rex. You were my last, remaining charge. I don't wanna take no young gun under my wing. I'm seventy-one years old. The only thing under these wings is arthritis.‚Äù) Rex knew that wasn't true. Even more than for himself, he knew that for Baldie, boxing was life.

‚ÄúYou say that so I don't feel guilty,‚Äù Rex said.

‚ÄúBullshit. I say it ‚Äòcause it's true.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo what are you going to do‚Äîhow are you going to make money, spend your time?‚Äù

‚ÄúI got savings. Old world mentality: etched into me like words on a headstone. Plus, I always wanted to read more. Now I got the chance.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. Just got a new kind of cereal from the grocery store the other day. *Cunt Chocula,* it's called. The box ain't gonna read itself!‚Äù

And both men laughed.

Rex visited Baldie nearly every day. He also looked for work, sometimes got some, tried it and ended up unemployed again, like the time he got hired as a mover but ended up letting an antique piano slide‚Äîcracking‚Äîdown the stairs. It hadn't been his fault. Because he was a big, strong guy, the two guys moving the piano with him decided he could hold it up all by himself. He couldn't, and so the new boss yelled at him and used several weeks of Rex's wages to make the broken antique piano's owners‚Äô whole. ‚ÄúWhat about me, who's going to make me whole!‚Äù

‚ÄúGet out before I call the fucking police.‚Äù

Back on the street, Rex punched a brick wall until it hurt: both the wall and him. He couldn't make a fist or move most of his fingers for a week after, which Baldie laughed about when Rex told him. They both laughed.

He kept dropping his toothbrush, which was funny because he couldn't afford to keep squeezing out new toothpaste. Sometimes he couldn't even afford a cup of coffee, so he'd heat up an empty mug and hold it because it eased the feeling in his hands.

‚ÄúShoulda punched the piano!‚Äù Baldie said once between deep bursts of guffawing.

‚ÄúKnow what‚ÄîI love you, Baldie.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, I love you too. Now let's forget about it and have another drink.‚Äù

But Baldie didn't take his drinks as well as he used to. They made his face red and his heart race, and sometimes they made him lose feeling in his legs.

‚ÄúYou should see a doctor,‚Äù Rex told him.

‚ÄúI see ‚Äòem just fine.‚Äù

A few days later Baldie collapsed on the floor of his apartment. Rex found him that way after knocking, getting no answer and kicking in the door (much to the annoyance of Baldie's neighbours, who complained about the noise and how, now, the ratboys would get inside and start squatting) to the sight of his only friend barely breathing, smelling of booze. Rex called an ambulance and two sarcastic paramedics carried Baldie inside on a stretcher and drove him to the hospital while talking about something called a 544.

The setting of Rex's visits with Baldie became a hospital room after that, one Baldie shared with a sickly war veteran who never spoke.

‚ÄúWhen are you going to check out of here?‚Äù Rex asked. ‚ÄúI hate how fucking sanitized it is, and the beep-beep-beep of the heart monitor. I don't know how you stand it.‚Äù

‚ÄúSoon, Rosie. Soon.‚Äù

But the doctors kept extending Baldie's stay. There was always something else wrong with him, or if not wrong, something to monitor. If you weren't sick you always had the potential. That's what was wrong with hospitals, thought Rex. They tie you up against the ropes and there's no ref to break you up, so you stay like that all the way till the final bell.

In the hospital, Baldie gained a kind of placidity he'd never had before, a calmness. Rex didn't like it. This wasn't the Baldie he knew.

After a while, it became an unspoken fact shared by the two of them that Baldie was never getting discharged from the hospital. Rex took to spending more time in the room with Baldie, and Baldie spent more of that time sleeping, his hairy chest rising and falling like hypnosis.

When he woke up, sometimes he'd yell at Rex. ‚ÄúGet the fuck out of here! Go live your life, Rosie!‚Äù Other times he'd smile, rearrange himself on the bed and go back to sleep. The rotation of nurses kept him nourished on pills of all different colours. They hooked up a hose to his cock so he could piss without getting up. *But where was the count?* They washed him with sponges like he was a used car they planned on selling. ‚ÄúWhat, jealous that I got a woman to clean me?‚Äù

‚ÄúSure, Baldie.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou should hit on ‚Äòem. They make good dough. Some are from Arkansas.‚Äù

Then Rex got evicted for non-payment of rent. He didn't tell Baldie, but visiting him in the hospital became a way of having a warm, safe place for the night. Overnight visits were against hospital rules, but these rules were bendable if you were persistent and growled. Nobody wanted to enforce them then. They'd escort out the crying wives but leave Rex alone, because the wives were easy to deal with. ‚ÄúAre you his next of kin?‚Äù a nurse asked him.

‚ÄúSomething like that.‚Äù

It was on one of those nights when Rex was homeless and Baldie asleep, snoring‚Äîthat Baldie woke up, his eyes sharp, mind agitated, and  said: ‚ÄúPromise me you'll get back up, Rosie. Promise me. Promise me!‚Äù

‚ÄúOK, I promise. Now keep it down, will you? Some of us are trying to sleep here.‚Äù He started to laugh, but Baldie didn't join him. ‚ÄúAnd you promise me the same. I've been thinking about what we can do once you get out here, and‚Ä¶‚Äù

Baldie had fallen back asleep.

Rex took the old man's hand in his, squeezed. ‚ÄúWhen you do get out of here, we'll go visit your daughter out in Lost Angeles, OK?‚Äù

‚ÄúShe don't love me. She don't wanna see me,‚Äù Baldie whispered.

‚ÄúFuck *her* and what *she* wants. The question is: do *you* wanna see her? You got a right to.‚Äù

Baldie was asleep again.

Again, Rex squeezed his hand. ‚ÄúHey! Hey, Baldie. What do we say to Father Time?‚Äù No response. *Beep-beep-beep.* ‚ÄúCome on: what do we say to Father Time, Baldie?‚Äù *Beep-beep-beep*. Rex got up, but when he did, Baldie's hand dropped limp from his grasp. ***Beeeeeeep.***

They kicked him out of the hospital after that, but he got a few good punches in before they managed it. Yeah, he gave it to a few of them good before they tossed him out on the pavement. And when the cop asked him if he was fine to get on home, ‚ÄúSure,‚Äù Rex barked. ‚ÄúI'll get on home.‚Äù

*But where is that?* ‚ÄúWhere *is* home, Baldie?‚Äù

Baldie didn't respond.

‚ÄúI thought that maybe, once you kicked the can, you'd come back as my angel or something,‚Äù said Rex, as the few people on the streets at this hour avoided him. ‚ÄúI heard of that happening: people coming back, as voices, you know? Maybe you're not ready yet. Of course you wouldn't be. You just made it over to the other side. Tell me when you're ready. Tell me and I'll be here.‚Äù

He sat where he was, under the halo of a street lamp.

‚ÄúI'll wait.‚Äù

But it was chill and the night sky started to rain, so Rex got up and started walking again. Restless, he walked alone, turned down a narrow cobblestoned street, and turned up his collar at the cold and damp, until his eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light‚Äîit had split the night: some advertisement atop the Rooklyn Bridge.

And after the thunder had rolled, Rex was left walking in the sound of silence.

But he had a direction now.

Yes, that was why Baldie wasn't responding. He was waiting. Waiting for Rex to join him.

As he neared the bridge, Rex felt a clarity he hadn't felt since his fateful night in the ring. It was beautiful in its engineered, stone and metal splendour. (The bridge) And in its finality. (The clarity.) Sometimes the towel needs to get thrown. Sometimes the opponent is too much. He leaned over the railing and watched the river waters go by, black and unreflective of the stars above, but who was to say it wasn't the river that was above and the sky below, its stars not looking down but up, drowning.

The light was naked and he was within it.

He had boxed sometimes to crowds of thousands‚Äîcheering, yelling, booing, screaming. Now he saw another crowd around him. ‚ÄúHe's gonna do it,‚Äù somebody said. ‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù ‚ÄúCome on, do it.‚Äù ‚ÄúJump!‚Äù ‚ÄúDo it, do it, do it.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat are you waiting for?‚Äù ‚ÄúBe a man.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhatever you feel, it's not gonna get any better. Trust me.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe water doesn't hurt.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou're already gone.‚Äù ‚ÄúWho even are you?‚Äù ‚ÄúGo down *and stay down*. Fifth round. Got it, Rosado?‚Äù ‚ÄúYeah, I got it.‚Äù ‚ÄúAny last words, buddy?‚Äù ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù ‚ÄúJump already! I gotta get home to my kids.‚Äù ‚ÄúHe ain't legit‚Äîhe's a faker.‚Äù ‚ÄúHe's doing it for sympathy.‚Äù ‚ÄúNo sympathy from me. We all got problems.‚Äù

But the more they spoke, the greater their silence. *The rushing, churning water.* He began to climb over‚Äî

‚ÄúHey!‚Äù

‚Äîwhen:

‚ÄúBaldie?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat? No. Get down from there.‚Äù

The crowd became immediately extinguished and the light was again clothed in the ordinary uniform of existence, and the only two living people on the bridge (I say living, for there were ghosts there) were Rex and the girl. Her hair, dark. Her body, frail and wasplike.

‚ÄúYou think I haven't been in that same spot, thinking the same thing?‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, who the fuck are you?‚Äù

‚ÄúI'm a boxer,‚Äù said Rex.

‚ÄúAnd I'm the girl who dared disturb the sound of silence,‚Äù said the girl who dared disturb the sound of silence. ‚ÄúBut you can call me Mona.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy‚Äîthe rest of them‚Äîdid you‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúThe rest of who? There's no one else here. I don't blame them either. The weather's nasty. Listen,‚Äù she said, showing her hands and softly approaching Rex, who had taken a few steps back from the railing, ‚ÄúI don't know you or your circumstances, so I'm not going to feed you the line about how it's all going to get better. Maybe it will, maybe not. Nobody knows. Maybe it'll get worse. The thing is, if it doesn't get better, you can always come back here tomorrow.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don't have anywhere else to go,‚Äù said Rex.

‚ÄúAnd I don't have anywhere else to be, but what I do have is a place nearby that has a couch where you can crash till the morning. Might be a bit small for a big guy like you, but I'm sure you can bend your knees.‚Äù

Rex shook his head. ‚ÄúYou're just going to invite a strange man into your home. That doesn't  make sense. Shouldn't you be afraid?‚Äù

‚ÄúShouldn't you?‚Äù

According to ChatGpt, some scented candles have heavier, richer scent molecules that evaporate more slowly. As such, these scented candles usually hold their fragrance well for 18‚Äì24 months or more:
1. Warm & spicy notes: vanilla, cinnamon, clove, amber, sandalwood.
2. Woody scents: cedarwood, patchouli, oud, teakwood.

Ive done hours of reading, adjusted the grind until I choke the machine, bought a darker roast, do one blank pre-shot to heat up the gruppe, and am out of ideas. I simply cannot get the thick, rich, syrupy, nutty, chocolatey espresso at home that I get from cafes.

Example, yesterday I was just at a cafe that roasts their own beans and loved their espresso so much that I bought a bag of beans roasted last week. In fact, I didnt even buy the one I drank (their Medium/Light Roast). I went for their ""Dark Roast"" which they told me is more like a traditional store bought Medium Roast.

I get home, I do a blank pre-shot to warm up the Bambino Plus. I set the grind to one notch above choking the Bambino.

Lo and Behold, it doesnt taste like at the cafe and is sour again! Is there a chance my refurbished Bambino Plus isnt hitting high enough temp properly, or something along those lines that I should look into? The only other thing Im doing is not measuring how many grams of ground coffee Im putting in the basket (no scale), could too little cause sourness?",1,1756837436.0,espresso,12,0.67,False

Laundry day in my household is no joke. With a busy schedule, sensitive skin relatives, and a constant mission to sift through mountains of clothes, I had to test The Clean People Laundry Detergent Pods to see how they held up. These pods promised to be eco-friendly, hypoallergenic, and ultra-concentrated, so naturally, I was intrigued.  

**Design and Packaging**  
The first thing I noticed was the packaging. Unlike bulky plastic containers or wasteful bags, these pods came in brilliant recyclable, zero-waste packaging. It seemed simple yet effective, something I felt good about stashing in my laundry room. The pods themselves are compact and don't scream innovation at first glance, but it's their eco-friendliness that had me excited. My kids even commented on it, asking why ‚Äúlaundry soap had gone tiny.‚Äù

[Discover if The Clean People Laundry Detergent Pods are on sale at Amazon.](https://alluringdeals.com/p/b099hfzp8y/)  

**Gentle on Skin**  
Having family members with particularly sensitive skin meant I could put these laundry pods through a bit of a challenge. After multiple uses, there were no signs of irritation, no itchiness, and, most importantly, no odd fragrances lingering around. These pods live up to their hypoallergenic claim by omitting ingredients like phosphates and parabens, a big plus for anyone with similar concerns. It‚Äôs such a relief when something works well and doesn‚Äôt come with unwanted side effects.  

**Efficient Cleaning Power**  
Despite being free of phosphates and artificial dyes, the cleaning ability is remarkable. Stains, whether it‚Äôs coffee spills or arts-and-craft disasters courtesy of my kids, were mostly lifted without a trace. The lack of synthetic chemicals didn‚Äôt affect performance; if anything, it made me appreciate the power of these natural ingredients more. I tried them on delicates and tougher fabrics, and surprisingly, no complaints‚Äîa rare feat in a house with messy toddlers and adventurous weekend outings.  

**Benefits**  
- Compact, plastic-free packaging that cuts down on waste  
- Hypoallergenic formula, ideal for sensitive skin  
- Surprisingly effective stain-lifting performance on most fabrics  

**Potential Downsides**  
- Wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs highly effective on extremely stubborn, old stains without pre-soaking  
- Pods may occasionally stick together in humid environments, making them a bit tricky to separate  

**Fragrance and Freshness**  
The light fresh scent these pods offer is just enough to make your clothes smell clean without any overpowering artificial fragrance. It's subtle, which is rare compared to conventional laundry detergents that often border on being overwhelming. For families like mine, who prefer a more natural feel, this factor was a welcome change.  

**Ease of Use**  
I was skeptical about whether one pod could tackle a full load, but it did. Tossing one of these into the washing machine is as simple as it gets, no measuring or spillage involved. For larger loads or heavily soiled clothes, using two pods yields better results. It‚Äôs convenient and keeps messes in the laundry room to a minimum. My teenager even started ‚Äúhelping‚Äù with laundry ‚Äì a rare phenomenon ‚Äì because they claimed it‚Äôs ‚Äútoo easy to mess up.‚Äù  

**Other Options**  
When compared to competitors like EcoVibe laundry strips or Seventh Generation detergent packs, The Clean People pods hold their ground. Both EcoVibe and Seventh Generation products focus on eco-friendliness, but I found these pods to have a slight edge in terms of their gentle formula paired with robust stain-fighting. However, the pods fell a little short with tougher stains when directly compared to some synthetic-heavy options, though I‚Äôd happily trade off those chemicals for peace of mind.  

**Price to Quality Ratio**  
Without delving into exact cost, the price of The Clean People Laundry Detergent Pods seems to fall in line with what you‚Äôd expect from premium sustainable products. These pods are a classic case of paying a bit more upfront but receiving excellent quality in return. Factor in the recyclable packaging, the hypoallergenic formulation, and the overall cleaning power, and the cost feels justified. Those seeking the best of affordability may want to double-check competing options, but for me, the eco-friendly commitment made it worthwhile.

I (F23) am in my last semester of college. Originally, I was supposed to graduate in May 2025 but my advisor told me I didn't have enough credits (after 5 years of school) to do so. This tagged on two more semesters. After this happened, I noticed a pattern in my life. Whenever I feel I am about to move onto the ""next step"" in my life, something holds me back. I feel like I'm stuck in a neverending circle and it's killing me.

I feel excited that I'm finally graduating in just 15 more weeks, but I am unhappy with my career options. I am a computer science major and there are some companies who are already willing to hire me, but I despise the work. My boyfriend and I are planning on getting married soon, and we've discussed me keeping my current job at a small town coffee shop (my dream job that I love so much) while he works full time. But trying to afford a wedding, a house, a car, and all the other adult stuff on the money we would be making scares me. I feel like I have no other choice but to work a job that already causes me a lot of stress (I'm interning at a local cyber company, and I hate it). My real biggest goal in life is to be a wife and a mother. And somehow, even though we are planning to get married soon, I have this extreme anxiety that he will up and decide he doesn't want me anymore even though he's never given me a reason to feel that way.

Basically, I feel like I have no real choices in life and that I'm woefully behind all my peers. My friends who are my age are married with children, and I can't seem to relate to them at all. I'm almost 24 years old and I don't have much to show for it. It's sad because I really want to enjoy my life, but I can't get over this awful feeling that I'll always be stuck here. I've struggled with depression and anxiety for most of my adult life, and I've been better since I've gone to therapy for a few months this year, but I can't seem to get over this. It's getting worse as I get older, too.

Anyways, I just needed to vent. Everyone tells me things will turn out ok in the end, and I think I believe that. I just don't know how to deal with the anxiety.

First job made me work 4 days and then ""let me go"" because management changed and didn't want any new workers

Second job was the 24/7 shop that made coffee, burgers, cigarettes, crepes, sandwiches etc, so without experience I had to learn eeeeeeverything from scratch.

August comes by and boss tells me that I have to fill night shift (we had discussed whether I'm open to it and I wanted to try it, but after I learn how to work properly) because the other girl just didn't come in one night

So! After a full month there, working 5 days a week, I can say that it has the highest and the lowest. I am still trying to find my sleep schedule, and this week I have been sleeping horribly (started turning on DND because I can't take it anymore), coffee is my new best friend despite not really wanting to, forgetting to shut one shutter ruins my sleep, so yeah

It's not really peaceful either, because I'll always be doing something, whether that's doing crepes for customers, preparing the breakfast meals on the furnace (Balkan core), preparing sandwiches, cleaning up everything; so the 8 hours are a long stretch 

One of these days I'll be paid though, and since I worked on national holidays (mid August is the celebration of Jesus' Mother) so that's the only thing keeping me sane

I tried going out and every single time my body gave out and never woke up to leave the house (either sleeping 4 hours or straight up 10-11 with no way to predict it cause I'm always tired after shift) 

I can see why it has long term effects on the body and mind, after one month I've become a bit more aggressive and prone to anger to seemingly insignificant things, constantly tired and trying to fix a sleep schedule that doesn't want to stay that way

Today, I went to the store with \~$18 USD, looking to get some snacks for the house **and cat food** (this is important). 

While I was browsing for snacks, I found some iced coffee cans, the usual Starbucks that I love, and they were on sale for 2 for $7, which is a pretty good bargain considering how much they cost normally. I put them in my basket and then added up everything I had already and found out that I wouldn't have enough for cat food if I got the coffees, which kinda bummed me out a bit.

For a solid 3 minutes (I spend a lot of time making decisions and weighing consequences), I debated **not** getting the cat food. It IS important to note here though that we would be fine for the moment without it, it was mostly for the cats we feed outside so that we know they're not going hungry.

In the end, I put the coffees back and grabbed some cat food, and went on my merry way. 

Secondly, I got home, and I had gotten some candy (Reese's Sticks (really good btw absolutely recommend)) for me and my brother to share (he was at school at the time this happened so he didn't know). I ate my two and again, I found myself considering just eating the rest of them and not telling him about them. The thought confused me as to where it came from as I don't normally think like this. 

Again, I chose (what I think was) the right thing and set them on the kitchen table for him to have when he got home. So this leads me to my question: why does it take so much willpower to be selfless and so little to be selfish? It would've been so easy for me to just get the coffees or eat the other two Reese's sticks, and it took some willpower for me to NOT do it. I don't understand, I'm not super knowledgeable about human nature and etc. so I wanted to ask here, a safe place for these kinds of questions.

I used to spend $4‚Äì6 every morning without thinking about it, and switching to making coffee at home felt almost too simple at first. But when I added up how much I was saving each month, it honestly shocked me. Now I‚Äôve gotten used to it, and it doesn‚Äôt even feel like a sacrifice. That one tiny change easily saves me hundreds each year. What other small shifts have made a big difference for you?",202,1756837107.0,Frugal,157,0.9,False
1n6r61z,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthMomentum/comments/1n6r61z/does_vitalitown_probiotics_for_women_deliver/,Does Vitalitown Probiotics for Women Deliver Results Worth the Hype Review?,"The Vitalitown Vitalitown Probiotic caught my eye due to its impressive feature list, promising a healthier gut and enhanced overall well-being. As someone with a busy lifestyle and a diet that's not always the best, I decided to test it out myself. This probiotic arrives in a compact, lightweight bottle (2.15 x 2.15 x 3.75 inches) packed with 30 capsules. I've used probiotics before, but this one intrigued me because of its powerful 120 Billion CFUs and 30 unique strains per capsule, which is a lot compared to what I‚Äôve tried in the past. My initial thoughts leaned toward excitement with a hint of skepticism‚Äîdelivering results that match this level of hype is a tall order.

**Packaging and Design**  
The bottle design is convenient and travel-friendly. During the first week, I kept this bottle in my bag while bouncing between work and errands. The sturdy moisture-tight bottle impressed me, maintaining the integrity of the capsules even in shifting environments. Transparency in labeling was another feature I appreciated. Every key ingredient and function are listed, which gave me confidence in exactly what I was putting into my body. It‚Äôs nice when a brand doesn‚Äôt play hide-and-seek with information.

**Highlights**  
- Delivers 120 Billion CFUs per capsule, which is notably higher than many other options out there.  
- Incorporates 30 strains and a mix of prebiotics, digestive enzymes, and organic cranberry extract.  
- Compact and moisture-tight bottle makes it easy to use and store.  

**Effectiveness in Daily Life**  
To determine how effective these probiotics are, I swapped out my morning coffee routine with these capsules. Within just a couple of days, I noticed a gentle shift in digestion. The organic cranberry component also stood out; unlike other cranberry-based supplements that either taste terrible or are overloaded with sugar, this one avoided those pitfalls entirely. After a week of use, I didn‚Äôt experience the unwelcome bloating I often face after meals. Additionally, my energy levels felt more stable‚Äîsomething I attribute to improved nutrient absorption, one of the product‚Äôs touted benefits.

Still, results didn‚Äôt show overnight. Patience was essential. Some coworkers using similar probiotics from other brands shared they often require two to three weeks to display noticeable outcomes. From what I‚Äôve seen so far, Vitalitown stands out for its targeted effectiveness on both digestive and vaginal health‚Äîtwo areas where probiotics often fall short. 

**Upsides**  
- Vegan, non-GMO, gluten, and allergen-free, which makes it suitable for a wide range of dietary restrictions.  
- Shelf-stable formula eliminates the need for constant refrigeration, though refrigeration can extend freshness.  
- Made in the USA with third-party testing‚ÄØfor purity ensures safety and quality.

**Adverse Aspects**  
I wish I could say everything about this product is perfect, but that wouldn‚Äôt be entirely honest. During my testing phase, I came across a couple of hurdles that are worth mentioning:  

- While shelf-stable, those living in high-humidity areas might still need refrigeration to maintain product potency.  
- The capsules are on the larger side. If you struggle with swallowing pills, this is something you should consider.  

While these shortcomings aren‚Äôt deal-breakers, they might matter to some users, especially those new to probiotics or with specific preferences.

**Industry Competitors**  
After using the Vitalitown Probiotic, I dug into what makes it distinct from other probiotic brands I‚Äôve dabbled with. For instance, Garden of Life offers an excellent women‚Äôs-specific probiotic, but its CFUs per capsule hover between 40‚Äì50 billion‚Äîfar less potent than Vitalitown's. On the other hand, Renew Life has options with comparable potency but often lacks the comprehensive blend of prebiotics and digestive enzymes found here. The inclusion of organic cranberry extract is especially unique‚Äîit‚Äôs something I couldn‚Äôt find with many direct competitors. While it‚Äôs possible to stack supplements to hit the same benefits seen here, Vitalitown bundles everything into one, saving money and shelf space.

**Budget-Friendly Option**  
When weighing the cost against other similar products, I‚Äôd say it lands firmly in the ‚Äúsmart spending‚Äù category. You‚Äôre not only paying for the CFUs but also the additional powerful elements like cranberry, prebiotics, and digestive enzymes. It strikes a balance between affordability and high-quality ingredients, which can sometimes feel mutually exclusive in this market. While individual probiotic formulas with fewer CFUs may come at slightly lower price points, the comprehensive benefits you receive here give you a bang for your buck.

We have his daughter (7F) every weekend, and over the last few months I expressed how the workload was unsustainable for me (we both work Mon-Fri, and I do the bulk of cooking, cleaning, and lots of play on the weekend). He has since started to help a little with cleaning and encouraging more independent play (she would not play independently at all until about 3 weeks ago).

Despite the fact that there‚Äôs two rooms, his daughter doesn‚Äôt have a designated room here. They have always just co-slept and shared that room. I am uncomfortable co-sleeping with them, so I am told to move into the spare room on the weekends. I expressed last weekend that this upset me, and I wish we addressed it before I moved in, because it‚Äôs upsetting me greatly. he just kind of held me but offered no solution or change; he is quite clearly immovable on this. 

Every long weekend, BM calls last minute and says he needs to keep daughter for the extra day. I expressed last long weekend that I was looking forward to one full day off with him, no kids no work. I was so excited for this last weekend because it was a long weekend where we are. Cue Saturday night, BM calls and says she has work and no sitter, and he needs to keep daughter all day Monday. 

I was upset; obviously there‚Äôs nothing he can do, but I wish he would‚Äôve said something comforting or kind. He was basically like tough. He gets very defensive these days; as if I don‚Äôt understand his daughter is his priority. I completely understand, I want that, and honestly on weekends his daughter is my priority too. But Mon-Fri he is drained and the only energy I get is a movie at home. I‚Äôve expressed I want more but when the time comes he just seems too tired to even ask to go out to dinner or a movie or something. He doesn‚Äôt cook, so when he provides meals is McDonalds or Popeyes.

I feel like no one is putting in a proper effort to take care of me; but I‚Äôm putting in effort and finances to take care of everyone else. And when I get stressed for the weekend, because I get moved into another room and all affection completely stops for the weekend, he kind of acts like I‚Äôm against his kid. I love her so much. I‚Äôm against feeling like there‚Äôs not room for care for both of us; when I care so much for both of them. He‚Äôs even taken to kind of making these grand statements when we‚Äôre both around about where he‚Äôll go ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs the prettiest here? Of course you are.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs my favorite thing here? Of course you are.‚Äù And like‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know, it feels weird? And rude? Like of course I know that, I am so sure she knows that, but for some reason he feels the need to rub my nose in it. It doesn‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôs for her benefit, it feels like it‚Äôs to put me in my place.. 

I‚Äôm tired. I‚Äôm sad. There‚Äôs nothing romantic anymore really. He is so kind to me through the week but idk if kind is enough anymore? I want help, I want someone to make me coffee half as much as I make them a tea. 

But maybe I AM just not understanding what it‚Äôs like to be a parent? Maybe there just actually isn‚Äôt room for a relationship on the weekends?? I don‚Äôt need much but I need at least something more than he tacks on a coffee to their McDonalds order and kind of touches my foot to his when watching a movie, for maybe two minutes before she sees and gets jealous. I want a timeframe as to when we can sleep in the same bed on the weekend.

I‚Äôm so tired

Today has been a very strange day to say the least, I made an alt because all my promotional stuff is on my main üòÇ however! Today has been a weird

I have quite a lot of subscribers on my general social media and OF too and of course my messages are full of DMs and weirdos, I have a social media manager so I thankfully don‚Äôt have to deal with most of them (thank god for her) but about a few months ago when she was doing the usual reply to messages spiel she saw a guy there who was honestly just really sad

I‚Äôm 24 and this guy is 35 and his DMs were just so sad, he complained about his ex-wife and that she was very toxic, how she took his kids, how he‚Äôd been depressed ever since, how looking at my pictures was the light of his every day, how he was so s**cidal and just a lot of seriously sad thing

It‚Äôs not the first time I‚Äôve had someone weird and sad in my DMs but these messages honestly just hurt my heart so I started dming him actually as me and we spoke for a while it was more friendly than anything but it was strange

He‚Äôd been asking me for a while if we could meet up and I constantly brushed it off and this morning he offered again and I was like‚Ä¶why not? I brought a friend in case he was a genuine creep we all met at a coffee shop and he was actually really friendly. He was a surprisingly good looking man although clearly very weathered down by just life 

We spoke for a while until he asked if I wanted to go to his apartment with him and now that I think about It I was probably too trusting üòÇ but I went

When we got there he gave me cash and just asked if we could sit on his couch and cuddle, we spent the entire of today just together on his couch watching my favorite movies that he wanted me to show him, he didn‚Äôt try anything which I was very surprised about and it was honestly a really nice time

He cooked dinner for both of us and we ate and he explained to me a lot about his past abusive relationship and how he missed his kids and how he was being hardcore parentally isolated and it was really really damn sad 

After dinner i helped him do his dishes and we both tidied up his place a little and when i left he was absolutely bawling and i gave him a big hug before i went 

It felt like kind of eye opening in a way, I never really think of my subscribers as like‚Ä¶actual people they‚Äôre always just kinda gooners to me (üòÇ) but a lot of them really are just guys who‚Äôre struggling, I haven‚Äôt told anyone yet aside from my friend who came with and I just felt like telling it to the void ",0,1756836824.0,self,16,0.46,False
