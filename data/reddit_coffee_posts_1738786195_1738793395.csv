This seems to be a common myth? that is self reported by patients taking the medicine quite often. 

The thing is, when you actually take a look at newer literature on this subject, most of it seems to suggest that if anything, Bupropion *helps* with anxiety and carries no higher risk of increasing it than SSRIs do.

What has your clinical experience shown? Do you think that patients who experience anxiety taking it are more often than not combining it with other substances (weed, coffee, alcohol, etc.)?",1,1738793274.0,Psychiatry,0,1.0,False

The weight gain and missed periods made me suspect PCOS so I got a hormone panel done and it showed no imbalances, but I had elevated TSH (5) and high LDL cholesterol. Did a thyroid panel after that and found normal T4 and no hashis antibodies (they didn't test T3). My doctor said a tsh of 5 was a normal fluctuation but after looking into it a little more and considering how much my health had nosedived in the past couple years I decided to push a little harder and convinced him to let me try out levo at a 25mcg dose.

I wasn't really expecting anything to change because it's the starting dose and I was told you shouldn't notice anything until week 6 or so, but 2 weeks in I felt a noticeable boost in energy and the GI problems are totally gone which is amazing!! Before this I always felt like there was a solid boulder in my stomach and food was as appealing as cardboard, I finally understand how people can actually eat 3 times in 1 day. No more constant queasiness and reflux either. Only thing is it's working a little TOO well and I've been wired everyday until 5-6 am feeling like I've had several cups of coffee. This has persisted the whole week. I do manage to stay asleep once I knock out thankfully, but I feel alert and hyper as soon as I wake up regardless of how little sleep I got. I tried cutting out caffeine and still felt hopped up, melatonin and magnesium don't do a thing either. No heart palpitations or anything thankfully, just anxious and jumpy like I feel when I take stimulant meds for ADHD (which I ironically stopped around when my symptoms got worse because they stopped giving me energy!).

So far it's bearable (I WFH so I can sleep in thank god) but it sounds like I shouldn't be getting these kind of effects this early on, I'm wondering if these went away for anyone or if I'm overmedicated? From reading other accounts it doesn't seem like I should be feeling anything from this dose this early on, but it's beyond what I'd chalk up to placebo. Since my TSH was already borderline and the doctor was skeptical about giving me the levo for it I'm paranoid that I didn't need to treat it after all and this is making me hyperthyroid. It's such a relief having a functional amount of energy and not being tortured by my gut all day so it'd kinda suck if how I felt pre-levo is my baseline and nothing's wrong with my thyroid.",1,1738793234.0,Hypothyroidism,0,1.0,False

Yes. I could measure it out, but I have a variety of cups. I have several kinds I use just for water pr juice. Sometimes I use mugs for coffee or tea, and I have a variety of mugs that are just fun and I like them.

(Fit/active mums),"Hi mummies, I want to run an idea by you and I’d love your feedback if you have a baby under 1. A little about me:  I’m a first time mum and also an expat mum (Brit) who’s been in NZ for a few months. I’m very active and I miss being able to work out due to my husband working full time and not having childcare in case for my 5 month old. I know there’s many mums in the same position! 

I’ve come from Dubai where there was soo many things on for mums which combine fitness with social events. I know there are clubs here already that allow mums bring their babies to the occasional class, (no need to comment a list of these as I’m aware of what they are), but what I’m finding is that the studios that offer this only offer this alongside an expensive membership or the clubs that are on offer are focused more on the baby then the mum (there also so many clubs and playgroups for older babies, but not for babies under 1). 

How does a club sound which really hones in on the mum rather than the baby, with the option to bring your baby (babies who aren’t yet mobile)  to do the classes such as yoga and Pilates? Aswell as there being social elements such as brunches (Dubai element!), coffee meet ups? 

As mums we just don’t have the time to do this and I think there’s a huge gap in the market for it.

All I want to know, is whether you think there needs to be something that offers this? 

As I say, I know this isn’t a NEW idea, and I’m aware of the clubs there are already, but for me they’re just fitting the bill for what I want. If you have any tips for how to make this happen let me know, as I already have contacts, I just need to know whether it’s a viable idea. Thanks! ",0,1738793035.0,newzealand,0,0.5,False

Hi there,

I recently read that student with Asperger’s quite often develop their very own learning methods and I recently discussed mine with my bf, so I thought I might as well describe it here. Am I the only one using this? No idea. Do I get incredulous looks when describing it? For sure. Could it help somebody else? Who knows.

So here we go: I developed my method when I was 16. By that time I had already understood that it is incredibly hard if not impossible to gather large learning groups AND learn in peace. So I decided to create „mental learning groups.“ That is: You pick a subject you have to learn for. Then you choose people who in your mind are going to read to you. Example: „Learning theories concerning young kids? Oh that’s a topic for my kindergarten and primary school mates!“ Then you place them alphabetically. You wanna make sure you don’t miss out on anyone? Create excel spreadsheets!

The advantage: YOU get to decide everything! Who’s showing up, who’s sitting next to whom, what people wear, where you learn, when you learn, when there’s gonna be a coffee or toilet break… EVERYTHING! A learning pattern could look like this: So what historical event did happen in 1492 again? Alright, that was what Lisa was reading when she was wearing that renaissance costume and sitting next to Martin… Right, it was Columbus discovering America!

The obvious disadvantage: This only works in subjects with looot‘s of theory! For anything practical you’ll have to come up with something else. 

Oh and do not mix up mental meetings with physical ones. No mental meeting in the world can replace a physical one!

1iilxxo,https://www.reddit.com/r/BarndosAndCabins/comments/1iilxxo/cool_barndominiums/,Cool Barndominiums,"The Rise of Cool Barndominiums: Why They're Trending in Today's Housing Market
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There’s something undeniably appealing about barndominiums. These unique structures, which combine the features of a barn and a condominium, are becoming increasingly prominent in today’s housing market. Whether you’re looking to build your dream home or simply find a stylish getaway, cool barndominiums offer a blend of rustic charm and modern amenities that draw many homebuyers in.

One reason why barndominiums are trending is their versatility. They come in various shapes and sizes, allowing for an incredible range of designs. You can customize them to fit your personal style and needs, whether you want a quaint weekend retreat or a full-time residence. The open floor plan typical of a barndominium provides a spacious atmosphere that appeals to many. Here, you can have large living areas, spacious kitchens, and multiple bedrooms without feeling cramped.

Let’s explore a few key factors driving the popularity of cool barndominiums:

- **Cost-Effectiveness:** Building a barndominium is often much cheaper than traditional housing. The materials used can be less expensive, and the construction time is quicker. This makes them an attractive option for young families and first-time homebuyers.
- **Energy Efficiency:** Many barndominiums are built with energy-efficient materials. Their design often includes high ceilings and large windows that allow for natural light and ventilation. This means lower utility costs over time, saving you money on your monthly bills.
- **Open Concept Living:** Cool barndominiums typically feature open floor plans. This means you’ll enjoy spacious living areas, perfect for entertaining family and friends. With fewer walls, you can create a warm, inviting atmosphere that feels like home.
- **Unique Aesthetic:** The combination of metal and wood creates a unique look that stands out in any neighborhood. Many people love the rustic charm of barndominiums, along with the ability to incorporate modern design elements. Whether you prefer a contemporary style or a more classic ranch feel, the customization options are endless.
- **Connection to Nature:** Situated often in rural areas, barndominiums allow you to enjoy natural surroundings. Imagine waking up to the sound of birds or taking a stroll through beautiful landscapes right outside your door. This connection to nature is often sought after by those looking to escape the hustle and bustle of city life.
 
Moreover, barndominiums can serve multiple purposes. Many homeowners opt to include large garages, workshops, or even rental units within their designs. This versatility allows you to maximize your space, making them perfect not just as homes but also as functional multi-use properties.

Another aspect contributing to their popularity is the rise of DIY culture. Many people find joy in personalizing their living spaces. With barndominiums, the opportunities for DIY projects are vast. You can take on renovations, choose your finishes, and create interior designs that reflect who you are. This hands-on approach makes the process of building and living in a barndominium even more rewarding.

The appeal of barndominiums extends to lifestyle changes as well. As remote work becomes more common, many individuals and families are searching for homes that offer space and flexibility. A barndominium can provide that ideal environment, featuring home offices and leisure spaces that cater to your changing needs.

Let's not overlook the community aspect of barndominiums. Living in a rural area or a barndominium community fosters a true sense of connection among neighbors. Whether you're organizing a barbecue, sharing gardening tips, or simply spending time outdoors, these homes create an inviting atmosphere that promotes relationships.

The rising trend of cool barndominiums highlights a shift in what homebuyers seek today. With cost-effectiveness, versatility, unique aesthetics, and a deeper connection to nature, it’s clear why these structures are capturing the hearts of many. If you’re considering entering the housing market or looking for a unique living experience, a cool barndominium may be your perfect fit.

Designing Your Dream Space: How to Personalize Your Barndominium for Unique Living
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Creating your dream space is an exciting adventure, especially when it comes to designing a barndominium. These unique homes blend rustic charm with modern convenience, making them a perfect choice for those looking to personalize their living environment. With the right design ideas and a vision, your barndominium can reflect your personality and lifestyle beautifully. Here’s how to infuse your unique style into this innovative living space.

### Embrace Open Spaces

One of the most captivating features of a barndominium is its open floor plan. This layout fosters a feeling of spaciousness and freedom. To make the most of this design:

- **Choose a Neutral Base:** Start with neutral colors for walls and large furniture. This will create a calm atmosphere.
- **Use Multi-Functional Furniture:** Opt for pieces that can serve dual purposes, such as a coffee table that doubles as storage.
- **Incorporate Natural Light:** Large windows allow natural light to fill your space. Consider adding skylights for extra brightness.

### Add Rustic Elements

By blending modern aesthetics with rustic elements, you can create a unique charm. Think about incorporating the following:

- **Wood Beams:** Exposed wood beams can enhance the rustic feel and add character to high ceilings.
- **Metal Accents:** Use metal fixtures or furniture to add an industrial touch, creating contrast with the warm wood.
- **Reclaimed Materials:** Consider using reclaimed wood and metal for flooring or wall accents to enhance the unique story of your barndominium.

### Personalize with Color and Decor

Your barndominium should showcase your interests and passions. Here are ways to add personal touches:

- **Bold Accent Walls:** Choose a fun color for an accent wall that resonates with your style, whether it's a deep navy or a vibrant hue.
- **Artwork and Photography:** Showcase personal art or family photos to create a gallery wall that tells your story.
- **Textiles and Rugs:** Select throw pillows, blankets, and rugs that tie in with your color scheme while adding warmth and texture.

### Focus on the Kitchen

The kitchen is often the heart of a barndominium. To make it special:

- **Custom Cabinets:** Choose cabinet designs that reflect your style, whether sleek modern or classic rustic.
- **Functional Island:** Creating an island can provide additional workspace and seating, making it a social hub.
- **Unique Backsplash:** Incorporate a colorful or patterned backsplash to make a statement.

### Create Cozy Outdoor Spaces

Don’t forget to design your outdoor areas. Your barndominium's surroundings can greatly enhance your living experience. Consider:

- **Covered Porches:** A large porch with comfortable seating can create a great spot for morning coffee.
- **Fire Pits:** An outdoor fire pit can serve as a gathering spot for friends and family.
- **Gardens and Landscaping:** Incorporate gardens that reflect your taste. Native plants and flowers can be both beautiful and low-maintenance.

### Incorporate Technology

Modernizing your barndominium doesn’t mean sacrificing style. Use technology to enhance comfort:

- **Smart Home Devices:** Integrate smart thermostats, lights, and security systems for convenience.
- **Wireless Entertainment:** Set up sound systems and smart TVs that blend seamlessly with your decor.
- **Energy Efficiency:** Look into solar panels or energy-efficient appliances to save on utility costs.

Designing your barndominium is a deeply personal journey that allows you to create a unique living space. By thoughtfully incorporating your style through color, texture, and functional design, you can transform a simple structure into a cozy, inviting home. Embrace the process and let your creativity shine as you design your dream space.

### Conclusion

The trend of cool barndominiums reflects a shift in what many people seek in their living spaces. These unique homes offer a blend of rustic charm and modern conveniences that capture the imagination of potential homeowners. With their open floor plans, expansive ceilings, and use of sustainable materials, barndominiums are not just a trend—they're a lifestyle.

When it comes to personalizing your barndominium, the possibilities are endless. You can create a cozy retreat or a vibrant family gathering space by choosing elements that truly reflect who you are. Think about incorporating elements like large windows for natural light, custom cabinetry, or community spaces that invite friends and family. Adding personal touches such as artwork, color schemes, and landscaping can further transform a barndominium into your dream home.

As you explore this exciting housing option, remember that the key to making your barndominium truly ""cool"" lies in your creativity and imagination. With thoughtful design choices and a focus on what matters to you, your barndominium can become a unique sanctuary that evolves with your needs and lifestyle. Embrace the journey of building your dream space, and you'll discover that a barndominium is not just a home—it's a reflection of who you are. As this trend continues to grow, it holds the promise of offering countless individuals a chance to live in homes that genuinely express their individuality and style.",1,1738792230.0,BarndosAndCabins,0,1.0,False

Father in law issues,"Hi community, last weekend my in laws visited me and my husband and two young kids. My FIL has always misplaced and lost things since I started dating my husband 13 years ago, but this weekend, something really disturbing happened (trigger warning). When my MIL and FIL arrived to our house (which is brand new, just built it and moved in last month), My FIL told us his stomach was off from drinking 3 cups of coffee that morning. Ok fine whatever I thought, but then a day later he started having chills and stayed in bed all day. He kept saying it was the coffee even though you don’t get chills from coffee. Then on Sunday, he got out of bed that morning and went to the bathroom. My MIL then joined us in the kitchen/ living area. FIL was gone for 30 minutes so she went to check on him in our master suite. He was still in the bathroom and the shower was running and he flooded the entire bathroom and our bedroom. My husband ran in there and so did I once he was in a towel and he said “oh I must have not been paying attention”. Yeah no shit! How did he not notice?! FIL did not try to help (he goes on jogs and does exercises so he is able-bodied), just proceeded to get dressed and then went on his phone. While my husband was cleaning the water in the bedroom, he smelled a very foul odor. My husband pulled up the sheet on the bed and there was a huge pile of diarrhea. FIL was standing there doing nothing and did not address this with my husband. My husband then exclaimed “Dad! What happened?!” And he responded “oh yeah I had an accident” and like brushed it off?! He didn’t apologize or help clean it up. He made my husband and MIL clean up everything. He just went into the dining room and read newspapers for the rest of the day- barely engaging with any of us.  I was horrified. My husband is horrified. Is this normal?! Surely not, right? He did not seem embarrassed or apologetic or even address he must be very ill. 

Anyways, they left yesterday and now my poor husband has a severe stomach flu. 

My husband is afraid of humiliating his dad and will not address this with his parents. So asking you all a) what do you think of this behavior and is is dementia? (He’s 79) and b) what should I do/ my husband do? MIL is more with it but I think in denial her husband has issues. 
Feeling stuck….and grossed out. And sad.

I used to use SoHo House (Little House Mayfair) but then I moved to a city that didn’t have a SoHo House and was traveling less to London so I let the membership go. 

Now I’m heading to London next week for a series of business casual meetings (some coffee, some lunch, some drinks/dinner in the evening). 

We’ll either use The Booking Office at St. Pancras or The American Bar at the Savoy for the drinks/dinner meetings, but looking for a cool place (with seating and restrooms) for the morning and afternoon meets that’ll let us park ourselves there for a few hours. Should have ample seating, an upscale vibe, and also not be too loud.

Hi there,

I recently read that student with Asperger’s quite often develop their very own learning methods and I recently discussed mine with my bf, so I thought I might as well describe it here. Am I the only one using this? No idea. Do I get incredulous looks when describing it? For sure. Could it help somebody else? Who knows.

So here we go: I developed my method when I was 16. By that time I had already understood that it is incredibly hard if not impossible to gather large learning groups AND learn in peace. So I decided to create „mental learning groups.“ That is: You pick a subject you have to learn for. Then you choose people who in your mind are going to read to you. Example: „Learning theories concerning young kids? Oh that’s a topic for my kindergarten and primary school mates!“ Then you place them alphabetically. You wanna make sure you don’t miss out on anyone? Create excel spreadsheets!

The advantage: YOU get to decide everything! Who’s showing up, who’s sitting next to whom, what people wear, where you learn, when you learn, when there’s gonna be a coffee or toilet break… EVERYTHING! A learning pattern could look like this: So what historical event did happen in 1492 again? Alright, that was what Lisa was reading when she was wearing that renaissance costume and sitting next to Martin… Right, it was Columbus discovering America!

The obvious disadvantage: This only works in subjects with looot‘s of theory! For anything practical you’ll have to come up with something else. 

Oh and do not mix up mental meetings with physical ones. No mental meeting in the world can replace a physical one!

Now from the past 7-8 months it's been very irregular. Like first month delay of 15 days, doctor did a pregnancy test and then gave me cyclonorm p and e.

The next few months I did weight training and got on time period. Then again after leaving gym one month delay. Doctor did the same. Then a month on time, and now this time again it's been one month delayed. 

I am so scared. I'm gaining so much weight. I was already a bit overweight but now I can't even look myself in the mirror. I was trying on some clothes for my bday and I broke down. I don't wanna say this but my body looks so ugly. 

My partner(bf, we aren't married and it's a long way) and I meet only once in two months due to ldr and we are really afraid to have sex as it may affect my cycle or anything. I don't wanna be anxious all the time due to this. 

This time I did home pregnancy test 3 times it's all negative. I'm worried if I'm in the PCOS club and what should I do next.
I wanna have my periods and get over with it. I've tried everything drinking lots of coffee, home remedies, papaya and all. 

How can I have periods as soon as possible and further can I get back to my normal cycle by just improving my lifestyle and exercise as it is the beginning or do I have to show the doctor (I'm afraid of that 😭)

We really hit it off and we've been talking and texting as if we were boyfriend and girlfriend. He expressed multiple times how much he likes me and all. Anyways it's been 2.5 months now since we started talking and I'm getting a little frustrated. The only thing we have done is kiss which I'm not too worried about that but we haven't even gone on a date or hung out at all outside of work. I confronted him about it a few times and he says he just has a lot going on right now which I totally get that too. His parents are elderly and not too healthy so he helps them a lot and on top of that he has a teenage son. So I do understand he has a lot. Knowing this l've told him that I absolutely don't want to take away from anything that he needs to do but I really don't mind coming by later at night or cooking him some dinner and taking something off of his plate to make his day a little easier. I like this man a lot and I'm completely ok with working around his busy schedule because my schedule really isn't as busy at all. Anyways he completely refuses though and just constantly says he has a lot right now. He says that he likes me a lot and likes it when I'm around and hopes we can date officially sometime in the future when he isn't as busy. I just need some advice at this point. Why won't he let me work into his schedule. There's no way he doesn't have an hour here or there to watch a movie with me or maybe get a coffee or something. I'm really not asking for much here. I would just really love to see him outside of work What can I do to get him to want me as much as I want him??,1,1738792003.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

Im a 42 yr old F. Im 5'2 160 pounds. I am overweight, but am active and work out reguler. I try to eat fairly healthy, but im not perfect. I have some bloating, but always thought it was due to NOT having a Gallbladder as mine was removed at age 10 years old. 

 in 2022 I had elevated liver enzymes. However, I was taking OTC Antihistamines (Benadryl) and believed that to be the culprit. I stopped taking the benadryl (Enzymes decreased) , and received a sonogram which was normal. I did not know that zzzquill had antihistamines in them and soon after this incident starting taking zzzquil to sleep. I have high anxiety so rest and sleeping has always been an issue.  My yearly appt in 2023 was the same thing my enzymes were elevated. I stopped taking the zzzquil, however, my family doc sent me out to get another sonogram.   However, this time the sonogram came back that I had portal hypertension. I was then referred to a gastro doc. 

The gastro doc sent me out for an MRI and more blood work. The MRI came back normal. The previous sonogram was incorrect. I did not have portal hypertension. They also redid my blood work which my enzymes had decreased yet again after stopping OTC ZZZquil. The Doc said, he would recheck me in 6 months but the elevated enzymes could be a liver injury from taking OTC benadryl and zzzquil.  But he was not sure. He told me to live my life, but lose weight. I finally got on medication for untreated anxiety and ADHD. I was hoping I could level out enough that I would also lose some weight. 

My psychiatrist wrote me Hydroxyzine to help with anxiety and sleep. I asked if it could cause elevated liver enzymes and she did not think so. She thought OTC Antihistamines are harsh on the body whereas this drug is not. When I went back to the gastro doc my enzymes were high. I thought it was the hydroxyzine. But the doc thought it to be very unlikely.  at this point he tested for everything. All my tests came back normal. He tested for autoimmune issues, genetic problems, clotting issues. 

 I got more bloodwork and this time my bile acids, and bilirubin were elevated  which has never occurred before along with my ALT, AST and ALP.  This was also the first time that my enzymes were high without taking any antihistimes. However, I was just getting over a virus and took Methylpredisone. While having this virus, or cold was the very first time I felt any symptoms. The itchiness only lasted a day or two and went away. I don't know if being sick contributed to the elevations and never got to talk to the dr. The office called me a few days later to schedule a liver biopsy.  

  
I do take medications that I have been on for years, and I asked my doc if he thought this could be medication related, he would never say. I also have taken 1 5hr energy shot every day for 15 years. I don't like coffee and i found the energy drink to be a safe alternative.  However, the energy shot did start to upset my stomach. I asked the nurse practitioner could the energy shot cause elevations in enzymes because of the vit B and Niacin. She was not sure, and I never discussed with with them again but I did stop taking them and now drink 1 cup of black coffee a day.  

I got the biopsy done and it came back normal. I have an appt this Friday with the gastro doc and i'm not sure what he is going to say. Is the elevation in enzymes due to something im taking or are we going to have to do more tests. Im hopeful it was possibly the antihistamines, along with the 5 hr energy shots. But that seems so unlikely.  I just cant continue to be left in the dark when it comes to my health. I ask questions and i get tired of hearing I don't know, or not ever getting a response.

I'm new to the area of LA and prefer meeting people in the LGBTQ community. I usually feel safer around gay men so I will admit I had my guard down just a bit. I am bi myself and just enjoy having gay guy besties. He had very feminine energy, especially his voice. 

Anyways, we decided to go meet in person for the first time and get a coffee while we ran a few errands. We shared stories about previous partners of the same sex and he made it known he was not into women. I yapped about my ex that I am still absolutely in love with. After we ran a few errands we hung out in his car in a Target parking lot and chatted/ listened to music. However as he was talking, I started to notice a few discrepancies in information he has said before. I tested him and mentioned the state he told me he grew up in and he then corrected me telling me it was a completely different place. After that and a few other things I got a pit in my stomach that told me to get out of the situation. I asked him to take me home and that's when things started to get weird. 

He said let's stay a little longer and began reaching into my shirt. I was completely thrown off but told him no and to get his hands off. He kept grabbing at me then started to push down on my chest. Things were moving really quickly and the pressure he was putting on my chest made me lose my breath. I was about to push him off and cuss him out when he put his hand around my neck and began choking me. It wasn't a light choke but the kind where I started fearing for my life. 

He moved his hand over my heart and suddenly his feminine voice had vanished and he asked me in a deep voice: ""are you nervous"". The look on his face was so sinister. Although I absolutely was, I told him no and he seemed disappointed. That's when I threatened him and told him that if he's going to try and take me out he better do it because I can handle myself and will defend myself no matter what it takes. I blocked him on everything and reported him. Has anyone had an experience like this? He completely switched up and I was so thrown of guard. ",6,1738791701.0,TwoHotTakes,13,0.8,False

Hey Reddit,

I’ve been feeling genuinely overwhelmed by my own relentless strive for perfection, and it’s starting to get in the way of actually living. I overthink everything—what hobby to take on, which direction to go in creatively—and in the end, I just procrastinate until nothing happens.

I work remotely, which I prefer over going to the office (I tried it for a few months and realized I’m much better at home), but even then, I can’t shake the feeling that I might be missing out. Am I learning enough? Meeting the right people? Should I be pushing myself to be more present in some way?

I spent so much time striving for the “perfect job,” and when I didn’t get it, I landed where I am now—at a job that’s okay, good even. But doubt still creeps in. I keep wondering: Is this really the right fit for me?

On paper, my life is good. I’m happily married to a wonderful husband. I genuinely show up for my friends and nurture those relationships. Still, I sometimes look at other people’s social lives—the ones with tight-knit girl groups—and wonder why my social circle doesn’t look like that anymore. I have individual friends of my own who I see over coffee, drinks here and there, but no girl group with who I go to roadtrips or do fun stuff. I’m almost 31, I still question whether it’s “acceptable,” as if life has some high score I’m supposed to hit in every area. 
 I’m a social, curious person who loves interesting, fun, and vulnerable people, but I just don’t know where to meet them in my 30s besides new job.

Family is another layer. I am an only child and my mom and cousins live in another town, and I only see them about once a month. I can’t help but wonder how life would feel if, like many of my friends, I had family nearby and maybe that would make me feel more grounded.

I keep falling into this cycle of picking apart the “imperfections” in my life and constantly asking myself what’s missing. And the truth is, I don’t really know what to do about it.


I work in the creative industry because I love creativity and hate monotony, but ironically, my life feels a little too monotone right now.

If anyone out there has been through something similar, I’d love to hear your thoughts. How did you break free from this mental loop of striving for some undefined version of “perfect”?

A Three-Day, Full-Throttle Green Day Camping Festival

Location: A sprawling outdoor venue with campgrounds—think somewhere with that Woodstock-meets-punk-rock energy.

Festival Concept

This is the ultimate Green Day experience—a three-to-four-day camping festival where fans get to live and breathe the band’s music, history, and attitude. Each night, Green Day performs one or two of their legendary albums in full, giving fans a once-in-a-lifetime chance to experience their discography in a way that’s never been done before.

Day 1: Dookie & Insomniac
	•	The festival kicks off with pure ‘90s punk chaos, as Green Day rips through the albums that made them icons.

Day 2: American Idiot & 21st Century Breakdown
	•	A night of politically charged anthems, theatrical storytelling, and an arena-level spectacle.

Day 3: Fan-voted setlist & Nimrod
	•	The band plays Nimrod in full, followed by a fan-voted setlist spanning their entire career.

(Optional Day 4: A surprise, deep-cut set or a secret side project performance.)

The Green Day Experience: More Than Just a Concert
	•	🎸 The Bookmobile Museum: The legendary van that helped shape Green Day’s early days, turned into a punk history exhibit.
	•	🚗 Green Day Garage: Iconic cars from music videos (Basket Case convertible, Jesus of Suburbia car, etc.).
	•	🐰 Punk Bunny Café: A 24-hour coffee stand",2,1738790579.0,greenday,6,0.75,False

I’m 8 months postpartum and have been doing all “the things”* and the scale hasn’t budged at all. I just weaned a week ago so I feel that could be a factor but not sure.

The things I have been doing (60 days of this):
1. Counting calories & macros. I weigh 200lbs and my macros are set at 152gP/ 63g fat/ 180g carbs and a total of 1900 calories a day. I am eating home cooked nutritious meals and measuring (on a scale) every thing I put in to a meal. I am making sure the meals are balanced with protein, fat, fiber, and carbs. Snacks are healthy as well such as nuts, fruits, cheese etc. I drink over 150 oz of water a day and have 1-2 cups of coffee in the morning.
2. Walking 7-10k steps on days I rest and 5-7k on days I workout. I workout 2 days on, 1 day off. My workouts consist of heavy lifting, TABATA, HIIT etc.and last around 30-45 min.
3. I *try* to sleep well but my infant still wakes up at night.

1iil9cy,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1iil9cy/i_22m_am_falling_in_love_with_my_long_term_friend/,I (22M) am falling in love with my long term friend (22F) and don't know what to do.,"I (22M) think I fell for my friend (22F).

I don't know what to do, i think I'm falling in love with one of my closest friends. We met at our old martial arts dojo and we’ve known each other for about 10 years now. We used to work together running the summer camps and after programs for our dojo all through middle and high school. We’ve kept in touch since going to different universities but we don’t really talk regularly. We catch up every 4 months or so by going out for coffee at the same coffee shop we always go to and we end up talking for hours about life and what’s going on since we last saw each other. I decided to go see her in the Netherlands when I had a break from school and she was studying abroad for about a year. I’ve probably been in love with her for a long time but I didn’t realize it until the last time I saw her. I know it sounds stupid but there’s just that feeling I get when it’s just us catching up on life talking and it feels like time is flying by but no one else in the room is even there. I’m unsure of how she feels and I also feel like it would be incredibly unfair if I end up opening up with these feeling before I move across the country or but on the other hand I know if I say nothing or do nothing I don’t know if I’ll be able to get out out of my mind. I also know if I end up hurting her or end up completely ruining our friendship it’ll repeat in my head.

i think the main point that made me realize i might be falling for her was when i started talking about traveling for graduation she was the first person to pop into my head as someone to travel with and when i got the invitation for my god brothers wedding happening in June she was the first person to pop into my head as a plus 1 for the wedding. 

my biggest issue is that when we plan to meet to catch up or grab coffee together we can make plans happen that day or the next day. I'm also an incredibly dense person at times and I'm pretty bad with catching subtle social cues when they are directed at me so I have no idea whether she wants to just remain friends or has other feelings towards me.

I've been in relationships before and I understand how I feel when I am falling for someone but those have all been much faster where there's mutual feelings very fast. but this feeling is something that has been growing for a long time which is completely different compared to everything else.

I've already asked if she wants to grab a drink or something to eat mid February since I'll be back in town around that time and she agreed but we haven't set a concrete date and time yet. I just don't know what to do at this point.

what is the best way to ask her out?

As a self-proclaimed coffee enthusiast, I’ve been through countless brewing devices, and this one comes with its own charm and quirks. Using this machine daily, I discovered its strengths and weaknesses, which I’ll delve into while keeping it real, not overly polished.

**Design & Build Quality**  
The Bonavita BV1900TS is a compact machine with a minimalist aesthetic. Its brushed stainless steel finish blends well in most kitchens, though it doesn't scream luxury. I appreciated its sturdy build and relatively small footprint, which easily sat under my kitchen cabinets. However, the filter basket sitting directly on the carafe felt a bit odd; it’s functional, but when you remove it, you’re left with the awkward task of finding a place to put the drippy basket. Durability-wise, the materials feel solid, but I did notice some minor quirks, such as the carafe lid, which was slightly challenging to clean.

**Brewing Performance**  
This machine promises speed, and it delivers. The Bonavita BV1900TS can brew eight cups in just around six minutes, which is impressive. The 1500-watt heater ensures the water reaches an optimal temperature of 195°F to 205°F. I tried the optional pre-infusion mode (which requires holding the button for five seconds before brewing), and it made a noticeable difference in flavor when using freshly roasted coffee beans. The water showerhead design aims to evenly saturate the grounds, though I observed that water distribution wasn't as perfect as advertised—it seemed to favor a couple of holes over the others.

Curious about Bonavita BV1900TS cost? [Check it out on Amazon here.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/product-reviews/bonavita-bv1900ts-coffee-maker-review-b00o9fo1hk/)

**Coffee Flavor**  
This is where things get delightful. With the right beans and grind size, the Bonavita BV1900TS produces a smooth, flavorful cup with minimal bitterness. I tested it with several coffee blends, and it consistently delivered robust brews. My favorite experiment involved single-origin beans, and the results were impressively nuanced. However, the lack of customization options (no strength settings or programmable features) might disappoint those who love tinkering with their brews. It’s straightforward—just fill, press, and brew.

**Cleaning & Maintenance**  
Cleaning is a mixed bag. The removable filter basket and carafe lid are dishwasher-safe, which is a blessing for lazy days. However, the carafe design has a “lip” that traps residual liquid, making it frustrating to dry completely. I often found myself using a kitchen towel to get every drop out. The water reservoir isn’t removable, so you’ll need to wipe it down occasionally to prevent mineral build-up.

**Pros**

* The compact size fits snugly in tight spaces.
* Brews quickly and maintains optimal water temperature.
* Produces smooth, flavorful coffee with minimal acidity.
* Thermal carafe keeps coffee hot for hours without a hot plate.
* Simple, one-button operation is refreshingly easy.

**Cons**

* No programmable features or brew strength settings.
* Water distribution isn’t entirely uniform.
* Awkward filter basket placement after brewing.
* Carafe traps liquid under the rim, making it tricky to dry.
* Slightly overpriced for its basic feature set.

**Comparison to Competitors**  
When comparing the Bonavita BV1900TS to other models like the Technivorm Moccamaster and the Oxo Brew 8-Cup Coffee Maker, it holds its ground in terms of brewing simplicity and coffee quality. The Technivorm Moccamaster is pricier but offers a more robust build and slightly better coffee flavor. On the other hand, the Oxo Brew comes with additional features like a programmable timer and a more ergonomic carafe design, making it a tough competitor. The Bonavita excels in speed and ease of use but lags in versatility and overall polish.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money**  
Given its feature set, the Bonavita BV1900TS sits in a mid-to-high price range. While it doesn’t have advanced features like a built-in grinder or programmable settings, it justifies its cost through consistency in brewing great coffee. That said, the value diminishes slightly when compared to competitors offering similar (or better) performance with extra features at a similar price point.

**Features in Action**  
The one-touch operation simplifies the morning routine—just press the button and let the machine do its thing. The pre-infusion mode is a thoughtful addition for coffee purists who want to unlock the full potential of their beans. The thermal carafe is a standout feature, keeping coffee hot for hours without compromising taste. The BPA-free plastic parts are a nice touch, ensuring no unwanted flavors seep into the brew.

**Final Call**  
The Bonavita BV1900TS is a great choice for anyone seeking a no-frills coffee maker that prioritizes flavor and speed. However, it might not be the best fit for those who enjoy customizable brewing options or want a completely hassle-free cleaning experience.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Albania's coffee culture is a vibrant tapestry woven through its rich history, social traditions, and modern practices. Understanding this culture allows you to appreciate not just the beverage itself, but the communal experiences it creates. Whether you are sitting in a bustling café or enjoying a quiet moment at home, coffee plays an essential role in daily life.

### The Roots of Coffee in Albania

Coffee was introduced to Albania in the 18th century, likely through trade routes that linked the Ottoman Empire to Europe. This introduction marked the beginning of a profound cultural shift. The beverage quickly became a symbol of hospitality and social connection. Traditional coffee houses, known as 'kafene', emerged as key social spaces where people gathered to share stories, discuss politics, or enjoy music.

### Traditional Coffee Preparation

In Albania, coffee is often prepared using a method inherited from Ottoman customs. The coffee is finely ground and boiled with water and sugar in a small pot known as a 'xhevahir.' The result is a rich, strong drink that is usually served unfiltered. Here are the main steps involved:

1. Measure water and coffee according to taste.
2. Combine the coffee and water in a pot and add sugar, if desired.
3. Slowly heat the mixture, allowing it to foam without boiling over.
4. Pour into a small cup, letting the grounds settle at the bottom.

This method highlights the significance of the brewing process, regarded as both an art and a science in Albanian culture.

### Social Significance of Coffee

Coffee plays a crucial role in fostering relationships in Albania. It is customary to invite friends and family over for a coffee as a gesture of hospitality. This ritual often extends to both casual gatherings and formal occasions. While enjoying coffee, it is common to engage in lively conversations. In many ways, coffee brings people closer and strengthens community ties.

### Cafés: The Heart of Albanian Coffee Culture

Today, Albania boasts a diverse array of cafés that reflect both traditional values and modern influences. From quaint, time-honored establishments to trendy coffee shops, each venue has its unique character. Here are some popular types of cafés you may encounter:

- **Traditional Kafene:** These cafés maintain the classic ambiance with low seating and a nostalgic atmosphere.
- **Modern Coffee Shops:** Trendy spots that offer a variety of coffee styles, including espresso, lattes, and cold brews.
- **Outdoor Cafés:** These venues often feature beautiful terraces and gardens, making them ideal for people-watching.

Each type of café provides a unique experience, whether you’re looking to savor a quiet moment or engage with the bustling surroundings.

​ -Plan Your Visit to Albania Here--&gt;https://travels-101.com/explore-albania  
### Modern Practices in Coffee Consumption

Over the years, Albania's coffee culture has evolved, embracing modern practices while preserving traditional roots. The younger generation is increasingly experimenting with different brewing methods, such as pour-over and French press techniques. This evolution has led to a wider appreciation for specialty coffees, including single-origin beans that showcase unique flavor profiles.

Additionally, many cafés are focusing on sustainability, sourcing organic and fair-trade coffee. This conscientious approach not only supports local farmers but also enhances the quality of the coffee enjoyed by consumers.

### The Future of Albanian Coffee Culture

As Albania continues to grow and evolve, so will its coffee culture. The blend of tradition and modernity makes for an exciting landscape.

1iil2cn,https://i.redd.it/krosmzdjzdhe1.jpeg,Angel Bread,"What is your favorite mallow scent? 
After trying Angel Bread and hearing it be titled the best mallow. Being placed above Delizia, I had to try it. It is a dessert bread scent. It is a vanilla scent which is why people are referring to it as marshmallow. You definitely get the yeast note it's not american yeast. Which is why everyone is claiming they don't smell ""yeast"". 

I have plenty of marshmallow scents that I personally rank higher than Kyse. Such as Snow Moon, Sweet Fluff & Marshmallow Dream. 

Snow Moon has a beautiful chai latte steaming on the kettle. Your grandma is making cookie butter to go into her cookie dough ice-cream. Finally, you walk to the refrigerator and pull out a big batch of marshmallow fluff. The marshmallow fluff sticks onto your flowy blouse. Later you're walking in the sun & you smell the most beautiful powdered marshmallow wafting into your nose. You look down and wonder how many pollutants have landed on your shirt & if you can still eat the fluff. The marshmallow scent projects all day and you couldn't be happier to do laundry later that evening. 

Sweet Fluff has a beautiful opening of cotton candy freshly spun. Warm and light winds hit your nose, your mouth salivating. You then walk and see homemade gourmet marshmallows. Bigger than your coffee cup can allot. Past the world's largest marshmallows, you see vanilla pudding and nilla wafers. Flecks of vanilla bean pods swirled throughout. You grab a plate and load it down with pudding. You grab a marshmallow which covers the plate. Walking to your seat you pass the cotton candy and you have to have a stick. The candy floss has now cooled and it's not as pungent as before. 

Marshmallow Dream has a powdered donut quality. Melted marshmallows stuck together. You have to take the powder from the donut bag and pull it apart. Hoping your hand doesn't get stuck in the process. 

Delizia reminds me of roasting marshmallows. You get a bit of plastic stuck in your mouth from ripping the bag open with your teeth. It quick turns into a plain vanilla ice-cream scent. Similar to Tihota but not as cloying. 

Angel Bread is a bread baked delight. Vanilla with a tangy yeast. Icing is poured over it like an Italian donut. Powdered sugar is dusted on top. A huge fan turns on and the vanilla sugar goes everywhere. In your nose, throat and ears. 

Sweet Fluff Cocoa & Rose straight up vanilla extract with a fluffy nuance. Gourmand and delicious. 

Marshmallow is essentially vanilla flavor. Most of us are used to Jet Puffed marshmallows. I grew up eating them but after realizing it contains pork I no longer consume them. I make homemade gourmet marshmallows and they don't really have a smell. You get a hint of vanilla bean paste and powdered sugar. 

Brands like Jet Puff use artificial flavoring. Yes, flavors can smell strong and artificial as well. That's how artificial it is, lol. Which is why I'm so over the marshmallow craze. Half of us don't even know the true smell and essence of real organic marshmallows. & it's pretty scary. It's basically like vanillin vs madagascarian vanilla vs vanilla orchid. Bath & Body Works vs Tom Ford vs Kriegler. ",1,1738790048.0,FemFragLab,2,0.67,False

With every puff, my worries end.  
A morning spark, a midnight light,  
You stand beside me, day and night.

A little break from life’s cruel game,  
One flick, one drag—ah, just the same!  
You whisper tales in wisps of smoke,  
A poet’s muse, a dreamer’s cloak.

The coffee's dull without your touch,  
A meal’s not right—I miss you much!  
You pair so well with drinks and chats,  
With rainy days and old straw hats.

The anti-smokers wag and preach,  
But sweet tobacco’s out of reach!  
They’ll never know the joy so fine,  
Of sitting back with smoke and time.

1iikzog,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1iikzog/im_unsure_whether_to_divorce_my_otherwise_kind/,I'm unsure whether to divorce my otherwise kind husband who occasionally emotionally abuses me.,"We've been married a year and a half (28/F, 33/M), and we married very quickly so a lot of the traits I'm talking about today absolutely came as a surprise over the course of our time together - 

As far as what I'm potentially considering emotional abuse (I'm unsure atp) - My husband is largely conflict avoidant. I've come to him repeatedly regarding feeling emotionally invalidated in the relationship, he often gaslights me or outright denies my experience. He might say something like ""Youre so sensitive"" ""You're always looking for problems where there aren't any"". He's perfectly comfortable with moving on from something without ever addressing it even if i feel deeply misunderstood and the conflict does not resolve. I might suggest tackling problems together by trying to improve our conflict resolution skills and he will tell me that this simply isn't high on his priority list and that what I really want is to ramp up conflict in the relationship, and that I'm manifesting more conflict. He will often twist my pleas for healthier communication and start to say i'm taking everything he says wrong that I'm even manipulating him. He sooo rarely apologizes (and I've never had a sincere heartfelt apology either) and he does not take accountability for his part of our relationship. He really does flip it to where I'm the problem for having a problem. He went to therapy early on in the relationship with me, but we never got to conflict resolution. We kind of stayed stuck on attachment styles, and how I leaned anxious and he's avoidant and  I needed to become more secure, which I will say I've improved on a lot as far as bombarding my spouse with my feelings. I'm completely willing to take ownership for my emotional regulation and I'm better at it than before. Now my husband does not want to go to therapy at all, because he says ""we went already"" 

Now to the parts that complicate this for me. 

My husband is only like this during conflict or confrontation, when tensions are high. Otherwise he is not avoidant. He's very high on physical touch and acts of service. The same person I described above, is the same person who worries about whether or not I ate or drank water, he will do chores to lighten my load, he will brush the snow off of my car and make sure the maintenance is up to date, he will remember how I like my coffee. He is not very strong with verbal affection, but he tells me he loves me often. He is often squeezing me and kissing my forehead which makes me feel very loved. Most days we don't have conflict, and maybe that's because we're avoiding it, but most days are pretty easy. Even though hes a little bit stoic and antisocial with others, we can be silly together and we are often lounging in our comfortable little cocoon. Hes often checking in on me, not in a controlling way by any means, but just texts me to see how im doing. He isn't the most vulnerable, or the most emotionally adept so he often does fall into ""solver"" mentality rather than sitting with my feelings with me, but he does stay present whenever I have something to vent about that isnt about our relationship, and he often tries to uplift me (even if it does feel invalidating from my end sometimes because hes solving for my discomfort). He will offer to help my friends out if they get stuck on the side of the road, or he will show up to fumigate my moms house. He is truly ole reliable. I also trust him infinitely as far as infidelity or anything like that, he's never been a wandering eye type. I generally trust his character. He also supports my hobbies and interests even though he doesn't share them. We both want to start a family. He's very generous with his time and resources. I made him a little gratitude list the other day, and he doesn't shrug it off, he may not say anything verbally but he hugs me and then he displays it on the shelf right by the front door. I also still feel strong romantic feelings for him, and while this may be superficial, he's objectively good looking like GQ model good looking and I doubt I'll bag a better looking man tbh, but I recognize that this cant be too high on my priority list as far as taking an action to divorce or not. 

Other things to note are personality differences. He's more introverted than I am (like really introverted and distrusting of others), he often doesn't engage when we are out socially. I'm a feeler and he's a thinker, we have different interests and hobbies and honestly some of our sense of humor aligns but not all of it. I haven't considered these deal breakers, but they are definitely notable differences that I'm adding it to the equation. 

I'm really stuck on what to do or where to go with the state of our relationship when its so hard to communicate with him sometimes. We talked about divorce today, and he completely threw his hands up ready to quit. He says hes exhausted, and that he doesn't know what to do (even though im telling him lets go to therapy, and im telling him exactly what i want to work on) - we both pretty much agreed to divorce, and agreed we might have some fundamental incompatibilities. It felt pretty grim and hopeless. An hour later we were hugging, not talking, and I asked him if he was 100% sure he wanted to end things and he said no, and I said me neither. So now were just in kind of a limbo, and the idea of divorce has been thrown out there. 

Does this seem like it could get better with time and firmer boundaries? Or am I trying to overlook what may be early emotional abuse that might only get worse? ",1,1738789869.0,Marriage,1,1.0,False

Everyone in this situation are college seniors. Me (21F), my (22M) friend, let's call him Chris, and 2 female friends, let's call them Emma (21F) and Sophia (21F). Also, my boyfriend, John (21M).

Chris and Emma met through me at a football game last October. Chris, Emma, Sophia, and I would hang out mutually a few times. One night last November, Chris, Emma, John, and I went out for drinks and Chris and Emma were making out by the end of the night. Nothing else happened, but things went in a romantic direction with them. In December, they had gone on one coffee date but I didn't know for a while because I took care not to pry. Throughout that month, Emma got very busy with studying for the MCAT and she also got quite sick with the flu for almost that entire month. Here's the timeline of what followed:

\- Chris reached out to plan another date and Emma was down. He made a reservation at a restaurant but she cancelled the day before because she'd started feeling sick. He said ok, no worries, next time.

\- Chris reaches out a few days later, asking how she's doing and hints at hanging out again. She says she's still sick.

\- A few days later, Chris reaches out one last time ""Still sick?"". She replies with one word: ""Unfortunately."". He gets the vibe she isn't really interested due to her lack of effort in making any future plans so he decides to just kinda let it go and doesn't reply.

\- Emma doesn't reach out for a full MONTH following that, seeming to be under the impression that HE had ghosted her. One week ago, she texts him with a quick apology and asks him to go out.

At this point, Emma and Chris are both close friends of mine. I spend time with both of them and I chat with both of them very regularly. It had sort of become the norm for both of them to mention the other to me. Again, I was careful about navigating that dynamic and not overstepping. I rarely brought their ""relationship"" (I say this in quotes because they were never officially bf/gf status) up first, if they felt like sharing anything with me I let them approach me. After December had passed, my impression of the situation was that they'd simply drifted. Cool, no big deal. Happens all the time.

After Emma sent the apology and ""wanna go out?"" text last week, Chris briefly mentioned it during one of our shared classes. He was on the fence about responding because a) she'd left him hanging for so long and b) he wasn't sure if her intentions were genuine or not. I honestly couldn't give him any pointers because I wasn't sure where Emma stood myself, as she'd drifted from me during December as well.

Last Saturday, Emma, Sophia, and I went out for drinks. Emma and Sophia are closer to each other than I am to either of them, but I still enjoyed hanging out with them. I'd been friends with these girls for over 2 years at this point. Before we'd even gotten halfway through our first drinks, Emma says ""Ok, I need to ask-- what's up with Chris?"" She brought it up first. She expressed that she didn't know what was going on, she seemed offended that he hadn't responded to her for a few days since she'd sent the text. Keep in mind it had just been a week while she'd left him with nothing for much longer. I didn't exactly know how to tell her ""he's unsure about your intentions"", so I said something along the lines of ""Yeah I mean I can talk to him about it"". I'll be honest, I don't remember exactly how she responded, but it certainly wasn't anything close to ""No, don't, I want to handle this myself"". I felt like by her approaching me about this, she expected me to sort of find things out for her.

We continue drinking, everyone's pretty drunk now. Definitely not like blacked out but a solid buzz. Emma starts going on about Chris again, saying she likes him, saying she's still down to talk, she was just super sick that month, over and over. And at some point there my drunk brain goes ""well what the hell, then that can happen"". The way Chris had spoken about it, him not texting her back was the most likely option. But he liked her and had told me he'd still be down to go out with her if there was a little more clarity. And so I just texted him, vertbatim, no typos:

""bro

emma like

likes u

if youre willing id suggest giving it another shot

based on the conversation i had w her she really was sick as hell for a whole month""

I was COVERING for her. I was simply trying to build a bridge that she'd indicated she wanted. Were it not for me, she more than likely wouldnt have gotten a text back. And that didn't seem like what she wanted. Maybe I didnt explain the nuances of all this to her because well, we were all drunk. I sent this text when she was right next to me because I didn't want to feel like I was hiding anything from her. She was looking over my shoulder. Maybe I missed some tiny cues of discomfort or something, but from my perspective, she didnt seem fazed at all. We were all giggling along. She NEVER not once asked me to stop or unsend the texts or anything. We all continued to have a great night and got home and I thought everything was chill. The next morning, Chris thanked me for letting him know and said he'd reach out to her again.

The next day, Emma texts me to ask exactly what I'd sent Chris, as if she hadn't already seen last night. Yeah, sure, no problem. I didn't spill any secrets or give away sensitive information. I was facilitating a reconnection. But no, she's completely pissed that I texted. She said ""sure drunk me said i'd still be down to talk but sober me isn't"", even though she brought all this up when she was dead sober in the first place. she told me she's actually not interested in him and ""there's a reason i didn't reach out again"" (assuming that means her not double texting after the ignored first text). Emma turned Sophia against me as well and they both seem to have this idea that i was meddling between Emma and Chris and involving myself where I shouldn't have. Also, keep in mind that neither of them have any relationship experience. I believe Chris was the first dude Emma had really gotten involved with in college that really went anywhere, so that might explain why she was assigning so much importance to this.

Do I recognize that asking Emma before sending the text would've been the wisest move of all? Sure, and I acknowledged that and apologized for it. But I also firmly explained my perspective and how she didn't communicate well with Chris in the first place and that's why everything unfolded the way it did. She seemed to take offense at that and threatened to end our friendship. This really bewildered me as we'd been friends for over 2 years at that point and it just seemed so sudden and disregarding of conflict resolution. In my eyes, there's a difference between being meddlesome and just trying to be diplomatic. This seemed like an unnecessary situation that frankly, would've been left up in the air for I don't know how long if it hadn't exploded like this. I felt that I'd just been behaving like a good friend and villainizing me for it was a stretch.

In addition, I would understand a reaction of this caliber if I was some random single girl inserting myself in a years' long relationship between two people. I recognize that might lead to questioning my intentions. But I am in a lovely, healthy, long-term relationship with John and I can say with complete transparency that all Chris is is a good friend of mine and I only wanted the best for him and Emma. With Emma and Chris, the extent of their ""relationship"" was making out a couple times and going on ONE date and texting. Nothing further. So I just am not seeing this as an overstep of my authority because they were never a defined thing in the first place. I don't see how this can be framed as me meddling in their ""dating life"". And truthfully, I didn't think the text I sent was that deep. After I spoke to Chris about this he thought I was in the right and said he'd also have sent the text I did in my place. Now I'm not in contact with neither Emma nor Sophia, but until the end they strongly believed I was in the wrong at this had been a breach of trust. They thought I should've just listened and not said anything to Chris, because in their words, ""it was up to Emma to take that step"". But in this scenario, I believed I did the most rational thing given the context. It seems Emma wasnt sure of what she really wanted with this guy and she kept flipping from interest to disinterest. And I defended him because it felt very unfair to him. It all seems juvenile and immature but I just don't know, maybe there's something I'm not seeing. AITAH?",2,1738789835.0,AITAH,2,1.0,False

Finally, you walk to the refrigerator and pull out a big batch of marshmallow fluff. The marshmallow fluff sticks onto your flowy blouse. Later you're walking in the sun & you smell the most beautiful powdered marshmallow wafting into your nose. You look down and wonder how many pollutants have landed on your shirt & if you can still eat the fluff. The marshmallow scent projects all day and you couldn't be happier to do laundry later that evening. 

Sweet Fluff has a beautiful opening of cotton candy freshly spun. Warm and light winds hit your nose, your mouth salivating. You then walk and see homemade gourmet marshmallows. Bigger than your coffee cup can allot. Past the world's largest marshmallows, you see vanilla pudding and nilla wafers. Flecks of vanilla bean pods swirled throughout. You grab a plate and load it down with pudding. You grab a marshmallow which covers the plate. Walking to your seat you pass the cotton candy and you have to have a stick. The candy floss has now cooled and it's not as pungent as before. 

Marshmallow Dream has a powdered donut quality. Melted marshmallows stuck together. You have to take the powder from the donut bag and pull it apart. Hoping your hand doesn't get stuck in the process. 

Delizia reminds me of roasting marshmallows. You get a bit of plastic stuck in your mouth from ripping the bag open with your teeth. It quick turns into a plain vanilla ice-cream scent. Similar to Tihota but not as cloying. 

Angel Bread is a bread baked delight. Vanilla with a tangy yeast. Icing is poured over it like an Italian donut. Powdered sugar is dusted on top. A huge fan turns on and the vanilla sugar goes everywhere. In your nose, throat and ears. 

Sweet Fluff Cocoa & Rose straight up vanilla extract with a fluffy nuance. Gourmand and delicious. 

Marshmallow is essentially vanilla flavor. Most of us are used to Jet Puffed marshmallows. I grew up eating them but after realizing it contains pork I no longer consume them. I make homemade gourmet marshmallows and they don't really have a smell. You get a hint of vanilla bean paste and powdered sugar. 

Brands like Jet Puff use artificial flavoring. Yes, flavors can smell strong and artificial as well. That's how artificial it is, lol. Which is why I'm so over the marshmallow craze. Half of us don't even know the true smell and essence of real organic marshmallows. & it's pretty scary. It's basically like vanillin vs madagascarian vanilla vs vanilla orchid. Bath & Body Works vs Tom Ford vs Kriegler. ",0,1738789815.0,Perfumes,1,0.5,False
1iikxgq,https://www.reddit.com/r/VivintSmartHome/comments/1iikxgq/read_the_fine_print_before_you_sign_up_but_like/,"Read The Fine Print Before You Sign Up!!!  But like, for real though.","tl;dr - If you're late on a payment or have too many false alarms, Vivint can terminate the contract and collect the full value of their contract terms.  If you can't pay, they will send you to collections.  They rely on people's propensity to avoid reading contracts.  I included full contract sections in the below text for reference.

When my wife and I bought our first home my wife picked up a few ring cameras, which was nice to have.  One day she checked the camera we put towards the backyard and we saw a man drinking coffee and his dog on a leash just standing in our backyard.  It freaked me out tremendously.  Shortly after there was a crew of sales people canvasing my neighborhood to sign people up for equipment and services.  With my memory fresh of that stranger standing there I was eager to sign up.  Here's how it's going.  
  
First lesson, Vivint treats equipment and service as separate items, if you choose to finance the equipment you will owe a lender (not Vivint) for the equipment, and you will have a separate bill to Vivint for the services and operation of the equipment.  This was clear to me when I signed up but you'd be surprised how many people this little detail will just blow right past.  It's just too easy for them.

Second lesson: If the equipment doesn't work properly they lean on the following section of the contract to avoid doing anything to help you if simple I.T. helpdesk style support doesn't work.  Warranty is only 1 yr and even so they don't warrant that the system will always detect.  
  
3. OUR LIMITED LIABILITY WHERE PERMITTED BY LAW, WE DISCLAIM ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES PROVIDED BY LAW INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR PURPOSE. **WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE SYSTEM WILL ALWAYS DETECT, OR HELP PREVENT, ANY BURGLARY, FIRE, HOLD-UP OR ANY OTHER SUCH EVENT.** WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE SYSTEM CANNOT BE DEFEATED OR COMPROMISED OR THAT IT WILL ALWAYS OPERATE. WE DO NOT WARRANT ANY WORK OR PRODUCTS PROVIDED BY YOU OR A THIRD PARTY USED IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR SYSTEM. SECTIONS 17 AND 18 ON THE NEXT PAGE OF THIS AGREEMENT LIMIT OUR LIABILITY TO TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS ($2,000.00) IF YOU OR ANYONE ELSE SUFFERS ANY HARM (DAMAGE OR LOSS OF PROPERTY, PERSONAL INJURY, OR DEATH) BECAUSE THE SYSTEM FAILED TO OPERATE PROPERLY OR WE WERE CARELESS OR ACTED IMPROPERLY. **YOU HAVE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO TALK TO THE SALES AGENT ABOUT THIS LIMITATION.**

Third Lesson: We've been getting nothing but false alarms from the smoke detector device, and finally it happened where we weren't home and the fire department sent two vehicles and a handful of crew to our house for a device induced false alarm.  False alarms are not their problem, in fact they will make it YOUR problem by terminating the contract and collecting the remaining value of your contract.  They will also charge you the standard service fee if literally ANYONE tells them to enter your premises to turn off an alarm (see below).

10. False Alarms. You agree that you and others using the System will use it carefully so as to avoid causing false alarms. False alarms can be caused by weather or other forces beyond our control. **If we receive too many false alarms, that will constitute a breach of contract by you, and we may cancel monitoring and repair service and seek to recover damages.** If a false alarm fine or penalty is charged to us, the Center, or you by any governmental agency or third party, you will pay for the charge.  You authorize us to enter your premises to turnoff the audible device if we are requested or ordered to do so by governmental authorities, neighbors **or anyone else**, and you will pay our standard service call charge for each such visit.",2,1738789721.0,VivintSmartHome,1,1.0,False

Old grouchy Ned is heading to the store? Since we might go on strike, everyone take the coffee he always buys and loves with you as you plan your picket lines but do keep stocking everything else even while you march even if it isn't apart of your department.

Your coffee is out of stock? Is the entire grocery department empty also because the employees are striking and no one is there to shelf product? If they are striking, why would be bother stocking literally everything else but don't bother to stock one kind of coffee? Do you idiots not know how strikes work or what they are meant to do?

A. Go home to use the restroom when I get a chance

B. Find a public restroom (hotels, gas stations, coffee shops, etc.) while on shift

C. ""Relieve yourself"" somewhere outdoors (parks, woods, behind dumpsters, etc.)

D. Have a feature on the rideshare that pauses rides momentarily and navigates you to the nearest partnered restroom. If this feature is not free, how much are you willing to pay a month to get access to partnered restrooms throughout your city? 

  
PS: Obviously the last option would be way more valuable / ideal if Uber/Lyft would include this feature for free, but I am more interested to know if its enough value to pay for. 

Also, I am not trying to charge drivers who are already taking such a big hit with these corporations (me included), I am asking if you are willing to pay to determine the value and if it even solves a legitimate issue. 

  
Additional questions: 

1. How much guesstimated profit a day are you missing out on by having to find a restroom? 

2. Have you ever had to ""call it a day"" early just to go home and use the restroom? 

3. If you're paying $10 out of pocket for this feature, do you believe it would pay for itself because you're able to drive more?

1iiko83,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1iiko83,Feeling lost about what the problem is [DeLonghi EC9155],"I was gifted this machine just over a year ago as my first venture into espresso making. Milk drinks taste fine, though all espresso I have made has been horrible with almost no crema (but I assume I just don't like straight espresso). I've always bought beans from a local cafe or, more recently I've ordered them online. They are always reasonable fresh, between 2-4 weeks since roast date. However I've been having multiple issues to the point where I'm feeling hopeless.

I was using the provided accessories for a long while and they seemed sufficient, even though the tamper was quite loose when tamping, in such a way that I have to tap the portafilter to knock the grounds off the sides (more about this later). I dose about 14-16g (if the numbers on the dial are to be believed) but the basket is always way overflowing. This is necessary though, as I have to grind at the finest setting to get a decent flow rate; and I couldn't dose less because the basket is tapered in a way where the tamper stops at a point, which would lead to coffee not being compacted.

I recently bought a puck screen (and WDT tool) from normcore as shown, because I didn't like how coffee grounds kept getting stuck up in the group head. However I also had to buy a new basket since the tapered design on the provided one didn't allow it to fit. Now using an IMS ""DL2TH24E"", I can fit the puck screen.

But now there are further complications. Firstly, the issue with the tamper not fitting is even more exaggerated. I bought a levelling tamper thinking I was the issue, but even when placed it wiggles around. In addition with having to overfill the basket, it just makes a huge mess. Secondly, the espresso flows even faster now with the new basket, but I can't do anything about it as I already was on the finest setting the machine is capable of.

At this point, I have no idea what to do. Will I just have to cough up the money to buy an expensive grinder and scale? Everything about the machine works fine, I descale and clean often. I'm fine with espresso not working with my taste preference but it seems like I am just totally not equipped to use this machine.",2,1738789116.0,espresso,3,1.0,False

1iiklo6,https://i.redd.it/kr4r4t26wdhe1.jpeg,Found This Bad Girl in a Vintage Store This Week!,"While walking into my favorite local vintage shop Monday I noticed this Moschino bag on the mannequin in the window and I knew immediately it was for me. Especially when she priced it at $25 (probably because one side has the paint stains. No matter for me, I can always carry it with those sides facing me.)

I wore it yesterday and it was surprisingly more practical than I expected. It fits pretty comfortably on my shoulder but can also be work on the crook of the arm. It also Carrie’s more than you think. Right now I have two books, my wallet, AirPod maxes, keys, chapstick, Midol, and a couple feminine products in it and there’s still no distracting bulk.

I don’t have a huge handbag collection; my day to day is usually a large black or brown structured tote, and I have a small variety of vintage clutches for parties or dinner/lunch/coffee with friends. I’ve been looking for a weird/interesting bag big enough to hold what I listed but not so big that I can carry my laptop in it. Anyway, psyched to have found her!",9,1738788942.0,handbags,2,1.0,False

1iikjpm,https://www.reddit.com/r/puppy101/comments/1iikjpm/update_effective_am_routine_for_energetic_pup/,Update: Effective AM routine for energetic pup!,"I posted a few days ago because my energetic 6-month-old American Foxhound was getting us in trouble with our downstairs neighbor because he was so loud in the mornings. I just wanted to post an update that we came up with a morning routine for him that has seriously been helping! Not only does it mitigate noise in the morning but he's been way more chill throughout the day! It's definitely a lot of work early in the morning, but it's been paying off and I've been enjoying the extra bonding time. 

**Routine**

**7:45-8ish: Wake up + breakfast** 

**8-8:30:  Morning Walk + Training**  
This walk is very much focused on training and practicing his leash skills! I also make sure to stop at various intervals and practice some of his cues so he can develop more fluency in his training. Later in the day he gets another 30-minute walk, but that one is less dedicated to training since I take our older dog on it too. I also like to end this walk in a nearby field where we do a ""Sniff-Safari."" I basically let him lead us to whatever smells he wants to go. He's a foxhound and LOVES to use his nose. 

**8:30-8:50:** [**Free Work Enrichment** ](https://caninecompilation.com/free-work-enrichment-for-dogs/)  
Free work is GREAT! 10/10 recommend. It's so much better than just throwing puzzle toys at him because I can use old recyclables to create new puzzles for him. I also like to include different foods like banana slices or carrots to keep him stimulated. Freework usually keeps him quite occupied and gives me time to make coffee and relax a little bit while I watch him try to figure out the different puzzles! 

**8:50-9: Play outside - fetch or tug**  
After all that mental stimulation, I like to go outside with him play tug or fetch. It helps him release some of that pent-up energy from using his brain so much and is a reward for doing such a good job on his walk and enrichment! 

**9 - whenever: Chill time**  
After all of this, he usually settles down and chews on a bone until he eventually falls asleep. The rest of the day, he is super chill until my partner comes home from work, and he gets another burst of energy haha. ",3,1738788804.0,puppy101,0,1.0,False

* As per usual in January, Hillary came out of the gate strong with a flurry of posts. But keep in mind, Hilz may be a grifty liar who lies but she has a strategy - it’s constantly changing but it exists. Apparently, her January strategy was to create [“wholesome kid content”](https://www.reddit.com/r/HilariaBaldwin/comments/1hr9xce/handstand_mami_is_back_in_2025/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), [repost Spanish-language content](https://www.reddit.com/r/HilariaBaldwin/comments/1htme8b/unhinged_mamis_newest_ig_stories/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and announce to one and all [she has ADHD](https://www.reddit.com/r/HilariaBaldwin/comments/1hsegys/an_adhd_tiktok_in_hillarys_stories/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) to promote the brand we will see on the TLC show: bendy bilingual/bicultural/neurodivergent mami of [7 wild “Baldwinitos.”](https://www.reddit.com/r/HilariaBaldwin/comments/1hsn4jq/little_larry_juniors_cake_escapade_where_she_owns/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

* Then she posted the usual [chaotic birthday video montage](https://www.reddit.com/r/HilariaBaldwin/comments/1hvv3ei/leave_marc_anthony_out_of_it/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) mostly of the kids wandering around with balloons, Carmen looking very angsty and pouty, Raf being sweet to Ila, the pretend twins being goaded to kiss on the lips, and a sad hallway mirror selfie  - all set to the one Marc Anthony song she knows. u/Cobblerimaginary8200 has my heart forever with their comment: ""*Because nothing says España like Mexican piñatas and a Puerto Rican singer.""* The next day, [Alec posted a lukewarm message along with a nightmare fuel picture of Hilz in a professional photo shoot](https://www.reddit.com/r/HilariaBaldwin/comments/1hvz6qj/alec_finally_made_a_birthday_post_for_mami/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) – what in the world can these pictures possibly be for? Promoting the TLC show? I though the spin there was super mom of 7, not sexy vixen with no pants. So confusing.

[What in the bedraggled Maleficent is happening here?](https://preview.redd.it/czyl42btpdhe1.png?width=433&format=png&auto=webp&s=f23f9a210f115e76470711ef88091760af76bc7f)

* Three days after the birthday celebration, [Alec filed a civil lawsuit for malicious prosecution and civil rights violations](https://www.reddit.com/r/HilariaBaldwin/comments/1hxwicz/alec_baldwin_sues_for_malicious_prosecution_after/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). According to the AP, Alec *“alleges defamation in the suit, saying that prosecutors and investigators intentionally mishandled evidence as they pursued the case. Defendants named in the lawsuit include special prosecutor Kari Morrissey and Santa Fe District Attorney Mary Carmack-Altwies, along with three investigators from the Santa Fe County sheriff’s office and the county board of commissioners.”* The thought of Alec pouring obscene amounts of money into this is the only positive I see here. He was pretty puffed up about it, too, and posted the story from Variety on his IG, set to classical music because he is a Serious Intellectual, you peasants.

[To quote Groucho Marx, “\[He\] may look like an idiot and talk like an idiot but don't let that fool you. He really is an idiot.”](https://preview.redd.it/5jniu9oxpdhe1.png?width=294&format=png&auto=webp&s=3f26fc50f311033b93d9dd4093f31099d1aeec3f)

*  Then The Daily Mail captured [this lovely image](https://www.reddit.com/r/HilariaBaldwin/comments/1i1bnkd/i_knew_she_was_too_quiet_needed_attention/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) that inadvertently revealed the reality of Alec and Hillary’s life. Far from being an erudite, educated, cultured person, Alec is a former A list actor aging poorly (see Kevin Bacon and Pierce Brosman as points of comparison). He looks ridiculous next to his oblivious Pop Tart of a wife, skipping along in her tights and one of her seven lifetime of luxury guarantees strapped to her inflated chest. You reap what you sow, sir.

* More [ADHD reposted content](https://www.reddit.com/r/HilariaBaldwin/comments/1i2s957/pepinos_unpack_this_video_about_adhd_hillary_just/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) from Hilz  - she’s rilly rilly leaning into the “ADHD is My Superpower” narrative. Theory: one of her kids got diagnosed and she liked the attention and sympathy it generates.
* Apparently, Alec will be at [Comic Con Liverpool](https://www.reddit.com/r/HilariaBaldwin/comments/1i3fta8/hes_still_on_the_circuit/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) in May. Maybe someone should tell them they are not getting this version of Alec:

* Just in time for Alec’s 67^(th) birthday, hearings in the [suit brought against him by Rust crewmembers](https://www.reddit.com/r/HilariaBaldwin/comments/1i48nd7/trial_begins_in_april/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) will begin. One of those crew members, Ross Addiego, testified at Hannah Gutierrez’s trial and stated under oath that *“he had safety concerns before the fatal shooting. He witnessed two accidental discharges of blank rounds — something he could never recall occurring on another set. He said that he expressed frustration and anger over that to David Halls, the first assistant director. Addiego described the set as “rushed” and in a “state of chaos,” and said it appeared there was too little time to accomplish everything. He placed some blame on Baldwin, saying that he pushed the crew to move quickly and didn’t follow gun safety rules. He also said that everyone deferred to him. “I don’t recall anybody standing up to Mr. Baldwin on the set of Rust” Addiego said.""* (Vanity Fair, 2/26/24).
* Oblivious to all of this, Hillary staged her Dr. Zhivago [winter wonderland moment](https://www.reddit.com/r/HilariaBaldwin/comments/1i5fykd/mi_niña/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) (not that she listens when Alec drones on about this movie) with a fully made up Carmen and tagged the faux fur company that dutifully reposted her story. Then she made a [“sick toddler”](https://www.reddit.com/r/HilariaBaldwin/comments/1i6l1vu/more_exploitation/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) post which was actually a “bewbs/lips/fake lashes/expensive diamond cross” post, but same/same in España, Massachusetts.

* On January 23^(rd) Hillary [I Am a White Girl](https://www.reddit.com/r/HilariaBaldwin/comments/1i6s7m8/_/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) Baldwin announced her latest endeavor: a book entitled [“Manual Not Included.”](https://www.reddit.com/r/HilariaBaldwin/comments/1i6s7m8/_/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) The comments here were top tier, as always

* Let’s take a moment to consider the following: Alec never reposted anything about Carmen’s book deal. Hillary posted her book announcement on January 23rd and Alec didn’t repost it until January 31^(st), and even then it was with the scintillating caption *“link in bio.”* However, PeePaw had a lot to say about the following and made videos about each:

o   Demi Moore winning a Golden Globe (2 minutes)

o   The LA fires – *“I had a home there…”* (2 minutes)

o   “Attaching strings to aid for the LA fires”  - *“many people in this country are unaware of the concept of a donor state”* (4 minutes)

No video for Mami?

* [The LA Times published a fabulous piece by Alex Zaragoza](https://www.reddit.com/r/HilariaBaldwin/comments/1ic65n5/thought_provoking_article_from_the_la_times_by/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) where she interviewed an actual Spanish professor of linguistics from the Basque Country, Dr. Itxaso Rodriguez-Ordóñez. Zaragoza writes:

o   *The videos Rodriguez-Ordóñez has seen of Baldwin speaking led her to conclude that she was not from Spain. But, she adds, verifying such details is “a clickbait discussion. The question that we should be asking is: What is she trying to accomplish with this? What is her purpose? Whether it’s deliberate or not, we know that at least from a social linguistic standpoint, that it’s strategic what she’s doing.”*

o   *Baldwin has chosen to (allegedly!) pretend to be a Spaniard or inflate a tenuous connection. She re-authenticates this assertion in the video with casual mentions of the tortilla recipe being from her childhood and continues to use an accented “cebolla” even when she’s given the word “onion.” Why ask for the word if she wasn’t ever going to use it? In more simple terms, she’s trying way too hard to be Penelope Cruz but comes off more like that girl from college who studied a semester in Barthelona.*

[\\""Whether Baldwin’s Spanish identity is “real” or not, she gains notoriety, career opportunities, money and access to all that celebrity has to offer just by playing with the mystery.\\""](https://preview.redd.it/rjwacvx9rdhe1.png?width=206&format=png&auto=webp&s=365a377408d6a268a8df7aae91852e667a8b72d8)

* I found this story that Hillary posted bizarre bc it just highlights the Spanish-speaking nanny (audio only, of course), but anything to push the “I am Spanish because I say so” agenda. Calm down, Hilz, No H is saying “mucho” as in she put lots of lipstick on, she’s not reciting El Quijote.

[To clarify, a kid being bilingual = good. Telling your kids they are part Spanish when they are not = bad.](https://preview.redd.it/zo6r82ayrdhe1.png?width=292&format=png&auto=webp&s=a65f0218c02764e2312498d73b19ec1fc2f18157)

* On January 27^(th) we got the trailer for the TLC show which both Alec and Hillary reposted from TLC complete with their caption – no personalized comment about it. And what a narrative arc we got in one minute and 4 seconds!

o   16 seconds of “Baldwinito” high jinks and lame one-liners from both parents like *“don’t pee in the pool”* with high energy music

o   A cut to the set of Rust with somber piano music and Hillary just butchering the language of her actual ancestors: *“A son lost his mom in the most unthinkable tragedy; this is never something to forget.”*

o   Music plays with these heavy-handed lyrics *“when the word is getting cold/know that I’m your hand to hold”* as Alec pretends to cry while wearing a blazer and shorts as Hillary looks on like a deer in the headlights, not like a person comforting their partner.

o   Then the “stronger together” part set to where the kids’ privacy is being invaded as paps are taking pictures (because they’re filming a reality show in public), they each hug random kids, and they go to integrative therapy (paging Dr. Kathryn).

[Hillary: \\""Dammit, I should have tucked little Spanish flags into each bun.\\""](https://preview.redd.it/7mu8xio7sdhe1.png?width=753&format=png&auto=webp&s=8bd421521d56f314d2c84334260d361c902c795c)

 

* Her last story of the month was more wild and crazy Baldwin kids content: her [“mom hack” of putting signs on the toilet](https://www.reddit.com/r/HilariaBaldwin/comments/1ieo7z0/hillz_cant_wait_to_show_off_her_homes_next_month/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) bc her four sons urinate everywhere. She made it into a reel the first days of February because so many followers were asking about it – never mind that only 1,600 people liked it, it’s on-brand for Charisma-Free Hillary.

(Post stomach flu),"Never been diagnosed with ibs, don’t think I have it either. I do need to eat more fiber, constipation/diarrhea are not regular issues outside of bouts of illness or as side effects of medication. 

However, about a week ago I had a moderate bout of food poisoning. Lasted 24-36 hours. Hard to say if it was actually more severe than the 2 other times Ive had it, or if I had worse fatigue because of the lack of sleep + not taking medication (i have chronic fatigue as a symptom of ADHD, and because my ADHD meds can mess with my gut I didn’t think it was a great thing to risk + easier to sleep without it) 

Cramping, diarrhea, nausea, bloating, full body exhaustion. 

Was 80% better the following day, but still stuck to bland foods for 2 more days, bread and crackers, and bananas for fiber.

Got unlucky and had my period, preceded by unexpected constipation, but hey that’s a normal symptom of menstruation. Last about 2-3 days.

Fast forward a week, and while I *feel* back at 100%, and am eating spicy foods and drinking coffee again — I have a *new* problem.
Instead of the 1-4 “normal for me” (the most recent time I was off my meds my ‘bathroom schedule’ was as by-the-book as possible, so its def mostly the meds) bowel movements I am used to, I have been having what seems like 3-5 very VERY small bowl movements, in which rather than the tell-tale “heavy” feeling in the lower gut during constipation, I feel almost nothing in the lower gut but do feel pressure in the rectum.

So not a “going to shit my pants” feeling as much as a “need to use the bathroom in the next 20 minutes” feeling

Except this feeling is happening almost *hourly* and when I do produce it’s like loose rabbit turds. Not diarrhea, but seemingly far too soft for constipation

Additionally, Im not sure Ive felt fully “empty” since before the food poisoning.

My guess is just that the food poisoning was bad enough to really mess up my gut biome, so I wanted to see if anyone had any experience with similar or guesses as to when I should expect this to “settle”

It basically feels like the stuff in my colon isn’t moving coherently, and is instead breaking up into very small pieces that are far between, and Im not sure what I can do to aid this.",1,1738788600.0,IBSHelp,0,1.0,False

1iikepz,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1iikepz/buying_a_machine_hopefully_once_5000/,Buying a Machine... Hopefully Once! [~$5000],"I have done exhaustive research on this subject. Via this sub, various home barista forums, YouTube, etc. And I think the only thing I have left to do is ask this community what I should get based on my criteria.

I already have a superb grinder for espresso, Craig Lyn HG-1 Prime. But I have no espresso machine and have never had one other than a super automatic years back, and a Nespresso machine that my wife used. We want a real espresso machine now, and we don't want one that we're just going to want to replace with a better one in a year or two.

Use would be mostly milk drinks. A couple cappuccinos in the morning, maybe a couple other milk drinks during the day... the occasional plain shot... no super heavy use or situations where multiple drinks are coming out in rapid succession.

Space is a concern. The kitchen is renovated and not changing. The machine will sit on a stand alone table/coffee station with limited depth for the feet of a machine. The back or front of the machine can overhang a bit, but I have 16 inches of depth on which to place the feet of a machine. That actually rules out a LOT of machines.

I also have a standard 15 amp US plug. I don't want to use an adapter to run a 20amp machine in a lower power mode like the La Speziale machines allow. I just want to plug in and use the machine to its full potential.

I'm also not plumbing in. Need a tank.

Budget is whatever it takes. I don't think I really need to be spending $9000 on a Slayer Steam Single... but if the case was made strong enough....

Here's what I've narrowed my options down to:

\- La Marzocco Linea Micra: I like the simplicity and reliability, and the steam power.

\- Rancilio Silvia Pro X: Just barely fits, half the price of a LaMarzocco... is there really a reason for the Linea Micra over this?

\- Lelit Elizabeth: Price and size almost seem too good to be true.

\- Bezzera Aria PID: It fits, it's an HX machine that works with my power situation, and it has a rotary pump plus flow control... But I worry about heat up times with an E61.

\- Decent DE1 Pro: Seems like the obvious answer... but I worry about a machine so reliant on software from a company that I don't necessarily know how long will last. Is that thing a brick if Decent goes under? Also, what is servicing the thing like? I have a local guy that can fix conventional machines... not a Decent.

However, I'm not just going to buy the biggest and baddest machine that fits my criteria. If I don't NEED a dual boiler or HX machine for my needs... I'm happy to entertain lower cost options. But I've just seen things that look inconvenient on a lot of single boiler or lower cost machines... things like waiting for steam pressure/temp, not enough steam pressure to quickly foam up some milk, or just shoddy construction. I kinda do the ""Buy it For Life"" thing where I can.... but within reason.

I like to tinker with all my mechanical contrivances, so when a friend of mine showed me his Silvia and how simple and easy to take apart it was, I knew I needed one. Very new to espresso but I love coffee so I'm happy to dive in. 

My Silvia, as far as I can tell, is a first generation (based off the non-tapered all metal group head cover, the old style all black steam valve knob, and the all holes drip tray cover) with the newer style OPV that I recently adjusted to what I hope is around 9 bar. Got 129g of water out the short tube in 30 seconds, so I think that's about right. It's in pretty good shape, with no obvious leaks, flow or heating issues, rust, or visual impurities in the water out of either the steam wand or brew head. Even so, I would like to keep this machine running for as long as I can, and given that its history is unknown to me, I am wondering if I should treat it like my truck, which I mostly repair as things fail, or if a Rancilio is built more like a BMW than a Chevy and will explode with a series of cascading failures if a single part fails. My responsible brain tells me I should rip the whole thing apart and replace every gasket and spring I can find, but if I have the old style boiler with the brazed in heating element I definitely don't want to mess with that, and to be honest if it's working reasonably well now I kind of just want to use it as is. I have already descaled and backflushed with detergent, thoroughly cleaned the group head, shower screen, etc, and ordered a new 165 degree safety thermostat, which I've read only last around 1000 heating cycles before they need to be replaced. 

What say the community? Should I be rebuilding the steam and OPV valves, replacing the 3-way solenoid, and the 100 and 140 degree thermostats as well? I have no plans right now to add anything fancy like a PID, but I'm eyeing the newer style steam valve + articulating steam wand, as well as possibly a pressure gauge mounted into the frame somewhere.

I've published 7 mods (all free) so far on Creations. I'm a big fan of the game so I decided to get involved!

I'll link a few of my mods here and a link to my Creations page. 

My most popular mod so far has been [Better Piracy - GalBank Ships Have More Loot](https://creations.bethesda.net/en/starfield/details/c1aa772d-d862-48e5-9fdb-d575ada75417/Better_Piracy___GalBank_Ships_Have_More_Loot) which makes GalBank ships a lot more lucrative to plunder with increased credits as well as a chance to carry Astra as well as other loot.

Another crime related mod of mine is [Make Aurora Profitable - Steal From Your Employers](https://creations.bethesda.net/en/starfield/details/4ca8a262-9cc6-4377-a9e3-9fb84537f118/Make_Aurora_Profitable___Steal_From_Your_Employers) I found it frustrating in the vanilla game that being an Aurora producer/seller was nerfed by the fact that Chasmbass Oil is so expensive and in rare supply in the wild. This mod adds respawning chests to the Xenofresh factory that contain Chasmbass Oil but they are marked as Steal so you have to be careful of security. I also marked Chasmbass Oil as contraband to balance this free supply, given it's association with Aurora so smuggling it around the Settled Systems won't be easy!

Finally, my most recent mod is [Tea & Coffee Tweaks (Plus new recipes)](https://creations.bethesda.net/en/starfield/details/592b2ce1-09b1-4c71-9d1f-8e6f5d1eaa95/Tea__amp__Coffee_Tweaks__Plus_new_recipes_) which adds new teas and coffees with XP buffs but also addictive properties for balance. The mod also adds coffee and tea bags to Terrabrew and Tranquilitea vendors so you can craft these new drinks. These drinks require certain skills to craft, but they can occasionally be found for sale at the above vendors.

My Creations page and my other mods can be found at [ScientificGorilla](https://creations.bethesda.net/en/starfield/all?author_displayname=ScientificGorilla)

By the way, I'm very open to mod requests so long as I'm capable and I have time, I'm still a beginner at this! As for what's next, I have a tonne of ideas but for now I'm trying to learn how quests and NPCs work. It would help if Bethesda updated the wiki!

So, today at work was one of those days where I felt like I was juggling 15 things at once. First, I get to the office only to find out there's a last-minute meeting I didn’t know about. Fine, no big deal. Then, halfway through my day, I get a call that I have to handle a customer issue—*while* the boss is standing behind me, watching everything unfold. 😅

I’m trying to keep it together, handling emails, making sure the team is on track, and keeping my head above water, but then—*of course*—my coffee decides to spill all over my desk right when I’m trying to send a time-sensitive email. I just sat there for a second, laughing at the chaos of it all. 😂

It’s one of those days where you feel like you’re in a whirlwind, but somehow, you keep going because *what else can you do?*

Anyone else ever feel like everything happens at once, and you’re just trying to keep it together? 😩",1,1738787839.0,u_Rich_Direction_8968,0,1.0,False

I never planned on adopting a child.  

It just… happened.  

Loneliness does strange things to a person. I had spent the last five years drifting through life, detached, empty. No family. Few friends. Work was the only thing keeping me from slipping into something darker.  

Then I saw the listing.  

""Urgent Placement Needed. Immediate Adoption. No Fees Required.""  

The website was obscure, buried in the depths of the internet. It didn’t have a formal agency name—just a simple form, a grainy black-and-white photo of a small boy, and a message:  

""Elias is a quiet, well-behaved child looking for a home. Loves to read. No known relatives.""  

No details about his past. No contact number. Just a single button.  

“Take him home.”  

Something about it bothered me. But at the same time… it felt meant to be. Like the ad was waiting for me.  

I clicked it.  

The confirmation page simply said: “Elias will arrive soon.”  

I didn’t enter an address. I didn’t fill out any paperwork. But the next evening, as the sun sank into the horizon, I heard a soft knock at my door.  

And there he was.  

Small. Pale. Dark hair falling over wide, glassy eyes. He wore a simple, old-fashioned outfit—too clean, too perfect. He had no bags, no belongings. Just himself.  

He smiled up at me. “Hello.”  

Something about his voice felt… off. Hollow. Like an echo.  

But I shook it off. Maybe he was just shy.  

I crouched down, forcing a smile. “Hey, buddy. You must be Elias.”  

He nodded.  

No delivery van. No social worker. No car engine rumbling in the distance. Nothing.  

He had just appeared.  

Standing there, waiting for me.  

I should have closed the door.  

But instead, I stepped aside and said—  

""Come in.""  

At first, it was fine.  

Elias was polite. Too polite. He didn’t throw tantrums, didn’t beg for toys or TV. He never even asked for food—I had to remind him to eat.  

Most kids his age were full of energy, but Elias? He just… sat there. Quiet. Staring. Watching.  

The first time I felt true unease was when my best friend, Lisa, came over a few days later.  

We were sitting in the living room, chatting over coffee, when Elias shuffled in.  

I smiled. “Hey, buddy. Do you want to say hi to Lisa?”  

Lisa’s expression didn’t change. She just took a sip of her coffee.  

I cleared my throat. “Lisa?”  

She blinked at me. “What?”  

I frowned. “Elias. I was asking if he wanted to say hi.”  

Lisa’s brows knitted together. She glanced around the room, confused.  

“Who?”  

I stared at her.  

I looked at Elias.  

He was standing right there.  

But Lisa’s eyes passed through him like he wasn’t real.  

A cold chill rushed through me.  

I let out a nervous laugh. “Very funny.”  

Lisa set her mug down. “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”  

I turned to Elias. My throat felt dry. “Elias, say something.”  

He tilted his head.  

His voice was quiet. Hollow.  

""She can’t see me.""  

The air shifted.  

Lisa shivered. “It just got cold in here,” she muttered. “Are you feeling okay? You look pale.”  

I forced a nod. “Yeah. Yeah, I just… never mind.”  

Lisa changed the subject, talking about something at work, but I wasn’t listening.  

I was watching Elias.  

He was smiling at me.  

A smile that didn’t belong on a child’s face.  

A knowing smile.  

A smile that said:  

""You see me. That’s all that matters.""  

I didn’t bring up the incident with Lisa again.  

Maybe I was just tired. Maybe it was a weird joke I wasn’t in on. I told myself anything to keep from admitting the truth—that Elias wasn’t normal.  

But ignoring it didn’t help.  

Because Elias knew things he shouldn’t.  

It started small. One morning, I was drinking coffee, scrolling through my phone, when he spoke without looking up from his book.  

""Your boss is going to call in three minutes.""  

I blinked. “What?”  

He turned a page. “He’ll say you need to cover for Mark. Mark is sick.”  

I opened my mouth to argue, to ask how the hell he would know that—  

Then my phone rang.  

I stared at the screen.  

My boss.  

My skin crawled.  

I let it go to voicemail. My hands were cold and clammy as I turned to Elias. “How did you—”  

He just smiled.  

Like he’d been waiting for me to ask.  

""I just know.""  

The way he said it… so calm. So sure.  

Like he knew other things too.  

Things I didn’t want to hear.  

The next time I tried to ignore the truth, it came back in a worse way.  

It was late. Too late. I should have been asleep, but something about the house felt wrong.  

Like the walls were listening.  

I picked up my phone and scrolled through the gallery—just to distract myself. I had taken a few pictures of Elias in the past week. Just normal things. Him reading. Sitting by the window. Looking at the TV.  

But as I flicked through them, my stomach dropped.  

He wasn’t there. 

Picture after picture—empty rooms.  

The chair where he had been sitting? Empty.  

The window where he had been watching the rain? No one there.  

My chest tightened. I felt like I was going to be sick.  

I knew I had taken those photos. I knew he had been there.  

I scrolled faster, fingers shaking—  

And then—  

The very last photo wasn’t one I had taken.  

It was a selfie of me.  

Lying in bed.  

Fast asleep.  

And in the background, standing right by my head—  

Was Elias.  

His face too close.  

His eyes wide open.  

And his lips—almost touching my ear.  

Like he had been whispering something to me in my sleep.  

My heart slammed against my ribs. I dropped the phone like it burned.  

I whipped around—but Elias was already standing in the doorway.  

Watching me.  

Smiling.  

“You don’t need pictures to remember me.”  

His voice was soft. Too soft.  

Like he was already inside my head. 

I stopped taking photos after that night. Stopped asking questions. Stopped trying to convince myself that Elias was a normal child. Because he wasn’t. I knew that now. I didn’t know what he was, but he wasn’t a boy. Not really. He played the part well—sat at the kitchen table like any other kid, turned the pages of his books, tilted his head when I spoke to him—but there was something off about the way he moved, the way his dark eyes never quite blinked at the right times. I started to notice how he never coughed, never sneezed, never even sniffled. His clothes never got dirty. His hair never seemed to grow. It was like he was stuck in a loop of himself, repeating a version of what a child should be.  

But it was the whispering at night that broke me.  

It started as faint murmurs, just beyond the edge of my hearing. I’d lie in bed, exhausted, staring at the ceiling, and there it was—a hushed voice slipping through the walls like a draft. At first, I thought it was the wind, or maybe the pipes settling, but the more I listened, the more I realized that it was words. Low, steady. Murmuring something just beneath understanding, something that sounded so close to my ear that I’d whip around, expecting to see Elias standing there in the dark. But he never was. The house would be still, empty, as though nothing had ever been wrong.  

Until I woke up one night, and he was standing right next to my bed.  

I don’t know what time it was. The room was pitch-black except for the glow of the streetlamp bleeding through the curtains. I woke up because I felt something. A presence. A pressure in the air, thick and heavy, curling around my throat. My body went rigid before my brain even caught up, before I even realized I wasn’t alone.  

Elias was there. Inches from my face.  

Not moving. Not speaking. Just watching.  

His eyes were wide, too wide, reflecting the dim light like an animal’s. His small, pale hands were at his sides, unmoving, perfectly still. For a long, suffocating moment, neither of us spoke. I couldn’t. My throat locked up, and my body screamed at me to run, but I couldn’t move. It was like my limbs weren’t mine anymore.  

And then—he leaned down.  

His lips brushed against my ear.  

And in a voice that was so much older than a child’s, so much deeper than it should have been, he whispered:  

""I know where you go when you dream.""  

The air in my lungs vanished. I lurched back, scrambling against the headboard, my heart pounding violently. But Elias? He just straightened up and smiled, the same eerie, calm smile that did not belong to a child.  

Then, without another word, he turned and walked out of my room.  

I sat there for hours, clutching the blankets, afraid to close my eyes. Afraid of what he meant.  

Afraid of what I might see when I slept.  

I started keeping my bedroom door locked at night. Not that I thought it would make a difference. If Elias wanted to get in, I was certain he could. The lock was a symbol, nothing more—a flimsy, desperate attempt to pretend I still had some control over my own home. Over my own life.  

But things were getting worse.  

Rooms felt bigger than they should. I’d walk into the kitchen and, for a split second, the space stretched, the walls seeming to pull farther away as though I had just stepped into something else entirely. The mirrors in the house became wrong. I avoided them after I caught a glimpse of my reflection one morning—because for the briefest moment, the me in the mirror didn’t move at the same time I did. I turned my head, but my reflection was just a beat too slow. I stepped away from the sink and saw, in the corner of my eye, that my mirror-self was still staring directly at me.  

And Elias was always watching.  

His gaze was impossible to ignore. It wasn’t the normal, absent-minded stare of a child. It was deep, searching, like he was looking through me, past me, inside me. Like he knew everything. And every time I met his gaze, I felt the overwhelming, suffocating urge to look away first.  

Then I found the door.  

It was a Tuesday afternoon. I was cleaning, trying to keep myself busy, trying to ignore the fact that I had stopped talking to anyone outside my house because what would I say? That I had adopted a child who didn’t exist? That I wasn’t sure if I was losing my mind, or if something much worse was happening to me?  

That’s when I noticed it.  

The door in the hallway.  

A door I had never seen before.  

I stopped cold. My heart thudded violently in my chest as I stared at it. It wasn’t new. It wasn’t like someone had built it overnight—it looked old, just as old as the rest of the house, with peeling paint and a brass knob that was so cold to the touch that it burned my fingertips.  

But it had never been there before.  

I was sure of it.  

I turned, calling over my shoulder, “Elias?”  

No answer.  

I turned the knob. Locked.  

I rattled it harder. It did not budge.  

That’s when I noticed the whispering.  

The same whispering I heard at night.  

But this time—  

It was coming from behind the door.  

A single, hushed voice. Low, steady. Waiting.  

The house felt wrong, the walls pressing closer. The whispering grew louder. My breath hitched as I pressed my ear against the wood—  

And I realized something horrible.  

It wasn’t one voice.  

It was many.  

All whispering at once.  

All saying my name.  

I stumbled back, heart pounding, slamming my hands over my ears, but the whispering was inside my head now, crawling under my skin, filling my lungs. I turned away, panic coiling in my stomach.  

And that’s when I saw Elias standing at the end of the hallway.  

Watching.  

His eyes were black now. Completely black.  
A slow, knowing smile stretched across his lips.  

And then he spoke.  

""You shouldn’t have found that.""  

I didn’t sleep that night.  

I locked my bedroom door, sat on the bed with my back against the wall, and waited. I could still hear the whispering, faint now, muffled behind the old wooden door in the hallway. But it wasn’t gone—just waiting, like it knew I was listening.  

Elias never went to bed.  

I didn’t hear him move, didn’t hear his door open or his small footsteps on the floorboards. But I knew he was awake. I could feel him somewhere in the house, watching, waiting, just like the whispers.  

By the time morning came, I had made up my mind.  

I had to open that door.  

I don’t know why. It was a horrible idea. I knew it was a horrible idea. But some part of me felt like I had already crossed a line, like pretending everything was fine wasn’t going to work anymore. Something inside my home had changed, and ignoring it was letting it grow stronger.  

I grabbed a screwdriver from the kitchen drawer. My hands were unsteady, my breath uneven, but I forced myself forward, one slow step at a time, until I was standing in front of the door again.  

It looked the same as yesterday. Peeling paint. Old brass knob. Ice-cold to the touch. But as I stood there, I realized something was different.  

The whispering had stopped.  

Not faded. Not lessened.  

Stopped completely.  

The silence was thick, unnatural. It felt like the whole house was holding its breath, watching me.  

I gripped the screwdriver, jammed it between the door and the frame, and twisted—forcing the lock to snap with a sharp crack.  

The door swung open.  

I stared inside.  

And my mind refused to understand what I was seeing.  

It wasn’t a room. Not really.  

It was a space, too deep, too dark, stretching farther than the house should allow. The floor was black, glossy, reflecting the dim hallway light like wet glass. The walls pulsed, alive, shifting in slow, rhythmic movements like something breathing.  

And in the center of the room—  

There was a bed.  

My bed.  

I stepped forward before I could stop myself, my breath sharp in my throat.  

It was identical—same sheets, same pillows, same imprint of my body on the mattress.  

The realization hit me all at once.  

This wasn’t just any bed.  

It was the bed I had slept in last night.  

I took a shaky step back. The air in the room was thick, heavy, wrong, like walking through water. My vision blurred for a second, and when it cleared, I noticed—  

There was someone lying in the bed.  

A figure. Curled up under the blankets.  

Facing away from me.  

I didn’t move. I didn’t breathe. My body was frozen, every part of me screaming to run, to slam the door shut, to never come back.  

But then—  

The figure in the bed twitched.  

The blankets shifted, and I saw a glimpse of pale skin. Dark hair.  

My stomach dropped.  

Because I knew who it was.  

It was me.  

I stumbled back, slamming into the hallway wall. My vision swam, my brain refusing to process what I was looking at.  

The me in the bed shifted again—slowly, painfully, like something trying to wake up.  

And then—  

It turned its head toward me.  

I didn’t see its face.  

I didn’t want to.  

I threw myself backward into the hall, slamming the door shut so hard the walls shook. I locked it—once, twice, three times—then stumbled away, gasping for breath, hands shaking violently.  

That’s when I heard Elias’s voice.  

Calm. Amused.  

""I told you not to open it.""  

I don’t remember going to bed that night. I don’t remember eating, or drinking, or even thinking. I just remember sitting in the kitchen, staring at the table, trying not to exist.  

Because I had seen something I wasn’t supposed to see.  

Something that should not have been real.  

But the house didn’t care.  

It moved on without me.  

I barely noticed as the daylight faded, swallowed by the thick, oppressive darkness that had begun clinging to the house like mold. I was still sitting in the same chair when I realized—  

Elias was gone.  

I hadn’t seen him all day. No footsteps. No small voice echoing through the house.  

I should have been relieved.  

But the air felt wrong.  

Too still. Too expectant. Like the house was waiting for me to notice.  

And then, as if on cue—  

A soft creak came from the hallway.  

The door to my bedroom slowly swung open.  

My blood went cold.  

Because someone was standing there.  

Not Elias.  

Not some shadow in the dark.  

Me.  

I was standing in the doorway.  

Same hair. Same clothes. Same face.  

But it wasn’t me.  

I felt that instantly.  

The thing wearing my face tilted its head, just slightly.  

Then it smiled.  

And every part of me locked up with pure, overwhelming terror.  

It wasn’t just a smile.  

It was wrong.  

Stretched too wide. Too many teeth. Not human.  

And then it spoke—in my voice.  

""Why do you look so scared?""  

I ran.  

Didn’t think. Didn’t look back. Just bolted for the front door, my body moving before my mind could catch up. My hands fumbled with the locks, my breath coming in short, desperate gasps.  

Behind me, I heard it moving closer.  

Not walking.  

Slithering.  

Like something trying to figure out how to use my body.  

I yanked the door open and threw myself outside.  

The cold night air hit me like a slap, and for a moment, I thought—maybe I had escaped.  

Then I looked up.  

And my stomach dropped.  

Because the house wasn’t the same house anymore.  

The windows were wrong.  

The walls were too tall.  

And the sky above me was completely black.  

No stars. No moon.  

Just nothing.  

I had left the house.  

But I hadn’t left at all.  

I was somewhere else.  

Somewhere Elias had been leading me all along.  

And I had walked right into it.  

The air outside didn’t feel real.

It was cold, but not in the way winter was cold. There was no wind. No movement. The temperature was just wrong, like the absence of heat rather than the presence of cold. The sky above me stretched forever, an endless black void, thick and heavy like a ceiling pressing down. My house loomed behind me, but it wasn’t my house anymore. The roof was too high. The windows were too dark, too empty. The walls didn’t even seem to be made of wood anymore. They had shifted, something else pulsing beneath the surface like it was alive.

I shouldn’t have left.

I thought the door was an escape. I thought if I ran, if I just got outside, I’d be free. But now I understood— the house was never trapping me. It was guiding me.

It had been leading me here all along.

The world beyond the house wasn’t a neighborhood. There were no streets, no houses, no city. Just an endless field of black grass stretching into the distance. It moved slightly, even without wind, like something breathing just beneath the surface.

And at the center of it all—

Elias was waiting for me.

I spotted him standing just a few feet away, calm as ever, his dark eyes locked onto mine. He wasn’t afraid. He never had been. He looked at me like this was exactly where I was supposed to be, like I had finally arrived.

My breath hitched in my throat.

“…Where are we?”

Elias smiled, tilting his head just slightly.

""Home.""

I swallowed hard. “This isn’t home.” My voice came out thin, uncertain.

His expression didn’t change. “It is. You just don’t remember yet.”

A shiver crawled down my spine. “Elias… what are you?”

He blinked at me slowly, like I had asked the wrong question. Then, in that small, quiet voice, he said—

""I’m yours.""

Something about those two words made my stomach drop.

Because he wasn’t lying.

I didn’t remember when I started backing away. My feet moved on their own, stepping back toward the house—but as I did, I noticed something else.

A shape.

A figure standing in the dark.

Far away. Too far to make out the details. But the longer I looked, the more I realized— there were more than one.

There were hundreds.

Standing in the black grass. Silent. Watching. Waiting.

Some were tall. Some were small. Some hunched, their limbs too long, their heads tilted too far. But all of them were staring directly at me.

I felt sick.

I turned back to Elias. “I want to go home.”

He tilted his head the other way. Smiled.

""You are home.""

And then—

The figures in the field started moving.

I ran.

Didn’t think. Didn’t breathe. Just ran.

The moment the figures stepped forward, the world shifted. The black grass lurched, bending under their weight like something sinking into flesh. The air thickened, a low hum vibrating through the ground, crawling up my legs, squeezing my chest.

The house was wrong, but it was the only thing I recognized. The only place that still felt like mine, even if it wasn’t. Even if it never had been.

I sprinted toward it, my legs aching, the whispers behind me growing louder. I couldn’t make out words, but I felt them—crawling under my skin, slipping into my bones, trying to pull me backward.

Elias wasn’t running.

He was walking.

Slow. Steady.

Like he knew I wouldn’t get far.

I hit the porch at full speed, nearly collapsing against the door as I fumbled for the handle. It was hot. Too hot. My fingers burned, but I didn’t let go—I yanked it open and threw myself inside, slamming it shut just as something heavy slammed against it from the other side.

My body shook. I backed away, gasping for breath, heart hammering.

The whispers stopped.

Silence.

Then—

A single knock.

Soft. Gentle.

Like Elias was politely asking to come in.

I squeezed my eyes shut. No. No, no, no.

This wasn’t real. It couldn’t be real.

But when I opened my eyes, I saw something worse.

The house had changed again.

It wasn’t my home anymore. It was nothing but hallways.

Endless, twisting, stretching in every direction.

I turned sharply, my pulse pounding in my skull. The walls were covered in doors, old and rotting, some cracked open just enough to show darkness on the other side. The air was wrong, heavy with something thick and damp.

And then—

A sound.

Not from the door behind me.

From above.

I looked up.

And my breath stopped.

There were people on the ceiling.

Or rather— things that looked like people.

Dozens of them, their bodies stretched and bent, their arms too long, their jaws unhinged, eyes black and empty, staring down at me.

They didn’t move.

They just hung there, watching.

And then—

One of them smiled.

Slowly.

Like they had been waiting for me to see them.

I staggered backward. My pulse slammed against my ribs.

A whisper slithered through the room.

""You took him in.""

I turned violently, but there was no one there.

Just the hallways.

Just the endless, twisting doors.

Another whisper.

""He belongs to you now.""

The house shuddered.

The doors creaked open, just slightly, as if the house itself had exhaled.

And behind every door—

Something was moving.

I didn’t move.

I couldn’t.

The house shifted around me, groaning like it was alive. The whispers from the doors grew louder, wrapping around my skull, slithering inside me. My breath came in short, shallow gasps as the things on the ceiling continued to stare—unblinking, their stretched faces frozen in silent, awful smiles.

And then—

One of the doors swung open.

A crack at first. Then wider.

I didn’t want to look.

But my body did it for me.

The darkness inside wasn’t empty. It pulsed, alive, shifting like something was waiting just beneath the surface. A deep, slow breath exhaled from within—warm, damp, too human and not human at all.

And then, from inside that impossible blackness, something stepped forward.

It wasn’t Elias.

It was me.

The other me. The one I had seen in the bed. The one that had stared at me with dead, empty eyes before I slammed the door shut.

It moved with a slow, deliberate grace, its body slightly off, slightly wrong. Like it wasn’t used to wearing skin.

I took a shaking step back. My voice barely came out.

“…What are you?”

The other me smiled.

It was the same wrong stretching smile Elias had.

Then it spoke.

""I’m the part of you that never left.""

The house shuddered. The doors flew open, one after another, revealing rooms that should not exist.

Some of them had people inside.

People that looked like me.

Some of them were staring at the walls, muttering to themselves. Some were sleeping, their bodies twisted into unnatural angles, as if they had been laying there for centuries.

Some were watching me.

And then Elias stepped beside my other self, his wide black eyes unblinking.

""You never left."" His voice was soft. Final.

I shook my head violently. No. No, that wasn’t true.

I had a life before Elias. A job. A home. Friends.

I was real.

But when I tried to remember how I got here, when I tried to trace the days, the months, the years—

There was nothing.

A hole where my memories should be.

A space.

A void.

My other self stepped closer.

""You took me in."" It smiled. ""And now it’s time to let go.""

I staggered back, my heart hammering, my mind screaming at me to run.

But there was nowhere left to go.

And as I turned, I saw—

A door at the end of the hallway.

The only door that was still closed.

It wasn’t like the others. It wasn’t old or rotting. It was perfect. Smooth. Clean. And unlike the rest of the house, it felt…

Familiar.

I didn’t think.

I ran for it.

The whispers screamed, the figures on the ceiling lurched forward, Elias and my other self reached for me—

But I didn’t stop.

I threw myself at the door, grabbed the handle, and yanked it open.

And on the other side—

There was nothing but light.

The first thing I felt was air.

Real air.

Not the thick, unnatural stillness of the house, but a breeze—soft, warm, alive.

The second thing I felt was the sun.

Not the endless black sky. Not the crushing emptiness of the other world.

Just… light.

And then—

I woke up.

I gasped, my chest burning, my body cold and stiff like I had been asleep for too long. My vision was blurry, my mind sluggish.

But the moment I looked around, my breath caught in my throat.

I was in a hospital bed.

Machines beeped beside me. An IV dripped into my arm. The air smelled of antiseptic and something else—something old.

A doctor rushed to my side.

“Oh my God, you’re awake.” His voice was full of genuine shock. “We— we didn’t think you were going to come back.”

I stared at him, my heart racing. My mouth was dry. My voice barely worked.

“…How long?”

The doctor hesitated. His eyes darkened.

“You’ve been in a coma for almost six months.”

My stomach dropped.

I felt like I was falling.

Six months.

Six.

I tried to speak, but the words wouldn’t come. My brain was struggling to catch up. The doctor was saying something, something about an accident, about how I had been found unconscious in my home.

But none of it made sense.

Because I remembered now.

I remembered Elias.

I remembered the house that wasn’t a house.

I remembered my other self.

And I remembered the truth.

I hadn’t adopted Elias.

I hadn’t found him.

He had found me.

He had been waiting, lurking in the spaces between consciousness and something else. And when I had fallen into sleep, into the coma, he had finally been able to reach me.

To take me into his world.

To keep me.

But somehow—I had escaped.

The doctor was still speaking, but his words sounded far away. My heart was pounding.

Because I suddenly felt it again.

That familiar chill in the air.

That sense of being watched.

And as I turned my head, my stomach flipped.

The hospital window had a reflection.

And in the glass, standing right behind me—

Was Elias.

He smiled.

And whispered—

""You woke up this time.""

The monitor beside me flatlined.

The light in the room flickered.

And then—

Everything went black.",8,1738787672.0,nosleep,3,0.9,False
1iik30m,https://www.reddit.com/r/Adulting/comments/1iik30m/overwhelmed_by_perfectionism_and_constant_doubt/,Overwhelmed by Perfectionism and Constant Doubt,"
Hey Reddit,

I’ve been feeling genuinely overwhelmed by my own relentless strive for perfection, and it’s starting to get in the way of actually living. I overthink everything—what hobby to take on, which direction to go in creatively—and in the end, I just procrastinate until nothing happens.

I work remotely, which I prefer over going to the office (I tried it for a few months and realized I’m much better at home), but even then, I can’t shake the feeling that I might be missing out. Am I learning enough? Meeting the right people? Should I be pushing myself to be more present in some way?

I spent so much time striving for the “perfect job,” and when I didn’t get it, I landed where I am now—at a job that’s okay, good even. But doubt still creeps in. I keep wondering: Is this really the right fit for me?

On paper, my life is good. I’m happily married to a wonderful husband. I genuinely show up for my friends and nurture those relationships. Still, I sometimes look at other people’s social lives—the ones with tight-knit girl groups—and wonder why my social circle doesn’t look like that anymore. I have individual friends of my own who I see over coffee, drinks here and there, but no girl group with who I go to roadtrips or do fun stuff. I’m almost 31, I still question whether it’s “acceptable,” as if life has some high score I’m supposed to hit in every area. 
 I’m a social, curious person who loves interesting, fun, and vulnerable people, but I just don’t know where to meet them in my 30s besides new job.

Family is another layer. I am an only child and my mom and cousins live in another town, and I only see them about once a month. I can’t help but wonder how life would feel if, like many of my friends, I had family nearby and maybe that would make me feel more grounded.

I keep falling into this cycle of picking apart the “imperfections” in my life and constantly asking myself what’s missing. And the truth is, I don’t really know what to do about it.


I work in the creative industry because I love creativity and hate monotony, but ironically, my life feels a little too monotone right now.

If anyone out there has been through something similar, I’d love to hear your thoughts. How did you break free from this mental loop of striving for some undefined version of “perfect”?

In December, I hosted a big family Christmas party on the 21st because my immediate family (husband and 2 kids)wanted a small, quiet Christmas. NMom was NOT pleased, but she showed up, bitching the whole time that this was NOT Christmas.  That night, She INFORMED me of when her next visit would be.  I told her calmly that it would not work for me, but maybe we could pick another weekend for a visit.  The dark cloud of anger emerged... and my parents left my house in a huff, ignoring my pleas of ""I love you,"" and began the silent treatment.  They ignored for a while, texting about the weather occasionally.  Then now, in February, I get this (while she is on vacation visiting GC).

The usual guilt trips: I'm not communicating, she's hurt, they've lost a daughter, I need to TELL her how to be a decent human being, etc. Yet they've done nothing to alleviate the situation or wonder maybe WHY we aren't talking.  Typical.

""First, I need to say how sorry I am that you and I are not communicating. I understand how upset you got with me. I dont know if this is affecting you or not, but you are not the only one. Both your father and I feel like we have lost a daughter. I know I need to change how I act or speak, and the best one to tell me how to stop controlling and being what you want is you!I miss you, and love you so much, that-it’s very hurtful, and maybe you feel the same way. I think the only way we can start over is to talk, and that doesn’t mean this email, but some time together without my precious grandchildren that I would like to see more often. So my question of the day, is to see if we could at least have a cup of coffee and talk. Would you entertain seeing me for an hour or so next week when I am nearby?  (Gives logistics of wanting to come from airport, which is the visiting time she originally asked for at Christmas that I said no to!) May I please drive down and have a cup of coffee with you before I drive back home? I think your house is more private than a coffee shop. Hope you agree.I hope that you will see me.

1iijxr3,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/1iijxr3/need_advice_first_interview_since_layoff_waiting/,Need advice: First interview since layoff; waiting on decision to hire.,"I am a perma lurker on reddit so forgive me if this is long winded. 

This is my first interview since I got laid off and first one in over a year. It is for an equity research analyst position. I am throwing my background at the bottom if you want details. This is a company I really want to work at and a role I feel I can excel in. My only drawback is experience.

* >!I got a phone screening three weeks ago and was told it was more or less a check box on their end. The next day, I was scheduled for an interview in a week with a director and a senior analyst. !<
* >!I showed up for the interview and was joined by a VP who is also hiring on his team. The director had an emergency about halfway through the interview and left. Still, felt really good about the interview. I was told they would reach out next week for another interview with more senior management.  !<
* >!The next morning I sent out thank you emails to all my interviewers, who shortly got back to me mentioning they enjoyed the chat and I would hear back from HR regarding next steps. When HR did, instead of an interview, I was given a case assignment that was due in 6 days. I got it done over the weekend and sent it to HR at 8 AM Monday and also let my interviewers know I had submitted it. !<
* >!The day after I submitted, HR got back and said the team was impressed and wanted to schedule me for a final interview at the end of the week to discuss my case and some behavioral questions. This round was with a senior associate and analyst. !<
* >!At this point, I noticed that the interview invite changed the position to an associate position, which is no shock given my 0 experience in a role like this. !<
* >!In the interview, we did not discuss the case unless I prompted it. While I felt I was not as strong as I was in the previous interview, it was good. Lots of discussion about the available roles and my preference and asking a lot of open ended questions to spark conversation. The interviewers let me know I would hear back soon, but no specific date, and now I feel stupid for not asking. I sent out thank you emails to these interviewers a few hours later, who did not reply (granted it was a friday afternoon). !<

Thus far, I went from initial screening to final round interview in two weeks. Maybe I am overly optimistic, but I started to get it in my head that my chances of landing one of the two roles were getting higher and higher. 

Fast forward to this week, It has been 3 business days since the final interview. I am probably being naive, but I was hoping to hear something back either Monday or Tuesday. Today I sent out an email to the HR representative, which I realize might be too soon, but I got hit with an out of office.

On the company glassdoor, some applicants made it to the final round, only be ghosted. Now I feel I am not their top candidate or that they are still screening other applicants. I noticed they reposted the original position I was applying for. At this point, I am just anxious and struggling. I really need a job again, and while I should not be picky, I want to land a role that helps with my career aspirations. I am deathly afraid of getting ghosted at this point. If anyone has suggestions/insights/anecdotes, PLEASE share.  

**TL;DR: First interview at ideal role/company since layoff and first one in over a year. Have not heard back yet, am I cooked or just way too anxious?**

If you want to read my background: 

>!I am a recent graduate (BCoM, finance and data sci), unfortunately, while in my undergraduate I did not build up the right foundation to land a big internship at a bank etc. In my final year I did get lucky and landed an internship at a small commodity brokerage doing BD. I was eventually given a full-time offer, right around my graduation, to be a broker. Fastforward 8 months, due to a number of factors, my team underwent a ""restructuring"". I got laid off alongside our new VP of Sales. !<

>!I was not too upset by this since I had my CFA level 1 exam in 4 weeks (I passed) and honestly, really hated what I was doing. By this point I had already been networking extensively. Every chat I had I tried to get two or more introductions out of it. As a result I was able to connect with many professionals in my city. Throughout my networking process, I really began to lean towards pivoting into ER. I was able to land this interview largely in part due to a coffee chat with an MD.!<",0,1738787290.0,FinancialCareers,3,0.5,False

The sharp sound of Nuria’s voice cut through the silence of the early morning like a blade.

""Timmy! Get up! NOW!""

Tim jolted awake, disoriented. His heart was still heavy with sleep, his mind struggling to catch up. He turned towards the clock—5:00 AM. The world outside was still dark, wrapped in the quiet hush of dawn.

""What…?"" he mumbled, blinking rapidly.

""Did I stutter?!"" Nuria stormed into the room, her face twisted in frustration. ""You need to get to my mother’s house. She needs help today.""

Tim rubbed his eyes, his brain still sluggish. ""Wait… what? Right now?""

Nuria’s hands slammed against her hips. ""YES, Timmy. Get dressed, get in your car, and GO.""

""But… what does she need help with?"" he asked, still groggy, trying to understand why he was being sent away before the sun had even risen.

Nuria let out an exasperated sigh as if he were the most frustrating person on Earth. ""Does it matter? You’ll do whatever she tells you to do. But for now, you can start by cleaning her driveway. The hose and cleaning supplies are in the shed.""

Tim hesitated, still not fully awake, and that hesitation infuriated her.

""MOVE!"" she barked. ""I gave you all the instructions you need. Get to work!""

There was no room for argument. No space for questions. Just orders.

Still rubbing the sleep from his eyes, Tim dragged himself out of bed, threw on some clothes, and grabbed his car keys.

At Eva’s House

The drive was quiet, the streets eerily empty in the dim morning light. Tim’s head was still heavy with exhaustion as he pulled into the driveway of Nuria’s mother, Eva. The house was dark—no lights on, no sign of movement inside.

She was still asleep, just like Nuria had said.

Tim sighed. He hadn't even met Eva that many times, but what he did know was that she wasn’t exactly the warmest person. In fact, he wasn’t entirely sure if she even liked him.

He stepped out of the car and walked toward the small wooden shed at the side of the house. The air was cold, and the grass was damp beneath his shoes. He pushed open the door and fumbled around in the dim space, looking for the hose, the brush, and the cleaning solution.

After a few minutes, he found everything he needed and set to work.

At first, it was mindless labor. Spraying down the driveway, scrubbing at the stubborn patches of dirt, watching the grime wash away beneath the stream of water. It was tedious, slow, exhausting work.

An hour passed.

Then another.

By the time it was 9:00 AM, Tim was drenched in sweat despite the morning chill. His arms ached. His back was sore. And he was nowhere near finished.

That’s when he saw her.

Eva.

She stood just inside the house, behind the large front window, watching him.

Tim straightened up slightly and gave her a small, polite wave. A friendly gesture.

But she didn’t wave back.

She didn’t smile.

She didn’t acknowledge him at all.

She just stared.

Her expression was unreadable—cold, distant, unreadable. It made Tim's stomach tighten with discomfort.

He hesitated for a second, unsure of what to do.

But then, slowly, he turned back to the driveway… and kept working.

 

By the time Tim finished scrubbing the driveway, his entire body was aching. His arms felt heavy, his back tight and sore, and his clothes were damp from sweat. He checked his phone—9:30 AM. He had been working non-stop for over four hours.

Maybe now I can take a small break, he thought. Maybe even get some coffee…

He stepped up to the front door, took a deep breath, and knocked lightly before pushing it open.

Inside, the house was dead silent. No music, no television, nothing. Just the faint ticking of a clock somewhere in the background.

Eva sat in an armchair near the window, a steaming cup of coffee in her hands. She was dressed immaculately, her hair pulled back into a severe bun. She looked up when Tim entered but didn’t say a word.

Tim forced a polite smile. ""Good morning, Eva.""

Silence.

""Uh… how are you?"" he tried again.

She took a slow sip of her coffee before finally speaking, her voice cool and detached. ""You're finished outside?""

Tim nodded. ""Yes, I cleaned the whole driveway. The hose is put away, and—""

""Good,"" she interrupted, setting her cup down on the table beside her. ""Now, I want you to vacuum the entire house. When you're done, you’ll mop the floors. I don’t want to be disturbed unless you have a question about your task.""

Tim’s stomach sank.

He had hoped—foolishly hoped—that she might at least offer him a seat for a moment. Maybe a drink, or just a few minutes to catch his breath. But there was no kindness in her tone. No appreciation. Just orders.

Before he could even think of responding, Eva continued.

""Nuria told me you’d be spending the entire day here, helping. And I intend to make full use of that time.""

Tim swallowed hard.

The entire day?

Nuria had never said anything about that.

He hesitated for a moment, wondering if he should say something. Maybe try to explain that he had only planned to help for a few hours.

But then Eva leaned back in her chair, her sharp gaze settling on him. ""You should start quickly, Timmy. There's plenty more work to do.""

Tim’s jaw tightened at the use of his nickname—the same one Nuria always used in that condescending tone. He hated it.

Still, he didn’t argue.

With a small nod, he turned and headed towards the hallway, searching for the vacuum cleaner.

It was going to be a long day.

 

By midday, Tim’s stomach was growling loudly. He had been working nonstop since 5:00 AM, and the thought of food was the only thing keeping him going. Eva, who had been silently observing him from her armchair, finally spoke up.

“Wash your hands,” she said curtly, not looking up from her book. “Then come back here.”

Tim blinked, surprised by the sudden instruction. “Uh, okay,” he said, heading to the kitchen sink to scrub his hands. When he returned, Eva handed him a piece of paper with a detailed recipe written on it.

“You’re going to make this,” she said, her tone leaving no room for discussion. “It’s a pasta dish with chicken and vegetables. “

Tim’s eyes lit up as he scanned the recipe. *Finally, something to eat,* he thought, his stomach growling again. “Thank you, Eva. I’ll get started right away.”

Eva nodded and returned to her book, while Tim headed to the kitchen. He gathered the ingredients and began preparing the meal, doing his best to follow the recipe exactly. Eva occasionally glanced over at him, her sharp eyes watching his every move. Tim felt a bit nervous under her scrutiny but tried to focus on the task at hand.

As the aroma of garlic, herbs, and sizzling chicken filled the kitchen, Tim’s spirits lifted. He hummed softly to himself as he stirred the sauce and boiled the pasta. *This actually smells really good,* he thought, proud of his efforts. When everything was ready, he plated two generous servings and set them on the table.

“Eva, lunch is ready,” he said, gesturing to the plates.

Eva looked up from her book and raised an eyebrow. “What are you doing?” she asked, her voice laced with amusement.

Tim frowned, confused. “Uh, I made lunch. Like you asked.”

Eva let out a short, mocking laugh. “Did Nuria not pack you any food for today?” she asked, her tone dripping with sarcasm. “Like a little child with a lunchbox?”

Tim’s face flushed with embarrassment. “No, she didn’t,” he said quietly. “I thought this was for both of us.”

Eva shook her head, still smirking. “Well, it’s not. But let’s see what Nuria has to say about this.” She pulled out her phone and dialed Nuria’s number, putting it on speaker.

After a few rings, Nuria answered. “Hey, Mom! What’s up?”

“Nuria, did you pack any food for Tim today?” Eva asked, her tone sharp.

There was a brief pause on the other end of the line. “Of course I did!” Nuria replied, her voice sweet and innocent. “I made him something delicious, but he must have forgotten to bring it. Silly Timmy!”

Tim’s jaw dropped. “That’s not true!” he blurted out. “You were still asleep when I left! You didn’t give me anything!”

Eva’s eyes narrowed, and her voice turned icy. “Are you calling my daughter a liar?”

“No, I—” Tim stammered, but Eva cut him off.

“Nuria doesn’t lie,” Eva said firmly. “If you didn’t bring your food, that’s your problem. You’ll just have to go without.”

Tim could hear Nuria giggling on the other end of the line. His face burned with humiliation, but before he could say anything else, Nuria spoke up again.

“Mom, why don’t you let Timmy join you at the table?” Nuria suggested, her tone playful. “But since he didn’t bring his food, maybe he can work while you eat. He gives *amazing* foot massages, you know.”

Eva’s eyes lit up at the suggestion. “Is that so?” she said, a sly smile spreading across her face. “Well, that sounds like a wonderful idea.”

Tim’s heart sank. *This can’t be happening,* he thought. But before he could protest, Eva ended the call and turned to him.

“Under. the. table,” she commanded, pointing to the space beneath her feet. “Take off my socks and give me the best foot massage you’ve ever given. And don’t even think about slacking off.”

Tim hesitated, his mind racing. But Eva’s cold stare left no room for argument. Reluctantly, he knelt down and crawled under the table. He carefully removed Eva’s socks, trying to ignore the sinking feeling in his stomach.

As he began massaging her feet, Eva picked up her fork and started eating the pasta he had prepared. “Mmm, this is actually quite good,” she said, taking another bite. “But your hands could use a bit more pressure, Timmy. Don’t be shy.”

Tim clenched his jaw and increased the pressure, his hands moving methodically over Eva’s feet. The smell of the pasta wafted down to him, making his stomach growl even louder. He tried to focus on the task at hand, but the humiliation and hunger were almost too much to bear.

Eva, meanwhile, seemed to be enjoying herself immensely. “You know, Nuria was right,” she said between bites. “You *are* good at this. Maybe I should have you over more often.”

Tim didn’t respond. He just kept massaging, his mind a whirlwind of frustration and resignation. *This is going to be the longest day of my life,* he thought, as Eva continued to eat and critique his technique.

After Eva finished her meal, she leaned back in her chair, letting out a satisfied sigh. “That was delicious,” she said, glancing down at Tim, who was still massaging her feet under the table. “You can keep going for a while longer, Timmy. I’m not done relaxing yet.”

Tim’s hands were sore, but he didn’t dare stop. He continued working, his fingers pressing into the arches of Eva’s feet as she hummed contentedly. The clock on the wall ticked loudly, each second dragging on as Tim’s frustration grew. *This isn’t fair,* he thought. *I’ve been working nonstop since 5:00 AM, and she’s treating me like some kind of servant.*

After what felt like an eternity, Eva finally spoke again. “Alright, that’s enough of a break,” she said, pulling her feet away from Tim’s hands.

Tim blinked in disbelief. *A break?* he thought. *I’ve been working all day!* But he didn’t say anything. Instead, he crawled out from under the table and stood up, his knees aching from kneeling for so long.

“Now,” Eva said, her tone businesslike, “I need you to take apart all the old furniture in Nuria’s room. It’s hard work, but I’m sure that won’t be a problem for you, Timmy.”

Tim hesitated. “Uh, sure. But do you have any tools I can use? A screwdriver or something?”

Eva waved her hand dismissively. “Figure it out. The tools should be in the shed. And don’t take too long—I’ll be checking on you.”

Tim nodded reluctantly and headed outside to the shed. It took him a while to find the tools he needed, but eventually, he returned to the house and made his way to Nuria’s old room. The furniture was heavy and outdated, and Tim quickly realized this was going to be a much bigger job than he’d anticipated.

As he worked, Eva occasionally appeared in the doorway, watching him with a critical eye. “Make sure you don’t damage the floor,” she said during one of her visits. “And don’t leave any nails lying around. I don’t want to step on one.”

Tim bit back a sarcastic reply and simply nodded. His throat was dry, and he realized he hadn’t had anything to drink all day. “Eva, could I maybe get some water?” he asked, trying to sound polite.

Eva raised an eyebrow. “You should have thought of that earlier,” she said coldly. “You should have brought your own water. It’s not my job to take care of you.”

Tim sighed and went back to work, his mouth feeling like sandpaper. A little while later, Eva returned, this time carrying a glass of water. She took a large sip, draining nearly half the glass in one go. Tim watched her enviously, his throat burning with thirst.

“Can I… have some of that?” he asked hesitantly.

Eva paused, then smirked. She spat the water from her mouth back into the glass, her eyes never leaving Tim’s. “Sure. You can have it.”

Tim stared at the glass, his stomach churning. “Uh… thanks,” he said weakly, taking the glass from her. Eva continued to watch him, her expression unreadable.

“You could stand to be a little more grateful!” she said as Tim raised the glass to his lips. “I’m being very generous here.”

Tim forced himself to drink the water, trying to ignore the fact that it had just been in Eva’s mouth. The entire time, Eva stared at him, her gaze making him feel even more uncomfortable. When he finished, she took the glass back without a word and left the room.

By 6:00 PM, Tim was exhausted. His arms ached from dismantling furniture, and his head was pounding from dehydration. Just as he was about to ask if he could take a break, Eva appeared in the doorway again.

“It’s time for sandwiches,” she announced. “Come to the kitchen. You should be thankful.. I’m giving you something to eat.”

Tim followed her, his stomach growling at the thought of food. When they reached the kitchen, Eva gestured to a loaf of bread and a few basic ingredients on the counter. “Make yourself something to eat,” she said. “But don’t take too long. You still have work to do.”

Tim stared at the meager ingredients, his frustration bubbling over. “Eva, I’ve been working all day,” he said, his voice trembling. “I’m exhausted. Can’t I just sit down and eat for a few minutes?”

Eva’s eyes narrowed. “You’re here to help, Timmy. Not to lounge around. Now, make your sandwich and get back to work.”

Tim clenched his fists but didn’t argue. He quickly assembled a simple sandwich and ate it standing up, his eyes fixed on the floor. Eva watched him the entire time, her arms crossed and her expression stern.

When he finished, she handed him a trash bag. “Take this to the curb,” she said. “And then get back to Nuria’s room. I want everything done by tonight.”

Tim took the bag without a word and headed outside, his mind racing. *This is insane,* he thought. *I can’t keep doing this.* But as he tossed the bag into the trash bin, he realized he didn’t have a choice.

 

By 10:00 PM, Tim had finally finished dismantling and removing all the old furniture from Nuria’s room. His arms felt like lead, and his back ached from hours of heavy lifting. He wiped the sweat from his forehead and leaned against the wall, taking a moment to catch his breath. *Finally, it’s done,* he thought, relieved.

But his relief was short-lived. Eva appeared in the doorway, holding a piece of paper in her hand. She handed it to Tim without a word. He took it and glanced down, his heart sinking as he read the list of tasks written in neat, precise handwriting.

1. Clean the windows in the living room and kitchen.
2. Organize the storage room.
3. Vacuum and mop the entire house again.
4. Take out all the trash and recycling.
5. Polish the wooden furniture in the dining room.

Tim’s eyes widened. “Eva, this is going to take at least four more hours,” he said, his voice tinged with desperation. “It’s already 10:00 PM. Do I really have to do all of this tonight?”

Eva crossed her arms and gave him a stern look. “Of course you do,” she said firmly. “These tasks need to be completed before you leave. I don’t want to hear any excuses, Timmy. Just get to work.”

Tim opened his mouth to argue, but Eva’s icy glare silenced him. He sighed and nodded, clutching the list in his hand. *This is never going to end,* he thought, dragging himself toward the living room to start on the windows.

As he worked, his phone buzzed in his pocket. He pulled it out and saw a message from Nuria.

Nuria: *Hey Timmy, when are you coming home? My feet are waiting for their massage.*

Tim stared at the message, his frustration bubbling over. He typed out a reply, his fingers moving quickly.

Tim: *I’m still at your mom’s house. I’ve been working nonstop since 5:00 AM. There’s no way I’ll be done anytime soon. This isn’t my fault—it’s your mom’s.*

A few moments later, his phone buzzed again.

Nuria: *Don’t blame my mom, Timmy! You should have planned your time better. This is on you.*

Tim’s jaw tightened as he read the message. *Unbelievable,* he thought. He quickly typed back.

Tim: *Nuria, your mom gave me a massive list of tasks. I’ve been working all day, and she won’t let me leave until everything’s done. I’m not exaggerating—this is going to take hours.*

Nuria’s reply came almost instantly.

Nuria: *Well, that’s not my problem. You’ll just have to figure it out. And don’t think you’re getting out of giving me a foot massage tomorrow. I’ll make sure you make up for this.*

Tim groaned and shoved his phone back into his pocket. He turned to Eva, who was standing in the doorway, watching him with her usual cold expression.

“Eva, please,” he said, his voice pleading. “It’s late. Can’t I just go home and finish this tomorrow?”

Eva shook her head. “No,” she said firmly. “The work needs to be done tonight. I don’t want to hear another word about it.”

Tim clenched his fists, his frustration reaching its breaking point. But he knew arguing with Eva was pointless. She wasn’t going to budge. Reluctantly, he turned back to the windows and continued cleaning, his movements slow and deliberate.

As he worked, his mind raced. *How did I end up in this situation?* he wondered. *Nuria and her mom are treating me like some kind of slave. I can’t keep doing this.* But deep down, he knew he didn’t have a choice—at least not yet.

The hours dragged on, and Tim worked through the list of tasks, his exhaustion growing with each passing minute. By the time he finished polishing the dining room furniture, it was well past midnight. He stumbled into the living room, where Eva was sitting in her armchair, reading a book.

“I’m done,” he said, his voice barely above a whisper. “Can I go home now?”

Eva looked up from her book and nodded. “Finally,” she said, her tone dismissive. “You can leave. But don’t forget—Nuria is expecting you to make up for tonight tomorrow. I suggest you don’t keep her waiting.”

Tim didn’t respond. He simply grabbed his jacket and walked out the door, his body and mind completely drained. As he got into his car and drove home, he couldn’t shake the feeling of dread that hung over him. *Tomorrow is going to be just as bad,* he thought. *Maybe even worse.*

 

Tim stumbled through the front door of the house well past midnight, his body heavy with exhaustion. His eyes burned, his muscles ached, and all he wanted was to collapse into bed and sleep for a week. But as he stepped inside, his heart sank. The house was a complete disaster.

The living room looked like a tornado had swept through it. Clothes were strewn across the floor, empty chip bags and candy wrappers littered the couch, and Nuria’s dinner plate sat on the table, still covered in crumbs and sauce stains. The kitchen wasn’t any better—dirty dishes were piled high in the sink, and the trash can overflowed with garbage. It was as if Nuria had gone out of her way to make as big a mess as possible.

Tim groaned, running a hand through his hair. *This is unbelievable,* he thought. *She didn’t lift a finger all day, and now I have to clean this up too?*

His eyes fell on a note left on the table. He picked it up and read it, his frustration growing with every word.

“Before you go to sleep, clean this up! And don’t forget—you still owe me for today, Timmy! 😘 - Nuria”

Tim crumpled the note in his hand and tossed it onto the table. *Of course,* he thought bitterly. *Why would tonight be any different from the rest of the day?*

Too tired to argue, even in his own mind, Tim grabbed a trash bag and got to work. He picked up the empty chip bags, candy wrappers, and other trash, his movements slow and mechanical. He washed the dishes, wiped down the counters, and swept the floor, each task feeling like a monumental effort. The clock on the wall ticked loudly, reminding him just how late it was.

By the time he finished cleaning the living room and kitchen, it was nearly 2:00 AM. His eyes were barely staying open, and his body felt like it was about to give out. But as he walked down the hallway toward his room, he noticed another note taped to Nuria’s bedroom door. His stomach sank as he read it.

“My feet are still waiting for their goodnight kiss. Come in and give them one, but don’t you dare wake me up! - Nuria”

Tim stared at the note, his mind racing. *This is ridiculous,* he thought. *I’m not doing this. I’ll just tell her tomorrow that I did it. She’ll never know the difference.*

But as he turned to walk away, doubt crept in. *What if she does notice? What if she gets mad and makes my life even worse?* He hesitated, torn between his exhaustion and his fear of Nuria’s wrath.

Finally, with a heavy sigh, he pushed the door open and stepped into Nuria’s room. The room was dimly lit by the soft glow of a nightlight, and Nuria was sound asleep, her breathing slow and steady. Tim tiptoed over to the bed, careful not to make a sound. He gently lifted the blanket at the foot of the bed, revealing Nuria’s bare feet.

For a moment, he just stood there, staring at her feet. *This is so weird,* he thought. But he knew there was no way out of this. He leaned down and pressed a quick, light kiss to the top of each foot. As he kissed the second foot, Nuria stirred slightly, and her foot jerked upward, catching Tim square in the face.

“Ugh!” Tim muttered under his breath, stumbling back. He quickly dropped the blanket back over Nuria’s feet and crept out of the room, his face burning with embarrassment.

Back in his own room, Tim collapsed onto his bed, too tired to even change his clothes. His mind was a whirlwind of frustration, humiliation, and exhaustion, but he didn’t have the energy to dwell on it. Within seconds, he was asleep, his body finally giving in to the overwhelming fatigue.

I’ve had so many problems with my teeth ever since 2020 when I was put on medication for depression. 
I have spent over R9000 (about $500) on multiple fillings. I have been doing everything my dentist tells me to do. I brush my teeth circular motions for 2 minutes (I put a timer on), I floss and I ensure I floss underneath the gum lines too. Then I use mouthwash for 1 minute. (Brush and mouthwash x2 a day and floss in the evenings as I don’t eat breakfast.) I even go for a clean every 6 months and check up. 

I always get judged when I’m at the dentist like I don’t even brush my teeth or I’m some drug addict but I really try hard. It feels like a losing battle. Last week I lost my mouth guard which I need to replace ASAP and today I’ve noticed this massive cavity on my bottom right back tooth (on the side). I saw my dentist in October and that tooth was perfectly fine. 

It’s never ending. This month I even stopped some of the medication for my depression in the hopes that the dry mouth will stop at night. (Seroquel 25mg and seroquel XR 50mg)

In October I was quoted another R12000 ($650) to fix absolutely everything… 

I guess I just need some reassurance that one day this will stop as online says once cavities start, they will just keep happening… Any advice or encouraging words would be great (I’ve attached a pic of the MASSIVE cavity I found this morning)",2,1738787053.0,askdentists,4,1.0,False

I immediately got up and went to the bathroom to check for any lumps, I didn’t feel a lump but it does feel like there’s a lot of tissue in the area where I had the pain. My ob did an examination of both breast’s and shes not too worried about it and it just feels like I may have dense breasts. She also stated that she couldn’t feel a lump. Probably should have prefaced this by letting you know that my mother (53) was diagnosed with stage 3 breast cancer back in 2023. She beat it but sadly it came back summer 2024 and she passed away at the end of 2024. Due to my mother’s history my ob sent a referral to my towns breast clinic for a mammogram and ultrasound. They are scheduled for next Monday thankfully. My mind has been racing with thoughts of it being cancer and I’ve been having a hard time sleeping and also just existing. It’s been a week since the discovery of all this and the pain has stopped luckily BUT I noticed a dent where the pain was. It literally came out of no where. Of course checked Google and read so many scary things. I’m hoping that it’s nothing but I can’t help but worry due to my mother’s short battle with cancer. I’m a mom myself and I can’t imagine leaving my children and husband behind. The pain of losing a parent feels unbearable some days and I’m still in the thick of it all. If anyone has been through the same breast issues and can offer any piece of advice or good news it would be great. 

Also (hope this isn’t getting too long) wanted to share my ob’s clinical notes that were sent after our appointment. I kind of found it a little odd that during our appointment she stated there’s no limo just fibrous tissue but in her notes she added that there’s a mass several times. Am I not reading this correctly? lol wouldn’t be surprised if I wasn’t, I’m not the best when it comes to medical issues like this.

And in picture 5 and 6 why is cheolsu telling him to run away? For one moment we can think that the mold he is referring to is soo ae but what if it could be dohwa?

Haru was sad that nothing was going his way and I think he will have a lot of influence on dohwa's psyche. I think he will offer dohwa something.

So at face value this doesn’t look too bad. She’s being nice and polite. But firstly, what’s with the “you first” being all cutesy when she knew this was what she was going to say? Just validation seeking? 

Secondly, and far more importantly:

We have been talking for a month. A month in which she has been incredibly high maintenance with contact. Getting moody and passive aggressive with me if I don’t text back for almost one whole day. WE HADN’T EVEN MET YET. 

I told her I wasn’t a big texter and was much more about quality time in person; but made an extra effort for her because she was hot, cute, seemed fun, and had a lot of shared interests including weightlifting and our music tastes, which is important to me. You don’t get a lot of goth girls who like metalcore AND are obsessed with the gym. 

So yeah, lots of effort on my part. Constantly texting, voice notes, very long phone calls and video calls. Eventually we find a date that works for us both to meet up for an initial vibe check (yesterday), with her supposed to be coming round this Sunday. This is obviously not happening now. 

Sure, it’s fair enough that she doesn’t want to fuck someone who reminds her of her cousin, but did we REALLY need a month of non stop texting (and sexting btw), 10+ hours of phone and video calls, and driving an hour to meet up with her, plus two hours in the coffee shop for her to figure that out? 

I feel like I’ve had a massive amount of my time and effort wasted. She was also kind of cagey and jealous about other girls so I even stopped pursuing other options this whole time. And then there’s the validation seeking at the end and being upset that I was annoyed by the whole thing?

Yeah this is a rant, and she didn’t do anything crazy wrong here, but I just need to know that I’m not overreacting or being a dick because this is an extremely annoying thing to do. ",0,1738786778.0,Nicegirls,93,0.28,False

1iijnkv,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/1iijnkv/overwhelmed_by_perfectionism_and_constant_doubt/,Overwhelmed by Perfectionism and Constant Doubt,"
Hey Reddit,

I’ve been feeling genuinely overwhelmed by my own relentless strive for perfection, and it’s starting to get in the way of actually living. I overthink everything—what hobby to take on, which direction to go in creatively—and in the end, I just procrastinate until nothing happens.

I work remotely, which I prefer over going to the office (I tried it for a few months and realized I’m much better at home), but even then, I can’t shake the feeling that I might be missing out. Am I learning enough? Meeting the right people? Should I be pushing myself to be more present in some way?

I spent so much time striving for the “perfect job,” and when I didn’t get it, I landed where I am now—at a job that’s okay, good even. But doubt still creeps in. I keep wondering: Is this really the right fit for me?

On paper, my life is good. I’m happily married to a wonderful husband. I genuinely show up for my friends and nurture those relationships. Still, I sometimes look at other people’s social lives—the ones with tight-knit girl groups—and wonder why my social circle doesn’t look like that anymore. I have individual friends of my own who I see over coffee, drinks here and there, but no girl group with who I go to roadtrips or do fun stuff. I’m almost 31, I still question whether it’s “acceptable,” as if life has some high score I’m supposed to hit in every area. 
 I’m a social, curious person who loves interesting, fun, and vulnerable people, but I just don’t know where to meet them in my 30s besides new job.

Family is another layer. I am an only child and my mom and cousins live in another town, and I only see them about once a month. I can’t help but wonder how life would feel if, like many of my friends, I had family nearby and maybe that would make me feel more grounded.

I keep falling into this cycle of picking apart the “imperfections” in my life and constantly asking myself what’s missing. And the truth is, I don’t really know what to do about it.


I work in the creative industry because I love creativity and hate monotony, but ironically, my life feels a little too monotone right now.

If anyone out there has been through something similar, I’d love to hear your thoughts. How did you break free from this mental loop of striving for some undefined version of “perfect”?

During this process, I've heard every medical doctors angle about my weight and needing to lose it and needing to exercise... *hand wave* ad nauseum

I finally feel like I'm in a place physically to start small: such as walking on a treadmill or down the block, maybe a few bicep curls with a low weight, or maybe some squats over a chair.  

To battle the perfectionism, I deliberately chose to not start in January. I deliberately chose not to start on a Monday. I have no concrete plans because that will scare me away. 

I got up and put on my workout stuff. I had coffee and breakfast and my anger grew. Why? 🤷‍♀️ At what? 🤷‍♀️ I was doing some chores when I noticed I was using ""useful procrastination"" to avoid the workout.

So, I grabbed my water and went to the garage. By the time I laid eyes on the treadmill, I was furious. 

So, in my journey, I've learned that anger is my warning that my brain is trying to stop me from doing something. I'm getting better at seeing that faster and calming down and I was able to do it fairly quickly this time.

So here I am typing to the CPTSD group about it. I know this is trauma related. I have hated exercising and dieting since I was young. It's torturous (boring and yes, I've tried everything from weights, to yoga, to classes of every kind - I hate the demand on my time and attention), I don't get the results I want fast enough, and it's all attached to shame. 

So, I put it aside again today and I'll ponder more on how to gently get myself back into exercise. 

I had a similar cptsd response to dieting, too. I lost it with even trying anymore and began eating whatever I wanted a few years back. I dared anyone try to stop me. I now have diabetes and am aware I also deal with PDA and it's consequences.
