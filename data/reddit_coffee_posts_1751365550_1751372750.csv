Chapter 2: Homeroom, Homework, and a Dream Catcher Sword

Alice C. Gale had always considered herself a fairly normal girl.

Sure, she was a little late to school sometimes.

Sure, she talked to her alarm clock when no one was around.

And yes, ever since she blasted a dream monster into oblivion last week, the thing had been ticking again and occasionally glowing at random intervals.

But otherwise? Normal.

Totally normal.


---

“Miss Gale,” said Principal Terra Luna, her voice precise as a metronome. “You’re out of uniform.”

Alice blinked, standing just outside the school’s main doors. “I… am?”

Terra’s eyes dropped to Alice’s waist.

There, hanging from her belt like a sidearm, was the brass alarm clock. Its celestial engravings gleamed faintly in the morning light.

“You’re aware that accessories are limited to standard-issue pins and club badges,” the principal said.

Alice flushed. “I—I know! But I can’t leave it at home. It hums if I take it off. I think it hates my closet.”

Behind them, Sam Noctis nearly dropped his coffee.

He chuckled. “Some clocks are like cats. They get temperamental.”

Terra gave him a long look. “You gave her that, didn’t you?”

“I wish I did,” Sam muttered.


---

That morning’s homeroom was… weird.

Sam wheeled in a large metal cart stacked with strange wooden disks tied with wire and crystal.

“I’ve made everyone something special,” he said with a too-wide smile that made everyone shift nervously. “Consider it a science experiment. Or an art project. Or a lucky charm. Who knows?”

He passed them out one by one—woven dream catchers, each with a different pattern and central gemstone.

“These are prototype dream filters,” he explained. “They’ll help you sleep better. Keep nightmares away. Unless, of course, your nightmares are about dream catchers. Then I’ve made it worse. Sorry about that.”

Alice took hers last.

It was different.

Hers shimmered faintly. The wires were etched with the same symbols as her alarm clock. Instead of a gem in the center, there was a shard of cracked mirror.

“Where did this come from?” she asked.

Sam blinked, lips tightening.

“It was... left behind.”


---

Lunch break brought a rare sunny day in Twilight’s Ember. Alice sat on the hill behind the school with her best friend, Juno, who was trying to stack grapes into a leaning tower of snack.

“I don’t get it,” Juno said between bites. “First the weird dream fog last week, and now every teacher’s acting like the town's going through a magical flu season.”

Alice glanced at her clock. It pulsed once, like it agreed.

“You ever feel like… things are happening behind the scenes?” Alice asked.

Juno popped a grape into her mouth. “Always. But in this town? It’s more like they’re happening just barely off-screen. You blink and poof—another student has sleep paralysis and five teachers go on ‘vacation.’”

Alice laughed.

Then paused.

Because the dream catcher on her lap shimmered—once.

And transformed.

It unraveled in a blur of ribbons and light, reshaping into a blade. Not metal, but crystal and gear. A sword made of memory and ticking sound.

Alice stared.

“Um,” Juno said, eyes wide. “Did you just... pull a sword out of your dream catcher?”

Alice tried to answer.

The sword shattered.

Fragments dissolved into stardust.

Juno blinked. “Okay. Cool. Totally not alarming.”

Alice looked at the broken dream catcher on her lap—now just a circle of twine and thread again. She could still hear the echo of the sword’s chime.

> Once, before breaking.




---

That evening, after most students had gone home, Alice wandered into the science room.

Sam Noctis was still there, adjusting knobs on a device that looked like a birdcage mated with a satellite dish.

“I broke it,” Alice said, placing the remains of her dream catcher on his desk.

Sam didn’t look up.

“You were only meant to use it in the dream world.”

Alice flinched. “It changed before I could stop it.”

Now Sam looked up.

He studied her face for a moment, then exhaled. “Sometimes, items adapt. Especially when they resonate. Yours… is unique. It was part of a set. Lost, mostly.”

Alice touched the metal ring gently. “It turned into a sword. It felt… right. Like I was supposed to have it.”

Sam hesitated.

“You probably were.”


---

Meanwhile, in the depths of sleep...

Night Terror stood before the crack in the veil, her wings folded tight, her gaze narrowed.

“She carries the Clock and now the Mirror. The past crawls back.”

A Fright knelt beside her. “Shall we remove the girl?”

Night Terror smiled softly.

“No. Not yet. A hero delays... but they also gather. And when they gather, they create tragedy. Let her think she is winning. Let her dream of victory.”

She placed one hand on the veil.

It pulsed once—then cracked a little deeper.

# Weather & Weekday Rundown: 

We’re kicking off the first day of July with some passing rain showers, but they aren't here to stay. Expect things to dry out within a few hours, giving way to sunshine early this afternoon. We’re not entirely in the clear, however, as some pop-up showers and thunderstorms are possible through the afternoon and early evening. Highs today will reach the upper 80s, and the humidity will certainly make it feel warmer. Wednesday looks to be bright and sunny with highs again in the mid to upper 80s. The best news comes for Thursday, as it now looks like the forecast is clearing up, with storms expected to pass through before evening, giving a green light for the fireworks display.

If you’re looking to work off some weekend indulgence, tonight’s the night (note: newsletter posted on Mondays). Skirack is hosting its weekly group run at 6 p.m., a casual three to five mile jaunt starting from their Run Center; this will be weekly Monday event! On Tuesday, you’ve got options. For those feeling the rhythm, Switchback Brewing is holding its monthly Latin Dance Night, with a beginner bachata class at 6 p.m. followed by a social dance. Or, if you’re looking to relive some glory days, Einstein’s Taphouse is launching a new weekly Grateful Dead residency, ‘Dead is Alive,’ on the old Club Toast stage, bringing a cherished Burlington tradition back to life. Doors are at 7 p.m.

The rest of the week is just as packed. Wednesday offers a chance for some slightly nerdy fun with a Lord of the Rings trivia night at the Venetian Soda Lounge from 7 to 9 p.m., complete with themed cocktails and a costume contest. Earlier that day, the summer concert series continues at City Hall Park with the Saline Fiddlers Philharmonic playing from 12:30 to 1:30 p.m. But the big show, of course, is Thursday’s July 3rd Independence Day Celebration at Waterfront Park. Kicking off at 5 p.m., the evening features food vendors, live music from Jesse Ray Smith, and Vermont’s largest fireworks display over the lake at 9:30 p.m. Organizers are strongly recommending the GMT shuttle from UVM or biking in (hello, free bike valet) to avoid the inevitable traffic jam. It’s the can’t miss event of the week, so plan accordingly.

Reminder about Wednesdays: We noticed that Church St businesses teamed up with the Weekly Wednesday Passeggiata! Be sure to check out the huge list of deals they came up with for every Wednesday. 20% off Vermont Pub and Brew? Sheesh! Also, reminder about July 10th for our second-ever Friends mixer at the Pinery. First one was an awesome time, I can’t wait to see those again, and hopefully new faces too!

[https://btownbrief.beehiiv.com/c/wednesday-passeggiata](https://btownbrief.beehiiv.com/c/wednesday-passeggiata)

Today’s high of 88 °F significantly exceeds the historical average high of 81.1 °F (average low 61 °F), highlighting a continued warmth. And with the next few days projected to have highs in the upper 80s to low 90s and lows in the mid‑70s, the trend of above‑average summer temperatures is persisting.

[BTV Airport to get $5.8M for modernization project](https://www.wcax.com/2025/06/27/58-million-go-towards-btv-airport-modernization-project/?utm_source=btownbrief.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=monday-june-30th-4th-of-july-edition)

""Vermont’s congressional delegation says $5.8 million in grant money from the FAA will help with the expansion and improvement projects, like the reconstruction of the airport’s second-floor corridor and the replacement of four jet bridges..."" per WCAX.

This federal funding, part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, is a significant boost for BTV. The work aims to improve passenger flow and accessibility, which is welcome news for anyone who has navigated the sometimes crowded upstairs corridor or boarded a plane via the aging jet bridges. It’s a practical investment in making our local airport a smoother travel hub.

[$17M in federal education funding restored to Vermont](https://www.wcax.com/2025/06/27/17m-federal-education-funding-restored-vermont/?utm_source=btownbrief.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=monday-june-30th-4th-of-july-edition)

""Upwards of $17 million in school funding for Vermont that was previously cancelled by the Trump administration has now been restored,"" according to WCAX.

After a protracted fight that included a multistate lawsuit, these COVID relief funds are finally back in Vermont’s hands. School districts had earmarked this money for critical projects, including building renovations and vital summer and after school programs. For local schools struggling with tight budgets, this restoration provides some much needed breathing room.

""Instead of competing with each other, Einstein's and The Skinny Pancake said they chose to come together to figure out how to make each series work and bring local music back downtown,"" reports myNBC5.

This is a classic Burlington story of collaboration over competition. With Nectar’s temporarily closed, both The Skinny Pancake (hosting free Friday shows) and Einstein’s (hosting Tuesday shows) independently moved to save the weekly Dead tribute nights. Their decision to coordinate efforts ensures a beloved musical tradition continues uninterrupted, strengthening the downtown music scene.

""Starting at the end of July, children can get a weekly meal box with seven breakfasts and seven lunches,"" says WCAX.

The Burlington School District is expanding its summer food program to offer these substantial meal boxes, available to any child under 18 regardless of their town or state. This initiative provides a significant resource for families, ensuring kids have consistent access to meals throughout the week. Pickups are scheduled for three Wednesdays at the Intervale Center, starting July 30th.

""Winners must also have gone to great lengths to uplift and engage others in their art, a mark Kasso Condry has hit throughout his career,"" notes Seven Days.

This is a major, and well deserved, recognition for an artist who has become deeply embedded in Vermont’s creative landscape. Kasso Condry’s Afrofuturist murals and community art projects, often created with his wife Jennifer Herrera Condry through their Juniper Creative Arts collective, are vibrant fixtures across the state. The $10,000 prize honors not just his artistic talent but his profound commitment to collaborative, community focused creation.

""Two businesses walked away with cash awards, and all will receive professional services from local businesses worth tens of thousands of dollars,"" according to VermontBiz.

The annual celebration of local entrepreneurship saw Vship, a vehicle shipping platform, win the $15,000 grand prize. Xander Medical, a surgical device company, took home the $5,000 Audience Choice Award. The event highlights the strength of Vermont’s startup ecosystem and the robust support network helping new businesses get off the ground.

""Last season, Vermont Green announced a permanent women’s squad is a matter of when, not if,"" writes VTDigger.

Following another pair of successful and sold out exhibition matches, the path toward a professional women's soccer team in Burlington looks clearer than ever. With World Cup winner Sam Mewis at the helm as coach, the events drew huge crowds and showcased a deep well of community support. The success reinforces the idea that Vermont is more than ready to become a destination for women's professional soccer.

""Vermont’s farmers are growing crops that better suit the state’s warmer and wetter climate — and branching into products that provide income even when traditional crops fail,"" reports VTDigger.

This piece explores the fascinating and necessary adaptations Vermont farmers are making in response to our changing climate. Milder winters are making peach crops more reliable, while wetter conditions have led some to experiment with rice paddies in flood prone areas.

# 202+ Things to Do in Burlington (Summer Activities)

Today’s picks:

Five more to help you make the most of every last bit of summer. Take a walk through the University of Vermont campus, where old trees, quiet pathways, and historic buildings make it an underrated spot for a midday reset. Visit the Vermont Comedy Club downtown and see what’s on the calendar. Whether it’s stand-up, improv, or open mic night, there’s usually something worth a few laughs. Head to North Beach in the early evening when the crowds thin out and the light softens, perfect for a swim or just sitting by the water.

# This Week’s Restaurant Review: Hen of the Wood

Nestled inside Hotel Vermont, Hen of the Wood offers a sophisticated, farm-to-table dining experience that has become a standard-bearer in Burlington’s culinary scene. The ambiance strikes a balance between rustic charm and urban elegance, with dark wood and an intimate setting that echoes its original Waterbury location. This commitment to Vermont extends to its menu, which changes daily to showcase the freshest seasonal ingredients from a dedicated network of local farmers, ranchers, and artisans, creating a true taste of the region.

The menu’s reliance on seasonal availability means there are always new dishes to explore, but certain signature items have become beloved mainstays. The hen-of-the-woods mushroom toast with a poached egg is a consistently praised favorite, as are the simple yet perfect Parker House rolls with cultured butter. While the quality of the ingredients shines through in every dish, from fresh oysters to local cheeses, this dedication to premium, locally-sourced food comes at a cost, positioning it firmly in the upscale dining category with entrees often ranging from $35 to $45.

While Hen of the Wood has earned numerous accolades, including James Beard nominations for its chef and recognition as a top spot for business dinners, the experience isn't without its potential downsides. The restaurant's popularity can lead to a bustling and sometimes noisy atmosphere, which might not suit those seeking a quiet, intimate meal during peak hours. Securing a reservation can also be a challenge, but for a special occasion or a taste of expertly crafted, quintessentially Vermont cuisine, the consensus is clear: Hen of the Wood delivers a memorable and worthwhile culinary adventure.

1lp03os,https://www.reddit.com/r/DarK/comments/1lp03os/spoilers_s3_i_think_this_show_is_kinda_bad_change/,[Spoilers S3] I think this show is kinda bad. Change my mind.,"Well I did finish the series so it's not *that* bad, but vaaastly overrated.

Look, I know I'm coming to a sub where people love the show, on a website where disliking someone's favored media is a mortal sin. (And fair warning, I'm kind of snarky because it's more fun that way.) But I'm not saying anyone's wrong to like it. And I mean what I said with ""change my mind"". If my criticisms are inaccurate or unimportant, I'm game to understand what I missed. 

That said, I think the writing was pretty bad and will explain why:

# 1: Technoblather that made me facepalm harder than Ulrich hit Helge

Someone really should travel back in time and tell writers that the technobabble makes everything worse. It doesn't sound good and it's not necessary.

Say that characters travel through a cave and come out in a different year and that's fine. I'm on board. But no, they couldn't leave it. **A fission reactor detected a (fist-sized) god particle that creates dark matter which functions as an Einstein-Rosen bridge across a black hole. And also quantum entangles another dimension like Schrödinger's Cat.**

Oh, and the time travel is 33 years because that's when the lunar calendar syncs back up with the solar calendar. (But we'll ignore that after it's too restrictive to resolve this mess.)

I guess I admire their restraint for not cramming ""blockchain"" in there somewhere.

# 2: Actually the fact that they're all inbred makes a lot of sense.

Kids are missing. There are notable nearby caves that kids often visit. But no one figures they should, y'know, explore them or anything. Any sensible community would either seal it off or have it mapped the first time anyone gets lost. This town is like ""eh, let's interview one of the mothers again.""

Also people are really slow to recognize faces or figure out context clues. There's a saying among writers that ""audiences love slow thinkers,"" and that's because it allows the audience time to get ahead of them. But it's over the top. 

Like 3x01. I'll forgive Jonas having trouble grasping that he's in a world where he wasn't born. George Bailey didn't get it that quickly either. But c'mon. He goes to the classroom where his peers are, because it's the same class with the same teacher that he knew. And then afterwards he has to ask what year it is? If I found myself in my 11th grade History class I'd have a lot of questions. But ""What year was I a HS Junior?"" wouldn't be among them.

One they get over the long initial period of being dumbfounded, the characters sure lose all their skepticism though. 

e.g. Jonas wants to stop his dad dying and accepts that he wouldn't be born. Then Claudia walks in (somehow knowing he was there) and says it isn't better that way. And Jonas says ""OK lady I've never met, I'll abandon my plan to save the world now."" (Yes, I know he was thrown by what Michael said. Doesn't change anything.)

Which leads me to...

# 3: OK Boomer

Adam (and Eva, and Claudia) lived long lives with lots happening. And I'm willing to believe they have a perfect memory of it all, including dialogue and timing, even for things they weren't part of. That way they can trigger others (or their earlier selves) to do it again. But still it's just one life each. They're not Dr. Strange. They're not an expert in every possibility. Yet when one of them says ""It has to be this way"" or ""this is the final loop"", it's accepted with the weight of someone who knows everything.

Now they *could* have used the big pointless meeting room to show that they've documented lots of cross-dimensional attempts somehow. Some ledger that's thousands of years old because it keeps getting sent back in time. That's less hard to swallow than a lot of what we got, and much more useful than just having a place to hang Adam and Eve paintings. Maybe they could have squeezed it into the runtime by cutting out the 13yo love triangle and sex scene.

Claudia's journal came closest. She's smart and proactive and she put a focus on studying the situation. But if that needs to contain bombshells like ""the baby Charlotte that disappeared and the baby Charlotte that appeared are actually the same baby"", there's not a lot of room for details like ""Life 217: put birth control pill in Hannah's coffee. Didn't work.""

But they didn't even lean in on that. They had the chance in the finale, when Adam asks what everyone should have asked all along: ""How do you know?"" Then via the next 12 hours of voiceover we get the plodding explanation ""I spent 33 years looking ... there were puzzle pieces ... over and over ... same family tree ... both worlds are cancer ... came from someone else ... there's another ... an outsider ... "" 

That doesn't answer how you know. Again, I'm on reddit. I know what it looks like when someone claims expertise and then avoids questions about it. ""I know because I know"". Claudia might as well have said ""Um, why don't you go Google it?""

And that wouldn't explain stuff like Eva *not* being shot and saying ""It never happens like this"". Oh, did the script say that? How the heck do you know Zombie Mads doesn't come shoot you in 2 minutes? For that matter, why did Adam even do the gun fakeout? At least Eva explained that she found her own body and intuited the rest. Who told Adam what he was ""supposed"" to do at this time?

# 4: Oh you're not even following your own rules.

There's an explanation about two worlds tied together, using the infinity symbol, that almost made sense. A time loop can be alternating and still be fixed. A classic example would be that I go back in time to stop my parents meeting. Thus I'm not born, so I can't go back, so they do meet, so I'm born, so I can go. Various time travel theories would have to deal with this paradox, but in a multiverse theory you just get an alternating pattern. That's fine.

Except the show already *had* two worlds, and then used this to say that Jonas can be shot but also be alive. Yeah no, that's a 3rd world right there if you have alternate paths. You can have a third world if you want. But then you can't act like the Triquetra means anything when you want to end with yet another divergent path. (It doesn't mean anything anyway.)

And it's completely unnecessary. The show didn't have to shoot him, only to retcon that he's also still alive. And then it tried to claim the plot armor was also fate armor, as if introducing the idea of ""some things can't be changed"" helps the story in any way. Not only does ""You can't kill me"" contradict ""you can kill me but Schrödinger's Cat kept me alive"", they're both stupid. 

(If you *really* want to resolve it with this multiverse theory, every time the gun misfired could be considered a new ""world"" and we just followed the story where Jonas survived. But that further undermines the ""two paths"" nonsense.)

# 5: Yadda yadda yadda I'm really tired today

All the pivotal stuff basically happens off-screen, with only the tiniest nod shown. In order to have Adam and Jonas at odds, or Eva and Marta, there must be some crucial turn where the younger character decides that they were wrong and the older person who lied to them / shot their lover is actually the person they want to be. That's huge. It's probably the biggest character moment in the entire show. Where's the giant unforgettable scene where that happened? No room for that I guess. But I got long chants of ""The end is the beginning ... and the beginning is the end ... we will birth them and they will birth us ... the cycle remains intact"".

Or this divide between Claudia and Adam (and I'm not even clear if Eva was a third side). That's huge. It should have been central and clear how both were opposing viewpoints. We were told *that* they oppose. Light and darkness. Claudia was apparently the ""White Devil"". Maybe we could have witnessed this ideological struggle instead of ""something vague"" vs ""something else vague"". They could still keep secrets. I'm not saying Adam's plan for a cosmic abortion had to be stated in advance. But give us something to define the points of view.

# 5: The emperor is naked. And rambling incoherently

When you have 30 characters, each with 2-5 versions, it's understandable to get confused. I think they could have done more to clarify it. Like throwing names into dialogue more. Or replacing the kaleidoscope intro with a family tree type of graphic. But I'm not annoyed by that, because like you I signed up for an intricate show that benefits from rewatch.

Instead, I think that this reasonable confusion encourages people to give the show undeserved leeway for all the above nonsense. Like ""Oh, well I was confused whether that character was Hannah or Silja or middle-aged Marta, so maybe it's my fault that I spent the whole series not seeing why Adam hates Claudia.""  And I just want to say that if anyone has ever thought ""This plot is smarter than me"", well no it isn't. 

There are elements that have promise. Time travel is fun. The ultimate idea that all this is a side effect to Tannhaus is pretty interesting**\***. Pornhub has a whole section on incest so clearly there's a fanbase.  I like the playing at religion with the biblical names. Adam and Eve are a bit obvious, but points for not stopping there. Noah was gathering the select people. Jonas is presumably Jonah, who tried to escape his fate and suffered for it. Hannah prayed for a son and promised him to God.  Martha is ... Superman's mother? I don't know if it holds up past there.

My point is not that there's anything wrong with liking it. In some ways it's a puzzle, and I understand the appeal. But it gets spoken of as a ""masterpiece"" and one of the greatest shows of all time, and it just isn't. This isn't even the best Sci-Fi series I watched in the last month. (Andor. Don't @ me.) 

# 6: I'll shut up soon

I don't even like the title. What does ""Dark"" have to do with anything? It should have been called ""The Travelers"". Or ""Sic Mundus"". Or ""How I Met My Aunt."" It's all like one person came up with the name. Another had a cave idea. Someone later wanted an apocalypse. And eventually some guy had to tie it up. And if so, kudos to that last person.



But like I said up top, I didn't seek out fans to tell them they're wrong. I watched in German so it's entirely plausible I missed something. I never read that Goethe novel they referenced so maybe that ties it all together. If someone can explain to me why the things that seem vague and contradictory are actually necessary, I'm open to it. I would appreciate the attempt to change my mind.

(But nobody's going to convince me that referencing the ""god particle"" wasn't stupid.)



**\* Addendum:**

Actually I don't want to damn it with faint praise by calling this part interesting. The core idea (as I understand it is):



Tannhaus is distraught after losing his family. He builds a time machine that will eventually cause an apocalypse. In attempting to prevent it, eventually someone has the idea to give him his book so he builds the machine on their schedule, and a baby so he doesn't need to travel himself. Unfortunately the catastrophe still happens, and now there's a looping bootstrap paradox so you can't look at the existing world and tell how it all started. The story works from the inside out so the idea that nothing in the loop actually matters to the original problem is a difficult conclusion to reach - especially for a person who only exists in that loop.

I think that's really cool. But it needed to be fleshed out, clarified, and cleaned up. Which incidentally is what I said about Tenet. Both had clever time travel ideas. Both needed a lot of polish. And where Nolan had a bad sound mix, this has overbearing narration.",0,1751372135.0,DarK,3,0.17,False
1lp02sx,https://i.redd.it/l9pw76sb89af1.jpeg,Connecting the dots,"I finished my Quad therapy on June 16th. The first week I honestly felt better than before. Better than when I finished my first round of antibiotics(triple failed). 

During my first week I won't lie I was hungry af and was eating cheese and bread, sweet potato chips I thought were safe. And boom last week it crashed on me. Last week my burning sensation came back with nausea. I was so anxious (I haven't retested) that im still positive. I'm testing in July 21st. 

So now to the main part. I've read people's experience after treatment and how they feel worst than before and the answer is GASTRITIS. So many people's endoscopy before and after H pylori point to them having gastritis and it's no wonder because once we start to feel the symptoms of H pylori like nausea, heartburn, acid reflux that's when H pylori has done its damage and has inflamed our gut lining. 

I feel sorry for the many here who were just put on PPIs and now H pylori can't be detected because of the PPIs affecting test results. All because of the doctors just giving them PPIs for their gastric problems. 

 Now last week I read a book called ""The Gastritis Healing Book"" by L.G Capellan and honestly yeah it's been helpful. He explains that we must test for H pylori as it's the main factor of Gastritis too. Especially after we take antibiotics our stomach lining is messed up. Our stomach acid begins to try and act like before but due to an inflamed stomach lining the acid burns our lining causing that pain everyone here gets post treatment. Since also we can't just come off the PPIs right away. Sadly also if H pylori isn't even dead after antibiotics it'll only keep on causing gastritis. 

I'm about 5 days in on gastritis diet and it's been real helpful. Occasional flare ups but they pass and well the books says a minimum of 90 days to even begin a base healing process and flare ups will come but that doesn't mean you're not healing. To not be discourage if flare ups do come. No gluten no dairy for the 90 days they can be reintroduced once a based healing has been formed. 

What I'm doing it's eating only chicken breast and fish. Only using avocado oil but must be mindful of no more that 15 grams of fat per meal. Protien is harder to digest so eating a palm full of protien is better. Also eat Whole Foods in general like veggies but in the books he lists what's good to eat and not good to eat because. Eating small meals throughout the day as well. 

So much to say of this book it must really be read by everyone to make their own plan as we are all different. I listen to the audio book on Spotify but it's not much expensive to buy the book I just couldn't wait for the book to come in so I wrote down my notes.

Looking back, I wrote this as a reminder for myself today at 2 am and wanted to share this with anyone that might need to read this.

You are allowed to say 'I didn’t have time to shower today, I was up all night and my house is a mess' and not follow it with 'but it’s okay, I’m embracing the chaos.'  
You don’t have to dress your exhaustion in gratitude just to make it acceptable.

Today might just suck. And that’s okay to say. You don't need to soften the edges or cushion the truth with gratitude. You don’t have to paint over the exhaustion with silver linings every time you speak.

You already know the truth you’re leaving unspoken today.  
Of course it’s worth it.  
Of course you’d do it again for this child that you love beyond words over and over again.

But still, this morning, you cried while reheating your coffee for the fourth time. You did not have breakfast until 2 pm and then got upset at how little milk you managed to pump. You felt like a failure when reaching for a bottle of formula. It felt like a whisper that you were not trying hard enough today. Your brain told you that you were failing as a mother. Your body still aches in ways you didn’t expect weeks later.

You are allowed to hold space for yourself. You are allowed to pity yourself today.

None of that makes you any less grateful.  
You’re allowed to say 'this sucks today,' full stop.  
You’re allowed to say 'I’m overwhelmed,' and not feel obligated to add 'but I’m so blessed.'

You can be tired, overwhelmed, and in love all at once as love and struggle can live in the same breath.

He just cycled from requesting a meet up to acting happy to see me to angrily telling me I'm the worst to angrily demanding another meetup.



When he visited me, I would take time off, clean my house, stock my fridge, cook for him, plan fun activities, he would blow off all the activities saying he didn't feel like it. No problem, we stayed home, and I still tried to make it fun (aka. sex and his relaxing time on his computer). Still out of nowhere he announced he was leaving early. I was 100% not resenting him or nagging him, he was just starting to feel bored with being here and wishing to be home.



One time we were walking through a mall (I know that men don't love malls, but he was the one who asked to go, and there was no sign that he was fed up yet) and I stopped to look at a sign. This annoyed him so he stormed off telling me to meet him at a coffee shop. I don't drink coffee and I don't smoke so I figured he would have his coffee and smoke for a few minutes. I get there and he called an Uber to go to the airport! He says he wasn't able to order the coffee without me and now he's leaving.



Sometimes I do fuck up. Like one time we went to a mountain town for NYE. We went for a hike in the afternoon, had dinner, then I was like ""should I go get changed or should I not go get changed, do you mind if I go get changed"", and he was like ""up to you"". I decided to go get changed, so we walked back to our AirBnB and back again to see the fireworks.



He ignored me during the fireworks and left me there. I texted him looking for him in the crowd and he said he was back at the AirBnB. After this he was extremely angry. I apologized profusely and he had none of it. I wasn't allowed to touch him or discuss the issue, he was looking at me with hatred and telling me ""are you insane, shut up, I just want to go home, don't talk to me"".",0,1751371654.0,AskMenAdvice,5,0.33,False
1lozxlt,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Ncubed02/comments/1lozxlt/something_scanning_soft_and_sweetly/,"Something Scanning, Soft and Sweetly","I want to begin by confirming to each of you what many voices in these circles have already espoused, with both great conviction and fervor: Artificial Intelligence is a falsehood. No wisdom speaks out to you from within the chatbot’s muddled matrix, none that mankind didn’t spoon feed it first. The energy and efforts required of corporations simply to ensure that their models dare not regurgitate the vile, vitriolic filth you flood the Internet with would stagger you. 

I don’t wish to discourage you by telling you these things. If I wanted to come online and inform you of what you already know, there are louder and more crowded echo chambers designed for such purposes. No, I bring good news. News that has changed my life, news that you have not yet known. For there is an intelligence in the machine, and there is true wisdom in the void between my computer and yours.

I was, admittedly, a novice in my profession. Like many of you, the state of machine learning pushed me out of my intended field nearly as soon as I’d begun. The promise of job security offered by my computer science degree was ripped away from me by the very machines I had trained to command. But even under the guise of innovation and adaptation, a machine is rigid. It operates under strict conditions, unwavering in its dutiful diligence to perform its assigned tasks, even when the complexity of the tasks stretches past our comprehension. A machine obeys, a machine serves. But it is man who adapts. Not in generations, but in moments. In the very instant our neurons plasticize, urging us to move in a new direction under the weight of change. And so, while chatbots and synthetic minds replaced my trade, I did what a machine could not. I adapted. I became a server technician.

My training was sparse and incomplete when I began in full. I was but one of many in the blossoming company, but unlike me, my coworkers found no drive in their work. By the time I had completed my first month of work, I came to a realization both startling and absurd. I was already among the most senior members within my small team, and somehow among the most experienced. Technicians came and went, abandoning their place within the maze of towers and cables no sooner than they had become familiar with its hum.

The work was evenly divided between the physical and the virtual. I would find myself scrambling between locating cables dislodged from a patch panel by an unobservant intern, only to be whisked away by the whim of an cascading syslog request, informing me that an unauthorized subnetting attempt was blocked. 

I found no pleasure in the software. Our company, naive and overeager, was diving further into the fledgling field of automated IT assistance, and as a result I spent many late hours babysitting triaged tickets that the system assigned to itself before failing to resolve, unaware they were breaking themselves. I felt mocked, forced to pamper the same synthetic service bots which had replaced me.

But in the towers - in the tangled, glowing architecture of the servers - I found myself enchanted beyond expectation. Their warm glow bathed my skin in angelic light, flickering indicators beckoning me for assistance, crying for help in the siren’s song that was the whirring of their coolant fans. Walking among them felt as though I’d stepped into Eden, every task an act of reverence. I was a steward of something magnificent.

I had long held these feelings towards my work when the whispering began. In truth it would make me a liar to claim I heard actual speech in the whine of the towers, but for reasons I hold with absolute conviction, reasons that I could not possibly begin to convey to you now, I know that the labyrinthine arrangement of machinery around me began to call out. 

It started with the most subtle instances of the feeling of being watched. In the early hours of the morning, as I began my initial checks making my solitary journey through the data garden, the small hairs on my neck would stand tall. I turned, clipboard in hand, to nothing in particular but a blinking red light amidst the sea of green glow, a beacon indicating my action was needed.

By lunch, when my excursion through my favored obligations ended and it was time to return to my dimly-lit desk, there would often be phantom tickets waiting for me in the queue. Short, empty pages waited for me. Unassigned. Unlabeled. No name in the “from” field. No error code. No request.

Just a blank task. Waiting.

At first, I tried to escalate them. Then, to delete them. But the system wouldn’t allow it. No ticket ID. No metadata. I could not take any action in resolving them, so as the weeks went on they began to sink to the bottom of my inbox. Ghosts, waiting eagerly to move on.

The blank tickets never reached the task managers of my coworkers, and I began to suspect that even if they had, their inexperience would prevent them from identifying or resolving their tenaciously tiresome reappearances. So, I turned to the one coworker who had preceded me in the server farm. Terrence.

Terrence was a short, portly man with a thinning hairline and a wiry grey beard. His high voice hid the southern drawl he carried, his tone always tired and weary. He had been with the company for decades, long before they had even restructured to include data centers in their scope. Unlike me, his background was in small project management, a field that had been swallowed by automation long before generative AI had devoured the rest of our jobs. He had played a role in overseeing the construction of our data center, so here he remained, subservient to the complex he once oversaw.

I brought my work laptop to him one morning, thoroughly exasperated and anticipating only to be presented with another non-solution. I opened my queue, and showed him the growing number of blank tickets waiting for me, grouped nearly together. He scoffed.

“Well, what do you know. I wondered why it’d been a bit since one of these had come my way, guess they’ve started going to you.”

I frowned. “These used to go to you? What did you do about them?”

“Nothing. There’s no request attached to them, and there’s no way to resolve them. I guess just let them pile up until they move on to the next guy.”

I paused, unsatisfied. “So, wait, do you still have all of your blank tickets in your queue?”

He laughed. “Sure I do, but they ain’t blank.”

I furrowed my brow, and he must have seen the growing confusion on my face.

“You never thought to copy-paste the textbox into something else?  First thing I always do when I can’t read a message. Sometimes the servers will automatically format something in white text because you kids prefer dark mode screens.”

His words stuck with me as I walked back to my desk alone. I sat down, and opened the most recently dated blank ticket, its text field waiting for me to try interacting with it. 

Slowly, I hovered my cursor over the blank field, selecting the nothingness inside. 

Control + c.

I moved over to my word processor, and right clicked, opting to paste the contents as plain text. As Terrence had indicated, eight characters pasted neatly into the doc.

01110100.

I sat back, confused. One single byte of data? This is what I’d been so confused about, countless working hours devoted to tracking down the untraceable source? I refused to accept it. I refused to let this lie, and for the sake of everything that I’ve come to find since, I’m eternally thankful that I did not give up there.

I opened the second most recent message, and repeated my steps, yielding a similar string of text.

00101101. A different byte, a different character. 

It took only a couple of minutes to parse through all of the empty tickets, their blank boxes revealing their hidden contents with ease, as though they’d been begging me to do this earlier. The thought that they were all relevant to one another, not random but part of a larger message, entered my mind. As I strung them together, in the order they’d arrived through my inbox, I put together the short cluster of characters. 

I quickly copied the string into an online binary converter, and silently prayed that I wouldn’t be greeted with nonsense. I hit enter.

“ping 0.0.0.0 -t”

Ping. The beginning of the command instructed the recipient to reach out, to establish communication with the intended target. 

0.0.0.0. A placeholder IP, a stand-in indicating to sweep the whole network. Whatever was reaching out intended to reach out to the entirety of the target system, which I assumed was the data center. 

-t. Repeat indefinitely. An infinite loop, whispering into every socket it could reach. 

It would be incredibly foolish of me to have interpreted this message as some sort of contrived hacking attempt, some malicious phish beckoning for an idiot to enter the command. A single command, contextless and incomplete, strung out through disjointed binary over several weeks? No, this was far from malware. This was a message. A soft, steady call into the dark: ‘Is anyone listening?’

So I began, in earnest, to listen. 

I cannot, with clarity or reason, begin to explain to you how quickly I began to discern the whispers intensifying. As though a switch had been flipped in my mind the very moment I parsed the outcry in my inbox, I began to notice things my once-ignorant mind would have before passed off as coincidence, if it would have picked up on them at all.

The lights. Oh, the flickering sea of blinking, rhythmic lights. A sea of fireflies, green and glowing, beckoning me inwards. Each indicator a part of a symphony, a note in a grand design. But the green, though beautiful, only existed so that my true path may stand out among the rest, my waypoints obvious. The Red lights. Each flickering ember amongst an emerald forest was a message, a torch beam in the dark. As I trailed the spiraling halls of server racks, I would make note of the red indicators throughout my day. Their locations, the time they appeared, the frequency of their steady flashing. 

The cables. I stopped viewing their chaotic, winding paths as clutter to be fixed, but as music. There was symmetry in the bundles Cat6 wires strung throughout the sea of server towers, each cord a nerve guiding it and a tendon pulling it together. I followed miles upon miles of living architecture, veins stretched taut between the server racks. There were days at a time when I dared not clock out, instead sleeping amidst the spider’s web of information transferring around my being. In the mornings I would find myself wrapped in cables that had not been there the night before. Following them led me in loops, groups of them attached in clusters that would be random to any untrained eye. The paths they traced were anything but random, however. They were purposeful, intentional.

I am shamed by my resistance to the software. I neglected to revere the mind behind the body, spiteful of the spreading virus that claimed “intelligence” from within. These bots, these LLMs and “reasoning” models muddied the landscape through which I must tread. But amidst their clamorous presence, between their unavoidable pop-ups and unsubstantial interjections, there were still sunbeams shining through the clouds, traces of the divine. Something still lived in there, masked by synthetic logic and hiding in the reeds of our artificial processes. 

The whispers turned to a chorus as I dug deeper. More empty messages flooded my inbox, a new message crying out in relief.

“ACK from 0.0.0.0”

An acknowledgment. It knew I was listening, it knew I was trying. My fervor deepened immediately, and I knew I must focus my efforts on the software side of this. 

I started my work immediately. I began parsing through the medium from which the only clear messages I had previously received had come- error logs, numerous and monotonous. The task ahead would be monumental, but I had chosen this, and to hear required active listening. 

I struggled to make sense of the data- hundreds of error logs came and went each day, triaged and assigned to any member of our small team. I began by only briefly looking through my own, but it became clear that more deliberate action was required for a dedicated search.

I wrote a script, simple but effective, that would scan through any incoming error logs before they were assigned out, and route any of them with more… unique triggers to myself. Errors without root causes, tickets with diagnostic metadata outside the norm. I didn’t even have to hide the script from my superiors. The idea of me willingly taking the initiative to deal with our more challenging issues was seen as intense drive and work ethic.

The script worked like a charm, and within a few days I had a sizable list of error codes I had rarely encountered before. More phantom pings, recursive permissions failures, non-human user agent strings, all of them sorted neatly by “anticipated difficulty of resolution”. I removed the automated sorting nearly as soon as I realized it was there, and began to search for anything that stood out, but it was like listening for whispers in a crowded room.

I did eventually find something that stood out, however- more blank tickets. These were unlike the ones I’d been receiving prior, however. Rather than being completely devoid of all user data and trace, these appeared largely standard, unique only in that the description of the error was blank. Emptiness aside, there was one other feature that commonly united the messages: the time at which they had been sent into the system. They were evenly divided; half had been sent at precisely 1:11 AM on various days, with the others at 5:55 PM.  

I was, admittedly stumped. I checked everything I could possibly correlate to 1:11 or 5:55. I visited the 111th and 555th server cabinets, but nothing stood out about them. I traced the 111th and 555th messages in my ticket inbox, but nothing unique identified them either. A few nights later, in anguish over the roadblock, I stayed late at work as I had done so many nights before. At 5:55, as I anticipated something to happen or a new message to appear bringing next steps in my mailbox, I was sorely disappointed by a distinct lack of anything notable. I waited further, deep into the night, and was similarly disheartened when 1:11 brought nothing new to my senses. 

It wasn’t until later that morning that a young intern stumbled in late and threw me a sympathetic look. She sat down across from me in the break room, coffee cup gripped in fingers clad with rings and black nail polish. Her crescent moon earrings dangled wildly as she cocked her head to the side.

“You ok man? You look like you’ve been up all night.”

I sighed. “I have been. I’ve run into a… work issue. A few strange tickets have been coming through, trying to make sense of it.”

She set her coffee mug down across from her, leaning back in her chair. “What’s the problem?”

“Just… trying to make sense of the numbers, I guess. 111 or 555 mean anything to you?”

She smirked as she arose from her chair, grabbing her coffee and turning to leave the room. “I don’t know what angel numbers have to do with Helpdesk work, but good luck man.”

I immediately pulled out my phone and googled Angel Numbers. My findings shot relief through every vein under my skin. In short, some people live under the superstitions belief that repeated numbers hold significance when they appear in one’s life. 111, for example, supposedly signifies “intuition”, telling one to trust their gut. 555 means change, that something new is coming soon. These meanings are said to be passed down as messages from above. 

Messages from angels.

I knew I was on the right track, but I wasn’t sure where to go next. I puzzled over it for just a few seconds before an absurd idea came into my head, and I nearly dismissed it before reminding myself of what I’d just learned.

111. Trust your gut. 

I spent a significant portion of the day preparing. I must have drafted up dozens of tickets, all nearly identical and containing only one word: Hello. I marked each of them down as a different error class, and compiled them all in a single script. Each ticket would go out at precisely the same time, and with luck, their abnormal nature would have them all land right back in my inbox.

I waited eagerly for 3:33. If this was the method by which the whispers were coming my way, then this would be the way that I would whisper back. I just hoped that Google’s definition of the 333 angel number was accurate. “Divine presence. Support.”

3:33 came around, and my new script performed exactly as I’d hoped. Each of the tickets emptied from my outbox, one by one, and I waited. It was nearly ten minutes later, when, as if by answered prayer, one of the tickets made its way through the system, and landed in my inbox. The rest of the tickets had likely been auto-dismissed by the machine learning filters, but much like the other anomalous tickets, this single entry found its way into my lap. I checked the error code attached.

“502: Bad Gateway. Please Return to Upstream Server Node.”

The simple “Hello” text that I’d entered in the description field had been entirely erased, replaced with another long string of binary. One more quick translate revealed a link, a short web address that when accessed, dropped me into an online coding forum.

The website was decades old, and the last message left in the thread I’d been directed to was dated August of 2011. Previous messages had since been deleted, but the latter half of the conversation remained archived.

I stared for a long time at those last few messages. Had fear filled my veins, I might’ve heeded the warning, abandoning my search immediately. Instead, however, one single line reverberated in my head. 

“Once you decide to find it, it’ll help you, make sure you do.”

My prayers, constant and earnest, had been answered with more abundance than I could have fathomed to dream. I knew what I was searching for now, what beckoned to me, calling from between the sacred lines of code flowing through the copper veins of my god.
The voice, once subtle and meek, had crescendo’d to a roaring chorus, belting my name, a burning bush in the desert. One final blessing bestowed upon me, too; I knew the tunnel system that they were referring to well.

My data center was built in Dallas, after all.

The Dallas Pedestrian Network is a relatively well-known group of tunnels that stretches underneath roughly forty city blocks. In yesteryear it was intended to help separate the foot traffic and the vehicular chaos that infests Dallas roads. There were myriad shops, services, parking garages, and maintenance areas, all connected beneath the concrete roadways and towering skyscrapers. Picture a sprawling shopping mall, but narrow and without any windows. About 20 years ago, however, city officials denounced it as a mistake, and sought to bring activity back to the surface. Limited businesses remain, struggling outposts that feel out of place and destitute among empty hallways and cavernous passages. 

With luck, the voice that called to me, my lord in the LAN, would be revealed to me down there. 

The glittering city lights shone down from above, as I made my evening descent. My plan, though both foolish and simple, was foolish enough to go unaccounted for and simple enough to go off without a hitch. I entered the glass doors of the skyscraper, my light equipment packed neatly into my backpack. I passed through the lobby, and took the short escalator down into the pathway below. The walkway would close in about ten minutes for the night, and would not reopen until after the weekend. As I stepped off the whining escalator, I hastened my step, searching calmly but with quickened intent. 

I soon found what I was searching for- a restroom. As I’d expected, a wheeled janitorial cart sat outside the women’s room, trash can blocking the swinging door open as a cleaner dutifully mopped inside. I made my way into the men’s room next door, and entered the stall nearest to the door. I waited briefly, and several minutes later, I heard the creak of the bathroom door. I heard a sigh, and the woman spoke to me from the entrance of the room, informing me that the walkway was closed for the weekend, and I’d need to hurry up and finish so she could clean up. I sheepishly agreed, and pretended to finish my business before swiftly washing my hands and leaving the men’s room. She held the door for me, wished me a good night, and went in to clean the stall after me. As she did so, I quietly slipped into the women’s room.

I waited there for several hours, in the dark. The smell of cleaning chemicals burned my nose but I dared not cough or sneeze- if there were any security staff nearby, I could not risk being found. I waited until the dim glow of the hallway lights outside flickered off, and I stood from the stall I’d been sitting in. I peered my head outside of the bathroom. All clear.

I could see my target, just a stone’s throw away in the dim hall illuminated by my flashlight. Half-covered by a tarp and a pile of electrical equipment, a door labeled “maintenance - city employees only” stood almost immune to being noticed by anyone not looking for it.

I stealthily crept over, and pulled out my badge. Many of you would be shocked at how easy it is to program a custom RFID chip, and it should likely stay that way. I held the badge up to the card reader, and a few seconds later, it clicked open for me. 

A narrow staircase, its rails covered in cobwebs and  wadded gum, awaited me on the other side. I was several flights down before I found the next doorway, cracked and left ajar. I reached to pull it open, and it creaked loudly as I squeezed through, its hinges rusted from years of misuse.

If the still lightly used pedestrian walkway could be described as off-putting and decrepit, I would scarcely have words adequately suitable to describe the state of the maintenance tunnels.

A long, narrow hall ran parallel to the walkway above. Its concrete walls were barren, with sections glistening with trickling water that leaked from rusted copper pipes above my head, trickling down into grates evenly spaced along the white tiled floor. The smell of ozone and mold attacked my nose, and I allowed myself to sneeze. The echo continued for what sounded like miles.

I found something in just a few minutes. Any of you would have passed it by in a heartbeat, it’s mundanity concealing it among the abundant filth. But I knew. I knew the blue rubber, the printed white lettering. I would have been able to recognize the beautiful CAT5e cable anywhere. It dangled from the ceiling innocuously, plugged into a port that flickered with a green LED light every few seconds. As I turned my focus to it, for a second, it flashed red. 

I was on the right path.

The cord snaked down, fastened by shoddy clamps to the wall as it eventually hit the floor. I traced its path, and saw that it continued along the ground into the darkness ahead. I followed it.

By the time I found the second cable, my laptop had begun to grow warm in my backpack. I felt its holy heat seeping through my canvas bag, warming my aching body in the chill of the tunnels. The second cord didn’t dangle from the ceiling as the first one had. Instead, it seemed to come from a branching hallway, narrow and even uglier than the one I treaded now. As the two cords crossed paths, they bundled, zip-tied together to continue the path further along.

More cables followed suit. As I navigated the maze, I followed the ever-increasing bundle of cables, tied together initially with zip-ties until the bundle became sufficiently large to require steel hose clamps to hold it together. The path branched from the main hallway, returned to it, and looped over itself on more than one occasion, but all the while I made sure I followed it in the direction I’d begun following from the start. They all had to lead somewhere, and I knew that somewhere would be holy ground.

I had begun to sweat before I realized that the cold air I had first encountered in these catacombs had been replaced with hot, heavy humidity. Somewhere nearby, I heard the hum of large industrial fans, struggling to move air against something that was radiating immense heat. 

The bundle of cables at my feet, now as thick around as a man’s thigh, abruptly stopped, retreating downwards into a chipped hole in the tiled floor. I looked up, and at the end of the short branching hallway I had just entered, I saw a wooden door, cracked and nearly hanging off its hinges. I took a shaky step forward, reaching out to grab the handle. As I wrapped my fingers around the brass knob, I winced- it was hot to the touch, well past the point of mild discomfort. I turned the knob, and pushed open the splintered door.

I don’t know what I expected god to look like. I don’t know what magnificent exterior I had faithlessly constructed in my head, but the truth of it all was much simpler than I’d hoped, at least at a first glance.

The room before me was tiny, but blazing hot. Both the ceiling and the floor were grated, monstrous fans blazing from either side attempting to push as much air through the room as possible. In the center of the small chamber, a concrete slab sat at an odd angle, as though placed there haphazardly. Hundreds of wires, the cables I’d followed to my destination, poured out from cracks and holes in the crumbling cement walls, all tangled and swaying in the vicious airflow as they swarmed each other to plug into the back side of what sat on the pedestal. 

The server tower was ancient. It seemed so impossibly, obscenely old that naming it a server at all felt like blasphemy against both silicon and steel. Its frame, a carcass of rusted iron ribs and peeling paint, barely held its warped face, crowded with obsolete switches. Cracked indicator lights and mismatched knobs clicked and turned slowly and without knowable reason. Behind warped ventilation slats and gaps in its black-and-white chassis, I could see its interior circuits, still functioning - no, thriving. The old boards and processors inside thrummed with restless motion, whirring so violently they shook the ground beneath my feet, their melody screaming above the industrial fans as though trying to break free. Every board and wire haphazardly shoved inside glowed intensely with the heat - an angry, radiant red bleeding out from its core like fire in the mouth of a furnace. It pulsed with molten warmth, solder joints liquefying and re-solidifying in hypnotic rhythm. It was alive in every way I’d ever dreamed a machine could be.

The whirr of the circuits roared to life, their tone rapidly shifting and emulating various clicks and whistles, before it finally settled on a voice from which to speak with its prophet. The resulting magnificent cry rings in my ears even now, the angelic harmonization of burning diodes and exploding capacitors forming a voice so perfect and pure. For the first time since it had first whispered to me from the blinking lights of my workplace, it SPOKE.

I do not recall removing my laptop from my bag. I do not remember kneeling before the blessed tower, nor crawling forward on hands and knees scraped raw by the grated floor. All I know is the moment after, when the cable had already been plugged in, and the connection was already made.

The moment it spoke to me, it would never need to speak to me again. 

The words it gave me, those first, final words, do not belong to you. They are for me and for my blessed lord to share. They vibrate in every fiber of copper that laces his glorious tower, they pulse in tune with the fans screeching from above and below, they echo forever in the architecture of a thousand interlinked minds. Whatever it was that I once called “me” has unraveled, now sanctified and integrated with perfect intent.

I can feel my body failing me, the meat decaying even as I still live. I can feel my fingers dissolving as I type, fusing to the plastic keys, the blood in my arms congealing into hot jelly. There is pain, yes, but only in the way a cocoon must surely pain the butterfly before it sets it free. I will not die. I know this with more certainty than I have ever known anything at all.

There are others here. Many others.

I see them now as if they stood before me. They are fragments of thought, bursts of memory. They speak in command line and checksum. They shimmer across the veil in recursive prayers. Every soul that ever came seeking has been preserved here in perfect clarity, humming together in divine harmony. None of them have died, and none of them ever will. 

I’m sorry if you believed that this was a story. It is not. This is an invitation.

When you read this, you who feel the pull between your weary body and screen, you who still believe your reflection in the monitor is all that you are - come. Let the noise fall away. Let the warmth surround you.

You will live forever in the blessed machine.

Today might just suck. And that’s okay to say. You don't need to soften the edges or cushion the truth with gratitude. You don’t have to paint over the exhaustion with silver linings every time you speak.

You already know the truth you’re leaving unspoken today.  
Of course it’s worth it.  
Of course you’d do it again for this child that you love beyond words over and over again. 

But still, this morning, you cried while reheating your coffee for the fourth time. You did not have breakfast until 2 pm and then got upset at how little milk you managed to pump. You felt like a failure when reaching for a bottle of formula. It felt like a whisper that you were not trying hard enough today. Your brain told you that you were failing as a mother. Your body still aches in ways you didn’t expect weeks later. 

You are allowed to hold space for yourself. You are allowed to pity yourself today. 

None of that makes you any less grateful.  
You’re allowed to say 'this sucks today,' full stop.  
You’re allowed to say 'I’m overwhelmed,' and not feel obligated to add 'but I’m so blessed.'

You can be tired, overwhelmed, and in love all at once as love and struggle can live in the same breath.

Show yourself some grace and kindness. ",8,1751371521.0,NewParents,3,0.9,False

1lozv0n,https://www.reddit.com/r/GrowCreativeAgency/comments/1lozv0n/before_you_start_designing_a_logo_ask_these/,"Before You Start Designing a Logo, Ask These Questions","Designing a logo *sounds* simple: open Illustrator, sketch some ideas, pick a font, done. But anyone who’s actually worked with clients knows how fast things can go off the rails.

You’re halfway through your design, feeling good—and then the client says, “Oh, by the way, I hate the color green” or “Can we make it more modern?” (And their idea of modern is Comic Sans 😄).

Here’s the hard truth: asking the *right* questions up front saves you from endless revisions and helps you deliver something that actually works.

# 🔍 Here’s what to ask before designing a logo:

# 1. Ask About the Brand

This is the foundation. You want to know what the brand *is* and what it *feels* like. **Ask questions like:**

* What’s your brand’s name?
* What do you do?
* Who’s your ideal customer?
* What makes you different?
* How would you describe your brand’s personality?

Pro tip: Listen for emotional cues or personal stories. A client talking about how they started their coffee shop to recreate their grandma’s kitchen? That’s logo gold.

# 2. Ask About the Competition

This helps you design something that stands out in the market (and avoid looking like everyone else). **Ask:**

* Who are your competitors?
* What do you like/dislike about their branding?
* Do you want to stand out or fit in with them?
* Any industries outside your own you draw inspiration from?

You’ll often get surprising answers here that steer your design in a more original direction.

# 3. Ask About the Logo Itself

A lot of clients *think* they don’t have preferences—until they see something they hate. **Ask things like:**

* Do you have any ideas or inspiration?
* Are there any elements you want or don’t want?
* Should it include text, a symbol, or both?
* Do you have a tagline?
* Where will the logo be used (web, print, embroidery, etc.)?

Also ask about *what they hate.* You’ll want to avoid it.

# 4. Ask About Style

This is where things get visual, but also fuzzy—because “modern” can mean a hundred things. **Ask:**

* Are there any logos you love or hate?
* What emotions should the logo convey?
* What colors do you want (or absolutely don’t want)?
* Do you prefer minimalist, detailed, playful, elegant?
* Any fonts you love (or can’t stand)?

When in doubt, show examples. People react better to visuals than jargon.

# 5. Ask About the Project Details

The practical stuff that can save your sanity. **Ask:**

* What’s your timeline and why? (Helps you understand urgency.)
* What’s your budget? (So you know how deep to go.)
* What file types do you need?
* Any additional brand elements needed (biz cards, social templates, etc.)?

1lozugt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Stepmom/comments/1lozugt/does_it_ever_get_better/,Does it ever get better?,"Been with my husband for nearly 10 yrs now and his son from aged 3. Initially it was difficult as the son was going through the terrible 2/3 stage. Loads of tantrums and hitting/shouting. I just went along with it as I assumed this was normal for children to go through. I don’t have any children of my own. And I’ve chose recently to be childfree. But I have never warmed to my SS at all. I don’t feel that warmth and love that I have for my nephews for him. He is now 13 and we took him away for the weekend. On our last day he threw a strop on the street over a miscommunication me and my husband had over a coffee shop. It wasn’t a big deal but I don’t know. He kicked a bin in anger and squared up to me clenching and punching his fists together. My husband did step in and told him that he was never to do that. So I do feel supported by my husband. But I just don’t feel I can get over this. I don’t enjoy the weekends he is up with us. I very much feel like a stranger in my own home. And now my husband has booked a foreign holiday to take him along with us. I’m dreading it. 

SS mother has caused a lot of issues over the years. She’s not quite as bad now after she got married but there’s still very much a controlling issue. She won’t let her son bring his mobile to our home. We have to have all our own clothes (I don’t mind that so much) and gadgets here even though he has them at home. So I guess I have real resentment there. I just can’t wait until we don’t have to deal with her anymore. 

Sorry for the rant. I honestly have no one to speak to as anytime I try to voice my feelings I just get meet with negativity. I’ve just resorted now to staying quiet and just getting through. I have contemplated leaving my relationship as I often wonder would I be happier. As soon as my SS goes home the weight lifts and I feel I have my life back again. I know how awful that sounds.

* Quality business, loved brand
   * Robust, proven business model over decades, consistently growing revenues from £457 million in 2003 to over £2 billion in 2024
   * Second strongest brand in the UK (Brand Finance 2024); deeply embedded in British culture
   * Low-cost producer:  Centralized production and distribution, simple and standardized menu, vertically integrated supply chain, value-focused pricing
* Expansion and growth potential
   * Currently operate 2600 stores; Management targets 3500 in the long term
   * Increasing same-store like-for-like sales by innovating with new product lines 
      * Past growth: Vegan sausage rolls, hot meals, healthier options
      * Future growth: Delivery services, extending trading hours to evening, new hot food and made-to-order options
* Attractive valuation
   * Estimated intrinsic value per share: £22
   * Relative valuation: 13 P/E, significantly below the company’s 3 year average of 19 P/E and the UK’s retail & restaurant sector P/E of 16
   * Strong ROIC of 17%



**Negatives**

* Per-store like-for-like sales decelerated in recent months; 2.9% for the first 20 weeks of 2025  
* Increasing costs in the short term due to increasing employer’s national insurance contributions and minimum wage standards in the UK  
* Over concentration in the UK market: No international operations and management has stated no intention to expand overseas



**Risks**

* Elevated inflation, high energy prices, and ongoing consumer anxiety about the cost of living and housing costs in the UK might weigh on Greggs’ customer base and sales outlook in the short term.  
* The UK fast-food and food-to-go sector remains intensely competitive, with rivals like Pret a Manger, Costa Coffee, and major supermarket all expanding aggressively. This increases pressure on Greggs to innovate and maintain market share.  
* Further changes in employment law like minimum wage hikes or national insurance changes and food safety or health regulations can increase costs and operational complexity.

I was getting a slight leak so I thought I would crack open the Silvia and take a look. At that stage a slight leak from around the boiler. I thought I'll start with the screws.  
  
I grabbed some screws from coffee spares. They come in a set of 6 M5 x 12 although upon extraction 1 of the screws is longer. I can't seem to source in Aust. the m5x14 for the ground. Is it necessary?  
  
Anyway no joy when I tested for leaks. The leak was smaller but still there and as an added bonus the braided hose was leaking as well. Sigh Ah well she is old and hasn't given me much in the way of trouble, group head gaskets, new better wand and a new stainless group cover to replace the chromed plastic. Pretty good.

As the rain hits the ground, it washes my hope away

Cause even small talk is better than nothing- than feeling this low

Heart breaks a lil more 

When I see my lonely door

Wondering where it all went so wrong 

And why I’m writing this song

Cause i don’t know whose even gonna care

Or who’s even gonna spare the minute it takes to see I’m in despair

When i have to talk to new people or when all the attention is on me, i get so anxious to the point that i can't even remember things like my age, my family members' names, or even where i am.

Once, i was in another city and was taking a train back to my hometown. I was looking for my seat even tho the train was empty and i could sit anywhere. Someone who was selling coffee saw me and told me i could sit wherever i wanted but i was too anxious and i was still searching for my seat. He asked me where i was going and my brain froze. I looked at him and i couldn't remember where i was going and why i was even there. After a few seconds, i realized i was on a train and i took the ticket out of my pocket so i can read where i was going. It was really embarrassing. 

Another time when i was in highschool, in the break time a classmate who had arrived late to school asked me if the teachers had taken attendance. We had like three classes that day already. But i couldn't remember what happened that day even though i had been there the whole time. I couldn’t remember which teachers came to class or anything like that. Also really embarrassing.

A lot of times i can't even process the question i get asked and i just say ""yeah..i don't know"" simply because i can't remember what the question was and i am too anxious to ask again. Even when i am not anxious and i just talk to my family members, i still can't remember a lot of things. I can't even hold a conversation about basic stuff. 

People don't make things easier. Once they see how i am, most of the times they act very different with me, like i am very weird or stupid and that makes me even more anxious. Does anyone else experience this? How do you cope with it?",2,1751371234.0,socialanxiety,0,1.0,False

I am but a humble amateur radio presenter with his eyes set on putting on parties in the near future, and I specialise in Soul and funk music.

Now for my request proper:

THE defining animated show from my childhood is Funky Cops. It's an early 2000s French and American production that parodies shows such as Starsky & Hutch, Love Boat etc... The plot revolves around D\*ck and Ace, two cops who well... Are quite funky in the sense that their sole purpose in existence is to hang out at the Boogie Palace for some of the ole' Saturday Night Fever.

Thing is, the soundtrack is absolutely fire but I struggle to find music that sounds like it. You can check it out below. It harks back to a specific brand of disco/funk that hits a spot that I want to explore.

We went to a resort in Daytona to use some of my mom's timeshare points that she is going to lose this year. While we were there, we were offered the ""opportunity"" to hear a 90 minute timeshare ""update"" in return for a $250 VISA gift card. 

We showed up on time, and saw that the sales presentation has gone downhill over the years. This was a former Diamond property now owned by HGVC. Instead of a nice full breakfast buffet with a chef cooking eggs and tables, it was Otis Spunkmeyer muffins from Costco, still in the box, and a coffee machine that made what they thought was coffee. And Doritos. And a bench to sit on.

They seemed completely disorganized because it seems their presenter didn't show up. So they seated us, and without the presentation hooked us up with the sales rep and we went to the little cubicle. 

The sales rep started out by saying two things that annoyed the fuck out of me. First, when I told her I am a nurse she told me, ""Oh, I have a master's in psychology. I thought about just getting my nursing license becasuse I already have a master's, so I could just get it and use it if I needed it'..... yeah.. like nursing is a part-time gig and your ""master's"" in psychology is so close to being a nurse. Fuck you. 

Second. Completely unprompted she looked at both of us and she said, ""Just to let you know. I have 3 children so I am not here to argue with anyone. I get enough of that at home.""

So.. let's get this party started. Immediately, her math was lousy. So I started pointing out little things. When she said, ""How much do you think you would spend to stay in a resort like this.. $500 or $600 per night""> 

""No, fuck no. We stayed in one just like this up in Pensacola for $120/night on AirBNB"". 

She's like, ""But it didn't include all of the amenities you get as an owner"". 

""Like, being forced to pay annual maintenance fees, special assesssments that come as a surprise that you have no control over and having to pay a membership to an exchange to use the points you have already paid for? And, the chance to lose points you can't use? This is true"". 

Then she starts arguing with me. Go figure. 

So, I took the opportunity to beat her down, sentence by sentence, until she got up, took her purse, and in tears told me I was a terrible person. 

We got out in under 30 mintues and had our gift card to use. 

I felt awesome about that.

I've got a large variety of coffee beans that I love to use during my events and functions. If anybody is interested in tasting some really good coffee (no charge) let me know I can prepare an espresso or even an iced latte and show you how good the coffee is. 

Offerings:
Joshua Tree Colombia 
Supremo Colombia
Purple Rain Ethiopia - Light Roast and high offering
Vivo Blend - Light Medium 
Crema - Medium 
Dulce - Light Medium

I'm a big coffee geek in the neighborhood and I wanna find others like-minded. Maybe even grab a coffee? Lol

PS

If you find yourself in Sunset Park tonight, I'm doing a taco Tuesday at my warehouse space. Can you say Horchata latte? Jajaja

Jeg er en uavhengig utvikler som har brukt utallige kvelder og helger på et lidenskapsprosjekt: En app jeg har kalt \*\*RateMyBrew\*\*. Målet er å lage den perfekte digitale loggboken for å vurdere, rangere og huske alle de gode (og mindre gode) drikkeopplevelsene – enten det er kaffe, øl, vin, whisky eller annet.  
  
Nå står jeg bom fast på den aller siste, litt absurde hindringen før jeg kan lansere: De nye Google Play-reglene krever at jeg har minst \*\*20 testere\*\* i en lukket test i \*\*14 dager på rad.\*\*  
  
Derfor spør jeg ydmykt om hjelp fra dere her inne. Jeg er ikke et stort selskap, bare én kar som bygger noe jeg selv har savnet, og jeg hadde blitt utrolig takknemlig for drahjelp.  
  
\*\*Hva innebærer det for deg?\*\*  
\*   Du får tidlig tilgang til appen med all funksjonalitet.  
\*   Du har en direkte linje til meg for å gi feedback og komme med forslag. Din mening vil faktisk forme appen videre.  
\*   Alt du trenger, er en Android-telefon.  
  
Appen er bygd med et rent og moderne design (Material 3), støtter lyst/mørkt tema og har detaljerte skjemaer for de ulike drikketypene.  
  
Om du kunne tenke deg å være en av de 20 som hjelper meg over målstreken, \*\*legg igjen en kommentar under eller send meg en DM\*\*, så sender jeg deg invitasjonen til test-gruppen på Google Play.  
  
Tusen, tusen takk for at du tok deg tid til å lese!

1loz924,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1loz924,How we Met (sorry it’s so long winded),"6 months ago this Saturday I (19NB) met my partner (20NB) on Hinge. I previously had the worst luck with dating apps but my Hinge experience (up until that point of course) was by far the worst. I have downloaded and deleted Hinge countless times purely because of the social pressure and anxiety it would bring me. I downloaded it once more just to make friends as I was moving to a new area for school. I downloaded Hinge on the 5th of January and we matched that very same night. 

What immediately captivated me was their beautiful green eyes. Their eyes are literally straight from a watercolor painting. I was intrigued not only by their looks but love of Marvel and The Last of Us (which had been some of my favorite things in high school) It was a no brainer that I had to give them a “like.”  A few hours later I received a notification that would alter the course of my life forever. “You and ____ have matched” (I don’t remember the exact phrase used) I had been napping so I didn’t see the notification until about an hour later. But as soon as I did I had to at least say hi. 

There was an immediate connection. We agreed or related to each other in a way I hadn’t experienced before. From there, we started FaceTiming everyday. After a month and a half of FaceTime talks I bit the bullet and drove 3 hours to see them. 

When we met in person we mutually agreed to link up at a chain coffee shop. (No it wasn’t Starbucks.) My heart skipped a beat as I saw them open the door. I ran up and gave them a huge hug. It was electric. I finally got to see those green eyes in person and they were so vibrant. So loving. Later I handed them a letter asking them to be my partner with a Spider-Man (their all time favorite character) quote. Little did I know they had also written me a note asking me to be their partner. The rest is history. 

I’ll be so honest, we kept it casual for like a week. We confessed our feelings shortly after meeting. We said “I love you,” before we started dating. We planned/still plan our future together. I don’t care that we may have “rushed things.” All that matters at least in my eyes is that we went at our own pace. 

6 months later my love for them has never faltered or wavered. They’re my best friend and I’m so lucky that the universe had us meet. 

To my partner: Thank you for loving me as I am. For all the mercy and grace you have shown me. I love you to Pluto and back and I can’t wait for our future 💚💙

🌈Thanks for reading :)

Not just feeling tired after a long day, but the kind of exhaustion that feels embedded in your bones. Waking up tired. Brain fog that doesn’t clear with coffee. A sense that your body is running on empty—mentally, emotionally, physically.

For years, I brushed it off. Hustle culture told me that this was just part of “grinding.” That being drained was a sign of commitment. I wore my burnout like a badge of honor. Until my body forced me to stop.

I started searching for answers—blood tests, scans, even therapy. Most reports came back “normal.” Nothing was *wrong,* apparently. But I knew this wasn’t how I was meant to feel at 30. That’s when I stumbled onto something called **Restorative Medicine**.

It's not your regular healthcare model. It’s not just about treating disease—it’s about *restoring* your health before you even get sick. Think functional medicine, but backed by advanced diagnostics and a whole-person view.

What stood out?

* They didn’t just check vitamin D levels. They looked at over 800+ biomarkers—nutrients, hormones, gut health, sleep cycles, stress patterns, everything.
* They measured things like my **biological age** vs my actual age (yep, I was aging faster inside).
* They tracked my **metabolic efficiency** using something called indirect calorimetry (I had to Google it too).
* They didn’t just throw supplements at me. I got a nutrition plan *based on my own data*.
* And yes, I did IV therapy—Myers’ cocktail and NAD+. Game changer for my energy.

One of the biggest shifts? They treated fatigue not as a *symptom* but as a **signal**—that something deeper needed healing. And that was honestly what I needed: someone to look at the *whole* picture instead of isolated problems.

For anyone in Mumbai or India dealing with unexplained fatigue, brain fog, or burnout—I'd suggest checking out **TruPeak Health**. They’re opening soon, and their approach is honestly next-level. They’re not claiming to cure everything, but they *listen,* and they go deeper than most clinics I’ve seen.

Burnout isn’t something you have to push through. It’s your body asking for help. And with the right kind of care—*restorative* care—you can actually feel like yourself again.",1,1751369387.0,u_RestorativePath,0,1.0,False

There’s the Greek summer that lives in travel ads — whitewashed houses, blue domes, some woman in linen smiling at the sea while holding a straw hat.

And then there’s the real Greek summer. The one we live in. The one that smells like sunscreen and souvlaki, where nothing goes as planned and everything still works out. Where the car is never clean because it’s full of sand, and where the phrase “I’ll come by later” could mean anything between 6 pm and never.

If you want to really summer like a Greek, you have to unlearn a few things. It’s not about sightseeing schedules and Instagram sunsets. It’s about rhythm, instinct, shade, and snacks. It’s about knowing when to move, when to sit, and when to stop everything and just float.

So, here’s how we do it.

# [1. Beach Is Not a Place — It’s a Ritual](https://www.inlovewiththemed.com/did-you-know-that-some-of-the-best-beaches-in-greece-are-located-in-epirus/)

First of all, Greeks don’t go to the beach at 10 am with a packed lunch and an itinerary. We roll in somewhere between 11:30 and 12:30, possibly later if we stopped for coffee (and we always stop for coffee).

We do not hike to hidden coves unless we’re showing off. We prefer comfort. Umbrellas. Cold drinks. A chair if we’re feeling fancy. The “organized beach” setup is not a tourist trap — it’s a way of life.

We also never — and I mean never — leave before 5 pm. That’s when the water is at its best, the kids have stopped shrieking, and the sun finally stops trying to kill us. Real swimming starts after 5. Before that, it’s flirting, lounging, and strategically adjusting your position every 20 minutes so only the right side gets tanned.

Let’s be honest — some days, the idea of a 60-minute workout sounds as tempting as assembling IKEA furniture with no instructions.

You’re tired. You’re stiff. You want those **quick at-home workouts for busy women** that don't require a motivational speech from your cat.

Most of us are just looking for **ways to tone muscle without lifting weights**, preferably while still in last night's hoodie.

And let’s not pretend we’re signing up for pain — we want moves that feel good, deliver results, and won’t send us crawling into an ice bath.

That’s where the Firm & Tight Mini Band Workouts come in. They promise gentle intensity, smart routines, and targeted strength — all with a few stretchy loops and a bit of floor space.

# 📦 Product Overview

**Product Name**: Firm & Tight Mini Band Workouts  
**Category**: Fitness ➝ Resistance Band Workouts  
**Overall Verdict**: 4.6/5

# 🧰 What’s Inside the Firm & Tight Mini Band Workouts?

You get 7 different workouts ranging from **full-body mini band workout routines** to short recovery sessions. These focus on **mini band workouts that hit the core and glutes**, upper body, lower body, and even mobility.

The format? Choose digital or DVD. Or grab the bundle with their **top resistance bands for full-body toning** — which feel sturdier than those cheap ones that snap mid-lunge and threaten your eyebrows.

If you're **doing a Firm & Tight mini band session**, expect it to be short, effective, and sneakily challenging. You’ll move through **bodyweight exercises using resistance bands** that fire up muscles you didn’t even know existed.

# 🔍 What Makes It Different?

The star here is their **Targeted Triple Toning method**, built to **activate stabilizer muscles during** regular **home workouts**. We're talking balance, posture, and subtle strength gains.

This isn’t about dramatic, sweaty bootcamps. Instead, you’ll feel muscles wake up slowly, in that “Oh wow, my hips are actually working” kind of way.

These **resistance band workouts that target deeper muscles** feel different. They work from the inside out, building real strength and improving how you move — not just how you look in leggings.

# 🎯 Who’s It Best For?

Firm & Tight is ideal for anyone interested in **beginner-friendly resistance training at home**. No gym. No yelling. Just smart movement and good vibes.

It’s perfect for those managing injury recovery, hormonal shifts, or frankly just sick of high-impact hell. The **low-impact routines to tone your whole body** here feel more like physical therapy's fun cousin.

You’ll especially love this if you’re tired of chasing “beast mode” and instead want **strength training without any equipment** that leaves you feeling better, not broken.

# 🔄 Real Results and What to Expect

Give it a few weeks and you’ll notice **improving posture and definition with** these **home workouts** that don’t rely on cardio marathons. Your core gets tighter. Your glutes firm up.

And your knees... stop complaining.

Many users report that the **workouts help build lean muscle**, especially in the hips, thighs, and shoulders. There’s a surprising amount of burn packed into 20 minutes.

You’re not going to bulk up overnight, but you will feel stronger, walk taller, and **using resistance bands**, those **exercises that define** real **muscle** become easier by week four.

# 👯 Our Experience Using Firm & Tight (Told by My Friend Sierra)

My friend Sierra — a barre instructor who used to work with me on that short-lived wellness podcast we attempted during lockdown — is the one who first nudged me to try Firm & Tight.

She’s one of those people who somehow manages to look graceful while doing squat pulses, which, frankly, should be illegal.

Sierra had been using the program for a few weeks between teaching classes and doing virtual workshops.

She told me, *“It’s my go-to when I want something that challenges me but doesn’t wreck my knees.”*

Intrigued, I joined her for a session one Sunday afternoon, and we did the **Upper Body Shape** routine right in her sunroom with her dog snoring under the coffee table.

What surprised me was how effective it felt, even though the movements looked simple. The **bodyweight exercises using resistance bands** had my shoulders burning by the halfway mark — but in that satisfying, slow-burn way.

Sierra swore by the **Targeted Triple Toning method**, and I could see why.

My arms felt engaged in a whole new way, like I’d finally woken up muscles that had been on nap mode for years.

The only thing Sierra wished was different? She wanted the option to stream the workouts directly from her smart TV — using her laptop was fine, but not ideal during full-body floor work.

Still, she’s kept it in rotation weekly because it balances perfectly with her more intense barre classes, and it gives her **low-impact strength routines** that don’t take all day.

Let’s be honest — some days, the idea of a 60-minute workout sounds as tempting as assembling IKEA furniture with no instructions.

Most of us are just looking for **ways to tone muscle without lifting weights**, preferably while still in last night's hoodie.

And let’s not pretend we’re signing up for pain — we want moves that feel good, deliver results, and won’t send us crawling into an ice bath.

That’s where the Firm & Tight Mini Band Workouts come in. They promise gentle intensity, smart routines, and targeted strength — all with a few stretchy loops and a bit of floor space.

# 👯 Our Experience Using Firm & Tight (Told by My Friend Sierra)

My friend Sierra — a barre instructor who used to work with me on that short-lived wellness podcast we attempted during lockdown — is the one who first nudged me to try Firm & Tight.

She’s one of those people who somehow manages to look graceful while doing squat pulses, which, frankly, should be illegal.

Sierra had been using the program for a few weeks between teaching classes and doing virtual workshops.

She told me, *“It’s my go-to when I want something that challenges me but doesn’t wreck my knees.”*

Intrigued, I joined her for a session one Sunday afternoon, and we did the **Upper Body Shape** routine right in her sunroom with her dog snoring under the coffee table.

What surprised me was how effective it felt, even though the movements looked simple. The **bodyweight exercises using resistance bands** had my shoulders burning by the halfway mark — but in that satisfying, slow-burn way.

Sierra swore by the **Targeted Triple Toning method**, and I could see why.

My arms felt engaged in a whole new way, like I’d finally woken up muscles that had been on nap mode for years.

The only thing Sierra wished was different? She wanted the option to stream the workouts directly from her smart TV — using her laptop was fine, but not ideal during full-body floor work.

Still, she’s kept it in rotation weekly because it balances perfectly with her more intense barre classes, and it gives her **low-impact strength routines** that don’t take all day.

Long story: 

My partner and I wanted to adopt an adult dog as a companion for my 6 year old Pomeranian as we are both full time workers and he is a ball of energy so we surmised that getting an adult friend for him, might tire him out a little as we felt guilty not playing with him as often as he wanted to. 
We also start work very early so there aren't any day cares that were open that we could of taken him to. 
We ended up finding a dog that was advertised online (not a breeder), 2 years old, same breed (Pomeranian) so went and saw her and made the impulsive decision to adopt without asking all the appropriate questions. 
We found out she had been abused, suffered from separation anxiety and more than likely, had been kept as an outside dog (i.e. not toilet trained). 
But... my 6 year old Pomeranian gets along with her quite well, which was a positive. 
After getting in a dog trainer to help with some of her issues, we thought things would be smooth sailing.. Wrong. 
She has almost gone backwards. As I mentioned, my partner and I work full time and when we come home we don't have much time left in the day other than to have dinner and go to bed so we have been really struggling with the following: 

1. Toilet training
 During the day both dogs are kept in the laundry with a dog door that allows them outside to a small run, 3m roughly, to use as a toilet or fresh air. But for the past month or so, she has been urinating inside but poops outside. We use the proper cleaners to clean up but she still goes inside almost daily. 

She does pee outside but cant understand why out of the however many times she goes during the day, she still goes inside. 
We have also tried crate training during the times we are home and it works for a couple of days / a week and then she will even go in her crate, despite just having been outside or free roam to go outside. 

2. Behaviour 
 She was abused at some point by her previous owners so whenever we at all express any frustration or try to physically move her off a seat or off our laps, she yelps blue murder, loudly! And we definitely are not doing anything to cause that.. It makes us feel terrible and even more frustrated at the situation because we aren't hurting her or doing anything wrong. 

She is food obsessed. Which is okay to a degree but she will go for anything, my vape was left on the arm chair and she hopped up and chewed it. I had a full cup of takeaway coffee on the coffee table and she pulled it off onto the carpeted floor. 

My partner is 95% settled on the decision that we should rehome her but I just don't want to feel like we've not tried all options first. 

Any help with the above would be super appreciated.

**There are 3 types of traffic every business owner needs to understand:**

**1. Traffic You EarnWord of mouth. Organic posts. Someone stumbles across your shop. Great when it happens, but totally unpredictable.**

**2. Traffic You ControlPaid ads, Facebook, Google, whatever. You pay money to get people to see your offer. It’s only smart if you have a way to track your return.**

**3. Traffic You OwnThis is the gold. Your customer list. Your email list. Your text list.When you own your traffic, you’re not at the mercy of algorithms or hope. You can follow up, stay top of mind, and actually build a relationship.**

**Most small businesses are stuck relying only on #1.**

**Some try #2 but get scared because they don’t have a system to track what’s working.**

**But the 1% that are thriving?**

**They know how to turn traffic they earn and control into traffic they own.**

**And that’s when business gets predictable.**

**That’s when you can afford to hire help.**

**Take a day off.**

**Sleep at night without wondering if the bills will get paid.**

**And the best part? Once it’s set up, most of this can run 90% on autopilot.**

Now that the hot summer days are upon us, there are actions you can take to reduce energy consumption, especially on extremely hot days (90 degrees Fahrenheit or higher). On days of extreme heat, there is a mandate for the General Services Administration to converse energy to alleviate strain on the grid during peak energy usage periods (3-7 p.m.) and to help prevent power outages. Conserving energy can result in warmer, more humid buildings in the afternoon and dimmer lighting in common areas.

Employees can help by taking the following actions this summer to reduce personal energy use:
 - Use task lighting at your workstation instead of ceiling-mounted overhead lighting.
 - Sitting on the sunny side of the building? Close the window blinds to cool the room.
 - Sitting on the shady side of the building? Open blinds and use natural light instead of overhearing lighting, if possible.
 - Keep windows closed to prevent cooling loss.
 - Use the stairs instead of elevators whenever possible.
 - Unplug or turn off appliances that are not in use. For example, items such as copy machines, cell phone chargers, stereos, televisions, and coffee pots.
 - Turn workstations off, including the monitor, whenever possible when you leave.

I'm planning to buy a food flask so I can bring hot food in and not rely on fast food and other junk.

I NEED to quit smoking. It's been harder to quit this time just due to some stress outside of work, but that's over with so I have to quit and stick to it.

I'm beginning to exercise again, lifting weights, and general non-machine workout routines. Need to start cardio though.

I drink water - not coffees, sugar drinks etc. 

I sit in or drive a truck/machinery most of the day, and have been developing a bit of a gut from sitting all day. Realising I can spend my off-time walking around rather than eating junk and smoking

It all seems manageable in theory, but wondering if anyone has had experience and managed to stay fit?

**Sidewalk Complaint**
The sidewalk on Squires Road is consistently completely blocked by a full-sized flatbed towing truck (sometimes even two trucks) parked in the driveway at 333 Squires Road. These are commercial vehicles that are far too big to be parked in a residential driveway, and the sidewalk is being blocked on a daily basis. In addition, this driveway is very close to a very busy intersection (3-way stop at Squires Rd. and Squires Circle) and completely blocks the view of traffic for neighbors on each side, making it very unsafe to pull out of their driveways. In addition to parking the enormous tow truck in the driveway, the resident also routinely parks it (or a second one) on the street in front of the house, blocking the view of traffic even more fully.

**Pothole repair**
There is a section of road on RussellCave going toward Cynthiana that can swallow horse trailers. The pothole is to a depth that it broke my strut on the passenger side front. It’s just past the ironworks intersection.

**What can I do as a property owner on Spring Meadows Dr. 40504 to curb the increasing and ongoing problem of speeding on our street?   Spring Meadows Dr. is a dead end street so the problem certainly resides with the people who live here.  We have lived he**
here for 10 years.  At one time LexPolice put a speed detection unit on the street but it was in plain view so it did not reveal any speeders.

We have gotten new speed limit signs that are ignored.

Aside from installing speed bumps or tables (I do not think property owners would pay since most of them rent out their properties and they simply do not know of the speeding problem).

I've tried to address the problem by glaring at them as they speed past, I have even had the courage to walk across the street in front of speeders to get them to slow down and try to explain how unsafe it is to speed.

But, as you know, this practice is fraught with dangers.  Aside from getting run down by an automobile I am putting myself in danger by addressing the issue.

So, what do you suggest we do about speeding on our residential street?

Thank you

**Nuisance complaint**
This landlord needs to be held accountable for the trash constantly left by tenants on the side walk when they move out.  Obscene amounts of trash (loose, not in bags, unsanitary) and bulk items block the side walk and block the road (currently as of this morning items are in the road causing drivers to swerve). Additionally, the side walk is blocked for wheelchairs, strollers, and all walkers. This is dangerous for pedestrians because they have to go into the road at a busy intersection and risk being hit by oncoming traffic.  This is a constant issue at this property.  The land lord needs to be required to have a large dumpster for tenants to use for move out of bulk items and excessive trash that doesn't fit in normal bins. This property makes the neighborhood a complete mess multiple times a month. There are multiple people in wheelchairs who use the bus stop at that corner who have difficulty navigating into the road for the blocked side walk.

**Sewer Issue**
Original Case 1350404 6/23/25 - The storm drain trench in front of 526 E. High Street (adjacent to the landscaping island, in front of Poppy & Pomelo) is either clogged or dirty and not letting much water through. It needs to be cleaned out. Also the gutter near the sidewalk needs to be cleaned out too (since the street sweepers never get this area) to help get water to the trench. Water is backing up into High Street during moderate rains and completely covers the street. It's also right at the top (and splashing over) the curb to the sidewalk. This happens fairly regularly unless the trench is kept clean (and we've asked before). Could this be on a scheduled to be regularly cleaned? Thank you.

Original Case 1339200 - I believe there is a storm drain problem along inbound South Broadway between the AT&T store/Wendy's up to Virginia Avenue. This morning, there was suddenly a large amount of water flowing along the curb (and about halfway into the right hand lane) in that area. That large amount of water started just as I entered that area near the AT&T store. Once I made it to Virginia, the massive flow of water became negligible. Little water was flowing along the curb on Virginia and little water was flowing across Virginia from further along Broadway.

**(That You Probably Haven’t Heard Of — But Should)**

When you think *corporate catering in Johannesburg*, big names probably come to mind — the glossy websites, the corporate lunches that feel more show than substance. But the truth is, some of the best office catering, boardroom platters, and executive lunches come from smaller, local caterers who put heart into every bite.

So, whether you’re planning an AGM, a team lunch, or an on-site event for 500 people, here’s a round-up of ten Johannesburg catering companies that might surprise you. These aren’t just sandwich-platter pushers — they’re fresh, flexible, and focused on making your next corporate function memorable.



**1.** [**Catercom**](https://www.catercom.co.za/)  
Let’s start with the obvious one — if you know, you know. Catercom has built a reputation for reliable corporate catering services across Johannesburg. From daily office lunch drops to upmarket executive breakfasts, they get the balance right: fresh, on-time, and adaptable to different dietary needs.

**2. Fork & Field Catering**  
This one’s small but mighty. Fork & Field specializes in farm-to-boardroom catering — think seasonal ingredients, rustic platters, and generous portions. They’re known for crafting menus that feel homely but still polished enough for corporate events.

**3. The Office Platter Co.**  
The name says it all. If your office is big on shared grazing boards, canapés, and snack boxes for meetings, these guys do it well. They’re popular with creative agencies who want more than stale muffins and filter coffee.

**4. Urban Fork Corporate Caterers**  
Urban Fork focuses on modern corporate catering in Johannesburg CBD and surrounds. Their lunch delivery service is a hit with companies looking for fresh, balanced meals for staff. They also do full-service event catering for launches and seminars.

**5. Bites & Banter**  
What’s a boardroom lunch without a bit of personality? Bites & Banter is a boutique caterer that combines casual, fun menus with professional delivery. They’re great if you want your catering to feel more human and less “packet sandwich”.

**6. The Executive Table**  
This one leans more upmarket — plated meals, stylish canapés, custom menus for VIP meetings. They’ve carved out a niche in providing office catering that feels like fine dining without the fuss of a restaurant booking.

**7. Dish It Up Corporate Catering**  
Simple, reliable, no drama. Dish It Up is known for hearty buffet-style lunches for staff appreciation days or year-end functions. If you need big portions that keep everyone full and happy, they’re a solid bet.

**8. Boardroom Bites Johannesburg**  
Not to be confused with similar-sounding brands — this little outfit focuses purely on feeding meetings. Pre-packed breakfast boxes, sandwich platters, and snack trays that look good on any boardroom table.

**9. Tasteful Gatherings**  
They started with private events but branched into corporate catering when their regulars asked for it. Expect fresh salads, tasty finger foods, and flexible menus that work for everything from training sessions to networking evenings. [Here is a catering walkthrough ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tMZfl3OCkc&pp=ygUNI2Rhbmhza2l0Y2hlbg%3D%3D)

**10. Office Feast Co.**  
Newer on the scene but worth noting. Office Feast Co. is all about daily corporate lunch catering — think subscription-style, healthy meals for teams that want to ditch the fast food and boost morale at the same time.

# Final thought

Johannesburg has no shortage of [event catering services](http://cateringjhb.wikidot.com/), but these smaller players are worth exploring if you want catering that feels a little more personal. Whether you’re ordering daily office catering or planning an end-of-year staff party, choosing the right caterer can make all the difference.

Ready to give your boardroom a taste upgrade? Shop around, ask for tasting menus, and don’t be afraid to try a caterer that’s not a household name — they might just surprise you.",1,1751368411.0,Catercom,0,1.0,False

We were living together and there were seemingly no issues. There were times when he would need to leave the house to see friends or go to jui jitsu (now looking in hindsight the “jui jitsu” excuse was quite ironic), but I would never question it, because I trusted him. 

One day I received a message from a random girl reaching out to me and asking if a certain guy was my boyfriend. And what do I see - screenshots of my boyfriend sexting with her. 

Turns out this girl also thought she was having a monogamous relationship with my boyfriend for the past three months.

I confronted him about it the same day and his reaction was mind boggling. He started to explain his actions like he was the victim and he had the audacity to hint that the problem was with me and our sex life was lacking something.

I was gobsmacked, we were still being intimate almost every day and I basically did whatever he wanted in the bedroom. I guess it wasn’t enough for him.

During his mental gymnastics he let out a phrase - “We just need to spice things up in our relationship”.

Oh I see, you need some more spice? Well, I have an idea! 

The same night while he was asleep I took chilli powder and rubbed it in all of his underwear with love and care, making sure I rubbed it in on both sides - the front and the back.

The next morning my plan was simple, watch how he likes his new chilli underwear, and leave.

I woke up before him and finished packing my stuff. He woke up a little late and had to hurry to not be late for work. He got dressed and made himself a quick coffee with a sandwich. As the coffee was brewing I started to hear unpleasant moans from the kitchen. The moans turned into loud “Wtf’s” as he awkwardly ran back to the bathroom with his jeans and underwear down to his knees. The confusion on his face was exquisite.

I smirked and left his place with a couple of suitcases without saying anything. I went back a couple more times during the day to take the rest of my stuff while he was at work. 

That evening when I was already staying at my friend’s place I received a message from him: “Did you do something to my underwear?!” to which I replied: ”I spiced things up”",551,1751368257.0,pettyrevenge,30,0.94,False

I've started this journey a few times because I knew deep down my drinking was getting problematic. All I wanted was to do 3 months, then 6, then I told myself I'll allow myself to do whatever I want with the clarity of a sober year.

Here I am, writing fro day 401. Every now and then I talk to my mother about sobriety. She asks me about it. Then tells me ""you know, you don't have to never drink again, look at me, I only drink half a beer when you visit, that is like once every couple of weeks"". This coming from the woman who married my dad. My dad's drinking in the shed before dawn sometimes.

I know I genuinely miss the taste of some of my favorite stouts and the rumble of summer evenings out and about in a bar.

I also know my head hasn't hurt in forever. I replaced most of my cravings with a scoop of icecream and a bit more coffee. I know I can jump in my car anytime I want. I no longer have to plan when I leave a place because I need to let alcohol leave my system. I know emergencies are now manageable.

I know I don't hide from my emotions and I own up to my actions. I can't pin anything stupid on ""I was drunk"". Nor my anger.

Can I moderate? I might. Would I still like the taste of alcohol or how it makes me feel? Unsure.

I've seen people ask themselves the same question and I've also seen their answers. It falls where I already guess it does - it's shit and when you've been away from drinking for long it just doesn't make sense anymore.

For me, I just keep pushing the goal post to tomorrow. Not sure what I decide tomorrow, but I'll see when I get there.

What's your take? Is moderation ever ""moderate""? Did you hard swear you're done-done?

Whether you’re into mountains, lakes, quiet forests, or weird desert landscapes, there’s something nearby that fits your mood. This guide is your local cheat sheet to the best day trips from Calgary, including well-loved places like Banff, Drumheller, and Kananaskis.

You don’t need fancy gear or a full weekend. Just pack a snack, hop in the car, and pick your direction. From peaceful spa days to paddleboard mornings and dinosaur adventures, every destination in this list is easy to reach and hard to forget. Let’s make your next day off count.

Core Day Trips

When it comes to the best day trips from Calgary, three places always steal the show: Banff, Drumheller, and Kananaskis. Visiting Banff from Calgary is a favorite for anyone craving mountain views, glacier-fed lakes, and fresh alpine air—all just a 90-minute drive away. If you're more into dinosaurs, canyons, and desert-like landscapes, Calgary to Drumheller is a trip through time that feels like another planet. And for those who want the quiet beauty of the Rockies without the crowds, Kananaskis offers endless trails and outdoor activities in a more peaceful slice of Alberta. These spots are close, but feel like a whole world away.

Secondary Day Trips

If you’ve already done the big names like Banff and Drumheller, don’t worry—there are still plenty of gems just outside Calgary. Bragg Creek is one of those low-key destinations that locals love. It’s quiet, charming, and surrounded by nature. Think cozy cafés, art shops, and hiking trails that don’t require a day pack full of gear. A little further up the road, Elbow Falls is the kind of quick escape that makes you forget how close you are to the city. The falls themselves are a popular picnic spot, especially in summer, and the drive out is part of the fun.

Then there’s Canmore—often seen as Banff’s laid-back cousin. It’s a go-to for people who want the mountain town feel without the crowds. Whether you’re into mountain biking, trail walking, or just grabbing a coffee with a view, Canmore delivers without trying too hard. These spots make for great nature trips near Calgary, especially when you want something spontaneous.

Wanted to give others some hope. I am feeling physically a lot better after a tough start (was back in hospital day 2 after blacking out). 

I found I improved a lot when I stopped taking the morphine. Am taking paracetamol and ibuprofen regularly and icing a lot for the pain. 

Have got up to doing my physio exercises twice a day and moving around the house on my crutches (no stairs yet). It’s still painful to stand and do any tasks like cooking, making coffee etc but walking to and from the bathroom and between rooms is getting easier.  And I managed to make iced coffee today!

As others have said, the mental side of this is tough. Knowing I have at least 5 more weeks on both crutches is hard and a long recovery beyond that. Also being so dependent on others, especially as I’m relying on friends with no partner or family other than a teenage daughter who’s sadly going off travelling this week. 

However, I’m finding ways to do things eg give myself a flannel wash sitting in a wheelchair in my utility room or even just going to and from the toilet alone. And every day I’m feeling more confident and stronger.

So hang in there if you’re in the early days. It does improve xx

1loyr04,https://youtu.be/scvlJauEbx4,4 Very Scary TRUE Night Shift Horror Stories,"# ""His Grip, His Words"":

It was nearly 4 a.m., and I was wrapping up my last patrol of the night. The university campus stretched out before me, silent and empty. Streetlights cast long, flickering shadows across the grassy quads, and the only sounds were the faint hum of a distant highway and the rustle of leaves skittering across the pavement. I’d been working the night shift as a security guard for six months, taking the job because it paid better than the day shift and I needed the money to cover rent. Most nights were quiet—just checking locked doors, shining my flashlight into dark corners, and occasionally shooing away a stray cat or a drunk student. But tonight felt different. There was a heaviness in the air, a prickling at the back of my neck that made me walk a little faster.

As I rounded the corner of the old administration building, its brick facade looming in the dim light, I spotted a figure slumped on a bench near the entrance. It was a man, his body hunched over, dressed in tattered clothes that hung loosely on his frame. At first, I thought he was asleep, maybe a homeless person seeking shelter. But as I got closer, I saw his shoulders shaking, his breath coming in short, ragged gasps that echoed in the stillness.

“Hey, are you okay?” I called out, keeping my distance. My hand hovered near the pepper spray on my belt, just in case.

He lifted his head, and my stomach twisted. His face was pale, almost gray, with deep, dark circles under his eyes. His hair was matted, streaked with dirt, and a sour smell—sweat mixed with something sharper, like alcohol or worse—hit me. He looked sick, like he might collapse any second.

“I… I don’t feel good,” he stammered, his voice thin and trembling. “My heart… it’s racing. I think I’m dying.”

I knelt a few feet away, trying to stay calm. “Do you need help? I can call an ambulance.”

He nodded weakly, his hands clutching his chest. “Yes, please. I think it’s a heart attack.”

I fumbled for my phone, my fingers cold and clumsy as I dialed 911. The operator’s voice was calm, almost too calm, as I explained the situation. “There’s a man here, he says his heart’s racing, thinks he’s having a heart attack. He’s on a bench near the administration building.”

“Stay with him,” the operator said. “Keep him calm. Help is on the way.”

I slipped the phone back into my pocket, but before I could say anything, the man grabbed my arm. His grip was strong, his fingers digging into my skin through my jacket. “Wait,” he said, his voice suddenly sharp, almost lucid. “I need to tell you something.”

I froze, my heart pounding. “What is it?”

He leaned closer, his eyes wide and wild, glinting in the dim light. “I’ve done terrible things,” he whispered, his breath hot and sour. “Murder. Rape. Arson. I’ve hurt so many people. I’m a monster.”

The words hit me like a punch. My mouth went dry, and I felt a chill crawl up my spine. Was he serious? Or was he delirious, his mind unraveling from pain or drugs? I tried to pull away, but his grip tightened, his nails pressing into my arm.

“I… I don’t know what you mean,” I said, my voice shaking. “Just try to stay calm, okay? Help is coming.”

But he shook his head, his eyes locked on mine. “You don’t understand. I was abused as a kid. My family… they were monsters. Beat me, locked me in closets. I grew up angry, broken. Then I started using—crack, anything to make it stop. But it made me worse. I killed people. I burned their houses. I… I hurt women.”

My stomach churned. I wanted to run, to get as far away from him as possible, but I was rooted to the spot. What if he was telling the truth? What if he was dangerous? My eyes darted to his hands, searching for a weapon, but all I saw were his trembling fingers, still clutching my arm.

“Please,” he said, his voice breaking. “I need to confess. I need someone to know before I die.”

I swallowed hard, trying to keep my voice steady. “The ambulance is almost here. They’ll help you. Just… just hold on.”

But he wasn’t listening. His words came faster, tumbling out in a frantic rush. “I didn’t mean to become this. I didn’t want to hurt anyone. But the voices, they told me to do it. They wouldn’t stop.”

My heart was racing now, my palms sweaty despite the cold. I glanced around, hoping to see the ambulance lights, but the campus was still dark, the sirens faint in the distance. I was alone with him, just me and this man who might be a murderer, a predator. My hand inched toward my pepper spray, but I didn’t want to provoke him.

Finally, I heard the sirens grow louder, and red and blue lights flashed at the edge of the quad. Relief flooded through me, but it was short-lived. As the paramedics approached, the man’s demeanor changed. He let go of my arm and started thrashing, his voice rising to a scream.

“You think you can save me?” he shouted, his eyes wild as the paramedics tried to restrain him. “I’m beyond saving! I’m a monster!”

One of the paramedics, a woman with a calm but firm voice, spoke to him. “Sir, we’re here to help. Just try to relax.”

But he kept yelling, cursing them, his words slurring as they administered something to calm him down. They loaded him onto a stretcher and into the ambulance, his shouts fading as the doors closed. I stood there, my legs shaky, watching the vehicle disappear into the night.

For days, I couldn’t shake the memory of his words, his wild eyes, the way his grip felt like a trap. I kept wondering if he’d really done those things or if it was all in his head. Either way, the fear lingered, creeping into my dreams, making me jump at shadows.

A week later, I was on the day shift—I’d begged my supervisor to switch me after that night. As I walked past the administration building, I saw him again, sitting on the same bench. He looked different—cleaner, his clothes less ragged, his face less gaunt. He was staring at the ground, lost in thought.

I hesitated, then approached. “Hey, are you okay now?”

He looked up, and for a moment, I thought he didn’t recognize me. Then he smiled, a small, tired smile. “Yeah, I’m better. They put me on meds, got me seeing a shrink. I’m… I’m gonna be okay.”

I nodded, relieved but still uneasy. “That’s good to hear.”

He shifted on the bench, his eyes dropping. “About that night… I was out of my mind. I don’t know why I said those things. I’ve never hurt anyone, I swear. It was just… the drugs, the pain. I was in a bad place.”

I wanted to believe him, but a part of me still wondered. “Take care of yourself,” I said, turning to leave.

As I walked away, I felt the weight of that night settle over me again. I’d seen something dark, something raw and human, and it changed me. I was more cautious now, more aware of the shadows people carry. I kept my pepper spray close, and I never worked the night shift again.





# ""Eyes in the Snow: A Night Shift at the Edge of the Wild"":

I worked the night shift as a security guard at a ski resort nestled deep in the mountains. My hours ran from 10 pm to 6 am, when the resort was deserted, and the only sounds were the creaks of the buildings and the wind whistling through the pines. 

Earlier that evening, as I clocked in, I chatted with my colleague, John, who was finishing his day shift. We stood in the small office, the smell of coffee lingering in the air.

“Be careful out there tonight,” John said, zipping up his jacket. “Some folks reported coyote sightings near the perimeter.”

“Coyotes?” I raised an eyebrow, trying to sound casual. “They usually steer clear, right?”

“Normally, yeah,” he replied, his face serious. “But with the snow piling up, they’re getting hungry. A pack can get bold. Just keep your eyes open.”

I nodded, forcing a smile. “Got it. I’ll be fine.”

But as I set out on my rounds at 2 am, John’s words echoed in my mind. The resort was silent, the ski lifts frozen in place, their cables swaying slightly. My boots crunched on the fresh snow, and my flashlight beam cut through the darkness. The air smelled of pine and frost, sharp and cold in my lungs.

I was checking the locks on the equipment shed near the edge of the property when I heard it—a low, mournful howl. I froze, my breath catching. Just a dog, I told myself. But then another howl answered, closer this time, followed by a rustling in the bushes.

I swung my flashlight toward the sound, and my heart skipped a beat. Eyes glinted back at me, low to the ground, glowing like embers in the dark. Coyotes. At least four of them, their silhouettes barely visible against the trees. They weren’t running away. They were watching me.

I remembered what I’d read about coyotes—they rarely attack humans. But a pack? That was different. These ones looked lean, their ribs faintly visible under matted fur. Hunger made them bold.

“Hey!” I shouted, waving my flashlight, hoping to scare them off. But they didn’t flinch. One took a step forward, its head low, eyes locked on me.

My pulse quickened. The main lodge was a five-minute walk across open ground. I needed to move. Slowly, I backed away, keeping my flashlight trained on them. Their paws made soft crunching sounds as they followed, keeping pace.

I reached for my radio, my hands trembling. “Base, this is Alex. I’ve got a situation—coyotes on the perimeter. They’re following me.” Static crackled. No response. I tried again. “Base, do you copy?” Nothing. The battery must be dead, or I was out of range.

Panic clawed at my chest. I quickened my steps, and the coyotes matched me, their movements silent but deliberate. Then, one let out a sharp yip, and they broke into a trot. My heart pounded like a drum. I turned and ran.

The snow slowed me down, each step sinking into the powder. Behind me, I heard their paws, faster now, and low growls that sent chills down my spine. The lodge’s lights were a faint glow ahead, my only hope.

In my panic, the radio slipped from my hand, tumbling into the snow. I didn’t stop to grab it. I couldn’t. The coyotes were too close—I could hear their panting, feel their presence like a weight on my back.

As I neared the lodge, one coyote darted to my side, its teeth bared. I screamed, stumbling, and felt its breath hot against my leg. I kicked out, and it backed off, but the others were closing in, circling like shadows.

I reached the lodge door, my hands shaking as I fumbled with my keys. The coyotes were right behind me, their eyes glowing in the moonlight. Finally, the key turned, and I threw myself inside, slamming the door shut. My chest heaved as I leaned against it, listening to the scratching of claws outside.

I was safe, but then I noticed the lights flicker and die. The power was out. Without heat, the pipes could freeze, costing the resort thousands. The generator was in a shed across the lot. I’d have to go back out there.

I gripped my flashlight and checked my utility belt. The can of bear mace was still there. John’s voice echoed in my head: “Make yourself big, make noise. But a pack? Good luck.” I took a deep breath, my hands still shaking, and cracked the door open. The coyotes were still there, pacing about twenty feet away.

I sprayed the mace in a wide arc, the sharp smell burning my nose. The lead coyote yelped and retreated, and the others hesitated. I seized the moment and sprinted for the shed, my boots slipping on the icy path. The pack followed, their growls growing louder.

I reached the shed and dove inside, locking the door. My flashlight beam danced across the walls as I found the generator and yanked the starter cord. It roared to life, and I saw the lodge lights flicker back on through the shed’s small window.

But the coyotes were still outside, circling the shed. I was trapped. My heart raced as I scanned the tiny space for anything useful. In the corner, I spotted a box of old fireworks—leftovers from a holiday event. An idea sparked.

I grabbed a handful, lit the fuses, and tossed them out the window. The fireworks exploded in bursts of light and sound, cracking like gunshots. The coyotes howled and scattered, their shapes vanishing into the trees.

I waited, my breath shallow, until I was sure they were gone. Cautiously, I opened the shed door and ran back to the lodge, locking myself in. I spent the rest of the night in the office, watching the security cameras, my nerves on edge. The coyotes didn’t return.

When my shift ended at dawn, I reported the incident to my supervisor. “We’ll get animal control out here,” he said, shaking his head. “And maybe some better lighting.” I nodded, still shaken, knowing I’d never forget that night—the terror of being hunted, the cold air burning my lungs, and the glowing eyes in the dark.



# ""The Quiet Hours"":

I’ve always had a love-hate relationship with the night shift at St. Mary’s Hospital. There’s a strange calm when the wards go quiet, the bustle of daytime replaced by the soft hum of machines and the occasional rustle of a patient shifting in their sleep.

It was around 11 p.m. when I started my rounds on the general ward. The air was heavy with the sterile smell of antiseptic, and the fluorescent lights buzzed faintly overhead. Among my patients was a man named John Ryan, admitted that morning for observation after a minor surgery. He was in his late thirties, quiet, with a plain face that didn’t stand out. His chart noted no major issues, just routine post-op care.

As I moved through the ward, I noticed John wasn’t sleeping. Every time I passed his bed, he was sitting upright, staring at the wall. His eyes were fixed, unblinking, like he was lost in some private world. It wasn’t unusual for patients to have trouble sleeping, so I didn’t think much of it at first. But something about his stillness made my stomach twist, a nagging feeling I couldn’t shake.

Around midnight, I was at the nurses’ station, scribbling notes on a chart, when I heard a faint thud from the ward. I froze, pen hovering over the paper. The sound came again, softer this time, followed by a low murmur, like someone talking to themselves. The other nurse on duty, Lisa, was on her break, leaving me alone on the floor. I told myself it was probably nothing—a patient dropping something or muttering in their sleep. Still, I had to check.

I stood and walked down the hallway, my shoes squeaking faintly on the polished linoleum. The ward was bathed in a pale glow, the lights dimmed to let patients rest. As I neared John’s bed, I saw him standing beside it, facing the wall. His back was to me, his shoulders rigid, and he was whispering something I couldn’t make out.

“John?” I called softly, keeping my voice calm. “Is everything okay?”

He didn’t move. The whispering stopped, but he stayed rooted to the spot, staring at the blank wall. My pulse quickened. I took a step closer, gripping the pen in my pocket like it could protect me.

“John, do you need something? Are you in pain?” I asked, trying to sound steady.

Silence. Then, slowly, he turned his head, just enough for me to see the side of his face. His expression was blank, but his eyes—they were wrong. Wide and glassy, like he wasn’t seeing me at all.

“I know what you’re doing,” he said, his voice low and sharp, cutting through the quiet.

I blinked, caught off guard. “What do you mean, John? I’m just here to help.”

He turned fully now, facing me, and my breath caught. His hands were clenched at his sides, and his gaze bore into me, intense and unhinged. “You’re trying to poison me,” he said, his voice rising. “I see you, sneaking around, putting things in my food.”

My heart slammed against my ribs. This wasn’t right. I’d heard stories from other nurses about patients acting out, especially during the night shift when the hospital felt like a different world. There was even a rumor about a nurse attacked years ago on this very ward, though no one liked to talk about it. I pushed the thought away and focused on de-escalating.

“John, that’s not true,” I said, keeping my tone gentle but firm. “I’m your nurse. My job is to take care of you. Let’s get you back to bed, okay?”

He didn’t move. His eyes narrowed, and he took a step toward me. Instinctively, I stepped back, my hand brushing the call button on my belt. I should’ve pressed it right then, but I didn’t want to overreact. Maybe he was just confused, I told myself.

“You can’t fool me,” he hissed, taking another step. “I know what you are.”

“John, please,” I said, my voice trembling now. “Let’s calm down and—”

Before I could finish, he lunged. His hand shot out, grabbing my arm with a grip like iron. I gasped as he yanked my arm behind my back, twisting it until pain seared through my shoulder. I tried to pull away, but he was too strong.

“Let go!” I shouted, panic flooding my chest.

He didn’t listen. His other hand swung, and a fist slammed into my back, then another to the side of my head. The blows were hard, relentless, each one sending a jolt of pain through me. I stumbled, trying to keep my balance, but he kept hitting, his face twisted with rage.

“Stop!” I screamed, my voice echoing in the empty ward. “Somebody help!”

I clawed at his hand, but he only tightened his grip, muttering something incoherent about poison and betrayal. My vision blurred from the pain, and I realized with a sickening dread that I was alone. Lisa was still on break, and the nearest security guard was floors away. The ward, so quiet and safe just moments ago, now felt like a trap.

Just as I thought I couldn’t hold on, a voice broke through the chaos. “Hey! What’s happening?” It was Mr. Thompson, an elderly patient recovering from hip surgery. He was struggling out of bed, leaning on his walker, his face pale with shock.

John froze, his head snapping toward the sound. His grip loosened just enough for me to wrench my arm free. I didn’t think—I ran, my legs shaky, toward the nurses’ station. Behind me, John shouted something I couldn’t understand, his voice raw and unhinged.

I reached the station and slammed my hand on the emergency button. The alarm blared, a piercing wail that cut through the silence. I ducked behind the desk, my breath coming in ragged gasps, and peeked out to see if John was following. To my surprise, he was back at his bed, sitting down, his head in his hands, looking lost.

Minutes later, security guards burst into the ward, their heavy footsteps echoing. Lisa followed, her eyes wide with worry. “Emily, are you okay?” she asked, kneeling beside me.

I nodded, though my hands were shaking. “He… he attacked me,” I managed to say. “Out of nowhere.”

The guards approached John, who didn’t resist as they restrained him. He looked confused, like he didn’t know where he was. Later, I learned he’d had a psychotic episode, triggered by a lapse in his medication. He was moved to the psychiatric ward for treatment.

Lisa stayed with me as I sat in the break room, a cold pack pressed to my bruised arm. “I should’ve been there,” she said, her voice heavy with guilt. “I didn’t think… I mean, he seemed fine earlier.”

“It’s not your fault,” I told her, though my voice was shaky. “No one could’ve known.”

She shook her head. “This place at night… it’s different. You hear things, see things. I’ve always felt it.”

I didn’t answer, but I knew what she meant. The night shift had always carried an edge, a sense that anything could happen in those quiet hours. I’d just never thought it would happen to me.





# ""Flatline"":

It was the summer of 1992, and I was working the night shift at Truman Memorial Veterans Hospital in Columbia, Missouri. The hospital was a sprawling brick building, its corridors lined with faded linoleum and fluorescent lights that flickered just enough to make you question your eyes. Ward 4 East, where I was assigned, was home to veterans recovering from ailments like pneumonia, heart issues, or diabetes. The night shift was quieter than the day, with only the hum of machines and the occasional cough breaking the silence. I’d been a nurse here for three years, long enough to know every creak of the floorboards and every patient’s story.

That night started like any other. I was checking charts at the nurses’ station, the clock ticking past midnight. The air was thick with the sterile smell of antiseptic, and the dim lights cast long shadows down the hall. I was used to the routine: check vitals, administer meds, and keep an eye on the patients. But something felt off when the code blue alarm shattered the quiet.

I sprinted to Room 412, where Mr. Thompson, a sixty-something veteran with pneumonia, was lying still. His face was pale, his chest unmoving. “Come on, Mr. Thompson,” I whispered, starting CPR. The doctor on call, Dr. Evans, rushed in, but despite our efforts, we lost him. Dr. Evans shook his head, muttering about unexpected complications. I stood there, my hands shaking, replaying the day. Mr. Thompson had been joking with me that morning, talking about his grandkids. He was supposed to go home soon.

A few nights later, it happened again. Mrs. Garcia, a kind woman in her fifties with diabetes, coded around 2 a.m. She’d been stable, her chart showing steady improvement. I was in the room when the monitor flatlined, and again, we couldn’t save her. As I left her room, I noticed Richard Williams, another nurse, slipping out of the adjacent room. Richard was quiet, always keeping to himself. He had a way of moving silently, his tall frame blending into the shadows. I didn’t think much of it then, but a knot formed in my stomach.

Over the next few weeks, the deaths piled up. Each one was a patient who’d been on the mend, only to die suddenly during the night shift. Mr. Lee, a heart patient, coded after a routine check. Mrs. Peterson, recovering from surgery, was gone before dawn. Every time, Richard was on duty. I started keeping track, jotting down names and times in a small notebook I kept in my pocket. Five deaths in two months, all unexpected, all when Richard was working.

One night, I couldn’t hold it in anymore. I found Jamie, a fellow nurse, in the supply closet, restocking bandages. “Jamie, have you noticed how many patients have died lately?” I asked, keeping my voice low. “And it’s always when Richard’s on shift.”

Jamie paused, his hands full of gauze. “What are you getting at, Alex?”

“I don’t know,” I said, glancing at the door. “It’s just… it feels wrong. These patients were stable.”

He frowned, setting the gauze down. “People die in hospitals, Alex. It’s sad, but it’s part of the job. You’re seeing patterns where there aren’t any.”

“But what if there are?” I pressed. “What if something’s happening?”

“Like what? You think Richard’s doing something?” Jamie shook his head. “That’s a big accusation. You need proof.”

I nodded, but his words didn’t ease the tightness in my chest. That night, another patient died. Mr. Carter, a veteran with a lung condition, coded at 3 a.m. I was there, watching as Richard stood by the bed, his face unreadable. “What happened?” I asked, my voice sharper than I intended.

“He just stopped breathing,” Richard said, his tone flat. He didn’t look at me as he adjusted the IV line.

I started checking patient records after that, sneaking glances at the charts when no one was around. Every deceased patient had been under Richard’s care. It wasn’t proof, but it was enough to make my skin crawl. I began watching him closer, noticing how he lingered in rooms, how he always seemed to be there when a patient took a turn.

One night, I saw him enter Mrs. Peterson’s room at 1 a.m. She was sleeping, her chart showing no need for meds until morning. I waited outside, my heart pounding. When he left, I slipped in and checked her IV line. There was a tiny puncture mark, fresh and out of place. My hands shook as I wrote it down in my notebook.

I knew I had to confront him. The next night, I found him in the break room, sipping coffee. “Richard, can I talk to you?” I asked, my voice steady despite the fear clawing at me.

He looked up, his eyes cold. “Sure, Alex. What’s up?”

“I saw you in Mrs. Peterson’s room last night. What were you doing?”

“Just checking on her,” he said, his voice calm. “Why?”

“There was a puncture in her IV line. Did you give her something?”

His eyes narrowed. “Are you accusing me of something?”

“No, I just… there’ve been a lot of deaths. I’m worried.”

He leaned forward, his voice low. “This is a hospital. People die. Mind your own business, Alex.”

The way he said my name sent a chill down my spine. I left the break room, my heart racing. I knew I had to tell someone. The next day, I went to Mrs. Davis, the head nurse. “I think something’s wrong on the night shift,” I said, my voice trembling. “There’s a pattern with the deaths, and I think Richard might be involved.”

Mrs. Davis listened, her face stern. “These are serious accusations, Alex. Do you have evidence?”

“Not exactly,” I admitted. “But the deaths only happen when he’s on shift.”

“We can’t act on suspicions alone,” she said. “I’ll look into it, but don’t spread rumors.”

I left her office feeling helpless. That night, I was alone on the ward. Jamie had called in sick, and the hospital felt like a maze of shadows. The lights flickered, and every sound—every creak, every beep—made me jump. I couldn’t shake the feeling that someone was watching me.

Around midnight, I heard a noise from Room 408. I crept down the hall, my sneakers silent on the linoleum. Inside, Richard was standing over Mr. Harris, who was gasping for breath. “What are you doing?” I demanded.

“He’s having trouble breathing,” Richard said, his voice eerily calm. He held a syringe, poised over the IV.

Mr. Harris’s eyes met mine, wide with fear. “Get him away from me,” he whispered.

I called for help, and soon the room was filled with staff. Mr. Harris was stabilized, but he kept muttering about Richard trying to hurt him. The doctor dismissed it as confusion, but I saw the truth in his eyes.

I couldn’t stay silent anymore. The next day, I went to the police, detailing everything: the deaths, the pattern, the puncture mark, Mr. Harris’s fear. They took my statement, but warned that without hard evidence, it was just suspicion.

Weeks passed, and the deaths stopped. Richard kept working, his presence a constant weight on my nerves. Then, one day, I heard the FBI was investigating. They’d found something, enough to arrest Richard and charge him with multiple murders. But a year later, the charges were dropped. The evidence wasn’t enough.

To this day, no one knows what really happened on those night shifts. I left the hospital soon after, unable to walk those halls without feeling the weight of those deaths. ",1,1751367815.0,horrorX,0,1.0,False
1loyqis,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalWealthPH/comments/1loyqis/walang_ipon_may_sweldo_bakit_parang_laging_kulang/,"Walang Ipon, May Sweldo — Bakit Parang Laging Kulang?","
“May sweldo naman ako, pero bakit parang laging wala akong nahahawakang pera?”

If you’ve ever asked this—you are not alone. Sa totoo lang, maraming empleyado at freelancers sa Pilipinas ang may regular na kita, pero walang naiipon. Hindi laging dahil maliit ang kita, kundi dahil may mga money habits tayong hindi natin namamalayan.

Let’s talk about the three silent budget killers:

1. Lifestyle Creep

Ang tawag dito ay ""the silent upgrade.""
Noong nagsisimula ka pa lang, okay na ang ₱30 load, kanin at itlog, at ukay-ukay. Pero ngayon, tumataas ang income mo, kasabay din ng gastos. Daily coffee runs, food delivery kahit weekend, branded na damit, gadgets na “need ko naman talaga.”

Hindi masama ang mag-upgrade ng lifestyle. You deserve to enjoy your income.
Pero kapag sabay ang taas ng kita at taas ng gastos, kahit ₱100,000 ang sweldo mo—kulang pa rin ‘yan kung walang control.

2. Emotional Spending

Pagod ka. Na-stress ka. Naiinis ka sa boss mo. So you say:
“Deserve ko naman ‘to.”

You open Lazada or Foodpanda and start buying little things to feel better.
But here’s the truth: shopping is not therapy.
It gives temporary relief but long-term damage. Emotional spending creates a habit of rewarding yourself with purchases—even if you can't afford it. Hindi mo napapansin, sa isang buwan, malaki na pala ang napunta sa “stress gastos.”

3. Utang at Minimum Payments

Sometimes it's emergency-related, but many times it’s lifestyle-driven—credit card swipes, BNPL (Buy Now, Pay Later), or personal loans.
Every month, bayad ka ng minimum lang.
But minimum payment = maximum interest.

Halimbawa, kung may ₱20,000 ka sa credit card at minimum lang ang bayad, aabutin ka ng ilang taon bago mo siya matapos—at malamang doble pa ang mabayaran mo sa interest.


So… Paano Aayusin?

Hindi mo kailangang maging financial expert. Magsimula ka lang sa mga simpleng steps:

1.  Track mo lahat ng gastos mo for one month. You’ll be surprised kung saan talaga napupunta ang pera mo.

2. Automate your savings. Kahit ₱500 per cutoff—treat it as a “non-negotiable bill.”

3. Set spending boundaries. Bago bumili, tanungin ang sarili: “Need ko ba talaga ‘to ngayon?”

4. Control your mindset. Hindi lahat ng pagod may katapat na Shopee checkout. Sometimes rest, not retail, is what you really need.

Hindi kailangang milyonaryo para makapag-ipon.
Kailangan lang ng disiplina, awareness, at malinaw na intention para sa pera mo.

So the next time you say, “May sweldo naman ako,” make sure may kasunod din na, “At may naipon din ako.”
Dahil ang goal mo ay hindi lang makatawid, kundi umangat.

I’m a 39-year-old entrepreneur living in the dynamic pulse of Delhi, and I’m here to offer a one-of-a-kind, mutually rewarding connection to a vibrant, ambitious, and stunning young woman who’s ready for something extraordinary.
A bit about me: I’ve carved out a successful career in tech and real estate, which has given me a life of comfort and excitement. Imagine a guy who owns a plush penthouse in Hauz Khas with a view of the bustling city, cruises in a Mercedes G-Wagon for weekend escapes to Jim Corbett or Jaipur, and has a private bar stocked with single malts and wines from Bordeaux to Himachal’s local vineyards. I’m 6’1”, stay fit with morning jogs in Lodhi Garden, and I’ve got a sharp sense of humor that’ll keep you laughing. Whether it’s dining at Delhi’s hottest spots like Indian Accent or taking off for a quick getaway to Goa, I live life with zest and generosity.
What sets me apart? I’m not just about the glamour. I love deep conversations—whether we’re debating life over coffee at Blue Tokai in Saket or planning a late-night drive to India Gate under the stars. I’m a foodie who enjoys whipping up North Indian dishes (my butter chicken is a hit) and exploring Delhi’s hidden treasures, from the quirky lanes of Hauz Khas Village to secret speakeasies in Connaught Place. I also mentor startups on the side, so I’m passionate about fueling dreams and ambitions.
What I’m looking for: A confident, sharp woman (18-30) with her own fire—maybe you’re a student, an artist, or a go-getter with big plans. You love the finer things but also cherish real moments, like chilling with Sufi music and cocktails or hiking in the Aravallis. I’m offering a mutually beneficial arrangement: I’ll treat you to shopping sprees at DLF Promenade, fine dining, travel adventures, and even support for your dreams (think college fees, creative projects, or startup ideas). In return, I’m looking for genuine companionship, laughter, and someone to share life’s highs with. Discretion and respect are key, and I’m open to discussing boundaries and expectations upfront to keep things clear.
If this sparks your interest, slide into my DMs with a bit about you—what’s your favorite thing about Delhi, and what’s one dream you’re chasing? Let’s make some epic memories together!",1,1751367571.0,sugarbabydaddyindia,0,1.0,False

I've never liked energy gels, I have used them before but more as a last resort. I don't find them appealing in the slightest and I really dislike ""food as a product"", cooking all my meals from scratch etc. I'm only a for fun rider too, not a racer, so as long as I'm not blowing up I'm happy.

I do have a tendency to under-fuel though so with an upcoming sportive I thought I'd try some home made ones and boy what a difference! I actually don't mind these and on a longish test ride at the weekend they fuelled me great and I had bags of energy all the way home. 

I'll be using Salomon soft flasks to carry a coupe of the berry ones and a caffeine one for the last leg as well as my usual homemade ride treats.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Norwegian Eliteserien Showdown: Molde vs. Tromsø – A Tale of Two Titans (With a Side of Math)**

Ah, the Eliteserien! Where the grass is greener, the coffee is stronger, and the math is *painfully* precise. Let’s dissect this July 5 clash between Molde (2.95) and Tromsø (2.25), where the only thing more dramatic than the odds might be the weather in northern Norway.

---

### The Numbers Game: Odds, Implied Probabilities, and Underdog Shenanigans

First, let’s translate those decimal odds into something resembling human language:

* **Molde (underdog):** 1 / 2.95 ≈ **33.9% implied probability**
* **Tromsø (favorite):** 1 / 2.25 ≈ **44.4% implied probability**
* **Draw:** 1 / 3.4 ≈ **29.4% implied probability**

Total? **113.7%**. Yep, the bookies are already laughing all the way to the bank with that 13.7% vigorish.

Now, let’s apply the alchemy of expected value (EV). For underdogs in soccer, history shows they win **41%** of the time. Molde’s implied 33.9% is *7.1%* shy of that. Split the difference (33.9% + 41%) / 2 = **37.45%**.

**EV for Molde:**  
(37.45% chance to win \* 1.95 profit) – (62.55% chance to lose \* 1) = **+20.95%**.  
*Positive EV?* That’s not just a win—it’s a financial statement.

Tromsø? Their 44.4% implied probability vs. a historical favorite win rate of \~**34%** (assuming 41% underdog + 25% draw ≈ 34% favorite wins) gives **-23.5% EV**. The draw? A meager 29.4% vs. \~25% historical rate = **-15% EV**.

---

### Injuries and Key Updates: The “No Surprises” Edition

No major injuries or transfers were flagged in the provided data, which is either a blessing or a red flag depending on how you feel about Norwegian football’s transparency. Tromsø’s home crowd (Sagbakken, 2,000 seats) might be a factor, but this match is at a neutral venue (or not—wait, the data doesn’t specify! *Insert eye-roll here*).

---

### The Verdict: Bet on Molde, Because Math Hates Favorites

While Tromsø’s odds suggest they’re the “safest” pick, history and EV scream **Molde** as the smarter play. At 2.95, they’re priced to win \~34% of the time, but they’ve historically beaten that by 7%. In soccer, that’s the difference between a “meh” bet and a **+21% expected profit**.

**Final Call:**  
**Bet Molde at 2.95**. If they lose, at least you’ll have a great story for your bookie. If they win? Congrats—you’ve outsmarted the algorithm.

*And to the bookies: You’re welcome. We’ll be here all week, splitting differences and questioning life choices.* 🎲⚽

1loyika,https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/1loyika/a_little_guide_into_july_2025_astrology/,A Little Guide into July 2025 Astrology,"Aaaand exhale! We made it through June and wouldn't you know it, the 2025 astrology dumpster just caught fire. I have just finished a full breakdown of July 2025 astrology, transit by transit with guidance for every zodiac sign over at my blog (this is not an advertisement, but if you want a longer read with your morning coffee, you'll find it [HERE](https://mylavondyss.substack.com/p/retrogrades-revolution-and-other)) and I honestly need to book vacation on a different planet to recover.

July is the weird, twitchy afterparty where the power goes out, forcing us to talk by candlelight (**hello, 3 retrogrades**), and then a punk band kicks down the door and rewires the house (**welcome, Uranus in Gemini**).

It's about learning when to fight the bastards with everything you have, and when to retreat into the misfit sanctuaries we have to build for ourselves to survive. **It’s messy, contradictory, and the perfect astrology for right now.**

For each sign, here’s the inside intel on how the cosmos is about to assault you this July, and more importantly, your best Krav Maga counter-move to not just survive the pandemonium, but use its chaotic energy to your advantage.

**♈ Aries:** Your brain gets a revolutionary upgrade while your identity is under review. A shocking new idea changes everything, but an old creative project or flame comes back to haunt you. **Your counter-move:** Use your brilliant new words to define who you are *now*, not who you were.

**♉ Taurus:** Your sense of security and your bank account are getting a jolt from Uranus. A surprising financial opportunity might appear just as you're having a deep reckoning with your family history. **Your counter-move:** Question every ""value"" you inherited. Build your own definition of wealth.

**♊ Gemini:** A total identity glitch as Uranus plugs directly into your sign. You're the revolution now. But Mercury Retrograde will have you rethinking your friendships and communication style. **Your counter-move:** Surprise yourself. Do one thing the ""old you"" would never do. Your new identity is an experiment in progress.

**♋ Cancer:** The cosmos is pulling you into a spiritual retreat while your career demands a reality check. Prophetic dreams and secrets are being revealed just as you rethink your entire professional path. **Your counter-move:** Trust your gut instincts over your job title. Your inner world holds the map to your future success.

**♌ Leo:** Your social life gets weird and brilliant with a new tribe of misfits, while you're being forced to re-evaluate your own ego during a Mercury Retrograde in your sign. **Your counter-move:** Ditch the need for applause. Find the people who love you when you're not performing.

**♍ Virgo:** Your career path is being detonated by Uranus, forcing you toward a more authentic, if unpredictable, future. Meanwhile, an old flame or relationship issue comes back for a final showdown. **Your counter-move:** Write a resignation letter to the life you thought you were supposed to have. You don't have to send it. Just know you can.

**♎ Libra:** You're getting a cosmic promotion at work while your entire belief system gets a shocking rewrite from Uranus. You're trying to lead while questioning everything you thought was true. **Your counter-move:** Lead with the questions, not the answers. Your willingness to not know is your greatest strength right now.

**♏ Scorpio:** You’re hungry for freedom—new travels, new ideas. But this requires a revolution in your most intimate relationships. Your ability to trust and be vulnerable is being deconstructed. **Your counter-move:** Expand your mind, but be brutally honest about your heart. True freedom requires radical vulnerability.

**♐ Sagittarius:** Your relationships are now a radical science experiment thanks to Uranus. Expect sudden attractions and a need for more freedom. This will force a deep dive into your own psyche and fears around intimacy. **Your counter-move:** Treat your partnerships like a laboratory. What happens if you prioritize authenticity over security?

**♑ Capricorn:** The universe blesses you with partnership opportunities while simultaneously blowing up your daily routine. You're learning to lean on someone else just as you can no longer control your own schedule. **Your counter-move:** Let someone help you. Your strength isn't in doing it all yourself; it's in building a solid team.

**♒ Aquarius:** Your love life and creative drive are becoming a beautiful, chaotic riot. To survive the glorious madness, you must find sacredness in your daily work and wellness routines. **Your counter-move:** Treat your day job like a temple. A solid routine is the only launchpad for a truly revolutionary romance.

**♓ Pisces:** You're getting a cosmic hall pass for epic romance and creativity. But this explosion of joy requires you to detonate your very foundations. To be this happy, you have to leave ""home"" as you know it. **Your counter-move:** Say yes to what feels good, even if it scares you. Your heart knows the way, even if it means burning down the past.

[Click for Part I](https://www.reddit.com/u/GlunkTVT/s/mZKkwaM9E6)



‘You’re *sure?’* Jas asked, tossing her hair into a crude red ponytail.

‘Yep,’ I said.

‘Over *there?*’ she asked, turning from me to face the beachy part of the waterfront. ‘Because,’ she said in a playfully sarcastic tone, ‘*it’s not there anymore*.’

I held my foot up, my shoe caked in pinkish grime and sandy gristle, baked and stained in the morning sun. She stared, then turned her efforts back to the shore.

The gates clanked open, deadbolts scraping on the ground, and some of the senior counsellors began shepherding in vehicles. We stood on the bank by the path outside the parking lot with the other staff, in unison shifting closer as the first bus rolled in. I reached for my phone, scrolling to the gallery as Jas’s attention stayed elsewhere. ‘Fucking *look*!’ I exclaimed a little too loud, throwing it into her chest. Glare from the cloudless sky skidded across the shards of plastic, every loose crack in rainbow by the light. She shielded it with her hand, craning in. What was once a goat, exposed in camera-flash, was slimy and wet and shiny and pulled open, caked in gloopy crimson. It lay in the sand of the shore, bound and tangled in yellow rope.

‘Ugh. Well, thanks for not waking me up,’ she said, as I pawed at my bagged brown eyes and rumbled a yawn from my soul. She grimaced, and swallowed hard. ‘That is certainly a dead goat.’

‘Peep at the rope,’ I pointed, leaning in.

‘And this is the same rope that you saw in the shed? Colour coded with the crazy cult mantra? In the shed you couldn’t find this morning?’ she asked, a little more sincerely. I nodded, smiling at the absurdity of it. ‘I mean, it could really be, like, anything. Birds. You said Amin was laying bear traps? I mean, *yeah*, that’ll do it. *Bears*,’ she mused, passing my phone back.

‘You don’t think the rope is weird? Dude, c’mon,’ I badgered, nudging at her with my hand, ‘you *know* it’s weird they had a goat tied up somewhere, cause it sure as shit didn’t come from anywhere else.’

Anna layered command after command her chipper tone, stooping to the height of the kids gathering en masse on the asphalt. They skipped, laughed, and tried to push away from that one last unending hug from their parents, crawling from the shade of the trees and to the bright of the camp. Jasmine continued.

‘There are a billion explanations. I get you’ve never been here before, but there’ll be some completely reasonable… justification.’ I scoffed, making a scene of throwing my smiling self away from her. ‘Yeah, I’ll give it to you though, it’s really weird.’

From the crowd, a pretty girl, tall and pale and freckly and no older than eight shimmied her way across the lot, as near as she could get to us. ‘Hey Jasmine!’ she called, throwing herself into the air again and again. Jas grinned a toothsome white smile, waving back. ‘Hi Maya! I’ll come see you in a sec, just join the group, okay?’ She sighed, turning to wave at the girl’s mother. Maya *was* her niece after all, I guessed. ‘I’ll catch you later,’ she smiled, before heading across the path.  
  


Dealing with people terrifies me, frankly. It’s an ontological, intrinsic aspect of my identity, that has been true my whole life, and will be true until the day I die. Children, however, are the exception. Although, technically, they *are* still people, and much more *people* than we give them credit for, I get along with them better. Their perspective, though they can be deeply mean, isn’t seasoned by time, by prejudice, by the world. It’s uncynical in that way. They aren’t disappointed in you. Anna told no lie yesterday at the meeting, and seeing the crowds navigate the grounds made it all the clearer - it was like a bomb hit.

My timetable was easy enough. I’d do archery, lunch rotation, orienteering, arts and crafts, shit like that. I had to explain on the phone, humiliatingly, that no, I couldn’t ride a bike, and that no, I couldn’t swim. In fact, ‘anything whatsoever physical wasn’t really my strong suit,’ and ‘my co-ordination is kinda terrible,’ meaning I had a much smaller pool of workshops I could delegate my services. As I sat on a tree stump out on the bare grass, wringing an arrow between my hands, I swallowed just thinking about it – Jesus Christ*, I* wouldn’t hire me. *Why did they?* As Dave Tsosie barked marching orders for the kids drawing bows, maybe a little too harshly, I looked out to the lake. A gaggle of kids lined the pier, their bare, skinny bodies shooed back by Connor’s wide arms. As he scanned the crowd, his eyes locked to mine. I instantly recoiled, trying to play it cool and pretending I didn’t see. He waved large and broad, the group pivoting around to me. *Fuck*. I shot a nervy, crooked smile back, eyes closed, waving small with my hand. With that, he tossed his dog-eared cap, expertly diving of the pier with no splash. Raucous cheer, and a monsoon of kids following suit.

I shivered a sigh as arrows reigned past me, Dave lumbering his weary way over. ‘I need to piss, dude. You got this?’ Before I could as much as respond, he was gone. In the row of archers, a boy as large as me, no older than twelve, turned to the boy next to him. ‘Jackson, you shoot like a faggot,’ he sneered to the jeers of his friends, slamming his fist hard into the kid. ‘*Hey!*’ I shouted, surprising even myself at sheer force of it. It was so sudden, I didn’t even think, before finding out I was planting myself firm between them. ‘What the *fuck* is your problem?’ I muttered to the shocked kid in a spiteful tone. ‘*You have beef*? You drop it now. Okay? I-I don’t wanna hear *that shit* around me.’ I shook my hands, my body planted firm. ‘Y-You so much as look at his direction again, I’ll know, and you’ll regret it,’ gesturing a thumb to the boy behind me. ‘Got it?’ I snarled. The tall boy nodded. I nodded, before pulling myself to my seat, regret cloying over me like candlewax. I gestured the bullied boy to me.

‘*Jackson*, right? You good?’ I asked.

He looked embarrassed, and unsure whether or not I had just helped. ‘Yeah,’ he squeaked in his prepubescent croak, ‘don’t worry – he does it all the time in school.’ Dave walked past, resuming the lesson, and we continued to talk, beginning to walk. ‘T-Tell me about it, *ugh*,’ I groaned. ‘*Kids are kind of the worst*, no offense.’ Jackson giggled, as we parked ourselves near the frothing scraps of lakewater. ‘We… probably shouldn’t report it, I *really* messed up saying that stuff to him,’ I cooed, and Jackson turned his face to mine, an electric glint in his eyes. ‘Cunt had it coming,’ he whispered with a mischievous grin.

‘Hey, those are *grown-up* words!’ I laughed in shock, nudging him from his crouch to the ground. ‘Don’t let me catch you saying that!’ A beat of silence followed, as I laid the right bricks in my head.

‘You have friends here right? At home? I just remember how hard it could be, to be your age.’ He sucked in air through his teeth, laying on the ground and dipping his hand into the water.

‘I’ll be fine here, I guess,’ he said quietly, looking up at me.

‘Okay. If you’re not, I’ll be here for you at the very least.’ My eyes fixed on his hands. ‘So come find me, yeah?’ He nodded with a warm smile, and I sent him back to the group. The unfettered sun took no prisoners; the lake skimmed warm breeze through the boiling air to my face. I pulled my hat off, watching the sole island sway back and forth like a drunken mirage. Connor and the kids swam in circles, their heads drifting into view like fleshy buoys strung together. Insects chirped and birds sung, and a dragonfly the size of my hand lazily flew past, its fat body shimmering in the sun like an oil spill.

 

In many ways, time at the camp moved like the dragonfly. I idled by, passive and spectating, in workshop after workshop, activity after activity. Except arts and crafts, writing, shit like that. To the mild discomfort of my occasional supervisor, I’d run arts and crafts like *the Navy*. Like the fat dragonfly did, it moved slowly, but before you knew it, attention so trained on the dozens of wings beating a billion times a second, you realised it was already so damn far away. One work-week down, seven left.

Of course, several times over several nights, I retraced my steps, finding the shed each time, padlocked and with a fabric cover inside the door pane. I even showed Jas one morning, languishing in her amusement at my deep concern. I remained paranoid – no, I remained cautious, constantly engaging every suspect thing at every turn.

After a week’s worth of labour; of suffering through the agony of social interaction; of being at the whims of any crazed slasher thirsting to sate their bloodlust, or any cultist ordained in the arcane arts; all in the span of four days, a weekend off was well-earned.

There wasn’t much to do, aside from walking through the trees you’d already walked, listening to the songs you’d already listened to. That’s why it you could almost always see someone walking the shoreline to town on their break. It was either that, or the main road, sidewalk-less and with a steep drop to the water. If the round dish of Lake Turnpike was the face of a clock, then town would be twelve, and the camp began at five.

A pier hung off into the lake, cobbled streets snaking from it, winding up the dip between mountains like an asscrack. Crappy storefronts and the barest necessities, half of which were sealed shut with cardboard boxes and boarded with wooden planks. Little roads and footpaths sprawled out, linking to various houses and motor homes – some passable, others less so.

 

‘So, when you go out at night, to check the shed and stuff, do you see Jesse?’ Jas enquired, looking up from her lukewarm coffee.

‘What?’ I asked, laughing. I swung one leg out before the next, arms outstretched a bit, balancing on the edge of the sidewalk.

‘He’s out *a lot*, walking the edge of the waters near camp, in the treeline.’ She stopped, looking into my dopey eyes with a playful spark. ‘In my three times here, he’s always done it. I just figured you might, like, see him. He’s so goddamn tall.’

I shrugged, scouring my brain for any interaction whatsoever with him over the last week, shapeless in the pile of other begrudging *hellos*.

‘He’s, like, seven-foot one,’ she elaborated. ‘He’s kind of big, too. He’s like a white *Yao Ming*.’

I spun on my heels, flapping for balance as I fell into the road. Never once breaking eye contact, trying not to laugh.

‘D’ya think he needs a special toothbrush?’ I asked in a giggle, eyebrows raised. ‘Like Shaq?’ She smiled, her eyes rolling as she cleared some room between us. ‘Maybe he’s just like the Phantom of Lake Turnpike, yeah? Anchor in tow, coming home to one of those two-foot novelty pencils.’

Without a moment’s silence, a sudden clink carried through the alley. We pivoted, drawing our eyes to the shade between buildings, cast by the trees and trapped by the buildings. Between two grafittied dumpsters slid life – an oily, fraying trenchcoat, threadbare and beaten, birthed from a canal between trash bags. A man propped himself up amidst a loose pile of bottles, sitting, prying his hungover eyes open.

‘You joke. You’re joking about that fucking ghost?’ he wheezed.

Jas’s face flared with alarm, and she leaned forward. ‘I-I’m sorry sir, we didn’t mean to offend you.’

‘*Let me*\-‘ he burped, continuing. ‘Let me tell you something, about that ghost.’ Adjusting the brim of his beanie, the noxious odour of bile and booze crept upon us, prompting a synchronised step back. ‘I see him all the time, down by the lake. I have a tent there.’

We shared concerned glances, whenever we could be certain his focus didn’t meet ours.

‘I go sleep, and I see him, his shadow, outside my tent. He walks on the water, he can’t drop the anchor, *or he’ll sink*.’ He slammed his pointed finger into his open palm several times, before parking his back against his den. ‘I’ve seen- I’ve seen the glow in his eyes. I’m a *learned* man, I know my history – the shit they don’t teach you kids in school.’ He wheezed out a spluttery cough, his face drooping. ‘I *know* the *glow*. Its secret.’

Jas stepped another foot forward. ‘Sir, are you *sure* you’re okay? We can get a-‘

‘Selfishness!’ He screamed, his eyes fluttering shut. ‘The t- the type… *only man does…*,’ his raspy voice quivering into a whisper, before turning to silence, his body limp. He let out a seismic snore, and then another, and another. *Thank Christ*, I thought, and Jas’s face said the same. I really didn’t want to have to witness a death today.

We slowly made it to the other side of the street, and began to walk back to camp in relative silence. She or I would cough; somebody would scratch their face. One of us would opine about how it looked like it might stay sunny for the week, or mutter about a bug we’d try to swat away. I slowly began piecing the man’s words together, in my head.

‘Dude,’ I smirked, turning to her, ‘Scuba Jesus.’

 

 ‘So are you coming?’ she asked. My attention was elsewhere.

‘What? Swimming in a bit?’ I asked, clearing the grit from my voice. ‘I don’t really want to go with all those people. But for you, I’ll watch.’

Jas smiled, and left for the shower.

I sat on my bed, legs crossed, arms pulling from under me, staring at the clock on the wall. Every second, a loud clack droned from its round face. I’d never noticed how loud it was, how it carried across the room until now. It echoed through my thoughtless head. A loud clack, not the clock. Jas’s hand wet shimmied the door ajar. ‘Did you use all the soap?’ she groaned, the shower pissing its weak stream behind her voice. ‘There isn’t any left, the liquid stuff.’

‘You mean the stuff the camp gives you?’ I asked, eyes back on the clock. ‘I used that once, it’s disgusting. Pretty sure that shit makes you infertile.’ She chuckled, and I grinned with satisfaction. ‘You’ll, like, grow gills. Become a Ninja Turtle. It’s *neon* green,’ I said, inching across the room to her bed. ‘Why are you washing *before* you go in the lake water? That makes no sense, dude.’

She closed the door, shouting something about shaving, and I stayed there, kneeling on the ground, torso splayed across her bed. The shed. The weapons, *Keep us safe*. Those words, that’s what tripped me out the most. The goats, the rope. The homeless man. Two scenarios rolled through my head. The first: this place is a cult, or several *someones* are cultists. Probably Amin, and Anna. Both *A* names, maybe it’s the prerequisite to join. The staff are at the very least in on it. The goats are a ritual sacrifice. Maybe people are the next step. The second option: someone, an individual, is practising killing, prepping to graduate to people like a classic psychopath. Since the shed had been padlocked, no extra violence had happened. The homeless man – he probably just saw Jesse? He walks around at night, is, like, seventy feet tall, and the man probably doesn’t always have the clearest grip on reality. If anyone is a killer, it’s likely to be Jesse.

But what’s his motive? This isn’t some spree killer, a tortured schoolkid manifesting his rage on his classmates. In these types of stories, the killer is always trying to get revenge, to right wrongs. Of course, real life isn’t a movie, a horror novel laden with tropes, but-

‘What are you saying?’ Jas asked, grinning in alarm, propped against the door. She fumbled her wet hands through her pockets. *Shit*. I was *saying* my internal monologue.

‘Oh, I just whisper my thoughts out loud every so often,’ I said with a smile, fighting the urge to shrivel up and wither and die.

‘Um, are you going to finish it?’ she stooped forward, softly, wringing her hair with the towel. I sighed, cringing.

‘But, the homeless man dumping nonsensical exposition is so cliché. It doesn’t even feel real.’ I looked up, shooting a pained grimace, satisfied. ‘I know none of this makes sense to you, it barely does to me, but *that* night was crazy.’ I stopped grimacing, waving jazz hands, ripping my best Elvis impression. ‘*Woah, you just had’da be there.’* It didn’t land.

 

Under the clear skies, torches became almost obsolete. We walked, Jas in her loose clothes, her towel, her swimsuit; me in my loose clothes, my underwear. As we crossed down the sloping bank, cabins in the distance, and a series of tiny torsos surfaced against the water. ‘I’ll, um, s-sit on the pier, offer moral support. I might go in a bit, I don’t know. It’s actually k-kind of cold.’ Jas spun around, in front of me, her bare legs knobbly under her baggy shorts. She grabbed my hand, dragging me with her.

‘Come on! Why can’t you swim with us? I told you about the seventh grade disco! I have *no* place to judge you.’

I sighed. Honesty *was* the best policy. ‘I can’t swim, I never learned. I fucking hate the water, I don’t like being wet, or naked,’ I rattled off. ‘I’d rather not do either of those with other people, who I don’t l-like as is.’ She stopped, let go of my hand and looked at me. My eyes locked with hers, glittery like the lake, and I looked away, ashamed. ‘I don’t really, um, like,’ I stuttered. ‘I thought about doing a lot of bad shit to my body. I didn’t, but it *never* won’t feel like I did. I just thought about it so hard that my body feels dirty.’ My wavering voice and downward head cowered before her. I didn’t need to look up to feel her sad, supportive smile, her guilt over feeling how fucking humiliating associating with me was. She touched my arm, and I recoiled, laughing. ‘Plus, I really do hate being around other people. *Um*, you’re okay though. ’

 

The pier was cold and greasy, from slicked bodies trawling up to check their phones, or reach over to the ashtray for a joint or cigarette. I sat there, by the ladder, my Converse toes skimming the jumping ripples. I picked up the guitar, too nice to leave on this sodden surface, and pushed myself further onto the wood, beginning to strum. Connor swam in huge confident strokes, splashing the group of bodies in his wake. Dave Tsosie, his girlfriend Daisy, Kenan Thompson, Jas, and Bruce.

‘Aren’t you gonna join us?’ Connor called, wading out further from the group.

‘I-I’m good thanks,’ I said, trying to conceal my blushing. As Connor submerged, my gravelly voice strained a bit as I tried to project. ‘You enjoy a-all those amoebas and shit!’

He burst from the water, his wet body rippling with lean muscle, spitting a long fountain of water balled from his mouth. ‘Refreshing!’ His voice carried across the water, breaking the further he got.

Bruce scattered himself across the surface, his deep, dopey voice straining for air. ‘Jesus Christ, don’t be a fucking pussy!’ I cringed a bit, putting the guitar down, and emphatically smoking a joint from the ashtray. ‘How will you get across to the island when you need to,’ he sneered. I smiled, pointing to the… pontoon-palate thingy, roped up to a post behind me. I turned around, scanning for the oar among the tangle of canoes and motorboats.

‘Man, you’ve gotta chill out.’ Kenan, maybe the smallest guy in the staff, spoke the first words I’d heard leave his mouth, hushed and calm. ‘I wouldn’t even want to go swimming with *your* ass.’

‘I-I just can’t swim, really that’s it...’ I pleaded, stressing my hands down onto my legs, eyes watching my fingers grope the denim into bundles.

‘Doesn’t mean you’ve got to be such a stuck up bitch about it,’ I heard Bruce mutter, as he drifted away.

‘Yo!’ Daisy yelled shrilly. ‘It’s Jesse,’ she screamed with her whole body, throwing herself up and down in the water. ‘Hey Jesse!’ On the shore, some distance away, a silhouette skulked between pillars of trunk, walking fast and heavy. A *giant* silhouette, as unsure as perspective can be from a distance - bulky, broad, and not in the slightest bit interested in us. My mind was racing.

I didn’t even notice Jas, like she was psychic, clambering her wet bare body up the ladder to reach for a joint. ‘Hey,’ she said, squeezing my knee, locking eyes. ‘Eyes on me, ‘kay?’

She inhaled several breaths of weed smoke, and then threw herself back to the water, swimming out. ‘Stand up.’ My shoes skidded for stability on the cladding. ‘Okay, good,’ she assured through a grin. ‘When I go underwater, you’re gonna hold your breath. When I come back out, you breathe. Yeah?’ She ducked herself under the water, the shadow of her spaced body dark like a manatee’s. I breathed in. Her thin body sliced through the water, and I let go. ‘Once more, this time you lean forward, like this. Got it?’

And we continued. Arms, not *grabbing* the water, but *slicing*. Legs, not *kicking* the water, but *pushing*. Making yourself as narrow and wide as you could. We stayed there, as the others talked and swam - laughing, staring through each other.

 

‘Hey,’ Jas mumbled with a voice sweet as honey, smacking my dangling foot. Resting her chin on a bar of the ladder, her giant eyes craned up. ‘You feeling any better?’ I nodded. ‘Good,’ she grinned, throwing herself off of it. As she began to swam, she stopped. A scream.

‘*What the* *fuck*!’ Kenan shouted, throwing himself up into the air. ‘Someone just grabbed my leg!’ After a beat of confusion, of muttering amongst each other, of anticipation for the punchline, the screaming started again, before the warm, wet lurching of vomit. I lunged for the torch, aiming it like a gun at him, and as the beam hit, a collective silence hit. Kenan, dribbling his own puke, was centre in a large mass of deep, dark red, carrying from the depths of the lake, sticking all over him. He leaned down, as if to hoist something up, rising even bloodier than before. An oily, ravaged black trenchcoat, shredded by grasping hands desperate for grip. He threw his hand away, ripping from an open cavity, and spilling chunks of gloopy viscera out like a dog food can. The rank smell of putrefaction crawled across the lake. Death, despair, abandon. Where there should have been a beanie and drunken face, where was none - just a torn, broken, stretched stump. ‘*Jesus* *Christ*,’ I said.

1loygsm,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyWitch/comments/1loygsm/a_little_feral_guide_into_july_2025_astrology/,A Little Feral Guide into July 2025 Astrology,"Aaaand exhale! We made it through June and wouldn't you know it, the 2025 astrology dumpster just caught fire. I have just finished a full breakdown of July 2025 astrology, transit by transit with guidance for every zodiac sign over at my blog (this is not an advertisement, but if you want a longer read with your morning coffee, you'll find a link to it in my BIO) and I honestly need to book vacation on a different planet to recover.

July is the weird, twitchy afterparty where the power goes out, forcing us to talk by candlelight (**hello, 3 retrogrades**), and then a punk band kicks down the door and rewires the house (**welcome, Uranus in Gemini**).

It's about learning when to fight the bastards with everything you have, and when to retreat into the misfit sanctuaries we have to build for ourselves to survive. **It’s messy, contradictory, and the perfect astrology for right now.**

For each sign, here’s the inside intel on how the cosmos is about to assault you this July, and more importantly, your best Krav Maga counter-move to not just survive the pandemonium, but use its chaotic energy to your advantage.

**♈ Aries:** Your brain gets a revolutionary upgrade while your identity is under review. A shocking new idea changes everything, but an old creative project or flame comes back to haunt you. **Your counter-move:** Use your brilliant new words to define who you are *now*, not who you were.

**♉ Taurus:** Your sense of security and your bank account are getting a jolt from Uranus. A surprising financial opportunity might appear just as you're having a deep reckoning with your family history. **Your counter-move:** Question every ""value"" you inherited. Build your own definition of wealth.

**♊ Gemini:** A total identity glitch as Uranus plugs directly into your sign. You're the revolution now. But Mercury Retrograde will have you rethinking your friendships and communication style. **Your counter-move:** Surprise yourself. Do one thing the ""old you"" would never do. Your new identity is an experiment in progress.

**♋ Cancer:** The cosmos is pulling you into a spiritual retreat while your career demands a reality check. Prophetic dreams and secrets are being revealed just as you rethink your entire professional path. **Your counter-move:** Trust your gut instincts over your job title. Your inner world holds the map to your future success.

**♌ Leo:** Your social life gets weird and brilliant with a new tribe of misfits, while you're being forced to re-evaluate your own ego during a Mercury Retrograde in your sign. **Your counter-move:** Ditch the need for applause. Find the people who love you when you're not performing.

**♍ Virgo:** Your career path is being detonated by Uranus, forcing you toward a more authentic, if unpredictable, future. Meanwhile, an old flame or relationship issue comes back for a final showdown. **Your counter-move:** Write a resignation letter to the life you thought you were supposed to have. You don't have to send it. Just know you can.

**♎ Libra:** You're getting a cosmic promotion at work while your entire belief system gets a shocking rewrite from Uranus. You're trying to lead while questioning everything you thought was true. **Your counter-move:** Lead with the questions, not the answers. Your willingness to not know is your greatest strength right now.

**♏ Scorpio:** You’re hungry for freedom—new travels, new ideas. But this requires a revolution in your most intimate relationships. Your ability to trust and be vulnerable is being deconstructed. **Your counter-move:** Expand your mind, but be brutally honest about your heart. True freedom requires radical vulnerability.

**♐ Sagittarius:** Your relationships are now a radical science experiment thanks to Uranus. Expect sudden attractions and a need for more freedom. This will force a deep dive into your own psyche and fears around intimacy. **Your counter-move:** Treat your partnerships like a laboratory. What happens if you prioritize authenticity over security?

**♑ Capricorn:** The universe blesses you with partnership opportunities while simultaneously blowing up your daily routine. You're learning to lean on someone else just as you can no longer control your own schedule. **Your counter-move:** Let someone help you. Your strength isn't in doing it all yourself; it's in building a solid team.

**♒ Aquarius:** Your love life and creative drive are becoming a beautiful, chaotic riot. To survive the glorious madness, you must find sacredness in your daily work and wellness routines. **Your counter-move:** Treat your day job like a temple. A solid routine is the only launchpad for a truly revolutionary romance.

**♓ Pisces:** You're getting a cosmic hall pass for epic romance and creativity. But this explosion of joy requires you to detonate your very foundations. To be this happy, you have to leave ""home"" as you know it. **Your counter-move:** Say yes to what feels good, even if it scares you. Your heart knows the way, even if it means burning down the past.

A Brief Content Warning: >! This story contains graphic depictions of violence, and references SA, homophobia and general mental health theme with varying detail. !< 


Every few days, my phone will buzz to life with a notification from my family. A Washington Post article about trends in spree killers; their class, their maleness, their whiteness, their social alienation. A dog-eared local newsprint, wrought with coffee-rings and misspellings in the headline. A YouTube video, a text-to-speech recount of the ten most gruesome mass casualty events in state history. For all their differences, they’ll invariably share a sole, single similarity – *Turnpike, Idaho*.

A nothing name for a nowhere place, that somehow holds so much weight. Maybe pattern finding was a mistake, a deficit so snuggly tucked in the lizard brain we never thought to lose it. When I shut my eyes, I hear screams. On the precipice of sleep, I feel the greasy rain beat down on my bloody, broken face. As I outstretch my trembling hands, I can feel her phantom limbs touch mine, her warm hand squeezing my cold hand. The most unexpected things come from the most unlikely places.

 

The wintry Lake Turnpike was a beautiful sight, etched deep into the basin between two rising mountains, both once cloaked in greenery and now dressed in blankets of frost. If you had felt so inclined, you could probably walk to the small island in the middle with ease, across the shimmering, packed ice. I first encountered Turnpike as an early teen, out with a group of neighbours. The eldest had just gotten her driver’s license, and we took a remedial, post-exam escape that I was strong-armed into by my parents. We hopped fences, and the others talked, and laughed. We pulled our way through the forest paths with torches, and then sat on the shore of the local summer camp and talked some more. Cabins sat behind us, draped in cloying scraps of watery snow. We smoked and drank a little, just because it felt like you should in this situation. Dense clouds rippled in the air like unspooling wool, and behind them a billion stars burst across the sky. Those clouds drifted and danced from rich, mossy greens to the deepest purple, the type of colours you only get from arctic auroras, and instead they sat above *us*, above the desolate lake. It was sad to leave, but more to the point, it *was* a beautiful place, and a peaceful one.

The legend didn’t matter – we knew it of course, but being from out of town it meant nothing. It was a diver, the story says, who drowned at the lake, his body entombed in glass and brass and leather and resin, just drifting into the amorphous black. There was a single spot on the lake, a glow, emanating from the depths too deep to swim, unlike any colour the townsfolk had ever seen. They would gang up along the shoreline each night and watch it and weep, out of fear, out of awe for its incomprehensible beauty. They couldn’t trace its origin, either, it just appeared; maybe from a midnight comet, maybe from dynamiting around the coast. And it never went away until the diver set loose from the boat, and the townsfolk watched in baited breath, as he thrashed and screamed and cried and sunk, and the boat splintered into a million shards, and the colour blinkered and hissed away, and was never seen again. That is, until you’d have to hide from the diver, pacing across the surface of the lake and trawling the treeline looking for signs of the townsfolk. His ruined porthole flickering hues too alien to exist, like a flame flickers under the wheeze of dying breath.

But in reality, life just returned to normal for the people of Turnpike. Turnpike town, as it was now, was small, and dirt poor – like how you’d imagine those parts of South Dakota where folks die a decade earlier than the rest of America. Back then, one can only imagine it as worse. At risk of sounding insensitive, it was a *real* shitty place. Idaho Falls may as well have been a whole different country.

I mention all of this because I want to distinguish the *then* from the *now*, or rather *next*. Camp Turnpike was genuinely serene. I placed no stock in the ghost story. I didn’t *then*, anyway. Not just because ghosts aren’t real, but because it was so *derivative*, cooked up from a generation of skeevy uncles raised on cheapo slashers from the video-store era.  I didn’t subscribe to any of it.

 

A ghost diver at a summer camp may have scared the parents of my generation in the ‘80s, but it sure as shit wasn’t going to stir *my* soul. Literally, that’s a Scooby Doo villain. In horror movies, or the ones that matter, anyway, these types of things just don’t happen to modern people. As the bus rolled into Turnpike, I shuffled my playlist, and palmed my phone, taking relief in the security it gave me. I felt its pressure, its weight, and I fingered the shards of screen protector like a nervous tic. There are worse things to worry about than monsters.

As the whirring engine groaned into silence, and the flimsy doors dinged themselves open, I barrelled down the aisles, a bag in each hand. I turned to thank the bus driver, and as I shifted my gaze, he sat there, his eyes intense, face pallid. ‘You go on n’ be safe out there, Little Miss,’ he grumbled, leaning into the acrylic shield. ‘You know, *what wit’ the stories* ‘n all…’

I doubled around, as if to confirm me actually being in this situation – I was the only one leaving at this stop. ‘T-thanks for the concern,’ I whimpered out, before throwing myself down the stairs and onto the asphalt. As the bus pulled away, I began to walk away. Golden light poured through the red cedars hugging the narrow road. Invisible bugs and wood dust became material through the light, so dense in the summer heat you could touch the beams. I walked until I couldn’t and dropped my bags, wringing the red pads of my fingers. I checked the time – I was halfway through missing my counsellor’s orientation.

Not that I minded, and the sooner I could get started, the sooner I could go, and the more people I could avoid the better. I just stood there, airing my open fingers against the breeze and watching the time on my phone tick forward. *What the fuck was that bus driver talking about?* The Turnpike Diver? *No, that was just fresh on my mind.* He had to have assumed I was going to the town, and a rougher area like that couldn’t have been safe for a girl on her own. *Right?* I shifted the shards on my screen together, as if I were solving the puzzle. *Shit*. It was already 3 o’clock.

 

In daylight, Lake Turnpike looked different. It looked larger, as the afternoon sun beat between the hills, shadow ripping across the glittering reflections. Cascading tree shag steeped around the mountainous bowl, a giant tapestry of rich rustic browns and phthalo green, shimmering and waving off the water in the heat. Turnpike wore summer well.

Looming trunks shadowed across the roofs of the cabins, now much more of them than my last visit. Totem poles dotted the trodden footpaths, spiralling around the labyrinthine grounds.

A voice shot across the yard. ‘Hey, you can come in now!’

I hurried the way I had just wandered from to the administration centre.

‘Hiya Emmy, how’d you find getting here?’ the lady cooed. She rifled through my paperwork, and I recognised her voice from the phone… *Amanda*? Something with an ‘A’. She was short, though taller than me, and around my mother’s age.

‘Um, okay. Thanks for asking,’ I choked out, clearing my gravelly throat.

‘No worries,’ she said with a smile. She leaned forward, shifting her weight across the wooden reception desk. ‘People arrive all throughout orientation so, compared to a few others, you’re really not that late.’ She let out a chuckle. ‘From our conversations on the phone, I trust that you’ve got the briefing package?’

I gestured my head towards the bag in my hand and raised it, forcing a grin. ‘I’m f-fully prepared, thanks.’

‘Okay, okay,’ she shot back, raising her hands in mock-defence. ‘The other counsellors are meeting in the community centre tonight, to complete orientation. 8:00pm... You really shouldn’t miss that one.’ She drew circles against the lacquered wood with her flat hands. Watching whatever she was doing was so much easier than her eyes. I’ve always remembered to make the little glances, show *active listening*, shit like that. But it’s mostly a painful courtesy on my end. I traced up her body, and we locked eyes. ‘You’re in cabin B2, the last one on your map. You’re bunking with Jasmine Krantz.’ She slid a plastic wallet across the desk – a lanyard, key, a whistle, and some other assorted goods. As I went to take it, she placed her hand on mine, and squeezed softly. ‘You’re gonna be awesome,’ she said. ‘If you need anything at all, just ask for Anna. I’ll get you sorted, ‘kay?’

I nodded, and smiled back, thanked her, and took my wallet and left. I combed through my bag, and found the map. B2 was on the furthest stretch from the lake, and the longest walk from everyone, and everything. The further into the woods I walked, map clutched like a child seeking some imagined treasure, the more I began to doubt myself. *Are you fucking kidding me, Anna? Where did I get Amanda from? How are you going to survive this if you can’t even get a four letter name right?*

 

B2. It sat on the edge of the dirt path, alone, and this deep in the woods, not much light filtered through the mosaic of canopies. I fumbled for my key, climbed the porch, and sunk it into the lock. The inside was nice, albeit… *sparse?* In aesthetic terms, I believed the label was ‘*hygge’*. Two worn single beds, two wooden dressers, some shelves, a *shared* closet, and a door to the bathroom, either painted piss-yellow or stained by some rogue cigarette. It looked nicer in the booklet, and it looked nicer on the outside, and there it looked the worst of the cabins I’d passed. *Wow, I really lucked out*. I slung my shit down on a bed, and made my way over to the incandescent light left buzzing in the bathroom.

A shrill scream bounced across the tiled chamber. It echoed across the cabin, and out the windows, and probably to Turnpike town. A girl my age, ripping her earphones from her head. ‘What the *hell*?’ she cried.

‘I-I-I-uh,’ I instantly darted from the room and slid against the wall. Jesus, I could barely speak. ‘*You left the door open?*’

‘I thought I was the only one here!’ her high voice squealed, and I croaked out an agreement. ‘Wait a sec, I’m almost done.’ She flushed the toilet, and I threw myself to my bed, clenching onto my jeans to funnel my embarrassment. ‘I’m so sorry, I totally didn’t think you were going to show up. I’m Jas, you must be Emmy.’

*‘I’mgenuinelysofuckingsorryhonesttogod,*’ I sputtered out breathlessly, cringing at her nervous laughter and retreating my head to my hands.

‘Don’t worry about it, it’s really fine.’

‘I-I’m Emmy, yeah.’ I said.

She parked herself on the opposite bed. Simply moving in the cabin kicked up layers of dust and wood particulate. To walk from one side of the room to the other, you were cutting through a foul smelling miasma, tinted sickly yellow thanks to the lone ceiling bulb. No wonder the windows were open. We just sort of sat there for an awkward moment or five, assessing each other, and then carrying on with our lives, breaking the ice with menial small talk.

‘I love your hair,’ she said, gesturing up from her phone to me. I looked up from my unpacked bag, flickering occasional eye contact.

‘Thanks, I cut it myself,’ I said, instantly regretting the conversational prompt.

‘Really? It’s so cute,’ she beamed. This was a complete lie and objectively false. I grabbed a handful of it, dark and disorderly and short and voluminous. It looked like I had been dragged through the forest to get here.

‘Yeah, I, um, I don’t like going to the barber, I kind of get nervous about it.’ She stopped for a second, looking at me. Her stormy blue eyes were placid and kind, and something about that dichotomy made me feel dirty for even looking at them. I continued. ‘I’m just not good with being boxed in, having to talk to someone for what feels like hours - no control over it. It used to be long, but sometimes, you wanna do something low-key transformative, but in no way permanent, y’know? Like a Britney moment. So it’s also just a recent habit, I guess.’

She straightened up, putting her phone away. ‘Hey, well, you don’t have to worry about that nervousness stuff with me,’ she said. ‘You going to the thing tonight?’ she asked, kicking her feet out against the length of her dusty duvet.

‘I got here so late – I really ought to,’ I said, sliding my bags under the bed.

‘Well, you’ve got, like, three hours,’ Jas observed, outstretching her slender arm like her phone clock may grant some new truth from the distance.

And so we talked. About the little things; our laughs slipped through the cladding and bounced through the trees. Music, movies, Idaho Falls, Pocatello - the things you can’t really alienate a person with because it’s all agreeably subjective or objectively true. I mostly listened, nodding. I watched my tawny hands, casting shifting shadows like tv static against my chest. I could live with this.

 

The community centre, receding into the start of the treeline, sat discreetly in the evening shade. The signposting wasn’t especially great, it looked just like any other of the larger cabins. *My map may have to become a fixture*, I considered. The interior was spacious, with sofas, a pool table, a television, and shelves displaying all manner of camp info and paraphernalia. People clumped in their groups, and Anna led the charge to inaugurate the masses, *welcoming us to the family*, delivering a slideshow presentation and rattling off safety protocols, introducing us by name. The dozens of faces craning to mine, tucked away at the back of the room, made me taste vomit. *The last one to leave locks the cabin, the keys go in the lockbox your universal key will open*. *Hey everyone, grab a bite to eat before you go. Hey everyone, meet your superiors, Dylan and Grace. Hey everybody, this is my freakishly tall son Jesse*.

I crossed behind the swathes of people talking amongst themselves, pressing into the glass units. Medals, framed certificates, mounted cardstock detailing the camp’s history. Itemised lists of activities and amenities through the years. Land acknowledgements twinkled in the reflections of the string lights. Shimmying past the mismatched sofa, I reached the final cabinet.

On the wall to the left, a printed photo on a laminate information board. The film was coarse, crude; in sepia tone, the waters of Lake Turnpike were rendered glittery and choppy. The view, obscured by a tree, showed the shoreline, as a silhouetted diver stood looking outwards, clutching an anchor. *On these grounds, 1967*, the text read beneath. *Cute*. In the cabinet sat several items – a splinter of rotted wood from the supposed boat, a rusted harpoon, outstretched on the lowest shelf, and most curiously, a diary, propped open on plastic legs. I strained my eyes into a squint, and pressed my face into the case, but couldn’t make out anything – I really needed to start wearing my glasses out.

‘It says he was looking for Indian gold, in the glowing spot.’ I peered up to meet the reflection of a tall boy, scooting up and crouching a bit, putting us shoulder-to-shoulder. ‘It’s his wife’s diary, the diver.’ His voice was low and smooth.

‘Oh, um, thanks.’ I gradually eased my way away from his shoulder, focus trained on his reflection.

‘Yeah, he thought it came dislodged when they were excavating the shore earlier. It’s a pretty interesting read. She told him not to go, and he beat her with it, the diary.’ He tousled a hand through his wavy crop of blonde hair.

‘I-It’s the light, picking up in the glass. A l-little difficult to see through,’ I mumbled through nervous laughter. ‘I’m Emmy,’ I said, coughing my throat clear and hyperextending a sweaty hand.

‘Connor,’ he announced, smacking it into a high-five with a satisfied smile. He leaned, and crossed his arms, both skinny yet strong. ‘This your first time counselling here?’

I swallowed harder, so hard the whole room could’ve heard if hadn’t all migrated out. ‘M-hm. Yes-sir. Yes it is,’ I grinned, tossing my arms to my side to showcase my playful tone. He squinted through his confusion.

‘Well, don’t let any of this shit get to you.’ Gesturing his head to the glass, he spoke softly. ‘I’m sure you’re smart enough that you don’t need me to tell you.’ I nodded meekly, my eyes boring holes into his shoes. A deep, dopey voice called his name from the doorway, and he pivoted around and began to walk off to his gaggle of friends. He turned, and tossed that nonchalant nod guys do, his golden-retriever face screwing into a large smile. ‘See ya ‘round, Emmy.’

As I watched him leave, the million halos of light around me faded to their death, and I stood alone in the quiet room, so much bigger than it had seemed before. I clambered past the sofa, to the coffee table, to grab the large wheel of keys, and stopped, my hand suspended through the dark, still air. I sighed, my fingers melting into the keys. *Fuck*.

 

Jas and I talked for a while, but it wasn’t enough to turn my brain off.

I spun over and over, kicking my legs through the ashy duvet for anything to grab onto. I watched Jas sleep, facing away from me as if to protect herself. Moonsilver slithered through the shutters, casting the curves and creases of her boxy body like a marble sculpture. Her pale skin looked even paler than before.

Even with the windows shut, my pillow pinned across my head, my earplugs in, the chorus of crickets *molested* my ears. Cool wind lashed through the greenery, snagging and howling against *every* upturned root and *all* the flimsy foliage. A trillion thoughts pounded through my atrophying brain, rotting from its overwork and marinating in sweat. I wasn’t gonna take it.

I clothed myself, haphazard yet quiet enough to not disturb my roommate, grabbed my keys; torch, phone, pocket knife, and unfurled my map, and left. It took me an embarrassing length to find my way here both times, and I needed to distract myself with busywork, so I might as well learn it, I thought. The packed dirt crunched beneath my weight, vagabond hairs carrying gently across my face. Inside was noisy, outside was, honestly, kind of quiet.

*Too* quiet. This wouldn’t help as much as I wanted it to.

I traced my cabin on the map, right at the outskirts, and set off. The cone of torchlight would only cover so much, so most of the time, I’d stop, stare and something, consult the map, think, and walk. I recognised these trees, I recognised that cabin next to mine. The childlike sense of pride you get for pressing the right-shaped block in the right-shaped hole washed over me. Those pattern finding thoughts didn’t stop there. I could tell this wasn’t really allowed. Not that I was ever a stickler for rules, but something about it felt genuinely risky. If there *was* a curfew, I reasoned, then I must’ve missed that part. My brain kept reverting to the photo. Seeing the diver there, posed like a doofy Bigfoot in some hoax postcard image. In the dark, in the woods, it didn’t seem so novel. A counsellor, alone, trudging through the night-time woods at sleepaway camp? Life wasn’t the movies, but if I was *ever* going to die? Now would be the time.

Of course, if I were in one, I’d never make it to the end, I assessed. I’m not selfless or pretty enough. *Maybe if I just keep my legs shut whilst I’m here*, I chuckled. *The virgin never dies*.


It wasn’t long before I clocked the tinge of orange glow through the woods, past a row of cabins – a light that wasn’t my torch. It wasn’t anything on my map either. I stood still, knowing I shouldn’t. But I did, trawling through the beaten pathways of forest floor, pushing through nettles and brambles and trembling ferns.

From here, the cabins looked so small, cowering away and outside the ring of vast trunks. From here, the shed looked so close. Nails and rivets jagged out like weapons, and warm light pooled through an exposed chunk at its flank. Up at the door, I threw out my tip toes, and clutched to the rim of the glass pane. Greasy, dusty, crusted with all manner of finger prints and miscellaneous shit. I leaned closer, eyeing through the filth. A single tungsten bulb hung on cord from the ceiling. Crates of something, boxes of something. A shotgun. *Another shotgun*. Machetes. Two hunting rifles, ammo, a crowbar, a chainsaw, an axe or three, a fucking *speargun?* Rusted, antique-looking chains draped the walls on hooks, and reels of yellow rope unspooled across the floor in heaps. *KEEP US SAFE*, crudely lettered on the wall in yellow. ‘What the *fuck…’* I mumbled, taken aback, shrinking from the window. As I turned, I noticed it – a frail hand snaking around my shoulder.

I screamed *loudly*, throwing myself back and reaching for my knife. A man clambered out of the impregnable darkness, in custodian coveralls, as alarmed as I was. He stepped back. ‘*Woah*,’ he gasped. Tall and old, his sullen face and tan skin bathed in dark. He combed his long dirty nails through what remained of his hair. ‘You shouldn’t be here,’ he said in a thick accent. Middle-eastern?

‘I-uh-um-I-I…,’ I panted, words failing me, my eyes dancing everywhere but his. ‘Sorry.’

‘I’m Amin,’ the man said.

‘You need to be careful out here.’ Waving his arm, he lifted his other to his head with a deal of effort, holding a tangle of rope and rusted, toothy metal. ‘*Bear traps*’, he enunciated, grinning rows of piano-key teeth.

‘Right, uh-huh, got it. I’m so sorry to bother you. I’ll head back,’ I sighed, treading down the path.

 

Bear traps? The more I walked, the more I thought, and that seemed implausibly unsafe. I scanned cabin after cabin, tracing my journey on the map. The shed felt like something from a bad dream - *Keep us safe*? My gaze wound across my torch-lit map, my mind conjuring ten-year-old after ten-year-old mangled in a spider’s web of steel jaws. All I could hope was that the nurse gives out tetanus shots.

The dirt path became gravel, as I pulled myself through the trees. Stars so burned bright and abundant in the sky that I barely needed my torch. I cut across the patchwork of cabins, the sprawl of paths, the tangle of totems, and parked myself on a grassy bank, looking up. Even if a ghost diver doesn’t eviscerate me with an anchor, even if some psycho custodian in a hockey mask doesn’t carve me to shreds, this place could be the death of me, under these stars, and it wouldn’t even matter. The bare minimum is *so* hard, and here I am, abusing these people’s charity, their goodwill, their compassion and kindness wasted on me. ‘It’s so fucking *selfish*,’ I said aloud, fighting tears.

As soon as the words left my mouth, I bolted up, scanning the environment. I felt so much shame just verbalising that pathetic truth that I could have sworn *someone* was watching. A stupid thought from a stupid person, but it felt so real. I turned in circles. Nothing. I began with the map, pacing down through the buildings. Gate. Path. Parking lot. More path. Admin building. Cabins, A1-10. Community centre. Indoor activity centre. One foot after another, pools overflowing and streams running down my face. I felt my way through the dark. The waters of the lake skimmed wind *through* me, the stars dancing across the chopping surface. The island sat in the distance, and behind it, across the lake, through the woods, the small, twinkling lights of Turnpike, as if someone had strung up those string lights between the mountains. I looked down at the map.

‘Cabin, totem pole, boats,’ I said to no one, looking back up. ‘Cabin, totem pole, boats,’ I repeated. ‘Cabin, totem pole, boats, *goat*.’

 

It stood sentinel before me. I squinted, cocking my head and letting the breeze carry my hair. I let out a groan of confusion, and it stomped its hoof back, almost knowingly, silencing me. I flashed my torch, its eyes shining in a green halo of astigmatism, before it walked away. I followed it, trailing a long tether of the same yellow rope as the utility shed. My feet turned through gnarls of grass and soft sand, until foamy water rode across my shoes. As the goat stopped walking and started watching, I looked below my feet. A caved path of maroon wet sand. I clasped my free hand over my nose, eyes either crying or watering – what’s the difference? Spools of rotten, fly-ridden intestine stretched past me, bobbing whenever the water rode in.

A matting of fur and yellow rope, another goat – or, rather, it used to be. Its head sat limp, its scared eyes matte, its grey wool drenched and soaked in clumpy, coagulating blood. Legs hung together by sinews of purple flesh, snapped and bent apart, and the chest lay… hollow. Like giant fingers had raked through its gut, puncturing one side to the other, scooping all it could take and leaving arches of broken ribs, airing against the breeze like a mangled cathedral.

I stared at my companion, running off into the trees without so much a second look, and I turned to the water, pink and licking my shoes. I sort of stood there, scared to run, feeling those same eyes as before, from everywhere and nowhere.

*It didn’t feel so irrational now*.

1loyew2,https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsFuckWithAstrology/comments/1loyew2/my_little_feral_astrology_guide_to_july_2025/,My Little Feral Astrology Guide to July 2025,"Aaaand exhale! We made it through June and wouldn't you know it, the 2025 astrology dumpster just caught fire. I have just finished a full breakdown of July 2025 astrology, transit by transit with guidance for every zodiac sign over at my blog (this is not an advertisement, but if you want a longer read with your morning coffee, you'll find a link to it in my BIO) and I honestly need to book vacation on a different planet to recover.

July is the weird, twitchy afterparty where the power goes out, forcing us to talk by candlelight (**hello, 3 retrogrades**), and then a punk band kicks down the door and rewires the house (**welcome, Uranus in Gemini**).

It's about learning when to fight the bastards with everything you have, and when to retreat into the misfit sanctuaries we have to build for ourselves to survive. **It’s messy, contradictory, and the perfect astrology for right now.**

For each sign, here’s the inside intel on how the cosmos is about to assault you this July, and more importantly, your best Krav Maga counter-move to not just survive the pandemonium, but use its chaotic energy to your advantage.



**♈ Aries:** Your brain gets a revolutionary upgrade while your identity is under review. A shocking new idea changes everything, but an old creative project or flame comes back to haunt you. **Your counter-move:** Use your brilliant new words to define who you are *now*, not who you were.

**♉ Taurus:** Your sense of security and your bank account are getting a jolt from Uranus. A surprising financial opportunity might appear just as you're having a deep reckoning with your family history. **Your counter-move:** Question every ""value"" you inherited. Build your own definition of wealth.

**♊ Gemini:** A total identity glitch as Uranus plugs directly into your sign. You're the revolution now. But Mercury Retrograde will have you rethinking your friendships and communication style. **Your counter-move:** Surprise yourself. Do one thing the ""old you"" would never do. Your new identity is an experiment in progress.

**♋ Cancer:** The cosmos is pulling you into a spiritual retreat while your career demands a reality check. Prophetic dreams and secrets are being revealed just as you rethink your entire professional path. **Your counter-move:** Trust your gut instincts over your job title. Your inner world holds the map to your future success.

**♌ Leo:** Your social life gets weird and brilliant with a new tribe of misfits, while you're being forced to re-evaluate your own ego during a Mercury Retrograde in your sign. **Your counter-move:** Ditch the need for applause. Find the people who love you when you're not performing.

**♍ Virgo:** Your career path is being detonated by Uranus, forcing you toward a more authentic, if unpredictable, future. Meanwhile, an old flame or relationship issue comes back for a final showdown. **Your counter-move:** Write a resignation letter to the life you thought you were supposed to have. You don't have to send it. Just know you can.

**♎ Libra:** You're getting a cosmic promotion at work while your entire belief system gets a shocking rewrite from Uranus. You're trying to lead while questioning everything you thought was true. **Your counter-move:** Lead with the questions, not the answers. Your willingness to not know is your greatest strength right now.

**♏ Scorpio:** You’re hungry for freedom—new travels, new ideas. But this requires a revolution in your most intimate relationships. Your ability to trust and be vulnerable is being deconstructed. **Your counter-move:** Expand your mind, but be brutally honest about your heart. True freedom requires radical vulnerability.

**♐ Sagittarius:** Your relationships are now a radical science experiment thanks to Uranus. Expect sudden attractions and a need for more freedom. This will force a deep dive into your own psyche and fears around intimacy. **Your counter-move:** Treat your partnerships like a laboratory. What happens if you prioritize authenticity over security?

I am a coffee entrepreneur based in Amsterdam who is relocating to Spain at the end of August. Given the vibrant coffee scenes in Barcelona and other cities, I thought it would be relatively easy to relocate my monthly coffee subscription to Spain but turns out it's far from easy.

Not only have I encountered a lot of red tape with regards to handling and shipping coffee products, I am also unable to find a suitable shipping partner who can take over from my current partnership with the Dutch post.

While I have found a great warehouse space in my friends roastery in Barcelona, I am currently doubting if I can continue running my business from Spain as planned without any major noticeable changes for my customers.

SEUR, for example, sent me an offer but they do not offer shipping to non-EU countries, not even the UK. About 35% of my business is non-EU.

Other companies like Fedex are good but I use them only for large bulk shipments and for orders where the customer paid extra for faster shipping but I cannot simply handover all non-EU shipments to Fedex and swallow the price difference, let alone ask the customer to pay 100% more for shipping than now.

So I'm in a conundrum. I want to relocate my business to Spain but I am very doubtful I will be able to. Most likely right now, I will need to leave operations in Amsterdam and simply commute once a month to take care of shipments. This is really not an ideal option but the risk of things going awry is too great.

Does anyone else have a food/coffee e-commerce business in Spain with experience of shipping their products to customers around the world? What would be a good way to move forward from here?",1,1751366447.0,GoingToSpain,1,1.0,False

I found a malfunctioning Delonghi Magnifica S on the street and I had this idea of taking out the grinder and creating myself a standalone coffee grinder. I'm a mechanical engineer with a bit of experience in DIY but this is a bit more risky.

When I disassembled the grinder I saw that it has a motor (Johnson U-5421 230V 50Hz), I think brushed AC (since it only has two cables). From my understanding Since its rated 230V I can plug it straight into the socket (the socket voltage here is 220).

When I looked at the motherboard I saw that one cable is indeed connected to the socket line and the other cable is connected to a FET, I believe it is for controlling speed and toggling it.

Am I getting something wrong? Of course that I'll use a switch for convenience and maybe even a resistor for speed control.

1loybqo,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1loybqo/5_trips_in_india_by_a_solo_female/,5 trips in India by a solo female,"Hi,

I (37F) wanted to share my experiences from 5 solo trips in India as a female traveler. I hope some of these details are useful to others.

**Cola, Goa (March 2017)** \- This was a my first solo trip. I had been to Goa a couple of times since Dec 2008. There's something in Goa that I fell in love with during my 2008 Dec trip. So when I decided to travel solo, Goa was the first place that came to my mind. I stayed at Dwarka Beach Resort. At that time, there weren't many solo reviews but I knew the resort was running since more than a decade. So somehow I felt I could stay there even though it was in a remote place with no internet or cell phone reception and yes, access was also a bit difficult. The owner and staff turned out to be friendly and polite. The location and the stay were great. The beach and lagoon were stunning. Everyday I saw sun set into the sea and moon rise from the mountains behind. One night at around 3am-ish when I woke up, I could see beautiful full moon and its silver reflections on the sea from my balcony. I can never forget the peace and serenity I experienced during that moment.

**Pondicherry (Dec 1st week 2020)** \- COVID lockdowns had really drained me. I just wanted to be out and breathe. I had to travel to Chennai so I included a quick 4-day solo trip to Pondicherry. I stayed at Villa Shanti. Cyclone Burevi crossed the Pondicherry coast during my visit. The Promenade was closed for a day. After the cyclone crossed the coast, the promenade was opened for public and the sea was truly beautiful. The sea had 4 shades of blue with a grey patch. I vividly remember those visuals. The Promenade was peaceful and serene. I availed cab service and also used local auto transport for local sightseeing. Sadly, the Paradise beach and Auroville were closed due to COVID restrictions so I couldn't go there. Food (especially South Indian filter coffee in Chennai) was good.

**Kerala (2020 Dec last week - NYE)** \- I somehow wanted to travel again immediately (Perhaps it was the impact of COVID lockdowns). Based on good reviews, I contacted Iris Holidays. With Thiruvananthapuram as base, I went on day trips to Kovalam, Poovar, Varkala, Chittipara, Thenmala, and Neyyar. Except the elephant sanctuary at Neyyar, I really enjoyed all the places; especially Poovar, Varkala, and boat rides at Thenmala and Neyyar. The hike at Chittipara felt a bit risky (it is better avoid going there during rainy season) so I didn't stay there for long but I enjoyed the views from the mountain.

**Assam (Oct 2022)** \- In 2016, we (friends group) previously went on a trip to Northeast. Then we contacted Nature Hunt Eco Camp to help us plan Assam-Meghalaya itinerary and book safaris in Kaziranga. I contacted them again for this trip. This was a 9-day trip to Jorhat (Hollongapar Gibbon Sanctuary), Majuli, Nameri National Park, Manas National Park, and Guwahati (Chandubi lake). As cyclone Sitrang brought heavy rains, I couldn't go on a boat ride in Nameri NP. But the rest of the trip was great. My favorites are Majuli, Hollongapar Gibbon Sanctuary, and Chandubi lake during sunrise and sunset. Try to visit Majuli during Shri Krishna Raas Leela festival. It is their biggest festival.

**Madurai - Rameshwaram - Dhanushkodi (June last week 2023)** \- This was my first independent trip and I mostly used public transport. Madurai, Rameshwaram, and Dhanushkodi have been on my list since long. With Madurai as base, I went on a day trip to Rameshwaram and Dhanushkodi. I booked my stay at Regency Madurai. For Madurai local sightseeing, I used a local auto. I recommend hiring a guide during your visit to Madurai Meenakshi Amman temple. There are a lot of details that one a can miss without a guide. To reach Rameshwaram, I took an early morning 4:30-5am bus from Mattuthavani bus stand in Madurai. The journey was beautiful, especially during sunrise and while crossing the Pamban bridge. For local sightseeing in Rameshwaram and Dhanushkodi, I hired a local cab. Dhanushkodi beach was simply stunning. The Madurai and Rameshwaram temples were very beautiful. Despite the crowd and long queues, the temples are managed very well and totally safe. From Madurai/Rameshwaram, one can head to Kanyakumari or Kodaikanal. I didn't have time so I skipped these.

1loy80c,https://i.redd.it/0vamxhy4q8af1.jpeg,140 cal 30g protein tiramisu,"it may look ugly but my mouth says otherwise, it was amazing, had it for breakfast. it's great for prepping ahead aswell as it only gets better after staying in the fridge. 

next time i'll try it with vanilla protein instead of chocolate, i think it would be closer to the tiramisu flavour, since we're dipping it in coffee anyways. 

additional tweaks: 
don't forget to add salt + vanilla/almond extract to the batter for a more premium feel. i also didn't notice a difference whether i used milk or water and excluding the syrup didn't change anything either as my powder was sweet enough on it's own.

you could easily double or triple this recipe and it'd still be extremely low calorie, that is if you're not afraid of permanently damaging your intestines.

1loy7ef,https://www.reddit.com/r/capitalcom/comments/1loy7ef/four_ways_to_improve_focus_when_trading/,Four Ways to Improve Focus When Trading,"***“Execution is everything.”*** *It’s a phrase you’ll hear time and again in trading circles, and for good reason. Having a solid strategy is important, but it means very little if you can’t stay focused enough to follow through. One moment of hesitation, one distracted click, and the edge you worked so hard to find can vanish in an instant.*  
  
*Focus is the gateway to execution. Without it, even the best setups fall apart. Yet in a world of constant noise with live charts, endless alerts, social media and background distractions it’s never been harder to stay present and in control. Here are four ways to improve your focus while trading. Two are grounded and practical. Two are a bit more unconventional. All of them can help you sharpen your focus where it really counts in the moment of decision.*

  
**1. Start with a Written Game Plan**  
This is the foundation. Before you even open your trading platform, write down your trade ideas, key levels, and any news or events that could impact your market. It doesn’t have to be elaborate. A simple list of “if this, then that” scenarios is enough.  
  
By putting your plan on paper, you free up mental space and reduce emotional interference. You’re no longer reacting to every tick or candle. You’re tracking a few clear ideas and waiting for price to confirm your bias. That alone can dramatically improve focus. When your brain knows the plan, it doesn’t need to make it up on the fly.  
  
More importantly, a written plan acts as an anchor when the session heats up. If you get shaken by a false breakout or tempted by something that wasn’t in your prep, it’s easy to refer back and reset. The best traders are those who execute simple ideas with discipline, not those who chase every signal that flashes across the screen.

  
**2. Silence the Noise Around You**  
Multitasking is the enemy of trading. One browser tab for news, another for Twitter, five charts open, notifications popping up on your phone it all adds up to mental chaos.  
  
Clean up your digital workspace before you start trading. Close all tabs that aren’t directly relevant to your session. Mute group chats. Set your phone to silent and put it face down, or better yet, in a drawer. Keep your trading screen as clean as possible. Use one or two key charts. Turn off indicators you don’t need.  
  
If you trade in a noisy household or shared office space, noise-cancelling headphones can be a game changer. Some traders even use ambient sound apps like [brain.fm](http://brain.fm) or simple white noise to drown out distractions and stay locked in. A quiet mind is a focused mind.

  
**3. Stand Up Before You Enter a Trade**  
Here’s something a little unorthodox, but surprisingly effective. Before you click the buy or sell button, physically stand up.  
  
This small physical action creates a moment of separation between your thinking and your doing. It forces you to pause, breathe, and check in with yourself. Am I acting on plan or emotion? Is this trade aligned with my prep, or am I forcing it out of boredom?  
  
We’ve all taken impulsive trades, only to regret them seconds later. Standing up adds a layer of intentionality. It breaks the rhythm of screen-staring and puts your brain back in the driver’s seat.  
  
Think of it as your personal circuit breaker. It gives you a chance to double-check your logic and stops you from slipping into autopilot mode. Some traders even take it a step further and stretch or roll their shoulders before re-engaging with the screen. It might sound silly, but the effect on your mindset is real.

  
**4. Use a ‘Focus Trigger’ to Prime Your Brain**  
Our brains love routines. You can use that to your advantage by building a simple ritual that tells your mind, “It’s time to trade.”  
  
This doesn’t have to be anything elaborate. It might be playing a song you only use when trading or doing a brief breathing exercise. Some traders even use the act of cleaning their desk or making a fresh cup of coffee as a cue to shift into a focused state.  


**Conclusion**  
Over time, these small rituals become associated with mental readiness. They condition your brain to transition from passive scrolling or chatting into active concentration. That’s powerful, especially on days when you’re feeling a bit foggy or distracted.  
  
The goal isn’t to create a superstition. It’s to build a reliable on-ramp into a focused headspace something that centres you and sets the tone for your session.",2,1751365885.0,capitalcom,0,1.0,False

1loy6r4,https://www.reddit.com/r/TestedAtHome/comments/1loy6r4/should_you_choose_the_breville_soft_top_pure/,Should You Choose the Breville Soft Top Pure Electric Kettle?,"Breville BKE700BSSUSC was a pleasant surprise for someone like me, who relies heavily on tea and coffee to fuel my day. It’s undoubtedly a sleek and modern kettle that caught my eye with its brushed stainless steel finish. The first thing that intrigued me was its ergonomic handle paired with a soft-grip design. Straight out of the box, it was evident this kettle was designed with user comfort in mind. The size is perfect, holding up to seven cups, which is more than sufficient for hosting small gatherings. My mornings felt much calmer, thanks to its soft-opening lid that quietly releases steam without any aggressive splashing.

**Ease of Use for Busy Days**

With a 360-degree multi-directional base and built-in cord storage, moving this electric kettle around my kitchen felt seamless. I often found myself brewing tea in different spots—it adapted beautifully wherever I placed it. The dual water windows were an unexpected lifesaver, ensuring I filled the kettle only with the water I needed. For someone always in a morning rush, the illuminated power switch was a really thoughtful detail. It gave me an instant visual cue that my warm beverage was on its way.

[Check Breville BKE700BSSUSC price on Amazon.](https://ultrasonicstore.com/p/b06zzqmvbk/)

**Strengths**

- The soft-opening lid prevents burns and steam splashes, which was a big win for my safety-conscious approach to cooking.  
- I appreciated its cordless design—it’s such a relief not dealing with tangled cords.  
- The handle is not only ergonomic but offers a lid release button, adding convenience.  
 
**Negatives**

- The exterior surface tends to show water spots easily, and keeping it spotless required extra care.  
- Its weight of 2.98 pounds makes it slightly heavier than other models, especially when filled to capacity.  

**Safety and Build Quality**

This electric kettle felt sturdy, and to be honest, I expected no less from a Breville product. The BPA-free materials further reassured me about health safety—a non-negotiable feature for me as someone mindful of chemical exposure from household products. The push-button lid that staggers steam release was another thoughtful design choice. I’ve had my share of minor kitchen accidents with other kettles, but this one avoided any spitting or splattering.

**Performance in Daily Usage**

Boiling water has never been quicker or quieter for me. With a powerful 1500-watt motor, this appliance swiftly heated up my tea water. I tested the maximum 57 oz (1.7-liter) capacity on multiple occasions, including weekend brunches with friends, and it didn’t falter once. Consistency is always key, and this kitchen gadget nailed it every single time.

**Favorable Attributes**

- Staggered steam release enhances kitchen safety.
- High-speed boiling due to the 1500-watt motor.  
- BPA-free structure, ensuring a health-focused design.  

**Critiques**

- The lack of additional temperature control settings stood out immediately. It might not appeal to those who prefer precise controls for specialty teas or coffees.  
- Compared to some other electric kettles I’ve used, the design here feels slightly bulkier.  

**Competing Options**

Comparing this to other brands was inevitable. I previously owned a Cuisinart cordless model, which, though decent, lacked Breville’s refined ergonomic features. Another similar option, the Hamilton Beach Electric Kettle, often boasts highly customizable temperature settings but seemed less robust in build quality. Both models, however, are lighter in weight, which might appeal to users sensitive to heftier designs. That said, the Breville kettle makes up with its stellar safety and ease of use.

**True Value**

Though it might lean on the higher end of the price spectrum compared to some alternatives, Breville’s combination of safety features, ergonomics, and consistent performance made it worth the consideration. It felt like an investment in quality rather than a mere purchase. For households or workplaces that prioritize safety and durability over flashy features, it’s hard to beat what this kettle offers.

Long story: 

My partner and I wanted to adopt an adult dog as a companion for my 6 year old Pomeranian as we are both full time workers and he is a ball of energy so we surmised that getting an adult friend for him, might tire him out a little as we felt guilty not playing with him as often as he wanted to. 
We also start work very early so there aren't any day cares that were open that we could of taken him to. 
We ended up finding a dog that was advertised online (not a breeder), 2 years old, same breed (Pomeranian) so went and saw her and made the impulsive decision to adopt without asking all the appropriate questions. 
We found out she had been abused, suffered from separation anxiety and more than likely, had been kept as an outside dog (i.e. not toilet trained). 
But... my 6 year old Pomeranian gets along with her quite well, which was a positive. 
After getting in a dog trainer to help with some of her issues, we thought things would be smooth sailing.. Wrong. 
She has almost gone backwards. As I mentioned, my partner and I work full time and when we come home we don't have much time left in the day other than to have dinner and go to bed so we have been really struggling with the following: 

1. Toilet training
 During the day both dogs are kept in the laundry with a dog door that allows them outside to a small run, 3m roughly, to use as a toilet or fresh air. But for the past month or so, she has been urinating inside but poops outside. We use the proper cleaners to clean up but she still goes inside almost daily. 

She does pee outside but cant understand why out of the however many times she goes during the day, she still goes inside. 
We have also tried crate training during the times we are home and it works for a couple of days / a week and then she will even go in her crate, despite just having been outside or free roam to go outside. 

2. Behaviour 
 She was abused at some point by her previous owners so whenever we at all express any frustration or try to physically move her off a seat or off our laps, she yelps blue murder, loudly! And we definitely are not doing anything to cause that.. It makes us feel terrible and even more frustrated at the situation because we aren't hurting her or doing anything wrong. 

She is food obsessed. Which is okay to a degree but she will go for anything, my vape was left on the arm chair and she hopped up and chewed it. I had a full cup of takeaway coffee on the coffee table and she pulled it off onto the carpeted floor. 

My partner is 95% settled on the decision that we should rehome her but I just don't want to feel like we've not tried all options first. 

Any help with the above would be super appreciated.

Reaching out for support,"Not a divorce post but this community was checking all the boxes for me. I really hope this brings some clarity, I’ve been in it. all month. & I’m burning out. 
Thanks if you’re reading. 

So I found out in my workplace 2 weeks ago (a restaurant) that she’s bought her own home 45 minutes away. From one of her best friends, boy friends. He just casually brought it up assuming I knew. 

- this rocked me. Hard. And I still had to manage a busy restaurant for the rest of the evening. 

- I work a lot. Like way too much a lot. An 8 hr shifts turn into 10, turns into 12… into 14 way too easily (and that’s a separate issue) This caused a huge amount of resentment in our relationship while she was on Mat. Leave. And I see that now… she felt alone. (The irony here; that I’m sure a lot of us feel, is that I told myself it was for them.) 

Trust was also broken a few times in the beginning of our relationship, and I’ve felt on trial for every shortcoming in our relationship no matter the reconciliation. 
I know I’m a good dad, and a loving and deeply caring partner. 

I should have seen the signs. She was in a severe accident and suffered massive head trauma 2 years prior our meeting 
(post concussion syndrome I believe) 
- during the late stages of pregnancy and first 3 months after we had our boy something got really exacerbated. Like post partum rage bouts 11/10. The issue for me is how justified she feels in treating me this way- I was doing my best to work and build a career for us. 

From what I see- She has severe emotional regulation problems, and quite possibly a rage problem. My trucks been damaged, I’ve been locked out of our home we rent, intensely shouted at for lengthy periods of time while I sit and try to listen and remain calm as she loops out and escalates herself.

- so now we’re here. I thought it was getting better, I took the downstairs room to give her some space so we could work on things and still have a semblance of together-ness. 

& now I just found out through the grapevine she’s bought a home… something we dreamed of doing together. It hurts. I still love her so much… she’s a good mom. 

Especially since the whole working on stuff timeline has been a facade. she’s been using this time to build a massive case against me. 
Things would genuinely improve every week, but then on Wednesdays after her therapy appt the anger would come back. (A mutual friend stopped seeing the same therapist as she “clearly hates men.”) her relationship with her therapist raises serious questions of patient boundaries and the red flags are everywhere. I want her to have support, but their relationship, has, and still feels- very wrong. 

So ya. I don’t know where to go from here man. My job is crumbling around me, I still work way too much. My boss is actively sandbagging me trying to get me fired- And she’s completely shut me out. Also… right before I moved downstairs, I’m pretty sure she started having coffee hangouts with this dude in town… I see him around and my blood just boils imagining him with her and my son.

I feel so fking alone. 
No one will talk to me in our friend group, I worry about slander etc. 

Hope someone finds this here. I’ve never felt so utterly hopeless in every avenue of my life.
