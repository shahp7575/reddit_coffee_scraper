**Week Before:**

* Run a mock audit with your most nitpicky employee (they'll find stuff the auditor will find)​
* Check that controlled documents actually say ""controlled"" and aren't from 2019​
* Make sure SOMEONE knows where everything is (don't be the person frantically searching for records during the audit)

**3 Days Before:**

* Brief your team: ""Auditor asks about a process? Describe what you ACTUALLY do, not what you think sounds impressive""
* Have your management rep confirm they'll be available (nothing worse than ""sorry, they're in meetings all day"")
* Prepare a clean audit room - chaos doesn't inspire confidence

**Day Before:**

* Sleep. Seriously. A tired brain makes dumb mistakes.
* Have your audit schedule and attendee list ready​
* Review your previous audit findings - they WILL ask about them

**Audit Day:**

* Coffee. Lots of it.
* Be honest about gaps - auditors respect transparency over BS​
* Take notes on findings so you're not scrambling later

What am I missing? What saved YOUR butt during audit time?",1,1768278649.0,PacificCertifications,0,1.0,False

1qbhqhg,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qbhqhg,[SNK063JS] Seiko 5 Automatic Black Eastern Arabic Dial 34MM Review,"Seiko 5 Automatic Black Eastern Arabic Dial (SNK063JS) 34MM

Ill start with a memory: it's a balmy summer afternoon, midweek, and the outdoor market is beaming with vendors at their stalls, laughing, yelling, pleading. In all the chaos of sounds, scents, and sights, you catch the glimpses of the glisten from their wrists. A dark black dial sitting firmly, understated in its size but easily recognizable. While not a popular piece, it was a model that caught the eye and an early memory of watches seen on the men at this time in the mid to late 90s. 

From this memory, I decided to purchase the 34MM version and add to my easy day wear options. First and foremost, the price of this watch comes out to under $125 when on sale and with some coupons. The Eastern Arabic numerals are a pleasent vibe, but more lovely is the day adjustment has dual English and Arabic day script. Position 1 also adjusts the date setting. No screw down crown and a mere 30M water resistance, but are you really talking a dip in this watch? For the life of the man walking about the streets of town, wandering the markets, taking a coffee and smoke midday, this is the daily wear that truly satisfies. An automatic movement which makes it easy to slap on and not worry about it dying out with the 40hr power reserve. Truthfully I am getting about 30hrs but cant complain. No sapphire crystal but the hardlex is more than sufficient to keep away scratches from little smacks and bangs. 

The worst part is of course the bracelet. It feels cheap and wears light on the wrist creating and odd disbalance with the weight of the case. I ended up purchasing the Uncle Straps Executive Bracelet and it looks quite a lot better IMHO. I haven't found end links yet to complete the setup given the 34MM case size and the small lug width. The lume is sufficient and does last a fair amount, after giving it a nice dose of UV light, it lasts me through most of my night if I need a quick peak. 

Ill leave it off with this - this watch heralds back to a time in my childhood and the men of such a time. I wear it with that vision in mind and it is a call to a distant time, distant place and the reliving of distant memories. ",1,1768278263.0,u_mkkmikon,0,1.0,False

The aesthetics are a good balace and its not forceful. Natural light, plants, koi fish, music, and spaces that feel like they want you to stay a while. 

There are also so many coffee options and are consistently delicious — whether it’s a Ca phe sua da, cafe muoi, or something lighter and more modern.

The service is great as well, mostly the girls are respectful. No pressure to order more, no rushing you out. You can sit for an hour or two and just… exist.

Somehow, this simple routine has helped me reset my attention span. Reading feels easier. Thinking feels clearer. Even doing nothing feels great.

that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

This is a bit of a casual thought I’ve been having.

I brew cold brew coffee at home and spend a lot of time experimenting with different beans and combinations. Nothing fancy or commercial just trying things out because I enjoy it.

I was wondering if there’s anyone here who’s also into coffee and might be interested in forming a small group (under 10 people) to meet once in a while, taste brews, and talk coffee.

Preferably people around HSR or nearby, so it’s easy to meet and keep it low-effort.

If this sounds interesting, feel free to comment or DM.
And if it’s not your thing, no worries I would appreciate it if you could share this with a friend who might be interested.

So I've liked this girl for awhile, roughly 3ish months. We had never talked and only knew each other from following each other on Instagram. I decided to message her on the 6th (roughly 7 something at night) just complimenting her and saying she was pretty. Around noon on the 8th she responds ""Hey! Thank you that's so sweet!"" I know life is busy and people always have something going on but I had started to think she wasn't going to respond so when she did I was surprised. I had got her response as I was going into work so I couldn't respond until roughly seven hours later. I though her and I had gone to the same high school so I responded asking if she had gone where I had. Once again that was on the 8th and she didn't respond until around noon on the 11th with ""I did! You did too?"" Once again  was busy when she messaged so after 3ish hours I respond saying that I did and that I though I was a couple years ahead of her and just asked when she graduated. And that is where we are at now.

Now I wanna ask her out for a coffee or something sometime but don't know when is to soon. In terms of the actual conversation it seems to soon cause we really haven't said much. But in terms of actual time it's been nearly a week. So how soon is too soon. Like it seems like she's engaged with the conversations even if she takes a while to respond but once again I'm bad with this type of thing. I mean I though that the several uses of explanation points meant something at first but the I told myself it could just be her being nice case Ince again Im bad at this.

Also I have had a female friend kinda helping me with the conversation but I'm kinda worried about the advice she's given. She told me I should wait no more then 30 minutes to respond even if the girl I'm messaging takes days to respond cause she may think I've lost interest in the conversation.

A bit late to post this as I was away from home and all my coffee bags until now

Here is my year of coffee! Definitely realized PERC is probably my favorite roaster lol. I think out of all the bags I purchased this year, the Diego Bermudez Castillo M-03 was one that really impressed me. Spot on with the tasting notes. The perfect coffee to wake up and make while I was in Fire Camp this year. 

Tried my first Gesha this year and loved it! Coincidentally it was also from Diego Bermudez

The B&W “Salad Mix” was a fantastic way to see how the different processes can change the flavors brought out from the same beans

The Futura Coffee was a 3 pack of their single origin offerings and I loved each one! One bag is missing from the photo as I gave the last of it to a buddy who really like it

My wife surprised me with the Onyx advent calendar and it was overall a great experience! Only downside is that one of the bags inside the box wasn’t sealed right and spilled about half of it out. It was day 14 or so, so I didn’t realized it was just getting stale while I made my way through the month.

Sorry for the long post and how late it was from the new year but hope y’all enjoy it or find it interesting anyways!

We've hung out, made fun memories just going to coffee shops, shopping, trying out a bar or two. As the older sister, I often took us on trips in my car. I even took our two cousins that are closer to her age. Sometimes, I've taken her friends a few times. 

Now fast forward to where she is more independent. We still hang out at times. But I've started feeling excluded when she didn't invite me to any big trips out of state. I've noticed that there were times my cousins had plans to invite me, but my sister ""forgot"" to let me know at times. She planned a few big trips already for 2026 with one of our cousins and they are going together. No invite, even hesitated mentioning it to me until my mother brought it up and I happened to be there. I get it, they are closer in age and therefore get along more. She is individuating, protecting her autonomy. Might want to 100% be freely herself without her protective older sister there. No amount of sister ""coolness"" can get me invited.

And I HATE that my loneliness & growing sadness makes me feel so unconsidered. Betrayed even. I feel immature for having these feelings. I've taken us to long road trips, with my car. Took them to scenic routes they requested. Paid for some of their travels. And now that they have jobs and cars, I get don't get invited to some big trips. I was useful. Convenient. That's it. I know they care about me but that's how I've been feeling lately.

I'm at a place where I want to respect her wish. But now I want to find my OWN travel friends. Or friends that would value me for me. Not because I'm convenient or have a car. I want to find friends that genuinely want to make memories with me when traveling or planning trips. I just don't know where to start. I KNOW solo travel is an option and I've heard good things about it. But I also want a travel buddy down the road. Someone to share happy memories with.

We live in a society that worships hustle and glamorizes burnout. Everyone's chasing productivity hacks, drinking cold brew like water, and treating rest like it's a luxury instead of a necessity. But here’s the wild part: **strategic napping might be the most underrated performance tool out there**. Scroll through TikTok or IG and you’ll see influencers pushing 5AM wakeups and 16  hour workdays, but most of that advice is either science  less or just flex content for the algorithm. This post is for those who want real, research  backed nap facts (from actual sleep scientists, not some guy with a ring light).

*No, you’re not lazy for needing a nap. Yes, naps can be trained and optimized.*  
Here’s what the best researchers, books, and podcasts have revealed.

      

* **Not all naps are created equal**
  * *Short naps (10–20 mins)* = great for alertness and energy with minimal grogginess.
  * *Naps over 30 minutes* = can send you into deep sleep and leave you with sleep inertia (aka that awful fog).
  * *Source:* NASA’s research on pilot fatigue found that a **26  minute nap improved performance by 34%**, and alertness by 54%.

* **You probably have a   nap window  **
  * Most people naturally dip in energy **between 1–3pm**, due to circadian rhythms.
  * That’s your biological sweet spot for a power nap.
  * *Matthew Walker*, sleep expert and author of *Why We Sleep*, broke this down in multiple talks and books. He says even night owls experience this crash, just later.

* **Naps can improve memory consolidation**
  * A 2020 study in *Scientific Reports* found that a brief daytime nap helped people recall more information and had a similar effect to overnight sleep.
  * Sleep researcher *Sara Mednick*, author of *Take a Nap! Change Your Life*, shows how certain nap lengths mimic sleep cycles and help with learning, especially motor skills and creative problem  solving.

* **  Caffeine naps   are a real thing**
  * Drink a coffee right before a 15–20 minute nap. By the time the caffeine hits, you’ll wake up refreshed and energized.
  * According to *Psychophysiology Journal*, this combo was more effective at reducing drowsiness than either alone.

* **Napping can boost emotional regulation**
  * The *American Psychological Association* released data showing that naps help reduce frustration and increase tolerance to stress.
  * Basically, a nap can reset your overwhelmed brain and help you emotionally   reboot  .

* **Regular nappers may have better heart health**
  * A Swiss study from *BMJ Heart* (2019) found that **occasional naps (1–2x per week)** were linked to a lower risk of heart disease and strokes.
  * Chronic fatigue raises cortisol and blood pressure, naps seem to counteract that.

* **Even elite athletes nap, on purpose**
  * *LeBron James*, *Usain Bolt*, and members of *Team USA Olympic squads* all build naps into their day to improve recovery and focus.
  * Sports scientists now design nap schedules as part of competitive strategy.

* **Your nap needs change with age**
  * Teenagers and older adults have more fragmented night sleep, so they benefit more from daytime rest.
  * Infants nap because their brains are growing, but adults still need them for brain *maintenance*.

* **Naps can counter sleep deprivation but not forever**
  * Studies from *Harvard Medical School* show that naps can offset one night of poor sleep but can’t replace consistent sleep hygiene.
  * Think of naps as a supplement, not a substitute.

* **Too many naps might be a red flag**
  * If you need 2+ naps daily, it could signal **chronic sleep debt, depression, or sleep disorders like sleep apnea**.
  * A 2020 article in *Sleep Medicine Reviews* warned of excessive napping in older adults being linked to cognitive decline.

* **You can train yourself to nap faster**
  * Like any habit, nap timing and sleep latency can be learned.
  * *Andrew Huberman*, a Stanford neurobiologist, talks in his podcast about using mindfulness and breathwork before naps to   drop in   faster.

* **  Napxiety   is real but fixable**
  * Some people get anxious trying to nap, fearing they   won’t fall asleep fast enough  .
  * Experts like *Dr. Jade Wu* from *The Sleep Doctor* recommend **visualization**, body scans, or audio meditations like *NSDR (non  sleep deep rest)*, a term made popular by Huberman Lab Podcast, to get similar brain  rest benefits even without actual sleep.

      

We’ve been taught to treat rest like it has to be earned. But if NASA trusts naps to make pilots sharper at 30,000 feet, isn’t it kinda wild that we treat it like failure when we do it on our lunch break?

I have one friend, zero experience with women in any capacity (never even been on a coffee), and years of isolation behind me. This is not just one problem among many, this is the first wall I need to break. If I don’t get past this, nothing else in my life can really progress. I've tried.

I’ve reached the point where my life itself is the problem. Thinking or mentally re-evaluating is not the solution. I’ve thought deeply about this for years, and all thinking does now is make everything worse. I spiral, build narratives, and destroy myself internally. I’m not choosing to “stop thinking” because it works, I’m doing it because I don’t know what else to do.

The only rule I will operate from now on is: no thinking, no evaluating, only “did I do the task?” I’m forcing myself into action because analysis has failed completely. But what should those tasks be? Except for the gym.

This rule will stay until I stop feeling like I'm being tortured by demons daily.

I’m also enforcing a few hard rules: consistent gym for life and mental structure, and a ban on mind‑reading, if something isn’t said out loud, it doesn’t exist and gets discarded immediately.

The main issue I need help with is the social side, especially around women. Not romantically. Human‑to‑human. I know intellectually that women are just people, but I have no lived experience to support that. Years of avoidance and isolation have left me with a strong belief that people, especially women, don’t want me around. I need to work on this, get past this.

I have tried to act socially. I asked several guys from college to hang out (go for a quick coffee) and all declined. I tried to just get to know one woman and felt avoidance there too, and I also messed it up. Those experiences reinforced the belief that even when I try, I’m unwanted. It feels like social life is something other people get to participate in, and I don’t. Like I'm not human, and it's killing me inside. I know I'm human, but thinking doesn't do it, I need action.

I’m not asking for mindset advice, confidence tips, dating advice, or therapy language. I’m asking for **actionable steps** I can do repeatedly to break this belief through experience. Ways to interact with women as people. Ways to prove to myself, through action alone, that I’m not inherently disliked or rejected.

I cannot start fast, I want slow, day by day small things. I cannot jump into the belly of the beast. I just need slow repeated action. Also I have less than a month of college left, so I cannot rely on college.

If you’ve been socially stuck for years (or just stuck in general, mentally, physically...) and got out through forced action and repetition rather than thinking, I’d really appreciate hearing what actually worked.",1,1768277408.0,LifeAdvice,1,1.0,False

They found minimal lesions, in my cul-de-sac area and excised them. My obgyn suggested getting an IUD to help with pain management and reoccurrence - I said sure, so they popped that sucker in while I was under anesthesia for my endo surgery. Once I recovered from surgery, I noticed my bloating was non-existent, and I wasn't fighting for my life when my period would come around. An actual life changing experience. The doc said to wait about 3 months for the IUD to take effect, and I shouldn't have a period afterward. 

Now, I was diagnosed because I had the long array of usual symptoms that come with typical endo. However, since I reached the ripe age of hitting puberty, I have had some strange occurrences that made me think I always had PCOS. I gained weight real fast, and it has been HARD to get rid of it, especially in my belly region. I'm no Michael Phelps but I try to swim a good 2,000 meters a couple times a week at the gym. The worst symptom out of them all... the facial hair. I'm not talking blonde, barely can see type hair, I'm talking Italian man that grows a beard in less than a day, and no one quite understands how type thick, course hair. I swear, I have to pluck them twice a day and they grow back that fast on my chin and jawline. I also have this hair on my belly, underarms, and chest. 

Fast forward, I do not have PCOS. Endo surgery complete. IUD inserted. I ask my gyno about spirinolactone to help with the facial hair. I get put on 100mg per day. It's now January 2026. 9 months since my surgery... As of 3ish months ago, I notice some strange things. Period? Still happening (although it's 2 weeks late right now, I'm PMSing hard). TMI but I have passed some blood clots that were so freakishly large, they could be in a Ripley's Believe It or Not Museum. Hair? Still thick, still growing. Fatigue? Happening. Mind you, I have ADHD, I take 15 mg extended release adderall Monday-Friday, and only have 1 cup of coffee per day. I wake up refreshed, but around noon, I can barely stay awake. The cramps have come back with a vengeance. I have gone 8 months without using my heating pad. I had to break her back in about a month ago. The extra-strength acetomenaphine works for maybe an hour. I also get these big ole cysts that are nearly impoppable that appear on my chin every so often (remember, all of these symptoms are post endo surgery). 

I met with my PCP a couple of weeks ago. They took my blood, and found my red blood cell count, hematocrit and hemoglobin were high. Thyroid is normal, testosterone normal, everything else was normal. She decided to order me a sleep test to test for sleep apnea, which could explain the fatigue. I don't think I have sleep apnea and I'll tell you why. I get 2 hours of REM sleep per night. I have, and continue to, dream every. single. night like I'm binging a movie marathon. And yes, I remember my dreams. No one has told me I snore. I don't wake up gasping for air, nor wake up in the middle of the night for any reason. My very super duper smart garmin watch tracks my sleep details and nothing seems out of the ordinary. I also tend to get 7.5 - 12 hours (12 if it's the weekend lol). Although, I'm still waiting for the sleep results. 

Here's what I think... a) there's no way my endo came back this quick (or has it?) b) I think it might be a cortisol issue... 

I did some googling (as one does) and believe the thick facial hair, darker skin spots on my underarms and inner thighs, stubborn belly fat, fatigue, etc. aligns with something out of whack with my adrenal glands, therefore affecting the cortisol and making things out of whack. 

As I sit here curled up in bed trying to rid myself of my uterus trying to contract with a heating pad set on high, I ask my fellow endo peeps for advice. I know it's a lot... but I want to know if it's possible that my endo has come back? Or, I should talk to my doc about doing a cortisol test? Or, I'm just crazy and my body is just being it's grand 26 year old self.

**Memory transcript subject: Thomas Sinclair, Human Shelter Administrator**

*Date \[standardized human time\]: November 1st, 2136*

\---

The Venlil on the other end of the line was infuriating. She's used the line 'Exterminators can't be criminally charged for the execution of their duties' three times now, it was the extermination administrator's second favorite excuse.

""I am not asking for criminal charges, I am asking for accountability. You don't want to live in a society where you have to go around being afraid that violent individuals will suddenly decide to hurt you. Why is it so strange that we want the same?""

She sighed, apparently as tired of explaining herself as I was of hearing the explanation. ""Exterminators are not violent, they are allowed to use force to detain dangerous and violent individuals themselves.""

""No charges were ever filed against mister Russo. No 'assessor' was even called in to ascertain that he was in any way violent. The only violent individuals were the ones who assaulted him.""

""Exterminators can hold people suspected of Predator Disease for up to three paws without an assessor, and can release them before then if they believe they are not a threat. They held mister Russo for less than half that time. Their report indicates he threatened one of his Venlil hosts. If anything, they were lenient.""

I felt my heart rate spike with anger, and had to fight to keep my tone level. ""Lenient? That report contradicts the testimony from that very Venlil herself, who stormed into your offices to get him released! She testified that her mother brought false charges against mister Russo, and you released him, but have apparently decided to not follow up because, and I quote you from our last conversation here, ‘incidents confirmed to involve predators are not false reports’.”

“That is correct. Incidents confirmed to involve predators are not false reports.”

So anyone can say anything about humans to the Exterminators, and they’ll never suffer any legal consequences. A planet of Karens, using the state’s protectors as their personal goon squads against a minority population. I sighed at the bitter familiarity of it all, and decided on a slightly different approach. “Do you know how many human dentists there are on Venlil Prime, miss Vithek?""

There was a pause, and sensing a trap she donned the professional uncaring neutrality of a hardened bureaucrat. ""I don't see how that's relevant."" And there was the number one favorite excuse.

""There's one. I had to have him flown in from the capital, because Martin lost three teeth to your Exterminators' 'lenience'. And do you know what he told me?"" There were actually three dentists practicing, and an unknown number among the refugees. But the other two only worked with the military; All the UN's money was going to the war effort, leaving the shelters with scraps. In truth I wasn't even sure we'd be reimbursed for the cost of Dr. Aniston to begin with; I'd paid out of my own pocket.

""I don't see how that's relevant.""

I continued like she hadn't responded with her empty nothing excuse. ""He told me he's had to work over a dozen cases of humans being assaulted by Venlil to the point of suffering dental damage, so far. In fact it's made up a significant fraction of his workload. He also told me that Martin's case was the most severe he had seen as of yet. Now how many incidents have we seen of humans assaulting Venlil in this district, miss Vithek?""

The same uncaring, customer-service voice. ""I don't see how-""

I cut her off at once, having no stomach for another iteration of her fucking mantra. ""It's entirely relevant. How many?""

""No humans have as of yet been convicted of assault against a Venlil in this district."" I was almost impressed with that response. A masterwork of non-admission and technicality, defanging my inevitable retort.

I made it anyway, but added a little bit of venom. I needed to press her, get her to say the magic words. This farce had gone on long enough. ""And no Venlil are apparently going to get charged with assault for this travesty either. Maybe I should have some humans join your guild, so we can get in on the fun too. Why should the Venlil be the only ones to get to give in to their violent, predatory urges under the guise of 'civil protection'?""

Her response now wasn't uncaring, it was a cold and angry snarl. ""This conversation is taking us nowhere."" Bingo. I had my excuse to go over her head.

I donned my own 'armor of contempt': The professional, detached bureaucrat voice she had been using ever since my first call. The rest of the conversation was a formality. ""Clearly. I will be needing your superior's contact information, and the case number for my formal complaint against your office."" In truth I already had Magister Vaska’s contact information, but I still gave her the chance to do her job properly.

She sneered audibly over the phone instead. ""The Magister doesn't work by your schedule.""

""He will, because as a shelter administrator in the UN-Venlil cooperative refugee efforts I can call an emergency meeting if either side's safety is at risk."" It was very much within my power to do so, but it was a nuclear option. Unless I could prove I had exhausted the more polite means first.

Her voice took on a small note of distress. ""That's not necessary.""

My 'armor of contempt' remained, but since I was done with this particular specimen, I took the chance to tell her and her entire profession off. ""Calling your office has been a courtesy, miss Vithek. I did not hold out much hope that you would be reasonable, because we have unaccountable gangs of violent bullies masquerading as peace officers on Earth too. You ‘exterminators’ are entirely familiar to me, behaving as the worst and most predatory of humans do. You are not unique in your callousness and brutality, and this is not the first time I've had to go above the heads of your ilk. Good day to you.""

""Mister Sinclair, I-"" I took no small amount of satisfaction in hanging up. This was my third conversation with the insufferably useless woman, which was really more about doing my due diligence in exhausting all possibilities and seeming reasonable. I wasn't surprised, nor disappointed. You don't work with homeless people and refugees for twenty years and come away with the impression that cops serve any real civic function, and giving them carte blanche to incinerate people wasn't going to change them for the better. This was an old dance, and I knew the steps by heart. It was time to escalate, both to the civil office the Exterminators ostensibly served, and to the fourth estate.

*Date \[standardized human time\]: November 3rd, 2136*

Martin sat in my office, staring at my desk. His face had mostly healed up, and the dental work had taken well. In the opinion of someone far too old to do more than idly appreciate it, I found the young man to be quite handsome. His features were classically regal, with sharp cheekbones and a strong roman nose. His skin was a beautiful olive tone, his eyes were deep and piercing, his slight build had a flexile and agile look, and his hair looked wonderfully curly and tousled. More than that, he was thoughtful, methodical, and highly intelligent. I thought to myself wryly, *In my younger days, I'd have been quite smitten.*

But after he got back to the shelter, he'd had the cringing and skittish demeanor of anyone who's survived a close encounter with violent authority. I'd seen it too many times before: If he couldn't get out of his own head he'd end up losing the battle; the Exterminators would successfully cow him. Thankfully, I knew the cure. To get out of your own head, you simply need to get out of your own head. Sadly simple doesn't mean easy, and for many people it took a great deal of time and a great deal of help. But I thought there was a resilient quality to the young man, and the direct approach felt like the way to go.

I got up and moved around my desk, sitting in the chair next to his instead. I held my hands out, palms upward, in a silent offer. He took me up on it, and put his hands in my own. I clasped them around his, and looked him in the eyes sincerely. His hands were warm and soft. He looked back, gaze flicking back and forth between my eyes with some uncertainty. ""I must say, you have been amazingly brave about all of this, Martin. And... I'm sorry that you've had to be. Injustice burns, doesn't it? Like a... furnace, somewhere in the pit of your stomach and the back of your throat at the same time.""

He nodded simply, looking down at our joined hands before raising his gaze back to me again. His eyes glistened. ""Yeah. It does.""

""Well, I'm not done fighting this with you. In fact, I've barely started, and alien or not they won't get away with it. But it will take time. And until then... you can't lay down. You need to get up, and keep moving. The bastards don't win when they smack you down: they only win when you don't get back up.""

He didn't quite scoff, but I could tell it was an effort not to. ""Get back up and keep doing... what, exactly? Everyone here just drinks coffee and stares at the walls all day.""

I used a gently chiding voice, a reminder of the importance of empathy. ""Everyone here is traumatized, Martin. We all heal at our own pace. But before the Exterminators’ assault, you were already proactive; you wanted to get out and do some good. Your exact words to me when you signed up to live with our hosts were 'since I'm already here, I might as well help cooperation between us and the Venlil, and free up some resources for everyone else here'. I found that quite admirable.""

He nodded. ""I remember.""

I gave him a soft, comforting smile. ""Well, that impulse, that urge to help, it can still be put to use. Right here, for instance. There's a lot to do, and few hands to do it. I'm not saying you need to do anything, of course, but I've always found it helps me. When I feel that sick, burning sense of injustice and helplessness... I can take solace in that I've done something, anything. Because I've proved the bastards wrong, gotten up when they wanted me to stay down, spat out the blood, and helped others. I refuse to let them make me passive, or callous and cruel like them."" Doing good out of spite was, in my experience, often at least as good a motivator as doing good out of sheer altruism.

He swallowed, and looked down. I waited patiently. I saw him take a deep breath, and his posture straighten up ever so slightly. My smile widened into a grin as he looked back up with steel in his eyes, and I knew what he'd say even before he opened his mouth. The boy was back on his proverbial feet. ""Fuck it, it's worth a shot. Okay, Tom... Where do I start? What can I do to help?""

\---

*Date \[standardized human time\]: November 5th, 2136*

\---

""I've already had interest in the story from several journalists, both human and Venlil. Exterminator malfeasance and abuse, in response to this young man's attempts to heroically save Venlil at the cost of his own safety. Twice in one paw.""

I was in a meeting with District Magister Vaska, in his office. His body language was guarded. ""You didn't call this meeting to talk about the media, though.""

""No, I did not. I called it because the Exterminators have been stonewalling my attempts to get some accountability out of them. In fact, I still do not have the names of the officers involved in either incident.""

""In the case of possible retaliation from people with Predator Disease, the Exterminators can keep their names private.""

""But Martin Russo does not have Predator Disease. In fact, he was never even assessed for it.""

Vaska interjected. ""So he might have it, meaning he might want to retaliate.""

My 'armor of contempt' had been donned since before I even stepped through the doors, but I still found the need to reinforce my calm and detached Bureaucrat Voice. ""You are not suggesting, sir, that as long as the exterminators do not actually have their victims assessed for Predator Disease, and release them within three paws, they remain free to do whatever they want in anonymity? That sounds like a highly abusable loophole. But not an unprecedented one. The governments of some particularly predatory Earth nations have similar systems in place.""

He flicked his ears in a sign of slight distress at the obvious implication, but maintained his composure. ""In that case, if this is normal for you too, why are we here?""

""Because it should not be normal for anyone, sir. I fought it on Earth and I will keep fighting it here."" I shot back at once. ""People should not be living in fear of those that the state has put in charge of protecting them.""

He flicked his ear and swished his tail in a disagreeing motion. ""People don't live in fear of Exterminators.""

I shot back again. ""Your people might not, but mine do. They have known nothing but brutality, violence, hostility, and callous disregard from the Exterminators. A show of good faith would go a long way to letting us human know that we are still considered sapients under the law, and not just predator incidents waiting to happen.""

""So what would you have me do? Dismiss the officers, even if they've been good upstanding civil servants for their entire careers?""

I gave him an explanation on basic civic hygiene, with some mustard up front. ""Good upstanding civil servants do not commit aggravated assault, and they certainly do not have a system in place to shield them from the consequences when they do. Humanity has a basic method to ensure a government works for all its people: TAO. It stands for Transparency, Accountability, and Oversight. In the long term, I would have this anonymity loophole and any similar ones closed. I would have clear rules put in place for what happens to Exterminators and other civil servants who abuse their position of power and privilege, and I would have a joint agency with representatives of all species on Venlil Prime, including humans, to adjudicate these cases and for the Exterminators to be held accountable to. And I would have all of this information, processes as well as individual cases, be on public record and available to everyone.""

I’d also like the entire goddamn profession to go the way of the dodo, but saying that out loud wasn’t going to help.

Vaska flicked his tail with annoyance. ""Oh, just that? What you're talking about is a very long process.""

""Yes, I know. But I believe it very much necessary. It is poor civic hygiene to install systems that can be used to facilitate a police state, and I am sorry to say that the Federation and Venlil Prime are rife with them. But as you say, sir, dismantling those systems is a long process. In the short term I would settle for the names of the officers involved in the physical assault of Martin Russo, an official apology and admission of guilt from the Exterminators’ guild, and a committee including at least one human to decide what punishment to enact against the officers in question. If criminal charges cannot be leveled against them, then they can still be made to pay a settlement, or be put on unpaid leave, or yes - fired. If that's not possible, then I will be left with no choice but to escalate matters elsewhere.""

His ears flipped down over his skull, and he glared at me briefly. ""I understand. I'll see what I can do.""

There were two ways he could respond to this. I’d planned for both of them, though I hoped he’d choose the path of reason. ""I appreciate that, sir. Thank you for your time.""

I was visited early in the 'paw' in my office by a UN representative named Robert McGinley, a thin man in his mid-40s. He wore glasses, a freshly ironed charcoal suit, and a flat grey tie. And he had a leather briefcase with him. Instead of shaking my hand, he held out his credentials as a UN-Venlil joint representative, rubberstamped by Magister Vaska and my own supervisor, Bob Willson. I didn't bother suppressing the sigh. There was only one reason for this living embodiment of a Suit to show up this early in the proceedings.

*Oh, this bodes poorly.*

I ignored the man and sent out a couple of prepared emails under the guise of finishing up my work. Canaries to my journalistic contacts: If they didn’t hear back from me soon, they’d be free to publish everything I had already given them. Including the medical reports from the dentist, the testimony of Thiva, and the recordings of all my communications with the Exterminators guild, Magister Vaska, the district attorney, and three separate legal offices.

In fact, one Venlil reporter in particular was already cross-referencing all of our data with the Exterminators’ records to figure out the identity of the perpetrators. The sons of bitches would be exposed to the public, with or without the help of the law.

If Vaska had run squealing to the UN to shut us up, my brave investigative friend was going to ensure the Magistrate would join the guild in the public spotlight. And neither of them would particularly enjoy it. Only after taking out that little insurance policy did I bother to respond to McGinley’s presence. ""I take it you would like me to fetch mister Russo at his earliest convenience?""

McGinley didn't smile. The UN hatchet man's face looked like smiles were entirely alien to it. ""Right away would be better.""

*Come on, you feckless bastards. Show me you sent him here to do some good. Prove me wrong.*

Next to my where I’m posted tonight there is a 24hr storage facility, brand new, super nice 3 story structure.

I see them unloading their car & go back to reading a book in my truck, 30ish mins go by & I hear something smack the door of my truck, this causes the dog to start barking (she was asleep until this point) & eventually (after a scream & several words I could decipher) realized the toddler was outside my truck. 

I’m about 20-30yrds inside my company’s fenced in lot, & the gate is about 20-30yrds from the loading area of the storage facility. 
Meaning this kid, who was barefoot & had no jacket came 50yrds over to my truck.

I got out & we walked back over to the storage place together, asked him his mom & dads names got the typical “mom” & “dad” the asked for his brothers name, the kids in tears because he thinks he’s in trouble, nobody is responding to my shouts into the storage facility so I assume they’re on the floors above. 

We spent almost 30 mins waiting downstairs in the ‘lobby’ before his parents came down & they immediately started yelling & threatening me. I finally got to explain the situation & they then threatened to ‘come back’ if I called the cops or did anything.

I called the cops before & gave them the plates, address, & times this occurred (cameras for both properties will have gotten everything).

It’s not that kids can’t be wonderful, it’s that choosing to remain child-free in your 30s and 40s often feels like accidentally discovering the VIP section of adulthood while everyone else is still waiting in the long, sticky line for the family restroom. And honestly? The view from up here is pretty damn sweet.",105,1768277068.0,Millennials,109,0.75,False

\#2 in the “Just Let the Locals Have This” Series
The front desk clerk (the big Spanish girl with the long black hair 😒) really tried to set me up. Sent me all the way to the back of the motel, in a room that felt like a trap. The door wouldn’t even close, much less lock — like I was just supposed to sleep wide open for the streets.
To top it off, the toilet wouldn’t flush. Not clogged… straight up broken. Whole place was a dump.
This wasn’t just bad service — this felt intentional. Definitely not safe, not clean, not worth a dime.
🛑 If you’re not from here, don’t even try it. Just let the locals have this one.
don't let them send you to room 235

The worst of the Worst! Needs to be Condemned! Not safe! Called the Health department and the attorney general! This place is a disaster! Fake pictures. Holes in the walls. Can't lock the door. Smells terrible. Graffiti in the rooms. No running water. Not safe! Blood on towels. Felt like a horror movie walking into this room. Told the manager not staying here I want a Refund ASAP! Had to spend the night in my car instead every other hotel was full.

I paid $87.45 to stay in room 124 the night of July 12, 2025, after a long day of driving from northern California. The few positives are that the bedsheets were clean, the air conditioner worked, and there was hot water in the shower. That was all I needed for the few hours I was there.
The room, overall, was not clean or well-maintained. The floor was sticky. Walls and furniture were damaged. Half of the lamps didn't work. Water in the pool was green. There were more birds using it than people.
At around 3:00 a.m. a prostitute knocked on my door to ask if I was lonely and wanted company. I said no thanks. I couldn't get back to sleep. So I just left the key card at the front desk and continued heading east on Interstate 10.
Would not stay there again.

Just dont. Our rooms had no bathroom doors, period, totally removed \[she moved us rooms and they were also GONE\], zero toilet paper in any of the rooms. We had to go back up front for that and wait. And we had to wait for the lady because she kept talking with someone else behind the desk. She would barely attend to us. There were holes through the hotel room.
And there was sketchy activity happening all around. if your not here for a one night stand or something else sketchy-run, dont walk. We were going to check out and just leave but it was too late and it's just us guys so we needed the sleep. Just wanted to advise the ladies and families. Stay somewhere else. 4/21/2025

DO NOT STAY HERE – COMPLETE NIGHTMARE!

DO NOT STAY HERE – COMPLETE NIGHTMARE!
This place is an absolute disgrace. When I checked in, I found out someone had broken into a room and stolen medication, which was bad enough. But when I told the staff I didn’t feel safe and wanted a refund, they flat-out refused and blamed their own maintenance team for “forgetting to close the door.” Let that sink in—they ADMITTED their own negligence but still refused to make it right.
This place clearly doesn’t care about guest safety, security, or basic human decency. If their staff is too incompetent to lock doors, what else are they failing at? Cleaning? Pest control? Who knows what else is going wrong behind the scenes. If you value your belongings, your safety, or even a shred of respect as a paying customer, STAY FAR AWAY.

If I could leave -15 I would!!! Never have I ever been scared that we would be robbed or broken into before!! , firstly, everyone kept coming up to the desk about broken keys, got our keys and decided to check it out first. 1)tried the key but it turned yellow but the door still opened! 2)bullet holes on the door 3) peep hole was GONE and had tissue stuffed in it… and we haven’t even made it in the door!!! 4)dirty room, stickers everywhere, graffiti poorly covered, HOLES in the walls. 5)shower rod was bent and not fixed, 6)lights barely worked 7)floor pieces were shattered 8)stank really bad 9) HLL NO. We checked straight out after 1 minute and met w a super nice couple who had been behind us before. The checked their room and literally said it wasn’t clean and bed want made and seemed people were still in the room. WHAT A JOKE. WISH WISH WISH I took pictures but could not stand another minute in there!!

Do not stay here—it’s a health hazard and should be shut down. Do not book here under any circumstances.This place is a scam and a complete nightmare. The building reeks, the rooms are filthy with human feces, exposed wires, and holes in the beds. I was lucky to see the room before checking in, avoiding a huge mistake. The $75 cancellation fee is absurd for such an uninhabitable place. Do not stay here—it’s a health hazard and should be shut down.

Couldn't give a negative score, so one star had to do. The room had no linens on one of the beds, broken air/heater with an extinguished cigarette under the pieces. Which was right by the door sign saying "" no smoking"". But that's the good part! No TV, no radio, no clock, no phone. Then the toilet was FILLED WITH FECES!! Dried in sides of toilet and rim also. I flushed toilet & it overflowed. Then I found there were no towels, no wash cloths, no soap, no shampoo, no shower curtain. Web site said had continental breakfast. There wasn't coffee, water, anything. Not even a room coffee maker. I've written and complained, but never got response from hotel or corporation.

DO NOT STAY HERE!! SAFETY HAZARD!!!
This was the worst hotel I have ever stayed at. There were people wandering around outside who were clearly under the influence of multiple substances, not to mention the piles of trash laying all over the property. The man who checked us in was sleeping in the back when we arrived and then was extremely rude when we asked to check in. The hotel had overbooked or just didn’t care if you reserved a room ahead of time because the room we originally booked wasn’t available and we were told “sorry that’s not my problem”. When we got to the room that was available it looked as if it were being renovated. One of the two beds was broken, the TV was missing and the wires had been cut and pulled from the wall, there was a hole in the wall, the artwork was missing, tiles in the bathroom were broken and extremely sharp, there were no toiletries or toilet paper, the lock on the door was broken, when I looked through the peephole I could see INTO the room, and the floor sagged when we walked on it. We immediately took our stuff back to the car and went back to the front desk to ask for a different room. The guy at the front desk was extremely rude and told us there was nothing he could do because all the other rooms were either full or hadn’t been cleaned yet because “the housekeeping staff doesn’t do their jobs”. We had seen a couple rooms that were empty on our way back to the front desk and when I asked about them he told me that those rooms had reservations. SO DID WE! I told him at that moment I wanted a refund and after 30min of back and forth we got our money back and left. It was an absolute nightmare.

So I found this place and somehow was tricked, because two hotels are really one. At the time econolodge was rated low and rodeway average. Terrible place. Took 30 minutes to check in. The key did not work. 30 more minutes to get a new key. Did not work. Gave up on a third try because somebody was ODing in the lobby, and a fight broke out in at least two rooms. They also stole my money for a deposit, because I could not return the key that never worked. Worst place ever and basically bad enough I won't even use those chains anymore. 1/5 is too generous.

I’m ashamed to say I payed to have 2 friends stay here and I will requesting a refund from Choice Hotels. Pictures of this property are extremely misleading to any would be traveler! A better description of this unsafe disgrace of a “hotel” would be.
Welcome, to the ugly step child of the Choice Hotels family! Please excuse our closed off mess of a lobby, lack of hospitality management experience, security, lack of commercial or general house keeping practices and vagrant population. Please be courteous and mindful of or trafficking and illicit drug use small businesses within our proud establishment.
Room amenities include black mold, bed bugs, roaches, filthy curtains, questionable bed linens, non functional smoke detectors, questionable black tar like adhesive used to DIY repair our dilapidated flooring planks and non functional TV if one is even installed in your room.
Late check out requests are optional as we will just issue our next guest with a key to the room to find you and your 4 dogs still occupying the space at 7:00 PM when checkout clearly was at 11:00 AM. We will then do a sweep of all the rooms on property praying that we find one vacant with working A/C and cleaned to our slum lord standards.
All Towels are provided upon request and linens deposit

Amazing and friendly staff. Staff was the only good part. Rooms were completely vile. Taped off fire alarms- brown stains covering the sheets-a door that didn't latch- cigarette ash in a non smoking room- nasty floors didn't look like it was cleaned at all- a light fixture hanging from a literal thread on the ceiling- no cover on AC unit- holes all over the blankets- and probably more that I forgot. We moved rooms 3 times before we decided to get a refund and go somewhere else. Definitely do not recommend staying here, I barely made it an hour at that hotel. Literal only good thing was the staff and they were amazing.

This hotel sucks, everything broken, shower head broken and leaking, air conditioner is also broken but they insist it still running, running with warm wind in 120 degrees F, so I checked out my second day of my reservation (still have three days left) , their front desk told me I am all set and they will refund me the rest of my reservation, but they lies. I kept waiting their refund, then they said I was not checking out till the end. They don’t even return my 40 dollars deposit. Really mean hotel, definitely don’t stay at in this horrible hotel in your life. It will harm you physically and mentally

Fun little place! Fun little cockroaches welcomed us to our room. Fun happy people hanging around/sleeping on the stairs. Cool little tube tv to keep you distracted from the nefarious activity outside your door. Surprised they had a mirror in the room! Metal bracing/bracket on the two doors to the rooms we tried to get in to that looked like they'd been kicked in. Interesting feature of the hotel was the copious amounts of trash! Trash on the street, trash in the parking lots, over filled trash cans, bags of trash outside of people rooms! Checked for bed bugs and didn't see any. Woke up with bites and so did my cousin. Maybe I had these bites before and I didn't notice until I woke up. Didn't see any actual needles, just a few caps. The front desk guy was was good and fast. We weren't able to get into the first room, but that could have been user error.
Definitely the worst place I've ever stayed. Can't believe people get charged to stay here. I don't believe I've left a one star review before.

A very dangerous place to stay, there’s roaches, no tv, no mini fridge, clear windows, broken ac, burn marks on the sheets, SKID marks on the bed sheets, cigarette butts everywhere, wall stains, and mold in the shower. Once I arrived there was a fire truck outside, and two people fighting outside my room, very noisy and unsafe. My family and I bought a room to this motel and they gave us the wrong room and told us we cannot change it, mind you, we’re a family of four and they gave us one bed, I do NOT recommend!!!!

Worse place to stay dont go there is not safe
Doors dont lock

# 1974: Orem's Hollow

Orem’s Hollow was a shithole. It wasn't the kind of place you ""came from"", it was the kind of place you survived, like a house fire or a parasitic infection.

By 1974, the town was a corpse that didn't have the decency to stop twitching, the steel mills had mostly shuttered, leaving behind a skyline of rusted skeletons and a permanent smell of sulfur and wet pennies. We lived in the shadow of the ridge, where the trees grew crooked and the river ran the color of iron bile. The sky was usually the color of a fresh bruise, heavy with the soot that drifted down from the stacks like a grey, silent funeral. Everything was coated in it. The cars, the porches, the lungs of the old men coughing their lives out into handkerchiefs. It was a place where hope went to get strangled in an alleyway and left to rot in a storm drain.

My world was seventeen years of a crushing, nauseating secret that felt like a hot coal tucked under my tongue. Every day was a performance. I had to walk right, talk right, and hate the right things. Mostly, I had to pretend I didn't want to crawl inside Vance’s skin. 

I spent every waking second monitoring the tilt of my head, the swing of my arms, the way my eyes lingered a fraction of a second too long on the line of a shoulder or the curve of a neck. It was exhausting. It was a war fought in the quiet spaces between heartbeats. If I slipped once, if I let the mask slide even a millimeter, the town would swallow me whole. 

My father would be the one to dig the hole.

We spent that July at ""The Scab."" It was a half-condemned cooling tower on the edge of the industrial park, a concrete throat choked with scrap metal and discarded tires. We’d sit in there for hours, throwing rocks at rusted oil drums just to hear the hollow, metallic boom echo against the walls. It was the only place that felt honest. The concrete was stained with decades of industrial grease, and the light that filtered down from the jagged hole in the roof was always hazy, filled with dancing motes of ash that looked like tiny, grey insects. 

Vance was perched on a rusted I-beam thirty feet up, silhouetted against the grey-purple haze. He was eighteen, a year older than us, and he moved with a casual, dangerous grace that made my stomach do slow, agonizing flips. He had a lightning-bolt scar that jagged across his left cheek, a gift from his father’s belt buckle. To me, that scar was a bad omen I wanted to trace with my thumb. He had this way of looking at you that made you feel like you were the only person in the world, and then, a second later, like you were just a bug he was thinking about crushing.

""Eli. You look like you’re trying to suck an invisible dick!"" Vance shouted down. His voice had that scratchy, low-end rumble that made my nerves fray. ""Close your mouth before a pigeon shits in it.""

""Go fuck yourself, Vance."" I snapped back. It was the only way I knew how to love him, with insults that tasted like vinegar. I wanted to scream that I hated him, but the lie always felt too heavy in my mouth. I wanted to pull him down from that beam and hold him until my ribs cracked. Instead, I just spat into the dust.

Benny, a kid built like a fire hydrant, let out a bark of a laugh. He was the same age as me, but he had the thick, hairy arms of a middle-aged plumber. He was busy trying to set a dead rat on fire with a magnifying glass, his tongue poking out of the corner of his mouth in concentration. ""He's thinking about that chick from homeroom."" Benny said, squinting as a curl of smoke rose from the rat's tail. ""The one with the...""

""The lazy eye?"" Vance interjected.

""Yeah."" Benny laughed. ""You gonna take her to the quarry, Eli? Give her the Orem’s Hollow Special? Just put a fuckin' bag over her head so you can pretend she isn't repulsed by your faggot face.""

""Shut up, Benny."" I said. ""At least I’m not the one trying to fuck a rodent.""

""It’s an experiment."" Benny said, not looking up. ""I want to see if the fur melts or just burns. Science, you illiterate fuck.""

Toby was fourteen, Benny’s little cousin who’d been dumped on him because his aunt was on another three-day bender. He was the only actual kid in our circle, a small, bird-boned thing with eyes that were always too wide, like he was constantly witnessing a car crash in slow motion. He was sitting on a pile of tires, picking at a scab on his knee, his legs looking like two pale twigs. He was the runt, the communal punching bag we kept around to make ourselves feel like we weren't the bottom of the floor. We loved him in a way that looked exactly like hatred, a desperate, frantic bonding that required a victim to keep the rest of us from turning on each other.

""When are we going to the tower?"" Toby asked, his voice thin and annoying.

""When I say we're going."" Vance said, hopping down from the beam. He landed with a heavy thud that sent a cloud of ash into the air. He walked over to Toby and flicked him hard on the ear. ""There's high-quality bronze in that belfry. Real industrial scrap. We get that out, and we’re set for months. We could buy enough Miller and smokes to rot our lungs twice over. We might even get enough to get the fuck out of here.""

""My dad says that place is cursed..."" Toby whispered, rubbing his red ear.

""Your dad is a drunk who thinks he saw a UFO in a puddle of his own piss."" Benny flicked Toby’s other ear hard. ""It was part of the university before the fire. It’s just old stone and metal. It’s a payday, Toby. Stop being a pussy.""

St. Jude’s was basically just a jagged stone tooth sticking out of the ridge, the only thing that didn't turn to ash when the university folded back in ’58. Most people blamed a bad boiler in the library, but the stories you heard in the alleys were always weirder.

There was this pack of college freaks, the Saints of the Second Hand, who’d spent their nights up in the belfry geeking out over some cracked-out theory that time was a physical weight, like a pile of bricks you had to balance. They totally drank the kool-aid, convinced the town was just a bucket filling up with rot, and that every ten years, you had to dump the bucket or the whole place would choke on its own filth. Now, it was just a soot-stained needle watching us, its clock face stuck like a dead eye that wouldn’t stay shut. 

# The Domestic War

Home was its own kind of shithole. My father, Big John, was a man composed entirely of scar tissue and silence. He’d come back from the Highlands in '69 with a Bronze Star and a phantom weight behind his eyes that never left. He worked the night shift at the one mill still gasping for air, and when he was home, he sat in the dark living room, drinking Miller High Life and staring at the blank television screen like it was a tactical map. He never spoke about the war, but the war spoke through him in every heavy footstep and every sudden, violent movement.

He hated me. 

He didn't know what I was, not for sure, but he smelled the ""softness"" on me like a dog smells fear. To him, I was a logistical error. I was the son who didn't want to hunt, who didn't want to work the line, who spent too much time reading paperbacks and washing the soot off his skin. He wanted a soldier, and he got a mirror he didn't want to look into. Every time he looked at me, I could feel his disappointment like a physical pressure, a heavy hand on the back of my neck forcing me down into the dirt.

""You're going out again?"" He’d rumble, not looking up from the dark. The only light in the room came from the cherry of his cigarette.

""Yeah. Just to the Scab. Hanging with Vance and Benny.""

""Vance."" He spat the name like it was a piece of gristle. ""That kid’s a dead end. You hang with losers, you die in a ditch. But I guess that suits you. You always were a quitter. Just like your mother.""

""I haven't quit anything, Dad.""

""Don't lie to me."" He finally looked at me, his eyes cold and hollow, the thousand-yard stare cutting right through my chest. ""I see how you walk. I see how you look at the floor. You're waiting for someone to give you permission to exist. You're a coward, Eli. You were born one. You think those boys are your friends? They'll eat you the second the lights go out.""

I’d leave the house with my throat tight, feeling like I was vibrating apart. I’d find Vance, and the relief of his casual insults was like a cooling balm. Vance’s house wasn't any better. His mother was a ghost who drifted from the bedroom to the kitchen in a cloud of gin and Virginia Slims, her face a roadmap of bruises that Vance pretended not to see. He never talked about it. He just became the king of the Scab, the only place where he wasn't a victim. He weaponized his trauma, turning his pain into a jagged edge he used to keep the world at bay. He was a bully because he didn't want to be a casualty.

Even Benny had his own hell. His older brothers were giants, three former high-school linebackers who used Benny as a literal football. They’d lock him in the basement for hours, or hold him underwater in the quarry until his lungs nearly burst. Benny’s humor wasn't a gift, it was a survival mechanism. If he was laughing, he wasn't crying. If he was the one hurting Toby, he wasn't the one getting hurt. It was a cycle of misery, a food chain of suffering that we all accepted because we didn't know any other way to live. We were all feeding on each other to keep from starving.

And Toby, he was fourteen but looked nine. He was the one who fell through the cracks of a town that was already a crack. He was the shared punching bag, the communal vessel where we poured all the bile our fathers had forced down our throats. We loved him in a way that looked exactly like hatred, a desperate, frantic bonding that required a victim to keep the rest of us from turning on each other. We’d make him do things, stupid things, like eating cigarette butts or climbing into the old chemical vats, just to see if he’d do it. And he always did, because he wanted to belong more than he wanted to be safe. We were all broken pieces of a machine that had been designed to fail, and the tower was the only thing that seemed to promise a way out.

# The Rituals of the Ruined

Life in Orem's Hollow was a loop of ritualized cruelty. We spent hours at The Silver Gear arcade. We were there to steal quarters and plan the heist. The bronze in the tower was a legend among the local scrappers, but nobody was stupid enough to climb the rot. ""It's high-grade stuff."" Vance said, leaning against a pinball machine. ""The clapper alone is worth fifty bucks. We get that down, we’re kings. We can get a bus ticket out of here. Or at least enough beer to forget we're here. We could head to Pittsburgh. Maybe even further.""

""Hey. Look at the retard!"" Benny shouted, pointing at Toby as he struggled to catch his breath after a ""Toby Tap"", a sharp, two-finger jab to the kidneys that Benny had perfected. Deployed only when Toby had too much fun. Seems like he was running a winning game of Space Invaders. Poor Toby. ""He's doing his fish-out-of-water impression. Give us a kiss, fish-boy! Look at his little face turning purple!""

Vance would just watch, his eyes bored and sharp. Most of the time, he just let the rot fester. He looked at me, his eyes landing on a small bruise on my neck where Big John had grabbed me too hard the night before for forgetting to take the trash out. I could feel Vance's gaze like a burn, a phantom touch that made the skin of my neck prickle. I wanted him to ask again. I wanted him to touch it.

""Your old man give you that?"" Vance asked, his voice low.

""No. I tripped.""

Vance let out a sharp, cynical laugh. ""Sure you did. Everyone in this town 'trips' a lot. My mom tripped over the coffee table yesterday. Lost a tooth. Even the furniture is aggressive in this town."" He leaned in, his face close enough that I could see the flecks of gold in his irises. ""Don't let him break you, Eli. If you break, you're just another piece of junk on the pile. And I don't hang out with junk.""

I felt a surge of something, affection, maybe, or just a desperate, clawing need to be touched by him in a way that wasn't a punch. I wanted him to see me. I wanted him to know that I was the only one who truly understood the darkness behind his eyes. I wanted to tell him that I’d go anywhere with him, as long as it wasn't here. ""I'm not junk."" I whispered.

""Not yet."" Vance said, pulling back. ""But the clock is ticking. We go to the tower tonight. Be ready.""

One Tuesday, we were walking along the river, the water a stagnant, chemical sludge. The factories upstream had been dumping waste into the water for decades, and the surface was covered in a rainbow-slick of oil that looked beautiful if you didn't know it was poison. We found a discarded shopping cart and decided to see how much weight it could take before the wheels buckled.

""Get in, Toby."" Benny commanded.

""No way, Benny. It's all rusty. I'll get lockjaw… Or cancer…""

""Get in the fucking cart or I'll throw you in the river."" Vance said, his voice calm and terrifying. ""I'm not in the mood for an argument, Toby. Get in.""

Toby got in, looking small and miserable in the rusted wire basket. We pushed him down the embankment, the cart screaming as the metal groaned. It hit a rock and flipped, sending Toby sprawling into the oily mud. We laughed until our ribs ached. Toby just sat there, covered in sludge, his face a mask of silent, accepted misery. He didn't even try to wipe the mud off. I felt a flicker of guilt, a sharp needle of shame that I quickly buried under a layer of performative disdain.

""Look at him-"" I said, my voice sounding hollow. ""He looks like a drowned rat.""

""More like a.. A drowned faggot!"" Benny added, throwing a handful of mud at Toby’s head. ""Hey fish-boy! You catch any minnows in there?""

Vance didn't laugh this time. He just stared at Toby, then looked up at the ridge where the tower sat. ""He's pathetic."" Vance whispered. ""That's why he's perfect. The tower loves pathetic things...""

# The Watcher in the Ash

As July bled into August, some weird… Things have begun to start happening. I’d see things out of the corner of my eye, shadows that didn't have any business being there, shapes that moved in a way that defied the wind. Reality seemed to be fraying at the edges, like a worn piece of fabric. I’d be walking down the street and the sound of my footsteps would lag, a split second of silence before the tap of my boot hit the pavement.

One evening, we were hanging out behind the grocery store, trying to talk the delivery guy into buying us a six-pack. The sun was a dull, orange smudge behind the mill smoke, casting long, distorted shadows across the asphalt.

""Look."" Toby said, pointing toward the dumpster.

There was a man standing there. He was wearing a grey suit, the fabric looking thick and heavy despite the heat. He was standing perfectly still, his back to us. He looked like he’d been carved out of the smog itself. There was a stillness about him that was unnatural, as if he wasn't just standing there, but was rooted to the spot.

""Hey, fuckhead!"" Benny yelled. ""You want to buy us some beer? Or are you just jerking off back there?""

The man didn't move. He didn't even seem to breathe.

Vance picked up a glass bottle and shattered it against the brick wall. ""Hey! I'm talking to you! Turn around!""

The man turned. He didn't have a face. It was just a smooth, grey expanse of skin, stretched tight over a skull that didn't have any openings. No eyes, no nose, no mouth. Just an empty, oval slate. It was a void where a human being should have been.

We froze. My heart was thumping so hard I thought it would crack a rib. My breath caught in my throat, a cold, hard lump of terror. Then, the man blinked. He didn't have eyes, but I felt the blink, a sudden, jarring shift in the air, like the sound of a heavy door slamming shut in a vacuum. When the air settled, he was gone. He didn't run. He just wasn't there anymore.

""Where'd he go?"" Toby whined, his voice reaching a fever pitch. ""Vance? Where'd he go?""

""Shut up, Toby!"" Vance yelled, though his own face was ashen. ""He just. He went around the corner. That's all. Some weirdo in a mask. Probably one of those cult freaks.""

""It wasn't a mask, Vance."" I whispered. ""You saw it. There were no holes. There was nothing.""

Vance didn't answer. He just lit a cigarette with shaking hands, the flame of his Zippo a tiny, defiant spark in the encroaching dark. Click-clack, hiss. We didn't talk about the faceless man again, but we all felt him. He was the shadow at the edge of our vision, the silent observer of our slow-motion destruction. He was the harvest man, waiting for the crop to ripen.

# The Ascent into the Nightmare

Old St. Jude’s stood on the ridge like a jagged tooth. We broke the padlock with a rusted crowbar Vance had swiped from his dad's tool shed. The door groaned open, revealing a darkness so thick it felt like something you had to swim through. The smell of the place hit us instantly, a mixture of ancient dust, pigeon rot, and a metallic tang that made my teeth ache. It felt like walking into the belly of a dead animal.

The ground floor was a graveyard of machinery. Massive iron gears, some as tall as a man, lay half-buried in the dust like the bones of prehistoric gods. They were covered in a layer of grime that looked like old skin. ""Check the gears."" Vance said, his voice echoing in the hollow space. ""Any bronze we can pry off, take it. This is the payday, boys. Don't touch the iron. It's worthless.""

The climb was a slow-motion nightmare. The wooden stairs were soft with rot, yielding under our boots with a sickening, wet crunch. Every step was a gamble. We moved in single file, Vance leading the way, then me, then Benny, with Toby bringing up the rear, his whimpers a constant, irritating soundtrack to our ascent.

""Shut up, Toby."" I hissed, my heart hammering against my ribs. ""If you piss yourself, I'm throwing you over the rail. We're here for the scrap. Just focus on the scrap. Think about the money.""

We reached the first landing. The floor was covered in a thick layer of grey pigeon droppings and what looked like human hair, matted together in clumps. In the corner, a massive iron weight hung from a frayed cable, swaying slightly in a wind that shouldn't have been there. It moved with a slow, hypnotic rhythm that made my head swim.

""You guys hear that?"" Toby asked.

Tick. Tick. Tick.

It wasn't coming from the clock. It was coming from inside the stone itself, a rhythmic, mechanical grinding that felt like it was happening inside my own skull. It was the sound of the tower breathing.

""It's just the wind, you pussy."" Vance said, but his hand was white as he gripped the railing.

We reached the main gear chamber, three-quarters of the way up. The air was freezing, smelling of wet earth and copper. Benny stepped onto a plank to get a better look at a bronze gear mount that looked like it could be pried loose. The whole structure groaned, a deep, resonant sound that felt like it was coming from the center of the earth.

""Benny, wait-"" I started.

CRA-A-ACK.

The sound was like a gunshot. The oak plank vanished, turning to dust in an instant. Benny’s left leg plunged through the hole.

""FUUUUCK!"" Benny screamed. He tried to pull himself up, but a jagged, five-inch splinter of fossilized oak drove straight through his thigh, pinning him like a specimen in a jar.

I saw the blood immediately. It didn't look red, in the dim light, it looked black as oil. It sprayed against the rusted gears, a rhythmic, pulsing fountain. It had a sharp, metallic smell that made my stomach churn.

""Help me! Vance! Eli! It's in me! Get it out! Oh god it's so deep!""

Benny grabbed the edge of the hole, his fingers digging into the rotted wood until his nails bled. He pulled, and the sound of the splinter tearing through his muscle was like a wet rag being ripped. Vance reached for him, but the vibration of Benny’s struggle was the final straw. The massive iron drive gear, a monster of pitted steel, groaned as its rusted support chain finally snapped.

""Get back!"" I yelled, grabbing Toby and shoving him toward the stairs.

The gear didn't fall fast. It slid off its mount with a slow, grinding mechanical groan. Benny looked up, his face a mask of pure, unadulterated terror. He tried to roll, to scream, to do anything, but he was trapped. The gear came down.

It hit Benny’s neck first. There was no clean cut. The jagged teeth ground into his throat, pulverizing the trachea and the bone. I heard the sound, a wet, muffled crunch followed by a final, bloody hiss as the last of his breath escaped. His eyes bulged, the vessels bursting until they were twin orbs of red, staring at nothing. The gear continued its descent, crushing his chest into the oak joist below. I watched his ribs snap, the bone shards piercing his lungs. A thick slurry of bile and blood erupted from his mouth, drenching the gears below. Benny’s body gave one violent, spasming kick, and then he was still. His blood began to flow into the teeth of the Great Second Hand, a dark, viscous lubricant for the machine.

""Benny?"" Toby whispered. He was shaking so hard he was vibrating. A dark stain spread across the front of his jeans. He looked at the remains of his cousin and something in him simply broke. His eyes went flat, vacant.

Vance stood there, splattered with Benny’s blood. He didn't look sad. He looked possessed. ""He's dead."" Vance said, his voice flat and cold. ""He's fucking dead. We have to go. The bronze is higher up. We're not leaving with nothing. We NEED the money, Eli. We need to get out of this shithole- It- It was his fault for being clumsy.""

""Are you serious?!"" I yelled. ""Benny just got turned into hamburger! We have to go back! We have to get help!""

""The bronze, Eli! We need the money!"" Vance’s eyes were wild, blown out with shock. He wasn't thinking about Benny. He was thinking about the scrap. He was thinking about the escape. He grabbed me by the shoulders and shook me. ""We're almost there! Think about the life we could have!""

We scrambled for the upper ladder. Toby was blind with tears, his movements clumsy and panicked. We reached the bell chamber, a massive, vaulted space dominated by a three-ton bronze bell that seemed to hum with a low-frequency vibration. It was beautiful and terrible, its surface covered in a green patina of age.

""The clapper."" Vance pointed, his voice trembling. ""That's the payday. That thing is solid bronze. We get that, and we never have to look at this town again. We can buy a car, Eli. We can just drive.""

The clapper was a massive ball hanging by a rusted rod. I scrambled up the ladder toward the roof hatch, my fingers slipping on the cold iron. I just wanted to be away from the blood. I just wanted to be in the air. I could hear the wind howling outside, a sound like a thousand voices.

Vance was halfway up when Toby, in a state of pure, animal panic, tried to push past him. Toby’s foot caught on the crumbling masonry of the bell housing.

""Help! Don't leave me!"" Toby cried, reaching for Vance’s leg. His small hands were shaking, his face a ruin of tears and snot. He was just a kid, and we had brought him to an abattoir.

Vance looked at Toby. I saw it then, the raw, naked cowardice that lived at the center of his charisma. He didn't reach for Toby. He didn't try to pull him up. He looked at the fourteen-year-old boy with a disgust so profound it was more violent than any punch. He saw Toby as a weight, a burden, a thing that was keeping him from his bronze. He saw him as a sacrifice.

Vance kicked out. Hard.

His heavy boot caught Toby in the center of his chest. I heard the thud of the impact, the sound of the air being forced out of the boy's lungs. Toby fell backward. He didn't hit the floor. He fell directly into the hollow, dark mouth of the great bronze bell.

At that exact second, the gears below completed their rotation, fueled by the blood we had already provided. The clock struck twelve. The mechanism released the tension on the clapper rod.

The iron ball swung with the force of a wrecking ball. Toby was still trying to scramble out, his small hands gripping the cold rim of the bell. The clapper caught him directly in the small of the back.

There was no chime. There was only a dull, wet thud, followed by the sound of Toby’s spine shattering like a bag of dry kindling. His body was folded in half, his head meeting his heels in a grotesque, impossible arc. His internal organs were pulverized against the bronze interior, a spray of pink mist erupting from the bottom of the bell. He didn't even have time to scream. He was just. Gone. Folded into the music of the tower. His blood rained down on the gears below, a final offering.

Vance scrambled onto the roof, gasping for air. He didn't look back. He didn't even acknowledge that he’d just murdered his friend's cousin. He just looked at his hands and wiped them on his jeans. But the roof wasn't the end. There was a higher platform, accessible by a final stone spiral that felt like it was made of teeth, crowned by an open-air turret that looked out over the entire valley.

""The scrap-"" Vance wheezed, his eyes darting around. ""It's all at the top. The university kids, they hidden it up there. They were smart. They knew what was coming.""

# The Harvest

We reached the summit. The town below was a sea of grey and black, the ridge a dark spine cutting through the valley. There was no more scrap. No bronze, no clappers, no payday. In the center of the turret sat a massive Sundial, its base carved from the same black stone as the ridge. It looked like it had grown out of the ground, a parasitic growth of the earth itself. The gnomon wasn't metal, it was a curved, jagged sliver of polished ivory, or maybe bone, reaching five feet into the air. It was covered in carvings that looked like they were moving, a writhing mass of shapes that defied the eye.

The sun was down, the world below us shrouded in shadow, but the Sundial was casting a shadow. A shadow that didn't come from any light. It was a physical rip in the air, a sliver of void that moved with a slow, grinding mechanical precision. It hummed with a sound that made my teeth vibrate in their sockets. It was the sound of forever.

""What is this?"" Vance whispered, walking toward it. His face was pale, his eyes wide with a strange, religious awe. ""Where’s the bronze? Where’s the money? We did all this for nothing?""

""Vance. Get away from it-"" I said. My voice was trembling. The air was humming, a low-frequency vibration that made my nose bleed. I could feel the tower swaying, a slow, nauseating oscillation that felt like it was trying to shake us off. The very stone seemed to be pulsing under my feet.

Vance reached out his hand. He was looking for a payday, for an escape, for a way to be the king again. He was looking for anything that wasn't Orem's Hollow. He was looking for a god he could understand. His fingers brushed the ivory gnomon.

The shadow didn't move. It reached out.

The black sliver of void jumped from the stone and latched onto Vance’s arm. He didn't scream. He just stiffened, his eyes turning into empty, white pits that reflected nothing. The shadow began to flow into him, a dark, viscous liquid that pulsed under his skin like a nest of snakes. It was a harvest, and Vance was the crop. He was being hollowed out, filled with the cold, mechanical logic of the tower.

""Eli..."" Vance said. His voice was no longer human. It was the sound of gears grinding in a vacuum, the sound of ten thousand years of ticking. ""-The cycle is whole. We are the second hand...""

His body began to stretch, the bones snapping and resetting with the sound of breaking glass. His skin turned a bruised, metallic grey, the texture of cold slag. His face began to smooth over, the lightning-bolt scar becoming a jagged, glowing rift of shadow that pulsed with a rhythmic, sickly light. He wasn't Vance anymore. He was the shadow. He was the Watcher we had seen by the dumpster. He was the demon of the tower, a creature forged from time and regret. He was the saint they had all been waiting for.

He turned toward me, his movements jerky, a frame-rate lag in reality itself. He was ancient and hungry, a predator that lived in the gaps between seconds.

""Run, Eli."" The thing said, the words echoing in my mind instead of my ears. It was a command.

I ran. I flew down the stairs, tripping over the rot, ignoring the blood of Benny that still slicked the floorboards. I didn't care about the scrap. I didn't care about the money. I burst out of the tower and didn't stop until I hit the river, my lungs screaming for air that wasn't poisoned by the tower. I stood in the oily mud, gasping, watching the ridge. The clock face had moved. It was one second past midnight.

""We weren't here..."" I whispered to the dark, my voice shaking. ""We weren't here. It never happened.""

# 1984: The Opening Door

I lived in Chicago now. I worked as a data entry clerk for an insurance company, a job that required nothing but the ability to sit still and disappear. My life was a series of white walls, microwave dinners, and a silence so profound it felt like a deafness. I had forgotten Orem’s Hollow. I had buried the tower, the scrap, the bronze, and the blood under a decade of repression. I told myself it was a dream. A collective hallucination of a dying town. I’d even convinced myself that Benny and Toby had just run away, that they were out there somewhere, living better lives. I had built a shell of normalcy, a life of zero consequences. I kept my head down. I never looked at mirrors for too long.

I was sitting in my office, working late on a Tuesday. The building was empty, the only sound the hum of the air conditioning and the distant siren of an ambulance. The fluorescent lights flickered overhead, a rhythmic pulse that felt familiar in a way that made my skin crawl. One-two, pause. One-two, pause.

I reached for my coffee, my eyes fixed on the computer screen. My hand moved. In the reflection of the darkened window, the hand stayed on the desk.

My heart stopped. 

Suddenly, I heard a sound from the hallway. A sound I hadn't heard in ten years.

Click-clack.

The sound of a Zippo lighter being flicked open.

Hiss.

The smell of Marlboros and motor oil drifted into the room, thick and cloying. It was the smell of The Scab. It was the smell of my youth. It was the smell of the harvest. I could hear the sound of heavy metal dragging against the carpet, the sound of gears grinding behind the drywall.

The door to my office began to open, slowly, with a heavy, mechanical groan that sounded like a gear shifting. The lights in the office didn't just flicker; they died, leaving only the sickly orange glow from the hallway.

I stared at the gap, my heart hammering against my ribs, a cold sweat breaking out across my forehead. I saw a hand grip the edge of the door, a hand with skin like bruised metal, the fingers long and tapering into jagged points. The lightning-bolt scar on the hand was glowing, a jagged rift of pulsing black light.

""Hey, Eli…"" The voice whispered. It was Vance, but his voice was a thousand voices, a choir of the dead ringing inside my skull. ""...We've got work to do. The second hand is moving again. It's time to pay the interest. You didn't think survival was free, did you?""

The door swung wide, and the shadow began to spill into the room, a black, viscous liquid that devoured the light. It wasn't just a shadow. It was a mass of gears and bone, and in the center of the darkness, I saw the ivory sundial, growing out of my office floor. The gnomon was pointed at my heart.

""Welcome home, Saint..."" Vance whispered, and the ticking became a scream.

1qbh98o,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialBlueprint/comments/1qbh98o/how_to_know_if_youre_emotionally_exhausting_and/,How to Know If You're EMOTIONALLY EXHAUSTING (And What to Do About It): The Psychology Behind It,"okay so i was talking to my therapist last month and she casually mentioned that i might be ""emotionally draining"" to certain people in my life. honestly? gut punch. i had NO idea. turns out a lot of us are walking around completely clueless about how we affect people's energy. 



after that conversation i went down a research rabbit hole through psychology podcasts, books, and talked to people who study social dynamics for a living. what i found was pretty eye opening. the stuff i'm sharing isn't just recycled advice, it's legit insights from experts who understand human behavior way better than i do.



here's what i learned about the signs you might be exhausting people (even if you have good intentions) and more importantly, how to fix it:



1. you always need to be the main character in every conversation



this one hit different. if someone mentions their promotion and within 30 seconds you're talking about YOUR career struggles, that's a problem. psychologist Dr. Harriet Lerner calls this ""conversational narcissism"" in her work, and it's more common than we think. people aren't trying to be selfish, they just haven't learned to sit with someone else's moment without making it about themselves.



the fix: practice the 3 question rule before talking about yourself. ask three genuine followup questions about what they shared. ""how did you feel when that happened?"" ""what made you decide that?"" ""what's next for you?"" then if they ask about you, share. but let them lead.



2. you treat people like your personal therapist



venting is normal. using your friends as free therapy sessions without asking first? that's different. there's actually research on this, emotional dumping activates the same stress response in listeners as if they were experiencing the trauma themselves. Dr. Pooja Lakshmin talks about this in her book ""Real Self Care"" (not the bubble bath BS kind of self care). she's a psychiatrist who breaks down why we need to stop outsourcing our emotional regulation to friends and romantic partners.



genuinely one of the most important books i've read on boundaries and mental health. it challenges everything you think you know about taking care of yourself. changed how i approach relationships completely.



try the app Youper for when you need to process thoughts but don't want to dump on friends. it's an AI therapy assistant that helps you work through stuff using CBT techniques. sounds weird but it's actually solid for organizing messy thoughts before you spiral text someone at 2am.



3. you never have good news to share



if every single interaction is you complaining, people will start avoiding you. harsh but true. negativity is actually contagious on a neurological level. there's mirror neuron research showing that our brains literally sync up with the emotional states of people around us. 



this doesn't mean fake positivity or suppressing real struggles. it means balancing the heavy stuff with literally anything else. hobbies, funny observations, questions about their life, random interesting shit you learned. 



start a ""good thing"" note on your phone. every day write down one neutral to positive thing that happened. didn't get fired. coffee was decent. dog did something cute. whatever. reference this when talking to people so you're not ONLY bringing problems.



4. you can't sit with silence or other people's emotions



someone tells you something vulnerable and you immediately jump to advice, minimizing their feelings, or changing the subject because you're uncomfortable. that's exhausting for them because they have to manage both their emotions AND yours.



the book ""There Is No Good Card for This"" by Kelsey Crowe and Emily McDowell is INSANELY good for learning how to show up for people during hard times. it's written by a grief specialist and the woman who created empathy cards. teaches you what to actually say when someone's going through it (hint: not ""everything happens for a reason"").



practice literally just saying ""that sounds really hard"" or ""i'm sorry you're dealing with that"" and then shutting up. sit in the discomfort. they don't need you to fix it, they need you to witness it.



5. your problems are always more urgent than everyone else's



you interrupt people's stories to insert your own. you send multiple crisis texts demanding immediate responses. you get upset when people can't drop everything for you but you're somehow never available when they need support.



this often comes from anxiety or genuine distress, not malice. but it still depletes people. the podcast ""Where Should We Begin"" with Esther Perel has incredible episodes on relationship dynamics and why some people become ""emotional black holes"" as she calls it. she's a couples therapist who gets into the psychology of why we do this stuff.



There's also BeFreed, an AI-powered learning app built by Columbia alumni that pulls from expert talks, research papers, and books to create personalized audio content. You type in what you're struggling with, like ""why do I exhaust people emotionally,"" and it generates a custom podcast with adaptive learning plans based on your specific situation. The depth is adjustable too, from a quick 10-minute overview to a 40-minute deep dive with real examples. It's been solid for understanding relationship patterns and communication strategies without having to hunt through dozens of books.



before sending that urgent text, ask yourself: is this actually an emergency or does it just FEEL like one right now? can this wait 3 hours? if yes, sit with it. use that time to journal or go for a walk. most ""emergencies"" dissolve with a little time and space.



6. you never ask people about themselves



when's the last time you initiated a conversation by asking how someone's doing and actually listening to the answer? not just waiting for your turn to talk? if you can't remember, that's your sign.



people notice when you only reach out because you need something. they notice when you never remember what's going on in their lives. it makes them feel like props in your story instead of full humans with their own complex experiences.



set reminders to check in with people. sounds mechanical but it works until it becomes habit. ""hey thinking of you, how'd that thing go?"" reference specific stuff they've told you. people feel seen when you remember details about their lives.



the truth is most of us aren't trying to drain people. we're just caught up in our own heads, dealing with our own shit, operating on autopilot. society doesn't exactly teach us how to have healthy reciprocal relationships. we're overstimulated, anxious, and genuinely struggling.



but the people in your life are also overstimulated, anxious, and struggling. they just might be better at hiding it or managing it differently. relationships require energy investment from both sides. if you're constantly withdrawing without depositing anything back, eventually that account runs dry.



none of this means you're a bad person. it means you're human and you have some patterns to unlearn. the fact that you're reading this means you're self aware enough to want to change, which is literally the hardest part.



start small. pick one thing from this list and work on it for a week. notice how people respond differently when you show up with more awareness. it's not about being perfect, it's about being intentional with how you take up space in other people's lives.",1,1768276900.0,SocialBlueprint,0,1.0,False
1qbh8pc,https://www.reddit.com/r/IVF/comments/1qbh8pc/2_failed_fet_transfers_what_now/,2 failed FET transfers what now?,"Hello! I have been in the infertility world for almost 4 years now. I was with RMA first with IVF and got 2 embryos. I had one pregnancy that ended in a missed miscarriage and a failed transfer with RMA. They told me my husband’s sperm was poor quality and that’s why they may have not worked out and told us to see a urologist (meanwhile we already saw 2 urologists who couldn’t explain why it was poor quality). We switched clinics and urologists in which we see Mainline fertility now. My husband ended up needing surgery because the 4th urologist we saw said he had a varicocelle. After that, things were better. We did the pregmune testing evaluation. Turns out I have elevated PA1-1 which I took aspirin and lovenox to help prevent clotting; my immune response has a low tolerance to my embryos due to HLA-mismatch, high IGA antibodies and fetal HLA-C and Maternal KIR interaction which I was taking neupogen injections and prednisone to suppress my immune system. 

So the first transfer with RMA I use the previous meds plus PIO IM and suppositories and estrace three times a day along with supplements and acupuncture. It happened after Thanksgiving and we ended with a failed transfer. 

The second time my doctor wanted me to do a mini STIM embryo transfer with progesterone suppositories twice a day along with supplements and acupuncture. Mind you, I was eating the pineapple, pomegranate juice, decaf coffee, low sugar (which forgot to mention I have slight PCOS and stage 1 endometriosis which I took Aygestin instead of Lupron for 6 weeks and my doctor said it lasts up to 3 months of supressing endometriosis and on 2g metformin), high protein, limited activity for 3 days. It all ended with a negative test. He told me each time I did everything right and I didn’t do anything wrong. 

Now my doctor wants us to come in for a consultation. Does anyone have any experiences with this? What questions do I ask at the consultation? I just don’t understand why this is not happening for me and my husband. We are extremely devastated and exhausted but we don’t want to give up on our dream.

1qbh4ep,https://www.reddit.com/r/exorthodox/comments/1qbh4ep/exmormon_catechumen_having_second_thoughts/,Exmormon Catechumen having second thoughts,"Here is a little about me:

I recently left the Mormon Church (born, raised and married in, wife supports me in leaving). I left over historical issues and doctrinal inconsistencies. If you want more you can prolly see my posts in the r/exmormon sub. Anyway, the town we live in while going to school has both an orthodox and catholic church.

On Good Friday last year i was headed home during my huge Mormon faith crisis and decided to go into the orthodox church just to see. I was so overwhelmed and broke down over how beautiful and filling it seemed. Over the next few months i left the LDS church, started to attend Liturgy and fell in love with the church. I had always had orthodoxy on my radar, and knew that it would either be catholic or orthodox in the end. I wanted history and connection to the apostles. Mormonism teaches ""apostolic succession"" but from the resurrected bodies of Peter James And John and John the Baptists that gave Joseph Smith the priesthood after they died. However, I never understood why Jesus would establish his church, remove it (LDS great apostasy) just to reinstate it. Anyway, I made friends for the first time in 2 years since moving away from home, many who were also exmo and we could bond over a shared experience. I have even asked one to be my baptism sponsor. We are very close and I love him as a brother and vice versa.

I have become a Catechumen and sadly came through the Dyer pipeline. I really liked his arguments and rebuttals, love the deepness of theology that is just lacking in Mormonism.

HOWEVER....

I have some worries as I've now started looking at the orthodox issues and catholic apologetics.

1. The churches are self governing. There is no ""One Church"". No councils since the schism. This is good or bad depending on what you want. Russia hates Ukraine, Ukraine hates Russia, Everyone seems to hate Bartholomew, etc. (I know I'm not a cradle, and anything i get wrong or oversimplify please take easy on me and let me know where I'm wrong). Im sure most here are familiar with this issue. One bishop may teach one thing, another something different. Some theology isn't standard. Do toll houses exist in literal or metaphorical? Who must be rebaptized or just christmated (discussed in ""muh councils"" btw).
2. As a Mormon, the concept of continuing revelation and new teachings is great, but has its logical issues when examined. While ""muh traditions"" is great, its starting to seem more like the pharisees that anything. ""This father says this"" ""We are the ANCIENT church"" ""This is how the early Christians worshipped"" etc etc. Is it really that good that NOTHING changes (or at least they claim nothing changes). Like, the while reason that the councils existed is for controversy (or so im told), and SOOO Much has happened since 787. The Reformation is a big one. Like, even though Catholics have inconsistencies with ""Papal Infallibility"", at least they have clarified as the world moves and theological debates occur. Debates help to clarify doctrine. Like, orthodoxy seems to be stuck with these ideas frmo 1000+ years ago and have to create crazy philosophical mid games to make it sometimes work.
3. I know this is just cause I live in a small Idaho college town, but there's a real lack of church life. Maybe this is a regional thing. Im sure in Greece its diffrent. Liturgy on Sunday and occasional feast day, catechumen class and that's it. Also, they rush you out of the church after liturgy so they can lock it up. The catholic churche ive been to here have more weekday masses, and have let me stay for HOURS after a mass to sit and cry and be at peace. Ive been let in to sit and pray when no one else is there. The openness of the catholic church is something ive always admired. Even when i was on vacation and went to catholic cathedral, they were cleaning and told me ""this is everyone's house, of course you can come in"".
4. The sanctuary. I get its based of the OT temples, but I don't like not being able to see the priest bless the eucharist or not see the cross. The Catholic mass i can sit anywhere and see my Lord on the cross and see this sacrament prepared. I have been to the catholic church, gotten on the stage and wept at the foot of the cross in prayer. Later after a mass I told the priest in tears that i stepped up and he held me and wiped away my tears and said it was ok. My priest glares at someone who disagrees on the stupidest of non theological issues. (How much sugar in coffee to name one). I cant do that in the Sanctuary. There is the division and separation that i must have permission from my priest to even enter, then i cant walk a certain way Infront of the table.
5. My priest. He's old and a native Greek. He is always saying things like ""We are the TRUE church"" ""We don't serve lattes"" (but greek coffee is different?) He's very ego centrical and since he's old and his memory is going, its always the same conversations. He always is going after Mormons, which has really turned my wife off and me as well. I understand that it may be a generational thing, but sometimes I just dont want to hear more about how old the church is and how this is the ancient faith.
6. The arguments and inconsistencies. ""Well, this father said this, and only read these writings not these, we only support these that fit OUR theology and ignore all western fathers."" we decide what is and isn't true based on our teachings. The crazy philosophical essence energies that are so mystical we can never know but its so technical and the type of Dyer-ism philosophical so complex no one can debate type stuff. Like, i know online orthodoxy isnt good, but i can never get a clear answer on anything. and the fathers contradict and the selective council usage gets old. Orthodoxy will say that Rome cant argue ""an argument of silence"" (papal supremacy and infallibility wasn't discussed therefore it doesn't exist in the ancient church) but then say that Florence isn't binding cause one bishop said no? I hope this is making sence. It just sometimes feels so esoteric and mystical that the mystery is more important than actually debating the arguments. Would the church have accepted the filioque if it was presented at a council not just added without? the fathers are inconstant on how the sprit proceeds. like, the economy of the relation between the person of the father and person of the son and the eternal procession of the spirit from the father through the son that then energetically descends upon the philosophical.... you get the point.
7. overall, even if Rome has inconstancies, at least they are ONE church (for the most part). They allow for development of doctrine as new issues arise (just like the councils). I also know that this method is more familiar to me based on the LDS top-down structure. They have clear teachings on what is what and a final answer. Orthodoxy is like ""this parish website says this, bit then this bishop in 1678 said this, but then the patriarch has mentioned this"" like, can i just get an answer please? The filioque also makes sense based on scripture. I can say ""Rome says \_\_\_\_\_. OK, theres my answer"".
8. Overall fruits. both have bad bishops and priests and leadership. But where is the orthodox hospitals, schools, donations to poor via charities, housing, etc. Orthodox bishops are excommunicating each other left and right yet never talk it out it seems. or one wont accept the other. Orthodoxy also seems super showy and over exhaterated. I know it depends on people, but just the ""Oh look at me with my prayer rope and deep bows and prostrations in church and my holiness"" like dude.

idk, there is a lot that i like as well. the reverence, the aesthetic, the incense, but im slowly coming to this realization.

Everything orthodoxy has, Catholics also have. Eastern rite, and even just by pre schism rule. But i also understand the Mass, I can get a solid answer. Any church in the world i can go to and receive communion without worrying about the politics and inner disagreements between bishops. I also know that dreams aren't supposed to be really taken into account, but have been having dreams of Catholicism, dreams where ive met the pope, in my dream agree with the filioque, and even have had the perfect argument that makes me believe the papacy in my dreams. Now there's a lot in Catholicism that makes me hesitant, but im willing to overlook contradictions because of unity.

anyway, Im sure you all understand my frustrations. Its making me reconsider orthodoxy for Catholicism now that im actually looking at the catholic/ general arguments against orthodoxy. My wife also feels more comfortable in the Novus Ordo mass and likes the priests more and said she could maybe see herself converting in time. Big maybe and im not forcing anything on her.

Anyway thanks if you read this far. If you have any questions about Mormonism feel free to ask, and thank you again if you read all that. I just needed to get it off my chest.

  
Edit: also, just the cannons. If i dont venerate icons, im dammed? Anyone outside orthodoxy isnt saved? I have family that wont ever be orthodox. At least the catholic church has some new teachings that make me feel better about those outside the roman communion. I have my own concerns about some of the salvation in Catholicism but i need to do actual research and not just obey every word dyer says. The verneration of every single skin flake and hair of saints and holy people that just seems to be too much. Like yes, its great to have actual items like a musem of history, but if i dont venerate them im anathema?",2,1768276523.0,exorthodox,2,1.0,False

The AI bubble is not going to burst anytime soon, each day I see more similarities between AI Bubble and .com bubble. 
Is the market overvalued? Most Probably Yes
Will it crash? NO, It will correct itself but a total dip isn't gonna happen.
The people who are refusing to jump on the ai bandwagon are essentially lagging behind.
And I am seeing this happen more and more in women compared to men. 
Women are inherently more ethical hence the hesitation with using ai. And people might say that nothing wrong with standing by your morals, but is it worth lagging behind and shaping a more patriarchal society. 
Operating LLLMs, prompt engineering and AI in general  is going to be a very essential skill soon. 

HERE’S THE IMPORTANT PART👇 

While saying all this I am still opposed to using ai for trivial purposes.
When I say AI skills I do not mean generating your picture with Gemini or asking chat GPT why your breath smells of coffee after having an espresso.

Ai is still using a lot of precious resources, a lot of which is also used in such trivial search queries.
It is still harming our environment.
BUT.......
It is not going anywhere, anytime soon. Think of it like petrol, for 100+ years it's fking up earth, people have protested for years, people have made million, countries captured over it. But it went nowhere, people continue to use it. Yes slowly we are moving away from it but it's still not going anywhere for the next 50-70 years. 
Same goes for ai, it's here to stay.

I never hit phase two, only prodromal. I smoked for a year daily, then the prodromal happened. I was lucky to have the right resources. 

This is what helped me quit then (i am an on/off smoker now, havent developed prodromal since)

First two weeks:
Do NOT quit cold turkey. First day cut your consumption by half. Second and third day only do 25% of the normal. Then stop. 
Take vitamin B complex, COQ10, and cortisol balancing pills (you can get this over the counter) 1 hour before the morning nausea usually hits. 
Take .50 mg of xanax in the morning, as soon as the nausea or pain hits. 
If you arent immediately knocked out, go for a walk outside enough to get your heart rate up. Cold air helps best. 
Do NOT drink plain water before eating. Drink things with electrolytes or a herbal tea. Mint and ginger help with nausea. 
Dont stress about not eating, it will come. 
Ondesterone for nausea

Week 3-5
Stop taking the xanax, now only take meletonin before bed. Make sure your sleeping schedule is on track. 
Take a walk in the morning every day, exercise as much as comfortable at night. 
Implement a strict 3 meal a day schedule (does not need to be a full meal each time, do not force yourself. Tofu, pasta, bananas, no coffee or chocolate. You can snack on protien bars or small things throughout the day, avoid too many sweets. 
Continue taking vitamins, continue drinking electrolytes. Do NOT drink alcohol or consume too much dairy, coffee, chocolate. Lentils are great. 

Week 5-16: 
Roll joints and keep them in the room. Stare them down and tell yourself, you do NOT need this, you feel better without. 
Be as healthy as you can during this period. After that, you are free ❤️",1,1768275862.0,CHSrecovery,0,1.0,False

(English isn’t my first language sorry if my grammar isn’t phenomenal)

My bad breath story started when I was a kid since around age 9, I didn’t brush my teeth often (bad oral microbiome since a kid), ate junk food, binge ate, wasn’t physically active, kind of sat around all day playing video games and watching cartoons you know… like a kid. I was extremely overweight weighing around 135 lb at around 9 years old, this is what I believe was the catalyst for my bad breath. I started getting reaction from people around 4th grade, classical “did you brush your teeth?” “What’s that smell?” “Are you SURE you brushed your teeth?” We’re all too familiar with getting, but it wasn’t THAT bad I still had a normal childhood until middle school. 7th grade I gained even more weight I was weighing 230 lb from being even MORE sedentary and binge eating like never before, this worsened my bad breath to the point I had room filling putrid bad breath. 7th grade to 9th grade was a blur, I felt like a nuisance just being alive, having to torture people just by my… existence :( The bullying and torment I experienced through those years are something I would never EVER want ANYONE to experience not even the people who tormented me. At this point I tried using hydrogen peroxide as mouth wash (bad idea), using a tips to clean out my tonsils (bad idea), flossing up to 5x a day, Thera breath, smart mouth, tongue scrapers, mints, gums, NOTHING WORKED. One day I got so sick and tired I took a hair pin and dug inside my tonsils until they spewed blood and got infected so I had to go to a ent, I told the ent everything while he covered his nose, he prescribed me some antibiotics and told me to come back a couple weeks later, I came back still with bad breath and in the doctors office my mother broke down in tears telling the doctor how this was ruining my life, by the grace of god my ent was an angel and scheduled a tonsillectomy. Skip forward a couple months and I had my tonsillectomy the nurses and surgeon told my mother I had one of the most inflamed biggest tonsils they had ever seen, skip forward some more and I WAS CURED…. Or so I thought. The tonsillectomy cured my room filling bad breath and my nasal bad breath but I still had poop sewage breath when I spoke, I thought to my self “am I cursed?” “Why did god choose ME to go through this” “is life even worth living?”. This lead me to a deep depression for years searching through forum after forum to find a cure. I tried using Castile soap to clean my mouth (actually kind of helped but is HORRIBLE for the oral microbiome so I only used it for special occasions ), oral probiotics (I did see a minor difference and fixed my oral microbiome after using this for months), oil of oregano (made my breath fucking toxic), biofilm disruptors, chlorophyll, eating parsley, going carnivore, pretty much everything you can think or anything that has been said on this sub. I decided my last attempt of a cure was going to be going to a gi to see if I have h pylori or sibo, tested negative to h pylori BUT the doctor said my symptoms sound like a reflux condition so he scheduled a endoscopy and 24 hour impedance ph test. It was lpr (silent reflux) all along, I got prescribed a ppi but didn’t see any difference so I decided to use chat gpt to help me manage it, this is the protocol it gave me:

⸻

LPR BAD BREATH PROTOCOL

(Explained Simply, Safely, and Correctly)

First: what’s actually causing the bad breath?

Most people think bad breath comes from:

•	Dirty teeth

•	Tongue bacteria

•	The stomach itself

LPR bad breath is different.

⸻

THE REAL CAUSE: PEPSIN IN THE THROAT

What is pepsin?

Pepsin is a digestive enzyme made in the stomach.

Its job is to break down protein.

The problem

In LPR (laryngopharyngeal reflux):

•	Stomach contents don’t just come up as liquid acid

•	They come up as gas + aerosolized enzymes

•	Pepsin travels upward and lands in:

•	Throat

•	Voice box

•	Back of tongue

•	Sinuses

•	Nasal passages

⚠️ Pepsin does NOT belong in the throat.

⸻

Why pepsin causes bad breath

Here’s the key concept most people miss:

Pepsin sticks to tissue

•	It embeds into the throat lining

•	It can sit there for hours or days

Pepsin is “inactive” but not gone

•	When stomach acid isn’t present, pepsin becomes dormant

•	BUT it reactivates every time acid or weak acid touches it

•	Food

•	Drinks

•	Reflux gas

•	Even mildly acidic saliva

What pepsin does when active

•	Damages tissue

•	Breaks down proteins in mucus

•	Creates sulfur-containing byproducts

•	Causes:

•	Chronic bad breath

•	White or yellow tongue coating

•	Throat tightness / globus

•	Post-nasal drip

•	Morning breath even with good hygiene

👉 This is not a mouth bacteria problem.

👉 This is a throat chemistry problem.

⸻

WHY BRUSHING, MOUTHWASH, AND ANTIBIOTICS DON’T FIX IT

•	Brushing = teeth only

•	Mouthwash = temporary masking

•	Antibacterials (oregano oil, biofilm disruptors):

•	Dry tissue

•	Increase irritation

•	Can actually make pepsin damage worse

That’s why people with LPR often say:

“My mouth is clean but my breath still smells.”

⸻

THE SOLUTION: DEACTIVATE PEPSIN

The only thing that permanently stops pepsin:

ALKALINE pH

Critical number

Pepsin is irreversibly inactivated at pH ≥ 8.8

Once that happens:

•	It cannot reactivate

•	It stops damaging tissue

•	It stops producing odor

This is the foundation of the protocol.

⸻

THE SAFEST LPR PROTOCOL

1️⃣ CORE TOOL: ALKALINE GARGLE (MOST IMPORTANT)

Why gargling matters more than drinking

LPR is not stomach acid sitting in the stomach.

It’s airborne reflux + pepsin stuck in the throat.

So:

•	Drinking alkaline water = limited effect

•	Gargling alkaline water = direct pepsin deactivation

⸻

Using alkaline pH drops (Amazon)

These are one of the safest long-term tools.

What to look for

•	Mineral-based alkaline drops

•	No added acids

•	Adjustable pH

How to use

1. Add drops to filtered water
2. Test with pH strips
3. Spit (optional small sip is okay)

⸻

How often

Minimum:

•	After meals

•	Before bed

Ideal:

•	3–5 times per day

•	Before long talking

•	When breath feels “off”

This is not dangerous when done correctly and not swallowed in excess.

⸻

2️⃣ DIET (TO PREVENT REACTIVATING PEPSIN)

The diet’s job is NOT to “reduce acid forever.”

Its job is to:

•	Reduce reflux events

•	Avoid acid exposure in the throat

•	Allow damaged tissue to heal

Safest foods

Proteins •	Baked or grilled chicken (no skin or spices) •	Turkey breast •	Egg whites (yolks in moderation) •	Tofu / tempeh •	Low-fat fish (e.g. cod, tilapia)

Carbs / Grains •	Brown rice •	Quinoa •	Oatmeal (unsweetened) •	Sweet potatoes •	Whole wheat pasta (no tomato sauce) •	Ezekiel bread

Veggies (non-acidic & cooked/steamed is best) •	Zucchini •	Broccoli •	Carrots •	Green beans •	Spinach •	Cucumber •	Celery

Fruits (low-acid only) •	Bananas •	Melons (cantaloupe, honeydew) •	Apples (peeled, not green) •	Pears

Dairy (if tolerated) •	Almond milk or oat milk (unsweetened) •	Plain Greek yogurt (low-fat, no added fruit or sugar)

Fats (healthy & anti-inflammatory) •	Olive oil •	Avocado (small amounts) •	Ground flaxseed •	Omega-3s (from fish or supplements)

Snacks •	Unsalted rice cakes •	Plain crackers (like water crackers) •	Chamomile or ginger tea (non-caffeinated) •	Alkaline water (pH 8.8+)

Avoid while healing

•	Alcohol

•	Smoking / vaping

•	Coffee

•	Tomato

•	Citrus

•	Spicy food

•	Late-night eating

•	Large portions

These reactivate pepsin, even if they don’t cause heartburn.

⸻

3️⃣ TIMING RULES (VERY IMPORTANT)

•	Stop eating 3 hours before lying down

•	Eat to 80% full

•	No bending, slouching, or heavy exertion after meals

This reduces reflux pressure and prevents pepsin exposure.

⸻

4️⃣ ORAL CARE (DO LESS, NOT MORE)

Safe routine:

•	Brush teeth normally

•	Gentle tongue brushing (no scraping hard)

•	Rinse with alkaline water after brushing

Avoid:

•	Alcohol mouthwash

•	Chlorhexidine

•	Essential oil mouthwashes

•	Strong antimicrobial supplements

Those irritate tissue and worsen LPR breath.

⸻

5️⃣ SLEEP POSITION

•	Left-side sleeping

•	Head elevated 4–6 inches

•	No lying flat after eating

Nighttime reflux is a major cause of morning breath.

⸻

6️⃣ OPTIONAL (ONLY IF NEEDED)

If symptoms persist after 2–3 weeks:

•	Alginate (reflux barrier) after dinner

•	Low-dose melatonin (1–3 mg) at night

Avoid:

•	Betaine HCl

•	Digestive enzymes with pepsin

•	“Kill the bacteria” approaches

⸻

WHAT NORMAL BREATH FEELS LIKE

People recovering often ask this.

Normal breath:

•	Smells like nothing

•	Maybe faint neutral or “clean”

•	Not sour

•	Not fecal

•	Not musty

•	Not food-rotting

A slight food scent shortly after eating is normal.

Persistent odor hours later is not.

⸻

EXPECTED TIMELINE

•	Days 1–5: fluctuation, morning coating still possible

•	Days 6–14: breath stabilizes most of the day

•	Weeks 3–4: tongue mostly pink, minimal odor

•	1–3 months: throat tissue healed, fewer relapses

•	Long-term: normal eating with awareness

This improves gradually, not overnight.

⸻

FINAL TAKEAWAY (THIS IS THE KEY MESSAGE)

LPR bad breath is not because you’re dirty, infected, or broken.

It’s because:

•	Pepsin is stuck in your throat

•	It keeps getting reactivated

•	And no one taught you how to deactivate it

Once pepsin is neutralized consistently, the smell stops.

I’m a week into using this protocol and my bad breath is 90% gone (I get minor flare ups after meals but it’s because I’m early into the protocol), I never would have  thought I would get here I’m so grateful for this sub it helped me get to where am I am and I wish to help people the way people helped me.

I'll break it down by hard product, service, and food/beverage. For context, this was our first time booking with u/alex_travels and it definitely makes the experience a thousand times better not having to think about breakfast costs and everything. We unfortunately were not upgraded, and to be honest was a little curious about this as it certainly seemed there were some rooms available, but not a big deal.

**Summary / tl;dr:**

We had an incredible babymoon overall. We had time to relax, ate fantastic food generally speaking, spent time outside in the beautiful weather, and the resort is perfect for this type of trip. The resort is accommodating, peaceful, and comfortable. We will go back at some point in the future, and just focus our eating and drinking off the resort outside of breakfast, assuming service ebbs and flows like most any resort.

  
**The resort - 5/5:**

The resort itself is fantastic. The Onsen's are wonderful, the landscaping is meticulous but natural, you can easily feel like you're one of the only ones there even when the resort is generally ""crowded"". The pool area is spread out, the water a very comfortable temperature, multiple hot tubs to use. 

**Service - 4/5:**

Generally speaking, the service was just ""good"". The care for my pregnant wife with the pregnancy pillow and virgin cocktail welcome amenity was thoughtful. They turned down one of the Onsen temperatures to 95 degrees for the duration of our stay so she could get into it safely. However, the warmth and general attitude of the staff is largely what kept the rating at a 4 instead of a 3, just relative to the amount of money being spent, as I like to think of myself as a pretty reasonable guest. There wasn't anything ""ongoing"" that could really be rectified, just attention to detail and making for a consistent experience. Some examples: 

* Breakfast the first couple of days always included an amuse-bouche/little bite -- I had to ask about it our last 2-3 mornings after we had already received our coffee and all other food. The first morning a juice was forgotten, and a smoothie forgotten a handful of other mornings. 
* The Onsen was turned down for us, but we had asked about it before we went into town for dinner our first night so that it would be at the right temperature that evening since it takes a couple of hours. A couple of hours later when we got ready to use it, we messaged to make sure it had been turned down, and it hadn't. They were attentive and rushed to get it turned down, even bringing a bag of ice out to accelerate it.
* We went to use the Onsen our last evening before dinner, and there were no towels. No worries, as I just messaged to have some brought out to us. After 30 minutes of none being brought when they said they would, I had to message again, and then it was at least another 15 minutes. Fortunately our timing for getting ready for dinner was still okay, but it was just kind of frustrating.
* We did a couples massage, which was wonderful, but undoubtedly very expensive, nearing or surpassing $1,000 including gratuity for a one hour massage and 30 minutes of Hale time. The 30 minutes of Hale time you get after the massage simply isn't enough -- you feel kind of rushed if you haven't already thought about how you want to spend your time. The sauna was ""on"" supposedly but didn't feel any hotter than 80 degrees, so I'm not positive it was double checked, and again, with such limited time, you don't want to spend time getting dressed again, getting the attention of the staff, etc. The steam shower takes at least 15 minutes to heat up, so that takes up half of your time.
* The 2 ladies working the pool were an absolute delight. Unfortunately, I think they just need more help. Having to run food and drink, go to all parts of the pool, etc., you at times wait a while to get a lounger setup, or if you set it up yourself (which is fine), they may not see you and you may wait quite a while to order anything.
   * To repeat, though, the two women working the pool were a delight. I received a pina colada that pretty much was just melted ice (more on food/bev below), and when I asked to have it remade, one of them went to just go make it herself.
* Kind of blending into food/bev as I finish this section, the attention to detail at the bar/food coming out to the pool isn't great. I ordered a ""Hawaiian smoothie"" one day, it has multiple fruits and vanilla protein powder, and what came out was pretty much just blended ice and mango it seemed like, completely different than the smoothie we had pretty much every morning at breakfast. Similarly, the furikake popcorn snack is delicious, but 2 of the days we ordered it, it came out in a large bowl, and then the last day, in a small bento box... but for the same price. Who knows if it was the same amount of popcorn, but just makes it confusing for what to expect.

Again, all small things, but just kind of frustrating. Somewhat made up by the friendliness and warmth of the staff, but not entirely.

  
**Food/Bev - 3.5/5:**

To be clear ahead of this, a good bit of this is ""value"" based. I understand this is a Four Seasons, and a small one at that, so there is a price premium. The summary of my thoughts outlined here, though, is that a premium price should still provide a premium product. 

Unfortunately, the food and beverage just didn't quite live up to expectations. This is possibly because it gets framed in comparison to other food and drink on the island, but for the price, it's a little disappointing and just ""average"". 

* Breakfast each morning was solid to very good. The fact that it was included through booking with Alex made it great. The service hiccups aside, we always enjoyed breakfast by the koi pond. Poi donut, banana bread, hawaiian smoothie, yogurt bowl, french press, island breakfast - all great.
* We ate lunch by the pool a couple of times. The first was a salad with chicken and the lamb/rice bowl, both were actually very tasty. Problem is, the lamb was 6 ""meatballs"" about the size of a large marble, and were probably half chickpea. Delicious, but for the price, some more evidence of actual meat would be nice. The salad was great, with a pretty generous amount of chicken, albeit a nearly $50 price tag. The sandwich and wrap we had a different day were just ""pretty good"", maybe a little bland. The blandness seemed to be somewhat of a trend, where things just kind of felt noticeably under salted.
* We only ate at Sensei for dinner one night, and though it was pretty good, it was probably our least favorite meal of the trip. I understand the menu is intentionally smaller than Nobu's, but it just felt a little uninspiring. Again, framed against going to the actual Nobu, a couple of nights at Lana'i City Grill, and a night at Pacific Rim. The whitefish tempura was decent, but the tempura was a touch thick and generally it felt under-seasoned. The curry dish was pretty good, but again, really not that much protein for the seafood option, just been a few shrimp, a couple small pieces of calamari, and one small scallop. And again, just not that exciting as far as flavor.
   * The service/experience at dinner was also just not up to snuff. I know it isn't Nobu, and shouldn't necessarily try to be, but when interactions are pretty much just limited to, ""what would you like to drink"", ""what would you like to eat"", why wouldn't I just go down to Nobu, have more to choose from, objectively better execution, more helpful/attentive service, etc. All very friendly and warm, but just doesn't feel like a place where you're spending hundreds of dollars on a meal.
* Drinks/cocktails were a noticeable drop-off as well, ***except*** for the mocktails, which were great all over the island and my wife was thrilled. But otherwise, $25 cocktails should be pretty fantastic cocktails. I mentioned the pina colada above, which was remade and much better the second time, though mostly just coconut and not a lot of rum. The mai tai I had on the first day was good, and probably the best I had at Sensei. From there, my tequila cocktail by the pool one day mostly tasted like some cucumber, melted ice, and tequila, and not in a balanced way, but again because of how busy the pool staff are, waiting around for it to be remade just gets kind of old. The whiskey ""Stargazer"" cocktail I had at dinner at Sensei was decent, but with amaretto, considerably too sweet and unbalanced. I eventually switched to the $12 beers.

To reiterate, spending the money isn't a problem. I understand the volume of customers at Sensei is significantly less when compared to the beach resort, so there's a lot that goes into how you keep menu's focused, maintain costs and revenue, etc. But when cocktails at Lana'i City Grill and Nobu for $15/20 are beating yours handily, food is objectively better for less or the same (not just a difference in tastes, I accept that didn't have as much interest in ""wellness"" oriented dishes and gravitate to things like kalbi, korean fried chicken \[at Pacific Rim, it's fantastic\], local venison dishes, etc. etc.), just leaves something to be desired.

  
Again, we came home incredibly relaxed and had a wonderful, wonderful babymoon on Lana'i. We ate wonderful food in the town and at Nobu, great breakfast every morning, plenty of time in the Onsen tubs, great sleep, time spent outdoors in the beautiful weather.",4,1768275240.0,chubbytravel,3,0.83,False

Every time I leave for work, I see them standing in the dark kitchen, watching me leave in silence...","The family across the street never uses their front door.

I noticed it my first week in the house. It’s a small detail, the kind you only register because there isn’t much else to look at when you leave for work at the same time every morning. Same street. Same cars. Same quiet.

Their front door faces mine.

It’s painted a pale blue and looks well maintained. No peeling. No damage. A wreath hangs on it year round, changing with the seasons. Spring flowers. Summer greenery. Fall leaves. Winter pine.

But I’ve never seen it open.

They only ever use the back door. I know because their driveway wraps around the side, and every evening, just after sunset, I see movement there. Shapes passing briefly through the glow of a streetlight before disappearing inside.

They never turn on lights.

Not once.

Their house sits dark even at night, windows black, curtains open. At first I assumed they were trying to save electricity or preferred lamps instead of overhead lighting. That felt reasonable. Normal.

Until I started seeing them in the kitchen.

Every weekday morning, I leave for work at 6:40 a.m. It’s early enough that most of the street is still asleep. Porch lights off. Cars quiet. The sky in that dull blue-gray stage before sunrise.

That’s when I see them.

All of them.

Standing in the dark kitchen, just inside the window.

No lights on. No movement. Just silhouettes framed by glass.

They don’t wave. They don’t talk to each other. They don’t move at all.

They just watch me leave.

At first, I thought it was coincidence. Maybe I’d caught them mid-conversation. Maybe they were waiting on coffee to finish brewing. People do that. Stand in kitchens. Stare out windows.

But it happened again the next morning.

And the next.

Same positions. Same stillness. Same silence.

There are four of them. Two adults. Two kids, I think. The shorter shapes stand closer to the counter, their heads just below where the cabinets would be. The adults stand behind them, one with their hands resting on the counter edge.

They’re always facing me.

I tried waving once.

No response.

Not even a shift in posture.

I stopped waving after that.

The house itself looks lived in. Lawn trimmed. Trash bins out on the right days. Packages appear on their porch and are gone by evening. I’ve never seen a delivery person knock. I’ve never seen anyone answer the door.

No lights ever turn on.

I mentioned it casually to my coworker last week. Made a joke about living next to vampires or something.

She laughed, then asked which house.

When I told her, she frowned.

“That place has been empty for years,” she said. “My cousin used to live two doors down.”

I told her she was wrong. I see them every morning.

She shook her head.

“No one’s lived there since the fire.”

I asked what fire.

She said it was before I moved in. Kitchen fire. Middle of the night. The family didn’t make it out.

I didn’t sleep much that night.

This morning, when I left for work, they were there again.

But this time, one of them raised a hand.

Not to wave.

To point.

At my front door.

From the inside.

And for the first time since I moved in, I noticed something else.

Their front door wreath was gone.

The door itself was open.

Just a few inches.

And something in the dark hallway behind it was waiting for me to notice.

I didn’t leave for work.

I stood on my porch with my keys in my hand, staring across the street at their house while my car idled behind me. The front door was still open. Just enough that I could see the thin slice of darkness beyond it, deeper than the shadows around it. Like the house hadn’t woken up yet.

The kitchen window was empty.

No silhouettes. No watching.

That scared me more than the pointing.

I checked the time. 6:41 a.m. One minute late. My phone buzzed with a notification from work asking if I was running behind. I typed a quick excuse about car trouble and didn’t send it.

Across the street, something moved.

Not a person. Not a full shape.

A slow shift of dark behind the front door, as if someone had leaned closer to the opening and then stopped. I couldn’t see details. Just absence where there should’ve been light.

I went back inside and locked my door.

I watched from the living room window instead. The family reappeared in the kitchen at 6:43, right on schedule. Same four shapes. Same positions. No lights. No movement.

One of the smaller ones had turned its head.

Not toward me.

Toward the open front door.

That’s when I noticed the kitchen sink light.

It wasn’t on.

But the window glass had fogged along the bottom edge, like warm water had been running nearby.

I stayed home that day. Used a sick day I didn’t really have. Every hour, I checked the house across the street. Nothing changed. No doors opened. No lights came on. The back door stayed closed all day.

At sunset, I saw movement again.

The back door opened.

They left the house in single file. Silent. Careful. The two smaller ones first, then the adults. They didn’t walk down the driveway. They turned and moved along the side of the house, disappearing into the shadows between properties.

They didn’t come back.

The kitchen was empty all night.

I slept badly, waking every hour to check the window.

At 6:38 a.m., my phone alarm went off.

I didn’t turn it off.

I watched the house instead.

6:40.

The kitchen filled again.

All four of them.

But they were closer to the window this time. Pressed nearer to the glass. Their outlines clearer. Sharper.

I could make out faces now.

Not details. Just impressions. Eyes where eyes should be. Mouths that didn’t move. Skin that looked stretched too smooth, like it had forgotten how to wrinkle.

One of the adults lifted a hand.

Placed it flat against the glass.

A second later, I felt it.

A gentle pressure on my own front door.

Not knocking.

Just a hand resting there.

I backed away slowly, heart pounding, trying not to make a sound.

From across the street, all four heads turned at once.

They were no longer watching me leave.

They were watching me stay.

And behind their kitchen window, the overhead light finally turned on.

It revealed a fifth shape standing behind them.

Taller. Thinner.

Close enough that its outline blended with theirs.

The light clicked off immediately.

At 6:41 a.m., my front doorknob turned once.

Carefully.

Like whoever was on the other side already knew the way inside.

I didn’t scream when the doorknob turned.

I don’t know why. Maybe my body understood something my mind hadn’t caught up to yet. That panic would be loud. That loud would be noticed.

I stood in the hallway, a few steps back from the door, watching the knob settle back into place.

No knock followed.

No second attempt.

Across the street, the kitchen went dark again.

I waited a long time before I moved. Long enough that my legs started to ache. Long enough that the house felt unfamiliar, like I was standing in someone else’s entryway.

When I finally checked the door, it was locked. Chain still in place. Nothing damaged. Nothing forced.

Outside, the street looked normal. Quiet. Empty.

The family was back in their kitchen at exactly 6:45, but they weren’t facing me anymore.

They were facing inward.

Toward the fifth shape.

I called the fire department that afternoon. Not 911. The administrative line. I asked about the house across the street. Told them I was thinking about buying in the neighborhood and wanted to know about prior incidents.

The woman on the phone went quiet when I gave her the address.

She confirmed the fire. Kitchen. Early morning. Faulty wiring behind the walls. She said the smoke alarms never went off.

I asked if anyone survived.

“No,” she said. “But there was a neighbor who reported something strange.”

I asked what.

“He said the family never used the front door,” she replied. “Said they’d been doing that for weeks before the fire. Like they didn’t want to go through it anymore.”

That night, I didn’t turn on any lights.

I sat in the dark and watched the house across the street do the same.

At 6:40 a.m., they were there again.

Four in the kitchen.

The fifth behind them.

But this time, the smallest one had shifted. It wasn’t standing at the counter anymore.

It was closer to the front of the house.

I felt it before I saw it.

The subtle pressure of someone standing on my porch. The sense of weight just beyond the door.

My phone buzzed.

A text from an unknown number.

> You can use the back if you want.
The front is crowded now.



I didn’t respond.

I watched the kitchen window instead.

One by one, the family turned their heads.

Not toward me.

Toward my hallway.

Toward my front door.

The fifth shape leaned forward, stretching unnaturally, its outline thinning as it reached toward the glass.

And for the first time since I moved in, I realized something worse than being watched.

They weren’t waiting for me to leave.

They were waiting for me to open the door.

So they wouldn’t have to use theirs anymore.",1,1768275184.0,u_NightmareNarratives-,0,1.0,False

I have a serious opportunity to share with you

What you're looking at below is a new RPG productivity leveling system. 

Before it was just a simple to do list with a built-in calendar and a distraction logger.

It was already performing well.

**But we weren't satisfied.** 

So after scratching loads of bad ideas, drinking too much coffee, and a series of endless calls, we finally came up with a new idea.

An idea that eradicates someone's ADHD, the ""planning but not doing"" syndrome, and worst of all, juggling apps that never really work long term.

That's right, this RPG productivity leveling system is not like other gamified systems where you drop off out of boredom.

This new sequence hands you endless fun and dopamine that feels so good, you mistake your hardest tasks as an easy game play.

Now, if you join the wait list very early, you'll received a special access that's not available for late users.

But there's a catch: You have to join before January 30, after the app officially launches.

Sound fair? 

Thank you so much. Just enter your email, and wait for a few days

If you got additional questions, let me know on the comments.

Cheers to your best life and productivity. [Join the early wait list here](https://productivitapp.com/)

Uhhh…the Statue of Liberty! But I dunno how to get there.
“Why not, don’t you live around here? (no.) Why not work at a coffee shop closer to your house then?”
Because there are none! The closest cafe is a 20 min drive away.
“Huh!? Why’s that??”

there is nothing wrong with workout clothing but in my opinion it just comes off as very bland and conformist.

so many young women in LA have the same leggings or short shorts look in public. women in new york city seem to dress classier in my opinion.

I’m actually very pleasantly surprised with how well he’s stepped into fatherhood, our kids are very lucky! But this time period of our life is kind of opening my eyes and I’m starting to question if I made the right choice in a partner.. there’s several defining moments in our relationship that I feel like have stuck with me and I realized how much resentment I’m starting to have towards him. 

- on my very first Mother’s Day he stayed up until the early morning playing games, slept in until nearly noon while I woke up with our baby (5 months old at the time) and treated myself to coffee since I wanted to make the day feel special. He had no plans so we last minute decided to take our baby to the zoo, afterwards I got upset because he didn’t do anything for my first Mother’s Day and he ended up making me feel bad for it. 
- the night we got home with our second baby he got high and left me to do everything myself (he gets tested for work but since he was on paternity leave he felt like it was one of his few chances to smoke again)
- after our second baby I ended up getting really bad postpartum depression. His friend was planning to visit us and when he did they went out every day and night for multiple days, didn’t even invite me out to lunch or anything, and it was my first time being completely alone with our newborn and toddler while going through a real mental crisis. He felt as if I was trying to ruin his friends trip. (and we have no family or friend support since we had just moved to this state a few months prior so I really was all alone)

There’s a few other instances like this that contribute to the resentment but these specifically hurt me badly. I feel like times of difficulty and hardship should be what makes a relationship stronger but it really feels the complete opposite. 
We’ve had a really hard time communicating our whole relationship, he really just can’t seem to talk through emotions and it feels like we’ve never made progress despite our efforts. Every serious talk usually ends up with him saying that’s just not the kind of guy he is, and that what im asking for is not real and that no guy is going to be “as emotional as i want him to be” and that im “just mad because he’s not acting exactly how i want him to act.” And ALWAYS the next morning he smiles and sweeps it under the rug and pretends it never happened, we never have any sort of conflict resolution. 

Now I know he sounds pretty terrible but he really is a great guy, but I feel like when I need him most he is never there, and isn’t that what a relationship is all about? 95% of the time we’re best friends and have a great relationship, but I’m starting to wonder if the other 5% is enough to make me walk away. I just feel like I deserve a partner that’s emotionally available and SHOWS me he loves me rather than just tells me. I know we’re both still young but we’ve been together for 6 years and it doesn’t seem like he’s open to growth in this part of our relationship and I’m not sure if I’m willing to spend the rest of my life in a relationship like this when I know there is men out there that could give me the connection that I need. 

The thought of splitting up now that we have children genuinely destroys me, I never wanted that for our children but I’m also still living life for the first time too. I’m feeling pretty conflicted, I love him whole heartedly but I don’t want to look back in 10 years and know I could have done better. I can just feel my resentment towards him growing… do I keep working towards our future and hope is just a rocky time period or do men like this never really change?

I started at the high end of normal BMI and definitely high body fat percentage. Was advised by my Korean endocrinologist to try and drop 26! pounds and given no nutrition advice. I had high cholesterol (not high enough for meds yet) I have two parents on high cholesterol meds and I am in the highest risk category for heart disease. My mom is diabetes type 2, and my dad is prediabetic. So just want to let you know I am affected by my genetics certainly. 
In Korea you see the doctor for about 3 minutes if lucky so I had not much to go on. The Korean translator was pretty nice she said because I am a foreigner my body was different so losing 15 pound might be okay. (Still seems like a lot to me because I had a normal BMI…)
All my life i needed to eat frequently and in the past if I did a short fast I would faint. Lately I was tired and hungry all the time. 

What I did: 2.5 weeks of keto. I felt horrible most of this time. My husband joined me. We tried for less than 15 carbs a day. 

Then I transitioned to low carb less than 40 carbs a day. Started intermittent fasting. Dirty fast 16:8 I would have my coffee either milk. Eat only lunch and dinner no snacks. Suddenly after I cut carbs I could fast and hunger no longer made me feel crazy! It was amazing

3 months in switched to low-moderate carb. Most days sub 60 never went over 100. Never broke my fast either a high carb meal. Often did a very low carb meal for lunch, more carb at night. Great mental clarity, energy, more productive at work.

5 months in: holidays. I had some high carb days. Always felt bad afterwards limited to once a week, only one meal. Felt bad about eating more meat to hit macros, started switching to vegetarian low carb for lunches most days. For example a roasted vegetable salad with a fried egg, or burrito salad with some beans guacamole quest chips.

Today? LDL is down 40 points. I am no longer considered prediabetic. My endo said I did great and said I don’t need follow up’s. I will keeping eating healthy. If that’s all it takes to keep from getting diabetes, that’s an easy choice. I lost only 8 pounds. I did not focus on calories at all. Just eating healthy. I barely exercised just light yoga and some walks. 

What’s next? I’ll try to exercise more. I focused on sustainable habit change and weight loss and it worked for me. I hope someone else finds this helpful. Thanks again to this sub for helping me. 🙏",2,1768274175.0,prediabetes,0,1.0,False

I had a second round interview today. It was an hour interview and originally, I was supposed to meet with the VP from 1-1:30PM then with 2 directors from 1:30-2PM. I got an email this morning saying the VP is sick and won’t be able to interview and the two directors would be separate - one at 1-1:30 then the other at 1:30-2PM. 

I joined the call at 1PM and no one was there. I waited until about 1:35PM and was caught off guard when both of them joined. I mentioned I was confused about what happened and they said they read the times wrong and apologized. 

Since they already joined the call a little late, the interview went a little past 2PM but one of them even left the meeting early because she said she had to jump to another meeting. I’m a little disappointed and annoyed because they barely asked any questions (maybe 3?). 

I sent an email to the recruiter and mentioned how both of them joined the call at the 1:30 time slot but I enjoyed my conversation with them and if any additional interview rescheduling is needed, please let me know and I’m happy to share availability. I look forward to hearing back on next steps and any feedback - is it bad I said this?

I feel like I won’t make it to next round because of this. Ugh, I had a good interview with the person first round. HR even said the feedback from the first round interview was extremely positive and they even mentioned this in my interview today.

Please bear with the long question!

Over the course of about 5 months of piano lessons, my piano teacher and I (we are the same age) developed good chemistry and became friendly. Since I’m in town for a short time, **she suggested** we meet up for coffee. We agreed on a date. I was excited to meet her in person. Since I don’t know the city very well (only been here couple of times, whereas she has lived here her whole life), I asked her to suggest the venue. But I still searched for some nice cafes close by and sent her suggestions. She didn’t confirm the venue or time until the night before. I waited till 9pm the night before and texted her to confirm if we are still meeting the next day. She replied asking if we can postpone because she was tired and asked if we can meet the day after.

Normally I would have been completely okay moving the date, but I was irritated because she didn’t even bother to text me until AFTER I checked in with her. I didn’t handle it well. I said fine but said I won’t be able to meet the day after. I should have just said that but I didn’t want to be rude so I gave some made up excuse that I have plans the day after.

I said we can meet some other time. But then she changed her mind and said she doesn’t want to push the date further and said we should just stick to the original date. I tried saying no but she insisted and I gave in. We met on the original date.

The meeting, surprisingly, went very well. There was no tension. We are both passionate about music and had a great conversation. Somehow at the end of the meeting, we made another plan (mutually) to meet up again the following monday, as I would be leaving town on Tue and won’t be returning back for a year.

However, the problem started here. We had a class the day after our initial meeting and when she casually asked how my day was, I replied (honestly) that it was a lazy relaxing day at home. I completely forgot that I earlier gave her an excuse that I have plans (when she tried to postpone our initial meeting). I think she caught this and scoffed. From that point onwards, her behaviour was a bit off. She was still polite but more professional (which seemed weird to me because we usually speak very casually and joke around). Usually after our lesson time ends, we casually talk about music or personal projects we are working on and our calls extend for at least 30-40 min post our lesson time. But on this day, she ended the call exactly on time.

I felt a bit uncomfortable afterward but didn’t say anything, mostly because I was more upset with myself. When she was flaky about our first meeting, I had a valid reason to say no and should have done so directly. Instead, I impulsively made up an excuse to avoid meeting, then later forgot about it. When it came up again, I spoke honestly without remembering the earlier excuse, which made things awkward.

But I didn’t say anything. I hoped if we meet on monday we can clear it. I was even willing to apologize for not being honest and explain my reasons.

But she didn’t text on Sun about meeting the following day. I didn’t either. This whole situation has been making me anxious and I decided that if she didn’t text this time, I would end this ‘friendship’ and just be professional from now on.

The meeting on monday never happened. We had another group lesson today and I kept things strictly professional, though I was polite the whole time. She caught this and tried to ask if something was wrong, I said no. After the lesson, she texted me asking why I was dull in class today. And then said ***“I know we were supposed to meet yesterday, but I was too lazy to come. I thought you were busy too because you didn’t text.”***

I am so irritated by this - I feel like she knows exactly what is happening but is pretending as if she’s got no clue. I don’t like ignoring people usually, I feel like its childish to ignore someone but I’ve had situations in the past where when I tried explaining, they would twist it to make themselves the victim and make me the bad guy. So I didn’t say anything. I am just thinking of replying ""**I’m okay, don’t worry about it.**” and hoping she gets the hint and just drops it. And then I want to keep things strictly professional from now on. We only have 2 more lessons, I’m planning to switch to a different teacher after that.

I’m someone who takes plans seriously. If I’ve agreed to meet and later realize I can’t make it, I make sure to inform the other person as early as possible because I value their time. Her approach seems different she’s comfortable canceling or changing plans at the last minute without much notice. I’m not trying to decide who’s right or wrong, but that kind of behaviour doesn’t sit well with me. It feels wrong to me, and since she doesn’t seem to recognise why it’s an issue, I don’t want to continue the friendship.

And moreover this whole thing is making me so anxious! Life is short and I don’t want to waste time with drama like this.

In hindsight, I learned a big lesson - to never let friendship in professional situations. And to just be blunt and say NO without lying to give explanations on why I can’t meet.

**My question -What’s the best way to respond to her message so I can keep things peaceful, professional, and not awkward until the remaining lessons are done?**

2. Before the plane Evan leaves the ground, maybe Evan on your drive to the airport imagine all the bumps that you feel as the vehicle moves forward. These bumps are probably worse than the turbulence you may experience. And while you’re in the plane and feel some turbulence, just think back to those bumps during driving how they might have been worse then the bumping now but you weren’t afraid then so why should you be now?

3. Incase the turbulence gets worse, I recommend, lifting your feet a bit off the ground, and maybe Evan hopping up and down in your chair a a little if you’re not too embarrassed! It’ll make you feel it less!!

4. Research about how plains ACTUALLY work. Think about WHAT it is you’re scared of and combat those fears one by one. Are you scared of dropping? Planes can usually regain control Evan after dropping a bit. A plane can still land safely Evan if only one engine is intact. Planes can’t bump into each other in flight as there are so many safety procedures against it! The wings of a plane are extremely bendable and are extremely unlikely to ever snap!I recommend checking out more stuff about how incredibly safe planes are, I’m sure it’ll give you some reassurance!

5. For the love of god, unless you REALLY think it might help you, don’t watch planes crash videos right before you go into your plane-
Also don’t drink coffee, increases anxiety.

6. Look at all the planes taking off there not crashing!

7. Find a good distraction, one that needs focus, whether that’s a video game, art, or something else. Do it! I also really like looking out the window, it’s might seem like the opposite of what you’d want, but it helps with no being surprised by random motions, when it’s usually just the pilot turning! Also the view is great!

8. Remember, the pilots and flight crew don’t want to die either, nor be in much discomfort. They’ll always try to make the flight as smooth and safe as possible for you and themselves! If the flight crew ain’t stressing neither should you, and Evan if they are, might just want to make sure your seatbelts are buckled👍

9. Text someone before you take off, “hey I’m gonna be on a flight to( ), text you when I get there”. Idk why but it’s kind of reassuring, like your making a promise to yourself, or you’ve seen so many people text you the same thing and most likely end up texting you again after there flight.

10. If you’re still really scared, take a melatonin, try to fall asleep before the plain Evan gets in the air, you might be so tired you won’t Evan care it’s going up.

11. Act like you don’t care, fake it till you make it. Once again. Oddly reassuring, maybe Evan try thinking of it as fun! 

12. Feeling like you’re not in control sucks, imagine, you’re controlling the plane, try to believe it as much as possible. Once again silly, but still helps. 

Ok! Thats all for now, hope this helped some of yall out! ",5,1768273900.0,fearofflying,2,1.0,False

I had a huge crush on him in high school and I have always wondered about him and what could have been. This last time we talked I reached out to him to ask him a question about something that happened in high school and we also caught up a little bit. He lives out of state now so I told him if he was ever back home that he should let me know and we could catch up some more. I didn’t really expect him to reach out, but to my surprise he did! We met up at a coffee shop near both of us and we talked for 2 hours inside until they closed and then another hour outside in the parking lot. It felt like neither of us really wanted the night to end. Since we had our meeting we have texted a few times. We wished each other Merry Christmas and Happy New Year’s and there were a few other random texts. But I really wish we could talk on a more regular basis. I don’t mean like every day but maybe a couple times a week? Or even like once a week. I don’t necessarily want it to be romantic conversation I just want us to talk more in general. I would be fine if it’s just friends and if it goes well then maybe it could be romantic in the future. But if it doesn’t turn romantic that would be ok too. I just really like talking to him!

I’m just short of two years away from my son turning 18, and I will then be free to move. I’m only in my current area for custody reasons, and of course my son and what opportunities he wants to take will be thought about!

But this’ll be the first time I’ve had to think about just what I want. I’m single, so no partner to consider (unless that changes at some point, fingers crossed). I’ll have no kids under 18. I don’t have anything I’d consider roots anywhere really. I have some good friendships around the country, but nothing that would pull me anywhere. So I’d love to start thinking about where I might want to go.

So what I’m looking for in a place would be…

1. Affordability. I don’t have a high income career, and my goal is to be able to afford basic life things and some fun activities without being super stressed. A community with a lot of fun/cheap activities would be awesome, too.
2. Opportunities for my interests: a community with crafting opportunities, specifically pottery and sewing.
3. Vegan friendly: I don’t eat out much, but it’s nice to be able to have options when I’m able to!
4. A really good coffee roaster!
5. A fairly creative community feel. I’d like to be able to dress in fun ways without feeling like I stick out.

I don’t need access to the mountains or skiing or anything like that, but a place with some nature preserved in various ways for the residents would be nice.

I probably wouldn’t love a super big city like NYC or Chicago, but I also wouldn’t love a super rural area. I’m also hoping to stay, like, around or east of the Mississippi ish.

   Me, now 19F and my ex, Josh now 19M dated a few years ago in high school and were together for over a year. We had so much fun, getting to be together almost everyday, spending time with our families, making up our own games, being goofy and just being able to be ourselves. I believe we were and are each others first love and that’s hard to forget. 
Near the end, him and I both had a conversation about potentially breaking up and mutually agreeing that we got into too much of a routine, we both weren’t happy and basically bored. After a year of constant us, we took every opportunity to see each other and didn’t take into account that being apart was okay, would’ve helped our situation and it was too late to try something new to help the spark come back because we didn’t know otherwise, being young and stupid is a joy. 
After that, there was typical relationship drama and getting used to no more gm or gn texts, feelings hurt. But that was around two years ago. Throughout that time, things got tense. He didn’t want to let me go, he didn’t understand, he was sad and angry. It hurt me seeing him like that but it scared me and made my situation even sadder. He would reach out wanting to argue, figure it out and then apologize and it got to the point where I had to block him, it got too much for me, but he never stopped trying to reach out. 
It’s hard to understand from an outside pov of course, but truly he is a great guy overall and has proved that he can love and care for me no matter what, I’m a very complicated person, I have mental struggles, odd/ unique interests that would be hard for most to understand and I feel he’s the only one that truly loves me for me. The lashing out did scare me, but I think he is and was scared himself. We both didn’t know how to handle this situation. However, now that we’ve grown a bit and have had new life experiences to teach us and help us be more mature. I feel confident enough to reach out myself, go talk at a coffee shop or something and really try to understand each other. 
My love has never faded, however, I wouldn’t be going into this expecting a relationship, or for him to have changed or for it to even go smoothly skipping off into the sunset. 
We both have changed so much, I can’t even say I know him anymore. I don’t know what to expect. But I’m willing to let him in to see if there is any way we can express ourselves more maturely. Possibly get some closure and be comfortable with each other again, in person or not being hesitant to text. 
The majority would say “never get back with your ex, you can’t change someone” and what not, but please try and see it differently. Trust me I have thought of every situation, the good and bad and how peoples reactions would be, but there’s no set rules for love. And I need help deciding if there’s hope to at least be civil, a potential friendship again or if I just let it go and keep my focus elsewhere. But I will always love him no matter what.

Hi! I’m 16F, I’m from the west coast. Growing up I was raised very Lutheran by my father (but was baptized catholic as a baby). Despite being raised very religious, i definitely did not have the best childhood. My parents divorced when I was three, because of my mothers infidelity and my fathers anger issues. I had to grow up traveling between the two houses.

 My father used to terrify me as a child because he spent most of his time yelling at me. He’s a bad chainsmoker, and I’ve seen him watching porn once or twice before just openly in the living room (despite how much he preaches Christianity). My mother is not religious at all. She was a good mom until I was about eight, and then she became an alcoholic and moved us in with her boyfriend (a random man) because we couldn’t afford to live in our apartment any longer (her boyfriend is super disrespectful and never leaves the house because he got fired for drug abuse) . Now she acts like she’s my age, she dresses like a teenager, she parties, and leaves home (where we live still with her boyfriend), to “hang out with other guys” for weeks at a time. She has her good moments but most of the time I kinda wish I had different parents (I know it’s bad to think).

Overall, I’m really struggling because of my situation, and the fact I’m lost religiously. Ive been learning more about the LDS church, and it seems like something I would really enjoy! I have a few concerns though. 

I’ve heard different people tell me about how the LDS church is super welcoming and kind! Which I hope is true but I’ve also heard that it can also be super judgmental? I’m not sure what to believe. I also feel somewhat tainted due to the fact I haven’t been the best Christian. I don’t party, or drink, or drugs—I’ve never even had a boyfriend before. I’m pretty quiet and stay home a lot to bake. But I do read adult books with adult themes in them. I feel that knowing about sex/being lustful, and reading about it, makes me less of a Christian, especially in the eyes of LDS. I also love to drink coffee and tea. 

I have wanted to be a mom all my life and that’s something very important to me!  I know it’s highly encouraged for women in LDS to get married and have kids, I have no problem with that at all. I wanted to be a stay at home mom since I was little, but as I’ve gotten older my mother has taught me that I should want something more and I’d regret my life if I didn’t get a job. I know she’d be upset with me if I didn’t have a big career. I’m struggling myself with deciding between the two. 

I would love to go to a sacrament meeting at a local LDS church but I doubt my mother would ever drive me there. And I know all my friends and family would disapprove of it or make fun of me. I don’t have any options to meet people apart of LDS. I’m very interested in the church and joining but I have all these fears about it. Maybe my mind would be changed if I actually went to a service but I don’t have any options as of right now to go to one. I think meeting members would actually help me decide. Any helpful advice would be greatly appreciated. (Sorry If my grammar is misspelt or nothing makes sense I’m writing this as fast as possible lol)

I haven’t seen a specialist about it since it hasn’t affected my day-to-day life, just my confidence.

**Location:** Brisbane Queen Street Mall

**Energy:** 4 out of 10

**Mood:** Feeling pretty exhausted after the weekend. I stayed up late Friday night checking out Fortitude Valley, stayed up late with Mayo on Saturday, and then stayed up late on Sunday after my date with Lizzie and talking with Pat. I was really feeling burnt out and resistant

**Limiting Beliefs:** I won't know what to say, these girls are too busy, I am not good at this, these girls won't like me, I'm too old for these girls, I just want to get home

**Social Exposure:** 12 approaches, 2 solid stops, really not feeling social

**Day Summary:**

The day started with me waking up at 8:30am after not getting to bed again until almost 3am. I think I got 15 hours of sleep in the last 3 days so I have a lot of sleep debt. My throat was also feeling a bit scratchy after my date with Lizzie so I didn't sleep the best.

I forced myself to go out at noon to go and get some approaches done. I was really tired and had a lot of resistance to going out there today. I filmed a quick clip for the YouTube video and instead of whining I just got up and went. I know if I take the day off I will easily find reasons to not keep going with the challenge.

The approaches today were a bit rough. I was not in a great mood, I felt very nervous today and I was not very energetic. It doesn't help that I am telling myself I don't want to do this before going out, so I will change this self talk and tell myself I am grateful I get to do this and work on my skillset. Great things can happen.

Not much to speak of in terms of the approaches today. Many were quick blowouts, girls with boyfriends, or me just running out of things to say. I did have a solid interaction with a girl from Hungary who was with her boyfriend in Brisbane though. They were very nice and cool and was great to be able to be non-reactive and fine talking to them after he came into the set.

I went out in the evening with George and we did a few more sets. I ended up getting to 12 for the day. It was way more fun going out with him, than by myself, but I will do what it takes to get to 10 everyday. George got in at least 5 I think and had a decent interaction or two.

It actually felt great not having any dates today and I could just chill for the night, now that my approaches were over. I was still feeling under the weather so it was nice to go with George and just chill in the sauna and recap how fun this is and the interesting experiences we have been having.

My plan was to go to bed around 10pm, but we started to watch It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia. George is really liking the show which is great to share it with him. I was sending out my messages for the day and watching the show and didn't get to bed until 11:30pm

I was wanting to go bed, but I just couldn't do it without posting a new YouTube video, even if it wasn't good and was low energy. I ended up posting this and getting to bed around 1am and then I woke up at 10am today. I still have a lot of sleep debt though

**Biggest Lesson / Takeaway for the Day:**

* I was actually grateful to have all blowouts today and not have any dates tonight. I was hard on myself thinking I should be performing better with my social skills and conversation skills, but I guess sometimes you just have ""bad"" days and need the break to rest

**Top 3 Interactions:**

* Hungarian girl with her boyfriend. Although she was in a relationship she was very friendly and cute and thanked me for talking to them. It was also nice talking to someone from Hungary as I was just reflecting the other day on how I haven't met anyone from there yet.
* The girl from Thailand was cool because I could see the attraction spike in her eyes. She was completely stunned that I stopped her and she was contributing a bit to the conversation, but I wasn't able to lead it, so she left. Good learning lesson though and showed girls love being stopped by attractive guys
* 20 year old girl eating Takis. She was very pretty with her dress and she seemed receptive as well. I ran out of things to say and got in my head that she was too young and not interested. This is a pretty stupid limiting belief as I was just making out with a 20 year old on my balcony last night. I got in my head and then bailed though. Good practice and something to work on

**What will I work on tomorrow:**

* I will film a positive message before my approaches talking about how excited I am and grateful I am to be out on Queen Street.

**Approaches:**

1. First approach of the day was a blonde girl in a black dress. She was walking pretty fast. She went inside a building and was waiting for the elevator. I said she looked nice. I didn't really tease, and then I tried to do a cold read, and she said she had to go. But good to get it done. The first one is the worst one.
2. very hesitant to do the second approach. I've seen a lot of girls walk by that I didn't open, feeling that they were too hot for me or I wouldn't have anything to say. I stopped a girl on the sidewalk and said she looked very dressed up like she was an assassin. She laughed, but then I tried to move out of traffic and she kept walking. She did not stop.
3. There was a girl waiting to cross the streets. I said she looked nice. She just said thanks and put her earphones back in.
4. Still feeling the nerves. I've done four approaches now. The last girl was very tall. She was wearing heels, so I teased her that she was like an elegant giraffe. I was not very squared up in front of her, though. I also was a little bit clunky in the interaction. She did say thanks. She did have a boyfriend already. She was from Brisbane. I could have just been a little bit more playful and loose, but the nerves were there.
5. Came back out, did an approach on a girl who was from Thailand. She's been here for three years, 25. She was very stunned when I stopped her, kind of in shock. She was not really hooking or giving me much, and kept wanting to leave. She was on her way to catch her bus, so probably not a lot I could do, but I did not feel super confident either. Good to get in this set overall.
6. Blonde girl look very happy. I stopped her first thing she said to me was that she had a boyfriend, so clearly my intention is on display. Nothing I could do with that. 
7. Try to stop a girl and open her. She just looked at me and walked past. She didn’t even stop. I kind of was on the side of her as well, so that probably did not help. 
8. Cute girl. Was walking very slow. I stopped her and said she looked like she was on her way to teach children. She did not really hook. She just stared at ME. She is Philippine and Japanese, but she lives here. She was on her way to go meet friends. I didn’t really know what else to say in the interaction, so I bailed.

10. There was a Korean girl, who is walking and looking at her phone. She seemed receptive. I kept talking, but she walked off. She was looking for something, and might be in a hurry. 
11. There was a cute girl in a dress, and she was eating Takis, so I went in and stopped her. She was only 20. She’s from India. She’s been here for seven years. I ran out of things to say she was very receptive of the compliment, but I was not leading the interaction very well. 
12. Was having coffee with George and saw a cute girl standing against the railing. I went in and said she looked nice and she hooked pretty quickly.

I've been playing Space Haven for a couple of months, and one of the things that always bugged me was not being able to plan my ship in advance (the game plan tool is quite limited). So, I built a small tool called ""Space Haven Planner"" to help plan ship layouts before you commit time/resources in-game.

I would love you guys to try it: [https://spacehavenplanner.com](https://spacehavenplanner.com)

The tool is completely open-source, you can check/fork/whatever the code here: [https://github.com/delucca/space-haven-planner](https://github.com/delucca/space-haven-planner)

Also, you don't need to create any account. All the data is stored in your browser :)

Anyway, here is a couple of things the tool does:

* Tile-based ship grid with common canvas presets
* Structure palette + rotation + placement validation (no accidental overlaps / out-of-bounds)
* Layers + organization so big layouts stay manageable
* Autosave locally (no accounts, no backend)
* Export to PNG (shareable) and JSON (editable / portable)
* Automatic integration with the game, I imported the most recent JAR file, so the catalog is updated
* Integration with fandom Wiki to display images/infos
* Optional: import your own spacehaven.jar so the structure catalog matches your game version (it parses locally in the browser and caches it for next time)

If you try it, and find any bugs, or want any specific features, please click on the ""Support"" button on the bottom left and send me a message there 🙌

The tool is totally free, but there is a link to my ""Buy Me a Coffee"" profile if you want to help me to keep the servers running 🙏

Thanks guys! I would love some feedback",24,1768272559.0,SpaceHaven,12,0.97,False

This is my SteamBox Xmachine. I've always found it interesting that the initial marketing of the PC being a tool for the office has carried for 30 years, where a lot of people still inherently see the PC as something for a desk, monitor, and keyboard and mouse and not something that can just be in your living room as a console, even when it's used primarily for gaming.

The wood is walnut that I milled and finished for a prior build (posted last night) and repurposed here for the monolithic style of the case. 

Shown is a coffee table that I built years ago that coincidentally perfectly houses the accompanying Lap Desk for the build. I do use the PC for art and other purposes, so finding this Rossie Home product was a perfect match in color scheme and concept for the times when needed.

1qbfi6z,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qbfi6z,"O by Claude Le Tohic (*) - San Francisco, CA","Overview:

O is a French restaurant with a bit of a Californian twist that to me adds a level of excitement and interest. The location of the restaurant itself is pretty strange in that you enter on the narrow ground level which is like their pastry shop, and each floor is a different restaurant or something. So from the bakery you take the elevator up to the 5th floor which is where this restaurant is. Exiting the elevator you are already in the restaurant at the reception area, so theres no hallway or extravagant entrance or anything, but from there its a normal fine dinning experience.


There is a 5 course menu (which is actually 6 courses) for $210 and 9 course menu for $295. The menus have some overlap but some differences so its not like the 9 course is just 3 extra courses. In fact to me some of the items on the 5 course seemed more interesting so I went with that, and Im glad that I did, so just make sure you check the different menus to see which one you prefer. They did call me ahead of time to choose which menu I wanted to go with, though the table next to me apparently pre-selected the 5 course and changed it to the 9 course at the start of dinner and it was no problem at all.


The 5 course was enough food for me, especially since you can pick many different breads and many different chocolates. There are also some supplements including a cheese trolly for $38 which was my initial plan to go with in case the 5 course menu wasn’t enough food, but it was. I’m glad I didnt get it though because I assumed (and was hoping) for it to be focused on French/European cheeses, but I believe it was all only cheeses from America.

Service was professional and friendly and I would say above average for a * here in SF.

Overall this place is rarely ever talked about, but was actually quite a pleasant surprise and i enjoyed it and would recommend others to try it.

Truffle with fish tartlet (pic 2):

Bread service (pic 3): Nice selection of bread to choose from with nice classic European accompaniments. Personally I prefer one really special and perfected bread over a large selection, but they were all solid and having this many options is always fun. 6.5/10


Seafood salad (pic 4): 
Every single element was tasty and different, and the gel and caviar and everything worked really well together: 9/10


Cod (pic 5):
Nicely cooked and good sauce 6.5


Venison (pic 6):
Actually nice overall and tasty sauce but a bit too gamey even with all the sauce, just not my favorite cut of venison, and a bit 1 note with the same sauce used for the meat and ravioli. 7/10


Chocolate/coffee (pic 7):
Some good flavors, mousse was very decedent and yuzu was interesting and fluffy  but nothing truly memorable 6/10


Dessert cart (pic 8): these are well made and this was fun, but overall many were too similar in style and nothing mind blowing flavor wise 6/10

I’m currently thinking about where I went wrong navigating my current situation. I (27F) am currently in a relationship with my partner (30M) and have a lot on my plate. We just finished moving into a new apartment (took us about half a month to move), while I’m enrolled in school for a medical program and work full time. Before moving, my partner asked me how he can help me with juggling work and school. I told him it would help if he helped more around the apartment (picking up cleaning, cooking) since I take night classes and won’t be around as much.

Well I’m week two into my classes and I feel like I’m dealing with more at home? We split cooking but I’m always meal prepping breakfast for us, sometimes lunch/dinner for the next day if we get to cooking it. We split chores and I handle my cleaning but he’s given the excuse he couldn’t get to his cleaning because “he doesn’t have the time” = this Sunday, while he built a coffee stand for the apartment, I put away all groceries from grocery shopping, meal prepped breakfast and lunch and cleaned/dusted the apartment. He asked if I can help and clean while I’m wfh which I’m not going to do as I’ve been booked with work and use my lunch break to study/review for my science class. He also makes me feel like I’m not doing as much around the apartment when I’m exhausted from studying and having to do labs. 

I would also like to say on his free time he games while I study/do homework. We work different schedules (him 6-2, me the regular 9-5). I feel like he does have the time but doesn’t use it to be productive. 

So how should I navigate explaining to him how I would feel more supported?  ",1,1768271645.0,dating_advice,3,1.0,False
