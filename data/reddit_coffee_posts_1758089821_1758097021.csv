First course: ""Seeing Red""

- Traditionally known as ""Nicotine & Caffeine"" was served with black coffee. However the cold , crisp , and slightly chemical taste of Red Bull when paired alongside the smokey somber richness of a Marlboro Red is noticeably more contrasting and complex. Meant to stimulate the palate and mind, without leaving you to full-filled. Foreshadowing aside , we hope you enjoy ""Seeing Red"" as much as we do.


 Please feel free to add your courses/dishes /etc!  Would love to see what our collective fiendish brains can come up with. 

 Remember, this is just for kicks. Let's have a bit of fun, at our own expense!

1nj77u0,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusesurvivors/comments/1nj77u0/i_31f_dont_know_if_im_seriously_incompatible_with/,I (31F) don't know if I'm seriously incompatible with my partner (33M) or if I am being abused,"My partner and I have been together for three years. He is autistic (not formally diagnosed) and as the relationship has progressed we've had a lot of issues which we've talked about but never seem to be able to resolve.  
  
First are his anger and mood issues. By his own admission he will randomly be triggered by something small that annoys him - a bad driver on the road, a song he doesn't like, a comment I might make, or nothing at all - and it will plunge him into a terrible mood for hours or days. When he has had these bad moods in the past he has had violent outbursts like punching walls and furniture, or snapping (verbally) at me. Our washing machine control panel is broken because he punched it in anger when it was beeping because the wiring is faulty (but he refuses to replace it because it's an unnecessary expense). Occasionally he gets angry when playing video games and punches the coffee table and then goes into a foul mood. Following these outbursts he refuses to speak or gives me one word answers until he's managed to calm down which can take a long time. When he does this it scares me and I've sometimes left the house to get away from his bad moods, which he says just infuriates him even more - from his point of view I just have to let him be angry and act completely normal. He's accepted that the outbursts aren't OK and they occur much less often now, but he still randomly stonewalls me and it makes me feel awful. I've lost count of the number of times I've been looking forward to Christmas, a holiday, or just a weekend and he has randomly gone into one of his moods and the entire event has been spoiled. I don't feel like this stems from actual anger directed at me but from his inability to regulate his emotions and his refusal to see a therapist to deal with them.  
  
I'm very isolated where we live as I moved across country to live with him where neither of us have a support network or friends. He has increasingly struggled with leaving the house and making plans to do stuff together other than playing video games in our free time. He does not like going on dates or doing social things and usually turns down invitations to do things with me and my friends and family when I travel back home. He is very resistant against the idea of moving closer to where we have family and friends because he sees his job as the most important thing in his life and would need to look for a different one if we moved.  
  
Since I moved in with him (about 6 months into the relationship) he has also been very controlling - not with things like visiting my family or friends or jealous behaviour, but with things like what we eat for dinner, groceries we can buy, when I am allowed to put the heating on and how long for, when I can do laundry, not being permitted to use the tumble drier or dishwasher, etc. I contribute to half of all our bills and half of his mortgage but he is extremely anxious about spending money on 'unnecessary' things to the point that it makes my life miserable. I have repeatedly asked to be added to his mortgage since I've been paying into it for two years but he has been really resistant to do so because of his anxieties around money. Like his anger issues, I don't feel like these behaviours stem from a need to control me specifically but his rigid view of the way his daily life must be organised, his food aversion issues, and his sense of comfort with strict routine. However, he doesn't see how unreasonable it is to expect another person to have to follow that routine too. He has admitted he thinks he suffers with agoraphobia and OCD as well as clinical depression but has repeatedly said that it is 'just the person he is' and I have to accept him and 'cut him some slack.'

He briefly went to a free counselling service for a handful of sessions but wrote off therapy entirely when he decided he didn't 'respect' the counsellor enough for therapy to work. He has now, after me threatening to leave, started on antidepressant medication but the early side effects have only made things worse.

I feel like I'm at the end of my tether and I don't know what to do now. I love him and he is great with many other things in the relationship like household management, being responsible and organised, reliability etc. It doesn't help matters that I was in a (much more obviously) abusive relationship for most of my twenties with someone who ultimately had an affair, so my partner's behaviour seems much less serious compared to that. I want to support my partner with the things he struggles with but I feel like he has dragged his feet for far too long knowing how much these issues were affecting me and not doing anything about them. When I finally heard him admit to the GP, during a phone appointment, that he'd had angry outbursts where he'd punched walls etc it finally hit home to me that I'd been spending a significant part of this relationship feeling scared, confused, and unhappy, and that despite his mental health difficulties/autism, it might be time to prioritise my own sanity.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Arizona Diamondbacks vs. San Francisco Giants: A Tale of Two Pitchers and a Toaster Offense**

The Arizona Diamondbacks and San Francisco Giants are set for a September showdown that’s less “epic rivalry” and more “two teams desperately clinging to playoff hope while pretending they’re not.” The Diamondbacks, fresh off a dramatic ninth-inning rally to beat the Giants 6-5 last week, enter as -129 favorites. The Giants? They’re the +109 underdogs, which is basically the MLB version of showing up to a costume party in regular clothes and hoping no one notices.

Let’s parse the numbers like a casino dealer on a coffee high.

### Odds & Implied Probabilities

Arizona’s -129 line implies a 56.3% chance to win (*129 / (129 + 100)*). The Giants’ +109 line implies 48.1% (*100 / (109 + 100)*). Combined, that’s 104.4%—because bookmakers love to nickel-and-dime us into emotional bets. Arizona’s edge? They’ve won 51.8% of games as favorites this season, while the Giants are just 46.8% as underdogs. Not earth-shattering, but enough to make a stathead feel confident placing a bet on the D-backs while sipping a lukewarm coffee from a stadium cup.

### Pitching: Verlander’s Midlife Crisis vs. Pfaadt’s “I’ll Show You” Moment

Arizona’s Brandon Pfaadt (13-8, 5.31 ERA) is the definition of a “journeyman with potential.” His 5.31 ERA isn’t pretty, but his 13 wins suggest he’s the kind of pitcher who thrives when his team’s offense smells blood. Enter the Giants’ Justin Verlander (3-10, 3.94 ERA), a Hall of Fame candidate who’s somehow posting a decent ERA while going 3-10. How? Magic? Luck? A time-traveling slider? Verlander’s record is so baffling, it makes you wonder if he’s pitching for a different team.

Verlander’s 3-10 mark is like a Netflix series with great reviews but no one watching—it’s good, but the wins just aren’t materializing. Meanwhile, Pfaadt’s 13 wins are the result of Arizona’s offense scoring 5.0 runs per game (2nd in the NL). If Pfaadt can avoid turning into a human Jell-O mold (i.e., keeping his ERA in check), the

Context: It all started mid-August this year. 

I was super stressed with life and studies. Like ang dami kong deadlines plus mental breakdowns left and right. 

One night habang nagsscroll ako dito sa reddit, I came across a post from this guy—he said he’s looking for a one-time thing, open to anything, kahit momol lang daw okay na.

I don’t usually reply to those kinds of posts, but that night I was just… tired. Gusto ko lang talaga mag-unwind. So, curious and lowkey desperate for a break, I messaged him.

We exchanged pics. And thank God, he’s actually attractive—clean-cut, singkit eyes, with a really cute smile. Parang ang bait ng aura niya. Then he asked where we could meet, and I suggested somewhere near my place na lang.

Fast forward to our meet-up. He looked just like his pics. And let me tell you—ang bait niya in person. Sobrang light ng vibe. I didn’t feel nervous or unsafe at all. He was soft-spoken, respectful, and super easy to talk to.

BUT THEN… he told me he’s married.

To be fair, he was honest about it from the start naman. No lies, no paasa. And me? I was mentally and emotionally drained. So I told myself, “One time lang naman.”

We grabbed coffee first. Sat down and talked more. Super gentleman niya—he opened doors for me, let me order first, and just made me feel seen. After about an hour, we decided to do CI na. No pressure, no rush.

He was a really good kisser. Yun lang yung nangyari that night. No touching below the belt. He even drove me to my place right after. I thought, “Okay, that was… surprisingly wholesome??”

After that first meet-up, we still talked from time to time. Casual messages lang—kamustahan, konting banter. Nothing too deep. But he always said na he misses me so much and that he can’t forget our kisses.

Two weeks later, he messaged me again and asked if we could meet up. Since I liked how he treated me—and okay fine, na-miss ko rin siya—I said yes.

This time, we did a little more intimacy, pero still no penetration. Still, he was very respectful about boundaries. No pushing. Just… slow and soft. 

Another 2 weeks passed. He messaged again, said he missed me and wanted to see me.
I said yes… but this time I knew I had to end it.

Not because he did anything wrong, but because I could feel myself catching feelings—and that’s not good. Not for me, not for him, and definitely not for the situation we were in.

So why did I like him? Kahit alam kong may asawa na siya?
- He picked me up and drove me to my place.
- He opened and held doors for me.
- He complimented me every time we were together and kahit sa chat. 
- I never had to worry about paying for anything.
- I like the way how he can make my stress and worries disappear, even for just a few hours.

I know, I know… bare minimum ’yan.
Pero ewan ko ba. Ang bilis ko ma-fall.

Minsan kasi, when you’ve been so used to doing everything alone, the smallest act of care and attention can feel like love. Kahit hindi naman talaga.

Minsan you think kaya mo. You think you can keep things casual. Pero the moment someone gives you a little softness, a little care, a little attention… you start catching feelings.

Anyway, I ended it while it was still good. No drama, no expectations. Just memories.

1nj71s2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marketing_China/comments/1nj71s2/chinese_consumers_love_trying_new_food/,Chinese consumers love trying new food,"# 

I’ve been living in China for a while, and one thing I can say with certainty: **Chinese consumers love trying new food.** Walk into any supermarket here and you’ll see aisles packed with imported snacks, chocolates, dairy, and drinks that weren’t even available five years ago. The pace of change is insane.

# [The Golden Age to Export Food to China Is NOW! ](https://seoagencychina.com/golden-age-to-export-food-in-china-is-now/)

As an expat, I’ve had this weird double life: on one hand, I miss the taste of home (cheese, craft beer, olive oil, even cereal). On the other hand, I’m constantly surprised to find more and more of those products on shelves in Beijing or Shanghai. And the kicker? Locals are buying them too — not just the expat crowd.

Why is *now* the golden age to export food to China? A few reasons stand out from what I’ve seen firsthand:

https://i.redd.it/54wed3mllopf1.gif

1. **Rising Middle Class = Rising Appetite** Ten years ago, imported food was a luxury. Now it’s aspirational but accessible. I’ve watched my local friends happily pay double for “foreign” cookies or baby formula because they trust the quality.
2. **Health & Safety Concerns** Food scandals in the past have made Chinese consumers very cautious. Many trust imported products more, especially in categories like dairy, infant formula, wine, and health supplements. A brand from abroad often carries an automatic halo of “safe” and “premium.”
3. **Social Media Drives Trends** This one blows my mind. A single viral video on Xiaohongshu can sell out a product in days. I once saw a random Australian oat milk brand become a “must-have coffee companion” overnight because an influencer called it “hipster milk.” That kind of speed doesn’t happen anywhere else.
4. **Diversity Is Cool** Chinese consumers are curious. They want to try new flavors, new formats, even things that seem strange at first. (My Chinese colleague now eats hummus regularly, something he’d never heard of before last year!) This openness makes it a perfect time to introduce global foods.

# But here’s the honest truth: it’s not all sunshine.

 I’ve also seen brands crash and burn here because they assumed Chinese consumers would just “get it.” They didn’t adapt packaging, flavors, or communication. They ignored e-commerce and hoped a distributor would do all the work. Big mistake.

https://preview.redd.it/iz4w5k0olopf1.jpg?width=663&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=eeac73b82a6e82bcbc427e6df9c87ab0e9bbd528

From my perspective, if you want to succeed in China’s food market right now, you need three things:

* **Localization**: Sometimes it’s as simple as smaller pack sizes or flavors like lychee, matcha, or taro.
* **Storytelling**: Consumers love authenticity. Tell the origin story of your brand — why your honey is pure, why your wine is unique.
* **Social Media Power**: Forget traditional advertising. You need to live on Douyin, Xiaohongshu, and WeChat. If no one is talking about your brand online, you basically don’t exist here.



My opinion? If you’re sitting abroad wondering whether to export to China, stop hesitating. The demand is here, the consumer curiosity is here, and the tools to reach them are better than ever. Sure, it’s competitive — but I’ve never seen a market this hungry (literally) for new products.

I sometimes joke with friends: living in China feels like watching food trends on fast-forward. What takes five years to catch on back home can explode in five weeks here. That’s why I really believe: **the golden age to export food to China isn’t coming — it’s already here.**",1,1758095882.0,Marketing_China,0,1.0,False

1nj6wzb,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1nj6wzb/eu_timemore_240_timemore_bricks_01s_eu_timemore/,[EU Timemore 240]   Timemore Bricks 01S   [EU Timemore 240],"While I was pondering worriedly about how much buyer's remorse and how much wifely annoyance I would engender by buying a Lagom Casa grinder at about 653 euros I noticed an advert stating that Timemore Europe had 50 Bricks 01s grinders in stock and that they were offering 20% discount and free delivery.  I quickly accessed their website and was amazed to see that the price would then be only about 240 euros - a lot more forgivable price!

There immediately ensued 2 days of exhaustive review scanning and finally Josh's HisBrewroastery review on YT convinced me.  I opened it early Monday morning, made 2 cups of coffee at 0.4 setting and 0.6 setting.  Both choked my BDB so I transferred the grounds into my french press and drank the tasty muddy coffee water.  Finally at my 3rd attempt on Monday I got an appropriate shot - 25 gms in, about 65 gms out after 45 seconds, at a grinder setting of 1.2.  In view of the fact that I not supposed to drink coffee at all I stopped guzzling coffee!

Tuesday saw 2 more brews using the Monday 3rd recipe.  Lovely strong 1:3 and 1:4 lattes, but I did feel that I could do a bit better.  (And was becoming a tiny bit dizzy with the Caffeine!)

This Wednesday morning I tried 24gms at the same grinder setting. 24 gms in, 50 ml out, after the BDB's preset 30 seconds plus the extra 5 seconds I added because the output still wasn't ""blonde enough"".  Sipping the actual shot was lovely, and after adding the 1:3 amount of warm milk it was just the way I like it but also a better tasting milky coffee than I have ever had before.  That was about an hour ago and I am itching to make another soon.

To summarise, the Bricks 01S gives a really nice conical burr espresso drink, using single country of origin Honduras beans from my current favourite roaster, the Galway Roast, in Ireland.  Exactly as they describe it.  "" A bold and creamy coffee with a balanced after taste"".

The grinder's build is solid as a rock, mainly metal and doesn't seem to wander about on the worktop as it grinds.  Retention is very low and the grind looks very consistent, no rubble or talcum powder!  Even though Josh comments about the noise, it is much quieter than the Sage Smart Grinder Pro and the Eureka Mignon Manuale I also own.  (I have too many grinders!)  It is also faster than both.  I didn't use the included spritz bottle and it wasn't necessary, perhaps Ireland on a rainy day doesn't need any help with static.

I am now waiting for my delivery today of some decaff beans from Galway Roast so I can have another couple of lattes.  Or maybe 4 or 6...",1,1758095330.0,espresso,0,1.0,False
1nj6wd1,https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/1nj6wd1/i_am_being_rediculous_and_i_wrote_it_out_to_prove/,I am being rediculous (and I wrote it out to prove it to myself),"I just don't think I realise if I want to get everything done that I want to in a typical wfh day (or think I ought to) then it would be go-go-go from the moment I get up, military tight schedule every day all day until I go to bed. So no wonder I am 

a) not getting it all done and;
b) feel exhausted and massively restricted when I try 

Not that I'm saying planning my time down to the last 5min is a good idea for me, even if I do live alone and have complete control but I don't think I actually acknowledge the realities, if you know what I mean? I took to pen and paper ....

6am to 10pm is 16 hours (or 960 minutes).

And I am subconsciously thinking I can:

🔸Work (wfh) - 7 hours (420min)

🔸Music practice in music room - 120 mins 

🔸Reflective planning music practice for tomorrow, listening back to my recordings of that day, identifying areas to work on, mapping out work and when I am going to do it, so I am prepared at rehearsals for solo lessons, orchestra, quartet etc - 45min

🔸Walk dog - 120 min

🔸Seeing mum - 90 mins

🔸Keeping on top of housework/laundry etc- 60 min

🔸Stretching my aging body 45mins

🔸Showering, getting dressed properly, personal hygiene doing teeth etc 60min (30 mins each end of day?)

🔸cook and eat - prob 60 min, I eat simply. 

That's OVER at 990 minutes. That's even assuming I don't go to the toilet or make an extra cup of coffee or nip out to get bread! Not even scheduling it out, the maths, the basic maths just does not add up. 🚨

This exercise has been useful and I need adjust my expectations. And I mean really adjust them, if I don't want to feel like I'm on a military camp every day at home. Has anyone else done this and it made a difference?

1nj6vjs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marketing_China/comments/1nj6vjs/chinese_tourists_opportunities_challenges/,Chinese Tourists :Opportunities & Challenges,"I’ve traveled quite a bit in Southeast Asia, and one thing that always stands out is how much of the tourism scene now depends on Chinese travelers. I remember being in Siem Reap a few years back — the temples were packed with tour groups snapping photos faster than I could sip my iced coffee. At first, it felt overwhelming, but then I realized: those crowds were also keeping dozens of restaurants, tuk-tuk drivers, and hotels in business. The sheer scale of Chinese tourism is both an opportunity and a challenge.

On one hand, it’s undeniable that local economies benefit hugely. A busload of tourists means cash flowing into local businesses that might otherwise struggle. On the other hand, there are issues: overcrowding, strain on infrastructure, and sometimes cultural friction. I’ve seen guides whisper “please don’t touch” at least 30 times in 10 minutes.

Personally, I think the challenge isn’t “Chinese tourists” as a group, but how destinations manage mass tourism in general. Whether it’s Chinese, European, or American visitors, the problem starts when too many people arrive in places that aren’t designed for it. With better planning, everyone wins.

My takeaway? Tourism is like hotpot : amazing if you manage the ingredients properly, but throw everything in at once and you’ll just end up with a mess.

1nj6sxw,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1nj6sxw/my_intrusive_thoughts_are_making_life_harder_to/,My intrusive thoughts are making life harder to manage,"Hi all, I just need to get this off my chest because at this point I really can't bounce back like I use to and I just need to throw up all of the thoughts. I'm sorry if this is long, makes no sense, and has shitty grammar but this is literally a free flow of thoughts as I cry at work praying I don't have to help other people right now while I can't help myself.

I'm a 25F. The last seven years has been pretty fucking stupid, and I feel like an asshole for complaining and having this depressing thoughts about my life considering I've worked jobs where clients have literally told me horrible things. I graduated HS in 2018, and it seems like that perfect life I've been chasing has slapped me every chance its gotten and at this point I'm so low I'm doubting all of my decisions, fights, career paths, relationships, friendships, and just everything in my life. Also I've lost a shit ton of positive and encouraging influences in my life the last few years. In 2019 my dog of 13 years died and I know after that my emotional state has never been right.

I graduated college in 2022. The pandemic really did a number on my mental health, I became an alcoholic, I let all of the built up resentment for my dad come out to the point where we physically fought and I got put out during a pandemic, I forgot how to socialize in person I can't maintain eye contact and my stutter is back. That pandemic put a strain on a relationship I developed in college, let's call him T. That strain continued after college as well, I agreed to work for T's mother at a youth detention center, where she promised me a lot of growth opportunity and help. I should have known this woman was insane after things T would tell me but she looked my parents in the eye and told them she would be there for me. She was helpful, training opportunities and everything, I also was not security I was reentry staff and I loved it and the youth. It was my calling, but T's mother made it very clear eventually she didn't give a crap about what happened to me once the turnover rate for security started to become unmanageable, and it was all her fault. But to save time I was eventually forced into security working 16 hour days 5 days a week and sometimes 6 to finish my reentry work and guard units. Eventually I started to be bullied by a few older women to the point where it made my job impossible and dangerous, because I would always get injured after these women pissed youth off but decided to call me in to deescalate or start a restraint because I was ""young"" or ""bigger"" so it was suppose to be easy for me to restrain youth. I was injured so much I finally was confronted by the women bullying me and I lost it and quit. The women followed me to my office which was on a unit to try to finish the conversation, my female inmates in the unit could see I was upset and almost started an emergency on the unit to get the women to leave me alone. I tried to speak to T's mother about everything to clear the air but her response made it perfectly clear that she didn't care, and since T was taking my side more and more his mother decided to be more of a b\*\*\*\*. I couldn't let him destroy his only parental relationship, so we drifted apart. I feel horrible, I still think about him and wonder will I ever find decent love like that again.

After leaving that job I was unemployed for awhile, and found a job at a rehab. It was a very shitty rehab but I tried my best to make the clients happy and to help in recovery as a group facilitator and a supervised clinician. Around this same time Satan himself decided to join my life, and slowly suck the rest the good out of my life. I also was starting graduate school. I was going through a lot but I made sure Satan was satisfied in our relationship, until he demonstrated why I don't want to trust nor love anyone ever again. I got very sick randomly, my gallbladder needed to be removed and for months I could not recover. My stomach would hurt, I would need the bathroom a lot more, and constant physical relations like always was not an option anymore. Satan grew more and more annoyed by this to the point where he started making stuff up about me cheating, starting fights when I couldn't have physical relations and when I gave my friends ""more"" attention. I tried leaving so many times but Satan is good at the cycle of abuse, to point where I relied on alcohol all over again and he wanted me drunk so I would let my boundaries down to have physical relations. He also started to tell friends and family of his that I had already met about our issues, I'm pretty sure he did not tell them the whole story but if he did and they still encouraged his bad behavior they are to blame too. His friends and mother would talk down about how I'm not a good partner because I don't lay on my back enough, I payed more attention to my career and school than him, and I should be ashamed for having a few good friends I considered family ""technically above him""( his words and I never said this). I put aside so much for him, and I stay through so much. Every argument, every time he showed up somewhere thinking I was cheating then blaming me, I even stayed after he told me what his mother and friends now thought about me. I stayed through his insecurities, his alcoholism, and when he had no money, I spent a lot on this guy. These things were not done with out an argument back from me though, I can be pretty tough and tbh he deserved it. I thought we had talked a lot of our problems through and agreed on ways to fix it, three days later he broke it off over text because after that conversation I did not want to sex in the back of his small car because my stomach hurt after eating. Two months later, I found out he had been cheating on me the last few months of our relationship with the girl he told me not to worry about and he called her a wh\*\*\* for jumping from man to man in their military squad and cheating on one of his best friends. Now they have been dating happily for almost a year like nothing happened. This girl smiled in my face giving me advice about Satan, but was having physical relations with him while they were on deployment. There's more detail to the story but I truly believe his last goal was to make me feel as heartless as him in terms of how I saw the world. And he achieved. He said I didn't meet his standards of a woman, for physical relations or who/what I put first in life(we weren't even together a year when he started this argument). However he turned around to date a woman who he talked so much negative things about and woman like her, and I mean the bare parts of her like being White, dressing very flirtatious while out at a club, and calling her a wh\*\*\* for sleeping around(which I told him I did the same thing when I was this girl's age and single and SO DID HE). I really do pray for that young girl, but maybe she satisfies his physical relation needs to the point where he doesn't think she's a cheater and liar ""like me"". I know he is a hypocrite, an abuser, a cheater, a manipulator, an alcoholic, and a physical relations addict I know, but after everything that happened to me I have not been able to bounce back to reality of having a heart. I usually can. Why can't I find my spark anymore? I physically don't enjoy physical relations, not even intimacy. The break up was in the fall of 2024. I'm still not mentally right.

The break up text was sent when I was moving into my new apartment, an hour away from friends, and family. Satan was considered my best friend, he knew that and he made sure of that. My actual best friend of 15 years, B, she was helpful during the break up. She hated him, she brought me flowers and a card with encouraging words. I moved and I felt alone, I really was losing my mind to a point where I wanted to end my life, I tried going to the hospital but I couldn't get myself to go. So I called my B and my mother every day but when I was alone, at work, trying to sleep, or evening driving I just kept crying and having louder intrusive thoughts. I stopped drinking thank god, but I don't know if that would have been better than crying so hard to the point where I fell asleep. I was drained by the end of 2024, I tried dating again which was so stupid to do while I was still hurting. The guy ghosted me after a few months and I don't blame him, I was not myself. I had a new job that had screwed me over by not giving me the signing bonus due to some bs, I was working nights there and working mid-shifts virtually for the rehab job, and at some point B started a fight with me.

My world was really coming apart without talking to B, but even through she was my best friend there had been so many things in that 15yrs that I was able to tolerate, I always picked her over anything she was my only sister basically. But I was done being casted aside by her every time she had an ounce of male attention, considering she is very pretty and gets male attention every where I don't know why she acts this way. She talked to me absolutely crazy after her birthday because her new bf couldn't take a joke back. On her birthday like always I do everything to make sure she's happy. Her new bf was mad disrespectful to her all night, but I calmed the guard dog in me until I was about to leave. He told me to hurry up tying those big a\*\* boots, so B and I can go to our room. Mind you, he does not pay rent nor live there its her place. I replied to him, ""I don't remember this being your place."" He complained to B about ""my mouth"" and B called me the next day to tell me ""don't ever speak to my man like that again"" and some other things but that was the only line that replays in my head. I just simply said ""okay""and just did not talk to her. She never tried to talk about the situation, just texted me like it never happened, so I just never replied because I knew I would lose my temper. Until one day she rudely asked me why I was not talking to her, I told her that because I love her I needed space to process and not to go off on her. She cursed me out, and I was like that's it, I told her I do not need someone in my life who will allow a man to talk about me needing to ""watching my mouth"" and allow her to speak to me so disrespectfully. I didn't care that she was creating a boundary, I was mad that she found it so easy to speak to me that way and also not ask me my side of the story considering she was so wasted. So I lost my friend of 15yrs. I put up with a lot over the years but for me to literally always chose her in and never just speak to her any kind of way, especially after some of the very uncomfortable situations due to her male centered behavior in nightlife.

I changed jobs again and now I work completely over night, this job has treated me like crap. I work at a walk-in crisis center as a clinician. Ive been left alone on this shift since May, no supervisor, no help. I see all the clients between 8pm-6am M-Th night. I get  b\*\*\*\*ed  at when I call out due to feeling burnt out or sick, I get talked b\*\*\*\*ed at when I take month in advanced scheduled time off, I get looked at side ways when I try to report concerns to a supervisor or director, and I've been denied for extra pay, and the supervisor title twice for really BS reasons. 1) I haven't been here a year, but they hired multiple new supervisors with less educational and experience than me. 2) They said it was premature, but still let me run a building by myself all night. 3) I'm not done with grad school, none of the supervisors have their grad degrees or a mental health license of some kind. I just don't understand it Because if they didn't trust me why leave me alone for this long, no one else in the basic entry position is left to work full shifts alone but me. My sleep is nonexistent. I don't sleep after work because my mind its racing with intrusive thoughts about the last few years of my life or things going on in present day US. On the weekends I sleep all day to the point where I don't even eat for 24 hours, because I just asleep. Coffee, energy drinks, and tea do not work.

I started seeing a psychiatrist in July who finally confirmed my diagnoses of Bipolar, she has not specifically said 1 or 2 which haunts me because manic episodes run in my family. She has given me meds to sleep and to regulate my emotions but nothing helps. I do see a therapist, I exercise, I try to squeeze in hobbies/ coping skills but I do not see regulation. I've worked in mental health for six years now, and the things I've told my clients and things I've learned from bosses with LPCs and CSWs is not working. I was feeling okay in June and July but damn everything hurts and races through my head to the point where I just want to scream, hit something, and cry. I'm so anxious I can't sit still my mind doesn't even shut down when I take Seroquel. I really feel sick and tired of everything. I think constantly about why I can't be happy, I think about why the fuck does Satan deserve to be happy. I think about why am I wasting this much time and money in school for no benefit. I think about the fact that being around people is so much harder for me. I overthink about the world. I think my entire life is a waste of space and time.

I think about my life since HS so much and how much my emotional regulation and hopes and dreams have just faded away. I was so much stronger. I'm not motivated to continue on to find out if I'm going to be happy one day. I feel like for all of my life I have drained my cup into helping others and I feel like I can't catch a break to live in peace. I'm overworked and too hyper independent to even think about asking for help with things. often think about SI but I try to distract myself. I'm sorry that this is so long I just really needed to get this out of my mind right now, so I can try to finish my shift without needing to go home. I have therapy after work so I'm going to try to get a pumpkin spice latte and listen to Tame Impala very loud on my way there.

TL:DR- I've gone through a lot of mess the last few years, had to leave the love of my life, started dating an abuser to took me down to their level of hating the world, I have been putting a lot of my energy into my career of helping others but not myself, and I really don't have a social support to notice what's going on. I don't know what to do in life and I feel like my life is a waste.",1,1758094887.0,offmychest,1,1.0,False

I see no trash cans in hallways, reception, lounges, or any common area, and even the rooms themselves have this tiny cans with no bags.

In reception i was eating an icecream, which was all melted and disgustingly sticky by the time i wanted to throw it away. No trash cans to be seen. I asked where i can find one, and an employee said ""give it to me"" and extended his hand.  
I find it embarassing for employees to have to give them my disgusting melted sticky ice cream in their hand.

Even in lounges i have nowhere to throw the wet stick used to stir coffee or the opened little cream packets. Every single time i have ever asked for a trash can, the answer has been ""give it to me"" and extending their hand. Obviously employees are trained for this but i find it embarassing.

If i want to take any trash out of my room, the only option is to leave all my smelly stuff right there by my door. As i was walking down the hallway last night, i saw several trash bags of people who ordered food and then left the bags outside their room.

So my honest question is: What is the point of not having trash cans? There certainly must be a reason for it which i can't think of? What is the benefit of not having them?

P.S: 99% of my travel is outside USA , so not sure if this applies in USA as well.  
P.S2: I am NOT complaining, before all employees start downvoting and saying ""oh you entitled elite guest, if you want trash cans then go to long stay apartments or airbnb"". I am just asking a question out of curiosity.",3,1758094665.0,marriott,6,0.8,False

I couldn’t even ask for something else… just gave a weird look and told me to ""shoo"".. I just stepped aside and ordered a coffee instead. Just sat by the window with it, but it didn’t taste like much. Everyone else had their meals, laughing and enjoying themselves, and there I was just sipping something I didn’t even want.

An hour later, his secretary, Blaire Evans, posted:  
  
""Mr. Wheeler is unbelievable—I’m on a diet! How am I supposed to finish two iced lattes?""  
  
Dahlia’s eyes flicked to the receipt, but Zavier Wheeler casually snatched his phone back.  
  
""The app glitched earlier, so Blaire’s address defaulted. Now she’s stuck with two lattes—what a pain.""  
  
Face blank, Dahlia turned and unlocked the safe behind her, Zavier’s dismissive tone still hanging in the air.  
  
""You should’ve checked before ordering.""  
  
As he spoke, she pulled out a document, signed the last page, and handed it to him.  
  
Zavier’s expression iced over at ""Divorce Agreement.""  
  
""Over a wrong address?""  
  
""Over a wrong address,"" Dahlia confirmed without looking up.  
  
Instead of taking it, Zavier scoffed and sprawled across the office couch.  
  
""Dahlia, this was just PR when we married. My parents handed it to you as a formality—not for you to weaponize.""  
  
The document was barely a few pages, but Zavier couldn’t be bothered to read it. To him, it had always been corporate theater.  
  
Clutching the papers, Dahlia stepped forward.  
  
""I’ve signed. You do the same, and we’re done.""  
  
""Seriously? Over this?""  
  
Five years with Zavier had taught her that edge in his voice—patience thinning.  
  
""Let’s not pretend. You married for money. Who knows what strings you pulled? Without my parents forcing this, I wouldn’t have bothered. That agreement protected the Wheeler name—not you. Don’t flatter yourself.""  
  
She almost laughed.  
  
He had no idea she’d demanded that agreement as a condition.  
  
He swatted at the papers.  
  
""You’ll forgive employees for tanking projects but not one slip-up of mine?""  
  
""One slip-up?""  
  
Dahlia dodged his hand, her sudden laugh freezing him. His gaze sharpened as she flipped to the agreement’s first page.  
  
""Five signatures needed. I decided: every twenty times I forgave you, I’d sign once. Five years covered all five.""  
  
The first—their wedding night, Zavier at a bar, ""catching up with friends.""  
  
The second—their first family visit, humiliating her publicly: ""They can arrange the marriage, not force me to love you.""  
  
The seventieth—the day she gave birth, while he toasted his secretary’s new home.  
  
Zavier thumbed through, pausing at the dried tearstain by the second signature. A beat later, he tossed the papers aside.  
  
""It’s just coffee. Want some? I’ll have it delivered now—ten times the fee, someone’ll take it.""  
  
Dahlia pushed the agreement toward him, voice steady.

*UEFA Champions League, 17 September 2025 – Allianz Arena, Munich*

**The Odds: A Mathematical Masterclass**  
Let’s cut to the chase: Bayern Munich is the statistical favorite here, and the numbers don’t lie. The bookmakers are pricing Bayern at **1.67 to 1.74 (decimal odds)**, translating to an implied **56.7% to 57.5% chance of victory**. For context, that’s like being 90% sure your Wi-Fi will cut out during a Zoom call but still pretending it’s fine. Chelsea, meanwhile, is a **4.3 to 4.6 underdog**, implying a **21.7% to 22.2% chance**—about the same odds as surviving a family holiday dinner without crying. The draw? A **23.3% to 25%** shot, which is roughly the probability of finding a parking spot in a stadium 10 minutes before kickoff.

**The News: Pensioners, Fourth Place, and a World Title**  
Last season, Bayern Munich hoisted the Bundesliga trophy like a German bartender serving the best beer in town. They’re the reigning kings of Bavaria, and they’re not here to make friends. Chelsea, on the other hand, finished fourth in the Premier League—a respectable but underwhelming achievement, akin to ordering a “medium” at a buffet and still feeling hungry.

But here’s the kicker: *retirees won the Club World Championship in 2025*. Yes, the grandmasters of the soccer world, sipping their coffee and reminiscing about their prime, took home the trophy. Does this mean anything for Bayern vs. Chelsea? Not directly, b

He’s been courting me for five months. There was a time he asked me if I would finally say yes to him. I told him to be patient, because even then, I already had suspicions. He was sweet, caring, made a lot of effort, and always insisted on covering our expenses whenever we went out. But after three months, I noticed a change. In a whole week, he would only message me once online.

We study at the same school, yet he somehow didn’t want people to know who I was to him. On top of that, there was this girl who always commented on his indirect posts on Facebook—my friends even sent me screenshots. But, every time I confront him— he denies it, so I trusted him…

One day, I went to his apartment— this was a day before our dance performance at school, it was a competition. We were cuddling, I was holding his phone because I was watching a video of him performing as a vocalist in a local band. Suddenly, a chat-head popped up, profile of the girl whom i asked him countless of times “Who is she?”, his answers were always: “She’s just a friend,” “She’s a friend of a friend, that’s why we got close,” “We took the entrance exam together at CSU with my friend.” And yet here we were.

The message read: “Luv, jwu. I don’t think I’ll attend class today. Fck.”* I still remember it vividly. He grabbed the phone from me right away and asked if I had read anything. Deep inside, I wanted to scream, to yell at him, to curse him, to let all my anger out. But I answered calmly: “Yes,” while I began packing my things. He started explaining, saying they just called each other “luv” as best friends, the same way I had close nicknames with my gay best friends. He said it was nothing more, nothing less. But all I could do was smile at him and say I’d go back to my apartment. I didn’t let him hug me, didn’t allow even a single touch. I simply said, “I’ll go ahead,” and quietly left his apartment. 

That night, I wanted to ask the girl if she knew he was pursuing me—if she knew I was part of this story. But I was too drained. At dawn, he called me, demanding that I express my feelings—asking what I truly felt after what I read. I told him honestly. And that was the end of the courtship.

It was already bright outside, yet I never slept. I just sat blankly on my bed. Instead of thinking about the competition the next day, my mind kept replaying the message, confirming my suspicions. It was overwhelming.

That night, I opened Instagram and saw his story. My heart sank—it was a picture of them on a date, after a theater show. The confusing part? He had never posted me before. Then I checked the girl’s story—it was the same picture. Her caption read: “Nearing our 1st monthsary.”

It shattered me into pieces.

Was I the “other woman” all along?

I confronted him. I asked why he entertained me if he already had a girlfriend. His response was confusing—he said he loved me, but he wasn’t sure, so that’s why he did what he did. I told him many times before: just be honest with me about how you see me. Don’t make a fool out of me. But that’s exactly what he did. I never replied to him again.

The day after our performance, I suddenly bled heavily. My lower stomach hurt so badly, the pain in my private parts was unbearable. I rushed back to my apartment, writhing in pain. I stayed in the bathroom for almost an hour. Out of curiosity, I checked what my body had expelled—and I was shocked to see a fetus.

My heart pounded so loudly. My mind flashed back to two months ago, when my friends kept teasing me that my symptoms looked like signs of pregnancy. I had been going back and forth to the hospital before—for peptic ulcer, UTI, anemia, and LRD—plus my struggles with mental health. They said I was gaining weight, but I dismissed it since I was eating a lot. The morning sickness? I had felt that for a year already, from lack of sleep and irregular meals. Even my delayed period wasn’t unusual—I was often late by two or even three months. So, it never crossed my mind that I was pregnant.

But the question now is: Did something happen between us?

Remember when I said I noticed he suddenly changed? Before that, there was a night I can never forget. He was the first man I allowed to pursue me. One night, he asked if I was available because it was his cousin’s birthday and they were celebrating at his apartment. I said yes.

When we arrived, he told me we’d “hang out” on the third floor. That floor was under renovation, so I was confused. His room and the celebration were on the second floor. He didn’t answer, just dragged me into an empty room and then out to the balcony, before pulling me back in. He made me sit on the lower bunk of a bedframe without a mattress. It was awkward—at least for me. I begged him to go back downstairs because I didn’t feel comfortable. But he just stared at me.

Then he suddenly grabbed me aggressively, kissed me forcefully, shoved his tongue into my mouth. His hands roamed my body. I started crying because I didn’t know what to do—his grip was so tight, I felt like I would break. He forced me to lie on the plywood bedframe. I cried harder, fought back with kicks, scratches, and punches, but it was useless. He was bigger, stronger. He forced himself into me.

I screamed, I wailed. After a minute or two, he stopped—as if he suddenly realized what he was doing. He quickly moved away, fixed himself, and even fixed my clothes. I couldn’t move, couldn’t process it. But I forced myself to get up and stagger down the stairs until I reached the highway. He didn’t chase me. For a week, I never left my apartment—it was exam week, but I couldn’t face anyone. I kept telling myself it didn’t happen. I didn’t know what to do, who to go to. I didn’t feel safe.

When I finally went back to school, my classmates were worried. I just smiled like nothing happened. I never told anyone what he did. Not even my friends. Then suddenly my closest friend approached me, saying he had begged for a week to come see me. I never told him my exact apartment, but he roughly knew the area.

We went to my friend’s boarding house where he showed me gifts supposedly from him—for me. Apparently, the reason why no one ever questioned why I had vanished for a week— specially during exam week, was because he excused my absences by saying my health (my ulcer) had worsened and my mental state suffered.

That day, I agreed to meet with him at a local coffee shop. He was asking for forgiveness, that he will make it up to me, that he regretted what he did. I gave him another chance…

AND THAT WAS THE MOST STUPID THING I HAVE EVER DONE. 

A week after my miscarriage, the pain didn’t stop, and the bleeding continued. A checkup revealed I had an incomplete miscarriage, so I needed surgery. Because of all the hospital visits, I missed my finals and comprehensive exams. My grades dropped drastically, even failing one major subject.

I also found out that the same month he assaulted me was the month he started courting that girl.

Months later, I kept all of this hidden, but a rumor spread about me taking a pelvic test. My friends grew suspicious, and I had no choice but to explain everything. But a month later, they started ignoring me one by one. By the end of the first semester, they had cut me off completely. They greeted each other, but skipped me. When I spoke, they glanced at each other as if deciding who would bother replying.

By the last month of the semester, I stopped chasing them. My ulcer caused internal bleeding, and I had to prepare for surgery. I dropped out for the second semester because both the physical and mental toll was too much. I left without saying goodbye, even though I held three club positions. For the first time, I felt I could justify my wrong decision.

I know—it’s my fault that I gave him another chance after everything. But am I not allowed to grieve? I won’t deny my mistake. But the way people talk to me, it’s as if I have no right to feel anything because I “let it happen.”

One of my so-called friends even told others behind my back: “It’s impossible she was raped. She wanted it. She even went back to him.” 

This was all a year ago, and looking back— I feel like a hypocrite, people made me feel like a hypocrite. I stand by the saying “You deserve what you tolerate” and I don’t deny the fact that I am to blame for what it cost me, but never did I ever liked to be raped. 

I know my hands built this ruin, but does that mean I’m unworthy of being called a victim? My choices carved the wound, yet the pain still bleeds the same.",0,1758094170.0,confession,0,0.25,False
1nj6lj6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1nj6lj6/things_just_arent_making_sense_about_why_we_are/,Things just aren't making sense about why we are separated,"I (33M) and my wife (38F) have been married since May 2024. Our wedding day was the happiest day of my life. She's got two kids to other fathers. Last Saturday, she asked for an amicable split, this came after me losing my temper on Friday night.

Last October, we had a weekend away in another city. One night, we both decided to go to the strippers together. We were approached, and my wife paid for the both of us to have a private show. Later that night, after 2 or 3 drinks and on a false high from what had happened, I said something along the lines of ""*I'd happily have a threesom with her*"" without actually meaning it

The 10 hour drive home the next day was quiet. The next day at work, we spoke on the phone about that night, and about what I said. I told her that I didn't mean what I said, but that going to the strippers felt like having a relapse on my porn addiction. We worked things out and both agreed to put in more effort in.

A couple of weeks later, while I was at work on a Saturday night, she went out to dinner with a friend of hers. I knew about this beforehand, because she asked me 3 or 4 times if I was okay with her going out for dinner and each time I said yes. After dinner, she drove her friend home, and went inside to see the friends husband. The friend and husband are swingers. They hit her up for a threesom, and she said no, but stayed and watched. She didn't tell me about this until the next morning while we were having a coffee in bed. I didn't know how to react or process this at the time, and kind of just moved on from it.

fast forward to April, we decided to try for a baby, and this was the first time we had sex since Oct/Nov. about 4 weeks later (start of May) she was positive on a pregnancy test. We were both happy, but a week later, she had a miscarriage at the 5 week mark. She took the miscarriage very hard, and I tried to urge her to talk to get help with her mental health, however she said ""I'll think about it"" as a possible stalling tactic.

I didn't handle the miscarriage in my own way, and I was working more than I usually would. 4x day shifts and 3-4x night shifts each week. I think it was a distraction for me, and I thought maybe the money would be good to help our family financially, but I think I got caught up with focusing on the money.

Around July, we went for breakfast one morning, and she was visibly down, I asked her what was wrong and she told me that ""*every time she looked at me, all she thought about was the miscarriage*"" and that it was hurting her. I tried again to encourage her to talk to someone, and that I'd be right by her side to take that first step in asking for help.

We communication levels declined a lot, but we still spoke regardless.

Around the start of August, her youngest kids father told us that he and his partner we're successful with their round of IVF. About two weeks later, they then told us that they lost the baby. My wife messaged me separately, saying ""wow! that was big news!"" and I responded with ""*that sucks! But it doesn't affect us*"" meaning that have ourselves to focus on.

We had a week-long trip booked in another city, this was supposed to be our honeymoon. Initially, we were both very excited about it when we first discussed it back in March, and we both were going to wait until July to book things. When I asked her if she still wanted to go, she said ""*yeah, I guess*"".

We then went to the tax agent on Friday midday, turns out I owe some tax money and I told her I have an expensive car service coming up. she suggested we cancel the holiday and book at a later time.

We got home on Friday afternoon after attending swimming lessons for her youngest, and she had a parcel delivered. An online clothes o*rder. I asked ""Did you get more clothes? what are they for?*"" thinking nothing of it. She told me ithey're for an engagement party that we have coming up in October, to which I said I didn't know about that. She said she did tell me, and that there was an invitation on the fridge, I told her that she infact didn't tell me, and I asked what the date was so I could take the day off work. I was getting frustrated because I caught her lying and she continued to tell me that she did tell me. I then said ""I'll take the fucking day off work"" while walking away.

I was overwhelmed, because I don't like raising my voice or confrontation and I was disappointed at myself for swearing at her. I shut down and didn't talk to her for the rest of the evening.

The next morning, she continued on with her day without me, dropping the youngest off at his dads house, then taking the elded off to get a haircut. I left the house to go to the shops to get some things and a haircut as well.

When I came home, I was in our bedroom sorting out my clothes. she came in and said ""*I'm not coming to the family dinner tonight""* and I said that it was fine and that I didn't expect her to. I then said ""*I'm ready to talk when you are""*

I told her that I haven't felt loved for the last 10 months, and she agreed. She asked when it was, and I told her it was that night in November when she went out with her swinger friends and straight away she said ""N*o. No. thats not it at all*"" and she said for her it was the night we went to the strippers and what I said, she held on to the whole time. She said that she has struggled with the miscarriage and that everytime she looks at me that its all she can think about. She told me she didn't like the constant fighting. She then asked for all of this to be amicable.

I told her that I would do whatever I would need to, to save the marriage. I asked her if she would be interested in Marriage Councelling, and she said that it wasn't an option.

She offered for me to stay the night and I can pack some things in the morning, but I told her I needed to get out of the house and pacled some things.

I called in on Sunday to get a few more things that I needed straight away (medication, toiletries etc) to take with me back to my parents.

Aside from asking for marriage counceling, I haven't begged her for me to stay etc...

Yesterday, she messaged me telling me she would need me to sign some things to take my name off the mortgage. I didn't respond until this morning. She sent another message this afternoon asking when I would be up her way, or if it would be easier for her to drive down to me so I can sign. I didn't respond, 10 minutes later she called, I told her that my appointment is up near her (I didn't tell her it was a psychiatrist appointment) and I asked if we could meet up somewhere nuetral.

I am considering asking her tomorrow if she would be okay with having a mature conversation. I don't think she will, because it seems like she is trying to cut all ties very quickly and push me away very quickly.

1nj6k7d,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nj6k7d,I made my first terrarium. Can I have some advice? I have some questions below the pictures,"This is my first terrarium. Aside from the creeping fig, I just used fittonias because I read that they do well in terrariums. Also, the little white mark at the bottom of the jar isn't mold, it's just the light reflection (please ignore the dog hair inside it, I didn't notice until afterwards). I have the plants stored in a miniature greenhouse from Bunnings Warehouse. Is this a good long term storage solution for the plants? I plan to water them with spring water in a spray bottle every couple of days.

I took the moss from outside and washed it, dried it gently by squeezing out the excess, then placed it in damp sphagnum moss for a few days in a tub. Is this a good way to store moss long-term for future builds? 

I've only just put the plants in, but I did put the moss in three days ago. It did fog up quite a lot over the past few days, and I'm expecting it to fog up again soon. How much fog or mist is good? Does anyone have any photos of their own terrariums fog so I can see an example of a healthy fogging? 

The lights are from Amazon. They're on a 12 hour timer. Is this a good light cycle for the plants? The other options are 8 hours and 4 hours, or I can turn it on and off manually. 

It didn't occur to me until afterwards that the seal on the jar might be an issue. It's an old Moccona coffee jar. Should I cut off the seal, or will it be fine as long as I leave it open for a few hours every week or two to let fresh air inside?

Sorry for all the questions. I've done lots of research into this but now that I've actually built one it feels like I haven't done any research at all. Maybe I'm just looking for reassurance more than anything. Any and all advice would be really helpful. ",1,1758093945.0,terrariums,3,1.0,False

Where teams once spent late nights aligning logos, formatting graphs, and rewriting bullet points, AI presentation tools now turn a single prompt into a professional deck in seconds. The tension lies between two worlds: the speed of one-click AI decks and the discipline of brand-safe templates that enterprises can trust.

**How one-click AI decks save hours in corporate workflows**

For professionals juggling back-to-back meetings, one-click AI deck generators are more than a convenience-they’re a time-saver that compounds across an entire organization. Instead of spending three hours pulling last quarter’s sales data into slides, an AI tool can parse a CSV, generate visuals, and apply narrative structure within minutes. According to recent Trustpilot and G2 reviews of leading tools like Tome AI and [Beautiful.ai](http://Beautiful.ai), users highlight that these platforms reduce preparation time by 60–70 percent on average.

One real example comes from early-stage startups. Founders can input a pitch outline-problem, solution, traction, team-and within moments, the AI delivers an investor-ready draft that only needs minor editing. For corporate staff, especially in consulting or client services, this means less “deck-polishing” overtime and more time focusing on strategic insights.

**Why brand-safe templates matter for consistency and compliance**

While speed is enticing, enterprises cannot afford to trade compliance for convenience. Brand-safe templates ensure that every presentation aligns with the company’s official fonts, colors, tone, and legal disclaimers. This consistency is not just aesthetic-it reduces risk. For example, a financial services firm cannot afford to have disclaimers omitted or visuals that imply regulatory claims.

AI presentation tools that integrate with company brand kits (like Canva Enterprise and Pitch) allow organizations to lock in style rules. BuiltWith analysis shows that Fortune 500 firms are increasingly layering these AI tools onto Microsoft PowerPoint or Google Slides, ensuring automation without compromising governance. Public reviews on Capterra confirm that compliance features are among the most requested for enterprise adoption.

**The balance between creativity and corporate brand identity**

The challenge for 2025 is not whether AI can generate slides-it’s whether those slides balance creativity with brand identity. AI can suggest fresh layouts, dynamic imagery, and storytelling arcs. But if left unchecked, decks may veer off-brand, risking mixed messaging. The strongest tools now include “creative boundaries,” giving teams flexibility within brand-safe margins.

This balance matters most in hybrid environments. Startups may lean toward bold one-click decks to capture investor attention, while multinationals prefer controlled templates to maintain a unified voice across global offices.

**Personal Experience:** When I worked on a client strategy deck in early 2025, I tried a one-click AI generator that built 20 slides from a single paragraph prompt. It looked sleek but didn’t match the client’s strict branding rules. We had to rework the entire deck manually. Since then, I’ve leaned toward tools that integrate with brand guidelines. The lesson: speed without structure can backfire.

**Famous Book Insight:** In *The Effective Executive* by Peter Drucker (Chapter 3, p. 51), Drucker emphasizes that efficiency without effectiveness is a trap. The same applies here-AI can make decks faster, but aligning them with purpose and brand is what makes them impactful.

# Top One-Click AI Slide Deck Generators in 2025

One-click AI deck generators have exploded in popularity because they collapse the long grind of presentation design into a single input field. By typing a prompt like “create a 10-slide investor pitch for a SaaS startup with $1M ARR,” users receive an editable, structured deck in seconds. These tools are being adopted not only by solo founders but also by large organizations under pressure to deliver more in less time.

**Which tools offer instant, editable decks from prompts**

Several players dominate the one-click category in 2025. Tome AI, Gamma, and Beautiful.ai consistently appear in Reddit threads and Product Hunt launches as top-rated for turning short prompts into polished slide decks. According to G2 reviews, Tome AI excels at narrative flow-structuring a beginning, middle, and end-while Gamma is praised for clean visual hierarchy. Beautiful.ai remains a favorite among marketers because of its intuitive interface and ability to “beautify” otherwise plain content.

What sets these tools apart is their editing flexibility. While older AI generators produced rigid templates, today’s leaders offer modular decks: users can shuffle slides, regenerate sections, and update visuals without starting over. This flexibility makes them practical for last-minute pitch refinements or real-time meeting adjustments.

**How AI integrates data and visuals automatically**

The best one-click tools no longer stop at text and layout. They connect directly to data sources, transforming raw numbers into charts and infographics. For instance, Gamma integrates with Google Sheets and Notion, automatically updating visuals when source data changes. Similarly, Tome AI connects with APIs and dashboards, pulling in live performance metrics for financial or operational slides.

This is particularly powerful for corporate teams. Instead of manually updating KPIs before each meeting, the AI syncs data, ensuring presentations are always accurate. Trustpilot reviews highlight that this feature eliminates one of the most stressful pre-meeting rituals: last-minute number-checking.

**The best AI apps for startup pitch and investor decks**

For fundraising, startups gravitate toward platforms like Pitch and Canva AI because they balance sleek visuals with storytelling support. Pitch, backed by Index Ventures (as verified by Crunchbase), has become known for its “investor pitch templates” that adapt to industry expectations. Canva AI, meanwhile, offers integrations with LinkedIn and other platforms, making it easier to repurpose decks into social posts or one-pagers.

Investors expect clear, concise narratives. AI tools now offer pre-structured frameworks: problem, solution, market size, traction, team, financials. For founders, this removes guesswork and ensures no critical element is overlooked. According to Capterra, early-stage startups particularly appreciate the “guided storytelling” AI offers because it reduces the learning curve for first-time founders.

**Personal Experience:** Earlier this year, I tested Tome AI for a mock investor pitch. Within five minutes, it produced a 12-slide deck with financial charts, market sizing graphics, and a closing summary. While I edited 40 percent of the slides for polish, the baseline narrative saved me hours. If I had tried to build the same deck manually, I’d have spent an entire evening adjusting fonts, aligning text, and designing visuals.

**Famous Book Insight:** In *Zero to One* by Peter Thiel (Chapter 7, p. 114), Thiel writes that clarity of vision is more persuasive than flashy details. AI tools that automate design free up founders to sharpen their vision-arguably the most important part of any pitch.

# Brand-Safe AI Templates for Enterprises

Enterprises face a unique challenge with AI presentation tools: they want the efficiency of automation without losing the brand discipline built over years. A single off-brand color, font mismatch, or missing disclaimer can dilute credibility and even create compliance risks in regulated industries. That’s why brand-safe AI templates are emerging as the backbone of corporate adoption in 2025.

**How companies enforce branding in AI-generated decks**

Most large organizations now upload brand kits directly into AI slide tools. These kits include logos, approved fonts, color palettes, legal disclaimers, and even tone-of-voice guidelines. The AI then locks these parameters into every deck generated. Tools like Canva Enterprise and Pitch have pioneered this “brand kit enforcement,” ensuring presentations remain uniform regardless of who creates them.

For global teams, this consistency is invaluable. An office in Singapore can generate a training deck that looks identical to one built in New York, eliminating regional discrepancies. According to reviews on G2, this has drastically cut down the hours design teams spend fixing decks submitted by different departments.

**Which AI tools support corporate design guidelines**

Pitch, Canva Enterprise, and Beautiful.ai’s enterprise tier all stand out for corporate design governance. Canva Enterprise offers real-time brand controls, where admins can lock certain elements-like logos or footer text-so they can’t be altered. Pitch integrates with Slack and project management tools, enabling real-time collaboration while still applying corporate rules. Beautiful.ai has compliance layers built into its AI, flagging visuals or layouts that stray from brand style guides.

A BuiltWith analysis shows that over 30 percent of Fortune 500 companies using AI design tools opt for enterprise-grade tiers precisely because of these brand enforcement features. Capterra reviews repeatedly mention that compliance features are now the deciding factor between trialing a tool and rolling it out across an entire company.

**Avoiding off-brand visuals and compliance risks**

The risk of off-brand decks goes beyond aesthetics. In industries like healthcare, finance, and law, decks are often subject to legal or regulatory review. An AI-generated slide that omits a disclaimer or misuses a chart could expose companies to reputational damage. For this reason, enterprises seek tools that build guardrails into the creation process.

Modern AI presentation platforms now allow compliance officers to pre-approve disclaimers, watermarks, and footer texts that appear automatically in every deck. Some even integrate with compliance platforms, ensuring presentation content passes regulatory scans before being shared externally.

**Personal Experience:** During a consulting project for a multinational client, our team used Canva Enterprise’s AI assistant to build a strategy deck. The AI applied the client’s corporate palette and ensured every slide had the required legal footer. What would have taken days of manual branding checks was automated within minutes. Without those protections, the draft could easily have contained non-compliant visuals that would never pass final review.

**Famous Book Insight:** In *Good to Great* by Jim Collins (Chapter 6, p. 122), Collins explains that discipline within a framework allows for freedom and creativity. Enterprises adopting brand-safe AI templates embody this principle-employees can innovate within decks, but always inside a structure that safeguards the brand.

# omparing One-Click Decks vs Brand-Safe Templates

By 2025, most professionals fall into two camps: those who love the freedom of one-click AI decks and those who trust the structure of brand-safe templates. Both approaches deliver value, but the trade-offs come into sharp focus when businesses evaluate efficiency, accuracy, and costs.

**Speed vs accuracy: which delivers better results?**

One-click AI decks are unbeatable for speed. You can draft a 15-slide sales pitch before your coffee cools. But speed often sacrifices precision. The AI might invent graphics that don’t align with brand identity or skip key compliance details. According to Trustpilot reviews of [Beautiful.ai](http://Beautiful.ai) and Tome, users frequently mention that while they love the quick drafts, they still spend significant time revising for accuracy.

Brand-safe templates, on the other hand, slow down the initial creative burst but guarantee alignment with corporate standards. Employees don’t have to second-guess color codes or fonts, which cuts revision cycles later. In this sense, accuracy saves time downstream, especially for teams that need final decks approved by multiple stakeholders.

**How customization differs across AI presentation tools**

One-click generators lean toward universal appeal-they produce layouts that look sharp but may not fit niche needs. If you want a highly tailored investor deck with your industry-specific jargon, you may find yourself editing heavily.

Brand-safe templates, however, are pre-loaded with company-specific assets. They might limit creativity-no wild experiments with colors or typefaces-but they make customization within corporate boundaries effortless. For example, Pitch allows users to swap in pre-approved icons and charts, so decks still feel fresh while remaining on-brand.

Reddit discussions in r/Entrepreneur and r/consulting highlight this divide: startups prefer one-click generators for agility, while consultants tied to strict brand standards lean on template-driven platforms.

**Cost and licensing considerations for businesses**

Pricing is another deciding factor. One-click tools often start with freemium tiers, appealing to startups or individual users. Tome and Gamma, for instance, offer free entry points with basic export options. But for enterprises, licensing gets expensive when scaling across hundreds or thousands of employees.

Brand-safe template platforms usually operate on enterprise SaaS pricing models, with per-seat costs and compliance features baked in. While this may seem costly upfront, the savings from reduced compliance errors and design revisions often justify the expense. According to PitchBook data, enterprise adoption of brand-governed AI tools has surged in 2025, especially among financial and healthcare companies.

**Personal Experience:** I once relied on a one-click deck generator for a client-facing meeting. It was fast, and the slides looked impressive at first glance. But midway through, a stakeholder pointed out the font wasn’t consistent with corporate guidelines, undermining credibility. That moment convinced me that brand-safe templates aren’t just about aesthetics-they’re about trust.

**Famous Book Insight:** In *The Lean Startup* by Eric Ries (Chapter 8, p. 164), Ries highlights that rapid iterations must still align with validated learning. The same logic applies here-speed is valuable, but only when paired with frameworks that ensure reliable outcomes.

# AI Features That Enhance Modern Slide Decks

The newest wave of AI presentation tools isn’t just about creating slides faster. It’s about enhancing them with features that would have taken hours-or a dedicated design team-to produce manually. From live data visualizations to AI-generated imagery, these features are turning ordinary decks into interactive, persuasive experiences.

**Automated charting and data visualization**

Numbers often make or break a presentation. But converting raw data into clear, visually compelling charts has always been a pain point. AI tools like Gamma and Canva AI now read spreadsheets, detect patterns, and automatically generate the best chart type for the data-bar, line, scatter, or heatmap-without the user needing to fiddle with formatting.

This goes further with dynamic updates. Integrated with Google Sheets or Excel, the AI keeps charts current. Sales teams, for instance, can walk into a quarterly review knowing their performance graphs are up-to-date with the latest data. Reviews on G2 highlight that automated charting has eliminated one of the most time-consuming parts of deck prep: manual number entry.

**AI-powered image generation for slides**

Generic stock images are fading out. Instead, AI-powered image generation tools like MidJourney integrations and DALL·E APIs inside platforms like Tome let users create custom visuals directly within slides. Need a futuristic office skyline or a product mockup tailored to your niche? The AI generates it in seconds, ensuring visuals match the story being told.

This is a game-changer for marketing and creative teams who previously spent hours digging through stock photo libraries. According to Product Hunt feedback, users find this feature especially powerful for pitch decks where originality and visual impact matter.

**Natural language-to-slide translation**

Typing “Create a 10-slide training presentation on cybersecurity best practices” and watching the AI instantly structure content is no longer futuristic-it’s standard. Natural language processing enables tools like [Beautiful.ai](http://Beautiful.ai) and Pitch to break down prompts into logical slide flows: introduction, body, summary, and calls-to-action.

This feature is particularly useful for educators and internal trainers. They can input lecture notes or policy documents, and the AI will distill them into slide-friendly points. Public reviews on Capterra emphasize how this lowers the barrier for non-designers, empowering subject experts to share their knowledge without needing presentation design skills.

**Personal Experience:** While preparing a workshop in early 2025, I tested a natural language-to-slide generator with nothing more than my outline text. The AI created 15 slides with structured talking points, diagrams, and a summary. While I still added personal stories and refined phrasing, the time saved on slide structuring was at least three hours.

**Famous Book Insight:** In *Made to Stick* by Chip Heath and Dan Heath (Chapter 1, p. 18), the authors argue that simplicity and clarity make ideas memorable. AI-powered structuring features embody this principle-they take complex content and package it into digestible, sticky slides.

# Best AI Deck Tools for Different Use Cases

AI presentation tools aren’t one-size-fits-all. The needs of an educator running a lecture, a startup founder pitching investors, and a corporate trainer delivering compliance sessions are completely different. By 2025, the AI deck ecosystem has matured to cater to these specific contexts, offering tailored features that make presentations not just faster but more impactful.

**AI for educators and academic lectures**

Teachers and professors often deal with large volumes of content-dense textbooks, research findings, or case studies-that need to be simplified for learners. Tools like Gamma and Canva AI are especially popular in academia because they transform text-heavy documents into visual slides that keep students engaged.

Some platforms even integrate with learning management systems (LMS). For example, educators can feed in lesson plans, and the AI breaks them into lecture slides, quizzes, and recap visuals. This reduces prep time and helps standardize learning materials across classrooms. Reviews on Trustpilot from educators highlight that AI slide tools have improved both lesson clarity and student retention.

**Startup fundraising and investor pitch decks**

For startups, storytelling is everything. Pitch, Tome AI, and [Beautiful.ai](http://Beautiful.ai) stand out for their investor-focused features: they provide structured frameworks for problem-solution-market-traction-team-financials. Some even benchmark against successful decks uploaded by the community, guiding founders toward proven patterns.

According to Crunchbase, over 30 percent of startups raising seed rounds in 2025 reported using an AI tool to draft their pitch decks before refining with design teams. For small teams with limited resources, this levels the playing field-they can present with the polish of larger companies without burning time or money.

**Internal corporate training presentations**

Enterprises rely heavily on training decks for onboarding, compliance, and upskilling. Here, brand safety and interactivity matter most. Canva Enterprise and Pitch have leaned into this use case by offering features like embedded quizzes, compliance disclaimers, and locked brand templates.

Corporate trainers appreciate how natural language-to-slide translation reduces the time it takes to create materials from HR manuals or policy updates. According to Capterra reviews, employees are more likely to complete training when decks are clear, visually engaging, and interactive. AI ensures trainers spend less time formatting and more time facilitating discussions.

**Personal Experience:** When I was asked to create a cybersecurity training deck for a mid-sized firm, I fed the company’s policy document into Pitch’s AI assistant. In under 20 minutes, I had a branded, compliant slide deck with visuals and interactive elements. Instead of spending two days formatting, I used my time to focus on discussion prompts and real-life case studies during delivery.

**Famous Book Insight:** In *The Art of Explanation* by Lee LeFever (Chapter 4, p. 73), LeFever highlights that simplifying complexity is what drives understanding. The best AI tools for different use cases embody this idea by distilling dense content into slides that resonate with each audience.

# Evaluating Security and Privacy in AI Slide Tools

As AI slide deck tools move deeper into corporate workflows, questions around data security and privacy have become central to adoption decisions. Presentations often contain sensitive business information-financial forecasts, product roadmaps, or client details-and companies can’t risk leaks or compliance violations. By 2025, security is no longer an afterthought for AI presentation platforms; it’s a selling point.

**How tools protect sensitive business data**

The most reliable AI presentation platforms now use end-to-end encryption for data in transit and at rest. They also integrate with single sign-on (SSO) systems like Okta or Microsoft Azure AD, ensuring only authenticated employees can access generated decks. Enterprise editions of Pitch and Canva AI have even added private cloud deployment options, allowing organizations to host AI functions in their own secure environments.

Trustpilot reviews from enterprise users frequently mention security as the deciding factor for large-scale rollouts. One corporate IT leader noted that the ability to keep data within a company’s own infrastructure was the difference between trialing a tool and approving it for thousands of employees.

**Risks of uploading confidential content**

Despite strong security measures, risks remain. Uploading proprietary financial data or sensitive client contracts into public AI tools can expose companies to potential breaches if providers mishandle storage. This is why many firms set internal policies restricting what employees can upload into generative AI platforms.

Public discussions on Reddit’s r/sysadmin and r/consulting show that IT managers often whitelist certain tools while banning others that lack transparency around data use. The biggest red flag is when AI providers admit to using uploaded content for training their models without opt-out controls.

**Enterprise security certifications to look for**

To gain trust, AI deck platforms are now pursuing certifications like SOC 2, ISO 27001, and GDPR compliance. For financial and healthcare companies, HIPAA compliance and data residency options in specific regions (EU, US, APAC) are becoming mandatory.

BuiltWith data shows a rising trend: many enterprises evaluate a provider’s tech stack and certifications before signing contracts. According to G2 reviews, security certifications are often listed as the “make-or-break” feature for CIOs and compliance officers evaluating these platforms.

**Personal Experience:** When I first used an AI deck tool in 2024, I hesitated to upload sensitive client numbers because the platform’s privacy policy was vague. In contrast, when I later tried Canva Enterprise, the dashboard highlighted SOC 2 compliance and GDPR safeguards. That transparency gave me confidence to use the tool with real project data.

**Famous Book Insight:** In *The Speed of Trust* by Stephen M.R. Covey (Chapter 2, p. 34), Covey argues that trust is built through transparency and consistent behavior. The same principle drives enterprise adoption of AI slide tools-platforms that openly demonstrate security practices build lasting confidence with users.

# Future of AI in Presentation Design

The debate around one-click decks versus brand-safe templates is only the beginning. By 2025, AI is no longer just an assistant for formatting slides-it is becoming a co-creator, a storyteller, and even a live presentation partner. The future points toward AI tools that don’t just design decks but actively participate in how ideas are communicated.

**Will AI fully replace design teams for decks?**

The idea of AI replacing human designers comes up frequently in corporate discussions. While AI can automate repetitive tasks-like layouts, charts, or branding enforcement-it struggles with high-level storytelling and emotional nuance. Design teams bring cultural awareness, audience psychology, and creativity that AI alone cannot replicate.

What’s more likely is a hybrid model. AI will handle the groundwork (data visualization, formatting, consistency checks), while human designers will refine the narrative, tailor visuals for specific audiences, and bring originality. According to Capterra reviews, even companies that heavily use AI still keep designers on staff to oversee critical decks like board meetings or product launches.

**The role of AI assistants in live presentations**

AI is beginning to extend beyond slide creation into delivery. Some platforms now include AI-powered presenter coaches that analyze tone, pacing, and filler words during rehearsals. Others provide real-time speaker notes that adapt dynamically to audience engagement.

For instance, Tome and Pitch have experimented with AI-generated “suggested answers” that presenters can use during Q&A sessions. This capability could change the dynamics of live meetings, where presenters no longer need to memorize every detail but can rely on AI for real-time support.

According to discussions on Product Hunt, this feature excites startups pitching investors but also raises concerns about authenticity. Audiences may not respond well if they sense the speaker is overly reliant on AI prompts instead of personal expertise.

**Predictions for AI-driven brand storytelling**

As brand storytelling becomes central to marketing and sales, AI is evolving to craft not just slides but multi-format narratives. A single AI-generated deck could soon spawn a one-page executive summary, a LinkedIn carousel, and a video explainer-all aligned to the same brand voice.

By 2030, experts predict presentation AI will integrate deeply with CRM and analytics tools. Imagine sales decks that adjust live during a pitch based on a prospect’s engagement or questions. Early signals of this future are already visible in enterprise tools that link slide content with real-time analytics dashboards.

**Personal Experience:** During a recent test of Pitch’s AI assistant, I received live feedback on pacing while rehearsing. It suggested I slow down in sections heavy with data, a small tweak that improved clarity. While it felt unusual at first, the feedback mimicked what a human coach might provide, proving AI can enhance-not just automate-the presentation experience.

**Famous Book Insight:** In *The Innovator’s Dilemma* by Clayton Christensen (Chapter 1, p. 27), Christensen explains that disruptive technologies rarely replace incumbents outright but instead redefine markets in unexpected ways. AI in presentation design is following this path: not replacing designers, but reshaping how teams approach storytelling and delivery.



# FAQ

# What is the difference between one-click AI slide deck generators and brand-safe templates?

One-click AI generators focus on speed. They take a simple text prompt and instantly create editable decks, making them perfect for startups, freelancers, and small teams. Brand-safe templates, by contrast, prioritize consistency and compliance. They enforce company branding, legal disclaimers, and design rules, which is critical for enterprises that operate in regulated industries.

# Are AI presentation tools safe for confidential business data?

It depends on the provider. Enterprise-grade tools like Canva Enterprise, Pitch, and Beautiful.ai’s business tiers typically offer SOC 2 and ISO 27001 certifications, data encryption, and GDPR compliance. However, free or consumer-level versions may not guarantee the same safeguards. Businesses should always review privacy policies and restrict uploads of highly sensitive data unless the platform clearly supports secure hosting.

# Which AI slide tools are best for startups pitching investors?

Tome, Gamma, and Pitch are the most frequently recommended for fundraising decks in 2025. They include frameworks tailored for investors-covering problem, solution, market size, traction, team, and financials. Many founders also prefer these tools because they combine sleek visuals with flexibility, making it easier to tailor pitches to different audiences.

# How do AI tools handle brand consistency for enterprises?

Enterprise-focused platforms let companies upload brand kits with fonts, colors, logos, and disclaimers. Once uploaded, the AI locks these into every slide generated. This ensures all decks meet internal branding guidelines, reducing the need for design revisions. Platforms like Canva Enterprise and Pitch have become go-to solutions for this reason.

# Will AI replace human designers for slide decks?

Not entirely. AI can automate repetitive tasks such as formatting, charting, and branding enforcement, but it struggles with originality, cultural sensitivity, and emotional storytelling. Design teams will remain essential for high-stakes decks like product launches, investor roadshows, and executive presentations.

# Do AI tools integrate with data sources?

Yes. Many AI deck platforms now connect to tools like Google Sheets, Notion, and APIs to auto-update charts and tables. This ensures presentations always reflect the latest data without manual updates, saving teams hours before key meetings.

# How much do AI presentation tools cost?

Pricing varies. Consumer-level tools often start free or at $10–$20/month. Enterprise-grade solutions range from $30–$60 per seat per month, with additional costs for compliance and security features. While more expensive upfront, these tools save money in the long run by reducing compliance risks and revision cycles.

# What’s next for AI in presentations?

Future trends point toward adaptive storytelling. Decks may soon adjust in real time during meetings, based on audience engagement. AI assistants are also becoming part of delivery-offering live coaching, dynamic speaker notes, and even suggested answers during Q&As.

**Personal Experience:** I once uploaded a raw outline into Gamma, and within minutes I had a complete investor-style deck. But when I compared it to a brand-safe template in Pitch, the latter made more sense for enterprise use because it included disclaimers and consistent branding. The experience taught me that tool choice depends heavily on context-speed for startups, structure for corporations.

**Famous Book Insight:** In *Presentation Zen* by Garr Reynolds (Chapter 2, p. 42), Reynolds stresses that simplicity, clarity, and story make presentations memorable. AI tools are amplifying this principle, enabling creators to focus less on formatting and more on the story that truly resonates with their audience.",1,1758093938.0,AiReviewInsider,0,1.0,False
1nj6jip,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideBereavement/comments/1nj6jip/i_lost_my_grandpa_to_suicide_last_week/,I lost my grandpa to suicide last week,"My papaw took his own life last week. He’s always talked about struggling with depression for as long as I remember. Last year during the winter he started to feel extremely anxious and would barely eat. He eventually improved, but it started up again this year. About two Sundays ago he hosted a lobster boil at his house and his whole family came. I noticed when I saw him he had lost a lot of weight. I hung around him some of the party and he expressed to me that he felt anxious about the party. I can’t remember what else we talked about that day, not specifics anyways. I hugged him goodbye when I left and said I love you. That was the last time I saw him. I knew he was having a tough time but I had no idea how bad. I’ve also struggled with anxiety and suicidal ideation in my lifetime. If I knew that’s what he was feeling, I could have at least been there for him. He loved me and my sister more than anything else, I can only imagine how badly he must have been hurting to make a decision like that that he knew would hurt us. Either that or he thought we would be just fine without him, which is even worse.

Ive never lost anyone close to me, but I feel like this is a different kind of pain than if he were sick or something. When my dad told me, they didn’t know exactly how he died, and I assumed it was because of his heart problems or something. My mom ended up telling me the next day when they found out. That extra piece of information made the pain so much deeper, and complicated. I feel extremely guilty. I’m so worried that he didn’t realize how much we loved him. The day of that lobster boil, my Mimi asked if we wanted to sleep over the house, and I declined. I wonder if he knew what was going to happen and wanted to have me and my sister over one more time before he went. I really wish I went now. 

My papaw was a complete character. We had a much closer relationship than I think most people had with their grandparents. We would see them almost every weekend. He had this manner of talking to people that was overly formal that we would tease him for, and he loved those stupid dad humor jokes. He made himself laugh more than anyone else did, and I think he found it funnier when I would roll my eyes and tell him how bad his joke was than if I had actually just laughed. He wouldn’t mind making a fool out of himself if it would make us laugh. He also always seemed genuinely interested in my thoughts on things that were happening in the world, he was probably the only person left on the planet that would never get heated even if you completely disagreed on something. He also was very encouraging and appreciating of my artwork. He probably saved every piece I’ve made for him. He hung an abstract piece I did in the bathroom. I had this self portrait I did back in high school that he loved and even did an analysis of. He said he wanted it but I kept forgetting to give it to him. 

I keep thinking of things I want to tell him that I can’t now. Not just things I want him to know now, but I wanted to tell him about how my sophomore year of college is going, I wanted to show him around my dorm like I did last year (he went to the same school as me), I want him to take my sister and I out for dinner again. I want to spend Christmas Eve with him. I want him to make me coffee after dinner again like he always does. I want him to come to my wedding and embarrass me by trying to dance. The worst part is it doesn’t feel like he was taken from us, but it feels like he left. I don’t feel angry with him but I’m angry about what he did, and I’m angry at myself. Some days have been better, but tonight I’m having a particularly hard time. The funeral is tomorrow and today I’ve felt so anxious and sick about the whole thing. I keep thinking that i want this to be over with, not the funeral aspect in particular but like all of it. I want the part of him being dead to be over so we can go back to the way it’s supposed to be.

I’m not really asking for anything, advice and support are wanted and appreciated, but I’ve just felt really alone during this whole thing because I’ve had a hard time being open about how I feel to my family, and just wanted my feelings to be known, even if it’s to strangers on the internet. I’ve never been good at dealing with other people going through grief, which I thought was because I was unfamiliar with it, but that hasn’t changed, and I think that might be what’s making it so hard, I don’t know.

* **Tariffs are already pushing costs.** Companies like Adidas, Walmart, Home Depot, Nike, etc., are raising consumer prices, citing increased import costs from tariffs. ([Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/companies-raising-prices-increases-trump-tariffs-2025?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
* **Food and specific goods are getting hit hard.** Like coffee: massive price jumps attributed partly to tariffs and supply constraints. ([Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/b589a834-f932-4c3f-9de8-b098c9526d77?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
* **Inflation is sticky but not exploding.** Retail sales rose in August (+0.6%) despite inflation and job market strains. Core inflation above target, but not wildly out of control. ([AP News](https://apnews.com/article/11e40d9b98461fee52f5db2455f0e7e1?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
* **Labor market signs of weakening.** Job growth slowing, more claims, etc. Indications that the labor market is less robust. ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/11/cpi-fed-powell-tariffs-trump-inflation-00557111?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
* **Wholesale prices easing a bit.** Producer prices (PPI) unexpectedly fell slightly, core services prices slipped. That suggests input inflation may be easing, though consumer/output-side effects may still lag. ([AP News](https://apnews.com/article/2ae00c79d925b20e8fdc603066ac575f?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

**Some counterpoints / uncertainties:**

* The full pass-through of tariffs into consumer inflation is not yet complete. Economists expect much of that cost flow to happen gradually, some more in the second half of the year. ([CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-tariffs-trump-inflation-prices/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
* Some sectors are more insulated (or have already front-loaded), and demand is still holding up in many areas. ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/us-manufacturing-output-unexpectedly-rises-rebound-motor-vehicle-production-2025-09-16/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

# What that implies for what JPow/Powell might say

Given what you think + what the news is showing, here’s how I see Powell’s likely tone, and whether it will read dovish, cautious, or mild hawkish:

* He’ll almost certainly **acknowledge risk from tariffs** — saying they are showing up, input costs are rising in certain sectors, some food price pressure, possibly referencing coffee etc.
* He’ll also probably highlight **labor market cooling** — slower job growth, maybe rising unemployment claims, downward revisions.
* He’ll point out that **overall inflation is stable-ish**, maybe above target in core measures, but not accelerating sharply. Might say inflation expectations are remaining anchored for now.

So overall, **a cautious-dovish tone**. Something like:

>

I doubt he comes off hawkish, unless inflation surprise is large, or labor market shows sudden strength. He’s more likely to err on being conservative and emphasizing data dependence.

# So, based on your story + the news — how dovish is “dovish enough”?

Putting it all together, I lean toward this:

* **Expect** a **25 bps rate cut**, but with strong cautious language.
* **Tone**: less like “we see inflation under control, we can afford aggressive easing” and more like “we are watching closely; risks from tariffs and global supply chains could complicate things; we need more confirmation”.
* **Market reaction**: might be relief, but mixed. If Powell signals more data needed, or emphasizes downside risks, markets may bounce then fade or stay volatile. VIX could stay elevated post-meeting until more data confirms the easing path.

Short version: **Rick Rieder (BlackRock’s CIO of Global Fixed Income)** has been saying the Fed **should cut 50 bps now** (this week) because the labor market has softened and inflation risk looks manageable.

* In a CNBC interview at the Future Proof Festival (Huntington Beach) last week, Rieder said the Fed **“should lower… by 50 basis points next week,”** citing soft jobs data and the need to reset policy faster. ([Investment Executive](https://www.investmentexecutive.com/news/research-and-markets/the-u-s-needs-a-50-basis-point-rate-cut-blackrock-exec/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
* Bloomberg also noted Rieder “told CNBC… he thinks the Fed should cut… by 50 basis points,” reinforcing that this is his near-term call. ([Bloomberg.com](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-12/blackrock-s-rick-rieder-climbs-ranks-of-fed-chair-contenders?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
* He’s been making this case since the July/Aug data rolled in—MarketWatch summarized that, after the CPI print, he saw a **justifiable half-point** move in September. ([MarketWatch](https://www.marketwatch.com/livecoverage/stock-market-today-dow-s-p-500-and-nasdaq-set-for-tepid-rise-as-cpi-report-looms-intel-shares-climb/card/blackrock-s-rieder-sees-a-case-for-a-half-point-fed-rate-cut-after-july-cpi-data-1VeFNCBY9X6bBAsA06H8?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

Got it—assume **cautious-dovish tone either way**. Here’s the clean scenario map for **tomorrow**:

# If the Fed cuts 50 bps

* **Initial read:** Surprise. Knee-jerk **risk-on** if framed as “resetting policy,” but can whipsaw if markets think it signals **growth worry**.
* **Equities (SPX/QQQ):** Pop on the headline → **choppy** into/after presser. Growth/AI, long-duration, REITs, utilities **lead**; banks **mixed** (NIM squeeze vs. credit relief).
* **VIX:** Likely **spike on the print** (+2–4 pts) from surprise → then **bleed lower** as event risk decays if Powell stays calm/data-dependent.
* **Rates:** **Front-end drops** hardest (2Y down \~15–30 bps intraday), **curve steepens**.
* **USD:** **Softer**; **gold/crypto** bid on easier policy.

# If the Fed cuts 25 bps (base case)

* **Initial read:** In-line. “Cautious-dovish” = easing bias without panic.
* **Equities:** **Modest relief**; less whipsaw than a 50. Growth/quality **slight outperformance**; cyclicals watch guidance.
* **VIX:** **Event vol comes out** — typical **drift lower** (≈ −1 to −2 pts) as hedges decay.
* **Rates:** **2Y down \~5–10 bps**; curve mildly **steeper**.
* **USD:** Slightly **weaker**; gold/crypto **firmer**, but smaller move than under 50.

# How to interpret with “insiders want 50” + “Trump wants 50”

* That **raises the odds** of a knee-jerk **risk-on** if 50 lands and Powell **frames it as proactive**.
* If he even hints at growth concern, the **second move** can flip **risk-off** (banks/cyclicals lag, VIX stays sticky).

# Simple playbook (not advice)

* **25 bps + cautious-dovish:** Expect **vol crush** post-event; “grind-up/chop” day.
* **50 bps + cautious-dovish:** Expect **bigger ranges**: spike → reassess during Q&A → direction set by whether he stresses **insurance** (bullish) vs **fragility** (bearish).

**What is your final prediction for Jpow tomorrow?**



Rationale (quick): Markets are pricing a **25 bp cut as the base case** with only a small tail for 50. Reuters’ pre-decision wraps and positioning pieces today keep pointing to a quarter-point move, and Fed-funds futures (CME FedWatch) show the 50 bp path as low-probability. ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/fed-rate-cut-optimism-has-bond-investors-focusing-duration-steeper-yield-curve-2025-09-16/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

Read-through if we’re right: **VIX likely bleeds lower after the event** (hedges come off) with a cautious-dovish tone; if we do get 50, expect a bigger whipsaw and only settle bullish if Powell frames it as proactive “reset,” not panic.

1nj6fvk,https://i.redd.it/y6fj07ujeopf1.jpeg,I watched The Big Heat (1953),"Been a while since I watched a classic noir. Fritz Lang excels per usual, with this movie kinda feeling like he travelled to the future, saw one of the better Liam Neeson action movies, and then went back to the '50s and remade it for that time period.

I guess that's a roundabout way of saying this movie kicks ass but is also held back a bit by the Hayes Code. Lee Marvin, who plays the most loathsome son of a bitch I've seen in a long time, thinks Gloria Grahame cheated on him, so he calls her a ""pig"", which yes is a horrible thing to say but we all know in real life, even back then, he'd be calling her a slut.

Glenn Ford (who spends most of this movie in a barely concealed rage) loses his wife via carbomb. He drags her body out of the wreackage and it's totally spotless. Not a scratch. After a fucking carbomb goes off.

Usually I'm able to brush off stuff like this and yeah it's not really the film's fault, but it bothered me a bit here. I'd love to see a modern remake that shows all the nitty gritty. But that being said, sometimes less is more. The famous hot coffee scene is burned into my mind just as much as it was burned into Grahame's face, even if it happens off screen.

# INTRODUCTION!

Do you have a weekend trip to Sydney scheduled soon? We want to give you our top advice today so you can get the most out of a quick trip to our hometown. Here are some suggestions for having the ideal weekend in Sydney. Whether you are visiting Sydney for the first time or are a frequent visitor, I hope you find something to make your trip memorable.  
Plan your weekend trip with Maxi Cabs Sydney Service.

# Decide where to stay:

At the best of times, choosing a place to stay can be challenging, but during a brief visit, picking the wrong location might negatively affect your experience. Even though staying outside the city or in nearby “villages” can be cheaper, you’ll waste valuable time traveling.  
Here are some options that you can choose for your stay.

* Circular Quay and The Rocks- Sightseeing
* Kings Cross – Nightlife.
* The Rocks – Eating and Dining out
* Bondi and Manly – Families
* Bondi and Manly – Beaches
* City Center – First time visitors.
* Darling Harbor – Shopping.
* Circular Quay – Transportation
* North Sydney – Romantic District
* Eastern Beaches – Walking
* Manly and Double Bay – Safest Place
* Kings Cross – Unsafe.

# Make a Plan for Budget:

There is no escaping the fact that Sydney is incredibly costly. According to numerous studies, Sydney has one of the highest cost of living rates worldwide.  
But there are still many excellent methods to save money in this city, so whether you plan to stay for a few days or the rest of your life, this guide can help you scrape up some cash to spend on the more important things (like more travel!).

* SAVE ON TRANSPORTATION

When you get off the train at either the Domestic or International Airport stops, be prepared to pay a fee of about $18.Combine your rail trip with either the 350 or 420 bus, both of which travel to domestic and international airports, to avoid paying this tax.  
Ease out your transportation with Maxi Taxi Sydney

* SPEND LESS ON MEALS AND BEVERAGES

One method to eat cheaply in Sydney is to eat a lot of Asian food – there are so many cheap Asian eateries in Sydney, especially in Chinatown. And the cuisine is wonderful! Keep in mind that many of these establishments only accept cash.  
Utilize applications such as Eatclub and happy hour specials. EatClub is an app and website that maintains a very good track of what bargains are available, so make sure to check it out. It’s not uncommon to see restaurants offering 20%, 30%, 40%, or even 50% off your entire cost if you make a reservation with EatClub.

* SAVE ON TRAVELING

Use apps like I Know The Pilot, which maintains track of any travel bargains offered by airlines, to find cheap domestic and international flights.  
If you want to save money (while also helping hotel owners), book directly with Hotels And Hostels. If you message the hotel directly, tell them what you saw online, and see if they can match or beat it, you will always be able to get a better bargain. Get rid of the middlemen and assist these tiny businesses!

* SAVE ON ENTERTAINMENT

If you’re on a tight budget or there’s no show that you want to see, conclude your day with this magnificent alternative: the free light show at the Sydney Opera House.  
Every Thursday morning at 9:00 a.m., the Sydney Theater Company in Walsh Bay offers a limited number of $20 tickets. Set your alarm, bookmark this page, and grab a seat.

# Long Weekend in Sydney:

1. **THE ROCKS**

The Rocks is a secret Sydney neighborhood known for its historic laneways, street food stalls, and shopping. This is a fantastic place to explore both during the day and at night.

Explore on foot, stopping at markets, museums, and galleries tucked into small laneways. Take a free walking tour outside Cadmans Cottage at 6 p.m. (Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays).

Going on this walk allows you to learn a lot about the area from a local and get recommendations for the best places to eat or drink. Amble down cobblestone laneways and enjoy a great coffee from one of the many cafes or a cold drink at one of Australia’s oldest pubs.

It also houses the Museum of Contemporary Art, which features both local and international exhibits. If you like art, you should definitely go here. There is a new exhibition every month.

The Rocks really come alive on weekends. The Rocks Markets are held on Saturdays and Sundays from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., and there are numerous stalls selling a variety of products, as well as food trucks and cafes to enjoy.

2. **SYDNEY HARBOR BRIDGE AND MANLY**

Why not get up early and watch the city light up from the top of the Sydney Harbor Bridge? You can do this tour now or later in the day if you prefer.

The bridge is one of several iconic symbols of Sydney. Climbing the Sydney Harbor Bridge is a popular attraction for visitors to Sydney.

The Bridge is the world’s largest steel arch bridge, spanning one of the finest natural harbors; it is also known as The Coathanger due to its unique design.

There are several ways to explore the bridge. You can walk or cycle across it, or you can climb up it (with a harness, of course) for spectacular views of Sydney Harbor.

3. **Harbour Cruise**

Why not unwind on the water after spending the morning exploring the markets and enjoying a delicious lunch?

Your next stop in Sydney is to board a Harbour Cruise at King Street Wharf, where you can spend 90 minutes sailing around the area. A ticket can be reserved online in advance for the boats’ hourly departures.

On a 90-minute cruise through Sydney Harbour, take in the iconic city skyline while sipping tasty cocktails and tapas in the bar lounge and listening to live music. Onboard, you can buy food and drinks if you want.

Experience 360-degree waterfront views while passing well-known locations like The Opera House, Royal Botanical Garden, and the bridge.

4. **TARONGA ZOO**

The Sydney Taronga Zoo is home to over 1,000 animals, including exotic and native species.

One of the best activities is to take in the zoo’s various habitats, which include the Rainforest Trail, the African Savannah, the Free Flight Bird Area, the Reptile and Nocturnal House, and others. You can get up close and personal with some amazing animals in these places.

This Zoo is fantastic because it works hard to conserve wildlife. The Taronga Zoo is dedicated to native species conservation and actively participates in breed-and-release initiatives.

Before returning injured or abandoned animals to their natural habitats, they engage in wildlife rehabilitation programmes and habitat recovery initiatives. Additionally, the zoo provides a lot of benefits for all animals.

On the other hand, they also have a lot to learn about the animals and raise problems and dangers that these animals must deal with in the wild. They include information on climate change, ocean trash, and what each of us can do to help.

5. **BONDI BEACH**

The most well-known beach in Sydney is Bondi Beach, and you must visit it while you’re there.

The number of people swimming or surfing at this hour in the morning will surprise you. You can watch the lifesavers set up the flags and their equipment for the day if you get there early enough.

Sit back on the sand and observe everything. Alternatively, enrol in surf lessons to learn from the pros.

The beach will be crowded by noon. Therefore, it is best if you arrive early. Swim between the flags if you decide to take a swim because this beach can be hazardous due to strong currents and riptides.

The Bondi Farmers Markets are open on Saturday from 9 am to 1 pm and sell fresh produce, gourmet food, and other items.

Another market called the Bondi Market will be open on Sunday from 10 am to 4 pm. This market will also have many stalls with tonnes of goods, food trucks, and perhaps even live music. The same area houses both markets.  
Enjoy your weekend tours with Sydney Tour Services.

We’ve all been there! We gather information, weigh our options, and suddenly, we’re knee-deep in analysis paralysis. So how do we break free from this mental quicksand? Enter: **Decision Stacking!**  

You might be wondering, “What in the world is that?” Here’s the deal:  

1. **Set a Timer**: Give yourself just **10 minutes** to make a decision. You’d be amazed at how much clearer your thoughts can become when there’s a gentle pressure to act. It’s like the ultimate time hack! ⏳
   
2. **List Your Options**: Write down the alternatives you’re considering. This isn’t about perfect clarity—just get them out of your head. Seeing them on paper can magically lighten the load! 📝  

3. **Rank ‘Em**: It doesn’t have to be fancy, but give a quick score or rank based on what feels good in your gut. Sometimes you just *know* which one resonates the most!  

4. **Visualize the Outcomes**: Take a second to picture how each decision could play out. Do you see yourself crushing it? Or is it a hard pass? This can help you tap into your instincts.  

5. **Choose & Commit**: Make a choice, even if it feels less than perfect. The truth is, even a mediocre decision is often better than no decision at all! Just think of all those bestselling self-help books that tell you, “Nothing ventured, nothing gained.” 

6. **Reflect**: After you’ve made your decision, set aside a moment to reflect. Was it the right call? What did you learn? This helps you make better decisions next time!  

7. **Reward Yourself**: Celebrate your decision-making prowess! 🎉 Seriously, treat yourself to a little something—a coffee, a walk, or that spicy ramen you’ve been eyeing!   

Sometimes it’s not about making the ""perfect"" choice; it’s about getting into the habit of **moving forward**. And let’s be real, the perfectionist in us often forgets that progress is what we’re really after here.

1nj6655,https://www.reddit.com/r/marriageadvice/comments/1nj6655/things_just_arent_quite_adding_up_about_why_we/,Things just aren't quite adding up about why we separated,"I (33M) and my wife (38F) have been married since May 2024. Our wedding day was the happiest day of my life. She's got two kids to other fathers. Last Saturday, she asked for an amicable split, this came after me losing my temper on Friday night.

Last October, we had a weekend away in another city. One night, we both decided to go to the strippers together. We were approached, and my wife paid for the both of us to have a private show. Later that night, after 2 or 3 drinks and on a false high from what had happened, I said something along the lines of ""*I'd happily have a threesom with her*"" without actually meaning it

The 10 hour drive home the next day was quiet. The next day at work, we spoke on the phone about that night, and about what I said. I told her that I didn't mean what I said, but that going to the strippers felt like having a relapse on my porn addiction. We worked things out and both agreed to put in more effort in.

A couple of weeks later, while I was at work on a Saturday night, she went out to dinner with a friend of hers. I knew about this beforehand, because she asked me 3 or 4 times if I was okay with her going out for dinner and each time I said yes. After dinner, she drove her friend home, and went inside to see the friends husband. The friend and husband are swingers. They hit her up for a threesom, and she said no, but stayed and watched. She didn't tell me about this until the next morning while we were having a coffee in bed. I didn't know how to react or process this at the time, and kind of just moved on from it.

fast forward to April, we decided to try for a baby, and this was the first time we had sex since Oct/Nov. about 4 weeks later (start of May) she was positive on a pregnancy test. We were both happy, but a week later, she had a miscarriage at the 5 week mark. She took the miscarriage very hard, and I tried to urge her to talk to get help with her mental health, however she said ""I'll think about it"" as a possible stalling tactic.

I didn't handle the miscarriage in my own way, and I was working more than I usually would. 4x day shifts and 3-4x night shifts each week. I think it was a distraction for me, and I thought maybe the money would be good to help our family financially, but I think I got caught up with focusing on the money.

Around July, we went for breakfast one morning, and she was visibly down, I asked her what was wrong and she told me that ""*every time she looked at me, all she thought about was the miscarriage*"" and that it was hurting her. I tried again to encourage her to talk to someone, and that I'd be right by her side to take that first step in asking for help.

We communication levels declined a lot, but we still spoke regardless.

Around the start of August, her youngest kids father told us that he and his partner we're successful with their round of IVF. About two weeks later, they then told us that they lost the baby. My wife messaged me separately, saying ""wow! that was big news!"" and I responded with ""*that sucks! But it doesn't affect us*""  meaning that have ourselves to focus on.

We had a week-long trip booked in another city, this was supposed to be our honeymoon. Initially, we were both very excited about it when we first discussed it back in March, and we both were going to wait until July to book things. When I asked her if she still wanted to go, she said ""*yeah, I guess*"".

We then went to the tax agent on Friday midday, turns out I owe some tax money and I told her I have an expensive car service coming up. she suggested we cancel the holiday and book at a later time.

We got home on Friday afternoon after attending swimming lessons for her youngest, and she had a parcel delivered. An online clothes o*rder. I asked ""Did you get more clothes? what are they for?*"" thinking nothing of it. She told me ithey're for an engagement party that we have coming up in October, to which I said I didn't know about that. She said she did tell me, and that there was an invitation on the fridge, I told her that she infact didn't tell me, and I asked what the date was so I could take the day off work. I was getting frustrated because I caught her lying and she continued to tell me that she did tell me. I then said ""I'll take the fucking day off work"" while walking away. 

I was overwhelmed, because I don't like raising my voice or confrontation and I was disappointed at myself for swearing at her. I shut down and didn't talk to her for the rest of the evening. 

The next morning, she continued on with her day without me, dropping the youngest off at his dads house, then taking the elded off to get a haircut. I left the house to go to the shops to get some things and a haircut as well.

When I came home, I was in our bedroom sorting out my clothes. she came in and said ""*I'm not coming to the family dinner tonight""* and I said that it was fine and that I didn't expect her to. I then said ""*I'm ready to talk when you are""* 

I told her that I haven't felt loved for the last 10 months, and she agreed. She asked when it was, and I told her it was that night in November when she went out with her swinger friends and straight away she said ""N*o. No. thats not it at all*"" and she said for her it was the night we went to the strippers and what I said, she held on to the whole time. She said that she has struggled with the miscarriage and that everytime she looks at me that its all she can think about. She told me she didn't like the constant fighting. She then asked for all of this to be amicable. 

I told her that I would do whatever I would need to, to save the marriage. I asked her if she would be interested in Marriage Councelling, and she said that it wasn't an option.

She offered for me to stay the night and I can pack some things in the morning, but I told her I needed to get out of the house and pacled some things.

I called in on Sunday to get a few more things that I needed straight away (medication, toiletries etc) to take with me back to my parents.

Aside from asking for marriage counceling, I haven't begged her for me to stay etc...

Yesterday, she messaged me telling me she would need me to sign some things to take my name off the mortgage. I didn't respond until this morning. She sent another message this afternoon asking when I would be up her way, or if it would be easier for her to drive down to me so I can sign. I didn't respond, 10 minutes later she called, I told her that my appointment is up near her (I didn't tell her it was a psychiatrist appointment) and I asked if we could meet up somewhere nuetral.

I am considering asking her tomorrow if she would be okay with having a mature conversation. I don't think she will, because it seems like she is trying to cut all ties very quickly and push me away very quickly.

tl;dr - my wife is asking for an amicable separation, but things just aren't making sense to me",2,1758092465.0,marriageadvice,2,1.0,False

Looking to upgrade from my Silvia v3, which is on it's last legs after a history that includes being flogged in a uni share house. The interior is fairly rusty, the system runs hot, and after some recent back to back services I'm being told it needs an overhaul to keep. I'm not really up for doing that myself, maybe as a project when I have bit more time. In the meantime, I'm excited to get a shiny new machine!

* I'm in Australia (so prices and budget are AUD)
* I'm an enthusiastic coffee enjoyer but not a proper aficionado. I have a Varia VS3, a regular Proud Mary Coffee subscription and I'm happy to dial in, but not someone that goes through a wide range of different coffees (at the moment - if I'm making much better coffee I might be enter the virtuous cycle)
* We drink daily espresso and long blacks, and on weekends have a milk coffee or two (esp if we have people over)
* Budget is around $1500-$2500 AUD. I'm a sucker for up-selling so could maybe go up to $3000ish.
* I'm sick of temperature surfing (really I'm time surfing) so keen on a PID. I'm keen on something with a longer lifespan (10 years plus) and easier reparability.

Main three I'm looking at are:

* Rancilio Silvia V6 ($1400) + PID mod (Auber kit is \~$300-400 AUD)
* Quick Mill Silvano Evo ($1600)
* Profitec Go ($2200)

The Silvia is tempting but the modding with the PID is a bit of a fuss, and so it doesn't end up being that entry level in price. On the otherhand, they are so hardy and repairs/parts seem very available and accessible. I'm tempted by the Profitec but less sure about longevity?

I'm happy to be persuaded around others. I'm not sure I absolutely need a double boiler or heat exchange, but the options there are around $3000 with main brands I've seen being Ranicilio, Rocket, Profitec etc.

Today, I wanna share my top favorite energy drink brands here in the US and why they stand out. Then it’s YOUR turn: drop your ranking and reasons in the comments!First up, 

**Red Bull**—total classic for a reason! It’s not too sweet, has that perfect crisp taste, and the 8.4oz can is *ideal* for on-the-go: tossing in your bag for a morning commute, sipping during a late work project, or even mixing into a weekend cocktail. It gives a steady energy lift without the jitters, which is why it’s been my go-to for years.

Next, **Monster Energy**—if you want bold flavor and a bigger kick, this is it. Their original green can is iconic, but I love that they have so many variants: Zero Sugar for those watching calories, Mango Loco for a fruity twist, and even Java Monster for a coffee + energy combo. The 16oz size lasts forever, and it’s perfect for long road trips or intense gym sessions.

Honorable mention: **Rockstar Energy**. It’s often more affordable than the others, but doesn’t skimp on taste or energy. I’m obsessed with their Punched Guava flavor—it’s sweet, tropical, and feels like a little treat while keeping me awake during early-morning study sessions. Plus, their sleek cans look cool in your hand (tiny win, but still counts!).Now it’s your turn! What’s YOUR top energy drink brand in the US?

I have seen a lot of coffee related posts and taken notes and tried a bunch of coffee places in the CBD but so far I have been quite disappointed with the flat whites.

I am not knowledgable in coffee at all but I pretty much only order flat white. I can only tell which ones I myself like better.

Two of my favourite non-CBD places where I order from are:
Dear Deer (I mostly go to Pakuranga)
The Burb Eatery in Farm Cove. 


In the CBD my favourite have been Krispy Kreem and DOSE. And today at Krispy Kreem I had the best flat white I have ever had in the CBD lol. Thank you to the dude working there today the cream cheese bagel was also great! 😋😂😂",7,1758091591.0,aucklandeats,16,0.82,False

Everyone knows everyone, and every major “news event” is usually just someone’s daughter getting engaged or someone’s son getting shipped off to the US.

Enter the Srinivasan family. Their claim to fame? A son in America™. Aunties and uncles have been milking that NRI badge like it’s an Olympic medal for years.

But THIS week, their daughter casually nuked the patriarchy. She bought a house. In her own name. Before marriage.

Yes, you read that right. A WOMAN… with PROPERTY PAPERS… that don’t have her husband’s name. Agraharam aunties almost fainted into their filter coffee.

Now here’s the spicy twist: she didn’t do it alone. Her *mother*—queen of budgeting and undercover finance minister of the house—had been skimming little amounts off the veggie budget for TWENTY YEARS. Like, one onion less per sambar = one rupee closer to revolution. She saved enough to slap down a down payment, teamed up with her daughter, and boom: patriarchy.exe stopped responding.

Of course, the uncles at the tea stall are huffing about “culture” and “tradition.” But let’s be real—half of them don’t even know their own bank PINs because their wives handle *everything*. Meanwhile, the aunties have gone full Shark Tank. I literally heard one say, “If she can do it, I’m starting my own secret rice-jar fund.”

So now, the same people who used to flex “our boy works in America” are getting overshadowed by “our girl bought a freaking house.”

And honestly? One “scandalous” property deed just did more damage to patriarchy than a thousand WhatsApp forwards about “women empowerment.”

South Indian society runs on gossip, but sometimes… gossip brews revolutions stronger than filter kaapi. ☕🔥",1,1758091457.0,Taazagossips,0,1.0,False

1nj5j6e,https://www.reddit.com/r/SAHP/comments/1nj5j6e/my_husband_only_contributes_money/,My husband only contributes money,"First post ever. I'm at the end of my rope.

My husband is a lineman. He doesn't travel. A normal day is 7am-3:30pm with the option to work until 6pm. His truck does all their work, usually, before lunch. The rest of the day, even until 6pm is sitting in the truck waiting to go home. He makes good money. Stupid good money. But that's his ONLY contribution. 

He asked me to quit my job. I didn't make much money at all, couple thousand a month AT BEST. However, he pressured me and told me I prioritized the patrons over him if I kept the job. I've worked my entire adult life, use to work for myself. Life happened and I had to find employment i could bike to from the house i use to OWN. My parents died when I was in my early 20s and I've relied solely on myself without government assistance for a decade and a half. 

Until I got married. 

He was the sweetest man, but I'm starting to think that was a fake persona.

When he gets angry, everything is his because he worked for the money to buy it. He says ""you get everything you want"" which is far from true and if it were, I don't ask for much. I'm frugal and cheap while he'll buy an 94k car 1000k rc truck, and 4k dog on a whim, $300 pocket knife that I never wanted and call it a gift for me, and brand named sunglasses knowing I'm terrible with sunglasses and buy $20 ones that last only one year FOR A REASON... just a few examples. He buys me expensive things I never said I wanted without taking any consideration to my style and things I would want. Until recently I accepted them with a smile, because I've never had really nice things and was raised to be grateful. But now I tell him when I think it's ugly and ask him why he wasted his money on things I don't want... ""I'd rather you just be nice to me"" is usually what I say. 

He says we go on trips wherever I want to go, but only because he refuses to say where HE wants to go. I ask him for ANY input on location, hotel or vrbro, sites he wants to visit and all I ever get is ""i don't know."" One weekend trip, we went hungry because he refused to pick a restaurant.

I ask him what he wants to eat every so often when I've no idea what to cook and/or want to make something he's a taste for and I get ""I don't know"" I make a variety of dishes from dang near every culture. I'm a great cook and I'll toot my horn there. I keep it different and creative, but sometimes I just want to NOT have to make a decision. So, some nights I don't cook. He doesn't ask for anything at all. He doesn't day he's hungry, and I don't make anything... then he weaponizes it. Keep in mind, until the last month and a half I've had a meal cooked FROM SCRATCH a minimum of 5 nights a week. 

He's planned ONE date and didn't even plan it. It was an impulse to go to a nice restaurant in town. Everything we do is left to me to decide and then he weaponizes it during an argument. I've asked him to make any decision and he won't. If he asks me what i want to go that night, I'll say why don't you decide on something. And we end up doing NOTHING. Not a movie on streaming or even a video game. I will say a couple nights this past month he did make a choice to have a fire in the back yard. That was pretty great. I told him he had a wonderful idea and thanked him for doing that.

He decided he wanted to buy a dog ""for"" me and I told him to wait... he bought the dog that same day, adding to my work load, that I didn't ask for. Giant Schnauzer. A dog that needs LOTS of play time. I love the dog to death, but I didn't ask for him. My husband is jealous of the dog now because I ""treat the dog better and give him more attention."" He's a puppy. Who SHOULD be treated better by BOTH of us and NEEDS the attention. The dog can't choose new owners or make his own food. He relies fully on us for everything. Besides that, the dog doesn't make me feel terrible about myself. He's annoying from time to time, but he's not malicious. He's a dog. 

He was supposed to clean up poop out of the yard at LEAST every other day. He lays five piles in 24hr. When we moved into our house, I said I'd cut the yard if he would edge and weed trim. The result was me edging with scissors until i had blisters on my hands because I can't work the cheap trimmer. Weeks worth of poop in the yard if I don't pick it up. 

He drinks heavy and can't seem to put his bottles in the recycling. Weekends the house looks like a frat party with bottles everywhere. And if they don't move from where he forgot them, it's my fault and I'm a lazy wife. 

I'm overwhelmed. I had major emergecy abdominal surgery at the beginning of the year and while recovering from it he had to take care of the house. I couldn't walk without a cane. The second week he lost his sh*t and went off on how lazy I was. I didn't ""suck, f**k, cook, or clean"" mind you, I almost died not two weeks before and had never had any major surgery ever... tonsillectomy at 15 and that wasn't in a surgical theater with a team of a dozen or so people... not knowing if I'd even come it alive!!

I'll admit, after recovery, I haven't been a perfect house wife. Some mornings I didn't make coffee for him. Some days laundry sat on the table to be folded. Some days the sink was full. Some days the floors weren't cleaned. Never all at once (until this last couple of weeks because I ""do nothing, ever"" do i decided to let him see what it looks like when i ""do nothing"" ...Keep in mind he bought a puppy I didn't ask for that A. Made more messes and B. Required ME to train and play with. The house has NEVER been filthy. Garbage is in the trash, dishes in the sink are rinsed, and spills/splatter are cleaned up. It's only ever been untidy. The yard is never over grown. The flower beds are never full of weeds. 

Our recent argument he said he could clean this house in 8hr better than I ever have.  It's 2200sf and I wash the walls, doors, and baseboards, light switches, intake vents, etc. every few weeks as needed. He doesn't even NOTICE everything I keep clean. He's just use to walking out and back in the door to a clean home, but doesn't seem to realize it's because I CLEAN IT! 

The FIRST TIME I didn't vacuum the whole house before he got home (I normal do it daily an hour before he gets home) he flipped out about how dirty it was. I tried to tell him that was how it was every single day, because we now have a dog who tracks in dirt and grass AND pulls stuffing from the stuffed toys HE decided to buy the dog. He said we'd take him to parks when he got off work several days a week, but we never go unless I beg him. 

As far as arguments go, yeah I get mad. I'll raise my voice and curse. I use to not. I feel like he's changed how I react, but for arguments sake that doesn't matter. I do it. I shouldn't. But I feel tired of being beat down without standing up for myself and the calmly talking wasn't getting my anywhere. Now I'm just angry. 

I recently had an LCL injury when our dog, now 9 months and 90lb, slammed into me running full speed. My husband said to stay in bed to let it heal. That same week he called me a fat lazy f**k because the house wasn't clean. 

I'm also not a morning person. I get most of my energy by 11am. Before that, I'm a slug. Always have been. Even when ALL chores are done he weaponizes the fact I don't really get going until 11am. 

I suffer from fatigue. I've tried desperately to fix this, my whole life. The only thing i haven't done is go to a doctor about it, which I'm about ready to see if they can't help me. I'm tired...a lot.  Every time I take a nap, it's weaponized either immediately or later during an argument. 

I say all this to ask if my husband is just a giant A hole or if a stay at home partner should do ALL house and yard chores, plan every meal, plan every vacation, plan every date, initiate every sexual encounter, brush their partners hair, make sure their partner took their meds... EVERY SINGLE THING the house and beings in it require because the other partner earns all the money? Am I delusional to think he should do more? Or is he delusional for thinking everything other than going to work is my responsibility.

I want to also mention I've nothing in my name. Not even a bank account. I've no money of my own. I have one physical card that gets $100/ month put in the account and one of his cards on our kroger app and Amazon so I can purchase groceries and household items. 

My husband wasn't raised this way. His father plants a zinnia garden every year because his wife loves the flowers, is a neat freak who cleans up after himself, does all the yard work and keeps a beautiful yard for him and his wife, initiates dates and is very loving towards his wife. 

I feel gaslit into thinking I'm not doing my part in the relationship and the more he pushes that narrative, the less I want to do. But I can't not do because I get degraded for it. I literally have to ask my husband if it's okay to not do much around the house ""the sink is empty and the laundry is done, but the floors aren't vacuumed and there's a few things that aren't put away. Can I just relax the rest of the day?"" After a stressful day (court out of town with crooked judge for driving offense...) And still get degraded at the end of the day, even though he said that was okay, all because I was napping when he got home from work.
