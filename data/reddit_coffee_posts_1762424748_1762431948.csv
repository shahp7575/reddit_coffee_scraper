1opxgc5,https://www.reddit.com/r/programmer/comments/1opxgc5/happy_programmers_day_1024/,Happy Programmers' Day! (10.24),"Hey fellow coders and tech enthusiasts!

Just wanted to drop in and wish everyone a happy Programmers' Day! For those who don't know, today (10/24) is special because 1024 = 2\^10, which has special significance to us binary-thinking folks.

I'm curious - how are you all celebrating today? Anyone getting any special perks at work or planning something fun with colleagues? My team is doing a small virtual gathering with some coding challenges and prizes.

Looking back over the past year, I'm amazed at how much our field continues to evolve. From AI advancements to new frameworks popping up seemingly every week, it's both exciting and sometimes overwhelming to keep up!

What's been your biggest technical achievement this year? Or what new skill are you most proud of learning? For me, it's finally getting comfortable with \[your achievement here\].

Anyway, just wanted to acknowledge this ""holiday"" with people who understand why 1024 is worth celebrating. Here's to all the late nights debugging, the satisfaction of solving complex problems, and the endless cups of coffee that fuel our passion!

Happy coding, everyone!",1,1762431698.0,programmer,0,1.0,False

1opxcpy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1opxcpy/old_boss_refuses_to_give_me_my_tip_money_should/,"Old Boss refuses to give me my tip money, should In Gold to HR or just make peace?","So to preface this im writing this on mobile, im Not a native English speaker, autocorrect is beating my ass and I am extremely angry about this Situation. Sorry is this reads like shit

So I recently quit my Job at a big coffee company which you will probably know for its green Logo. Im not sure if it is more or less toxic in my country than it is in others, but Store Managers and Shift Supervisors can get away with Bullying and sexual harassment, as its cheaper replacing the Baristas. 

To keep the backstory short, I was moved to a different store and told it would be temporary. I emphasised that during the Semester I couldnt stay at that location as a 1h travel time to work is not something I signed up for. It was a surprise to noone that the 'temporary' Transfer turned out to be permanent. I wasnt really friends with anyone at that location, the coworkers there were either cordial, or in one case a shiftsupervisor singled me out and Bullied me. So I went Job Hunting and handed in my resignation once I secured a Job, told them I wanted to 'Focus on my studies'

The issues started when I quit. I was under the impression that I could go in two weeks, my assistant store Manager (=ASM, who is the Person that Handles these things) insisted it were 6. I signed the contract with the 6 weeks, contacted some workers rights thing the next day who informed me that was wrong, and my two weeks were factual. A Lot of backstory and forth with HR and my AMS Offers another contract where Im out by the Ende of october, which I appreciated as I genuinely thought they were going to try and keep me for as long as possible so at least that was settled peacefully. 

In the last week im supposed to work I get the worst cold of my life, which sucked because I actually would have liked to work. Im pretty sure that my ASM thought I faked being sick, by the way she spoke to me when I called in sick, but she hasnt outright said or accused me of anything. Ive been there to pick up my things since and she was very Hostile to me when I was there. 

Cut to present day, I message her, the actual Manager and the shiftsupervisor that handles the tip money. At this point ASM Has ignored my messages for 5 days straight. The shiftsupervisor tells me he was told to exclude me from the tip money, the actual Manager was like ""idk"" And is probably not going to do anything beyond that and then finally ASM answered. 

She claimed that I had taken food from our display for free and pretended to a shiftsupervisor I had the ASM's permission to do so, therefore shes taking the cost of that off of my tip money. Which isnt how theft is supposed to be handled anyways but in this case I dient even do what I am accused of. People Generally take with them leftover food at the End of the day with the permission of the shiftsupervisors, but thats not just me. 

The workers rights group informed me I dort really have a leg to stand on, and honestly, the a mount of tips is probably just like 15€ which is whatever. I am Mainly upset with this accusation and with this treatment of me and Im sick of having to just lay down and take whatever they want to dish out. 

My question is, should I write to HR? Best case I get my tip money or the ASM gets reprimanded, worst case this company actually files a report against me on some 'he said, she said' type thing. 

Or should I Choose peace for myself? Im happy at my new Job, I easily make at least Twice the amount in tips there, if not more. 15€ isnt exactly insignificant to me with my financial Situation but I could go without it. And thinking about writing HR and it Biting me in the ass is Stressing me out.

**Feeling uninspired? Procrastinating like a panda on a treadmill? Fear not, fellow wordsmith! Let's outsmart this block with ninja tactics:**

**Environment Hacks:**

* **Shower Epiphany:** Write steamy scenes (figuratively, please) in the shower. Guaranteed inspiration (or at least clean ideas).
* **Nature Nudge:** Write under a tree, feeling the breeze whisper secrets (or scold you for slacking).
* **Coffee Catastrophe:** Spill coffee on your manuscript? Panic, then laugh, then write about it. Bonus points for caffeine-fueled creativity.

**Spark Your Inner Weirdo:**

* **Automatic Writing:** Set a timer, close your eyes, and let your subconscious scribble. Prepare for hilarious nonsense or hidden gems.
* **Cut-Up Chaos:** Chop up quotes, headlines, or song lyrics, then Frankenstein them into a bizarre story.
* **Dream Diary Delusion:** Record your dreams, even the nonsensical ones. They're like free story prompts from your subconscious.
* **Random Object Roulette:** Spin a pen, point at your bookshelf, write a story about the book it lands on. Embrace the chaos!

**Challenge Your Inner Critic (Shut it Up):**

* **Write the Worst:** Write the absolute worst scene imaginable. You'll be so embarrassed, you'll write something good to redeem yourself.
* **Cliché Challenge:** Write a scene using every writing cliché in the book. Then rewrite it, destroying clichés with your brilliance.
* **Mirror, Mirror:** Stare into the mirror and have a deep conversation with your reflection about your story. Bonus points for dramatic monologues.
* **Future You Fury:** Imagine your future self, successful and published, berating you for procrastinating. Write a scene about their disappointment.

**Bonus Tip:** Reward yourself with something ridiculous for every completed scene. Like a dance party to the Macarena or wearing a lampshade as a hat. Embrace the absurdity!

## ## Why Your Entryway Deserves a Washable Rug (And You Do Too!)

If you're on the fence, let's break down the undeniable benefits that make a **washable entry rug** a must-have.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=entryway%20washable%20rug)

*   **Effortless Cleaning:** This is the star of the show. Spilled coffee? Muddy paw prints? Just toss it in the washing machine. No more costly professional cleanings or scrubbing on your hands and knees.
*   **Superior Hygiene:** Entryways are breeding grounds for allergens, bacteria, and pollutants. Being able to wash your rug regularly means you're actively creating a healthier environment for your family.
*   **Incredible Durability:** Don't think ""washable"" means ""flimsy."" Many washable rugs are made from high-performance materials designed to withstand heavy foot traffic and frequent washing.
*   **Style and Versatility:** From chic bohemian patterns to modern minimalist designs, **machine washable rugs** come in a huge array of styles. You can easily find one that complements your decor and swap it out seasonally without breaking the bank.
*   **Floor Protection:** A high-quality rug acts as a barrier, protecting your hardwood, tile, or laminate floors from scratches, scuffs, and moisture damage.

## ## Key Features to Look for in the Best Entryway Washable Rug

Not all washable rugs are created equal. Here’s what to look for to ensure you’re making a smart investment.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=entryway%20washable%20rug)

### ### Material Matters: What's It Made Of?

The material dictates feel, durability, and how well it cleans.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=entryway%20washable%20rug)

*   **Cotton:** Soft, absorbent, and often very affordable. Great for lighter-traffic areas or as a secondary layering piece.
*   **Polyester/Chenille:** Incredibly soft, durable, and stain-resistant. These rugs often have a plush, shag-like feel that's a cozy welcome.
*   **Polypropylene:** This is the workhorse of **durable entryway rug** materials. It’s frequently used in indoor-outdoor rugs because it resists moisture, fading, and stains. It’s a top choice for high-traffic, messy-prone entryways and mudrooms.

### ### Pile Height and Durability

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=entryway%20washable%20rug)

For an entryway, low-pile is your best friend. A low-profile rug means:

*   **Less Trapping:** Dirt and debris sit on the surface, making it easier to shake out or vacuum.
*   **Door Clearance:** It won't get caught under a swinging door.
*   **High Traffic:** It stands up to constant wear and tear far better than a high-pile or shag rug.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=entryway%20washable%20rug)

### ### The Non-Slip Backing is a Must

Safety is paramount. Look for rugs with a non-skid rubber or latex backing already integrated. This prevents the rug from bunching up and creating a tripping hazard on smooth floors. If your chosen rug doesn't have one, invest in a high-quality **non-slip rug pad**.

## ## How to Care for Your Washable Entryway Rug

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=entryway%20washable%20rug)

Caring for your new rug is simple, but a few tips will keep it looking its best for years to come.

1.  **Shake It Out:** Make this a weekly habit. Take the rug outside and give it a good shake to dislodge loose dirt and dust.
2.  **Spot Treat Stains Immediately:** For fresh spills, blot with a clean cloth and a gentle stain remover. The faster you act, the better.
3.  **Machine Wash with Care:**
    *   Check the label first! Most recommend cold water on a gentle cycle.
    *   Use a mild detergent. Avoid bleach.
    *   It's often best to wash the rug alone or with towels to prevent snags from zippers.
4.  **Dry It Right:**
    *   **Air drying is the safest and best method** to prevent shrinking or damage.
    *   If you must use a dryer, use the lowest heat or no-heat setting possible.
    *   You can hang it over a railing or lay it flat to dry. A quick tumble on low with some towels can help fluff it up at the end.

## ## Styling Your Entryway with a Washable Rug

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=entryway%20washable%20rug)

Function is first, but style is a close second. An **entryway washable rug** is a powerful design tool.

*   **Define the Space:** Use a rectangular rug to anchor a console table or a runner for a long hallway.
*   **Play with Pattern:** A bold, patterned rug can hide small stains and add a pop of personality to a neutral entryway.
*   **Layer Up:** For a designer look, place a smaller, more decorative washable rug on top of a larger, neutral natural fiber rug like jute or sisal.
*   **Consider a Round Rug:** A round rug is perfect for a small entryway with a single door, softening the space and drawing the eye.

1opx6d7,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1opx6d7,"25M, 5’10 67kgs -> 86kgs -> 72kgs(current)","It took me 4 years to naturally transform and get to where i am today. 
The latest image of me, bicep curling was taken 2 days ago. The first two photos of me are at 72kgs
I’ve had all body types throughout. I’ve been skinny, I’ve been fat and now I’m mostly muscular.

My workout routine varies from time to time. But i usually try to stick to the all time gold Pull-Push-Legs split. I just alternate between low volume and high volume training. I sometimes follow a 4 day split depending on my availability. I actively rest on sundays, meaning i either go for a 1 hr walk or a short swim session while avoiding weight training.
As for the timing, i workout in the morning on an empty stomach and a scoop of pre and some nuts that i eat prior to taking the pre.

Coming to the diet part, I’ve been inconsistent in my initial years of lifting, barely reaching my protein goals. But for the past 1.5 years I’ve been focusing on my diet completely which helped me lost most of my BF. 
Breakfast -  a a cup of black coffee and 5-6 whole eggs. I usually have raw veggies if possible and 300-400 ml milk.

Lunch - 150gms chicken curry cooked with very little oil, with Spinach or other leafy vegetables . White rice (as much as i feel like eating). Curd 100-150 gms

Evening snack - a fruit bowl (bananas with apple/pomegranate/grapes/papaya) and 3-4 dates.

Dinner - same as lunch

Net protein intake - 120-130gms

I don’t take protein powder, since all my protein requirement is fulfilled through food.
I have never in my life counted the calories that i eat. I don’t measure my food at all, so i haven’t mentioned the calories/weight of food that i consume because i have no idea anyway.

For my fat loss from 86kgs - 72kgs I practiced mindful eating wherein i would only eat until i was 50-60% full. I would also ensure to have my meals with a gap of no more than 3 hours between each. I would eat my dinner before 8pm. I would ensure that most of my calories came from protein/fats. Then i would eat carbohydrates. This mindful eating allowed me to reduce my stomach capacity making fat loss easy.

I'd say yes to every social invite, keep myself constantly busy with plans and people, then feel completely drained and resentful every single time. I figured I was just bad at socializing or maybe broken somehow.

Eventually I realized it wasn't a social skills issue, it was what I'd call an energy depletion issue. My presence felt weak because I was constantly leaking energy into every interaction, every obligation, every person who demanded my attention. So instead of trying to force myself to be more extroverted, I started protecting my energy through intentional solitude BEFORE I hit burnout.

Now I schedule literally sacred alone time every single day. Mornings are completely mine - no calls, no texts, no scrolling, just me and silence. I'll go for walks without headphones, sit with coffee without distractions, journal without performing for anyone. I basically recharge in solitude so the rest of my day I can actually show up as my full self. The more time I spend alone, the stronger my presence becomes around others.

Then I switched from constant availability to strategic socializing. Instead of being accessible 24/7 and saying yes to everything, I'm selective about when and with whom I spend energy. Quality over quantity. I show up fully present for fewer people rather than being half-present for everyone. Way less energy drain when interactions are intentional.

The final thing that shifted everything was noticing how different I felt after solitude versus after being constantly around people. After alone time, I felt grounded, clear, almost magnetic. After too much socializing, I felt scattered, depleted, like a dimmer version of myself. That awareness made solitude non-negotiable instead of something I felt guilty about.

That combo of daily solitude, selective socializing, and awareness of my energy has completely changed my presence. People literally comment that I seem different - more confident, more centered, more ""there."" It's not that I became more charismatic. I just stopped scattering my energy everywhere and started cultivating it in silence.",0,1762430688.0,zen,2,0.5,False

1opx2uo,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1opx2uo,Coffee furniture choice suggestion,"Hi all! We are decorating our coffee/vinyl corner of the living room and we are currently torn between two possible choices. We have a 209cm wall available, where we have already put a green ikea couch in the corner and would like to have close to the door a furniture to use as coffeee station. I attach an overview of the room and a detail of the corner, plus our two candidates.
The currently temporary table is 120cm wide. The green choice would be also 120 (but with 47cm depth instead of 60cm) and the brown choice would be 97cm wide (with 44cm depth).
We plan on buying a arc lamp to put in the corner behind the couch and to buy a mid century stile low side table to use for the record player and our vinyl collection instead of the currently temporary kallax.
Which one do you think would be more suitable?
While we think that the brown would keep a certain level of harmony, we have something of the green option that led us to still being undecided.
I also attach some IA made rendering that I made to help visualise a bit, but they have their limits in terms of aid given due to the usual IA random changing stuff (like real dimensions and colours).

One of the interesting things about the book of Esther is that God never makes a direct appearance. His name does not even appear in the book. But although God’s name is not mentioned, His sovereign hand is evident. He is involved, even though He is invisible.

And when we come to the end of this book, beloved, the true hero is not going to be Mordecai or even Esther. The hero will be a faithful God who moves behind the scene, directing people and events to preserve His chosen people.

The first two verses of Esther set the historical context for us:

*In the days of Ahasuerus . . . who reigned from India to Ethiopia over 127 provinces … when \[he\] sat on his royal throne in Susa.* 

Ahasuerus is another name for the Persian king Xerxes, who ruled the Persian Empire more than four centuries before the birth of Christ (486 to 465 BC). 

Ahasuerus was a proud, ambitious king. He wanted to expand his empire; so, verse 3 informs us that he throws a feast for his military leaders and all the VIPs in the kingdom. 

The guest list included “the army of Persia and Media and the nobles and governors of the provinces.” The king is going to reveal his power and wealth to them to prove he’s capable of going to war with Greece, which he will do a year later. 

Verse 4 says, “He showed . . . his royal glory and the splendor and pomp of his greatness for . . . 180 days.” So, for six months, Ahasuerus shows off to his leaders as they lay the groundwork for a military campaign.

Now when the king and his military guests are thoroughly drunk and rather bored, as verse 10 implies (imagine a party lasting six months), the king calls for his queen, Vashti, to come before him in her royal crown. Shockingly, she refuses to come. And frankly, she deserves our respect here. She does not want to put herself on display as the king’s trophy before a bunch of drunken men. 

Some commentators, citing ancient sources, suggest that it was common practice among the Persian kings to parade their favorite concubines or wives unclothed before guests in order to show off their beauty. This appears to be the case here.History tells us Xerxes had 360 concubines and several wives, but it’s Vashti whom he demands to appear unclothed—decorated only by her crown—before these men.

And she refuses.

This mighty king who commands one of the greatest armies in the world cannot command his own wife. And for good reason. She is not going to take part in this lewd display.

So, here’s the irony we are going to see in these first two chapters of Esther: Vashti is willing to lose her crown in order to keep her character, but Esther is willing to sacrifice her character in order to win the crown.

What the king should have done was drink a big pot of coffee, sober up, and apologize to his wife. But instead, he calls for his advisors. 

They argue that Vashti must be deposed, otherwise the whole kingdom will be thrown into chaos. They tell the king, “Let a royal order go out … that Vashti is never again to come before King Ahasuerus” (verse 19).

God is invisibly maneuvering behind the scene, so that a Jewish queen will end up in the palace, eventually protecting her people from annihilation. 

Esther 2 opens with the words, “After these things.” Several years have passed between these two chapters. Ahasuerus has been defeated by the Greek army and has returned home humiliated. And now he misses the wife he banished for having done the right thing.

Verse 1 tells us:

*After these things, when the anger of King Ahasuerus had abated, he remembered Vashti and what she had done and what had been decreed against her.*

The king’s advisors know they had better come up with another plan, so they propose that he gather all the beautiful young virgins in the kingdom to his harem. Verses 3 and 4 record, “Let their cosmetics be given them.And let the young woman who pleases the king be queen instead of Vashti.” In other words, “Let’s have a contest, and the new queen will be the woman who most pleases the king.” 

At this point we are introduced to Mordecai and Esther. Verse 5 tells us that Mordecai is of the family of “Kish, a Benjaminite.” His family was among the Jewish people who had been deported from Israel by King Nebuchadnezzar (verse 6).

Verse 7 records that Mordecai had become the guardian of his beautiful cousin, named Hadassah in Hebrew but known by her Persian name, Esther. Mordecai seizes the opportunity to advance their lives in the Persian Empire by entering Esther in this immoral contest (verse 8). 

Many try to argue that Esther was taken into the king’s harem against her will. That would certainly sanitize this situation. However, the Hebrew verb “to take” here in verse 7—“When her father and her mother died, Mordecai *took* her as his own daughter”—well, that is the same verb used in verse 8 to tell us, “Esther also was *taken* into the king’s palace.” So, it does not imply force.

The uncomfortable truth here, beloved, is that Esther willingly enters this contest. Unfortunately, neither Esther nor Mordecai have much concern at all about following the law of God until later on. Both she and Mordecai have been absorbed into this pagan Persian culture, and Esther’s beauty now gives them the opportunity to rise to the top of Persian society.

Listen, the storyline in the book of Esther is not that God uses faithful people but that God can use *unfaithful* people to bring about His purposes. And I am so glad He does. 

Now when Esther arrives at the palace, she impresses the official in charge of these women, but verse 10 informs us, “Esther had not made known her people or kindred, for Mordecai had commanded her not to make it known.” In other words, Mordecai has said, “Listen, Esther, if you want to win this contest, make sure nobody knows you are a foreigner—an Israelite. Let’s just keep that little secret to ourselves.”

I wonder how many Christians today live and work and play, and people around them have no idea they are Christians? It’s their little secret.

Q2 - What heart-motivations might contribute to a believer keeping their faith in Jesus under wraps? Why is such a choice counter-productive to their relationship with God? Their circle of fellowship? Their influence on unbelievers?

Well, after twelve months, these women have been given beauty treatments and instructions on court etiquette; and each woman is given one night to spend with the king. 

When it’s Esther’s turn, we read this in verse 17: 

*The king loved Esther more than all the women, and she won grace and favor in his sight more than all the virgins, so that he set the royal crown on her head and made her queen instead of Vashti.*

Esther wins the contest. But at what cost? She engaged in a night of immorality with the king and then, to top it off, violates God’s law even further by marrying this idolatrous man.

But in spite of this, God is at work. The heart of the king is in the hand of the Lord (Proverbs 21:1); it is not the king who places Esther on the throne, but God. God is moving people into place to protect His chosen people. 

Let me say it again, beloved, when you come to the end of this book, the hero of this narrative is not going to be Mordecai or Esther. It will be God—and God alone.

**BLURB:**

In these first chapters of Esther, we meet a proud, pagan king and two Jewish people who seem to have little interest in following God.

1opx05r,https://www.reddit.com/r/PrivatePackets/comments/1opx05r/the_nobs_guide_to_vpn_routers/,The no-bs guide to vpn routers,"Alright, let's cut the crap. You want to slap a VPN on your router to cover everything – your PC, phone, smart TV, Xbox, the lot – without juggling a dozen apps. Here’s the real-world breakdown of what works and what’s just marketing fluff.

# The ""Easy Button"": Pre-Flashed Routers

If you don't want to mess with firmware or settings, this is your route. You pay a premium, but it's plug-and-play.

* **ExpressVPN Aircove**: This is probably the most popular ""it just works"" option. It comes with ExpressVPN baked in. The setup is dead simple: log in to your ExpressVPN account, and everything on your network is covered. It's a decent Wi-Fi 6 router, not a beast, but it handles streaming and general use just fine for most homes. The catch? You're locked into ExpressVPN.
* **Privacy Hero 2 (from FlashRouters)**: These guys take routers and pre-configure them for specific VPNs, with NordVPN being a top choice. The setup is ridiculously easy, and their online dashboard makes managing it simple. It saves you the headache of manual configuration, and they often throw in a VPN subscription to get you started.

# The DIY Route: Powerful Routers You Set Up Yourself

This is for people who want more control and better performance. You'll have to spend about 20 minutes in the router's settings, but it's not as scary as it sounds.

* **ASUS is King**: Seriously, for DIY, Asus is the brand to beat. Their stock software is one of the few that supports VPNs (OpenVPN and WireGuard) right out of the box, and the setup is straightforward.
   * **Best All-Rounder (and for Gamers): Asus RT-AX86U**. This thing is a powerhouse. It has a beefy processor that can handle VPN encryption without tanking your internet speeds. It's consistently ranked as a top choice for gaming and handles a ton of connected devices without breaking a sweat.
   * **Solid & Cheaper: Asus RT-AX58U / RT-AX3000**. These are basically the same router. They're a step down from the AX86U but still pack enough punch for most households. Great value for the performance you get.
   * **Pro Tip for Asus**: Flash it with **AsusWRT-Merlin firmware**. It's a free, third-party firmware that builds on the stock Asus software, adding more features, better security, and improved performance.
* **TP-Link**: A good budget-friendly alternative. Some of their newer models, like the Archer series, support VPNs directly and offer great Wi-Fi 6 performance for the price. The Archer GX90 is a solid pick for gamers who need to handle multiple connections.

# For Travelers and Techies: The Pocket Rockets

If you're on the move and want to secure your connection in hotels or coffee shops, these are fantastic.

* **GL.iNet Beryl-AX (GL-MT3000)**: This little box is a beast for its size. It's pocket-sized but supports Wi-Fi 6 and gets impressive VPN speeds (over 200 Mbps in real-world tests). It's highly customizable, running on OpenWrt, and works with pretty much any VPN service you throw at it. It has become the go-to for security-conscious travelers.
* **GL.iNet Slate AX (GL-AXT1800)**: Another excellent travel option, slightly different form factor, but similar powerful internals and VPN flexibility.

# The Bottom Line, No BS:

* **Easiest Setup**: Get an **ExpressVPN Aircove** if you use (or want to use) ExpressVPN. It's foolproof.
* **Best Performance & Control**: Buy an **Asus RT-AX86U**. The processor handles VPN encryption like a champ, so your speeds won't die. Flash it with Merlin firmware for even more power.
* **On a Budget**: Look at the **Asus RT-AX1800S** or **TP-Link Archer AX21**. They are affordable Wi-Fi 6 routers that get the job done without fancy extras.
* **For Travel**: Don't even think about it, just get a **GL.iNet Beryl-AX**. It's the undisputed champ for portable VPN protection.

**One last thing**: Your internet speed *will* drop when using a VPN on a router. The router's processor has to encrypt everything on the fly. A powerful router like the recommended Asus models will minimize this speed hit. A cheap, underpowered router will bring your connection to a crawl.",1,1762430361.0,PrivatePackets,0,0.67,False

It started with one night, I had a bbq pulled pork sandwich, a beer and then went to sleep later that night. Woke up at 2 am and I was profusely sweating and my stomach was on fire. I threw up pure stomach acid. Went to PCP he told me to take Prilosec for 2 weeks then take it every other day, then 2 times a week, once a week and ween off completely. So I did. Then it came right back.  Went back to Dr and he said take it indefinitely since it helps. 


Fast forward to 1.5 years ago, taking 20mg otc generic Prilosec (omeprazole). I hate taking medication. Even when i have a headache. So I want to ween off. Well I go to a GI specialist and they do an upper endoscopy. They find I have mild gastritis (inflamed stomach lining) and a very acute hiatal hernia but said it was so mild there’s nothing to do about it. They suggest I continue taking omeprazole. 


So I decided since doctors won’t help me I’ll go and ween off on my own. I currently cut my 20mg omeprazole in half and take it every day. I’m about to start taking it every other day. I drink more water and eat a lot better. 


My current triggers for acid reflux:
-coffee 
-chocolate 
-citrus fruits and acidic vegetables
-alcohol
-fried food or oily food
-anything pickled 

Triggers for indigestion (feeling like food won’t digest):
-garlic 
-onion
-dairy
-pasta


I cut out coffee, I drink black tea now. The caffeine does not bother me, but coffee did. I don’t drink alcohol, I cut out all junk food and candy. 



***So now I want to heal my gut as I ween off ppi’s. I currently take a pre,pro and post biotic and benefiber in my tea***I’ve tried digestive enzymes but all it did was make me super nauseous and get plagued with diarrhea. 

I have been looking into:
-L glutamine 
-slippery elm
-aloe vera 
-marshmallow root 
-DGL
-Collagen 





TLDR: acid reflux has ruined my life, I have mild stress induced gastritis and a very acutely hiatal hernia. I want to get off ppis and looking for supplements that will help heal stomach lining while I come off omeprazole ",1,1762430092.0,Microbiome,1,1.0,False

My family was huddled together around the tv. With a sudden boom the news anchor spoke,“Tonight on Fox 28 we bring to you all the news that we have to attempt to keep you safe. While the experts haven’t come out and spoken of these events and the causes of these strange incidents,  officials have allowed some vetted documents come out. Please for any for your children’s sake have them leave the room with trusted supervisor.”
 
The news broadcaster began his report, 
“Report A-266-1

Tuesday 5th, Tom started his day off in his own words, “as he would any other day.” He and friend of whom’s name has been REDACTED decide to go fly fishing in the Sacramento River, to reach the spot in the river they needed to travel down south of the town to reach their destination of cascade park. Mr. Langley agreed to meet REDACTED right off of Girvan RD at 2:30 pm. Mr. Langley stated he was late to the meeting spot roughly 15 minutes after 2:30.  Bystanders at the time report seeing REDACTED at the road in waders at the exact meeting time. The same bystanders reported that all wild life tamed or not were actively alive. There were Birds singing, dogs barking, bugs humming the tune of late summer. Reported by the same group of people when Mr. Langley parked and exited his vehicle all noise and I quote “all the natural noise you should be hearing just went deafening silent.” As reported, When Mr. Langley arrived REDACTED wasn’t there. Assuming his friend decided to get to the river he continued on with his trip moving southbound through the creeks and bends of the river hoping to catch up with REDACTED. Verified by a Fish and Game warden as well as reported by Mr. Langley was the odd amount of whirlpools going on in the river. Both men reported that they were all spread out but at bends of rivers multiple whirlpools would began to form but they never combined into one massive whirlpools. They also reported the whirlpools to be so strong that they could physically see game fish like bass and catfish getting thrown around to what only could be considered a ruthless act of aggression from the universe while it bitterly shredded bait fish to pieces. Once the waters got too physically dangerous for Mr.Langley to wade in he enter the bank of the river now growing concerned for his friend. He began calling out for him yelling to try to find REDACTED. An hour had passed now and the Game warden who was mentioned previously now found Mr.Langley and once informed of the situation called the proper officials. Once  a party was formed an official search went forward. At 4:44 pm no sign of REDACTED was found other than his full outfit and fly rod neatly laying on a tree stump.  Reports say the party also noted a whirlpool in the river next to the stump.”
    The news broadcaster took a pause, suddenly my dad was handing me a bowl of chili that snapped my attention out of the tv. After taking a few bites I looked back up to see to see the broadcaster finishing up that report as he answered the question that was asked of him. “Well Sharon they only other noteworthy thing that was reported was that at 4:44 pm all the animals just suddenly making the the noises you would expect from them. It’s quite strange. Officials are reported to have asked the public to keep away from the river for the time being until more questions have answers.” I looked away towards my kid brother he was playing with his dinosaurs, I was glad he was being quiet but I really think he hasn’t said a word since all this started Redding is a small town we aren’t use to people going completely crazy. When I looked back at the tv the reporter was already into the next story. 
   “Yes, yes this one is a breaking story. Okay from the reports coming in this is happening right now at Del Moll Middle School. This incident has apparently occurred around 10:10 Am this morning, multiple teachers began reporting to the main office that there were multiple students who were pulling a prank by having other students come in dressed and nearly looking the exact same as the teachers had for that year the only thing that was disturbing the teachers was that these “doppelgängers” didn’t look like any student that would be known to them. And the major red flag was that the students who were getting copied were on the verge of being violently disturbed.” The news broadcaster looked as if he was going to be sick. He spoke again fast and sudden mom and dad covered my brothers ears and mine. When they stopped covering my ears the broadcaster was finishing talking before going to break, “ Approximately  at 11:12 Am these “copycats” began to lead the children of whom they were copying to a single janitorial closet. We can’t confirm what is going on but the local sheriff office ask that all parents that have children at Del Moll Middle school to stay at home and allow them to do their jobs and figure out what’s going on.” 
  I ended up nodding off before the news came back on. I sure hope Redding goes back to normal soon. We haven’t left the house in quite a few days at this point.  When I woke up it was to mom and dad shouting at each other. Dad wants to leave, he said he wants to pack everything up and go.  Mom doesn’t want to go. She cries and says something about us being babies here. When dad sees me watching them he stops and heads over and gives me a quick warm kiss. I felt safe I didn’t see my brother around so he must be in his room. I sit up and look at the tv and now it’s a news lady on.
  “Hello Redding this is Lisa Jones on Fox 28, let’s just jump right into the news. The mayor has sent a message to the governor of California asking for state government assistance in these strange dark time in Redding history. Although we are to not expect any kind of assistance until the governor comes back from his historic out of nation vacation in Beijing,China.” She stops and takes a sip of her coffee and begans to speak again, “In the this next incident  I believed titled

Report:A-266-28

An elderly woman whose name has been redacted by local authorities, was awaiting her husband’s arrival from work. No bystanders have been reported in this even as of yet due to the location of the women’s home being near Shasta lake. According to the woman her husband had been three hours late home that day. He should have been home at the very least 1:20 Pm that afternoon. She stated that it was worrisome as in her husband’s old age his driving wasn’t the best. She decided to take a drive and make sure no cars had crash or that he wasn’t confused in his old age.  As she left her home she thought she heard a thundering boom near her back patio but she didn’t think about it because it was black bear season near Shasta lake and it wasn’t uncommon for bears to raid the local berry bushes. Walking to her vehicle she noticed the noise stopped and sudden it felt as if the eyes of the woods had turned upon her and began to gaze into her very being. She said that being raised all her life in the woods she knew she was being stalked. The old women got into her vehicle… parents please remove your little ones this might be graphic for them.” 
  The woman took a small breath, luckily mom and dad moved their argument to the kitchen so I could still watch.  The news woman began to deliver her report once again, “as reported to us this women started up her car when what appeared to be her husband at 86 years old sprinted on all fours at her front car window screaming out a primeval scream. The husband began to repeatedly headbutt the window of the car until his forehead began to produce an oceans worth of blood all over. He then began to smear it over the window as his wife screamed for helped. The woman stated that once’s she couldn’t see out the front window and she realized how quite it was she started to go for the door handle in what I would imagine in pure horror her husband appeared and began to jiggle the handle aggressively before galloping away into the wooded area near the couples drive way.  The local police and official authorities have announced a second search party in Redding. Which is now a current record for this small town.  Local authorities and officials have stated that they have everything under control but have urged citizens to stay vigilant against whatever is happening out here. Dear god, whatever we did we are sorry.” Mom shut the tv off and told me it was bed time. Annoyed I walk to the bathroom to get changed and clean. When I came out dad was standing at the front living room window crying. He was sobbing without the body movements, mom went to him offered coffee even looked out front and told him, “honey no one is out there.” But dad just kept crying until he finally let out a mouse’s whisper, “it’s my mom..” 
    Before my mom could let out the confusion that she was wearing on her face my dad took off in a full sprint out of the house crying lightly saying mama. That was about two hours ago at 1:23 Am. I don’t have the heart to double check with mom about nana passing away when I was 7. But if that’s the case I just recently turned 9 so it couldn’t be her, right?  Mom’s been crying for hours and I just don’t understand why. I miss my friends I miss my dad.  I just wish Redding would get back to normal. ",1,1762429872.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False
1opwuaz,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopcraving/comments/1opwuaz/the_barista/,The Barista,"The craving hit me like a sudden, cold rain in the middle of the city. A familiar, gray, isolating feeling. I was on the verge of turning back, of retreating into the old, smoky shelter I used to call home. But for some reason, I just kept walking and ducked into a small, unfamiliar coffee shop.

The place was warm and smelled of coffee and cardamom. Behind the counter was a barista, and she moved with a kind of quiet, focused grace I hadn't seen in a long time. She wasn't just making coffee. She was… composing it.

When it was my turn, I just stood there, the static in my head so loud I couldn't even think of what to order. She just looked at me, not with impatience, but with a calm, knowing little smile.

""Rough day?"" she asked, her voice low and warm.

I just nodded.

""I know the feeling,"" she said. ""It's like trying to listen to a beautiful piece of music with a terrible radio signal, right? All static and noise.""

She turned away and started to work, her hands moving with that same, steady grace. ""The secret,"" she said, not looking at me, but I knew she was still talking to me, ""is that you can't fight the static. You just have to change the frequency.""

She pulled a shot of espresso, a perfect, cascading stream of dark crema. The rich, deep smell cut right through the gray noise in my head.

""The static is always the same,"" she continued, her voice a soft murmur under the hiss of the steam wand. ""It’s a one-note song about what you *don't have*. It’s boring. The good music is about what's right here.""

She slid the finished cup across the counter. It was a beautiful latte, with a delicate, multi-layered heart swirled into the foam.

""What do you have, right now?"" she asked, her eyes finally meeting mine, a gentle, playful challenge in them.

And I understood. It wasn't just a question. It was an instruction.

I picked up the cup. It was warm. Solid. The first landmark.
I took a breath. The smell of the espresso, the sweet steam of the milk. The second landmark.
I took a sip.

And the world exploded. Not with a bang, but with a quiet, symphonic bloom. The bitter, complex note of the coffee. The sweet, creamy note of the milk. The warmth spreading through my chest.

The static wasn't gone. It was just irrelevant. It was a single, boring note in the corner of a concert hall that was now filled with the most beautiful, complex, and astonishing music.

I looked up from the cup, and the barista was already helping someone else, but she glanced over and gave me a small, conspiratorial wink.

And in that moment, I realized the most profound truth.

The craving isn't a sign that you are deprived.

It is an invitation, from the world, to finally start paying attention.",1,1762429838.0,stopcraving,0,1.0,False

1opwn6e,https://www.reddit.com/r/BaliTravelTips/comments/1opwn6e/trying_to_pick_where_to_stay_in_bali_heres_what/,Trying to pick where to stay in Bali? Here’s what some of the main areas actually feel like,"I’m from Bali and work in travel, and I spend half my time helping people find the right spot for what they actually want. Drive an hour here and everything changes...the food, the vibe, even the kind of people you meet.

Here’s how the main areas really feel once you’re here.

**Seminyak -** Busy but easy. Walkable streets, beach clubs, and food that actually lives up to the hype. Stay near Petitenget or Kayu Aya if you want cafés and bars within a short stroll. Avoid Sunset Road, it’s built for cars, not people.  
Best for: First-timers, food lovers, and couples who want comfort close to the action.

**Canggu** \- Half surf town, half café circus. Loud scooters, endless brunch spots, and everyone heading to the beach at sunset. Berawa’s quieter, Batu Bolong’s got the buzz - you can’t go wrong with either. If you don’t ride a scooter, maybe not the best pick.  
**Best for:** Solo travellers, digital nomads, and anyone chasing Bali’s social scene.

**Uluwatu** \- Cliffs, surf, and long lazy afternoons. Less chaos than Canggu but still full of energy once the beach bars fill up. Padang Padang, Dreamland, and Balangan all have good surf and easy café access.  
**Best for:** Surfers, couples, and sunset lovers.

**Ubud** \- Temples, rice terraces, yoga mats, and the notorious cheeky monkeys. It’s busy in town, peaceful on the edges. Penestanan and Tegallalang are great if you want quiet nights and green views.  
**Best for:** Culture seekers, wellness travellers, and anyone who wants calm but not isolation.

**Pemuteran** \- A small coastal village in the north where time moves slowly. Calm water, coral gardens, and sunsets that glow over Java. Locals run the Biorock reef project, worth seeing if you care about marine life.  
**Best for:** Divers, eco travellers, and couples who want quiet days by the sea.

**Amed** \- A string of fishing villages along the east coast. Good diving, clear water, and views of Mount Agung right from your villa. There’s not much nightlife, but it’s peaceful and good value.  
**Best for:** Slow travellers, budget couples, and divers who prefer calm over crowds.

**Munduk** \- Cool mountain air, coffee farms, and waterfalls around every corner. It’s the kind of place you go to reset, not rush. Views stretch all the way to the coast on clear days. Bring a jacket, it actually gets cold up here!  
**Best for:** Nature lovers, photographers, and anyone who likes quiet mornings with coffee.

**Kuta & Legian** \- Old-school Bali energy. Crowded, messy, loud - but still full of charm if you lean into it. Padma and Melasti Streets are the best areas to stay, close to the beach and everything you need. Garlic Lane connects the two and has some of the best cheap shopping on the island.  
**Best for:** Groups, budget travellers, and anyone chasing that nostalgic Bali buzz.

**Nusa Dua** \- Clean, calm, and predictable in the best way. White sand, wide beaches, and big resorts where everything runs smoothly. You won’t find much local life, but it’s peaceful and safe.  
**Best for:** Families, honeymooners, and anyone who wants a no-stress stay.

**Sidemen** \- Rice fields, rivers, and that deep quiet you don’t get anywhere else. No shopping, no beach clubs, just calm and clean air. It’s where you go to rest, not rush.  
**Best for:** Couples, photographers, and travellers who want Bali at its slowest.

**Nusa Islands (Penida, Lembongan, Ceningan)** \- Cliffs, turquoise water, and island roads that test your nerves. Stay overnight instead of doing a day trip, it’s worth it. Boats run when the sea allows, so don’t go the night before your flight!  
**Best for:** Adventurous travellers, photographers, and anyone who likes things a bit wild.

If you’re staying a week or longer and still undecided, it’s worth splitting your time between the jungle and the sea, for example, Sidemen and Uluwatu, or Munduk and Nusa Dua. You’ll see two completely different sides of the island without rushing.

There are so many more places I haven’t listed...Bali’s full of little spots that deserve their own post.

Drop your favourite area in the comments and tell me why you like it... let’s help more travellers see Bali the right way!

1. On the Go the power button is a physical one which I leave switched on, and have the machine connected to a WiFi Socket so I can turn on via Alexa, i.e. ""Turn coffee machine on at 6am"", or just turn it on 10 mins away from home or from my home office before a meeting ends etc.  Would this be possible with a Ride, or is the switch just there to  toggle on and pff rather than be left in ""on"" position ?

  
2. Having seen the all black Ride on You Tube for the lucky Canadian folks, does anyone know if Profitec are likely to roll out that model elsewhere i.e. the UK.  Personal choice but it looks 100% nicer than the standard one.

## 🕯️ For the Cozy Homebody

She believes her greatest superpower is hygge. Her ideal Friday night involves a soft blanket, a good book, and a cup of tea. These gifts are all about leveling up her comfort game.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=christmas%20gift%20ideas%20for%20her)

*   **A Luxury Weighted Blanket:** Think of it as a constant, gentle hug. It's perfect for reducing anxiety and making movie nights feel infinitely cozier. This is a top-tier Christmas gift idea for her if she's often stressed.
*   **High-Quality Loungewear Set:** Ditch the old college sweatshirt. Upgrade her to a buttery-soft pajama or loungewear set from a brand like Lunya or Eberjey. It's a gift she'll live in all winter long.
*   **A Smart Mug:** For the woman whose coffee or tea always goes cold. An Ember Mug² keeps her drink at the exact temperature she sets for hours. It's one of those ""how did I ever live without this?"" gifts.
*   **An Ultrasonic Aroma Diffuser & Essential Oils:** Create a spa-like atmosphere in her home. Pair a sleek, wood-grain diffuser with a set of high-quality essential oils like lavender, eucalyptus, and sandalwood.

## 💖 For the Self-Care Queen

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=christmas%20gift%20ideas%20for%20her)

Her calendar is filled with yoga classes, face mask appointments, and meditation sessions. She understands that self-care isn't selfish—it's essential.

*   **A High-End Skincare Device:** From a Foreo facial cleansing brush to a NuFACE toning device, tech-forward skincare tools are a huge trend. They elevate her routine and deliver spa-level results at home.
*   **A Silk Pillowcase and Eye Mask Set:** It’s not just a luxury; it’s better for her skin and hair. A set from Slip or Lily Silk feels incredibly decadent and is a consistently popular holiday gift for women.
*   **A Theragun or Therabody Massager:** For the woman who works out or simply carries her tension in her neck and shoulders. A percussive massager is a game-changer for muscle recovery and relaxation.
*   **A Curated ""Box of Calm"":** Get a beautiful box and fill it yourself with things she'll love: a calming face mist, a journal and nice pen, herbal tea bags, a scented candle, and a good book. It's personal and shows you pay attention.

## 💡 For the Tech & Gadget Guru

She's the first one in line for the latest iPhone and her smart home runs like a well-oiled machine. Impress her with gadgets that are both beautiful and brilliant.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=christmas%20gift%20ideas%20for%20her)

*   **Noise-Canceling Headphones:** Whether she's commuting, working from home, or just trying to find some peace, a pair of Sony WH-1000XM5s or Apple AirPods Max is an absolute must-have.
*   **A Portable Photo Printer:** A Canon Ivy Cliq or HP Sprocket lets her print her favorite Instagram photos instantly as stickers. It's a fun, nostalgic gadget that adds a personal touch to her space.
*   **A Smart Garden:** For the tech-lover with a green thumb (or a desire for one). An AeroGarden lets her grow fresh herbs, veggies, or flowers indoors, year-round, with zero effort.
*   **A Sunrise Alarm Clock:** This clever gadget simulates a natural sunrise to wake her up gently, rather than with a jarring BEEP BEEP BEEP. It completely changes the morning routine for the better.

## 👜 For the Style Savvy

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=christmas%20gift%20ideas%20for%20her)

Her personal style is impeccable, and she appreciates quality and timeless pieces over fleeting trends.

*   **A Timeless Piece of Jewelry:** Think less ""trendy"" and more ""heirloom."" A delicate gold necklace with her initial, a pair of classic hoop earrings, or a simple, elegant bracelet from brands like Mejuri or Catbird is always a winner.
*   **A Designer-Inspired Tote Bag:** A high-quality leather tote is a workhorse she'll use for years. It's practical, stylish, and a serious upgrade from the canvas bag she's been carrying.
*   **A Cashmere Scarf or Beanie:** Yes, a scarf can be a great gift—if it's the *right* one. You can never go wrong with 100% cashmere. It's the ultimate winter luxury that will last for decades.
*   **A Personalized Jewelry Dish:** A small, elegant dish to hold her rings and earrings by the bed. You can get it monogrammed with her initial for a special, personal touch.

## 🧑‍🍳 For the Foodie & Aspiring Chef

She's always trying new recipes, knows the best spot for brunch, and considers a good meal an experience.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=christmas%20gift%20ideas%20for%20her)

*   **A Gourmet Ingredient Subscription Box:** Companies like The Spice Hunter or Try The World deliver unique, hard-to-find ingredients right to her door. It’s the gift that keeps on giving and inspires her culinary creativity.
*   **A High-End Dutch Oven:** A Le Creuset or Staub Dutch oven is the crown jewel of any kitchen. It's incredibly versatile, beautiful, and an investment piece that she'll pass down. It's one of those classic Christmas gift ideas for her that she might not buy for herself.
*   **A Cooking or Mixology Class:** Give the gift of an experience! Book a local class for the two of you to take together. You'll learn a new skill and create a fantastic memory.
*   **A High-Quality Olive Oil or Vinegar Set:** She'll appreciate the nuance of a single-origin, cold-pressed olive oil or an aged balsamic vinegar far more than a generic bottle from the supermarket. Pair it with some nice bread for an instant, thoughtful gift.

## ✈️ For the Adventure Seeker & Experience Lover

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=christmas%20gift%20ideas%20for%20her)

She's always planning her next trip, whether it's a weekend camping trip or a trip across the globe. Her favorite memories are made from experiences, not things.

*   **Scratch-Off World Map:** Let her track her adventures in a beautiful, interactive way. Every time she visits a new country, she gets to scratch it off to reveal the colorful geography underneath.
*   **A Portable Power Bank:** A lifesaver for anyone who travels. An Anker or Mophie power bank ensures her phone is always charged, whether she's navigating a new city or capturing photos on a hike.
*   **A Gift Certificate for an Experience:** This is where you can get really creative. Think tickets to a concert, a weekend getaway booking, a hot air balloon ride, or a National Parks pass.
*   **A Durable and Stylish Travel Backpack:** For the woman who loves to explore, a well-designed backpack from brands like Cotopaxi or Dagne Dover is both functional and fashionable.

[old Italian espresso machine],"Hi, I hope I ask this the right way and I’m sorry if jt was already answered elsewhere I couldn’t find anything.

i’ve had this old Italian coffee machine for years, belonged to my parents from when they were younger, and I used it a bit a few years ago and all was good. i then moved in another country and for some reason it stopped working correctly, like it can sit on my hot plate for 30 minutes, make the cute bloop bloop noises, but will only give a third of a cup of coffee.. the rubber seal was changed, but it didn’t help.

i tried to use it again now that I‘m back home - watching Jarmush’s coffee and cigarettes made me thirsty for good coffee - but the problem remains.

would you fine folks have an idea what might be happening? could it be like limescale inside the thing complicating the process?

I'm currently 25 years old and have worked in my current sector (marketing at a theatre) since feb '24. I started the day after i finished my bachelor degree so i was really lucky to have a job straight away.

I got a contract for a year when i started and it got extended this past february (so i'm in contract 'till february 2026). A month back an interesting job came by and i decided to go for it. After 2 good job interviews and a case i unfortunately didnt get the job (was between me and another guy with more experience in the field, shit happens). 

Because the first interview was announced very late (2 days in advance) I had to let my manager know why i needed a day off on such short notice and i showed my hand and told her I was invited for a job interview for a new job that i was excited about. She reacted very calmly and even told me she was glad i felt the space to be open about it. I eventually let her know i didnt get the job and she didnt react to it that much. 2 weeks later she casually asked me to join her for a coffee over which she tells me they've decided not to extend my contract in february because they feel my priorities have switched away from the company. Ill be upfront and say I never thought i was going to retire here, im an active musician and if a job in the music field opens up i'd like to go for it but i have always been transparant about that and in my eyes i've never failed to fill my requirements and expectations. 

  
Im in contract till february and want to do what i can for this company untill then, but on the other hand i feel my involvement lessen by the day and that kinda kills my motivation. 

  
I'm wondering if anyone has any tips for these upcoming months? Thanks in advance!",1,1762428564.0,careerguidance,0,1.0,False

This little dispenser can take around 400 grams of grounds and drop them in the basket of the pot with minimal spillage. A
It’s got a half dome structure actioned with a lever so that one can open it and close it when it’s right on the basket.
It’s cons is that one has to put a whole bag of grounds in the dispenser thus affecting the freshness but for the use I do of coffee (in milk with cereal) freshness related flavor variances are irrelevant.

1opwg69,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1opwg69,WAN2.2 Lora Character Training Best practices,"I just moved from Flux to Wan2.2 for LoRA training after hearing good things about its likeness and flexibility. I’ve mainly been using it for text-to-image so far, but the results still aren’t quite on par with what I was getting from Flux. Hoping to get some feedback or tips from folks who’ve trained with Wan2.2.

**Questions:**

* It seems like the *high* model captures composition almost 1:1 from the training data, but the *low* model performs much worse — maybe \~80% likeness on close-ups and only 20–30% likeness on full-body shots. → Should I increase training steps for the low model? What’s the optimal step count for you guys?
* I trained using AI Toolkit with **5000 steps on 50 samples**. Does that mean it splits roughly **2500 steps per model** (high/low)? If so, I feel like **50 epochs** might be on the low end — thoughts?
* My dataset is **768×768**, but I usually generate at **1024×768**. I barely notice any quality loss, but would it be better to train directly at **1024×768 or 1024×1024** for improved consistency?

UPDATE: pic added in comments. He’s so cute I just want him to snuggle with me and my morning coffee!

Hello everyone! My family will adopt “Sheldon” on 12/2. We are VERY excited but we’ve only been big dog owners. I have 3 kids, 12, 12, and 9. They’re great with pets (my hubby is a vet so they go to the clinic often to play with boarding animals)

Just a little background: 

We’ve had 2 Rhodesians and a chocolate lab, all of them adopted as puppies. I totally feel confident in my big dog handling skills, but this tiny dog universe is new to me. 

What items did you need for your cavalier puppy? 

We already have an outside play pen, inside play pen with mat, a crate, 2 dog beds (one for crate, one for playpen), 4 dog bowls, puppy pee pads to help prevent accidents. 

I know I need to get a gate for my stairs and for rooms that he’ll be allowed to play in. (Favorite gate brands? How tall?)

I’d love some recommendations on must have puppy items. 

Specifically, a doggy seat belt for car rides? Sheldon will be my car buddy while I pick up the kids and run errands. 

Favorite brush for puppies?

Favorite toys? Teething toys? (My big boys and girl love the massive nylabones, but wasn’t sure how aggressive of chewers cavaliers are). My big boys could never have squeaky or soft toys. They would destroy them in seconds 🤣

Favorite harness? I am terrified he’ll try to slip out and run away when I take him on walks

What do you use when you take your cav to stores? Is there something you put in the cart or do you just keep them in a bag. 

Favorite purse puppy carrier?

I know many of these items are personal preference but I feel so out of water getting a tiny dog. My big dogs needed things to help them not learn to pull on a leash, so harnesses were out of the question. 

Do you put a bell on your puppy? I can hear my big dogs coming from a mile away. I don’t want to step on him or hurt him by accident. 

Basically anything you used or were happy you had when you were training/raising your puppy. 

Do cavaliers do well with clicker training? I don’t want to overfeed him with treats. 

TLDR: Help! I’m getting a tiny puppy and I’ve only had puppies that come home weighing 20lbs! What do I need to keep this little guy safe and healthy when he comes home.

I messaged him. No reply. On my break I went on snapchat and there he is on a video, running through the streets 100 mile away, with his daughters mum. The video was playing music and he shouts ' Come on Shannon get your fanny out.' I deleted snap. I told him never to contact me again. 
But he did of course. 
It took a while for the truth to come out but it did. 
Once he had used Shannon he headed over to his hometown where he bought coke and headed with friends to the lake. If I had not deleted snap chat, i'd have seen what he was up to. 
He had crashed out at a friends, who then took his bank card and robbed every penny.

Bit of a background. 23, I make 105k per year, but don't have a lot of expenses. I'd say ballpark at around 1k\~1.5k max per month, mainly on eating out, shopping, coffee, gym membership... etc. No gas, barely any groceries. Also usually spend an additional 5k per year on international trips. I am 100% confident I'm able to pay off the balance every month, and the only debt I have is student loans.

Main and probably only purpose for getting a credit card would be for flight points.

Bit of a background. 23, I make 105k per year, but don't have a lot of expenses. I'd say ballpark at around 1k\~1.5k max per month, mainly on eating out, shopping, coffee... etc. No gas, barely any groceries. Also usually spend an additional 5k per year on international trips. I am 100% confident I'm able to pay off the balance every month, and the only debt I have is student loans. 

Main and probably only purpose for getting a credit card would be for flight points. I don't fly with a specific airline (mainly Star Alliance if I do, but flexible) so I am not 100% sure if I want to be locked into a certain airline point. I also don't want to pay too much on annual fee... max 200?

Not because they were bad. Because my AI avatars started outperforming them by 300%.

Let me explain what's happening here before everyone else catches on.

https://reddit.com/link/1opw31v/video/u4bma30qcmzf1/player

**The Discovery That Changed Everything**

I was spending $30K/month on UGC creators. You know the drill. Find creators on Billo, brief them, wait two weeks, get shit videos back, ask for revisions, they ghost you, start over.

Meanwhile I'm testing this AI tool called MakeUGC at 2 AM because I can't sleep and I'm bored.

I clone my face. Write a script. Generate a video. The avatar looks 98% real. The lip sync is perfect. The hand gestures feel natural.

But here's the fucked up part - I accidentally left the export running and it generated 47 variations while I slept. Different backgrounds. Different gestures. Different emotional tones. Same script.

I tested all 47 against my human UGC. The AI won. On every metric.

**Why This Shouldn't Work (But Does)**

Consumers claim they hate AI. They want ""authentic"" content. Real humans. Real stories.

Bullshit.

They want content that feels real. There's a difference.

My AI avatars aren't trying to be perfect. I programmed them to stutter occasionally. To look away from the camera like they're thinking. To have slightly asymmetric facial expressions. They're more human than humans trying to act human.

Real UGC creators sound scripted because they ARE scripted. They're reading your brief word-for-word trying not to fuck up. AI avatars sound natural because they're programmed to include the imperfections that make speech feel spontaneous.

**The Production System**

Here's what my setup looks like now.

Seven AI agents running in parallel. Each has a specific job in the content pipeline.

Agent 1 scrapes Reddit for actual customer language about my product category. Not reviews. Reddit. Where people actually complain about shit.

Agent 2 turns those complaints into hooks. ""I can't believe nobody talks about how..."" followed by the exact problem they described.

Agent 3 generates 20 script variations for each hook. Different angles. Different emotional triggers. Different call-to-actions.

Agent 4 feeds scripts into MakeUGC. Randomizes the avatar (I have 23 different faces now). Randomizes the background. Randomizes the energy level.

Agent 5 adds the product shots. Not fake ones. Real ones. But timed perfectly to appear right when the avatar mentions the transformation.

Agent 6 uploads everything to TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook. Different accounts. Different times. Tests everything.

Agent 7 monitors performance and kills losers after $10 spend.

This runs 24/7. I wake up to 550 new videos and performance data on yesterday's batch.

**The Economics Are Broken**

My old system: $200 per UGC video. Two-week turnaround. 50% need reshoots. Maybe 1 in 10 becomes a winner.

New system: $0.03 per video in API costs. 3-minute turnaround. Infinite variations. 1 in 20 becomes a winner.

I'm testing more creative in a day than most brands test in a year. Not because I'm smart. Because the marginal cost is basically zero.

When something hits, I can generate 100 variations of that exact winner in different styles. Different faces saying the same proven script. Different backgrounds for different demographics. Different energy levels for different times of day.

**The Uncanny Valley Is Dead**

Everyone said AI avatars would fail because of the uncanny valley. That subtle creepiness when something is almost-but-not-quite human.

That was true six months ago. It's not true now.

MakeUGC V2 fixed the micro-expressions. The weight of the blinking. The way shoulders move when someone talks. The tiny head tilts that signal engagement.

But more importantly, they understood that perfection is the enemy. Real humans don't maintain perfect eye contact. They don't speak in perfect cadence. They don't smile symmetrically.

My most successful AI avatar has a slight lazy eye and occasionally scratches her nose. She's converted $2.3M in sales.

**What This Means For Marketing**

Every agency telling you to ""invest in authentic creator partnerships"" is about to be unemployed.

Why would I pay an influencer $5,000 for one post when I can generate their exact style of content infinitely? Why would I wait for human creators when AI can test 1,000 variations by tomorrow morning?

The moat isn't creativity anymore. It's velocity.

Whoever can test the most content the fastest wins. And humans can't compete with machines on velocity.

**The Ethical Mindfu'ck**

Here's what keeps me up at night.

These avatars aren't real people. But they're based on real people. The AI learned from millions of hours of human content. It's essentially the averaged-out version of every UGC creator who ever existed.

When someone watches my ad and feels connected to the ""person"" talking, who are they connecting with? A mathematical model? The collective unconscious of TikTok? Nobody?

I don't have answers. I just know it's converting at 4.7%.

**How To Start Tomorrow**

Forget the complex setup. Start simple.

Go to MakeUGC. Upload your face or use their stock avatars. Write one script based on your biggest customer complaint. Generate 10 variations. Test them all with $10 budgets.

You'll have your first winner within 24 hours.

Then scale. Add more avatars. More scripts. More variations. Build your own AI content army.

The tools are accessible now. MakeUGC for the avatars. Claude for the scripts. Zapier to connect everything. Accounts are free to start.

**The Window Is Closing**

Six months ago, only enterprise companies could do this. Three months ago, you needed technical knowledge. Today, my 14-year-old nephew could set this up.

In another six months, everyone will be doing it. The platforms will be saturated with AI content. Consumers will adapt. CPMs will rise.

But right now? Right now you can generate 550 videos a day while your competitors are waiting for one creator to respond to their email.

**The Future Is Already Here**

Last week I had coffee with a CMO who spent $400K on a brand campaign. Professional actors. Director. Full production crew. Six months from concept to launch.

I showed him my phone. Scrolled through my generated videos from that morning. His face went white.

""How long did these take?""

""They were generated while we've been sitting here.""

He quit his job yesterday. Started his own AI marketing company today. ***Just Kidding.***

**IF YOU....**

Want the complete workflow? The seven agents, the prompt templates, the testing framework? Comment down and I'll D'M you everything.

Warning: Once you see how easy this is, you'll never pay for UGC again. Your whole perspective on content creation will shatter.

Started the day around 4AM. Earlier than usual for me, I was feeling spry and wanted to get after it and create a day full of rest and no dash. Order 1. Starbucks. Less than par pay, we hustle. It’s 4. Get a free small coffee out of it. Excellent. Great start. 

Order two: Burger King. No problems, this particular BK has night shift that’s always rude as hell, but that’s fine. I don’t need a “you’re welcome” as long as my thank you means all the items are in the bag. Subpar pay, again, no free coffee. But we still hustle. It’s 4:30.  

Next, Starbucks, again.  Double order. First order (landed about 6am), good pay and smooth. Next order is at the USAFA gate. Yea, revealing, I know, that’s alright. Who cares. Not gonna get myself or anyone else in trouble. Pull up to the gate. Cadet or whoever (excuse my ignorance, ex-mil dashers), asks for my ID and my business on base. I say “ I really don’t need on base. I was told to deliver X order here, at the gate for Y name. Lifelong resident. Went to school on base. (Air academy highschool), gave my ID over.  Well, guess what. My car and I got searched. Because the asshat officer didn’t tell anyone to expect their coffee, they didn’t know who it was going to or why they weren’t at the gate. They wanted to examine me before letting me flip a U-turn, I guess. It’s fine. I’m clean, sober, and hopped up at 6am. Order value sucked for the trouble, but whatever. 

Anyway, lil officer EVENTUALLY shows up, halfway through my shakedown, grabs the order and doesn’t really say much. Gate cadets apologize, let me know said officer is already in trouble (yeah, no, not mil myself but have a pass for Peterson via my DoD father (golf purposes before they nuked it). They were so not in trouble. Don’t know who they were but it slid. (I know the name, don’t need to crucify and they did later apologize, tip would’ve been nice but again, whatever). Anyway, $5 for a shakedown and 1 hour of my time, hoping some roach from 4y ago wasn’t gonna show up. Sweating already.  

But, be that as much as one can normally handle for a day, it only gets better and juicier. 7, or so, get an order for a smoothie place owned by the wife of my old boss who I had a somewhat not amicable parting from a while back. Know his wife well. Wonderful woman, great smoothie joint, but oh so awkward to have run-ins with. To add, she was a client of my mother’s old business in title. Yeah. It gets deep. Anyway. She’s there at the ass crack of dawn. Explain, why I’m there and pick up the order and give my due well wishes. Proceed to drop all three smoothies in the parking lot and have to ask her personally to remake them. Yup. Pride hurts.  Shit sucks. Time to fold it in? No. We’re cruising for a bruising today lads. 

Fill the order.  Again, not great pay, especially with my shame and regret.  Now. About 7:45, we’re on to Starbucks order number two. Guess what. Lid pops and soaks the bag. Literally, don’t know why we’re putting one tall drink in a bag, but whatever.  Swallow my pride, YET AGAIN and get that ish remade. Customer is already asking what is the hold up. Explain what happened. She seems okay. Confirm pickup. Excellent directions (foreshadowing) or so I thought. I thank her for her detail and give my ETA. 

Now. Pulling up to a well known military contractor, who I have interned with as a mechanical engineering student on a different campus, I realize the pin is so far off from her directive it’s not even funny. The address isn’t wrong, nor are her instructions. This is on map quest (yes, Ive tried the alt maps, just doesn’t work as smooth for me in general). 

ANYWAY, takes me maybe an extra 2 minutes to get oriented. This woman, in the span of my approach of about five minutes, asks me if I’m lost six times. Six. I told her “Nah, I’m closing in.  See you shortly, I can see my target and I will execute!”  

Witty and mil-contracted based humor, no? It is for an aero-weapons company, that’s for sure.  Little to no time delay for her coffee, either. Like I said, her failed pin delayed me less than five minutes. Guess what I get as a response. A “wow.”  

I hand the order off, and say “here you go, I didn’t mean to seem rude.  I’m sorry.” And this bih goes “ugh now it’s all cold, I thought you said my instructions were good?”  I explain that the map put me close, but in the wrong lot. Thanks to her instruction, I got it to her instead of at a different suite no. ASAP. It’s a large complex, so I took the short hike instead of the long drive and finding a second spot. SHE TURNS HEEL in the middle of my explanation, wants to lecture me on being rude. Yeah. Right. Send a long apology, no response. Explain my relationship to her company. No response. Mistake on my end, who knows what that shit will end up causing. Probably invalidated my entire internship over this a-holes coffee. Whatever. 

You think my day is over? Well, the mind bending future fuckening has more for me. Next, I get a boba tea order for my ex. Passcode. Go figure. It’s amicable. Awkward, but amicable. Take this as my sign it time to quit.  It’s barely ten AM and I’ve had the WORST possible morning possible. Go have lunch with my girl, take a shower, get some groceries, and decide, well, perhaps the air is clear. 

Now, for the most part it is. The absolute, mind bending screw fest is over. Customer issues are over. But I’m still getting screwed. Trust. Fill about five sub par pay orders. Money is money, it’s all I’m getting today. And then, about 11pm, the subway saga begins. The sandwich joint. You know where I live by now, no subway train here. Anywho, these guys are out of meatballs. And cookies. And salami and pepperoni. Big day, I guess, or their truck is behind. Whatever, it happens. Anyway, call my customer. I’ve about had it for the day, not waiting on a text substitute that may or may not get fulfilled. The (very kind) customer answers, and goes “really, again?” All I can say is “yeah, well, I guess.  Fill me in, where you at?” Dude goes “You’re dasher number 3. If I cancel on my end, I don’t get refunded. I wanted my meatballs, man! I know this isn’t your fault, but can you try to get this resolved so I can just enjoy my night?” I explain how useless support is but that I’ll do my best to get them to stop trying to push the order. He thanks me, and we move on.  

I call support. I stress, hard, that they need to end this guys order and get him taken care of. I even say, “I’d like my half pay, but really I’m just trying to get this over with.”  This is phone support. I’m platinum. Got them on the horn fast. Get my half pay, but while waiting two things happen. One. Some creepy-ass-stanky dasher walks in, and starts conversation with the low 20’s sub slinger while she’s making his customers order.  Basically offers her roofie water. Upfront. Like, guess that’s better than in a non-consenting matter, but it’s oh so creepy. I speak up a lil. Not much, not trying to knight myself here, just sort of question the guy a little.  Like “damn dude, what’s in there, sounds crazy?” “Couldn’t imagine doing that while dashing!” Blah blah blah. Doesn’t go anywhere. Ads to the creep. Anyway, dude is walking out and says he’ll be there at close. I truley believe the guy is just odd with a small substance abuse issue, just looking to vibe. Not that he was trying to take advantage of this young woman. She says she is going to call her boyfriend, and I sit while I wait for my next order. Yet another dasher walks in, and guess what? It’s for the meatball lad. I tell him to skip calling him, again, leave him alone and call support. Sub-slinger corroborated. Don’t know if he’s new or socially wired a different way, but two seconds later he’s calling this poor guy again. Whatever.  I send the guy a message and just tell him I did what I could but I can see what’s happening, better off going DnD and waiting until tomorrow for a refund. But the other dasher, he ends the calls the same way I did, with empty lies and customer sorrow and confusion. As this proceeds, I get another order. It’s subway. Again. Sub slingers boyfriend is coming, she’s gonna be fine. This next order is fulfillable. Collect. Deliver. Done. Non creep, doesn’t listen dasher is out of the picture already.  

Next order. Guess what. Subway. Meatball guy. Again, but this time literally no name is on the order. Not a single letter. Arrive at store (half pay is half pay) and call support again. This time, the support asks to talk to her ON MY PHONE. Never, ever had this happen. Ever. Anyway. She does. The shop closes early (can’t be there at close if they close early, right?) and I’m on my way.  

And done. So utterly effing done. And now I’m still reeling from whatever the hell today was. If you think this is BS - enjoy the story. But I assure you I didn’t even have to dramatize a single detail. I made $50 today. At the expense of my sanity. I think I’m gonna take some time off, the DD gods just told me to.

1opw0gj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1opw0gj/is_this_a_normal_phase_for_couples_or_not/,Is this a normal phase for couples or not? (Question for people with kids),"I am wondering if anyone else is going through this currently. I have been married to my husband for 4 years now and we have two beautiful healthy and happy kids. 

They’re both two under two (one of which is a newborn). So we are in the phase of just being roommates. I understand this part is normal for couples bc you’re both on survival mode but it’s been taken to another level for my husband and I. 
Firstly, when we go out or when he’s home his time spent is typically on the tv or on his phone playing his games. I have had many conversations about it and asked for one on one time but it just seems to be a repetitive conversation. He even goes on his phone to play his games if we’re having family time and go out. It gets me frustrated because the way I show love is one on one time with each other. 

We have been really financially struggling after our second so we haven’t gone out on a date since my first was born 2 years ago nor do we have the money or really anyone to watch the kids. There is no more romantic gestures either. I have to do all of the scheduling for us going out to the park or any ideas of spending time together. Plus we haven’t been intimate for 3 months.

So normally I’m just happy if we even go for a walk together with the kids and I. Not to mention I get zero alone time from the kids when he’s off of work I have to beg him or take one of them with me. I’ve been also trying to go to the gym to lose my baby weight and he was great about giving me an hour on the days he’s off in the beginnings for about a week… now it’s like a bargaining game with him when I do want an hour on the days he’s off. 

When he gets home from work he’s typically exhausted which I understand bc he works a lot but I get turned down when I ask him to do simple things, go for a walk with the kids and I. 

It’s honestly becoming extremely hard for me. It feels like at this point I’m just wanting crumbs from a man who shows no interest in me. When he goes to work he used to give me a kiss before leaving now he only gives the kids a kiss and heads out. This morning I woke up early (after being up all night with the kids) packed his bag for work, made his coffee, set out his clothes and woke him up. I get met with an angry overtired husband. 
I tried to wake him up several times this morning until finally he got upset with me and swore at me. I’m getting run down and exhausted and I’m feeling so helpless. 
I remembered it kinda being like this with my first but not as nearly as bad.

1opvwej,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1opvwej/bumped_into_her_two_weeks_after_the_breakup/,Bumped into her two weeks after the breakup,"
I (25M) recently broke up with my Ex (24F) little over two weeks ago and bumped into her today.

To give a short synopsis the breakup was initiated on my behalf after we dated for two years. Things were mostly good at the start but prior to me asking her out there was few red flags where instances she tried to make me jealous in front of other guys and also her displaying a short temper. This short temper and her reactions being disproportionate to the situation increased the months after we became official and became somewhat unbearable that I decided to breakup. She then said she would change and go to therapy and did a few sessions. I found myself sucked back in and we went back to dating over the course of last summer. This time I did notice a shift where she would be more communicative and more controlling of her temper and her mood shifted less. I guess I didn’t feel like I was walking on eggshells anymore. However I was concerned when she told me that she had stopped seeing her therapist after 5 sessions. I then started wonder did she really want genuine change. Then the last few months she became a little bit more clingy than usual (which is fine) but more so to a controlling point. I would be accused of cheating for going to the gym with a friend or she would begin crying if I met a friend for coffee. I felt this linked more to control. This eventually spiralled a bit into her one night ringing my phone over 10 times when I said the electrician was coming to my house. I gave her the time I’d be done and said I would pick her up but she began walking towards my house and said she had been attacked after I rang her back following 10 missed calls and 15 texts. The texts were things like “ do you care” , “are you cheating”. I comforted her after and things went back to normal the next day but I wasn’t gonna question the validity of her story. A few days later I ended the relationship as It didn’t feel right anymore and I didn’t feel like I could live a normal life and be worried about making someone else upset when I’m doing basic activities and also it’s not good for them.

Anyway, yesterday I was clothes shopping in the city and ran into her very suddenly. We ended on good terms so I expected her to stop and talk but she didn’t and kept walking. She did say hello and I returned a hello back. I thought I was more over the relationship than I thought but my heart dropped with nerves however I don’t know if this is the remaining emotional ties or just the situation. I thought after about why she didn’t stop to talk but then thought she did look like she was in a rush or trying to make a train. Even her not stopping probably was better in hindsight as even small talk would have been hurtful. I will say it was such a weird feeling just saying hello to someone two weeks ago that you were building your future with. Now they are just a stranger. I found it hard to focus for the rest of evening and also annoyed and feel vulnerable because I thought I was more over her. She sent me a short text after to say I looked good and I followed back to say it was nice to see her as I didn’t want to build any dialog as we have established No contact albeit for necessary situations like if we come across old items that belong to one another other. 

Today, the interaction is still upsetting me. I felt off at work and sad. I know this relationship is bad for me hence why I’m staying away and broke up but the interaction made me feel vulnerable and that if she really wanted me back and applied the pressure then I could cave. I have worked really hard journaling and reflecting the last few weeks and working out as well as being intentful In doing things that help me recover from the stress of the relationship. 

Sorry for the long post, I just feel like it was 2 steps forward and 1 step back. Any advice is welcome and I’d like to hear if others have experienced the same situation..",1,1762426662.0,Advice,2,1.0,False
1opvtw6,https://www.reddit.com/r/PeriodontalDisease/comments/1opvtw6/feeling_hopeless_and_ashamed/,Feeling hopeless and ashamed.,"Hi everyone, this post is more of a rant than anything. I hope that's okay. Looking for any advice or support you can give.

I'm feeling a lot of despair at the moment. Two years I had no real problems with my teeth or gums, but in the space of two years I developed root resorption on two teeth (where the body breaks down it's own healthy tissue/root), and thin gums, quite a lot of recession especially on the bottom front teeth.

I've had gut issues for about 10 years now which has undoubtedly played a part in this. I've been working on this, this all seemed to develop when I was in a very stressful job too. I was constantly anxious, stressed and throwing back coffee all day to get through it. This obviously hasn't helped things.

This year I really upped my cleaning game, see the periodontist every few months, cleanings every months or so. I use floss, interdental brushes, water jet, disclosing tablets etc. I've done blood tests, taken private stool and gut tests and seen where I'm deficient and tried to help this with supplements and nutrition. 

But it still seems to be getting worse and my gums hurt most of the time. My top teeth are pretty much okay, but the bottom are always inflamed. I'm 29 and feel like my life is over and never coming back.

I'm having a gum graft on 5 teeth at the front in the next couple of months to thicken up the tissue, but I just feel like it won't do much. The pockets don't seem too bad but there is a fair amount of recession at the front. I use to have lovely teeth and now just feel gross and disgusting, and like I'll lose them before I'm 32. No one would even notice unless i smiled wide and pulled back my lip. It's very depressing though knowing it's there, it's affected my self esteem a lot. Sorry for the downer, I'm having a bad one today.

I was set to have a grum graft in April 2025 but in the middle of it my Peridontist discovered root resorption on my canine when he pulled back the gum. So I had to wait until now, seeing tons of surgeons, endodonists and other 'professionals'. Being passed from person to person and then bascially getting an email saying no further action required. All the while my gums were getting worse.",1,1762426419.0,PeriodontalDisease,0,1.0,False

What finally cracked it wasn’t a routine or a book. it was **one small promise** i could actually keep. that’s it. not ten habits. not a full makeover. one thing i’d bet my name on.

My rule was dumb simple: pick something tiny, do it at the same time, don’t skip twice. i started with “one glass of water before i touch my phone.” stupidly small, but i did it. then “write one sentence for the project i’m avoiding.” not a chapter. **one sentence.** did that too.

No fireworks. no “new me” montage. just a quiet “yep, i did what i said.” and that’s when it clicked: confidence isn’t a mood, it’s **self-trust**. every kept promise is a receipt your brain can’t argue with.

a few ideas if you want to try:

* two minutes of stretching after you brush your teeth
* five pushup before your morning coffee
* tidy **one** surface, not the whole room

if you miss a day, don’t make a speech about it. just don’t miss two. pick it up tomorrow. same promise. same time. keep stacking quiet wins.

That’s been the shift for me. less believe in yourself, more “give yourself proof.”

This is how confidence is built.

Think Pondicherry, and images of French villas, coastal cafés, and sunset walks might make you believe it’s a luxury destination. But here’s the truth — Pondy can be wonderfully affordable if you know where to look.

With its compact size, walkable lanes, and local-first culture, you can explore the **best of Pondicherry** without breaking the bank. Whether you’re a **student**, a **solo traveler**, or someone looking for a minimalist coastal escape, here’s exactly how to spend a full day in Pondicherry — all within **₹1000**.



**Content**

1. Budget Breakfast – Start the Day Local  
2. Free Morning Experiences – Beaches & Heritage  
3. Lunch on a Budget – Authentic, Filling, Delicious  
4. Afternoon Chill – Museums, Art & Coffee  
5. Sunset Evenings – Low-Cost Magic  
6. Budget Dinner – End the Day Deliciously  
7. Final Breakdown – The ₹1000 Day  



**1. Budget Breakfast – Start the Day Local**

**Hot Breads (title)**  
 **Affordable Indo-French bakery & café in Ambur Salai, White Town.**

Kickstart your morning at **Hot Breads**, where a flaky croissant and steaming cappuccino will cost barely ₹150.  
 If you prefer South Indian flavors, stop by **Surguru Veg Restaurant** near Mission Street for an **idli-vada combo with filter coffee** under ₹100.

Eat early and then walk towards **Promenade Beach** — the morning light and sea breeze make for the perfect wake-up.

💸 *Breakfast Budget:* ₹100–₹150



**2. Free Morning Experiences – Beaches & Heritage**

**Pondicherry’s biggest charm is that its best attractions are free.**

Walk along **Rock Beach**, watch locals jogging by, and stop at the **Mahatma Gandhi statue**. Then, wander into **White Town**, where pastel-painted French houses and Tamil courtyards tell stories of two worlds.

**Don’t Miss:**

* The **Notre Dame des Anges Church** (free entry)  
* **INTACH Heritage Walk** route  
* Local **street murals along Rue Dumas**  

💸 *Cost:* ₹0



**3. Lunch on a Budget – Authentic, Filling, Delicious**

**Kamatchi Mess (title)**  
**Traditional Tamil restaurant serving wholesome non-veg meals.**

For under ₹200, you can enjoy a full **Tamil lunch meal** — rice, sambar, rasam, poriyal, and a side of spicy chicken curry.  
 If you’re vegetarian, go for the **Mini Meals** option.

Another great alternative is **Bharathi Mess** in the Tamil Quarter — known for generous portions, quick service, and home-style flavor.

💸 *Lunch Budget:* ₹150–₹200



**4. Afternoon Chill – Museums, Art & Coffee**

**Pondicherry Museum & Café des Arts (title)**  
**Best afternoon spots in Pondicherry for art, history, and coffee breaks.**

When the sun hits hard, step into the cool quiet of **Pondicherry Museum** (entry ₹20) — a small yet fascinating collection of colonial artifacts, coins, and sculptures.

After that, grab an iced coffee at **Baker Street Café** or **Café des Arts** (₹150–₹180) and relax in their breezy courtyards. Most cafés let you sit for hours — perfect if you’re carrying a book or sketchpad.

💸 *Afternoon Budget:* ₹200



**5. Sunset Evenings – Low-Cost Magic**

**Rock Beach Food Court (title)**  
 **Affordable Seaside Food Court Behind Promenade Hotel Pondicherry.**

As the sun begins to set, head toward the **Rock Beach Food Court**, located just **behind the Promenade Hotel** — one of Pondicherry’s most loved sunset spots.

This ocean-facing stretch gives you the best of both worlds: **a golden seaside view** and **local street food stalls** serving everything from **bhel puri** and **grilled corn** to **seafood fritters** and **kulfi**.

Sitting on the stone benches with a plate of spicy **pani puri** and the sound of waves crashing nearby, it feels like **peak Pondy magic** — simple, flavorful, and free of crowds.

**Why Visit:**

* Located **behind the Promenade Hotel**, right next to Rock Beach.  
* Watch the **sunset over the Bay of Bengal** while enjoying budget snacks.  
* Great spot for **evening photography** and people-watching.  

**What to Try:**

* **Momos, fried prawns, chaat, and fresh juices**.  
* **Filter coffee** or a **lemon soda** as the lights flicker on.  

💸 *Evening Budget:* ₹150–₹200



**6. Budget Dinner – End the Day Deliciously**

**Subbiah Salai Food Street (title)**  
**Bustling local hub for Pondicherry’s best street food.**

Dinner is where Pondy truly wins the heart — especially on a budget. From **kothu parotta** to **shawarmas**, you’ll find hot plates sizzling across **Subbiah Salai**.

A full meal here costs less than ₹200, and if you’re adventurous, try the **seafood stalls** closer to the corner. End the night with a **kulfi or filter coffee (₹50)** before heading back to your stay.

💸 *Dinner Budget:* ₹200



**7. Final Breakdown – The ₹1000 Day**

||
||
|**Activity**|**Cost (Approx.)**|
|Breakfast|₹150|
|Sightseeing (morning)|Free|
|Lunch|₹200|
|Museum + Coffee|₹200|
|Evening Beach + Snack|₹150|
|Dinner|₹200|
|**Total**|**₹900**|

You’ve still got ₹100 left — enough for a small **souvenir from Mission Street** or a **rickshaw ride** back to your hotel.



**Conclusion: The Art of Slow, Smart Travel**

Exploring Pondicherry doesn’t require a big wallet — just a curious heart.  
With a little planning and a sense of adventure, **₹1000 a day** can give you **beaches, cafés, culture, and calm** — all wrapped in the golden glow of the coast.

So pack light, rent that scooter, and let the waves guide your day.  
In Pondicherry, **simplicity isn’t a compromise — it’s the whole experience.** ",1,1762426204.0,explorepondy,0,1.0,False

Your choice is between Flambae and Malevola. Choosing Flambae makes his ego goes to his head and everyone slightly dislikes you because now he won't shut up, choosing Malevola will result in Flambae disliking you a lot but everyone else is cool with that.

1opvqlq,https://www.reddit.com/r/heartbreak/comments/1opvqlq/bumped_into_her_two_weeks_after_breakup/,Bumped into her two weeks after breakup,"
I (25M) recently broke up with my Ex (24F) little over two weeks ago and bumped into her today.

To give a short synopsis the breakup was initiated on my behalf after we dated for two years. Things were mostly good at the start but prior to me asking her out there was few red flags where instances she tried to make me jealous in front of other guys and also her displaying a short temper. This short temper and her reactions being disproportionate to the situation increased the months after we became official and became somewhat unbearable that I decided to breakup. She then said she would change and go to therapy and did a few sessions. I found myself sucked back in and we went back to dating over the course of last summer. This time I did notice a shift where she would be more communicative and more controlling of her temper and her mood shifted less. I guess I didn’t feel like I was walking on eggshells anymore. However I was concerned when she told me that she had stopped seeing her therapist after 5 sessions. I then started wonder did she really want genuine change. Then the last few months she became a little bit more clingy than usual (which is fine) but more so to a controlling point. I would be accused of cheating for going to the gym with a friend or she would begin crying if I met a friend for coffee. I felt this linked more to control. This eventually spiralled a bit into her one night ringing my phone over 10 times when I said the electrician was coming to my house. I gave her the time I’d be done and said I would pick her up but she began walking towards my house and said she had been attacked after I rang her back following 10 missed calls and 15 texts. The texts were things like “ do you care” , “are you cheating”. I comforted her after and things went back to normal the next day but I wasn’t gonna question the validity of her story. A few days later I ended the relationship as It didn’t feel right anymore and I didn’t feel like I could live a normal life and be worried about making someone else upset when I’m doing basic activities and also it’s not good for them.

Anyway, yesterday I was clothes shopping in the city and ran into her very suddenly. We ended on good terms so I expected her to stop and talk but she didn’t and kept walking. She did say hello and I returned a hello back. I thought I was more over the relationship than I thought but my heart dropped with nerves however I don’t know if this is the remaining emotional ties or just the situation. I thought after about why she didn’t stop to talk but then thought she did look like she was in a rush or trying to make a train. Even her not stopping probably was better in hindsight as even small talk would have been hurtful. I will say it was such a weird feeling just saying hello to someone two weeks ago that you were building your future with. Now they are just a stranger. I found it hard to focus for the rest of evening and also annoyed and feel vulnerable because I thought I was more over her. She sent me a short text after to say I looked good and I followed back to say it was nice to see her as I didn’t want to build any dialog as we have established No contact albeit for necessary situations like if we come across old items that belong to one another other. 

Today, the interaction is still upsetting me. I felt off at work and sad. I know this relationship is bad for me hence why I’m staying away and broke up but the interaction made me feel vulnerable and that if she really wanted me back and applied the pressure then I could cave. I have worked really hard journaling and reflecting the last few weeks and working out as well as being intentful In doing things that help me recover from the stress of the relationship. 

Sorry for the long post, I just feel like it was 2 steps forward and 1 step back. Any advice is welcome and I’d like to hear if others have experienced the same situation..",1,1762426098.0,heartbreak,0,1.0,False

I run a small neighborhood coffee shop near a college and we’ve done some classic Black Friday promo thing before (discounted drinks and food for the day) but it usually means we're busy busy for a day, then nothing I’m trying to find a way to make that energy last a bit longer this year.

One idea I’m playing with is turning Black Friday into a full week with a stamp card. Each visit that week would earn a stamp, and after five stamps, customers would get a limited themed mug and a free drink. The thought is that it might spread sales into slower weeks and give regulars something fun to work toward.

Yeah, Tbilisi is famous for its stray cats having sunbathes in roofs and fences, also people here love the dogs and pet them well. BUT if you want to have a cup of coffee or dinner in calm and really dog-friendly place, you have know in advance where to go.

So, the first café we visited with my 9-year old aussie is Gabriadze Cafe. It's located in the Old Town (nice pedestrain Shavteli street), it has enough space, and it's simply made for relaxing. You may not have breakfast here, 'cause this guys are opened from noon to 11pm, but lunch, dinner, or just a cap of good coffee is perfect here. The place is a part of Rezo Gabriadze's legacy, it's a continuation of the eponymous theatre - here, in the same building. So the interior is very nice in artistic way. And you may notice a special miniature door at the entrance - and yes, it's for particular dog, little Pomeranian, belonging to Tabidze restorators.

Another good choice is Chaduna - it's literally located in an old apartment on Tabidze street in Sololaki. Inside, there's no street noise or busy traffic. The cuisine and the atmosphere is a good mix of old heritage and contemporary attitude. Oh, and they also have few items for dogs (that's a rare thing, honestly).

200 metres away on Asatiani Street there's a legendary place - the first dog-friendly venue in Tbilisi - it's called Black Dog Bar. Classic craft beer bar with a solid selection of brews and the right kind of simple cuisine. Local stray dogs often come here to warm up and chill - they're absolutely friendly, they love being pet by visitors. But of your dog's more of an introvert, this might be not their scene. 

Ok, move on. There are two good places around Rustaveli Ave. The first one is Erti Kava, a cosy coffee shop opened from 8 am. They serve the cutest desserts here. The second one is the iconic Stamba Café belongin' to the eponymous hotel (built in the former printing house, fantastic interiors, wow). Here they have spacious green courtyard, which is perfect for hangin' out with pets. And yes, it's notably quiet here.

In Vake, there are also some places your fluffy friend will admire. Quiet cafes CHITI and Kikliko - they have good coffee, good cuisine, and they're completely suitable for pets. There's also the best playground for dogs in Vake Park, every four-legged tourist should see  🐾

Section 1: “The Compassion of the Lotus Sutra Combines Both Love and Sternness” (Part 3)

*First, a bit from “MY Fantasy Life” (cred: Eigenstien)*

*We invited representatives from the Town and District to come to Coffee Hour this morning to celebrate the passing of the Bond Initiative. Teacher Lolita has the children ready to perform some songs from South Pacific. I’ve come across them rehearsing a couple of times and know it will be a lot of fun for them and our guests. I’m sorry, we just can’t get very good bagels here but Dee is baking her Longhouse version of “bialys,” really acorn-walnut flour flatbread with some yeast. Add cream cheese, spreads, and bingo!*

*Watch out, World! Eulogio is in attack mode with his new responsibilities at work. He also had a conversation with a colleague about the Company financing a mortgage to pay for the construction of the Longhouse Secondary School. His colleague listened carefully and examined all of the documents  Eulogio had prepared in his package. She said she would present the proposal to her superiors.*

*This is what she came back with in Eulogio’s words: “The company is interested for several reasons. First, this proposal would enhance our portfolio of investments that are socially responsible. Secondly, the Company sees a long-term relationship with you as Senior Management. We are asking you to make a 10-year commitment to continue leading your current Division with us. As a perc and incentive, we will offer you a 10-year mortgage with a nominal 1% interest as long as you remain part of the Company. If you leave, it reverts to market rates.” Of course, Eulogio should consult with us before making a decision that impacts the family but that is simply not who Eulogio is. He accepted the offer immediately. He comes home on Saturday and has arranged to meet with our architect  and contractor next week to get things moving.*

Just a couple of passages today from Daisaku Ikeda’s lecture on *The Opening of the Eyes* in which he introduces the subject of shakubuku as “a method of expounding Buddhism by refuting another’s attachment to erroneous teachings.” This “constitutes the last major focus of *The Opening of the Eyes* and forms the basis for the Daishonin’s subsequent conclusion regarding [himself as] sovereign, teacher and parent.”

Then Dr. Ikeda pivots to the second section, “The Parable of the Poor Woman Revisited” in which he summarizes:

>To have unceasing faith in all people’s potential to attain enlightenment is itself true compassion. And shakubuku can be seen as the primary practical means for implementing or giving expression to this compassion. Put another way, the practice of shakubuku is indispensable to attaining Buddhahood.

I am really looking forward to reading Section 3, “Clarifying the True Spirit of Shakubuku.” But we have our planning meeting tomorrow night and it will be very special because at the discussion meeting it becomes official: “RV Park Group” becomes “RV Park District.” So, tomorrow I want to cover here the two study topics from which we will decide the theme of our meeting.

Dr. Ikeda's powerful discussion of shakubuku in Section 3 will wait until this weekend. TBH, we’ve been so busy and preoccupied with the Bond Issue that I haven't had the opportunity to plant any seeds about Buddhism recently and I am a bit out of practice.

1opvm70,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaRecovery/comments/1opvm70/refeeding_bloating_and_rapid_weight_gain_is_this/,Refeeding bloating and rapid weight gain — is this normal?,"Hi everyone.

First. I want to clarify that I was never diagnosed with anorexia, and I don’t think of myself as having a “classic eating disorder” at all. I didn’t restrict on purpose or try to become underweight. I just slowly got used to eating very little, and it became my normal without realizing it. So this whole refeeding reaction feels confusing because from the outside, nothing ever looked severe.


I’m not sure how to explain this clearly, but I’ll try.

For a long time I was eating very little without really realizing it. I wasn’t trying to lose weight and I didn’t think I had an eating disorder. I just got used to eating around ~1000 calories a day (a yogurt, a sandwich, coffee, etc.). It felt “normal” and nobody around me thought anything was wrong.

About 3 weeks ago I started trying to eat more  around 1300–1600 calories. I thought this was a small increase, but my body reacted really strongly. I’ve gained about 1.5–2 kg very quickly, and I wake up every morning extremely bloated, like my stomach is full of air or water. It even feels firm or hard sometimes, and honestly it’s uncomfortable and scary. I look like I’m several months pregnant when I wake up.

I also noticed I’m very constipated, and my hunger cues are all over the place. Some days I don’t feel hungry at all, and other days I feel exhausted and heavy after eating. My last period was also strangely painless (which never happens for me).

I keep worrying that this weight and bloating will stay forever, and that I “messed up” my metabolism by eating so little for so long. I feel embarrassed trying to explain this to others, because I’m not underweight and I don’t “look like” I have an eating disorder. But my body feels like it’s reacting to something real.

Does anyone have experience with this kind of refeeding bloating and water retention?
Did it eventually go down?
How long did it take for your digestion and weight to stabilize?

Any shared experiences or reassurance would mean a lot.

1opvm5y,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/comments/1opvm5y/am_i_crazyi_think_i_am_being_stalked/,Am I crazy…I think I am being stalked..,"Hi, I am sorry in advance this post might be a little long but I have provided a lot of context and want to mention every little thing I have noticed whether it may be related or not.

Context:

I (18F) moved from a small country town 10 months ago with my childhood friend of around 16 years, Sam (19F) for university. I am studying nursing and Sam is studying Law.

Sam and I were thinking about moving in together before we even left our home town but due to the cost of living in Australia, we decided it would be a better idea if we had a third roommate (a mutual family friend owns an apartment that was going to be vacant when we moved but it was 3 bedroom 3 bathroom and expensive for just 2 people). Sam has distance family living in our university city but I did not so it didn't leave us with many optinions for roommates. We used Facebook and put posters up around campus looking for a potential roommate.

This is when we met Zoe (20F). Zoe goes to the same university as Sam and I but is in her second year of her computer science degree. She used my phone number which was on the flyers posted around campus to contact me and say she was interested.

All three of us met up for coffee and she seemed extremely nice. She talked about how much fun we would have and just seemed very enthusiastic.

We decided that she was a good fit after sorting throughout some other applicants due to the fact she has a similar lifestyle to Sam and I (busy overworked uni students) and is around the same age as us.

Zoe moved in and it was great for the first couple of months. She was clean, kind and made an effort to talk to Sam and I, planning little roommate activities in our apartment when our schedules aligned.

Where the problem started:

Eventually our schedules got more and more packed as the year went on. Since I am a nursing student, I am always either studying, in class, sorting out placement or working. I work as an assistant in nursing at an age care facility 10 minutes from where we live and am always picking up shifts whenever I can. Sam has also gotten extremely busy as well working and studying.

For more context her designated classrooms and building for her degree on campus was close to Sam's but all the way across campus to mine.

She started showing up on my way to classes acting like we ran in to each other enough for me to start questioning why she was there, I saw her in my building a couple times but she did not come up to me but kept her distance (I don't think she would have any reason to come into my building at all). She started coming to my gym despite saying she hated working out. She joined a club that I was apart of acting like she didn't know I was in it when we went for a meeting.

I asked her about why she was in my building and she said that she was looking for me so we could have lunch and that there was no-one else she could ask despite the fact she knew I had classes during lunch time and Sam did not and her building was closer.

I swear a couple times I saw outside of my work (there is no way she could get into the building there are multiple codes and entrances for staff only and I typically work late so outside visiting hours).

This has been going on for months, it started probably in April and it is currently November.

This has not been the only things. My belonging are constantly going missing. We share a washing machine/dryer so sometimes are clothes get mixed up but we always give them back to each other. I have lost a countless amount of bras and underwear , a few tops and pants but more recently my work clothes and university scrubs.

I can kinda understand my personal clothes despite the fact all of us are different sizes (I have a smaller bra and underwear size compared to Sam and Zoe to the point it is obvious as well as being a couple sizes smaller with general clothing).

My work clothes and scrubs... I can not understand.

As I mentioned I am the only person doing nursing and working in health care. My work uniform is a green and white stripped button up with black dress pants AND my name and work logo is embroidered into my shirt.

My scrubs are fully purple with my degree on the front and 'STUDENT NURSE"" on the back. I don't know how anyone could possibly mix that up. I originally only has two pairs of nursing scrubs and had to order another couple work shirts.

I asked Zoe and Sam of they knew where they had gone. Sam said no but said she would help me look but Zoe immediately said that I must've lost them.

Other belongings such as my lip balms, pens, books, pencil cases, toiletries out of my bathroom have gone missing as well. I can explain pens and lip balms but one thing I can't explain is my journal...

I carry around a purple journal in my bag at all times. This has my WHOLE schedule planned out and I write in it quite often usually using it at least once a day. I went home briefly to change after classes on my way to work, leaving my bag on the kitchen table before I came back out of my room grabbing my bag and leaving.

I did not see anyone in the apartment but when I got to work and tried checking something in my journal it was gone despite the fact I used it just before I left campus so probably an hour before I got home and changed and left again.

I look everywhere thinking it slipped out of my bag but I swear I had it when I went to change.

Zoe has started appearing more frequently now (I lost my journal about a month ago) She is now EVERYWHERE.

I keep telling myself that I must be imaging things and no way I could be getting talked by my own roommate but I always feel like in am being watched or my belongings are going missing or something is misplaced in my room.

What should I do?? Our lease is ending in a month and I want to get away from Zoe...

I feel like I cant accuse Zoe of anything without proof, I keep telling myself it's nothing. I think I am going crazy.

Help please...

1opvgk4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vietnam_Tourism/comments/1opvgk4/my_vietnam_tour_experience/,My Vietnam tour experience,"I am from India. I took a 10 day trip to Vietnam with my wife and here is my experience in bullet points. 

Cities visited - Da Nang > Saigon > Phu Quoc.
Month - November 2025

1. Yes Vietnamese people don't know English. But they are very helpful and always with a smile too. Google translate was very handy.

2. Use Grab for taxi and Klook for recreational activities and your will be safe. 

3. We were never once bothered by scammers. But always check the Taxi registration number before boarding. Some Taxi drivers tried to trick us into getting in even though they were not the one assigned to us.

4. Vietnamese cold coffee is the best! I had atleast 2 everyday. Salt coffee was also good.

5. Vietnam is not cheap! From an Indian context atleast. We spent a lot on water bottles alone! They have no MRP. So prices can sometimes be double or triple in some places. If you depend on western food and don't like the local cuisine, be ready to pay more.

6. Don't spend time in shopping. Every market in all three cities were identical. There were like 4 different shops that keep repeating over and over. And they were not cheap or special either. 

7. Spend time exploring the local cuisine. Da Nang is a paradise for Sea Food. 

8. CHECK WEATHER before you book tickets. We narrowly escaped floods in Da Nang. 

9. Ba Na Hills will be awesome, for someone who has not been to Europe. We stayed there for one night and we loved it. It didn't feel like a cheap knock off of European architecture. They have put a lot of effort into the property and it's evident.
 
10. Staying in Bana Hills overnight gives you the chance to visit the Golden Bridge early in the morning and beat the crowd.

11. There is no limit to how many times you can experience the shows and rides. But  even after two days there were places we missed.

12. We experienced no problems with VietJet. We were worried after seeing so many negative reviews online. Maybe we were lucky. But chose Air Asia for international and only used VietJet for domestic travel.

13. In our experience Saigon had very little to offer. The cathedral is under renovation. The post office is not all that amazing. And Da Nang had a lot more to offer that we had not enough time to cover even after 3 whole days.

14. The Dragon bridge was just ok. Sơn Trà Marina, Da Nang was also a bit over hyped in my opinion.

15. Cocktails were really good and pretty cheap in Maia Beach Bar. The food and ambience were also awesome. 

16. Beer is really cheap compared to India and the quality is also a lot better. I tried every brand and none of them were disappointing. Alcohol in general is pretty cheap. 

17. Hoi An is a must visit. You can cover Hoi An and marble mountain in a single day trip from Da Nang. And don't book Day Trips online. Just take Grab. It's a lot cheaper.

18. I haven't got much to say about Saigon. It was not bad nor was it great.

19. In Phu Quoc we made the mistake of staying 2 days in Sunset Town and 2 days in Grand World. And we totally missed out on the local goodies of Duong Dong. 

20. Island hopping in Phu Quoc is just a cash grab if you have been to some other beautiful islands. There were no corals and the beaches were not all that crystal clear. I have been to Phi Phi and that was a paradise. Most water activities are pretty costly too.

21. None of the beaches were strikingly beautiful either. I have not been to Hanoi or Halong Bay. But maybe there are better beach destinations in the north. But sun set at the sun set town was breath taking. 

22. The Sun Bavaria Gastro pub was really good. They had some amazing live dance and music performances that we didn't even know about until we got there. Be there after sunset and it will be amazing.

23. We went in October 2025, maybe it's off season but most of Sun Set town was unoccupied and felt like a ghost town. But in whole of Vietnam we never felt unsafe anywhere. Grand World Phu Quoc was also deserted at night. Maybe it's better to stay in Duong Dong and visit both the locations as a day trip. Grand World provides free shuttle and they have app to see the bus route and timings too.

24. The one thing I hated about Phu Quoc is nothing to do with Vietnam but with Indian tourists. They have no civic sense whatsoever. At one point we were waiting in line for a ride in Grand World Phu Quoc.  The whole place is setup like a Aztec pyramid with a bit cramped tunnels that resembles an old pyramid. And around 40 indians came rushing in. Shouting at the top their voices, all of them, at the same time! Who is talking and who is listening if all of them are shouting! And one guy kept whistling in high pitch which was echoing through the tunnel like crazy. There were some irritated Chinese, Vietnamese and Europeans standing in queue who did not deserve this. And at one point the crowd started chanting bharat mata ki jai! But why? You are standing in queue for a ride! 

25. Phu Quoc was not bad by any means. We had a great time. But just don't go there looking for snorkeling or corals. 

26. And if you want vegetarian food say VEGAN and the people will understand. ",3,1762425076.0,Vietnam_Tourism,1,1.0,False

1opvgdw,https://www.reddit.com/r/pestcontrol/comments/1opvgdw/grain_mites_mould_mites/,Grain mites/ mould mites,"Hey guys, we’ve been battling a grain / mite infestation since last Thursday and we’re unsure what to do about it as we keep finding some alive ones especially in our expensive coffee machine which has been disassembled but we don’t want to spray it with the non food safe pesticide….

We got an infestation from an open  fajita kit box and probably the cereal that was right beside it… by the time I noticed it they were already all over the counters. I wiped the counters and the presses with bleach and a water and vinegar solution and also soapy water… I was at it all night. 
The next day we were able to use Ardap spray for birds and bird food , that seemed to have worked wonders but now we’re all out and have been using a bed bug powder and another not so food safe spray for nooks and crannies in the kitchen .

I binned ALL the food and the toaster. I keep finding them sitting inside rubber seals of containers that have no food in them and I think they’re surviving that way? I’m not sure can they actually survive that way? 
I also have the dehumidifier going in the kitchen. I live in Ireland and it’s not actually possible to bring the humidity level down that much and it’s been raining non stop…

We live in a rented place and i don’t know should we tell the landlord? I fear the house itself is quite wet in behind all the counters as the boiler has leaked multiple times before….
