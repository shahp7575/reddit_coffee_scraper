Loud music blares from an apartment on the sixth floor and those living on the floor below wonder if they should call 911. The person who lives in the apartment where the party is taking place has already warned the neighbors that there may be a high volume during the evening, but the question is where is the limit for how loud the volume can be. Those who live in the floor below don't want to complain too much because they know that the tenant above them is tidy and really nice. So those who live on the floor below choose to wait and see how long the loud music continues to play.

The seven girls who were each attacked by a Facehugger in Gamla stan are invited to the party and they sing along to the song that is playing right now and it's about riding Epa tractors and driving 30 kilometers an hour. None of the girls have ever driven an Epa tractor but they think they are very cool. In addition, it is a very happy and pleasant song.

The girls' names are Mia, Pia, Sarah, Angela, Malin, Mona and Kikki. Mona is the oldest of them and she hates when everyone pronounces her name as Mååna. Sarah has a crush on one of the guys at the party, but despite drinking a lot of alcohol, she's too shy to ask for a dance with the guy so she dances with her other six friends. Pia feels that she has to do some private needs, but she doesn't want to take her purse to the toilet, so she asks Malin to guard it, and Malin happily accepts the purse and hangs it on one shoulder.

Mia looks out into the kitchen and she wants more chips so she goes out into the kitchen and walks over to one of the big chip bowls and takes a big handful of chips in her hand and shoves them into her mouth. These particular chips are spicy and it stings a little in Mia's throat, but she still thinks it's nice to have a little spice instead of tame chips. Mia suddenly feels a very violent movement in her ribcage and she loses her breath because the movement is so strong. Mia stands still for a few seconds to see if the movement returns but when nothing has happened for a few seconds she goes out to her friends again. Angela accidentally spills a drink on a handsome guy standing very close to her and he gets angry and grabs Angela's shirt and shakes her. Mia pushes the guy away and snarls at him.

- Don't you ever touch my friend like that. She didn't do it on purpose.

The guy moves forward towards Mia and presses his body against hers and she finds it uncomfortable. Mia doesn't know this guy but she's seen him at other parties she's been to. The guy puts his hands right on Mia's breast and she gets angry and roars at him.

- You better remove your hands from my breasts. They are mine and not yours.

But the guy doesn't remove his hands from Mia's breasts, instead he starts caressing and touching them. Mia is just about to push the guy away when she feels the strong movement in her chest again and it can be seen that the guy also feels the movement because he removes his hands from Mia's breasts and backs away a few centimeters.

- What the hell was that? What a fucking freak you are.

Angela saw when the guy touched Mia's breast and she gets behind him and brutally wrestles him down and he lands on the floor. The guy looks up at Mia and Angela and it's clear he's pissed at them.

- Your fucking pussies.

- Thank you the same. We don't want you around. Mia, come on, let's go to the kitchen.

Mia follows Angela to the kitchen and Angela also takes a handful of chips which she puts into her mouth. The guy gets up and stands looking at the girls but then moves on into the room. Mia has a stove behind her and Angela has a sink behind her. Mia feels a new violent movement in her entire chest and she moans weakly and Angela immediately walks up to her.

- How is it? Do you have pain anywhere?

- There is something... I have felt several strong movements throughout my chest but I don't know what it is.

- Damn. I did too right before I wrestled down the guy who pawed at you. What is happening?

Mia doesn't have a good answer to what is happening, but she hopes she won't feel more movements in her chest. It's starting to feel a little creepy and Mia can't help but think of that scene in the movie Alien when a monster is born from a man's chest. It was several years ago that Mia saw that film, but she suddenly remembers that particular scene and it fills her with great discomfort. Angela gives Mia a big hug and they hold each other and mumble quietly to each other.

- You and me forever. Never forget that.

Mia and Angela have almost always been together in one way or another since they were in the same room when they were born and their bond with each other is very strong. None of the other friends have as strong a bond as Mia and Angela.

Mia again feels a violent movement throughout her chest and this time it feels as if something from inside Mia's body is kicking or hitting her chest. Angela feels exactly the same and she loses her breath because the movement is so powerful. Angela begins to cry when the movement has stopped.

- I'm scared. This doesn't feel right.

- Me too. This is reminiscent of what happens in the movie Alien.

- Does the movie end happily?

- No. Not for whoever has the creature in their chest anyway

There is a gnawing and cracking sound from Mia's chest and she sees how her whole chest is stretched out more than it should be able to and she moans in horror and pain. It hurts when the chest is stretched and every time the gnawing sound is heard it hurts even more. Mia realizes that the cracking sound comes every time the ribcage expands. The gnawing sound gets more and more intense and the chest expands more and more often and Mia feels that she would rather die. The gnawing sound doesn't seem to be coming from Angela's chest but her chest are also distending at regular intervals and the pauses when they are not distending have become shorter and shorter. Mia and Angela grab each other's hands and hold them tightly. If they die, they shall die together in this kitchen.

Two chestbursters explode from Mia and Angela's chests at the exact same time and the little beasts make big holes in the girls' chests because they are so close together. It also means that not so much blood splashes out in the kitchen when the Chestbursters are born. The volume on the stereo is so high that none of the guests hear the birth cries of the Chestbursters and none of the guests see what is happening in the kitchen. The two Chestbursters eat all the nourishment they can get from the two victims and once they have eaten all the meat they crawl out of the kitchen and into the living room where the party is still going on.

At the same time as Mia and Angela go out into the kitchen, Pia sits on the toilet and does her needs but suddenly she hears a gnawing sound from her chest and she flinches at the unexpected sound. Even though Pia is drunk, she knows without a doubt that the gnawing sound coming from her chest is not normal and she rushes her needs and pulls up her panties and shorts and leaves the toilet without flushing. Pia looks into the living room and looks for Malin. But Malin is not in the living room, she is standing in the hall near a smaller bedroom which in turn leads to a large balcony. Pia sees Malin after a little while and walks up to her. Pia gets her purse back and Malin tilts her head.

- Do you have a cigarette? I didn't want to rummage through your purse.

- Of course I have. You know that.

- Can I borrow you a cigarette?

- Sure, absolutely. There are no problems.

- I'll buy you a box of cigarettes tomorrow. After all, I have borrowed some from you.

- Thats fine. You can give them to me when you can afford it.

Pia and Malin go out on the balcony and smoke each cigarette. Right now it's just them on the balcony and Pia thinks it's nice because then she can talk alone with Malin. Pia stands and thinks about how she is going to tell about the gnawing sound she heard. Malin looks up at the full moon and laughs, and she slurs a little when she talks.

- We have another out there who also is drunk. Look at the full moon.

Pia looks at the full moon and also starts to laugh, but some of the smoke from the cigarette goes down into her lungs when she laughs and she starts to cough heavily. At the same time, she feels a very strange movement in her chest. It almost feels like an eel twisting and turning in a fishing net, and Pia thinks it feels extremely uncomfortable. It takes a few seconds but then the gnawing sound starts again and it is much louder this time and Malin hears it too and frowns.

- What is that sound? Wait a minute, it seems to be coming from...you.

Pia tries to breathe but she can't get any air. It's as if the airways have completely closed and she panics and starts to tear her hands at her throat. Suddenly, Pia feels something inside her ribcage hitting her chest and she can also see that the chest is stretched out more than should be possible. Malin sees when Pia's chest are stretched out and she backs away towards the other side of the balcony and looks terrified. Pia's chest are stretched once more and this time a snake-like appearance can be seen through the skin on the chest.

- Oh my God. This just can't happen. It must not happen.

Pia's body bends back and her chest explodes in a shower of blood and the Chestburster is born and it makes its birth cry and the shrill sound mixes with Malin's own scream. It takes a few seconds but then Malin hears a gnawing sound from her own chest and it sounds the same as the sound that was heard from Pia's chest. Malin's cigarette falls onto the gray cement floor and burns one of Malin's hands, but she doesn't focus on that, instead she looks at Chestburster, who starts to crawl out of Pia's chest. There is a sickening plop sound as the Chestburster completely leaves Pia's chest and lands on the cement floor. Instead of crawling towards Malin, the Chestburster chooses to crawl into the bedroom and Malin feels that she should warn the other guests about the monster so she leave the balcony and goes into the living room. The volume is still very high in the living room and Malin tries to shout out a warning to the others but she can't bear to drown out the booming music.

Malin sees Mona standing and talking to some guys and she runs towards Mona and starts pulling on her. Mona gets irritated and doesn't want to listen to Malin right now and especially not when she pulls on her. Malin screams in Mona's ear.

- Pia is dead. A monster exploded out of her chest and the monster is coming toward this room. I think the same thing will happen to me.

Mona stares at Malin as if she were crazy.

- What the hell are you talking about? You mean like in the movie Alien?

- Yes exactly and the little monster looks exactly the same as the one in the movie.

- You know, I firmly believe you've had a little too much to drink tonight.

Malin is about to answer when she goes completely limp in her legs and collapses on the floor. Mona bends down and tries to lift Malin up. Malin's body is almost off the floor when a Chestburster explodes from her chest and blood sprays over Mona and the two guys standing nearby. One of the guys thinks it's a joke and points to the bloody Chestburster, but the other guy realizes that this isn't a joke, it's real, and he gets sick looking at the Chestburster.

- Oh, how disgusting.

The chestburster crawls out of Malin's chest and lands on the floor and quickly crawls under the long sofa and disappears from view. The guy who understands that this is no joke tries to grab the Chestburster's tail and pull it out of the couch but it has gotten too far under the couch. Mona runs out into the hall and takes out her mobile phone and calls 112. Mona is quickly connected and she tries to explain what has happened and the panic is heard in her voice. Whoever answers 112 tries to calm Mona down and find out the address where she is. Mona feels a very strong movement propagate through her entire chest and she immediately understands that a Chestburster will be born from her chest as well. The person answering 112 has not seen the Alien movies and has no idea what Mona is talking about and she can also hear that the caller is under the influence of alcohol or drugs so she is unsure if she should take this call seriously.

The two Chestbursters that were born from Mia and Angela's chest are now in the living room and the first victim that the first Chestburster attacks is the guy who pulled Angela's shirt and the attack happens so fast that the guy doesn't have time to call for help. The guy lands face down and the Chestburster eats his vocal cords, rendering him unable to make any sounds. The guy gets eaten alive and meanwhile the other Chestburster attacks a girl who is unconscious and lying on the floor. No one has noticed her lying on the floor and no one sees the Chestburster eating her body. The chestburster that ate the guy has absorbed the most nutrition and begins to change and turn into a full grown Alien monster. A few of the visitors see the Alien monster as it is almost completely transformed and they immediately think that it is one of the guests who has dressed up as an Alien monster.

Mona is still talking to 112 and they have now got the address and they promise to send an ambulance and police to the relevant apartment building and Mona feels a little calmer than when she called. Maybe it was just imagination that something was moving in her chest.

A guy named David who is extremely drunk sees the full-grown Alien monster and he wants to pet the monster. It´s body looks so inviting and David calls out

- Come here you big sexy beast.

The Alien monster doesn't react when David calls out to it but stands still and seems to be looking at one of the young girls and David gets frustrated and gets up from the sofa on wobbly legs and starts walking towards the Alien monster. David comes from behind and he approaches the Alien monster. None of David's friends seem to react to what he's doing and it doesn't bother him. David is soon right behind the Alien monster and he carefully lifts its tail. The tail is very hard and resembles the feel of a beetle but there are lots of thorn-like projections on the tail as well and they are so hard that one of David's fingers starts to bleed but he doesn´t care that the finger hurts.

The alien monster starts to move and David follows it very close. The alien monster approaches one of David's friends and David watches as the monster opens its jaw and ejects the inner jaw with great force, crushing the back of the friend's head with a nasty cracking sound. The inner jaw is pulled back but is soon pushed out with even more force and the force is so high that the friend's head detaches from the neck and lands on the floor.

The alien monster goes out into the kitchen and David can see Mia and Angela's dead bodies and above all he can see the holes in their chests where the Chestbursters were born and he can guess that this monster may belong to one of those born from MIa and Angela. The alien monster shoots out its inner jaw and it breaks several of the glass bowls on the table and several pieces of glass land on the floor. David tries to avoid stepping on the glass on the floor but he fails and a long and sharp piece of glass penetrates through his socks and right into his foot. David howls in pain because it hurts so much and he can see that Mona is standing in the hall and that she has a cell phone in one hand. 

The alien monster gets up on a chair and seems to be looking around at the victims in the living room and the monster drools heavily. Some of the drool gets stuck in Davids hair and he giggles about it. The alien monster gets off the chair again and David follows it. 

The chestburster that was born from Malin's chest crawls out of the sofa and moves forward across the floor in a coiling snake-like motion and it approaches David. The chestburster sinks its sharp steel teeth into David's right leg and he roars loudly as the sharp teeth tear the skin off the leg. The Chestburster continues to pull the skin and flesh from David's leg and after a while the Chestburster climbs higher up on David's body and he tries to remove it but the Chestburster is too strong. The chestburster eats away at David's body while he is still alive and soon David no longer feels any pain from the injured foot and his consciousness fades bit by bit. Soon Davids body falls on the adult Alien monster and it turns around and starts to eat what the Chestburster missed.

Sarah and Kikki have entered a larger room which is usually a bedroom but which has now been changed to a small minibar. There is plenty of alcohol behind the bar but Sarah and Kikki don't want to drink right now but have gone here because they found it less crowded than the living room and they can talk to each other without having to drown out the loud music. Sarah is angry because one of the boys has been mean to her and Kikki tries to comfort her. Both girls know how guys can be when they drink a lot of alcohol. Kikki even has pepper spray in her purse in case it's needed.

Sarah felt a strange movement in her chest before she went up to the apartment but since then she has not felt any movement in her chest but now suddenly she feels that her chest feels abnormally heavy and she feels some discomfort but shakes it off and continues to talk to Kikki. Kikki goes silent for a moment and seems to be thinking about something and then she starts to smile.

- Do you remember when we both lived in the same apartment building? I remember how we were messing around and playing out there in the yard. The old people were even afraid of us because we were so wild.

- Yes, I remember that. The yard has been rebuilt and is nicer now but there are hardly any playhouses and other things for the children to climb in. Everything is supposed to be so hysterically safe and boring these days. The children who are growing up now in the safe environment already complain when they have scratched their legs a little. It was different in our time. Back then, people mostly complained if they got a concussion or were seriously injured.

- You fell off the big playhouse and had a concussion once, didn't you?

- Yes, that's right. I remember that. My shoes got stuck in the ceiling and I lost my balance but I still live a perfect life with no injuries.

- Mmm. I think the children are protected too much today.

Suddenly Mona comes rushing into the room and she looks hysterical. Kikki walks up to Mona and grabs her.

- What has happened?

Mona has difficulty explaining what has happened, but she does her best.

- Pia and Malin and Mia and Angela are dead. A monster exploded from their chest. Just like in the Alien movies.

- But what are you saying? You can´t be serious.

Mona's whole body jerks and there is a cracking sound from her chest as it expands and Kikki can see a snake-like shape through the skin on Mona´s chest. Kikki starts backing up in the room and Sarah immediately notices that something is wrong.

- What is wrong? Kikki, talk to me.

Kikki doesn't know what to answer and Sarah becomes even more worried when she sees Kikki's pale face. Sarah looks over at Mona but she sees nothing strange about her except.. several drops of blood on her light colored clothes. Sarah walks up to Mona.

- Has anyone hurt you? If so, who?

Mona shakes her head because no one has hurt her. Sarah is now standing between Mona and Kikki and she looks at them wonderingly.

- Can any of you explain what this is about?

A Chestburster explodes from Mona's chest and blood splatters all the way to Kikki. Sarah involuntarily takes a step back when the Chestburster is born and she doesn't want to believe what she's seeing but the little monster in Mona's chest is real even though it shouldn't be. The chestburster screams out its birth cry and the shrill sound echoes in the room. The bartender behind the bar also sees what is happening and he hides behind the bar. The chestburster pops out of Mona's chest with a wet sound and lands on the floor and starts moving towards Sarah. Sarah looks around the room for something to hurt the monster with and the only thing she finds is a broken glass bottle. Sarah turns to see where the Chestburster is and the distance between Sarah and the beast is shrinking rapidly. The chestburster writhes on the floor like a long reddish snake with an elongated head.

Sarah takes a firm grip on the broken glass bottle and when the Chestburster is almost at her feet, she presses the broken part of the glass bottle against the Chestburster's body and she manages to make a hole in its skin. The yellow blood spurts up from the hole in the Chestburster's skin and Sarah sees that the blood is starting to corrode the floor and she realizes that she has to move if the blood is not going to corrode her skin. Sarah moves further and further away from the Chestburster and soon she is standing next to Kikki and she takes her hand and begins to lead her out of the room.

- Come on, we're leaving this room.

When Sarah and Kikki come out into the hall, they almost collide with a full-grown Alien monster and they silently stare at its elongated banana-like head and long tail. It doesn't seem like the Alien monster sees Sarah and Kikki and it goes out into the living room. Sarah and Kikki are as quiet as they can be as they move forward in the hall and Sarah already has an idea of ​​where to go. Sarah has intended to go to the large balcony. If the Alien monsters get there, both she and Kikki can jump down to the ground and survive. True, their bones may break, but they will still survive. Sarah looks into the living room and sees another full grown Alien monster and it's full of blood all over the floor. There are several Chestbursters coiling around the floor like big long snakes and several of the guys in the living room are dead. Sarah sees a girl half lying on the sofa and she looks unharmed so Sarah whistles and the girl turns to look at Sarah and Kikki and she leave the sofa and decides to follow them.

Sarah goes first and then comes the girl who was half lying on the sofa and Kikki is last. Kikki gets really dizzy and has to hold on to the wall to keep from falling, and Sarah doesn't notice that Kikki is missing until she comes out on the balcony and looks around. Sarah goes back inside to get Kikki and at the same time Kikki feels a very strong movement in her chest and it feels like someone is hitting her chest with something hard but the hard blows are coming from inside her body and she realizes with horror that she too has a Chestburster in his chest. Sarah approaches Kikki and takes her hand in hers.

- Come on now. We are safe out on the balcony.

Kikki shakes her head and sobs out what she needs to say to Sarah.

- I also have a monster in my chest. I felt it move just now and it will be born at any moment. Save yourself and don't think about me. We meet again on the other side of heaven.

- No, no, don't say that. You will be fine again.

- I wish you were right, but unfortunately it is not so. Goodbye my beloved friend.

Kikki moans and Sarah sees her chest being pushed up by a snake-like form and she realizes that Kikki is telling the truth and it makes her despair. Sarah goes out on the balcony and just as she closes the balcony door, she sees the Chestburster being born from Kikki's chest and some of the blood splashes on the inside of the window glass to the balcony. The girl who was half lying on the sofa sees what is happening and starts to scream hysterically at the same time as the Chestburster screams its birth cry. Sarah sees flashing lights nearby and hears that an ambulance is on its way to the apartment building where she is, and it doesn't take long for the ambulance to park outside the apartment building. Sarah looks down at the ambulance and feels very empty and alone. All her close friends are dead. After a while, Sarah thinks she hears someone knocking on the apartment's front door, but it's hard to tell if she's misheard because of the blaring music.

There is silence between two songs and it absolutely sounds as if someone is knocking on the front door of the apartment but no one goes to open it. Sarah decides to go and open the front door but first she grabs the other girl's hands and holds them tightly.

- Wait here. Help is coming soon. I'm just going to go and open the door so the paramedics from the ambulance can come in and help us, okay.

The girl nods but big tears roll down her cheeks and Sarah feels the same. Sarah opens the door to the balcony but the Chestburster born from KIkki moves towards her so she rushes out into the hall. Sarah manages to see that there are now four full-grown Alien monsters in the living room and when she reaches the room where the bar is, she sees that one of the Alien monsters must have picked up the bartender's body and dragged him across the floor but Mona's dead body is still on the floor in the room. Sarah opens the front door and lets three paramedics in and they look at her.

- We received an alert that help was needed. Is anyone injured?

- Umm. Me and another girl who is out on the balcony are the only survivors. There are four large monsters in the living room and they have killed several of the guests.

One of the paramedics walks towards the living room and looks in and sees that Sarah is right and he immediately goes pale in the face.

- Call the police and ask them to bring heavy weapons. It's the same type of monster that ran amok in Kungsträdgården and there seems to be a total of four of them and wait a minute, some small ones too.

The paramedic standing closest to Sarah looks at her.

- Are you unharmed?

Sarah nods silently and the paramedic grabs Sarah's hand and begins to lead her out of the apartment. The paramedic smiles at Sarah.

- I thought we'd go down and get inside the ambulance. Is that okay with you?

- Don't forget the one who is unharmed and who is out on the balcony.

The other paramedics nod and the paramedic standing closest to the stereo turns it off and it becomes very quiet in the apartment. Meanwhile, Sarah and the paramedic go down to the ground floor and when they have exited the elevator, they go out into the street. The paramedic opens the ambulance door and Sarah sits on a smaller chair and almost collapses. The paramedic stands and looks at Sarah.

- Have you drunk any alcohol?

- Yes.

- How much then?

- I have no idea. Does it matter?

- I was just wondering. Do your parents know you're here?

- I'm 27 years old so I don't have to tell them everything. They know we were going out partying.

- I understand.

Sarah sits and thinks about everything that has happened and she can't understand how the other six girls could give birth to a Chestburster. In that case, they must be attacked by a facehugger first, but Sarah has no memory of any of them being attacked by such creatures. Admittedly, something strange happened when they were walking in Gamla stan and that is the only time during the evening where her memory fails her. They walked on the hard cobblestones and Mia joked about something Per had said when the whole gang picked Mia up. But something must have happened soon after because Sarah's next memory is of her lying on the hard cobblestones with a headache and she begins to wonder what really happened. Sarah searches the memory but it is completely empty.

Sarah suddenly feels very dizzy and her body starts to lean forward but the paramedic is there and catches her body and he pulls out a stretcher.

- I think it might be good if you lay down on this stretcher. I think you have gone into shock.

Sarah lets the paramedic put her body on the stretcher and she relaxes. The paramedic enters the ambulance and retrieves equipment so he can check Sarah's pulse.

- You can lay there while I check your pulse.

Sarah closes her eyes and she remembers what has happened today. She remembers when she and her father were out with the boat this morning and they caught two herring. Mom wasn't too impressed with the little catch but Dad was so happy that Sarah was with him for once and she feels guilty that she hasn't been on many fishing trips since she turned 22. Sarah also remembers her father's somewhat sour comment when she told him that the Hip-Hop artist Roffet was going to play at Kungsträdgården. Sarah had intended to go to that concert but instead the whole family greeted their old grandmother and it was really nice even though the grandmother seemed to have a bad memory and the coffee tasted bad. When Sarah thinks about it, it has been a very eventful day and she thinks about how her mother will react when she hears what has happened to the other friends.

Sarah feels the paramedic attach the heart rate monitor to one of her arms and she opens her eyes and smiles slightly at the paramedic. The paramedic looks at what the display on the heart rate monitor is saying and it seems like it's a good reading because he looks less and less nervous.

- You have a very good and lively heart, I must say. Do you exercise often?

- No, never. Never have and never will but I try to eat a good diet.

- That is also important. Good food goes a long way in life. Do you often drink alcohol?

- No. My friends offer me alcohol a little from time to time but i don't buy anything myself.

The paramedic nods and looks satisfied.

- You can probably go home in a while if you want. I just have to wait for the other paramedics. We only have this ambulance with us.

Sarah nods and yawns widely and she starts to feel really tired so she chooses to stay on the stretcher.

Sarah looks out the open door of the ambulance and she can see several police cars heading to the apartment building and she thinks it's a good thing the police are killing the monsters. The first two police cars stop and a large police patrol jumps out of the cars and Sarah can see that they have very sharp weapons with them and it will be needed when they have to kill the Alien monsters.

Suddenly, Sarah's chest explodes in a huge explosion of blood and a Chestburster jumps out of her chest and lands on the floor of the ambulance. The paramedic is quick and jumps away so he doesn't get hurt by the Chestburster. The chestburster screams out its birth cry and one of the officers in the police patrol who is on his way into the apartment building hears the sound and rushes to the ambulance. The police manage to get hold of the Chestburster's tail and drag the little beast out into the street. The police waste no time but shoot the Chestburster dead as soon as its out of the ambulance.

The two other paramedics come out with the only survivor from the party and after Sarah's now dead body is taken out of the ambulance the paramedics drive to the Karolinska hospital as the surviving girl has gotten some of the Alien monster's corrosive blood on her skin but she will survive but has pain where the acid has corroded her skin.

The police collect identity documents and other things in the apartment so that they can tell the relatives of the dead what has happened. There will be many tears from the relatives of the victims as they learn that their young adult children are dead.

That's when I first noticed it anyway. I haven't really tried to do anything about it. I figured it would just go away. It did not. Anyways, I'm finally ready to tackle this thing because I'm sick of it. Also to help me stay awake, I'm a tired student. Whenever I shit it's very simple and quick, it doesn't take a miserably long time. Lately I've had two horrible stomach cramps that I know must be from constipation and trapped gas. Never again.

I'm a skinny 17 year old, I feel like I'm bloated all the time which I hate, and I don't drink as much water as I should. I've been getting better lately, but sometimes I take like two shits a week or three or blah. It's infrequent and stuff.

It is past 8 p.m. and there is an unusual amount of activity at the company. This late in the day there are usually only about 10 people working, but right now there are 19 people there. Bellati Video Secure is a big company but it's not the biggest in town. The company manages video surveillance of various locations in Stockholm's inner city and right now eight people are sitting watching the saved surveillance of Kungsträdgården. There are over 15 surveillance cameras at Kungsträdgården and Bellati Video Secure owns eight of the cameras. The others are owned by a smaller company called Video Checkpoint.

It was decided that the saved footage from the eight surveillance cameras would be checked when it was revealed on the news at 7pm that the events with the Alien monsters must have been sabotage. The manager of the company has called several people who work at the company and asked if they can work extra and look through the saved material. Admittedly, the manager could have sent all the material to the police directly, but chooses to check the saved material first. The manager has already checked the material from the previous day and then there were no Alien eggs in Kungsträdgården. With the help of clips that have been posted on YouTube, the manager can say that the eggs must have been placed before 12 a.m. This means that the eight who work extra must check what has been recorded between midnight and until 12 o'clock.

The eight workers checking the recordings have now come to what was recorded at 8 a.m. this morning but no one has yet placed any Alien Eggs in the park and they are carefully fast-forwarding through the saved footage while the time clock ticks in one corner. It is only when the clock on the video surveillance shows 10.43 a.m. that something interesting happens. Whoever controls the camera at the far end of the park sees Michael ride his bike out of the underground tunnel into the park and it is very clear that transparent slime is dripping from the back of the wooden cart. Unfortunately, the camera is at a bad angle so Michael's face is very poorly seen. The worker sitting at the monitoring calls out

- I have found something. Be prepared. There is a man riding a bicycle and he has a long wooden cart on the bicycle.

The seven other workers concentrate on the footage and soon they can see Michael cycling around the park. One of the workers watches as Michael places the very first Alien eggs near the stage and Michael's face is clearly visible on this camera. All seven cameras film Michael placing the eggs in various places in the park, and his face is clearly visible on the surveillance footage. Whoever is checking what has been filmed by the camera at the far end sees Michael cycling back into the tunnel. Then the clock is 10.55 a.m.

But MIchael comes back to the park through the tunnel and then the clock is 11.15 a.m. and it is clear that the wooden cart is weighed down by something and even more transparent slime drips from the back of the wooden cart. Once again, the seven workers watch as Michael deploys most of the Alien eggs and they now know it is a deliberate act of sabotage. The worker who sees Michael placing the eggs at the horse and gray seal paddock is very upset when he sees what is happening because he is an animal lover. The seven workers do not see Michael placing the eggs at the alleys because there are no cameras right there and they can only see when he places a few of the eggs at the green area but they have enough evidence to send the footage to the police. One of the workers murmurs quietly to the image of Michael.

- If I ever get hold of you, I will torture you to death very slowly. I don't care what the law in Sweden says. I will torture you to death.

The manager of the company calls the police and they retrieve all the saved material and there are already two police officers ready to check the material carefully and take screenshots of whoever is placing the eggs.

**Östermalm police station**

Benjamin and Lennart retrieve the footage from the eight surveillance cameras and once they return to the police station, they enter a spare room that has equipment for printing and saving footage. There are computer programs that can blur faces and other things that the police can use. There is also a criminal register that uses advanced A1 and it is possible to send a picture to the register and it looks up whether the person seen in the picture is in the police's criminal register or not.

There are many policemen in the police station even though it is almost 9pm and both Benjamin and Lennart are working extra due to the heavy workload. Some of the police who have tried to kill the Alien monsters at Kungsträdgården have been injured and are being treated in hospital. Therefore, several police officers who are actually on holiday have had to step in and work extra. Since many Alien warriors still place lots of Alien eggs in the city, several police patrols have to go to several addresses and collect the eggs so that the people do not risk being attacked by Facehuggers. It is constantly a race against time and the police patrols do not have time to go to all the places where it is reported that there are Alien eggs.

As if the invasion of Alien monsters wasn't enough, several criminal gangs are also fighting in different places in the city and the police are trying to keep track of them too, but it's not easy. A criminal gang has broken into several jewelry stores in the city and a police patrol is chasing them with several cars and it's a big car chase. A major fire has also broken out at the beginning of Gamla stan and a police patrol is there so that the fire brigade can do their job without being disturbed by curious people. Most of Stockholm's inner city is a single chaos and it doesn't look like the chaos will stop for a long time.

Benjamin and Lennart fast-forward through the surveillance footage until the clock reads 11.15 a.m. and Michael begins to place the 30 eggs. Lennart makes sure that the material is saved in the police computer while Benjamin prints out several pictures of Michael's face. Benjamin submits the best picture to the criminal record and has it search for a similar or hopefully the same face. But Michael is not in the police's criminal records so there will be no match even if there are others who look like MIchael but they are quickly written off from the investigation.

Benjamin had an acquaintance who was in Kungsträdgården and who died from the attacks of the Alien monsters so it becomes very personal for him as he watches Michael deliberately place the eggs where he knows there will be many people. Lennart and Benjamin decide that the news will show a shorter version of Michael placing the eggs in the park but it won't happen until the next day. Hopefully there is someone in town who recognizes the person who places the eggs. The police need as much help as they can get from the public. Lennart writes a police report about what Michael is doing and he already starts writing questions for interrogation once the person has been found. Lennart thinks about whether he should give the person protection because many will surely want his head on a platter once the clips are published on TV. Lennart decides that this person will remain in custody once he is found and part of that decision is about the person's safety but also that no more Alien eggs can be placed by him. Lennart yawns and gets himself a large cup of coffee. He realizes that it will be a long night.

And she has a type of personality I honestly love in girls so that kind of was the nail in the coffin. I did think she's hot in the past but I never had a crush on her until now.

Problem is, while we've talked a few times irl and we have some common characteristics, she's doesn't really reply a lot to my texts(only casual stuff). And also I'm having some self doubts because which I know is bad but from what I also know from a friend she has a lot more experience the me and she's also quite pretty so I don't think I have much of a chance.

But still I don't know if I should drop it or try to ask her out to a coffee or something. My friend told me honestly that he doesn't think I have a chance with her but I'd still feel bad if I did nothing. I know it's not that likely given I don't have many experience at all with girls even though I'm 20 and I'm a little neurodivergent and I hate the feeling of being anxious she's probably not gonna like me but I do like her and don't know if I should pursue her further or not.

I thought it’d be fun (and maybe therapeutic) to talk about one of the most stressful parts of motorhome life—**parking**! Whether you’re squeezing into a tight spot at a campground, battling low-hanging tree branches, or just trying to parallel park on a street that suddenly feels WAY too narrow, we’ve all had those “please-let-this-not-be-happening” moments. 😅

Here’s one of mine: 

So, I pull into this “charming little village” in the middle of nowhere, right? The streets are tiny—like, I swear they were designed for horses, not 30-foot motorhomes. I find what I think is a decent parking spot outside a small café (I was dying for a coffee), only to realize that as soon as I park, a bunch of locals start peeking out from behind their windows, looking concerned. Turns out, I’m blocking the only road that the village post van uses to make deliveries. 😳 



Cue a very stressed me, trying to back up through a maze of cobblestone streets while a line of cars forms behind me and an elderly man on a bicycle is trying to help direct me (bless his heart, but he was just making it worse). I eventually managed to get out with only my pride bruised… and without my coffee. 😩



Anyway, I know I’m not alone in this! What’s your worst motorhome parking nightmare? Did you ever get stuck somewhere crazy, or have a moment where you were like, “Yep, I’m just going to live here now”? Let’s hear those stories!

I have started my training plan 19 weeks ago. I run alternating weeks of 4 run days and 5 run days per week. I run any where from 30-45 miles a week. 
I eat before every long run, usually a double serving of oatmeal with a Kirkland protein shake and majority of my easy runs I eat just 1 banana and for my speed work, I typically eat 1 serving of oatmeal and 1 banana and a smaller protein shake.
 Before all my runs I always have a homemade coldbrew coffee, with locally roasted fresh coffee beans.

I run most of my runs in Hoka Mach 5s and 6s. I really prefer the 5s over the 6s. I feel as if the toe box on the Mach 5s are wider and more comfortable. I do own a pair of Brooks ghost but I don't really care for them so I save those for the rain days. 

I have always wanted to be a trail runner, I find those people to be really cool! It looks so much fun but I don't live anywhere near a trail running area. My family moved to NYC, so most of all my runs are on the city road. Which isn't ideal because there are so many people in NYC, but it is what it is. 

Anyways, I have a marathon coming up and I was thinking about how cool it would be to videotape it. I have seen so many people on tiktok doing this, ""this is me at mile x"" and I was hoping to do that too!
I was thinking I could post it on tiktok and tag the link to the video on this post later on when I run my marathon and you all can watch it! 
I heard you can make a lot of money if you get rich and famous!!!!!!!!!

So my question is, I am running my marathon in a few weeks and I was hoping to find out what kind of selfie stick I should go with???

I have an android phone. If that helps. It is a galaxy s21 ultra.(crack in the screen top left corner) I do have a phone case. The phone case is just a cheaper phone case I bought off amazon prime that I use and share account with my 2 sisters and 1 brother. 
I do not mind buying a new phone case that would be better fit for a selfie stick so I can record my marathon. But this current phone case has some cool sticker graphics on it so I would rather the selfie stick be more universal to adapt to any type of phone case? 

I hope to hear back from anyone who has feed back of running with a selfie stick, or should I just hold my phone??

Or can I ask a fellow runner to hold my phone for me? That would be cool cause then if someone held my phone for me I can get some cool running video shots of me running past the phone. And it would save me the hassle of having to stop and go back and retrieve my phone.

Which is why I was looking for recommendations on a selfie stick that I can use on my generic sticker bombed phone case so I can run my marathon and record it and post it on tiktok and I will copy the link and tag it to this post so you guys can watch it and see how well I did.

1g8lwfe,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1g8lwfe/fellow_aiden_first_impressions_and_review/,Fellow Aiden First Impressions and Review,"I recently received the new Fellow Aiden coffee machine so I thought I'll give some thoughts considering its still a bit of a wasteland on online discourse with this machine.

The first major contention I've seen some reviewers discuss was the build quality, and so I was a bit apprehensive buying it in case I'd have to deal with a bad batch or something with an early product release cycle. As I live in the UK I'm also unsure on the warranty support here.

Anyway, when I received the machine it did look like they had fixed the misalignment issues and warped plastic I saw one recent review show, as everything was pretty much level. However another issue I have is that on the top lip of the glass screen (or plastic, not sure what it is), there is a small crack.

I notified the store I bought it from and they helpfully offered a 10% partial refund, but I will note that it does seem to be pretty fragile in shipping for anyone looking to buy it. Maybe they should add some foam around the glass part?

Apart from that the plastic and whatnot is sturdy enough. The water container and the hinges don't look too flimsy and seem to have some built in tolerance to moving side to side which is a nice touch. For the price I wasn't expecting the same build quality of my fellow ode, though it is pretty funny that my tiny grinder is heavier than this machine.

I have had no issues with the UI part, and the update process was basically automatic, though it did lag the interface for a while when I first connected it to the internet (they should make it obvious its updating). As I am a CS Graduate I do have a particular fondness for the modern appeal of this device. It certainly sets itself apart from a lot of other machines that opt to not take advantage of the cheap LCD and processors available. Of course, its much more expensive to develop quality software for a LCD screen.

I come from a mainly AeroPress background, and my main desire for this machine was that I often find it a bit of a pain to go through the motions of a manual process. This machine certainly streamlines the process a lot, and the coffee it makes is very predictable for a setting, so dialing in is a lot easier compared to a manual process with more variables (atleast for me).

It makes nice coffee, basically. Better than what I can do anyway. I think it'll be a lot of fun to share and optimize profiles with this machine as it basically removes a swathe of unknown variables, allowing you to truly taste coffee the way it was intended. It's like a reference monitor for coffee, if you get me. Of course the grinder variable still exists but its a step forward nonetheless.

I'll have to continue experimenting with the profiles and whatnot to get a cup I'm fully happy with, but I think it's a very well thought out machine for the price. The fact it isn't massively expensive is a big plus as fellow could have easily gone down the luxury route for such a unique product.

1g8luyb,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_WoodenAd1628/comments/1g8luyb/the_lightning_lord_who_invented_the_twentieth/,"The Lightning Lord who invented the twentieth century: the story of Nikola Tesla, who is almost not written about in physics textbooks","People called him a wizard, he considered himself a scientist. He was compared to Leonardo and blamed for the explosion of the Tunguska meteorite. He marked the beginning of worldwide electrification, with more than 1,000 inventions to his credit. July 10 is the birthday of Nikola Tesla, one of the most controversial characters in world science — either the greatest genius, or a schizophrenic and a charlatan.

The stories that are told about Tesla are real fiction. Eyewitness accounts are known, as in his laboratory in Wardencliff (""Tesla Tower""), he passed through himself, like a mad sorcerer or wizard, in front of eyewitnesses currents of great force and remained completely unharmed. In the giant hall of the laboratory, monstrous lightning bolts struck every night, which writers and journalists gathered to watch: from a fan of Nicola Mark Twain to the editors of the largest newspapers. Tesla snapped his fingers to create a ball of vibrating red flame and held it in his hands without the slightest consequences. Many of his experimental tricks have not yet been explained.

Wireless power transmission, remote control, transatlantic telephony, radio broadcasting, alternating current, modern type motors, fluorescent light, speedometer and thousands of other inventions — this is what owes its appearance to this strange Serbian genius. Why is the scientist and inventor Nikola Tesla only casually mentioned in physics textbooks?

The boy who survived

Nikola, the fourth child in the large family of the Orthodox Serbian priest Milutin Tesla, had an eventful life. He was born on July 10, 1856 in the Serbian village of Smilyan in the province of Lika, — this Balkan region was then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire between the mountains and the Adriatic coast.

His father, a priest and publicist, wrote essays to literary magazines under the pseudonym Just. Her mother, Georgina Mandich Tesla, was a bright and interesting woman; she also grew up in a priest's family. There were five children in the family: three daughters — Milka, Angelina and Maritz, and two sons — Nikola and his older brother Dan, Daniel.

Nikola believed that he inherited his abilities from his mother. There are many pages in Tesla's memoirs devoted to childhood: from early youth, Georgina had to run a household in a large family, so she could not graduate from school, and her talents did not receive proper development. But she had an outstanding memory, and she recited whole books of poems by Serbian and European poets by heart. Later, Nikola Tesla also had an amazing memory: he memorized the entire page after one look at it, knew, loved and appreciated poetry, knew a lot by heart. And he wrote poetry himself, the love of which his mother instilled in him.

It is impossible to accurately reconstruct the scientist's childhood, which took place in the village of Smilyan and the town of Gospich: Nikola's own autobiography seems to be a collection of fantastic plots and extraordinary incidents.

According to the stories of Nikola Tesla himself, he miraculously survived as a child: he drowned several times, almost boiled in a tank with boiling milk, was locked at night in an old tomb.

He was chased by rabid dogs, flocks of sinister crows, wild boars during the rutting season. When the name of physicist and engineer Tesla thunders all over the world, people will wonder where the eccentric researcher got so many oddities, phobias and obsessions — hatred of earrings, pearls and peaches, counting steps when walking and stairs, obsessive craving to measure the volume of plates with soup and cups of coffee. At the sight of paper being lowered into the water, Nikola had a strange taste in her mouth. In general, the boy was extremely receptive, sensitive and suspicious. Whether these qualities always go hand in hand with imagination, intuition and freedom of thought is unclear. But in Nikola, all these features, for his good fortune or misfortune, combined.

When Nicola was five, his older and talented brother Daniel died, the dream and hope of the whole family, with whom Nicola was compared all his childhood. The story of the death of the elder brother varies from source to source: he either fell off his horse, or fell down the stairs. This childhood experience strongly influenced Nikola: he began to have visions and prophetic dreams with flashes.

The first class of the Tesla school studied in the village of Smilyan. In 1862, the family moved to the small town of Gospic, the center of the province of Lika, where Nikola graduated from elementary and secondary school. The native language of the future inventor was Serbo-Croatian, and he learned four languages: English, French, German, and Italian. He had no equal in mathematics, and when it came to physics and experiments, the teenager was delighted.

In 1870, 14-year-old Nikola, who was making great progress in his studies, entered the Higher Real College of Karlovac, where he continued to enthusiastically study natural sciences and dreamed of entering the Polytechnic Institute. The father was categorically against it: according to Milutin Tesla, his only son Nikola was waiting for a career as a priest.

After receiving a certificate from a real school in 1873, Tesla came to Gospić when cholera was raging there and fell seriously ill. The doctors believed that Nikola would die: he was so ill that the doctors seriously feared for his life. A frightened father who had lost one son was ready to do anything to encourage the patient — and promised that if his son recovered, he would be able to go to university, not to a seminary. Nikola is on the mend. However, the disease left consequences: the visions that began in childhood after the death of his brother, flashes of bright light, intensified. Since then, ideas of inventions have been constantly swarming in the young man's head.

Interestingly, Tesla believed that he could mentally construct any device and test its performance without resorting to experiments. And so it was: in the future, the scientist's devices did not need to be tested — he repeatedly did it in his imagination.

Cards, money and an electric motor

In order for the young man, weak after illness, not to serve in the Austrian army, his relatives sent him to study in Austria, where he passionately devoted himself to studying. In 1875, Nicola managed to enter the Polytechnic School in Graz. He studied selflessly and completed two years of study in one: he sat down to his textbooks at three in the morning and worked until eleven at night. He studied physics, mathematics and mechanics. But Tesla did not graduate from college: the money sent by his relatives ran out. In order to get money for a living, the student began gambling and achieved success in billiards, but it did not help him to stay at the institute.

Later, the family said that the police had to deport a talented and completely uncontrollable student Tesla from Graz and expel him from college for playing cards and carousing. Nikola went to Prague, where he lived for two years. What he was doing there is not known for certain. The engineer and inventor himself later reported that he studied at the University of Prague, but there is no such name in the lists of university students. Most likely, he freely attended open lectures, courses and studied in libraries, educating himself and following what is happening in the field of electricity in modern physics.

In 1881 (when Nikola Tesla was 25 years old) Europe was shocked by the announcement that the European branch of Thomas Alva Edison's Edison General Electric company (later the company would become known as General Electric) would open in Budapest. It was the best work of the century.

""We will make electricity so cheap that only the rich will burn candles""

Thomas Edison

Edison was a star of that time. A millionaire scientist and inventor, he was involved in progress in all its manifestations: he conducted electricity, improved telephony and telegraphy, invented light bulbs. It was the then Elon Musk, his very name signified the future. A businessman and scientist who gave the world technology and light, Thomas Edison was extremely popular.

Of course, Nikola Tesla dreamed of working for Edison! He went to Budapest, but the world-famous Edison company did not take him, yesterday's boy with an incomplete education, then Tesla got a job at the telegraph office. It's okay, he'll wait. He will prove it! And he succeeded: an unknown telegraphic engineer Nikola Tesla invented a fundamentally new alternating current electric motor.

Tesla called this time a ""state of intellectual happiness."" Ideas overwhelmed him.

Nikola Tesla's alternating current electric motor was a breakthrough. The motor maintained a higher voltage than with direct current, and due to lower resistance losses, current could be transmitted over long distances. It remained to make humanity believe in alternating current.

In 1882, Nikola Tesla finally got a job at Edison's subsidiary telephone company in Paris. He is trying to explain to Edison's employees the benefits of using alternating current. However, Nikola is disappointed: Edison, who believes in direct current, laughs at alternating current — he is not interested in Tesla's invention.

In 1883, stubborn telegraphic engineer Nikola Tesla assembled the first electric motor. He believes in himself, believes in his own strength — and goes to America, which, as it seems to Nicola, ""has overtaken Europe in technical development for a century.""

There is a version that Tesla was thinking about moving to Russia, but one of his Paris acquaintances persuaded him to choose America. And imagine if Nikola Tesla came to St. Petersburg... it sounds like the beginning of a Boris Akunin novel.

The War of Currents

In June 1884, a modestly dressed young man disembarked from a steamer at the immigration office building in Manhattan. In his pocket was a letter of recommendation to Thomas Edison, 4 cents, drawings of a flying car and the address of an acquaintance in New York, with whom he expected to spend the night. He asked the policeman for directions and walked to the famous Thomas Edison workshops on Herk Street-the whole world knew this address then. Nikola Tesla (it was, of course, him) flashed his knowledge of electrical engineering and the physics of electricity, so they took him to work at General Electric — as a locksmith for repairing electric motors and DC generators. In the Mecca of a new religion — direct current — he constantly told and explained to everyone the benefits of a completely different approach to generating electricity — alternating current. Edison argued with Tesla, who was slowly moving up the corporate ladder and already held the position of engineer. The tension between the inventors grew.

The rest is known from the stories of Tesla and Edison, each of whom insists on his own version. Nikola Tesla claimed that Edison promised him $50,000 (a huge sum, about $ 1 million in terms of today's purchasing power) for improving his company's devices. Nikola caught fire with the idea and presented 24 varieties of Edison's alternating current machine, a new switchboard and an improved regulator design. Edison accepted the invention, but did not pay the money, citing the fact that it was a joke, and whoever did not understand was to blame himself. Enraged, Nikola Tesla immediately quit, not appreciating Edison's sense of humor, and he later said that he simply did not raise the ambitious Serbian engineer's salary.

Thus began the great confrontation between Nikola Tesla and Thomas Edison. Tesla dreams of creating an alternating current generator before Edison, he works day and night to succeed — invents, looks for investors and like-minded people.

In 1886, Nikola digs ditches, ""sleeps where he has to and eats what he finds""

In 1887, the inventor created the Tesla Electric Company and began to engage in street lighting using his inventions and patents. In 1893, the company of Edison Westinghouse's competitor with Tesla won a tender (defeating General Electric) for the supply and installation of electrical equipment and lighting for the pavilion of the World's Fair in Chicago. During the grand opening, the US president pressed a button and turned on several hundred thousand electric lighting lamps, which turned, as the newspapers wrote, ""night into day.""

Thomas Edison was a knowledgeable scientist, a brilliant experimenter and a successful businessman, but the supporters of alternating current knew mathematics and physics and understood the weak point of his system — power loss in wires. Westinghouse and Tesla have learned to transmit current over long distances without loss of power. The widespread switch to cheaper alternating current meant Edison's financial collapse. He sues the courts, demanding a patent ban, and loses.

Then Edison engaged in the first black PR in history: New York newspapers came out with a huge photo of an elephant killed by a ""dangerous"" alternating current. Direct current was called ""safe"". But nothing could stop the victorious march of alternating current. Edison lost.

Nikola Tesla became rich. Now he could prove and show everyone what alternating current is and whether it is really safe. Tesla put on a show at the Chicago World's Fair. Standing in the center of the exhibition hall, he passed a current of two million volts through himself. Tesla was smiling, and an Edison light bulb was burning in his hand.

The crazy inventor

Tesla is possessed by strange, ingenious and at the same time crazy ideas. For example, he understands that the planet Earth itself is an ideal conductor of electricity and energy can be transmitted over distances through it. In 1891, at his laboratory in Colorado Springs (located in a zone of high geomagnetic activity) Tesla developed a huge transformer and received a voltage of several million volts of electric current. The tower at the top of his laboratory emitted lightning several tens of meters long. The earth sparkled. Sparks flew from the water taps. Butterflies glowed in the air.

In 1900, while experimenting at the Colorado Springs station, Nikola Tesla and his assistant tried to cause the phenomenon of electric resonance. They set exorbitant values on the devices, working at the limit of power. However, even the transformer of Tesla's design could not withstand such extremes and burned down. The inventor moves to New York. Banker Morgan proposes to Tesla to build a Worldwide wireless Transmission Center (telegraph); but Tesla does not offer a telegraph, but a wireless communication device around the world with the ability to communicate by voice, broadcast music, news, stock quotes and even transfer images. Does this remind us of something? The prototype of the Internet!

On the land allocated by Morgan, the construction of an unprecedented power plant, the Wardencliff project, begins, this is the Tesla tower for commercial transatlantic telephony, radio broadcasting and wireless transmission of electricity. Lightning strikes the sky again, newspapers say that the ocean is illuminated for thousands of miles.

Under pressure from Morgan, Tesla admitted that he was building a giant energy transmitter — perhaps to communicate with aliens. Funding is being cut.

Tesla will not receive any more large investments — he has compromised himself with senseless attempts to transfer energy over distances. In the following years, the inventor and scientist led a secluded lifestyle, lived in relative poverty, was afraid of germs, constantly washed his hands, arranged extravagant lectures similar to shows, became interested in mysticism, bred pigeons and invented strange things. In 1898, he launched a boat in the pond, which he controlled remotely.

In 1913, Nikola Tesla proposed an unprecedented way to search for submarines using high-frequency radio waves underwater and reflecting the response signal from the hulls of submarines. The idea was not implemented. Do you recognize it? It's a radar. It was re-invented in 1940.

In 1931, Tesla allegedly invented an electric car — without batteries and a battery, the car reached a speed of 150 km/h. When asked about energy, he replied: the car takes it from the ether that surrounds us. They laughed at him.

At the age of 72, Tesla patented a hybrid of an airplane and a helicopter. The car weighed 400 kilograms, could take off from any site and cost $ 1,000. The prototype was not built.

Rumors began to spread that Tesla had gone crazy. In the 1930s, he made a statement that he had invented a ""death ray"" that could destroy 1,000 aircraft at a distance of 400 km, and offered governments ""superweapons"" to prevent the onset of war. Strangely enough, the Soviet Union responded. In 1937, the inventor handed over to Amtorg, the representative of the USSR in the USA, the design of the apparatus for the ""death rays"" and received a check for $ 25,000 from the USSR. But the laser was not built.

""The records are speculative and speculative""

When the war broke out in Europe, Nikola Tesla worried about Yugoslavia, which was under occupation, and repeatedly appealed for peace. The Yugoslav ambassador to the United States (Tesla's nephew) was the last person to see him alive. Engineer and inventor Nikola Tesla died at the New Yorker Hotel on January 8, 1943, at the age of 87. The world is left with memories and discoveries — an induction (asynchronous) motor, a Tesla transformer, rules for working with high-frequency currents, electrical devices for medical research and hundreds of patents and ideas.

Tesla's inventions interested the US government only after the scientist's death. The FBI seized all his papers, and the head of the National Defense Committee, after studying them, concluded that ""the records are speculative and speculative, have a philosophical nature and do not imply methods of implementation.""

In 1958, the High-Tech Defense Research Agency (DARPA) implemented the top-secret Swing project at the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory. Many believe that the Americans built the ""death rays"".

But the story continues. After decades of oblivion, the scientist and inventor Nikola Tesla is being talked about again — his image adorns Serbian banknotes, and Belgrade Airport bears his name. In 2003, several inventors and entrepreneurs founded Tesla in the United States, a manufacturer of electric vehicles and solutions for energy storage, space flights and breakthrough innovations such as high—speed underground tunnels and other unprecedented technological wonders. The company was named after the world—famous electrical engineer and physicist Nikola Tesla, because in the history of science and technology his name has remained synonymous with progress and innovation.

1g8luh1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1g8luh1,Recent decant purchase and review,"Long awaited post on my end. 
This is a seller review however just want to give a heads up that I’ve become friends with this fellow redditor however the review is unbiased (or maybe I think so 😅)

I would like to start with the fact that I am a very choosy person when it comes to perfumes, most popular perfumes end up in my trash perfume list and I’m not a blind buyer.
I ALWAYS BUY DECANTS.
Then I met u/priyaaanshi through reddit who is just opposite and is a blind buy expert 😝.
I always wanted to try something “on the budget” with middle eastern perfumes.
I blind bought OG Yara, Yara tous and paris corner taskeen caramel cascade (horror), ended up declutterring last 2 and i realised I’m not a person who should blind buy.

Sooo after I saw Priyanshi’s decant list I straight up asked her to send me all the budget ones I should try from her collection sincr I needed something for regular not so fancy use, bang for buck type.

She sent me more than I asked for, some discontinued designers also which she gave 🥹
1. Packaging and glass bottles.
I know from the thought to decanting to everything, learning how to syringe decant and all sorts of brains that went behind finding the right guy for the decant bottles since Hey! I mentioned that we are friends 🙈
The bottles are amazing, i recently got multiple decants out of which I like Priyanshi ka bottle and atomisers the most. 
And they don’t leak. 

2. Review of the middle eastern ones I got:

A. The overhyped queen NEBRAS.

Tldr; it’s a pass for me
5/10.
I don’t get the hype, neither the cacao note. I get the synthetic vibr and berries and something smells cheap in here, turns out I was born do be fancy 😭. 
After multiple sniffing I understand why people might like it but I guess it’s not for me.
Smells like: Picture old unused lipstick which is cheap like a cheap cheap brand and is close to expiry. It smells like that to me idk why. 

B. Another overhyped: Badee al oud honor and glory:
Tldr; ugh straight NO 2/10
Same, I guess my nose is meant for refined stuff.
It smells arabic alcohol cheap stuff which troed to get the creme bruelle but the synthetic stuff is not going away. It’s something a colleague of mine wears and i don’t appreciate it. I didn’t even sniff it enough to get to the notes.

C. Modest deux : PASS
rating 6/10,
It is slightly better than the ones mentioned above. But same problem, i do get the synthetic ish vibes. I get patchouli not done well. 

D. Teriaq: interesting 
This one did interest me, at first sniff I was like nice and it reminded me of something I couldn’t put finger on.
But then it’s an OG creation and that too a new one, not a copy
I think it’s a good perfume to buy considering the price and quality, I won’t buy it since I don’t see mysef getting more JPG LA belle alikes, they are not similar but there are similar vibes.
Then it occured to me, it smells very very much similar to Naira by SungandhCo, if you are from Lucknow, do visit and check it out. Sugandhco Naira is like a a fraction of the price so Naira wins. 

E. Ahmed rose noir the WINNER
it’s the best of all. I like the blend, the longevity, bang for buck sorts.

1g8lqfs,https://www.reddit.com/r/wholefoods/comments/1g8lqfs/new_hire_worried_about_working_the_coffee_bar/,New hire worried about working the coffee bar,"Recently got hired at Whole Foods in the bakery department thanks to a relative who works in a different department. Everyone seems really nice, but I'm being trained on the coffee bar first. I've worked 3 shifts there so far and I'm a bit nervous. For context, I worked at Starbucks for a month in 2021. It was really overwhelming and the customers were quite rude, didn't have the best training, I was having panic attacks/vomiting before my shifts every other day, etc. so I quit. I was aware that I'd be working the coffee bar before I agreed to do bakery, but I didn't realize how small the bar would be and I didn't know you're meant to do it all alone (at our location, it's one barista at the bar Monday through Thursday, and two baristas Friday through Sunday since it gets busy on the weekends). My trainer is extremely nice and she's been patient with me so far, but admittedly I'm stressing out over the idea that I'm eventually meant to do all of that alone. I'm autistic so not the best when it comes to socializing with people, and I'm of course not going to quit but I have a feeling I'd probably be better working directly in the bakery department with other people instead of (eventually) working alone with no assistance at the coffee bar. I don't like feeling incompetent, especially at a new job, and it sucks being so useless; they steam milk at Whole Foods' coffee bar differently than they did at Starbucks or my old job (we literally just pressed a button to steam milk there) and it's been difficult for me to figure out. My trainer says steaming milk is the hardest thing to learn in the coffee bar but I'm worried she's starting to get annoyed with me for not getting it. And even if she's patient with me, sometimes customers aren't. In my past jobs, I've had the luxury of making food and drinks in the back where customers can't see me. It's a little unnerving that I'm so...exposed at the coffee bar and customers can see me making everything. I guess I'm just wondering if anyone has any tips/words of wisdom, whether in regard to improving my skills at the coffee bar or with the bakery department in general, their experience working coffee bar or bakery, etc. and if anyone has tips on how they steam milk I'd appreciate it. I was told I'd be trained at the coffee bar first and *then* they'd transition into training me in the bakery department, but I wish it was the other way around to be honest. ",1,1729503617.0,wholefoods,0,1.0,False

My ex and I only started dating a little over a month ago (but we had known each other for a few months prior, and only started talking a lot the month prior to becoming official). Everything was going fine throughout our relationship and we never even fought.

Although our schedules didn't really align we still had time to see each other a few times a week. I graduated university earlier this year so I work almost full time, however he is pursuing his master's so he studies full time with a part time job he does at night.

Suddenly, I got a text from him saying that things are too hard for him at the moment and between juggling his study and his job, he feels like he isn't being a good enough boyfriend to me and he feels sorry to me that he can't go on dates with me or reply to me all the time. He also felt that he might have rished into the relationship sonce he is finding it hard to juggle his study, job and being in a relationship. 

I told him that I know he's busy with studying so I totally don't mind that he doesn't reply that often and that I don't meed to go on dates because I'm happy just being together with him. But he told me no matter what, he doesn't want to make me wait around for him and it's going to be too difficult. This was a week ago.

Now a few nights ago I was drunk with my friends and in the same area that he lives in so I ended up calling him and asking if we could meet up and talk. He said he was studying but after he was done I could go see him. I told him that since my phone was running out of battery I'll just go wait in front of his house. After he came out we had a talk outside his house, basically the same as above and even though I told him I can wait, he said no. In this conversation he admitted that he still likes me but his situation is too difficult at the moment. After the conversation he asked me how I was getting home and I told him I was planning on getting an uber, so he told me that since I don't have battery, I could come inside and charge my phone then go.

We ended up just chilling like usual and I fell asleep at his house and left the next morning. During the night we both expressed that we still like each other and ended up agreeing to stay friends.

BUT I don't want to be just friends, I really like him. So basically, what I'm planning to do is wait until his exams are over in a few weeks and catching up with him for a coffee or something and then telling him that in these few weeks, that I still missed him a lot but despite that I wasn't waiting around and still had my things to do, so even if we continue to date, he won't have to feel bad towards me or guilty making me wait because I did the same thing for him now. Obviously I won't say it exactly like that, but something along those lines. I just want to know would this seem too desperate or even manipulative?

","When my husband and I first started dating, music really connected us. In a shared playlist that we were listening to together, I played Best Part by Daniel Caesar. He asked me to change the song because it was his song with his ex before me. 

When we had met, we were both out of really toxic relationships so I understood. 

Five years later, we're married and have a daughter on the way, and he's honestly the best- supportive, nurturing, kind, patient and understanding. Five years later, my Spotify played Best Part and all I'm reminded of is that he and his ex dedicated the song and it's lyrics to each other, and I feel so insecure. 

I wanna be the coffee that he needs in the morning, the sunshine in the rain when it's pouring. Idk if it's just the pregnancy hormones but is this something worth bringing up? I don't want him to think I doubt us and our relationship, when it's quite the opposite, I'm acknowledging that it's my insecurity but I can't help but need the reassurance that I'm his best part. 

What are the risks if I do bring it up?

1g8lp8c,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizoaffective/comments/1g8lp8c/a_delusion/,A Delusion,"Hi guys, my other account is Flashy Athlete. I'm experiencing a certain delusion. So as I'd mentioned before, I feel like I am connected to an entity or it lives inside me and it is basically punishing me. So another thing it does is related to what I consume. For example, if I eat sugar, it makes me mean. If I drink milk, it makes me either a cry baby or it makes me old and mean. For almost a year I'd skipped eggs, milk (sort off) and caffeine. Now I started drinking coffee again today. And in the past, it was that if I drink coffee I'll become angry and lazy. So today, after a year, I drank coffee, and I just had a horrible angry argument with my mother and I am sitting here feeling bad for myself. I even attempted to cut myself with a knife after she left but it didn't cut the skin and frankly I am too chicken shit to actually pierce the skin. It's almost funny, like an act, like I am aping the emo kids of the 2000s. I am angry and hurt and seething and sad, so very disappointed. I feel so unloved. But what my point is, my delusion came true - I drank coffee and became full of rage.

Do you think this is a coincidence?? Why did this happen?? I also stopped eating bread, watching Instagram, and a whole load of other stuff too, because whatever the entity said was coming true. 

I'm really angry right now, lol as angry as someone with blunted emotions can be. Angry and sad.

1g8lnp0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1g8lnp0/parisians_are_in_fact_extremely_rude_and_theyve/,"Parisians are in fact, extremely rude and they've turned me Karen","Before I moved to Paris a couple of years ago, I was a normal person. I was pleasant. I wasn't on high alert all the time. 

Shortly after moving here, my attitude has progressively declined because I have to deal with french people. Unfortunately, I was not able to hang onto my sweet nature, as each encounter with these moody lunatics has made me more and more like them. I am so mad at myself for this demise. 

Case in point, they do not know how to walk down the street, they yield for no one - not the elderly or mothers, injured etc - they walk directly into people (and me) everyday, all day long. If I move to the side, I swear they will move to the same side just to play sidewalk chicken. Eventually, I started doing the same shit. If they aren't going to move, I'm not going to either. They don't hold open doors for the next person, etc. It's relentless. The drivers of cars, motorbikes and bicycles are crazy. They have no respect for human life. They will drive so close and fast to people on narrow street sidewalks. They will act like they are going to hit you and I've seen them hit people before. It is unhinged behavior. I want to go ballistic on these people, but I hold myself back 95% of the time. 

In the grocery store, they give zero personal space. If they see someone coming down an aisle, they will not move until the person asks them to. They do not anticipate anyone else's movement and have no consideration for others. Of course, this isn't \*all\* french people in Paris, but it is certainly MOST of them. Don't be fooled. They have this reputation for a reason. The generalization of their rudeness is generally true. It is a pervasive cultural issue. They are also obsessed with having their dogs off leash. At least 50% of the dogs I see in Paris are off leash and have no business being off leash, are not properly trained and disturb others. Multiple times, I have gone into restaurants and coffee shops and seen dogs off leash inside these establishments. 

  
All of this to say, I am mad at myself for letting myself decline into this state where I am matching the energy of these people. I have even become some sort of ""Karen"" and I say things to people in the street like ""Hello!/Bonjour!"" right before they are about to run into me. A car nearly hit my dog in a crosswalk (I had the green) and I absolutely lost my shit, yelling at her through her car window ""You're going to effing kill someone, you psycho!!!"". It's not a harmless mistake.. it is the repetitive nature of not giving a shit about anyone else but themselves. I have started getting onto people with their dogs off leash ""Where is your leash?? Why are you in a cafe with a untrained dog without a leash? Have respect for other people!""  Aggressive, unsocialized dogs at cafes, growling and lunging towards people and the owner saying in french ""Oh he's nice"" and I'll just be like ""Really??? he seems SUPER DUPER nice, like he needs a muzzle."" 

They litter. I want to say ""Really? You're going to throw your trash on the ground??"". The men feel comfortable peeing on the street in broad daylight, I want to say ""You're disgusting. Find a bathroom, you lazy loser!!"" 

  
They do not care. I've gotten in more heated public exchanges here than in the rest of my life, all my years combined and they always push back. They are territorial, egotistical maniacs. There are many french people I adore, one on one, but I do feel almost like I'm going to battle every time I walk down the street. I've never felt this living in any other city, except maybe on occasion when french tourists were around. 

  
The other day I calmly (and kindly) told a guy.. you cannot ride your motorbike on the sidewalk and a french man came up behind me and told me to shut up. Maybe I am a big ass Karen now but I don't care. Don't ride your motorcycle on a closed, narrow sidewalk just because the road is closed for construction - go around - it's dangerous, you could hid a small child or elderly person... or perfectly healthy adult.. coming around the corner. 

  
There are so many things I love about living in Paris, but the people and lack of etiquette and sophistication just aren't included in that list.

1g8lmkw,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1g8lmkw/chronic_pain_gastritis_high_cholesterol/,"Chronic pain, Gastritis, High cholesterol, Respiratory issues - Connection?","Female (28), 163 cm, 68 kg. I have been struggling with multiple health issues for few years, and recently got diagnosed with high cholesterol (6.2) and gastritis (Heliobacter pylori, just started antibiotics and PPI). Ca. 2 years ago I also got respiratory issues for the first time, with periodic nose blockages and production of bright yellowish phlegm overnight. No known allergies. Also suffer from migraines with aura since age 8, ca. 1-4 per year and tension headaches. High suspicion of endometriosis as well. Family history has high blood pressure, heart attack, stroke and cancer.

My most disabling issue is a chronic pain in my right hand/arm (the muscle that contracts when index finger and thumb are pressed together) which was caused by occupational use of heavy machinery and vibrations (chainsaws, strimmers etc.). Went through multiple specialists and hand surgeons, MRIs of the hand, head, cervical and thoracic spine were done. Got an incidental diagnosis of a small syringomyelia on CS 5/6, but different radiologists have excluded a connection to the hand/arm pain, no nerve impairment, no other obvious findings. Likely muscles and tendons are the culprit from repetetive strain. The pain flares up whenever I use my hands for typing, painting, using a controller etc. Back and neck also frequently hurt, pains and stiffness under the shoulder blades reliably appear after doing any household work, like hoovering, sweeping, preparing food etc. Doing anything with my arms above hip height gets my ribs ""stuck"", and I need to crack them for relief.

The chronic pain is now only being managed for symptoms, with Ibuprofen and topical Etofenamate 5%. I suspect that the Ibuprofen may have contributed to the gastritis, along with periodic stress (mother died 2 years ago from glioblastoma, I was made redundant half a year ago) and large coffee and black tea consumption. Sleep quantity and quality are good. Had COVID in 2022. Since starting WFH I have unfortunately become very sedentary. 3 months ago I got my bloods done and had high cholesterol (6.1) and elevated levels of eosinophils, everything else normal. 

The cholesterol really surprised me, as I eat mostly whole foods, avoid processed foods, use fresh ingredients, spices and herbs, never smoked and don't drink alcohol. I did however enjoy certain processed meats (salami, sausages, bacon etc.) on occasion that I have since replaced with lean chicken, tofu and legumes. I also started working out at home (mat based exercises and weight lifting with 3.5 kg dumbbells) and slowly lost 2 kg while gaining muscle. I did a recent blood retest and despite the changes in diet and exercise, my cholesterol has gone **up** to 6.2. Shortly after these results the gastritis flared up for the first time.

I found a few medical studies that explore the correlation between H. pylori and low HDL/high LDL cholesterol, which made me wonder if this could be a factor behind my levels not going down, as would be expected. I am also wondering if the infection could be related to the respiratory issues, if it has been developing over a long period of time. 

Overall, I am worried that my body has so many issues at my age already, and that it may be subject to chronic inflammation despite a conscious diet and a moderate amount of exercise. I will try to eat even better and move more frequently, but is there anything else I can do?",1,1729503131.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

1g8llac,https://www.reddit.com/r/MuslimCorner/comments/1g8llac/insecure_about_my_husband_after_he_got_into_great/,Insecure about my husband after he got into great shape,"I (F29) scolded my husband (M42) about his weight and then he lost it.

In his 20s my husband was a 6-pack having fit athletic man. When we got married he hadn't been to the gym for a few years. For years I delicately alluded and hinted how good it would be if he started working out and eating healthy again. He kept slowly gaining weight and even though I hid it I was really getting worried for his health and embarrassed being out with him. He became excessively overweight, wearing oversized baggy clothes, sweating constantly at the mildest bit of movement. I think his waist was 40-42 inches. To top it off his chest became large and unmanly, thin arms, bloated upperbody, rolls on his back. He over ate everyday. 

I always said alhamdulilah that his face is very very very attractive and handsome. I was still attracted to him but due to his body it was seriously diminishing.

Anyway this January I hit rock bottom with it and let rip on my true feelings about it all. I was fuming after he ate 3 large doughnuts with 1 cup of coffee! I got in the car and drove to my parents to cool off. When I came back he wasn't home and I checked his location and he was at a gym! 

Overnight his mind and attitude flipped, he started eating clean and going to the gym everyday except on Fridays. I was amazed at his dramatic progress, even by February, then by around June he had lost many inches off the waist, arms much bigger, almost all the weight was gone and his whole body shape was noticeably strong (and much more attractive). 

He literally has not missed a gym session. We went to Malaysia and he consistently worked out in a gym there too.

Now in October he's looking incredible - I get deeply excited just being in his company. Everything he wears just fits perfectly.When he removes his tops there's nothing on planet earth for me but him. I can't describe how obsessed I have become over him. Our intimate life is out of this world. Alhamdulilah!! He is breathtaking morning day and night. Everyone from family and friends are complimenting him. His ego and attitude is unchanged he's still the man I married and love on the inside.

The problem I'm having is that I am now feeling very insecure and jealously protective when we're in public. I notice women looking at him inappropriately far too frequently in so many places we go. I'm actually worried other women will make moves on him and I completely trust my husband is faithful and will always be, but I don't trust other women at all anymore! And I feel they have no right to check him out urggh!!

I would crumble if he even looked at another woman and felt she's attractive, it'd shatter me into a million pieces.

Yesterday we were in a long line getting coffees, I stepped away to look for snacks and when my husband got to the counter I saw how the girl was interacting with him and looking at him and I felt like running over and standing between them immediately but I'm aware how crazy that is so managed to control myself. I just can't handle his eyes going near a pretty woman whether in public or on TV or social media!! However regretfully I argued with him for over hour about it afterwards because I was too full of insecurity I know that but then my mind wanders what about when he's out there without me!!

It's so odd thinking for most of our marriage I never had this problem but now it's consuming me. 

Any feedback or advice would be very welcome and thanks for reading ",2,1729502966.0,MuslimCorner,1,1.0,False

I just ended a long relationship and I’m feeling a bit lonely. 

I moved away from all my old friends and lost contact so hoping to make some new ones. 

I’m really interested in tv, animals, games and have a bit of a dark sense of humour. 

I find it hard to make new friends and am quite shy at first. Hoping to just find someone I can connect to and have a laugh. 

In my spare time I spend time with my son and animals. I like to go out to coffee shops and enjoy exploring and doing new things. I also spend a lot of time drawing playing games and watching tv. 

Would love to chat to any like minded people who share some interests with me. ",1,1729502911.0,makingfriends,0,1.0,False

(I don't use drugs much, I usually used chemicals once a year and that was about 3-4 times in the last 2 years, I'm not addicted, I don't want to give such a perspective, there were only times I used weed.) After this period, there were periods when I woke up 2-3 mornings with my head shaking quickly and had constant attacks. I really couldn't sit still, I was going to my internship, but even if I drank coffee, my heart would immediately race and I would have shortness of breath (The reason for this was because I had my first panic attack the next day and these symptoms were because I thought I was addicted to cocaine.) Then I experienced something like anxiety, I went into an intense 2-month depression and after a while (maybe I didn't notice it) but when I look at dark, black objects I constantly see tingling and it still continues, I know where I am and what I'm doing. I have never gone to psychiatry because the severe anxiety and numbness in my body have almost decreased since July. After thinking “Am I addicted to cocaine?” I then entered the period of “Am I psychologically ill?” and I read a lot of psychological illnesses on the internet. As I mentioned, most of my heart palpitations, shortness of breath and similar problems have decreased to a minimum, but there is a question mark in my head. I don’t feel any strangeness at home, but when I go outside, I go back and forth in a dilemma, wondering if the contrast of the colors has increased or if it’s just me. I know where I am, I know where I am, but now every time I look outside, I have a tic, I wonder if the colors are changing, whether it’s derealization or depersonalization, and every time I look, I feel that butterfly feeling in my stomach? Do you think I might be experiencing something like this or is there a problem with my eyes? It’s like the colors are 4K. Everything is so bright, what do you think about this? I thought about going to psychiatrist but I don't want to take medication because I can continue my life, I can watch my series and movies alone, spend time and laugh with my friends. I'm not actually unhappy but thinking about this every time I go out bothers me a little. Could it be that my sensitivity to light has increased? I had a very stressful period for 2-3 months but I think I can handle it mentally without using serious medication since October.

1g8li3s,https://www.reddit.com/r/superautomatic/comments/1g8li3s/please_help_me_justify_buying_a_superautomatic/,Please help me justify buying a superautomatic,"Hey coffee aficionados,

I need advice on whether or not to get a superautomatic coffee machine.

My current setup is a [Keurig](https://a.co/d/5X14sI3) using [reusable pods](https://a.co/d/fRp1MK2) and [pod filters](https://a.co/d/8C6Sd1P) filled to the brim with [pre-ground Kirkland Colombian](https://www.costco.com/kirkland-signature-100%25-colombian-coffee%2C-dark-roast%2C-3-lbs.product.100361434.html), which is glorious when fresh. My perfect cup is 4 parts drip coffee, 1 part [half-and-half](https://www.kingsoopers.com/p/kroger-half-half/0001111010010). I'm in Denver, Colorado (high altitude, dry climate).

My big issue is the ground coffee going stale.

I've read that grinding beans on-demand, even older ones, is better than using semi-old pre-ground coffee. I'm also under the impression that finer grains yield a bolder flavor (pre-ground Kirkland isn't very fine).

Worth noting: I can't be bothered to put in a lot of effort into making coffee as I'm an utterly useless little bitch in the mornings and can't form a single coherent thought before I finish my first cup. Convenience and ease-of-use is a big factor in making this decision.

Given all this, investing in a superautomatic could be a solution. However, the initial cost is high, and there's a risk it might not provide a return on investment as the coffee quality may not justify the expense.

My other options are:

1 - Disposable k-cups (costly and wasteful, but each pod would be fresh).

2 - Buy pre-ground coffee in smaller batches (not as costly or wasteful as k-cups).

3 - Vacuum-seal a week's worth of coffee per bag and freeze them.

4 - Continue with stale coffee and save my money.

If I go for a superautomatic, it'd have to meet two requirements:

1 - Intake for a water line or a water tank that could fit a [jerry-rigged float valve](https://a.co/d/baXiFXf).

2 - Can dispense a 10oz cup with caffeine concentration similar to drip coffee.

My budget is around $500, though I could be convinced to go higher for long-term savings.

Any advice on whether the superautomatic is worth it? Are my requirements reasonable, or should I consider the other options? My biggest fear is that I'll buy a superautomatic and, after a month of using it, I'll be drinking my 75th cup and think ""man, this wasn't worth the $500"".",3,1729502556.0,superautomatic,7,0.8,False
1g8lhyf,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/1g8lhyf/why_are_people_like_this/,Why are people like this?,"So.. short introduction: I am a gay guy in my 30s that grew up in a Mediterranean country. I had this dream since I was a teen that I would move out of my conservative country and live in the Netherlands in peace, maybe meet a nice guy, maybe I won't have to hide my love and my gayness, maybe live in a small 2 room apartment, have some friends, an okay job in order to pay my bills and visit my family once per year. Nothing fancy, or dreaming big. I just want to live my life being happy.  
  
This is my second year in a smaller city, not far from Amsterdam. Living with my best friend (now ex best friend?) and her husband. I haven't felt more lonely in my life. And I cannot understand why everything has gone so wrong! 

People here live in ridiculously expensive glorified shitholes, no actual insulation (even though it's constantly windy and rainy), narrow dangerous wooden stairs, single glass windows, really old cracked beams supporting the walls, rats in houses, restaurants and stores, the food is so sad, the weather even sadder, the beaches are super sad, people are under-stimulating and low-key racist, disconnected from the rest of the world, a lot of my colleagues/neighbors are on medication and therapy but drinking beers till dawn.. And finally.. ""Doe het normaal"" and Calvinism. UGH!

I plan to go back to my home country. But then what? At least here I feel safe as a gay guy. But is this enough? I have no BF, friends or family, or any sense of community. People treat me since day 1 as some short of exotic bird. There are so many people who know me and greet me on the street, but whenever I try to meet for coffee, or a drink, or just for a walk at the park, I get positive answers and we never meet! A lot of guys wanna have sex with me, but it's mostly couples and guys into casual NSA sex. 

Even my best friend has changed. She and her husband are just working, having sex and smoking weed. She is emotionally unavailable. The house is always a mess and dirty. She doesn't participate in house chores. We are not doing anything together anymore. I thought I was the one at fault, but she admitted that she likes her new life and the way she is now.

Before moving in here, they used to say that I would love this house, the city, the country. They invited me to work at the same job they work at, and I did. I was so excited at first. But our boss was also the landlord. A horrible, fake, mentally unstable woman, manipulative, hiding behind the ""Dutch directness"" thing, while she is just a racist prick. I left that place (along with many other colleagues), but she effed up my head so much. She fully took advantage of the fact that I am an immigrant. She was always messing with my schedule last moment, I had to cancel plans and effed my almost non-existent social life, she was threatening me, asking me really personal questions, abusing me at work, always complaining about how expensive I was (minimum salary, doing the work of 3 different people) and would never let me eat lunch in peace...  Everything happening in front of the customers, which makes me wonder ""why do people support this kind of business?""

After visiting my folks back home, I felt so refreshed, my social battery recharged, managed to relax and start eating food ( I lost too much weight). But I know my home country and I vividly remember the reasons that forced me to leave; Homophobia, femicides, governmental corruption, heavy pollution, job market, overtourism. Now I am looking for another job, in order to get some money and move out, but I get replies only from horeca. I could always try another European country, but let's face it.. Europe is failing and it will only get worse.. 

Why are people like this? I do get that every place has its pros and cons, but why are people like this?  
I just wanted to improve my life and have fun with others.

If you managed to read my post, thank you for your patience. ",1,1729502536.0,rant,1,1.0,False
1g8lhlq,https://www.reddit.com/r/CheatedOn/comments/1g8lhlq/does_it_get_easier/,Does it get easier?,"My ex that cheated on me was perfect.

He knew exactly how to make and keep me happy, he genuinely was perfect and my best friend. I loved his company, talking with him was something I could do for hours, we were good together we have great natural chemistry, in public and in private. He knew what food to get me from any place, my favorite coffee to bring me when I was sad, we had our favorite date nights, a specific coffee shop and restaurant we would visit every time. Things were perfect, we always talked, I loved talking to him, he'd listen to me everyday, all day. We even had our ""classic"" order we'd get every time, he was my best friend before anything I miss him so much. He claimed that I will be his only girl, he says he wants to give up on love after he hurt me so bad, that he could never forgive himself, and I dont know what to do or feel. That is my best friend and I still love him but he hurt me ? But I want him to be happy ? But at the same time I dont? 

He knew exactly how to hold me and comfort me, I genuinely thought that we would be it. I loved him so so much, I wanted to give him everything, I did everything and anything he asked, and he was never ungrateful, never truly hurtful or mean to me, he really took care of me and then this happens ? 

He would give me anything I wanted, he genuinely made me so happy, there was nothing wrong, it was perfect but then I just had to go through his phone... 

Sometimes I wish I just never said anything, but I dont want to be happy and lied to my whole relationship. 

I dont know what to do and how to get over him, I have nobody anymore. Im so alone. If he was all that I ever wanted, how will I ever find that love again? Is it possible? Should I just give him another chance if he wants or will he continue doing what he does? We broke up like a week ago and he tries to email me but, I ruined it by emailing back and being snarky, he hasn't talked to me since Wednesday. ",1,1729502489.0,CheatedOn,0,1.0,False

Anyway she served me the best coffee I’ve ever had, and we exchanged a few words.

The bookshop was still there, but when I asked the owner about the café, they looked at me like I was crazy and said there’d never been a café there.

I’ve been open about my issues to them in the past..maybe they forgot about it or don’t think anything too serious of it because maybe they don’t fully understand it. I’ve told them other times like my last birthday when they posted ugly photos of me wishing me in their story happy birthday and I immediately got a severe panic attack and messaged them to please delete it and that I’m not comfortable. I don’t know why they are so set on doing it this year too. My birthday is next month and they hinted bluntly that they will do it again and I kind of jokingly tried to tell them not to, trying not to make it too serious than it needs to be, but they brushed me off. I feel really bad considering they’re only wishing me a happy birthday, but I’d like to enjoy my birthday without any severe panic attacks. How do I tell them kindly?

I’m writing for any advise from experience or things you may know (if you are physicians). 
Mostly I’m looking for combination of medicine or movements to help me feel a bit better that worked for you. 

Backstory: Saturday I tried to move our small coffee table and I hurt my back. It’s something I’m aware as an issue as I had it again this severe 5 years ago. Horrible pain, barely can stand and walk. 

As I had it before I remember the advise from the doctor (back then in Greece) and trying to keep it active and keep a proper posture to relax it, but I’m very much in pain and uncomfortable. 

I called the huisartsenpost (weekend) and they told me to take a combo of paracetamol, ibuprofen and tramadol and to contact my GP. 

The combo is not really effective or at least it’s helping very little as I don’t see much progress. 

The assistant said that my GP has an appointment earliest on Wednesday (it is what it is) and prescribed more tramadol. 
They also mentioned Physio but after a call with them they said they cannot do much at this stage, so I need to wait at least 5 for the worst part to pass. 

So anything that maybe worth suggesting while I wait will be much appreciated…
Sorry for the long post. 

P.S. I searched a bit on the internet (Reddit included) but it’s more how to strengthen your muscles rather on how to pass the difficult first days. ",0,1729501593.0,Netherlands,16,0.5,False

My name's Brian from the Netherlands. Currently, I'm working towards a bachelor degree majoring in communication and work a little on the side at a webshop, but that that's boring, so enough about that. I like gaming on my Switch, PC and PlayStation and I do a teeny tiny bit of photography and sketching when I get inspired. The sketching I do both on paper with pencils and digitally using a pen display. I usually also watch sci-fi/fantasy series and movies, and on occasion animated shows (like anime or western animation). I'm very introverted and be a bit shy until I get comfortable talking to you.

I'm looking for someone about my age that is also looking for a serious long term relationship. While I have little to no prior experience with relationships, I do value strong connections and want to build a special and even stronger one. The superficial stuff like what color your hair is or what clothes you wear or whatever aren't deal-breakers for me. Only your personality is all I'm in for! And the rest, we'll figure out as we go! While I'm not against an LDR, I prefer someone who lives nearby (nearby = Netherlands/Belgium/UK/Germany), but it's not an issue if you live farther away. It's not a problem for me if the distance between us is big. Because if the spark is there, then no distance will be too great. Of course, I'm open to just being friends too, but that's if we end up not being compatible as more.

She's a typical chinita, maputi tapos short hair. We basically chat everyday, sobrang magkavibes kami kapag nag uusap, yung tipong non-stop convo. We always share memes and vids for good vibes, and we keep each other updated.

As a guy, ako yung nag iinitiate lagi ng conversation namin. I'm always consistent and make sure to reciprocate in our chats. Fast forward, we've become really wholesome together, to the point na na-attached na ako sa kanya. We're both single pero she's not ready for commitment yet daw. Minsan nagpupuyat pa ako para lang makausap ko siya while she's on duty.

Two days ago, niyaya ko siya makipag date, and she agreed naman. I picked her up near her house. We talked in the car while papunta sa destination namin para mawala yung awkwardness and played some music to set the mood right, I wanted her to feel comfy.

I treated her sa simple resto, then nag-coffee after, talked about sa life, shared some laughs, took pictures, strolled around. I even surprised her with a flower pa nga before taking her home. Abot langit pa nga yung ngiti niya parang wala nang mga mata eh. She said na may next date pa. Sobrang saya sa feeling na makipag date ulit. I'd say this one was a success!

After that, she messaged me. She really had a ""great"" time and thanked me. Wow great daw! I sent her a thank you and goodnight msg too kasi she needs to rest and sleep na, since late na kami nakauwi.

Kinabukasan, ako naman 'tong nangamusta ganito ganyan. Napansin ko parang ang cold na niya. She had a lot of reasons, kesyo wala raw internet connection sa house nila, mag reply daw siya once nasa duty na, then nung nasa duty na I know weak signal kaya di rin siya masyado makapagmessage. May mga questions ako sa kanya that time, I can wait for hours kasi alam ko sobrang busy niya. Active siya mag kwento and response before, but naging dry na kahapon.

Then today, I found out na naka blocked na ako sa lahat ng soc meds nya. Like, what the actual f*ck?! Why?!! May nagawa ba akong mali? Masama? Bakit ganun? Aabot talaga sa point na hindi ko na siya ma-reach out? I always told her that I appreciate and respect her a lot, I cared for her. But now, I feel disrespected and disappointed sa ginawa niya, na-trauma ako.

Kung mabasa mo 'to, gusto ko malaman yung reason bakit mo ginawa 'to sakin. Oo, may ""Great Wall"" ka pero gaano ba kahirap magpaalam nang maayos? Ikakamatay mo ba 'yon? Nakikinig naman ako sa lahat ng sinasabi mo diba. Hindi ba tinuro sa'yo yung GMRC? Sarap mong ibalik sa grade 1 eh. Nang block ka na nga, nagmukha ka PANG ghost sa paningin ko. Nasayang effort and oras ko. Tangina naman oh!

Sobrang sakit lang kasi ikaw nagpapangiti sa akin simula nung nakilala kita. You were one of my inspirations, but now you're just an expiration.

Ang hirap, nakakapagod kumilala ng tao tapos biglang mawawala na parang bula. May mga ganito pa rin talaga na akala mo sobrang bait at matino pero sa dulo tatratuhin kang gago. Yung edukado ka pa naman, ang ganda ng pinag-aralan mo, profession mo, pero basura pala ugali mo. Ako naman ang magsasabing isang malaking EWWWW sa'yo.

Proud ka pa sa repost mong ""Gustong gusto ko yung feeling na may nabubwisit kang mga tao. It feels good, sobrang nakakasatisfy. Very good for my mental health."" HAHAHAHA okaay?? What? Ayos ka lang ba? Bossing! Paki check naman ng utak neto may ubo. No wonder, na kwento mo marami ka nang naka date, hobby mo na pala ang manloko. Ang lala mo. Ginood time mo lang ako, b*llshit!

1g8l6u9,https://i.redd.it/6pg649usq2wd1.jpeg,Is there any deity associated with cats?,"Hello, I'm sorry if this is silly question. I recently started to be more active in prayer, offerings and just general worship in Hellenism to some deities. This morning I didn't feel up to the day since I have two lectures which I'm having some struggles in. This morning I decided to go get coffee when I was greeted by a black and white cat (I have included a photo of them) on a bridge I use to get to uni. The cat was incredibly friendly to the point when I knelt down they climbed in my lap and started purring and curling up on my lap and shoving their face between my arm and body. This has helped me. I was wondering if this could be some sort of deity sending a sign the day will be okay or something similar since I'm still fairly new to this. Any information would be greatly appreciated ",3,1729501126.0,Hellenism,3,0.8,False

Hello everyone. I got myself this machine to upgrade from the moka. 

I spent a few days researching and i have some doubts. 

Is it possible for me to upgrade the baskets to non pressurised ones without upgrading the portafilter? Or would i be better off upgrading to a bottomless portafilter and adding a puck screen? 


I am wondering this because this machine has no pressure control, so i’d be using a bottomless portafilter or a stock portafilter with non pressurised baskets, on a machine intended to work at a fixed pressure. 

I am aware of how important it is to grind properly the coffee (fine for this machine if i were to use a bottomless portafilter or non pressurised basket in the stock filter), and i believe i know how important it is to use the dwt tool + puck press.

1g8l2gq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rings_Of_Power/comments/1g8l2gq/lets_talk_about_sauron_in_this_season_of_the/,Let's talk about Sauron in this season of The Rings of Power,"

Okay, the season starts with Sauron giving a speech trying to convince the orcs that he should be their leader. First of all, this concept is ridiculous. Sauron is not some small-town colonel; he wasn’t the intern bringing coffee to Morgoth. He is Mairon, the strongest of the Maiar. The Istari are scared to confront him in direct conflict; he doesn’t need to negotiate with the orcs—he commands, and they obey. If they don’t, he could destroy an orc with a sneeze.

But fine, the season begins with Sauron holding a rally for the orcs, who don’t seem to like him very much. Then ONE orc tries to kill Sauron, and he kills the orc in front of everyone, which doesn't help his reputation with the orcs.

Then Sauron, being very clever, asks to be crowned with Morgoth's Crown by Adar, a guy who he knows hates him. After an assassination attempt where no other orc tried to intervene, Sauron doesn’t suspect they’re going to pull a Julius Caesar on him.

So Sauron kneels before Adar to be crowned, even though someone as megalomaniacal as Sauron would probably self-crown like Napoleon. Then Adar stabs Sauron with Morgoth's crown, which shouldn’t even be there since it was thrown into the void of the universe along with Morgoth.

Then the orcs stab Sauron repeatedly, and he turns into a kind of black tar sludge that absorbs a rat and drags itself around since Adar didn’t bother to check if the bum was actually dead. Then Sauron absorbs some random guy in a cart and becomes Halbrand. Note that it’s unclear whether months, weeks, or years have passed.

Then, Sauron/Halbrand walks to the Southlands, which is thousands of kilometers away from where he was, and he bumps into an old man with a necklace that belonged to the Kings of the Southlands—how convenient! This necklace is somehow common knowledge that it was from the Kings of the Southlands, as in the first season everyone assumes Halbrand is the king of the Southlands purely because of the necklace.

Anyway, Sauron takes a little boat to Númenor with a group of immigrants, even though it was already shown that the Númenoreans hate immigrants. The boat capsizes, Sauron steals the old man’s necklace, and conveniently finds Galadriel in the middle of the sea.

Now, in the second season, Sauron arrives in Mordor and tells Adar that Sauron is in Eregion. Adar is like, ""Okay, go check it out,"" and Sauron says, ""Okay, I’ll go check and let you know."" Then Sauron travels from Mordor to Eregion, which is on the other side of the world, in the blink of an eye.

Sauron arrives in Eregion as Halbrand, and instead of simply sending guards to grab the bum by the legs and drag him out, Celebrimbor leaves him in the rain. Earlier, Galadriel told him not to make deals with him, but she didn’t say why, as she didn’t want to admit that she brought Sauron to the elf kingdom and basically opened her elf legs for him.

So fine, Sauron becomes Annatar, makes some rings for the dwarves, and King Durin of Khazad-dûm goes crazy. He starts taxing all products by 100% because of the ring, digs deeper, and ends up finding a Balrog. Sauron knew this would happen and that it could potentially unleash a Balrog into the world, losing one of the rings and the source of Mithril to make more rings. So why did he do this? I don’t know.

Alright, then Adar, who marched his army of orcs from Mordor to Eregion without anyone noticing, arrives and starts attacking the city. Sauron traps Celebrimbor in an illusion, where it’s implied that time passes differently since Celebrimbor forges the Nine Rings of Men in a short time. So unless weeks have passed inside there, he forged them in about two days using Sauron’s Black Blood instead of Mithril.

But if Sauron can create a pocket dimension where time passes differently, why didn’t he offer this to Celebrimbor right from the start, avoiding this nonsense of threatening to destroy Eregion to make him forge the rings? If he has such OP powers, why doesn’t he use them more often? How did he die to the orcs at the beginning of the season? He could have just told Celebrimbor that he could make a Dragon Ball Time Room so he could forge the Rings with all the time in the world instead of forcing him to forge quickly under pressure while his city is under siege.

Who wrote this crap?

Oh, just one tangent: at the end of the season, King Durin dies fighting the Balrog, and the Balrog just... I don’t know, goes back to sleep? Because the dwarves send an army to help in Eregion. Was the Balrog introverted? It killed the King and then said, ""Okay guys, I’m going to sleep down here, alright?""",22,1729500559.0,Rings_Of_Power,6,0.96,False

I’ve noticed that while people love to hang out in cafes, relax, and chat over a cup of coffee, in QSR chains, most customers seem to prefer takeout rather than dining in. I understand that QSRs are generally geared towards takeaway, but casual dining is an option too, right? Yet, I don't see many people opting for it.

My parents are originally from Africa, but they live in the UK and have had children here. So they used corporal punishment for a while in our childhood (ages 0-14) for me and my siblings. 

It would either be a smack if we ever did something wrong, or in “extreme” cases—whatever they deemed extreme, they would use an object like a belt or stick for example.

I’ve talked to other black people, and this culture is quite common for African households. However, I will never know the extent of their parents punishments or how far is too far. Though, I remember finding punishment like grounding and sitting on the steps told to me by British or other black kids, laughable “lesser” punishments. Though our parents used these punishments all the same. 

Other punishments include telling us to get on our knees, for short periods of time (though, if I even remember correctly it ranged somewhere between five minutes to fifteen). They pushed one of my siblings down the stairs, as they recall. They gave her a bruise and told her not to tell anyone. 

They usually used smacking for disobedience, getting instructions wrong or bad behaviour. Though, they sometimes felt a smack was justified for minor grievances, mostly things that annoyed them specifically. 

When we ask them why they smack us as punishment, they just said because it was how they were raised and it ultimately is an act of “love.” 

I am referring to all this in past tense because they no longer hit us because I guess they consider it to no longer be useful? I’m 19 now. They still threaten smacking, and it’s practically a once in the blue moon thing. I used to feel stupid saying anything about it because I felt like other people had worse things happen. 

All this to say I am only now realising how fucked it all is. ",3,1729499504.0,africanparents,0,0.81,False

I was just listening to his bullshit.

First of all he earns way more than me I earn 15LPA and he earns 30LPA. He started talking finances then he expected us to split expenses equally which I disagreed, told that he plans to live in lavish flat and rent and expenses will take half my salary so if are going to equally split, we should downgrade the lifestyle which he told I don't needed to save.

He told he doesn't believe in dowry so we will split equally to buy home stuff and car that also will take major chunk of my savings and I would left eith literally nothing. Then we ordered few things to eat, first if all he was skeptical to decide any place so I told him blue tokai. Now the coffee place is nominally expensive according to Bangalore then also he started cribbing that everything is so expensive and this is why he likes street food, I also love street food but then where are we suppose to talk, standing near thela or what?

When bill came I told him we should split and I paid because I had gpay open. It's been 2 days then he asked me bill amount and bill picture so he would divide for what he ate. I got pissed and I told it's on me.

Finally I had to reject anyway but he made it so easy. While talking to him I observed he wanted everything equal but wasn't mentioning what he will contribute as in household work, child care nothing. These men only want equal where it benefits them.

It's been amazing, probably the best computer I've owned, but today I accidentally dropped it when taking coffee. The computer still works but unfortunately I now see dark spots in the bottom of the screen.

1g8kp9y,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1g8kp9y/how_to_get_the_least_bitter_most_sweetest_brews/,"How to get the least bitter, most sweetest brews?","Hi there, I'm working with a Kingrinder K2 and 1zpresso JX Pro (same burr) on an AeroPress and a V60. I use bottled water (Volvic and Black Forest) since we don't have foodsafe distilled water here. Slow feed always. 

No matter the grind size, brew time, ratio or temperature, I am consistently getting a bitter note on the back of my tongue that is simply too strong too enjoy the brews fully. Also I would like to get more sweetness and flavour out of my brews.

Now, what would you do to get the least bitter, most sweet cups you can? What would your general approach be?

Also, since we're here, what affordable grinder could you recommend to me to get sweeter, less bitter cups? I'm eyeing the Q2 hepta, Ode Gen 2, Kindgrinder P2/K6, ZP6.

Additional info: I have brewed different coffees from small roasters in Germany. I think that at least one of them is very able and very immersed in coffee culture. He offers various processes (picked up on some valerian notes in one of his bags). My current bag of beans is from Plum Kaffee, which is apparently the oldest roaster in Germany. I think most of them were washed coffees.

With the V60 I have tried both single pour (Tales coffee) as well as multi-pour brews. Bloom phase usually around 30-60 seconds, brew times between 2 and 4 minutes. Ratio between 1:15 and 1:17 probably.

With the Aeropress I went from 1:10 to 1:18 ratios and brew times ranging from 2-5 minutes probably. (I should get a scale with a timer.) Both single pour as well as multi-pour brews.

Temperatures between... 85-100°C. 

The thing is, even when I lower extraction and get noticeably sour notes, I still a significant bitter sensation at the back of my tongue. I did sensory training in my job and can definitely tell the difference between sour/bitter.

A part of me if thinking that pourover might just not be for me, which makes me hesitant to invest into an expensive grinder. On the other hand, a more expensive grinder might actually alleviate this issue for me. It's kind of a dead-end.

I have tried pourovers in cafés, one of which was probably using an EK43, V60 and 4-5 minute brew time. It was hardly bitter at all and more enjoyable and nuanced.",5,1729498788.0,pourover,6,1.0,False
