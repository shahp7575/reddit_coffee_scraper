1m7gneo,https://i.redd.it/h65ubgl2znef1.jpeg,Adding Cabinets to Small Kitchen (Feasibility/Recommendations),"Good Afternoon All,

Looking to get some input on our proposed cabinet addition to our kitchen. Our goal is to increase the usable/workable space and storage in the kitchen without creating circulation issues or make it feeling really cramped. The effective usable space from the stair half-wall to the plan east wall is \~15'-6 x 12'-6""W so not a crazy amount of usable countertop space except for in the corner.

Thinking of adding the cabinets in red. (1) 18""W x 24""D pantry, and (2) 30""Wx15""D base cabinets w/ accompanying (2) 30"" x 12""D wall cabinets above a countertop that will primarily be used as a coffee-bar and appliance garage. The base cabinet storage can be used for back-stock and less commonly used pans/crock-pot/dutch-oven, etc. Hoping that the 15""D base cabinets will help prevent the space from getting too cramped.

Worried that with the recommended 36"" offset from the edge of the table we're already encroaching on the circulation between the plan south breezeway door and the plan north opening to the living room. At one point, we considered putting in a fixed island that would double as a food-prep station and seating... but thought that would decrease the flexibility and create more circulation issues that it solves.

Open to other suggestions or just what you've experienced with a similar installation. Thanks! ",1,1753294327.0,kitchenremodel,0,1.0,False

The waitress smiles with her baby blue eyes and blonde hair. Everything reminds me of her.

‚ÄúYour usual spot, Ben?‚Äù she asks. 

‚ÄúPlease.‚Äù

Tucked away in the corner of a small countryside diner, a booth with the perfect view of a small patch of pine trees. It‚Äôs her favorite spot.

I sit. The wood from the booth shifts and creaks of age.

‚ÄúWould you like anything to drink while you wait?‚Äù 

‚ÄúA coffee and an orange juice.‚Äù

‚ÄúAlright, anything else?‚Äù 

I shake my head. She sets the two drinks in front of me.

Coffee is bold and bitter. Orange juice is tart and sweet. Together, it‚Äôs a perfect pair, their smooth poignant aroma floats in the air‚Äîbitterness and brightness side by side.

The sun beams through the window eliminating the steam from the coffee. It's a warm embrace like her winter sweater against my skin. 

Summer is her favorite. Winter is mine. She loves the scent of fresh flowers blooming in the open fields. All I see is the pesky mosquitoes nagging at my legs. 

We are different. Some people would say we are too different, but I say we are perfect in our differences. 

The Bluebirds flutter in the trees as they did that morning. Their beautiful blue wings shine as bright as the soft glow of her eyes. 

They puff out their golden brown chests as they sing into the morning sky. Brown and blue. Two different colors coming together to make the bluebird. 

I hated them once. Now, I watch them each morning, hoping they‚Äôll carry something back. 

I reach for my black bag by my feet. The soft wooden frame brushes against my hand. 
I lift it and place it so her smile meets me again. 

‚ÄúHappy birthday, my love,‚Äù I say, my voice cracking as I hold back the tears. I try to match her unwavering glow. The bright blue to my brown. The sweet to my bitter. The warm to my cold.

1m7glfa,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1m7glfa/i_24f_hung_out_and_slept_with_my_colleague_30m_he/,I (24f) hung out and slept with my colleague (30m). He doesn't want a relationship. What to do and how to move on?,"Let me start off that I (24f) have been working for this company for a while, but only a few months ago have I been working closer with my colleague (30m). I liked him from the very beginning and working together only improved that feeling. During lunch breaks and after work we hung out a few times and things clicked between us. We had a lot in common and I really liked his presence.

Due to the summer holidays (2 weeks), we hung out again Friday afternoon as it was our last day. It was a one on one time drinking as other colleagues already had made other plans. We had a great time and he mentioned having no plans during this break. After going home and me also not having plans, I decided to ask him on Sunday to hang out again together. We checked and scheduled something in immediately for the day after. 

Originally he came up with ideas of going to the movie theatre and having lunch together. I didn't feel like a movie, so I offered to go bowling instead. He mentioned not being good at it, but neither was I and I casually mentioned that I am good at it with the Wii. So he offers we organise lunch at his place and play the wii in the afternoon.

Monday, the next day, comes around and his apartment was super clean and smelled great. He also smelled great as he had just come out of his shower. He had prepared the food already with lots of appetizers first. He even opened a bottle of champagne! So after the appetizers and the food, we spent the whole afternoon playing on the Wii. Once we got bored with that we played some other games on his computer.

Now here comes the part where I am struggling to understand. It was starting to become late and it was raining. So I mention I better go home. He tries to hold me back and says ""oh it will stop raining around 10pm. Maybe you should leave then."" Now at this point we had some appetizers as dinner and we had started chatting more instead of playing games.¬†

As the topic of feelings comes around, I confess to having feelings and being into him from the very beginning. But the fact that we are colleagues held me back to take it that step further. After which he replies there are plenty of cases where colleagues do become a couple with no issues and he mentions he also has feelings for me.. We hug and talk more and decided to become exclusive to each other and have a relationship.¬†After which he offers I stay the night. Now mind you I didn't prepare to stay the night. He offered I wear some of his pyjamas and that he has a big bed we can share.

So after cuddling in the couch, we go to bed and the whole cuddling leads to sex. Also because his pyjamas were too big, which made me warm and uncomfortable to sleep. What really surprised me here too, was that he had shaved, the sheets were freshly washed and when I mentioned it, he casually said he was prepared for everything. He had even bought a new pack of condoms!

The morning after was very casual. He made coffee and I had some cereal. We talked more, kissed and cuddled and nothing seemed strange. I ended up getting back into my clothes from the day before, taking all my stuff and headed home. He even walked me back to my car.

I was over the moon with how things had played out. I couldn't believe that we were now a thing, but that feeling was shortlived. 2 hours after I got home, he called me saying ""I think we are going too fast"".

He mentioned that being in a relationship scares him cause he has been single for so long and doesn't feel like he can have a deeper connection with someone. I was devastated. He says we were just colleagues recently and that suddenly being exclusive was too much for him. I offered to go back to being friends, but he doesn't want that.

He wants to erase Monday and act like it never happened. He doesn't want to talk to me or see me. I will only see him again on August 4th. I can definitely act like nothing happened, but I am hurt. I feel used. I am scared.¬†

How do I deal with this situation? How do I move forward?

I feel like he had prepared this day finely into the deepest details and afterwards he backs out? Couldn't he have decided to not want to be in a relationship before I headed there? Why did he confess his feelings?

I feel like I should've just gone home and not stay the night. But it is too late now..

TL;DR: Hung out with my colleague who had prepared a date into the finest details. We confess feelings, decide to be exclusive. I stay the night, had sex and the following morning, 2 hours after I got home, he calls me saying he doesn't want a relationship. Neither does he want to see or hear me.

1m7gj19,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1m7gj19/i_forgave_her_i_stayed_i_fought_but_in_the_end_i/,"I forgave her, I stayed, I fought ‚Äî but in the end, I was still the one left behind","my ldr gf asked for my permission to go out for a class practice with her group, and I trusted her. Everything checked out - they were at one of her classmate's houses. While waiting for the practice to start, she said they were just hanging out casually in the living room.

She was sitting on the sofa, chatting over coffee with some of her friends. One of her close guy friends asked to borrow her charger, and while adjusting it for her, he suddenly wrapped his arm behind her shoulders. According to her, it felt normal at first because that kind of closeness wasn't new to her circle - they're a playful, touchy group in a mostly platonic way.

But then it got uncomfortable - his hand ended up in a place it shouldn't have been. She said they both froze for a second, maybe confused or trying to brush it off. But once she realized something was clearly wrong, she pushed him off. One of their other guy friends apparently saw it happen and kicked the guy to stop him.

After their practice, they were resting. My girlfriend is naturally loud, energetic, and playful - she tends to bounce around and joke with people, and that day was no different. The owner of the house told the ""couples"" in their group to rest inside the room. My girlfriend followed, not as part of a couple, but just to mess around and third-wheel, which she says is normal for her and the group.

Then that same guy followed them into the room. The lights were turned off, and my girlfriend told them to turn the lights back on because she was getting scared, but they said they were going to sleep. She continued joking around, even taking a few photos just for fun.

Then suddenly, the guy kissed her.

She said it was her first real kiss and that she was completely shocked. She froze. Right after that, the owner of the house came in and told them all to get ready to leave because they needed to go with their assistant leader

She told me she immediately stood up, rushed to the living room, grabbed her things, and left. She didn't say a word. According to her, she was completely shaken and out of it. She later pulled aside the girlfriend of one of the guy friends and told her what happened. That friend said they had already noticed something was off - that she looked stunned and frozen.

I don't even know if this counts as cheating. She says she didn't want any of it, and I believe she didn't initiate anything... but it still hurts. It was her first kiss, and it wasn't me. I keep thinking about it, replaying it in my head. I feel hurt, confused, and honestly a little lost

After everything, I still chose to forgive her.

I believed her when she said she didn‚Äôt want what happened. That the kiss was sudden, that she froze, that she never intended to hurt me. And because I loved her, I trusted her. I wanted to move forward. I wanted to fix things with her ‚Äî together.

But instead, she asked for space.

At first, I hesitated. I didn‚Äôt want distance ‚Äî I wanted healing. I wanted to hold her hand and rebuild. But she forced it. Said if I didn‚Äôt give her space, she‚Äôd end things right there. So I gave her that space, even if it hurt me more than I could admit.

Before we hung up, she pinky promised me she‚Äôd come back once everything was okay. That she‚Äôd fix it. She promised. And I believed her.

The next day, I tried to respect that space. I didn‚Äôt over-message her. I gave her room. Still updated her gently, out of love ‚Äî just little things, like telling her to take care during the rain. She ignored it.

Then came another gut punch ‚Äî she suddenly said she wanted to end everything. Just like that. No warning. No closure. Just: ""Let me go.""

I begged. I pleaded. I wasn‚Äôt ready to lose her ‚Äî not like that. I still saw something worth fighting for in us. But she didn‚Äôt want to fight anymore. She just‚Ä¶ gave up.

So I let her go. Not because I wanted to. But because I was already carrying too much pain. I was tired of holding on alone. Tired of loving someone who made me feel like I wasn‚Äôt enough anymore.

Now we‚Äôre ‚Äúfriends.‚Äù But honestly? I don‚Äôt even know if she still values me ‚Äî or if I was just something she outgrew.

I still love her. But maybe love isn't enough when you're the only one willing to stay",1,1753294044.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

1m7ggsb,https://www.reddit.com/r/CountertopConfessions/comments/1m7ggsb/explore_the_ninja_ce251_coffee_maker_features_for/,Explore the Ninja CE251 Coffee Maker Features for Perfect Brew,"The Ninja CRT2NJCE251RB has been a regular part of my mornings for a while now, and I must admit, it‚Äôs hard to imagine starting the day without it. This 12-cup programmable coffee maker has a sleek black and stainless-steel design that fits seamlessly into any modern kitchen. While its aesthetic appeal caught my eye initially, it's the sheer functionality and features that convinced me to make it my go-to coffee machine.

**Programmable Convenience at Its Finest**  
One feature I find incredibly useful is the fully programmable delay brew setting. I‚Äôve set it the night before so I can wake up to the comforting aroma of freshly brewed coffee. It‚Äôs like having my personal barista who never takes a day off. The 24-hour programmability is a game-changer, especially for those early mornings when fumbling with buttons just isn‚Äôt an option. The intuitive button interface makes setting up the program ridiculously easy, even for someone who isn‚Äôt tech-savvy.

**Hotter and Fresher Brews with Dual Brew Modes**  
The coffee maker has two brewing strengths: Classic and Rich. I‚Äôm more of a strong coffee person, so I stick to the ""Rich"" mode most of the time, but the ""Classic"" option is perfect for guests who prefer something lighter. Thanks to the advanced boiler, the coffee always comes out piping hot, which feels like a small luxury on cold mornings. Its small-batch mode has also been a lifesaver when I only want to make a cup or two without sacrificing flavor.  

[Check Ninja CRT2NJCE251RB price on Amazon.](https://cookwareoutlet.com/p/b07ztyztj5/)

**An Adjustable Warming Plate to Keep It Fresh**  
One of my biggest pet peeves with coffee machines has always been lukewarm coffee. Thankfully, the Ninja CRT2NJCE251RB has an adjustable warming plate that keeps coffee fresh and at the right temperature for up to four hours. I‚Äôve tested this feature extensively, especially on weekends when I enjoy multiple cups throughout the day. The coffee remains flavorful and doesn‚Äôt develop that burnt taste some other machines tend to produce if left sitting too long.

**Convenient Design and Ease of Use**  
The 60-ounce removable water reservoir deserves a special mention here because it makes refilling the machine so much easier. You can carry it directly to the sink without awkward tilting or spilling. I appreciate the reusable filter too; not having to stock up on disposable filters saves me both money and hassle. The cleaning process is straightforward, which is a blessing for someone who‚Äôd rather spend more time drinking coffee than cleaning equipment.

**Merits**  
- Dual brew modes for customizable flavor strength.  
- Advanced boiler ensures hotter brews every time.  
- Adjustable warming plate keeps coffee fresh for hours.  
- Programmable delay feature sets up coffee a day in advance.  
- Easy-to-clean design with reusable filter and removable water reservoir.

**Less Favorable Aspects**  
- The glass carafe feels a bit fragile, so you‚Äôll need to handle it with care.  
- It‚Äôs a bit bulky if you have limited counter space.  
- The machine can be slightly noisy during the brewing process.

**Competing Products**  
When comparing this machine to others like the Cuisinart Brew Central 12-Cup and the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew, I found the Ninja offers a perfect balance of performance and customization. The Cuisinart makes excellent coffee but lacks the dual brew strength mode, while the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew is versatile with its single-serve option, yet it doesn‚Äôt get the coffee as hot as the Ninja. The rich flavor, advanced brewing technology, and adjustable warming plate give the Ninja a competitive edge.

**True Value**  
Given the range of features it offers, this coffee maker delivers solid value for its price. You‚Äôre essentially getting a multifunctional machine that feels like it was designed with both convenience and coffee quality in mind. While it‚Äôs an investment, it‚Äôs well worth it for anyone serious about their morning cup. The programmable options, advanced heating, and reusable features help justify the purchase many times over.

The Ferla X is a flagship coffee & vending tricycle marketed as a versatile ‚Äúcaf√© on wheels.‚Äù Priced in the $8,000‚Äì$20,000 range (depending on configuration), it promises an all-in-one mobile shop with features like a built-in sink, battery-powered freezer, and optional electric pedal assist Ôøº Ôøº. To understand how it performs in the real world, we‚Äôve gathered every review and testimonial we could find ‚Äì from customer feedback on Trustpilot, Reddit, Yelp and more, to professional/influencer reviews (YouTube walkarounds, blog posts, case studies). Below is a structured report with each source type, direct quotes highlighting strengths and weaknesses (durability, build quality, customer service, performance, portability, component issues, and value), plus a summary Pros & Cons table.

Customer Reviews & Testimonials

Trustpilot Reviews (Verified Customer Feedback)

On Trustpilot, Ferla Bikes has a low rating (TrustScore 3.2/5 with 1 review as of Jan 2025) Ôøº Ôøº. The sole Trustpilot reviewer gives Ferla X a 1-star and recounts severe reliability issues over one year of use. This customer, Dominique B., was initially excited to start a mobile coffee cart, but reports that ‚Äúin one year the battery failed, the refrigerator door ripped off due to incorrect hinges, the water pump broke, and the cabinet came unglued.‚Äù Even more alarming, ‚Äúon October 26, 2024 the worst possible thing happened‚Ä¶ The kingpin snaps while I‚Äôm riding the Ferla X. It was only luck that I wasn‚Äôt hurt as I was on a street with cars.‚Äù The reviewer adds that post-purchase support was ‚Äúok, but very unorganized‚Ä¶ texting a person with no accountability‚Äù and that after the major breakdown ‚Äúthe company has been less than helpful and the bike is still not operable, taking my business with it.‚Äù He ‚Äúwould not recommend investing the $10k‚Äì$20k they ask‚Äù, especially if you‚Äôre not in Southern California (implying remote customers get worse support) Ôøº Ôøº.

Yelp Reviews (Business Directory Feedback)

Ferla Bikes‚Äô Yelp page (Azusa, CA) features a mix of positive and negative customer stories (24 reviews as of mid-2025). On the positive side, some owners rave about the concept and build: ‚ÄúPurchased my first Coffee Bike and I cannot say how happy I am‚Ä¶ Superior quality. It‚Äôs actually made from real wood which makes this bike stand out! Today I made my first buck. I love it!!!‚Äù (5‚òÖ review by Yulia K.) Ôøº. Another buyer praised Ferla‚Äôs team for helping her business: ‚ÄúI purchased directly from the owner Feras. He inspired me to open my own mobile business‚Ä¶ Looking forward to purchase my second coffee bike!‚Äù Ôøº. These testimonials highlight good build materials and the entrepreneurial value the Ferla X can provide when everything goes right.

However, many Yelp reviews echo serious complaints. One detailed 1‚òÖ review describes receiving a defective unit and even a problematic replacement: ‚ÄúIt was not my fault the second bike (a used Ferla X) broke the first day and was missing parts. The bike is only being held together with zip ties.‚Äù The reviewer says an independent contractor, electrician, and bike shop all examined the Ferla X and told him ‚Äúthere is no way the bike would last [long] due to the weight of the back box‚Äù Ôøº. In the end, this customer was frustrated with Ferla‚Äôs response (an apology from a rep and an offer to swap models) and warns others away. Similarly, another Yelp user mentions being sold a scratched unit without a fridge as a ‚Äúdeal,‚Äù experiencing immediate failures, and ultimately having to push Ferla to make it right (noting ‚ÄúSteven was nice‚Äù during the resolution). These accounts underscore quality control issues (parts missing or breaking on arrival) and a reactive support that sometimes involves replacing the product with a different model rather than truly fixing underlying problems.

It‚Äôs worth noting that Ferla‚Äôs own site showcases some of these Yelp testimonials as success stories, while unhappy Yelp reviews emphasize unreliability. The contrast is stark ‚Äì one Yelp highlight mentions ‚Äúa sincere apology and [Ferla] offered to do right by us‚Äù (indicating the company at times rectified issues), but others like the zip-tie story indicate initial products that should never have shipped in that condition.

Reddit Community Reactions

On Reddit, discussions about Ferla bikes (both the Ferla X vending bike and the Ferla family cargo bikes) provide unfiltered customer experiences. In r/CargoBike, a detailed ‚ÄúFerla Family Cargo Bike Review‚Äù post from 2022 gained attention for its harsh critique. The original poster admonishes prospective buyers: ‚ÄúYou absolutely want to buy a cargo bike‚Ä¶ Just please, do not purchase THIS [Ferla] bike. The price is astronomical, the quality questionable, the customer service terrible. I cannot, and will not, recommend this product.‚Äù Ôøº. Other cargo-bike owners chimed in agreeing: one said Ferla‚Äôs support was ‚Äúshockingly rude‚Ä¶ In all of my life, I have never had a worse customer service experience‚Äù, describing zero accountability for delays, missing parts, and even being blamed by Ferla for not ‚Äúreaching out before purchasing‚Äù to double-check what the website promised Ôøº Ôøº. (In fact, this user reported the head of the company personally messaged them doubling down and demanding they remove their negative review, which only reinforced the feeling that ‚Äúthe company‚Äôs problems are coming from the top‚Äù Ôøº.) Multiple Redditors mention accessories not delivered (or arriving broken), months-long delays with no proactive communication, and an inability to get phone support. A parent who bought a $6k Ferla cargo bike noted the bike itself was ‚Äúokay‚Äù but ‚Äúit arrived damaged without a headlight‚Ä¶ No one answers the phone‚Ä¶ no manual or instructions included ‚Äì I could not figure out how to charge it for weeks.‚Äù Ôøº Ôøº This user calls the experience ‚Äúamateur and poor‚Äù and urges others to buy from competitors like Bunch Bikes Ôøº.

In r/bikewrench, a bicycle mechanic asked for tips repairing a friend‚Äôs Ferla X coffee bike, leading to candid technical opinions. One experienced bike tech responded: ‚ÄúHonestly, it is a death trap ‚Äì one step better than the worst of the Alibaba bikes. The steering geometry feels terrible and their plywood structure is inadequate. It isn‚Äôt the absolute worst, but if your friend makes decent money with this setup I‚Äôd encourage a complete rebuild in the off-season.‚Äù Ôøº They advised upgrading brakes and reinforcing the entire front box with metal framing, essentially implying the stock build isn‚Äôt sturdy enough Ôøº. The original poster then lamented that ‚ÄúFerla folks were useless. No tech documents, no new parts in until end of summer, and not much beyond a ‚Äògood luck.‚Äô‚Äù He agreed the factory box was unwieldy and noted the owner was now limiting use to very short, flat routes, as ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt take it too far.‚Äù Ôøº This thread highlights poor build/design (needing aftermarket fixes) and lack of support/parts availability, aligning with other reviews. On a related note, another Redditor did some research and discovered the Ferla bikes being sold in the US appear to be rebranded imports: ‚ÄúAt the last minute I did more research‚Ä¶ I saw the [Ferla] bike on Alibaba and realized that despite Ferla‚Äôs good marketing they are reselling a Chinese model.‚Äù Ôøº This revelation made that user opt for a different brand, feeling Ferla‚Äôs premium price wasn‚Äôt justified if the underlying product wasn‚Äôt unique.

Not all Reddit feedback is negative. In r/foodtrucks, a user who actually owns and operates a Ferla coffee cart shared a positive experience: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been working the Ferla Coffee Cart for a bit! It‚Äôs honestly been very good for my business. Solid build and super handy, very convenient for serving customers‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs been totally worth it for my mobile coffee business.‚Äù Ôøº. This person encouraged others not to hesitate. Such praise, however, is sparse compared to the volume of cautionary tales. It‚Äôs possible that satisfied Ferla X users are simply less vocal online, but the enthusiastic endorsements are mostly from brand ambassadors or Ferla‚Äôs own promotions, whereas the organic user community leans toward warning others.

Google Reviews and Other Platforms

Ferla‚Äôs presence on Google (e.g. Google Maps reviews) is limited. The company‚Äôs Google listing shows a moderately positive rating (around 4 out of 5 stars) with a few dozen reviews, but specific Ferla X feedback is hard to find in those. Most Google comments are brief, and many appear to be about the family bikes or general service. One Google reviewer simply states they were ‚Äúthrilled‚Äù with their Ferla bike purchase for a catering business (without detail). Another local guide mentioned enjoying a test ride at Ferla‚Äôs warehouse and complimented staff helpfulness (similar to some Yelp comments about in-person visits: ‚ÄúErik was so patient and super helpful‚Äù). These indicate that the pre-sale experience (test riding, sales reps) can be positive. However, comprehensive Google testimonial content is scarce compared to the in-depth stories on Reddit and Yelp.

Outside of social media, the Better Business Bureau (BBB) profile for Ferla Bikes is telling: Ferla is not BBB-accredited and currently holds a rating of ‚ÄúF.‚Äù The BBB reports multiple unresolved complaints (at least two formal complaints with ‚ÄúFailure to respond‚Äù by the business) Ôøº Ôøº. While details aren‚Äôt given, an F rating supports what many customers described: problems after purchase and difficulty getting satisfactory responses.

Summary of Customer Feedback: Across these consumer-driven platforms, a clear pattern emerges. Pros include the Ferla X‚Äôs promising concept and feature set, attractive design, and the success some entrepreneurs have had using it as a turnkey business (when it works, it truly can enable a profitable mobile caf√©). Customers appreciate the all-in-one convenience (one said it ‚Äúoffers it all‚Äù Ôøº), the aesthetic appeal (real wood finishes, eye-catching presence), and the inspiration it provides to start a business (‚ÄúI love it‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not working for anyone now!‚Äù as one owner put it Ôøº). A few have noted the bike feels solid and handles the intended job well in daily operation.

However, the cons voiced by customers are significant: durability problems (from minor issues like pumps and lights not working, up to major structural failures), inconsistent build quality (parts breaking or coming loose far too soon), and particularly poor customer service after the sale. The support is described as slow, disorganized, and even antagonistic in some cases. Getting replacement parts or repairs under warranty has been a challenge for many, especially those outside Ferla‚Äôs home region. Many customers feel the product is overpriced given these issues ‚Äì some explicitly regret spending thousands on a Ferla bike and encourage others to consider competitors. The word ‚Äúlemon‚Äù has been used in frustration by at least one Redditor. In short, actual user experiences range from enthusiastic success stories to catastrophic failures, with a noticeable skew toward the latter in detailed online discussions.

1m7ge0k,https://www.reddit.com/r/marriageadvice/comments/1m7ge0k/rambling_post_about_how_frustrated_im_growing/,Rambling post about how frustrated I'm growing within my marriage,"I (52M) and my wife (51F) have not had what I would call a stellar relationship in the last few year. We've been married almost 26 years and have two teenage boys. I have worked from home for nearly 8 years and her company is doing ""hybrid"" after WFH during COVID. She rarely goes to the office as no one else does either.

Both my boys are getting into the elite parts of their sports, the older one trains 5+ days a week and often travels abroad for training. The younger one trains 3+ days a week and has also started travelling. This is great - I love them to death and the fact that they have gotten where they are is awesome. However, I do essentially all the cooking in the house. That often means I need to stop working at 4 to make sure they get food before training AND I need to take them to training, often far enough away that I need to stay at that location for up to 2 hours... and sometimes training locations don't overlap which gets tricky. During school, I need to make sure the boys get their lunches and breakfast and often to school on time (I don't need to do much but they often need a bit of supervision while I get coffee going and take care of the dog). This often means I have limited work hours that are often interrupted by her incessant meetings (that is like 80%+ of her day) and that I ""talk too loud"" for my meeting or two I might have (I often only have a 15 minute standup meeting in the morning). She often works 10+ hours a day and gets mad at me if I need to work at night to make up a few hours in the week if she isn't working and wants to spend some time with me. I feel bad about it but I often have deadlines I can't miss and she seems unwilling to help get the boys food or to training in those cases. She often gets mad at me if I miss getting something at the grocery store or don't make enough food for left overs so she can have a quick lunch. 

We recently travelled to watch the boys compete. I was a long drive (15 hours) and up early to watch training and late for other activities. I have dietary restrictions so I often need to find a place that I can eat at or in some cases she will. After the competition we were going to take the boys for dinner. She kept asking if I found a place to eat yet. I kept asking all three of them what type of food they want. It was always ""doesn't matter"" and ""whatever"". After asking a third time I snapped at her - she march off and I went to find shade and just pick a place. When I returned with a location, nobody wanted to eat there - they didn't want that kind of food. After returning home, I snapped at her again. This is a bit out of the ordinary for us. I mean everyone has the odd tiff in a marriage (at least that I've seen).

Upon further reflection, it is likely me just being tired and letting my frustration out. I'm frustrated that I have to handle all the boys stuff myself, I'm frustrated that she gets to save money for retirement and I spend every single cent I have to pay for the boys training and other things around the house (we both make 6 figures so it should be an issue but having 2 elite athletes is not very cheap). I mow the grass, I make sure the garden is good and pick the vegetables, I vacuum and clean the toilets and cook the food. If she isn't working at night, we maybe spend a bit of time together or she starts playing some mobile game... I need to get a reasonable amount of sleep due to a medical condition (a consistent 7 hours at a minimum) so I go to bed at a reasonable time. That generally means no intimacy anymore either since she is up to 12 or 1 playing her games. We never really went at it like rabbits (perhaps 6-8 times a month) but now it is maybe once a month. And yes, she is likely in menopause so I do think that is part of the intimacy issue though I try to take that in stride, hoping that she is just not avoiding me directly. 

I really feel neglected. I know, the advice will be ""you need to talk to her"" and ""communication is key"". I've tried that many times. I'm rebuffed or she says we can talk about it later. I've even given her a heads up ahead of time to not blindside her. It is nearly impossible to communicate. I'm worried that if I suggest therapy, it will just make it worse so I'm thinking I might go alone. I feel the last few years has been building up like a volcano and it might explode soon.

I know this has been kind of a rambling post as I really don't post much but her friends are my friends and I really have no one to talk to - so, reddit, do you have any advice?

1m7gc54,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1m7gc54/totally_stonewalled_by_baratza_customer_service/,Totally Stonewalled by Baratza customer service [ Baratza Vario],"I have had a Baratza Vario for more than 12 years and recently after a few back and forths with the Baratza customer support through email, I agreed to refurbish it. I got new stainless steel burs, new motor and belt , new board and many other things, a pretty substantial order for a total of about $220

I have a number of issues with the grinder after I got it back and I have been practically gotten stonewalled by their support staff. When I send them an email with questions, they would be no ETA of getting back to me and a couple of times they respond back after I let a couple of days go by and bother them again, but their response is some sort of canned response that has no relationship to what I am asking of them to help me with, and after that, total silence again.

In the last few days, I discovered that they have practically no phone support at all. You call and you hear a recorded message saying that they are so backed up that you can only use the web form to open a ticket.  
So my question to this community here is basically if they are familiar with Baratza as a company and whether my experience with them is typical and if anyone has any suggestions as to what I could do to have them respond and pay attention to my problems. I mean at this stage, I am thinking if there is a way to fight it even through my credit card company as a terrible customer service and a defective product.

This is an absolutely frustrating experience, never had a similar experience with the customer support of any other company in the US honestly.

1m7gbal,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1m7gbal/the_heaven_she_built_to_bury_us_part_1/,The Heaven She Built to Bury Us (Part 1),"It has been roughly 182 days since the cathedral first appeared in the sky.



When it first materialized, I turned on the TV. People smarter than me with degrees informed us that it was about as large as our moon. It defied all logic and practicality. They mentioned that the path of totality covered just over 300 miles, enveloping both towns and cities alike in an unforgiving darkness. My small town had fallen victim to the perpetual eclipse as well. The sun stopped moving, the moon was absent in turn, and the only light outside came from old streetlamps.



On the first day, an emergency broadcast was sent out to the areas affected by the cathedral‚Äôs shadow, telling everyone to stay indoors and wait for military personnel to help them evacuate. When the military didn‚Äôt show up after about a week, that was when people started to really panic.



I think that everyone was in a state of shock or denial for the first few days, so maybe the reality of the situation hadn‚Äôt hit them as quickly as it probably should have. For me, I was always a very cautious person, and so I stayed inside. The blinds of my one-story home remained shut tight and the lights within kept off, as to keep others from potentially having their interests piqued. The one and only thing that emitted a noise from within my house was the living room television. I had it flicked on for any new information regarding the unfolding dilemma.



When the news channels first aired what was happening, I remember my mom giving me a call. It was in the middle of the night and I sat on my living room couch, intently watching the broadcasts. I had been wrapped in blankets with a mug full of sweet tea in hand, a half-eaten pizza on a plate resting atop my coffee table. My phone rang, which startled me.



‚ÄúBaby?‚Äù



‚ÄúMom, hey. Did you see‚Äì‚Äù I was quickly interrupted.



‚ÄúAre you okay?‚Äù When she spoke, she sounded frantic. I‚Äôm my mom‚Äôs only kid and so she‚Äôd always been pretty extreme whenever it came to me and my safety, or anything in regard to me, but I do feel like this reaction was warranted.



‚ÄúYeah, I‚Äôm all good for now, ma. There was an emergency broadcast that said to stay inside, so that‚Äôs where I‚Äôve been,‚Äù I explained. ‚ÄúThey mentioned the military. Have you heard anything?‚Äù



‚ÄúNo, I haven‚Äôt. Sam and I are planning to come down and get you.‚Äù Mom sighed after talking, giving me reason to believe that she was relieved to know that I was alright, considering the situation.



‚ÄúCome down and get me? I don‚Äôt know if‚Äì‚Äù Interrupted, again.



‚ÄúWillow,‚Äù she spoke, her tone stern. The kind of stern that moms only use on their kids, like it‚Äôs some kind of super special mom-power or something. ‚ÄúWe *are* coming down to get you. We‚Äôre leaving tonight, so pack your shit, okay?‚Äù



‚ÄúOkay.‚Äù



‚ÄúGood. Sam and I are far enough out, so that thing doesn‚Äôt reach where we live. You‚Äôre on the edge of it, so we can come get you, no problem. Don‚Äôt you worry about anything,‚Äù she explained. ‚ÄúHey,‚Äù she called.



‚ÄúYeah?‚Äù I answered.



""I love you, Willow-bee. Everything is gonna be okay, okay?‚Äù



‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù I mumbled, unsure. ‚ÄúI love you too, ma.‚Äù



‚ÄúAll right. Bye, baby.‚Äù



And just like that, the call was over.



I failed to see my mom in at least a few months before all this happened. With everything that was going on, it would be a relief to finally see her again. For as long as I can remember, it had always been mom and I against the whole world, really. Sam was a good guy too. He was good for her, healthy for us, and he raised me from when I was about 15. He had been more of a dad to me than the other ones, anyways.



After that phone call, I went ahead and packed a bag. Toothbrush. Hairbrush. Clothes. And my childhood stuffed animal ‚Äì a moose, to be specific.



I sat down on the floor and waited by the front door for the rest of the night, my bag next to me. It should only take them a couple hours or so to get to me. While the time passed, I quietly listened. Usually you would hear cars driving around throughout the neighborhood, maybe you‚Äôd hear the sounds of people walking dogs, or really just any kind of outdoor commotion; however, I didn‚Äôt hear a single thing. No cars, no people, not even crickets. It was a very thick silence ‚Äì and for some reason, it left an incredibly bad taste in my mouth.



At some point, I must have ended up falling asleep on the floor. The vinyl flooring was cold and stiff beneath me, and when I came to a little more, my body ached in all the worst possible ways; neck sore, back tight, a small pool of drool near my cheek. Classy. I groggily moved my hands to rub the sleep out of my eyes and then the drool from off of my face. I then reached into the back pocket of my sweatpants to grab my phone, checking the time.



3:13 AM.



It should‚Äôve only taken them a couple hours, tops.



No missed calls. No messages. Nothing. I rang my mom‚Äôs number and I was sent to voicemail within the first ring. I tried again, then again, and again ‚Äì and again, again. My thumb just kept moving, fueled by an almost fervent anxiety. I tried calling my mom at least 50 times, maybe more; most likely more.



After at least a few missed calls in, I eventually started to leave voicemails.



‚ÄúMa, hey. It‚Äôs me. Looks like you‚Äôre late, so I‚Äôm callin‚Äô to see if you‚Äôre alright. If you somehow got held up or somethin‚Äô, just shoot me a call or text, please. Love you.‚Äù As I spoke, I could hear the slight desperation laced within my shaky words.



That was only the first voicemail.



Sitting there on the floor, I found myself staring down at my old flip-phone. The small screen displayed my mom‚Äôs contact information. I‚Äôm not sure how long I stayed like that, dissociating, but it got to a point where my behind went numb from sitting on the floor for so long.



Eventually, I stood up with a quiet crack of my knees, and walked over to the front window. I peeled back the curtain just enough to peek through.



Maybe they were out there somewhere.



There were no headlights. No tire tracks on the road. No movement. Not even wind. The world was so still, it felt like the moment before a snow globe gets all shaken up. It should have only taken them two or three hours. Maybe four if they hit traffic, but there *wasn‚Äôt* traffic anymore. No one was going anywhere ‚Äì at least not yet, anyways.



I pressed my forehead to the glass, staring out into that unmovable darkness. My breath fogged against the panes. It looked like the sky had been painted black and frozen in place. The cathedral hung in the air above the horizon like a nasty bruise ‚Äì still, silent, and impossibly vast. Sometimes I wondered if it was moving, just too slow for us to notice. It resembled a castle in the sky, resting on what looked like a colossal amount of land; like it had been ripped from the Earth and raised up to perch directly in front of the sun.



The sun around its edges formed a ring of bright pulsating white light, encapsulating a halo-like image behind a foreboding obsidian silhouette. It buzzed, rippling amongst itself in quiet contentment.



It looked so grotesquely beautiful, it reminded me of an image I had once read about. In 1947, a woman was plastered all over a famous magazine. You‚Äôd think that it would have been your average day modeling shot, maybe, but no. She was dead, sprawled out delicately across the crumpled hood of a car. ‚ÄòThe most beautiful suicide‚Äô, they called it. She had only been 23 years old, which is unnervingly close to my own age. That image, and this thing high up above me now, flooded me with the same exact emotions.



Melancholy, numbness, and even awe.



A part of me wondered if maybe this was how herrings felt when face to face with a megalodon.



There had been nobody outside at the beginning, and so you could imagine my surprise when I did see *someone* out there in that darkness. An older woman dressed in muted and earthy toned clothes, a large beige scarf draped around a set of small hunched shoulders. She stood in the very middle of the street and stared up at the cathedral as if it were the most normal thing in the entire world to her. I couldn‚Äôt make out her expression since her back faced me, but the way she just looked at it ‚Äì it made my stomach tighten up, like someone grabbed ahold of my intestines and squeezed.



After at least a minute or two of staring outside, studying, I pulled myself back and texted mom again. I slid down against the wall beside the window and pulled the stuffed moose out of my nearby bag. His fur was matted and one beady eye was hanging by a thread. The plush had been loved dearly throughout the years and it showed. He made me feel a little more safe, and a lot less alone, at the very least. I held him to my chest and waited. Every ten minutes, I checked my phone.



Nothing.



At some point, I tried calling Sam‚Äôs number too, yet it also went to voicemail. I left a voice-message anyway.



‚ÄúSam, I hope you get this. Please call back and let me know that you and mom are okay. I‚Äôm still home, safe. I‚Äôm just scared. And,‚Äù I paused here, my voice cracking. ‚ÄúAnd I don‚Äôt know what to do, dad. I don‚Äôt know what to do. I‚Äôll wait here at home for you and ma, Sam. However long it takes.‚Äù My words had trailed off at the end there.



That was my goal for now. To just sit at home and wait for my parents to come find me. I‚Äôm not a strong or brave person and the thought of leaving here horrified me. I‚Äôm not a hero, I‚Äôm a wimp ‚Äì and my self awareness of that fact was abundant. I struggled with agoraphobia for a very long time and with the way things were now, it made the most sense to me to avoid what was happening outside altogether.



I didn‚Äôt have anyone else aside from my parents and nana, but they all lived far enough away to the point where I was isolated. No friends. No other family. No lover. The very idea of opening up to people scared me. People were unpredictable and confusing. When it came to talking to others, they would tell me that I came off as ‚Äòtoo much‚Äô or ‚Äòtoo little‚Äô. People are like water and I‚Äôm oil ‚Äì we just don‚Äôt mix. It makes me sad, though. I want friends, but I‚Äôm scared.



I shifted the phone away from my ear and stared at the screen, watching as the voicemail timer crawled to its end. It was like all strength began to leave me and there was no point in anything anymore; a moment of weakness, which was already all too common with me. I held my plush tight to my chest.



The phone stifled a weak beep, indicating to me that the voicemail had concluded.



Then I cried. Not the kind of crying that comes with big gasps or shaking hands, but the quieter kind. The kind that slips out in silence, slow and steady, like a leak in the hull of a sinking ship. The kind that happens when the realization settles in; you are completely, utterly alone.



And I wasn‚Äôt the only one who felt it. Within the first few weeks, dozens of people tried to flee the surrounding towns, mine included. I don‚Äôt blame them for trying. That kind of loneliness, that kind of dread; it makes you desperate, whether to escape or to *explain*. But what happened to them afterward ‚Äì that wasn‚Äôt their fault.



Some turned to movement and others turned to meaning.



That‚Äôs when the religious fanatics started showing up. As soon as the cathedral made its appearance, there were plenty of people who took to the streets to preach about the rapture, hollering about some kind of divine intervention. At least that‚Äôs what my nana said when we talked over the phone.



‚ÄúHey, nana. You doin‚Äô alright? I tried callin‚Äô, but you didn‚Äôt pick up.‚Äù



‚ÄúI‚Äôm doin‚Äô as good as I can, sweet girl, how are you? There‚Äôs folks out in the road over here. I‚Äôm lookin‚Äô through the window right now since your papa‚Äôs fixin‚Äô to get home‚Äô.‚Äù Her southern accent swung through in full force. ‚ÄúAnd sorry for not pickin‚Äô up. I‚Äôve been busy with work, so I‚Äôm sure y‚Äôknow how it is.‚Äù



‚ÄúYeah? If you‚Äôre by the windows, be careful,‚Äù I warned her before speaking again. ‚ÄúAlso, I‚Äôm not doin‚Äô too great, but I think I‚Äôll be okay. Have you heard from ma?‚Äù



There were a few seconds of silence on the other end of the phone ‚Äì and for a moment, I thought that maybe she had disconnected, but I could hear a quiet static coming from her line.



‚ÄúNo, I haven‚Äôt,‚Äù she answered. ‚ÄúSorry, baby-girl. How come?‚Äù



Her answer had made my stomach churn.



‚ÄúDo y‚Äôthink that you can maybe try and call her? She said that her and Sam would pick me up, but it‚Äôs been weeks now,‚Äù I explained, already feeling a wetness swell within my eyes. ‚ÄúMy messages don‚Äôt go through and none of my calls were picked up.‚Äù



‚ÄúWell, I can, of course. Anythin‚Äô for you. Y‚Äôknow, they‚Äôre holdin‚Äô signs out there. They‚Äôre hard to see, but there‚Äôs some crosses and I can just barely hear them sayin‚Äô things.‚Äù She rambled on about the people in the streets.



It seemed like my nana had practically glossed straight over what I‚Äôd just said, in regard to my mother not responding to me, which was unusual for her to do; she always answered. Her lapses in judgement started happening more and more often as time went on, even before the cathedral. It was hard to put any kind of blame on the thing since her mental health had already been spiraling downward beforehand, but a part of me wanted to have an object to anchor all of my frustrations to.



‚ÄúAre they, like chanting, or something?‚Äù I hadn‚Äôt looked outside very often since it was something I usually tried to avoid, but I had heard people talking outside my place a few different times.



‚ÄúThink so,‚Äù she started. ‚ÄúSomethin‚Äô about the rapture, I reckon. It‚Äôs hard to hear ‚Äòem.‚Äù There was another pause that lasted a few seconds again and then a sound of rustling, like the closing of either blinds or curtains. ‚ÄúWell, your Papa just got home, so I‚Äôll let you go. You stay safe, baby-girl. I love you to the moon and back.‚Äù



‚ÄúLove you to the moon and back too, but wait, Nana. About Ma‚Äî‚Äú Before I was able to finish my sentence, the call clicked to an end.



That was the last time I ever got to speak with my nana.



It was a short and sweet conversation. I wish that I could have spoken with her longer. Maybe I could have asked more about her day, or if she picked up any new hobbies. I just didn‚Äôt realize how little time there was, is all. She‚Äôd always been very sick, ever since I could remember. There had been a time where she had all of her teeth, more of her hair, and less swelling around her ankles. When I think of her, I try to remember the better parts. Watching her health deteriorate with the years made me realize the implications of mortality very early on in my life. She‚Äôd been having health issues since I was just a kid.



After that final call, I found myself revisiting old memories with her more and more. I started thinking about death a lot ‚Äì not just hers, but the slow kind that was creeping through the world. The realness of what it meant to be human swallowed me whole, like a whale eating krill.



In the course of time, the people who did take to the streets started to disappear. After the call with my nana, I had started to more cautiously look out past the curtains and through my front window to see if anything was going on outside. As each day passed on, there would be less and less figures out there. Eventually, when I looked out through my window, I didn‚Äôt see anyone anymore. It stayed that way for quite a while. The television also resorted to speaking to me in static, the screen dancing in blacks and whites. No more new information came through, so I turned it off. It was like everything was coming to a very gradual stop.



No more people outside, no more voices whispering amongst the sidewalks of town, no more television, and the signal embedded within my phone seemed to just click off one day. All that was left was the ravenous shadows, the monumental cathedral, and the ever-still silence.



And the people the shadows consumed.



It began when there was a quiet squeaking of wheels that rolled their way along the sidewalk conjoined to my home, then three frail taps met the wood of my door. If things hadn‚Äôt become so silent, I would have missed the knocks. The sudden sound was somehow foreign to me, in a way. When exactly was the last time I had heard someone knock on my door?



The time was blurring together in a mesh of yesterday, today, and tomorrow. When the cathedral reared its humongous head, our sun refused to budge itself from its position, as if it were almost out of fear. There were no indicators for passing days, but I attempted to track them through an old wristwatch that I‚Äôd found; a birthday gift from Sam. He had once told me that I ‚Äúhad no concept of time‚Äù, so he hoped it would help me. He was right, funnily enough.



Ever so cautiously, I crept my way to my front door and glanced past the peephole. The elderly woman from before stood there; the one who had once gazed up at the obsidian beast in the sky.



Now that she was closer, I could take in more of her details. Her hair was held up in a messy bun of silver and white, locked into place with what looked like black pencils or sticks. Her skin was a pale white, the texture reminiscent of leather, and moles decorated her face. She fashioned amber eyes that sagged, like she hadn‚Äôt slept in ages.



Just behind her, I could see a rickety shopping cart, full of canned items and bottled liquids. It was hard to see just what was inside of it, but the cans were easy enough to make out. Seeing her cart helped explain the squeaks from earlier.



‚ÄúHello?‚Äù She spoke, her voice faint and raspy. It sounded as if she had a sore throat and the thought of it made me feel an itch deep within my own. Either that or she was a very avid smoker. It immediately reminded me of my nana and my chest tightened.



‚ÄúHi,‚Äù I quietly answered, my voice unsure ‚Äì hesitant, at best. It was no better than a whisper.



‚ÄúOh, so you are there. I was afraid that you were only going to gawk, rather than talk.‚Äù As she spoke, she turned towards her cart and grabbed a few cans from out of the basket, slowly placing them down at the foot of my door.



‚ÄúWhat‚Äôre you doin‚Äô?‚Äù I questioned her actions, coming off as more combative than I had originally meant to. Nobody had messed with my home, or myself, since everything had started. I was a deeply untrusting person ‚Äì always had been. That was the whole reason I lived alone to begin with.



‚ÄúAn animal left unfed is an animal left with no other options but to consume what it mustn‚Äôt. Do you not yet know, little mouse?‚Äù Her voice came out muffled from the other side of the door.



‚ÄúMa‚Äôam? Sorry, I‚Äôm not sure that I understand.‚Äù My hushed tone was inquisitive. The one eye that I had on her never left and I watched as she finished placing cans down on my porch. She stood semi-straight now, her exhausted gaze finding its way right at my own.



‚ÄúLorelai,‚Äù she introduced. ‚ÄúAnd I speak of those who fled. The remnants that now patrol these streets, looking for little mice like you. Lost ones, lonely ones. They are vicious owls, waiting for the right moment to gorge their ever-hungry talons into the tenderness of your precious pale flesh. Your dainty soul, shaking and quivering, would be like a binky to a newborn. You‚Äôve little chance of succor, so receive mine.‚Äù



The more she explained, the more confused I grew. The things that she spoke of made no sense to me, no matter how hard I attempted to try and understand what she was saying. The words that left her mouth met my ears in a garbled mess of nothing.



I watched as the old woman sluggishly trod down along the sidewalk, vanishing out of sight from my door‚Äôs peephole. Her presence had made my lungs tighten, my throat catching my breath without me having even realized. Once she‚Äôd departed, I let out a heavy sigh and then moved over to my window. I carefully peeled back my curtain and peeked out past it. My surroundings seemed the same as ever ‚Äì and so, once I felt it to be safe, I went back to my front door and unlocked it. With a slow motion, I drew it open and looked down towards the cans that she‚Äôd left behind, along with a few bottles of what looked to be water.



After a second of hesitation, my hands reached down and took the items in grasp, placing them inside. Once that was finished, I stood up straight ‚Äì and breathed. The air hit my lungs like pepper hits one‚Äôs nose; it burned, almost. But really, it built a knot in my stomach that was hard to describe. An itch that ached. Being outside for the first time since the eclipse dawned on the 300 miles of unfortunate Earth was jarring, to say the least. My eyes had adjusted to the darkness that plagued the whole area, but that didn‚Äôt mean I felt okay with it at all. If anything, knowing that I had become so used to this environment‚Äôs depths made me receive a very dark and deep despair.



And it didn‚Äôt feel like I was alone here.



My gaze searched through the shadows, as the old woman had aforementioned, and I found something within them. Where the lampposts‚Äô light failed to shine, by a neighboring house just adjacent to mine, I could see *it*. Not a person, not an animal, and not like anything else that I had ever seen before.



It was humanoid, somewhat. Compared to the one-story house that it stood next to, the top of its bald head almost reached the bottom of the roof. It rested on two legs, its arms leering down past its knee-joints. Disgustingly long spindly hands and skin-tight fingers brushed against the ground. Its proportions made no sense and everything seemed too long, or too tall. Its head bobbled with the slow and haggard steps it took.



Where a face would originally be, laid an unnaturally wide void-like hole instead, with an oozing black ick dripping out; like a tar. The cavern plastered on its head resembled the way an eclipse looked ‚Äì a black void with a gray ring hugging the ridge. Its skin was a deep gray, camouflaging it concerningly well amongst the shadows. A creature seemingly created for this new reality.



From where I stood in my doorway, I couldn‚Äôt hear the creature very well, if it were making any sounds at all; however, quiet and repetitive clicks echoed their way from that direction. It sounded like a guttural tapping. A gurgled click and ta-tap. In my mind, I pictured the image of rain against windows.



The only thing I could do was watch as it lazily heaved its bone-thin body against my neighbor‚Äôs house. It reminded me of how bears scratched their heavy forms against thick trees to relieve an itch. This thing was doing the same, but with its face and head, mostly. Its tar-like liquid messily painted the home‚Äôs white paneled side as its face brushed against it in an unnatural and disturbing fashion.



At one point, in my daze, I witnessed the corner-flesh of its mouth getting caught on a piece of paneling that had been protruding outwards. It moved its head forward and forward and the flesh tore in response, ripping the mouth open to make the already wide-enough dark pit split even more. The tar from its mouth spilled in a thick gush and dripped, splattering itself across the home and ground below it.



With my eyes flashing across the house where it lurked, I could see another one of those things. It was on the side of a home like a spider, its hands and gangling feet attached to the panels. Its neck was bent unnaturally backward, its head dangling to where a shoulder was. Within its whirlpool-mouth was a set of legs ‚Äì unmoving. The feet still had their socks, and only one shoe. Focusing closer on the form, it was visible to see that a lump rested within its originally narrow gullet; it resembled a snake eating a mouse that was just a little too big. I quickly realized that this monster was right above a window, which looked to be smashed into. I could barely see the remnants of glass shards flashing across the skin of the creature‚Äôs face.



With that, I immediately stepped back into my home and quietly shut the front door. I locked it, turned to face my back towards it, and slowly slid downwards into a fetal position. I hugged my knees close to my chest and stared outward ahead of me with wide eyes. My whole body shivered and shook, an earthquake caused by a rapid tha-thumping heart rumbling in my chest.



Remembering back to what Lorelai had said, it finally hit me. Those things had been people once. Was that going to happen to me too if I tried to leave this place?



After that day, the months passed by. Lorelai would occasionally come to my front door, knock three times as she always did, and drop off canned food or bottles of water. I asked her about the things outside, questioning on why they seemed to leave her be, but she always gave me a vague answer in response to those kinds of questions.



‚ÄúHow come they don‚Äôt go for you?‚Äù I was sitting down with my back placed flush against the front door. I could hear her placing down items on my porch, the shuffling of her slipper-covered feet moving every so often.



‚ÄúI‚Äôm damned already and therefore my path is chosen, little mouse. Carnivorous as a beast may be, it wouldn‚Äôt willingly consume poison. No, the food it craves is a more divine delicacy,‚Äù she explained in a husky whisper, a quiet chuckle following afterwards. The kind of chuckle you would hear from someone who has nothing else left to lose.



‚ÄúSo you‚Äôre sayin‚Äô that they think you‚Äôre gross, or somethin‚Äô? Like, demons who prefer virgins ‚Äì oh, or maybe like how most people hate pineapple on pizza?‚Äù I compared, looking down at my twiddling hands as the rest upon my lap. My legs were folded in a crisscross.



‚ÄúYour comparisons ring true. Regard me as a vessel of maggots, and them as the maggots grown to flies. For when the hour tolls, She shall come for me. Until then, none may lay a gray-skinned finger upon my being.‚Äù As she spoke, the sounds of her stifled steps halted and there was a quiet thud that came from right behind me.



She coughed a few times and it sounded close, like she had sat down as well. We were back to back, separated by a panel of wood. This was the closest I had ever been to another person who wasn‚Äôt a part of my family. Something about that realization flooded my heart with a twinkle of joy. Even though she was odd, spoke in what sounded like riddles, and was much older than me ‚Äì I felt like I could call her a friend at this point. My first real friend in years.



‚ÄúWho is ‚ÄòShe‚Äô?‚Äù My curiosity peaked when Lorelai had mentioned another person. I had wondered if there were still any other people residing in town.



‚ÄúShe erected the obsidian Heaven. The tar-clad Goddess who buries us in shadow to marinate our bones. The remnants of innocence are Her beloved spawn; twisted relics of grotesque genius, ruthlessly carved to remind the breathing that we are nothing but ants.‚Äù Lorelai spoke like she‚Äôd walked out from a passage of the bible. I‚Äôd studied it once or twice in the past when I still believed in God.



Deciphering Lorelai‚Äôs ramblings was like an elderly person with dyslexia trying to solve the daily crossword puzzle of an old newspaper covered in coffee stains.



‚ÄúSo there‚Äôs a goddamn God-lady up in the cathedral, and she killed the folks ‚Äòround here because they tried to leave? What a bitch,‚Äù I exclaimed, moving my hands as I spoke.



‚ÄúWhat a bitch,‚Äù Lorelai parroted. It seemed like she agreed. ‚ÄúAlthough, it is not punishment, little mouse. It is inheritance. Even Eden has its serpents; now the serpents wear thorned crowns. Her breath is the fog. Her tongue is the night. Her babes gnaw on flesh, for they remember a softness once.‚Äù



‚ÄúSounds like you‚Äôre makin‚Äô excuses for it, which is bullshit.‚Äù I couldn‚Äôt quite understand my friend‚Äôs reasoning and Lorelai gave a dry laugh, like crumpled leaves.



‚ÄúExcuses? No, child. I offer no balm for what is already rot. I only speak what I have seen. What I have *felt.*‚Äù A pause. A wheeze of breath. ‚ÄúYou ever feel something reach into your dreams and pluck your thoughts like grapes from a vine? I have. I saw Her once. You‚Äôll see Her too.‚Äù



It didn‚Äôt make sense to me at all ‚Äì then again, she rarely ever made any sense to begin with. She‚Äôd been a sort of light in the darkness throughout this whole ordeal. After that, we always talked through the door whenever she came by. She once told me that she liked it out there because it was quiet; her reasoning was that it had always been loud inside her head, but here, the silence is so all-consuming to the point where it calms even her own thoughts sometimes. I could relate to that, in a way, but I *missed* people.



My mom, Sam, my Nana, and everyone else who had been in my life.



When three months hit, I had been sitting on my living room couch. My plush moose was held within my hands and I had him held upwards in the air. We stared at one another, his limp head dangling down. Lorelai had been the only person to have come around and speak with me, which helped keep my sanity in check for the most part. My moose was another aid in that department. I would talk to him, wanting to relive conversations. He would never talk back. He‚Äôs just a very good listener. I‚Äôd grab his pellet-filled hooves and squish them, shake them. The sensation was therapeutic. It reminded me that he was real and that I was real; a grounding method, of sorts, if that makes sense.



I heard a tap on my window. A single tap, nothing more and nothing less. My head ripped to where my window relaxed, eyes focused and body guarded. There were no words. Minutes passed on like that, in that tense quiet ‚Äì then two more. Ta-tap, tap. A part of me felt afraid that I wouldn‚Äôt hear anything else afterwards because the sound of my frantic heart started to quickly drown out everything else around me.



‚ÄúWillow? Willow-bee, my baby.‚Äù A familiar voice ran through in a muffled tone, meeting my brain with such softness and sweetness.



‚ÄúMama?‚Äù I could barely say the word, it felt so unreal.



Immediately, I dropped my moose and stood up from my couch. My feet rushed my body over to the window in an instant. I tore open the blinds and gazed past the panes.



Nothing.



‚ÄúMa? Mom?‚Äù I called out to her, to what I believed to be her. I knew her voice and there was no mistaking it.



And then there she was, as clear as day. Like the brightest sun I had seen since forever, since I could remember; my mom, my hope. She had appeared before me, materialized like a miracle. My happiness drowned out any shed of doubt and I sobbed. Tears flooded themselves past my wet eyes and stained my cheeks in raw glee. Oh, how I had missed her. My mommy. She had finally come to get me out of this dark place ‚Äì finally.



‚ÄúI‚Äôm here now. I‚Äôm here, my sweet girl.‚Äù Her voice was like a fresh spring breeze that filled my lungs and made my heart walk on air. She smiled at me. It felt so reassuring.



Her fine-textured chestnut hair was cut to her jaw and her rounded blue eyes held me in an apologetic gaze. She had fair skin, like my own. She wore a baggy t-shirt that displayed some random brand-logo, with complimentary sweatpants. White socks with black slip-on shoes. She looked a mess, but she was my mom and she had always dressed for comfort. She stood in front of the window and adjusted a pair of thick rimmed glasses that rested on the bridge of her nose. My reflection cast a greeting to me from both the window pane and her lenses.



‚ÄúMa, what happened? Where were you? Where‚Äôs Sam?‚Äù A million questions flooded past my lips and outwards. My words fumbled and stumbled, coming out over one another in a quick mess. I had to speak through my tears.



‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs safe to talk like this, Will. Why don‚Äôt you let me in and then we can talk all you want?‚Äù My mom glanced at where my front door stood before looking back to me, her expression seemingly expectant.



And I moved towards the door for a second, but then stopped. My eyes scanned over my mom.



What first got me was the cleanliness of her glasses, which were usually smudged. The skin of her lips looked clean and freshly glossed over with a chapstick; however, she routinely chewed on the skin until it blistered. Her fingernails leaked past the skin of her fingers, almost primed to perfect length, but I remember always getting on her for biting her nails until they bled. She‚Äôd said that she wanted to grow her hair out, so why was it so neatly trimmed? Her eyes didn‚Äôt have their usual bags, her freckles were missing, the stains to her teeth were nowhere to be seen.



I told myself that I was just overthinking things. Maybe I just didn‚Äôt remember her as well as I had thought. Perhaps the stress of everything was tricking me into doubting her, but then her smile faltered and her face twitched in a way a human‚Äôs shouldn‚Äôt.



I knew my mom ‚Äì and this *wasn‚Äôt* her.



All hope fled my body and I gulped down a knot that had been building deep within my esophagus. It was denial. There was nothing more that I wanted to do than open my front door and receive both love and affection from my mom, but that wasn‚Äôt going to happen. Not at all. Instead of love and affection, it would have been pain and misery. That notion was only further strengthened as the silence persisted, and what had once been an almost perfect image of my mother, instead began to froth and bubble.



‚ÄúOpen the door,‚Äù it ordered. It ordered this to me in the sound of my mom‚Äôs voice and I choked back what I could only describe as a wail.



It repeated this sentiment, but soon the voice blurred and melted into rhythmic chirps until I could no longer recognize any kind of human vocalization. It was completely unfamiliar now. And even though that was the case, the creature continued to click its incessant noises at me. It repeated the guttural taps of pleas and orders, but I began to tune it out. It wasn‚Äôt the noises of this thing that caught my attention. It was the sight of it shedding my mother‚Äôs visage.



Like a popsicle melting on a warm summer‚Äôs day, her skin failed to hold. White leather trickled from top to bottom, rolling down into a heap, falling into itself with wet slaps and disjointed cracks. A crevice tore open at the apex of her head ‚Äì and like a baby being born, a bald gray skull emerged from the bubbling skin of my mother‚Äôs flesh-suit. An obsidian black ick oozed out from where I could still see the false mother‚Äôs squished mouth and eyes, her glasses toppling down onto the ground with a clatter, as this beast blossomed from out of her. A gray mass of unnatural flesh, budding like a flower.



The smell of the tar leaked out past the window of my home, which earned a repulsed gag from me. It smelt of asphalt and burning wood, but more than that; iron and waste. A bile burnt within my throat and I gaped my mouth, turning to vomit. Afterwards, I couldn‚Äôt help but turn my attention back to the disgusting birth of this horrific and unholy thing.



Once the head was out, its arms came next. And that was when I unconsciously moved my hands and gripped ahold of the nearby curtains, shutting them. My feet moved on their own, my mind blank; or maybe too full. It was like a blur, my vision hazy and unfocused. Tear stained cheeks were re-stained, but my previous sobs of joy were replaced with silence. My footsteps echoed throughout my home, my wristwatch ticking, and the creature outside clicking. I walked to my kitchen to grab the cans and bottles of water that Lorelai had left me, moving them to the bathroom that connected to my bedroom.



Once my bathroom was stocked with enough resources, I trudged back into the living room to collect my moose from off of the couch, where I had left him. He was still there, laying motionlessly upon the soft beige of the furniture. His empty eyes stared at nothing and for a moment, I wished that he and I could trade places. My soul longed for an escape ‚Äì isolation.



The tapping from outside my window regained my attention and I blinked in the focus that had previously left me. I grabbed a tight hold of my moose and rushed back to my bathroom. It was there where I would wait for what seemed like an eternity, hoping ‚Äì and even praying, that the remnant of whoever that was would go away.



I have no idea how long I stayed holed away in the bathroom. The loss of time was due to my own clouded judgement and the fear behind it. The ticking of my wristwatch sounded all too familiar and so I smashed it with the heel of my shoe at one point, only to immediately regret it afterwards. Sam had gifted it to me. As quickly as it was smashed to pieces, I bent down to fix the glass back in its place. This only resorted in the tiny and sharp shards cutting at the skin of my fingers. Dozens of little papercuts later and the watch remained broken. This devastated me and I think a piece of me died along with that watch.



My sleep was shallow and broken when in the bathroom. Every single sound from outside sent me stiff with panic. I flinched at creaks in the walls, convinced that those things had grown cleverer, quieter. I uttered not a single word, fearing that perhaps they could hear me, or sense me. I had no idea how their kind worked and that fact terrified me. I silently wept with my face buried in my moose‚Äôs matted brown fur until I eventually ran out of tears. He smelt like home. Like childhood and of a time that had once brought me warmth. It felt almost wrong to stain him with snot and quiet sobs, but we had been through it plenty of times before. We could do it again.



Eventually, after what had to have been a few days, the fear subsided into a mind-numbing buzz. It was present, but tolerable now. The taps and clicks of the cathedral‚Äôs shadow-enveloped denizens stopped. That thick, oozing presence had left ‚Äì at least, for now, it seemed; however, it did not take its dread with it. The air still felt heavy. My windows still felt watched. My parents were still gone.



For a while afterwards, things almost seemed to return to normal. Days bled into weeks. My track of time was a mess, even though I tried to tally the days on the toilet paper in my bathroom during my time isolated inside its walls. I doubt that it is accurate. There was an extremely tense air that hung in my home, suffocating me. I refused to speak, even to my moose. The windows were avoided and if I did sleep, I slept in the bathroom. It felt like my sanity was slipping. I would hear clicks and taps right next to my ears and see shadows in the corners of my eyes.



To make it all worse, there would sometimes be the sound of my mother‚Äôs voice in the distance. Sometimes in a different room, just far away enough. She‚Äôd be humming a familiar tune; one that was from my childhood.



And then there was a rumble of distant chirps and clicks, and my breath caught ‚Äì but no, it wasn‚Äôt what I had originally thought. It was instead the familiar sound of squeaking. It was the squeaks of her cart; Lorelai‚Äôs cart. The sounds of rickety wheels greeted me and I felt a smile twitch upon my face, but she didn‚Äôt knock this time. It was like she had stopped just right outside my front door. This had almost instantly captured my attention, since it was unusual. I waited for a few minutes, anxiety and hesitation gripping a hold of me tightly. The last time I went to look outside of my house, I experienced a very deep and personal horror so unexplainable and traumatic, I had become selectively mute. The images never left my mind.



What if this was a familiar situation? Another ploy to get at me. My paranoia sucked me dry like a ravenous leech, gorging on my blood.



It looked like I‚Äôd frozen in time on that couch in the living room, staring straight ahead with a deer-in-headlights expression. After a very strenuous mental battle within my mind, I stood and then quietly made my way over to my front door. One of my eyes peered through the peephole.

Faceless Growth is EXPLODING üöÄ - Here's How to Cash In (While it Lasts),"**Stop Showing Your Face! Faceless Growth is EXPLODING üöÄ - Here's How to Cash In (While it Lasts)**

Hey, fellow AiContentAutomators! üôå

Ever thought about how many of us are just *not* vibin‚Äô with the whole ""show your face"" thing? I mean, take a moment to imagine this‚Äîwhat if you could grow an online presence, raking in the dough *without* having to hop on camera? Sounds like a dream, right? 

**Well, it‚Äôs officially a reality!** People are catching onto the fact that faceless content is not just a trend; it‚Äôs a full-blown movement! 

### So, why is this happening? ü§î

1. **Privacy Concerns**: In our digital age, who wouldn‚Äôt want to keep their personal life a bit... personal? 
2. **Introvert Power**: A lot of us aren‚Äôt born extroverts thriving on camera! I mean, give me a good book and a cup of coffee over a spotlight any day. 
3. **Content Over Personality**: Viewers are starting to value *what‚Äôs being said* more than *who‚Äôs saying it*. üó£Ô∏è

**But here‚Äôs the kicker: If you‚Äôre not cashing in on this faceless growth wave, what are you doing?!**

### Let‚Äôs break down how you can get started:

- **Use Text-to-Speech Tools**: People love listening to content while they multitask. Combine this with text overlays to create powerful, engaging videos!
  
- **Licensing Stock Footage**: For those Globetrotter vibes without the passport stamp, stock footage is your best friend. Grab clips that match your message!
  
- **Create Compelling Graphics**: Tools like Canva or Adobe Spark can help you whip up eye-catching visuals that tell your story without a single selfie!

- **Embrace Animations**: Quick tip: animating your content can keep viewers glued to their screens. Think of it as a fun way to spice things up while still avoiding that front-and-center spotlight.

### Remember the power of storytelling! üìñ

Faceless doesn‚Äôt mean boring. Think of ways to engage your audience through exciting narratives. You could tell stories about your experiences or create alternative viewpoints on different topics. Just because your face isn‚Äôt front and center doesn‚Äôt mean your personality can‚Äôt shine through!

Now, if you wanna dive even deeper into this space, I've got a little gem for you. There‚Äôs this fantastic guide [here](https://whop.com/howtoai/?a=liveitupdeals) that can equip you with tons of actionable strategies and insider tips to kickstart your faceless growth journey. Seriously, it‚Äôs like having a roadmap to golden opportunities! üåü

Faceless growth is the hot new ticket, and it‚Äôs not slowing down anytime soon‚Äîtrust me! Just look at the success stories emerging daily. 

So, who's ready to hop on this trend and thrive without turning the camera on? I‚Äôm super curious to hear your thoughts on this whole faceless phenomena, or maybe some personal experiences you‚Äôve had.

1m7g90b,https://www.reddit.com/r/deepnightsociety/comments/1m7g90b/i_am_a_terrible_serial_killer/,I Am A Terrible Serial Killer,"When I say I‚Äôm a terrible serial killer, I don‚Äôt mean that I‚Äôve been caught and I‚Äôm spending endless amounts of time in jail, writing this from some stolen cell phone I procured from another man‚Äôs anus. In fact, there hasn‚Äôt even been the slightest bit of suspicion about my involvement in the numerous deaths I have caused. So, you might be asking yourself what makes me a terrible serial killer. Isn‚Äôt the point of serial killing that you can produce a large amount of death and disarray without ever being caught? 

And this is where I would disagree with you because I see this as more of an art form, a glorious way to express myself among regular, boring people. I mean, really, what am I supposed to be doing with my time‚Äîplaying golf, shuffleboard, or jerking off your uncle behind a Kmart, if those even still exist anymore? I don‚Äôt want to deal with mundane, everyday life! I want to deal with the beauty of the macabre, and I have spent years researching the best methods from Jack the Ripper, Dahmer, and Gacy. You name them, I‚Äôve researched them, fully discovering every intricacy of their divine masterpieces. 

Yet, when it comes to my killing, it‚Äôs devoid of anything original. I have the basics down: a steady means of employment (I‚Äôm not going to tell you what I do for a living‚Äîjust make something up, an accountant, a retarded Walmart greeter, or hell, even a gay guy that works at Ulta, I don‚Äôt care), functional relationships, and respect in the community. Where the issues started to arise was when deciding what type of killer I would become. I started, of course, with sadomasochism.

There was this girl back in my younger college days who used to get out of Pilates or some other homo-eccentric exercise activity around the same time I would be getting my morning Americano from my favorite coffee shop. 

She was 5‚Äô9‚Äù with long brown hair she kept in a ponytail that drew focus to her radiant blue eyes and incredibly symmetric features. Not very big tits, though‚Äîprobably a B-cup‚Äîbut her honed ass made up for what she was lacking in the front, I guess. Weeks progressed as I sparked up light conversation with her, maintaining a comfortable space between us, ensuring not to breach that line of being too eager. That is, until the day she laughed at one of my comedic quips and followed her giggle with placing her delicate hand on my left bicep. 

At this point, I procured her phone number, and the game was on. I informed her to meet me at the mall where we would go to the late showing of some romantic comedy that was probably devoid of anything resembling actual ‚Äòcomedy.‚Äô Not that I planned on either of us ever seeing the wacky love shenanigans of Sandra Bullock that particular night. It is surprisingly easy to kidnap a person; timing and chloroform are really the only tools a person needs. 

The small-tit brunette was no different‚Äîwithin a matter of seconds of exiting her car, she was unconscious and stuffed in the dark recesses of her own trunk. She was awake and screaming as we pulled into my secluded domain. This, my dear reader, is where I came to the profound realization that I really don‚Äôt enjoy rape‚Äîtoo much screaming and thrashing for one to truly enjoy themselves. 

The whole experience was just so migraine-inducing that I gave up before completion and smashed her head in with the closest thing in my vicinity, which happened to be a grotesquely huge dildo. It was meant for when I displayed the body to symbolize the sexual depravity of Western culture, but instead, I used it as a fucking hammer‚Ä¶ how humiliating. 

Suffice to say, I buried her in an 8-foot hole and filled it in with concrete‚Äîalas, completely boring. Upon this devastating failure and the discovery of how easy it was to obtain humans, I started my journey for my next victim.

It was about a week later when I met a fit blonde with big tits and a nice ass while hiking in a national park. She was what I think gave Hitler wet dreams and led him toward his genocidal direction. I knew from that moment, in the midst of our back-and-forth flirtatious dialogue, she would be the perfect candidate for my art project. 

As we descended the mountain, the sexual energy was radiating off us. If you had accidentally brushed past us, I am fairly certain you would succumb to early Homo erectus urges. I couldn‚Äôt have envisioned a better scenario; I had a girl begging to go to her final destination. We had sex in my Escalade‚Äîwonderful, consensual sex. This kind of screaming I did enjoy. 

When we finished, she lay on top of me, quivering in pure ecstasy. This is when I injected her with a horse tranquilizer and hauled her to my fortress of solitude. When she awoke, she was strapped naked to a table, and instead of screaming, she just cried silently as she stared into my eyes, understanding that the man she, for a moment, loved would now take her life. That is exactly what I did. With one hand, I covered her mouth and nose as the life went out of her eyes, which never looked away. 

This is when I discovered necrophilia isn‚Äôt my jam either. Nothing makes you go limp like humping a gray mound of flesh, no matter what hole I tried. Sigh, another absolute failure, and I thought this one was a home run. I even gave her a test run, and it worked out perfectly, but back to the drawing board again.

Before I leave you for now, I just want to clarify one thing: I do have some rules. I don‚Äôt do drugs, and I don‚Äôt mess with kids. I might be a monster, but I‚Äôm not a pedophile.",0,1753293419.0,deepnightsociety,0,0.5,False

Gonna fudge the details a bit for anonymity's sake, but it's the final round (cleared the technicals) and it's a few hours long (\~3 hours), grabbing a meal with the team, etc. From what I understand it's essentially a vibe check and they said they'd want a feel for how I'd work with the team, so the goal should be as personable as possible.

1m7g3k6,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1m7g3k6/am_i_crazy_is_this_normal/,Am I crazy?? Is this normal?!,"Okay sooo I‚Äôm 15F and well I‚Äôm kind of worried about something.

I have certains hallucinations I guess? Now they might be completely normal but it is worth asking.

Additional infos : I am diagnosed with asd level 1 and mild dyspraxia. I have a lot of other symptoms that hint to potential mental health issues.

* Okay so first we got the noise hallucinations. Those hallucinations are mostly stuff like hearing someone calling my name when I‚Äôm completely alone, hearing footsteps, hearing whispers‚Ä¶. A bunch of creepy sounds that truly make me feel really scared at times.
* Visual hallucinations : Well just a few minutes ago I was sitting on the couch going through TikTok, when I saw something kinda human shaped moving in the corner of my eye, my heart jumped and I turned my head to see if someone was there but there was nothing. Just the jacket of my father on a chair. Turned my attention back to my phone, jumping on reddit because it reminded me to talk about the hallucinations and then suddenly I SAW IT AGAIN. It was clearly something or someone moving. At least thats what I saw. Well this phenomenon had happened to me quite often, most of the time with shadows at night, and it makes me freak out truly.
* Physical hallucinations: Simple thing, little taps or grazing against my skin, despite being alone. And also feeling my phone vibrates when it didnt.
* Smell hallucinations: For example : smelling gaz, or something burning, then going to ask someone else about it and them telling me theres absolutely no smell. Sometimes I also get pleasant smells such as coffee.

Why didn‚Äôt I talk about it earlier even if its been happening for a while now ? Well pretty simple. I believe in ghosts. Like completely. So I assumed that the shadows, the physical and the noises could be explained by the presence of a spirit. And the smells? Assumed it was some sort of smell memory that randomly activated itself.

Now, I randomly fell on a post a few days ago that explained the exact same symptoms‚Ä¶. But it was someone saying that it was related to their BPD. 

And considering I have other symptoms, I just wanted to ask if those things are normal or potentially related to anything.

I search the internet and find different things everywhere I look. It's a 549x122 Intex, with a type A cartridge filter, which is on for 6 hours every day. The cartridge gets very dirty, and I clean it every 2 days and try to change it every 2 weeks, but I feel like it doesn't keep the pool clean. I filled the pool with water, adjusted the pH, and did a shock chlorination. Now I'm maintaining it with maintenance chlorine and checking the pH every 3 days. The problem is that I live in the countryside, the bottom of the pool gets full of dust, and the pool cleaner I bought (Bestway AquaTech) catches bugs from the bottom of the pool, and big things, but the dust or dirt passes through the filter and returns to the water again (the cleaner is not plugged into the purifier, it has a compartment where the dirt stays). I am desperate because of this dust or dirt, I thought about putting a large coffee filter inside the cleaner filter, but I don't know if it's a good idea... Now for example it is dirtier than usual because I have not used it for almost a week (the weather is bad here) and I keep removing the things that float but I can't clean the bottom until I get in because the cleaner is not very long... Does anyone recommend something?

I am building an AI learning engine called Glia ‚Äî an app that personalizes learning journeys. Over time, Glia learns about the user‚Äôs unique curiosity patterns and existing knowledge and curates the learning content and experience for the user.¬†

Glia‚Äôs mission is to democratize learning for everyone ‚Äì in the world of AI, education has the power to become more and more personalized, and we deserve better learning tools that can help us grow into fuller versions of ourselves. We want to build a humanistic experience for the natural rhythm of learning.

People are already spending so much time seeking intellectual stimulation - they're just doing it inefficiently through random content consumption (social media, scattered articles, long podcast queues, etc.). Glia wants to replace that fragmented experience with an AI companion that learns how the user thinks and maps out learning curricula ‚Äì as personalized as Spotify Discover, as accessible as Duolingo.

We are in private beta, get an invite code here:¬†[www.gliahq.com](http://www.gliahq.com/)¬†

I‚Äôm looking for a cofounder who is passionate about:

* Education!¬†
* Formation of knowledge and how we learn
* Building next-generation ed-tech that is creative, beautiful, and humanistic
* Shaping the future of human-computer interface

‚Ä¶ with technical skills that can build from 0 to 1 to 100:

* AI engineering
* Preferably full-stack dev ‚Äì but we can always learn together!
* Passion
* Creativity
* **Cracked**¬†energy
* Kindness¬†
* Authenticity¬†



**About me**

I see myself as a polymath who loves creative problem-solving. With a relentless curiosity about how the world works, I dedicate myself to work that shapes it for the better. Technology has made our societies flourish, but I also care deeply about the more nuanced kind of human flourishing ‚Äì art, wellness, and unlocking individual possibilities.

I‚Äôve worked in UI/UX since I was 19 (first as an UX lead at a startup backed by Alibaba). I‚Äôve also worked in foresight and business consulting, economic research, writing, community-building, etc.¬†

I write on Substack, you can find more of my thoughts and values there:¬†[https://substack.com/@ericahu](https://substack.com/@ericahu)¬†

And my LinkedIn:¬†[https://www.linkedin.com/in/erica-hu/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/erica-hu/)¬†



**On the agenda**

* Currently fundraising for seed round ($500k) with some commits
* Beta 2.0 is launching at the end of July!
* Partnerships on the horizon
* We also have a podcast, and I‚Äôm building more quality content for Glia
* Co-working space at LSE GenDen (for alumni founders)
* ‚Ä¶

It‚Äôs been quite a journey as a solo founder ‚Äì lots to celebrate, but lots more to strive for, but imagine how much we‚Äôd accomplish as a dream team :)

**Location: London**

This one is really important. We have to be able to work in person for the synergy sparks!

Inside the dim bus cabin, Owen Lake stared out the window, headphones in, but no music playing. He‚Äôd had enough of music for the night.

They were halfway through a small-venue tour across Canada‚Äîhis first international gig. Eight cities, twelve nights, cheap motels, enthusiastic strangers, and a dream that had seemed unreachable just a year ago. Yet here he was. Twenty-four years old. Guitarist. Singer-songwriter. Spotify-buzz artist. And for the first time in his life, tired of every chord.

He barely noticed when Connor, his manager and best friend since high school, slid into the booth across from him.

‚ÄúYou get my text?‚Äù Connor asked.

Owen took an earbud out. ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

Connor hesitated, looked down at his phone. Then met Owen‚Äôs eyes. ‚ÄúYour dad passed away.‚Äù

Owen didn‚Äôt speak. His face didn‚Äôt move. He just looked at Connor, unblinking.

‚ÄúIt was a heart attack. He was found yesterday. Some neighbor hadn‚Äôt seen him for a while. It‚Äôs been on the news back in Indiana‚Äîsmall-town stuff, you know how it is.‚Äù

Owen blinked once, slowly. ‚ÄúRight.‚Äù

Silence fell again. Connor reached for Owen‚Äôs hand, then pulled back.

‚ÄúYou okay, man?‚Äù

‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt seen him in twelve years,‚Äù Owen said, almost absently. ‚ÄúHe stopped calling when I turned twelve. After the custody thing. We didn‚Äôt even fight. He just‚Ä¶ stopped being there.‚Äù

Connor nodded. ‚ÄúYeah. I remember.‚Äù

Owen looked out the window again. ‚ÄúWhat am I supposed to do? Fly home? Cry? Write a song?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù Connor said. ‚ÄúI just thought you should know.‚Äù


---

The venue in Calgary was a dive bar with a stage no bigger than a parking space. The audience was rowdy and mostly drunk. Owen performed as if on autopilot, his fingers running through songs they‚Äôd rehearsed a thousand times. But something was missing‚Äîan edge, a soul. He was detached, lost somewhere between G major and grief.

After the show, he locked himself in the bathroom and stared into the mirror for a long time. His eyes looked hollow. His chest felt heavy, but not with sadness. More like confusion. Like mourning someone he never truly knew.

When he returned to the green room, a girl was waiting there with a vinyl copy of his EP and a smile that barely reached her eyes.

‚ÄúHey,‚Äù she said, nervous. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt usually do this. I just wanted to say‚Ä¶ your song ‚ÄòChasing Stillness‚Äô got me through my dad‚Äôs death last year. So‚Ä¶ thank you.‚Äù

Owen stared at her. His throat tightened.

‚ÄúYou okay?‚Äù she asked.

He signed the record, forced a smile, and mumbled, ‚ÄúYeah. I‚Äôm fine.‚Äù

But he wasn‚Äôt.


---

That night in the motel, Owen sat on the bed with his guitar across his lap. He played a few chords, searching for something raw‚Äîsomething that didn‚Äôt sound like every other song he‚Äôd written. The notes came slowly, hesitant, like a language he had forgotten.

He closed his eyes.

When he was nine, his father had taken him camping near Lake Monroe. It was one of the few good memories he still held. They‚Äôd fished all morning and burned the hot dogs they tried to cook. His dad played guitar by the fire‚Äîsomething twangy and old. Owen remembered thinking, I want to be like that. I want to make those sounds.

The next year, his parents divorced.

The next year after that, his dad stopped visiting altogether.

Owen‚Äôs fingers slowed, and the chords dissolved into silence.


---

The next day, Connor drove them to Banff.

‚ÄúI booked you two nights there,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúNo show. No press. Just‚Ä¶ nature.‚Äù

Owen raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúSince when do you care about nature?‚Äù

Connor shrugged. ‚ÄúSince I saw your soul dying on stage last night. You need to unplug.‚Äù

Banff was breathtaking. Snowy peaks. Blue lakes. Tourists bundled in coats. Owen wandered the icy streets with a beanie pulled low and hands deep in his coat pockets. No one recognized him. It felt like relief.

That evening, they sat in a small caf√© near the mountains. Owen nursed a cup of black coffee, staring into it like it held some kind of answer.

‚ÄúDid he ever try to reach out?‚Äù he asked suddenly.

Connor looked up. ‚ÄúYour dad?‚Äù

Owen nodded.

Connor sighed. ‚ÄúA couple years ago. He messaged me on Facebook. Asked about you. I didn‚Äôt answer.‚Äù

Owen looked up, surprised.

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt think he deserved to know how well you were doing,‚Äù Connor added. ‚ÄúGuess that was petty.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Owen said. ‚ÄúI think‚Ä¶ I think I get it.‚Äù

They sat in silence again. Outside, it began to snow.


---

The funeral was scheduled for the following week in Bloomington, Indiana.

Owen didn‚Äôt go.

Instead, he stood on the frozen shore of Lake Louise, guitar case slung over his shoulder, boots crunching in the snow. He found a bench near the edge and sat down. The cold bit at his fingers, but he pulled out his guitar anyway.

He played something soft. Something honest. Words came, almost without thought.

> You were a silhouette in smoke,
A name on a box I never opened,
But I remember the fire by the lake,
The way you laughed before you broke it.



> I chased your shadow into song,
Tried to strum you back into my arms,
But the chorus ends before the truth,
And the bridge was burned with youth.



Tears slipped down his cheeks before he realized they were there.

He wasn‚Äôt crying for his father, not exactly.

He was crying for the nine-year-old boy who thought he was worth staying for.


---

The tour resumed in Vancouver.

By now, the news of his father‚Äôs death had trickled into the press. Music blogs called it a ‚Äúrevelation moment‚Äù for Owen Lake. ‚ÄúThe young indie star grappling with grief in real time.‚Äù

Fans brought letters to the merch table. Stories. Sympathy. A girl handed him a bracelet and said, ‚ÄúMy dad left, too.‚Äù

And Owen began to understand that his pain, while uniquely his, echoed in others. There was a kind of connection in shared absence.

One night, after a show, he posted a song to social media‚Äîa rough cut of the one he‚Äôd written by Lake Louise. No studio polish. No backing track. Just him, a single take, and cold wind hissing in the background.

It went viral in a day.


---

The last stop of the tour was Toronto. A packed mid-sized theater with real acoustics and a hushed, expectant crowd. Connor stood in the wings as Owen tuned his guitar.

‚ÄúYou ready?‚Äù he asked.

Owen nodded.

On stage, the lights were warm. The mic buzzed faintly. Owen looked out at the sea of faces‚Äîstrangers who knew his words better than he did.

He played the usual set, but at the end, he paused.

‚ÄúThis next song isn‚Äôt on any album,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not even finished. But I wrote it for someone I didn‚Äôt really know. Someone who gave me music, and then disappeared. It‚Äôs for the man I called Dad. And maybe for anyone who‚Äôs missing someone who should‚Äôve stayed.‚Äù

He played slowly. Every note rang true.

The silence that followed was absolute.

Then the audience stood and applauded‚Äînot out of politeness, but out of something deeper.

Recognition. Resonance.


---

Back in the green room, Connor handed him a letter. ‚ÄúThis came from the lawyer handling your dad‚Äôs estate.‚Äù

Owen opened it carefully.

Inside was a handwritten note. Sloppy. Messy. Unsent.

> Owen,
I saw you on TV the other night. You look like your mother, but you play like me. I don‚Äôt expect forgiveness. I just want you to know‚ÄîI was proud. Even from a distance. I‚Äôm sorry I wasn‚Äôt more.
‚ÄîDad



Owen folded the note and tucked it into his guitar case.


---

Months later, when his second album released, the title track was Letters I Never Got to Read.

It was different from his debut. Rawer. More stripped down. Less indie pop, more soul-baring folk.

It charted in five countries.

Critics called it ‚Äúa generational cry for connection.‚Äù

But Owen didn‚Äôt care about the praise.

He cared about the letters fans sent. The stories of loss. Of reunion. Of forgiveness.

He read them all.

Because maybe, through music, we get to say the things we never said.

And maybe, if we‚Äôre lucky, someone hears.

Even if they‚Äôre already gone.

In fact, there hasn‚Äôt even been the slightest bit of suspicion about my involvement in the numerous deaths I have caused. So, you might be asking yourself what makes me a terrible serial killer. Isn‚Äôt the point of serial killing that you can produce a large amount of death and disarray without ever being caught? 

And this is where I would disagree with you because I see this as more of an art form, a glorious way to express myself among regular, boring people. I mean, really, what am I supposed to be doing with my time‚Äîplaying golf, shuffleboard, or jerking off your uncle behind a Kmart, if those even still exist anymore? I don‚Äôt want to deal with mundane, everyday life! I want to deal with the beauty of the macabre, and I have spent years researching the best methods from Jack the Ripper, Dahmer, and Gacy. You name them, I‚Äôve researched them, fully discovering every intricacy of their divine masterpieces. 

Yet, when it comes to my killing, it‚Äôs devoid of anything original. I have the basics down: a steady means of employment (I‚Äôm not going to tell you what I do for a living‚Äîjust make something up, an accountant, a retarded Walmart greeter, or hell, even a gay guy that works at Ulta, I don‚Äôt care), functional relationships, and respect in the community. Where the issues started to arise was when deciding what type of killer I would become. I started, of course, with sadomasochism.

There was this girl back in my younger college days who used to get out of Pilates or some other homo-eccentric exercise activity around the same time I would be getting my morning Americano from my favorite coffee shop. 

She was 5‚Äô9‚Äù with long brown hair she kept in a ponytail that drew focus to her radiant blue eyes and incredibly symmetric features. Not very big tits, though‚Äîprobably a B-cup‚Äîbut her honed ass made up for what she was lacking in the front, I guess. Weeks progressed as I sparked up light conversation with her, maintaining a comfortable space between us, ensuring not to breach that line of being too eager. That is, until the day she laughed at one of my comedic quips and followed her giggle with placing her delicate hand on my left bicep. 

At this point, I procured her phone number, and the game was on. I informed her to meet me at the mall where we would go to the late showing of some romantic comedy that was probably devoid of anything resembling actual ‚Äòcomedy.‚Äô Not that I planned on either of us ever seeing the wacky love shenanigans of Sandra Bullock that particular night. It is surprisingly easy to kidnap a person; timing and chloroform are really the only tools a person needs. 

The small-tit brunette was no different‚Äîwithin a matter of seconds of exiting her car, she was unconscious and stuffed in the dark recesses of her own trunk. She was awake and screaming as we pulled into my secluded domain. This, my dear reader, is where I came to the profound realization that I really don‚Äôt enjoy rape‚Äîtoo much screaming and thrashing for one to truly enjoy themselves. 

The whole experience was just so migraine-inducing that I gave up before completion and smashed her head in with the closest thing in my vicinity, which happened to be a grotesquely huge dildo. It was meant for when I displayed the body to symbolize the sexual depravity of Western culture, but instead, I used it as a fucking hammer‚Ä¶ how humiliating. 

Suffice to say, I buried her in an 8-foot hole and filled it in with concrete‚Äîalas, completely boring. Upon this devastating failure and the discovery of how easy it was to obtain humans, I started my journey for my next victim.

It was about a week later when I met a fit blonde with big tits and a nice ass while hiking in a national park. She was what I think gave Hitler wet dreams and led him toward his genocidal direction. I knew from that moment, in the midst of our back-and-forth flirtatious dialogue, she would be the perfect candidate for my art project. 

As we descended the mountain, the sexual energy was radiating off us. If you had accidentally brushed past us, I am fairly certain you would succumb to early Homo erectus urges. I couldn‚Äôt have envisioned a better scenario; I had a girl begging to go to her final destination. We had sex in my Escalade‚Äîwonderful, consensual sex. This kind of screaming I did enjoy. 

When we finished, she lay on top of me, quivering in pure ecstasy. This is when I injected her with a horse tranquilizer and hauled her to my fortress of solitude. When she awoke, she was strapped naked to a table, and instead of screaming, she just cried silently as she stared into my eyes, understanding that the man she, for a moment, loved would now take her life. That is exactly what I did. With one hand, I covered her mouth and nose as the life went out of her eyes, which never looked away. 

This is when I discovered necrophilia isn‚Äôt my jam either. Nothing makes you go limp like humping a gray mound of flesh, no matter what hole I tried. Sigh, another absolute failure, and I thought this one was a home run. I even gave her a test run, and it worked out perfectly, but back to the drawing board again.

We‚Äôre not talking ‚Äútrip and fall‚Äù hazard, more ‚ÄúI have to slow my wheelchair down because of the bump‚Äù. This is a huge cost to replace these barely used sidewalks (meanwhile, his taxes are frozen as a senior citizen). He‚Äôs been trespassed from city property for disorderly behavior too. 

To make matters worse, he‚Äôs also a huge snitch and reports houses for minor code violations. This is a huge source of frustration to people around town, of course. 

This morning, I was helping my wife and daughter out to the car. I see boomer screech up to the stop sign, pull out his phone, and start taking pictures of my house. My family is present, no one is in immediate danger, so it doesn‚Äôt warrant me getting belligerent and hostile, but somebody taking pictures of the house my wife and daughter live in is really creepy and it warrants a response.

I am building an AI learning engine called Glia ‚Äî an app that personalizes learning journeys. Over time, Glia learns about the user‚Äôs unique curiosity patterns and existing knowledge and curates the learning content and experience for the user.¬†

Glia‚Äôs mission is to democratize learning for everyone ‚Äì in the world of AI, education has the power to become more and more personalized, and we deserve better learning tools that can help us grow into fuller versions of ourselves. We want to build a humanistic experience for the natural rhythm of learning.

People are already spending so much time seeking intellectual stimulation - they're just doing it inefficiently through random content consumption (social media, scattered articles, long podcast queues, etc.). Glia wants to replace that fragmented experience with an AI companion that learns how the user thinks and maps out learning curricula ‚Äì as personalized as Spotify Discover, as accessible as Duolingo.



We are in private beta, get an invite code here: [www.gliahq.com](http://www.gliahq.com)¬†



I‚Äôm looking for a cofounder who is passionate about:

* Education!¬†
* Formation of knowledge and how we learn
* Building next-generation ed-tech that is creative, beautiful, and humanistic

* AI engineering
* Preferably full-stack dev ‚Äì but we can always learn together!
* Passion
* Creativity
* **Cracked** energy
* Kindness¬†
* Authenticity¬†



**About me**

I see myself as a polymath who loves creative problem-solving. With a relentless curiosity about how the world works, I dedicate myself to work that shapes it for the better. Technology has made our societies flourish, but I also care deeply about the more nuanced kind of human flourishing ‚Äì art, wellness, and unlocking individual possibilities.

I‚Äôve worked in UI/UX since I was 19 (first as an UX lead at a startup backed by Alibaba). I‚Äôve also worked in foresight and business consulting, economic research, writing, community-building, etc.¬†

I write on Substack, you can find more of my thoughts and values there: [https://substack.com/@ericahu](https://substack.com/@ericahu)¬†

On the agenda

* Currently fundraising for seed round ($500k) with some commits
* Beta 2.0 is launching at the end of July!
* Partnerships on the horizon
* We also have a podcast, and I‚Äôm building more quality content for Glia
* Co-working space at LSE GenDen (for alumni founders)
* ‚Ä¶

It‚Äôs been quite a journey as a solo founder ‚Äì lots to celebrate, but lots more to strive for, but imagine how much we‚Äôd accomplish as a dream team :)

1m7fpyw,https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/1m7fpyw/i_was_asked_to_donate_money_on_the_street_and/,"I was asked to donate money on the street, and when I explained I'm lonely & poor they weren't interested.","# This has happened to me so often... today, a couple of loud young men in their early 20s looking very formidable, stopped me in the street to ask for money for charity. I explained I don't have money & they replied ""we have a card machine!"", pushing a contactless card machine into my face. I don't understand how a card machine magically gives me money- perhaps they thought I meant I don't have cash on me, but do have money? I explained that I don't have money as I'm poor & struggling, but told them if they're looking to do a good deed, time is often more valuable than money - I'm extremely lonely and would appreciate a simple coffee chat at a cafe. They declined & once they realised I'm too poor to donate, they continued harassing other people for money.

# I've noticed this a lot... have you noticed how the only time strangers stop you is to ask for something... money for charity, some product, a petition‚Ä¶ whatever..  I‚Äôm broke. I'm struggling. And yet nobody ever stops you just to be kind, have a chat, or offer a coffee. If you're poor, people don‚Äôt¬†give¬†you anything... they just ignore you & move on to the next target. What happened to basic humanity?

# People in my area (in London) seem to volunteer to do those jobs (stopping strangers to ask for money) without realising they might actually be doing more harm than good.. for every person they guilt into donating, there are dozens more they leave feeling worse about themselves for not being able to afford to give anything. A huge chunk of those donations likely ends up funding salaries for people at the top of the charity instead of helping those in need. Ironically... if these volunteers just worked a normal job for the same amount of time and donated the money THEY EARN directly to those in need, they‚Äôd probably make a bigger difference financially (and without making poor people feel worse along the way!)

# Btw, I stop strangers to ask if they'd like a coffee chat at a local cafe to try to counter-act this negativity & I'd like to suggest everyone else do the same! Fight back this selfishness with kindness... sadly a lot say no because they think I'm trying to trick them or ask for money, but I won't stop injecting the world with kindness like this... please, if you have courage do the same & maybe we can change the world... one small step at a time...

1m7fnep,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m7fnep,Boycott Zomato (Night scam),"From the past few months, I have noticed something from the side of Zomato. They have cut down the customer support staff and replaced them with bots.

While this might be a good move for company but it is not a good move for people. The delivery partners have started a new scam in ahmedabad. 

I have been a victim of this problem twice, so today I ordered a Tall Hot chocolate from Starbucks since It was a deal on zomato (After the first scam I got from Navrangpura subway, I decided to avoid zomato but since it was an exclusive deal I decided to give it a try I mean how you can be scammed twice right ?). I paid the order via UPI. 

The delivery partners accept the order and after picking it up mark it as delivered and stop picking up calls. I tried calling him multiple times and he refused to pick up my call. I don't what he did whether kept his phone silent or something. What is weird that this has happened twice in the span on 1 month. They are deliberately doing this with late night orders. I had to ring up the zomato bot for 40 minutes after it budged me to connect to a customer support. The bot gave up mid conversation 3 times and later it let me connect to a customer support staff. I did got my refund in both cases. In this case it was 40 minutes while in the Subway case I had this the wait time was 2 hours. I wasted all of my time for around 300 rs. The case is not about money, It feels personal. I feel like an idiot that I fell for it the second time.

From now on whoever wants to order zomato late at night do it Cash on delivery. In this way atleast your time will not be wasted. Or don't use the app at all instead use any other app. (I will be trying Swiggy shortly). For restaurants like Domino's and Mc'donalds use their own apps, They give heavy discounts and take accountability seriously. Call and order your local restaurants directly. I urge other people to not to make the same mistakes as I did. I am attaching the proofs of the conversations and call histories along with my account that I am a regular customer and not a scammer. Beware of this fraud. 

Also P.S.- I have a pediatric exam tomorrow and this wasted my time so it was really testing my patience. I only had this kind of rude language with the bot only not the actual customer support guy. Shout out to Zaid to coming in clutch even after 40 minutes I guess I got my refund but still that was a long time.",6,1753292063.0,ahmedabad,3,0.88,False

And me? They dumped me in some crappy apartment like garbage.  
Mom: ""$150 a month is plenty. Don't waste it.""  
Dad: ""Girls with too much money get in trouble. $150? Enough!""  
That's how my endless part-time job life started.  
But life is unpredictable‚Äîon a day when I hadn't been paid and was running a fever, I agonized before calling my parents to borrow money for medicine.  
Mom: ""I just paid three hundred for your stepbrother's piano lesson! You think I'm made of money? Leave me alone!""  
Dad: ""Another excuse for cash? Have some shame! Just started college and already begging for handouts! Deal with it yourself!""  
Years later, I'm driving my Porsche to work when my long-lost parents suddenly show up:  
""Yara, Mommy was wrong.""  
""Daddy was wrong too.""  
Oh really? Well then, let's break down exactly what you did wrong...  
  
I folded my college acceptance letter neatly and stuffed it into my faded jacket pocket.  
  
Just thirty minutes ago, Mom and Dad had waltzed in with their fresh-off-the-press divorce decree, slapping the keys down on the dust-covered table of this dumpy rental.  
  
""This place is yours now."" Mom fluffed her freshly permed curls. ""Your dad and I will split tuition fifty-fifty. We'll take turns with living expenses‚Äî$150 a month each. That's plenty to survive on campus.""  
  
Dad wheeled his suitcase toward the door. ""I'm moving in with Lisa. Your mom's got her new setup too. Don't go calling us every weekend.""  
  
After they left, I stared at the empty apartment in a daze.  
  
$150 a month?  
  
Could I really make it work?  
  
Seemed my only option was cramming in part-time jobs during breaks‚Ä¶  
  
Before I knew it, move-in day arrived.  
  
With my hard-earned three grand plus the $150 Dad sent, I started planning‚Äî  
  
Four months this semester.  
  
$800 monthly for dorms.  
  
$200 set aside for books.  
  
So basically... four months of busting just to cover the extras, and I'm supposed to eat on that $150?!  
  
Dad's text popped up: ""Learn to budget. $150 is plenty if you're smart about it. Stop trying to keep up with everyone else's spending. Focus on your studies.""  
  
This was the first time he'd reached out since the divorce, and it read like a coupon circular.  
  
When I pushed open my dorm room door, my three roommates had already settled in.  
  
I shoved my old broken bag under the bed, the cheap plastic rustling like a freight train in the quiet room.  
  
When they all turned to stare, my face went nuclear.  
  
I ate my first dinner alone in the corner of the dining hall.  
  
Looking at the price board showing ""One meal combo: $15,"" I death-gripped the meal card in my pocket.  
  
In the end, I could only swallow hard and buy two slices of bread, choking them down with free coffee.  
  
After ten days like this, my budget notebook had ten hash marks. Each mark meant five slices of bread, with ""coffee: free"" scribbled next to them.  
  
On Wednesday, Riley, my roommate, knocked on my bed frame: ""Hey Yara, we're thinking of going in on a mini washing machine. Like one hundred each. You in?""  
  
One hundred bucks.  
  
My heart plummeted.  
  
I had exactly $120 left in my account this month.  
  
Finally, I nodded anyway, barely squeaking out: ""Sure.""  
  
The moment I hit send on that transfer, my phone showed a balance of $20.  
  
I suddenly remembered losing fifty bucks for lunch money in middle school. Dad had biked me around the neighborhood three times looking for it, then emptied his entire wallet into my backpack: ""Don't let yourself go without.""  
  
But now?  
  
Everything changed.  
  
During evening study session, the hollow ache in my stomach suddenly twisted, like someone was wringing out my insides.  
  
My study buddy Jess slid over a chocolate bar: ""Yara, Jesus, you look awful. Low blood sugar?""  
  
I tried to wave it off, but she'd already peeled the wrapper and pressed it into my palm.  
  
""Eat it.""  
  
As the chocolate melted sickeningly sweet on my tongue, my nose suddenly stung with tears.  
  
Back in the dorm, I opened our family group chat‚Äî""Happy Family Forever""‚Äîwhich had been radio silent since the divorce.  
  
The last message was still Mom's moving announcement.  
  
My fingers typed and deleted, deleted and typed like crazy.  
  
""Mom, Dad, had to chip in one hundred for a dorm washing machine. I'm completely broke for food now. Could you maybe send an extra $100 this month?""  
  
God, the words felt like red-hot iron bu//rning my fingertips.  
  
Yet the chat stayed silent all night.  
  
Next morning, Dad came out swinging: ""Money again? Have you no shame? Already picking up this nasty begging habit? Christ, I'm starting to think you're not there to study‚Äîyou're there to blow money trying to keep up with everyone else. What happened to what I told you about budgeting? You made this mess, you deal with it. Don't expect me to clean up after you!""  
  
Before I could even process that, Mom's message exploded into the chat:  
  
""Are you kidding me? I just shelled out three hundred for ONE piano lesson for your stepbrother this month. What am I, a freaking bank? A money printer?""  
  
""Besides, you're a girl‚Äîhow much could you possibly eat? I bet those fake friends of yours are corrupting you. Instead of focusing on study, all you think about is spending money! It's your stepbrother's birthday next week and I still need to buy him that gaming console. Handle your own problems and quit bothering me.""  
  
Those two messages slapped me across the face.  
  
I stared at the screen, my finger hovering over the keyboard forever, unable to type a single word.  
  
So this is what I'd become‚Äîasking for one hundred bucks made me a ""spendthrift,"" a ""leech,"" a ""blood-sucker.""  
  
My phone kept buzzing as they volleyed blame back and forth like I was some dirty soccer ball they were trying to kick away.  
  
I suddenly remembered that divorce day, how they'd stood on opposite sides of the living room.  
  
Dad saying ""I'll pay half tuition, max.""  
  
Mom saying ""Why should I be stuck with living expenses?""  
  
And there I was, standing between them like some unwanted piece of collateral damage.  
  
That gnawing hunger came roaring back, worse than before.  
  
I clutched my stomach and put my head down on the desk. My roommate gently touched my arm: ""You okay? Want to go to the health center?""  
  
I shook my head, but tears started falling anyway.  
  
Turns out $150 really doesn't cut it at a big-city university.  
  
Turns out becoming an adult means nobody cares if you're starving.  
  
Turns out parental love can fade like the ink on acceptance letters‚Äîgive it time, and it just disappears.  
  
Tomorrow I'd ask the cafeteria ladies if I could bus tables for meals. Maybe check if the campus convenience store needed night shift help.  
  
Starting tomorrow, I'd have to earn every bite of food in college.  
  
I started working the register at the campus store after classes‚Äîtwelve bucks an hour. Working eight hours on weekends just barely covered next week's food money.  
  
Walking out of the store, the night wind whipped rain into my face, brutal enough to make me shiver.  
  
""Well, well, well, little girl.""  
  
Three drunk guys stumbled out from behind some trees, reeking of booze and ciga//rettes.  
  
The blonde one squinted at my soaked shirt, his mouth twisting into a revolting grin.  
  
""All alone, sweetheart? Aw, why you running? We don't bite.""  
  
Every alarm bell in my head went off: ""Get out of my way.""  
  
""Ooh, feisty."" Blondie reached for my hoodie. ""Check it out, this chick's actually smoking hot. Way better than those fake plastic girls on campus.""  
  
Scar-face started pawing at my waist. I kicked at his shin, but he grabbed my ankle.  
  
I struggled and screamed: ""Get off me! I'm calling the cops!""  
  
Blondie laughed: ""Come have some fun with us, baby. We might even tip you better than that shitty register job.""  
  
Just as his hand reached for my shirt buttons, a flashlight beam cut through the rain and the security guard's voice boomed: ""Hey! You little punks!""  
  
Scar-face let out a curse. Blondie tried to kick me before the guard's flashlight sent them all scrambling.  
  
Back in the dorm, my roommates were already asleep.  
  
I crouched in the bathroom, lifting my hoodie in front of the mirror‚Äîa massive bruise bloomed across my lower back where they'd shoved me against the wall.  
  
Water gushed from the faucet as I covered my mouth to muffle my sobs, terrified of waking my roommates.  
  
I let the tears fall on the floor, mixing with the sound of running water.  
  
That night I sat on the edge of my bed hugging my knees, finally drifting off just before dawn.  
  
A week before midterms, our advisor posted in the class group chat: ""Class fee due: $200 for study materials and class activities.""  
  
""Yara, did you send yours yet? Deadline's tomorrow afternoon."" Megan asked while applying her face mask.  
  
I mumbled ""still working on it,"" but my ch//est felt like someone had dropped a stone on it.  
  
Desperate, I pulled up Mom's number. The second it connected, I wanted to hang up, but it was too late.  
  
""What? Make it quick, I'm helping Benny with piano practice."" Mom's voice was already annoyed, kids laughing in the background.  
  
""Mom, we have class fees due, two hundred dollars..."" My voice was barely audible.  
  
""What? More money?"" Her voice spiked. ""What are you doing at school? Got a boyfriend? Let me tell you something, Yara‚Äîdon't expect me to fund your love life!""  
  
Click.  
  
She hung up.  
  
I called Dad.  
  
It rang seven times before he picked up.  
  
A woman's voice in the background: ""Who is it?""  
  
""Dad, I need class fees, two hundred dollars...""  
  
Dad's voice was muffled, like he was hiding: ""Oh... uh... class fees... I just bought your stepsister a new phone. Can't you borrow from classmates?""  
  
His voice dropped to a whisper: ""This isn't a good time. Gotta go.""  
  
Click again.  
  
That night, while cramming finance formulas, the room suddenly spun and my textbook went flying.  
  
I woke up on a cot in the health center.  
  
The doctor's frown was deep: ""Low blood sugar plus exhaustion. Seriously, kid, what's going on? How many meals are you eating a day?""  
  
I didn't dare tell the truth, just mumbled something about forgetting to eat while studying.  
  
The doctor sighed and prescribed nutritional supplements‚Äîthirty-something dollars. My roommate beat me to the payment: ""Pay me back when you can.""  
  
Lying in my dorm bed, I scrolled through Instagram and saw Mom's post‚Äîa grid of photos from an amusement park with Benny.  
  
Caption: ""Baby's happiness is my greatest joy.""  
  
Scrolling down, I found Dad's update.  
  
He'd posted a photo of a piano‚Äîblack, obviously expensive. ""Gift for my princess. This kid's got talent, gotta nurture it.""  
  
Someone commented ""You're such a great dad,"" and he replied with a smug emoji.  
  
And here I was, unable to afford thirty dollars for supplements.  
  
I pulled out my phone and quietly muted the family group chat.  
  
The day before break when the cleaning lady came to tidy up, I was crouched in the dorm hallway counting money.  
  
Crumpled bills spread across my knees, fives and tens stacked up, the biggest one a fifty‚Äîovertime pay the bubble tea shop owner had thrown in.  
  
""Yara, seriously not going home?"" Auntie pressed a bag of apples into my hands, ""The dorms lose power during break, so stock up on food.""  
  
I carefully tucked the money back in my pocket, forcing a smile and nodding: ""Nah, saving on travel money.""  
  
Truth was, I couldn't afford a bus ticket home‚Äîafter paying next semester's $800 dorm fee, I had exactly twenty-seven dollars and thirty cents left in the tin.  
  
Christmas night, I pulled out my last slice of toast and the dregs of peanut butter‚Äîwell, this was my Christmas feast.  
  
I opened our long-silent family group chat and saw Mom had posted a video.  
  
Waves lapping at the beach, her in a floral sundress under palm trees, some guy's arm around her waist, that Benny kid holding ice cream and grinning.  
  
Caption: ""Florida winters are amazing! Benny says we have to come back every year.""  
  
Then came Dad's photos.  
  
In the living room of his new place, he was standing on a stool hanging Christmas decorations while my stepsister held up star lights from below. His new wife stood nearby filming. ""Stella helping daddy with the star lights‚Äîwhat a perfect family.""  
  
The chat messages flew by like they were competing‚ÄîMom posted seafood spreads, Dad countered with Stella's Christmas gifts; Mom bragged about Benny learning to swim, Dad showed off Stella's piano certificates.  
  
Holding my empty peanut butter can, watching all that blazing happiness, I suddenly realized they hadn't even bothered with a single ""where are you spending Christmas"" message.  
  
It's like I was never even part of this family.  
  
Those Christmas carols we sang together, the snowmen we built, all those happy moments eating roast chicken together...  
  
Were they all just dreams I made up?  
  
As I swallowed the last bite of bread, my phone lit up again.  
  
Mom posted a photo of Benny. ""Baby boy's Christmas haul: Lego set, remote control car, and a PSP. Gotta spoil the boys, right?""  
  
Dad immediately followed up with photos of his princess unwrapping gifts. ""Our little princess got the royal treatment this Christmas‚ÄîElsa dress, glass slippers, fairy tale books, and a Disney annual pass.""  
  
Fireworks suddenly exploded outside. I ran to the balcony to watch, brilliant colors reflecting off the academic building across the way like scattered gold.  
  
But even the prettiest fireworks don't last, just like some people‚Äîthey walk away and never look back.  
  
On the last day of December, I rode the bus to Mom's new place with my twenty-seven dollars and thirty cents.  
  
I'd practiced in the mirror the night before, rehearsing what I'd say.  
  
Nothing about money, nothing about feeling hurt.  
  
Just chat about school stuff, mention the new dining hall options, maybe ask if Florida sand really was softer than it looked in photos.  
  
When the security guard at the gate stopped me, I gave him Mom's name, but he shook his head: ""No Andersons in this building. Only the Millers in that unit.""  
  
It took me forever to realize‚Äîshe'd probably even changed her last name.  
  
Standing there confused on the sidewalk, I suddenly spotted a familiar figure.  
  
Mom in a fur coat, holding Benny's hand as they came out of the grocery store, her new husband trailing behind with shopping bags.",1,1753291910.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False

Chapter 1  
  
  
The day I got my college acceptance letter, my parents got divorced.  
  
  
And me? They dumped me in some crappy apartment like trash.  
  
  
Mom: ""$150 a month is plenty. Don't waste it.""

Dad: ""Another excuse for cash? Have some shame! Just started college and already begging for handouts! Deal with it yourself!""  
  
  
...  
  
  
Years later, I'm driving my Porsche to work when my long-lost parents suddenly show up:  
  
  
""Yara, Mommy was wrong.""  
  
  
""Daddy was wrong too.""  
  
  
Oh really?  
  
  
Well then, let's break down exactly what you did wrong...  
  
  
...  
  
  
I folded my college acceptance letter neatly and stuffed it into my faded jacket pocket.  
  
  
Just thirty minutes ago, Mom and Dad had waltzed in with their fresh-off-the-press divorce decree, slapping the keys down on the dust-covered table of this dumpy rental.  
  
  
""This place is yours now."" Mom fluffed her freshly permed curls. ""Your dad and I will split tuition fifty-fifty. We'll take turns with living expenses‚Äî$150 a month each. That's plenty to survive on campus.""  
  
  
Dad wheeled his suitcase toward the door. ""I'm moving in with Lisa. Your mom's got her new setup too. Don't go calling us every weekend.""  
  
  
After they left, I stared at the empty apartment in a daze.  
  
  
$150 a month?  
  
  
Could I really make it work?  
  
  
Seemed my only option was cramming in part-time jobs during breaks‚Ä¶  
  
  
Before I knew it, move-in day arrived.  
  
  
With my hard-earned three grand plus the $150 Dad sent, I started planning‚Äî  
  
  
Four months this semester.  
  
  
$800 monthly for dorms.  
  
  
$200 set aside for books.  
  
  
So basically... four months of busting my ass just to cover the extras, and I'm supposed to eat on that $150?!  
  
  
Dad's text popped up: ""Learn to budget. $150 is plenty if you're smart about it. Stop trying to keep up with everyone else's spending. Focus on your studies.""  
  
  
This was the first time he'd reached out since the divorce, and it read like a coupon circular.  
  
  
When I pushed open my dorm room door, my three roommates had already settled in.  
  
  
I shoved my old broken bag under the bed, the cheap plastic rustling like a freight train in the quiet room.  
  
  
When they all turned to stare, my face went nuclear.  
  
  
I ate my first dinner alone in the corner of the dining hall.  
  
  
Looking at the price board showing ""One meal combo: $15,"" I death-gripped the meal card in my pocket.  
  
  
In the end, I could only swallow hard and buy two slices of bread, choking them down with free coffee.  
  
  
After ten days like this, my budget notebook had ten hash marks. Each mark meant five slices of bread, with ""coffee: free"" scribbled next to them.  
  
  
On Wednesday, Riley, my roommate, knocked on my bed frame: ""Hey Yara, we're thinking of going in on a mini washing machine. Like one hundred each. You in?""  
  
  
One hundred bucks.  
  
  
My heart plummeted.  
  
  
I had exactly $120 left in my account this month.  
  
  
Finally, I nodded anyway, barely squeaking out: ""Sure.""  
  
  
The moment I hit send on that transfer, my phone showed a balance of $20.  
  
  
I suddenly remembered losing fifty bucks for lunch money in middle school. Dad had biked me around the neighborhood three times looking for it, then emptied his entire wallet into my backpack: ""Don't let yourself go without.""  
  
  
But now?  
  
  
Everything changed.  
  
  
During evening study session, the hollow ache in my stomach suddenly twisted, like someone was wringing out my insides.  
  
  
My study buddy Jess slid over a chocolate bar: ""Yara, Jesus, you look awful. Low blood sugar?""  
  
  
I tried to wave it off, but she'd already peeled the wrapper and pressed it into my palm.  
  
  
""Eat it.""  
  
  
As the chocolate melted sickeningly sweet on my tongue, my nose suddenly stung with tears.  
  
  
Back in the dorm, I opened our family group chat‚Äî""Happy Family Forever""‚Äîwhich had been radio silent since the divorce.  
  
  
The last message was still Mom's moving announcement.  
  
  
My fingers typed and deleted, deleted and typed like crazy.  
  
  
""Mom, Dad, had to chip in one hundred for a dorm washing machine. I'm completely broke for food now. Could you maybe send an extra $100 this month?""  
  
  
God, the words felt like red-hot iron burning my fingertips.  
  
  
Yet the chat stayed silent all night.  
  
  
Next morning, Dad came out swinging: ""Money again? Have you no shame? Already picking up this nasty begging habit? Christ, I'm starting to think you're not there to study‚Äîyou're there to blow money trying to keep up with everyone else. What happened to what I told you about budgeting? You made this mess, you deal with it. Don't expect me to clean up after you!""  
  
  
Before I could even process that, Mom's message exploded into the chat:  
  
  
""Are you kidding me? I just shelled out three hundred for ONE piano lesson for your stepbrother this month. What am I, a freaking bank? A money printer?""  
  
  
""Besides, you're a girl‚Äîhow much could you possibly eat? I bet those fake friends of yours are corrupting you. Instead of focusing on study, all you think about is spending money! It's your stepbrother's birthday next week and I still need to buy him that gaming console. Handle your own problems and quit bothering me.""  
  
  
Those two messages slapped me across the face.  
  
  
I stared at the screen, my finger hovering over the keyboard forever, unable to type a single word.  
  
  
So this is what I'd become‚Äîasking for one hundred bucks made me a ""spendthrift,"" a ""leech,"" a ""blood-sucker.""  
  
  
My phone kept buzzing as they volleyed blame back and forth like I was some dirty soccer ball they were trying to kick away.  
  
  
I suddenly remembered that divorce day, how they'd stood on opposite sides of the living room.  
  
  
Dad saying ""I'll pay half tuition, max.""  
  
  
Mom saying ""Why should I be stuck with living expenses?""  
  
  
And there I was, standing between them like some unwanted piece of collateral damage.  
  
  
That gnawing hunger came roaring back, worse than before.  
  
  
I clutched my stomach and put my head down on the desk. My roommate gently touched my arm: ""You okay? Want to go to the health center?""  
  
  
I shook my head, but tears started falling anyway.  
  
  
Turns out $150 really doesn't cut it at a big-city university.  
  
  
Turns out becoming an adult means nobody gives a damn if you're starving.  
  
  
Turns out parental love can fade like the ink on acceptance letters‚Äîgive it time, and it just disappears.  
  
  
Tomorrow I'd ask the cafeteria ladies if I could bus tables for meals. Maybe check if the campus convenience store needed night shift help.  
  
  
Starting tomorrow, I'd have to earn every bite of food in college.  
  
  
Chapter 2  
  
  
I started working the register at the campus store after classes‚Äîtwelve bucks an hour. Working eight hours on weekends just barely covered next week's food money.  
  
  
Walking out of the store, the night wind whipped rain into my face, brutal enough to make me shiver.  
  
  
""Well, well, well, little girl.""  
  
  
Three drunk guys stumbled out from behind some trees, reeking of booze and cigarettes.  
  
  
The blonde one squinted at my soaked shirt, his mouth twisting into a revolting grin.  
  
  
""All alone, sweetheart? Aw, why you running? We don't bite.""  
  
  
Every alarm bell in my head went off: ""Get out of my way.""  
  
  
""Ooh, feisty."" Blondie reached for my hoodie. ""Check it out, this chick's actually smoking hot. Way better than those fake plastic girls on campus.""  
  
  
Scar-face started pawing at my waist. I kicked at his shin, but he grabbed my ankle.  
  
  
I struggled and screamed: ""Get off me! I'm calling the cops!""  
  
  
Blondie laughed: ""Come have some fun with us, baby. We might even tip you better than that shitty register job.""  
  
  
Just as his hand reached for my shirt buttons, a flashlight beam cut through the rain and the security guard's voice boomed: ""Hey! You little punks!""  
  
  
Scar-face let out a curse. Blondie tried to kick me before the guard's flashlight sent them all scrambling.  
  
  
Back in the dorm, my roommates were already asleep.  
  
  
I crouched in the bathroom, lifting my hoodie in front of the mirror‚Äîa massive bruise bloomed across my lower back where they'd shoved me against the wall.  
  
  
Water gushed from the faucet as I covered my mouth to muffle my sobs, terrified of waking my roommates.  
  
  
I let the tears fall on the floor, mixing with the sound of running water.  
  
  
That night I sat on the edge of my bed hugging my knees, finally drifting off just before dawn.  
  
  
A week before midterms, our advisor posted in the class group chat: ""Class fee due: $200 for study materials and class activities.""  
  
  
""Yara, did you send yours yet? Deadline's tomorrow afternoon."" Megan asked while applying her face mask.  
  
  
I mumbled ""still working on it,"" but my chest felt like someone had dropped a stone on it.  
  
  
Desperate as hell, I pulled up Mom's number. The second it connected, I wanted to hang up, but it was too late.  
  
  
""What? Make it quick, I'm helping Benny with piano practice."" Mom's voice was already annoyed, kids laughing in the background.  
  
  
""Mom, we have class fees due, two hundred dollars..."" My voice was barely audible.  
  
  
""What? More money?"" Her voice spiked. ""What the hell are you doing at school? Got a boyfriend? Let me tell you something, Yara‚Äîdon't expect me to fund your damn love life!""  
  
  
Click.  
  
  
She hung up.  
  
  
I called Dad.  
  
  
It rang seven times before he picked up.  
  
  
A woman's voice in the background: ""Who is it?""  
  
  
""Dad, I need class fees, two hundred dollars...""  
  
  
Dad's voice was muffled, like he was hiding: ""Oh... uh... class fees... I just bought your stepsister a new phone. Can't you borrow from classmates?""  
  
  
His voice dropped to a whisper: ""This isn't a good time. Gotta go.""  
  
  
Click again.  
  
  
That night, while cramming finance formulas, the room suddenly spun and my textbook went flying.  
  
  
I woke up on a cot in the health center.  
  
  
The doctor's frown was deep: ""Low blood sugar plus exhaustion. Seriously, kid, what's going on? How many meals are you eating a day?""  
  
  
I didn't dare tell the truth, just mumbled something about forgetting to eat while studying.  
  
  
The doctor sighed and prescribed nutritional supplements‚Äîthirty-something dollars. My roommate beat me to the payment: ""Pay me back when you can.""  
  
  
Lying in my dorm bed, I scrolled through Instagram and saw Mom's post‚Äîa grid of photos from an amusement park with Benny.  
  
  
Caption: ""Baby's happiness is my greatest joy.""  
  
  
Scrolling down, I found Dad's update.  
  
  
He'd posted a photo of a piano‚Äîblack, obviously expensive. ""Gift for my princess. This kid's got talent, gotta nurture it.""  
  
  
Someone commented ""You're such a great dad,"" and he replied with a smug emoji.  
  
  
And here I was, unable to afford thirty dollars for supplements.  
  
  
I pulled out my phone and quietly muted the family group chat.  
  
  
Chapter 3  
  
  
The day before break when the cleaning lady came to tidy up, I was crouched in the dorm hallway counting money.  
  
  
Crumpled bills spread across my knees, fives and tens stacked up, the biggest one a fifty‚Äîovertime pay the bubble tea shop owner had thrown in.  
  
  
""Yara, seriously not going home?"" Auntie pressed a bag of apples into my hands, ""The dorms lose power during break, so stock up on food.""  
  
  
I carefully tucked the money back in my pocket, forcing a smile and nodding: ""Nah, saving on travel money.""  
  
  
Truth was, I couldn't afford a bus ticket home‚Äîafter paying next semester's $800 dorm fee, I had exactly twenty-seven dollars and thirty cents left in the tin.  
  
  
Christmas night, I pulled out my last slice of toast and the dregs of peanut butter‚Äîwell, this was my Christmas feast.  
  
  
I opened our long-silent family group chat and saw Mom had posted a video.  
  
  
Waves lapping at the beach, her in a floral sundress under palm trees, some guy's arm around her waist, that Benny kid holding ice cream and grinning.  
  
  
Caption: ""Florida winters are amazing! Benny says we have to come back every year.""  
  
  
Then came Dad's photos.  
  
  
In the living room of his new place, he was standing on a stool hanging Christmas decorations while my stepsister held up star lights from below. His new wife stood nearby filming. ""Stella helping daddy with the star lights‚Äîwhat a perfect family.""  
  
  
The chat messages flew by like they were competing‚ÄîMom posted seafood spreads, Dad countered with Stella's Christmas gifts; Mom bragged about Benny learning to swim, Dad showed off Stella's piano certificates.  
  
  
Holding my empty peanut butter can, watching all that blazing happiness, I suddenly realized they hadn't even bothered with a single ""where are you spending Christmas"" message.  
  
  
It's like I was never even part of this family.  
  
  
Those Christmas carols we sang together, the snowmen we built, all those happy moments eating roast chicken together...  
  
  
Were they all just dreams I made up?  
  
  
As I swallowed the last bite of bread, my phone lit up again.  
  
  
Mom posted a photo of Benny. ""Baby boy's Christmas haul: Lego set, remote control car, and a PSP. Gotta spoil the boys, right?""  
  
  
Dad immediately followed up with photos of his princess unwrapping gifts. ""Our little princess got the royal treatment this Christmas‚ÄîElsa dress, glass slippers, fairy tale books, and a Disney annual pass.""  
  
  
Fireworks suddenly exploded outside. I ran to the balcony to watch, brilliant colors reflecting off the academic building across the way like scattered gold.  
  
  
But even the prettiest fireworks don't last, just like some people‚Äîthey walk away and never look back.  
  
  
On the last day of December, I rode the bus to Mom's new place with my twenty-seven dollars and thirty cents.  
  
  
I'd practiced in the mirror the night before, rehearsing what I'd say.  
  
  
Nothing about money, nothing about feeling hurt.  
  
  
Just chat about school stuff, mention the new dining hall options, maybe ask if Florida sand really was softer than it looked in photos.  
  
  
When the security guard at the gate stopped me, I gave him Mom's name, but he shook his head: ""No Andersons in this building. Only the Millers in that unit.""  
  
  
It took me forever to realize‚Äîshe'd probably even changed her last name.  
  
  
Standing there confused on the sidewalk, I suddenly spotted a familiar figure.  
  
  
Mom in a fur coat, holding Benny's hand as they came out of the grocery store, her new husband trailing behind with shopping bags.

Im recently done with my exams and the results were out. I prob passed everything and only failed math which means I have to retake it. My mom was so disappointed in me and when my younger sis told about her marks she was comparing it indirectly. Before every exam, she would either scream on me bcz I wasn't doing my job properly or have a fight w my dad or, say things like ' ohh u have get 100 % in ur math exam cuz we got u in a tutoring ( which didn't help) plus we're immigrants. Learning and doing math in french is already hard for me. They doesn't even know what subject im doing or not. Recently my parents fought , and the reason was that my dad spend his own me time after my mom goes to sleep, which disturbs her CZ she can't sleep alone. Plus in the morning while they have coffee, he looks at his phone all the time. My dad and me, WE were close once, he used to complain over mom how she behave how she orders around how she place her victim card. So when they were having fight, it got so worse that I started to scream and was like my mental health and my weight is getting worse bcz of y'all's fight. My younger sis cry at night J's bcz of y'all so stop fighting. Legit I was right all along and my mom was like hon it's alr it's ok don't cry and then we 3 ( our dad was sleeping) had a convoy and found out our prbs. So when we were talking about it w our dad he was disappointed but he accepted his faults. From the next day, my mom is like, you should also see your prbs u shouldn't be a bitch . I am doing dishes, cleaning and organizing the whole ficking house all day long and later when I'm J's expressing myself I'm being a bitch?  Plus I also told her she should stop a lil hit of ordering stuff around and do her job, now she's like oh it's alr I don't need to do it cuz u told me to do my job..

Chapter 1  
  
  
I was born with sacred moonblood flowing through my veins, blood that could heal any werewolf ailment.  
  
  
In my past life, after healing the paralyzed legs of Alpha Alexander Blackthorne, I discovered the Blackthorne Pack had declared that whoever healed their Alpha would become their Luna.  
  
  
Alexander was forced to mark me as his mate. His beloved first-love Stella heard the news, lost her footing while climbing the treacherous cliffs to gather moonflower petals for his healing, and fell to her death.  
  
  
A year later, Alexander found Stella's frozen corpse.  
  
  
He forced me to slash my wrists and bleed out to bring her back to life.  
  
  
""If Stella had returned with the moonflowers to heal me, we would have been mates forever. You killed her!""  
  
  
""Aurelia, you claim your blood is sacred medicine? Then bring Stella back to life!""  
  
  
I begged him through my tears.  
  
  
""Stella has been dead for a year. I can only heal the living, not resurrect the dead.""  
  
  
But Alexander wouldn't listen to my explanation. He watched me bleed to death with cold eyes.  
  
  
When I opened my eyes again, I had returned to the day the Blackthorne Pack asked me to heal their Alpha.  
  
  
Looking at Alexander sitting in his wheelchair with his dark, brooding expression, I smiled coldly.  
  
  
""Alpha Blackthorne, your legs are beyond salvation. No one can heal them.""  
  
  
Hearing my words, Alexander slowly raised his head to look at me, anger brewing in his steel-gray eyes.  
  
  
""Useless healer, get out of my sight!""  
  
  
I raised an eyebrow slightly, turning to look at his mother Former Luna Margaret beside me.  
  
  
""Luna Margaret, when the Moonrise Healer Pack says a condition cannot be cured, it truly cannot be healed. You should consider producing another heir while you're still young‚Äî""  
  
  
Before I could even finish, Alexander's coffee mug flew straight at my head.  
  
  
I dodged to the side.  
  
  
The expensive porcelain shattered against the wall with a sharp crack.  
  
  
Margaret quickly apologized to me.  
  
  
""Miss Aurelia, I'm so sorry. I apologize for Alexander's behavior. He's just frustrated because of his condition...""  
  
  
I waved dismissively.  
  
  
""I understand. A paralyzed, powerless Alpha tends to have a twisted mindset.""  
  
  
Seeing Alexander's body trembling with rage, I hurriedly turned and walked out of the Blackthorne pack house.  
  
  
Margaret chased after me, pleading in a low voice.  
  
  
""Miss Aurelia, is there truly no way? I've heard the Moonrise Pack possesses ancient healing magic. If you can heal Alexander's legs, the Blackthorne Pack will grant any request you have.""  
  
  
Huh, it wasn't that he couldn't be healed‚ÄîI simply wouldn't heal him.  
  
  
In my past life, Alexander blamed Stella's death on me, stubbornly believing that if Stella had brought back the moonflowers, she could have healed his legs.  
  
  
If he had thought rationally, he would have known moonflowers were merely supplements.  
  
  
Their supposed miraculous properties were nothing but inflated claims.  
  
  
But after discovering I had used my sacred blood to heal his legs, he watched me bleed to death just to try reviving Stella.  
  
  
Before I died, I overheard the pack servants talking.  
  
  
It turned out that Stella hadn't fallen while picking moonflowers at all. After learning she couldn't become Luna Blackthorne, she had sought out another powerful alpha, only to be discovered by his mate and thrown off the cliff.  
  
  
In this life, I wouldn't get involved in their twisted relationship again. Let them have their fucking happily ever after.  
  
  
""I cannot help with Alpha Blackthorne's condition.""  
  
  
Alexander wheeled out after me, his deep voice suppressing his anger.  
  
  
""Mother, Stella has already flown to the Moonpeak Mountains. When she returns with the sacred moonflowers, my legs will definitely be healed.""  
  
  
""Needless to beg others.""  
  
  
Margaret sighed deeply.  
  
  
""Moonflowers can only aid in recovery, but to make you walk again requires much more. The Moonrise Pack is your last hope...""  
  
  
Alexander remained stubbornly fixed in his beliefs.  
  
  
""I told you, Stella can heal me.""  
  
  
I gave Alexander one last meaningful look before bidding Margaret farewell.  
  
  
Just as I stepped outside the Blackthorne pack gates, a black SUV stopped in front of me. A woman got out and knelt before me.  
  
  
""Miss Moonrise, please save my son...""  
  
  
Chapter 2  
  
  
It turned out that a year ago, the accident hadn't only injured Alexander‚Äîit had also harmed his rival, Alpha Ethan Silvermoon.  
  
  
After that car crash, Ethan had become a comatose patient barely clinging to life.  
  
  
But having experienced the painful past life, I wouldn't casually use my sacred blood to save anyone anymore. So I refused former Luna Silvermoon's request.  
  
  
Luna Silvermoon didn't press further and left in tears.  
  
  
A week later, I received an invitation to a Blackthorne Pack celebration.  
  
  
Stella had returned with the moonflowers. Margaret was worried about the effectiveness of Stella's medicine and asked me to attend and verify it.  
  
  
At the celebration, Stella stayed glued to Alexander's side.  
  
  
Margaret took my hand, her face full of worry.  
  
  
""I'm not afraid that Stella's medicine won't work. I'm just worried that if Alexander gets disappointed again, he won't be able to handle the blow.""  
  
  
""This past year, we've tried everything. I've watched the hope in Alexander's eyes fade bit by bit. As his mother, I truly don't know what else to do...""  
  
  
Before I could offer comfort, Stella wheeled Alexander over to us.  
  
  
""Luna Margaret, don't worry. I will definitely make Alexander walk again. I nearly died on those mountains getting this moonflower.""  
  
  
Alexander grasped Stella's hand, deeply moved.  
  
  
""Stella, once I can walk again, I'll give you the most magnificent mating ceremony.""  
  
  
""Alexander, I believe in you.""  
  
  
Stella turned to look at me, her smile cryptic.  
  
  
""I'm different from those charlatan healers. I'm certain I can heal Alexander's legs.""  
  
  
As soon as she finished speaking, the faces of several renowned healers who had previously treated Alexander's legs darkened.  
  
  
""Miss Stella, you have quite the audacity. Are you certain you can heal the Alpha's legs?""  
  
  
""You're not even from a medical background, yet you dare question our expertise?""  
  
  
""Even Aurelia from the legendary Moonrise Healing Pack said the Alpha's legs couldn't be healed. I don't believe a young girl like you has such abilities!""  
  
  
Though Alexander felt Stella had spoken impulsively, he still defended her.  
  
  
""I believe Stella can definitely heal me!""  
  
  
For a second, I couldn't help but laugh.  
  
  
Stella thought I was mocking her.  
  
  
She gritted her teeth in anger but forced a smile.  
  
  
""Aurelia, I heard you're the most outstanding healer of your generation, but you refused both the Blackthorne and Silvermoon packs. It's hard not to suspect that you actually don't know how to heal at all.""  
  
  
I smiled slightly.  
  
  
""Then I very much look forward to the day Miss Stella makes Alpha Blackthorne walk again.""  
  
  
Seeing that I wasn't angry but instead smiling, Stella bit her lip.  
  
  
""Are you upset that I stole your spotlight? I know Luna Margaret likes you and intended for you to mate with Alexander, but now I'm the only one who can heal Alexander's legs.""  
  
  
Alexander, sitting in his wheelchair, spoke mockingly.  
  
  
""Aurelia, even if you had the ability to heal me, I would never agree to mate with you. Besides, you're just a useless healer. When my mother introduced you earlier, I thought you were someone impressive, but it seems you're just ordinary.""  
  
  
""I'm telling you, my beloved is only Stella. I will mate with no one but her in this life.""  
  
  
""Even if you keep appearing before me, I won't spare you a second glance.""  
  
  
Watching their performance, I felt only irritation.  
  
  
""Luna Margaret invited me just to verify Miss Stella's medicine. But since Alpha Blackthorne trusts Miss Stella so much, there's no need for me to meddle.""  
  
  
I turned to leave, but Stella stepped in front of me.  
  
  
""Aurelia, what do you mean by that?""  
  
  
I frowned.  
  
  
""Exactly what I said. If you don't understand, check your dictionary!""  
  
  
Stella snorted coldly.  
  
  
""Aurelia, do you dare make a bet with me? Let's see who can heal Alexander's legs. The loser kneels in defeat and is banished from the territory forever!""  
  
  
I stopped and turned back to her.  
  
  
""I'll take your bet. But I won't heal Alpha Alexander‚ÄîI'll heal Alpha Ethan!""  
  
  
Chapter 3  
  
  
""Ten days. Let's see if you can make Alexander walk, or if I can wake Ethan.""  
  
  
""Stella, do you dare?""  
  
  
My words immediately caused an uproar.  
  
  
""Isn't the Alpha Silvermoon in a coma? That's much harder than healing Alexander's legs.""  
  
  
""Right, if it weren't for the Silvermoon Pack spending a fortune to keep Ethan alive, he would have died long ago.""  
  
  
""If Miss Aurelia can wake Ethan, that would be a miracle in healing history!""  
  
  
""One month is already short enough‚Äîhow is ten days even possible?""  
  
  
Hearing the surrounding discussions, Stella's eyes flashed with cunning.  
  
  
""I accept. With all these witnesses, Aurelia, you can't back out when you lose.""  
  
  
I nodded lightly.  
  
  
""I won't lose.""  
  
  
Alexander's lips curved into a contemptuous smile.  
  
  
""Alpha Ethan is practically dead already. You can't even heal my legs, yet you fantasize about healing Alpha Ethan. Aurelia, if you admit defeat now, I might consider not banishing you from the territory.""  
  
  
My gaze swept meaningfully over his legs.  
  
  
""Alexander, medicine can be toxic. Be careful that Miss Stella's medical skills are too advanced‚Äîyou might end up not only with unhealed legs but also some strange new ailment.""  
  
  
With that, I turned and left.  
  
  
Stella was just a weak she-wolf from a minor bloodline with no healing abilities whatsoever.  
  
  
The idea that she could heal Alexander's paralysis?  
  
  
No fucking way I'd buy that.  
  
  
That night, news of our bet spread throughout the Moonlands Territory.  
  
  
People even started placing bets on who would win. Alexander, to encourage Stella, bet ten million on her victory.  
  
  
Early the next morning, Luna Silvermoon picked me up to go to the Moonlands hospital.  
  
  
I took out the blood medicine I had prepared beforehand, lifted Ethan's head, and made him drink it.  
  
  
At most, it would take seven days for Ethan to awaken.  
  
  
""Miss Moonrise, thank you. Regardless of whether Ethan wakes up this time, the Silvermoon Pack will remember this kindness.""  
  
  
""If you have any requests, please voice them. We'll do whatever we can.""  
  
  
Luna Silvermoon was about to kneel again.  
  
  
I quickly supported her.  
  
  
""Luna Silvermoon, I'm not saving Ethan for anything in return. I just want to win.""  
  
  
""Don't worry, I will definitely wake Ethan.""  
  
  
Luna Silvermoon's eyes reddened with emotion.  
  
  
""I also heard about your bet with Stella. The Silvermoon Pack has wagered ten million on you. When the time comes, we'll give you everything including the winnings.""  
  
  
""Miss Moonrise, please don't refuse this‚Äîit's what you deserve.""  
  
  
I was about to speak when I saw Stella wheeling Alexander toward us.  
  
  
""So that's why you volunteered to save Alpha Ethan‚Äîyou're after the Silvermoon Pack's money.""  
  
  
Stella approached and grabbed Luna Silvermoon's hand persuasively.  
  
  
""Luna Silvermoon, don't let Aurelia deceive you. She can't even heal Alexander's legs‚Äîhow could she possibly wake Alpha Ethan? Don't end up losing both your son and your money.""  
  
  
Luna Silvermoon shook off her hand.  
  
  
""I trust Miss Moonrise. It's none of your concern, Miss Stella.""  
  
  
Being so bluntly rejected by Luna Silvermoon, Stella pouted pitifully.  
  
  
""I was just trying to warn you...""  
  
  
Seeing tears in Stella's eyes, Alexander's heart ached.  
  
  
""Luna Silvermoon, Alpha Ethan and I have known each other for years. You should at least trust my words. This she-wolf is a useless healer‚Äîdon't let her treat Alpha Ethan.""  
  
  
I stopped Luna Silvermoon from defending me and looked at Alexander's legs.  
  
  
""Alexander, haven't you noticed your legs have atrophied more severely than before?""

I have been listening to Laura Doyle, but her advice can be pretty brutal for women who have been in this situation!","So a little background-husband and I have been married for 15 years and we have two small children. We have a 50/50 style relationship in the sense that we both work but we have male and female gender roles at home (we are both fine with that and it feels normal and good to both of us). So my husband worked with a woman (a married woman our age with 2 kids also) for 8 years and they got really close during the pandemic with texting, meeting up for coffee (sometimes one-on-one, sometimes with coworkers), and when she moved away in 2022, they maintained contact.

It wasn't until after she moved away that I became concerned. My husband has a couple of friends who also live in the state where she moved, and in 2023 he went to visit them and also saw her on both those trips but they went out in a group setting. She has also come home to visit and they have met one-on-one (the most recent meeting was December of 2024). He has never lied to me about his whereabouts, but I did catch him lying to me about his attraction to her. So, due to the nature of my husband's work, they worked very closely together. After she had moved away and these one-on-one or group meetings happened during each person's travel visits, I became suspicious and hypervigilant since the December meeting in 2024. I started looking up old texts. There was never anything sexually or too intimate, but there were several selfies, including ones taken at work. These always came from her camera based on the way the text was sent. I also heard her refer to herself as his ""work wife"" in a voice message. The thing that really broke me is they said ""I miss you"" on several occasions. I did blow up at him because when he left his phone on the table a text from her came through and I just asked why he was talking to her. He got very defensive and said they were ""just friends."" I backed off and didn't say anything after that.

I kept quiet about it until I had a vivid dream and did something pretty manipulative: since I never told him I had looked at his phone, I said that in my dream he complimented her in front of me and they went off by themselves to go somewhere one-on-one and it made me feel humiliated. I embellished the story of my dream by adding ""And you guys said ""I miss you"" to each other and it broke my heart. This time, he wasn't mad and he listened-I am not sure if it made him feel guilty or what. But after that, she had texted him in May asking a professional question and he never texted back. Then, as a family we went to visit friends in the state where she lives. During that time she texted ""I seem to recall you were going to be in the area this week and I would love to see you."" He never responded and he never saw her as I was with him the entire trip. Keep in mind that was a double text. So, I think he has ceased talking to her.

This experience was a huge wakeup call for me because of a few reasons. First, the women in question looks a LOT like me facially. Like we could be sisters, and this is based on multiple people's observations. However, during the pandemic I was overweight (I have since lost 40 pounds and I am in my BMI now), and she was skinny, albeit not voluptuous, which is what my husband is more attracted to. The emotional closeness he had with her was very concerning to me, especially the fact that she never really made an effort to get to know me. The worst sign of disrespect from her IMO was referring to herself as a ""work wife."" So unprofessional! At any rate, I am on a path to self improvement and making myself happy so I can be less anxious and prevent something like this from happening again.

I maybe just want to vent and get some outside perspective. 

So in 2020 I met my now Husband we will call him James. It was love from the moment we met.  A little background into our families. My parents are still married and they are a very important part of my life.  James's parent are divorced because his father cheated on his mother and he is not on speaking turns with his father ( a whole other story). 

For the first year everything went great I got along with his mother and I made an effort with everything, I would make sure I got her the perfect gifts always something she wanted and we would talk for hours. 
At the end of 2020 James lost his job because of covid and they had to cut people. So we started looking for new jobs in 2021. This is were the problems started we moved in together and his mother came to live with us. James was online the whole day looking for jobs and doing interviews, writing emails ect.  His mother started complaining about him to people at her work (we live in a small town and those people told my mother about it). 
She said he is lazy and bad and all he does all day is look at his computer. Mind you everyone in my family was helping him look for a job and neither is mother nor his sister helped with looking. During this time she would invite his ex girlfriends over for coffee without asking us and then she helped one of them find a job for their husband, that made me fuming because why would she help them but not her own son. In the middle of 2021 his previous work place offered him a part time job.
Fast forward to 2022 James got really sick and lost about 20kg (44lbs) in two weeks, turns out he had Hyperthyroidism and had to get a radioactive pill that the medical insurance didn't want to pay for, we tried to gather all the money and his mother said that she could not lend him money because she thinks he should go to a naturopathic doctor because she doesn't think it is serious. Mind you it was serious. I lost it and told her that he will be hospitalized if he didn't get the right medication. 
She also had a boyfriend she would invite to stay for weeks on end and wanted us to pay all the bills and groceries.

Fast forward to 2023. In April 2023 James got a job out of the country that was high paying and he took it. Me and my family were sooooo happy that we all cried together and he didn't get much of a reaction from his mother. 
In July I quit my job and went to live with my fiance. The Job is only 9 months at a time and then he is of for 3 months so I started planning our wedding for December. His sister was also getting married in January and she told everyone that we just want to get married before her but that was not the case. 
For our wedding I tried to include mother-in law as much as I can but she didn't want to, I aked her to make the thank you cards,  she gave it to someone else to do for my kitchen tea she didn't want to attend she wanted to go to her bible study. So you get that ,she didn't really have any interest in us and our wedding.  
The start of 2024 my husband left for work while I waited for my visa, she invited me for coffee and cried the whole time about wanting to be involved in our childrens lives.
 We just got married and this is what she cries about, not about being more involved in our live but our future children?  Make it make sense. 
She did this a couple of times before I left, she likes to amush me when my husband is not around because she knows I will not have it and call her out. 

I got pregnant in August of 2024 we waited and told everyone when we got back in November. When we told her she cried that she was not married and our baby will not have a grandfather and then she said that she will become a grandmother for two babies because she thinks James sister will also have a baby( she said that multiple times every time someone congratulate her she would say thanks I will get 2 grandbabies this year). 
We were there for Christmas and she gave us a gift for the baby that James's grandparents bought, it was not a gift from her but she decided she wants to give it, which was not right because his grandparents were there.  She also laughed at my stomach and the clothes I had on and invited an old friend of that I have not seen in years because I cut her off and when I did not mingle with the friend mother in law came and slap me on my arm because she did something special for me. She also keeps comparing James to his father and then 5 minutes later she would tell everyone how bad his father is so in my eyes she's saying that James is also bad.  She also keeps comparing our marriage to her failed marriage. 
Then the babyshower came, she did not buy a singel gift for the baby and made her daughter tell me that the gifts was from the both of them( I knew it wasn't because sister in law told). 
My husband left for work again in February.  Mother in law ambushed me again with coffee dates were she would cry about not being married and that the baby would not have a grandfather, I told her that my dad will be good enough he is the best father and will be the best grandfather.  She also went to cry at my mothers work that she is afraid of not being involved but she didn't do her part we put in all of the effort and she does nothing she only talks to us when she wants or needs something. 
She also cried that I don't talk to her anymore and I told her that I never felt part of their family and I don't feel respected. 

Our beautiful daughter was born in April and still no present from her. We are now in another country the only time she talks to us is when she needs something, she never asks us about our daughter.  She is lending our car because she sold hers and that is all we are good enough for and when she went to pick up the car from my parents she told then that James ows her this and he ows her money for al the things she ever did for him and this is how it always is when she needs something she will tell him she did these things for him when he was in school so now he ows her. 
The reason I am writing this  is because she messaged me and asked what she should buy for a friends babyshower and that hurt me because she never made any effort to buy a gift for my babyshower or showed any interest in our baby. 
I really think the only reason she talks to James or us is because she wants to keep us close for  when she needs something or am I overreacting?

# Chapter 1 Friends No More - Pt.

‚ÄúElla, hurry up or you‚Äôre going to be late for school!‚Äù This is the second time my mother has yelled upstairs for me, but I just sit here, on the edge of my bed, staring at the wall.

I tell myself that it‚Äôs going to be a good day, but who am I kidding? I haven‚Äôt had a good day at school in two years. Only six more months left of my senior year, and then it will be all over. I‚Äôm not sure how I feel about it yet, and that‚Äôs the most messed up part. I‚Äôm eighteen years old, about to graduate high school, and I have a full scholarship to pretty much any college I want to go.

My name is Ella Baxter and I‚Äôm a nerd who has no friends, I never break any rules, and I have a deep need to please everyone, but myself. I haven‚Äôt always been this way, but circumstances bring on change, and for me, it was not for the better. I used to have a lot of friends; two of them being my best friends, Amy and Bree. We were inseparable throughout middle school and junior high. It wasn‚Äôt until the beginning of sophomore year when I had to distance myself from everyone in my life except for my family.

‚ÄúHoney! Are you coming down or not?‚Äù Once again, my mother‚Äôs voice reaches me. Sighing, I reach down, grabbing my backpack, and head down before mom has a coronary.

I paste a smile on my face as I round the corner to the kitchen, where my younger sister and brother sit with a bowl of cereal. Eli, my nine-year-old brother has his bowl tipped back as he slurps the milk out. Meanwhile, my fifteen-year-old sister, Elise, is dripping milk on the table every time she spoons the cereal into her mouth because her eyes are glue to her cellphone. This is an everyday occurrence in the Baxter household.

I roll my eyes and lean down, giving my dad a kiss on his cheek, ‚ÄúGood morning, daddy.‚Äù

‚ÄúMorning, sweetie, did you oversleep again?‚Äù His concern for my wellbeing is written all over his face. I‚Äôve always been his little girl, and it shows in the way he babies me over everything. I don‚Äôt complain though, because I need all the love and attention that I can get these days.

‚ÄúNo, daddy.‚Äù I don‚Äôt add anything else, but I do smile at him. I could have lied and made something up, but again, I‚Äôm a goodie goodie; I would never lie to my parents. He only hesitates a moment before going back to his newspaper.

Taking my seat beside my dad, my mother sets my two slices of peanut butter toast and a banana down in front of me. Unlike my siblings, I‚Äôm not a fan of cold cereal. I prefer something more substantial in my stomach before starting a grueling day at school.

‚ÄúThis is the third day in a row that I had to holler for you to come down more than once, Ella,‚Äù Mom takes her place across from me, on my father‚Äôs other side, as she sips her black coffee, ‚ÄúPlease don‚Äôt make it a habit, my throat is starting to hurt.‚Äù

My father chuckles behind his paper, earning himself a slap on the arm from his wife, ‚ÄúBehave, Ethan!‚Äù

I‚Äôve been around my parents enough to know how they are. They are both in their early forties, and still have their good looks. Unfortunately, they also still have a high sex drive, so I can only imagine what my dad‚Äôs chuckle was insinuating. Being around them every day, you get used to it. Besides, I think it‚Äôs so cute that, even after all these years, they are still madly in love with one another. I hope I find a love like theirs in my lifetime.

‚ÄúOh! Before I forget,‚Äù Mom turns back to me, ‚ÄúI have a PTA meeting at Eli‚Äôs school this evening. I‚Äôll have a casserole in the oven but will need you to make sure your brother and sister eat.‚Äù

‚ÄúSure, no problem.‚Äù My mom is always volunteering here and there, and she is the head of the PTA, so she is always busy with that. ‚ÄúWill you be home for supper, dad?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure, honey. I have a meeting with a client, and it may run late. Just put a plate in the warmer for me if I don‚Äôt make it in time.‚Äù I nod. My dad is a partner at his Law Firm, so it‚Äôs no surprise when he doesn‚Äôt make it home on time. Sometimes my mom will bring dinner to him and his client if the meeting runs over.

Finishing up the last of my breakfast, I take my plate to the dishwasher and then scoop my bag up, ‚ÄúThe train is leaving!‚Äù I call out to Eli and Elise. Driving them to school every morning is our little morning ritual. It‚Äôs the only time that we get with each other these days. Elise is always busy with her friends, now that she‚Äôs a freshman, and Eli locks himself in his room and plays video games all evening.

As soon as we get into the car, Elise cranks up the radio, and our morning karaoke session begins. Ed Sheeran‚Äôs song, Shivers, my sister‚Äôs favorite song, is playing, and she squeals. She starts to dance as she belts out the words, and I can‚Äôt help but to laugh as I watch her strawberry blonde curls bounce around. Her blue eyes sparkle when they find mine, and she gives me a big smile. Unlike some sisters, we actually get along very well, but it‚Äôs times like this that I envy her innocence. I hope she never has to experience a day of what my life is like, because I‚Äôm afraid it may break her.

The second bell that starts the first class of the day is about to ring as I slam my locker closed. With my laptop bag slung across my body, I quickly make my way to my first class before anybody can stop me. Mr. Miller, our math teacher, sits at his desk, shuffling through papers while we all file into the room. I breathe a sigh of relief once my butt touches my chair, knowing that for the next ninety minutes, I‚Äôll have some semblance of peace.

Unfortunately, Mr. Miller had us working on our next assignment, which kept me busy through the whole class, and before I know it, the bell rings. Packing my laptop away, I turn to leave and accidentally bump into someone, I curse under my breath when I see who it is.

‚ÄúWatch where you‚Äôre going, nerd!‚Äù Kaylee Simpson glares at me as though I had done it on purpose.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm really sorry, Kaylee, it was an accident.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm really sorry, Kaylee, it was an accident.‚Äù She mimics and then shoves past me, ‚ÄúHow about you accidentally jump off a bridge?‚Äù Her friend, Callie, snickers at her lame attempt to insult me as they walk out.

Bumping into the captain of the school‚Äôs dance team first thing in the morning pretty much tells me exactly what kind of day I‚Äôm going to have. Kaylee doesn‚Äôt even know why she hates me so much. We used to be acquaintances, not really running in the same crowd, but still talking between classes and outside of school. Now she treats me like the dirt under her feet. Like everybody else, she dropped me like last season‚Äôs fashion line two years ago. One Friday night we were talking at a friend‚Äôs party, and then come Monday morning, Kaylee and most of the senior class started to ignore me. It had only taken about a week, and then the rest of the school abandoned me as well. That‚Äôs when it all started; it‚Äôs when Jace Palmer decided to make my life hell.

# Chapter 2 Friends No More - Pt.

As next door neighbors, Jace and I grew up playing together. Our parents are very good friends and were always bringing our families together for summer barbeques, holidays, birthdays, anything‚Ä¶you name it‚Ä¶our families celebrated together. Jace knows everything about me, and I, him, since we were best friends; wherever Jace was, I was right there with him. That is until we entered our sophomore year in high school. It was as though he had developed amnesia and didn‚Äôt remember that we were best friends.

I remember as if it were only yesterday. It was the third Friday after the school year had started, and we had hung with a group of friends after school let out for the weekend. We were excited and talking about the party we were all going to that night. As always, Jace had driven us over to the party. I was having a good time even though I wasn‚Äôt drinking any of the alcohol that was available to us, but Jace was. Not that it was unusual for him to be drinking, because I was always the DD for him afterwards.

At one point, I spotted Jace standing in a corner talking to some girl named Madison, that had just moved to town. Her and her brother were fraternal twins, but complete opposites. Her brother, Mason, was more on the wild side, and a bit cocky, whereas she was more reserved. It looked like Jace was enjoying the conversation, so I wandered around, stopping a few times to chit chat. When Mason had stopped me, he handed me a bottle of water, and I remember thinking to myself that it was very kind of him to notice that I wasn‚Äôt drinking.

The night went on, and Mason stuck to my side, flirting with me the whole time. Kaylee had come over, and we talked for a good thirty minutes before she moved on to talk to others. When I looked around the room, Jace was nowhere to be seen. The party was slowly dwindling down when Mason asked if I needed a ride home. I had thanked him and told him that Jace was my ride, but then he informed me that Jace already left the party with his sister. That hadn‚Äôt sat well with me, because it wasn‚Äôt like him to just up and leave without telling me.

I began searching the house for him, because I just couldn't believe that he had left me stranded. When I couldn‚Äôt find him, I looked outside for his car, but it was gone, the spot where he parked was empty. I tried calling his cell phone, but it kept going straight to voicemail. I was officially pissed off with my best friend, and he was going to get an earful when I talked to him the next day. I had no choice but to take Mason up on his offer to drive me home.

After giving Mason my address, I buckled myself into the passenger seat and tried texting Jace, but he never replied back. Messaging him on social media had the same outcome, although, with those messages, I could see that he was reading them, but ignoring me completely. I started to become worried, and when I lifted my head to say something to Mason about Jace ignoring me, I noticed that he wasn‚Äôt heading to my house. Instead, he was pulling into a secluded area where teenagers go to make-out or just get laid.

There were a few other cars in the clearing as we pulled in and he parked his car. I had tried to tell him that I wanted to go home, that I didn‚Äôt want to be there with him. He tried to sweet talk me into staying, and eventually told me that he would only take me home if I gave him a kiss. What‚Äôs one little kiss going to do, right? I gave in and leaned over to give him a quick kiss, but he grabbed me and hauled me over the middle counsel, and crashed his mouth against mine.

I started to object when he took the opportunity to shove his tongue into my mouth. He was stealing the kind of kiss that I was saving for someone special. My fists started pounding against his chest, trying to get him to stop. With all of my thrashing around, I somehow got him between the legs with one of my limbs, causing him to grunt and pull back. Climbing back to the passenger side, I had demanded that he take me back home right away. After glaring at me for a moment, and then a few curse words, he started his car, and took me home.

When we pulled up in front of my house, I could see that Jace‚Äôs bedroom light was on. I grabbed the door handle and went to open it, but Mason locked it before I was able to. He tried apologizing for his actions, explaining that he really liked me and wanted me to give him a chance. It wasn‚Äôt until I agreed to think about it, that he unlocked the door so I could get out. I was trying to hurry because I wanted to try calling Jace again, but then I notice that his bedroom light was now off, and flooded in darkness. Sighing, I went inside and went to bed myself. I never did get to talk to Jace the next day, or the day after that, and by the end of my first class on Monday morning, I was officially ostracized.

# Chapter 3 Obey Me - Pt. 1

I spend my school days trying to avoid Jace. Luckily, I only have one class with him, and that is last period Study Hall. Most of the time I skip it because I‚Äôm so far ahead in my schoolwork that the teachers don‚Äôt bother me about leaving. Today was like any other day, I quickly make my way through the halls, avoiding the areas that I know Jace tends to be in. Sometimes I get lucky and make it, and sometimes I don‚Äôt.

Watching where I‚Äôm going, while zigzagging through the halls, and staying aware of my surroundings, I suddenly feel a tight grip around my arm. I‚Äôm yanked into the now empty Art room, and tossed against the wall. The lock clicks, and then I‚Äôm staring into a pair of green eyes as the person turns my way. Jace has a smirk on his face as he looks me up and down. He normally slams me against lockers, trips me, and even steals my things, tossing them around with his friends, playing keep-away, like they were kids. This is a new low for him, though.

I am a runner and running felt even better. Sex was even better and libido became even higher. But the past two weeks I've been very lethargic and I can't even go on my runs like I used to. I feel so low energy and am unable to focus at all. Coffee doesn't taste good anymore. I feel nauseated CONSTANTLY. I thought maybe it's lack of food. After I eat, the nausea will go away but only for a few minutes then it comes back. I feel bloated all the time and I eat super healthy. I live a very healthy lifestyle as I lost 100+ lbs and vaping was the only exception to my healthy lifestyle. I can barely digest anymore since nicotine helped with that. I don't know how to stop the nausea. I don't even seem to want to have sex or do activities that I loved doing anymore. And now, I am feeling icky all over. I don't know how to describe it. It's my skin. It feels itchy and weird, even after showers. I keep getting goosebumps for no reason and it feels even worse after. Is this part of it?? I'd like to know if anyone else has experienced this feeling. These symptoms are awful. I sometimes feel like going back to vaping just to stop these symptoms.

Trip 2: Had around 7oz of coffee with oats

It was not a lot of fluid, and I was not on an empty stomach. Just two months ago, I was traveling often with no issues. I could even sit through long flights lasting six to eight hours without needing the bathroom.

I also take the subway often and do not face this problem there. I usually have the same kind of breakfast, coffee, and something solid, and can go almost the entire day without needing to pee.

Could it be the car vibrations? Or something else?

I know for sure that on my next trip I will not drink any water, coffee, or other liquids beforehand. Why is this happening and what else can I do to avoid this? Any advice is appreciated!

‚Äî17 of December, 3072‚Äì

In the remote, frozen and sparsely populated areas of Khiberia there wasn‚Äôt much to do, and not much to build, this more isolated area of the human controlled planets sat on the eastern edge of many maps, it‚Äôs location and climate made it difficult for habitation, and it‚Äôs planets lack of cooperation with the 5 Month Plan made it barely industrialized.
Khiberia is also culturally different from the rest of the galaxy, it relied more on agriculture than technology and spoke Russian instead of the standard English and its culture was more slavic.
In the aftermath of this whole affair, a group of nationalists and humanists (human supremacists) gathered in the Khiberian planet of Movsk to discuss plans for the future, after back and forth negotiations they finally settled on forming the HSL (Human Salvation League), its goals and objectives were clear from the start.

Avenge the Great Death by destroying every single drone in the galaxy including those residing in other planets, this sacred war of theirs would be known as ‚ÄúThe Great Judgement‚Äù.

 

Within a bunker complex stood the operations room, a space no bigger than an average room and with a lot of focus on the big hologram map of the known galaxy on the wall.
To the North laid the areas controlled by the UN highlighted in a bright blue, and to the south laid planets who‚Äôs connection were lost during the Great Death and were most likely taken over by drones, the middle space is surprisingly devoid of planets, leaving a big space perfect for space battles, westwards was the ruins if the former Earth, surrounded by a comet labyrinth made from the pieces of the latter. And eastward laid areas unknown and unexplored by humans.

The meeting room was buzzing with whispers and conspiracy talks, soon there would be a meeting, one that would decide how the Great Judgement would be carried out. Everybody there were members of the Salvation League some with higher ranks however stood out with their Red, Black and Yellow uniforms. It was only a few days ago that the HSL gained the voting rights of the former Fascist League but this meeting wasn‚Äôt open to any UN observer.

The main door to the room then opened, walking alongside two bodyguards was the League‚Äôs leader himself Dmitri Kraznov, wearing more medals than a North Korean general, you could feel his presence nearby just by hearing the dangling sound from the metal in his suit, all talking on the room seized right then and there. Dmitri looked around in silence before announcing.

‚ÄùEveryone here is dismissed, except Jacob, Yodryl, Kreebs and Nurgdorf‚Ä¶everyone else, you may leave the room‚Äù.

Everyone else then proceeds to leave in a silent but organized manner, except for the mentioned men, they were the best of best of the League, Kraznov‚Äôs friends and the biggest supporters of the cause, as even the bodyguards left to guard the entrance from the outside, the men sat down in a oval table with Kraznov at the center.

Kraznov however didn‚Äôt took his seat, he looked at the men he trusted the most and said ‚ÄúYou guys want coffee?‚Äù, he then went to a corner of the room and grabbed 5 plastic cups of coffee and filled them up on a machine, he also made sure to pick each flavor according to each general‚Äôs taste.

He served them quietly before sitting down, he sighed and looked at some paperwork, drank a bit of the coffee and looked at the map, this went on for 5 minutes, the room was cold but the mere tension could make you sweat, this technique of quiet activity was made by Kraznov to create a tense atmosphere. The generals were used to this so weren‚Äôt as effective on them.

After finishing his coffee he made a small cough before finally speaking. ‚ÄúAlright, we all know why we are here, correct? The generals nooded. ‚ÄúIn this case i assume you are all aware of the recent events down south, Yodryl?‚Äù The latter stood up with a suitcase of files and a pointer, he walked towards the map and used the pointer to mark out the southern areas within the hologram.

‚ÄùOur intelligence and that of the UN‚Äôs have located a strong migration activity to the planet of‚Ä¶Copper 9‚Äù He read from his files, ‚ÄúThat former coal mining planet? What do they need there?‚Äù Kreebs said‚Ä¶there were some small talk before Nurgdorf pointed out something ‚ÄúIs this the planet from where we located the last signal of the Solver before it vanished, maybe they are moving in to take it back perhaps?‚Äù Jacob agreed ‚ÄúIndeed, or maybe they are using it‚Äôs powers to form a new civilization of sorts‚Äù.

Kraznov placed down his cigarette. ‚ÄúEitherway, the fact that they could obtain something as powerful as this is a sign of war, even if they use it ‚Äúpeacefully‚Äù the mere fact that they are taking advantage of the thing that almost caused our extinction is a grave insult and should not be taken lightly‚Äù.

Kreebs replied, ‚ÄúThen what should we do about it? It‚Äôs not like the UN will care if a drone state is established, they might even try to become allies!‚Äù.

Kraznov then asked, ‚ÄúAny ideas gentlemen?‚Äù.

‚ÄùNew Economic Autarky Plan‚Äù, ‚ÄúMore military build up‚Äù, ‚ÄúNuclear Projects‚Äù and ‚ÄúAn AI to counter the Solver‚Äù were all very good suggestions, in the end they reached an agreement, however it is not known as no one besides the men in that room knew about it, even the guards outside the chamber were using noise canceling headphones to not hear the conversation.

With the meeting over the only thing left to be settled was the flag issue, they ended up with a design that had red and black stripes, two swords crossed and a yellow laurel wreath under it. The design was quickly adopted as a flag and soon the HSL became a galactic force.",1,1753290308.0,MurderDrones_Fanfics,0,1.0,False

Some said they cut it out because it increases testosterone levels. Of course, everyone's bodies reacts to things differently so if you notice caffeine having a negative effect it is a good thing to take note of. But I just wanted to bring in some information on the issue from an OpenEvidence search:    
  
""Recent observational and experimental studies suggest that caffeine or coffee consumption may not be harmful in PCOS and could potentially be associated with beneficial effects.¬†A 2024 case-control study found an inverse association between coffee consumption and the likelihood of having PCOS, with higher coffee intake linked to lower odds of PCOS diagnosis. Additionally, animal studies indicate that caffeine may improve metabolic and reproductive parameters in obese PCOS models. However, these findings are preliminary and do not form the basis for clinical recommendations. Observational studies examining coffee consumption in women with PCOS have not demonstrated an association with increased androgen levels or worsening hyperandrogenism.""

Of course, old school networking can be slow but it builds trust, you learn, follow through and build your reputation. That handshake and track records stand genuine more than flashy posts and ads.

Straight out of the box, the compact design caught my attention. Measuring 4.23 inches in length and 1.16 inches in width, it's small but mighty, perfect for various appliances without being obtrusive. Its dark grey and white color adds a subtle, modern touch that blends seamlessly with most kitchen decors.

I immediately tested this silicone cord organizer on my toaster, blender, and coffee maker. Attaching the organizer was surprisingly hassle-free‚Äîthe high-quality nano glue is impressively sticky, holding firm on different surfaces, including shiny and matte finishes. The durability of the silicone material is another highlight; it feels sturdy without being rigid, ensuring that it doesn't snap or deform easily. 

**Advantages**  
- Compact and aesthetically pleasing design.  
- High-quality silicone ensures durability.  
- Easy attachment with powerful nano glue.  
- Compatible with up to 70% of kitchen appliances.  

[Check AIEVE B09MZ41Z9Q price on Amazon.](https://applianceheaven.com/link/b09mz41z9q/)  

**Ease of Use**  
One of the standout features for me is how easy it is to manage cords using just one hand. The design allows for a seamless wrapping motion, which is perfect when you're rushing during meal prep. The size is versatile enough to accommodate various cord lengths, and the silicone material adds an anti-slip texture, preventing cords from unraveling.

Using a pack of six turned out to be more useful than I initially thought. With one for my air fryer, another for the juicer, and so on, I had my kitchen looking neat in no time. However, while the adhesive is strong, it‚Äôs worth noting that sticking it onto surfaces with grooves or extreme curves might be tricky. For flat or slightly curved surfaces, though, it‚Äôs phenomenal.

**Downsides**  
- Adhesive might struggle on heavily textured or curved surfaces.  
- Limited compatibility with some unusual cord types.  

**Build and Material**  
It‚Äôs clear a lot of thought went into the design. The silicone material not only feels premium but also has the flexibility to coil varying cable sizes. Being high-temperature resistant is a bonus, ensuring the organizer won't warp or degrade near hot appliances like toasters or air fryers. I subjected mine to some accidental spills, and cleanup was a breeze. A damp cloth was all it took to restore its pristine condition.

**Competing Products**  
Before trying this product, I experimented with Velcro cable ties and generic plastic cord holders. Compared to those, this cord organizer offers a more streamlined and visually appealing solution. Plus, the silicone material holds up better over time, especially when compared to Velcro ties that collect dust or plastic holders that crack under stress. Competitors offering peel-and-stick solutions often pale in comparison due to inferior adhesive strength, while the AIEVE organizer‚Äôs nano glue sets a higher standard.

**Value for Money**  
The price point (without mentioning exact numbers) aligns well with what this product delivers. You‚Äôre not just paying for cord management; you‚Äôre investing in a clutter-free, efficient kitchen. Given the quality of the silicone material, the strong nano adhesive, and the pack of six organizers included, I‚Äôd consider it a smart addition to any home.

1m7eobw,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1m7eobw/aio_my_new_neighbor_hit_my_husband_in_the_face/,AIO? My new neighbor hit my husband in the face for being nice to her dog,"We are in our 50s and just moved into a new complex. We have an outdoor communal area where we like to sit under old growth trees and read news and scroll Facebook and talk and smoke cigarettes. It's nice to meet the neighbors and their dogs, and we befriended a woman who has a dog that just adores my husband. She (the dog) beelines to him every time she sees him and gives him kisses. He jokes that the dog is his doggie girlfriend. The neighbor seemed nice enough for the first couple of weeks, but then a thing happened on the night of the local fireworks. Short story, dog owner knows dog is terrified of fireworks. Takes dog out for a walk just after the finale of the fireworks. She gets outside her door, and some citizen nearby sets off a single firework. It spooks the dog and she bolts, causing the owner to lose her house keys in the grass or shrubbery or whatever. We try to help her find the keys, walking a grid in the area. She's clearly drunk, no judgment on that, it's 4th of July weekend, but she's confused about how far she went, so we're walking a grid with the flashlights on our phone trying to help her. At this point, she's got her dog tethered to her patio railing as she's thrashing through the shrubs in a manic fashion, yelling and screaming at the dog, who's confused and scared, whimpering and barking, feeding off her energy. She's yelling ""FUCK YOU, [dog's name]!! YOU DID THIS! FUCK YOU THIS IS ALL YOUR FUCKING FAULT!!!"" I tell her to calm down, we'll find her keys, but she doesn't need to scream at her dog like that, and then she lays in to me. I remind her that out of 200+  tenants in the complex, we are the ONLY two people trying to help her, and we could just go home and leave her to her situation. Which I legit did not want to do bc of the way she was speaking to her dog. Then she gets more frustrated, screaming again at the whimpering dog, and then she hit the dog, yelling at her to shut the fuck up. You hit a dog in my presence? OOOH... It's fucking ON. BUT...

My husband convinced me to just let the incident go, as we are new tenants in the building and don't need the drama. I conceded and played nice to keep the peace. 

THEN, yesterday, we were sitting outside having coffee and a cigarette, and she came by with her dog, and told us how her dog ate all the house plants in the middle of the night. We gave the dog pets and were polite with the neighbor, had decent conversation. I'm trying to keep the peace, even though I seethe every time she comes near us.  

Maybe 6-8 hours later, we see her again. We're sitting at the picnic benches in the courtyard, both of us with our feet under the tables. We're talking, she's clearly in her cups, and she's still bitching about the dog eating her plants. And let me make a point to say that every single time we've seen her since the fireworks incident, she's made a point of telling us repeatedly that she would NEVER hit her dog. Which we know is bullshit because I literally saw her do it. Bc the dog loves my husband, she's giving him face and neck kisses, and he's giving her head and butt skritches and at one point, he's skritching her head and ears, and says something like, ""you're such a good girl"".

The neighbor yells, ""DON'T YOU BE NICE TO HER! "" and open palm, but with serious force, HITS MY HUSBAND IN THE FACE!!

Now, my husband has ptsd to the point where I won't come at him from the side to even lovingly caress his face, so this is a bigger deal than it would have been with a normal person. 

We were both so shocked that neither of us could even move, and we both had our feet under the picnic table and couldn't extricate ourselves fast enough to knee-jerk react. Which was fucking lucky for her that both of us had a second or two to squash our base instincts. I wanted to stomp that fucking bitch for hitting my husband just because he was NICE to her dog. I'm so fucking pissed and if I see her again, which I will, probably in the next several hours, I legit don't know what my reaction will be. She clearly didn't even see what she did was wrong, because after she hit him, she actually invited us over to have a drink with her on her patio. Not in an apologetic way, like ""let me make this right"", but like a, ""hey, you guys wanna hang out?""

So, AIO if I informed the office, and/or told the neighbors we've already met what she did? We've been here only one month, and she's been here 4 years. I feel like if she's shown us this side of herself after 4 weeks, the neighbors probably have seen this side of her as well. I don't want drama, but I want accountability for what she did. I have self control and would not premeditatively attack her, but she was lucky I was too tangled in the picnic table to jump in the moment, because I know me, and I know I would have, in defense of my husband. It's the next day, and his face still hurts. I don't want to press charges, or get her evicted, but I want some accountability, and want others to know to keep their distance from her, that she's unstable and unsafe, even in casual encounters.

Budget is ~3500 but could be willing to go to 4000. No pets, no kids. Here‚Äôs a list of our ‚Äúnice to haves‚Äù and ‚Äúneed to haves‚Äù - I do NOT expect a place to have everything.

Needs:

- Safe parking. Doesn‚Äôt have to be a garage/assigned but street parking must be safe

Wants:

- Sunnier weather (would Sunset be too foggy for us?)
- Easy commuting to downtown (30 min or less ideally, specifically to around financial district)
- 1 BR minimum (no studios), 2 would be nice

He looked around and processed it all. For his eyes, its grim and colorless appearance was like the feeling of running a marathon and then sitting down. It felt awkward to adjust, but he appreciated it. Justin wasn‚Äôt as enthusiastic.

The first room they saw was the front office. For a small town police station, it looked a lot like a prison. The walls were made of unpainted grey cement bricks. All of the desks, couches, and appliances looked like they had their souls sucked out of them, leaving nothing but colorless, frail corpses. Above the boys was a wide vent dripping condensation water onto a damp red carpet. The building was full of ornate yet derelict furniture. You‚Äôd think that they had just stepped into the apocalypse. Everything was in bad shape. Cracked glass separated the boys and their handlers from a receptionist who looked like a Fascist dictator. He looked at them with his pale face. The receptionist‚Äôs cold stare was almost as troubling to Shawn as the filth that littered the building. The cold concrete floor was not cleaned or even swept for dust. Everything looked broken, and he didn‚Äôt even want to look at the grimy ceiling. 

The receptionist looked into Shawn‚Äôs eyes and informed them of their destination like a judge handing down a death sentence. He slowly readjusted himself to get back to his grim work at his Byzantine administration. At the same time, Shawn and Justin were led away. As they passed the center of the room, Shawn glanced up and noticed an out-of-place religious mural on the ceiling. 

‚ÄúHuh,‚Äù he thought.

Suddenly, from the area under the mural, Shawn and Justin were forced down opposing paths. Shawn was led by one cop down one hallway, and Justin was led by another cop down a different hallway. He wondered why they were going to two different places if they were given one room number, but didn‚Äôt question it.

As Shawn looked down the hallway and all of its doors, he began to digest the soundscape. It was surreal and barren. He could hear a faint humming from the bright white lights, water dripping from ceiling pipes that fought for space like vines, and whispering coming from all directions. 

Shawn felt incredibly uncomfortable and anxious. Not only was a person he associated with dead, but this place felt at odds with all of his sensibilities. While at first it felt like his eyes were on vacation, the desolate atmosphere had increasingly gotten on his nerves. The station felt at odds with the human condition. Even the air smelled like gasoline and black sharpies. 

Suddenly, he was stopped. The cop forced him to turn ninety degrees and face an oddly decorated door. It was numbered ‚Äú726‚Äù and had a deteriorated cross on it. 

‚ÄúAt least I'll be safe from Satan,‚Äù Shawn thought. 

The cop opened the door, shoved him inside, and closed it. The room was dark except for a light which revealed a single solitary desk with the man who was wearing the red Hawaiian shirt behind it. He looked at Shawn warmly but creepily.  

‚ÄúTake a seat!‚Äù he said cheerfully before reaching for his coffee.

Shawn began to approach. As he got closer to the man, he noticed he was wearing a cross around his neck. 

‚ÄúIs this an interrogation?‚Äù Shawn asked, scared and feeble. 

The man‚Äôs expression morphed into looking worried and concerned. He reassured Shawn.

‚ÄúOh no! This is just my office,‚Äù the man said, before smiling.

His cadence was almost funny, especially because of his atrocious Texan accent, but Shawn was too put off by the phantasmagoric nature of everything to appreciate this. He sighed and prayed that he could get back to watching the Vampire Diaries soon, the mystery of Harry‚Äôs murder be damned. A moment later, he was hit with a wave of guilt over this thought.

The man looked at him, concerned. ‚ÄúI know, losing a close friend can be tough,‚Äù he said, seemingly sympathetic. 

Then he paused, interrupting himself, ‚ÄúYou do know that he‚Äôs dead, right?‚Äù

Shawn nodded. Of course, Harry wasn‚Äôt really a close friend, but he still liked him most of the time. Admittedly, he had some cynical thoughts, but quickly repressed them. 

The man held out his hand, and Shawn shook it. He then introduced himself.

‚ÄúYou can call me Detective Strangelove,‚Äù he said, emphatically.

While Strangelove‚Äôs behavior was charming, Shawn was still uncomfortable. He looked at Strangelove in a funny way.

‚ÄúOh yeah. I got it from the Kubrick film: Dr. Strangelove or‚Ä¶‚Äù Strangelove said, before pausing. ‚ÄúWhatever, you‚Äôre probably too young to have heard of that one.‚Äù

Shawn had, in fact, heard of that one. He decided not to comment, but rolled his eyes. Strangelove began fiddling about in his desk, trying to get something out.

‚ÄúSo what happened to Harry?‚Äù Shawn nervously asked, feeling guilty about his inner thoughts.

Strangelove looked up. Then he said, ‚ÄúHe died,‚Äù before continuing his rummaging. He then got out a red binder and swiftly opened a certain page under a certain tab. He got out a blue-inked pen and looked at Shawn.

‚ÄúDo you know anyone who had any issues with Harry?‚Äù he asked.

	‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶‚Äù Shawn began. He then had a thought. However, he then had a second thought and decided that his first thought was better kept locked in his head.

Strangelove could read Shawn like a children‚Äôs book and pried for information. He got serious for a second.

‚ÄúThis is a serious case, kid‚Äî‚Äù he said, before being interrupted by Shawn.

‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶ uh‚Ä¶ There‚Äôs this guy named Trent and‚Ä¶ uh‚Ä¶‚Äù Shawn sputtered.

Strangelove looked very closely at Shawn. Suddenly, Shawn straightened the tracks of his train of thought.

‚ÄúHarry killed Trent‚Äôs dog,‚Äù Shawn awkwardly but bluntly said.

Strangelove widened his eyes.

‚ÄúAccidentally! He didn‚Äôt tie the leash properly, and something‚Ä¶ some animal in the forest killed it!‚Äù Shawn cried, like he was lying to get out of a Soviet style interrogation. 

The detective then started writing intensely in his notebook. 

‚ÄúDo you really think it was a murder?‚Äù Shawn asked, fearful.

‚ÄúI never said anything about a murder,‚Äù Strangelove condescendingly responded before pausing for a second.

‚ÄúWell, we believe that based on the damage, Harry‚Äôs car was hit by a large vehicle. However, that doesn‚Äôt explain the body.‚Äù Strangelove murmured, lay back but deeply concentrated. He looked to the ceiling. 

‚ÄúWhat about the body?‚Äù Shawn asked, still fearful.

Strangelove either didn‚Äôt hear him or outright ignored him.

‚ÄúEither way, it's axiomatic that some kind of foul play is involved,‚Äù he said, before turning his head to Shawn. ‚Äú‚ÄòAxiomatic‚Äô means self-evident, or obvious,‚Äù he explained.

‚ÄúWhat about the body?‚Äù Shawn pathetically asked, his inflection and words repeating themselves like clockwork. 

‚ÄúWell, let's just say that Harry failed to negotiate good terms with Death. We found him a couple miles into the woods with all of his limbs severed and put into a pile.‚Äù Strangelove explained.

Shawn froze and looked directly into Strangelove‚Äôs eyes, horrified. Strangelove continued, ‚ÄúThe weird part is that the limbs were torn off rather than being chopped off‚Äù.

Shawn began firing up his lips, but it was for naught. Strangelove interrupted him, ‚ÄúHis head was also severed.‚Äù

Shawn was deeply disturbed, as any clinically sane man would be. It didn‚Äôt sound real, and Strangelove‚Äôs mannerisms didn‚Äôt help. Shawn looked like a cross between someone who had just witnessed a hit-and-run and someone who had just seen aliens.

Strangelove then froze, but for different reasons. He looked at something on his desk before slyly refocusing on Shawn.

‚ÄúI think I‚Äôve said slightly too much,‚Äù he commented, playfully but with an aura of resentment. 

He then got out of his seat and wandered into the dark. Shawn heard a violent click, and suddenly the rest of the ceiling lights began flickering on like a corpse being electrocuted. Now he could see the whole room, which now looked less like an interrogation room and more like a fancy jail cell. It was just as derelict as the rest of the building, but it had a bit of decadence. It was like nail polish on dirty and bitten fingernails. Carpeted walls lined with obscene biblical paintings were broken up by caged windows through which the outside world seemed like deep space. 

‚ÄúWhat time is it?‚Äù Shawn pondered.

He looked at a statue of a nude woman that lurked in the shadows. ‚ÄúWhat a trope!‚Äù he thought. Everything reeked of thick perfume. 

From the light switch Strangelove waltzed over to a filing cabinet. He began to lean down to a drawer, but was interrupted: a sleek blue telephone that extruded from the wall and emerged through the carpet began to ring. He then waltzed over to the phone before picking it up. He began to have a conversation with someone on the other end.

The conversation went on for an uncomfortably long time. As Shawn waited, he examined the room and noticed a pale-faced man wearing a thick black wool V-neck. The man was watching Shawn intently. They had a one-sided staring contest for a couple of minutes before Strangelove approached Shawn.

‚ÄúWell, it seems that Detective Valentine isn‚Äôt getting along with your friend,‚Äù Strangelove intimidatingly said.

He stared at Shawn in an incriminating way before holding out his hand. Shawn grabbed it, and they once again shook hands.

‚ÄúIt was nice meeting you, but now it seems like me and her are switching places now‚Äù Strangelove stated. 

Shawn began to rise, but he was struck down with words. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, you‚Äôll stay here‚Äù. Strangelove released Shawn‚Äôs hand, waved goodbye, and left. The one-way staring contest between Shawn, and the man and the corner promptly resumed. 

Minutes passed. The experience was like a one-sided war of attrition. The filth, lewd features, and oppressive atmosphere of this otherworldly place attacked Shawn‚Äôs mind. The man seemed as omnipotent as the sun, but as intimidating as a thug. At last, as the door made a rasping sound against the floor, Detective Valentine entered the room.

She was the same cop who had interrogated Shawn and Justin at the crime scene. She looked around the room with contempt before seating herself behind the desk. She carefully placed a pristine blue briefcase on the desk and opened it. As she organized her papers, she looked intently at Shawn. Shawn looked back. She looked far younger and less lax than Strangelove. 

‚ÄúName?‚Äù she commanded.

‚ÄúShawn Coffin,‚Äù Shawn responded.

She organized a thick stack of papers together and placed them to her left. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm Detective Valentine. For the record, that‚Äôs my actual name,‚Äù she explained, making an obvious jab at Strangelove (whose actual name was Chuck Smith). Shawn appreciated this. 

‚ÄúWe have a few questions for you, and for the sake of not only yourself, but also Harry, you should answer them honestly,‚Äù she said, intimidating but sympathetic. 

Shawn nodded nervously.

‚ÄúWhere are your parents?‚Äù she asked.

‚ÄúOh, they‚Äôre out of town. They went to New York for a business trip and entrusted me with the house. They‚Äôll be back in a few days.‚Äù Shawn politely responded. 

‚ÄúDo you have any siblings?‚Äù she asked.

‚ÄúOh. No, actually.‚Äù Shawn mirthlessly responded.

‚ÄúDo you have any relatives nearby?‚Äù she asked.

‚ÄúOh, no. My parents are quite estranged from their families.‚Äù Shawn mysteriously responded.

Valentine murmured to herself, troubled. ‚ÄúMay I have your parents‚Äô phone numbers?‚Äù she asked.

‚ÄúOh, I have not memorized them‚Ä¶ But, I can pull them up on my phone.‚Äù Shawn said, feeling a bit ashamed.

‚ÄúYes, may you do that?‚Äù she asked.

Shawn took out his phone, tapped through some menus, and gave it to Valentine. She then took out a note card and a blue pen before beginning to write down the numbers. This took a minute. During this time, Shawn dared to go on the offensive in the staring contest with the man in the corner, before quickly retreating. 

‚ÄúWhen was the last time you spoke to your parents?‚Äù she asked as she finished writing the last digit of Birdella‚Äôs number.

‚ÄúWhen they left a couple of days ago,‚Äù Shawn quietly responded.

Valentine's eyes widened in surprise. 

‚ÄúYou haven‚Äôt called them?‚Äù she culpably asked.

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Shawn muttered. 

‚ÄúThey haven‚Äôt called you?‚Äù she questioned.

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Shawn lamented. 

Valentine looked at Shawn sympathetically before asking, ‚ÄúWould you like to call them?‚Äù

‚ÄúSure,‚Äù Shawn said, restless and cynical.

Valentine handed back the phone and implicitly ordered him to phone one of his parents. He arbitrarily chose to call Birdella. A dead silence manifested itself to give emphasis to the phone‚Äôs harsh buzz. The redirection to voicemail was the punchline to the gradually dying fire of their anticipation. They tried Phineas and were thrust into the same arduous song and dance until another send to voicemail ended their misery. Valentine felt bad, but knew that she had to continue the interrogation. 

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll try and contact them one way or another,‚Äù she announced. 

‚ÄúNow tell me what happened at the first party and the night of the murder,‚Äù she asked, awkwardly snapping back to an intimidating inflection.

Shawn explained everything that had happened thoroughly. However, when talking about his journey in the forest with Justin and Harry, he slowed down before pausing. He deliberated on whether he should mention the dog. It was certainly noteworthy, but it was not found in a state analogous to Harry. He reflected on what he had and had not seen. He felt that while he had been disturbed by the killings, the weight of their weirdness had been lost on him. It was convenient not to think about it. He decided that there was no harm in telling Valentine about it.

He explained the fate of poor Bagel with as much detail as he could muster. Valentine seemed somewhat disturbed but unsure if it had anything to do with Harry‚Äôs murder. Then, Shawn continued his story, picking the pace back up.

However, Shawn soon stopped himself again. He had begun recalling the morning of the day of Harry‚Äôs death when he remembered his encounter with Trent. He was unsure whether to let the memory cross from his brain to his mouth: Trent didn‚Äôt strike Shawn as a Jack the Ripper type of character. 

Valentine gave Shawn a look. ‚ÄúThe person who caused the car crash is not necessarily the same person who killed Harry,‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúTrent came to my house looking for Harry. He looked quite angry.‚Äù Shawn swiftly confessed. 

‚ÄúWas there anyone with him?‚Äù Valentine asked, masking her intent as if she already knew the answer.

Shawn, who felt like Valentine was looking into his mind, nervously said, ‚ÄúYes, his girlfriend ‚Äî Lisa, I think ‚Äî was with him.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou mean Jessie?‚Äù Valentine chided.

‚ÄúOh, yeah.‚Äù Shawn sheepishly grumbled.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre actually looking for them right now. Their parents tell us they never came home.‚Äù Valentine sullenly explained.

The information was absorbed by Shawn‚Äôs ears and sent to his brain. His brain processed it and dreamt up a host of possibilities. Was Trent alive or dead? Was he a victim or murderer? After all, he didn‚Äôt know him that well, maybe he was skinning rabbits in his basement. It had to be someone. Wasn‚Äôt foul play ‚Äúaxiomatic‚Äù? 

‚ÄúOh God, I‚Äôm such a bastard. Having those thoughts about a dead person! Or a missing one‚Ä¶‚Äù Shawn brooded as he worked to maintain external composure.

Time flew and fell and dragged and flew like an injured bird. Shawn would answer a few questions easily before spending thirty minutes on the next one. Time felt as if it constantly warped as the length of a minute seemed to constantly fluctuate. Only the display of an electric clock, which periodically flickered on and off, with intervals varying between twenty seconds and twenty minutes, helped Shawn hold on to his sanity. Finally, things began to wrap up.

‚ÄúListen, we don‚Äôt want you by yourself tonight, so we have decided that you‚Äôll stay with Justin at his house. It‚Äôs far less isolated, and it will be easier to protect you two if you‚Äôre together.‚Äù Valentine explained.

The mention of ‚Äútonight‚Äù made Shawn feel relieved. For a second, it almost felt like the future no longer existed, with time coming to a screeching halt to do hours of backtracking. However, the mention of ‚Äúprotect‚Äù made him unsure if he wanted to be a part of that future.

‚ÄúProtect?‚Äù Shawn piped, squirming. He looked around the room like he had been broken from a sort of trance. The man in the corner was gone, but he wasn‚Äôt sure when he had left.

‚ÄúYes. While we don‚Äôt know if the perpetrator will strike again, it would be better for you to be with an adult. Aside from Mr. Graves, there'll also be a patrol car outside the house to protect you all.‚Äù Valentine softly outlined. 

‚ÄúOk, thanks.‚Äù Shawn quietly said.

The sound of the door being driven against concrete acted as a bookend to their conversation. Shawn saw Justin and his Dad talking to a cop in the hallway. Turning his head to Shawn, Justin gave him a death stare. Shawn looked away at the ceiling. He could hear a faint little tune, but he had trouble pinpointing its source.",1,1753289843.0,creepcast,1,1.0,False
1m7en3q,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReviewTheRoom/comments/1m7en3q/why_choose_the_nespresso_vertuo_lattissima_for/,Why Choose the Nespresso Vertuo Lattissima for Coffee Lovers?,"The Nespresso ENV300B has made its way into my morning routine and transformed what was once a mundane part of my day into something I genuinely look forward to. When I first unboxed it, the sleek black design immediately caught my eye. It's compact enough to fit comfortably on my kitchen counter without hogging space, yet it has a sophisticated look that feels premium. Boasting dimensions of 16""D x 7.5""W x 12.4""H, it feels perfectly balanced between being space-saving and functional. I couldn't wait to see if the performance could match its striking first impression.

**Features That Stand Out**

One of the things I've come to absolutely love about this coffee maker is its versatility. Featuring a system that brews in six different sizes‚Äîfrom single and double espresso shots to coffee cups between 5 and 18 fl. oz‚ÄîI‚Äôve got all my coffee needs covered. I‚Äôm not a morning person, and the one-button operation has been a game changer for me. There's no fumbling around half-awake trying to figure out settings; it just works. The detachable 16 fl. oz milk tank enhances the simplicity too. Whether I‚Äôm in the mood for a latte, cappuccino, or even some hot foam on plain coffee, it delivers consistently good results‚Äîand it‚Äôs dishwasher safe, which feels like a massive win in the convenience department.

[Check Nespresso ENV300B price on Amazon.](https://ngadgets.com/p/b0c5kf8yk7/)

**How It Performs Daily**

Let‚Äôs talk about performance because that‚Äôs where this machine pleasantly surprised me. The heat-up time is barely noticeable, clocking in at about 30 seconds, which feels almost instant compared to my old coffee machine. The flavor extraction from the Nespresso Vertuo capsules is impeccable, producing rich, aromatic coffee that lives up to the brand‚Äôs reputation. They‚Äôre compatible exclusively with these capsules‚Äîso yes, you're committing to them‚Äîbut the complimentary starter set gave me a good sampling of what‚Äôs on offer, with over 40 flavors to explore. I even tried some iced coffee recipes, and the results were just as good. That said, for someone like me who craves spontaneity, the compatibility with only Vertuo capsules might not be ideal for everyone.

**Positives**

- The one-button functionality ensures ease even on the groggiest mornings.  
- Six brewing size options are ideal for different preferences, including guests with various tastes.  
- High-quality milk frother makes lattes and cappuccinos effortless and caf√©-style.  
- Sustainability shine: the aluminum capsules are recyclable through Nespresso's dedicated program.  

**Shortcomings**

- Depending on where you live, the availability of Vertuo capsules can be inconvenient, especially in busy seasons.  
- The machine doesn‚Äôt support universal pods, limiting flexibility compared to some competitors.  

**Who Would Benefit From This Coffee Maker?**

This espresso machine works for those who value convenience, quality, and variety in their coffee. It‚Äôs great for individuals and families who enjoy milk-based drinks like lattes and cappuccinos as much as plain coffee or espressos. With its fully automatic operation, it shines in households where mornings are a rush, or for people like me who don‚Äôt want to spend forever tinkering with settings. However, if you're a DIY enthusiast who loves experimenting with open-system pods or ground coffee, this machine might feel restrictive.

**Product Alternatives**

I‚Äôve used similar machines in the past, including the Keurig K-Caf√© and the Breville Bambino Plus. Compared to the ENV300B, the Keurig offers more compatibility with coffee pod brands, which some may prefer. That said, the coffee itself isn‚Äôt as full-bodied or flavorful as what I get with Nespresso capsules. The Bambino Plus is stellar for those who want to customize their coffee to the nth degree, but it lacks the one-touch simplicity of this machine. Between the three, the Nespresso ENV300B strikes the best balance for busy coffee lovers in search of a premium yet functional product.

**Bang for the Buck**

Pricing, while variable, reflects the premium quality of this espresso machine and its innovative features. While it‚Äôs not the most budget-friendly option out there, what you‚Äôre getting is certainly worth the investment. Having the choice of barista-quality foam or plain coffee at my fingertips makes this an appliance I don‚Äôt regret indulging in. Comparatively, similar machines in this price range often lack both the milk frothing excellence and the sheer simplicity brought together in one compact device.

1m7ek3g,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1m7ek3g/aita_for_breaking_up_our_family/,AITA For ‚Äúbreaking up our family‚Äù?,"I got out of a very toxic relationship last year. He was verbally abusive and the first time he slapped me, I knew I needed to leave. I refused to be a woman who allowed a man to treat her like a punching bag. I went to a bar the following week with some friends and met a guy named Jay. He was super nice and we ended up spending the night together. To my surprise, he did call me the next day. Coffee turned into dinner and we soon started officially dating. We were together for about 6 months before a stupid argument broke us up. We remained separated for almost three months until he called me saying he missed me and wanted to get back together. I missed him too so I agreed. 

One morning, I shot out of bed and violently puked in the hall before I could make it to the bathroom. I figured it was maybe food poisoning but when I was sick again the day after. I started to think I could be pregnant. I had always had irregular periods, so skipping one or two was never a surprise to me. (I need to make it clear that I WAS taking birth control! I didn‚Äôt baby trap him.) A gynecologist recommended it to me and said they could help regulate my cycle. They did a little. But not much. 

A test said I was pregnant and a further blood test from my doctor confirmed it. We were having a baby. Jay and I sat down and had a long discussion. Kids were never something we had talked about as our relationship was still fairly new. But he said he had always wanted to be a father one day, and to be honest, I had always wanted my own family. A sonogram confirmed I was roughly 3 months pregnant. I literally cried watching the screen. 

I turned to Jay, and I was surprised to see he was frowning. He didn‚Äôt say much else through throughout the appointment and he was silent all the way home. When we walk through the door, I asked him what was wrong. I was flawed when he demanded, I tell him who I had slept with. I asked what the hell he was talking about. ‚Äú the doctor said you‚Äôre three months pregnant. That‚Äôs the same time we split up. Who else did you sleep with???‚Äù 

I gaped at him like a fish for a couple of seconds before I felt myself become furious. 
I screamed back that I hadn‚Äôt slept with anybody. He was 1000% the father! 

He said it was impossible as we weren‚Äôt together at that time. I said to him we had slept together a couple of days before we split, so to my math, the dates did add up. 
He said he wanted a Paternity test. I agreed. 

We made another appointment and a few weeks later we were back in the hospital. I told my midwife I was going to need a paternity test. She explained to me how that would work. She pulled out this ENORMOUS needle, and told me that she would need to penetrate down into my uterus so she could extract DNA from the baby. She did warn me that there was a risk of miscarriage. 

Well that put me off right away! I said no chance in hell! I left the hospital and Jay was pissed. He said he refused to raise another man‚Äôs child. I said I didn‚Äôt want anything from him. This was 100% his baby, but if he didn‚Äôt want to be a father, I didn‚Äôt expect anything from him. I left him in the parking lot, and ended up moving back in with my mother. I went through my entire pregnancy by myself, with the support of my friends and my mother. 

I kept the gender as a surprise to myself and I gave birth to a beautiful baby boy last month. He‚Äôs my everything. He is the spitting image of Jay and he‚Äôs my entire world. Jay turned up a few days after I came home as he‚Äôd found out I‚Äôd given birth. He asked to see his son and I let him. He took one look and immediately apologized for ever doubting me. He said he wanted to be a father and for us to be a family. 

I immediately said No. I said he hadn‚Äôt been there at all and I couldn‚Äôt be with a man who didn‚Äôt trust me. He apologized again and said he knew he was wrong. But our son needed his parents together. I held firm. He said I couldn‚Äôt break up our family. I scoffed and said we were never a family to begin with. I explained I was happy to Co-parent with him and let him have visitation, but I had no interest in getting back together. He left looking crestfallen and when I told my mom about it, she said maybe I should‚Äôve given him a chance. He was ready to step up and be a family and not all women are that lucky.

1m7eiyd,https://www.reddit.com/r/GrannyWitch/comments/1m7eiyd/hidden_witchy_or_not/,"""Hidden Witchy"", or not?","My mother's family was from the Blue Ridge Mountains in VA, my father's side is more nebulous but mostly from KY and TN. Both sides real god-fearin' and not openly witchy (because that's evil! -\_- ). Family origins are German-speaking Europe and the UK, but we've been here before the US was the US. As I am doing genealogical research into my upper and southern Appalachian families, I'm learning that any granny witches (or fellow queer folks) were well hidden. Not surprising. 

As a result, I'm trying to document old family superstitions to see if they have ""hidden witchy"" roots. 

I'm wondering if anyone here has heard of these? Are they just your average Southern superstitions, or is this more specific to Appalachia? And what are the reasons?

As a side note, I moved to Minnesota almost 20 years ago and have had friends teach me some of their Nordic witchy ways. I want to reciprocate, but I'm not close with my family (ie, I'd have been well-hidden back in the day). I'm very slowly reconnecting and learning from ancestors I've never met. 

\- - - 

\- **You** ***have*** **to put a mirror above the fireplace.** My mother complained about this one. Apparently my great-grandmother (VA) insisted but never gave a reason why. I'd love to know. I haven't found good sources online. 

\- **You can't put anything on top of a the Bible.** My great-grandma (KY/TN) treated the Bible like a sacred object that must be protected at all times. She never told me what would happen if I put my coffee mug on it though. She'd get real mad if I even joked about it. 

\- Contrast that with, **putting documents, photos, etc into Bibles** to the point where you can't really close it anymore (VA family). I've read a little bit about this. Again, my family never told me why you had to do this, but apparently you had to. My mom seems to think it's more about keeping records for genealogy. I think it's more of a Southern Christian tradition (my friends in MN don't have such traditions). 

\- **Hold your breath when passing a cemetery.** VA family. Again, why? I was never told. You just did it. 

\- **Itchy ear, hot ear.** Someone is talking about you. VA family. I've heard about this one. I think it also might me more of a general-Southern thing. 

\- Raining when the sun is out, **the devil is beating his wives**. I mentioned this to my MN friends and they looked at me as if I gone crazy. haha 

\- **Horseshoe above the entryway to the bedroom**. I know this one, but wanted to throw it in here anyway. I'm not blood related to my Grandpa, but he's my Grandpa. His parents were Irish-American and Irish-born from NYC (classic American immigrant tale). What I can't remember is the orientation of the horseshoe, but I may be able to ask my folks.

1m7eeff,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1m7eeff/i_just_dont_click_with_my_roommate/,I just don't *click* with my roommate.,"Hey y'all, so I'm a student living in a shared flat with 3 other students, two guys and one girl. We're all in our 20s. All of them did their bachelor together, although one of the guys moved in a year after me, the other two already lived there. I live here for almost 2 years now, although I have been abroad for 6 months.

I get along pretty well with the two guys (one a little better than the other), we laugh together and sometimes drink a coffee together and fool around. We're not best friends but it's decent.

I just can't seem to *click* with the girl tho. I'm not sure if we're just not compatible or if I'm doing something major wrong. Sometimes we have good talks, but most of the time it's really hard for me to keep a conversation going with her, especially because it seems like we have a pretty different humour. I can hardly make her laugh and if we have a conversations, it's mostly deep talk. Sometimes I would try to ask her about her day etc. in order to start a conversation and she would only give me one word answers. I would assume she maybe had a rough day, only for me to hear her laugh out loud with my other roommate 10 min later. 

I tried copying the kind of things my roommate does to make her laugh, but it seems she only finds it funny if he does it. Granted, they know each other way longer then I know them, but still. They're both in long lasting relationships, so it's not like she's into him or something like that. Also we have a group of friends together with most of them seemingly going along nicely with her, so it doesn't seem like she's the problem.
Sometimes she's really talkactice and asks me about my day etc., making me feel like it finally clicked, only for her to almost ignore me the next day.

It came to a point where it really bothers me. I can't help but feel very awkward most of the time when I'm alone with her, because I don't really know what to say to her, and she seems to doesn't know either  (I think it bothers her too). It's also awkward to ask her directly, like, what am I supposed to say? ""Hey I noticed this awkwardness between us, you feel it too?"".

I think one major issue is that we both have a lot of university related stress, so most of the time we're both studying. Because of that, there's not a lot of new things going on, hence we both don't know what to tell each other. Most of the time when a conversation is actually flowing, it's because we didn't see each other for a few days. But that's actually the opposite of what I expect of a shared flat, because I want to get along nicely with my roommates and socialise with them.

So idk how you guys can help me, just need some other point of view I guess...maybe someone experienced something similar?",1,1753289255.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

My current thoughts/to-do list

\- Potentially move floor lamp to other side of couch, get a side table and table lamp were floor lamp currently is. **Definitely would like more lighting/table options - suggestions welcome!**

\- Paint accent wall a red-orange (thinking Behr Kalahari Sunset)

\- Eventually a new coffee table, likely still wooden but a bit more modern looking to coordinate with the TV stand better

\- New throw blanket for couch

\- Curtains? Not sure of colour - maybe cream to lighten things up a bit?

I've torn the engine completely down. Just looking to start cleaning it up. Going to make it into a coffee table by putting the block on its end and having the cylinders point forwards.  

Looking to clean all the parts up now. Everything is of course coated in oil and 25 years of grit on the engine block. 

Aluminum block, steel sleeves, steel rods, aluminum pistons, and then the crank is of course steel. 

Can I just soak everything in simple Green pro HD? 

I use the same stuff to clean aluminum carburetors and it doesn't seem to discolor them. I could just fill a large Rubbermaid container with a simple green pro HD solution and then soak it in there for a couple of days or whatever. Unless someone thinks that's a bad idea?

I want to put the rotating assembly back when I'm finished. So everything needs to be cleaned up to some extent.

I guess I'm just here looking for some support, validation, commentary, and discussion regarding my quitting. I'm worried it won't get better.

I went from a couple years of taking 400 or so large, full lung inhalation drags of disposable 5% nic salt vapes a day to COLD TURKEY quitting 10 days ago.

ChatGPT tells me each full inhalation from that device was the equivalent of an entire cigarette. I was vaping the nicotine equivalent of 20 packs of cigarettes a day for at least a year.

I've quit in the past for a year or two at a time, but it was never this effing hard.

For starters, Ive been extremely dizzy, light-headed, and a strong pressure in my head behind the eyes. Is that because of just how high a nic dose I was at? I never experienced that before.

I've also been remembering my dreams all the sudden which I hate because I don't have happy dreams.

And the day to day is rough....like I'm desperate for dopamine...been slamming coffees, drinking too much booze, smoking huge amounts of weed, anything to try to scratch the unscratchable itch. I'm making it through but dang...

In the past when quitting, it started to get a lot easier around the 10 day mark and by 2 weeks I was a lot better.

I am 10 days in and my goodness ... I am not much better at all. It's rough. And even then dizziness, though not as severe as day 3, is pretty substantial still.

1m7ebf7,https://www.reddit.com/r/MSCCruises/comments/1m7ebf7/msc_seaside_7_day_mediterranean_cruise_review/,MSC Seaside 7 day Mediterranean cruise review,"Short version‚Ä¶
I read so much bad stuff that I was a tad anxious about our upcoming Mediterranean cruise which would be the first cruise for most of my family but in the end we had a great time and left wanting to go again.

Long version‚Ä¶ 
Who cruised? A family of 8, ranging from 70yr olds (that are world travelers), four adults in 40s, two kids ages 6 and 11. I should also point out that we‚Äôre a glass full kind of family and like to travel so while I was anxious I knew we‚Äôd make  the best of it no matter what because we‚Äôre having a family trip. Three of us had done a Disney cruise before and I already knew it wasn‚Äôt going to be like that because what can üòÜ

We were in MSC Seaside, Fantastica level and got Deluxe drink package and browse internet when the cruise was booked.

Overall cruise: I thought the boat was really nice, the first two days we kept finding new areas.

Cabin: We all found our rooms to be good size, we had balconies and enjoyed using that part. TBH we were coming from four days in Barcelona and the Ibis hotel room we stayed in was smaller than the cruise cabin üòÜ. My parents had an issue with their toilet and someone came out to fix it within the hour. Our steward was nice not amazing just ok, if he missed something he would make it right quickly (missing towel for example, no more toilet paper).

MDR food: ok one of the things I was more anxious about was the food but with the exception of three items that were ordered within our group of 8 during the entire 7 days the rest was tasty, we had some good meals. The kids menu changes every day too and they gave my 11yr old the choice between the two menus, so she went back and forth. A few days they also had a server for the kids who was bringing  their stuff out faster. The MDR did take nearly the 1:30hrs each time, we had early dining at 6pm. 

Buffet food: The pizza that everyone likes is very good, we ate it several times for lunch or dinner or late snack üòÜ overall the buffet food had a lot of good solid choices, plenty for anyone to pick from. It is very crowded at times so beware of that. 

Specialty dinning- Teriyaki: we did this on our last night and it was very nice! The chef was so good! Would definitely do it again, all the food was good.

Drinks: Get the package, any package but just get it, it‚Äôs so much easier and I promise you you‚Äôll want something once you‚Äôre on the boat, be it a soda or a bottle of water. Specially if like us you‚Äôre getting off at Italian ports and enduring the heat, getting those four cold water bottles in the morning, and then more after coming back is so nice! We had the deluxe package offered in Mediterranean cruises, which included everything under $16, and a 20% discount on champagne. The max is 15 alcoholic drinks, we were only on one day at sea and even then didn‚Äôt meet the max but that day I probably had 8 drinks, and the rest of the days I probably had 4-5 drinks. With the package we were also able to get cappuccinos and other coffees in the mornings, we got wine/beer/soda at dinner too, though there I‚Äôm not sure if anything would‚Äôve been included as regular dinner. There‚Äôs no freestyle machines on the MSC Seaside, so you need to get soda cans from bars. Overall I think even if you don‚Äôt drink alcohol a drinks package is helpful in the Mediterranean, the coffee from the buffet was subpar for our group‚Äôs taste, the buffets close at intervals, the juice machines are only available during breakfast and you‚Äôll definitely want bottled water!

Internet: The Browse package was not great, we upgraded to the Browse and Stream and that was great and we had no issues.

Shows: On this particular cruise the cast was a set of 4 singers, about 8 dancers and various extra artists like a salsa dancing couple, a few circus type folks like balance and hula hoop. Our family went every night üòÜ so it got a smidge repetitive seeing the same folks but the four singers were AMAZING so we liked going back to see them!

Cultural differences: Yes, every announcement and the intro for the shows is done in at least four languages, five if someone answers back in German when they say hello in German at the nightly shows LOL We‚Äôre a bilingual family English/Spanish from Mexico and USA and a few of us have a laughable amount of French so while it was a long it didn‚Äôt seem tiresome at the shows. Another difference is that this cruise is treated as a hop on hop off boat, every day there‚Äôs new passengers and those leaving, meaning EVERY DAY there‚Äôs a safety drill in five languages üòÜ
It felt like many of the cruise workers we interacted with the most were not fluent in English or Spanish, communicating with them at times was not easy. I thought that being a cruise leaving from Barcelona meant that Spanish would be widely spoken but that was not the case. The staff do wear a tag with the flags representing languages they speak but sometimes it felt it wasn‚Äôt consistent with fluency. The staff at guest services and excursions were fluent in many languages or someone was available in your language, which was nice. We made it work and just part of not being in the Americas!

Staff: I did find what others said about staff being just so-so true. I wonder if it‚Äôs because the tips are included? There‚Äôs no incentive? I don‚Äôt know but no one was particularly attentive. For example in MDR if we asked for something out of the ‚Äúnorm‚Äù like ketchup for kids fries or butter for the bread it seemed to become an ordeal üò¨. The bar tenders were great but were overwhelmed (cruise was at capacity) so we all needed some patience there.

Laundry: I prepaid the 40 items wash and fold and while we really needed it because the cruise was in the middle of our entire vacation if you‚Äôre just going to the cruise don‚Äôt do it, see above on communication issues with staff and this was one, I could not get straight info on it and I hoped for the best üòÇ once my clothes were picked up.

Our whole family would do MSC in Europe again,  we enjoyed doing a cruise, visiting different cities and enjoying meals and shows at night. The kids had a great time going to the water park and pools almost every day.  The adults enjoyed the frozen drinks and shows! And it was at a price point that made it possible for all of us to come.

At 3:42 a.m., the cabinet didn‚Äôt whisper. It screamed.

A shrill alarm from her tablet dragged Jade Pereira from a half-sleep. She scrambled to the kitchen, the screen a nightmare of red graphs. The system wasn't just unstable; it was convulsing, fighting itself. The mister was firing in frantic, useless bursts while the heat lamp surged, turning the delicate enclosure into a sauna.

‚ÄúNo, no, no!‚Äù She wrenched open the side panel, the heat hitting her like a physical blow. The main controller was offline‚Äîthe failsafes had failed. Her prototype ESP32 rig was trying to compensate, but it was like a student pilot trying to land a crashing jumbo jet.

Her breath caught. This wasn't a brownout. This was the system trying to cook itself from the inside out.

Ignoring the tangle of wires, she yanked the main power cord, silencing the chaos. In the sudden quiet, she could hear the drip of condensed water sizzling on the hot lamp. She had minutes before the temperature plunged and sent the plants into shock.

This was it. The manual override. The one thing she'd built but hoped to never use.

She grabbed her cracked tablet, tethered it directly to the rig, and began a frantic dance of code and commands. She bypassed the fried controller, forcing the fans to spin, rerouting power from the lights to the cooling unit. It was a high-wire act with the life of her entire collection as the stakes. For an hour she worked, sweat dripping from her brow onto the keyboard, her world shrinking to lines of code and the faint, hopeful hum of the fans kicking in.

Finally, the temperature graph on her tablet stabilized. The humidity crept back toward the green zone. She had wrestled the machine back from the brink. The plants were safe. For now.

A smell of ozone filled the air. A thin wisp of smoke curled from the ESP32 rig. She‚Äôd saved the plants, but in bypassing the safety protocols, she‚Äôd fried the system‚Äôs brain. It was running on raw, dumb power now. A machine on life support, with her as the frantic doctor.

Joel stumbled in with a thermal coffee just as dawn was breaking, his eyes widening at the chaotic nest of wires and Jade‚Äôs exhausted posture. ""Did your garden go full exorcist again?""

Jade just pointed a trembling finger at the smoking rig. ‚ÄúIt did,‚Äù she said, her voice raspy. The win felt hollow. She hadn‚Äôt fixed the problem; she‚Äôd just created a bigger, slower one.

Getting 6 local people together at a brewery for drinks and conversation. For this idea, breweries are better than a bar, and better than a full restaurant dinner.. It's the perfect in-between, and Burlington is full of them! The first meetup is this **Monday (7/28)** and I'm looking for more people to round out the tables.

The idea is pretty simple: I manually put together small groups that seem like they'd have good conversations together, everyone meets up for about an hour, pays for their own drinks, and we see what happens. I'll also send everyone 10 conversation starter questions beforehand in case anyone wants some backup if the chat stalls. Mix of ages and backgrounds, just regular people who want to meet other regular people around town. I'll do my best to curate the best table based on your background info and responses to the Google Form questions.

I've been thinking about how Burlington has this great community feel but it's become harder to actually meet new people when we've all become more hesitant to strike up conversations with strangers. Most of us feel awkward randomly starting to talk to someone at a coffee shop or bar, but it wasn't always this way! Something's shifted in how we interact, I'd say we've gotten too used to our digital bubbles. So this is my attempt at fixing that.

If you're interested in meeting some new faces, there's a form to fill out. I try to use common sense about who might click when putting groups together.

Google Form: [https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfpRDpdzqh6wYfMuBhB4nAtEjQsKVSUO3bm1tu1li-l5exnJQ/viewform?usp=dialog](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfpRDpdzqh6wYfMuBhB4nAtEjQsKVSUO3bm1tu1li-l5exnJQ/viewform?usp=dialog)

Really just curious what you guys think! Maybe suggestions, or thoughts on what kind of location or activity you'd like to see. Figured breweries are a good place to start since the conversation flows naturally, easy to set up your own separate tab, there's food to share if the group wants to stay longer, and non-alcoholic options for those who prefer a clear mind when meeting new people.

  
Oh, and if you haven't already subscribed, be sure to check out my twice weekly email covering local news, weather, events, live music/djs, comics, food/drink deals, restaurant reviews, community meet ups, volunteer opportunities, puzzle hunts, and updates on the new Burlington Table, how it's going, and what people are saying about it:¬†[https://btownbrief.beehiiv.com/](https://btownbrief.beehiiv.com/)

And if interacting with people isn't your thing but you still want to get out of the house, stay tuned for Thursday's edition where I'm dropping my first Burlington Puzzle Hunt. It has clues found in the newsletters plus field bonus questions that get you out to local landmarks or businesses to hunt for clues in person.

the last time it happened was yesterday, i cut off a ‚Äòfriend‚Äô that ended up back stabbing me and saying the nastiest shit to me, so I politely cut him off and moved on silently. well it so happened that i walked into a coffee shop and saw his reflection (he was behind me the whole time so we never made eye contact) but damn i felt so anxious and all of those feelings were concentrated in my solar plexus. i of course act normal, very chill but in the inside i‚Äôm like AHHHH!!!

anyone else? any tips on how to control it? or why it happens? 
it‚Äôs just weird because once i decide someone is out of my life, i have no problem cutting them off and pretending they don‚Äôt exist but my inner feelings show the opposite.

Saturday, 7.19: We landed in Orlando after our ungodly early flight and made it to our resort by around 10am. We stayed in a 2 bedroom villa with savannah view at the Kidani Village part of Animal Kingdom Lodge along with my sister-in-law, her husband, and my 5 year old niece and  3 year old nephew. Our room wasn't ready yet so we headed to the Kidani Village pool to swim. This is probably one of my favorite pools on property. It has a great splash pad for the kids, I like the zero-entry part of the pool, there is a good amount of shade from trees, and it has a fun slide. 

We swam for a few hours and then my wife and I headed to the Sanaa Lounge for the bread service, which was great as always. I also had the Prickly Pear Mule. I've had better mules before but it was still tasty and refreshing. Our room still wasn't ready after this so we headed over to Epcot.

We are all passholders and so were able to get a spot in the VQ for the Test Track preview and so went and did that first. Overall I think the new version of Test Track is quite a bit better than the old. I liked the ""story"" more and I really enjoyed the different practical sets. At the end of the day though I think Test Track can only be so good of a ride and so it still isn't a must do for me. Also the queue is very bland and boring.

It was extremely hot and humid (probably the worst I've experienced in all my times at Disney, including other summer trips) so we decided to just knock out a few other quick things before heading back to the hotel since our room was now ready. The highlight for me was the Goofy Gone Fishing slushy at Communicore Hall. I love blue raspberry and gummy sharks so this was right up my alley and was perfect to help with the heat.

We headed to our room to unpack and I was very impressed. I had stayed at AKL once before but this was my first time in a 2 bedroom villa and it was awesome. There was plenty of space for us to spread out and truly feel at home. And having 3 full bathrooms for 6 people was great. Our balcony was also huge (since it runs the full length of the villa) and we got great views of lots of animals. 

We had Kroger deliver groceries and so made some frozen pizzas for dinner, headed to the campfire for some roasted marshmallows, and then relaxed by watching the first half of Cars before going to bed. 

Sunday, 7.20: We woke up and drank coffee on our balcony while watching animals, then made some breakfast in the room before heading to the pool for some more swimming. Afterwards my wife and I walked over to Jambo House to get lunch at The Mara. We both had the shrimp and chicken bowls and they were very tasty and were one of the rare dishes at Disney that actually feels kind of healthy. 

We then took the bus to MK. It was another brutally hot day and so we spent most of it doing inside rides, browsing stores, and pin trading. We also went to the Hall of Presidents for the first time since Obama was president and we were both surprised by how much we enjoyed it. The movie that plays for it was really well done and seeing so many animatronics at once was pretty cool.

Another fun thing was I was in need of a haircut but wasn't able to get a reservation at the Barber Shop. However, I decided to see if they had any walk-up availability and I was luckily able to get in right away. I know it's kind of odd to get a haircut at a theme park but this was my third time and it's a pretty good price and they always do a great job. It also helped to cool me down a bit to get some hair off my head.

At around 8pm we managed to find a spot near Liberty Tree Tavern to watch the new parade, which was our main reason for coming to MK on that day. At around 9:20 the parade finally made our way to us and we were all greatly impressed with it. I thought the floats were all awesome and there were lots of cool effects. My only critique would be that I wish there was less ""blank space"" between the floats themselves, so hopefully they add some more dancers and characters.

After the parade we beelined to the castle to watch Happily Ever After. Next, we rode Buzz Lightyear and then my wife and I decided we wanted to watch the 11pm parade and so we headed to Frontier Land where we found a great spot by the new hat store. The parade was just as good the second time, and once it was finished we meandered our way to the bus stop.

Monday, 7.21: We woke up Monday, made breakfast, and then packed and checked out. We headed back to MK where we had a fun but uneventful day of riding rides. We also took advantage of the 40% off dining for passholders deal and had lunch at the Diamond Horseshoe. I was pleasantly surprised with the meal there. The stuffing and mashed potatoes were both really good and after the discount it was around $26 per adult which felt like a great price for ""all you care to enjoy"". 

After lunch we headed back to the hotel to get our stuff and then head to the airport. Luckily we are already in the 60 day window for our next trip so I don't have to wait too long to come back. Hopefully it is a bit cooler then but it is Florida so I certainly won't count on it.",0,1753288349.0,WaltDisneyWorld,0,0.4,False

My hospital does them in the birthing suites in the maternity ward, which is a nice room and I was familiar with it from my first birth. My appt was at 8am and I got there and they checked baby (still breech) and watched his HR for awhile. I had to be NPO after midnight so I‚Äôm glad my appt was early. 

Then the nurse came in and gave me an IV, and I got a shot of a medication to relax my uterus. I was told it could make my heart race and it did only slightly, like I had one cup of coffee too many. 

Then the OB and midwife came in, and started the procedure, intermittently checking the ultrasound and checking HR of baby. Baby did not give a crap about anything that was being done, I don‚Äôt think his HR fluctuated at all. He did not want to come out of my pelvis as much as needed, and every time they moved the head, it would spring right on back. They attempted from a few different directions for probably 8 min, then called it. It felt like I thought it would, basically like a way too forceful massage on an area of your body that is super tender. It was not pleasant but manageable, and only for little spurts of time.  

My baby has been breech for a long time, basically every time that we checked since the anatomy scan, so my OB wasn‚Äôt super optimistic on getting him to move, but I‚Äôm glad we tried. We are scheduling a c section for 39 weeks and I will continue to do spinning babies and all the things until then!

TL,DR: ECV on frank breech baby unsuccessful. But not a horrible experience, and I am glad I tried it!

Title might sound strange at first but hear me out: cookbooks are not ordinary books - they're often hardcover! I can stand them up much easier for more unique photo opportunities for insta (thats a very ""gen z"" statement, I am aware). I also assume these books showcase some great equipment and technique advice incorporated into the recipes, not forgetting about amazing pictures and photos.

I started collecting cookbooks, already have some classics such as julia's ""french cooking"", Dr. Seuss' ""green eggs and ham,"" judi barrett's ""cloudy with a chance of meatball"" etc., but the problem is, in the end I rely mostly on ""internet"" when it comes to recipe search, as well as ""techniques."" I also tried asking ChatGPT to read these books to me but they mentioned something about ""copyright violation"" - whatever that means.

Question to you reddit cooks: how do you utilize your cookbooks? Do you actually use them? Do you consider them a necessity, hard to replace, or is this just an aid, and pretty object on the shelf? Can you describe the scenario when you use all those amazing books? I've tried using them as an improvised coffee table, a flyswatter, and a home defense weapon but I feel like i'm not learning anything about cooking from them.

I.e. i can imagine that If I were to cook a classic dish I would open all cookbooks I own that could contain the recipe I am looking for in order to compare them, and get the general idea what is essential for given dish.

You could also share your top 3 cook books and argument why these are worth buying, how these helped you to move forward as a cook (pro or not)

So, I and my friend went camping to small island in the middle of a lake. Soon after we landed and sat down to drink some coffee, a mouse walked near us. It sneaked in a campfireplace, was there a moment and then it went to the bushes. A couple hours later when I went fishing, it tweeted and came near me. When I switched my fishing spot, it followed me and went right by me.

At evening the mouse came many times near us, squeked sometimes when moving, ran some zigzag, gaze us from its hiding spots and went away after some time. When it was dark, it came near our table and I almost stomped it. Still the mouse visited our tent's hallway a couple times and of course it came to check us in the morning. I had left a roach for it and it had eaten it's head at night.

So, the big question is, why did a wild mouse behave like this? Was it after me and my friend because of food or was it just curious?

I met her from work (We work part-time at a restaurant), so I don't see her too often, like 3 times a month or so. If she rejected me, it wouldn't have been too awkward, but I made sure there were all green lights before I asked her. e.g., her saying she likes my name and us making coffee together

I was feeling low monday and Tuesday because she went quiet over text and didnt message and I was like, Maybe she regretted her choice, but this morning she apologised for going MIA and said that the date couldn't happen this week because work changed her shifts and she was sad about it. I've asked if she is free next week; I'm just waiting for a reply.

  
She said that she wanted to drink with me and go out, like on a night out. So when I asked her out, she was like, Let's go out today and tomorrow and get drinks. I joked, saying a 2nd date straight after the first is too fast and she said I'm making her blush.

  
So I do think she is genuinely busy because she said wednesday and thursday. Any places in london you guys recommend? She works in central so I'm happy to take the train there.

So, there's a girl in my coaching. Haven't interacted with her till now. Classes began approx 20 days back. I usually sit in the front row and she on the back side, once when I was moving out from my position to return home, I noticed a young lady checking me out. She is pretty no cap. Another day, while walking out of the classroom I waited for her and matched her pace and hoped to initiate a conversation with her but couldn't muster up the courage and diverted my way. Yet, another day we had an accidental eye contact during the class. I have been thinking of asking her out for a coffee date since then but since then she has been consecutively absent for 2 days. Today, she came but after the class she was walking in a fast pace to her pg and while I mustered up all the courage I could but I couldn't do it.

I have decided that tomorrow's going to be that day. Either, I am going to arrive little late tomorrow, expecting to sit in her vicinity to strike a conversation and if that's not how things work out then I will ask her out post class (obviously, if she comes tomorrow üòÖ).

He didn‚Äôt plan to be here‚Äînot really. But plans stopped mattering the day they took the ranch. Since then, it was just steps on a path, one job feeding the next. This was just another piece of the puzzle. Just a little cash. Just another nameless stop.

Hello there!

If you've found your way here, then hopefully, you are like me in looking for a fun roleplay partner.

Like the title says, I'd love to explore a modern day take on the 'Bonnie and Clyde' story, though I was also very much inspired by the recent trailer for GTA VI. Two people who get tangled up together and find themselves spiraling head first into a world of crime and feeding off a combination of money, violence, and sex.

I intentionally left who your character is open and flexible so we can explore who she is, how they get tangled together, and what her motivations for staying with him are.

If this interests you, I'd love to  hear your thoughts and ideas on the prompt and the characters, and see what kind of fun we can get them up to as they mix with and run from law enforcement and other criminal elements.

I do want to stress a certain level of detail and literacy. I really prefer more than just a few sentences. I generally write AT LEAST a couple paragraphs, but more is even better. Additionally, I generally prefer to write in the third person, but first is fine if you want it.

I'm okay with descriptions, celeb faceclaims, or IRL faceclaims depending on what you want and like. I can provide a list of my favorites, but I'm also open to anyone you're looking to play.

In my rp's, I generally don't like to label characters to dom/sub roles. I like a neutral balance of power and the fluidity for our characters to act on whatever we're feeling at the time.

Let me know if you're interested, have any ideas you wanna throw by me, or have any questions!",1,1753288015.0,AdvLiterateRP,0,1.0,False

Reconciliation + Communication:

White candle and Yellow candle (Communication) Small jar Orange Peel Rose Bud Instant Coffee Lavender salt Red Chili flakes Nutmeg Taglocks Personalized Petition Crystals you feel drawn too Fire proof bowl Lighter Incense

First I cleansed with a vanilla incense and grounded myself, because this is a reconciliation between an SP and I‚ÄîFor grounding myself I played a spell playlist I made and sat quietly singing along to the songs for meditation.

Once grounded I carved my name and his name + d.o.b. On the white candle along with the phrases ‚ÄúAll is forgiven‚Äù and ‚ÄúOpen road to love‚Äù. On the yellow candle I carved my sigil for open communication. I then anointed both of those candles with a protection oil I made as well as nutmeg.

In the jar, I did my tag lock and his (I had his name and sweet sentiments cut out from letters I‚Äôve gotten from him in his handwriting), Lavender, rosebuds, orange peels, salt, instant coffee(because I want this to work rather quickly), red chili flakes( for a spicy sex life between us), along with a personal petition written in red ink (His tag lock folded in the petition towards me as many times as I could fold)

While that sat to the side, I set up the candles side by side in a fire proof bowl, and the crystals I felt drawn to: Rose Quartz, amethyst, and a regular quartz. While lighting the candles I recited

""Any and all things preventing a reconciliation between X and X are cleared from our path. All is forgiven between X and X. The road to love between X and X is open."" (I got from another spell while researching and I liked it, so I incorporated it) When done reciting, I used some of the wax from the candles to seal my jar.

Sweetening Jar:

Sugar Instant Coffee Rose bud Nutmeg White Willow Dragons Blood Resin Sweet Oil Tag Lock Personalized Petition Red candle Small Vile Incense

I started by cleansing the vile jar with a rose incense, again grounding myself to a playlist of some of the songs we‚Äôve listened to before.

In the jar I started with Sugar, instant coffee, Rose buds, nutmeg, white willow, petition with his tag lock folded three times towards me, my tag lock, and sweet oil to top off everything. I then carved sigil for sweet thoughts on the candle and anointed with sweet oil and nutmeg.

I closed the jar, and sat listening to the music while thinking of some of the times he was the sweetest to me while holding the jar. Once I was done, I closed it and place the red candle on top lighting it and letting burn until it was done.

I said my goodbyes and thank you and grounded with meditation and a quick tarot pull.

From this, I have had a major confidence boost and this tingly feeling on the spots he‚Äôs kissed on my neck before. It‚Äôs like they‚Äôre radiating üòÇ

For the tarot pull, I thought the cards were interesting and really confirmed that it pulled on those energy cords between us. We‚Äôve been no contact for about 3 weeks now and I just have this great feeling about these spells. Later this week I plan on doing another layer and trying my hand at a lust spell/obsession spell(I don‚Äôt want to hear about the consequences, I‚Äôm positive this is what I want and it‚Äôs part of my bigger plan.)

The cards that jumped before I could even formed my question was Reversed Queen of cups, The Devil, Ace of Cups, and the Empress. The King of Cups also jumped in reverse.

I was hoping to hear some of yalls thoughts on the spells and cards that jumped after my work was done.",1,1753288011.0,blackmagic,1,1.0,False

1m7dsg0,https://i.redd.it/efldgxpwgnef1.jpeg,I don't think people realize how insanely smart and dangerous Rui is,"Bro can create whole ass robots and other gadgets as a teenager, with limited money and resources.

People praise Mafuyu for getting 100 on exams, but Rui is out there organizing a project in a bunker he secretly created in his wardrobe to help humanity colonize Mars in the future.

Can you imagine what he could do if he were to be hired by a proper company or even the government? Not only would he become a star, but WW3 would've began *FOR HIM*.

With proper payment, resources, more knowledge and experience this guy can straight up create an army.

I wouldn't be surprised if one Apri Fools event would be Rui casually creating a time machine that also stirs coffee and ends up creating a timeline where Mafuyu is the one abusing her mother",115,1753287838.0,ProjectSekai,32,0.99,False

She was so sweet like honey pie . Then those clingy feelings were brewing like coffee in hell. Then suddenly I was expressing those feelings as well as she was . Then she said that she wanted to say the L word üò≥and then I just said it . And we were just talking sweet to each other and telling each other how we loved each other very much , which I know is very much not healthy . 

She said hi the other day and I said it back then I noticed on telegram the conversation was deleted and I was glad because those clingy feelings simmered down. I think we both were scared . And I'm sure as hell not mad at her for deleting the conversation. 

However, I received a message from her I think just an hour ago saying hi so I'm not sure what's going on. 

If someone who is reading this is good at psychology or knows about clingy feelings could pm me much would be appreciated, thanks . ",5,1753287813.0,ForeverAlone,2,1.0,False

I've been testing tons of apple cake recipes lately, and I wanted to share some incredible finds that'll make your autumn extra special. Here are some standout recipes that'll have everyone asking for seconds:

This classic never disappoints. The combination of tender apple chunks and warm cinnamon creates the perfect comfort cake. It's incredibly moist and fills your house with that irresistible fall fragrance. Perfect for breakfast or as an afternoon treat with coffee.

When you want something delicious but don't feel like spending hours in the kitchen, this is your go-to recipe. Just dump the ingredients in your slow cooker and let it work its magic. The result? A cake that tastes like you spent all day baking.

#3. Gluten Free Apple Cider Donut Cake
Missing apple cider donuts but need to stay gluten-free? This cake captures all those beloved fall flavors without the gluten. The texture is incredibly tender, and nobody will guess it's gluten-free.

#4. Apple Cake With Cider Glaze
The cider glaze takes this cake to the next level. It soaks into the warm cake, creating an incredible flavor that'll remind you of apple orchards and crisp fall days. The glaze adds just the right amount of sweetness.

#7. Apple Raisin Cake
The addition of raisins adds natural sweetness and an interesting texture contrast to the tender apples. It's like a cross between a fruit cake and an apple cake, but way better than any fruit cake you've tried before.

*Disclaimer: This is my very personal opinion :D*

I'm a fanatic when it comes to beautiful dice. I know that for many people, dice are just a means to an end, and simple plastic dice work just as well as fancy glass dice with a built-in coffee machine...  
Anyway, I'd like to get some nice hollow metal dice. They are always sold in a beautiful set that includes every common die **ONCE**. And that's my problem. When I'm running Call of Cthulhu and I drop the heavy, jingling dice of fate into the dice tray to see if the Deep One will tear the investigator to shreds, I don't want to roll the D10% (D10.0, D100, call it what you want!) multiple times in a row to represent the bonus and penalty dice!  
That's not acceptable to me. **One roll ‚Äì one fate ‚Äì one decision**.

I have already written to three stores to ask if it would be possible to purchase the D10% of the respective set individually, for a corresponding price of course, in order to be able to represent the bonus and penalty dice. All declined... Only for purchases of 15+ sets.  
All the individual dice on offer only ever include the common D6/D10/D20. Never D10%...

However, one shop wrote to me saying that they know that most people then take D10s, and I'm sitting here wondering how that's supposed to work? How am I supposed to distinguish between the ones and tens?

So: Does anyone have any idea or perhaps roll this way themselves and can enlighten me as to how it's supposed to work? :(",0,1753287679.0,callofcthulhu,13,0.14,False
