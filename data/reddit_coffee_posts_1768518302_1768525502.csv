She was wearing a mask because she is getting over the flu. It was pretty well lit but still semi-isolated. A man came up with his one year old daughter and started pretending to shoot us screaming “bam bam bam” and getting his daughter to join in. He said something else in Spanish, but I don’t know Spanish so I’m not sure what it was? 

It was pretty frightening and I was spooked out so my colleague walked me to my car. I’m in Texas so the fear was that he could have a real gun. I know this isn’t specifically woman related, but doing that to two women standing alone in a parking lot is not cool. 

Now please don’t take this the wrong way, my intention is not to insult someone’s culture, but some of my friends who are Hispanic said that they joke around like that in their culture, and I’m taking it personally. I’m guess I’m failing to understand what the joke is.

For some reason, I have had a horrible, horrible week. I typically cook at home, and restaurants/eating out can kind of be a trigger for me, especially when I’m by myself.

However, this past Monday, I ate a normal lunch and dinner, then ate a huge second dinner at like 10pm (ordered food, which I never do) …. The next day, I ate a small lunch at work, then didn’t eat anything else at all (I know this is really bad) … The next day, (yesterday) I didn’t eat at all until I finally was at the end of my rope after walking the dog at 5pm, woke up from a nap, ate a block of cheese and a sleeve of saltines, two pieces of texas toast, baked cookies and ate two of them… Then today was the real trainwreck. Started the day with taco bell breakfast, ate my usual lunch, got a coffee after work, and ordered two full meals for myself from Hardee’s. That’s three different takeout orders (including coffee) in a single day, when usually it’s a rare treat. It was like I didn’t even think and it just happened without me making decisions about it. The cherry on top is that it got so dark by the time I was done gorging myself that I took the dog on the shortest little run ever and she was so sad. I feel horrible for eating so terribly and so much and wasting so much money. I guess I could just use some words of encouragement.

I’m heading to Dharamshala + Bir for 2 weeks starting 17th Jan for a little workation + mountain reset.

Plan is simple:

- Work in the daytime (or at least pretend to 😅)
- Explore cafés, sunsets, and good conversations
- Do a few experiences like Triund trek, paragliding in Bir, and other random adventures that seem like a good idea in the moment

Would love to meet like-minded people there — travelers, remote workers, creators, founders, or anyone who’s just there to vibe peacefully.
I’m also lowkey looking to meet people who are into building things — because yes, somewhere between trekking and chai I’m also secretly scouting for a cofounder to start something in tech/business 🚀 (no pressure, just good conversations).

If you’re in the area during the same time and want to:

- join for a trek / café hopping
- share plans
- work together from a café
- or just say hi

…drop a comment or DM.

PS: This is a safe, chill meet-up vibe — respectful & drama-free. Bonus points if you’re the kind who likes mountains more than club music 😄

We're building the 4th option for 911 - community-based crisis response that actually helps.



For years, people in our communities have called each other instead of 911. We've helped neighbors, removed partners who wouldn't leave peacefully, supported people through overdoses when they refused hospital, and been there when the system failed.



\*\*Now we're making it official\*\* - Hopefully one day we can be licensed, insured, trained, legal.

We will be documenting our journey climbing out of the cracks of the medical, family and justice systems in BC Canada.

How do I create/build real bonds with people? 

I had multiple close friend groups in grade school but struggled to find close friends since graduation. In college I always had friends in class but they either fell off or never quite progressed. I started to think maybe I was putting off a weird vibe that I didn’t realize but people are almost always down to hangout but only if I’m the one to initiate. I’ve had multiple friends that would hangout with me often like go to concerts, sports events, hiking, coffee, etc but it was always me reaching out and if I stopped then the friendship eventually just dissolved. When I go to group parties people run up to me to talk, say they’re so happy to see me, tell me it’s been too long and that we need to hangout soon but the text never comes. Then I see them doing things with each other on Instagram all the time. Being the only one putting effort into a relationship makes me feel like it’s fake and it’s depressing to feel like I don’t have real friends only acquaintances. I’ve never had a fight with a friend, owed anyone anything, I’m not possessive or strongly opinionated and I’m not flakey. I have a long term partner and a best friend that I’m very close with but besides that I have like 2 friends that actually ask me to hangout or invite me to their group events occasionally. 

A few months ago my best friend from high school met some of the people at a party I was invited and brought her to. I wasn’t close with them but recently found out that they have booked a weekend trip away together. I was surprised I wasn’t asked since I’ve invited her to group trips before where the only person she knew was me, introduced her to everyone, and we had so much fun. I feel it’s not my place to ask why, I’m happy she has made other friends but I’m worried since she has other close friends now shes going to drift away. 

It seems like people do like to be around me when I make the plans and I’ve found people with similar interests but I’m 30 years old and don’t have many relationships past acquaintance. Can anyone provide insight on what I might be doing wrong or why people don’t try to build the relationship? Am I a weirdo and I don’t know it??  ",1,1768524921.0,socialskills,1,1.0,False
1qe1k6q,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1qe1k6q/can_anyone_give_advice/,Can anyone give advice?,"TW: Depression

I feel so lost right now. thought my ex and I were going to get engaged. We talked about it months prior to the breakup. We were living in a new city and had adopted a cat and our routines became very different. He worked 6 days a week and my new job was causing me lots of stress so I was trying to find a new one. I was very overwhelmed and irritable and snapped at him a couple times. I was absolutely in the wrong for that.

However he led me to believe we were okay by planning more dates and being affectionate. I only found out later he was trying to overcompensate for losing feelings for me. He continued to talk to me about marriage and vacations and xmas plans right up until the breakup. So I honestly was traumatized by the suddenness of the breakup.

He became cold and distant immediately which was a mind fuck for me. Since the day before he kissed me and told me he loved me. I now realize he was so emotionally numb and overwhelmed but he hurt me a lot. He made me feel unwelcome in the apartment so I moved out right away and moved in with my mom an hour away. Quit my job, left the city and the cat we shared.

I got severely depressed and honestly felt like giving up. It was quite scary since I’d dealt with mental health issues like OCD and anxiety but never depression. I texted him very vulnerable about how I was feeling and trauma dumped about my mental health. I immediately regretted it and still do. He was kind to me and made sure I got help but insisted he is helping me as a “friend”.

2 weeks later he reached out severely apologizing for how the breakup went. He realized how traumatizing it was for me now that he wasn’t feeling numb and overwhelmed anymore. He suggested we meet for coffee and was now very open to speaking. Also mentioned the possibility of couples counselling.

However I called him a couple weeks later and he was very blunt that he did not want to get back together and had “no romantic feelings for me”. I felt quite led on with this hot and cold behaviour. I cut contact with him completely and said I couldn’t just be his friend.

I believe he is going through some sort of crisis. He’s not acting like himself, he told me he’s going to go to therapy since he has a lot of issues. I.e. how he handled the breakup. I just don’t recognize him, so part of me hopes the man I loved will come back and we can work things out.

But also this breakup has been such a nightmare and I feel ashamed of my actions. My emotions have been all over the place and it was scary for me to have been in such a dark place. All my friends and family know about it. They practically know everything about our relationship since I was in survival mode and needed people to talk to. It just feels like my relationship I thought was so amazing is now ruined yet I miss him and love him and want him back. But how could I keep dating someone when them leaving put me in the lowest point of my life. I have no job anymore, no friends in this new city and he’s just living in our old apartment with his same routine.",1,1768524879.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

we hit it off really fast. for about two weeks before our first date, we were on the phone every night for hours. he called me his boo and his princess, said he wanted to spoil me, and talked about how we were both getting a tiny bit attached already. he told me i was exactly his type (tall, model build, curvy, confident) and he liked that i had a soft but playful personality.

when we finally met in person, it was amazing. we went out for drinks, had great conversation, flirted a lot, and had fun. but apparently, i made a joke that was misunderstood and made him feel like he “couldn’t meet my demands.” we’re sitting there having drinks and he’s reminding me how he asked me to send him my sizes so that he can take the list of the stores that i like and get me things because what he wants to do is spoil me, and me being a little drunk, made a lighthearted joke like, “oh so you’re not just gonna take me shopping?” he looked clearly thrown off, but it didn’t mess up the energy — he said, “of course i would take you. i just wanted your sizes.” i had no idea, but apparently this comment made him feel like i was bratty and demanding. we ended the night at a really nice hotel, didn’t have sex, but had a lot of conversation. we cuddled all night, he held me in his arms the whole time, and it felt so natural and close.

after that night, though, his energy changed. he got a little distant. i noticed he didn’t call when he said he would. i’d mentioned jokingly that i could be “bratty” over the phone and i think he took it the wrong way. a couple of days later, he sent me a long text saying it felt like nothing he did would ever be enough for me, that i seemed like i’d never be satisfied, and that he couldn’t keep up with the level of “demands” i expected. he also said he had fun but didn’t think he could please me.

i responded calmly, clarified that i wasn’t actually demanding and that my comments were meant playfully, and told him i respected his decision but wanted to explain my side. i ended it with something like, “it’s okay, i understand your position. i wish you well.” he reacted to my message with a thumbs-up emoji and didn’t text again.

a few days passed and after talking to my mom and sister about the situation, i realized i might have come off too final. with them both knowing me, they said they could understand his position and how i might have come off like i just wanted to go back and forth instead of just being pleased with what he did and offered. i really did like him, and i missed him. and if I’m honest, rereading that text that he sent, I kind of felt like he wanted me to reassure him that he *could* please me rather than defend my point and “brattiness” and “wish him well.” so i texted him again, apologized for how my tone might’ve sounded, and told him i genuinely appreciated how sweet and attentive he’d been. i said i’d love to meet for coffee and talk if he was open to it. he read it right away, then later replied:

“ok we can meet for coffee for sure.”

i texted back, “okay that’s great, i’m free sunday if that works for you.”

he read that message instantly too, but hasn’t replied yet, and it’s been almost 24 hours. i’m fully aware of his busy schedule — he’s a director of operations at a major university and also has two kids. if i’m honest, we didn’t text all that often when we were good (an occasional “thinking about you” and heart reaction); we more so talked on the phone for hours at the end of his long workday. so him reading texts right away doesn’t 100% worry me. i just feel anxious because i know i sort of dropped the ball.

but now i’m anxious. i don’t want to chase him, but i also don’t want to play games. i really liked this man. we had chemistry, he treated me like a princess at first, and i honestly think we just miscommunicated. i know he’s a dad and has his younger child half the time and older one full time, so i don’t want to seem inconsiderate of that.

my question is: what should i do now? do i wait for him to respond about sunday? should i send a soft, friendly “hope you’re having a good day” text, or would that look desperate? do older guys just need more time to process?

any honest advice is appreciated. i’m trying to learn from this and not repeat the same mistakes. thank you! xo",1,1768524816.0,dating_advice,11,1.0,False

I’m heading to Dharamshala + Bir for 2 weeks starting 17th Jan for a little workation + mountain reset.

Plan is simple:

- Work in the daytime (or at least pretend to 😅)
- Explore cafés, sunsets, and good conversations
- Do a few experiences like Triund trek, paragliding in Bir, and other random adventures that seem like a good idea in the moment

Would love to meet like-minded people there — travelers, remote workers, creators, founders, or anyone who’s just there to vibe peacefully.
I’m also lowkey looking to meet people who are into building things — because yes, somewhere between trekking and chai I’m also secretly scouting for a cofounder to start something in tech/business 🚀 (no pressure, just good conversations).

If you’re in the area during the same time and want to:

- join for a trek / café hopping
- share plans
- work together from a café
- or just say hi

…drop a comment or DM.

PS: This is a safe, chill meet-up vibe — respectful & drama-free. Bonus points if you’re the kind who likes mountains more than club music 😄

1qe1ef6,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1qe1ef6/the_shape_of_what_i_never_was/,The Shape of What I Never Was,"I took the wrong road.



There is something I messed up in my life. Yet, I have everything anyone could envy: I have a beautiful house, I have a handsome husband who loves me and whom I sincerely love, I practice the job of my dreams, and at a time when everyone complains because life is hard, I am preparing wonderful vacations on the other side of the world. I lack nothing ; I even have an enormous amount of excess. I am a beautiful woman, and I “carry my age extremely well,” as I am often told. I have a perfect life.



Yet, I missed something.



In high school, there was this girl I liked so much. I loved everything about her, she calmed me, she made me dream, and every thought I had of her was like wrapping myself in a warm, soft blanket.



It was probably because my mother, quite devout, hated lesbians, but it was never something for me. So I preferred to imagine that I was a man, the best that girl could have had, and I would have done everything in my power to make her happy and do anything for her. It wasn’t really what I was that mattered, but rather her. I could have been the sun that warms her skin, the wind in her hair, or the fur of a cat beneath her fingers. I would have given half of my life to be all of that.



Then there was Tania. I must have been twenty or twenty-one, I don’t know anymore. We attended the same dance class, and I lived only for those two sublime hours on Wednesday afternoon. I was far behind the other students, and Tania always stayed a few minutes longer, while all the others were in the locker room, to help me correct my posture. I couldn’t even look her in the eyes without blushing.



At university, there were Martina’s dimples, the high-heeled boots of the art history professor, Chiara’s crop tops, and Kamilla’s hair, which was exactly the same color as her skin. The smell of Kamilla’s hair too, it was the warm, soft blanket.



I chose to ignore it and draw a line under all of it. I completely anesthetized myself and followed the road everyone expected me to take. I fell in love with an extraordinary man, and I still proudly share his life today. Yes, I love him, truly.



But today, in my life, there is Charlie. I met Charlie through a group of friends, and I see her quite often. I did what was always expected of me, so of course, Charlie is a friend. We see each other at dinners with friends, we go for coffee together, and we go shopping together. Yet, deep inside me, when Charlie looks at me with that slight smile on her lips, I would give anything to be the rain that beads on her cheeks, her sheets that rustle against her skin, the last rays of sunlight that die behind the rooftops of Paris and make her eyes shine, eyes that seem almost orange. I would give anything to be the man of her dreams, and I would do everything in my power to make her the queen of my life. The queen of Paris. The queen of the world.



I’m so f\*cking in love with Charlie.



It is my secret. I will take it with me to the grave. Thank you for reading this.",2,1768524445.0,TrueOffMyChest,1,1.0,False

Personally (25, AFAB, masc) still trying to work with a doctor but I've moved 4 hours out from his office and that is unfortunately the closest specialist. Still have messages and telehealth, but even then I recently had to miss an appointment due to bad Internet. Testosterone makes me lose weight no matter what I try, but without it I struggle with muscle loss and crackling joints. It's difficult to choose what's more worth it. Synthesised hormones are proving to be too harsh for a reason that I simply cannot find out right now, but I'm hopeful there could be other options. I'm desperate to the point of using my emergency vial before talking with my doctor about other options, but that's why I thought posting here might be good.

Has anyone had success in managing their symptoms through more natural means? I'm taking zinc and a combination of beef kidney, heart, & testicles right now that have helped but they've plateaued a bit in what they can do for me. Creatine and L-Thianine are usually in my routine as well, I put those in my morning coffee with powered collagen to help boost energy. When I am in the habit of working out, I've found time and time again that I have to shovel at least 2 blends of pre- and post-workout powders to not experience burnout. This routine can get pricey and after a recent move, I've fallen off of it and noticed a big difference.

What's throwing me off more recently is the joint issues that I've been experiencing. I've had to brace my bad knee more and in the last year developed a ganglion cyst that I go through cycles of wrapping to avoid it resurfacing. Collagen definitely helps and there are some other joint health options that are out there.

Mostly just hoping for anything anecdotal about what's helped you or anything about your own struggles. I've been struggling with a lot of frustrations about my body for what doesn't work right and what should have had the chance to work right, so even just knowing that I'm not alone in this is more than welcome. :-)",1,1768524355.0,NCAH,0,1.0,False

Watches the way they move, the way they breathe, the way their lives slowly wear thin around the edges, and when it finds something it desires, it keeps it.

It catalogs every tenant it swallows, and it remembers them perfectly. 6A never forgets its tenants, and it never gives them back. Tonight, we stand at the threshold of a space that doesn’t just watch… it wants.”

\-6A-

I don’t think I have much time left, so I’m going to try and get this all out before there’s nothing left of me that remembers how.

If this sounds dramatic, I’m sorry. I know how it sounds. I know how that title looks and if I’d read something like this a month ago, I would’ve, just like you, justifiably, rolled my eyes, assumed it was some attempt at creepy internet fiction, and moved on.

But I don’t think I exist anywhere else anymore. Not really. And if I don’t write this down now, I’m afraid the only place I’ll exist at all is inside these walls.

My name doesn’t matter. Even if I gave it, I’m not sure anyone who used to know me would recognize it. Or remember. Or care. 

A month ago, I was living with someone I loved. I’d moved across the state for her. New city, new job, new everything. I left what little family I had and the handful of friends I trusted because I thought, stupidly, that this was my chance at a real life. A shared one.

We’d been together three years. We’d had fights, sure. But I thought that was normal. I thought we’d do the messy, difficult thing and come out the other side stronger. I thought we’d have kids one day. I thought I had time.

Turns out I didn’t.

One morning, she woke up quiet. Too quiet. She wouldn’t meet my eyes. She sat on the edge of the bed, hands twisted in the sheets, and told me she “needed space.” It was the kind of phrase that doesn’t sound real when it lands. Like something from a show you don’t watch closely.

By that evening the space she needed was the entire apartment, and I was the thing that didn’t belong in it.

It wasn’t a screaming match. She was calm, almost gentle. That somehow made it worse. She had clearly been living with this decision long before I knew it existed. To her, it was already over. To me, it ended in a single day.

I didn’t have family to run to. I’d burned too many bridges trying to keep my head above water for the last few years to have anyone I could crash with. The job I’d moved here for barely covered my half of the rent we used to split. Alone, it was impossible.

So there I was: one suitcase, a backpack, half a charge on my phone, and nowhere to go that night except out.

It’s funny how quickly your life shrinks down to immediate needs. You stop thinking about goals or dreams or five year plans. Everything becomes: 

“Where am I going to sleep?” 

“What can I eat that doesn’t cost anything?” 

“How long before she changes the locks?”

I sat in a cheap diner nursing a coffee I couldn’t afford, scrolling rental listings like I was looking through the obituaries. Everything was too expensive, too far, too “must have three times monthly income” for someone who’d just watched their life implode.

Then I found it.

“Studio apartment. $350/month. Immediate move-in. No deposit. No credit check. No questions.”

If that sets off alarm bells for you, congratulations, you’re doing better than I was.

At the time it felt like a hand reaching down into a pit and grabbing me by the collar. I didn’t think about why it was so cheap. I didn’t think about why there were no photos of the inside. I didn’t think about why the listing said “vacant long-term” in small gray letters at the bottom.

I just saw the word “immediate.”

I called. A man picked up on the second ring, like he’d been sitting there waiting.

“Yeah,” he said, after I asked if the unit was really available. “You can come by today if you want.”

There was no application. No awkward tour. He met me in the lobby, slid a clipboard across a dusty little table, and pointed to a spot to sign. His eyes looked tired in a way that made me feel guilty for existing.

“Place has been empty a while,” he said, handing me the key. “People like newer buildings these days.”

It didn’t sound convincing then. It sounds even less convincing now.

The first time I walked into the apartment, it felt…unremarkable. That’s the best way I can put it. Old beige walls, scuffed floorboards, a kitchen that had seen better decades. The air had that stale, faintly sour smell of a place that had been closed up too long.

But it was quiet. 

It was mine. 

For the first time since that morning, I closed a door and no one was on the other side waiting to tell me to leave.

I slept on the floor that night, my rolled up hoodie as a pillow, my suitcase as a nightstand. I cried a little. Not in the loud, cinematic way. Just that dry, exhausted crying where your face crumples and your body shakes but nothing much comes out.

I told myself it would be okay. I had a place. A starting point. I could rebuild from here.

I really believed that.

The next morning, I found my wallet in the freezer.

I stared at it for a full minute before touching it, like it might be some kind of trap. Frost had collected around the leather. My cards were stiff inside. I had no memory of putting it there.

My brain tried to make sense of it.

You were exhausted.

You’re grieving.

You were half asleep.

You probably put it there without thinking.

It wasn’t like it levitated inside the fridge overnight. If anyone had moved it, it had to be me. There was no one else.

So I forced myself to laugh, a thin, hollow sound that bounced off the cabinets and died.

“Nice one,” I muttered to myself. “You’re really nailing this ‘new start’ thing.”

I decided to be more careful. To pay attention when I put things down. To stop drifting around in that numb haze where everything feels like it’s happening in a dream.

It didn’t matter.

The next day, the bathroom door handle felt…wrong.

It was just a little thing. The knob seemed a few inches closer to the hall than I remembered. I measured it with my hand, palm to frame, like that would prove anything. I told myself I was used to the layout of my old place, the one I’d shared with her. Muscle memory. That was all.

But once you start doubting your perception, it spreads. It’s like a crack in glass. Small at first, then branching out like a spiderweb covering everything.

On the third morning, I woke up to find my suitcase fully unpacked.

Every shirt folded and placed in drawers. Jeans hung neatly in the closet. Toiletries lined up on the bathroom sink. Even my socks were paired, which is something I rarely bothered with even on good days.

I sat on the edge of the mattress I’d dragged in and tried to remember doing it. Maybe last night? Maybe I’d finally snapped out of it and done something productive and my brain had just…erased the effort?

But I couldn’t place the feeling. No vague flash of folding, no sense of “oh, right.” Just a blank.

“Okay,” I whispered. “You’re tired. You’re sad. That’s all. People forget things all the time.”

I started leaving my phone’s voice recorder on when I went to sleep, just to prove to myself I wasn’t doing things and forgetting them. That’s how far it got, that early. Me, arguing with empty air and my own reflection like I could win.

The first time I played one of those recordings back, it was just eight hours of soft breathing, occasional shifts of the mattress, and the distant hum of pipes in the walls.

No footsteps.

No sounds of drawers opening.

No rustling of clothes.

But when I checked the apartment again, the couch had moved six inches to the left.

It was around then that I found the first note.

I only saw it because I dropped a razor behind the toilet and had to bend down and shove my hand behind the tank to fish it out. The porcelain on the back of the tank was dusty, except for a finger wiped line where someone had placed a folded scrap of lined paper.

I unfolded it with wet hands, trying not to smear the ink.

‘Stop sleeping if you want to stay you’

That’s all it said.

No name. No date. The handwriting was jagged, like it had been written in a hurry or with shaking hands.

I laughed when I read it, but it stuck in my head like a splinter. Every time my eyes drifted shut after that, I saw those words.

Still, people leave weird shit behind. It didn’t have to mean anything. Maybe some teenager wrote it to freak out a roommate. Maybe it was some kind of edgy inside joke. Apartment graffiti.

That’s what I thought, until I found the second one.

It was under the fridge. I only noticed it because something kept rattling every time I walked past, a thin bump, bump, bump, like a trapped insect. When I pulled the fridge forward, a folded note slid out and fluttered onto my sock.

The dust underneath looked undisturbed, like nothing had been moved in years.

The note itself, like the other, had one line written in the same hastily inked font. 

‘The doors move when you do’

I didn’t laugh at that one.

After that, I started looking. I tore through the kitchen cabinets, checked under drawer liners, ran my fingers along the undersides of shelves. The apartment didn’t make me work hard.

In the cabinet above the sink, on the back panel, someone had written a phrase in faint pencil. 

‘It rearranges us first’

The word “us” landed in my gut like a stone.

I stared at that sentence so long my eyes burned. The light in the kitchen buzzed and flickered above me. Outside the small window, I could hear the muffled sounds of traffic, people talking, normal city noise. Life continuing in straight lines while mine curled in on itself inside my cramped studio.

I told myself that if someone had gone through the effort of hiding notes like that, they were probably not in a good place mentally. That didn’t mean they were right. It just meant they were scared.

The problem was, I was scared too.

From then on, the changes came quicker.

I’d walk from the kitchen to the bathroom and notice that the hallway felt two steps longer. Not a lot. Just enough that my body registered the difference a split second before my brain caught up. Like a song played at the wrong speed.

The bathroom mirror seemed slightly taller one morning. The towel rack a few inches lower. The light switch on the opposite side of the frame. I stood there with my hand in the air, fingers groping for a switch that wasn’t there anymore.

“You’re thinking of the old place,” I muttered. “Her place. Stop doing that. It’s not the same layout.”

But my pulse was pounding so hard my vision trembled.

Objects moved too. Not just my wallet and toothbrush. Bigger things. The mattress shifted closer to the window. The kitchen table edged toward the door. Once, I woke up with my head at the foot of the bed and my shoes lined up neatly beside my face on the floor, toes pointing inward like they had been watching me sleep.

I stopped sleeping well. I’d jolt awake multiple times a night with the sick feeling that someone had just stepped out of the room. My dreams, when I had them, were of hallways that never ended and doors that opened into copies of the same room over and over.

I became hyperaware of the walls. Of the way sound moved through them. Of tiny, almost imperceptible creaks that seemed to answer my breathing. I’d hold my breath and swear I could hear the apartment exhale.

On Day 9, if you can call them days, when you barely sleep time feels like chewing gum, I noticed the vent cover in the main room was slightly crooked.

It hadn’t been crooked before. I was sure of that. The screws on the bottom right corner were pulled out a bit, exposing a thin slice of darkness.

I don’t know why I dragged a chair over and stood on it. Some part of me already knew nothing good comes out of opening hidden spaces in horror stories. But this wasn’t supposed to be a horror story. It was supposed to be my life.

Behind the vent was a shoebox pressed tight into the duct. It took a stupid amount of yanking and swearing to pull it free, dust cascading down onto my face.

Inside were photos.

Some old, some newer. Different sizes, different types of paper. All of them had been taken in this apartment.

An older man sitting on the edge of the bed, staring toward the door with wide, hollow eyes.

A woman crouched in the corner of the kitchen, her hands clamped over her ears, mouth open in a sound the photograph couldn’t capture.

A kid, maybe eight years old, standing in the bathroom doorway, half of his body blurred like he’d been moving as the picture developed.

And one Polaroid with a date scribbled on the white border. ‘Six years ago.’ A man stands in the middle of the main room, shoulders slumped, looking past the camera. He looks tired in a way that made my chest hurt.

Behind him, the apartment looks…wrong.

The hallway is longer than it is now. Or maybe narrower. The perspective feels off, like one of those optical illusions where lines bend where they shouldn’t. The walls seem to tilt inward. The door to the bathroom is where my kitchen window should be.

I put the lid back on the box and shoved it away from me like it might bite.

It didn’t occur to me right away that, if those photos were here, those people weren’t.

Not until I found the tapes.

They were in the coat closet. I found them when my jacket sleeve caught on a nail and when I yanked the sleeve away to hard it pulled back a slice of drywall just enough to reveal the edge of a plastic case. Behind the loose panel was a narrow cavity full of junk, old receipts, a cracked phone, socks with no pair.

And a small camcorder, battery compartment crusted with age.

I found a charger at a pawn shop two blocks away. I almost didn’t go. A very, very rational part of me wanted to throw the camera out and move on. But curiosity does the same thing desperation does. It makes you ignore warning signs.

The battery took a charge. Against my better judgment, I hit play on the first file.

The screen lit up with the same walls I was sitting between.

The man from the Polaroid sat on the floor, back against the bathroom door, hair sticking out in sweaty clumps. His voice shook when he spoke.

“If anyone finds this,” he said, “don’t…don’t move in here. It learns you. I know that sounds crazy. I thought it was me at first. Stress. Drinking. Whatever. I thought I was just losing it.”

He laughed, a frayed sound, eyes darting around like he expected the apartment to interrupt him.

“It moves things. Just little things, at first. You’ll think you’re doing it. That’s how it gets you. It makes you doubt yourself. Then it starts changing the rooms. The doors don’t stay put. You wake up and the hallway is longer, or the bathroom’s on the wrong side. You try to leave and end up back where you started. It…”

The video glitched. Lines of static crawled down the screen.

When the image stabilized, he was closer. Sitting where I was sitting now. He looked straight into the camera.

“Once it knows you,” he whispered, “it keeps you.”

The footage cut off.

I sat there for a long time after the screen went black, listening to the soft wheeze of the camcorder and the thud of my heart. My reflection in the darkened TV looked pale and stretched.

The thing about hearing someone else describe your nightmare is that it doesn’t make it less real. It just means someone else was awake before you.

After that, everything got worse.

Sometimes I’d walk to the front door and there’d be a little extra space between it and the wall. Sometimes less. Once, I reached for the knob and my hand closed on empty air. No door. Just unbroken wall where it should’ve been. I blinked, and it was back.

The cheap ceiling light in the main room seemed higher each day. The kitchen felt narrower, forcing my shoulders inward as I moved. The bathroom mirror showed more wall behind me than there should have been.

I’d put my keys on the counter and turn around to find them on the floor. I’d swear I’d left the faucet off and hear water running anyway. I’d find food in the fridge I didn’t remember buying, half a jar of pickles, a slice of birthday cake in a plastic container, a Chinese takeout box with someone else’s handwriting on it.

The handwriting that started showing up in the margins of my own notebooks.

Sometimes it looked like mine. Sometimes like someone else’s. Sometimes like it was trying to be mine and not quite getting there.

Little notes, in the corners.

‘It remembers where you stood’ 

‘Stop trying to leave’ 

‘It’s been longer than you think’

I started having gaps in my memory. Not small, forget-where-you-put-your-keys gaps. Whole evenings gone. I’d look up and realize the light had changed, and I didn’t know what I’d done in the hours between.

Once, I came to standing in the bathroom, my hands pressed flat against the mirror. Written across the glass in soap, in my handwriting, were the words:

‘You’re apart of the layout now’

I wiped it away so fast I cut my knuckle on the edge of the frame.

I don’t know how long I’ve been here now. The days stopped lining up after a while. My phone’s clock keeps glitching, resetting to strange times. Sometimes the date jumps backward. Once it showed a year that hasn’t happened yet.

Calls don’t go through. Texts sit in “sending” limbo until I receive the ‘failed to send’ message or they vanish completely. The few people I managed to contact early on either didn’t respond or sent one word replies that didn’t sound like them.

Did I actually call them? Did I dream it? Did I imagine their voices? It’s getting harder to separate what I know from what the apartment wants me to think.

I’ve found other things, too. An envelope wedged under a floorboard, full of expired IDs from people I’ve never met. A ring at the back of a kitchen drawer. A pair of glasses on top of the cabinet so dusty they must have sat there for years.

None of it is mine. All of it is in my home.

Sometimes, late at night, when I sit very still and force myself not to cry, I swear I can feel the apartment thinking. Not with a mind, exactly. With intention.

The walls feel too close. The corners feel like they’re folding inward. The air tastes stale, dead, like it’s been exhaled too many times.

I keep catching myself doing things I don’t remember deciding to do. Rearranging the table. Moving the mattress. Closing doors I don’t remember opening. Once, I woke up with dust under my fingernails and the vent cover on the floor. The shoebox was back inside the duct, as if I had carefully put it there.

I don’t remember doing that. But the box didn’t walk back on its own.

That’s what scares me the most now. Not that the apartment is changing, but that it’s making me part of the process. Like I’m one more component it’s rearranging. One more piece of furniture it’s finding a place for.

When I listen very hard, I feel like I can hear echoes behind the plaster. Not voices, exactly. Just the sense of others. People who stood where I’m standing. People who thought they were getting a second chance with cheap rent and no questions. People who left notes and tapes and warnings that no one came in time to read.

I don’t think anyone came for them. I don’t think anyone remembered they were here once the apartment finished with them.

I can feel it finishing with me.

My thoughts are getting thinner. Sometimes I reread what I just wrote and it feels like someone else’s story. Sometimes I catch my reflection out of the corner of my eye and don’t recognize myself. For a split second, I see someone older. Or younger. Or someone who isn’t me at all.

I don’t know how this is going to end for me. I don’t know if there’ll be a body for anyone to find. I don’t know if the landlord really knows what this place does or if he just sees tenants go in and lists go back up when they “move out.”

All I know is that the apartment doesn’t like emptiness. It fills itself. With belongings. With memories. With people who think they have nowhere else to go.

If you’re reading this, and any of it sounds familiar, if you’ve ever walked into a too-cheap, too-empty place and felt it watching you back, please listen.

Don’t come looking for me.

Don’t try to find this building.

Don’t answer any listing that sounds like mine.

And if you ever see a studio advertised as “vacant long-term, immediate move in, no questions asked” for far less than it should cost…

don’t move in.

The apartment I’m in is empty again.

And it’s waiting.

Wanting.

“In the end, the tenant of 6A drifts into the fabric of the apartment, another life quietly absorbed by walls that remember far too much.

\-6A-

I don’t think I have much time left, so I’m going to try and get this all out before there’s nothing left of me that remembers how.

If this sounds dramatic, I’m sorry. I know how it sounds. I know how that title looks and if I’d read something like this a month ago, I would’ve, just like you, justifiably, rolled my eyes, assumed it was some attempt at creepy internet fiction, and moved on.

But I don’t think I exist anywhere else anymore. Not really. And if I don’t write this down now, I’m afraid the only place I’ll exist at all is inside these walls.

My name doesn’t matter. Even if I gave it, I’m not sure anyone who used to know me would recognize it. Or remember. Or care. 

A month ago, I was living with someone I loved. I’d moved across the state for her. New city, new job, new everything. I left what little family I had and the handful of friends I trusted because I thought, stupidly, that this was my chance at a real life. A shared one.

We’d been together three years. We’d had fights, sure. But I thought that was normal. I thought we’d do the messy, difficult thing and come out the other side stronger. I thought we’d have kids one day. I thought I had time.

Turns out I didn’t.

One morning, she woke up quiet. Too quiet. She wouldn’t meet my eyes. She sat on the edge of the bed, hands twisted in the sheets, and told me she “needed space.” It was the kind of phrase that doesn’t sound real when it lands. Like something from a show you don’t watch closely.

By that evening the space she needed was the entire apartment, and I was the thing that didn’t belong in it.

It wasn’t a screaming match. She was calm, almost gentle. That somehow made it worse. She had clearly been living with this decision long before I knew it existed. To her, it was already over. To me, it ended in a single day.

I didn’t have family to run to. I’d burned too many bridges trying to keep my head above water for the last few years to have anyone I could crash with. The job I’d moved here for barely covered my half of the rent we used to split. Alone, it was impossible.

So there I was: one suitcase, a backpack, half a charge on my phone, and nowhere to go that night except out.

It’s funny how quickly your life shrinks down to immediate needs. You stop thinking about goals or dreams or five year plans. Everything becomes: 

“Where am I going to sleep?” 

“What can I eat that doesn’t cost anything?” 

“How long before she changes the locks?”

I sat in a cheap diner nursing a coffee I couldn’t afford, scrolling rental listings like I was looking through the obituaries. Everything was too expensive, too far, too “must have three times monthly income” for someone who’d just watched their life implode.

Then I found it.

“Studio apartment. $350/month. Immediate move-in. No deposit. No credit check. No questions.”

If that sets off alarm bells for you, congratulations, you’re doing better than I was.

At the time it felt like a hand reaching down into a pit and grabbing me by the collar. I didn’t think about why it was so cheap. I didn’t think about why there were no photos of the inside. I didn’t think about why the listing said “vacant long-term” in small gray letters at the bottom.

I just saw the word “immediate.”

I called. A man picked up on the second ring, like he’d been sitting there waiting.

“Yeah,” he said, after I asked if the unit was really available. “You can come by today if you want.”

There was no application. No awkward tour. He met me in the lobby, slid a clipboard across a dusty little table, and pointed to a spot to sign. His eyes looked tired in a way that made me feel guilty for existing.

“Place has been empty a while,” he said, handing me the key. “People like newer buildings these days.”

It didn’t sound convincing then. It sounds even less convincing now.

The first time I walked into the apartment, it felt…unremarkable. That’s the best way I can put it. Old beige walls, scuffed floorboards, a kitchen that had seen better decades. The air had that stale, faintly sour smell of a place that had been closed up too long.

But it was quiet. 

It was mine. 

For the first time since that morning, I closed a door and no one was on the other side waiting to tell me to leave.

I slept on the floor that night, my rolled up hoodie as a pillow, my suitcase as a nightstand. I cried a little. Not in the loud, cinematic way. Just that dry, exhausted crying where your face crumples and your body shakes but nothing much comes out.

I told myself it would be okay. I had a place. A starting point. I could rebuild from here.

I really believed that.

The next morning, I found my wallet in the freezer.

I stared at it for a full minute before touching it, like it might be some kind of trap. Frost had collected around the leather. My cards were stiff inside. I had no memory of putting it there.

My brain tried to make sense of it.

You were exhausted.

You’re grieving.

You were half asleep.

You probably put it there without thinking.

It wasn’t like it levitated inside the fridge overnight. If anyone had moved it, it had to be me. There was no one else.

So I forced myself to laugh, a thin, hollow sound that bounced off the cabinets and died.

“Nice one,” I muttered to myself. “You’re really nailing this ‘new start’ thing.”

I decided to be more careful. To pay attention when I put things down. To stop drifting around in that numb haze where everything feels like it’s happening in a dream.

It didn’t matter.

The next day, the bathroom door handle felt…wrong.

It was just a little thing. The knob seemed a few inches closer to the hall than I remembered. I measured it with my hand, palm to frame, like that would prove anything. I told myself I was used to the layout of my old place, the one I’d shared with her. Muscle memory. That was all.

But once you start doubting your perception, it spreads. It’s like a crack in glass. Small at first, then branching out like a spiderweb covering everything.

On the third morning, I woke up to find my suitcase fully unpacked.

Every shirt folded and placed in drawers. Jeans hung neatly in the closet. Toiletries lined up on the bathroom sink. Even my socks were paired, which is something I rarely bothered with even on good days.

I sat on the edge of the mattress I’d dragged in and tried to remember doing it. Maybe last night? Maybe I’d finally snapped out of it and done something productive and my brain had just…erased the effort?

But I couldn’t place the feeling. No vague flash of folding, no sense of “oh, right.” Just a blank.

“Okay,” I whispered. “You’re tired. You’re sad. That’s all. People forget things all the time.”

I started leaving my phone’s voice recorder on when I went to sleep, just to prove to myself I wasn’t doing things and forgetting them. That’s how far it got, that early. Me, arguing with empty air and my own reflection like I could win.

The first time I played one of those recordings back, it was just eight hours of soft breathing, occasional shifts of the mattress, and the distant hum of pipes in the walls.

No footsteps.

No sounds of drawers opening.

No rustling of clothes.

But when I checked the apartment again, the couch had moved six inches to the left.

It was around then that I found the first note.

I only saw it because I dropped a razor behind the toilet and had to bend down and shove my hand behind the tank to fish it out. The porcelain on the back of the tank was dusty, except for a finger wiped line where someone had placed a folded scrap of lined paper.

I unfolded it with wet hands, trying not to smear the ink.

‘Stop sleeping if you want to stay you’

That’s all it said.

No name. No date. The handwriting was jagged, like it had been written in a hurry or with shaking hands.

I laughed when I read it, but it stuck in my head like a splinter. Every time my eyes drifted shut after that, I saw those words.

Still, people leave weird shit behind. It didn’t have to mean anything. Maybe some teenager wrote it to freak out a roommate. Maybe it was some kind of edgy inside joke. Apartment graffiti.

That’s what I thought, until I found the second one.

It was under the fridge. I only noticed it because something kept rattling every time I walked past, a thin bump, bump, bump, like a trapped insect. When I pulled the fridge forward, a folded note slid out and fluttered onto my sock.

The dust underneath looked undisturbed, like nothing had been moved in years.

The note itself, like the other, had one line written in the same hastily inked font. 

‘The doors move when you do’

I didn’t laugh at that one.

After that, I started looking. I tore through the kitchen cabinets, checked under drawer liners, ran my fingers along the undersides of shelves. The apartment didn’t make me work hard.

In the cabinet above the sink, on the back panel, someone had written a phrase in faint pencil. 

‘It rearranges us first’

The word “us” landed in my gut like a stone.

I stared at that sentence so long my eyes burned. The light in the kitchen buzzed and flickered above me. Outside the small window, I could hear the muffled sounds of traffic, people talking, normal city noise. Life continuing in straight lines while mine curled in on itself inside my cramped studio.

I told myself that if someone had gone through the effort of hiding notes like that, they were probably not in a good place mentally. That didn’t mean they were right. It just meant they were scared.

The problem was, I was scared too.

From then on, the changes came quicker.

I’d walk from the kitchen to the bathroom and notice that the hallway felt two steps longer. Not a lot. Just enough that my body registered the difference a split second before my brain caught up. Like a song played at the wrong speed.

The bathroom mirror seemed slightly taller one morning. The towel rack a few inches lower. The light switch on the opposite side of the frame. I stood there with my hand in the air, fingers groping for a switch that wasn’t there anymore.

“You’re thinking of the old place,” I muttered. “Her place. Stop doing that. It’s not the same layout.”

But my pulse was pounding so hard my vision trembled.

Objects moved too. Not just my wallet and toothbrush. Bigger things. The mattress shifted closer to the window. The kitchen table edged toward the door. Once, I woke up with my head at the foot of the bed and my shoes lined up neatly beside my face on the floor, toes pointing inward like they had been watching me sleep.

I stopped sleeping well. I’d jolt awake multiple times a night with the sick feeling that someone had just stepped out of the room. My dreams, when I had them, were of hallways that never ended and doors that opened into copies of the same room over and over.

I became hyperaware of the walls. Of the way sound moved through them. Of tiny, almost imperceptible creaks that seemed to answer my breathing. I’d hold my breath and swear I could hear the apartment exhale.

On Day 9, if you can call them days, when you barely sleep time feels like chewing gum, I noticed the vent cover in the main room was slightly crooked.

It hadn’t been crooked before. I was sure of that. The screws on the bottom right corner were pulled out a bit, exposing a thin slice of darkness.

My name doesn’t matter. Even if I gave it, I’m not sure anyone who used to know me would recognize it. Or remember. Or care. 

A month ago, I was living with someone I loved. I’d moved across the state for her. New city, new job, new everything. I left what little family I had and the handful of friends I trusted because I thought, stupidly, that this was my chance at a real life. A shared one.

We’d been together three years. We’d had fights, sure. But I thought that was normal. I thought we’d do the messy, difficult thing and come out the other side stronger. I thought we’d have kids one day. I thought I had time.

Turns out I didn’t.

One morning, she woke up quiet. Too quiet. She wouldn’t meet my eyes. She sat on the edge of the bed, hands twisted in the sheets, and told me she “needed space.” It was the kind of phrase that doesn’t sound real when it lands. Like something from a show you don’t watch closely.

By that evening the space she needed was the entire apartment, and I was the thing that didn’t belong in it.

It wasn’t a screaming match. She was calm, almost gentle. That somehow made it worse. She had clearly been living with this decision long before I knew it existed. To her, it was already over. To me, it ended in a single day.

I didn’t have family to run to. I’d burned too many bridges trying to keep my head above water for the last few years to have anyone I could crash with. The job I’d moved here for barely covered my half of the rent we used to split. Alone, it was impossible.

So there I was: one suitcase, a backpack, half a charge on my phone, and nowhere to go that night except out.

It’s funny how quickly your life shrinks down to immediate needs. You stop thinking about goals or dreams or five year plans. Everything becomes: 

“Where am I going to sleep?” 

“What can I eat that doesn’t cost anything?” 

“How long before she changes the locks?”

I sat in a cheap diner nursing a coffee I couldn’t afford, scrolling rental listings like I was looking through the obituaries. Everything was too expensive, too far, too “must have three times monthly income” for someone who’d just watched their life implode.

Then I found it.

“Studio apartment. $350/month. Immediate move-in. No deposit. No credit check. No questions.”

If that sets off alarm bells for you, congratulations, you’re doing better than I was.

At the time it felt like a hand reaching down into a pit and grabbing me by the collar. I didn’t think about why it was so cheap. I didn’t think about why there were no photos of the inside. I didn’t think about why the listing said “vacant long-term” in small gray letters at the bottom.

I just saw the word “immediate.”

I called. A man picked up on the second ring, like he’d been sitting there waiting.

“Yeah,” he said, after I asked if the unit was really available. “You can come by today if you want.”

There was no application. No awkward tour. He met me in the lobby, slid a clipboard across a dusty little table, and pointed to a spot to sign. His eyes looked tired in a way that made me feel guilty for existing.

“Place has been empty a while,” he said, handing me the key. “People like newer buildings these days.”

It didn’t sound convincing then. It sounds even less convincing now.

The first time I walked into the apartment, it felt…unremarkable. That’s the best way I can put it. Old beige walls, scuffed floorboards, a kitchen that had seen better decades. The air had that stale, faintly sour smell of a place that had been closed up too long.

But it was quiet. 

It was mine. 

For the first time since that morning, I closed a door and no one was on the other side waiting to tell me to leave.

I slept on the floor that night, my rolled up hoodie as a pillow, my suitcase as a nightstand. I cried a little. Not in the loud, cinematic way. Just that dry, exhausted crying where your face crumples and your body shakes but nothing much comes out.

I told myself it would be okay. I had a place. A starting point. I could rebuild from here.

I really believed that.

The next morning, I found my wallet in the freezer.

I stared at it for a full minute before touching it, like it might be some kind of trap. Frost had collected around the leather. My cards were stiff inside. I had no memory of putting it there.

My brain tried to make sense of it.

You were exhausted.

You’re grieving.

You were half asleep.

You probably put it there without thinking.

It wasn’t like it levitated inside the fridge overnight. If anyone had moved it, it had to be me. There was no one else.

So I forced myself to laugh, a thin, hollow sound that bounced off the cabinets and died.

“Nice one,” I muttered to myself. “You’re really nailing this ‘new start’ thing.”

I decided to be more careful. To pay attention when I put things down. To stop drifting around in that numb haze where everything feels like it’s happening in a dream.

It didn’t matter.

The next day, the bathroom door handle felt…wrong.

It was just a little thing. The knob seemed a few inches closer to the hall than I remembered. I measured it with my hand, palm to frame, like that would prove anything. I told myself I was used to the layout of my old place, the one I’d shared with her. Muscle memory. That was all.

But once you start doubting your perception, it spreads. It’s like a crack in glass. Small at first, then branching out like a spiderweb covering everything.

On the third morning, I woke up to find my suitcase fully unpacked.

Every shirt folded and placed in drawers. Jeans hung neatly in the closet. Toiletries lined up on the bathroom sink. Even my socks were paired, which is something I rarely bothered with even on good days.

I sat on the edge of the mattress I’d dragged in and tried to remember doing it. Maybe last night? Maybe I’d finally snapped out of it and done something productive and my brain had just…erased the effort?

But I couldn’t place the feeling. No vague flash of folding, no sense of “oh, right.” Just a blank.

“Okay,” I whispered. “You’re tired. You’re sad. That’s all. People forget things all the time.”

I started leaving my phone’s voice recorder on when I went to sleep, just to prove to myself I wasn’t doing things and forgetting them. That’s how far it got, that early. Me, arguing with empty air and my own reflection like I could win.

The first time I played one of those recordings back, it was just eight hours of soft breathing, occasional shifts of the mattress, and the distant hum of pipes in the walls.

No footsteps.

No sounds of drawers opening.

No rustling of clothes.

But when I checked the apartment again, the couch had moved six inches to the left.

It was around then that I found the first note.

I only saw it because I dropped a razor behind the toilet and had to bend down and shove my hand behind the tank to fish it out. The porcelain on the back of the tank was dusty, except for a finger wiped line where someone had placed a folded scrap of lined paper.

I unfolded it with wet hands, trying not to smear the ink.

‘Stop sleeping if you want to stay you’

That’s all it said.

No name. No date. The handwriting was jagged, like it had been written in a hurry or with shaking hands.

I laughed when I read it, but it stuck in my head like a splinter. Every time my eyes drifted shut after that, I saw those words.

Still, people leave weird shit behind. It didn’t have to mean anything. Maybe some teenager wrote it to freak out a roommate. Maybe it was some kind of edgy inside joke. Apartment graffiti.

That’s what I thought, until I found the second one.

It was under the fridge. I only noticed it because something kept rattling every time I walked past, a thin bump, bump, bump, like a trapped insect. When I pulled the fridge forward, a folded note slid out and fluttered onto my sock.

The dust underneath looked undisturbed, like nothing had been moved in years.

The note itself, like the other, had one line written in the same hastily inked font. 

‘The doors move when you do’

I didn’t laugh at that one.

After that, I started looking. I tore through the kitchen cabinets, checked under drawer liners, ran my fingers along the undersides of shelves. The apartment didn’t make me work hard.

In the cabinet above the sink, on the back panel, someone had written a phrase in faint pencil. 

‘It rearranges us first’

The word “us” landed in my gut like a stone.

I stared at that sentence so long my eyes burned. The light in the kitchen buzzed and flickered above me. Outside the small window, I could hear the muffled sounds of traffic, people talking, normal city noise. Life continuing in straight lines while mine curled in on itself inside my cramped studio.

I told myself that if someone had gone through the effort of hiding notes like that, they were probably not in a good place mentally. That didn’t mean they were right. It just meant they were scared.

The problem was, I was scared too.

From then on, the changes came quicker.

I’d walk from the kitchen to the bathroom and notice that the hallway felt two steps longer. Not a lot. Just enough that my body registered the difference a split second before my brain caught up. Like a song played at the wrong speed.

The bathroom mirror seemed slightly taller one morning. The towel rack a few inches lower. The light switch on the opposite side of the frame. I stood there with my hand in the air, fingers groping for a switch that wasn’t there anymore.

“You’re thinking of the old place,” I muttered. “Her place. Stop doing that. It’s not the same layout.”

But my pulse was pounding so hard my vision trembled.

Objects moved too. Not just my wallet and toothbrush. Bigger things. The mattress shifted closer to the window. The kitchen table edged toward the door. Once, I woke up with my head at the foot of the bed and my shoes lined up neatly beside my face on the floor, toes pointing inward like they had been watching me sleep.

I stopped sleeping well. I’d jolt awake multiple times a night with the sick feeling that someone had just stepped out of the room. My dreams, when I had them, were of hallways that never ended and doors that opened into copies of the same room over and over.

I became hyperaware of the walls. Of the way sound moved through them. Of tiny, almost imperceptible creaks that seemed to answer my breathing. I’d hold my breath and swear I could hear the apartment exhale.

On Day 9, if you can call them days, when you barely sleep time feels like chewing gum, I noticed the vent cover in the main room was slightly crooked.

It hadn’t been crooked before. I was sure of that. The screws on the bottom right corner were pulled out a bit, exposing a thin slice of darkness.

I don’t know why I dragged a chair over and stood on it. Some part of me already knew nothing good comes out of opening hidden spaces in horror stories. But this wasn’t supposed to be a horror story. It was supposed to be my life.

Behind the vent was a shoebox pressed tight into the duct. It took a stupid amount of yanking and swearing to pull it free, dust cascading down onto my face.

Inside were photos.

Some old, some newer. Different sizes, different types of paper. All of them had been taken in this apartment.

An older man sitting on the edge of the bed, staring toward the door with wide, hollow eyes.

A woman crouched in the corner of the kitchen, her hands clamped over her ears, mouth open in a sound the photograph couldn’t capture.

A kid, maybe eight years old, standing in the bathroom doorway, half of his body blurred like he’d been moving as the picture developed.

And one Polaroid with a date scribbled on the white border. ‘Six years ago.’ A man stands in the middle of the main room, shoulders slumped, looking past the camera. He looks tired in a way that made my chest hurt.

Behind him, the apartment looks…wrong.

The hallway is longer than it is now. Or maybe narrower. The perspective feels off, like one of those optical illusions where lines bend where they shouldn’t. The walls seem to tilt inward. The door to the bathroom is where my kitchen window should be.

I put the lid back on the box and shoved it away from me like it might bite.

It didn’t occur to me right away that, if those photos were here, those people weren’t.

Not until I found the tapes.

They were in the coat closet. I found them when my jacket sleeve caught on a nail and when I yanked the sleeve away to hard it pulled back a slice of drywall just enough to reveal the edge of a plastic case. Behind the loose panel was a narrow cavity full of junk, old receipts, a cracked phone, socks with no pair.

And a small camcorder, battery compartment crusted with age.

I found a charger at a pawn shop two blocks away. I almost didn’t go. A very, very rational part of me wanted to throw the camera out and move on. But curiosity does the same thing desperation does. It makes you ignore warning signs.

The battery took a charge. Against my better judgment, I hit play on the first file.

The screen lit up with the same walls I was sitting between.

The man from the Polaroid sat on the floor, back against the bathroom door, hair sticking out in sweaty clumps. His voice shook when he spoke.

“If anyone finds this,” he said, “don’t…don’t move in here. It learns you. I know that sounds crazy. I thought it was me at first. Stress. Drinking. Whatever. I thought I was just losing it.”

He laughed, a frayed sound, eyes darting around like he expected the apartment to interrupt him.

“It moves things. Just little things, at first. You’ll think you’re doing it. That’s how it gets you. It makes you doubt yourself. Then it starts changing the rooms. The doors don’t stay put. You wake up and the hallway is longer, or the bathroom’s on the wrong side. You try to leave and end up back where you started. It…”

The video glitched. Lines of static crawled down the screen.

When the image stabilized, he was closer. Sitting where I was sitting now. He looked straight into the camera.

“Once it knows you,” he whispered, “it keeps you.”

The footage cut off.

I sat there for a long time after the screen went black, listening to the soft wheeze of the camcorder and the thud of my heart. My reflection in the darkened TV looked pale and stretched.

The thing about hearing someone else describe your nightmare is that it doesn’t make it less real. It just means someone else was awake before you.

After that, everything got worse.

Sometimes I’d walk to the front door and there’d be a little extra space between it and the wall. Sometimes less. Once, I reached for the knob and my hand closed on empty air. No door. Just unbroken wall where it should’ve been. I blinked, and it was back.

The cheap ceiling light in the main room seemed higher each day. The kitchen felt narrower, forcing my shoulders inward as I moved. The bathroom mirror showed more wall behind me than there should have been.

I’d put my keys on the counter and turn around to find them on the floor. I’d swear I’d left the faucet off and hear water running anyway. I’d find food in the fridge I didn’t remember buying, half a jar of pickles, a slice of birthday cake in a plastic container, a Chinese takeout box with someone else’s handwriting on it.

The handwriting that started showing up in the margins of my own notebooks.

Sometimes it looked like mine. Sometimes like someone else’s. Sometimes like it was trying to be mine and not quite getting there.

Little notes, in the corners.

‘It remembers where you stood’ 

‘Stop trying to leave’ 

‘It’s been longer than you think’

I started having gaps in my memory. Not small, forget-where-you-put-your-keys gaps. Whole evenings gone. I’d look up and realize the light had changed, and I didn’t know what I’d done in the hours between.

Once, I came to standing in the bathroom, my hands pressed flat against the mirror. Written across the glass in soap, in my handwriting, were the words:

‘You’re apart of the layout now’

I wiped it away so fast I cut my knuckle on the edge of the frame.

I don’t know how long I’ve been here now. The days stopped lining up after a while. My phone’s clock keeps glitching, resetting to strange times. Sometimes the date jumps backward. Once it showed a year that hasn’t happened yet.

Calls don’t go through. Texts sit in “sending” limbo until I receive the ‘failed to send’ message or they vanish completely. The few people I managed to contact early on either didn’t respond or sent one word replies that didn’t sound like them.

Did I actually call them? Did I dream it? Did I imagine their voices? It’s getting harder to separate what I know from what the apartment wants me to think.

I’ve found other things, too. An envelope wedged under a floorboard, full of expired IDs from people I’ve never met. A ring at the back of a kitchen drawer. A pair of glasses on top of the cabinet so dusty they must have sat there for years.

None of it is mine. All of it is in my home.

Sometimes, late at night, when I sit very still and force myself not to cry, I swear I can feel the apartment thinking. Not with a mind, exactly. With intention.

The walls feel too close. The corners feel like they’re folding inward. The air tastes stale, dead, like it’s been exhaled too many times.

I keep catching myself doing things I don’t remember deciding to do. Rearranging the table. Moving the mattress. Closing doors I don’t remember opening. Once, I woke up with dust under my fingernails and the vent cover on the floor. The shoebox was back inside the duct, as if I had carefully put it there.

I don’t remember doing that. But the box didn’t walk back on its own.

That’s what scares me the most now. Not that the apartment is changing, but that it’s making me part of the process. Like I’m one more component it’s rearranging. One more piece of furniture it’s finding a place for.

When I listen very hard, I feel like I can hear echoes behind the plaster. Not voices, exactly. Just the sense of others. People who stood where I’m standing. People who thought they were getting a second chance with cheap rent and no questions. People who left notes and tapes and warnings that no one came in time to read.

I don’t think anyone came for them. I don’t think anyone remembered they were here once the apartment finished with them.

I can feel it finishing with me.

My thoughts are getting thinner. Sometimes I reread what I just wrote and it feels like someone else’s story. Sometimes I catch my reflection out of the corner of my eye and don’t recognize myself. For a split second, I see someone older. Or younger. Or someone who isn’t me at all.

I don’t know how this is going to end for me. I don’t know if there’ll be a body for anyone to find. I don’t know if the landlord really knows what this place does or if he just sees tenants go in and lists go back up when they “move out.”

All I know is that the apartment doesn’t like emptiness. It fills itself. With belongings. With memories. With people who think they have nowhere else to go.

If you’re reading this, and any of it sounds familiar, if you’ve ever walked into a too-cheap, too-empty place and felt it watching you back, please listen.

Don’t come looking for me.

Don’t try to find this building.

Don’t answer any listing that sounds like mine.

And if you ever see a studio advertised as “vacant long-term, immediate move in, no questions asked” for far less than it should cost…

don’t move in.

The apartment I’m in is empty again.

And it’s waiting.

Wanting.

“In the end, the tenant of 6A drifts into the fabric of the apartment, another life quietly absorbed by walls that remember far too much. Nothing in 6A ends with a scream or a struggle, only a slow, gentle, disappearance, until you realize how completely the room has claimed what’s left. The ledger closes softly on another missing tenant as the building settles around the loss of 6A.”

**Part 1: She keeps talking in her sleep**

Hi. This is my first reddit post, and I’m looking for someone that can help me. Has anyone heard of Juniper Bed and Breakfast in South Mississippi. It was my grandmother’s, and I’m looking for information about it. Mostly, I’m just worried. Strange things keep happening here, and I was hoping that one of you would be able to help. You may be wondering how I got here. I’d love to tell you that it is a whirlwind adventure and somehow, I found out that I’m a millionaire, but that is far from the truth.

I guess that I’ll just start at the beginning. I was driving home, listening to music, and trying to decompress after a long and tiring day. The back roads were empty, and the shadows were growing longer as the sunlight faded. I left the clinic in a hurry, wanting to plop down onto my couch and bask in the luxurious silence of an empty apartment. However, that monotonous drive was interrupted when I received a call from Taylor General Hospital. I figured it was another call to schedule one of my grandmother’s appointments. They could never get her to answer her own phone, so it didn’t surprise me.

“Is this Ms. Clifton’s granddaughter, Carrie? You were her emergency contact on file,” said the employee.

It was not the regular chipper girl who called about scheduling. This wasn’t concerning an appointment at all, and I felt a nervous tinge in the back of my head.

“I am,” I replied, feeling a lump forming in my throat.

“My name is Trina. I’m a nurse at Taylor General Hospital. Your grandmother collapsed after leaving her check-up appointment today.”

That conversation changed everything. I drove three hours to Taylor General Hospital in rural Mississippi to discover that my grandmother had suffered a debilitating stroke, and she would need around the clock care. Life can change quickly, and I certainly was unprepared. But I don't think anyone is.

You may be wondering why I was her only emergency contact, but the answer is simple. She raised me, and she is my paternal grandmother. That’s all there is to it. We’ve always had each other since my parents didn’t hang around long enough to see me grow up. My mother found drugs, and my dad… well I know he’s dead. How he died is still a mystery, and no one has seen my mom in twelve years. I suspect that she is dead as well. Through it all, I’ve always had my grandmother. She has always been the one constant in my life, and now, I’m losing her as well. But people don’t live forever, even if we wish they could.

I am now her caregiver. I moved back to my hometown, Juniper, and I’m not so sure that I’m going to stay after she passes. I thought about hiring someone to live with her, but I decided that I could manage on my own. I’m a nurse by trade, so I’m able to do most of the dirty work by myself. I change her, feed her, and bathe her. She’s on hospice now, and the hospice nurse comes by almost everyday to check on us. She’s a sweet woman with perfectly straightened hair and big brown eyes. She always asks me if I’m doing okay, and I always give her the generic “I’m doing fine.” The truth is… watching someone die is draining, and it isn’t like you imagine it. It is quiet, empty, and it has a certain kind of smell. It is a sharp scent, and it doesn’t leave your nose no matter where you go.

My grandmother can’t talk anymore. She mumbles something here and there while she sleeps, and when she wakes up, she stares at the wall. She’s only a feeble shell of who she used to be. The light in her eyes is somewhere else, dulled by her medicine and poisoned by her stroke.

Since I’ve moved back into my childhood home, all I do is clean. I turn on the tv for my grandmother if she is awake, and I get right to it. The house was a wreck when I came back two days before she was supposed to leave the hospital. Apparently, things were not as good as she led me to believe. I had only been away for a year since I finished nursing school and bought my own apartment. Of course, she couldn’t tell me anything now, but from what I can gather… she’d developed some interesting new habits. She’d started hoarding boxes, old cartons, wicker baskets, ill-fitting clothes, and silk flowers. There were bags upon bags of silk flowers, stacked to the ceiling like skyscrapers. I didn’t know that one could purchase so many silk flowers, and I thought I might die after a mountain of them fell on me. I was able to clear a pathway through to the main dining room where her hospice bed was set up, and I’ve been going through room after room and just throwing away and pillaging through her hoard. I bag it up, take it outside, and burn it. None of it is sentimental, and it is all garbage to me. She wasn’t living alone either. She’d picked up some little woodland friends… mice… rats… and from the skeletons I found in one of the bedrooms, I’d a say a family of squirrels was massacred by an avalanche of wicker baskets and boxes.

I just don’t understand. Why did she hide her ailing mental state from me? How could she live like this? She used to be a clean freak. She’d wash a porcelain sink four times until it shined. I should have come back sooner. I’d planned to come this Christmas since I wasn’t scheduled to work. I feel like a failure.

Her house used to be a beautiful bed and breakfast that everyone used to love to stay at. There are six guest bedrooms, and a master suite that always served as our main living space. It takes up the entire top floor of the house. It has its own kitchen, bathroom, and bedroom area. When I was little, I used to sleep with her on the master bed with my favorite stuffed animal. Now, the entire master suite serves as a graveyard for her mounds of trash, decaying woodland friends, and junk. I considered hiring someone to go through this absolute trash heap, but instead, I use it as my therapy. Throwing away the trash, burning it, and taking care of my grandmother gets me through the day. I’m exhausted, but it is better than feeling the horrible ache of grief swelling through my body like a balloon. I’d rather collapse on the couch and pass out than feel a single tinge of bitter sadness creeping up on me. It is easier to push it all away than actually cope. I’m sure that you probably understand… or maybe you don’t, and I’m assuming too much.

The night before my grandmother died she started talking in her sleep very loudly. It was so loud that she woke me up as I laid on the couch beside her bed. Usually she slept soundly, but the last few nights she kept trying to get up. She’d groan and try to lift her body, but that is sometimes a side effect of the morphine, a jarring restlessness. And tonight, it was disturbing pieces and parts of words as she attempted to rise again.

“Gram,” I said, slowly getting up and rubbing my eyes. “Do you need something?”

Her mouth was moving up and down, but no words were coming out. It was just hushed whispers of vowels and consonants. You could hear her tongue and teeth clacking together as she tried to produce audible sounds again. The left side of her face still had a visible droop, and a nasally whistle came through her nose as her poor failing body struggled to speak to me.

I took a deep breath, rubbing through her hair. “Gram, do you want some water?”

She nodded, and I grabbed her cup and her straw. I placed the straw into her mouth, and she swallowed quickly. She smacked her lips together and went back to sleep. I called my friend, Anna, who is a hospice nurse, and she answered, knowing that it was important if I was calling her so late.

“Carrie,” she said quietly. “John is sleeping, so let me leave our bedroom. Are you okay?”

“She keeps talking in her sleep. Is that normal?”

Anna sighed. “Yeah. It is normal with the sleep aids that she is taking. But I asked if you were okay. Are you?”

I sat back down on the couch. “You know that I’m not, but who would be in this situation?”

“Carrie… It is hard. You can call me to talk any time. Do you need help? I can make the drive to you.”

“No,” I replied quickly. “Anna it is such a mess here. I’ve been able to clean out most of the lower level of the house, but the master suite is a nightmare. Besides, I wouldn’t be okay letting you sleep on the other old couch.”

Anna chuckled. “You let me know if you change your mind, okay?”

“I will. Now go on back to bed. You’ve got work tomorrow. Sorry that I woke you up.”

“It’s fine. Goodnight,” she said in a whisper.

“Goodnight.”

I ended the call and sat back into the couch. The room was dark, but moonlight poured in from the windows. I was able to see, so I wasn’t concerned. I titled my head back, and I looked up at the ceiling, watching the shadows of tree branches thumping together as the wind blew outside. A stray branch scraped against the side of the house, and I jumped. I sighed and made a mental note to cut the damn crepe myrtles outside. They had grown wild, sprouting more branches than I had ever seen. They didn’t resemble the perfect pink puff balls along the house that I once remembered. The entire house was no longer the blissful country home that I once remembered. Like my grandmother… it was now only an empty shell of what would have been a once loving home for everyone who needed a warm bed.

I heard a sharp intake of breath, and I turned my gaze back to my grandmother. She began to mumble again. I inched closer to her, smelling the rancid odor of her breath. I knew that smell. It was the smell that only dying people emit. I knew that her time was coming. I leaned my ear closer to her mouth, and I was able to make out three words.

“Feed… the… house.”

“What?” I asked nervously. I held tightly onto the metal rung of her hospice bed. “What do you mean?” My words came out shakily, and I leaned even closer to her.

“The house… needs to be… fed.”

She suddenly grabbed my hand, and her other arm flailed as she tried to grab my hair. Her fingers grazed my cheek, and I tried to pry her hand off of mine. Her fingernails dug into my skin, and her knuckles burned white in the darkness of the room. Her eyes were wide, staring upwards at the ceiling… seeing something that I simply couldn’t. I couldn’t move. I was horrified. I had seen patients die, but none of them looked like this. She looked… scared. Her lips quivered, shaking the little amount of flesh that covered her facial bones. I couldn’t quite decide what she saw, but I was sure that I never wanted to see it either. I was able to rip my hand from her grasp, and I looked down to see purple whelps forming on my skin. She had grabbed me with inhumane strength, and I didn’t understand. Maybe I wouldn’t ever.

One thing was for certain. She wanted her house fed, and I wasn’t sure what that meant.

She died the next day in the early hours. I knew it was coming, and I hated that she left me with such a horrific memory. The funeral was three days later on a Friday. I still had bruises and little red crescent moons from her fingernails on my hand. Everyone in my hometown came. It was the busiest funeral that I had ever witnessed. The mayor came with his wife, and they made what felt like an extreme effort to learn my future plans for my grandmother’s house. The sheriff and his wife came. Old classmates and their parents. It was insane in my opinion. She didn’t know half of these people, and I surely didn’t know them either.

One of my grandmother’s frequent guests at the bed and breakfast came up to me and gave his condolences. He was an older man with greying hair and a thin grey mustache. “You plannin’ to stay here and clean up the place? I think the bed and breakfast deserves a second chance. It has been run by the Clifton family since this town was founded.”

My mouth went dry. “I haven’t really thought that much into it. I’m a nurse, so I figure that I’ll have to sell it.”

His face turned a hot shade of red. “You can’t do that! You don’t know what you are doing. What would your grandmother say?” Spittle shot from his mouth as he continued to fuss. “You simply can’t sell it.”

I stared at him, trying to decide why it bothered him so much. People turned to look at him, hearing his loud voice over the conversations around them. I decided to give him an answer to placate him since I didn’t want him yelling at me during the visitation.

“Mr. Havers… I haven’t made any decisions yet,” I replied lowly. “I’d appreciate it if you’d lower your voice as well. People are staring.”

He looked around, and he smiled. He straightened his suit. “Good… You need to think of Juniper. You are now one of the founding members since your grandmother has passed. It is your responsibility to keep this town thriving. I’m sure that you’ll make the right choice.”

He left quickly, nearly knocking someone over as he hurried away. Everyone stared at him as he left, but they did not seem as shocked as I was. He had always been nice to my grandmother.

I felt my cheeks burn and tears welling up. I forced them down, and I looked around, hoping to spot someone I knew. I needed someone to take my mind off of Mr. Havers. One of the police officers who had come walked to check on me. He looked familiar, but I couldn’t remember how I knew him.

“Are you okay, Carrie?” he asked. He was a younger man with reddish hair and hazel eyes.

“I’m fine. Everyone is acting so crazy today. I just don’t understand,” I whispered.

He shrugged. “Funerals make everyone crazy. My name is Phillip. You might remember me from school. I moved away, but I got a job here when I finished police academy.”

I nodded, remembering the geeky kid who moved away when we were freshman. “Phillip Masterson,” I said, frowning. “Layton Meyers used to pick on you really bad. I remember you. I’m sorry I didn’t intervene to help you.”

“No worries… No one wanted to stand up to him.” Phillip smiled. “Now Layton Meyers is a drunkard and lost his drivers license, so I think I’m safe for now.” He chuckled.

He sat down beside me, drinking a cup of lemonade from the refreshment table. “When did you get back?” he asked.

“About three weeks ago.”

“I started working here about a month ago, so what have you been doing?” he asked, trying to be friendly.

 “I’ve been cleaning out my grandmother’s house and taking care of her. She let it fall into ruin, and truthfully, the whole thing needs to bulldozed.”

I looked out at the crowd of people. They were socializing like this was a family event. “I don’t understand how all of these people are here for the funeral, but no one went over there to check on her. Surely, she had friends who cared enough to drop by. Assholes...” I stopped myself. “I’m sorry. That was mean to say.”

He took a deep breath. “Mean or not… it is the truth. So many people used to go to your grandmother’s bed and breakfast, and the town grew because her incredible gardens brought tourists. I think it’s a shame that none of them bothered to check in on her while you were gone.”

I looked up at him, grateful to have someone who seemed to understand. He stood up, preparing to leave, but I stopped him.

“Phillip, what do you know about the bed and breakfast? My grandmother told me some strange stuff when she was lucid.”

He looked taken aback. “I don't know much,"" he whispered. ""I can grab some records from city hall and bring them by tomorrow. I can also help you clean. I’m off tomorrow if you’d like some help and some company.”

I nodded. “I’d like that very much.”

He smiled. “I’ll bring coffee.” He walked off and headed out the door of the funeral home.

After the funeral ended and she was lowered into her grave, I drove back to my grandmother’s house all alone. I stared out the window, thumbing over the steering wheel. I suddenly noticed how much larger Juniper had grown since I left. Yet the people who had always lived here still remained. I was the only one that seemed to escape. Everywhere around us is farmland and large expanses of thick woods, so Juniper is the only place that many come to for other necessities or entertainment. They finally built a movie theatre, and the old mall closed down. But they were expanding. I could see the shell of new homes and new buildings sprouting up everywhere, and it made me wonder why they were so keen on preserving the now rotting bed and breakfast. I couldn’t help but think about Mr. Havers.

He must know something.

I’m sure of it, and maybe we find out together.

I'm a 19-year-old girl and a very typical introvert. Crowds, loud places, parties, and even too much small talk make me feel drained and anxious within minutes. I need a lot of time alone to feel normal again, and I prefer deep one-on-one conversations over group hangouts or constant chatting. I've always been this way, and I've tried to be okay with it, but right now the loneliness is hitting me really hard. I miss having someone I can actually connect with who doesn't expect me to be ""on"" all the time.

I spend most of my days reading fantasy books that take me somewhere else completely, watching calm movies or series that focus on feelings and atmosphere instead of action, listening to lo-fi or ambient music while I sit with tea and let my thoughts wander. I like quiet walks in the evening when no one is around, making coffee exactly how I want it, journaling whatever random things come into my head, and just existing without any pressure. I don't go to clubs, big events, or crowded places. They make me want to disappear.

What I really want is another introvert who gets it. Someone who doesn't mind long silences, who likes talking about books, random thoughts, dreams, or how the day actually felt instead of just surface stuff. Someone who is okay with texting slowly, who understands when I need space, and who wants the same kind of gentle, low-pressure connection I do. I don't want to be pulled into a more social life. I want someone who lives in the same quiet headspace.

If you're a guy around 18-24 who also feels lonely, who recharges alone, who gets tired by too much noise or people, who prefers meaningful conversations over endless small talk, please message me. I promise I'm kind, I reply quickly to real messages, and I actually want to talk regularly if we click. Tell me anything – what you're reading/watching/listening to lately, what your perfect quiet day looks like, why you're feeling lonely, or just say hi. It would mean a lot right now.

I'm hoping someone out there feels the same way and decides to reach out. Don't overthink it, just message me. Thank you for reading.",1,1768523776.0,IntrovertDating,1,0.67,False

1qe11o1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/1qe11o1/area_of_effect_sample_reviews/,Area of Effect Sample Reviews :),"Hello all! I discovered Area of Effect Perfumery through other reviews on this sub, and as a huge nerd I had to get a sample pack. I pretty much universally prefer EDP sprays over oil, but I was lured by the Magic the Gathering themed scents and decided to make an exception. I got a sample pack of Black Lotus, Crimson Vow, New Horizons, KK Slider, and Continue?, with Crimson Vow being a recommendation someone gave me in this sub when I asked about vampire scents (spoiler alert: it delivered). 

On to the reviews!

**Black Lotus** (amaretto, jasmine, raspberry, ink accord, tuberose, black currant, myrrh, opium, red wine accord, benzoin, chai spice)

It started off very amaretto with a little bit of general spice and a hint of a floral, but leather quickly overtook the whole affair. The leather scent was not like the aromatic scent of leather but direct and base leather like you were eating leather. It's very grounded, like a worn leather instead of new leather. The working man's leather scent, if you will. It doesn't have an oil smell, but it reminds me of a car race refuel team for some reason. (If you are a mtg fan, it smells like aetherdrift to me). It's likeable and unlikeable at the same time, like I want to keep sniffing it just to make sure I actually don't like it and I'm continuously unsure. For anyone who doesn't play magic the gathering, Black Lotus is one of THE most expensive cards and probably the most famous. It's very iconic, and there are a lot of cards that either reference it or are a less powerful form of it. Obviously Black Lotus is not real but in terms of realism this rocks. It smells exactly like I imagine a Black Lotus artifact would smell like, even if I wouldn't wear it. (**6**/**10**)

  
**Crimson Vow** (red wine accord, blood accord, dark chocolate, red rose, champagne, sea salt, black leather)

This has a similar leather note to Black Lotus, the more earthy, subtle note, but I think it uses it better. For some reason I get a tiniest tint of apple fruit leather. It does hit wine accord pretty nicely, and there is something darker and deeper to it that may be the blood? It's a very sexy scent but not sexy on purpose, sexy on accident. You're just so naturally sexy, you don't know you're beautiful!!! as one direction so aptly put it. The sea salt and dark chocolate are pretty subtle, more of an enhancer than a distinct tone. This is another magic the gathering inspired scent, and the context is this was a magic set that was based in a world of vampires. This is, like Black Lotus, truly Crimson Vow. This is just what Olivia the Vampire Queen smells like. I thought I didn't like it but actually I really do. (**8.5**/**10**)

  
**New Horizons** (coconut, sand, plumeria, driftwood, gardenia, tanning lotion, cedarwood, creamy musk)

MY ABSOLUTE BELOVED!!!! This is like the most aesthetic idea of a beach trip accord you could get. It's creamy coconut suntan lotion with a hint of plumeria (my favorite scent of all time). I was worried about the cedarwood because I've learned wood scents make me nauseous but I didn't get that at all so hooray for false advertising!! It's so sunscreen in a way that is obviously like, unnatural? Like this smell is absolutely manufactured in a lab and kind of has an ephemeral quality that way. It's a little like a suntan pina colada, but without the alcohol. It smells like a Hawaii mall, with a bit of the sweet recycled air. My favorite, I need it, and I WISH it came in a spray but I'll make an exception for this very well behaved gentleman (gender neutral) of a scent. (**10**/**10**)

  
**KK Slider** (coconut cream, rum, pineapple, chai spice, nutmeg\*, graham cracker)

Weird and bad. It smells like overly buttered popcorn blended into a rum smoothie and I do not like it at all. It's like if a perfume were a mexican standoff. It doesn't mesh well together and it's gross on top of that. Sorry I am unfortunately a hater. (**1**/**10**)

  
**Continue?** (espresso, pumpkin, spice, cream)

It smells like a cinnamon broom dunked in coffee with a Lacroix level of ""the word pumpkin shouted right next to you."" It's very cozy and winter-y but it's not a perfume I would really want, because I could just get a cinnamon broom. I don't need it. (**6**/**10**)

Pretty good! I'll probably full size Crimson Vow and New Horizons, and I'll also probably get another sample pack just to see how the artist envisions other scents because Crimson Vow and Black Lotus were so spot on aesthetically. ",9,1768523532.0,Indiemakeupandmore,2,1.0,False

Hope y’all are doing well. 

Kind of in a funk, but trying to tough it out with the last hour of work. Might just get some coffee and a cookie somewhere. 

I’m 35 years old, a nerdy Latina and a lazy goth. I’m not looking to date or anything. Just looking for friendship. Getting older and I’m realizing that I only have my partner as my best buddy and idk. I know growing up means that things change, but it’s always been like that for me. 

I’m autistic and possibly have adhd (still working on getting that sorted out). So making friends has been hard for a long time. 

Anyways. 

I love anime and video games. I have a ps5 but I’m more of a single person gamer. I love games like mass effect, Skyrim, fallout (replaying fo4 at the moment). On PC I’m playing FFXIV, and I’m having a blast. I’m on Aether/Jenova if that matters for anyone. 

Outside of all that I work in an art field. Mostly with interior design stuff. 

Hobbies are writing, digital drawing and pencil/ink sketches, naps, oddities and curiosities, going to coffee shops, bonticsk gardens, museums, national parks, photography, gaming, reading classical literature, writing roleplays, enjoying monster romance and size difference stuff. 

Honestly it’s dorky, but when I was younger I used to have a crush on Cloud Strife from FFVII. And Fran from FFXII. 

I’m not a big fan of VC. 

I do like showing off silly memes and stuff though. ",0,1768523409.0,r4r,1,0.5,False

I’m looking for genuine advice and perspective because I feel emotionally stuck and confused.

I met my ex online in December 2023. We went on a few coffee dates, and in April 2024, I asked her to go with me to Vrindavan. I proposed there, and it felt very meaningful and sincere. Shortly after, we entered a long-distance relationship.

Things were stable for a few months. I tried to be supportive in the ways I could—checking in regularly, sending food when she was unwell, and doing small gestures to make her feel cared for. Around October, I started noticing changes: slower replies, mood shifts, and emotional distance.

In November 2024, I visited her city unexpectedly (I was also there for personal reasons). The situation was tense at first, but we eventually met, spent time together, and things felt temporarily normal. However, during that visit, I discovered that she had developed a close emotional connection with someone else while we were still together. This deeply hurt me.

We talked extensively afterward. She apologized, said she didn’t fully understand how things escalated, and I chose to give the relationship another chance. We spent New Year’s together, and it genuinely felt happy and hopeful.

In early 2025, circumstances changed again. Work and family pressures increased, and eventually she told me that her family had started discussing marriage arrangements. Due to my own family responsibilities, I wasn’t in a position to commit to marriage at that time. After a lot of emotional conversations, we decided to stop communicating.

Since then, we’ve met briefly a few times, mostly for closure. During our final meeting, I gave her a thoughtful goodbye gift, and we both acknowledged that the relationship had ended.

It has now been more than six months, and I’m still struggling to move on emotionally. I don’t contact her anymore, but I still think about her often. I’ve even found myself revisiting places we used to go, which I know isn’t healthy.

I am currently seeing someone else casually—she treats me very well and genuinely cares—but emotionally, I still feel attached to my past relationship. I don’t want to go back, and I know it wouldn’t be right, but the feelings haven’t fully gone away.

My questions:

	•	Why do I still feel emotionally attached even after everything that happened?

	•	Is this unresolved attachment, or am I just afraid of letting go?

	•	How do I properly move on without carrying this into future relationships?

	•	Should I step back from dating until I’m emotionally stable?

I’d really appreciate honest, respectful advice from people who’ve been through something similar.

1qe0z8p,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DNLR4NGQ,"FREE KINDLE BOOK – 3 DAYS ONLY (January 15-17, 2026) Poetry: ...And Bits And Bits.","For three days only, …And Bits And Bits is free—an unfiltered drift through non-existence, labour, consciousness, and the joke that keeps telling itself. As one reader observed, “The reader is not guided toward closure but gently bludgeoned into acceptance.” Or, as the collection itself puts it: “Nothing is happening; everywhere, all the time.”

A Review of …And Bits And Bits by David Mark Kirkwood

Reading …And Bits And Bits feels less like reading a poetry collection and more like riding a powered pallet jack through ontology, labour politics, fart jokes, Zen koans, warehouse bathrooms, Christmas carols, and the void—often simultaneously. It is Whitman if Whitman clocked in, Beckett if Beckett worked safety meetings, Bukowski if Bukowski discovered non-duality and still had to punch out by 3:30.

This is not a book that “develops themes.” It obsesses, loops, chews, re-chews, then spits themes back out only to ask whether anything was ever there to begin with. As one line puts it with ruthless efficiency:

“That which forms— / Is no thing.”

Kirkwood’s central fixation—call it non-existence, naught, the void, the joke the universe keeps telling itself—appears everywhere, from cosmic proclamations to the most ignoble bodily functions. One moment you’re handed a metaphysical hand grenade—

“Thought is an emergent property / Of non-existence.”

—and the next you’re staring at the unignorable poetry of embodiment:

“I didn’t poo, / But I’m gonna wipe—”

This oscillation is the book’s engine. High metaphysics meets low matter. Nagarjuna meets the lunchroom. Laozi meets labour scheduling. The result is not contradiction but texture.

Warehouse Zen and Blue-Collar Gnosticism

What makes …And Bits And Bits distinct isn’t just its philosophical reach—it’s its setting. This is one of the rare contemporary poetry collections where forklifts, pallet stacks, operator platforms, safety advisors, and management meetings aren’t metaphors; they’re the terrain of enlightenment.

“The world; my operator’s platform— / I’m walking the T-JACK!”

Kirkwood turns wage labour into a monastery without romanticizing it. Capitalism is not critiqued from a café; it’s anatomized from inside the machine:

“Capitalism exploits— / Where there are none / To be exploited, / Capitalism collapses.”

This is Marx filtered through absurdism, filtered again through someone who has actually attended the meetings. If David Graeber had written haiku during shift work, it might have looked like this.

The Sacred, the Profane, and the Hilarious

The book’s irreverence is not decorative—it’s methodological. Religion, nationalism, productivity culture, media narratives, and identity signaling all get skewered with the same blunt tool:

“Give us your money, / Give us your eternal soul— / We shall give you— / Naught.”

Elsewhere, Kirkwood dismantles solemnity by refusing to let it stand uninterrupted. A hymn becomes a fart joke; a Christmas carol becomes a logistical nightmare; reverence collapses under its own weight:

“Peace is meaningless… / Without WAR!”

This is not cynicism. It’s anti-pretension. The book insists—over and over—that meaning collapses the moment it takes itself too seriously.

Form as Philosophy

The sheer volume—hundreds of short poems, fragments, haiku, riffs, chants, complaints—is the point. The repetition enacts the thesis. Non-existence doesn’t resolve; it recurs. The reader is not guided toward closure but gently bludgeoned into acceptance.

“Nothing is happening; everywhere, all the time.”

If this were music, it would be drone. If it were film, it would be a warehouse surveillance feed that suddenly becomes Tarkovsky. If it were tech, it would be an open-source operating system running on jokes, rage, wonder, and coffee breaks.

Why It Works

Despite (or because of) its sprawl, …And Bits And Bits never pretends to be important. That’s its strength. It understands that pretending not to matter is often the most honest position available:

“Everything is perfect. / One need not understand / The workings…”

Kirkwood doesn’t ask to be agreed with. He asks to be witnessed, preferably while you’re half-tired, slightly irritated, and wondering why the bathroom smells like piss.

This book will not change your life.

It might, however, sit next to it, muttering inconvenient truths while you’re trying to get through the day.

And that’s rarer.

If …And Bits And Bits teaches anything, it’s this: nothing lasts, nothing resolves, and everything counts anyway.

1qe0yxx,https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/1qe0yxx/m24_needs_advice/,M24 needs advice,"Hi everyone,

I’m looking for genuine advice and perspective because I feel emotionally stuck and confused.

I met my ex online in December 2023. We went on a few coffee dates, and in April 2024, I asked her to go with me to Vrindavan. I proposed there, and it felt very meaningful and sincere. Shortly after, we entered a long-distance relationship.

Things were stable for a few months. I tried to be supportive in the ways I could—checking in regularly, sending food when she was unwell, and doing small gestures to make her feel cared for. Around October, I started noticing changes: slower replies, mood shifts, and emotional distance.

In November 2024, I visited her city unexpectedly (I was also there for personal reasons). The situation was tense at first, but we eventually met, spent time together, and things felt temporarily normal. However, during that visit, I discovered that she had developed a close emotional connection with someone else while we were still together. This deeply hurt me.

We talked extensively afterward. She apologized, said she didn’t fully understand how things escalated, and I chose to give the relationship another chance. We spent New Year’s together, and it genuinely felt happy and hopeful.

In early 2025, circumstances changed again. Work and family pressures increased, and eventually she told me that her family had started discussing marriage arrangements. Due to my own family responsibilities, I wasn’t in a position to commit to marriage at that time. After a lot of emotional conversations, we decided to stop communicating.

Since then, we’ve met briefly a few times, mostly for closure. During our final meeting, I gave her a thoughtful goodbye gift, and we both acknowledged that the relationship had ended.

It has now been more than six months, and I’m still struggling to move on emotionally. I don’t contact her anymore, but I still think about her often. I’ve even found myself revisiting places we used to go, which I know isn’t healthy.

I am currently seeing someone else casually—she treats me very well and genuinely cares—but emotionally, I still feel attached to my past relationship. I don’t want to go back, and I know it wouldn’t be right, but the feelings haven’t fully gone away.

My questions:

	•	Why do I still feel emotionally attached even after everything that happened?

Is this unresolved attachment, or am I just afraid of letting go?

	•	How do I properly move on without carrying this into future relationships?

	•	Should I step back from dating until I’m emotionally stable?

I’d really appreciate honest, respectful advice from people who’ve been through something similar.

I'm all in on business. I believe in selling products and services, and I hate the 9-to-5 grind etc... I want to disclose that upfront so people don't treat this post as being a3da2 najah.

I've been following this guy on Instagram—not that old, actually—who started by selling socks in coffee shops and posting videos. I began following him from day one because he consistently gave suggestions to young Moroccans on how to make a little money every day, just enough to put food on the table, while promising them they'd grow soon enough. That message resonated for the first couple of weeks.

Then, out of nowhere, he bought a motorcycle. To his credit, he did disclose that someone got it for him. But shortly after, he started treating it like he'd earned it through hard work. I know it was an Instagram reward or donation, but he began showing it off in videos like he'd made it all himself.

Then came the garage. He started selling underwear products out of a new shop, and I'm genuinely curious: how does a guy selling socks—who couldn't even afford his own bike—suddenly rent a garage that probably costs 10k MAD a month?

Don't get me wrong, lah ysahel elih w ykmel blkheir. This isn't about me. But I'm worried about the other guys in their late teens and twenties watching this. They see someone promising small daily earnings one day, then running a full business shortly after while claiming he did it all himself. These young people start their journey expecting nothing but a blurry, distant path until they can afford a shop. They burn out before they even begin, just from seeing how impossibly fast his ""success"" appears to be.

And to be clear, he didn't get life-changing money. But when you're speaking to the lower end of society, people genuinely believe in content like this. Why does all motivational content follow this same script? They show you revenue, then boom—donations roll in, and suddenly they're claiming it all came from that small business that barely makes anything.

Again, lah ysahel elih wela ga3 nas matbe3toch eliha.

Swerve makes his way to the ring and grabs a mic. 

“Milwaukee, how are we feeling tonight?” 

The crowd cheers 

“Yeah I’m feeling that way too. This Saturday, I will compete in a four way elimination match for the Undisputed Championship. I don't know what the other competitors are thinking but I know that I’m not leaving empty handed. See I’m a very confident man, but my confidence went through the roof when I heard that all three of my opponents will be competing in a match tonight. So I’m gonna sit in the back and get real close to the monitor and watch those three beat the hell out of each other while I sit back and smile. And then I’m going to rest and prepare myself for whatever I’m going to have to do this Saturday- 

\*CM Punks music plays\* 

The crowd loses it as Swerve turns his head and looks up the ramp with a sour look. 

CM Punk comes out and makes his way to the ring. 

“Swerve, I’m sorry to interrupt but I heard this crowd in the back and I selfishly had to come out here and feel this energy. Milwaukee! Let me hear you!” 

The rowdy crowd cheers and starts to chant “CM Punk, CM Punk, CM Punk!”

“I’m close to home and boy does it feel good, but I know it’s going to be even better when I win the Undisputed Championship on Saturday in Chicago. And speaking of this Saturday, Swerve, you mentioned earlier that you didn’t know what we were thinking, so I thought I’d come down and tell you first hand. See all I’ve been able to think about for the past few weeks is winning the championship. And it’s not just the fact that it’s a home game for me and that it would be sweet to win the big one at home again. Although, that’s plenty of motivation for me. The real reason I want to win this title is because this title and this show needs me to win the title. 

The crowd says “ooouuu”

“Now if I can be open and honest for a minute about everyone else,” says Punk. “AJ Styles is an incredible wrestler and genuinely one of the greatest of all time. I mean anyone else calls themselves phenomenal and I’d roll my eyes, but he’s earned that name. But I don’t know how much thread is left on those tires and I wouldn’t want him to lose it to some young hotshot just because he can’t keep up.” 

The crowd erupts in “Oouuus and Ahhhs” again. 

“Then there’s that loud mouth, MJF, and I know it’s the pot calling the kettle black but see it’s different with him. He calls himself the best in the world just like I did but here’s the difference. I spent years putting in work, tearing myself down, and building myself up again just so I can build that belief in myself. I traveled around the world and faced any and everybody. I knew I was the best in the world because of what I endured and how it didn’t stop me from moving forward. But MJF calls himself the best in the world because that’s what other people told him when he was growing up. See I can tell and feel real confidence when I’m standing across from somebody and boy oh boy did you reek of uncertainty and the last thing this title and show deserves is the number one guy to be pissing himself while he “leads”. Sure he acted all mad and frustrated when he found out this would be a four way match, but I’m sure he was smiling on the inside because when he doesn’t get the job done, he’ll have an out. But Maxwell, (Punk stares into the camera) when I win this title and you stumble your way into a shot, I’m going to show you first hand that the truth always prevails and that truth is that I’M THE BEST IN THE WORLD…and you know it.” 

The crowd goes crazy again and starts to chant for Punk. 

“Which brings me to you, Swerve. I know this may be our first time having a conversation one on one, but I know a lot about you. I’ve watched a lot of you. I know about all the hard work you did to get here. When I stand across from you I feel the confidence oozing out of you, I feel that you think you’re ready. But after watching tape and seeing how you’ve acted the past few weeks, you’re not ready yet.”

The crowd says “ooouuu”. Swerve nods his head as he puckers his lips. 

“It’s ok, y’all. I can see how some can take that as disrespect, but it’s important to listen to someone like Punk no matter how it may make you feel. If you’re being honest, Punk, then I will too. You have been such an inspiration to me throughout my career. You’ve taught me to believe in myself, to stand up for myself no matter who stands across from me, and to be a man for the people when the message is right. And you’re right about me being confident and believing in myself, but you were also right about something else you said…you called yourself selfish.” 

The crowd screams “oouuu” 

“I mean just listen to you, Punk. You think that this title needs you? What we need is for you and other vets to step aside while we take care of business and run this ship. What we need is for y’all to stop taking opportunities from those that deserve it. I hate MJF just as much as you do, but I’d rather a young guy like him hold the strap than seeing people like you holding onto your glory days with an iron-like grip thinking you know better. When the only thing that should be known is that this is my house now and I’ll be damned if I let you in thinking you can still put your feet up” 

The crowd has mixed reactions as Punk mocks Swerve and nods his head while puckering his lips. 

“Well like I said earlier the truth prevails and the truth is that daddy’s home and the only place my feet are going are straight up your ass this Saturday.”

Punk drops the mic and bumps into Swerve as he walks past him. Swerve grabs Punk and turns him back around. The two stand nose to nose as the crowd cheers. 

**(Backstage at the curtain)** Renee stands with Andrade. 

“Andrade, you’re about to have your match with Dolph Ziggler but I can help notice that you’re going out there alone. Have you heard from Zelina?” 

“Renee, you don’t need to worry about all that. I know Zelina very well and I know that she would never want to disappoint me. I know that she will come out and have my back, just like I’ve had hers. Once we are united, I can finally turn my attention to winning gold and being the best person on this roster. Now if you’ll excuse me, I am going to start that mission right now.” 

Andrade walks through the curtain as his theme song plays. 

**Match 1:** Andrade vs Dolph Ziggler 

The two have a back and forth classic. Andrade is finally able to get the advantage as he is setting up his finisher while Ziggler struggles to his feet. As he yells at Ziggler to get up, Zelina walks out on stage and down the ramp. Andrade has a smile on her face as she approaches the ring. The ref is distracted checking on Ziggler as Zelina jumps onto the apron. Andrade opens his arms and Zelina does the same while smiling. Andrade walks towards her and as he closes in, Zelina slaps him across the face. Andrade grabs his face and Ziggler springs up from the mat and hits Andrade with the Zig Zag. 1,2,3 Ziggler wins. 

**Dolph Ziggler (W)**

Ziggler celebrates as he goes up the ramp. The music stops and Zelina enters the ring, laughing at Andrade. Andrade starts to come to and looks up at Zelina laughing. He starts to get pissed as he slams the mat and stands up. He yells at Zelina, “Perra estúpida, ¿por qué harías eso?, ¿por que?” Andrade approaches her and Zelina stops laughing. She dawns a scared expression as she slowly backs up. Andrade continues to walk towards her until her back is against the turnbuckles. She starts to cower in the corner as he continues to bark at her. Zelina covers her face and it looks like she is crying, but Andrade doesn’t let up. Zelina slowly starts to stand up straight, she moves her hands from her face and she’s laughing. 

The lights go out 

When the lights come back on, Aleister Black is standing behind Andrade. The crowd loses their minds as Zelina is laughing like a maniac. Andrade, while still looking at Zelina, is confused. He turns and gets hit with a Black Mass. Black sits cross legged over him, Zelina stands behind him and puts her hand on his shoulder. Zelina starts to laugh and the lights go out. 

**(Backstage Segment)** Carmelo Hayes walks into GM Mickie James' office. 

“Thanks for coming to meet with me, Carmelo.” She reaches her hand out. 

“Please, call me Melo and I’m a hugger myself.” Melo hugs James and closes his eyes. He opens them and jumps, “What the hell is he doing here?!”  

The camera pans over to Rey Fenix sitting on the couch. 

“Animo!” Fenix says as he springs to his feet. The two go face to face before James steps in between them. 

“Gentlemen, please.” Both men back up a bit. 

“I called you both into my office to congratulate you.” 

“For what?” Carmelo asks. 

“You two have had some amazing matches the past few weeks. Y’all have been stealing the show every time you go out there and I am more than impressed.”

“Gracias” 

“Thank you” 

“With that being said, you guys are currently tied 1-1. So I thought that we’d make the final match between you two a bit more interesting” 

James walks over to a stand with a velvet red blanket over it. 

“You two will have your final match next week and the winner will get this” 

James lifts the blanket and reveals the AEW North American Championship. Hayes and Fenix are both excited at what they see. 

“I want to emphasize this point, gentlemen. This match will be a winner take all, so whoever loses will have to earn their way back to get a shot at this. Is that understood” 

“Yes” 

“Yes ma’am” 

“Good, now go prepare cause I cannot wait to see this match. Good luck to you both” 

Hayes and Fenix exit.

There’s another knock on the door

“Who is it?” James asks 

The AEW Women's World Champion Britt Baker walks into the room, the crowd boos. 

“Hey Mickie!” 

“Hi Britt, what can I help you with?”

“Oh nothing, I just wanted to say thank you so much for signing, my friend and training partner, Candice LeRae to Collision”

Candice LeRae walks into the room and shakes James hand. 

“Thank you so much for the opportunity” 

“No problem, Candice. It was a no brainer to bring a woman with such a rich wrestling history onto our roster. I plan on creating the greatest Women's division in the world!” 

“Well I’m honored to be apart of it” 

“Me too. Candice, it looks like you got your gear on, would you be interested in a match tonight?”  

“Tonight? May I ask who?” 

“Well there is a young woman from Ring of Honor who’s really gotten my attention. Her name is Sol Ruca and she’s been impressive to say the least. But, I’d love to see how she does against a veteran like yourself before I make anything official. The match would be next, are you in?” 

Candice chuckles, “Yeah I’m in. And sorry in advance for the embarrassment I’m about to make her.” 

The two turn to leave but run into Jade Cargill. 

“Jade,” says Mickie James. “Thanks for coming, ladies if you wouldn’t mind” 

“We were about to leave anyway,” says Baker. 

“Yeah, I bet” Cargill says as she mean mugs her. Cargill reaches her hand to touch the title but Baker pulls it in close

**Match 2:** Candice LeRae vs Sol Ruca

Sol Ruca has an impressive showing as she uses her high flying skills to have the upper hand on LeRae. But, thanks to Baker’s distractions, Ruca is barely able to get ahead. Ruca is setting up LeRae for her finisher, but Baker hits Ruca in the face with the title while LeRae distracts the ref. LeRae hits her finisher and gets the 1,2,3. 

**Candice LeRae (W)**

After the match, LeRae and Baker continue to beat down and stomp Ruca. Jade Cargill’s music hits as she runs to the ring. Baker and LeRae quickly leave as Cargill makes her way in. The pair laugh as Cargill helps Ruca to her feet and gives her a side hug. 

**(Vignette) “Feast your eyes on the greatest young Luchador in Mexico…Mascara Dorada is All Elite. Coming soon”**

**(Backstage)** We see Jade Cargill help Sol Ruca as she limps backstage. Mickie James approaches them.

“Sol, I am so sorry. I didn’t think this would happen, how do you feel?”

“My ankle hurts but I don’t think it’s anything too serious.”

The three arrive outside the medical room

“Good, here the doctors here will check you out and make sure everything is good.”

“Thank you” 

“And Sol, you really impressed me out there. When you’re back to a hundred percent, we’ll have a serious talk about your future. Feel better.”

“Thank you, Mickie. And thank you Jade, I really appreciate your help out there.”

“Of course, those bitches have a lot of hell to pay.”

The doctors help Sol into the medical room. Jade watches her go in and starts to breathe heavily.

“Mickie, I can’t just let that slide.”

“I completely agree.”

“And if Britt says that I need some wins under my belt, then I have no problem taking down LeRae to get to her.”

“I like the way you think, I’ll make it official for next week.”

“Thank you” Jade walks off with a massive grin.

James’ phone starts to ring, she puts it on speaker. 

“Hello?”

“Hey Mickie.”

“Mercedes? Where are you? I haven’t seen you all day.”

“Listen, I got caught up in some things. I had a problem with getting my ring gear ready for Saturday, my driver was late to pick me up yesterday, and my coffee got cold this morning.”

“Mercedes, I understand but I needed you here tonight. How soon can you get here?”

“Yeah, about that. I wasn’t able to get on the plane this morning so I can’t make it.”

“But it was the company’s private jet, how were you not able to make it?”

“Look, that’s not important. What is important is that I signed the contract last week and I rest up for my match on Saturday. So I’ll see you then.”

“But-” Mercedes ends the call. 

**(Backstage Segment)** We see Chemical X (Gigi Dolan, Shotzi, and Tatum Paxley) hanging out backstage. Live and Raquel Rodriguez approach. 

“Hey look, Raquel. It’s the powerpuff girls. HAHAHA.” Raquel and Liv snicker. Gigi steps up.

“What’s your problem, Liv?”

“My problem isn’t with you, Ginger Ale. My problem is with those two who think they have a chance at getting those tag titles before us.”

Shotzi steps up, “If you have such a problem, then do something about it.” 

“Easy, green dwarf,” says Liv. “We don’t have our gear, but we’ll have it next week. See you then. HAHAHAHA.” Liv and Raquel chuckle as they walk away, Chemical X stares them down.

**Match 3:** Leon Slatter and JeVon Evans vs MCMG for AEW Tag Team Championship 

The two teams have an exciting back and forth high flying technical match. Jevon and MCMG are fighting on the outside when Slatter jumps over the turnbuckle and takes them all out. Slatter grabs Shelly and throws him into the ring. He gets up to the top rope and hits the 430 swanton. Before he can go for the cover, two hooded men jump the barricade and stomp out Shelly and Slatter causing the ref to ring the bell, ending the match in a DQ. The hooded men lower their hoods and it’s…Dax Harwood and Cash Wheeler! FTR is ALL ELITE. Sabin and Evans slide in to help their partners but they get beaten down too. Wheeler slides out of the ring and grabs the titles. Harwood and Wheeler each grab a title and take out both teams with hitting them in the face with them. They stand over the four men and hold the tag titles high. 

**(Backstage interview)** Renee Paquette is standing backstage with MJF and Domink Mysterio

“Maxwell, Dominik, a lot of people are confused by this sudden pairing. What is it that has you two allies?” 

“Don’t worry Daddy Dom, I got this one. Renee, it should be obvious why two of the greatest, smartest, and most handsome wrestlers alive would want to have each other's backs. See we tell it how it is whether people like it or not and they simply can’t handle it. While Dom is young, he’s still a 20 year vet and I feel that there’s a lot for me to learn there. While I have been a world champion and main evented stadiums, something that Dom will soon do, so it was really a no-brainer for us to not only have each other's backs, but learn from each other's brains.” 

“That’s right,” Dom says as boos echo throughout the arena. “We also have something else in common, our hatred for the elderly. AJ Styles is nothing more than an old horse waiting for the shot to put him out of his misery and I have no problem doing it. And me and Punk have had beef for years. This is the same guy who embarrassed me in front of my family, not that I care about them, but he still embarrassed me. And when I was finally old enough to confront him, he left. So I came here to make sure that I get my revenge, and tonight, we’re going to make sure these geezers stay out of Maxwell's way when he becomes champion on Saturday.”

The two walk off.

**(Backstage Segment)** CM Punk and AJ Styles are watching on a TV in their locker room. Punk is wrapping up his hands while AJ stretches. 

“Can you believe this crap?” Says AJ Styles

“Sadly, I can. Fortunately, we get to go out there and shut their mouths ourselves. Let’s go”

Punk goes to leave but Styles grabs his arm

“I heard what you said out there. Just know that if it’s you and I in the finals, I’ll show you first hand that these tires got plenty of miles to go.”

The crowd cheers.

“I look forward to it.”

**Main Event:** Dominik Mysterio and MJF vs AJ Styles and CM Punk

AJ and Punk are working well as a team as MJF and Dom struggle to gain any sort of momentum. Later in the match, Punk, Styles and MJF are in the ring. Punk swings at Dom but Dom ducks causing Punk to almost hit Styles. Punk apologizes but Dom pushes Punk into Styles and grabs Punk by the waist and rolls him up. 1,2 Styles kicks Dom in the face to break up the count. Styles hops to the apron and sets up the Phenomenal Forearm, but MJF pushes Dom, causing AJ to connect on Punk. AJ looks done and apologies but Dom kicks him in the back, setting him up for the 619. Dom hits it and tags in MJF who picks up Styles and puts him on the apron and connects with a Heat Seeker. 1,2,3. 

**Dom and MJF (W)**

Dom and MJF celebrate as they walk up the ramp. AJ Styles leans against the ropes, frustrated to say the least. Punk grabs AJ’s arm from behind and turns him around and gets in his face. He starts to bark at AJ and AJ barks back, eventually pushing Punk. The tow go face to face and we see Swerve Strickland standing at the top of the ramp laughing.

Swerve makes his way to the ring and grabs a mic. 



“Milwaukee, how are we feeling tonight?” 



The crowd cheers 



“Yeah I’m feeling that way too. This Saturday, I will compete in a four way elimination match for the Undisputed Championship. I don't know what the other competitors are thinking but I know that I’m not leaving empty handed. See I’m a very confident man, but my confidence went through the roof when I heard that all three of my opponents will be competing in a match tonight. So I’m gonna sit in the back and get real close to the monitor and watch those three beat the hell out of each other while I sit back and smile. And then I’m going to rest and prepare myself for whatever I’m going to have to do this Saturday- 



\*CM Punks music plays\* 



The crowd loses it as Swerve turns his head and looks up the ramp with a sour look. 



CM Punk comes out and makes his way to the ring. 



“Swerve, I’m sorry to interrupt but I heard this crowd in the back and I selfishly had to come out here and feel this energy. Milwaukee! Let me hear you!” 



The rowdy crowd cheers and starts to chant “CM Punk, CM Punk, CM Punk!”



“I’m close to home and boy does it feel good, but I know it’s going to be even better when I win the Undisputed Championship on Saturday in Chicago. And speaking of this Saturday, Swerve, you mentioned earlier that you didn’t know what we were thinking, so I thought I’d come down and tell you first hand. See all I’ve been able to think about for the past few weeks is winning the championship. And it’s not just the fact that it’s a home game for me and that it would be sweet to win the big one at home again. Although, that’s plenty of motivation for me. The real reason I want to win this title is because this title and this show needs me to win the title. 



The crowd says “ooouuu”



“Now if I can be open and honest for a minute about everyone else,” says Punk. “AJ Styles is an incredible wrestler and genuinely one of the greatest of all time. I mean anyone else calls themselves phenomenal and I’d roll my eyes, but he’s earned that name. But I don’t know how much thread is left on those tires and I wouldn’t want him to lose it to some young hotshot just because he can’t keep up.” 



The crowd erupts in “Oouuus and Ahhhs” again. 



“Then there’s that loud mouth, MJF, and I know it’s the pot calling the kettle black but see it’s different with him. He calls himself the best in the world just like I did but here’s the difference. I spent years putting in work, tearing myself down, and building myself up again just so I can build that belief in myself. I traveled around the world and faced any and everybody. I knew I was the best in the world because of what I endured and how it didn’t stop me from moving forward. But MJF calls himself the best in the world because that’s what other people told him when he was growing up. See I can tell and feel real confidence when I’m standing across from somebody and boy oh boy did you reek of uncertainty and the last thing this title and show deserves is the number one guy to be pissing himself while he “leads”. Sure he acted all mad and frustrated when he found out this would be a four way match, but I’m sure he was smiling on the inside because when he doesn’t get the job done, he’ll have an out. But Maxwell, (Punk stares into the camera) when I win this title and you stumble your way into a shot, I’m going to show you first hand that the truth always prevails and that truth is that I’M THE BEST IN THE WORLD…and you know it.” 



The crowd goes crazy again and starts to chant for Punk. 



“Which brings me to you, Swerve. I know this may be our first time having a conversation one on one, but I know a lot about you. I’ve watched a lot of you. I know about all the hard work you did to get here. When I stand across from you I feel the confidence oozing out of you, I feel that you think you’re ready. But after watching tape and seeing how you’ve acted the past few weeks, you’re not ready yet.”



The crowd says “ooouuu”. Swerve nods his head as he puckers his lips. 



“It’s ok, y’all. I can see how some can take that as disrespect, but it’s important to listen to someone like Punk no matter how it may make you feel. If you’re being honest, Punk, then I will too. You have been such an inspiration to me throughout my career. You’ve taught me to believe in myself, to stand up for myself no matter who stands across from me, and to be a man for the people when the message is right. And you’re right about me being confident and believing in myself, but you were also right about something else you said…you called yourself selfish.” 



The crowd screams “oouuu” 



“I mean just listen to you, Punk. You think that this title needs you? What we need is for you and other vets to step aside while we take care of business and run this ship. What we need is for y’all to stop taking opportunities from those that deserve it. I hate MJF just as much as you do, but I’d rather a young guy like him hold the strap than seeing people like you holding onto your glory days with an iron-like grip thinking you know better. When the only thing that should be known is that this is my house now and I’ll be damned if I let you in thinking you can still put your feet up” 



The crowd has mixed reactions as Punk mocks Swerve and nods his head while puckering his lips. 



“Well like I said earlier the truth prevails and the truth is that daddy’s home and the only place my feet are going are straight up your ass this Saturday.”



Punk drops the mic and bumps into Swerve as he walks past him. Swerve grabs Punk and turns him back around. The two stand nose to nose as the crowd cheers. 



**(Backstage at the curtain)** Renee stands with Andrade. 



“Andrade, you’re about to have your match with Dolph Ziggler but I can help notice that you’re going out there alone. Have you heard from Zelina?” 



“Renee, you don’t need to worry about all that. I know Zelina very well and I know that she would never want to disappoint me. I know that she will come out and have my back, just like I’ve had hers. Once we are united, I can finally turn my attention to winning gold and being the best person on this roster. Now if you’ll excuse me, I am going to start that mission right now.” 



Andrade walks through the curtain as his theme song plays. 

  


**Match 1:** Andrade vs Dolph Ziggler 



The two have a back and forth classic. Andrade is finally able to get the advantage as he is setting up his finisher while Ziggler struggles to his feet. As he yells at Ziggler to get up, Zelina walks out on stage and down the ramp. Andrade has a smile on her face as she approaches the ring. The ref is distracted checking on Ziggler as Zelina jumps onto the apron. Andrade opens his arms and Zelina does the same while smiling. Andrade walks towards her and as he closes in, Zelina slaps him across the face. Andrade grabs his face and Ziggler springs up from the mat and hits Andrade with the Zig Zag. 1,2,3 Ziggler wins. 



**Dolph Ziggler (W)**



Ziggler celebrates as he goes up the ramp. The music stops and Zelina enters the ring, laughing at Andrade. Andrade starts to come to and looks up at Zelina laughing. He starts to get pissed as he slams the mat and stands up. He yells at Zelina, “Perra estúpida, ¿por qué harías eso?, ¿por que?” Andrade approaches her and Zelina stops laughing. She dawns a scared expression as she slowly backs up. Andrade continues to walk towards her until her back is against the turnbuckles. She starts to cower in the corner as he continues to bark at her. Zelina covers her face and it looks like she is crying, but Andrade doesn’t let up. Zelina slowly starts to stand up straight, she moves her hands from her face and she’s laughing. 



The lights go out 



When the lights come back on, Aleister Black is standing behind Andrade. The crowd loses their minds as Zelina is laughing like a maniac. Andrade, while still looking at Zelina, is confused. He turns and gets hit with a Black Mass. Black sits cross legged over him, Zelina stands behind him and puts her hand on his shoulder. Zelina starts to laugh and the lights go out. 

  


**(Backstage Segment)** Carmelo Hayes walks into GM Mickie James' office. 



“Thanks for coming to meet with me, Carmelo.” She reaches her hand out. 



“Please, call me Melo and I’m a hugger myself.” Melo hugs James and closes his eyes. He opens them and jumps, “What the hell is he doing here?!”

The AEW Women's World Champion Britt Baker walks into the room, the crowd boos. 



“Hey Mickie!” 



“Hi Britt, what can I help you with?”



“Oh nothing, I just wanted to say thank you so much for signing, my friend and training partner, Candice LeRae to Collision”

What's your answer to these three questions?

“three questions” by

Caitlyn Siehl

My mother tells me

that when I meet someone I like,

I have to ask them three questions:

what are you afraid of?

do you like dogs?

what do you do when it rains?

of those three, she says the first one

is the most important.

“They gotta be scared of something,

baby. Everybody is. If they aren’t

afraid of anything, then they don’t

believe in anything, either.”

I met you on a Sunday, right

after church.

one look and my heart fell into

my stomach like a trap door.

on our second date,

I asked you what you were afraid of.

“spiders, mostly. being alone. little

children, like, the ones who just

learned how to push a kid over on

the playground. oh and space. holy

shit, space.”

I asked you if you liked dogs.

“I have three.”

I asked you what you do when it

rains.

“sleep, mostly. sometimes I sit at the

window and watch the rain droplets

race. I make a shelter out of plastic in

my backyard for all the stray

animals; leave them food and a place

to sleep.”

he smiled like he knew.

like his mom told him the same

thing.

“how about you?”

me?

I’m scared of everything.

of the hole in the o-zone layer,

of the lady next door who never

smiles at her dog,

and especially of all the secrets

the government must be breaking

it’s back trying to keep from us.

I love dogs so much, you have no

idea.

I sleep when it rains.

I want to tell everyone I love them.

I want to find every stray animal and

bring them home.

I want to wake up in your hair

and make you shitty coffee

and kiss your neck

and draw silly stick figures of us.

I never want to ask anyone else

these questions

The sun rose over Hoshizora High, turning the school windows gold. Students hurried inside, but three boys walked together at a slower pace — step matching step, like they were already synced.



Christian Morey, quiet and thoughtful, carried the trio’s shared planner.

Blue Robichaud, energetic and full of fire, swung his bag like it weighed nothing.

Jeffrey Anderson, calm and elegant, held the iced coffees he bought for all of them.



From the outside, they looked like friends walking to class.

But from the inside… they were something much more.



★ How It Started ★



It began months ago, when all three realized that the feelings between them weren’t a triangle — but a circle. Every connection went both directions:



Blue liked Christian’s quiet warmth and Jeffrey’s calm charm.



Christian admired Blue’s passion and Jeffrey’s gentleness.



Jeffrey adored Christian’s honesty and Blue’s fearless energy.



No one felt left out.

No one felt overshadowed.

It was three hearts fitting together like puzzle pieces.



One night on the school roof, under fairy lights from the cultural festival, they sat talking until midnight. Christian had finally whispered:



“…I don’t want to choose. I love you both.”



Blue leaned back, smiling softly.

“Good. Because I like both of you too.”



Jeffrey nodded, cheeks flushed.

“Then we can love each other… all of us.”



And that was the beginning.



★ A Day in the Life of Three Boyfriends ★



At lunch, the trio always shared the same bento box. Blue cooked (surprisingly well), Christian cut everything into cute shapes, and Jeffrey arranged it like a food artist.



Christian sat in the middle, but only because Blue and Jeffrey liked sitting close to each other, too — Blue casually resting his head on Jeffrey’s shoulder, Jeffrey tapping Christian’s knee when he got lost in thought.



They held hands under the table.

Sometimes all three at once, fingers tangled.



It was warm.

It was easy.

It was theirs.



★ Moments That Made Their Hearts Melt ★



Blue, after track practice, collapsing onto both boys like a dramatic anime character.

“You guys have to carry me home. I’m dying.”



Christian laughing as he tried to lift him.

Jeffrey actually picking Blue up bridal style.

Blue screaming.



Christian falling asleep on his desk during study hour.

Jeffrey draping a blanket over him.

Blue sitting beside him protectively, shooing away anyone who got too loud.



Jeffrey whispering: “You’re very sweet with him, you know.”

Blue whispering back: “You are too.”



Jeffrey, stressed from student council work, hiding in the music room.

Christian gently rubbing his back.

Blue insisting, “Okay guys, group hug. Mandatory. No one escapes.”



Jeffrey melting right into their arms, relief washing over him.



★ A Rooftop Promise ★



One evening after class, they met on the roof again. The sky was lavender and orange, and the city lights blinked far below.



Blue took both their hands.

“Let’s make a promise.”



Christian blinked. “A promise about what?”



Jeffrey smiled softly.

“About us.”



Blue nodded, suddenly shy.

“That no matter what, we stay honest. We talk. We don’t bottle things up. We love each other equally.”



Christian squeezed their hands.

“I want that too. I want all of us.”



Jeffrey leaned his forehead against theirs.

“Then… we’ll make it work. Together.”



Christian closed his eyes.

Blue laughed softly.

Jeffrey breathed out, peaceful.



Three boys in one quiet moment.

Three hearts beating in sync.

A love that wasn’t one-sided or broken or complicated — just warm, mutual, and real.



★ And So Their Story Continued… ★



Walking home sharing one umbrella.

Studying together in the library.

Blue falling asleep on the couch with Christian curled at his side and Jeffrey’s head on his lap.

Little kisses stolen in empty hallways.

Three lockers next to each other.

Three hearts learning how to love as one.



And every day, no matter how busy or chaotic school got…



They always met under the same cherry blossom tree after class.

Just to say:



“I love you.”

“I love you too.”

“I love both of you.”

1qe0hhl,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DNLR4NGQ,"FREE KINDLE BOOK – 3 DAYS ONLY (January 15-17, 2026) Poetry: ...And Bits And Bits.","For three days only, …And Bits And Bits is free—an unfiltered drift through non-existence, labour, consciousness, and the joke that keeps telling itself. As one reader observed, “The reader is not guided toward closure but gently bludgeoned into acceptance.” Or, as the collection itself puts it: “Nothing is happening; everywhere, all the time.”

A Review of …And Bits And Bits by David Mark Kirkwood

Reading …And Bits And Bits feels less like reading a poetry collection and more like riding a powered pallet jack through ontology, labour politics, fart jokes, Zen koans, warehouse bathrooms, Christmas carols, and the void—often simultaneously. It is Whitman if Whitman clocked in, Beckett if Beckett worked safety meetings, Bukowski if Bukowski discovered non-duality and still had to punch out by 3:30.

This is not a book that “develops themes.” It obsesses, loops, chews, re-chews, then spits themes back out only to ask whether anything was ever there to begin with. As one line puts it with ruthless efficiency:

“That which forms— / Is no thing.”

Kirkwood’s central fixation—call it non-existence, naught, the void, the joke the universe keeps telling itself—appears everywhere, from cosmic proclamations to the most ignoble bodily functions. One moment you’re handed a metaphysical hand grenade—

“Thought is an emergent property / Of non-existence.”

—and the next you’re staring at the unignorable poetry of embodiment:

“I didn’t poo, / But I’m gonna wipe—”

This oscillation is the book’s engine. High metaphysics meets low matter. Nagarjuna meets the lunchroom. Laozi meets labour scheduling. The result is not contradiction but texture.

Warehouse Zen and Blue-Collar Gnosticism

What makes …And Bits And Bits distinct isn’t just its philosophical reach—it’s its setting. This is one of the rare contemporary poetry collections where forklifts, pallet stacks, operator platforms, safety advisors, and management meetings aren’t metaphors; they’re the terrain of enlightenment.

“The world; my operator’s platform— / I’m walking the T-JACK!”

Kirkwood turns wage labour into a monastery without romanticizing it. Capitalism is not critiqued from a café; it’s anatomized from inside the machine:

“Capitalism exploits— / Where there are none / To be exploited, / Capitalism collapses.”

This is Marx filtered through absurdism, filtered again through someone who has actually attended the meetings. If David Graeber had written haiku during shift work, it might have looked like this.

The Sacred, the Profane, and the Hilarious

The book’s irreverence is not decorative—it’s methodological. Religion, nationalism, productivity culture, media narratives, and identity signaling all get skewered with the same blunt tool:

“Give us your money, / Give us your eternal soul— / We shall give you— / Naught.”

Elsewhere, Kirkwood dismantles solemnity by refusing to let it stand uninterrupted. A hymn becomes a fart joke; a Christmas carol becomes a logistical nightmare; reverence collapses under its own weight:

“Peace is meaningless… / Without WAR!”

This is not cynicism. It’s anti-pretension. The book insists—over and over—that meaning collapses the moment it takes itself too seriously.

Form as Philosophy

The sheer volume—hundreds of short poems, fragments, haiku, riffs, chants, complaints—is the point. The repetition enacts the thesis. Non-existence doesn’t resolve; it recurs. The reader is not guided toward closure but gently bludgeoned into acceptance.

“Nothing is happening; everywhere, all the time.”

If this were music, it would be drone. If it were film, it would be a warehouse surveillance feed that suddenly becomes Tarkovsky. If it were tech, it would be an open-source operating system running on jokes, rage, wonder, and coffee breaks.

Why It Works

Despite (or because of) its sprawl, …And Bits And Bits never pretends to be important. That’s its strength. It understands that pretending not to matter is often the most honest position available:

“Everything is perfect. / One need not understand / The workings…”

Kirkwood doesn’t ask to be agreed with. He asks to be witnessed, preferably while you’re half-tired, slightly irritated, and wondering why the bathroom smells like piss.

This book will not change your life.

It might, however, sit next to it, muttering inconvenient truths while you’re trying to get through the day.

And that’s rarer.

If …And Bits And Bits teaches anything, it’s this: nothing lasts, nothing resolves, and everything counts anyway.

I'm a 20-year-old woman and a deep introvert. Large groups, loud environments, and constant small talk exhaust me very quickly. I need plenty of time alone to recharge and feel like myself, and when I'm with people I prefer calm, one-on-one moments where I can actually relax and open up. I've accepted this part of who I am, but lately the loneliness has been heavier than usual and I'm hoping to find someone who shares the same quiet rhythm. Someone I can get to know gradually, without any pressure to be outgoing, energetic, or always filling every silence.

I'm in my second year of college, mostly keeping my days simple and low-key outside of classes. In my free time I love reading fantasy novels with rich world-building or quiet literary stories that explore inner thoughts, watching slower character-driven movies and series that let the atmosphere build, listening to gentle music like lo-fi, ambient, or soft indie while I journal random thoughts, doodle, or just sit with a cup of tea or coffee. I enjoy brewing drinks exactly how I like them, taking long walks when the streets are peaceful and uncrowded, collecting quotes or passages that resonate with me, and simply letting time pass while my mind wanders freely. Crowded places, noisy social scenes, and back-to-back plans make me feel overwhelmed fast. I feel most at peace when things are calm, slow, and unhurried.

I'm not looking for someone who wants to change that about me or pull me into a more extroverted lifestyle. What I'm hoping for is another introvert who understands it instinctively. Someone comfortable with silences that don't feel awkward, who prefers one deep conversation over many surface-level ones, who would enjoy simple shared moments like reading quietly in the same room, exchanging book or music recommendations, watching something thoughtful together, or talking about life, feelings, dreams, or whatever comes up when the moment feels natural. I believe two introverts can create something really gentle, respectful, and meaningful because we both value personal space and choose closeness carefully.

I'd like to hear from guys around 19 to 25 who also identify as introverted. You don't have to be extremely shy or have trouble talking, just someone who naturally recharges in solitude, thinks deeply, and prefers thoughtful, low-energy connection over constant stimulation or frequent plans. Distance is completely fine if the conversation feels genuine and worth nurturing.

If this sounds like it could describe you, please feel free to message me whenever you're ready. Maybe tell me a little about yourself, what you enjoy doing when you're alone, a book or song that's been keeping you company lately, or what your perfect quiet evening looks like. There's no pressure to reply quickly or be very talkative at first. We can start small, take things as slow as we both need, and see if it feels natural. I'm just hoping to find one person who makes the quiet feel a little less lonely and a little more shared. Thank you for reading this.",0,1768521865.0,IntrovertDating,5,0.5,False

After riding for hours, napahinto kami saglit sa isang coffee shop along the highway. We relaxed for a bit dahil inabot na kami ng tanghali at medyo mainit. Everything went fine until nung lumapit liniligawan ng tropa ko saakin

She was asking if pwede pang iikot daw nila Vespa ko. Since wala pang installed footpegs at wala pang ceramic coat yung vespa, I declined their request dahil may possibility na magasgasan yung vespa. I told her na kapag meron na, pwede nilang hiramin scooter ko. She smiled and said ""Sige salamat!""

While I was busy drinking coffee and checking my phone, my friend suddenly sat on my scooter. Hindi ko naman pinagbabawal umupo siya dahil He was just checking it out but not until sinabi niya saakin ""Tol ganda ng Vespa mo ah. Ikot ko lang ha?"" Tinawag niya liniligawan niya at sinabing ""Halika na bilisan mo! Iikot lang natin!"" 

I didn't even said yes to him and since nakalagay lang susi sa scooter ko, nagmadali silang i-ride kahit walang pa silang suot na helmet. Napatingin pa saakin yung liniligawan niya na nahihiya. After their ride my friend returned my scooter. ""Grabe tol iba talaga vespa. Iba pakirmdam ng scooter mo!"" 

Pagbaba ng liniligawan niya lumapit saakin at nagsosorry. Sinabi ko sa kanya ""Sana nakakaintindi kayo ng salitang hindi pwede. Hindi ko naman ipagdadamot yan sadyang maingat lang ako dahil wala pang footpeg yan at ceramic coat."" Nagpasensya ulit yung babae saakin.

Habang yung kaibigan ko parang wala lang. Kinausap ko siya sabi ko ""Next time tol wag ganun. Kapag pumayag ako doon mo lang gamitin"" Sabay patawang sinabi ""Sus ipagdadamot mo ba yan saakin? Hiramin mo rin motor ko kung gusto mo""

Her hospital room was full with my family and as I stepped out of the room to make a cup of coffee I heard someone from the next ward singing “oh Danny boy” and when I went back into the room to say goodbye to my family I could feel the presence of my loved ones who have passed around her.

And the first time I used an air fryer that made light roasts that tasted amazing too. 

Honestly I didn’t think it’d be this easy to get amazing tasting co-ferment beans. I thought with all the charting and machinery, that roasting was complicated. Maybe it is and co-ferments are just easier to get right? I have no idea.🤣 

I just ordered another bag of fermented beans, lactic acidacid fermented ones. ",6,1768521395.0,roasting,1,1.0,False

35F  SW 179lbs  CW 169lbs  GW 149lbs

I wanted to share my experience with Reta and get your opinions based on your own personal journeys.

I started Reta on August 21st at 0.5 mg once a week, every Friday, and slowly titrated up from there.

In terms of side effects, I experienced an elevated heart rate with the first dose and sometimes fatigue the day after the injection. I should mention that before starting Reta, I struggled with mild constipation, but now things are smooth and regular.

I noticed the most significant weight loss when my dose reached 3 mg around the end of October. At the end of November, I increased to 4 mg, and since then, the weight loss has stopped. While on 4 mg, I had to pause Reta due to the flu. I had no appetite or energy during the illness, so once I recovered a bit, I restarted at 2.5 mg and titrated back up to 4 mg. Worth noting is when I increased the dose to 4mg this was different vial, so not sure if the batch is off.

I do exercise-maybe not as often as I’d like-but I go to the gym whenever I can. My job is sedentary, and my sleep could definitely improve (having a one‑year‑old makes that tricky). Since being on Reta, I rarely have cravings, and my appetite is sometimes so suppressed that I have to remind myself to eat. I don’t drink alcohol; water and coffee are my main beverages. Food‑wise, I cook mostly from scratch and try to prioritise protein.

I suppose the purpose of this post is to find some direction. My mind feels chaotic with all the uestions. Should I increase the dose? Should I drop back to 3 mg? Should I micro‑dose? Should I stop Reta and switch to Tirz? Should I stack it with another peptide? I know I have some gaps in my activity levels, and I’m working on that.

I’m just looking for advice based on your personal experience because my thoughts are all over the place at the moment.

1qe0382,https://www.reddit.com/r/Strongerman/comments/1qe0382/what_older_men_wish_theyd_learned_at_20_the/,What Older Men Wish They'd Learned at 20 The Science Based Life Guide Nobody Shares,"Spent months diving into research, interviews with men 40+, books like *The Defining Decade*, podcasts with psychologists, and countless YouTube deep dives. The patterns were insane. Almost every guy I talked to had the same regrets, wished they'd known the same stuff. So here's what actually matters, stripped of the feel good BS.

**your 20s aren't a throwaway decade**

Society sells you this lie that your 20s are for ""finding yourself"" and ""having fun"" while real life starts at 30. Bullshit. Your brain doesn't finish developing until 25, but the habits you build in your 20s? They compound. Hard. The guys who figured this out early are miles ahead now, not because they're smarter, just because they started earlier.

This isn't about grinding 24/7 or skipping parties. It's about being intentional instead of drifting. Most 20 year olds operate on autopilot, doing what feels good in the moment, avoiding discomfort. Then they wake up at 35 wondering where the time went.

**stop outsourcing your confidence to others**

Biggest one. Men in their 40s and 50s all said the same thing: they wasted years seeking validation from women, from friends, from society. Basing their entire self worth on whether someone swiped right or if they got invited to parties.

Here's what actually builds confidence: competence. Get good at something. Anything. Learn to cook properly, lift heavy, speak another language, build stuff with your hands. Real confidence comes from knowing you can figure shit out, not from Instagram likes.

*The Six Pillars of Self-Esteem* by Nathaniel Branden breaks this down perfectly. Branden was a psychologist who spent decades studying self worth, and this book is genuinely life changing. The core idea is that self esteem comes from living consciously and practicing self acceptance, not external validation. Reading this at 20 instead of 30 would save you a decade of people pleasing.

**your body won't always bounce back**

At 20, you can eat garbage, skip sleep, party hard, and feel fine the next day. That window closes faster than you think. By 30, hangovers last three days. By 40, that old shoulder injury from pickup basketball becomes chronic pain.

Start lifting now. Not to get jacked for Instagram, but because muscle mass and bone density in your 20s literally determines your quality of life at 70. Cardio matters too. Your heart doesn't care about your excuses.

The *Huberman Lab* podcast has incredible episodes on fitness and longevity. Andrew Huberman is a Stanford neuroscientist who makes complex biology actually understandable. His episode on optimizing testosterone naturally should be required listening for every guy in his 20s. No bro science, just peer reviewed research explained clearly.

**money compounds, so does debt**

Every older guy I talked to wished they'd understood compound interest earlier. Not in a boring finance class way, but viscerally. If you invest $5,000 at 20, it becomes $70,000 by retirement. Same investment at 30 becomes $27,000. The math is brutal.

But here's the thing, it's not about penny pinching. It's about understanding that small money decisions now have massive long term consequences. That daily $6 coffee is whatever. But financing a new car at 23% interest because you wanted to look successful? That's a trap that takes years to escape.

Read *The Psychology of Money* by Morgan Housel. It won multiple awards and Housel writes for the Wall Street Journal. This isn't your typical finance book full of formulas and jargon. It's about how people actually behave with money, why we make irrational decisions, and how to build wealth through good habits instead of trying to outsmart the market. Genuinely changed how I think about every purchase.

**most friendships are circumstantial**

Hard pill. Your college buddies, your high school crew, those guys you see every weekend? Most of them won't be in your life at 35. Not because anyone did anything wrong, just because proximity was the main thing holding it together.

The friendships that last are the ones you actively maintain. You have to put in effort. Send the text. Make the plans. Show up when it's inconvenient. Adult friendships require intention because you're not forced together by circumstance anymore.

Older men consistently ranked loneliness as one of their biggest struggles. They got busy with careers and kids and looked up one day realizing they hadn't had a real conversation with a friend in months. Don't let that happen. Male friendship prevents depression, improves health outcomes, and makes life actually enjoyable according to decades of research.

**therapy isn't for broken people**

Stigma around mental health is finally dying, but most guys still wait until they're in crisis mode before seeing a therapist. That's like waiting until you have a heart attack before exercising.

Therapy when you're relatively stable is preventative maintenance. You learn healthy coping mechanisms before you desperately need them. You identify patterns before they become entrenched. You process stuff instead of burying it until it explodes later.

If traditional therapy feels too formal, try *Ash* app. It's like having a relationship and mental health coach in your pocket. The AI guides you through research backed exercises for managing anxiety, improving communication, building emotional intelligence. Not a replacement for real therapy but incredibly useful for everyday challenges.

**skills beat credentials**

College can be valuable, but the degree itself matters way less than everyone says. Older men consistently wished they'd spent more time building actual skills instead of just collecting credentials.

Can you code? Can you sell? Can you write persuasively? Can you fix things? Can you manage projects? These abilities transcend industries and create opportunities that degrees don't.

The guys who thrived in their 30s and 40s weren't necessarily the ones with the fanciest schools on their resumes. They were the ones who could actually do stuff that created value for others. Start building now. Side projects, freelance work, YouTube tutorials, whatever. Just build things and share them.

BeFreed is an AI powered learning platform built by Columbia University alumni that pulls from millions of high quality sources, books, research papers, expert interviews, and real world success stories to generate personalized audio podcasts based on whatever you want to learn.

Type in a skill or goal, like improving communication or building better habits, and it creates a custom podcast with an adaptive learning plan tailored to your intelligence type and learning style. You control the depth, from a quick 10 minute overview to a 40 minute deep dive with detailed examples and context. The voice customization is genuinely addictive, you can pick anything from a deep, smoky tone to something more energetic or sarcastic depending on your mood.

There's also a virtual coach called Freedia that you can chat with anytime to ask questions, get book recommendations, or dive deeper into specific topics. All content goes through strict fact checking to keep information accurate and science based. It's been super useful for internalizing concepts instead of just passively consuming information.

**your parents were probably right about some stuff**

Yeah, this one stings. But multiple older guys said they wasted years rebelling against parental advice that turned out to be accurate. Not everything obviously, but more than they wanted to admit at 20.

That partner they said was bad news? They saw red flags you were blind to. That career path they suggested? Maybe it wasn't about controlling you, maybe they understood the market better. That advice to save money? Turns out compound interest is real.

You don't have to follow every piece of parental wisdom, but at least consider it seriously instead of dismissing it reflexively. They've lived decades you haven't. Sometimes experience actually does matter more than youthful confidence.

**the relationship you have at 22 probably won't last, and that's okay**

Older men wished someone had told them not to force relationships that weren't working just because they'd invested time. The sunk cost fallacy destroys more relationships than infidelity.

People change massively between 20 and 30. You'll change. She'll change. The person you're compatible with at 22 might not be who you need at 32. That's not failure, that's growth.

Don't rush into marriage because you hit some arbitrary timeline. Don't stay in mediocre relationships because you're comfortable. Don't sacrifice your growth for someone who isn't growing with you. This applies to friendships too.

**you're not as smart as you think, and that's actually good news**

At 20, you think you've got the world figured out. Every older man I interviewed laughed at this. They all thought the same thing at 20, and they were all hilariously wrong about most of it.

The good news? Admitting you don't know everything is liberating. It means you can learn. It means you can change your mind when presented with better information. It means you don't have to defend stupid positions just because you stated them confidently once.

Intellectual humility is a superpower. The guys who stayed curious and adaptable thrived. The ones who dug into their 20 year old worldview and refused to evolve got left behind.

Stay uncomfortable. Keep learning. Your future self will thank you for starting now instead of waiting until life forces you to change. The time passes anyway, might as well build something worth having.",1,1768521150.0,Strongerman,1,1.0,False

fuck weight loss or weight gain or whatever fucking micro managing you want to oppose upon yourselves. Truly are you happy counting calories and spending hours at the gym?Is that your true purpose in life, your true enjoyment in life to micromanage your body to attain a standard fed to you by industries and judgemental folks? Are you happy eating either processed fast food slop or protein processed laxatives? The fuck happened to a normal fucking meal and a sport for socialization and enjoyment. This entire thing Is just fueled by self hatred, weight loss companies and food companies and it’s saddening. 

This is coming from someone who has wasted years trying to both gain and lose weight, both binged my way back up and starved myself back down and never did I ever enjoy myself not even at the fucking start not even now. Seeing people online praise insane deficits or insane amounts of weight loss, especially if the person was overweight before, makes my blood boil. Yes it was hard work and I’m happy you got a healthier body, but knowing this person had to fight themselves back down, restricting maximally, exercising a bunch just to get some validation and praise, knowing this person probably never got the kind words before they tortured themselves through it sucks ass. You all truly only care about appearance and it shows in your treatment of fat people and considering the only worth while endeavour for them active pursuit of weight loss. Same goes for skinny people feeling the pressure to become ripped. Like man just work towards what makes you feel healthy, feel good etc, weight is a side effect, not the entire issues in most cases.

The fuck happened to caring about your fucking health man. The Fuck happened to try to enjoy movement instead of hating yourself into it. Eating healthy is fun and nice and makes you feel good in general, it’s hard work but reducing it to just calorie counting shows you are barely aware of the larger issues at hand here my man. We live in a capitalist hellscape of advertising both gluttony and extreme deprivation. Bro go count, bro go to the gym run on your fucking hamster wheel, bro cut out sugar, bro cut out carbs, bro go to 900 calories. Then on the other side of the spectrum you have got bro go eat this trend, go drink this milkshake of a coffee, indulge in this mukbang cheese volcano, go bed rot and feel bad about yourself now. We use counting diets extreme gumming as a bandaid solution to the fact that we live in a world that has tainted our entire perspective on food and body, No bitch listen to me here we would all probably have less weight issues if it was not a fucking industry being sold to us every day.

I feel like I am almost radical for eating healthy food I enjoy, saying no when full but also yes to homemade soul foods. Saying no to both processed health foods and processed snacks, but also not hitting myself with a hammer if I have it. Having all food groups because we get nutrients from all of them. Choosing to do movement I like and going outside when I like, but also resting when my body hurts or something.. Trying to be okay with a heavier body because I’m strong and don’t even feel bad in it despite not being low fat muscle. Not micromanaging it anymore by counting. Every day I see shit of people getting skinnier and skinnier or people beating themselves up for not doing it. Why don’t we aim for how we feel, what helps us function instead of standards served up on a plate supported by million dollar industries.

I’m tired, I don’t want the rest of my life to be about my body and weight but it seems in our current age there’s no choice but to focus on it.",2,1768520968.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,1.0,False

1qdzxbr,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyHackGuide/comments/1qdzxbr/semax_selank_focus_protocol_1/,💉 Semax + Selank Focus Protocol 1,"Nothing will ever replace Adderall focus. Coffee, pre workout, nicotine, energy drinks all fall short. If you’ve tried everything and your brain still feels cooked, start with the basics first. Sleep. Diet. Fix that.

This protocol supports stress, attention, memory, and mental endurance. It doesn’t feel like a drug when it’s working. It feels like your brain finally cooperating. Calmer mind, less friction, easier to start tasks, better follow through.

This is how I run it.

# 🧰 What you’ll need

• Semax

• Selank 

• Bacteriostatic water

• 29 to 31g insulin syringes

• Alcohol wipes

• L theanine 

• Rhodiola Rosea

• [Peptide calculator](http://peptidedeals.co/calculator) if you don’t like doing math 

• Common Sense

🧠 What’s in the stack and why  
Semax  
This one handles cognition and mental endurance. People use it for learning, focus, and memory. It’s tied to BDNF which is basically brain adaptability and neuroplasticity.  
When it’s working well you’re not wired. You’re just mentally clear and less scattered.

Selank  
This one handles stress and anxiety signaling. Helps take the edge off without sedation. Pairs perfectly with Semax because it smooths the mental noise while Semax sharpens the signal.

Together they feel like:  
Less background anxiety  
Cleaner focus  
Less looping thoughts  
More control over attention

💉 Dosing (SubQ)  
I run everything subQ but feel free to run the nasal sprays I just prefer pinning

Morning (daily on cycle)  
Semax 500 to 1000 mcg subQ  
Selank 500 mcg subQ  
I reconstitute these with 2ml of bac

Optional evening dose  
Selank 500 mcg subQ if stress is high or anxiety creeps in later in the day

Tiny insulin syringe. Belly, thigh, love handle. Same as any peptide.

📅 Cycle structure  
5 days on  
2 days off  
Run for 3 months  
Then take at least 2 to 4 weeks fully off before restarting  
People who run it nonstop eventually say it feels weaker. Cycling keeps the effect noticeable.

🧾 What you’ll need (with actual math done)  
Vials are typically 10mg each.

Semax usage math  
Daily dose: 500 to 1000 mcg  
Over 3 months (roughly 60 dosing days with 5 on 2 off cycling)

Low end (500 mcg/day):  
500 mcg × 60 days = 30,000 mcg = 30mg total  
That’s 3 vials of 10mg

High end (1000 mcg/day):  
1000 mcg × 60 days = 60,000 mcg = 60mg total  
That’s 6 vials of 10mg

Most people land somewhere in the middle. If you want to be safe, budget 4 to 5 vials for a 3 month cycle.

Selank usage math  
Morning 500 mcg daily  
Optional evening 500 mcg on some days

If you only run mornings:  
500 mcg × 60 days = 30mg = 3 vials

If you run AM + PM often:  
1000 mcg × 60 days = 60mg = 6 vials

Realistically most people land around 4 to 5 vials per cycle.

Other things you need  
• Bacteriostatic water  
• 29 to 31g insulin syringes  
• Alcohol wipes  
• Peptide calculator if you don’t like doing math

⚡ Optional add ons I keep the same  
These are not mandatory but they stack well.

L theanine 100 to 200 mg  
Smooths anxiety. Helps if you still use caffeine.

Rhodiola Rosea 200 to 400 mg  
Helps with fatigue resistance and stress tolerance. Especially useful on long work days.

I don’t change these doses. They’re simple and effective where they’re at.

🧬 What most people actually notice  
Week one  
Quieter mind  
Less mental noise  
Less reactive to stress

Week two  
Better focus endurance  
Easier to start tasks  
Less procrastination

Week three and beyond usually where i notice effects the most  
Better working memory  
More consistent productivity  
Less emotional volatility  
Brain feels cooperative instead of chaotic

You don’t feel high.  
You don’t feel wired.  
You just feel more mentally functional.  
That’s the whole point.

❓Common questions  
Can I still use caffeine  
Yes. Most people naturally reduce caffeine because they stop needing as much.

Does this feel like Adderall  
Not even close. Completely different lane.

Does subQ work better than nasal  
For consistency yes. Nasal can work but absorption varies wildly between people.

Can I run this year round  
You can but most people report diminishing effects. Cycling keeps it working.

1qdzvtm,https://www.reddit.com/r/DesignMyRoom/comments/1qdzvtm/please_help_us_with_our_weird_shaped_living_room/,Please help us with our weird shaped living room,"Hi Reddit!

We moved into our first home just over a year ago, and we feel a bit stuck decorating and arranging our living room, so we are writing to ask for some help.

For context, our living room is open-plan and joined to the kitchen; there was once a wall there, but during a previous renovation and small extension, it was removed (which is why there is a gap in the wall). The door opening into the coffee table is a cupboard, which is under the stairs. We would ideally like access to the cupboard easily, hence the wonky sofa. We really want to fit a corner sofa in here somehow and ditch the old sofa, but we are struggling to find one that would fit in some of the previous plans we thought could work. The furniture we have all needs an update too, so any recommendations for new items is greatly appreciated.

I have attached some screenshots of a recreation in planner 5d, the measurements are not exact, but they're the best we can get with a tape measure.

Any advice would be much appreciated, as right now it doesn't feel ""homely"" enough, and we know the people of Reddit are magicians, and we're really hoping for some help before we go insane.

Early into our relationship my boyfriends best friend from college and his girlfriend moved to the same city where we live. Us four started hanging out doing the regular double date stuff. She did not know many people or have any friends when they moved here so we started hanging out and I introduced her to my friends. We would get dinner, grab coffee or hangout in some form about 2-3 times a month. About 3 months ago I texted her if she wanted to get dinner as my boyfriend was out of town for work. We went out to dinner and were planning to meet up with a larger group of friends after we were done. After dinner we went back to my apartment to kill time and have a drink before meeting up with a group. We had a couple drinks sitting on the couch just chatting, she put her hand on my leg and I immediately was interested. I leaned over and kissed her. I don’t know if it was the alcohol or what made me do that. She kissed me back and it went on from there. Prior to this I had never done anything with another girl. Since then we have been secretly hooking up without our boyfriends knowing. I don’t necessarily feel a romantic connection but I very much enjoy hooking up with her and spending that time with her.

The way the iris is what gives the eye its color, gives it its particular way of seeing the world. Without you, light had entered but nothing was truly seen- everything blured into gray indistinction. 

And then you quite literally walked into my life and suddenly there was hue. 

Deep, shifting, bright and rich shades I didn’t know existed. Every glance I take now is tinted by you. The sky is bluer because you looked up at it once beside me. Coffee tastes richer because your fingers once curled around the same mug. Even ordinary streets feel acticipatory because I wonder if you will walk down them and we meet at halfway.

And like the iris, you’re irreplaceable. Remove it and the eye might still function, but the soul of sight is just gone. The world would be there, but flat and lost of its wonder.

I don’t know if you ever felt the same. like I was some essential piece of how you saw things. I tell myself it doesn’t matter. What matters more is that for me, you still are. Even now. Even unsaid. Even unsent. You are absolutely everything, you are what made my eyes see.

I put them together because they're incredibly similar coffees, despite being from completely different producers in completely different places with completely different processes, they both have super vivid lime and white chocolate notes and are some of the brightest, most expressive coffees you'll ever taste, white lotus especially, which has some really nice floral undertones. Electric Lime, on the other hand, has a subtle creaminess that makes me think of key lime pie, likely due to the coferment process.

  
White Lotus is a tad more complex, but Electric Lime is so bright and easy drinking that I think it's my preference of the two, but both are stellar, and if you gave me a cup of each right now I think I'd struggle to tell the difference. What I'm really curious about is how they end up SO similar dispite being from completely different sources. I think it must be smething to do with the coferment on the Electric Lime, but it's not a coferment you would expect, I think they use pineapple!

Really strange just how similar they are, but both of them are, in my opinion, among DAK's best and definitely worth considering if you're looking to buy from them, the pairing of super bright lime and white chocolate is soooo good.",2,1768520144.0,pourover,2,0.75,False
1qdzo1u,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_whale_sharkz/comments/1qdzo1u/aita_for_cutting_off_my_roomate/,AITA for cutting off my roomate?,"This is kind of long so bear with me. I (23f) live with two other people (also 23f) in college. I’ve shared an apartment with one of them for the past two years (we’ll call her A) and one of them just moved in this year (we’ll call her B). Last year I was going through some personal things with my family and had one of the worst bouts of depression that I’ve ever had, and A was a really good friend to me through this time and we got fairly close. She is likely on the spectrum and mostly just talks about herself, and I was so depressed at the time that I barely spoke at all so our dynamic worked and was very easy. I also never really left the house so was always available to her, which also contributed to us getting close. 

Fast forward to this year and B moves in, plus I got a new job at a cafe (my old job was at a library). It’s brought me out of my shell a lot and B works at a beauty parlor near the cafe, and does similar hours to me, so we started driving to work together sometimes, or driving home together, or just generally spending more time together. We have asked A if she wants to join, but our plans are mostly spur of the moment and A prefers to plan her schedule in a more rigid way (to each their own). I would say that B is my best friend at this point in time, despite having known her for less time than A.

A and I began to drift apart throughout the first semester, which I noticed, but it didn’t bother me so much as I had begun making lots of new friends, going to therapy, and just generally spending less time rotting in bed. A also started belittling me somewhat for my habits and choices, her making fun of me used to be kind of a funny bit in our relationship but it started feeling more harsh as the semester wore on. I admit that I didn’t reach out to her much to hang out throughout the semester, but I chalked it up to us both being super busy with full time jobs plus college classes. I would say without a doubt I was a pretty bad friend in that way. I saw her in passing at our shared house but we only made official plans once or twice. She asked me in December to tell her every time I’m at work or hanging out with friends near the cafe, to which I initially responded yes but ended up deciding that was an unfair ask. We had a conversation at the new year when she asked me not to talk about my problems any more, and I simply told her that was fine and stopped speaking to her entirely (yes I know that was childish and I shouldn’t have done it).

This all culminated in a conversation where she asked me why I wasn’t speaking to her, and I explained I was tired of this dynamic and wanted space from her. She warned me that if I took space she might not be there when I’m over it, and I told her I didn’t really see our relationship recovering from this semester, that I like us as roommates and am happy to be living with her, but I don’t really see us being friends. 

I feel confident in my decision, and the more reflection I’ve done on the whole situation the more I think we weren’t good for each other and probably trauma bonded during tough times. However my parents think I should try to repair the relationship as I have known her for a long time, and they think I’m being stubborn and unfair over “nothing”. They told me I should try to get coffee or something with her once a week or so to keep the peace, while I’m more of the mindset that at the ripe old age of 23 and in college I shouldn’t be hanging out with people out of obligation that I don’t really enjoy being with.

One last note- when I first moved in/met A, I was extremely overweight in addition to the depression. In the time I’ve known her, and mostly just this past semester, I’ve lost 70+ lbs. She doesn’t strike me as someone who really cares about that stuff too much, but I do see a lot of stuff online about weight loss affecting friendships. 

If you made it through that thank you so much for reading- what do you think? I know I wasn’t a great friend throughout the semester but do you think I’m valid in not wanting to rekindle the friendship? Or should I try to smooth things out and see what happens then?

any player that did not pick accessories or items will be in a regular squid game tracksuit with their number.

You must respond to every post, every post you do not respond you will be warned.

you can also be affected by things such as your items and other walkers. 

I will update the status of a player with each post, 

example: u/toastwutinc  1 warning ⚠️  still slowing.

or something along those lines

killing walkers directly is not allowed 🚫 

you can guide sleeping walkers off the road and lead  players to fake attacks and whatnot

no running off the road, I will randomly select if you make it.

you have to discuss rebellion plans in the comments. 

depending on how many comments you make about it and how many people you recruit the chance of a soldier catching on increases, to attack, simply say ""I attack the guards""  or anything along those lines will work. I will then use a randomiser to see if it works.

canteens are infinite but rations are not, you will be supplied every day.

I suggest if you haven't seen the long walk to watch it so you understand the game better.

respond within 1 day or you will be given your first warning. ",3,1768519820.0,PlaySquidGame,13,0.81,False

It seems like nowadays, my father based anything that I do, even the way I dress now on my autism.","About 5 years back, he wasn't really bad about this. For the longest time, he was even convinced that I didn't really have autism like how he does now. He went far as not even really telling people that I had it back then. I have been with him for 15 years. I don't know what changed his mind into thinking that I'm autistic now. When we moved into our new house last year, the first thing he told the council and our neighbors was that I was autistic right off the bat without asking me. I used to dress girly in my teens and early 20s, but once I hit my middle 20s, I got into wanting to wear looser clothing and even look more tomboyish and masculine. He even bases that on me being autistic too now because many people with autism hate tight clothing. I started to get irregular menstrual cycles that got bad, even mentally in my upper 20s, there was times I was having my period once every 2 weeks and ended up having to be put on trazodone for it because it started to cause anxiety. Dad thinks the reason why my hormones bother me so bad is being autistic and my trazodone helps level out my autism when I'm on my period. I think it's more hormonal than autism. There's women who aren't on the spectrum and have way worse hormonal problems than what i have, including my sister and aunt. One time, he even said that I have addictive personality disorder because of how much tea and coffee i drink, then another time we were talking about me being autistic, he actually said that I should love that I'm autistic and I wouldn't turnout how i am now if i wasn't autistic and I wouldn't draw the way that I do which is something that dad would've never told me before.

I foolishly don’t even drink coffee drinks but was obsessed with the Refreshers, sometimes even purchasing 2 venti’s a day. I held every coffee meeting I had for work at my local cafe for almost 5 years. I would easily spend $300-$500 a month, reloading my app without even thinking about the $25 every time. 

Then about 6 months ago I joined this subreddit to learn about secret menus, drink reviews etc. However what I found was daily stories about how terrible this company treats its employees and since then I refuse to support them with my business. I also won’t shut up about how terrible this company is to anyone and everyone in my life.

I’m someone who keeps life pretty simple and prefers depth over noise. I’m not the loudest person in the room and I’m completely fine with that. I warm up best in one on one conversations where there’s room to actually think, joke, and be yourself without performing.

My schedule isn’t the typical nine to five, which can be unpredictable but also means I’m around at odd hours and down for spontaneous conversations. When the seasons are warmer, I spend as much time as I can outside exploring trails, paddling on the water, camping, or just enjoying fresh air. Colder months usually mean slowing things down with a book, a solid cup of coffee, a good series, and calm nights in.

I’m not chasing intensity or expectations. I’m here for easy conversations, shared humor, thoughtful exchanges, and the kind of connection that develops naturally. Friendship is the goal, and if it becomes something ongoing, even better.

If you appreciate quiet personalities, meaningful conversations, and someone who’s comfortable with both talking and silence, feel free to reach out.",1,1768518858.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,1.0,False
1qdz4ys,https://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/1qdz4ys/commission_familyrealtors/,Commission - Family/Realtors,"Hey,

For realtors out there. When selling a property for a family member. A property that is co-owned by the realtor and 2 other family members is it normal for the realtor to expect full commission.

For more context - the property was not listed. No write up or pictures taken, no inspection , no cleaning etc...the buyer has been wanting to buy the property for years. So he was called and voila a deal made in 2 days.

No commission was discussed with the family. The easiest sale ever happened over one call and a cup of coffee an hour later. 

Paperwork comes in 2 days later and they took off 1% off their regular rate. No discussion with family. Neither of us knew it was coming but did not expect them to do this for nothing. And this was on a property we were gifted prior to our parents passing. They end up getting $13k commission on top of the sale of the property.

What do realtors and those who sold a property in my situation think. We should have obviously got this figured out beforehand but that ship has sailed. ",3,1768518832.0,RealEstate,28,0.8,False
1qdz4sg,https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/1qdz4sg/roommate_obsessively_tries_to_convert_me_to/,Roommate obsessively tries to convert me to Mormonism,"A little context, we are related but never grew up together and didn't meet each other until recently. I go to university in Utah and we share a room and it's a bunch of college guys sharing an apartment together. I am part of another church (Catholic church) but I am respectful towards other people even if I disagree. The very first night, he asked if I was a member of their church, and I said no, and he started bearing testimony about his church. The second day, he asked me if I prayed about the book of Mormon yet. He always tells me I need to ""read the Book of Mormon"" and ""all my questions"" will be answered, but I never have any questions. I did tell him I disagreed and why, but he had to really get that information out of me. I always try to change the subject. 

Also, on the very first day I moved in, I bought a coffee maker. He told me that I should go on a coffee fast, when I asked him why, he said because it's addictive and goes against the word of wisdom but he already knew I wasn't a member. He judges me if I have the tiniest little thing of rum (I don't even really drink, I used the tiniest bit in a crockpot apple sauce thing). He judged me for having like one drink at the Mexican restaurant restaurant because ""our body is a temple"" as if he never has fast food or anything bad for you once in a while. By the way, that's the extent of my drinking; I've never even been drunk in my life. If I brew the coffee pot in the morning he will get silent and leave the room. He also tells me not to drink coke zeroes because aspartame is bad for you. Do you know who else tells me that? My parents - and do I listen? No. So why should I listen to someone two years younger than me.w

He gets mad at me if I watch George Lopez. I just watched it in the background while I did my homework and couldn't tell it bothered him. I do realize I should have been a little more perceptive but I couldn't tell! Ive been very upfront with him I don't necessarily take hints well and if he has a problem, please just tell me. I've since put in earbuds but he still tries to tell me I shouldn't watch it because it's too sexual and crass and not ""of the spirit"". He also tries to get me from watching those police cam videos of the same reason. I dislocated my knee last semester and did rehab in the living room and he put on their presidents funeral on the TV. Or he'll put on their general conference and then later on quiz me about it. I won't tell him he can't watch it but I wasn't paying attention. He then made a comment about how just because I'm not part of their church doesn't mean I have to ""hate"" members. That finally made me snap and I said ""Bullshit! I have NEVER said I hate anybody, or alluded to it! Do not put words in my mouth."" I can't cuss at all in front of him or he'll get pissed and silent. I don't think I'm that vulgar honestly. I can't even use the word ""ass"" or ""pissed"" or anything like that or he'll get offended.

He's walked in on me changing in our room after the shower or sometimes I will just walk right from our bathroom door to our bedroom. He has lectured me on modesty and how our bodies are a temple and people being naked in front of each other is like pornography and how Satan destroys families. I don't just hang out naked by the way but I don't think it's weird to change in front of someone your age of the same sex. I made a joke about a nude beach and he told me ""I promise, if you go to one of those beaches, you will ruin your life.""

I have said some things about religion but I don't think any of it was not promoted by him. I asked to drop the subject but every single thing you can think of to talk about, he will revert to the subject of religion. He randomly starts preaching about stories from the BOM out of nowhere and tells me things like ""I promise if you read the book of Mormon you will believe."" And little digs like ""I guess it's fine if you want to be Catholic, but it's not gonna bring you closer to God."" He constantly invites me to religious themed events like choir and church and so on after I have asked him to stop multiple times and then says things like ""I just thought I'd ask"". One time I dared to get frustrated openly in front of him and he told me ""Did you know contention is of the devil?""

He challenges all of our RM roommates to see who can be more ""religious"" like bragging about listening to Gen conference while at the gym. Or sugar fast. And do you wanna know what? Just the other day I had missionaries come to my door, whom I've never met, who asked for me by name, religious affiliation, and claimed I had ""questions"" about their faith. I have never once inquired about their faith. He randomly has started talking to me about his temple garments and explaining what ""covenant"" means and used that as an excuse to preach from the BOM. Or explain Barney style what priesthood means. I mean, even if you don't know the intricate details of catholicism, do you really think someone part of that faith is not going to know what that means? He has also told me out of the blue he never has masturbated before, which somehow I doubt.

He has also, while I was on the desk I'm between our beds, kept going on about the great apostasy (other things too I don't remember). He went over it multiple times and I asked to drop it, he put on a Mormon YT video of some guy talking about it right next to me while I did homework. Or has literally came up to me while doing HW and shoved the book of Mormon in my face and said ""put aside all your doubts and read it!"" Or has harangued me until 1 am about theology. I try not to even talk about theology anymore! I've never brought it up to him, either. I just try to agree to disagree and move on. I am religious too but would never talk down on someone like that who doesn't agree. I am very non confrontational and don't want to get physical, but I have probably about 60 lbs on him and literally tower over him. I've done Jou Jitsu in the past too and wrestled some in HS. Our apartment managers go to church with him too so I doubt if they'd help.

1qdz3yh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxietyhelp/comments/1qdz3yh/help/,Help,"Hi guys, hope you’re all doing well. I guess I’d consider myself someone who is generally high functioning while living with anxiety and depression, although there are times when I don’t feel very high functioning at all.
About a year and a half ago, I was working three jobs when I found out I had thyroid cancer. From that point on, things really took a turn. One by one, I had to step away from my jobs until I was left with just one part-time position. In some ways, the last year and a half has been more peaceful because I was not constantly focused on work. At the same time, it has not been peaceful at all. I ended up having four surgeries, all different and affecting different parts of my body, along with radiation. Since then, I have been dealing with ongoing fatigue, and I am not sure if my medication is fully working for my body. Physically, I am exhausted most of the time, and that has been really stressful because I know I am capable of more, but my body just cannot be pushed the way it used to.

As I have started easing back into work, I have gone through a big transition. I was previously working as a therapist, which was emotionally and physically demanding, and now I am a part-time professor at two universities. On top of that, because of how I was treated by companies due to my unexpected health issues, I decided to open my own private practice. That has been going fairly well so far, but I am still in the early stages. I am moving from a period where life felt more relaxed and lower responsibility into one where I suddenly have a lot on my plate, and I am struggling to figure out how to juggle it all.

I know this kind of transition is common, but it feels significantly heavier for me right now. I also recently found out I have an autoimmune condition, which led to one of my surgeries. I am almost a week post-op from my most recent surgery, still healing and recovering, and the idea of going back to work honestly scares me a bit. I know that in your thirties there is this expectation to get back to normal and keep moving forward, but my anxiety has been through the roof. There has been so much change, and I am someone who really needs a sense of control. Over the last year and a half, I have felt like I have had absolutely none, physically or mentally.

I know I likely need to be on medication, but my health insurance changed with the new year, and right now I am unable to see a provider for my anxiety. My heart is constantly pounding, I sometimes get the shakes, and I will probably have to wait until February to get any kind of medication. I have tried guided meditations, frequency videos on YouTube, and cutting out coffee, but without caffeine I feel extremely tired.

I am just wondering what has actually worked for other people. Is exercise helpful? I know I need to move more and go on walks, but my energy feels so limited right now. If anyone is willing to share what helps when the heart-pounding anxiety starts, I would really appreciate it, because I am honestly struggling.

First off, sorry for the junk and writing, I drank a ton of coffee. Also, if you think you recognize me, please ignore this.

**Background**: Going into college, I didn't know if I wanted to do PhD or MD. I worked at a lab for a few years (LOVED the research and had a blast!), but ultimately decided on MD. It was an engineering lab that made platforms for cancer and tested immunotherapies on them. I am not an engineer (am biochem and bio double major), so I did more of the bio side. 

**My work:** I LOVE immunotherapies and worked with 3D platforms to see the immune system-tumor interactions. I ended up leading a project with TILs that was super cool, plus I felt very independent which was nice. I loved my lab. I do not know how to code.

**Reasons to do MD and not PhD**: saw too much dissertation depression, felt weird abt writing a dissertation before working years in a field and knowing what actual problems were and doing a meaningful dissertation (did not want to do a dissertation just to do a dissertation), saw depressing isolated labs with no support, wanted to work with humans and human tissues which is easier to do as an MD, post-docs encouraged MD for job security (time has proven them correct), worked with MDs doing research which showed me it was def feasible, wanted to learn a lot more overall about human body and loved my histology and physiology classes

**MD-PhD?**: My PI, however, encouraged me to do MD-PhD. His reasoning was that PhDs don't respect MDs and MDs don't respect PhDs, and he said unfortunately, the world is shifting to titles. I understood but thought this reason was too weak to devote so many years of my life to. I also want kids, and am a woman, so there is a clock there. 

**Stats:** Graduated in May 2025 in chem with biochem focus and bio. 

* Latina white woman (speak portuguese fluently, first in family born in USA, my spanish is mid)
* Residency: california and florida (FL has loophole if you live OOS for just a year before matriculation)
* MCAT: 520 
* sGPA: 3.63; cGPA: 3.61. I got Cs in multiple classes, most of which I had zero interest in or felt I was not learning anything. I got better at managing this by my senior year. 
* Clinical: 410 hrs (MA for disadvantaged). 
* Shadowing: 40ish hrs(25 are virtual). 
* Research: 1900 hrs (2 labs, one was full-time summer internship, some of it was paid)
* Pubs: 2 in 2023; 8th author lower impact (10ish citations each)
* Service: 250 hrs (homeless) 2 8th author pubs lower impact in 2023 (10ish citations each)
* D1 athletics: 1700 hrs; walk-on to track and cross country team but I quit right before my sophomore spring semester. 
* Leadership: 600 hrs leading BJJ club
* Wrestling: 320 hrs getting beat up in wrestling club
* Work: 300 hrs working as standardized patient
* Rec letters: Got 2 super good rec letters from the lab I worked at, and I also got 2 rec letters from professors but I have no clue what those are like (asked for them late so they may hate me). 
* Essays: I think they are good? Research focus and underserved populations focus

**Fucked up:** My parents moved to the bay area, so after I graduated, they decided I was moving in with them (culture). I was supposed to start a CRC job immediately but there were funding cuts so it was delayed SIX months. In those six months, I procrastinated heavily on my MD applications. Most of my secondaries were submitted pretty much at the deadline (24 total, I missed 13 deadlines). Yes, I know this is really bad. I think I was depressed and feeling without purpose and still am a little. I am trying to fix my life now. I currently have the CRC job at a T5 university but it's not a lot of work and mostly remote. I do the standardized patient job there too. Unfortunately I did not submit the secondary for this uni. 

**Cycle:** I applied super late (submitted secondaries on their deadline). From the 24 that I applied to, I have 5 rejections and 0 interview invites. 

**An actual question:** I spoke to some MD-PhDs who are not depressed and I am being swayed to apply MD-PhD next cycle (or transfer in if I miraculously get into an MD school this cycle). This gap year has made me realize how much I am missing doing research. I am applying to lab jobs at unis in the bay area but zero responses; I will apply more (yo hmu if you need someone pls). My GPA is low, but could I have a shot at getting in? Which tier of schools? Does anyone have any life advice or anything? No one in my family is in healthcare nor in academia so I feel very alone.

1qdz0rr,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1qdz0rr/i_37f_spent_five_years_with_my_boyfriend_33m_and/,I (37F) spent five years with my boyfriend (33M) and he ghosted me,"I’m  (37F) struggling with a breakup (33M)  and looking for outside perspective because part of me feels more aware and another part feels shattered.

I was in a relationship for five years with someone I love deeply. He wasn’t cruel. He wasn’t lazy. He did a lot for me -practically, materially, consistently. And that’s what makes this so confusing and painful.

Because the problem wasn’t a lack of effort.

It was what the effort replaced.

He showed love by doing things. Fixing things. Helping with errands. Planning trips. Showing up physically. From the outside, it probably looked like a solid, functional relationship. And in many ways, it was.

But over time, I realized that the “doing” often stood in for emotional connection - and when I tried to reach for depth, there was nothing there to meet me.

We went on around 20 vacations. He planned some of them. We had fun. We laughed. We shared experiences. I don’t deny any of that.

But day-to-day, I carried most of the emotional and relational labor. I cooked, cleaned, managed routines, reminded him to do dishes, made coffee in the mornings. If things weren’t done, I just did them. Slowly, I felt more like a caretaker than a partner.

What really hurt wasn’t that he didn’t talk -it was what he talked about and what he avoided.

He loved talking about video games, movies, events, costumes, Renaissance fairs. He could go on for hours about those things. I enjoyed them too, to a point.

But when I tried to talk about things that mattered to me -finances, long-term planning, emotional growth, health, spirituality -he disengaged. It was like switching languages.

One night I talked about my dad and a belief I had about him after he passed. I shared something vulnerable and spiritual. He said nothing. No curiosity. No response. The conversation just… died.

Another example that still sticks with me: I’d cook dinner, sit down, and he’d immediately ask, “Do you want to watch TV?” I didn’t want to watch TV. I wanted to talk. I wanted presence. I wanted connection.

A few times I said, “No, let’s eat and talk.”

He’d look at me and ask, genuinely confused, “What do you want to talk about?”

That question broke my heart more than he probably realized.

Over time, I started to feel like emotional intimacy wasn’t something he accessed -only activity, distraction, or logistics.

Marriage and kids magnified this gap.

At first, I wasn’t sure about kids. Over time, I changed. I imagined a future with him. I told him I could see us having a child together. I even told him how adorable I thought our child would be -he has thick curly hair, and I loved imagining that future.

I wanted marriage. I was clear about that.

But while he said he wanted those things too, I was the one pushing conversations forward. Researching venues. Initiating timelines. Asking what he needed to feel ready.

There was never a clear answer.

When I asked if something was wrong, he always said no -even when it was obvious something was wrong. He didn’t talk through discomfort. He withdrew until everything collapsed.

The first breakup happened on the day my dog died.

I was devastated. That same day, he quietly packed his belongings into his car. I only realized when I saw everything in the backseat. He said he didn’t mean for me to see.

I ended up apologizing. We got back together. I promised I’d change.

But nothing fundamental changed on his end.

This last breakup wasn’t even direct. He didn’t sit me down. He didn’t explain his feelings. He stopped talking to me. Silent withdrawal. I had to ask what was happening just to get clarity.

Even after that, boundaries stayed blurry. He still answered calls. We talked for 15 minutes. He checked in about logistics. He said things like, “I know I’m probably the last person you want to hear from,” which felt like he wanted reassurance without accountability.

When I tried to talk about the relationship, he framed himself as the one who was hurt -and blamed me entirely. There was no acknowledgment of his emotional avoidance, only a narrative where he had no role in the breakdown.

After the breakup, he suddenly went back to the gym. Started “working on himself.” But never with me. Never when I was asking us to work through things together.

I’m left grieving not just the relationship, but the realization that love, effort, and time don’t create emotional intimacy if someone doesn’t know how to be present.

I miss him. I don’t want to be alone. But I also don’t want a relationship where emotional depth is replaced with distractions, logistics, or silence.

I keep asking myself: did I ask for too much?

Or did I stay too long hoping someone would meet me at a depth they couldn’t access?

I wasn’t asking for perfection. I was asking for conversation. Presence. Emotional honesty -especially when things were hard.

If anyone has been through something like this, I’d really appreciate your perspective. I’m trying to understand what happened and really appreciate the full picture. ",0,1768518557.0,relationship_advice,12,0.5,False

(ADHD DIAGNOSIS IN 2019 )

I went 3 months no stims and no before I tried to go back to my place of work to a 3 day a week job. After the first hour I had already drunk 6 coffees and was already trying to find a way to get back on stims. I quit after 3 days. 

I was 6 months no stims but got back on them 2 times in the last month and have felt nothing but horrible, stressed and wanting to use more than prescribed which is why I can never use them again said my doctor and I agree. 

I'm just about to move and start a new fulltime job as a maintenance man on a non stimulant and I start in 2 weeks. 

I'm so scared that I won't be able to cope and end up relapsing. What can I do to help enjoy / see myself prospering. 

I am sorry for the long paragraph its just im so lost and i just want to be the best person i can be for myself and my beautiful wife xxx
