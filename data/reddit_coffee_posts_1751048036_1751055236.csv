1lm3s56,https://i.redd.it/qyov1z8j1j9f1.jpeg,"$ATYR ‚Äì Russell Rebalance: Massive Auction, Massive Implications","Hi folks,

Absolutely massive close for $ATYR today‚Äî**over 12 million shares traded in the final auction at $5.03.** That‚Äôs more than six times the average daily volume and represents a tidal wave of forced demand from index funds, ETFs, and possibly short covering. This is by far the largest single-day volume event in the stock‚Äôs recent history.

**What does it mean?**  
The sheer size of the closing auction shows how much institutional buying was required to match the new Russell 2000/3000 weights. These shares were bought by passive funds‚Äîindexers who typically ‚Äúbuy and hold‚Äù for the long term. Once these shares are in index portfolios, they‚Äôre usually locked away and *not* actively traded, which means the *effective* float in the open market just got even tighter.

So, while the auction didn‚Äôt trigger a huge closing price spike (supply met demand at $5.03), it did result in a massive transfer of shares from traders and arbs to index funds. Over the coming weeks and months, this could have a real impact on liquidity: with so many shares now sitting in passive funds, there‚Äôs even less available for shorts to borrow or for active trading. In other words, this takes a big chunk of float ‚Äúoff the market‚Äù‚Äîand could make future moves even more volatile if real demand resurfaces.

Today‚Äôs action is a textbook example of how structural market mechanics, not just fundamentals, can reshape a stock‚Äôs trading profile in a single session.

Your feedback is greatly appreciated, and I have logged it under reference (blank) and with our Vitality Programme team that has been developing it for the past years.
 
We are sorry to hear you are disappointed and feeling like you are getting less rewards. Our aim is to increase engagement with the Vitality Programme whilst adding a fun and interactive element to it.
I just wanted to clarify that we have retained all the same partners for the same amount of activity points (12 per week) to ensure you still have access to your favourites, plus, we've introduced an option for 50% cinema weekly, as well as several new monthly partners. Only difference now is that you need to pick which reward you‚Äôd like for the week ahead and depending on your schedule/plans you may prefer a discounted cinema voucher one week and then pick the coffee voucher the week after. The full free cinema voucher is also still available to be picked as the monthly reward at end of the month if you earn 12 points each week. We have removed the Rakuten voucher from weekly rewards based on feedback we received from our members and the significant decrease in popularity. We have however retained this as a monthly reward for our members who still enjoy those vouchers.
At the end of the month, you have the opportunity to pick your monthly reward which is dependent on the amount of Stanleys you may find in the weeks before.  If you decide not to play for Stanleys, you will be given one automatically every week so you can still play for the monthly reward at the end of the month which you‚Äôd already be familiar with (cinema full price ticket voucher, Rakuten voucher, etc). If you wish to play for more Stanleys, you may earn the chance to select different or more rewards such as an Amazon voucher or discount with Merlin entertainment. Again, if you do not wish to play for more Stanleys, that is entirely up to you. Furthermore, you continue to get your points for your activity whether you decide to claim your rewards or not.
 
Remember that, same as before, the more points you earn the better discount you will get with our partners such as Expedia and Mr and Mrs Smith and you can improve your Vitality Status. Rewards such as Apple Watch, Mindful chef, Headspace, SportsShoes discount etc. have not changed. We have also recently added a new reward that is not dependent on points ‚Äì the Gymshark discount. Deliveroo Plus Gold membership is also coming from Monday.
The Stanley game is set up to give everyone a fair chance to find hidden Stanleys. By getting active and playing every week, you increase your likelihood of unlocking these additional rewards.
 
Furthermore, there is no element of gambling involved in Pick & Play. Nothing is wagered with the chance of a return; the Play element is a fun game of chance to give members a way of enhancing their rewards. You will still get your free weekly Stanley whether you decide to play for more or not and you will be able to have access to the same monthly rewards if you don‚Äôt play for more Stanleys.
 
We truly appreciate your feedback, and it has been logged for future consideration when the team looks into revising the programme again. Whilst we appreciate that you are generally unhappy with these changes, the Pick & Play is not set to fundamentally change.
 
At the moment, the team is focused on delivering the best experience with this current system and preparing to launch new rewards soon.
If there is anything else we can assist with, please do not hesitate to contact us.",2,1751054916.0,Vitalityhealth,1,1.0,False

## Key Features analysis

The selection of granite countertops substantially impacts the overall look and feel of your kitchen or bathroom. Grey granite provides a neutral, yet elegant, base that can complement various cabinet colors, flooring options, and backsplash designs.

**Color Consistency:**

The best grey granite colors exhibit a harmonious blend of light and dark tones, creating a visually appealing and consistent surface. High-quality slabs minimize drastic color variations, ensuring a cohesive look across the entire countertop. A balance of grey, black, and white flecks adds depth without overwhelming the subtle grey base.

**Durability and Hardness:**

Granite is renowned for its extraordinary durability and resistance to scratches, heat, and stains. The ideal grey granite features a high mineral density, making it impervious to everyday wear and tear. The Mohs hardness scale rating should be around 6-7, indicating superior resistance to abrasion and chipping.

**Veining and Pattern Variation:**

The veining patterns in grey granite add character and visual interest. Some slabs feature subtle, flowing veins, while others showcase more pronounced and dramatic patterns. The key is to choose a veining pattern that complements the overall design aesthetic of the kitchen or bathroom. Linear veining creates a more modern and streamlined look, while swirling patterns offer a more conventional and organic feel.

**Sealing and Maintenance:**

Proper sealing is crucial for maintaining the integrity and appearance of grey granite countertops. High-quality granite requires minimal sealing, typically once a year or every other year, depending on usage. The granite should be non-porous to resist staining from common household liquids, such as oil, wine, and coffee.

Key features of the best grey granite countertops include:

* Consistent color palette
* Exceptional durability and hardness
* Unique veining and pattern variations
* Low maintenance sealing requirements

## Core Benefits

Grey granite countertops offer several practical and aesthetic benefits that make them a popular choice among homeowners and designers.

**Versatile Design Compatibility:** The neutral tones of grey granite complement a wide range of cabinet colors, from classic white and warm wood tones to bold blues and vibrant greens. This versatility makes it easy to integrate grey granite into various kitchen and bathroom designs, whether modern, traditional, or transitional. For instance, pairing grey granite with white cabinets creates a clean and timeless look, while combining it with dark wood cabinets adds warmth and sophistication.

**Enhanced Durability and Longevity:** Granite is exceptionally durable and resistant to scratches, heat, and stains, ensuring that grey granite countertops maintain their beauty and functionality for years to come.Unlike other countertop materials, granite can withstand high temperatures without scorching or melting, making it ideal for placing hot pots and pans directly on the surface. Its scratch-resistant properties protect against damage from knives and other sharp objects, preserving its smooth and polished finish.**Increased Home Value:** Investing in grey granite countertops can significantly increase the value of your home. Granite is considered a premium countertop material, and its timeless appeal and durability make it an attractive feature for potential buyers. A well-maintained kitchen or bathroom with grey granite countertops can be a major selling point, adding to the overall market value and appeal of the property.**Easy Maintenance and Cleaning:** Grey granite countertops are relatively easy to maintain with simple,everyday cleaning practices. Regular wiping with a soft cloth and mild detergent is typically sufficient to keep the surface clean and free of stains. The non-porous nature of sealed granite prevents liquids from penetrating the surface, making it resistant to spills and stains.

## FAQs Section

**What are the most popular grey granite colors for kitchen countertops in 2025?**
Some of the most popular grey granite colors for 2025 include Silver Cloud, Steel Grey, Moon White (featuring grey undertones), and Colonial White (also with subtle grey elements). These colors offer a range of grey tones and veining patterns, allowing homeowners to choose the perfect option for their specific design preferences.**How frequently enough should grey granite countertops be sealed?**
The frequency of sealing grey granite countertops depends on the type of sealant used and the level of usage. Generally, it's recommended to seal granite countertops once a year or every other year with a high-quality penetrating sealant. A simple water test can definitely help determine if resealing is needed. If water beads up on the surface, the sealant is still effective. If the water absorbs into the granite, it's time to reseal.

**Are grey granite countertops susceptible to staining?**
While grey granite is generally resistant to staining, it's vital to seal the surface properly to prevent liquids from penetrating the pores. Dark-colored liquids, such as wine, coffee, and oil, can perhaps stain unsealed granite if left on the surface for an extended period. Wiping up spills promptly and resealing the countertops regularly will help protect against staining and maintain their pristine appearance.

**What is the average cost of grey granite countertops?**
The cost of grey granite countertops can vary depending on the grade of granite, the complexity of the installation, and the location. Generally, grey granite falls within the mid-range price category, making it an affordable option for homeowners seeking a premium countertop material. The total cost typically includes the price of the granite slab, fabrication, installation, and sealing.

It would mean a lot if you could listen to the whole thing, but hey, no pressure if you can‚Äôt!

""Emotional Affair Confession: When Temptation Hits But Love Fights Back .Whispers of Temptation  It was a Tuesday evening in April when Claudia Braxton found herself standing in front of her bathroom mirror, rehearsing a confession she never thought she would have to make. At twenty-nine, life had settled into a rhythm that felt comfortable, albeit stifling. A successful marketing executive in the bustling heart of San Francisco, she prided herself on her ambitious spirit and the way she navigated the professional landscape. Yet, there was an unsettling truth nestled beneath her polished exterior she was emotionally unfaithful to the one person who mattered most, her husband, Mike.  Claudia had met Mike during their freshman year at university. He was charismatic, with a smile that could warm even the coldest of hearts. They fell in love in that whirlwind way that young adults do, but unlike some of their peers, they had made it past the graduation stage and settled into a long-term commitment. It hadn‚Äôt always been easy the stress of work, financial burdens, and monotony could sour any relationship but Claudia had always considered love to be a choice, an effort made through conscious decisions. Yet, that choice felt more like an obligation now.  Her thoughts drifted to Tyler, the charming coworker who had slid into her life nearly six months ago. At first, it had been innocent a few laughs shared over coffee breaks, discussions on projects that kept them glued to their desks late into the evening. He was a snappy dresser and had an easy charisma that made Claudia feel seen, appreciated. Soon, what began as rapport snowballed into emotional fireworks flirty exchanges that caught both of their breaths and nights spent texting long after the sun slipped beyond the horizon. She felt alive again, in a way she hadn‚Äôt in years.  ‚ÄúClaudia, you okay?‚Äù Mike‚Äôs voice cut through her reverie as he entered the bathroom, the warmth radiating from his strong presence. He had always been observant, sensing the subtle shifts in her demeanor.  ‚ÄúYeah, just... thinking about work,‚Äù she replied, forcing a smile that felt brittle upon her lips. The guilt pooled in her stomach, heavy and throbbing, but she pushed it aside. How could she explain to him that her heart was pulling towards someone else while she stood there, a married woman with vows tucked away in the corners of her mind?  ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt work too late tonight,‚Äù he said, leaning against the doorframe, a hint of concern clouding his eyes. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre pushing yourself too hard.‚Äù Claudia felt a flicker of something a combination of guilt and affection as Mike‚Äôs words hung in the thick air of their bathroom.  ‚ÄúPromise,‚Äù she murmured, rushing to wash her hands, to mask the tremor in her heart. They exchanged small talk as usual; his concern was genuine, considerate, and yet stirring, stirring all the emotions she tried to suppress. She would make dinner his favorite, spaghetti with meatballs before heading back to her laptop.  As she cooked, the vibrant scents filled their modest apartment. Yet, her mind roamed miles away, thinking of Tyler‚Äôs mischievous grin and the playful banter that ignited her spirit. It was the feeling of lust no, it was more than that it was the thrill of temptation, of connection that transcended the platonic, that left her aching for something beyond the comfortable domesticity that her relationship with Mike had become. They had their good moments, their shared laughter and warmth, but the spark Claudia once felt for Mike was fading, nearly extinguished.  Dinner passed in the familiar rhythm of clinking forks and playful jabs, the conversation cheerful but lacking depth. Claudia nodded at Mike‚Äôs recount of his day, but inside, her heart was tangled in shadows, whispering secrets about the flirtations of her secret world with Tyler.  Later that night, curled under the sheets, Claudia tossed and turned as her mind played tricks on her. Questions whirled around like leaves in a storm: Was she being unfair to Mike? Did a mere friendship with Tyler cross some unwritten line? The line was blurry, fading like an old photograph. Shivering under the weight of her choices, the images of stolen glances, the teasing, and the emotional resonance she shared with Tyler flooded her mind suffocating joy mixed with insistent guilt.  The next day, her phone buzzed, and she instinctively grabbed it, hoping for a message from Tyler. It was one of those ordinary days, with sun pouring into her office, but her heart raced with the thrill of seeing a meme he had sent. The caption read: ‚ÄúWhen you find someone who gets you, hold on tight.‚Äù It tugged at her, feeling personal in a way she had longed for and feared.  ‚ÄúCute,‚Äù she replied, her fingers trembling over the keyboard.  Their exchanges became our own equilibrium, a dance of flirty banter that drew Claudia deeper into a rabbit hole, entangled in a fantasy. Amid the routine staff meetings and coffee breaks, her mind clung to the enticing ideas of escapades and possibilities. Tyler was there, unconsciously stepping into the cracks that were forming between her and Mike.  But on one particularly lonely night, Claudia found herself seated at the bar of their favorite wine joint, a place where she and Mike often shared hours of laughter and connections. Tonight, however, she sat with Tyler beside her his presence luminous, intoxicating, and undoubtedly electrifying. The wine flowed freely, and with every clink of glasses, each laugh shared sliced deeper into her conscience.  ‚ÄúDo you ever wonder what it would be like if we weren‚Äôt who we are right now?‚Äù Tyler asked, leaning closer, his voice a soft whisper weaving through the noise of the bar. ‚ÄúIf we were free to just... be with each other?‚Äù  Every fiber of Claudia‚Äôs being cried out against the words, but her heart pounded in exhilaration, caught in the thrill of what if. The tension hung between them like a heavy mist, tempting, seductive.  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, Tyler.‚Äù She laughed lightly, but even to her own ears, it sounded strained. ‚ÄúWe shouldn‚Äôt be talking about this.‚Äù  ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs to say what‚Äôs right or wrong?‚Äù He leaned in even closer, their breaths mingling. She could see a spark in his eyes, the promise of adventure against the backdrop of reality that felt infinitely chaseable.  Claudia‚Äôs heart raced, emotions crashing through her like a tide. Everything felt wrong and yet so right. The allure of Tyler‚Äôs closeness was intoxicating. For a brief moment, she toyed with the thought of leaning in, of crossing that final line, but just as quickly, guilt flooded her images of Mike‚Äôs kind smile, his steadfast love filled her head, anchoring her soul back to where it belonged.  Whether it was intuition or the magic of the moment, Claudia chose to pull away. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt,‚Äù she murmured, breaking the spell that was wrapping tighter and tighter around them. ‚ÄúI have to go.‚Äù  The ride home was excruciatingly quiet, her heart heavy with the weight of confusion and desire. She almost texted Tyler, thinking about that incomprehensible bond they had forged, but something in her gut stopped her. Instead, she tossed her phone onto the living room table.  Mike was already asleep when she got home, peaceful and unaware of the storms brewing in her heart. She lay in bed beside him, heart racing, staring up at the darkened ceiling, wrestling with emotions that felt like they would consume her whole.  Days turned into weeks, a cycle of introspection that plagued her every waking moment. The connection with Tyler lingered, always a whisper in the back of her mind, challenging her resolve. It was tempting, intoxicating. Yet with every encounter, every shared laugh with Mike, the realization crashed against her like waves eroding a shoreline emotional cheating was a thread that could unravel the very fabric of love.  Eventually, Claudia knew she had to confront her truth. Maybe it was out of guilt or the realization of the love she felt for Mike that finally brought her to that fateful decision. They needed to talk, to delve into the valley of emotions that they had both tiptoed around for so long.  Sitting at the kitchen table over coffee one Sunday morning, sunlight streaming through the windows, she finally shared her unease. ‚ÄúMike, can we talk?‚Äù she started, her heart thudding wildly against her ribcage, echoing the weight of her words.  ‚ÄúOf course. What‚Äôs on your mind?‚Äù he asked, a flicker of concern crossing his face.  Claudia took a deep breath, choosing her words carefully. ‚ÄúI think we‚Äôve been... drifting apart, you know? And I‚Äôve felt... I‚Äôve felt tempted in ways that I know I shouldn‚Äôt.‚Äù Tears began to blur her vision, and she fought to maintain her composure. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been emotionally vulnerable inappropriately so with someone else. It scares me because I love you, Mike.‚Äù  Silence fell like a heavy curtain between them. Mike‚Äôs expression shifted from concern to disbelief, then hurt. ‚ÄúClaudia, how long has this been going on?‚Äù His jaw clenched, and Claudia could feel the room constricting around them.  ‚ÄúMonths,‚Äù she replied, her voice barely above a whisper, each word laced with regret. ‚ÄúBut I never acted on those feelings. I kept it all in my head. But I need you to know, need to be honest with you.‚Äù  ‚ÄúWhat do you want from me, Claudia?‚Äù His voice was gruff, edged with pain.  ‚ÄúI want to fix this,‚Äù she pleaded, holding her breath. ‚ÄúI want to reconnect. I want to remember what made us us.‚Äù  As she spoke, tears dripped down her cheeks. Mike‚Äôs eyes softened, filled with a mix of hurt and the flicker of hope.  ‚ÄúClaudia, this isn‚Äôt easy to hear,‚Äù he said slowly, ‚Äúbut thank you for telling me the truth. Let‚Äôs work through this.‚Äù  It wasn‚Äôt a fix in that moment there were no immediate solutions or neatly tied endings. Instead, it was a bittersweet opening up of an emotional dialogue, a commitment to rediscover each other, to navigate the dark terrain together.  The road ahead would not be simple. They took time to unravel their layers sharing laughs, shedding tears, and cautiously approaching their passion while rebuilding the trust that had been frayed. Claudia learned that the thrill in a relationship stems not from seeking elsewhere but from nurturing the bond they had crafted over nearly a decade. With every truth shared and every fear faced, her heart felt lighter.  She had danced dangerously close to temptation but came away with a greater understanding of love‚Äôs complexities. A reminder that devotion is not just a choice made on clear days but a commitment that flourishes in honest conversations, vulnerability, and the bravery to choose your partner repeatedly.  The whispers of temptation faded into a gentle hum, replaced by the chorus of love, choice, and unwavering connection. And in that discovery, Claudia realized that while the heart might wander, no journey is too long when guided by truth and love.""",1,1751054727.0,stories,0,1.0,False

Serving a life sentence in FKU IK No. 6 UGFSIN of Russia Khabarovsk Krai, Elban settlement, Amursky District, Khabarovsk Krai. 682610.  
  
**Crime scene: FKU IK No. 2 OUHD GUFSIN of Russia Perm Krai, Solikamsk.**  
  
**Dear defense attorney, Demin Yuri Nikolaevich!**  
  
I am reporting the hellish conditions in which I was held in the Federal Penitentiary Institution No. 2 of the Main Directorate of the Federal Penitentiary Service of Russia for the Perm Territory, (AM-244/3-14, VK-240/02-02, UT-389/02-02, Federal Penitentiary Institution OIK-2 IK-2 of the Main Directorate of the Federal Penitentiary Service of Russia for the Perm Territory ‚Äì you see, behind how many numerous names the ‚ÄúWhite Swan‚Äù was hiding, but the essence is one ‚Äì torture and violation of the rights of prisoners.  
  
In fact, from the very arrival at this institution in 2001 until 2004 ‚Äì we were beaten weekly, with a rubber truncheon on the buttocks, when the prisoner was bent at the waist and his head was pressed against the wall, below waist level, his hands were handcuffed, in a position behind his back, tortured up to three times a week, for any invented violation, for example, closed your eyes ‚Äì you are sleeping, spilled water on floor, started cleaning at the wrong time, talking loudly, boxes for two cells, communication between cells....  
  
Until 2006, all movements outside the cell in a bent position, only, according to the decision of the ECHR (Zakharkin v. Russia), was it recognized as a violation of Article 3 of the Convention on Human Rights, and then everyone was given a questionnaire: Is such a position of movement uncomfortable, does it matter, is it humiliating?  
  
Until 2005, they did not feed in the punishment cell, or rather, they gave bread, and three times a day, 3-5 grains of porridge, a fish bone, the convict must wipe it off, from a cup with a piece of bread, say ""Thank you"", and give the dishes. Refusal to accept this food - was considered an illegal hunger strike, there is a violation, and an addition to the punishment cell. Until 2005, in the punishment cell without underwear, only trousers and a jacket, without socks, is not allowed.  
Reason?  
  
You take the elastic out of your underwear and do a loop, unravel socks and weave a rope.... SUICIDE! From bedding, a thin mattress, a window open even in winter, torture through beatings, hunger, cold. For the first time, in 2005, I was allowed to take the Bible, and each shift of controllers were surprised, ""Why can't you sit like this, they stopped beating, they feed you, you sit, read a book."" Until 2005, every time you leave the punishment cell, treatment, blows with a rubber truncheon when you get a mattress, or hand it over in the morning, lights out at 23-00, wake up at 05 00.¬†Every time you go to the bathhouse, they find fault with why there is dust in the cell, and infliction of bodily harm, not only with a rubber truncheon, but also a ""mallet"", a wooden hammer with a wide side, a 1.5 meter long handle on the buttocks, some of the panties burst, it was like a blow to the bottom of a bottle to knock out the cork, and all the organs inside shake, and interrupt the sciatic nerve, the color of the buttock, brown-black blue.  
  
Complaints were not released from the institution, and complainants were beaten, convicted Zakharkin Valery dictated to the lawyer at a meeting, and in 2014 he was sent by stage, transfer to ""Polar Owl"", and there he was killed, on the instructions of the operatives, another convict beat him to death.  
  
Shutov Yuri Titovich (2016) - sent all complaints through a lawyer, did not provide assistance in time, died in the cell - these are those who had defenders, and how many like me, without protection ... Only those who are tired of being afraid, considering themselves dead, there is nothing to fear anymore, stepped over fear and decided not to remain silent anymore, began to appeal to the ECHR, the UN.  
  
  
**PRACTICE OF PRESSURE:**  
They transfer a mentally ill person to a cell, provoking a fight, everything is covered up like this: insults, threats, convicts Pischikov Denis, Aganyan Ashot, defecate in their pants, and rub everything on the walls, urinate in the middle of the cell, and they make claims to me, why is there a stench in the cell, and immediately put me in a punishment cell.  
  
Convict Gvasalia Pavel Yuryevich, former boxer, master of sports of international class, mentally ill at the post office of false accusations, the psyche moved, rushed to fight me when I wrote a letter in 2010, yes, he wrote a statement, transfer, or put someone third, there was no reaction, they expected a conflict, but in the neighboring cell everyone heard, and declared my innocence.¬†In 2014 - after solitary confinement, 14 days, did not say hello when reporting, transferred to cell #31, to a mentally ill person, a recognized pedophile, raped and killed 4 boys, convicted Kolotushkin, and the operatives ordered him to provoke me, he refused, was beaten, and you know, there is no one among us who survived the death sentence, and waited for years for execution, mentally normal, and having overcome fear, decided to remain sane, preserving all human, and I began to seek protection of my rights, and without God's protection, I would have been killed long ago, but I am still alive.......  
  
  
A certified employee, I believe, a maniac, Shvetsov Andrey Sergeevich, and Lieutenant Colonel Savin, they tortured convicts who were handcuffed with particular cruelty. In the period from 2001 to 2004, they recruited people for service like this: (While undergoing training, the convict was taken out of the cell to the security office, for violations committed, for an appointment with an explanatory note, and he was forced to beat the convict, whoever refused was fired, and many were beaten, that is, the management checked the employees for loyalty, so that no one had the desire to report torture in the ""White Swan"".  
  
\]Some officers entering the service, realizing what was happening, that they could not change anything, were transferred to other institutions, and the management raised those employees who were involved in bloodshed, torture, beatings, namely, Andrei Shvetsov, who came as a sergeant in 2001, was already a lieutenant, and in 2013 he became a Lieutenant Colonel, Head of the Security Department.  
  
The convicts were forbidden to laugh, the viewing window opened, they stood facing the wall, the window closed, again we sit down, and then the viewing window opens again, and the laughter immediately passes..... When the shift is handed over to another shift, the employees laugh, today we took 80 explanatory notes, another shift competed to cover their testimony with explanatory notes.  
  
  
And the fact that because of these explanatory notes, on the day of washing, these convicts are beaten, is very pleasing, because they will also beat these maniacs, and at the end of the quarter, for conscientious work, they accrue a bonus, this is how they praised themselves.  
  
  
Of course, not all are like that, there were those who kept silent, not taking part in this, and those who turned away from depression, during such shifts, I rested from repression, but there are only a few of them, and in 2013, when the question of removing the handcuffs arose, many of the old controllers said: (If they remove the handcuffs from them, I will quit), they remembered how they tortured the convicts, and within a month, the entire colony, like a conveyor belt, was put through The Administrative Commission, having put everyone on profuchet without reason (Inclined to attack representatives of the Administration), they remembered that for many years they had tortured convicts.  
  
They even came up with commands, broadcast on the radio (Cemetery, lights out or, Cemetery, rise), and at the entrance to the territory of building No. 3, dormitory No. 9, to the left of the local, a smoking area, stylized as a stop ""Station Lebedinskaya, final"", that is, only further, Cemetery Misharino.  
  
  
All the changes in the penal system were not liked by the captain of the internal service Buksman Robert Viktorovich, who came to the position of Head of the Security Department in 2014.  
Complaints of convicts, Decisions of the ECHR on FKU IK-2, complainants are transferred from the colony:  
Magomedov Akhmed, Vasiliev Vladimir, Zakharkin Valery, all have complaints to the ECHR, they are sent to the settlement of Kharp (Polar Owl), a commission has started to visit the colony more often, even from the ECHR, and the incidence of torture of convicts has decreased, not so aggressively, openly and brazenly.  
  
  
But, weekly, when washing in the shower, the Inspector loudly gives the command to the entire floor, ""Get ready for washing"", after which all convicts, 32 cells on the underground floor, three to a cell, are required to undress to their underwear, wrap up a mattress, and wait their turn from 30 minutes to 3 hours, washing was carried out from 09-00 to 12-00, at any low temperature.  
  
  
The slightest disobedience, or any reason to find fault, and this will be repression against the convicted person, and every search in the cell, the command ""Prepare for a search"" is, strip down to your underwear, wrap up the mattress, and when you approach the door bars on command, put your hands in the feeder, they will put on handcuffs (since October 2020, they will take you out of the cell dressed, except for days when you wash in the shower). After leaving the cell, the convict faces the wall and is searched, while washing in the shower, exactly like this, only in his underwear, also or from the office, and each time the viewing window is opened, the convict is obliged to stand against the opposite wall, raise his hands up (Order of 05/14/2019 No. 312 on FKU OIK - 2 IK No. 2.  
  
  
Walk 2-3 times a week, for the first time in August 2001, on the roof, attic, now these premises have been converted into workshops (sewing production cells), Building No. 3, dormitory No. 9, day and night shift...., only since 2018 the walk has become daily. After they took you into the exercise yard, closed the door, and removed the handcuffs, you stand facing the wall for 15 minutes and wait for the command ""Start walk"", you need to go and ask to do physical exercises, they may not allow it, and at the end of the walk, you stand for 15 minutes.  
  
  
Exercise yards, you saw them, Yuri Nikolaevich, in the photo in the materials of the objections to the ECHR, 2.5 by 3.5 meters in size, three convicts go out, only in 2021 they built 6 large courtyards. Until 2008, when Colonel Vasilenko V.V. became the Chief, everyone in the corridor shouted, insulted convicts.  
  
  
Yes, and what kind of politeness could we talk about, (Article 12 of the Criminal Executive Code of the Russian Federation, paragraph 13, paragraph 2 of the Penal Regulations of the Correctional Institution), if officials do not consider convicts to be people, (You are not a person, but a convict) - such are the realities ...  
  
Sleeping places are wooden bunks in a metal frame.  
In addition, for many years - the beginning of the 2000s, insults towards convicts are the norm of thinking of officials persons, and addressing them as ""You"", but convicts were required to address officials as ""Citizen Chief"", and despite the explanations of the PVR of the penal institution, to address them by position or rank (previously), the Head of the Institution is one, the rest are senior inspector, inspector, citizen captain, but not the chief.¬†Citizen Chief - came from criminal vocabulary, now the PVR of the penal institution requires addressing by name and patronymic, great, but they answer us, (I am not obliged to introduce myself to you), and what ¬†then do, appealed not in the form, violation of the regime of detention - this is the corpus delicti of officials.¬†Toilet cabins were installed since 2017, earlier, brick fence, Joe 2008 on the upper floors, until 2014 in the basement, which are hidden facts of detention in the underground floor, basement, according to the cadastral passport of the building - a requirement to name, the first floor, and since 2022, when everything was revealed in court, they began to indicate, basement false floor. In accordance with the Decree of the Government of the Russian Federation of 2006 No. 47, paragraph 2.23 states, (It is not allowed to place living quarters in the basement and ground floors of buildings, but we were not considered people, we are not people, but non-humans, so we were kept like rats.....  
  
When the viewing window opens and the convict is in the toilet, he must stick out his hand with an open palm and shout ""One in the toilet"", and by order of an official, you must urgently leave the toilet - so we are considered not people, not individuals....  
  
Since 2011, when I was transferred to normal conditions of detention, all weekends and holidays, during the day from 14-00 to 17-00 they showed video films, but since 2013 on New Year's 2014, weekends, only three days, and only red dates, February 23, May 01, May 09, July 12 became days off, turning on the TV during the day on Saturday - cancelled.  
  
TV viewing for those held under strict conditions was reduced to 30 minutes, and only after an appeal to the prosecutor, viewing was increased to 60 minutes.¬†Once a day, in the evening, personal time, under normal conditions 2.5 hours, the formation of the Russian Anthem every morning since 2014. Since 2022, when the PVR of the penal institution was tightened, and all convicts, ignoring Articles 3, 8, 10, 87 of the Criminal Executive Code of the Russian Federation, introduced discrimination and without taking into account differentiation, life-sentenced prisoners decided to be held under disciplinary punishment, as those serving SHIZO, PKT, EPKT, for violations.  
  
\]Tea, coffee, all food products were removed from the cells, issuing them only upon written request, and only three times a day, for 40 minutes, during meals, electric kettles were removed, electric kettles permitted - permitted by the PVR of the penal institution, this is not for you, you are not people to have them, but also it is impossible to have a radio receiver authorized.  
  
The management of the torture institution ""White Swan"" highly appreciates that it violates the norms of constitutional, international law, and reacts aggressively to those who decided to defend their rights, and therefore, immediately make convicts violators, artificially creating violations, transferring them to a cell with the mentally ill, creating the hardships of daily detention, transferring them to a cell with convicts who, on the orders of officials, beat and insult, then, SHIZO.  
  
When taken out for a walk in winter, the convict can only put on mittens in the exercise yard, when the handcuffs are removed, at the end of the walk, you need to remove the mittens, put on ice handcuffs, the temperature is below 30 degrees.  
  
Telephone calls under normal conditions since 2017 - once a month, before 2016 - once a week, and Lieutenant Colonel Robert Viktorovich Buksman declares (Head of the Security Department of the Federal State Institution Correctional Colony No. 2 of the OUHD GUFSIN of Russia Perm edges), ""my employees have already knocked their legs out to take you out"", and the conversation time of 15 minutes goes from the beginning of the set of numbers.  
Officers of the institution, former controllers, brought up on the principles of hatred towards convicts, and in the cells of strict detention since 2020, three searches a week are carried out, when washing in the shower, all things were thrown into a pile, my documents to the prosecutor's office disappeared, until 2017 - bed linen was given for washing once a week, a window measuring 50 by 70 cm, in a concrete wall, and as soon as I sought protection of my rights, there was a reaction ...  
  
Only with the mentally ill I was repeatedly kept (Federchenko A.), 2001-2002, New Year, in a punishment cell - 7 days, Semenov I. - 2003, Melehin S. (2004, 2016), Mychelkin I. (2006) - due to appeals regarding illegal detention, after Mychelkina had already been transferred,  
  
I was illegally locked in a punishment cell for 12 days, Pasaliya P.Yu., (beat me in 2010), Dimasov (2011, 2016), Krapivin G. (2011-2012), was transferred to solitary confinement, went on a hunger strike, Ermilyev V., (they couldn‚Äôt provoke me to fight, they found fault with me for not saying hello) - 14 days in a punishment cell, Vasiliev (2020-2021), Soldatov (2019, 2020, 2021), Galimov F. (2022), Oganyan (2015, 2016) - these are real mentally ill people, and they are documented. Galimov, Aganyan - the consequences of stress, stroke, but the aggression that they turned on me, although I supported them morally, understanding that they were sick, they were turned against me, I'm not even talking about people like Rykhlov, who was several times in strict conditions of detention for 10 years, decided to commit crimes of officials, I think he is mentally ill.  
  
The head of the Federal State Institution IK No. 2 OUHD GUFSIN of Russia Perm Krai, devotes all his time to the work of the sewing production, which he organized, and is in charge of everything Lieutenant Colonel Buksman Robert Viktorovich, under his command both the operational department and the security department. Very cunning and vindictive, smiles, but does things his own way, neither the operatives, no one wants to mess with him, go against him - he is the organizer of the torture of convicts. In the operational department: Nosov, Sultanov, former inspectors, their curator is Buksman R.V., and the Head of the Security Department Lieutenant Colonel Yaburov V.P., and look at the statistics of the ECHR Decision on ""White Swan"", except for Valery Zakharkin, Magomedov, Vasiliev, Yuri Shutov, Shlykov.  
  
The former Minister of Justice of France said: ""Society is assessed by the state of its prison"", either tomorrow's justice or violence takes place in them. In the Russian Federation, the punitive, not the criminal-executive system, officials who are given the authority to manage a correctional institution, use this against convicts based not on the law, but on their desires to torture convicts, and do not want supervising prosecutors to interfere in their affairs. In his work: ""Long Walk to Freedom"" Nelson Mandela writes: ""In reality, no one knows a people until they are in prison, a nation should be judged not by how it treats its most prominent citizens, but by how it treats those at the bottom."" In the Russian Federation, the Constitution of Russia, the norms of international law are proclaimed, but in reality, the by-laws of the PVR of the penal colony and the internal orders of the Federal Penitentiary Service of Russia violate the laws, ignoring the concept of justice.  
  
Each employee of the Federal Penitentiary Service of Russia, the prosecutor's office, conducting inspections, remaining in personal communication with the leadership of the colony, demand a tougher regime, violation of the rights of convicts, additional means of isolation, bars, locks, convicts with life imprisonment in their opinion, animals, and not a person, only when they themselves are held accountable for their crimes, feel the torture of the guards on themselves, and then, if they are officials who stole. They are classified for crimes not theft, but an increase to it, using official position, but embezzlement, negligence, for them and the laws are different, they have nothing to fear.  
  
In relation to those convicted with life imprisonment, pardoned after the death penalty, convicted were subjected to decades of humiliation, then we, in fact, hostages in the Russian Federation before the world community, who never fulfilled the obligations under Protocol No. 6, having refused the convention and all obligations, we, serving life imprisonment, were taken outside the framework of all laws.  
  
After all, we were tried under the Criminal Code, the Criminal Procedure Code of the RSFSR, the composition of the court: a judge, and two people's assessors, in fact alone, which is recognized as unconstitutional, in 1999, and everyone is waiting for them all to die, such is the reality.  
  
All those who raised their voices in our defense have always been discriminated against, killed, intimidated, this is exactly what is happening to you, my defender, Yuri Nikolaevich, and in order to push you away from defending my rights, to embitter you, they use other convicts, whom you tried to defend, everyone has their own level of strength, and someone is crushed by fear.  
  
Only those who are tired of being afraid, who have died, stop being afraid of torture, pressure, and the dead have nothing to fear, and there is discrimination against me in everything, and the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation does not review my sentence, those who have served more than 30 years, and were deprived of the right to serve in the SVO, although those who have serious crimes were called up from prisons to serve - this confirms that I am outside the law. Hence, the content of Chapter 36 of the PVR of the IU (Order No. 110) from 2022 - equalized for life, as those held in SHIZO, PKT, EPKT for violations, but this is temporary, and a life sentence is eternal, where is the law, the constitution, the right in relation to me, as a life convict?  
  
**Dear defense attorney, Demin Yuri Nikolaevich!**  
  
I hope that now, having other stated facts, to see a complete and clear picture of what will happen in the FKU IK No. 2 OUHD GUFSIN of Russia Perm Territory, Solikamsk (""White Swan""), and in general in relation to those whose death penalty was replaced by life imprisonment, or better to say, to die alive within the walls of the executive system**STATEMENT SHLYKOV VLADISLAV YURIEVICH (Federal State Institution Correctional Facility No. 6 of the Federal Penitentiary Service of Russia, Khabarovsk Krai)**¬†

**Dear defense attorney, Demin Yuri Nikolaevich!**

Based on the Decision of November 30, 2021 No. 2640-0, those serving a life sentence are outside the scope of the law and the right, and constitutional guarantees and norms of international law are not such in relation to those sentenced to life imprisonment.""Life sentence"" V. Kulikov, Rossiyskaya Gazeta of October 5, 2004, comments to Article 21 of the Constitution of Russia under the general editorship of V.D. Zorkin, academician Kutafin, Rossiyskaya Gazeta of August 29, 2003 ""Execute, cannot pardon.""¬†Even the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation - recognized, at the discretion of the torture system of the Federal Penitentiary Service of Russia.

This means discrimination against life-sentenced prisoners, and this discrimination is not spelled out in the Constitution of Russia.¬†(Article 19 of the Constitution of Russia, Article 8 of the Criminal Executive Code of the Russian Federation).In relation to life-sentenced prisoners, justice allows the condition that the policy of personal degradation and destruction of family ties is purposefully carried out.The fact that the restriction of constitutional rights is only on the basis of federal laws, and orders of the Ministry of Justice of the Russian Federation, the Penal Code of the Correctional Institution, instructions - by-laws that must not contradict the laws, are not a law, and not published laws that are not mandatory for execution.¬†(Articles 2, 7, 15-18, 19, 20. 29, 45, 55 of the Constitution of Russia, Articles 3, 8, 10, 87 of the Criminal Executive Code of the Russian Federation).The definition of the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation of 18.04.2006 No. 131-0 has nothing to do with life-sentenced prisoners, and with such a policy the state can return to the Gulag system of destruction, and where is the proclaimed democracy in the Russian Federation, where life-sentenced prisoners are taken outside the law, and due to the fact that the people are silent, the state does not protect, the leadership of the Federal Penitentiary Service of Russia has officials who imagine themselves to be princes, therefore now there are press huts, torture, pressure, where society knows nothing.

Convicts who dare to declare their identity, rights - are pressed, tortured, inventing violations in their actions, and all this on the orders of the top management, and not an ordinary controller, which leads to¬†punishment cell,¬†cold, hunger, but no one thinks about justice, on the principle, my hut is on the edge, and they refused international legal institutions, and they do not give them an order, it is easier to arrange a Gulag regime with officials from here, and executioners appeared, such as (Khomyakov, Parshin, Shvetsov, Buksman, Savin, Shirokov, Starodubtsev, Semenets, Sarkisyan.

**Many convicts are beaten, killed, suicide, but the rest have become mentally abnormal, wipe their shit on the walls, and those lawyers who took the side of the law and justice and the rights of convicts, first of all, like my defense attorney Demin Yuri Nikolaevich, are subjected to false slander, slander - this is the reality of life in the FKU IK¬†No. 2 OUHD GUFSIN of Russia for Perm Krai, city of Solikamsk.¬†(White Swan), of which I am a witness.**

They‚Äôve been friends since high school, and I‚Äôve never had a problem with them hanging out. I trust him and it‚Äôs not about jealousy, all I asked was that he just give me a heads-up when he hangs out one-on-one with another girl. Just basic communication and respect and totally understood and agreed. this all occurred two Mondays ago when he was hanging out with M and failed to mention it to me, I had to find out through her. The thing is, ever since I brought that up (this was a two Mondays ago), M completely ghosted me. No texts, no replies to Snapchats, nothing. I noticed it and even asked my boyfriend if he thought it was weird and he agreed. That Friday when they were hanging out in a group, he brought it up to her and told her she should reach out to me directly instead of going through him like a middleman.

Later that night she sent me a blank Snapchat (literally just a black screen) saying she wasn‚Äôt mad at me but that she felt ‚Äúuntrusted‚Äù and ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt want her whereabouts being watched.‚Äù Which caught me off guard because this was never even about her, it was a boundary I set with my boyfriend not a dig at her. So I responded and asked if we could grab coffee and talk in person since texting feels cold and messy. She said she was open to talking, and I asked what days worked for her after telling her mine and then she ghosted me again!!

Fast forward to the next Monday, I‚Äôm hanging with my boyfriend and he tells me he can‚Äôt do dinner the next night (Tuesday) because M invited him to a concert. I told him it made me super uncomfortable given the weird energy between her and me lately, so I reached out to her directly and asked if it would be weird if I tagged along since I actually love the band, and I remembered her mentioning the tickets when we hung out once. Her response was basically ‚Äúwe have seats, not general admission,‚Äù and she told me she bought the tickets months ago and it was too late, unobvious lie because I looked online and saw that they were tickets available plus she bought them with me sitting in the car with her.

I left her on read after that. It honestly felt like she wanted him there without me, and it felt weird since she has a boyfriend and didn‚Äôt even buy him a ticket. She only got two, one for her and one for my boyfriend. I told him I wasn‚Äôt going to stop him from going, but that I wouldn‚Äôt be comfortable with it. In the end, he decided not to go. I didn‚Äôt pressure him, i told him he is his own person and he can make his own decisions but what he does will say a lot. it was his call.

But then out of nowhere, she texted me again, furious saying I ruined everything, that I forced him to cancel, and that I‚Äôm a crybaby who ‚Äúinfests relationships with drama.‚Äù She called me a ‚Äúweirdo‚Äù and said I made the whole situation a big deal over nothing.

Now it‚Äôs Friday, and suddenly she wants to meet up and talk but only before my boyfriend and I go to dinner. I‚Äôve been trying to talk things out for weeks and now all of a sudden it‚Äôs happening on her timeline. I‚Äôm mentally drained from all of this and feel like I‚Äôm constantly the one being blamed just for trying to have normal boundaries in my relationship.

I really don‚Äôt want this to turn into more drama, but I also don‚Äôt want to keep letting someone treat me like I‚Äôm the problem.

How do I go into this conversation without losing my cool? And honestly‚Ä¶ is it even worth it at this point? I just don‚Äôt know how to handle this situation with anymore grace and maturity than I‚Äôve been giving already ",3,1751054595.0,AmIOverreacting,1,1.0,False

Fast forward to the next Monday, I‚Äôm hanging with my boyfriend and he tells me he can‚Äôt do dinner the next night (Tuesday) because M invited him to a concert. I told him it made me super uncomfortable given the weird energy between her and me lately, so I reached out to her directly and asked if it would be weird if I tagged along since I actually love the band, and I remembered her mentioning the tickets when we hung out once. Her response was basically ‚Äúwe have seats, not general admission,‚Äù and she told me she bought the tickets months ago and it was too late, unobvious lie because I looked online and saw that they were tickets available plus she bought them with me sitting in the car with her.

I left her on read after that. It honestly felt like she wanted him there without me, and it felt weird since she has a boyfriend and didn‚Äôt even buy him a ticket. She only got two, one for her and one for my boyfriend. I told him I wasn‚Äôt going to stop him from going, but that I wouldn‚Äôt be comfortable with it. In the end, he decided not to go. I didn‚Äôt pressure him, i told him he is his own person and he can make his own decisions but what he does will say a lot. it was his call.

But then out of nowhere, she texted me again, furious saying I ruined everything, that I forced him to cancel, and that I‚Äôm a crybaby who ‚Äúinfests relationships with drama.‚Äù She called me a ‚Äúweirdo‚Äù and said I made the whole situation a big deal over nothing.

Now it‚Äôs Friday, and suddenly she wants to meet up and talk but only before my boyfriend and I go to dinner. I‚Äôve been trying to talk things out for weeks and now all of a sudden it‚Äôs happening on her timeline. I‚Äôm mentally drained from all of this and feel like I‚Äôm constantly the one being blamed just for trying to have normal boundaries in my relationship.

I really don‚Äôt want this to turn into more drama, but I also don‚Äôt want to keep letting someone treat me like I‚Äôm the problem.

How do I go into this conversation without losing my cool? And honestly‚Ä¶ is it even worth it at this point? I just don‚Äôt know how to handle this situation with anymore grace and maturity than I‚Äôve been giving already ",1,1751054498.0,whatdoIdo,2,1.0,False
1lm3kqa,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1lm3kqa/his_mistress_stole_my_project/,His Mistress Stole My Project:,"Lilian Ortiz has spent five years hiding her relationship with Julian Alvarez, the brilliant but distant CEO who insists office romances ""look bad."" But when Julian publicly humiliates her, hands her hard-earned project to a new intern, and showers the girl with blatant favoritism, the whispers begin‚ÄîNevaeh Harvey might be the next CEO‚Äôs wife. As Lilian deletes their secret photos and boards a train home, she wonders: Was their love ever real, or just another one of Julian‚Äôs calculated lies? The truth might destroy them both‚Äîif she even wants to hear it.

**Chapter 1 - The Weight of Hidden Love**

The moment my computer booted up this morning, a jarring message popped up in the work group chat:

""Project entering final phase. Full responsibility transferred to Nevaeh Harvey.""

The sender was Julian Alvarez, my direct supervisor.

My fingers hovered over the keyboard for several seconds before typing a single word: ""Noted.""

Just like that, the project I'd poured three months of effort into was casually handed over to an intern who'd only been here two months.

The office air suddenly grew heavy, countless gazes burning into my back.

Everyone believed the young, accomplished CEO despised me above all others.

Just last week during a department meeting, he'd publicly shredded my proposal.

Yet no one knew he was also my secret boyfriend of five years.

""Office romances look bad. We need to maintain appearances,"" had been his excuse for half a decade.

So he ignored my calls, avoided every opportunity to be alone, even demanded I never post our photos online.

Now, everyone could see his obvious favoritism toward Nevaeh. Whispers that the intern would become the next CEO's wife spread through the company like wildfire.

Suddenly, maintaining appearances didn't seem to matter anymore.

I calmly cleared my desk and wiped down my computer.

After leaving my resignation letter, I bought a one-way ticket home.

As the station announcement called for boarding, I stood in the terminal, gazing at the city where I'd lived for five years.

Because Julian was still here.

The first cracks appeared last Christmas Eve.

During annual bonus distribution, rewards were allocated by project.

The major project I'd spearheaded from start to finish.

Simply because I'd let the new intern handle some final details during the closing phase.

When evaluations came, ninety percent of that project's bonus went to her.

Two months of my blood, sweat, and tears.

Quentin Parker looked at me apologetically: ""Director Ortiz, this was Mr. Alvarez's decision...""

That intern had been my exception, someone I'd personally brought onto the team.

I'd wanted to mentor her, give her a chance to shine.

Never imagined my two months of hard work would become someone else's triumph.

Quentin sighed: ""Mr. Alvarez insisted on rewarding outstanding newcomers like Nevaeh Harvey.""

Nevaeh was that intern.

And Mr. Alvarez‚ÄîJulian‚Äîwas my boyfriend of five years.

The platform wind cut through me as I stood by my train, deleting photos from my phone one by one.

Julian had always insisted office relationships violated company policy, forcing our five-year romance to stay hidden.

These photos only existed because I'd begged for them, and he'd forbidden me from sharing them online.

He kept such distance that everyone assumed he disliked me.

When he redirected my project bonus, my colleagues thought nothing of it.

Deleting the photos brought back that bonus allocation day.

Furious, I'd called him from the hallway‚Äîand gotten sent to voicemail, as usual.

For five years, he almost never took my work calls.

But a text appeared instantly: ""Busy.""

This time though, I wasn't having it. I marched straight to his corner office.

Through the glass partition, I saw him leaning over Nevaeh's desk, explaining some strategy.

As the girl leaned closer, the fringe of her scarf brushed against his neck.

The young CEO who'd taken over the Chicago branch and earned New York headquarters' recognition in mere years‚Äîhis talent was undeniable.

Once, I too had longed for his guidance.

**Chapter 2 - Favoritism in the Storm**

When I faced disciplinary action for a work mistake, he never stepped in: ""Live and learn.""

Yet now he was patiently explaining basic Excel functions to Nevaeh, who couldn‚Äôt even manage a pivot table.

On his desk sat the lunch I‚Äôd packed for him‚Äîlike always.

To keep up appearances, I had the cafeteria lady deliver it instead.

""Julian, I skipped breakfast‚ÄîI‚Äôm starving. Mind if I take your lunch? Dinner‚Äôs on me later,"" Nevaeh said, eyeing the meal I‚Äôd carefully prepared.

""Go ahead,"" he muttered, eyes glued to his emails.

Nevaeh popped open the container, humming over the pot roast between bites.

Right then, I knew demanding an explanation about that rigged performance review would be pointless.

As I turned to go, the entire building plunged into darkness.

The storm had forced corporate to declare a remote work day.

Feeling my way downstairs, I spotted two figures walking shoulder-to-shoulder through the downpour.

Julian held an umbrella angled just so, sheltering Nevaeh as they made for his car.

I arrived home soaked to the bone, looking like something the cat dragged in, when Julian‚Äôs call came.

""Lilian,"" he said, ""figured you‚Äôd have an umbrella. You get back okay?""

In the background, Nevaeh asked if he wanted extra cinnamon in his latte.

""I tried beef stew today,"" I said, white-knuckling my phone. ""How was it?""

""Yeah‚Ä¶ decent,"" he answered absently.

After hanging up, Nevaeh‚Äôs new Instagram post appeared:

A cozy room, two wine glasses touching‚Äî""Nothing beats feeling special.""

The train hissed into the station. I boarded with my suitcase, distant shouts fading behind me.

Maybe they were calling my name. Maybe not.

I didn‚Äôt look back.

This journey home, starting from the southern city, made its first stop in Hartford.

Where my story with Julian began too.

My first solo project‚Äîa Hartford bid proposal.

Subway down. Taxi line stretching 400 deep. Deadline breathing down my neck.

In desperation, I called Quentin Parker, who grumbled before giving me Julian‚Äôs number.

On the other end, Julian listened to my frantic plea and sighed. ""Stay put. I‚Äôm coming.""

Through the storm, he raced toward me, steadying my panic while lecturing about buffer time.

We submitted with seconds to spare, my hands still trembling.

Leaning against his car afterward, he handed me a steaming coffee.

That night, I posted a story visible only to him:

""Met a guardian angel in the rain today.""

He left a silent like.

Now, I liked Nevaeh‚Äôs post too. It vanished within minutes.

Julian called instantly, testing the waters. ""Heading back now.""

I kept my voice even, only telling him to drive safe.

He sounded relieved. ""Don‚Äôt catch cold, alright?""

""Julian,"" I blurted, ""this Christmas‚Äîcan we finally tell my parents about us?""

He‚Äôd always refused, claiming bad timing.

""Forget it,"" he murmured. ""They‚Äôre already nagging about marriage. Let‚Äôs not stir the pot.""

""Okay,"" I laughed softly before hanging up.

The post-rain fever hit like a truck. For once, I cabbed to work.

Staring out the window, I watched Julian‚Äôs car zoom past.

Turns out our places weren‚Äôt so far apart after all.

**Chapter 3 - The Road Not Taken**

So I never expected him to give me a ride, and he seemed relieved to avoid any suspicion.

It wasn‚Äôt until today that I realized the road had been fixed for over six months‚Äîdriving here would only take ten minutes.

All this time, he passed by my place every single day, yet never once offered me a lift.

And today, he came from the direction of Nevaeh‚Äôs apartment complex, Breeze Grove.

It wasn‚Äôt a detour. It was intentional.

At the office, I slapped on a fever patch and buried myself in organizing the handover files, until a familiar but rarely seen figure appeared.

Julian frowned. ""Why didn‚Äôt you tell me you were sick?""

I didn‚Äôt look up. ""What‚Äôs the point? It‚Äôs not like you‚Äôd take care of me like a proper boyfriend would.""

Noticing colleagues trickling in, I lowered my voice. ""You should go. Aren‚Äôt you the one who‚Äôs paranoid about being seen with me?""

He hesitated, then turned and left.

The second stop on this train was Riverbend.

Julian and I had history tied to that place.

Back then, I had just gotten my full-time position and accompanied Quentin Parker and Julian to Riverbend to finalize a project contract.

The night before signing, after reviewing the bid proposal, we grabbed a late-night bite at a diner.

Out of nowhere, masked men charged at Julian with ruthless precision.

Quentin called the police while shouting for help.

If anything happened to Julian, the deal the next day would fall through.

Without thinking, I grabbed a loose brick from the roadside and jumped in.

We both ended up battered.

When a blade swung straight for Julian‚Äôs head, I threw myself in front of him, taking the slash on my arm.

He pulled me to the ground, shielding me, and before I blacked out, all I heard was the wail of sirens.

When I woke up, he was the only one in the hospital room.

""Was it worth it?"" His gaze was intense. ""Risking your life like that?""

""I couldn‚Äôt just‚Ä¶ watch you get hurt,"" I whispered. ""You helped me before. This time, it was my turn.""

Then I realized his hand was gripping mine.

The moment felt eerily familiar. I froze. ""Mr. Alvarez‚Äî""

""Call me Julian,"" he murmured.

On the day I was discharged, instead of the company car, he came to pick me up himself.

He took me to Lakeshore Park, his eyes soft as the rippling water.

""I‚Äôve thought about this for a long time. The girl who took a knife for me‚Äîif she‚Äôs willing to meet me halfway, I‚Äôll treat her right.""

The sunset painted the lake crimson. I reached out and hugged him, and he pressed a kiss to my temple.

Back then, he looked at my wound with nothing but heartache. Now, all I got was a frown over a fever patch.

Once the handover files were done, a colleague nudged me to check the work group chat.

In the new project group, Quentin had added Julian, who left only one instruction:

""With the project in its final stages, full responsibility is transferred to Nevaeh Harvey.""

The team glanced at me, waiting for a reaction.

Everyone knew Julian couldn‚Äôt stand me, but this was a slap in the face.

All I replied was, ""Noted.""

Fine. Made the handover easier.

I forwarded all the materials to Nevaeh, then submitted a sick leave request‚Äîapproved instantly.

I left my resignation letter on the desk.

**Chapter 4 - The Last Visit to Eden**

Eden was the last place Julian and I visited together. His promotion announcement was about to be released, and I was genuinely thrilled for him. We relaxed in Eden‚Äôs famous hot springs.

Newer Fan of Death Becomes Her the Musical here, and I've been kicking around some fanfiction ideas, but I want to see if there's any interest before I dive in. I'm thinking of writing a story featuring the incredible cast: Christopher Sieber, Jennifer Simard, and Megan Hilty.
I'd use a gender-neutral main character named Y/N and gender-neutral pronouns.

Here are a couple of my initial concepts:
 
* VIP Backstage Pass: Y/N wins a contest for VIP tickets to Death Becomes Her, including a backstage tour and a chance to meet the cast.

 * Joining the Cast: Y/N auditions for the musical and lands a role as an understudy or stand-in for either Helen or Madeline, getting to work alongside Megan Hilty (Madeline), Jennifer Simard (Helen), and Christopher Sieber (Ernest). 

I'm also open to other ideas! What about:

 * Casual Hangout: Y/N ends up in a situation where they get to hang out with the cast outside of the theater ‚Äì maybe a quirky coffee shop encounter or a funny group dinner.

 * Unexpected Collaboration: Y/N, who might be a writer, musician, or artist, collaborates with one or more of the cast members on a project unrelated to the musical.

 * A ""What If"" Scenario: Given the magical themes of the show, what if Y/N somehow gets caught up in a Death Becomes Her-esque magical mishap with one of the cast members?

Please let me know what you think of these, or if you have any other cool ideas! Your feedback will really help me decide what to write.
Thanks!

I am now training for the 2026 LA Marathon. I bought my first pair of bona fide running shoes a few months ago (Brooks Glycerin) and they have been a revelation. I have read in tons of places that the life of running shoes is between 300 - 500 mi, and my Garmin Connect has been logging the use and as of today, I'm at 410.58 mi. Garmin is telling me to replace. However, being naive, I can't see anything (superficially) that would indicate the end of life of my shoes.

So, I guess the question is: other than the guidelines of 400+ mi is the end of life, is there anything else that would indicate it's time to move on? The shoes have no visible spots of weakness, feel fine, and other than some obligatory coffee stains, look great. The vast majority of my running is on the road, and I am running better right now than I ever have.

Would you marry someone who is not transparent/honest from the beginning and hope they change after marriage? I'm curious what everyone think of this question.

I'll try to tell my story without being biased or involve any emotions. I've been engaged to my fianc√©e for about a month and half now. One time we were talking and she said that she had dialysis when she was 10-12 years old. I kept asking her questions about the reason to do dialysis but she undermined it and said it was nothing really; just some kidney stones. But that doesn't explain how a kid could have kidney stones that lead to dialysis. Anyways, one week later, I asked her again but this time, she said that she gets kidney stones if she eats food with a lot of spice or salty. All of that made me worried and I had to ask one of my friends who is a doctor. He said that there is a missing link, so I went back to her and told her that there will be a medical examination before I apply for her visa (she lives abroad), so is there anything I should know of - she got worried/anxious during that call. Next day, she tells me that she had an inflammation and pus on her kidneys and also had kidney stones. And she had to undergo nephoscopy. She also had malleable bone after all that. So I asked her about the dialysis again and she said that she didn't undergo the dialysis, even though she told me she did it. She ensured me that she is fully recovered and nothing is going on with her right now, except that she got to avoid salty food, limit her coffee intake. She also doesn't like desserts so I don't know if that's related to her condition.



She is great and I truly love her but she wasn't transparent/honest with me from the very beginning about her health condition which made me very suspicious now as the trust is gone. I feel that I kept playing a game so I get to know the truth. If she told me from the very beginning about her condition, I'd have accepted it her anyways just for her honesty. Things happen in life and we all are exposed to diseases and health conditions. What didn't set right with me was the dishonesty. 

What's your opinion on all of that? Please give me your honest advice. Jazakum allahkhyarin üôè

1lm3b0x,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lm3b0x,Currently at Excellence Coral Playa Mujeres ‚Äî Ask Me Anything,"My husband and I are on day 5 out of a 7 day stay here at ECPM‚Äîthis is our first ever all-inclusive experience so the only thing we‚Äôve had to compare it to are a few cruises. 

Overall, we‚Äôve had a fantastic time. The extremely varied/mediocre to bad quality of the food has been the most disappointing part, and something that will probably cause us to not come back to the Excellence brand. 

I‚Äôll give my brief thoughts, and happy to answer any questions, as these kinds of reviews were really helpful for us in choosing this place!

-The room has been amazing. We are in the lowest room type (I think it‚Äôs Junior Suite Pool View) and it hasn‚Äôt felt like a sacrifice at all. The swim up pool on the first floor below us doesn‚Äôt seem to be used by anyone, and it‚Äôs a lot more fun to lay by the larger pool with a beautiful view of the ocean and fantastic drink service. The room is extremely modern, and we‚Äôve loved the higher-tech light and temperature controls. Housekeeping has been lovely!

-The resort did not feel as empty as earlier posters experienced‚ÄîI‚Äôd estimate closer to 50% capacity by the end of the week? We had hoped a lower capacity would mean a free room upgrade lol, but alas it did not:) It was easy to find a seat at the pool, and we really enjoyed the fun but chill vibe around the pool deck. 

-The food. Y‚Äôall we had such high hopes and have been so disappointed. It has felt like a gamble every time we order something of whether it‚Äôs going to be fairly good or utterly disgusting. At least one item per meal has been bad enough that we moved the food around on our plate to make it look like we ate more than one bite. It‚Äôs been cringeworthy, and it‚Äôs detracted from the overall experience and made us not want to order things we might usually want to try. I ordered chicken teriyaki last night at Spice, and I‚Äôve never seen such a simple dish be executed so poorly? Today I had a burger at the Lobster House that was so bad in so many ways that it made me almost throw up upon my first bite lol, which was bizarre because I ordered the same burger a few days earlier and it was one of the best things I‚Äôve had here. So many dishes have just tasted off in a way that‚Äôs hard to explain. The ribeye at the Grill was delicious, but the mac and cheese, mashed potatoes, and appetizers there were not worth finishing. 

Breakfast has been consistently delicious, and we‚Äôve loved getting ice cream and coffee from Aroma every day. Sushi was great, pizza at Oregano was fantastic, and the mezzeh platter at Milo was great too. All the drinks have been delicious from all of the bars, and I‚Äôve been getting alcohol free versions of everything that haven‚Äôt disappointed. The coconuts available at the Revive bar in the back of the resort are awesome. We haven‚Äôt tried Chez Isabelle, Kanpai, or Raices yet, so I‚Äôll let you know how those are soon. 

We live in a big city, so we are used to fairly good restaurants, but we don‚Äôt have particularly expensive tastes. Our assessment is that the food is too ambitious for picky eaters to enjoy, and too poorly made for those who like fancier menus to enjoy. 

TLDR: Really disappointing food, but our overall experience has been lovely! Open to any questions!",2,1751053821.0,AllInclusiveResorts,2,1.0,False

We have recently been asked to donate coloring books for a community project. After the board talked on it we would love to be able to donate coloring pages made by our lovely members for the adult coloring art class.
Each page submitted would count towards 1 hour of volunteering if anyone is interested in going the volunteer route. Or, if you're already a member, we'd appreciate the help with this project!
Not a good drawer? That's okay!!  I'm not either buwahahaha. Here are a few pages I've already made. They don't need to be super detailed: just something fun. If you need help transitioning an art piece to a coloring page, just let me know and I'd be happy to help!

[Yes, it is possible to get an official, definitive diagnosis that way. Surgery is not always necessary for an endo diagnosis (post about MRI diagnosis)](https://www.reddit.com/r/endometriosis/comments/1lf6a9h/endometriosis_can_only_be_diagnosed_through/)**.**

Back then, I had no pain during my periods. Just a few years later however, it slowly progressed from being in pain for one hour during two or three periods a year, to being in atrocious pain for several hours and at a minimum of a 6/10 pain the rest of the time during every single period.

Because people have doubted the level of pain I had before diet, I'm going to try to describe it.

1. **PAIN AND OTHER SYMPTOMS BEFORE DIET**

* During a crisis: usually during the second day of my periods, I would lie down, my right leg folded up, crying, moaning, and continuously rocking left and right. The pain was radiating down my right thigh, knee, in my lower back, in my right hip. Everything from my navel to the top of my thighs felt swollen and hot. Cramping was relentless. I would apply a hot water bottle and burn the skin of my pelvis. I would wake up three, four, five hours later with no memory of falling asleep.
* Going to the bathroom was painful.The bloating was extreme to the point of limiting the clothes I could wear. I had trouble urinating. I was housebound due to difficulty walking during the second day, and due to blood loss being so important I could not leave the house without risking an accident. I would leave a large towel on the couch and on the bed, that I would only use for that specific purpose and that I would leave there for the 8, 9 days that I was on my periods. I would get up 3, 4 times a night to change.
* I was extremely fatigued throughout my cycle but especially during my periods. It felt like a low grade fever with all of my muscles aching. I was continuously severely anemic for both iron and b12, unless I supplemented. I also had acne all over my face, but particularly around my mouth, on my chin and down my neck.

**2. WHAT MY MRI AND BLOOD TEST SHOWED THEN:**

Fibroids, endometriomas on both ovaries, scar tissue in the pouch of douglas, thickening of my left uterosacral ligament, nodule between my bladder and uterus, and more that I don't know how to translate from my native language. Huge estrogen dominance in hormones. Low levels of iron and b12.

**3. WHAT I WOULD EAT BEFORE STARTING THE DIET**

* No fast food ever, very little processed foods. 90% of my meals were homemade, and Mediterranean (not a health related choice, just the norm where I live). A lot of fruits, a lot of vegetables.
* However, with that I would also eat a lot of bread, cheese, sour cream, sugar (ice cream, chocolate and other). I would also have a beer once in a while, and would have one expresso a day. The food I ate was rarely organic.

My endometriosis got worse during a period of my life that was stress free. I'm certain that stress increases inflammation and pain levels, but in my case at that point in time, stress wasn't a factor.

**4. WHY I TURNED TO CHANGES IN DIET TO LOWER INFLAMMATION LEVELS INSTEAD OF OTHER SOLUTIONS**

* Six months into my symptoms being at their worst, I consulted a surgeon gynecologist who worked in a specialized unit (endo center) with the full intention of getting surgery.
* In my country, we have universal healthcare. I knew I would never want children. I knew close to nothing about endometriosis, how it spreads, what it meant for my organs, what a hormonal imbalance was and the impact it could have on overall health, what surgery to have, what repeated surgeries entail, etc etc etc.
* What I mean is: I had no reason not to do surgery, and the sole reason I went to see a surgeon that day was because I wanted the pain to stop. Nothing else mattered to me, and I didn't know what I didn't know.
* The surgeon was all for doing the surgery on me, however, she told me that if I refused to take the pill (I did not want to take meds every day until menopause), and I quote, ""everything will be back in a year"".
* It's with this in mind that I went back home. I was hoping there was a third solution. I started to look into the ""endo diet"" thinking I had the time, the means, and nothing to lose.

**5. THE DIET I FOLLOWED:**

Here's what was recommended on the site I visited (in my native language, so I won't post it):

* all homemade, all organic
* no gluten, no dairy, no coffee, no sugar, no alcohol, no processed foods
* whole grains
* to add: cruciferous vegetables, nuts, legumes, fruits, fish, poultry.
* NAC supplement, 600mg a day, 2, 3 months a year.

I applied all of it from one day to the next, **with** **the exception of:**

* my expresso with one cube of sugar that I kept having once a day for the first 3 months,
* bread and pasta, that I decided to keep, and that I kept eating until January of this year. I would only make the effort to buy whole wheat.
* not everything I was eating was organic. I would focus on buying organic the foods that are most sprayed with pesticides. There are lists online.

Everything else was removed and respected and I added a lot of cabbage, broccoli, lentils, chick peas, beans; still lots of fruits, vegetables, but the most colorful types. No meat at the time, for reasons unrelated to health. Walnuts, almonds. I took NAC, 600mg a day, for the first month. I didn't take it again until January of this year.

A few examples of the meals I would make: pa√´lla, fermented red cabbage, korean tofu stew, red lentils dhaal, ratatouille, pistou soup, oats-banana pancakes, etc.

**6. IMPACT OF DIET ON MY SYMPTOMS**

>When I had my first periods after starting the diet, I already felt a difference in pain levels **but was convinced it was a placebo effect.**

>During the second period I had after starting the diet the difference in pain levels was so stark with what it used to be that all suspicion of a placebo effect disappeared. The pain was still important, but I had no crisis anymore where I would lie down with my knee to my chest and rock back and forth crying.

>Third and fourth period after starting the diet: the pain decreased to a 30 minute ""peak"", at something like 6/10. What I was feeling the rest of the time only qualified as discomfort rather than pain. The bloating was still there but it had decreased. My acne purely and simply vanished.

>I remember telling people that I had **zero pain left after my fifth period**. I remember saying that it felt like I had magic powers. I had significantly less anxiety as well, however I also had less *drive* for a while:

>About 10-12 months into the diet, I realized that my libido was back, meaning that it had taken a dramatic dive and I hadn't realized it. Knowing that my blood tests two years later showed that I didn't have any hormonal imbalance anymore, one possibility is that this was a direct result of my estrogen levels dropping after starting the diet, while my progesterone was still at increased levels. If that's the case, it means it took about a year for my hormones to be balanced again.

>Six months into the diet, I was losing half of the blood that I'd lose before. A year into it, my periods would last 6 days instead of 8 or 9. Today I lose less than the maximum amount considered to be normal.

**7. WHAT DOES MY DIET LOOK LIKE NOW, FOUR YEARS LATER**

>In January of this year, I've had an MRI by a specialist of my pelvic area and diaphragm. Not everything can be seen on MRI. Taking this into account, every lesion, nodule, endometriomas I had disappeared except for the endometriomas on my left ovary, along with my thickened left ligament. The nodule in my pouch of douglas also only shrank from 3cm to 1cm.

>After that MRI, I decided to finally remove gluten and to reintroduce dairy in the form of two organic kefir yogurts a week. I now also eat fish and seafood. It's been six months and it's still going really well. Removing gluten rid me of mild digestive symptoms I had. I've taken NAC in January, and will take it again in August. I'll make a follow up post the next time I do an MRI.

>Very occasionally, when I visit my friends, I'll have chocolate, a coffee, some cheese. But there is still none of it in my apartment. I hadn't planned on keeping that diet for as long as I have, but it made such a night and day difference in my quality of life and was therefore such an extremely positive, gratifying, empowering experience for me that I just have never wanted to stop it.

>On top of that, I'm not ""miserable"": I love what I eat, I eat as much as I want, and I love the recipes I've discovered as a result of having to follow that diet. This has been nothing but beneficial for me.

>It's been four years and I'm still pain free. I still get bloating on the first day of my periods, and after eating in general. I suspect SIBO, and I would like to get rid of it, but this has no impact on my quality of life. I have the occasional butt lightning. On periods following extremely stressful events (this has happened 3 times since starting the diet), I've had 15, 20 minutes of something like a 4/10 pain during the second day of my periods -never more than that.

I also struggled with the fact that they don't seem to be projecting much, they are very good in duration, but they mostly seem to be detectable if you get really close to the area applied, I'll keep testing tho. With that said, let's begin:  


**1.- Sigil**  
  
**Alkemia's description:** ""A recipe in an ancient 16th century grimoire that includes olibanum frankincense, lignum aloes, bdellium, styrax, black honey, and euphorbium; the essence of ""Stones of Immortality"" - opium thebaicum, dried citrus, and the quintessence of gold; and an alchemist's compounding of coffee beans and ritual herbs.""

**My thoughts:** It instantly reminds me of visiting one of my aunt‚Äôs old house in a very humid city here in Mexico called Tampico. It reminds me of old wood and old books with some humidity and warmth tied to them, it also has a bit of sweetness, kind of like honey, and it does declare black honey as a note so it makes sense, it also declares poppy flower (opium plant) which gives a very distinct flower note, similar to white floral but with some edge, and on top of all that there‚Äôs always some incense in the background. I still have not found a purpose for it but it‚Äôs definitely a refined smell that I would not use daily IMO, nostalgic for me, and this was one of my favorites, I would rate this 6.5/10.  


**2.- Midnight Garden**

Hauntingly beautiful.""  
  
**My thoughts:** Completely floral, in fact it declares only floral notes, it might smell a little bit like slightly rotting flowers at the start but that scent fades quickly and then it actually smells just like it would smell if you were standing near to a bunch of flowers, but not actually as strong as it would be to smell a flower directly, that's something I liked about it, it's very floral but in a subtle and a little bit humid and fresh way. If I had to compare it to a popular perfume I‚Äôd say Gucci Bloom Parfum, BUT, again, this one is much more subtle in my opinion (it might also be because I tried with a wand and not as a spray). I would honestly not use it, I thought by the name and description that it would be greener but it‚Äôs actually just floral, and that‚Äôs not a bad thing, I do enjoy floral perfumes, but usually when they‚Äôre mixed with some other things, this is not for me but I gifted it to my mom and she absolutely LOVED it, I would rate this 5/10, my mom rated it 7.5/10.

I would use this on my body and let any other more bold perfume project on my neck. It's a simple smell compared to Sigil, BUT since I do have a clear idea of what I'd use this for, I rate it higher than Sigil because it's purpose is much more straightforward, you want to smell fresh and rainy? Go for this. Side note, it smelled amazing once I put it on to visit a garden. I would rate this 7/10.  


**4.-** **Kitten & The Falling Leaves**   
  
**Alkemia's description:** ""Fresh fallen snow falling from bare tree branches, subtle whispers of hemlock pine, galbanum, ginger, lemonwood, witch hazel flowers, and damp wool.""  
  
**My thoughts:** This is very musky in a little bit dirty way, I don‚Äôt really detect the leaf notes, I feel like it smells more like a mix of musk and wet cinnamon bark or wet wood in general, it‚Äôs kind of wet and warm but not too much, it‚Äôs also sweet. This is definitely a ‚Äúyour skin but better‚Äù type of perfume, but I don‚Äôt particularly love it, I do like it tho, I would also use it on my body and let another perfume shine on my neck BUT, I'd much rather use St Louis Cemetery #1. I would rate this 5/10, it's nice but I feel like there's better perfumes on this type.

**Alkemia's description:** ""Fresh fallen snow falling from bare tree branches, subtle whispers of hemlock pine, galbanum, ginger, lemonwood, witch hazel flowers, and damp wool.""  
  
**My thoughts:** It's a very simple scent, BUT it was actually my favorite, I would resume it in musky as the most notorious note, then it's pinetree and finally I am catching a little bit of rosemary, this is honestly what I expected from Kitten & The Falling Leaves, it's a scent that gives me a lot of peace, and I feel like I can't go wrong wearing this, it's close to the perfect ""clean"" or ""your skin but better"" scent IMO. Its purpose is very clear to me and it's overall a scent that many people can like. I rate this 7.5/10 (I might get this in spray and if it smells better I'd give it 8/10).  
  
  
**6.-** **Carmilla**   
  
**Alkemia's description:** ""A tantalizing enigma of Ambre marocain, cashmere musk, Malgas lily, Ylang-ylang, dark Bourbon rose, soft patchouli, and erotic whispers of jasmine incense.""  
  
**My thoughts:** I don't know how they did it but this smells like cherry and flowers, it's definitely some type of ambery accord, on the dry down it turns a little bit gourmand IMO, and starts smelling like a cherry lollipop, it's a nice aroma, but it's really too sweet for me, I don't really enjoy it, BUT, I think it is a very feminine smell and it will very probably work for a lot of women, I KNOW even tho this doesn't work for me, it will smell AMAZING on some people's skin. I would rate it 6/10.  


**7.-** **Siren's Spell**   
  
**Alkemia's description:** ""A beachy love spell woven from the sun-warmed white beach sand, star jasmine, plumeria, suntan lotion, sea spray, coconut cream, vanilla orchid, and tonka.""  
  
**My thoughts:** This I actually didn't like at first but then it grew into me a little bit, it's mostly a jasmine oriented scent, and I do like white florals but at first I felt like this is a bit too strong on the jasmine notes, BUT then as it dried down and I kept testing it I started picking up the beachy notes, it's a little bit salty, and it DOES smell a bit like suntan lotion, it definitely makes you feel like you're on the beach so I gave this extra points for being VERY accurate to the description. I rate this 7/10 (again, I might get this in spray and if it smells better I'd make it 7.5/10) 

  
**Final notes:** The most interesting smell IMO was Sigil and I am looking forward to explore more of the more, experimental and weird perfumes that Alkemia has, since Sigil proved to me that they're good at making weird scents good.

I also struggled with the fact that they don't seem to be projecting much, they are very good in duration, but they mostly seem to be detectable if you get really close to the area applied, I'll keep testing tho.

**Alkemia's description:** ""A recipe in an ancient 16th century grimoire that includes olibanum frankincense, lignum aloes, bdellium, styrax, black honey, and euphorbium; the essence of ""Stones of Immortality"" - opium thebaicum, dried citrus, and the quintessence of gold; and an alchemist's compounding of coffee beans and ritual herbs.""

**My thoughts:** It instantly reminds me of visiting one of my aunt‚Äôs old house in a very humid city here in Mexico called Tampico. It reminds me of old wood and old books with some humidity and warmth tied to them, it also has a bit of sweetness, kind of like honey, and it does declare black honey as a note so it makes sense, it also declares poppy flower (opium plant) which gives a very distinct flower note, similar to white floral but with some edge, and on top of all that there‚Äôs always some incense in the background. I still have not found a purpose for it but it‚Äôs definitely a refined smell that I would not use daily IMO, nostalgic for me, and this was one of my favorites, I would rate this 6.5/10.  


**2.- Midnight Garden**

**My thoughts:** It's a very simple scent, BUT it was actually my favorite, I would resume it in musky as the most notorious note, then it's pinetree and finally I am catching a little bit of rosemary, this is honestly what I expected from Kitten & The Falling Leaves, it's a scent that gives me a lot of peace, and I feel like I can't go wrong wearing this, it's close to the perfect ""clean"" or ""your skin but better"" scent IMO. Its purpose is very clear to me and it's overall a scent that many people can like. I rate this 7.5/10 (I might get this in spray and if it smells better I'd give it 8/10).  
  
  
**6.-** **Carmilla**   
  
**Alkemia's description:** ""A tantalizing enigma of Ambre marocain, cashmere musk, Malgas lily, Ylang-ylang, dark Bourbon rose, soft patchouli, and erotic whispers of jasmine incense.""  
  
**My thoughts:** I don't know how they did it but this smells like cherry and flowers, it's definitely some type of ambery accord, on the dry down it turns a little bit gourmand IMO, and starts smelling like a cherry lollipop, it's a nice aroma, but it's really too sweet for me, I don't really enjoy it, BUT, I think it is a very feminine smell and it will very probably work for a lot of women, I KNOW even tho this doesn't work for me, it will smell AMAZING on some people's skin. I would rate it 6/10.  


**7.-** **Siren's Spell**   
  
**Alkemia's description:** ""A beachy love spell woven from the sun-warmed white beach sand, star jasmine, plumeria, suntan lotion, sea spray, coconut cream, vanilla orchid, and tonka.""  
  
**My thoughts:** This I actually didn't like at first but then it grew into me a little bit, it's mostly a jasmine oriented scent, and I do like white florals but at first I felt like this is a bit too strong on the jasmine notes, BUT then as it dried down and I kept testing it I started picking up the beachy notes, it's a little bit salty, and it DOES smell a bit like suntan lotion, it definitely makes you feel like you're on the beach so I gave this extra points for being VERY accurate to the description. I rate this 7/10 (again, I might get this in spray and if it smells better I'd make it 7.5/10) 

  
Final notes: The most interesting smell IMO was Sigil and I am looking forward to explore more of the more, experimental and weird perfumes that Alkemia has, since Sigil proved to me that they're good at making weird scents good.

1lm37lp,https://www.reddit.com/r/PetPeeves/comments/1lm37lp/come_to_brazil/,"""Come to Brazil""","I was an expat kid, so I moved around quite a bit in my youth, mostly in South America. I spent a couple of years living in Chile and then a large chunk in Paraguay. I still live in Paraguay to this day; I moved back here six years ago. 

Now, Paraguay isn't the most well-known country in South America. It definitely gets overshadowed by the likes of Brazil, Argentina or Chile. This is especially noticeable when a band or singer does a South American tour. Brazil, Argentina and Chile are *always* included on the tour. They might do Colombia and Peru as well. Paraguay, Uruguay and Ecuador may be included if we're lucky, but the chances are low. Bolivia, Venezuela and that trio of Suriname, Guyana and French Guiana have it the worst because they're *never* included. 

Because of this, I find it extremely annoying when Brazilians spam comment sections with, ""Come to Brazil."" For example, let's say Dua Lipa posts dates for her **European** tour. A lot of the top comments will be, ""Come to Brazil,"" ""Brazil when,"" or simply, ""Brazil üáßüá∑."" Do they not see that it says *European* tour, not South American tour? Can they not just wait their turn? 

Then, a couple of months later Dua Lipa uploads a picture, saying that she'll post the South American tour dates tomorrow at 9am. Again, the top comments will be the typical stuff from the Brazilians (""Come to Brazil,"" ""Brazil loves you,"" ""üáßüá∑üáßüá∑üáßüá∑""). When the post comes out the next day (which will inevitably include two or three shows in Brazil), it'll be the same thing again (""BRASIL,"" ""Brazil ‚ù§‚ù§,"" ""üáßüá∑""). These comment will all have loads of likes from fellow Brazilians. Meanwhile, if you scroll down 40 comments, you might see a sad ""What about Uruguay? üá∫üáæ üò¢,"" buried under the Brazilian spam. 

I just don't see why they have to do this. Brazil is a *very* famous country. It's hosted the Olympics, it's hosted the World Cup, it has a rich footballing history and culture, their yellow football shirt is one of the most iconic and bestselling football shirts around, they've had several Formula 1 legends, they're known for their coffee and cocoa, they're known for samba, bossa nova, carnaval, capoeira, Brazilian jiu-jitsu, the Amazon rainforest, Brazilian rosewood, their supermodels, their beautiful beaches, their beachwear (bikinis, speedos and flip-flops), the Brazilian waxing, the Brazilian butt lift, etc. People know about Brazil! If Dua Lipa, Linkin Park, Oasis, Harry Styles, Taylor Swift, Lana Del Rey or whoever announces a South American tour, Brazilians are safe knowing that Brazil will *always* be included. They don't have to write, ""Come to Brazil,"" on everything. 

I just find the whole thing kind of rude, showing off and waving their flag because they're from a better country. Also, I genuinely believe that part of the reason why the smaller countries get ignored on the tours is because the tour manager cannot see the, ""Paraguay loves you üáµüáæ,"" ""Uruguay üá∫üáæ,"" and, ""Ecuador please üá™üá®, "" comments under the swarm of, ""Come to Brazil üáßüá∑."" I bet over half the people commenting that don't even go to the show anyway. 

Sorry, I guess I'm just a little upset that I'm unable to see Dua Lipa, Oasis and Linkin Park on their upcoming South American tours. Paraguay has been forgotten yet again. ü•≤ Enjoy yourselves, Brazilians.

So as soon as she heard they were there, she right away in panic said ""we need to go his family is there we need to leave now asap can you just drop me back off home and get your drink later"" and I thought that was neurotic and rude, because we were literally like less than 5 min of a walk towards Philz coffee, and the whole point of us going out was to enjoy a coffee break together, but I felt disrespected with how eager she was to leave for her boyfriends family arrival. There was no urgent need to why she had to leave, his family just arrived to the party as guests, nothing dramatic about it. Is it wrong of me to be annoyed as f from her? Was she being disrespectful & rude or am I looking at it too deeply?

1lm2wsv,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lm2wsv,I think I found Jack's Pee Pee Tree,"After analysing the heck out of this specific scene in the video, I think I roughly know where that tree is.

From the first picture, taken just before Jack sets his camera down, I see a foliage in the background that looks like the tree that juts out in the video, giving it somewhat of a crescent shape. This leads me to believe he set his camera down in the cleared bulge just to the bottom of that foliage highlighted in purple.

In the second picture, Jack sets his camera down and runs to pee. Based on where the camera is placed and how the trees are aligned in this shot, I believe Jack placed the camera in the blue dot and the tree in the foreground (boxed in pink) is the one dotted in pink. Jack then runs leftwards, and, based on logical understanding, Jack is not likely to run all the way into the forest just for a quick piss, and hence it is likely that the tree he peed on is only one to two trees behind the tree in the further background of the video.

Based on what u have gathered, I believe that the tree he peed on is the one marked in the 3rd photo.

**IDEAS**:   
\- Create a video where I showcase my steps before building a toy-model such as preparing coffee to keep myself focused.

# CHAPTER 1 - General Context

Just like in my most recent posts, let's talk about the general context of this game.

We're Arnold, a something something year old guy who's been working for 36 hours straight, no sleep, he tried to tell his manager that he can't keep up with that rhythm *anymore*, but he was told that, if he was to stop working Fazbear would dock his payment and take his van. As seen in a paper pasted in a wall of his van we can see that Arnold's contract expires that very same year, 1979.

During a previous job Arnold was doing, Richie, another Fazbear employee, sneaked a Data Diver inside of Arnold's toolbox. These objects, the Data Divers, are the keys to the MCM facility, letting you open every door with the correct pass. Dispatch, apparently Arnold's boss and one of Fazbear's employees, sent Arnold on the mission to retrieve the Fazbear Property from the now abandoned Murray's Costume Manor. As we see in a paper we find in Arnold's van, this was due on September 7th 1979. Setting the game on that specific day. Talking about Dispatch, he seems to be the character whose voice would later become the voice of the enigmatic Handyman‚Äôs Robotics and Unit-Repair System Model 5, aka Hand-Unit from FNaF Sister Location.

Edwin Murray, the owner of Murray's Costume Manor, was a contractor of Fazbear Entertainment who signed a contract that let Fazbear own everything on his factory. Though at some point, Edwin went missing and now there's a rough and violent endoskeleton roaming around the factory.

As it turns out, this endoskeleton is known as ""Mimic"", it's capable of mimicking any voice and changing sizes to fit into any costume.

Now, Dispatch tells us more about this ""bothersome endoskeleton"" later on:

* It was built to keep Edwin's son entertained
* It was exposed to some sort of violence

And, at some point of the game, most likely after the events of the Chase with Jackie, the second attempt of Mimic to kill us, Dispatch is replaced with The Mimic, who also seems to want the blueprints of The Mimic.

# CHAPTER 2 - The Murray Family

Though in Five Nights at Freddy's we've been centered in 2 families for a long time (The Aftons and the Emilys) this game adds a third one. The Murray Family, we know 4 members of it:

* Senior Murray (Edwin's dad, who doesn't have a name)
* Edwin Murray
* Fiona Murray (Edwin's Wife)
* David Sean Murray (Edwin's Child)

Sometime ago, when Edwin worked at Senior Murray's place, he met Fiona while trying to get a voice actress for a project of his, project that ended up becoming Mrs. Helpful, at the time, Fiona was new at the place, but she quickly became friends with Edwin, we know all of this thanks to an audio log found in the Showrooms Lobby Office.

Thanks to an Audio Log found in the Loading Bay, specifically in an office, we know that Senior Murray died when Edwin was young, leaving him his company as a responsibility. Edwin didn't know what to do, but thanks to Fiona he decides to rebrand the place to Murray's Costume Manor, we know it wasn't called that way before since when we enter MCM at the very beginning of the game we hear Edwin say:

>Welcome, potential buyers, to Edwin Murray's Costume Manor -the leading powerhouse in customed entertainment and carnival technologies. Woo.  
***FNaF Secret of The Mimic - Dialogues - Edwin Murray***

There's also a model of MCM in Edwin's house, implying that the Factory was built by Edwin. With this in mind, in the Admin Wing, specifically in the Chica's Party World themed room we can find this image:

https://preview.redd.it/99pevo2tti9f1.png?width=940&format=png&auto=webp&s=1afab8fbc85768801dd3af27dafdc2a1db12768f

Murray's Costume Manor has been a thing since at least 1965, adding up how this paper implies that MCM has been around since before 1965, then it's been around since the early 1960s! After the opening of MCM, we know that Edwin, using Mr. Helpful, proposed to Fiona, who accepted and got married with Edwin. We don't know when, but we know that it was in the late 1960s because on December 6th 1970, David Sean Murray was born.

Now, you might be asking yourself ""where does the 'SEAN' thing come from?"" Well, as it turns out, these characters come directly from the book series ""Tales From the Pizzaplex"" where we're told the full name of David Murray, ""David Sean Murray"".

We know that David was born in December 6th because of this Mail Log found in the Admin Wing:

>To all Admin staff members. Mr. Murray's party has been canceled, due to the recent tragic events. Please do not enter the conference room until further notice. - Milton  
***FNaF Secret of The Mimic - Mail Logs - ""Admin - Dec 6th - 4:00 pm""***

And, in a previous log found in the Admin Wing as well, we're told that David's party was going to be at Saturday:

>To all employees, Mr. Murray has taken over conference room 1 for a surprise birthday party for his son. The old keycode will not work anymore, so please stop trying 53782. It's getting annoying. - Milton  
***FNaF Secret of The Mimic - Mail Logs - ""Admin - Dec 1st - 12:00 pm""***

So, in the 1970s, the only year that Dec 6th was a Saturday is 1975. + In Edwin's house we can find tapes of the different birthdays of David, this is the last one and the fifth birthday.

With all these quotes and informations in mind, to not get you lost, here's a recap:

* Edwin Murray and Fiona meet each other - early 60s
* Senior Murray dies and Edwin rebrands MCM - mid 60s
* Edwin Murray and Fiona get Married - late 60s
* David Sean Murray is born - Dec 6th 1970

So, with this made clear, we know how David's¬† birthdays went like with a lot of detail:

* David's first birthday, he was still a baby, but both Edwin and Fiona were there and he had a lot of presents, such as a Pirate Roxy Puppet and a White Tiger Doll, the three of them were all together as a happy family.
* On David's second birthday, Edwin was more focused on the job, not leaving enough time to spend with his family, trapped in his own ideas for the manor and in the job. Fiona tried to make him go to David's birthday but Edwin just kept working. That birthday Fiona gave David a ball he's going to play with for the rest of his short life.
* David's third birthday, it's just him and Edwin, Fiona is dead. Apparently it was recent since David had just found out that very day. That day, David's gift was a bunch of blocks with letters.
* David's fourth birthday was amazing, Edwin built him a whole playground right next to the factory! Though it was also next to the loading bay and his lawyers told him that it was very dangerous and risky to leave it there, Edwin insisted it was a good place. Oh, and apparently Fiona is somehow there.
* On David's fifth birthday, Edwin was preparing a surprise party in the Admin Wing for David, but he left David alone in the playground, unsupervised, ""Fiona"" had made a cake for David's special day... That day, David was found dead.

We know most of this because of the videos recorded by Edwin found in his mansion.

But¬† there are other mediums that tell us more about David's birthdays, such as the minigame ""Moon.EXE"" where we're shown 3 gifts:

* David Blocks - Gotten after defeating Jackie
* David's ball - Gotten after defeating Big Top
* The White Tiger Doll - Gotten after defeating Party Time Chica

Each of them with different statements, such as ""His third birthday present"" on the David Blocks, or ""His second birthday present"" on David's Ball or ""His first birthday present"" with the White Tiger Doll.

But... How did Fiona die? And how did she come back to life? Well...

In the BIg Top Showroom, just before we go to the roof access, we can find a Audio Log of Fiona:

>Ed, I hope this message reaches you as soon as you get a break. I have to go help the Fall Fest crew... just for a few days until the installation is finished. It's hard to explain... I just have this terrible feeling like I need to be there so nothing goes wrong... Just in case. Trisha will babysit David while I'm gone. I love you both and I'll be back next week.  
***FNaF Secret of The Mimic - Audio Logs - Big Top Showroom***

Fiona went to Fall Fest and then, as we can hear in a Audio Log in the Theatre:

>Why did you go? You weren't even supposed to be there. You were supposed to be here with me and David. Ugh! How am I supposed to tell David that his mother is gone? How am I supposed to raise a kid on my own? His life is ruined... My life is ruined.  
***FNaF Secret of The Mimic - Audio Logs - Theatre (Office)***

So, she went to Fall Fest, and died. Moon.EXE doesn't even try to hide how she died, it's pretty direct:

* There's a statue of a married couple, one has a bowtie and the other is the woman, who is burnt, this is found in a burnt house and just below the woman there's a Fall Fest Snowglobe.
* Next to the burnt house in ruins there's a burnt seamstress shop, Fiona is known to make Puppets btw.

This heavily implies Fiona died in the Fall Fest fire we've been teased since Help Wanted 1: Curse of Dredbear, this fire being set in late Fall 1973. But then, how did Fiona come back? In the workshop, when we're building a Captain Springlock Costume, we can find a audio log, a conversation between Edwin and David after his birthday:

>**Edwin**:¬†David. I want you introduce you to someone. This is M1.  
**David**:¬†Why does it look like that?  
**Edwin**:¬†Look like what?  
**David**:¬†It's scary.  
**Edwin**:¬†It's an endo skeleton. It won't always look like this. It'll wear fun costumes.  
**David**:¬†Like what?  
**Edwin**:¬†Anything you want. It can fit into any costume we've created. Think of it as your new babysitter. But it doesn't get paid and go home. It'll stay with us and help around the house.  
***FNaF Secret of The Mimic - Audio Logs - Workshop***

*The Mimic Model 1*, aka M1.

Why would Fiona return as Mimic and how? There's a very simple explanation, we know thanks to this audio log, because of the blueprints and because of Dispatch saying so, that The Mimic was made to keep David busy while Edwin worked, but then, thanks to this other audio log we know that Fiona was still alive somehow, her spirit was on the Manor:

>**Edwin**:¬†Recording... Test. Test. Levels are good. This is where I heard it. It's her, or someone that sounds like her. Set frequency to 4625...  
**Radio**:¬†(Static)  
**Edwin**:¬†Hello. Hello? Is anyone there? Over.  
**Radio**:¬†(Static)  
**Edwin**:¬†Say something. It's me, Edwin. Over.  
**Radio**:¬†(Static)  
**Fiona**:¬†That's great, honey, but you're missing the party.  
***FNaF Secret of The Mimic - Audio Logs - Basement 2***

Fiona's spirit was in the manor, and then, there's this note:

https://preview.redd.it/m0p9jmkvti9f1.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=f065963e8e0f3e7530b7b062ef1f27589c86cd2b

""Memory Error"" sounds quite... Robotic. Adding up how this is found in *Basement 1*, it seems like this could be a robot writing. But which? We see that it's written with a pencil and it's on a note, And the memory, the memory is quite familiar, expecting, having complications, family. It quite reminds me of *Fiona*. Adding up what it says at the end ""I will never sleep again"", reminds me of how there's literally a Moon head outside that room. There's also the whole Moon.EXE thing where the protagonist, who was the Baby Owl's best friend and ended up using a Baby Owl mask to deceive the moon, says at the very beginning, when we try to sleep ""You don't want to go to bed! Never again!"".

Before moving on, I have to explain something:

Sun is confirmed to represent Fiona in the fire ending and Moon is heavily implied to be Edwin; Moon being in the cave that connects to the workshop and has the pet vacuum cleaner Edwin made. Since Moon is supposed to represent Edwin, then the Baby Owl (which Moon seems to be attached to because when it sees the mask it begins to cry and it even has a statue of it in the cave) could represent David.

This is supported by what we say when we see the Baby Owl's statue, we will bring him back no matter what, and then we proceed to do the ending that turns M2 into David.

So, if the protagonist is David's friend and M1 was David's friend, then there is indeed a connection implied between M1 and not sleeping, and, since those memories are Fiona's, then it seems likely that this is the precise moment when M1 got possessed by Fiona. Which we know did happen since in David's 5th Birthday Video we see ""Fiona"", who is literally The Mimic. Edwin calls it Fiona and the subtitles call it Fiona too, so it does seem like Fiona is indeed possessing M1.

Which, I again have to add, is supported by how Fiona tells Edwin this:

>**Fiona**:¬†Edwin, you need to listen. I know you are excited, but you can't let them know about me. It's not safe. They wouldn't understand. Keep it between us for now.  
***FNaF Secret of The Mimic - Audio Logs - Edwin's House / Floor 1***

So it seems like she was indeed back.

Why would M1 go to B1? For the same reason Fiona felt the need to go to Fall Fest, something that some people might call fate, something that in the FNaF books is given the name of ""Zero Point Field"", which is basically the reason for why the FNaF Guards stay to work 5 nights, or why, in the books, a kid named Greg and his friends felt the need to go to a abandoned Freddy Fazbear's. This concept was presented in the Fazbear Frights books.

To keep y'all on board:

* Edwin Murray and Fiona meet each other - early 60s
* Senior Murray dies and Edwin rebrands MCM - mid 60s
* Edwin Murray and Fiona get Married - late 60s
* David Sean Murray is born - Dec 6th 1970
* David's first birthday, White Tiger Doll present - Dec 6th 1971
* David's second birthday, David's Ball present - Dec 6th 1972
* Fiona feels the need to help the Fall Fest crew and dies in the Fall Fest Fire - late Fall // November 1973
* David's third birthday, David Blocks present - Dec 6th 1973
* Edwin makes M1 to keep David busy while he works
* Edwin finds Fiona's ghost in the radio with the frequency of 4625
* M1 feels the need to go to B1 and gets possessed by Fiona in B1
* Edwin finds out Fiona is back, but Fiona tells him to keep it secret
* David's fourth birthday, Edwin gives David a playground next to the factory - Dec 6th 1974
* On David's fifth birthday, Edwin was preparing a surprise party in the Admin Wing for David, but he left David alone in the playground, unsupervised, Fiona had made a cake for David's special day... That day, David was found dead. - Dec 6th 1975

The timeline starts to get a little complex and big... Though this is nothing because, after David's death, Fiona began putting pressure in Edwin to make M2 as seen in the Audio Log found in the back of the Prototype Freddy's:

>**Fiona**:¬†Edwin, it doesn't make sense. It's terrible and there's no logic behind it. It happened and you have to deal with it. You did it before. We can fix things together. I am here to help.  
***FNaF Secret of The Mimic - Audio Logs - Back of Prototype Freddy's***

And thanks to a Audio Log found in Edwin's Office in MCM, we know that he was indeed working on M2, that he was indeed trying hard on it:

>**Edwin**:¬†Project update. I figured it out. There's a leak. Someone told them about M2. Well, they can't have it. Every copy has failed. I don't even know why it worked the first time, but it did. It's just not ready.  
***FNaF Secret of The Mimic - Audio Logs - Edwin's Office (MCM)***

So Edwin did want to make M2, Though he had been failing over and over again. Unlike M1, this was built fully to mimic David. Who Edwin didn't even know properly. Thanks to Fiona we know that M2 was originally just a copy of M1's program, but it could become more:

>Edwin, I am sending you a technician. He has your M2 blueprints as well as executive access. While the M2 began as a copy of my program, I believe it can become something more. It wasn't me. It was different. Somehow, it has been damaged and is malfunctioning.  
M2 can no longer be controlled. It will no longer listen. It mimics rage. It has done many bad things. No one who enters the MCM is safe.

With this in mind, Something went wrong with Edwin and Fiona, the more she gave pressure to Edwin, the more he woke up, she wasn't Fiona to him, she was just a robot, he had done a mistake:

>**Edwin**:¬†For the last time, NO. It wouldn't be him. Who am I kidding, you're not really you! Ugh, I've been so stupid.  
**Fiona**:¬†Edwin, calm down and give it some thought. Try again. Make another and we can all be together.  
**Edwin**:¬†All this time wasted! I should have been having fun with him, playing games and teaching him how to make things... But, I didn't. You. You! I let a machine raise my kid. You're not real. What was I thinking?!  
**Fiona**:¬†You do not mean that. It is me. I'm Fiona.  
**Edwin**:¬†Stop talking like her. You're not her. I never want to hear or even thing about you ever again. Ever!  
***FNaF Secret of The Mimic - Audio Logs - Edwin's House / Floor 2 (Glitched Door #2)***

What could happen next? Well... The Mechanical X-form Experimental Storage #1 wasn't created for nothing, Edwin didn't want to hear ""her"" ever again, and there's this machine that stores the M1 AI named F10-N4, it seems like what he did is store her AI, and maybe the endo too, into this machine.

And M2... Well, he suffered something... Bad.

>**Edwin**:¬†...Stop. You're not him. You're not! Stop sounding like him!  
***FNaF Secret of The Mimic - Audio Logs - Basement 2 (Post-Elevator)***

Edwin, after getting stressed over M2 mimicking David, destroyed it and, as stated by Fiona in the Prototype Freddy's, he hid himself in his home... Though there's something Fiona doesn't know about Edwin's whereabouts:

>**M2**:¬†Test test... Journal entry. Too bad. The new power test was a failure. Due to a minor... detonation, there is damage to my office interior as well as a small fire. Note to self. A portable cleaner that gets rid of smoke damage... Better yet, a Clown-O-Vac attachment.  
**Edwin**:¬†Help... M2. Respond. Emergency... Call for help.  
**M2**:¬†Daddy's busy, buddy. Why don't you go outside and play.  
**Edwin**:¬†Please. I can't move. I can't feel my legs...  
**M2**:¬†Speaking of legs. What do you think? I just finished mine. There are still a few kinks to work out...  
**Edwin**:¬†I'm... I'm sorry, M2. I... lost my temper. I was always going to fix you... Please... call for help... M2. Respond.  
**M2**:¬†Not right now, buddy. We can do something fun tomorrow. I promise. Ask your mom, if she's not busy.  
**Edwin**:¬†M2. Help...  
***FNaF Secret of The Mimic - Audio Logs - Edwin's Office (House)***

Edwin was coughing badly in a room on fire, after an explosion, he couldn't feel his legs and he was weak while M2 just did nothing but Mimic his actions, not wanting to help and think about projects. Edwin most likely died there, even though there's no corpse, the game makes very clear he died:

* Dispatch says he has gone silent on Fazbear communications
* Last time we heard of him he was weak in a room on fire, not capable of feeling his legs
* Edwin was alone in his house while all of that happened
* Edwin has nowhere to go

If Edwin survived then he had nowhere to go, he'd be very injured and he'd be somewhere no one would know he is, some people say that he is Sleepy Moon, but:

1. He can't feel his legs
2. Sleepy Moon makes mechanical sounds
3. Sleepy Moon is implied to be a Night Shift Starved MCM employee

Now, when was this?

Outside Murray's Costume Manor we can find a Mail Log that says:

>Hello! Here is your mail for today: Your mailbox is full. Last mail received five weeks ago: Foreclosure Notice. Please Respond Immediately.  
***FNaF Secret of The Mimic - Mail Logs - ""Mail - Aug 3rd""***

5 weeks before Aug 3 is late June. Edwin went missing in June. So yeah, this is it. At least for the Murray Family.

# CHAPTER 3 - The Fazbear Project

Thanks to many audio logs and the Prototype Freddy's on R&D we know that Murray's Costume Manor was working in a Fazbear Project, a restaurant.

We know that they've been working on it since Fiona was alive as seen in the Admin Wing:

>Welcome, repair crew,  
***FNaF Secret of The Mimic - Dialogues - Fiona ""Mrs. Helfpul""***

With this explained, this makes clear this has been a thing since at latest 1973, which makes very clear that this project was very old and had gone through many changes, specially considering how there's also the fact that originally, the main cast were made with Springlock Costumes and were:

* Fredbear
* Spring Bonnie
* Bub
* Monty (or just an alligator)

Which were almost finished after Fiona died, though, Fazbear did a last minute change replacing the springlocks with the Classic animatronics.

Some people say that the Classic animatronics were Fiona's designs, but the truth is, the animatronics with Fiona's designs were almost finished and later on we can find an audio log of Edwin being annoyed by the change of hearts on the Springlocks. Implying that the new designs, the Fazbear designs, were the Classic Animatronics.

Now, some people say that Fiona invented the Springlock Suits, which is not the case.

>Fiona, the new springlocks are working well, even with the water damage. They should be ready for the diner soon. I'll just make sure to warn Hen about some of the more... odd behaviors they might have.  
***FNaF Secret of The Mimic - Mail Logs - ""Springlocks""***

Fiona made ""NEW springlocks"".

Which also, this and another audio log we can find tell us that they had done many other jobs for Fazbear, one of them seems to be upgrading the Springlock Costumes for the Diner, what diner? ""Fredbear's Family Diner"".

So, between 1965 and 1973, Fazbear Entertainment opened Fredbear's Family Diner and hired MCM to upgrade the Springlock Costumes.

Which also reminds me that MCM did a job for Fredbear's Singin' Show, at least that's implied by the image of Fredbear's Singin' Show found in the Showrooms Lobby. So this also sets Fredbear's Singin' Show post-1960s, talking about Fredbear's Singin' Show, this reminds me of 2 things:

* There's a music record of Fredbear's Singin' Show, a record that looks like those popular since the 1950s, but the coin thingy on the disk was something added in the 1960s and used until the 80s.
* In Moon.EXE it's stated that it's a restaurant

So Fredbear's Singin' Show is at earliest from the 1960s and is a restaurant.

Ok, now what?

Well, there's the fact that Fazbear began threatening Edwin like a mere contractor when William, Henry and Edwin were apparently friends as stated in multiple audio logs, though Fiona nor Senior Murray trusted them.

>**Edwin**:¬†Edwin, never forget. They're behind it. Don't trust them. Never tell them. They want to destroy you. Dad was right.  
***FNaF Secret of The Mimic - Audio Logs - Storytime Showroom***  
\[...\]  
**Edwin**:¬†What the hell was that? They treat me like some contractor to crack a whip at. Fiona was right. They don't think of me as a friend anymore. This is the last project I ever do for them.  
***FNaF Secret of The Mimic - Audio Logs - Returns***

And then there's the Mail Logs showing us that Fazbear Entertainment was not only stealing MCM's employees, but also its information and having Edwin sign a contract leaving the rights of EVERYTHING in MCM to Fazbear Entertainment.

>..software development and the entire MCM catalog. We would love to keep you on as a lead engineer. Although we now technically own the land, we would never touch the house your parents built. We feel this offer has been more than fair, considering how far behind you are. It's just too much for you to handle alone. We are waiting for your response. - WA  
***FNaF Secret of The Mimic - Mail Logs - ""Confidential""***  
\[...\]  
We are almost there. I need the rest of the Murray staff contact info. The sooner the better. You get that for me, and I can sweeten the deal. How would you like to manage one of the new franchise locations? - W.A.  
***FNaF Secret of The Mimic - Mail Logs - ""Staff Contacts""***

Edwin knew Fazbear was stealing his stuff as seen in a audio log found in the Admin Wing:

>**Edwin**:¬†Attention traitors, admin wing permissions have been revoked. And no, you can't clear out your desks! You stole my work. Now your jackets, purses and coffee mugs and anything else belongs to me. Maybe I'll go find someone to sell your stuff to. How does that feel?  
***FNaF Secret of The Mimic - Audio Logs - Admin Wing***

Which 1+1 is two and we end up learning that, at least William, wanted to take down Murray, changing stuff and making Edwin fall off behind schedule, forcing him to give them the rights for MCM and make Fazbear Entertainment bigger.

With this in mind, we have a small timeline:

* Fredbear's Singin' Show is opened - 1960s
* Senior Murray dies and MCM is rebranded - mid 1960s
* Fredbear's Singin's Show hires MCM - late 60s/early 70s
* Fredbear's Family Diner opens and Fazbear hires MCM to upgrade the Springlocks
* Fiona makes new Springlock Suits - early 70s
* Fazbear hires MCM to make Freddy's and Fiona makes character designs
* Fiona dies - fall 1973
* Fazbear changes the characters to the Classic Animatronics - late 70s
* Edwin falls behind schedule and William comes into place to make him sign a contract to give Fazbear the rights of everything from his house to MCM.
* Edwin dies - June 1979

Which brings me to something very, very important.

Going out of bounds we can find a lake that is 1:1 with the Curse of Dredbear red lake, why does this matter? Because from there we can see the Afton house, which is set in the exact same spot as Murray's house. Reminding me that David's bedroom has a closet that is 1:1 with the FNaF 4 closet and it has a purple phone, the same phone that Crying Child is shown to have in FNaF 4.

And remember the FNaF Movie? You know, where William keeps Garrett's air plain and gives it to his daughter. Well, this is the exact same thing. Edwin was one of William's victims, not a literal murder, but William stole everything from him and, as stated in the ""Confidential"" Mail Log, William also owns the land of MCM, land that goes all the way to Murray's house and, as seen in FNaF VR: Help Wanted, where we see a terrain very similar to the one I've been talking about this whole time, we can see how the Pizzaplex is being built around the same spot where Murray's Costume Manor was, which also implies that Freddy Fazbear's Pizza Place, the FFPS location was built close.

Since I believe that Freddy Fazbear's Pizza Place was a repurposed Fredbear's, then Fredbear's should also be close to MCM, and what do we see in SOTM? Many Fredbear's Pizza boxes ALL OVER MCM. So, rather the employees left MCM, drove a LOOOONG road to Fredbear's and then came back, or, Fredbear's is close to MCM, let's say... On the very same road that connects Murray's home with MCM?

# CHAPTER 4 - The Manor

Thanks to many papers and mail logs we can find all over the manor, we know a lot of the Manor's Story, starting off by¬† the orders:

* The Mycellium Men were ordered in May 4th 1973 and were received back in November 4th 1973
* Hudgies Hedgehog was ordered in March 18th 1974 and received in May 18th 1974
* On Oct. 10th 1976 ""Internal"" ordered a costume. with ""Iconic Smile"", it was received in Jan. 10th 1977
* On Jan. 24th 1977 Best Birthday Co. ordered a costume with ""expressive tonge""; it was received on March 24th 1977.

Which, I mean, there doesn't seem to be any problem with them. They just explain and add stuff to the lore, details, though not relevant, they're still details. Now, on April 4th 1974, bringing your child to work was cancelled in MCM due to a previous accident happening there. At first I thought ""Right! That's when David died!"" but David not only died on December 6th, but also, on his fifth birthday, aka in 1975.

So, this is just Edwin deciding not to do Bring Your Child to Work Day.

With this said, I have to mention the Group Chats; through the manor we can find Mailboxes with Group Chat messages, since Edwin didn't use those mailboxes on a long time and, adding up how this is implied to be around the time Edwin was using the Theater then it seems like this is around the late 70s.

Let me explain.

In Group Chat #5 We see a person named Ralph, trapped in the doll hospital because the doors aren't working, which reminds me of the log about Ralph getting injured because of the Captain Springlock Suit. Which already gives us a timeline:

* Edwin uses the Theater to create MCM Television Studio of the Future, creating an AI capable of writing, adding commercials, designing and keeping the show on track, together with a fake audience. One of the example shows produced by Edwin was a show about Foxy giving his captain a surprise Party.
* Late night shenanigans were stopped by Edwin because of a show template Edwin was working on there, those shenanigans were causing the projectors to not work properly.
   * FNaF Secret of The Mimic - Audio Logs - Theater
* Employees begin to use the Mail Boxes all over the Manor to communicate with each other, after all, Edwin hasn't used them in a LOOOOONG time.
   * FNaF Secret of The Mimic - Mail Logs - ""Group Chat #1""
   * FNaF Secret of The Mimic - Mail Logs - ""Group Chat #2""
   * FNaF Secret of The Mimic - Mail Logs - ""Group Chat #3""
   * FNaF Secret of The Mimic - Mail Logs - ""Group Chat #4""
* Ralph was an employee at Murray's Costume Manor, he worked there on the Theater, using the Captain Springlock Suit, but he constantly got injured for using it. In one of Ralph's many injuries, he ends up trapped in the Recycling Center because the doors aren't working properly.
   * FNaF Secret of The Mimic - Mail Logs - ""Theater - One more injury?""
   * FNaF Secret of The Mimic - Mail Logs - ""Group Chat #5""
* Because of the many incidents going on in the theater and the many injuries left by the Captain Springlock Suit, many employees began moving to Fazbear Entertainment, who was stealing MANY of Edwin's employees and offering a bonus payment for those who brought more with them, one of the employees that moved to Fazbear is Gary from the Recycling Center. Fazbear also had leakers inside MCM as Admins, telling them everything, including telling them about M2. One of the leakers¬† was told that he could become a manager for the new restaurant project Fazbear was working on.
   * FNaF Secret of The Mimic - Mail Logs - ""Moving On!""
   * FNaF Secret of The Mimic - Mail Logs - ""Staff Contacts""
   * FNaF Secret of The Mimic - Audio Logs - Edwin's Office (MCM)

We know that employees began leaving because of the theater because we find the Mail Log ""Moving On!"" in the Theater itself. Which connects with the leak of the existence of M2 and Afton stealing Murray's employees. Which sets this in the mid to late 70s and this actually also sets another incident in the mid to late 70s, you see, Moon's head from the Storytime Showroom fell down from the second floor down to B1, when? Idk, but it was after Edwin began doing stuff in the theatre.

So, continuing with this in mind, after Fazbear hired MCM to make the Restaurant, Edwin and Fiona planned to do a ""Employee Appreciation Program"", adding a whole new section to MCM, leaving room for any employee to have his own office they can decorate and be happy with.

Though we know it didn't happen since that's not seen in the game, but what we DO see in-game is how MCM was going through renovations and was temporarily closed when Edwin went missing, it seems like he wanted to remove the playground and expand on the side of MCM as seen with the many X and Circles around the side of MCM and the heavy machinery around the playground. It seems like Edwin did begin to make the ""Employee Appreciation Program"" shortly before going missing, but it was stopped because, oh, Murray went bankrupt.

We can see that he went bankrupt in:

* Edwin's Office (MCM)
* In the Ride to Edwin's house, Mr. Helpful tells us that Edwin is bankrupt

So, yeah.

This brings me to... The Recycling Center!

You see, from what we're told, this was something that we know happened before David died, since employees like Barbara and Milton were working on the Furnace as seen in the computer found in there and, when we get the Admin Upgrade, Mr. Helpful tells us that, when they add properly Dollie, the Admins would be moved back to the Admin Wing, which we know, was the case by the time of David's birthday.

This leaves a mini timeline of:

1960s

* MCM is opened
* Edwin makes the world's first recycling center, taking non-functional animatronics and turning them into something new, ""trash to cash"" in his own words. There was an energy quota to reach per-day at the recycling center and had to keep the furnace on every night, all night. The Admins worked in charge of that place, such as Gary and Milton Z. who curiously had a very low time card and was found on a red flag.

1970s

* Edwin Murray creates Dollie! An animatronic capable of doing their work in the recycling center. Making them slowly return to the Admin Wing.
   * FNaF Secret of The Mimic - Mail Logs - ""I can't take it""

With this said, now I can move on to R&D!

Since in the Admin Wing, shortly before getting the last upgrade, the Executive Upgrade, we see a note on someone's desk, it turns out, R&D was opened in July 21st 197X (the number is faded out, but it looks like a 5 at the end), the employees had a party down there, but Marco Salmon, an admin, went down there and peed over the new equipment, which led to him getting fired in July 24th 1975.

Also, Fun Fact: In the Workshop, when we're building the Captain Springlock Suit, there's a note that says ""- Don't forget meeting at 2 on monday"" and July 21st 1975 is a Monday, implying that post-it was talking about the Admin party in R&D.

With this in mind, now that we have a date for that, we know that Fiona worked on the restaurant project,¬† thanks to a previously shown quote and because the Springlock Suits are Fiona's designs. But if R&D was made in 1975, then that means that the whole Prototype Freddy's thing was done in 1975. This isn't a problem though, Fiona could've designed the characters years before R&D was finished and R&D could've been in production since the early 70s.

There are also a few other details such as: Edwin purposely misspelled ""Mycelium"" with ""Mycellium"" on the Mycellium Men. Moving on to some more minor details, there are these Mail Logs to explain (outside of those connected to another mystery I'll talk about more in Part 2 and those about Team O12):

* ""Sales Pitch"" & ""Sales Pitch - Rejected""
* ""Locators""
* ""Waste of Money""

Sales Pitch basically talks about Bob doing a suggestion, nothing really relevant, at least not until we get to the *other* two Mail Logs.

>Can someone please mark where we're supposed to go down there? Bob went down and I haven't seen him in days.  
***FNaF Secret of The Mimic - Mail Logs - ""Locators""***  
\[...\]  
None of this makes sense. Mr. Murray told us to trash all the old equipment in the wood shop. Then Stevenson gets a purchase order for the exact same stuff we're throwing out and told to install it upstairs. The old stuff is all perfectly functional. It's a waste of money. So, Stevenson asks him about it and gets fired. He has to be out by the end of the day. My advice is keep your mouth shut. Don't even think about it. Just clear out the tunnels.  
***FNaF Secret of The Mimic - Mail Logs - ""Waste of Money""***

Two questions, what are ""the tunnels""? And why did Bob, a person stated to be from marketing and someone who had access to the Admin Wing be in Basement 2?

Actually, if you didn't thought of this previously, when we come out of the elevator we're in a room before the basement itself, it's supposed to be connected to another elevator that leaves us in floor 1, but the door connecting them was broken and is now covered by a bunch of wood and yellow tape. Why? Curiously it's in that very room where Edwin supposedly beat up M2.

Here's when I bring up a previous audio log found right after we fall down a vent after going through Edwin's Office in MCM:

>**Edwin**:¬†Attention all personnel. The power surges have become more... frequent. Please use extreme caution when venturing down into the tunnels.  
***FNaF Secret of The Mimic - Audio Logs - Elevator Room (Loading Bay - B2)***

Curious how he mentions ""the tunnels"" here, because he seems to be referring to Basement 2, which seems to imply that Murray wanted to clear out the tunnels. Why? Well, when exploring it out we find not only a few pieces of heavy equipment but also a few graffities with ""X"".

https://preview.redd.it/a13pb7dfui9f1.png?width=4138&format=png&auto=webp&s=f809dc20aae3aa7c2d2297c9d20ff8becd4d2f1c

Which seems to indicate that Edwin wanted to renovate Murray's Costume Manor's Basement 2. But why was it blocked with wood? Well, remember that very room being where M2 was destroyed by Edwin? Well, that's it! Edwin locked the room quickly with wood!

Now, you might be thinking, this should be it, right? Well... There's one more character.

*Ralph*, one of the MCM employees from the Theatre thingy, he worked using the Captain Springlock Suit for this Puppet Show that has *Foxy* and we first learn about Ralph in a Mail Log found in the very same room where we can find a Fredbear's Singin' Show Music Record. This is very clearly meant to be The Phone Guy, why specifically Phone Guy? Well...

1. Phone Guy's favorite animatronic was stated to be ***Foxy*** in FNaF 2 and in The Week Before
2. Phone Guy was experienced with the Springlock suits, at least enough to make training tapes about them.
3. Phone Guy's name was revealed to be Ralph in The Week Before

Connecting these two characters perfectly! So... Now what?

I‚Äôve been dealing with persistent bloating that doesn‚Äôt match the rest of my body for years and I have always just held my tummy in but I can n longer ignore it. I‚Äôve always been slim, and lately I‚Äôve gotten leaner and more muscular from working out ‚Äî but my stomach hasn‚Äôt changed and even looks bigger in contrast to my limbs and this made me realize something is not adding up. 

Two days ago I had a home-cooked meal of steak, fries, and pepper sauce ‚Äî something I eat often with no issues. But this time I added a lot of garlic powder to the fries, and a few hours later I became extremely bloated and constipated, worse than usual. That was the only change in the meal. I couldnt even burp or pass gas comfortably. I was at least twice as bloated as usual. I looked pregnant. I‚Äôm still pretty constipated two days later although I‚Äôve tried to go. The extreme bloating was also very painful. 

I usually use a lot of fresh garlic and some onion in my cooking, and I‚Äôve noticed I also eat a lot of dairy. I suspect these might be my triggers, maybe not the dairy though but I would want to evaluate it, because I eat so much of them on a daily basis. 

Rather than starting a full FODMAP elimination, would it be possible for me to just cut garlic and onion for now ‚Äî replacing them with infused oils ‚Äî and see how my symptoms respond? If that helps, I could then test dairy next by switching to lactose-free products and keep going as I test out removing various fodmap foods to see if it makes a difference. 

Also in case it‚Äôs relevant I‚Äôve had very high stress the last few years (I‚Äôm working on it) and sometimes when I wake up my stomach would b e upset (morning anxiety I guess) and when I‚Äôd have an anxious moment my stomach would turn immediately and I‚Äôd need the bathroom. I would be swinging between constipated and diarrhea all the time. I‚Äôm less anxious now so way less upset stomach / diarrhea but the constipation continues when I don‚Äôt get enough fiber. Also apples, coffee would upset my stomach. This all still happens to me but it‚Äôs much less intense since reducing my stress a bit but now I m still dealing with on and off constipation, no pain (except the garlic powder incident) but varying levels of bloat / constipation / gas continue. The garlic thing was the first time I could truly pinpoint a likely cause.

Ticker: $AMPX
Current Price: around $4
Market Cap: around $400m
TLDR: Amprius makes silicon anode batteries that destroy traditional lithium-ion cells in every performance metric. They‚Äôre already shipping to defense and aerospace clients (think drones, UAVs, etc.) And if they break into EVs? 

Why AMPX Isn‚Äôt Just Battery Hopium

Let‚Äôs get this out of the way first:
Amprius makes silicon anode lithium batteries.
Not fancy-sounding ‚Äúsolid state‚Äù science projects that need 7 more years in a lab‚Äîthese batteries actually work, are in production, and are already in the field.

Here‚Äôs how they stack up vs. traditional lithium-ion (graphite anode) cells: 

Energy Density: 2x traditional lithium
Charge Time: as low as 6 minutes 
Weight: 50% lighter 
Cycle Life: This is the theoretical problem with silicon anodes which has stopped them from being mass-produced. Amprius has figured out a way to get 500 cycles and it‚Äôs been improving.

If you want longer range, lighter aircraft, faster charge, and a power source that doesn‚Äôt need its own backpack, you want this.

These are not hypothetical specs. Drone manufacturers are already using them. Reddit reviews say that these batteries are blowing peoples minds.

WHY NOW: UAVs, Defense Spending, and a War-Obsessed World

Let‚Äôs talk macro: The world is falling apart and every major power is funneling cash into defense tech like it‚Äôs 1942.

UAVs and drones are so hot right now. They are the future of war. Read the many DDs of drone companies all over Reddit.

Drones need light, dense, ultra-fast-charging batteries.
	
US Defense Dept. has already awarded Amprius contracts.

‚ÄúWe need 500 Wh/kg batteries for tactical edge UAVs.‚Äù
-The Pentagon, probably

AMPX is already delivering to Department of Defense contractors. They‚Äôre ramping production, and desperately trying to get enough manufacturing capacity to fulfill demand.

Add:
Rising global tension (Middle east, China, Ukraine)
Shift toward electrification of everything in combat
Near-term demand for lightweight, high-performance batteries

And you‚Äôve got the perfect storm for Amprius to dominate military battery tech.

And what if‚Ä¶EVs? 

Silicon anode batteries are the holy grail of EVs.
Double the range
Half the weight
Full charge while you refill your coffee.

EV makers are all chasing new battery technology. Tesla has talked about it for years, and other OEMs are investing billions in R&D.

But guess what?

Amprius already cracked it. They just need scale.

Their roadmap includes expansion into automotive-scale production by 2026‚Äì2027. They‚Äôre currently sampling cells to automakers, and pilot programs are underway.

This is the classic ‚Äúpicks and shovels‚Äù play. catch them before they hit the big leagues.

And they have actual sales: This Ain‚Äôt a Science Fair Project

Revenue is already ramping:
Q1 2024: Revenue up 225% YoY
Multiple new clients added in aerospace, drones, and defense

2025 and 2026 will be inflection years as new facilities go online.

Also: Insiders are NOT selling.
In fact, there‚Äôve been multiple buys and strategic investments in recent months.

This is not a penny stock with vaporware. This is a real company, shipping a real, game-changing product, with:
Massive tailwinds from global defense spending
A potential EV expansion catalyst
Crazy asymmetric upside from a sub-$500M market cap
And oh yeah‚Ä¶ they have no meaningful competition. There are a couple other companies trying to crack silicon but Amprius already has.

THE RISKS (Because I‚Äôm probably a Degenerate)
Production scale risk: Can they actually build enough?
Competition: Big dogs like Tesla/Panasonic could play catch-up
Battery industry is cutthroat and capex-heavy
Still not profitable (this is Reddit, do we care?)

But remember, we‚Äôre early. Like pre-Model S Tesla early.

Buy a few shares. Forget about them. Come back when your fridge has a drone delivering your groceries, and it‚Äôs powered by Amprius.



Positions: Long (obviously)
Not financial advice. I‚Äôm just a degenerate with a dream and a battery pack

1lm2ch4,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1lm2ch4/my_wedding_revenge_on_his_first_love/,My Wedding Revenge on His First Love:,"Aylin Matthews, the wild and untamable heiress, and Ronan Hoffman, the icy billionaire who once claimed to be her antidote, are entangled in a web of passion and deceit. When Aylin discovers Ronan‚Äôs obsession with his first love‚ÄîEliza‚Äîshe shatters, only to learn Eliza is her stepmother‚Äôs daughter, now usurping her place in the family. Betrayed on all fronts, Aylin strikes a deal to marry a dying heir, vowing revenge. But as secrets unravel and loyalties blur, one question remains: will she burn the world down‚Äîor be consumed by the flames herself?

# Chapter 1 - A Deal with Frost and Fire

Aylin Matthews was known in their circle as a bewitching siren, her crimson lips perpetually curved in a teasing smirk, her gaze dripping with allure.

Ronan Hoffman was the golden heir of high society‚Äîuntouchable, composed, and radiating icy restraint.

No one could have guessed these two opposites would lose themselves in the backseat of a Maybach under cover of darkness, tangled together in the restroom of a charity gala, or pressed against the floor-to-ceiling windows of a private vineyard, her waist gripped as he drove into her until her legs shook.

After another reckless night, the sound of running water echoed from the bathroom.

Aylin propped herself against the headboard and dialed her father.

""I‚Äôll marry the Windsor family‚Äôs dying heir for their last-ditch effort to save him‚Äîbut on one condition...""

The voice on the other end crackled with barely contained glee. ""Name it! Anything, as long as you go through with the wedding!""

""We‚Äôll discuss it in person when I get home."" Her tone was airy, but her eyes were frost.

She hung up and reached for her clothes, then froze at the sight of Ronan‚Äôs open laptop nearby.

A WhatsApp notification glowed on the screen‚Äîfrom a contact named Eliza.

\[Ronan, the thunder‚Äôs so loud‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm scared‚Ä¶\]

Aylin‚Äôs fingers clenched.

The bathroom door swung open. Ronan emerged, water sliding down his collarbone, his shirt hanging open‚Äîrestraint edged with lazy arrogance.

""Work emergency. I need to go."" He snatched his jacket, voice still detached.

Aylin‚Äôs lips curled. ""Work‚Äîor your precious first love?""

Ronan frowned. ""What?""

""Nothing."" She slid off the bed barefoot, pale feet sinking into the plush carpet.

His eyes darkened as his thumb brushed her swollen lips. ""Behave. Don‚Äôt start trouble.""

The door clicked shut. Aylin‚Äôs smile died.

She called a car and tailed him.

Thirty minutes later, the vehicle halted outside a hotel. Through the rain-blurred window, Aylin watched Eliza‚Äîclad in a white sundress‚Äîdart from the lobby.

Ronan strode forward, shrugging off his suit jacket to wrap around her shoulders before scooping her into his arms.

""You‚Äôll catch cold like this.""

The motion was practiced, effortless.

Aylin‚Äôs grip on the door handle turned white-knuckled.

As Ronan carried Eliza inside, a memory flashed‚Äîtheir first meeting.

Back then, her relationship with her father was explosive. After she‚Äôd smashed a vase over his head, he‚Äôd shipped her off to be ""tamed"" by an old friend‚Äôs son‚Äîto curb her spoiled heiress antics.

Their first encounter had been in Ronan‚Äôs office atop the Hoffman Group skyscraper, his gold-rimmed glasses framing eyes like frozen steel.

She‚Äôd had no intention of playing nice.

So she‚Äôd rebelled.

Day one: coffee spilled on his six-figure Italian suit. Ronan had barely glanced at the stain. ""Charge it to the Matthews account.""

Day two: shredded meeting documents. He‚Äôd recited the entire presentation from memory, leaving the board slack-jawed.

Day three: spiked his coffee, planted a camera for blackmail.

Instead, she‚Äôd become his antidote.

When she‚Äôd woken sore and furious the next morning, he‚Äôd pinned her against the window and taken her again.

""Aylin,"" he‚Äôd growled against her ear. ""Behave.""

That single utterance of her name had shattered her.

No one had called her that since her mother‚Äôs death.

After that, everything shifted.

Every tantrum ended with Ronan hauling her into his office‚Äîoutsiders assuming she was being disciplined, when in truth, he‚Äôd bend her over the desk until her knees buckled.

Slowly, she‚Äôd realized she craved it.

Was he just that skilled? Or was she just that starved for connection?

She didn‚Äôt know.

All she knew was‚Äîshe was in over her head.

# Chapter 2 - A Night of Broken Promises

Roses, candlelight, music‚Äîeven an engagement ring had been prepared.

But Aylin waited all night, until the candles burned out and the roses wilted, and he never showed.

It wasn‚Äôt until 3 a.m. that her phone buzzed with a breaking news alert‚Äî

\#Billionaire Heir Reunites with First Love at Midnight#

In the photo, Ronan Hoffman was gently helping a girl in a white evening gown into his car, his gaze unbearably tender.

The comments exploded:

‚ÄúOMG, the power couple we didn‚Äôt know we needed! Obsessed.‚Äù

‚ÄúWait‚Äîisn‚Äôt that Ronan and Eliza? They were the golden couple back in college!‚Äù

‚ÄúI can confirm! Ronan was ice-cold to everyone except Eliza! If she hadn‚Äôt gone abroad for health reasons, they‚Äôd be married by now.‚Äù

Her phone clattered to the floor.

Aylin couldn‚Äôt believe her eyes.

If Ronan had always loved someone else, then what was she? Just a convenient distraction?

Hands trembling, she dialed Ronan‚Äôs number, desperate for an explanation‚Äîbut the call wouldn‚Äôt go through.

After the last failed attempt, she set her phone down and walked into the one room Ronan had always forbidden her from entering: his study.

The moment she pushed the door open, she froze as if struck by lightning.

The walls were covered in photos of Eliza.

Graduation portraits, vacation snapshots, even candid shots of her sleeping.

Ronan, the man who prided himself on self-control, had done something like this.

An answer wasn‚Äôt even necessary anymore.

Aylin suddenly laughed, the sound hollow and jarring in the empty room.

Then the tears came‚Äîhot, furious‚Äîrolling down her sharp jawline and splashing onto the floor.

With red-rimmed eyes, she tore through the entire penthouse.

When Ronan returned the next day, he surveyed the wreckage with eerie calm, simply instructing the staff to clean it up.

He didn‚Äôt even glance at her, as if her outburst was nothing out of the ordinary.

Aylin watched numbly as the maid swept away the engagement ring she had painstakingly chosen.

He didn‚Äôt know what was in that box.

Didn‚Äôt know she had wanted to spend the rest of her life with him.

And he certainly didn‚Äôt know that the moment that ring hit the trash, she decided she was done loving him.

‚ÄúMiss Matthews, where would you like to go?‚Äù The driver‚Äôs voice snapped her back to reality.

‚ÄúHome,‚Äù Aylin said coldly, opening her eyes. ‚ÄúTake me to the Matthews estate.‚Äù

The moment she stepped inside, her father rushed forward. ‚ÄúAylin, is it true? You‚Äôll marry into the Vanderbilt family?‚Äù

On the staircase, her stepmother watched eagerly.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs true,‚Äù Aylin said, her voice icy. ‚ÄúBut I told you there‚Äôs a condition.‚Äù

‚ÄúName it!‚Äù

‚ÄúI want‚Äî‚Äù She enunciated each word. ‚ÄúTo cut ties with you. Permanently.‚Äù

The air turned to ice.

Dean Matthews‚Äô face darkened. ‚ÄúHave you lost your mind? Do you even hear yourself?‚Äù

‚ÄúPerfectly.‚Äù Her tone was glacial. ‚ÄúYou cheated on Mom, drove her to suicide just to make room for this woman. The day she jumped, I stopped seeing you as my father.‚Äù

She stared at his ashen face. ‚ÄúThe Vanderbilt heir is on death‚Äôs door, and you‚Äôve hounded me for three months. If I refused, would you have dragged me there by force?‚Äù

Her lips curled in a bitter smile. ‚ÄúMight as well make it official. Bring your mistress‚Äôs daughter home‚Äîlet her be the new Matthews heiress.‚Äù

Dean trembled with rage. ‚ÄúFine! Consider it done! But the Vanderbilt boy might not last the month‚Äîyou‚Äôre getting married before the end of it!‚Äù

He sneered. ‚ÄúAs for Sophia‚Äôs daughter, she‚Äôs been back from Europe for days, staying at a hotel. Since you‚Äôre so eager to step aside, she‚Äôs moving in tomorrow!‚Äù

Aylin laughed, her heart twisting painfully. ‚ÄúPaying for another man‚Äôs woman, disowning your own flesh and blood‚Äîyou‚Äôre one of a kind.‚Äù

She turned to leave, but Sophia Carter stepped into her path with false concern. ‚ÄúAylin, you shouldn‚Äôt speak to your father like that.‚Äù

Aylin stopped dead.

# Chapter 3 - A Venomous Reckoning

She stepped closer, her voice laced with venom. ""Listen carefully, Carmen‚Äîeven in death, my mother will always be remembered as the rightful wife, while you'll forever be the hated mistress. And no matter how hard your precious daughter pretends to be the Matthews heiress, she'll never wash away the shame of having a gold-digger for a mother!""

Carmen's face went deathly pale as she stumbled back.

Aylin turned sharply and walked away, each step like treading on shattered glass.

Only when she slammed her bedroom door behind her did she collapse against it, sliding to the floor and burying her face in her knees, utterly drained.

The next morning, the sound of moving furniture and cheerful chatter drifted up from downstairs.

""What the hell is going on?"" She threw open her door. ""Some of us are trying to sleep!""

The butler, Harold, hesitated. ""Miss Aylin... Miss Eliza has moved in...""

Before he could finish, a familiar figure appeared at the top of the stairs‚Äî

Eliza stood there in a white lace dress, delicate and fragile.

Aylin's blood ran cold.

She never could have guessed that the daughter her stepmother had shipped abroad for ""health reasons"" all these years was none other than Ronan's first love.

The universe had played the cruelest trick on her.

The next moment, Eliza approached with a sickly sweet smile. ""Sister, I'm so sorry we woke you‚Äî""

Before she could finish, Aylin slammed the door in her face.

""Aylin! Have you lost your mind?"" Dean's furious shout echoed from the hallway. ""Pack your things! Eliza wants this room‚Äîit's hers now!""

Aylin let out a bitter laugh and immediately started pulling clothes from her closet.

Muffled voices filtered through the door‚Äî

""Uncle Dean, is Sister angry with me?"" Eliza's voice dripped with fake concern.

""Don't pay her any attention. She's been spoiled since the day she was born.""

""But...""

""Don't worry. She'll be married off to the Winstons soon. This house will belong to you and your mother.""

Aylin's hands froze for just a second before her smirk widened.

She quickly booked a flight to the Winston estate for the end of the month and resumed packing.

Half an hour later, she wheeled her suitcase out of the room.

In the living room, Dean, Carmen, and Eliza lounged on the sofa, snacking on grapes and croissants while watching TV‚Äîa perfect picture of domestic bliss.

Aylin strode past them without a glance.

""Stop right there!"" Dean snapped. ""Where do you think you're going? Don't forget our deal!""

""Relax. I keep my word."" She didn't even turn around. ""But I won't spend the next two weeks suffocating in this house.""

She checked into the city's most luxurious penthouse suite.

In the days that followed, Aylin went on a shopping spree‚Äî

She bought the most extravagant wedding gown, splashed out on vintage jewelry at auctions for her dowry.

Even if this marriage was just a transaction, she would walk down that aisle like royalty.

Her phone buzzed nonstop in her purse. She ignored it until she'd bought the final diamond necklace.

Thirty-eight missed calls‚Äîall from Dean.

The moment she answered, his furious voice exploded through the speaker. ""Have you lost your damn mind?! Three billion in one day?! Are you trying to ruin me?!""

""What's the hurry?"" Her laugh was icy. ""Once I marry into the Winston family, you'll have fifty billion coming your way.""

""But that money isn't here yet! If you keep this up, the company will be bankrupt by tomorrow!""

Aylin smirked.

That was the whole point.

She had already arranged for the Winston fortune to be wired straight into her private account.

Then she'd sit back and watch how long Eliza and her scheming mother would cling to a washed-up old man with nothing left.

Did they really think everyone was as naive as her mother? The woman who had slaved beside Dean from nothing, worked herself sick, only to be driven to suicide.

The thought of her mother sent a sharp pang through her chest.

Her phone buzzed again‚Äîa text from Ronan:

\[What's the drama now? Why didn't you show up at the office today?\]

She stared at the message for a long moment.

For the past year, under Ronan's so-called ""guidance,"" she had reported to his company like a dutiful employee.

But now that she was getting married, what right did he have to order her around?

When she returned to the hotel, arms full of shopping bags, she found her luggage dumped in the lobby.

""What is this?"" she demanded coldly.

At least 90% of our time together is spent at work, very rarely outside. And when it is outside of work, it's always within a group setting. Even at work it's a group setting (we work in a kitchen with several other co-workers) She's referred to our relationship as a friendship before, but this struck (and still does strike) me as strange. I've felt that we aren't really friends because we've never had ""one-on-one"" time to really get to know each other. And this to me seems absolutely basic to forming a real friendship. I've invited her out twice within about an 8 month period to just go for lunch, coffee, just to hangout, etc. Both times she declined and said she has a ""personal rule to not hang out with one guy alone"". I don't know what her reasoning is, it's honestly not my business and I've never asked (though I assume it has something to do with her romantic relationship). Whatever her reasons, I can't see a friendship happening if a more one-on-one bonding development doesn't start in our relationship to each other. Anyway, I've been thinking a lot about what's needed in order to allow a friendship to grow, and like I've eluded to, group settings will only allow for very surface-level connection, it seems to me.
Am I wrong? Can something actually come from this? This is less of a plea to get a friend and more of a philosophical curiosity. And it could honestly be differences in what her and I consider to be friendships. Just curious to get some other perspectives. Thanks in advance! ",1,1751051310.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False

# What Our Mission Statement Means to Us ‚Äì Davis Insurance Associates

by Brad Davis, CIC

# In a Nutshell

Our mission is simple:¬†**‚ÄúTo be the most trusted insurance agency in the Grand Strand.‚Äù**¬†Every quote we prepare, every policy we recommend, and every conversation we have is measured against that single promise. If a course of action strengthens your trust in us, we do it‚Äîperiod. If it doesn‚Äôt, we pass, rethink, or find a better way.

Visit our¬†[ABOUT US(opens in new tab)](https://thinkdavisinsurance.com/about/)¬†page for more about Davis Insurance Associates.

# Why a Mission Statement Should Fit on a Post-it

Mission statements sometimes read like corporate word salad ‚Äì long on buzzwords, short on usefulness. We went in the opposite direction. By keeping ours to eleven words, we created a daily yardstick instead of a dusty plaque. ‚ÄúMost trusted‚Äù is the outcome; ‚Äúin the Grand Strand‚Äù is the community we call home. Everything else is the roadmap.

# Trust Over Transactions

1. **Honesty, even when it stings.**¬†We‚Äôll tell you if a wind-hail deductible is creeping up or if your deck needs an update to stay insurable.
2. **Options, not ultimatums.**¬†We show multiple carriers, limits, and deductibles, then walk through pros & cons in plain English.
3. **Education first.**¬†A client who understands their coverage is a client empowered to make smart choices ‚Äì exactly the kind of partner we want.

# How the Mission Shows Up Before 9 A.M.

A grand statement is worthless unless it leaves the conference room and clocks in for work. Here‚Äôs how ours starts working before the first pot of coffee finishes brewing.

|Daily Moment|Mission-Driven Action|Benefit to You|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Morning Quote Reviews**|We double-check replacement-cost values and compare to coverage limits.|Helps prevents underinsurance surprises at claim time.|
|**Carrier Updates**|We keep a live spreadsheet of each carrier‚Äôs appetite & rate filings.|No one wastes time on carriers unlikely to approve or fairly price your policy.|
|**Team Huddle**|We share a ‚ÄúTrust Win‚Äù and ‚ÄúTrust Opportunity‚Äù from the previous day.|Continuous feedback loop keeps us improving.|

# Putting ‚ÄúTrusted‚Äù to the Test in Real-Life Scenarios

# 1. When the Cheapest Isn‚Äôt the Best

A new homeowner in Surfside Beach asked us to match an online quote that was $280 cheaper per year. We showed him that the bargain policy carried an¬†**ACV roof endorsement**‚Äîmeaning his 12-year-old roof would have been valued like a 12-year-old roof, not a new one, at claim time. We lost that sale ‚Äì but six weeks later, after a summer hailstorm, he called back and asked us to rewrite his coverage. Sometimes trust means letting revenue walk out the door.

# 2. When a Claim Gets Messy

Past hurricanes along the Grand Strand have taught us plenty about having the correct coverage. With several agents that have over 5 years of experience, and the owner with more than 20 years, we have the experience needed to help if and when it becomes claim time, but more importantly to educate new clients and provide the proper coverage and limits to help make claims go more smoothly.

# 3. When Rates Spike

If your renewal jumped 30%, the easy out is blaming ‚Äúthe market.‚Äù We go deeper, sending side-by-side comparisons, offering deductible tweaks, or other coverage changes. Hard conversations today build credibility tomorrow.

# Why Brevity Works: Big Goals, Little Details

A 200-word mission can hide behind its own complexity; an 11-word pledge can‚Äôt. Here‚Äôs why that matters:

* **Clarity for staff onboarding.**¬†New producers don‚Äôt need a 90-page manual to know what right looks like.
* **Easy recall under pressure.**¬†During hurricane season, decisions come fast. ‚ÄúWill this action make us more trusted?‚Äù is a quick filter.
* **Community alignment.**¬†The Grand Strand is tight knit. A concise mission sticks in neighbors‚Äô minds and shows up in conversations over shrimp-n-grits.

# Trust-Building Tactics You Can Feel

1. **Transparent Commission Disclosure**¬†‚Äì Want to know how we get paid? Ask us. Better yet, we often volunteer the info.
2. **Annual Coverage Check-Ups**¬†‚Äì We don‚Äôt wait for you to call; we reach out 40 ‚Äì 50 days before renewal.
3. **Claims Advocacy Hotline**¬†‚Äì I don‚Äôt want to over promise here, because we are not licensed claims adjusters. But we can help advocate when in certain instances.
4. **Local Giving**¬†‚Äì We allocate a percentage of profits to Grand Strand nonprofits‚Äîbecause you should see our commitment beyond the office walls.
5. **Continuing Education**¬†‚Äì Every licensed agent completes at least the minimum 24 hours of required CE (continuing education) every two years. In addition to that, licensed agents begin working toward a reputable designation as soon as possible. As of the date of this blog, the owner and all sales agents currently have at least one designation. Knowledge = better advice.

# Measuring Trust (Because Hope Isn‚Äôt a Strategy)

* **Google & Facebook Reviews**¬†‚Äì We track average rating and review response time.
* **Net Promoter Score**¬†‚Äì Sent after every policy is issued or renewed.
* **Policy Retention Rate**¬†‚Äì Retention rate is simply how many policies you keep year over year. We provide top-notch service, and it reflects in how many clients stay with us for many years.
* **Referral Ratio**¬†‚Äì About one in three new clients comes from an existing customer‚Äôs referral. That‚Äôs trust you can count.

# From Prospects to Partners: How We Present Options

Imagine you‚Äôre a business owner in Murrells Inlet looking for a BOP. We like to offer more than one option and additional coverages when we can.

Most business owners know they need General Liability and maybe Commerical Building coverage. But many don‚Äôt even think about other important coverages such as: Cyber Liability, Business Interruption, Equipment Breakdown, Food Spoilage, or even Workers‚Äô Compensation.

We can take the time to walk a client or prospect through things like covered perils, sublimits, and coinsurance.

You choose‚Äîbut you choose¬†*informed*. That‚Äôs what trust looks like in action.

# What ‚ÄúBad News‚Äù Looks Like‚ÄîAnd Why We Deliver It Anyway

Sometimes the responsible answer is, ‚ÄúYour roof must be replaced before any carrier will bind coverage.‚Äù Or ‚ÄúYes, carrying only state-minimum auto limits saves money, but it leaves your assets exposed.‚Äù Sugar-coating risk is short-term pleasant and long-term painful. We choose the opposite because our mission demands it.

# Investing in Tools That Reinforce Trust

* **Comparative Quote Proposals**¬†‚Äì Side-by-side quotes from multiple carriers. No smoke, no mirrors.
* **Client Focused Website**¬†‚Äì Request new quotes and policy changes 24/7.
* **Team of VAs**¬†‚Äì Virtual assistants help our staff hours and hours by running quotes with multiple insurance companies ‚Äì making sure we offer the best option based on price and coverage.
* **Technology**¬†‚Äì An automated system to send out things like insurance renewal reminders ‚Äì to help clients know when a policy is about to renew.

# Community Is Our Compass

Being ‚Äúmost trusted‚Äù doesn‚Äôt stop at a policy‚Äôs border. We:

* Sponsor local schools, golf events, and more.
* Join in local activities like 5K runs, planting trees, and collecting food for local food banks.
* Participate in local hurricane awareness events.
* Hire (paid) interns from local colleges like HGTC and Coastal Carolina.

Trust built inside the office spills into the neighborhoods we love.

# Looking Ahead: Challenges & Opportunities

# Market Volatility

Persistently hard markets test clients‚Äô patience and agencies‚Äô integrity. We‚Äôre doubling down on carrier negotiations and loss-control education to keep premiums as stable as possible.

# Technology

Quotation APIs, predictive analytics, and AI chatbots can streamline service‚Äîbut only if they enhance clarity. We adopt tech with a single-question litmus test:¬†*Will this make us more trusted?*

# Growth Without Dilution

As we expand beyond Myrtle Beach, Georgetown County, and North Myrtle Beach, we are looking to open new offices in cities and towns in the Carolinas. As we do this, it is important to us to maintain the culture we have established while hiring new competent employees that can be representatives of their local community.

# Your Role in the Mission

Trust is a two-way street. Here‚Äôs how you, our client or future client, can help keep us accountable:

1. **Ask questions‚Äîlots of them.**¬†If something isn‚Äôt clear, tell us.
2. **Share feedback.**¬†Five-star reviews fuel us, but constructive critique improves us.
3. **Keep us updated.**¬†Renovated kitchen? New teen driver? Loop us in. Surprise gaps erode trust; proactive updates preserve it.

We had always been close but I never see her romantically, or at least I try not to out of respect for my friend. She was also obviously in love with him so it is kind off a turn off, but I enjoy her company and she is genuinely a very nice person.

After their breakup I did not see her for quite some time, but recently I texted her to see how she is doing. One thing leads to another and we met up for some casual reunion. Thats when I realized how much I missed her, I used to see her quite often when hanging out with my bestfriend. Everything just clicks back, laid back chat over coffee, stupid jokes, gossips.

# The Breaking Point That Changed Everything üí•

March 15th, 2024. 2:47 AM.

I was still at my desk, building n8n AI agents for a client project.

Started at 9 AM. 17 hours later, still debugging connections.

The workflow looked simple. 12 nodes. Basic lead generation n8n AI agents.

But every connection threw errors. Every node needed tweaks. Every test failed.

My eyes burned. My back ached. My client was angry about delays.

This wasn't sustainable.

There had to be a better way to build n8n AI agents.

That's when I discovered Claude screenshots.

# The Before: When N8N AI Agents Building Was Pain ‚ùå

Let me paint the picture of my old n8n AI agents process:

**Hour 1-2**: Planning the workflow structure **Hour 3-4**: Creating nodes one by one **Hour 5-6**: Connecting everything together  
**Hour 7-8**: Debugging connection errors **Hour 9-10**: Testing with sample data **Hour 11-12**: Fixing configuration issues **Hour 13-14**: More debugging and testing **Hour 15-16**: Final optimizations **Hour 17-18**: Documentation and handoff

18 hours for one n8n AI agents workflow.

And half the time, I'd discover issues later that required rebuilding sections.

My n8n AI agents projects were costing more than they earned.

# The Discovery That Changed N8N AI Agents Forever üí°

April 3rd, 2024. Morning coffee. Random YouTube video.

Someone mentioned using Claude for code generation.

I thought: ""What if this works for n8n AI agents?""

I found a simple workflow screenshot online. 5 nodes. Basic automation.

Pasted it into Claude with a simple request.

30 seconds later, Claude gave me perfect JSON code.

I copied it. Pasted into n8n. Hit import.

The entire n8n AI agents workflow appeared. Every node. Every connection. Perfect positioning.

It worked on the first try.

My mind was blown.

# The Transformation: My New N8N AI Agents Reality ‚úÖ

Here's my current n8n AI agents building process:

**Minute 1**: Screenshot the workflow I want to build **Minute 2**: Paste into Claude and request JSON **Minute 3**: Copy the generated code **Minute 4**: Import into n8n **Minute 5**: Quick test to verify functionality

5 minutes for n8n AI agents that used to take 18 hours.

216x faster. Same quality. Zero stress.

This isn't exaggeration. This is my daily reality now.

# Real Case Study: The $15K N8N AI Agents Project üìà

Client needed complex n8n AI agents for e-commerce automation.

**Requirements:**

* Product scraping from 3 sources
* Price comparison and analysis
* Inventory updates across platforms
* Customer notification system
* Analytics and reporting

**Old Method Estimate:** 120 hours over 3 weeks

**Claude Screenshot Method:** 6 hours over 2 days

Here's how it broke down:

**Day 1:** Found similar n8n AI agents examples online. Took screenshots of 5 different workflows.

**Day 2:** Used Claude to generate JSON for each workflow. Combined them into one integrated n8n AI agents system.

Total build time: 6 hours instead of 120 hours.

Client got their n8n AI agents 2.5 weeks early.

I made $15,000 for 6 hours of work instead of 120 hours.

That's $2,500 per hour vs $125 per hour.

20x improvement in hourly rate.

# The Client Who Couldn't Believe the Results ü§Ø

Sarah runs a marketing agency.

She needed 8 different n8n AI agents for client projects:

1. Lead generation automation
2. Content creation pipeline
3. Social media scheduler
4. Customer service bot
5. Email marketing sequences
6. Analytics reporting system
7. CRM integration workflow
8. Invoice processing automation

**Her Quote from Other Developers:** $45,000 and 12 weeks

**My Quote Using Claude:** $18,000 and 3 weeks

She thought I was joking.

""How can you deliver the same n8n AI agents for 60% less cost and 75% faster?""

I showed her the Claude screenshot method.

She watched me build a complete lead generation n8n AI agents workflow in 3 minutes.

Her exact words: ""This is witchcraft.""

All 8 n8n AI agents were delivered in 2 weeks instead of 12.

Sarah became my biggest referral source.

# The Team Member Who Quit Manual N8N AI Agents Building üë®‚Äçüíª

My developer Tom was skeptical.

""Screenshots can't replace proper n8n AI agents development.""

I challenged him to a race.

Same workflow. Him building manually. Me using Claude screenshots.

**Tom's Process:** 4 hours of careful node placement and connection mapping

**My Process:** 2 minutes of screenshot analysis and JSON generation

Both n8n AI agents workflows worked perfectly.

Tom's had one small bug. Mine worked flawlessly.

Tom now uses Claude for all n8n AI agents projects.

His productivity increased 50x. His stress decreased 90%.

# The Numbers Don't Lie: My N8N AI Agents Transformation üìä

**Before Claude Screenshots:**

* 2 n8n AI agents per week maximum
* 40+ hours building time weekly
* High stress and burnout
* Frequent project delays
* Lower profit margins

**After Claude Screenshots:**

* 15+ n8n AI agents per week easily
* 8 hours building time weekly
* Low stress, high confidence
* Early project delivery
* Premium profit margins

The math is simple. Claude screenshots transformed my entire n8n AI agents business.

# The Secret That Makes N8N AI Agents Screenshots Work üéØ

Most people try this and fail.

They paste random screenshots into regular Claude.

Get garbage results. Give up.

The secret is proper setup for n8n AI agents expertise:

**Secret 1**: Custom Claude project with n8n knowledge base

**Secret 2**: Specialized prompts for n8n AI agents JSON generation

**Secret 3**: Quality screenshots showing clear workflow structure

**Secret 4**: Iterative refinement process for complex n8n AI agents

**Secret 5**: Template library for common workflow patterns

Without these secrets, screenshots don't work for n8n AI agents.

With them, you get perfect results every time.

# The Mistake That Kills N8N AI Agents Screenshot Results ‚ùå

I see people make this mistake constantly.

They take blurry screenshots. Use generic prompts. Expect perfect n8n AI agents.

Then complain when results are poor.

Here's what separates successful n8n AI agents builders from failures:

**Successful Builders:**

* Take clear, focused screenshots
* Use specific prompts with context
* Set up proper Claude knowledge base
* Test and iterate their n8n AI agents
* Build template libraries over time

**Failed Builders:**

* Use random screenshots from Google
* Ask vague questions about n8n AI agents
* Skip Claude project setup
* Give up after first attempt
* Never learn from mistakes

Success with n8n AI agents screenshots requires proper setup and execution.

# The Client Results That Prove This Works üèÜ

**Client 1: E-commerce Store**

* 5 n8n AI agents workflows for inventory management
* Delivered 2 weeks early
* 40% reduction in manual work
* $50K+ annual savings from automation

**Client 2: SaaS Company**

* 12 n8n AI agents for customer onboarding
* Built in 3 days instead of 3 weeks
* 90% faster new user activation
* 25% increase in trial-to-paid conversion

**Client 3: Marketing Agency**

* 8 n8n AI agents for campaign management
* Completed 70% under budget
* 60% improvement in campaign performance
* 3x more clients manageable with same team

Every client got better n8n AI agents faster and cheaper than traditional development.

# The Competitive Advantage You Can't Ignore üöÄ

Your competitors still build n8n AI agents manually.

They spend weeks on projects you complete in days.

They struggle with complex workflows you handle easily.

They charge based on time spent. You charge based on value delivered.

This creates massive competitive advantages:

**Speed**: Deliver n8n AI agents 10x faster than competitors

**Quality**: Claude generates cleaner code than manual building

**Scalability**: Handle unlimited projects without hiring developers

**Profitability**: Higher margins from reduced time investment

**Innovation**: Focus on strategy instead of technical execution

Claude screenshots don't just improve your n8n AI agents building.

They transform your entire business model.

# The Evolution: From Screenshots to N8N AI Agents Empire üëë

Month 1: Master basic screenshot to JSON process

Month 2: Build template library of common n8n AI agents patterns

Month 3: Develop advanced techniques for complex workflows

Month 4: Create productized n8n AI agents services

Month 5: Launch premium consulting based on speed advantage

Month 6: Scale to enterprise-level n8n AI agents without hiring

This progression took me from struggling freelancer to n8n AI agents expert.

The same path is available to you.

# Common Transformations I See With N8N AI Agents üìà

**The Overwhelmed Freelancer**: From 2 projects monthly to 15+ projects using n8n AI agents screenshots

**The Small Agency**: From manual processes to fully automated n8n AI agents delivery systems

**The Enterprise Team**: From 6-week project timelines to 1-week delivery using Claude for n8n AI agents

**The Solo Entrepreneur**: From technical bottlenecks to unlimited n8n AI agents scaling capacity

**The Consultant**: From hourly billing to value-based pricing for n8n AI agents expertise

Every transformation follows the same pattern: setup Claude properly, master screenshots, scale rapidly.

# The Truth About N8N AI Agents Screenshot Quality üìä

Let me be honest about success rates:

**Simple Workflows (5 nodes or less)**: 95% success rate **Medium Workflows (6-15 nodes)**: 85% success rate  
**Complex Workflows (16+ nodes)**: 75% success rate **Enterprise Workflows (25+ nodes)**: 65% success rate

Even worst-case scenarios save massive time.

A 65% complete enterprise n8n AI agents workflow still eliminates 20+ hours of manual work.

Small tweaks finish the remaining 35%.

# Your N8N AI Agents Transformation Starts Today üéØ

You have two choices:

**Choice 1**: Keep building n8n AI agents manually. Stay frustrated. Work harder for less money.

**Choice 2**: Learn Claude screenshots. Transform your n8n AI agents process. Scale beyond current limits.

Choice 1 leads to burnout and business stagnation.

Thank you all for your input! Before I quit, I am going to see how the new store goes because it doesn't have a drive thru and it may be easier to talk to people.**

I work at a popular coffee franchise and am in the process of transferring stores. I‚Äôve been trying to get an accommodation under the ADA due to autism. I deal with frequent shutdowns from constant verbal interaction and overstimulation. While I can do some talking, I really struggle with roles that require constant, unpredictable communication‚Äîlike drive-thru, register, and handoff.

My therapist wrote a letter asking that I be scheduled in lower-contact roles (bar, support, food, etc.) when staffing allows. These are part of normal operations and don‚Äôt need extra people‚Äîjust thoughtful scheduling.

Instead, my company gave me a 30-minute limit at the drive-thru window (at my current store). Now that I‚Äôm transferring to a store without a drive-thru, I asked for the same limit at register, and ideally also handoff. I also asked to limit my communication to essentials (greetings, clarifying orders, short small talk, thanking customers), but they said no to both. They said they can approve a 30 minute limit on register, but it cannot extend to other high-verbal roles.

They said all roles are considered ‚Äúhigh-verbal,‚Äù and baristas have to tailor conversations to each customer‚Äîeven if the customer wants to chat for a while. They also said rotating through *all* roles is essential, and letting me limit more than one role is too much of a burden on the business.

It feels like they‚Äôre unwilling to work with me beyond the bare minimum. My original request wasn‚Äôt even about time limits‚Äîjust being assigned to less overstimulating roles when possible. I‚Äôm not asking for special treatment, just something that lets me keep my job without burning out.

Has anyone else dealt with something like this? Am I being unreasonable to expect more flexibility?",0,1751050926.0,disability,9,0.45,False

Now that it's summer and feels like I'm walking on the surface of the sun, I'm ready for some iced pour overs. In the past, I'd just brew it into my tumbler. But, I thought it might be nice to have a glass carafe.

But I'm concerned about putting ice in a glass container and then having +200F coffee dripping into it. I feel like that's asking for it to crack and shatter.

1 - Is this something I even need to be concerned over? 

2 - Any recommendations on a nice glass carafe that can, in particular, withstand the temperature fluctuations of iced pour overs?

In particular, I've got my eye on these:

I‚Äôm not some hardcore credit card optimizer or anything, but I do like getting some money back when I spend. What caught my attention was the 3% Daily Cash on Apple stuff and some other retailers like Uber and Walgreens. I got the card mainly because I needed a new MacBook for work, so the 3% was a nice bonus upfront. It gave me around $48 back right away, which felt kind of satisfying honestly.

Since then I‚Äôve been using it through Apple Pay whenever I can, mostly at local places or drive-thrus. The 2% back stacks up faster than I expected, especially since I tend to grab coffee or groceries almost daily. I don‚Äôt really use the physical card much since that only gives 1%, and I have other cards that do better for random swipe purchases.

That said, I‚Äôve noticed the Apple Card doesn‚Äôt really have a huge list of 3% partners anymore, at least none that I regularly shop at. I wish they added more retailers or rotated bonus categories or something. Also, I was kinda bummed there's no sign-up bonus like most cards. I get that it‚Äôs focused on simplicity, but still.

Overall I like how the cashback goes straight into my Apple Cash and I can use it for whatever. It's smooth and fast. But I‚Äôm wondering, are there better reward cards out there now in 2025?

1lm219r,https://www.reddit.com/r/Flights/comments/1lm219r/budapest_to_tokyo_with_china_eastern_and_opodo_my/,Budapest to Tokyo with China Eastern and Opodo: My Honest Review,"Hello everyone,

I was recently on a flight from Budapest to Tokyo with a connecting flight in Pu Dong Shanghai (PVG). In Tokyo we arrived in Narita airport and were going back from Haneda airport. I wanted to share a review of the experience and some tips and tricks for people that plan to do so.

**Opodo Experience**

We booked our flights through Opodo and avoided all their upsells. Opodo is a subsidiary of eDreams. Be very cautious with Opodo Prime ‚Äì it auto-renews subscriptions without clear upfront disclosure, and cancellation is tedious. We didn‚Äôt fall into that trap, so make sure you don‚Äôt either.

Before going to pros and cons I have to say that everything went well, you just have to know a few tricks and be tech savvy enough to find all the information.

**Pros:**

* The ticket is cheaper.

**Cons:**

* Limited passenger details ‚Äì when my friend booked the flight it only asked for our full name, which did not give me confidence that the purchase was properly done for each of us (I would expect them to ask for more information, like passport number or smth).
* Poor booking information ‚Äì you get very little detail about your booking even after the status is ‚Äúbooked‚Äù; only an internal Opodo reference number, which means nothing to the airline.
* No direct ticket access ‚Äì you cannot get your actual ticket or e-ticket with just their reference.
* Poor check-in guidance ‚Äì they provide generic instructions without clarifying specific airline processes.
* Hidden free seat selection (for China Eastern) ‚Äì they don‚Äôt tell you that you can actually pick a seat for free on the airline‚Äôs website (some better seats require payment). To select your seat go to the China eastern website, in the navigation bar go to My Trip and click on the Seat Selection. Write your details and you will get the option to select seats. Tip: Use all uppercase letters for name, surname and middle name. If you don't have your ticket number (not the Opodo reference one) read the next point
* Difficult support access ‚Äì the only way to get meaningful information is through their chat bot, **repeatedly asking for a human agent to finally receive your e-ticket number and tickets by email**.

**Pu Dong (PVG) Transfer Experience**

Our flight with China Eastern had 1 connecting flights in Pu Dong airport (each way) which was quite fine. The transit goes pretty smoothly: You get the In-Transit sticker which tells the Airport security and crew that you are in transit so it is hard to get lost, you just have to follow the signs for Transfers. You will go through a few security and passport checks which is not too bad and you go through if fast. They are quite strict about batteries and some other stuff so they will ask you to get it out of the bag before scanning. 

On the connection flight from Shanghai to Tokyo we had to get on a automated in airport subway (automated people mover a.k.a. APM) to get to the satellite terminal gates. We followed the signs to get to our gate and honestly it felt kind of weird as I have never seen that, but we asked some nice Chinese people and they confirmed we are going the right way. But our friends that had a different flight didn't have to do that, so your experience can vary.

After that you may enjoy a pretty empty airport (if you are traveling in the night or the early morning like us). If you are lucky you can go into the airport shops. We had 6 hours and we bought some Chinese snacks and magnets.

Overall - no complaints.

**China Eastern Experience - Economy**

As the cheapest option to travel to Tokyo we decided on this airline, and we paid \~780 Euros for the round trip. It can be cheaper if you buy it on time...

How early to get to the airport? Get there 2 hours before. I think it is enough time to check-in and drop you luggage there, go though the security and get to the gate on time without rushing and stress. The rule with China Eastern is that **the gate is closing 20 minutes before departure.** In Budapest we managed to Check-in pretty quickly, but in Tokyo we waited for like an hour or so.

The flight overall was pretty smooth, the time passed quickly. I am a light sleeper so I did not get much sleep on the first flight, but on the way back I slept almost the whole flight (except when they gave us food, of course).

Tip: Print the e-tickets you get from the Opodo agent or other platform. If you have trouble with the ticket you can always show them proof that you have a ticket. We did not need it but it keeps your mind at peace.

**Pros:**

* Timely boarding - We did not experience any delays and everything was on time, we even got to Budapest an hour earlier that in said in the Opodo app and the ticket.
* Very friendly staff - They were really helpful when we asked them about on-board Wi-Fi and overall they were smiling and not rude at all.
* 10 minutes free on-board Wi-Fi - It is not much, it is not fast but at least you can send a message to your family that you are well :)
* Selection of drinks - They quite frequently went through the airplane asking if you need a drink. They offer water, sodas, soft drinks, coffee (I think), tea (and maybe some other drinks but I am not sure). You can even ask them to put some ice so you have a nice cold cup of Coca Cola Zero
* Clean cabin - Cabin was clean, you get the blanket and the pillow for sleep and it really helps because of the temperature changes though the flight.
* Luggage allowance - They are pretty generous with the luggage -> 2 Check-in, 1 Carry-on and a personal item (a backpack). They did not bother us or size our luggage (except the check-in of course)
* Smooth landings - you don't even know you landed
* The check-in luggage is checked through ‚Äì when you drop off your luggage, it will go directly to your final destination. You won‚Äôt need to pick it up and check it in again at your connecting flight. I‚Äôd still suggest asking if this applies in your case, because if you have to change airports during your connection or for some other reason, it might not be done.
* (bonus) Airplane camera - When we were flying from Shanghai to Tokyo we had a possibility to look at the cameras outside the aircraft. Reallllly cool experience.

**Cons:**

* The China Eastern website is lacking - You cannot Check-in online, you have to do it in the airport (don't get me wrong, the experience was ok, but it would be easier this way). Even the Seat Selection was glitching sometimes: It worked when I opened it, and the next time it just wouldn't work, but it allowed me in the next day. There is also the weird way of writing some things in the fields: You have to use all uppercase letters and in the Ticket Validation when it asks you to enter name you need to format it like: SURNAME/NAME
* Strict on-board regulations - You cannot use your power bank when flying, the crew will tell you to turn it off if they see you using it.
* Unusable provided headphones - This is to expect, but be warned. If you were planning to watch some in-flight movies you will probably quit because I could not understand a single word the characters were saying
* Screens turn on when there is an announcement - I was sleeping an some random announcement turned my screen on, it was on Chinese and I didn't understand anything.
* Damaged luggage - My friends luggage was damaged, his wheel fell off. I did not use the shell plastic luggage so it survived without a scratch.

**Neutral**

* Hit and miss food - We received 3 courses of meals. 2 on the longer flight and 1 on the second shorter flight to Tokyo. You will not be hungry (if you eat it and not throw it away). I think that the food was okay, ""fresh"" vegetable salads were unseasoned and without flavor, the fruit was tasty. Tip: Use salt and sugar if they provide it, it really helped one dish we got. You can see the photos of the food we got served. - I mean it is airplane food, what do we expect



**Overall Conclusion**

I was quite happy with my China Eastern experience ‚Äì the flights were smooth, the staff was friendly, and it got me where I needed to be without issues. Opodo, on the other hand, felt a bit sketchy to use, mainly because it seems like they‚Äôre trying to hide ticket information from you and push you into subscriptions you don‚Äôt want. Both Opodo and China Eastern could improve their online systems to make things easier for travellers. I would definitely fly with China Eastern again, but hopefully next time I can avoid Opodo or eDreams.

I hope this review helps someone out there planning their trip. If you have any questions or want to share your own experiences ‚Äì good or bad ‚Äì feel free to comment, I‚Äôm happy to help!",1,1751050702.0,Flights,0,0.67,False

If you haven't, don‚Äôt. It‚Äôs hell. But that‚Äôs where I found myself when everything came to a head‚Äîsweatin‚Äô out whiskey and desperation, clutchin‚Äô the steering wheel like it owed me child support.

My name‚Äôs Cody Lane. Thirty-eight. Been called squirrelly more than once‚Äîby my ex, my parole officer, my momma, and hell, even the guy at the corner gas station who knows me by my beer brand.

But there‚Äôs one thing I ain‚Äôt never half-assed‚Äîmy little girl, Maisie. She‚Äôs six. Bright-eyed, funny, and way too forgiving. Every Sunday I get her for a few hours and we eat ice cream at the lake and pretend the world ain‚Äôt broken.

Until two weeks ago.

That‚Äôs when Kimberly‚Äîmy ex‚Äîhanded me a yellow envelope with a court seal and that polite, dead-eyed look she gets when she‚Äôs done bein‚Äô patient.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre behind. Way behind. Judge said if you don‚Äôt catch up, supervised visits only,‚Äù she said. Behind her stood her new husband, Sheriff Dean Cutter, arms crossed, mirror sunglasses hiding whatever judgment was simmerin‚Äô beneath. That man looks like Texas carved him outta mesquite wood and bad luck. Clean-shaven, barrel-chested, and so full of law he sweats probable cause.

I opened the envelope, squinted through the legal talk, and saw the number: $12,672.13.

Might as well have been a million.

I spent that night drinkin‚Äô Old Crow in the truck bed under a busted ceiling fan I rigged to a car battery, feelin‚Äô the heat rise and thinkin' too hard. I knew two things for certain: I couldn‚Äôt scrounge up twelve grand workin‚Äô honest, and I damn sure couldn‚Äôt live without Maisie.

That‚Äôs when the idea came. Maybe it was the heatstroke. Maybe it was the bourbon. But it slithered in slick as a snake in tall grass.

I knew a little bank out in a town called Willow Ridge‚Äîmiddle of nowhere, tin-roof kind of place where the teller probably knows your middle name and your daddy's birthday. Security was two cameras and an old fella named Reggie with a limp and a taser.

I used to fix satellite dishes there. Knew the backdoor was always propped open by a busted mop bucket.


---

I robbed it on a Wednesday.

Wore a camo bandana, sunglasses, and a straw hat pulled low. No gun‚Äîjust a note. Slid it across the counter to a girl named Shelly who once gave me free coffee. Her eyes widened but she didn‚Äôt scream. Handed me a canvas sack with $4,300 and change. I told her I was sorry before runnin‚Äô out the mop bucket door.

Next day, I bought Maisie new shoes, mailed in two grand to the court, and drove like I had a devil hitchin‚Äô a ride.

It felt wrong. But it felt right, too.


---

I told myself it was a one-time thing. Then I checked my oil-stained mailbox and found a second notice.

‚ÄúFurther non-payment will result in loss of visitation rights.‚Äù

I robbed again.

This one was in Plainview. Little bigger bank, little more risk. I dressed like a delivery man, walked in with a clipboard and a cap, smiled big. They gave me just under six grand. That time, I did bring a gun‚Äîmy granddad‚Äôs .38‚Äîbut it wasn‚Äôt loaded. Just for the look of it.

Drove away feelin‚Äô sick, but that sick mixed with somethin‚Äô else‚Äîpower, maybe. Or guilt dressed as power.


---

Three weeks passed. Three banks. Over fifteen grand stolen.

I paid the full back support, kept enough for Maisie‚Äôs school supplies, and stashed the rest in coffee cans buried under my trailer.

I‚Äôd have stopped there if I‚Äôd had sense.

But that‚Äôs the thing about desperation‚Äîit don‚Äôt just go away. It lingers. Becomes habit. And sometimes, it grows teeth.


---

Sheriff Cutter showed up at my place one afternoon. I was sittin‚Äô on the porch, shirtless, smokin‚Äô a cigarette and tryin‚Äô to fix the string on Maisie‚Äôs kite.

He walked up slow, arms folded, that badge glintin‚Äô like a middle finger in the sun.

‚ÄúYou been workin', Cody?‚Äù

I squinted up at him. ‚ÄúOdd jobs. Tryin‚Äô to stay afloat.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat right? You pay off almost thirteen grand in child support in under a month. You win the lottery?‚Äù

I shrugged. ‚ÄúGot a cousin out in Odessa owed me from a car sale.‚Äù

He nodded slow. ‚ÄúThat cousin got a name?‚Äù

‚ÄúDozen of 'em. I come from a long line of unreliable kin.‚Äù

He grinned, but it didn‚Äôt reach his eyes. ‚ÄúYou ever been to Willow Ridge?‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt flinch. ‚ÄúNot in a year or two.‚Äù

‚ÄúFunny. Got a witness says someone fittin‚Äô your description robbed a bank there. Thought it was coincidence. But then Plainview got hit. Same style. Same cowboy hat.‚Äù

I stood. ‚ÄúWhat exactly you accusin‚Äô me of, Sheriff?‚Äù

‚ÄúNothin‚Äô yet. Just askin‚Äô questions. But I got my eye on you.‚Äù

Then he leaned in close. ‚ÄúYou screw up again, you don‚Äôt just lose your visitations. You lose your daughter. Period. You understand me?‚Äù

I nodded, heart poundin‚Äô, hand twitchin' for the kite string like it might save me.


---

That night, I drove. Drove till the road turned black and the stars looked like exit signs. I thought about runnin'. Mexico, maybe. Or Arizona. Thought about turnin‚Äô myself in, too. But every time I closed my eyes, I saw Maisie‚Äôs smile and heard her little voice sayin‚Äô, ‚ÄúYou promise you‚Äôll always come back?‚Äù

And I couldn‚Äôt run. I wouldn‚Äôt run.


---

I hit one more bank.

It was the biggest yet‚ÄîHumble, Texas. Suburb. Real vault, real guards. I scoped it for a week. Posed as a janitor. Found the weak points.

The plan was airtight. Until it wasn‚Äôt.

I got in, got the money‚Äîalmost ten grand‚Äîbut as I slipped out the back, I saw the cruiser.

Sheriff Dean Cutter. Like he knew.

I ran. Through alleyways, jumped a fence, tore my jeans on barbed wire. Hid in a drainage ditch for four hours with ants crawlin‚Äô up my legs and my heart beatin‚Äô like a drum solo.

He never found me. But the next day, he knocked on Kimberly‚Äôs door. Told her he had evidence. Partial prints. Video. Said he couldn‚Äôt arrest me yet, but it was comin‚Äô.

She called me. Cryin‚Äô.

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt protect you, Cody. Not anymore.‚Äù


---

The next day, I went to see Maisie at the lake. Brought her ice cream. Strawberry swirl.

She looked up at me with that sugar-stained mouth and said, ‚ÄúMama says you‚Äôre sick. You sick, Daddy?‚Äù

I couldn‚Äôt speak.

Just nodded.

That night, I sat in the truck, stared at the sack of money, and thought about all the lines I‚Äôd crossed.

Thought about Maisie growin‚Äô up wonderin‚Äô where I went. If I left her.

And I made a decision.


---

I called Cutter.

‚ÄúTired of runnin‚Äô. But I got conditions.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou think you‚Äôre in any position to bargain, Lane?‚Äù

I told him: I‚Äôd surrender. Quietly. No press. No handcuffs in front of Maisie. And the money‚Äîevery cent‚Äîwould go into a trust for her.

He was quiet. Then he said, ‚ÄúYou show up with the money and no bullshit... I‚Äôll make sure she sees you as a father, not a headline.‚Äù


---

So I did.

Drove to the station at dawn. Stepped inside with the canvas sack. Dropped it at his feet.

He looked at me like he was seein‚Äô a ghost.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a damn fool, Cody.‚Äù

I grinned. ‚ÄúAren‚Äôt we all?‚Äù

He cuffed me, but gently. No cameras. No crowd.

I asked one favor.

‚ÄúLet me write her a letter.‚Äù


---

That was three months ago.

I‚Äôm writin‚Äô this from a minimum-security cell in Huntsville. They gave me five years. Said I‚Äôll be out in two with good behavior. I sweep floors, read cowboy novels, and count the days like stars on a prison ceiling.

Every week, I get a letter with crayon drawings and hearts. And once a month, they bring Maisie in. She runs into my arms like nothin‚Äô ever happened.

And you know what?

I don‚Äôt regret it.

Because bein‚Äô a father ain't about doin‚Äô the right thing all the time. Sometimes, it's about tryin‚Äîeven when you‚Äôre broken, even when the world‚Äôs stacked against you.

Sometimes, it's about robbin‚Äô a few banks in a dusty, lonely state called Texas just to keep a promise.

And I promised her I‚Äôd always come back.

And I will.

Bit about me: I'm into the gym heavy, basically live in oversized tees while I lift with music blasting. I love food, cooking and eating both. Oh and coffee.
Music's a big one too, rap, metal or heavy rock, oldies, jazz you name it. Also been getting into historical art and museums lately. Used to watch anime like crazy, still got love for it, just not watching as much as I should.

Not here to overshare or trauma bond, just wanna talk to someone who's got their own thing going on.
If you like music, gym life, deep convos mixed with dumb jokes, and you're not afraid to be a little weird, hit me up.

If you lift, got fire music taste, love food, coffee, anime and stuff and can bounce between talking about life and sending the dumbest stuff known to man, you've earned bonus points.

I‚Äôve always been a casual coffee drinker, mostly grabbing whatever‚Äôs cheap at the store, but I figured it might be fun to get something a little different delivered, especially since I‚Äôve been working from home a lot more.

So far, I‚Äôve gotten two shipments, one from Rwanda and one from Peru. The Rwanda one totally caught me off guard. It had this almost tea-like vibe, really light and bright, and it actually made me ditch my usual creamer for once. The Peru one was more mellow and nutty, good for those groggy mornings when I just want something smooth without thinking too hard. I liked that they came with a postcard and little brew tips, though I kinda ignored the ‚Äúperfect method‚Äù and just used my French press like always.

Shipping‚Äôs been on time, packaging‚Äôs nice, and honestly I look forward to checking my mail for it now, which sounds silly but feels kinda fun. Only thing is it‚Äôs a bit more expensive than grabbing a bag at Trader Joe‚Äôs or wherever, but I guess you‚Äôre paying for the whole curated experience.

The manager told me that I was putting them in ‚Äúa very difficult position‚Äù by raising this concern, and that they wouldn‚Äôt refuse service to him, or anyone, because it would just ‚Äúescalate the situation.‚Äù

Personally, I think it‚Äôs wrong to tolerate Nazism anytime, anywhere. It‚Äôs not a MAGA hat, it‚Äôs beyond politics.

1lm1tw7,https://www.reddit.com/r/DF64/comments/1lm1tw7/grinding_finer/,Grinding Finer,"Hey guys I‚Äôm having trouble with the grinder. Seems like no matter what I do I‚Äôm not getting slower espresso times. This seems to be happening with every light roast coffee I dial. Buttercream, I couldn‚Äôt get it to go longer than 18 seconds, with 8-9s pre infusion on a breville express. Same thing is happening with daks banana split Omni. I‚Äôm trying to push over 18 seconds but once I start going to fine the time starts coming back down. Like it‚Äôs too fine and I‚Äôm getting channeling. I want to be able to get shots that reach at least 20 seconds plus the pre infusion, as the 18s shots are not giving me creamy texture or much sweetness. It‚Äôs acid forward. 

Ratio 1:3 lungo shot since it‚Äôs a light roast, which should be on the longer side like 32+ seconds of total time including pre. Since I‚Äôm aiming for 53g out, with 18g dose. 
Machine: breville express 
Temp : 202F (lighter beans so higher temp)

Example: I started banana split Omni from dak at 14 setting and shot ran too fast, like 13 seconds and around 6-7s preinfusion for a total of 21 seconds total time. 

Then I went down to 13.5 I got 18s plus 9s seconds preinfusion for a total time of 27s. This was an alright shot less acidity than most but still sour. 

Then I go to 13 setting and I get 17s, and preinfusion shorter because it starts dripping at 7s (maybe too fine by then) then I went to 12.5 and I got 16s and 6s pre (started dripping even faster on pre infusion). Am I doing something wrong. I doubt from 13-13.5 there is such a big difference that the shot can go from 18s to 25s for example. This happens for all beans since I only do light roast on this grinder. Can‚Äôt seem to get to that 20s range. Even on lungo shots. Is it the machine? I‚Äôm not sure anymore.

They‚Äôve found some cool shit over the years. Jameson‚Äôs house was mostly furnished with top-quality furniture Mr. Monty got for free from these properties. He even found a jet ski that the family had forgotten to take one time, but they had to sell it at an auction.

He took me to his shed, which was full of tools and fishing equipment. There, I instantly spotted the old wooden box. It was the size of a box you might store a TV in and looked like it was from another time period. I opened the top and sifted through all the yellowing envelopes inside. All the ones I saw were addressed to ‚Äúmommy and daddy‚Äù and were written in bad handwriting.

‚ÄúWhere‚Äôd your dad get these?‚Äù I asked.

I started to open one when Jameson cried, ‚ÄúHey, Brett! Don‚Äôt open that shit in here! I told you I don‚Äôt want to get cursed.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre 20,‚Äù I returned with a laugh. ‚ÄúAre you really scared of ghosts and monsters and shit?‚Äù

Jameson‚Äôs face reddened and I felt bad for making fun of him.

‚ÄúRead some of these letters and you might believe in them too,‚Äù he said.

I laughed in my head that time, not even considering he could be right.

*Dear mommy and daddy,*

*I‚Äôm sorry I still haven‚Äôt come home yet. And I‚Äôm sorry for going too far in the woods. I know I‚Äôm not supposed to. I found a deer. It was so pretty and it wanted to play with me. I followed it but when I looked around, I didn't know where I was. Please don‚Äôt be mad. It was scary being in the woods by myself. When it got dark, I heard a bunch of scary noises, like bears and wolves, but I hid behind a tree so they couldn‚Äôt find me.*

*When it was daytime again, I tried going back the way I came, but all the trees looked the exact same. I fell over a rock and scraped my knee, but I didn‚Äôt cry. I was scared it would turn dark again, but the grey lady found me. She has a house in the woods that‚Äôs made of wood and mud. It‚Äôs a lot smaller than our house, but it‚Äôs warm because of the inside fire.*

*She said I can stay until you find me. She told me to write you a letter so she could give it to you. She said it would take a long time, though because the mailman doesn‚Äôt come to her house a lot.*

*Love,*

*Danny*

When I got the letters home, I dumped them on the floor of my bedroom and spread them out. It didn‚Äôt look like it from the box, but now seeing them on the floor I counted several hundred at least. Each had a date on the front, so I spent hours organizing them from oldest to newest. The dates ranged from one day after another to several months and even years between letters.

I managed to get through 20-25 of them before going to bed that night, but there were at least 1,000, probably more. A chunk of them were more boring than expected. At least half the letters I read were Danny recounting everything he and the grey woman had done that day or week. This could range from them feeding the chickens and washing clothes to exploring the woods near the cabin.

It was hard to imagine that someone writing a story would spend so much time on the mundane details of the lives of Danny and the grey woman. However, it was the more harrowing ones that kept me curious enough to keep reading. I figured if there was a good enough story in the letters, I could post them all online or even put them together in a book or something.

*Dear mommy and daddy,*

*Sorry I haven't written every day. I wanted to but I'm always tired after our chores. It's okay. The mailman still hasn't come.*

*I think I've been here for a week. I've been counting the days on both hands. There‚Äôs a lot of weird stuff about this place. I see things running in the woods that aren‚Äôt in my wildlife books. It smells funny too. She says I‚Äôm lucky because no one else gets to come here but I don‚Äôt like it. I can hear the monster walking in the woods, but I haven‚Äôt seen it. The grey lady stares in the woods for a long time when she hears it. She can hear it when I can‚Äôt, sometimes. Sometimes she shakes while she‚Äôs listening to it.*

*Love you,*

*Danny*

I‚Äôd been messaging Jameson about all I‚Äôd read in the letters and what I‚Äôd found about this grey lady, but he reiterated his desire to have nothing to do with them. I wanted to ask for specifics on where his dad found the letters, but I could tell he was already getting annoyed with me. Besides, it was kind of fun seeing what I could find based on the letters alone.

*Dear Mommy and Daddy,*

*I miss you. I keep crying and the grey lady doesn‚Äôt like it. She told me to quit calling her the grey lady. She wants me to call her mommy, but I don‚Äôt want to. Today, we had to do some weird stuff. She said it was to keep the monster away. She put mud all over me until I was brown all over, like Rocky when he rolls in the dirt. She made me cover her in mud too. She looked really scary in all the mud. But she said we had to look scary to scare the monster away. If the mailman doesn‚Äôt come, maybe I will get home before this letter.*

*I love you,*

*Danny*

The rituals they‚Äôd perform together were some of the strangest parts of the letters. In several of the letters, Danny described having to butcher an animal and leave it for ‚Äúthe monster.‚Äù He also said during full moons she‚Äôd make him sing and dance until his throat hurt and his feet bled. If he tried to stop, she would throw things like rocks and sticks at him.

The letters started to blur together. At a certain point, I felt like I was coming to a dead end, so I had no choice but to ask Jameson for more information from his dad. He said he would and, in the meantime, I gave him an overview of the stuff I'd read.

*Dear mommy and daddy,*

*She said I could call her Mrs. Everly instead of mommy. She said she‚Äôs been here a long time. She doesn‚Äôt usually talk to me much but she said she likes having me here. I don‚Äôt know why she‚Äôs so mean to me, then. Maybe she likes having me because she likes being mean to me.*

*Sometimes I pretend to be asleep but I know she‚Äôs watching me. She stands in the dark place between my room and the door and stands still. She does it a lot. One time I pretended to be asleep until the sun came up and she stood there the whole time.*

*I think she wants to hurt me but she‚Äôs too scared to be by herself with the monster outside. I hear it a lot. It sounds mad sometimes and scratches my window but I hide under the covers until it goes away.*

*Mrs. Everly said the mailman will come tomorrow to get my letters.*

*Love,*

*Danny*

I wasn‚Äôt sure how long I‚Äôd been awake at that point. I think I fell asleep for at least a few hours before waking up on my bedroom floor surrounded by letters, but it was hard to tell. After I got up, I went to Jameson‚Äôs house and knocked on the front door, but he didn't answer.

‚ÄúJameson!‚Äù I called up to his bedroom. ‚ÄúI know you‚Äôre here. You‚Äôre car‚Äôs in the driveway, dumbass!‚Äù

Jameson approached the windows and rolled his eyes at me. I waited for him to come downstairs, hoping I‚Äôd get a legitimate reason for why he was ignoring me over the last week. His eyes refused to meet mine when he opened the door.

‚ÄúDude, what the fuck‚Äôs going on with you?‚Äù I asked.

He finally looked up with wide eyes and stepped closer to me. I backed away.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going on with me? What‚Äôs going on with you?‚Äù he asked, pointing at my chest. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been calling and texting me all hours of the day, even when I‚Äôm at work. When I actually answer, all you want to do is talk about those fucking letters and that grey person.‚Äù

‚ÄúGrey lady,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúAnd I found out her real name is Mrs. Everly.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt give a fuck,‚Äù he said before closing his lips tightly and sighing. Jameson stepped away and ran his fingers through his hair, something he always did when he was frustrated. ‚ÄúBrett, legitimately, what is your obsession with those letters? I know I said they were cursed, but I was just fucking around. You don‚Äôt actually believe that shit you‚Äôre reading do you?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not obsessed,‚Äù I said with a laugh.

Jameson pulled out his phone and showed me the wall of text messages I‚Äôd sent him, hardly any of which he‚Äôd responded to. He handed me his phone and I saw most of the messages were either recounting what I‚Äôd read in the letters or asking him if he‚Äôd heard from his dad about the property.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt think I was writing you that much.‚Äù

It hit me how many long nights I‚Äôd spent with those letters, locked in my room, barely eating. The exhaustion had finally hit me and I realized I hadn‚Äôt changed my clothes in days. I looked to Jameson who looked more concerned than I‚Äôd ever seen him.

‚ÄúLook, man,‚Äù he said, ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you go get those letters and we‚Äôll burn them or something in the backyard?‚Äù

My entire body clenched and my heart dropped. A sudden feeling of rage flushed through my body and I wanted to choke Jameson. But it went away in under a second.

‚ÄúUh, yeah,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúThanks, man.‚Äù

Jameson patted me on the shoulder and told me to come back by that evening. He said he‚Äôd have the fire ready.

\*\*\*

We stood side-by-side, watching the fire burn inside Jameson‚Äôs family‚Äôs fire pit. The letters sat behind us on the ground. I kept glancing back at them, hoping Jameson wouldn‚Äôt notice.

He continued feeding the fire while I sat to the side, thinking of how nice it would be to be rid of the letters. At least, that‚Äôs what I kept telling myself. I knew I needed them gone, but it was like my brain was begging for more.

‚ÄúHey, uh, is your dad home?‚Äù I asked Jameson.

He furrowed his brow at me and said, ‚ÄúNo. You know he doesn‚Äôt get home from the auction until midnight. Why?‚Äù

I smiled and shook my head before looking at the fire. Jameson seemingly accepted my answer and returned to the fire.

It continued to grow over the next few minutes until Jameson was satisfied. He walked to the box of letters and brought them to the fire. I followed while clenching and unclenching my fists. I bit my lip and took several deep breaths. A fog filled my brain as if I were recovering from a hangover and seemingly came out of nowhere.

We stood next to each other in front of the fire and Jameson asked, ‚ÄúYou ready?‚Äù

He lifted a chunk of letters from the box and held them to the fire.

‚ÄúWait,‚Äù I said, holding his hand back. ‚ÄúWhat if they‚Äôre, uh, valuable or something? Won‚Äôt your dad be pissed we just burned them?‚Äù

‚ÄúThey have a guy check all the stuff before they throw it out,‚Äù Jameson said. ‚ÄúThese letters aren‚Äôt worth shit.‚Äù

Jameson tried to pull his hand back, but I wouldn‚Äôt let go. He gave me that same look of concern before trying to pull his hand back again.

‚ÄúDude, fucking let go!‚Äù he yelled.

‚ÄúGive me the letters!‚Äù I yelled back.

He pulled one more time and managed to get away. He held the letters over the fire, but I leaped at him, sending us both to the ground. I scrambled up and got all the letters I could see in the area as Jameson screamed. I heard a crack as we fell, but didn‚Äôt check to see what happened. I grabbed all the letters and threw them back into the box before running back to my car and returning home.

*Dear Mommy and Daddy,*

*Mrs. Everly wasn't lying about the monster. I saw it and it almost got me. It wasn't the kind of monster from movies. It didn't have sharp teeth or claws. It was kind of like a person but tall and skinny like a tree. It had long arms and legs like a big bug and its face was fuzzy. It looked like the TV when it isn't working right.*

*I tried to run but every time I looked back it was standing there but in a different place from before. I was so scared. Mrs. Everly found me and made the monster go away. She said some words I didn't understand then it stopped following us. We were able to run away.*

*Love,*

*Danny*

I watched Jameson and his mom leave. Jameson was holding his arm at his side while cringing in pain. I felt bad that he'd gotten hurt, but he should've been such a prick about the letters, I thought while holding the box at my side.

When they were finally out of the driveway, I made my way back to the house and around to a side window. It was the way Jameson and I would sneak in after coming back from parties.

The window was stuck but I managed to get it up after a few tries. I spilled into the kitchen, knocking over a few dishes sitting on the counter. I figured I'd clean them up on my way out.

Jameson's dad, Donny, was old school and liked conducting all business from his home office. There was a large desk in the center with a bookshelf against the back wall. A dated computer sat on the desk with scattered papers all around it.

I searched through the papers, but it was mostly notes that made no sense to me, and receipts. I booted up the computer, which took almost ten minutes, and scanned through the files. Finally, I found one labeled ‚ÄúProperty Ledgers‚Äù and came across the one dated for the current month. I emailed it to myself, which took another ten minutes, and slipped back out of the house.

When I got home, I looked through the ledger and saw a list of six homes, each with a list of items and their estimated value. Some of the items I saw were worth tens of thousands of dollars, including some old farm equipment. It was no wonder Donny got into this line of work.

After a few minutes of searching, I found one listed with ‚ÄúBox of old envelopes - $0.‚Äù The address associated was several miles outside town, on the edge of the forest.

\*\*\*

I stared at the house, thinking it could use a new coat of paint and replacement shingles. Other than that, the place looked well-maintained.

I rounded the house and heard something make a noise near the woods. There were leaves everywhere, so it was hard to walk through the area without making a sound. I slowly peeked around the house towards the woods but didn‚Äôt see anything in the immediate vicinity. Deer were common in my area, so I figured that‚Äôs what it was.

I stared for another moment when I heard a sound from the opposite end of the house. It wasn‚Äôt a voice, but didn‚Äôt sound quite like an animal either. I peered around to see if I could catch sight of whatever made the sound. Something poked from around the side of the shed. It was small and dark, like the snout of something.

My feet froze to the ground as I swear a claw or some other sharp part of this thing‚Äôs body clung to the side of the house. I watched the about go upwards as if the thing were climbing up the wall or possibly standing up. If it was the latter, the thing was at least seven feet tall.

‚ÄúHey!‚Äù Called someone, making me almost shit my pants. I turned to see a middle-aged woman standing at the edge of the field. I turned back to the shed to see whatever was staring at me was gone. I heard footsteps running away and decided it was just a deer and my brain had concocted the rest due to lack of sleep.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll call the cops if you don't leave right now!‚Äù She cried.

‚ÄúI'm looking for someone related to Mr. Grayson,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm, uh, from the auction company and found something they may want to keep.‚Äù

She considered me for a moment before waving me over. She introduced herself as, Maggie, Mr. Grayson‚Äôs niece, saying she was there to put up a For Sale sign. I told her about the letters, explaining they were all signed by someone named Danny.

‚ÄúI bet it was those are from that old vagabond that Uncle Mark let live on his property,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúHe stayed in a camper right over there.‚Äù Maggie pointed to a spot in the field missing a large patch of grass. ‚ÄúHe worked for my uncle who kinda took pity on the guy. They had a falling out, though. I'm not sure why.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd his name was Danny?‚Äù

‚ÄúUncle Mark called him Dan,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúHis last name was Silas or Sorez? Something like that.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you know where he lives?‚Äù

She cocked her head at me.

‚ÄúPlease, I think he‚Äôll really want these back.‚Äù

She thought for a moment before saying, ‚ÄúI'll call my uncle‚Äôs old office. We keep a record of all the employees new and old.‚Äù

She stepped away while making the phone call as I stared across the field, allowing a smile to form across my face.

\*\*\*

*Dear mom and dad,*

*I killed her. I didn‚Äôt mean to. It was last night and I‚Äôve been sitting at the table ever since, staring at the pen and paper. I wasn‚Äôt sure I should write it down, but I think it‚Äôs helping. With her gone, I think the monster will come for me. If I do die and someone finds these letters, please take them to my mom and dad. I‚Äôm going to try to go home again. I don‚Äôt have any other choice.*

*Sincerely,*

*Daniel*

My hands shook as I dialed the number and a man answered. I introduced myself and asked if he was Daniel Silas. He responded that his name was Daniel Sorez and asked what I wanted.

I swallowed the spit that‚Äôd been collecting in my throat since I‚Äôd made the call and said, ‚ÄúI think I have your letters.‚Äù

He paused.

‚ÄúDid you get lost in the woods in 1987?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúBring me the letters,‚Äù he said.

I paused, thinking this moment would never happen. I want to blurt out all the questions I‚Äôd been holding onto the last month.

‚ÄúBring me the fucking letters,‚Äù he reiterated.

‚ÄúI will if you answer my questions.‚Äù

\*\*\*

Daniel lived in a trailer park a few miles from my place. I stared at the old, off-white trailer for almost 20 minutes before leaving my car. There weren‚Äôt any decorations on the outside. The only thing that told me the trailer wasn‚Äôt abandoned was the smoke leaving from the metal pipe sticking out from the roof.

I knocked several times before hearing movement inside. My entire body clenched as the sound of footsteps got closer. When Daniel opened the door, he wasn‚Äôt at all what I expected. I‚Äôm not sure what I was expecting, actually. But he looked so‚Ä¶ normal, like someone you‚Äôd see at the grocery store or gas station without giving it a second thought.

His skin was wrinkled and spotted with freckles in various places. He looked to be in his late 50s and had a salt-and-pepper mustache.

We stood in silence for a few moments before he pointed at the case of letters in my arms. I‚Äôd almost forgotten I was holding them. I handed them over and he cocked his head, telling me to follow him inside.

The inside of his trailer was almost bare. He had a recliner, a TV, and a small dining room table in the adjacent kitchen. The place smelled like cigarettes and soiled cat litter with a slight hint of air fresheners as if he‚Äôd made an attempt to cover the smell. We sat at the table and he immediately examined the box.

‚ÄúUm, thanks for agreeing to meet me,‚Äù I said, breaking the silence.

He didn‚Äôt look up from the box while opening it and sifting through the letters. ‚ÄúHow did you find these?‚Äù

‚ÄúA friend of mine bought a whole bunch of stuff from the Grayson property,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúHis niece said you used to live there and worked for Mr. Grayson.‚Äù

Daniel looked at me, then nodded. ‚ÄúYou any read of em? Guess you‚Äôd have to know my name.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, I‚Äôve actually read almost all of them,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI hope that‚Äôs okay. I just‚Ä¶ I couldn‚Äôt stop after reading the first one.‚Äù

He was silent for a long time, looking at the letters one by one as if searching for a particular one.

‚ÄúUm, I actually had a few questions,‚Äù I said before clearing my throat.

‚ÄúYeah? Like what?‚Äù

‚ÄúUm, I guess‚Ä¶ did this‚Ä¶ did it actually happen?‚Äù

He finally looked up from the box, then leaned back and stared down at me. ‚ÄúWhat part?‚Äù

‚ÄúAny of it‚Ä¶ I guess?‚Äù

He let out one laugh and said, ‚ÄúWell, I did get lost in the woods when I was five years old and was out there for a long time.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat about Mrs. Everly?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat about her?‚Äù

‚ÄúI assume she was real considering how detailed you were about her.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh yeah, she was real.‚Äù

‚ÄúDid you ever find out who she was?‚Äù I asked.

He shook his head. ‚ÄúI wondered for a while if she was real or if I‚Äôd gone crazy while living in the woods, but no, she was real as sin.‚Äù

I asked him about the Grayson place where I found the letters and he said Mr. Grayson allowed him to live in a camper on his property during a particularly hard point in his life in his 30s. He was working for Mr. Grayson at the time.

He didn‚Äôt go into detail but had apparently overstayed his welcome at Mr. Grayson‚Äôs and was kicked off the property and threatened with a shotgun to the chest if he ever came back. He said he‚Äôd always planned on going back for the letters but eventually stopped thinking about them. At least, until I contacted him.

I took a deep breath before asking the next question. ‚ÄúDid you kill her?‚Äù I knew it was stupid to ask. I knew he could be dangerous and would hurt or possibly kill me knowing that I knew what he‚Äôd done, but I had to see his reaction.

‚ÄúYup,‚Äù he said matter-of-factly, surprising me. ‚ÄúGood luck proving it, though. From what I‚Äôve found, the bitch never existed.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúI, uh, I don‚Äôt blame you. She kept you locked up for years it seems and, some of the things she did to you...‚Äù

His eye twitched and he cocked his head but didn‚Äôt say anything.

‚ÄúHow‚Äôd you find your way back after she died?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúShe taught me a lot about the woods; what to eat, what not to eat, how to listen to animal sounds for signals about what was happening in the forest, and how to track game. By the time she was gone, I knew how to survive in the woods until I found my way out.‚Äù

We were silent for another few moments. He shifted in his seat, telling me he was ready for me to leave, but I still had another question. One I wanted the answer to more than any of the rest.

‚ÄúThe monster,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúWas it real or did Mrs. Everly make it up?‚Äù

He paused, then said, ‚ÄúYeah. It was some lie that crazy bitch told me to make sure I didn‚Äôt leave.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh,‚Äù I said, my head sinking. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ you described it in a lot of detail in one of your letters.‚Äù

‚ÄúLook, kid, when I say Mrs. Everly was fucked in the head I‚Äôm not exaggerating. Sometimes, she would give me this tea that made me see things. It kept me anxious and scared. That‚Äôs what she wanted and it worked.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, well, you never mentioned that in the letters.‚Äù

He leaned forward. ‚ÄúDo you really need to believe there was a monster out there in the woods and not just someone lonely woman whose mind finally broke after a lifetime of isolation?‚Äù

I sighed and nodded my head. ‚ÄúWell, thanks for telling me all that. Could I just ask one more question?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy not?‚Äù

‚ÄúDid you ever go back?‚Äù

‚ÄúTo the cabin? Why the fuck would I do that?‚Äù

I shrugged my shoulders. I wasn‚Äôt sure why I asked.

‚ÄúThe only reason I would go back to that place would be to burn it to the ground. That answer your fucking questions?‚Äù

His tone told me it was time to leave. I watched the trailer in my rearview as I drove away, trying to force myself to feel like I‚Äôd found the ending I was looking for.

\*\*\*

When I got home, I noticed something sitting on the front porch. It was an envelope, one worn and dirty like the ones in Daniel‚Äôs box. I figured I dropped one on the way out. However, my name was written on the front. I thought I was seeing things at first, but there it was, in black ink, my name.

*You want to know more? You want the truth of what happened to Daniel? You want to know the secrets of the woods? I've got the answers for you. Below, you'll find a list of instructions to find me:*

*Pass the tree line into the forest, any tree line, and stop at the first clearing you come upon. Sit on the ground for one hour, moving as minimally as possible. Follow the deer.*

*Signed,*

*Mrs. Everly*

The letter sat on my desk for a long time. It sounded insane but what part of this wasn't? Part of me wanted it all to be over. I could go back to having friends, thinking about college, not spending all day in my room either researching missing kids cases in the area or reading more letters. But I knew I couldn't stop. Something inside wouldn't allow me.

I followed the instructions, traveling to the closest state park and walking into the first dense area of trees I found. The first clearing was mile or so inside and was filled with yellow and purple flowers. I found a spot to sit and closed my eyes, listening to the wind and sounds of insects and birds. Everything was calm for a moment.

An hour passed and I looked around for signs of a deer. When I didn't see any, I laughed to myself, thinking the letter must've been a joke or some petty revenge from Jameson. I stood up and started back the way I came.

When I reached the edge of the clearing, I saw it peeking from the trees. A small doe staring right at me. We stared at each other for a few minutes before it turned and walked into the woods.

It walked the trail with the ease and comfort of an animal three times its size. I paused wondering if I should really follow this deer into the woods. If this was actually ‚Äúthe deer‚Äù it meant there was something strange in these woods that couldn't be explained by normal conventions. Does that mean there was actually a monster out there?

We came to a small ridge at the end of the trail. The deer turned to me before jumping off the ridge. I ran to it and saw the cabin sitting several yards below in a shallow ditch. It was small and appeared to have been there for decades without any maintenance.

I could go back now, I thought. I could be satisfied with what I'd already found out and move on. I stared for a while before taking a deep breath and making my way down.

¬†

\*\*\*

¬†

It was quiet and dimly lit inside. Dust covered all areas of the small interior, which only featured a coffee table, a few chairs, and a fireplace. I moved through the cabin, looking for any signs of life when I heard a shuffling behind me. I turned and saw a figure sitting in one of the chairs, hidden in the darkness.

‚ÄúHave a seat,‚Äù the figure said in a woman‚Äôs voice, motioning to a chair across from her.

I did as she said, feeling my blood run cold as I scanned her face, looking for any distinguishing features. However, the darkness perfectly encapsulated most of her head, except for the bottom of her chin, which was wrinkled and had one long strand of hair.

The rest of her body that I could see was also wrinkled and dirtied with some black substance, maybe coal?

‚ÄúAre you‚Ä¶ Mrs. Everly?‚Äù I asked.

Her chin moved. ‚ÄúI am,‚Äù she said, the coldness of her voice making me shift in my seat.

‚ÄúAnd you kidnapped Daniel Sorez?‚Äù I asked.

She laughed. ‚ÄúKidnapped is a strong word. I helped him find his way here if that‚Äôs what you mean.‚Äù

I gulped. ‚ÄúYou scared him into staying here by saying there was a monster in the woods.‚Äù

‚ÄúThere is,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúYou read his letters, correct? Did you read the one in which he described it?‚Äù

‚Äú...Yeah. You drugged him.‚Äù

She laughed, which made me clench my fists.

‚ÄúIt's not funny!‚Äù I yelled.

I couldn‚Äôt believe how much I was pressing her, but something about being in this cabin, knowing she actually kept a kid here for decades, it pissed me off. Plus, the woman had to be old as fuck at that point. There wasn‚Äôt anything she could do to me.

‚ÄúHe also said you died,‚Äù I said.

She laughed but didn‚Äôt answer, making me clench my fists tighter.

‚ÄúIn the letters, you were so horrible to him,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúHow could you do that to a kid?‚Äù

Her chair creaked and she moved her fingers along the arms. ‚ÄúI was jealous of him at first,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThis new‚Ä¶ being to the world with a family that loved him and a whole life ahead of him. It's what I thought when I first saw him through the veil.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe veil?‚Äù I asked, but she ignored the question.

‚ÄúI hated him for it,‚Äù she said ‚ÄúWhy did I waste my entire life in this one fucking place and he gets to be free!? What was so different between me and him? I was a little, cute kid too.‚Äù

I had my answer and my ending. All along, it was just a crazy old woman who kidnapped an unsuspecting kid, fed him drugs, and beat him until he built up the courage to leave. It‚Äôs the ending I always expected, but not the one I wanted.

‚ÄúI think you should come back with me,‚Äù I said. While I doubted anyone would believe my story or prosecute a 90-something-year-old woman, I thought maybe the letters and testimony from Daniel would help her get the punishment she deserved.¬†

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt leave,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI thought you read those letters. The monster is out there.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt let Daniel leave,‚Äù I said, humoring her.

‚ÄúBah,‚Äù she spat. ‚ÄúIt never liked him.‚Äù

¬†‚ÄúSo, what is it?‚Äù

‚ÄúI'm not sure where it came from or how long it's been here. Maybe it's always been here, but it attaches itself to those lost in the woods. That's how it found me so long ago.‚Äù

She continued, ‚ÄúEvery time I tried to leave, it pulled me back. I think it likes having someone here, in this sad excuse for an actual home, like a pet.‚Äù

‚ÄúLittle Danny, I saw him just on the other side of the veil. I convinced it to let me get Danny so I wouldn't be lonely, though I had ulterior motives, I'm afraid. I thought maybe it would take Danny as my replacement. He could be its new pet and I could spend the remaining years away from here. Come to find out, you're stuck here even after you die if it likes you that much.‚Äù

It took me a moment to notice I‚Äôd stopped breathing. Goosebumps filled my arms and my heart was beating like I‚Äôd just run a marathon.

Slowly, Mrs. Everly stood up and moved towards me. I was frozen to my chair as her body entered the tiny sliver of light, piece by piece. Her feet were grey with dark toenails, several of them missing from each foot. Her legs were covered in scars and deep purple veins. She wore a dirty, white gown with tears all through it, revealing wrinkled spots of pale skin and musculature as if some of her wounds never healed but stopped bleeding.

Finally, I saw her face. Like the rest of her, it was covered in scars and deep cuts. Her eyes were cloudy and sounded by dark circles.

A loud screech sounded outside. It was the most horrible sound I‚Äôve ever heard, like a mix of a cougar‚Äôs scream and tires screeching, amplified as loud as a concert. After a few moments, it stopped and I said, ‚ÄúI need to leave!‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre through the veil now,‚Äù Mrs. Everly said, now wearing a soft smile. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no leaving for us.‚Äù

The screech sounded again, though Mrs. Everly didn‚Äôt react, still smiling.

‚ÄúWhy? Why did you bring me here?‚Äù I asked.

Her smile grew wider than should've been possible. ‚ÄúI do what it says. It wanted you here‚Ä¶ I think it likes you.‚Äù

\*\*\*

I don't know when I'll be able to leave. I‚Äôve tried a few times but it keeps stopping me. It‚Äôs just as Daniel described, a tall, monstrous thing with no face. There are no clues in the cabin as to what it is or where it came from and Mrs. Everly has been no help at all. I‚Äôll find out, though. I know I will, and once I do, I‚Äôm going home.

If you're reading this, I'm guessing the monster, or whatever it is, likes you too. I put a handful of Daniel‚Äôs envelopes in here too, just the ones I kept without telling him.

I know based on Daniel‚Äôs letters that they don't always end up in the place you want them to go, so if you do receive this, please let my mom and dad know what happened. You'll find their address below.

‚ÄúThat's mine,‚Äù he'd announced, swooping into the kitchen. 

‚ÄúGet your *own* banana.‚Äù I grabbed it back. 

‚ÄúI *did*,‚Äù he spat. ‚ÄúMom says I'm a growing boy.‚Äù

I snorted. ‚ÄúYou're *shrinking! I'm the youngest. Take growth vitamins!‚Äù

*Pop!*

I thought he'd thrown coffee in my face. 

That's what it felt like. 

Coffee. 

Thicker, a little sludgier. When the adrenaline and shock wore off, and I was left blinking through red sludge dripping from my eyelashes, I realized his blood was covering me‚Äî painting me. 

What was matted in my hair and tinting my lips. 

Everything was *red*. 

Everything was *Liam*. 

He pooled from the countertop, grotesque chunks of him clinging to the walls. 

I took two shaky steps back, slipping in what was left of him seeping across the floor. The banana‚Äî now stained revealing scarlet, dropped from my hand. 

For a moment, the world was silent and *red*. Far too red to be real. 

I swiped my brother‚Äôs blood from my eyes, opened my mouth, and *screamed*. 

I ran upstairs to find my mother, slipping on flowing scarlet staining each step. My sister‚Äôs room was already red. 

The grotesque splat on Maya's walls said everything. 

The police said it was, *spontaneous human combustion*. It took them.

It took grandma too, apparently, four hours before. 

But not me. 

Aunt May reluctantly took me in.

She treated me like a disease, locking me up and separating me from my cousins. 

I was hesitant to go near them, so I kept my distance. Maybe this thing really *was* contagious. One night, Noah snuck into my room. Sammy was behind him, peeking behind blonde curls. 

‚ÄúI think I know why you're cursed,‚Äù he whispered, setting his iLight down. 

The transparent screen reflected in his dark eyes. 

Of course Aunt May had bought him the newest edition with retinal scan. 

I was still struggling with the chip implant. So prehistoric. 

‚ÄúOkay, so,‚Äù Noah said, stabbing at the screen. ‚ÄúApparently, our great grandpa leaked something, a code, I think? And that's why Grammy, Aunt Bee, Liam and Maya died.‚Äù His eyes found mine. 

‚ÄúThis thing, whatever it is, is destroying our fucking bloodline as punishment.‚Äù

‚ÄúWait,‚Äù Sammy sat up. ‚ÄúBut that's us‚Äî‚Äù 

The *pop* sound was barely audible in my ears. 

I just felt my cousin coming apart, hitting me in the face, thick rivulets of red dripping down my cheek. 

Noah sat very still. Unblinking. His sister clung to his curls. Before he turned to me with questioning eyes. 

‚ÄúWhat's‚Äî‚Äù

*Pop!*

Noah was warmer than my brother. 

He was all over me.  

Still, I peered through bright red, at the iLight screen. 

This code that great grandpa leaked‚Ä¶ what was it? 

Nuclear codes? Classified info? I could already feel it, a sudden eruption in my blood, starting slow, streaking through my veins as it began its assault. 

Ripping through me. 

Just letters and a single number.

Location: Parker, CO.

Hi, I work at a popular coffee franchise and I'm currently in the process of a store transfer, pending accommodation approval. I‚Äôve been seeking an ADA accommodation related to autism, specifically for managing sensory and verbal interaction fatigue. I experience shutdowns frequently due to constant communication, and while all roles involve some level of talking, there are positions that are significantly less overstimulating.

My therapist submitted a letter recommending that I be scheduled‚Äîwhen staffing permits‚Äîfor lower-contact roles like bar, food, or support. These are standard positions within our store and don‚Äôt require additional staffing. The goal is to reduce exposure to prolonged and unpredictable verbal interactions, which can trigger overload and shutdowns.

At my current store, I was approved for a 30-minute time limit at the drive-thru window. Now that I‚Äôm transferring to a store without a drive-thru, I asked to apply that same limit to the register and possibly to the handoff position‚Äîboth of which involve high levels of customer interaction. I also requested a limit on verbal communication with customers to only essential interactions (greetings, order clarification, light small talk, thanking them) that don't require prolonged conversations, but that was denied.

The company responded that all barista roles are considered ‚Äúhigh-verbal,‚Äù and that employees are expected to engage in personalized customer interactions‚Äîincluding prolonged conversations if the customer initiates them. They also said that rotating through all roles is considered an essential job function, and that limiting more than one customer-facing role would create a logistical burden they cannot accommodate.

I understand that role flexibility is important in this type of work, but my therapist explained that these adjustments can be made using the existing staffing structure. My original request didn‚Äôt include a specific time limit‚Äîjust a role switch to something less verbal when staffing allows, and only when it wouldn‚Äôt create an undue hardship.

Does limiting multiple high-verbal roles create an undue hardship under the ADA? Or does this sound like a denial based more on internal logistics than legal grounds? I‚Äôm considering reaching out to the EEOC but would appreciate any insight first.",0,1751049679.0,legaladvice,1,0.25,False

Forced into an engagement with the cold and distant Caspian Parker, she discovers his heart belongs to her comatose sister, Anika. Devastated, Zaria makes a shocking decision: she will marry the enigmatic and feared Alistair Butler, a man with a dark past and a reputation for violence. As Zaria navigates the treacherous waters of her family‚Äôs expectations and her own heartbreak, she must confront the harsh realities of love, loyalty, and power. But what secrets lie behind Alistair‚Äôs terrifying demeanor, and can Zaria survive the storm she‚Äôs about to unleash?

# Chapter 1 - The Broken Engagement and a New Vow

Everyone said I inherited the engagement my sister didn‚Äôt want.

No matter how many times I tried to charm Caspian Parker, his hands, always clutching his rosary, wouldn‚Äôt even graze the hem of my dress.

Until that night, when I saw him kneeling by Anika Jenkins‚Äô hospital bed.

He pressed my unconscious sister‚Äôs hand against his burning desire, his voice ragged.

‚ÄúAnika, I only agreed to marry your sister so I could come see you every day.‚Äù

The next day, I tore up the engagement letter.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not marrying Caspian anymore. I‚Äôm marrying Alistair Butler.‚Äù

My mother was horrified.

‚ÄúZaria! Alistair was castrated by his rivals years ago. He‚Äôs useless now!‚Äù

I felt numb. ‚ÄúMom, it doesn‚Äôt matter who I marry.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not marrying Caspian anymore. I‚Äôm marrying Alistair.‚Äù

I set down my coffee cup, my voice soft but firm.

My mother‚Äôs face turned pale as she grabbed my arm. ‚ÄúZaria! Are you out of your mind? That Alistair, three years ago...‚Äù

She leaned in, whispering, ‚ÄúHe was castrated by his rivals. He‚Äôs practically a eunuch now! And they say he‚Äôs become terrifying since then, prone to violent outbursts. Marrying him would be suicide!‚Äù

I gently pulled my hand away, forcing a bitter smile. ‚ÄúMom, it doesn‚Äôt matter who I marry now. Besides...‚Äù

I gestured toward the living room. ‚ÄúDo you really think we can refuse the Butlers?‚Äù

In the living room, my father was pouring coffee for two sharply dressed men, his face beaming.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs such an honor that your young master has taken an interest in my daughter! But... my eldest daughter is in a coma, and my younger one is already engaged to the Parkers...‚Äù

The man sitting in the main seat slowly set down his coffee cup. ‚ÄúAn engagement can be broken.‚Äù

My father wiped his hands nervously, beads of sweat forming on his forehead. The Butlers were powerful, but their reputation in the upper circles was...

‚ÄúIf Miss Zaria is willing to marry into our family,‚Äù the man suddenly said, ‚Äúthe Butlers are prepared to offer our family heirloom, the Six-Petal Crystal Herb, as a dowry. I hear it has miraculous effects on those in comas.‚Äù

I saw my father‚Äôs eyes light up.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll marry him!‚Äù I stood up abruptly, startling everyone.

And just like that, my marriage was settled.

After the Butlers left, my father frowned at me. ‚ÄúZaria, haven‚Äôt you always loved Caspian? Why the sudden change?‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt answer, turning and walking back to my room.

Ever since my sister fell into a coma, everyone said I inherited the engagement she didn‚Äôt want.

I had loved Caspian for ten years, but he was always cold toward me. After my sister‚Äôs accident, the engagement fell to me, and I moved into his estate as his fianc√©e, thinking I could finally love him openly.

But no matter how many times I tried to seduce him, he would only politely drape a coat over my shoulders and walk away.

Until last night, when I followed him to the hospital.

I‚Äôll never forget what I saw.

He knelt by Anika‚Äôs bed, trembling as he pressed her hand against his burning desire, his voice ragged until the moment of release.

‚ÄúAnika, I only agreed to marry your sister so I could come see you every day.‚Äù

In that moment, I realized my ten years of devotion had been nothing but a joke.

# Chapter 2 - The Banquet of Awakening

The miracle drug from the Butler family worked wonders. Within three days, Anika Jenkins woke up. My father was overjoyed and decided to throw a banquet in her honor.

I stood outside the hospital room, watching the medical staff come and go, my phone in hand as I typed and deleted a message to Caspian Parker.

""Tonight‚Äôs the banquet at home. Will you come?""

As usual, the message went unanswered.

An hour before the banquet was set to begin, I finally couldn‚Äôt resist and called him.

His cold, distant voice came through the receiver, ""I‚Äôm in the middle of a meditation retreat. What is it?""

""Anika‚Äôs awake,"" I said softly.

\*Clatter!\*

The sound of prayer beads hitting the floor echoed from the other end. His breathing became noticeably unsteady. ""I‚Äôll be there.""

See? When it comes to Anika, even the most detached monk breaks his vows.

After hanging up, I walked to the staircase and saw Anika, wearing the dress my best friend had designed for me, laughing and chatting with the crowd.

""Zaria, I borrowed your dress. You don‚Äôt mind, do you?"" She twirled gracefully, the skirt flaring out. ""I just woke up and didn‚Äôt have time to get a new one.""

My mother gently tugged at my sleeve, whispering, ""She‚Äôs just recovered. Let her have it.""

I forced a smile. ""Of course not.""

As I turned away, I heard Anika say to her friend, ""It fits me better, don‚Äôt you think? Zaria‚Äôs too thin to fill it out.""

I silently returned to my room and changed into a simple white gown.

My father stood beaming in the center of the banquet hall. ""Anika‚Äôs awake! From today onward, she will officially take over the Jenkins family business!""

The guests applauded.

Anika smiled warmly. ""Thank you, Dad. I‚Äôll make sure to run the company well.""

""What about the second daughter?"" someone asked from the corner.

My father seemed to remember my existence only then. ""There‚Äôs a small shop in the south of town...""

Anika suddenly exclaimed, ""Oh, wasn‚Äôt that shop supposed to be for my caf√©? I even had designs drawn up for it...""

My father quickly corrected himself, ""Then the one in the north...""

I clenched my wine glass tightly. ""No need. I don‚Äôt want it.""

My father had always favored Anika. My mother, though officially married into the family, lived like a shadow. A single glance from Anika, and my father would have given her the world.

I‚Äôd seen my mother crying in the middle of the night, seen her smile through scoldings, and watched her stumble over her words in front of my father.

As the banquet reached its peak, the butler suddenly announced, ""Mr. Parker has arrived!""

Caspian walked in, dressed in a black suit, followed by two servants carrying a gift box. Inside was the deed to a resort.

""Congratulations on your recovery, Miss Jenkins.""

""This is too generous..."" Anika pretended to decline but clutched the deed tightly to her chest.

The room buzzed with whispers.

""Looks like the engagement will return to its rightful owner.""

""It was always Miss Jenkins‚Äô fianc√©. Now it‚Äôs back to where it belongs.""

""This must be so awkward for the second daughter...""

I slipped away to the balcony, the night breeze doing little to ease my frustration.

Behind me, the sound of high heels clicked against the floor.

# Chapter 3 - Shadows of Betrayal and Triumph

*By The Handicapper Who Knows Your Mother‚Äôs Secret CFL Fantasy Team*

---

**The Setup**  
The Montreal Alouettes (3-0 SU/ATS) are rolling like a backup QB on a hot streak, while the Hamilton Tiger-Cats (0-2) are stumbling like a rookie trying to parallel park. Montreal‚Äôs defense has been so dominant in the first half, they‚Äôve made halftime snacks taste like a mercy kill. Backup QB McLeod Bethel-Thompson, a two-time Grey Cup champion, steps in for the injured Davis Alexander. Don‚Äôt worry, folks‚ÄîBethel-Thompson‚Äôs r√©sum√© is so glossy, it could blind a referee.

**Key Stats & Trends**

* **Montreal‚Äôs Defense**: Allows just 12.3 PPG in the first half (CFL‚Äôs 3rd-best). They‚Äôve held opponents to 3+ turnovers in 2 of 3 games.
* **Hamilton‚Äôs Offense**: Struggles mightily, averaging 18.5 PPG (24th in CFL). Their bye week? A chance to reflect on why they‚Äôre 0-2.
* **Scoring Total**: Dropped from 50.5 to 48.5. But the author (me) thinks Montreal‚Äôs offense (led by Tyson Philpot, 4.1 YPC) and Hamilton‚Äôs porous D (28th in rushing D) will keep the fireworks going.

**Injuries & QB Notes**

* **Davis Alexander** (Montreal): Hamstring injury. Bethel-Thompson steps in. His last start? 6/8 for 77 yards. Not exactly Aaron Rodgers, but he‚Äôs got two rings.
* **Hamilton‚Äôs QB**: TBD. Let‚Äôs assume they‚Äôre still figuring out who‚Äôs under center. Spoiler: It‚Äôs probably not working.

**Odds Breakdown**

* **Moneyline**: Montreal (-110) vs. Hamilton (+110).
* **Spread**: Montreal -2.5 (-110) / Hamilton +2.5 (-110).
* **Total**: Over 48.5 (-110) / Under 48.5 (-110).

**Calculating the EV**

1. **Moneyline EV**:
   * Implied probability for Montreal: 56.8% (1 / 1.76).
   * Historical favorite win rate (NFL/CFL): 65%.
   * EV = (65% \* 0.76) - (35% \* 1) = **+14.4%**.
2. **Spread EV**:
   * Implied probability for Montreal -2.5: 50.5% (1 / 1.91).
   * Adjusted for Montreal‚Äôs 65% win rate and defensive dominance: Assume 60% cover chance.
   * EV = (60% \* 0.91) - (40% \* 1) = **+14.6%**.
3. **Total EV**:
   * Implied probability for Over 48.5: 52.6% (1 / 1.9).
   * Author‚Äôs projection: 55% chance Over.
   * EV = (55% \* 0.9) - (45% \* 1) = **+4.5%**.

**The Verdict**

* **Best Bet**: **Montreal Alouettes -2.5** (+14.6% EV).
* **Runner-Up**: **Montreal ML** (+14.4% EV).
* **Underdog Win Rate Check**: Hamilton‚Äôs 35% chance is baked into the moneyline (45% implied), but Montreal‚Äôs defense and offense make this a mismatch.

**Final Prediction**  
Montreal wins 28-17. Bethel-Thompson throws 2 TDs, Hamilton‚Äôs offense fumbles twice, and the total hits 45.5. But hey, the Over‚Äôs still a sneaky play if you‚Äôre feeling spicy.

*‚ÄúThe only thing hotter than Montreal‚Äôs defense is the price of Tim Hortons coffee in June.‚Äù* üèà‚òï

I met this girl through a mutual friend and we hit it off pretty well at first texting, sharing memes, joking around, all that. We finally decided to grab coffee, and I was honestly looking forward to it. She looked just like her photos, super cute, had a chill vibe‚Ä¶ at first. But not even five minutes into the convo, she started trash-talking her ex. Like, not just a quick ‚Äúoh he was toxic‚Äù kind of thing, but full-on dragging him, calling him names, blaming him for everything wrong in her life. I‚Äôm just sitting there nodding, sipping my coffee, trying not to look uncomfortable. I get that breakups suck, but man, I don‚Äôt want to be your therapist on a first date.

What made it worse was how she kept bringing it back to how ‚Äúmen just ain‚Äôt sh\*t.‚Äù I‚Äôve seen that stuff online, but hearing it in person from someone I just met was honestly a buzzkill. The energy just shifted and I couldn‚Äôt unsee that side of her. I was polite and stayed until the end of the coffee, but I already knew there wasn‚Äôt gonna be a second one.

Two days before my driving test, I got that golden notification‚Äîa cancellation slot for the Naas test route at 12 noon. Without wasting a second, I grabbed it. But grabbing the slot was the easy part. Now I had to actually pass.

Luckily, I had a savior. A good friend‚Äîsomeone I met through a relative‚Äîwas ready to back me up 2000%. No joke, he went above and beyond for my first ever driving test. He practiced with me three times a day, every single day, leading up to the test. And on the big day? He even took the morning off to give me a solid pre-test run.

But that morning‚Ä¶ oh boy, I was a mess.

During the pretest drive, I couldn‚Äôt stop making Grade 3 mistakes, one after another. Eventually, my friend pulled me over, looked at me calmly, and said,
‚ÄúStop the car. Get out. Go for a walk and grab a coffee.‚Äù
And honestly? That coffee walk saved me.

Once I was a little more human again, he dropped me at the Naas test centre and even waited there for me. His support was everything.

Soon enough, the examiner called my name. We went through the usual routine‚Äîsigning the declaration, heading out to the car, the whole checklist. He asked me to open the bonnet (standard stuff), then checked the indicators. All good so far.

Then he got into the car and said,
‚ÄúAlright, let‚Äôs begin.‚Äù

That‚Äôs when the fun really started.

As soon as I turned the ignition on, my car‚Äôs fancy screen lit up with a big, bold warning:

‚ÄúBONNET OPEN.‚Äù

There we were, in the middle of the road. I stared at my examiner with a totally clueless face‚Äîlike a deer in headlights. He just said,
‚ÄúPlease close the bonnet.‚Äù

And I‚Äôm thinking, ‚ÄúOh no, please don‚Äôt fail me for this.‚Äù

Without even turning on the hazard lights (yes, I know‚Ä¶), I jumped out and shut it properly. That was my dramatic start to the test.

We continued, and five minutes in, the examiner directed me into a housing estate.
Then came the reverse exercise.
And I thought, ‚ÄúEasy. Let me show you how it‚Äôs done.‚Äù

But no. I hit the kerb.ü´£ü´£ü´£

And to make it worse? There was a van right behind me, and I could feel the examiner‚Äôs eyes drilling into my soul.

In that moment, all I could think was,
Well f***. There goes the test. That‚Äôs a Grade 3 for sure.‚Äù

It was chaotic, nerve-wracking, and totally unpredictable‚Äîbut hey, that‚Äôs what makes it a story worth telling. What happened next? Did I pass? That‚Äôs a tale for another day

1lm1eox,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lm1eox,Was this 8hr Swedish Ration any good?,"Hi folks!

An 8hr Swedish ration from a company called ""24 Hour Meals."" Menu 8, still in date.

Man, I have some real mixed feelings on this ration. 

Pics 1,2,6,7, and 8 show packaging and contents. Pic 8 is interesting as the bag had a built in divider to keep your trash separated from your remaining food items. A very clever design in my opinion!

As you can see, this a nicely put together ration that includes both coffee and a cold beverage base (black currant in this case), great protein sources, pocket snacks, gum, and an ample main dish.

Pic 3 shows the peanuts. These were just fine but not nearly as good as the well known Walker roasted peanuts. 

Pic 4 shows the raspberry protein bar. Very suttle raspberry flavor. This bar was great. Very nice Texture, not overly sweet, no terrible aftertaste, just nice and chewy and satisfying. 

Pic 5 is where things start coming off the rails. This is Pasta Carbonara with Cheese. I'm sort of gagging a bit as I wrote this, I won't lie. This main was really hard to get down. Not as hard as the Canadian IMP breakfast patties, but still hard nonetheless.  The flavor was ok, it's the texture that's so off-putting. It's just ""gloopy"" and thick and I did not enjoy it at all. After the first few bites my mantra took over....""I paid for it, so I'm gonna eat it."" When that's your motivation to finish, you know the experience was not ideal. Has a lot of bacon in it and the pasta noodles were fine in terms of texture. 

The gum was fine, beverage base was given away to a buddy,  and the protein drink was mixed with the coffee and some fiber powder and drank for breakfast. It was great. 25 grams of protein I think with very little sugar, essentially the opposite of all US MRE protein drinks, where the sugars are 3-5x that of the protein. 

Conclusion: Try one of these meals, they are a nice experience, but I'd avoid Menu 8.

Look at the Supra. Toyota gave us the manual, and yeah, it made up 43% of sales in 2023 and 65% in 2024. But total Supra sales still dropped nearly 50% after the manual came out. From almost 5,000 units in 2022 to just 2,600 last year.

Here‚Äôs the thing though, it‚Äôs not the manual‚Äôs fault. The irony is that most buyers aren‚Äôt enthusiasts. Randy from accounting doesn‚Äôt give a shit that the C8 Corvette doesn‚Äôt come with a stick shift or that its brake vents are fake. He just wants to whip his balls out at Cars & Coffee and tell people it‚Äôs ‚Äúfaster than a Ferrari for half the price.‚Äù

Supercars prove this too. Everyone worships gated manuals now, but when Ferrari and Lamborghini actually offered them, nobody ordered them. They sat on showroom floors collecting dust until suddenly they were worth six figures on Bring a Trailer because ‚Äúvintage driving experience bro.‚Äù

That‚Äôs the Morbius Effect. Like how Morbius got memed into re-releasing in theaters with everyone ironically chanting ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Morbin‚Äô time,‚Äù only for nobody to show up. The hype was deafening, but real intent was nonexistent.

It‚Äôs sad honestly. If we do nothing about it, nothing will change. Not every buyer is a Cars & Bids window-shopping chud fantasizing about their fifth project car. We‚Äôre going to keep losing the options we love cause we‚Äôre all broke and can‚Äôt buy their cars stick shift or not.

But I must give this *EDP Intense* a tip of the hat. Christine Nagel has produced a great fragrance here.

The opening is fresh and spicy, maybe even just a bit sweet. Then it mellows into a smokey citrus with a hint of [reheated cold brew] coffee and caramel, with a dash of pepper. It feels like it wants to highlight the coffee note but wrapped in a woody licorice with strains of vetiver. Yes, that sounds very strange but it totally works.

There is apparently a lava stone note which shows up late in the drydown. Maybe less cooled rock and more partially molten lava with singed tobacco leaf as collateral damage in its path. That could be what is described as mineralic but it‚Äôs much more.

What I enjoy the most about it is how elegant it comes across. Perfect for the person that has unambiguous opinions but won‚Äôt aggressively inflict them on passers-by. Like ET, it still calls home to the OG TdH EDT but this one has moved out of the house as adulting calls.

This love I speak of isn‚Äôt just ink on paper or fleeting glances. It‚Äôs a silence that roars, a code etched into the soul‚Äîa love that arrives before words, reading you like sacred verses before you turn the page. It‚Äôs that moment when two hearts forget how to beat alone, dancing instead to a rhythm only the universe understands.  

Have you ever stood before someone and felt your hands tremble for no reason? Your breath catching not from fear, but from the sheer gravity of a veil lifting? That‚Äôs its first glimpse of you. It traces the flicker in your eyes before you blink. It hears the question trembling on your lips before you whisper it.

Yung dummy acc nayun is somehow his ex-gf who couldn‚Äôt move one. (They broke up in January, and me and my bf met in May, But in these span of months, sobrang dami nya palang nka FUBU at fling). She made a dummy acc to steal scndal videos from prn sites and send it to all of my families, friends and even schoolmates. To the point nasira ako at halos mabaliw. Nung una wala akong idea sino nasa likod nun until nagkagulo gulo na ang lahat and he admitted na he sent my photos pala to his ex-gf. And recently I found out na may nangyari parin pala sa kanila on the days na nililigawan na ako ng bf ko. Sobrang denial nya sa part na ito even I confronted him so many times. Not once but twice may nangyari ! And sa mga panahon na to wala pa nangyayari sa amin ni bf. I am a virgin while recently ko lang din nalaman na more than 15 girls na pala dumaan sa kanya. Anyway, past nya na yan but during the times he courted me, sabi nya 3 lang exes nya. He was my first, Btw. KUNG ALAM KO LANG SANA ‚Äì

Fast forward, 2 years na kami now, still the trauma haunts me kasi until now pumupunta parin sya minsan sa house ng ex gf nya kasi kababata nya yung mga kapatid na lalaki nun. Ang ayaw ko lng is NAGSISINUNGALING sya , buti nalang nalalaman ko talaga na dun sya pumumunta. Na trauma ako knowing na hindi ako naka revenge or get my justice, (tried reporting sa police but they says they have no power in social media, especially dummy accounts). And now parang back to normal lang ang lahat. Cheater and kunsintidor din lahat ng kuya nung ex gf nya that‚Äôs why I have no peace and trust sa friendship nila. I tried to explained him everything, he felt sorry but this is not the first time he promised na di na sya pupunta dun for my peace of mind. And now, sobrang galit nya kasi nahuli ko at ako pa ang toxic. Sawa nadaw sya sa ugali ko at masyado ko na syang ginagawang puppet. Am i asking too much?

Chapter 1  
  
In the fifth year of their marriage, Julian Mitchell cheated.  
  
He secretly kept a mistress behind Serena Caldwell's back. When Serena found out, she didn't make a scene. Instead, the very next day, she arranged for the mistress to willingly leave with a wealthy businessman from Seattle.  
  
After that day, Julian tacitly returned to family life, resuming his role as the tender, attentive husband.  
  
Serena thought it was just a small hiccup in their marriage.  
  
But a year later, everything fell apart‚Äî  
  
Her family's company declared bankruptcy. Her father jumped to his death, crushed under massive debt. Her mother was brutally assaulted by creditors until she died. Her brother was left in a vegetative state after being hit by a car.  
  
And Serena, unable to bear these consecutive blows, fell critically ill.  
  
In her final moments, Julian's face contorted with rage: ""When you sent Melody to that old man, causing her to be tortured to death in bed without an inch of unbruised skin, you should have known this day would come. Serena, this is your karma!""  
  
So that's how it was...  
  
This had all been Julian's revenge.  
  
Serena lay in bed, her face deathly pale, staring blankly at the man she had loved with her life, before finally dying with hatred in her heart.  
  
When she opened her eyes again, she was standing at the study door.  
  
Her heart pounded with lingering shock and grief, but before she could process everything, she heard a conversation from inside.  
  
Julian was on the phone.  
  
""Thanks, man. Just transfer that suburban villa to Melody's name for now. I owe you one. And remember, don't let my wife find out.""  
  
This familiar conversation jolted Serena into awareness.  
  
She had been reborn!  
  
Yes, this was exactly the moment when she had accidentally discovered Julian was keeping a mistress.  
  
As she collected herself, she heard him continue: ""Melody is special. When I'm with her, I feel relaxed and passionate. Not like with Serena‚Äîshe only makes me feel suffocated, boring and dull. I'm just taking a breather. When I get tired of playing around, it won't affect my love for my wife.""  
  
Hearing it again, her heart still sank painfully.  
  
Serena clenched her fingers, remembering his cruel words before her death in her previous life. Despite herself, her eyes reddened.  
  
Pushing those thoughts aside, she returned to the sofa.  
  
When Julian came out and saw her, he froze.  
  
""Babe, when did you get back?"" he asked.  
  
""Just now,"" Serena replied calmly.  
  
Julian's smile faltered into nervousness when he realized his wife, who should have been out shopping, had returned early. ""There's an issue with a project. I need to head back to the office,"" he said.  
  
It was the same excuse as in her previous life.  
  
Serena stared at him for a beat: ""Okay, go ahead.""  
  
In this life, she was tired. She didn't want to cling anymore.  
  
As expected, Julian didn't come home that night.  
  
Meanwhile, Serena sat motionless until dawn. When the first rays of sunlight streamed through the window, she rubbed her tired, burning eyes, then got up, forced down some breakfast, and headed out the door.  
  
She visited a law firm first, then headed to Mitchell Enterprises.  
  
Julian's office was on the top floor. When Serena stepped out of the elevator, the reception area was empty, but moans could be heard from inside his office.  
  
""Mmm... Mr. Mitchell, Melody can't take it anymore\~""  
  
""Mr. Mitchell?!"" Julian snapped, immediately displeased. He gripped her waist and thrust harder, causing the woman beneath him to moan louder.  
  
Then, in a half-coaxing, half-commanding tone, he asked: ""Melody's being naughty. What should you call me?""  
  
The woman clutched his hand, feeling as if she were floating on clouds.  
  
""B-baby, Melody won't dare again, I promise\~""  
  
""Good girl!""  
  
Serena's nails dug painfully into her palms. Though she had already discovered the truth, her heart still shattered in that moment.  
  
After a long pause, she finally knocked on the door.  
  
When she entered, Julian was sitting at his desk, looking thoroughly satisfied. ""What brings you here?"" he asked.  
  
""I need you to sign some papers,"" Serena replied, pulling divorce papers from her bag.  
  
She then flipped to the signature page and handed it across the desk.  
  
""What documents?"" Julian asked, taking the papers.  
  
He was about to glance at it when a soft moan came from under the desk. His body shuddered as he leaned back, then quickly recovered, clearing his throat a few times to cover up the sound.  
  
Serena pretended not to hear, her nails digging crescents into her bag as she swallowed the bitter lump in her throat. ""Nothing special, just property transfer papers.""  
  
Hearing this, Julian's suspicion faded.  
  
He eagerly grabbed a pen from the desk and signed his name with a flourish. ""You could have had someone deliver these. Don't tire yourself out.""  
  
Was he worried about her getting tired, or worried about her discovering his secret?  
  
Serena's lips curled into a sneer. ""It's fine, just this once. You can get back to work now.""  
  
Once outside, she immediately made a phone call: ""I can sell you twenty percent of Mitchell Enterprises at a discount.""  
  
""Good. When do we sign?""  
  
""In a month.""  
  
By then, their divorce would be final, and she would be rid of the company she had helped build with her blood, sweat, and tears.  
  
Julian, in my past life you accused me of getting rid of your mistress.  
  
So this time, I'll do exactly as you wish.  
  
Chapter 2  
  
Before leaving, Serena went to the restroom.  
  
When she came out, she ran into Melody Leverett coming toward her. The woman had an hourglass figure but an innocent face‚Äîexactly the type men found irresistible.  
  
""Mrs. Mitchell, you're still here?"" Melody made no attempt to hide anything.  
  
She deliberately exposed her cleavage, where love marks served as both flaunting and provocation.  
  
Serena stopped, examining her.  
  
In her previous life, she had used swift, harsh methods to make Melody back down in less than a day, brokering a deal that had the woman voluntarily resign as secretary and leave for Seattle.  
  
But now, she couldn't be bothered to play games.  
  
She ignored Melody and walked toward the elevator, but after a few steps, coffee was splashed on her back.  
  
""Oops\~!"" Melody exclaimed with false concern, waving her cup. ""So sorry, I'm still shaky from... helping Mr. Mitchell relieve some tension. My hand's still trembling.""  
  
Hearing those words, Serena pictured their entangled bodies and felt nauseated.  
  
She had no desire to participate in their relationship drama, but she wouldn't let herself be humiliated.  
  
So she stepped forward quickly and slapped Melody across the face.  
  
Just then, Julian walked out of his office.  
  
Melody seized the opportunity, falling in front of Serena and kneeling as she clutched her face. ""I'm so sorry, Mrs. Mitchell! It was an accident, please don't be angry with me.""  
  
Julian rushed over and pushed Serena aside. Her already burned back hit the corner of the wall, making her gasp in pain.  
  
But Julian didn't notice. Instead, he crouched beside Melody and asked: ""What happened?""  
  
Melody pouted fearfully and said, ""I was feeling lightheaded from low blood sugar and accidentally spilled coffee on Mrs. Mitchell's back. She slapped me, which I deserved, but I feel so dizzy now.""  
  
Hearing this, Julian glared at Serena.  
  
His eyes blazed with barely contained fury as he said: ""She's just an intern! Everyone makes mistakes when they're new. Did you really need to make such a big deal out of it?""  
  
With that, he immediately carried Melody into his office.  
  
Watching his anxious retreating back, Serena's pent-up frustration spilled over in two lines of tears.  
  
She remembered how once, when she had just cut her finger, Julian had panicked and rushed her to the emergency room, much to the doctor's amusement. Yet now he was showing that same concern for someone else.  
  
Despite her resolve to let go, her heart still ached terribly.  
  
She forced herself to stand straight, left the company, and went directly to the court to file for divorce. Once the cooling-off period ended, her marriage to Julian would be over for good.  
  
Back home, Julian was nowhere to be found.  
  
He had only sent a message saying he was working late at the office and reminding her not to be late for tomorrow's client dinner.  
  
It was a business dinner they had previously agreed to attend.  
  
Serena simply replied ""okay.""  
  
She didn't mention the hurt she'd suffered that day, nor did she expose his ""working late"" lie.  
  
Because none of it mattered anymore.  
  
The next day at the venue, she didn't see Julian. Instead, she found Melody waiting.  
  
""Mr. Mitchell is still in a meeting. He asked me to let you know and said I should join you to learn,"" Melody explained, suddenly all business-like.  
  
Serena could only lead her into the private room.  
  
During the dinner, Melody kept enthusiastically toasting the client, practically draping herself over him. The implication was clear to anyone watching.  
  
Serena had always despised such tactics, so she excused herself to use the restroom.  
  
When she returned, the private room was surrounded by people. She pushed through the crowd and entered to find chaos.  
  
Julian had arrived.  
  
But the client was lying in a pool of blood...  
  
Chapter 3  
  
""What's going on here?!""  
  
Serena asked in bewilderment.  
  
But when she saw Melody's disheveled clothes as she trembled in Julian's arms, she understood.  
  
He had flown into a rage to protect his mistress. Then, unexpectedly, she too received a slap across her face.  
  
""What's going on? Like you don't know?!"" Julian's eyes were bloodshot with fury as he glared at her like an enraged lion. ""Serena, if you want to play the sleeping-your-way-to-the-top game, I won't stop you, but leave Melody out of it. She's innocent, unlike you who'll do anything to get ahead.""  
  
Serena stood frozen in shock.  
  
Her cheek stung, but his words hurt far worse.  
  
She would do anything to get ahead?!  
  
During the company's early years when they often had to chase business deals, she had once faced a similar situation. Rather than compromise, she had fought her way out, offending the client.  
  
Back then, Julian had stormed in, beating the man severely and getting detained for days. But he had comforted her: ""You did great. Thank you for protecting yourself, my darling.""  
  
Later, everyone knew how much she despised using sex for business.  
  
Yet now, in Julian's eyes, she had become a woman who would do anything for a deal.  
  
A tear slipped from Serena's eye. ""Is that really who you think I am?""  
  
Julian faltered, his resolve wavering.  
  
Just then, Melody clutched his shirt, her face flushed as she said: ""Mr. Mitchell, Mrs. Mitchell told me to keep toasting Mr. Zemo. I said I couldn't handle alcohol, but he kept forcing drinks on me. I feel terrible now.""  
  
His expression hardened again, his gaze at Serena turning venomous: ""People change. I don't even recognize you anymore.""  
  
With that, he picked Melody up and left.  
  
Serena lowered her eyes, silent for a long while before forcing a smile that looked more pained than tears.  
  
Yes, people do change.  
  
He was no longer her Julian.  
  
On her way home, she was dragged into a dark alley.  
  
""What are you doing?!"" Serena's face paled with fear.  
  
But they ignored her completely, pinning her firmly to the ground and answering her question with brutal action instead of words.  
  
Ninety-nine bottles of hard liquor were stacked on the ground.  
  
One by one, the men opened them and forced the burning liquid down her throat. Serena tried to scream for help, but could only choke and gasp.  
  
The alcohol scorched her throat, burning and painful.  
  
Serena struggled desperately, but like a lamb on a butcher's block, she couldn't move. All she could do was cry silently.  
  
After emptying the bottles, the men tore at her delicate clothing, exposing her snow-white skin and causing them to leer with lustful eyes.  
  
""Wait!"" one of them suddenly spoke up. ""We were only told to teach her a lesson. Don't take this too far‚Äîwe can't afford to cross that line.""  
  
But another sneered: ""What are you afraid of? Have you ever seen a man be this vicious to his own wife? Even if we sleep with her, he'd probably thank us.""  
  
Her eyes flew open in shock, like a thunderbolt had struck her.  
  
Were they talking about Julian?  
  
Just because Melody had pretended to be force-fed alcohol and nearly taken advantage of, he was furious enough to want her to experience the same...  
  
He truly loved Melody to such an extreme.  
  
Just as one of the men was about to touch her skin with his filthy hands, police sirens wailed outside. Then a woman shouted: ""Stop! I've called the police!""  
  
The men scattered in panic.  
  
Serena escaped danger, but stared blankly at the night sky, seeming soul-less.  
  
Suddenly, she broke into sobs.  
  
All her pent-up anguish poured out. Soon she was retching violently on the ground, emptying her stomach until there was nothing left, before shakily standing and making her way home.

As long as my boundaries aren't crossed, I never make things difficult for others, let alone resort to violence.","# Thorough Story Summary, Honest Review & How to Read It

Chapter 1



My billionaire husband spends millions on sponsored a college girl's art exhibition, but refuses to pay $2,000 for our son's medical treatment.



After my son died from severe diarrhea and dehydration right before my eyes, completely shattered, I handed my husband divorce papers.



When Dominic saw the death certificate attached to the agreement, he actually couldn't hold back a laugh:



""Sorry, I just had no idea someone could actually die from diarrhea.""



""I know you're upset, but don't worry. Dahlia's having the baby in three days.""



""She's such a thoughtful, grateful girl. We already worked it all out‚Äîonce her baby's born, we'll hand it over to you. All you need to do is keep being Mrs. Reid. Just one thing though‚ÄîDahlia needs to be able to visit the kid whenever she wants.""



""Don't bother,"" I replied with a bitter smile.



""Let's just divorce.""



...



When my attempts to get money from Dominic failed, I sold the ridiculously expensive engagement ring he'd once had custom-made‚Äîfor a fraction of its worth.



Rushing back to the hospital with what little cash I had, I heard the ominous beeping of machines echoing down the long corridor toward my son's room.



Then, in seconds, the world fell into a suffocating silence, as if someone had hit pause on reality itself.



""I'm so sorry, Mrs. Winters...""



""To be honest... If you'd been able to pay for the medication just a few days earlier, your child would have been fine.""



""Hospital policy is very clear‚Äîwe cannot provide medication when payment hasn't been processed. I'm truly sorry, Mrs. Winters. We truly did everything we could... Please accept our deepest condolences.""



I opened my mouth, but my throat felt like it was stuffed with razor blades wrapped in cotton‚Äîchoking and painful‚Äîmaking it impossible to form a single coherent sound.



Dragging my leaden legs to the bedside, I couldn't comprehend how to face my son's death.



Just this morning, he had managed to summon a smile and call me ""Mommy"" from that same hospital bed.



The TV mounted on the stark white wall flickered momentarily before regaining signal. Dominic's face appeared on screen.



There he was, smiling‚Äîthe man known for his cold public demeanor now standing warmly behind Dahlia, the college poor girl he ""sponsored,"" graciously greeting every gallery visitor with uncharacteristic charm.



Some bold attendee, completely unafraid of the cameras and social media livestreams, openly speculated about their relationship:



""With my years of experience reading people, I suspect there's more between Mr. Reid and our talented Miss Hayes than just a sponsorship arrangement.""



""Come on, tell us! Are wedding bells in your future?""



Hearing this, Dahlia blushed amid the teasing remarks, her eyes continuously seeking Dominic's, filled with unmistakable love and shy affection.



""But isn't Mr. Reid married? His son is five years old. Have they divorced quietly without announcing it?""



A brief, uncomfortable silence fell over the crowd. The person who asked quickly retreated into the crowd, suddenly fearful.



Dahlia's eyes instantly welled up with embarrassment on camera. She turned to Dominic hesitantly:



""Master, why didn't your wife come to the exhibition? Is she still upset about what happened at the auction? Perhaps I should visit her again and apologize properly.""



Without a moment's hesitation, Dominic rejected the idea.



""No need.""



""I've spoiled her into becoming too petty. Imagine making such a fuss over a mere set of jewelry‚Äîeven striking you over it. Since she's become so materialistic, I've decided not to give her another cent. I can't let that slap you received go unanswered.""



""Seeing her take out her frustrations on you infuriates me.""



His protective tone convinced everyone that our marriage was indeed falling apart, and somehow I had become the villain responsible for its demise.



""Mrs. Reid must be incredibly petty and calculating. Dealing with someone like that would drain anyone's soul. No wonder Mr. Reid found comfort elsewhere.""



""Let's set that aside for a moment‚Äîwhat about their child? If they really divorce and Mr. Reid continues with Miss Hayes, she'll eventually become a stepmother. Being a stepmother in a wealthy family is no easy role.""



Seeing these, my heart felt like it was being repeatedly dropped into boiling oil, sizzling and burning a thousand times over.



I couldn't distinguish whether my chest contained more grief or rage.



The hospital room's air conditioning was set painfully low. Countless cold drafts penetrated my body, making me shiver violently. I couldn't help but turn to the family beside the neighboring bed:



""Could you please turn up the temperature? My little boy has severe diarrhea and can't afford to get any colder.""



I don't know how much time passed, but that cold still burrowed into my heart. I looked up impatiently, only to meet the nurse's horrified expression.



""Mrs. Winters... family members aren't normally allowed to stay in the morgue for more than fifteen minutes. You've been here half the afternoon. Please, you need to leave now. The director is waiting for you to sign the death certificate.""



""And the child's father‚Äîhe's never once appeared. Now that the child is gone, surely he should show his face? Please contact him immediately.""



My mind suddenly exploded with clarity.



I finally returned to reality, stumbling to my feet as I made my way toward the door.



Chapter 2



The death certificate process moved quickly.



Within two hours, I stood near an air vent, my hands shaking as I called the funeral home.



Afterward, I called Dominic more than thirty times. Predictably, he never answered.



Leaning against the cold tile wall, I laughed bitterly at myself.



The funeral home staff collected my son's body before the hospital director finished his shift. Throughout the journey, I lost consciousness from crying countless times.



At the funeral home, they immediately placed my son in cold storage, then gently advised me that I could bring his favorite clothes for him to wear‚ÄîTo leave this world clean and neat.



Of course.



My son, just like Dominic, was always fastidious about cleanliness.



""Typically, cremation occurs within 72 hours of arrival at the funeral home. However, if family members request it, we can extend this period‚Äî3 days, 5 days, or 7 days. Do you have a preference?""



I reached out to touch my son's face, now devoid of warmth.



""3 days will be fine.""



...



I returned home in a daze well after midnight.



When Dominic saw me, the smile in his eyes instantly disappeared.



""Why are you back so late? Is Austin feeling better? Dahlia heard he's been having diarrhea and has been worried sick. She specifically asked me to bring home two boxes of medicine for him.""



I dodged the medicine he held out, noticing the date on the package. A cold smile crossed my face as tears streamed down uncontrollably.



""Expired medication? Who is she trying to kill?""



Dominic's expression froze. He turned the box to see the manufacturing date, then his face flashed with irritation.



""Dahlia simply didn't notice, that's all. Can't you speak without these constant jabs? You know pregnant women need to be super careful with medication. She probably had to travel all the way across town just to get those few pills. Besides, she's just a girl in her twenties‚Äîhow is she supposed to know all that stuff?""""



""And why didn't you attend Dahlia's art exhibition today? I told you days ago how important this event was, yet you deliberately chose to be difficult on this specific day?""



He instinctively criticized me to defend Dahlia. Somehow, he had become blind to my red, swollen eyes.



""Do you remember why you started sponsoring Dahlia in the first place?""



Dominic stiffened, swallowing whatever criticism he was about to deliver.



""You've forgotten, haven't you?""



""Do you recall when your relationship with her crossed the line?""



I looked at him calmly. ""Do you remember what you said to me after I discovered your one-night indiscretion?""



A heavy silence filled the living room. The faint scent of rock rose in the air pulled both Dominic and me back to the past.



Dahlia was a college student Dominic had brought back from a remote area during a business trip two years ago. At that time, she was bitter about her fate because her family wanted to marry her off to the village chief's son.



She cried about her difficult educational journey and accused her parents of favoritism. Her determined expression moved Dominic.



So, the billionaire CEO decided to sponsor her education, bringing her back and enrolling her in a prestigious university not far from our home.



He bought her an apartment, provided her with a luxury car, and even gave her a black card for spending money.



Gradually, Dominic grew closer to her and more distant from me. Even our son ceased to matter to him.



Finally, one night when he was working late, Dominic went to the wrong home.



When I discovered them, he knelt on the ground, repeatedly grabbing my hand to slap his own face.



""I'm sorry, Lyra. It's my fault. I drank too much at the business dinner. She was forced by me...""



""I promise it's just this once. I won't see her again after this, and once she graduates, I'll stop sponsoring her.""



Then, Dahlia became pregnant.



Thinking of this, a mocking smile twisted my lips.



""Dominic, can you explain something to me? You slept with her 'just once' a year ago, so why is she now eight months pregnant?""



""Has there been some new medical breakthrough suggesting that egg fertilization can be delayed by two to four months?""



""Enough!""



Faced with my questioning, Dominic's expression darkened.



""I'll explain everything later.""



""Where's Austin? Why didn't you bring him home? It's just diarrhea‚Äîdoes he really need to stay in the hospital this long?""



Hearing the name of my son, my heart felt like it was being pounded by a thousand hammers.



I pulled out the folded death certificate and divorce agreement from my bag, collapsing by the entrance, my face empty of all hope.



""Cremation in three days.""



""Find some time to see him with me, and let's finalize the divorce by the way.""



Chapter 3



Taking the certificate and agreement, Dominic's scrutinizing gaze fell on me.



Suddenly, he actually let out a laugh.



""What convenient timing.""



He released his grip, letting the papers fall at my feet.



""Sorry, I didn't realize diarrhea could be fatal.""



""I know you're upset, but it's fine. Dahlia is due to give birth in three days.""



""It was just a sponsorship situation. She's very sensible and grateful. We've already agreed that after the baby is born, we'll bring it to you to raise. You can continue being Mrs. Reid without worry. There's just one condition‚Äîyou need to allow Dahlia to visit the child regularly.""



I froze, turning my head to look at him in disbelief.



""Dominic! How can you say something like that? Are you some kind of monster?!""



Dominic shot me a glance, his eyes filled with anger and blame.



""Keep it down! Dahlia's taking a nap in the bedroom.""



I couldn't believe they had become this shameless.



SLAP!



My hand connected hard with Dominic's face. As his head snapped to the side from the impact, he coldly said:



""Feel better now?""



""Don't make jokes like that again. Who dies from diarrhea? Making such jokes around Austin‚Äîaren't you worried he'll pick up your bad habits?""



So he didn't believe the death certificate was real.



A wave of exhaustion washed over me. I picked up the divorce agreement, walked to the coffee table, and meticulously signed my name.



Tucking away the death certificate, I reminded Dominic, ""Don't forget to sign it.""



Dominic was about to say something when his peripheral vision caught something that instantly dispelled his frustration.



""You're awake?""



Dahlia emerged from the master bedroom, the straps of her silk nightgown hanging loosely from her shoulders, exposing a series of glaring red marks across her collarbone.



""Dominic, were you arguing with Lyra?""



She dramatically picked up the agreement, her almond eyes filled with distress.



""Lyra, you want to divorce Dominic?!""



""Why? Is it because of me?""



I looked at her with a derisive laugh. ""Yes, because you shamelessly got pregnant by another woman's husband, and because he's living a double life!""



Tears instantly welled in Dahlia's eyes as she awkwardly tried to cover the marks on her collarbone.



""I'm sorry, Lyra. I... I didn't realize opening the door that night would cause such a misunderstanding... I thought Dominic just came to talk about his troubles.""



I found it laughable.



What troubles would make a man abandon his wife on their wedding anniversary to confide in an outsider?



Dominic grabbed a jacket and thoughtfully draped it over Dahlia's shoulders, not forgetting to comfort her, ""Don't mind her. She lost her mind today.""



I didn't want to waste any more time with them. Ignoring the challenge in Dahlia's eyes, I went into the children's room to gather Austin's belongings.



When I came back out, only Dahlia remained in the living room. She crumpled the paper in her hand and threw it at my feet.



I immediately recognized it as my son's death certificate.



""Who gave you permission to go through my things?"" I glared at her coldly.



She exaggeratedly widened her mouth, her eyes gleaming with joy.



""Lyra, your son really did die from diarrhea? Huh, that's so absurd! Dominic was right‚Äîweak children are so difficult to raise.""



Shaking with rage, I didn't think twice before taking three quick strides toward her and slapping her hard across the face.



She let out a shrill scream and fell backward onto the floor.



The next moment, two vicious slaps landed on my face and head.



Dominic gathered Dahlia in his arms, his eyes filled with murderous intent as he looked at me.



""Lyra, you've gone too far!""



Dahlia weakly leaned against his chest, crying uncontrollably. ""I was just asking about Austin's condition, and Lyra just... I only suggested that she shouldn't raise children to be so fragile, or lie about her child. Dominic, did I say something wrong?""



Dominic shook his head.



""Lyra, which part of what Dahlia said was wrong? What have you become? This is the second time you've hit her. If it happens again, we're really getting divorced!""



With that, he carried the pale-faced Dahlia out the door.



Not wanting to engage with them any further, I deliberately waited 15 minutes before taking my packed luggage downstairs.



Dominic seems to have forgotten.



I'm a gentle person by nature. As long as my boundaries aren't crossed, I never make things difficult for others, let alone resort to violence.



That rare collection from the auction was actually my wedding gift‚Äîhe had traveled France six years ago specifically to have it custom-made for me by a renowned designer.



Not just Dominic, but everyone seems to have forgotten that the Reid and Winter families had always supported each other.



Unfortunately, after a plane crash, the Winter family gradually became an empty shell.



This jewelry set was what Dominic swore over my parents' graves to give me‚Äîpromising to love me as they did, to provide me with the best and most perfect of everything.



But six years later, he'd forgotten to pay the final installment for the set. When the deadline passed, the designer had no choice but to put it up for auction.



I only wanted to reclaim what was rightfully mine, but Dominic froze my cards, and because of that, Austin had no medicine...

I was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder about 2 years ago and was seeing a therapist. Due to some life transitions I had to find a new therapist. I had another therapist before this one which I also left when I felt I wasn't making progress. For this therapist I feel a lack of structure and little analysis. I explained these things to her and she said it was not a therapists job to analyze but rather to guide the patient to their own answers. While I agree I found myself just circling around the same points with no solution in sight. Kind of like I am in a dark room with just her vaguely giving me hints to where I can find the light. 

As for the lack of structure she says that my former therapist and I are doing the same thing me and her are doing. The problem is she can let me talk for 15 minutes maybe ask me a question (ex: do you think a is causing b) which can be easily answered with a yes or no. I expressed these concerns with her she offered to do more open ended questions but she didn't really want to do analysis. When I talk with her it feels more like a coffee chat than a therapy session.  I feel she isn't taking my symptoms of numbness/dullness seriously and my anxiety is getting worse (avoiding events/people that may cause anxiety etc etc). She also made the point that I might need a break from therapy to figure out what I need? But I clearly know what I need so I didn't understand that. And if my anxiety is getting bad in what world would stopping be a good idea? My gut is telling me to change therapists but what she has said is making me doubt myself.
