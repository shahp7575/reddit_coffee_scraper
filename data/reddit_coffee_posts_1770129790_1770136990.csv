1quww7m,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomentumOne/comments/1quww7m/how_to_reprogram_your_brain_for_success_the/,How to REPROGRAM Your Brain for Success: The Neuroscience That Actually Works,"honestly? most self-improvement advice is complete garbage. people tell you to ""think positive"" and ""manifest your dreams"" like you're some kind of spiritual vending machine. but after falling down a rabbit hole of neuroscience research, behavioral psychology books, and way too many podcasts at 2am, i realized something kinda fucked up: you CAN actually reprogram your brain. and it's not some woo-woo bullshit. it's just that nobody talks about the actual mechanisms.

your brain is basically running on outdated software from when we lived in caves. the negativity bias that kept your ancestors alive (by assuming every rustling bush = tiger) now just makes you assume every opportunity = potential embarrassment. that voice telling you you're gonna fail? it's not wisdom. it's just your amygdala being a dramatic little bitch.

here's what actually works, backed by science you can verify:

**exploit your brain's pattern recognition obsession**

your brain LOVES patterns. it's constantly looking for them, predicting outcomes based on past experiences. this is why you keep repeating the same behaviors, good or bad. the hack? deliberately feed it new patterns until the old ones get overwritten.

start ridiculously small. like embarrassingly small. wanna exercise daily? do ONE pushup. your brain doesn't distinguish between ""i did one pushup"" and ""i exercised."" it just registers: pattern completed. do this for two weeks straight and your brain literally starts expecting it. the neural pathway gets reinforced every single time.

this ties into implementation intentions, something researched extensively by psychologist Peter Gollwitzer. basically instead of ""i'll work out more,"" you need ""when i finish my morning coffee, i will do one pushup in the kitchen."" the specificity creates a mental script your brain can follow automatically.

**Atomic Habits by James Clear** breaks this down perfectly (bestselling book, over 15 million copies sold, Clear spent years researching behavioral change). this book genuinely changed how i approach literally everything. he explains how your environment shapes behavior more than willpower ever could, which is why you keep ""failing"" at the same goals. not your fault, wrong strategy. the 1% improvement framework sounds basic but it's stupidly effective once you actually implement it. best habit building book that exists.

**use cognitive dissonance as a weapon**

here's something wild: your brain HATES inconsistency. when your actions don't match your self-image, you experience psychological discomfort (cognitive dissonance). most people try to resolve this by changing their self-image downward. ""guess i'm just lazy."" but you can flip this.

start calling yourself the thing you want to become, then your brain will literally pressure you to act accordingly. not in a delusional way, but strategic. you tell yourself ""i'm someone who shows up"" then your brain gets uncomfortable when you skip. the dissonance becomes your accountability.

pair this with the concept of identity-based habits (also from [Atomic Habits](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits). instead of ""i want to run a marathon"" (outcome), shift to ""i'm a runner"" (identity). every time you run, even five minutes, you cast a vote for that identity. your brain keeps score.

**the app Ash** (mental health and relationship coaching tool) actually uses this principle in their CBT exercises. it helps you identify thought patterns and reframe them in real time, which is basically manual brain reprogramming. way more practical than traditional therapy for some people.

**leverage neuroplasticity through discomfort**

neuroplasticity is your brain's ability to rewire itself. but here's the catch: it only happens when you're in mild stress/discomfort. your comfort zone is neurologically a dead zone. nothing changes there.

Dr. Andrew Huberman (Stanford neuroscientist, huge podcast following) explains this constantly on his podcast. when you do something difficult, especially early in the day, you trigger dopamine release AND strengthen the neural circuits associated with that behavior. you're literally building new highways in your brain.

the protocol: do the hardest/most dreaded task within 90 minutes of waking. your dopamine and cortisol are naturally elevated then. you'll build way more frustration tolerance and the neural pathways strengthen faster.

[Huberman Lab podcast](https://www.hubermanlab.com/) is insanely good for this stuff, he translates dense neuroscience into actual protocols you can use. episodes on dopamine, motivation, and neuroplasticity are genuinely life changing if you implement even 20% of what he suggests.

**interrupt the doom spiral IMMEDIATELY**

your brain has a default mode network that activates during idle time. for a lot of us, this defaults to rumination and anxiety. the solution isn't to ""stop thinking negative thoughts"" (impossible). it's to aggressively redirect attention the SECOND you notice it happening.

have a pre-planned intervention. mine is literally saying ""nope"" out loud and doing 10 jumping jacks or switching tasks entirely. sounds stupid but it works because you're physically interrupting the neural loop before it gains momentum.

**The Power of Now by Eckhart Tolle** (spiritual bestseller, recommended by Oprah, sold millions worldwide) explores this concept of watching your thoughts without identifying with them. tolle had a complete mental breakdown then discovered this practice that basically saved his life. the book is a bit repetitive but the core insight about separating yourself from your thought patterns is genuinely profound. you are not your thoughts, you're the awareness behind them.

**create forcing functions**

your future self is an unreliable narrator. you THINK you'll have discipline tomorrow. you won't. so remove the decision entirely.

delete social media apps (not accounts, just apps). put your phone in another room at night. sign up and pay for classes in advance. tell people your goals publicly so shame becomes a motivator (yeah it's not ideal but it works).

[BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450) is an AI-powered learning app built by Columbia alumni and former Google engineers that pulls from books, research papers, and expert interviews to create personalized audio content and adaptive learning plans based on whatever you're trying to improve. Type in your goal, like ""build better habits"" or ""understand behavioral psychology,"" and it generates custom podcasts ranging from quick 15-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with examples and context. You can also choose different voice styles, pause mid-episode to ask questions to the virtual coach Freedia, or let it auto-generate flashcards from your key takeaways. Covers all the books mentioned here plus way more, and the learning plan adapts as you progress.

**Insight Timer** (meditation app with thousands of free guided meditations) has been clutch for building a meditation practice that actually sticks. you can set daily reminders and they have super short 3-5 minute sessions, so there's no excuse. meditation is basically the gym for your attention span, and attention control is everything.

the actual ""brainwashing"" part is just consistent repetition of new patterns until your baseline changes. your brain doesn't distinguish between thoughts you intentionally chose and thoughts that just showed up. so be intentional. feed it better inputs. protect your attention like your life depends on it, because your quality of life literally does.

the uncomfortable truth is that you already ARE brainwashed, just by whatever random combination of experiences, people, and media you've been exposed to. might as well take control of the process and point it somewhere useful.",1,1770136829.0,MomentumOne,0,1.0,False

Sometimes those choices come from family expectations or social ideas of success, even when they don’t feel like a true fit.

When that happens, the disconnect often shows up in specific, repeated ways.

**Work feels heavy or filled with dread.** When most of the week is spent dreading work or feeling heavy just thinking about the day ahead, that reaction says something important. Spending around 40 hours a week on something that creates regular dread can point to a life that doesn’t reflect what actually feels meaningful.

**The body feels sluggish or passionless.** Feelings like heaviness, sluggishness, dullness, lifelessness, or passiveness can appear when life isn’t aligned with what feels right. Energy may come from external pushes like coffee or caffeinated teas just to keep going.

**Fear of letting others down shapes decisions.** Staying in a life that doesn’t fit often connects to worrying about disappointing the people you love. Choices that feel internally unrewarding can stay in place because of concern about how others might be affected or whether they would support those choices.

**Success has never been clearly defined personally.** Success may be shaped by family or society rather than by how you want to feel, who you want to be, or how you want to live. Without that personal definition, it’s harder to know whether the life you’re living actually fits.

**There’s a quiet sense that life is meant to include more.** Even when gratitude for what exists is present, there can still be a feeling that more experiences, growth, or fulfillment are meant to be part of life. That awareness can exist alongside appreciation rather than canceling it out.

How do these signs show up when someone is living someone else’s dream rather than their own, and which of them feels most recognizable?

\*\*

EoE is now in full cellular level remission because I didn’t have soy, wheat, dairy, seeds/sesame, egg, nuts (—- note, I did have 2 bars in the 2 months that had almonds and cashews, but I didn’t realize at the time). 

I was so strict! 

I was so miserable! 

Doc says because I responded fully by food elimination and PPI, I’m not a candidate for any other medicines. That I’ll need to follow diet limitations indefinitely if I want EOE to stay in remission. 

He seems surprised by my sadness and didn’t understand that restricting food groups is unpleasant.

He asked me what I was saddest about not having - and I said BEER and being able to order at a restaurant without stress of if the restaurant will mess up. 

He said that I CAN have beer because it’s not an allergen when it is a byproduct of wheat.

And now we will introduce other foods and do repeat scope to see if I am not allergic to some of the 6FED. So, I am trying egg and soy, since they are common food additives. 

He said that since I actually don’t normally eat nuts, shellfish, seeds in general adding those in with adding back soy and eggs is ok.  I only have soy and eggs and almonds in small amounts anyway, like baked into things or coffee creamer.

I feel distrust.  

This seems like he is hedging bets it’s wheat and dairy only.  

Do you guys think this is wise plan? 

And- have y’all heard about beer as not a thing wheat triggered people can have?  

(\*\* the man idea of post is about food restrictions but I want to offer aside about the medications too — for the full picture. 

I also have done Protonix 2x day and Pepcid AC.  So a lot of PPI, but I wasn’t able to take the PPIs as directed with 30-90 prior to any food.  So the drugs weren’t totally able to work.  But, with other meds I need plus my actual life, I need to eat food in first half hour of waking to function and digest other meds that hurt my stomach when it’s empty but need to be taken soon in the AM. )

Now, I take the filter out after the rinse, and I reseat it so the ridges of my v60 are the only contact points with the filter. I’m fairly certain that this has improved the flow rate of water passing through the coffee bed, which has allowed me to grind my beans a bit finer than I had been.

So a bit of backstory is needed, but this is regarding a situation regarding my child and how my 'friend' thinks they should rank above them. Spoiler alert: They dont. 

There are a few recurring people, who we will call, Damon (my partner and my childs father), Charity (One of my best friends), Sasha (another of my best friends), Karen (The nightmare) and my child Indigo.

Early 2024, i started doing a bunch of local free courses, to try and get out more after a serious battle with my mental health, and learn some new crafting skills etc. It was during one of these courses that i met Karen. at the time she seemed lovely and we became friends, seeing each other fairly regularly at the courses we both attended. 

Mid 2024 i became pregnant and was excited beyond belief to tell people, one of which was Karen as i genuinely thought we were pretty close. Unfortunately 8 weeks into this, i suffered a miscarriage and lost my child. I wont go into details, but the whole situation was incredibly traumatic given how it all went down.  Damon and I were heartbroke but neither of us wanted to wait around to try again. During this time Charity took me to a couple of appointments i needed to attend that Damon couldnt, Sasha was there for me the whole time, and Karen was actually really sweet, creating a memorial for my little one using the skills we had learned in the courses we attended. I still have it as it was incredibly thoughtful.

  
A month later, guess whos pregnant again? If you guess me you get a cookie and a gold star. This time, we waited longer to tell people, and as you can imagine i was /terrified/ of losing this one too. Eventually we started telling people, and immediately Sasha and Charity wanted to plan a baby shower for me. When i told Karen, she asked if she could help. We'd been friends about 6 months at this point so i said sure, and we created a group chat to discuss all the details.

  
This is where shit hits the fan a bit. I don't really know what happened in her head but something changed. My friends were helping me, but i still wanted input in my baby shower as my aesthetic is important to me (I'm Pagan and Goth). We weren't finding out the gender until LO was born, so we had a wide range of choices for everything. So i wanted witchy vibes, but immediately Karen comes in trying to /tell/ me i was having a pastel theme, and shed been searching and finding everything in sage green. Its a nice colour, but its not me at all. We finally settled on a palette that was more me and moved on.

 During the planning process Karen was an utter nightmare. And i mean a nightmare. I have the receipts for all of this by the way, cause i know this sounds utterly batshit insane. But here are some highlights of the planning:

\- Complained in the baby shower group chat that i shared pregnancy updates with them... In the group chat about the damn baby...

\- Tried to control the food so it was /all/ suitable for her. She wanted halal food despite being the only person who needs it, when i was already trying to cater to the 3 Vegans, 4 Vegetarians, and Damon who is Keto and Gluten-Intollerant. Most of the food was suitable for her, everything that wasnt meat was totally suitable for her by design, and we couldnt get Halal from where we were doing the shopping for the food. But we absolutely made sure she could eat. I even said if she wanted Halal meat thats fine but she would need to provide it for herself and we would keep it safe in the kitchen for her, just like we were doing with Damons food.

\- Turned around and made out that her religion is the only real religion, telling me that my gods are just spirits and not really real. 

\- 2 months out from the babyshower i wanted to get together and actually start ordering decorations, and sort out the shopping list and plan for the shower set up itself. She messaged Charity telling her i was getting stressed and didnt understand why i was panicking... when we hadnt done anything to get ready yet. Don't worry Charity had my back. Shes a real one guys.

\- Everytime we tried to make plans so everyone could attend, she would try and push Sasha out of the loop. We didnt let that happen.

\- Barely helped with prep before the shower, and showed up late to every meeting we had. Im heavily pregnant by this point and exhausted so i just wanted to get things done but had to wait hours for her to show up. Whenever she did show up, it was me Charity and Sasha who did the work really. 

\- When planning the food, everyone was willing to split the costs (which i appreciate beyond belief), Charity and Sasha both picked up various items to add to their costs on top of the basic buffet being split between the 4 of us. Karen didnt pick up anything and left it all to us. I know im not entitled to anyones money, and absolute appreciate the girls helping where they could, but she did leave it all to us 3 after begging to be involved.

\- I asked Charity for some specialty food that she introduced me too, so she decided to get it for me as a babyshower gift. Due to Damon being gluten intollerant, he couldnt eat it so i asked if she would put his share of said items aside for me to take home. Karen immediately decides shes doing the same, and also helping herself to the buffet before the guests even arrived. We shut that shit down immediately, the food was for all the guests, the only reason i was getting extra was because my partner couldnt eat it, they're my favourite, and they were a gift for me.

\- Spent the entire pregnancy trying to get me to tell her our childs name, even though she knew we were keeping it to ourselves. No one knew the name till they were born

  


The whole planning process was utter chaos. During this time as well, im going through various issues with the pregnancy, my dads incredibly poorly, and we're also having to put so much effort into getting the house ready and prepped for a child its just insane. Things were hell for me on the leadup to the baby shower. At this point ive known Karen about a year, and for the most part shes done nothing but cause issues.

Day before the shower comes, Karen was supposed to help myself and Charity get the buffet made and over to the venue. She didnt show up. Sasha and her partner come after work to pick up the decorations from Charity's house and im sent home, very heavily pregnant by this point. They know my vision for the venue, but im told im not allowed to see it till the shower tomorrow. Honestly these girls... I dont know what id do without them.

The next day comes, Sasha, Charity and their partners all go to the venue to finish putting up the decorations before the guests and I arrive. Guess who didnt show up to help... again? If you guess Karen you earned a second cookie! She actually showed up /after/ i arrived. The shower thankfully went off without a problem until the very end. I thanked all 3 of them for their help, even though id been so miffed by Karens attitude the whole time, and gave them all a small gift to say thankyou for their help. Yes i know a little people pleasing given that Charity and Sasha work theit asses off. 

One of the specialty items id asked for was something Charity cooked herself, and knew i wanted some to take home. Yeah... Karen took the /lot/ were talking like 6 bowls leaving me with none to take home. I brushed it off as Charity had made sure i had basically every left over of the other stuff so i could survive. 

Fast forward a couple of weeks, and i get some horrendous news. My dad? Cancer. Very agressive. All over his body. Basically just a waiting game. 

And then i give birth. Im close with my dad, so hes the first person to find out his grandchild is here, and then a week after was the first to hold Indigo other than me, Damon, and hospital staff. It was so important to me that they had that given we knew we didnt have long with him.

Charity and Sasha were so helpful during this time, Charity actually cleaned the house and looked after our cats whilst i was in hospital, and they were both there for me no matter the time, along with Damon of course. So i'm a new mum, with a breastfed newborn, exhausted and sleep deprived and trying to adjust to the new reality.

And then my dad dies. Indigo was 8 weeks old. Honestly im still not ok. I miss him everyday but im so happy he got to meet his grandchild. Part of me is convinced he held on to meet them and then let himself just... let go. Indigos middle name is named after him as well, so im so glad that he got to know just how much i love him. 

Once again, Charity and Sasha were my rocks, they checked on em regularly, and were over to help me with housework etc as often as they could be, and Damon was my absolute rock. Karen? Nowhere to be seen, except when asking to see Indigo. I'd been saying she could come and visit for a while but i was still in recovery, but no i had to schlep us both over to hers so she could see Indigo.

This wouldnt have been such a problem if she hadnt been so... weird... like... peering over the coffee tabel to watch as i changed Indigos nappy weird... along with saying 'is mummy starving you? its ok ill sneak you some food' when Indigo was only 3 months old and exclusively breastfed... it made me super uncomfortable, especailly when she took him into another room to see her mum. 

After this I started  to distance myself from her, i was exhausted and fed up of the constant drama, i did try to invite her out that week but she never responded and honestly taking care of Indigo and making sure my mental health didnt plummet was my main concern. I was barely speaking to anyone at this time, between navigating the newborn period, learning to be a mother, and grieving the loss of my dad, i went radiosilent for a bit, but Charity and Sasha understood and let me know they were there when i was ready and they loved me.

  
So for the last 5/6 months none of us have heard from Karen and things are blissfully peaceful. Until Yesterday when i recieved this text. It's a direct copy paste, but if people want the screen shot i'll happily provide it. Obviously names have been changed.



  
This message is not an invitation to respond.

I remained present and supportive while your life revolved around your pregnancy and your needs. Even when there was someone close to you who had plenty to say about you, I still showed up and helped you without hesitation. And now that Indigo is here, NOTHING else matters, or mattered. 

You then chose to cut me off without explanation or basic respect. That decision made one thing clear: you failed as a friend.

The world does not revolve around you. I will not accept being treated as disposable once I am no longer useful.

Your behaviour caused real damage. That is a consequence of how you chose to handle someone who was genuinely there for you.

I suggest you reflect seriously on how you treat people and ensure you do not repeat this pattern.

This contact ends here. I am permanently removing you from my life.

Good luck. Hopefully this sits with you for a while and makes you feel as confused and as upset about this as I have.





I'm baffled that she seems to think that she should rank above my child in my life... and of course /MY/ life revolves around /ME/ thats just how things work, and while i appreciate friends and family helping me, i never once expected anyone to center me in their lives. 

She also clearly is trying to put a wedge between me and Charity, by saying that someone had a lot to say about me, however i already know. Charity Sasha and i are all on the spectrums o were blunt as shit with each other. Its the easiest way for us to communicate, we literally call each other names and take the piss out of eachother constantly, its how we roll, so... nice try but its not going to work.

But her saying nothing matters other than Indigo? Obviously thats the case. Theyre 10 months old, and rely on me to take care of them, but i have been present witht the people who understand that my priorities have changed. 

Ive only known her about 2 years, whereas Charity and Sasha ive known a lot longer, we've all earned loyalty and love and understanding from each other by being there as much as is possible and understanding that sometimes life is stressful so we might not always be present, but it doesnt mean we love each other any less. Karen seems to feel entitled to that kind of friendship, without giving it in return.

  
So AITAh for putting the needs of my 10 month old, above the needs of someone ive known around 2 years?

It’s definitely not a ""get rich quick"" thing, but if you’re a student or just have some downtime while multitasking, it’s one of the only sites that **actually pays out instantly**.

**Why I like it:**

* **Minimum payout is tiny:** You can withdraw at just **$0.50**. Most sites make you wait until $10 or $20.
* **No disqualifications:** Unlike surveys, if you solve it, you get paid. Period.
* **Easy to do while multitasking:** I usually keep the window open while I’m watching lectures or YouTube and just solve a few here and there. It adds up.
* **Multiple payout options:** You can get paid in Bitcoin, USDT, or even AirTM (which is what I use).

There is a lot of fearmongering about sucralose & aspartame and their effects, like increased appetite/insulin spikes (which apparently the latter may be miconstrued by bad studies).

I've found, that genuinely, if you're prone to being a sweet tooth, a little bit of sweetness keeps you happy and motivated, and you don't trickle up your calorie count with drinks, there is more benefit than harm.

Obviously, nothing will top drinking water or black coffee. But to me, adding a Splenda into your coffee isn't going to hurt your diet, as long as you stay committed and persistent.

I admit, I was an obsessive soda drinker for years. Now? I switched to Sparkling Ice. I may drink a single Coke Zero or Diet Coke every couple days with my meal. I really don't notice the supposed appetite increase people talk about with them. If you can control it, you control it.

Just from my experience, obviously everyone will have their own experiences and it may vary. But artificial sweeteners have helped me a lot!

Most relationship advice is absolute garbage. Everyone's out here saying ""communicate better"" and ""date your wife"" like that's some groundbreaking revelation. But nobody tells you *how* to actually do that, or why most marriages slowly drift into roommate territory where you're just two people splitting bills and occasionally having mediocre sex.

I spent months diving into relationship psychology, studied attachment theory, read research from the Gottman Institute (they've studied 40,000+ couples over decades), listened to Esther Perel's podcasts, absorbed Terry Real's work on relational life therapy. What I found was pretty confronting. The data shows most men unconsciously recreate their father's relationship patterns, good or bad. And society doesn't exactly teach us emotional intelligence or partnership skills. We're supposed to just figure it out somehow.

But here's the good news. Becoming an exceptional partner isn't about being perfect or losing yourself. It's about specific, learnable skills that compound over time.

**Stop treating emotional labor like it's optional**

Most guys genuinely don't realize how much invisible work their partner does. Remembering birthdays, planning social events, managing household systems, tracking when the dog needs shots, coordinating with family. This cognitive load is exhausting. Start actually noticing what needs doing before being asked. Dr. John Gottman calls this ""turning toward"" your partner's needs. Keep a shared note on your phone of recurring tasks and own half of them completely. Not ""helping"" with her responsibilities. Actually owning them.

**The vulnerability thing everyone gets wrong**

Real vulnerability isn't trauma dumping or constant neediness. It's sharing your actual internal experience in real time. ""I'm feeling defensive right now and I'm not sure why"" or ""I'm scared about the promotion because I might fail."" Brené Brown's research shows vulnerability builds intimacy, but only when it's authentic and reciprocal. Read her book *Daring Greatly*. This book fundamentally changed how I understood connection. Brown spent years researching shame and worthiness, and her insights on how men specifically struggle with vulnerability are uncomfortably accurate. She breaks down why we've been conditioned to view emotional openness as weakness and provides an actual framework for unlearning that. Insanely good read.

**Master the art of actually listening**

Most of us wait for our turn to talk or immediately jump to problem solving. Your partner usually doesn't want solutions, they want to feel heard. Try this: when she's sharing something, focus entirely on understanding her emotional experience. Reflect back what you heard before responding. ""So you're feeling overwhelmed because your boss keeps changing requirements, and that's making you question your competence?"" This validation is worth more than ten solutions. Terry Real's book [*Us: Getting Past You and Me to Build a More Loving Relationship*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58502657-us) is legitimately the best relationship book I've ever encountered. Real is a therapist who works with couples on the brink of divorce, and he doesn't sugarcoat anything. He explains how most of us unconsciously operate from either grandiosity or shame, and how that dynamic poisons partnerships. The exercises for moving into what he calls ""the wise adult"" mindset are genuinely transformative.

**Understand your attachment style and work on it**

Attachment theory explains why you react certain ways in relationships. Anxious attachment makes you clingy and reassurance seeking. Avoidant attachment makes you withdraw when things get intense. Most relationship patterns trace back to childhood stuff we never processed. The app [Paired](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/paired-couples-relationship/id1469609343) is actually solid for this, it has daily questions and exercises specifically designed to increase emotional intimacy and awareness. Takes like 10 minutes but the conversations it sparks are worth it.

If you want a more structured approach to all this, there's also [**BeFreed**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450), a personalized learning app built by Columbia alumni. It pulls from relationship psychology books, research papers, and expert insights like the Gottman work and Esther Perel's content to create custom audio learning plans. You can tell it something specific like ""become a better listener in my marriage"" or ""understand my avoidant attachment style,"" and it generates a structured plan pulling from the best sources. You can adjust the depth from quick 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives with examples. The voice options are addictive too, smoky and engaging voices that make commute learning actually enjoyable. It's helped me connect dots between different relationship frameworks I was learning separately.

**Fight properly**

Conflict is inevitable. What matters is how you do it. Gottman's research identified ""the four horsemen"" that predict divorce: criticism, contempt, defensiveness, stonewalling. When you catch yourself doing these, pause. Replace criticism with specific complaints. ""I felt hurt when plans changed without discussion"" instead of ""You never consider my schedule."" Never show contempt, that's relationship poison. When you're flooded emotionally, take a 20 minute break minimum before continuing.

The goal isn't winning arguments, it's understanding each other better and finding solutions that work for both people. Reframe it as ""us versus the problem"" not ""me versus you.""

**Maintain your own identity**

Codependency isn't romantic, it's suffocating. Keep your friendships, hobbies, goals. Be someone interesting who's growing. Your partner fell for a whole person with passions and opinions, not someone who disappears into the relationship. This paradoxically makes you more attractive and the relationship healthier. Esther Perel's podcast *Where Should We Begin* features real couples therapy sessions (anonymized). Hearing how other couples navigate desire, betrayal, monotony, and growth is incredibly normalizing and educational.

**The small consistent things matter more than grand gestures**

Gottman talks about building your ""emotional bank account"" through tiny daily interactions. Make coffee. Send a midday text. Actually look up from your phone when they're talking. Remember details about their life and follow up on them. These micro moments of connection compound into deep security and trust. One thoughtful gesture weekly beats expensive surprises quarterly.

**Get comfortable with repair**

You will mess up. You'll be insensitive, forget something important, say something hurtful. What matters is repairing quickly and genuinely. Proper apologies include: acknowledging specifically what you did wrong, taking responsibility without defensiveness, expressing understanding of impact, and committing to doing better. ""I'm sorry you feel that way"" is not an apology.

**Prioritize her pleasure and satisfaction**

This applies to sex but also just life generally. Does she feel fulfilled? Supported in her goals? Celebrated for who she is? Regularly check in on whether she feels seen and valued. Ask what would make her life better or easier. Then actually do those things. Partnership means both people thrive, not just coexist.

**Work on yourself continuously**

Therapy isn't just for crisis moments. Individual therapy helps you understand your patterns, process childhood stuff, and become more emotionally regulated. Better Help or Alma can connect you with therapists who specialize in men's issues or relationship dynamics. Being a great partner requires doing your own internal work so you're not projecting unresolved stuff onto your relationship.

1quwbyt,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialBlueprint/comments/1quwbyt/the_psychology_of_flirting_that_actually_works_no/,The Psychology of Flirting That Actually Works (No Cringe Tactics),"You know what's wild? Most advice about flirting is garbage. It's either cringe pickup artist nonsense or watered down ""just be yourself"" platitudes that don't actually help. After diving deep into psychology research, human behavior studies, and talking to actual relationship experts, I realized something: flirting isn't magic. It's psychology. And the best part? Once you understand how it works, it becomes way less terrifying.



Look, I get it. Flirting feels like walking a tightrope while blindfolded. Say the wrong thing and you're creepy. Say nothing and you're boring. But here's the truth: most guys fail at flirting not because they lack charisma, but because they don't understand the psychological principles behind attraction. Let's fix that.



 Step 1: Master the Power of Presence (Not Performance)



Stop trying to impress. Seriously. The biggest mistake guys make is treating flirting like a performance where they need to prove their worth. Women can smell that desperation from a mile away.



Here's what works: Be present in the moment. Make eye contact that lingers just a second longer than normal. Not creepy staring, but genuine interest. Research from the Journal of Research in Personality shows that sustained eye contact triggers feelings of connection and even arousal. It activates the same neural pathways as physical touch.



When you're talking to her, put your phone away. Face her directly. Show through your body language that nothing else matters right now. This creates what psychologists call ""attentional synchrony,"" basically making her feel like she's the only person in the room.



 Step 2: Use Strategic Vulnerability (The Confidence Paradox)



You've probably heard ""confidence is key"" about a million times. But confidence without vulnerability is just arrogance, and nobody finds that attractive.



The trick: Share something slightly imperfect or self deprecating early on. Not major insecurities, but small human moments. ""I'm terrible at keeping plants alive"" or ""I definitely got lost three times getting here."" This is called the Pratfall Effect, discovered by psychologist Elliot Aronson. People actually find you MORE attractive when you show minor flaws because it makes you relatable and human.



Brené Brown's research on vulnerability (check out her book [Daring Greatly](https://www.amazon.in/DARING-GREATLY-Bren%C3%A9-Brown/dp/1592408419), a NYT bestseller and absolute game changer for understanding human connection) proves that vulnerability creates intimacy. This woman has studied shame and vulnerability for decades at the University of Houston, and her work will completely shift how you think about authentic connection. It's not about trauma dumping, it's about showing you're real.



 Step 3: Master the Push-Pull Dynamic



This is where things get interesting. Human psychology is wired to want what we can't fully have. It's called the scarcity principle, and it's backed by decades of research.



How to use it: Give genuine compliments, but follow them with playful teasing. ""You have great taste in music. Except for that one song you mentioned. That was questionable."" You're creating a pattern of validation followed by light challenge. This keeps her brain engaged because you're not predictable.



The key word here is LIGHT. You're not negging her or being mean. You're creating playful tension. Think of it like a dance, you step forward, then back, creating rhythm and anticipation.



Robert Cialdini breaks this down perfectly in Influence: [The Psychology of Persuasion](https://ia800203.us.archive.org/33/items/ThePsychologyOfPersuasion/The%20Psychology%20of%20Persuasion.pdf) (this dude is literally THE authority on persuasion science, with over 5 million copies sold). The book explains why intermittent reinforcement (mixed signals, basically) creates stronger engagement than constant validation. This is insanely good read if you want to understand human behavior on a deeper level.



 Step 4: Create Emotional Spikes (Not Just Small Talk)



Small talk is where attraction goes to die. ""What do you do? Where are you from?"" Boring. Safe. Forgettable.



Instead: Ask questions that create emotional responses. ""What's something you're weirdly competitive about?"" or ""What's the most spontaneous thing you've done recently?"" These questions force her brain to access memories tied to emotions, which creates a much stronger connection.



Psychologist Arthur Aron's research on interpersonal closeness (the famous 36 questions study) shows that asking progressively deeper questions rapidly accelerates intimacy. You don't need all 36 questions, but the principle works. Go beyond surface level quickly.



Also, share stories that paint pictures, not resumes. Don't tell her your job title, tell her about that weird customer interaction you had. Stories trigger empathy and make you memorable.



If you want to go deeper on attraction psychology without reading entire textbooks, [BeFreed ](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/learn-anything-befreed/id6739747450)is worth checking out. It's a personalized learning app built by Columbia alumni and AI experts from Google that turns insights from relationship psychology books, dating experts, and behavioral research into custom audio episodes. 



You can type in something like 'I'm an introvert who wants to learn practical strategies to become more magnetic in social situations' and it pulls from high-quality sources (think books like Attached, research on body language, expert interviews) to create a learning plan just for you. You control the depth, from quick 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives with real examples. The voice options are surprisingly addictive too, there's even a smoky, conversational style that makes complex psychology way easier to absorb during your commute or gym time.



 Step 5: Use Strategic Touch (The Touch Barrier)



Touch is powerful, but most guys either avoid it completely or get way too handsy. Both kill attraction.



The science: Research from DePauw University shows that light, appropriate touch increases compliance and liking. We're talking about brief, non threatening contact like touching her arm when making a point or a light hand on her back when guiding her through a crowd.



Start with neutral touch zones (arm, shoulder) and gauge her response. If she pulls away, you back off immediately. If she touches you back or leans in, that's a green light. This is about reading signals, not pushing boundaries.



 Step 6: Create Shared Secrets (The Conspiracy Effect)



This is sneaky but effective. Create small moments that feel like inside jokes or shared secrets, even if they're meaningless.



Example: You're at a coffee shop and the barista messes up someone's order. Lean in and whisper, ""I bet that guy asked for extra foam."" Now you've created a tiny shared moment that feels exclusive.



This works because of what psychologists call ""in group favoritism."" When you create a ""us vs them"" dynamic (even in trivial situations), it bonds people together. You're not actually excluding anyone, you're just creating a shared perspective that makes her feel connected to you.



 Step 7: Exit on a High Note (Scarcity Principle)



Most guys blow it at the end. They're having a good conversation and then... they linger too long. The energy fades. It gets awkward.



The move: Leave when things are going WELL, not when the conversation dies. ""This has been fun, but I've gotta run. We should continue this over coffee sometime.""



This does two things: it shows you have a life (you're not desperate), and it leaves her wanting more. The Zeigarnik Effect (discovered by psychologist Bluma Zeigarnik) shows that people remember incomplete interactions better than completed ones. By ending on a high note, you stay in her mind.



 Step 8: Authentic Interest Beats Clever Lines



Here's something that might piss you off: all these techniques don't mean shit if you're not genuinely interested in her as a person.



The real trick: Actually listen. Not ""waiting for your turn to talk"" listening, but genuine curiosity. Ask follow up questions about things she mentions. Notice details. Remember what she says.



Daniel Goleman's [Emotional Intelligence](https://donainfo.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/emotional-intelligence-daniel-goleman.pdf) (this book is basically required reading if you want to understand human interaction, it's been on bestseller lists for years) breaks down how empathy and social awareness matter more than IQ in relationships. The guy spent decades researching this at Rutgers, and his work proves that technical tricks don't work without genuine connection.



If you're using these techniques to manipulate someone into liking you when you don't actually care about them, it's not going to work long term. And honestly, that's just being a dick.



 The Truth About Flirting



Look, flirting isn't about memorizing scripts or becoming someone you're not. It's about understanding the psychological principles that create attraction and using them authentically. These aren't manipulation tactics, they're communication tools.



The women you want to attract aren't looking for perfection. They're looking for someone who makes them feel seen, engaged, and excited. Someone who's confident enough to be vulnerable and present enough to actually connect.



So stop overthinking every word. Stop treating flirting like a test you can fail. Start seeing it as a conversation where you're both trying to figure out if there's chemistry. Sometimes there is, sometimes there isn't. That's not rejection, that's just reality.



Now get out there and actually apply this stuff. Because reading about it doesn't do anything. Action does.

Wanted to just say ""add chicken thighs and rice to my cart"" and have it happen.

So I built an MCP server that connects Claude to HEB.

Now I can:

\- ""Search for organic eggs"" → shows products with actual prices at my store

\- ""What's in that salsa?"" → pulls ingredients, nutrition, allergens

\- ""Add it to my cart"" → adds with confirmation so Claude doesn't go rogue

\- ""Any coupons for coffee?"" → finds and clips them

The annoying part was HEB's bot detection killing sessions every 11 minutes. Solved it with auto-refresh - takes about 15 seconds and handles login automatically if you save credentials.

1quw754,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1quw754/facing_immense_anxiety_from_academic_stress_need/,"Facing immense anxiety from academic stress, need help!","I (23f) have been under immense anxiety the last few months, and I can visibly see it affecting my physical health. For example, I am suffering from physical symptoms of anxiety, such as anxiety attacks, visibly shaking, throwing up from stress, heart palpitations, hair loss, weight gain, difficulties losing weight, and fatigue. I am going to therapy, and I’m thinking about asking to start anti-anxiety medication. Still, in the meantime, I wanted to know if anyone could provide me with advice on how to settle my anxiety with other methods. 

I am a first-year PhD student in the humanities field at an R1 school in the United States. My current workload includes taking preliminary graduate classes in my field and serving as a teaching assistant for a mega class (teaching discussion sections and grading work for about 70 students). The workload itself is not stressful for me, infact it is often my only venue of peace. I enjoy reading, writing, and teaching. 

I have noticed a bulk of my anxiety comes from my interactions with my colleagues, friendships, and a feeling of inadequacy (like I’m not doing enough). I have made a previous post about this, but there are a few very mean PhD students (PhD candidates) in my department who absolutely dominate class discussion and make the educational environment hostile. Unfortunetly this semester, they are in every single one of my classes (where they were only in one of my classes last semester). For this reason, I feel as though I dissociate in classes because I can’t participate, or because they often go on tangents that make it hard to actually focus. For this reason, I get anxious actually going to class itself (but not doing the classwork). One such classmate has also been sexually harassing some of us women in the department, and we have resorted to locking ourselves in our offices when we are at the department.

I also feel so isolated, and I am clinging on hard to my only two friends (who are both my roommates and cohort). However, because I recognize these are the only friendships I have at this moment, I’ve become scared of upsetting them, so I often walk on eggshells around them, fearful of anything I may do wrong to jeopardize this friendship. My other close relationship with my partner is taking a rocky turn, especially since we are in a place in life with different levels of achievement and ambition. I know I’m very young, and that he (24m) is too, but I am in a position where I have more ambition and drive, whereas he is still struggling to decide what he wants to do with his life. This is also causing my immense stress, as I feel like this issue is consistently up in the air between us. 

I am used to being in a much more social environment; I’ve always had many friends. However, I had to move to a different state for my PhD, and so far have had a difficult time making new friends, especially because I’m much younger than most grad students around me, so I’m having a hard time making close friendships. This is making me feel more isolated than ever. 

Another huge thing that’s been hanging over is the question of whether I am doing enough or if I am competent enough to be doing this. As I mentioned, I am a first-year student, so I have not started my own research yet. While I am ontop of my other responsibilities, I feel insecure compared to the people around me, who I feel are often doing more. Plus, I have some colleagues who brag about how little sleep they have gotten, how they have broken up with their partners because of their workload, and how they often forget to feed themselves or do basic things because of how busy they are. I still have many hours to myself after I finish my required work, so I feel as if I’m doing something wrong. 

It doesn’t help that I don’t know how conferences work, how to publish papers, or how to network properly in academia. I am too ashamed to ask anyone. I feel lucky that I was even able to get into a PhD program, but now I feel like I can’t navigate it at all. 

For this reason, my anxiety has been eating me up. Writing this out in words is making me feel better, I will admit, but perhaps it’s because writing is a source of comfort for me. I have attempting to take up smoking (nicotine and marijuana), however, I can’t afford to keep up this habit (with my low-paying stipend), and both give me major headaches. I have also taken up painting and embroidery to relax, but then I feel a sense of uselessness come over me, like I’m wasting my time. I’ve given up coffee because it makes me jittery. I can’t afford weekly massages (though I have noticed those do help me relax). 

Does anyone have any anti-stress methods I can adopt, or advice on how to navigate the things that give me anxiety now? I desperately need help; I don’t want my anxiety to begin affecting my ability to do my work. Thank you for listening. ",1,1770135338.0,Advice,3,1.0,False

I wasn't the only one, the observatory has been time blocked for weeks. It's the only reason I'm here at 3:00 in the morning. 

I look over to the mug my mom got me, NASA in big bold letters. That was always the dream, exploring the final frontier. I never wanted to go to space, only know it. I spent hours at night glued to the hokey little telescope my grandfather got me. 

I put my eye back to the lens, twisting the crank ever slightly scanning the infinite horizon. I'm not even sure what I'm looking for at this point. 

Tucked around the visage of Saturn, I see a new form. My eyes almost don't believe what they're seeing. It looks wrong against the rings, drifting lightly escaping its gravity. 

I fall back in my chair, my elbow knocks my coffee. The mug slides and shatters on the floor. I go back in, amplify, start snapping pictures and recording video. 

This is insane, it looks beet red but it seems solid. There's glow, reflections of what might could be water? The implications of that alone would change everything. It almost looks like it has hairs, I rub my eyes but they're still there. Perhaps it's some kind of refraction. I watch the crimson ball twist slowly. 

I transfer everything to my hard drive. I need to get to the lab first thing, I can't begin to think of what my professor is going to say. The final project doesn't matter, I could name it, write the book on it. 

I grab my laptop and quickly sweep up the pieces of my mug. It's not far to my apartment, I run the entire way home. I collapse into bed exhausted but I can't sleep. The entire world is ripping at my brain. I spend most of the night staring at the ceiling until a brief rest captures me. 

I wake up before my alarm clock, I don't even bother hopping in the shower before grabbing my bag and getting out the door. I look up into the morning sky, somewhere it's out there. Maybe I'll name it after my mother. 

A loud honk almost sends me to my hands. I was too wrapped up in my own head, I didn't check the signal. I wave an apology and run to the other side of the road. 

I make it to the university and book it for my professors office. He's always here early. 

I shove open his door and he's kicked back drinking coffee while reading something on his phone. He chuckles to himself. 

""Good morning, you look like shit! Made any progress on your final project? I saw you got the night shift."" 

I fall into one of the chairs and grab my laptop out of my bag. ""I think you're going to have to pass me regardless after what I saw last night."" 

""Oh is that so? Let me see then."" 

I pull up the photographs and recordings and turn my laptop. He shoots up in his seat spilling some of his coffee. ""Oh my God, when did you see this? No that doesn't matter, you got fantastic data on it already."" 

""It's glowing but is reading similar to our surface temperature. What could cause this sort of result?""

He pushes up his glasses, getting inches from the monitor. ""Email this to me, go home, take a shower, and meet me at the lab in an hour."" 

I put my laptop back in the bag and take my leave. On my way back to the apartment, I notice a few sharply dressed men walking around campus. Their eyes are below thick shades but somehow they stare into me. Once I get home I quickly shower and eat something light. I don't quite know what to make of the conversation I just had. I should have known he wouldn't have dropped to my feet. Still, a ""good job"" would have been nice.

I make my way to the lab, a bit more sober in my grandiosity. By the time I come in a few of my classmates are already in there, my professor is sitting at the desk upfront while a few students huddle behind him. 

""There's the man of the hour, cmon and pull up a seat."" 

I drop my bag and roll a chair over. He looks over to me, ""I've got to hand it to you, the images and recordings are truly extraordinary. I've noticed that some of the measurements aren't making sense at all."" 

He pulls up some charts showing a variety of statistics, the speed is highlighted. I clear my throat and pipe up, ""that can't be how fast it's moving..""

""Oh but it is, and it seems to be able to control its own motion. It's heading here.""

My head is filled with infinitely more questions, I grab the only one I can find. ""About the glow?"" 

""I believe the mass itself is alive. It's reading in at about three times the size of our moon. It's not light via radiation, it's bioluminescence."" 

I feel last night's headache creeping back, this discovery really does change everything. My professor zooms back in on the mass, isolating the strange refractions. 

""I took a closer look, these aren't refractions at all. They're part of the greater organism."" 

""Like some kind of flagella?"" 

""Maybe, could also be a kind of sexual organ."" He winks at me.

I spin around in my chair and run my fingers through my hair. I can feel the sweat breaking my scalp. 

""So what's next, do I pass?"" 

My professor gives me a stern look. ""Now we wait... I've contacted the proper channels. They'll be here soon."" 

Sure enough, they were. It couldn't have been more than 15 minutes before two well dressed men entered the lab room. They each wore a black suit and thick earpieces. One stands with both hands behind his back in front of the door, the other walks briskly to my professor.

""Professor Thomason, my name is Special Agent Howard. I'm with the Department of Homeland Security. Which student made the discovery?"" 

He looks over at me, quickly nodding his head. ""If you need somewhere private we have the study rooms over in the far corner."" 

""Thank you Dr. Thomason, we don't plan to waste too much of your time."" 

I walk with the man over to the secluded study room. Homeland Security? I expected NASA or Space Force. I'm feeling apprehensive. 

""Go ahead and take a seat."" He gestures to one of the empty chairs. He shuts the door tight and takes a seat himself. 

""We've already dedicated a team to your discovery, congratulations."" 

I manage to crack a nervous smile, ""Thank you, I wasn't expecting to be meeting with someone from DHS."" 

His brow furrows, ""I'm sure you can ascertain via the extraordinary circumstances surrounding your findings, it's important the information is contained."" 

""Contained? Contained in what sense?"" I grow visibly frustrated.

""We are asking for your total cooperation, this will mean a confiscation of all personal electronics and the destruction of any records of your discovery."" 

I sit with the words for a moment. This discovery could change everything, not just for me and my career but the entire world. The public deserves to know. 

His head doesn't move, it's hard to read his expression through the sunglasses. ""We believe this information could be the single most destabilizing discovery of this millennium. It's in your best interest to cooperate."" 

""I'm not going to be threatened into silence. I've already prepared a media release to dozens of publications."" 

The man adjusts his glasses, ""If that's your prerogative. We can't help you."" 

He stands up out of the chair and walks to the entrance. He nods to the other man and they both leave without a word. 

I walk outside and straight to my laptop, I enter my password incorrectly maybe three times. My professor looks over at me concerned. 

""How did it go?"" 

""They said we couldn't release any of the findings."" 

""So what are you doing?"" 

""Getting ready to email my media packet to every major media publication in the western hemisphere."" 

""You're what??"" 

One of the girls sitting in the middle of the lab turns to both of us. ""Are y'all having any trouble with the WiFi? Mine just disconnected."" 

I look down to my laptop and realize the same. Everything is grayed out of my email. Nothing is getting out. 

It happens in an instant, I notice the lights flicker and the doors shake. All three entrances to the lab are blown in simultaneously. My ears are ringing from the charges. I squint through the smoke to see multiple masked men flooding in at every angle. I put my hands to the sky but it does nothing. There's a deafening rattle bouncing off of the walls. I feel the hot bullets pierce my skin dozens of times. One strikes my spine and my entire being goes numb. I'm dead before I hit the ground, same could be said for my classmates. 

Empty computer chairs, white polished tile sprayed with blood. My arm lies over the keyboard of my laptop as dozens of men rush to my corpse. The cursor sits just above a send button that wouldn't oblige. A steel-toed boot snaps the machine in half.

 I don't have an inflated sense of my worth. It is why I don't have a website or pursue tiktok or Instagram. I am ethical. I am the product of really good family and an ethical upbringing. So some of my skills were developed for fun. I have a regular job. 

My mother once sat on the couch and told my brothers to send me the message to stop on my way home to get ice cream before cell phones. I walked in the house with ice cream. At the store, I almost bought one specific flavor and stopped at two.

My little brother told me I didnt bring the flavor he ordered. I went back to the store.

I love reading for people. I love helping others. It is a vocation, not a hobby. I do have a sense of humor. I have been doing this for so many decades I remember being a kid when Elvis died and the Beatles broke up. I was reading for friends and family at the age of fifteen. 

I could tell my mom who was calling before the phone rang. I could predict who had passed and who was going to pass. I passed messages from the deceased to their loved ones.

 I was crossing spirits as a child. I change traffic signals for fun. I ask angels to protect drivers who are reckless and watch spirits slow down their driving, Small functions and hobbies.  I am telekinetic. I move more than paper on little sticks.

I speak to animals. They communicate in a number of ways.

I have many functions and feel I have many purposes left to accomplish, including helping to guide people all over the world through these times.

I have a very serious side. I have a humorous side.

One of my flaws is that I dont worry about reviews.

Still giggling. Have to stop. I'm hungry and need breakfast.

1quw5op,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/1quw5op/firstyear_phd_and_i_have_developed_intense/,"First-Year PhD, and I have developed intense anxiety. Would appreciate any advice!","I (23f) have been under immense anxiety the last few months, and I can visibly see it affecting my physical health. For example, I am suffering from physical symptoms of anxiety, such as anxiety attacks, visibly shaking, throwing up from stress, heart palpitations, hair loss, weight gain, difficulties losing weight, and fatigue. I am going to therapy, and I’m thinking about asking to start anti-anxiety medication. Still, in the meantime, I wanted to know if anyone could provide me with advice on how to settle my anxiety with other methods. 

I am a first-year PhD student in the humanities field at an R1 school in the United States. My current workload includes taking preliminary graduate classes in my field and serving as a teaching assistant for a mega class (teaching discussion sections and grading work for about 70 students). The workload itself is not stressful for me, infact it is often my only venue of peace. I enjoy reading, writing, and teaching. 

I have noticed a bulk of my anxiety comes from my interactions with my colleagues, friendships, and a feeling of inadequacy (like I’m not doing enough). I have made a previous post about this, but there are a few very mean PhD students (PhD candidates) in my department who absolutely dominate class discussion and make the educational environment hostile. Unfortunetly this semester, they are in every single one of my classes (where they were only in one of my classes last semester). For this reason, I feel as though I dissociate in classes because I can’t participate, or because they often go on tangents that make it hard to actually focus. For this reason, I get anxious actually going to class itself (but not doing the classwork). One such classmate has also been sexually harassing some of us women in the department, and we have resorted to locking ourselves in our offices when we are at the department.

I also feel so isolated, and I am clinging on hard to my only two friends (who are both my roommates and cohort). However, because I recognize these are the only friendships I have at this moment, I’ve become scared of upsetting them, so I often walk on eggshells around them, fearful of anything I may do wrong to jeopardize this friendship. My other close relationship with my partner is taking a rocky turn, especially since we are in a place in life with different levels of achievement and ambition. I know I’m very young, and that he (24m) is too, but I am in a position where I have more ambition and drive, whereas he is still struggling to decide what he wants to do with his life. This is also causing my immense stress, as I feel like this issue is consistently up in the air between us. 

I am used to being in a much more social environment; I’ve always had many friends. However, I had to move to a different state for my PhD, and so far have had a difficult time making new friends, especially because I’m much younger than most grad students around me, so I’m having a hard time making close friendships. This is making me feel more isolated than ever. 

Another huge thing that’s been hanging over is the question of whether I am doing enough or if I am competent enough to be doing this. As I mentioned, I am a first-year student, so I have not started my own research yet. While I am ontop of my other responsibilities, I feel insecure compared to the people around me, who I feel are often doing more. Plus, I have some colleagues who brag about how little sleep they have gotten, how they have broken up with their partners because of their workload, and how they often forget to feed themselves or do basic things because of how busy they are. I still have many hours to myself after I finish my required work, so I feel as if I’m doing something wrong. 

It doesn’t help that I don’t know how conferences work, how to publish papers, or how to network properly in academia. I am too ashamed to ask anyone. I feel lucky that I was even able to get into a PhD program, but now I feel like I can’t navigate it at all. 

For this reason, my anxiety has been eating me up. Writing this out in words is making me feel better, I will admit, but perhaps it’s because writing is a source of comfort for me. I have attempting to take up smoking (nicotine and marijuana), however, I can’t afford to keep up this habit (with my low-paying stipend), and both give me major headaches. I have also taken up painting and embroidery to relax, but then I feel a sense of uselessness come over me, like I’m wasting my time. I’ve given up coffee because it makes me jittery. I can’t afford weekly massages (though I have noticed those do help me relax). 

Does anyone have any anti-stress methods I can adopt, or advice on how to navigate the things that give me anxiety now? I desperately need help; I don’t want my anxiety to begin affecting my ability to do my work. Thank you for listening. ",1,1770135249.0,PhD,4,1.0,False

I am living abroad currently. I moved a few months back, I’m fully settled in. Since childhood I’ve always had a dream of living abroad, but the more I grew older the more I fell in love with my own culture and country. 

There is nothing I can say in detail without revealing where I’m from, however I will say that the government is absolutely terrible, economy is going to shit, education is getting harder and harder to access, femicides are at an all time high, now they’re talking about criminalizing queer folk. My beloved country is falling apart in front of my eyes. I was feeling hopeless when I got the news that I got the scholarship I had applied to in order to study abroad. Obviously I took the opportunity. But ever since I first got the news it’s been bothering me so much. 

Not that I’m displeased with my education or anything, I’m very blessed with good education, good housemates who are my best friends and a good social circle. It just always weighs on me that I’m away from the soil that raised me and the people that made me. Perhaps it will be hard for some folks to empathize with this level of love for one’s homeland, but it’s not uncommon at all where I’m from. 

Had things been different, I could’ve remained where I was raised. I would’ve understood what random men yelled at me on the streets and I could’ve formulated a response accordingly. I would’ve been able to go outside and strike up a conversation with random strangers and go to old ladies’ homes for tea and coffee. I would’ve still been able to navigate every street, every seller, every social situation.

I have a huge community of expats that came from my home country at the country I live in, that community and my housemates are the only things that makes this whole thing bearable. 

I don’t want to sound ungrateful, I am very grateful and very privileged to have such an opportunity. Lord knows others from my homeland work their asses off to leave the country. It just is nothing like little me imagined. If my country was in a slightly better state, I would’ve stayed. I would not even have considered leaving. 

I’m a teaching student, so I comfort myself saying that I am studying to educate the next generation of my country but it falls flat a lot. A part of me feels like I betrayed my people by leaving. (There is a stigma against people that leave the country)

TLDR : I miss my homeland, I feel guilty for leaving but this is the only way I could find to have a stable future. I am homesick constantly, I wish things were different. ",2,1770134970.0,Vent,1,1.0,False

torrential downpour, the clock's ticking away,

For context, the last few years she's been suffering from some medical issues that have kept her home most of the time besides going to work.  the last few months things have finally improved enough to where we've been able to go out on date nights.

few months ago we started going to a lounge with live music and she really like the band and the songs they played.  She then followed the band on facebook and mentioned the next time they played she'd like to see them again.  I was just happy we were getting out and being an active couple again.

One day she told me the lead singer reached out on messenger asking if she wanted to meet for coffee.  she said that her husband might want to know why in which he replied he was looking to see if our insurance coverage were sufficient.  she said no thanks and that was it.

the second time we saw the band she got to dance and had a good time.  Nothing bad happened and she did briefly talk to the lead singer asking for a specific song to be played.  Was a nice night and went home.

Now fast forward to last week and they again played and she wanted to go see them.  she again got to dance and the night was nice and we went home.  

However, there's been something in my gut that just bothered me.  I couldn't put a pin on it but just something was off.  We have an open phone policy in that she can look at my phone and i hers any time.  So I did....and what i found bothered me.

  
I found that the lead singer had been continuing to message her.  However those messages were deleted as were her responses.  I also saw a text between her and a friend of hers that also knows the singer and she told her that the singer had grabbed her butt 3 times that night.

My heard sunk and my stomach went into a knot.

I secluded myself for the next hour trying to figure out what to do and my mind was going places that would be resolved by just talking it out and asking her what was going on.

So i did.  I told her i've been feeling something was off and told her i looked at her phone and found these messages.  She said it was just harmless flirting and nothing more.  In which i replied, that's fine, but you don't have to reciprocate and most importantly you should have told me about it and the ass grabbing.  I asked if she told him to stop and she did not.  I asked what the messages actually said.  All she told me was he said she was sexy and kept asking if they could meet for 'coffee'.

I thought it fair to ask her to block the band and that we were no longer going to see them.  I think that was fair and prudent.

While she was doing so her snapchat icon showed a new message.  I had asked if there was anything else and she had said no.  Turns out, the guitarist in the band had also been messaging her on snap for weeks.  Also telling her how sexy she is and if she wanted a massage, etc.  My heart sunk even further.  I then asked if any pics were sent in either direction.  She hesitated and then said that she had sent the singer a topless pic.

At that point i walked out of the bedroom but then came back and told her to go stay at her moms.  I couldn't deal with this any further that night.

She left.

I've asked multiple times if anything further happened.  Did they meet up for an encounter of any kind etc?  She said no but at this point I don't know what to believe.

I don't think our marriage can recover from this as I don't know how i can ever trust her again.  I'm seriously considering a divorce attorney.

1quvorq,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1quvorq/aitah_for_leaving_my_girlfriends_grandmas_house/,AITAH for leaving my girlfriend's grandma's house early?,"So I work remotely, and I've been staying with my girlfriends' family in Colombia. She wanted to have lunch with her grandma, so her grandma could show me how to make ajiaco. I agreed, because the grandma is lovely and her ajiaco is amazing. I also told both of them that I would have to be working during the prep and afterwards, as my workload was quite high.

I worked while they made the ajiaco, ate the ajiaco with my gf and her grandma and three cousins who showed up. I thanked the grandma, and I did all the dishes so that the grandma wouldnt feel exploited or anything. Then the grandma wanted to get coffee, so I went with her and we had some coffee. When I got back two new uncles had arrived, and it was getting loud and bit boozy at grandmas house. 

I asked my gf if it was ok if I left, she said it was fine and I ordered an Uber. When the Uber was on the way the grandma came out with natillas (a desert) that she really wanted me to try. I told her I really had to work, and that an Uber was already on the way, and left. 

My girlfriend was livid when she came home, and ridiculed me infront of her parents, calling me ""don-afan"" (Mr. Hurry) and rolling her eyes. I had told her before that ridiculing me infront of her parents was a hard boundary for me, and so we went for a walk and I told her to please not do that. I said it nicely. But she just shouted back and said it was an offhand comment and she hadn't meant anything by it and that I was an asshole for leaving grandmas house, and that if I don't want to hang out with her family I shouldn't make plans with them.

Colombians are very tight knit and not very time sensitive, so I knew that a lunch plan would probably go on until 6 or 7, so she's right in a way. But the way she shouted at me and gaslight me about crossing a boundary we'd talked before makes me wonder if I might not have picked a very good partner. Staying with her family is stressful for me anyway, and it's a very vulnerable position, and being treated like this when I'm in such a vulnerable state makes me wonder if I should get out of here and get an Airbnb.

She's generally a good person, but when she gets upset it's really intense and I feel very unwelcome in her family home. AITA for feeling this way?",1,1770134206.0,AITAH,1,1.0,False

My boss (41 M with a wife and toddler) seemingly latched onto her and started really hyper focusing on her to the point it looked like he had established himself as her mentor with all his directing. well he went to far one day and admonish our intern during a public event, resulting in HR and the VP getting involved.

“The Rejection”

POV Amelia

I’m busy scrubbing the pots and pans when the head cook barks at me, “Amelia, the Alpha wants to see you.”

I walk slowly to his office, wondering if Alpha Sebastian has finally decided between me, his mate, or his chosen mate, Celest, to be his Luna.

“Amelia, please have a seat,” he says.

“Hi, Sebastian,” I whimper.

“You will now address me only as your Alpha,” he says coldly.

‘Asshole,’ my wolf Athena says.

“He doesn’t have a choice. His father is forcing him to marry Celest,” I tell my wolf.

“As you know, Celest and I are getting married next week. She is refusing to come here until I reject you.”

I put my head down, close my eyes, and prepare myself.

He inhales deeply. “I, Sebastian Collins, of the Dark Moon Pack, reject you, Amelia Song, of the Dark Moon Pack.”

Tears stream down my face as I wait for the pain.

“You need to accept my rejection,” he barks.

“I don’t want to,” I sob.

“I don’t care what you want; I can’t marry Celest until you do,” he snarls.

“I, Amelia Song, reject you, Sebastian Collins, as my mate.”

I wait for the pain, but nothing comes. Sebastian’s body trembles, and he passes out.

His beta, Chance, comes in, and the guards take Sebastian to the hospital.

Chance looks at me oddly and sits in Sebastian’s chair.

“The Dark Howlers pack has contacted us and requested you be sent to them.”

“I’m not a virgin. Only virgin girls can be tributes. Obsidian Knox will kill me,” I plead.

“Your sexual status is not my problem. You are no longer the mate of my Alpha. Pack your things. You will be picked up in an hour,” he says.

He opens the door and gestures for me to leave.

‘I will kill his Luna on my next hunt,’ Athena declares.

I sob as I pack my bags to leave.

I step outside and try to calm myself. Taking a deep breath, I slide down the brick wall and sit in the grass.

“I hate my life!” I yell to no one while tears fall down my cheeks. 

I rip out the grass blade by blade to try to make myself feel better.

I see a large SUV coming toward me in the distance, and I decide to ignore it.

When the SUV pulls up, a large, monstrous, attractive man steps out.

I don’t look up; I just continue ripping out the grass.

He picks me up, puts me in the back seat, and loads up my bags in the car.

‘I like him,’ Athena purrs.

I sit as far away from him as possible.

“Your father promised you as a breeder to my Alpha when you turned 19,” he says, playing with my curls and letting them spring back.

My eyes widen. 

I had no idea I was promised to Obsidian. 

Why would my father be so cruel?

Obsidian is the Alpha every pack fears.

He’s known for slaughtering entire packs over the smallest offenses.

Every few months, desperate packs send tributes to his territory to appease him.

“I’m Kaden, Obsidian’s Beta. I’ve been sent to assure you’re safely delivered.”

“Oh,” is all I manage to get out.

“Why were you not sent on your nineteenth birthday? Why are you covered in rune markings?” he says, delicately lifting my arms and looking me over.

I remain silent for the rest of the drive.

Kaden doesn’t push me for answers.



The vehicle pulls up to a large castle. The minute I step out, Kaden pulls me inside, and my brain feels like it’s going to melt down.

‘We’re not going to die. At most, he’ll send us to the dungeon, and we’ll escape tomorrow,’ Athena explains, calm as a cucumber.

Kaden takes me into a large office, gives me a bottle of water, and shuts the door.

I gulp the water down like it’s my last drink on earth.

The door swings open. A tall, dangerously handsome man with icy blue eyes and chin length black hair steps inside, his face void of emotion.

He sits in the chair in front of me and pulls me closer so our knees are touching.

“I’m going to ask you a few questions, and if you answer honestly, I will let you live. If you lie, then I will kill you instantly,” he warns.

“Did you know you were promised to me by your father?”

I shake my head. “My parents are dead,” I whisper.

His eyes widen. “Are you a virgin?”

I feel the air shift in the room. 

I hesitate, then shake my head. Obsidian loses it, trashing the office as I sit frozen in the chair.

He storms out of the room, and Kaden comes in and takes his place.

“How many men have you been with?” Kaden asks.

I hold up one finger.

“You’ve been with one person?” he says.

I nod.

“Who is this person?” Kaden asks.

I look down and don’t answer. I couldn’t bear it if someone hurt Sebastian.

“Do you want to die?” Kaden asks.

I shake my head.

“Then tell me who you slept with,” Kaden snarls.



Chapter 2

“The Cursed”

POV Amelia

Obsidian steps back into the office.

“The man you slept with. Do you love him?”

I nod slowly.

“Does he love you?” he asks.

I shake my head.

“Put her in the dungeon until I decide what to do with her,” Obsidian growls.

I stand up, and Kaden gently guides me out.

“Wait,” Obsidian says. “What do the runes drawn all over your skin mean?”

“The healers draw them on to protect the pack from my cursed wolf.”

He looks at me, perplexed, but doesn’t push further.

“Can you shift?” he asks.

“Sometimes, but not right now,” I say.

Kaden takes me to a cell in the dungeon and leaves.

I curl up on the cot.

I am not as weak as I appear. The healers have carved painful runes into my skin since I was a child to suppress my wolf. 

But the Blood Moon gives my cursed wolf enough power to shift and seek revenge on all who have hurt her, in her past lives and in the present.

Tomorrow is the Blood Moon.



I wake up to Obsidian shoving a drink down my throat.

“Drink it all,” he orders.

It tastes like blood and wine. 

I fight my stomach, trying not to bring it back up.

I feel the bond break from my old pack. An intense pain shoots through me, and I scream.

“You feel no pain,” Obsidian whispers, and the pain vanishes.

I feel the new bond to the Obsidian pack snap in place.

‘We officially belong to him now,’ Athena sings.

“Why is that such a good thing? He can still kill us,” I say to her.

Obsidian strokes my hair until I fall asleep.

I wake up in a locked room with open bay windows, and I’m six stories up.

I pour a bath with rose and lavender and melt into it.

“Amelia,” Kaden says, walking into the bathroom. 

I hide my body from him.

“You need not fear me. My job is to protect you. Tonight is the blood moon, when the demon wolf is on the hunt. No one is safe,” he says. “She has never been spotted in our pack, but Obsidian wants you safe just in case.”

I try not to laugh. It is my wolf that he is speaking of. I dare not tell him, or I’ll get thrown out of his pack.

“Holy fuck, is there not a part of you that’s not covered in runes?” he asks.

“It’s to protect you,” I smirk

“You’re such a tiny thing. I doubt your wolf could do much damage,” he chuckles.

“Can I get a little privacy, please?” I ask.

“Yes, of course, little wolf.” He smiles. “Rest assured, our pack is demon wolf proof. She will never get inside our fortress or anywhere near you.”

“There is nowhere she can sneak in?” I ask, for Athena.

“The backwoods, but they are haunted by witches. They would capture her and have her do their bidding,” he explains. “There is enough food on the nightstand to last the night. I’ll check on you in the morning.” 

The moment he’s gone, I wrap myself in a towel, climb into bed, and wait.

There is no point in dressing. The clothes would be destroyed when I shift.

The minute the sun goes down, I feel the raw power of the Blood Moon and fall into darkness.



I wake up the following morning on the bare floor, covered in blood.

My body is sore from head to toe from the rare shift and the damage did fighting all night, and I can barely move. 

I crawl to the shower, turn the water on as hot as possible, and let my sore muscles melt from the heat.

I scrub myself from head to toe until the evidence of last night is gone.

Athena is deep asleep.

I crawl back to my bed, wiping the blood off the floor with my hair towel and chuck it under the bed.

The moment I slide into the silk sheets, the door swings open, and an excited Kaden comes in.

He takes one look at me and looks concerned.

“Should I get the healer?” He asks.

Do I look exhausted?

“No healers. They only fear my wolf and cover me with more runes.”

“There’s no place to draw more runes,” he chuckles.

“They will find room. The process is painful. I just want them gone, but that takes time and no healers.”

“I understand. I just wanted you to know the demon wolf strolled through our village last night and out the gate and didn’t harm anyone here,” Kaden says.

“Oh, wow, really?”

I play along.

“Yeah, I guess the warriors were frozen in shock, and one of them just opened the gate and let her leave.”

“I’m glad no one was hurt,” I say.

“Some of the villagers saw her jump the wall this morning and disappear into the pack, which means she’s from our pack.” He grins from ear to ear.

“Does that mean you will seek her out and kill her?” I ask.

“No, we’re the most feared pack. Obsidian wants to find her and make her his wife,” Kaden chuckles.

I suddenly feel jealous of myself. Or perhaps he knows who I am and wants me to tell the truth so he can kill me?

“What packs did she attack?” I ask.

“Oh, I’m not sure if you want to hear this, but she killed half your pack members, including the Luna, then burned down most of the pack. It sounds like you left at the right time,” he says.

I hide the smile on my face with the blanket.

“That’s terrible news. I hope the Alpha and my family are okay.”

“The Alpha? Why would you care if the Alpha lived or died?” Kaden asks suspiciously.

“Um, well, without him, the pack would fall into chaos,” I say, hoping my feelings for him don’t show on my face.

“I will inquire about your family,” he says, leaving.

The moment he’s gone, I pass out from exhaustion and wake up to a healer and Obsidian in my room.

I dive away from the healer. “Don’t touch me,” I growl.

“You’ve been asleep since yesterday morning,” Obsidian says, concerned.

“Your runes are fading; you need more,” the healer says.

“I don’t want your runes! Stay away from me,” I hiss.

Obsidian looks between me and the healer. “She said no runes. If I find out you put more on her body, I will kill you myself,” he barks, and the healer runs out of the room.

“I’m here to tell you the demon wolf didn’t hurt anyone in your family, and the Alpha was injured trying to save the Luna, but he is fine. He enquired about you returning, and I said no,” Obsidian says.

My heart stops. He wants me back?

“If I find out it was the Alpha that took your virginity, I will kill him,” Obsidian growls, walking out of the room.

‘You’re so easy to read. Your feelings for Alpha Sebastian are written all over your face,’ Athena says.

“I hope he doesn’t hurt him.”

‘As long as he’s not stupid enough to show up here looking for you,’ Athena warns.

I crawl out of bed feeling stiff again.

I have a hot shower, and the minute I step back in the room, two healers are waiting for me. The door is locked and there is no escape.



Chapter 3

“The healers”

POV Amelia

I panic and lock myself in the bathroom, but they find a way in.

I crawl out the tiny bathroom window, and onto the ledge, completely naked, and try to follow the small ledge to the window in the next room.

The healer peers out the window, and one of them tries to follow me. 

A piece of the ledge gives way, and I almost tumble six stories. 

My body starts to tremble uncontrollably in fear, and I continue along, but I’m not able to open the next window.

The healer is closing in, and I’m about to keep moving along the ledge when I hear a scream.

The window suddenly opens behind me, someone yanks me in, and I scream at the top of my lungs. “Please don’t hurt me!”

It’s Kaden. He looks at me bewildered and steps out onto the ledge and tosses the healer off the ledge.

He grabs a sheet off the bed and wraps it around me. Giving me a tight squeeze.

“You’re safe, Amelia. I don’t understand why these healers are obsessed with you, that they would risk their death,” Kaden says.

“I told you. They think my wolf is dangerous.”

“You’re being moved to the mistress’s floor. It’s a heavily guarded floor.”

“I thought I was going to be Obsidian’s breeder.”

“You were, but you are no longer pure, so he’s decided you will become a mistress instead,” he says.

He leads me to my new room. As I walk through the mistress’s floor, I notice all the girls have dark hair and green eyes. I am the only girl with white hair.

“Does Obsidian have a preference for women?” I ask.

“The rumour mill is he prefers only girls with green eyes and dark hair, so the packs always send them to Obsidian as gifts.”

“Should I dye my hair black?”

“No, Amelia. You’re the most beautiful girl here. Don’t change a thing. If you have issues with jealousy, you inform me right away,” he demands.

“Okay,” I say.

My room is gorgeous, with wood floors, a massive bed, and expensive furnishings.

“This is your room now,” he says, leaving.

The door is metal and enforced. The windows all open and will make it easy for Athena to escape unseen during the blood moons.

Every time I step foot outside my room, the girls swarm me and call me ugly until I start to get a complex.

For weeks I wait, and he never comes to see me.

My favorite time in the morning is when Obsidian is done with his girls, and has a fresh shower, and walks by.

His scent is sweet musk and pine, and makes me feel like I’m standing in the middle of a forest.

I noticed him come out of Enya’s room naked, his body glistening, his torso sculpted like a Greek god. 

My mouth drools as I watch a wall of muscle walk down the hall without a care in the world. 

When our eyes meet, he scowls.

I duck back into my room

He swings open my door.

“Why are you sitting on the floor eating?” he growls.

“I needed some fresh air,” I smile.

“Then open a fucking window.”

“That’s not the fresh air I was referring to,” I say, taking him all in.

I was thinking of his musk and pine scent.

His lips turn into a slight smile.

“Do you think I’m ugly?” I ask. “The other girls think I’m ugly to you, and that’s why you never come to see me.”

“My mother picked you out for me when you were young, shortly before she died. I’m just disappointed to find out you were deflowered,” he says.

“Great, ugly and disappointing,” I pout.

“You are important to me, Amelia. I just need time, and I can’t promise I won’t kill him,” he says, leaning down and kissing my cheek.

My heart flutters, and he gives me a tight squeeze and leaves.

The longer I go without seeing the healers, the more the runes fade and the stronger Athena gets.

I’m pouring myself a glass of milk one morning, and one of the girls bumps into me. My glass shatters on the floor.

I bend down to clean it up, and the girl kicks me in the ass. I fall on the broken glass, face first, the glass cutting up my arms and face, and Athena loses it.

She dives on top of her, beating her until she’s unconscious. Obsidian walks in and finds me on top of her.

He pulls me off her and sees the glass stuck in me and loses it.

“I’m calling a healer,” he growls.

“No, no, please don’t.” I start ripping out the glass myself. 

“Stop that immediately,” he growls. “You’re going to scar your face.”

“Only if you promise not to send me a healer,” I plead.

He picks me up and carries me down the hall into a medical room and locks the door. 

Obsidian gives me a shot for pain and takes his time slowly pulling out the glass.

“Tell me exactly what happened and don’t lie,” he orders.

I give him the details of what happened, and his jaw clenches and his eyes narrow.

There’s a knock on the door, and I panic.

“It’s my Beta,” he says.

Kaden comes in and takes over, and Obsidian storms out.

I was enjoying our time together. I hope he’s not mad.

“He’s not mad at you,” Kaden says, like he’s reading my mind. “He’s angry one of the girls hurt you.”

“Then why did he leave?” I ask.

“He wants to take care of it personally to make sure it doesn’t happen again,” Kaden explains.

“He doesn’t even give me the time of day. I don’t think he really cares,” I mutter.

“Alpha Sebastian won’t stop calling to speak to you. Every time he calls, Obsidian loses it. You need to talk to Sebastian before he kills him.”

“How? I have no phone in my room.”

“Amelia, you have the run of the castle. We placed you here for your safety.”

“You said I was Obsidian mistress. Why would I have access to the whole castle?”

“Just accept that you do. Call your old Alpha as soon as we’re done.”

“When I’m done and my cuts are all dressed, Kaden takes me to the closest phone.”

“Alpha?”

“Amelia?”

“Yes.” I light up.

“Please come home to me,” he pleads.

“Obsidian knows you took my virginity. If you call again, he’s going to kill you. I was apparently promised to him when I was a child by my father,” I explain.

“You told him? I warned you not to tell anyone. You dumb bitch. I should never have touched you.” He slams down the phone.

‘Let me get out my pen, yup, he’s added to the list,’ Athena says.

“Don’t you dare hurt him,” I hiss at her.

‘Fine, I’ll put him on the maybe kill list. You shouldn’t allow a man you love to treat us that way,’ Athena grumbles.

I open the door, and Kaden is standing there.

“Did you listen in on my whole personal conversation?” I pretend to be angry and stomp off.

“Yes,” Kaden growls.

I head back to our kitchen to eat.

I sit down and pour myself a coffee and order lunch.

“Looks like Enya made an improvement on your ugly face,” Ella hisses.

“Fuck off,” I bark.

 It's a music video about a breakfast song. I think it's a, but every ingredient or every component of the breakfast would sing its own name. For example, salt would say salt, salt, salt, and pepper would say pepper, and bacon would say bacon, and the song goes on for a little bit, introducing new components, and I can't find this video anywhere on the internet, so I need help so find this

The song goes like “salt, salt, pepper, salt, salt, pepper” showing the salt and the pepper dancing and than bacon chimes in singing “bacon” along with salt and pepper, then there is strawberry jam, coffee, sugar-free low-fat milk and a bunch of other components

Yesterday I spent 2 hours meal prepping an entire bag of Little Duos (about 30 potatoes). I boiled them for 15 minutes, made a garlic, thyme, and rosemary brown butter and meticulously measured out 10 grams of shredded cheese for each potato. I then mashed each potato using the back of a glass to be only about a half to a quarter inch thick, drenched them in the butter sauce and popped them in the oven for an hour to crisp. The house smelled INCREDIBLE.

About 5 of those potatoes couldnt fit on the tray so I decided to eat those un mashed ones with a little smoked fish for dinner.

Once the hour was up, I took them out to cool and then boxed them up and put them in the fridge. I was VERY excited to eat them with lunch the following day and did not have any of the finished product at the time.

My partner is a night worker. I told him what I was making before he left for work, let him know I was meal prepping but told him he could have some (key word SOME) when he got home.

Imagine my surprise when I walk into the goddamn livingroom to see the container where I stored 25 smashed potatoes dirty and empty just... sitting on the coffee table. Not in the sink, not in the dish washer. Sitting proudly in the middle of my livingroom.

I want to cry and commit murder. Money, a grocery trip and 2 hours of my time completely disappeared into the bottomless pit of a stomach my careless and negligent partner possesses.

I feel like I have every right to demand he goes back to the store to re buy every ingredient he horked down but IM ALSO RAGING AND HORMONAL!!!

Goooood, days like these I wish I was an 80 year old woman alone in my home with 10 cats.

It’s like once he turned 2 a few months ago everything changed. He seems constantly anxious. A few examples this morning alone:

\- Did not want to wake up and upset I opened the curtains. He slept fairly well. Generally he’s a horrible sleeper and wakes up several times a night crying about something irrelevant. He may be having nightmares or night terrors.

\- I made pancakes which he loves and he is upset that I’m using a certain pan, which I’ve used before. Also does not want me to make extras for dad

\- Upset that his socks are not over his pants instead of under them

\- Did not want to brush his teeth

\- Did not want me using a new mug for my coffee

\- Did not want me blow drying my hair

\- Has been saying his fingers hurt at bedtime and wants me to massage them. I see no injuries or bruising.

In general he gets anxious and wants me to “fix things” like when his pillow isn’t straight, when a blanket isn’t covering him fully, when a block isn’t in the “right” place, when a piece of food doesn’t look “right”.

Is this typical? Or should I speak with his pediatrician? He is verbal, social, can read letters and numbers, and meeting all other milestones otherwise.",2,1770133714.0,toddlers,6,1.0,False

“The Rejection”

POV Amelia

I’m busy scrubbing the pots and pans when the head cook barks at me, “Amelia, the Alpha wants to see you.”

I walk slowly to his office, wondering if Alpha Sebastian has finally decided between me, his mate, or his chosen mate, Celest, to be his Luna.

“Amelia, please have a seat,” he says.

“Hi, Sebastian,” I whimper.

“You will now address me only as your Alpha,” he says coldly.

‘Asshole,’ my wolf Athena says.

“He doesn’t have a choice. His father is forcing him to marry Celest,” I tell my wolf.

“As you know, Celest and I are getting married next week. She is refusing to come here until I reject you.”

I put my head down, close my eyes, and prepare myself.

He inhales deeply. “I, Sebastian Collins, of the Dark Moon Pack, reject you, Amelia Song, of the Dark Moon Pack.”

Tears stream down my face as I wait for the pain.

“You need to accept my rejection,” he barks.

“I don’t want to,” I sob.

“I don’t care what you want; I can’t marry Celest until you do,” he snarls.

“I, Amelia Song, reject you, Sebastian Collins, as my mate.”

I wait for the pain, but nothing comes. Sebastian’s body trembles, and he passes out.

His beta, Chance, comes in, and the guards take Sebastian to the hospital.

Chance looks at me oddly and sits in Sebastian’s chair.

“The Dark Howlers pack has contacted us and requested you be sent to them.”

“I’m not a virgin. Only virgin girls can be tributes. Obsidian Knox will kill me,” I plead.

“Your sexual status is not my problem. You are no longer the mate of my Alpha. Pack your things. You will be picked up in an hour,” he says.

He opens the door and gestures for me to leave.

‘I will kill his Luna on my next hunt,’ Athena declares.

I sob as I pack my bags to leave.

I step outside and try to calm myself. Taking a deep breath, I slide down the brick wall and sit in the grass.

“I hate my life!” I yell to no one while tears fall down my cheeks. 

I rip out the grass blade by blade to try to make myself feel better.

I see a large SUV coming toward me in the distance, and I decide to ignore it.

When the SUV pulls up, a large, monstrous, attractive man steps out.

I don’t look up; I just continue ripping out the grass.

He picks me up, puts me in the back seat, and loads up my bags in the car.

‘I like him,’ Athena purrs.

I sit as far away from him as possible.

“Your father promised you as a breeder to my Alpha when you turned 19,” he says, playing with my curls and letting them spring back.

My eyes widen. 

I had no idea I was promised to Obsidian. 

Why would my father be so cruel?

Obsidian is the Alpha every pack fears.

He’s known for slaughtering entire packs over the smallest offenses.

Every few months, desperate packs send tributes to his territory to appease him.

“I’m Kaden, Obsidian’s Beta. I’ve been sent to assure you’re safely delivered.”

“Oh,” is all I manage to get out.

“Why were you not sent on your nineteenth birthday? Why are you covered in rune markings?” he says, delicately lifting my arms and looking me over.

I remain silent for the rest of the drive.

Kaden doesn’t push me for answers.



The vehicle pulls up to a large castle. The minute I step out, Kaden pulls me inside, and my brain feels like it’s going to melt down.

‘We’re not going to die. At most, he’ll send us to the dungeon, and we’ll escape tomorrow,’ Athena explains, calm as a cucumber.

Kaden takes me into a large office, gives me a bottle of water, and shuts the door.

I gulp the water down like it’s my last drink on earth.

The door swings open. A tall, dangerously handsome man with icy blue eyes and chin length black hair steps inside, his face void of emotion.

He sits in the chair in front of me and pulls me closer so our knees are touching.

“I’m going to ask you a few questions, and if you answer honestly, I will let you live. If you lie, then I will kill you instantly,” he warns.

“Did you know you were promised to me by your father?”

I shake my head. “My parents are dead,” I whisper.

His eyes widen. “Are you a virgin?”

I feel the air shift in the room. 

I hesitate, then shake my head. Obsidian loses it, trashing the office as I sit frozen in the chair.

He storms out of the room, and Kaden comes in and takes his place.

“How many men have you been with?” Kaden asks.

I hold up one finger.

“You’ve been with one person?” he says.

I nod.

“Who is this person?” Kaden asks.

I look down and don’t answer. I couldn’t bear it if someone hurt Sebastian.

“Do you want to die?” Kaden asks.

I shake my head.

“Then tell me who you slept with,” Kaden snarls.



Chapter 2

“The Cursed”

POV Amelia

Obsidian steps back into the office.

“The man you slept with. Do you love him?”

I nod slowly.

“Does he love you?” he asks.

I shake my head.

“Put her in the dungeon until I decide what to do with her,” Obsidian growls.

I stand up, and Kaden gently guides me out.

“Wait,” Obsidian says. “What do the runes drawn all over your skin mean?”

“The healers draw them on to protect the pack from my cursed wolf.”

He looks at me, perplexed, but doesn’t push further.

“Can you shift?” he asks.

“Sometimes, but not right now,” I say.

Kaden takes me to a cell in the dungeon and leaves.

I curl up on the cot.

I am not as weak as I appear. The healers have carved painful runes into my skin since I was a child to suppress my wolf. 

But the Blood Moon gives my cursed wolf enough power to shift and seek revenge on all who have hurt her, in her past lives and in the present.

Tomorrow is the Blood Moon.



I wake up to Obsidian shoving a drink down my throat.

“Drink it all,” he orders.

It tastes like blood and wine. 

I fight my stomach, trying not to bring it back up.

I feel the bond break from my old pack. An intense pain shoots through me, and I scream.

“You feel no pain,” Obsidian whispers, and the pain vanishes.

I feel the new bond to the Obsidian pack snap in place.

‘We officially belong to him now,’ Athena sings.

“Why is that such a good thing? He can still kill us,” I say to her.

Obsidian strokes my hair until I fall asleep.

I wake up in a locked room with open bay windows, and I’m six stories up.

I pour a bath with rose and lavender and melt into it.

“Amelia,” Kaden says, walking into the bathroom. 

I hide my body from him.

“You need not fear me. My job is to protect you. Tonight is the blood moon, when the demon wolf is on the hunt. No one is safe,” he says. “She has never been spotted in our pack, but Obsidian wants you safe just in case.”

I try not to laugh. It is my wolf that he is speaking of. I dare not tell him, or I’ll get thrown out of his pack.

“Holy fuck, is there not a part of you that’s not covered in runes?” he asks.

“It’s to protect you,” I smirk

“You’re such a tiny thing. I doubt your wolf could do much damage,” he chuckles.

“Can I get a little privacy, please?” I ask.

“Yes, of course, little wolf.” He smiles. “Rest assured, our pack is demon wolf proof. She will never get inside our fortress or anywhere near you.”

“There is nowhere she can sneak in?” I ask, for Athena.

“The backwoods, but they are haunted by witches. They would capture her and have her do their bidding,” he explains. “There is enough food on the nightstand to last the night. I’ll check on you in the morning.” 

The moment he’s gone, I wrap myself in a towel, climb into bed, and wait.

There is no point in dressing. The clothes would be destroyed when I shift.

The minute the sun goes down, I feel the raw power of the Blood Moon and fall into darkness.



I wake up the following morning on the bare floor, covered in blood.

My body is sore from head to toe from the rare shift and the damage did fighting all night, and I can barely move. 

I crawl to the shower, turn the water on as hot as possible, and let my sore muscles melt from the heat.

I scrub myself from head to toe until the evidence of last night is gone.

Athena is deep asleep.

I crawl back to my bed, wiping the blood off the floor with my hair towel and chuck it under the bed.

The moment I slide into the silk sheets, the door swings open, and an excited Kaden comes in.

He takes one look at me and looks concerned.

“Should I get the healer?” He asks.

Do I look exhausted?

“No healers. They only fear my wolf and cover me with more runes.”

“There’s no place to draw more runes,” he chuckles.

“They will find room. The process is painful. I just want them gone, but that takes time and no healers.”

“I understand. I just wanted you to know the demon wolf strolled through our village last night and out the gate and didn’t harm anyone here,” Kaden says.

“Oh, wow, really?”

I play along.

“Yeah, I guess the warriors were frozen in shock, and one of them just opened the gate and let her leave.”

“I’m glad no one was hurt,” I say.

“Some of the villagers saw her jump the wall this morning and disappear into the pack, which means she’s from our pack.” He grins from ear to ear.

“Does that mean you will seek her out and kill her?” I ask.

“No, we’re the most feared pack. Obsidian wants to find her and make her his wife,” Kaden chuckles.

I suddenly feel jealous of myself. Or perhaps he knows who I am and wants me to tell the truth so he can kill me?

“What packs did she attack?” I ask.

“Oh, I’m not sure if you want to hear this, but she killed half your pack members, including the Luna, then burned down most of the pack. It sounds like you left at the right time,” he says.

I hide the smile on my face with the blanket.

“That’s terrible news. I hope the Alpha and my family are okay.”

“The Alpha? Why would you care if the Alpha lived or died?” Kaden asks suspiciously.

“Um, well, without him, the pack would fall into chaos,” I say, hoping my feelings for him don’t show on my face.

“I will inquire about your family,” he says, leaving.

The moment he’s gone, I pass out from exhaustion and wake up to a healer and Obsidian in my room.

I dive away from the healer. “Don’t touch me,” I growl.

“You’ve been asleep since yesterday morning,” Obsidian says, concerned.

“Your runes are fading; you need more,” the healer says.

“I don’t want your runes! Stay away from me,” I hiss.

Obsidian looks between me and the healer. “She said no runes. If I find out you put more on her body, I will kill you myself,” he barks, and the healer runs out of the room.

“I’m here to tell you the demon wolf didn’t hurt anyone in your family, and the Alpha was injured trying to save the Luna, but he is fine. He enquired about you returning, and I said no,” Obsidian says.

My heart stops. He wants me back?

“If I find out it was the Alpha that took your virginity, I will kill him,” Obsidian growls, walking out of the room.

‘You’re so easy to read. Your feelings for Alpha Sebastian are written all over your face,’ Athena says.

“I hope he doesn’t hurt him.”

‘As long as he’s not stupid enough to show up here looking for you,’ Athena warns.

I crawl out of bed feeling stiff again.

I have a hot shower, and the minute I step back in the room, two healers are waiting for me. The door is locked and there is no escape.



Chapter 3

“The healers”

POV Amelia

I panic and lock myself in the bathroom, but they find a way in.

I crawl out the tiny bathroom window, and onto the ledge, completely naked, and try to follow the small ledge to the window in the next room.

The healer peers out the window, and one of them tries to follow me. 

A piece of the ledge gives way, and I almost tumble six stories. 

My body starts to tremble uncontrollably in fear, and I continue along, but I’m not able to open the next window.

The healer is closing in, and I’m about to keep moving along the ledge when I hear a scream.

The window suddenly opens behind me, someone yanks me in, and I scream at the top of my lungs. “Please don’t hurt me!”

It’s Kaden. He looks at me bewildered and steps out onto the ledge and tosses the healer off the ledge.

He grabs a sheet off the bed and wraps it around me. Giving me a tight squeeze.

“You’re safe, Amelia. I don’t understand why these healers are obsessed with you, that they would risk their death,” Kaden says.

“I told you. They think my wolf is dangerous.”

“You’re being moved to the mistress’s floor. It’s a heavily guarded floor.”

“I thought I was going to be Obsidian’s breeder.”

“You were, but you are no longer pure, so he’s decided you will become a mistress instead,” he says.

He leads me to my new room. As I walk through the mistress’s floor, I notice all the girls have dark hair and green eyes. I am the only girl with white hair.

“Does Obsidian have a preference for women?” I ask.

“The rumour mill is he prefers only girls with green eyes and dark hair, so the packs always send them to Obsidian as gifts.”

“Should I dye my hair black?”

“No, Amelia. You’re the most beautiful girl here. Don’t change a thing. If you have issues with jealousy, you inform me right away,” he demands.

“Okay,” I say.

My room is gorgeous, with wood floors, a massive bed, and expensive furnishings.

“This is your room now,” he says, leaving.

The door is metal and enforced. The windows all open and will make it easy for Athena to escape unseen during the blood moons.

Every time I step foot outside my room, the girls swarm me and call me ugly until I start to get a complex.

For weeks I wait, and he never comes to see me.

My favorite time in the morning is when Obsidian is done with his girls, and has a fresh shower, and walks by.

His scent is sweet musk and pine, and makes me feel like I’m standing in the middle of a forest.

I noticed him come out of Enya’s room naked, his body glistening, his torso sculpted like a Greek god. 

My mouth drools as I watch a wall of muscle walk down the hall without a care in the world. 

When our eyes meet, he scowls.

I duck back into my room

He swings open my door.

“Why are you sitting on the floor eating?” he growls.

“I needed some fresh air,” I smile.

“Then open a fucking window.”

“That’s not the fresh air I was referring to,” I say, taking him all in.

I was thinking of his musk and pine scent.

His lips turn into a slight smile.

“Do you think I’m ugly?” I ask. “The other girls think I’m ugly to you, and that’s why you never come to see me.”

“My mother picked you out for me when you were young, shortly before she died. I’m just disappointed to find out you were deflowered,” he says.

“Great, ugly and disappointing,” I pout.

“You are important to me, Amelia. I just need time, and I can’t promise I won’t kill him,” he says, leaning down and kissing my cheek.

My heart flutters, and he gives me a tight squeeze and leaves.

The longer I go without seeing the healers, the more the runes fade and the stronger Athena gets.

I’m pouring myself a glass of milk one morning, and one of the girls bumps into me. My glass shatters on the floor.

I bend down to clean it up, and the girl kicks me in the ass. I fall on the broken glass, face first, the glass cutting up my arms and face, and Athena loses it.

She dives on top of her, beating her until she’s unconscious. Obsidian walks in and finds me on top of her.

He pulls me off her and sees the glass stuck in me and loses it.

“I’m calling a healer,” he growls.

“No, no, please don’t.” I start ripping out the glass myself. 

“Stop that immediately,” he growls. “You’re going to scar your face.”

“Only if you promise not to send me a healer,” I plead.

He picks me up and carries me down the hall into a medical room and locks the door. 

Obsidian gives me a shot for pain and takes his time slowly pulling out the glass.

“Tell me exactly what happened and don’t lie,” he orders.

I give him the details of what happened, and his jaw clenches and his eyes narrow.

There’s a knock on the door, and I panic.

“It’s my Beta,” he says.

Kaden comes in and takes over, and Obsidian storms out.

I was enjoying our time together. I hope he’s not mad.

“He’s not mad at you,” Kaden says, like he’s reading my mind. “He’s angry one of the girls hurt you.”

“Then why did he leave?” I ask.

“He wants to take care of it personally to make sure it doesn’t happen again,” Kaden explains.

“He doesn’t even give me the time of day. I don’t think he really cares,” I mutter.

“Alpha Sebastian won’t stop calling to speak to you. Every time he calls, Obsidian loses it. You need to talk to Sebastian before he kills him.”

“How? I have no phone in my room.”

“Amelia, you have the run of the castle. We placed you here for your safety.”

“You said I was Obsidian mistress. Why would I have access to the whole castle?”

“Just accept that you do. Call your old Alpha as soon as we’re done.”

“When I’m done and my cuts are all dressed, Kaden takes me to the closest phone.”

“Alpha?”

“Amelia?”

“Yes.” I light up.

“Please come home to me,” he pleads.

“Obsidian knows you took my virginity. If you call again, he’s going to kill you. I was apparently promised to him when I was a child by my father,” I explain.

“You told him? I warned you not to tell anyone. You dumb bitch. I should never have touched you.” He slams down the phone.

‘Let me get out my pen, yup, he’s added to the list,’ Athena says.

“Don’t you dare hurt him,” I hiss at her.

‘Fine, I’ll put him on the maybe kill list. You shouldn’t allow a man you love to treat us that way,’ Athena grumbles.

I open the door, and Kaden is standing there.

“Did you listen in on my whole personal conversation?” I pretend to be angry and stomp off.

“Yes,” Kaden growls.

I head back to our kitchen to eat.

I sit down and pour myself a coffee and order lunch.

“Looks like Enya made an improvement on your ugly face,” Ella hisses.

“Fuck off,” I bark.

She suddenly backs off. “Your eyes are red! Only possessed souls and demons have red eyes.”

1quvgqn,https://www.reddit.com/r/micro_saas/comments/1quvgqn/i_built_an_ai_tool_saas_that_generates_custom/,I built an AI tool (SAAS) that generates custom vectors because I was tired of searching stock sites for hours,"Hey everyone!

I just launched Ve Craft and wanted to share it here.

The backstory:

I was working on a client project and needed a specific icon. Spent 2+ hours on Freepik, Flaticon, and other sites. Found nothing that fit. Had to compromise with something that looked ""meh.""
That frustration turned into Ve Craft.

What it does:

Simple - you describe what vector you need, AI generates it.

Examples:

""minimalist coffee cup icon for cafe website""
""professional team collaboration illustration""
""modern tech startup logo concept""

You get the vector, can edit it in the built-in editor, and export as PNG, SVG, or JPG.

Why I think it's useful:

✓ No more browsing 10 sites hoping to find the right graphic
✓ No expensive subscriptions for one-time needs
✓ Get exactly what you envision, not ""close enough""
✓ Saves hours of searching time

Who might find this helpful:

Web developers needing custom icons
Small business owners building sites
Designers on tight deadlines
Anyone tired of generic stock graphics
I'm still improving it and would love feedback from this community.

“I, Amelia Song, reject you, Sebastian Collins, as my mate.”

I wait for the pain, but nothing comes. Sebastian’s body trembles, and he passes out.

His beta, Chance, comes in, and the guards take Sebastian to the hospital.

Chance looks at me oddly and sits in Sebastian’s chair.

“The Dark Howlers pack has contacted us and requested you be sent to them.”

“I’m not a virgin. Only virgin girls can be tributes. Obsidian Knox will kill me,” I plead.

“Your sexual status is not my problem. You are no longer the mate of my Alpha. Pack your things. You will be picked up in an hour,” he says.

He opens the door and gestures for me to leave.

‘I will kill his Luna on my next hunt,’ Athena declares.

I sob as I pack my bags to leave.

I step outside and try to calm myself. Taking a deep breath, I slide down the brick wall and sit in the grass.

“I hate my life!” I yell to no one while tears fall down my cheeks. 

I rip out the grass blade by blade to try to make myself feel better.

I see a large SUV coming toward me in the distance, and I decide to ignore it.

When the SUV pulls up, a large, monstrous, attractive man steps out.

I don’t look up; I just continue ripping out the grass.

He picks me up, puts me in the back seat, and loads up my bags in the car.

‘I like him,’ Athena purrs.

I sit as far away from him as possible.

“Your father promised you as a breeder to my Alpha when you turned 19,” he says, playing with my curls and letting them spring back.

My eyes widen. 

I had no idea I was promised to Obsidian. 

Why would my father be so cruel?

Obsidian is the Alpha every pack fears.

He’s known for slaughtering entire packs over the smallest offenses.

Every few months, desperate packs send tributes to his territory to appease him.

“I’m Kaden, Obsidian’s Beta. I’ve been sent to assure you’re safely delivered.”

“Oh,” is all I manage to get out.

“Why were you not sent on your nineteenth birthday? Why are you covered in rune markings?” he says, delicately lifting my arms and looking me over.

I remain silent for the rest of the drive.

Kaden doesn’t push me for answers.



The vehicle pulls up to a large castle. The minute I step out, Kaden pulls me inside, and my brain feels like it’s going to melt down.

‘We’re not going to die. At most, he’ll send us to the dungeon, and we’ll escape tomorrow,’ Athena explains, calm as a cucumber.

Kaden takes me into a large office, gives me a bottle of water, and shuts the door.

I gulp the water down like it’s my last drink on earth.

The door swings open. A tall, dangerously handsome man with icy blue eyes and chin length black hair steps inside, his face void of emotion.

He sits in the chair in front of me and pulls me closer so our knees are touching.

“I’m going to ask you a few questions, and if you answer honestly, I will let you live. If you lie, then I will kill you instantly,” he warns.

“Did you know you were promised to me by your father?”

I shake my head. “My parents are dead,” I whisper.

His eyes widen. “Are you a virgin?”

I feel the air shift in the room. 

I hesitate, then shake my head. Obsidian loses it, trashing the office as I sit frozen in the chair.

He storms out of the room, and Kaden comes in and takes his place.

“How many men have you been with?” Kaden asks.

I hold up one finger.

“You’ve been with one person?” he says.

I nod.

“Who is this person?” Kaden asks.

I look down and don’t answer. I couldn’t bear it if someone hurt Sebastian.

“Do you want to die?” Kaden asks.

I shake my head.

“Then tell me who you slept with,” Kaden snarls.



Chapter 2

“The Cursed”

POV Amelia

Obsidian steps back into the office.

“The man you slept with. Do you love him?”

I nod slowly.

“Does he love you?” he asks.

I shake my head.

“Put her in the dungeon until I decide what to do with her,” Obsidian growls.

I stand up, and Kaden gently guides me out.

“Wait,” Obsidian says. “What do the runes drawn all over your skin mean?”

“The healers draw them on to protect the pack from my cursed wolf.”

He looks at me, perplexed, but doesn’t push further.

“Can you shift?” he asks.

“Sometimes, but not right now,” I say.

Kaden takes me to a cell in the dungeon and leaves.

I curl up on the cot.

I am not as weak as I appear. The healers have carved painful runes into my skin since I was a child to suppress my wolf. 

But the Blood Moon gives my cursed wolf enough power to shift and seek revenge on all who have hurt her, in her past lives and in the present.

Tomorrow is the Blood Moon.



I wake up to Obsidian shoving a drink down my throat.

“Drink it all,” he orders.

It tastes like blood and wine. 

I fight my stomach, trying not to bring it back up.

I feel the bond break from my old pack. An intense pain shoots through me, and I scream.

“You feel no pain,” Obsidian whispers, and the pain vanishes.

I feel the new bond to the Obsidian pack snap in place.

‘We officially belong to him now,’ Athena sings.

“Why is that such a good thing? He can still kill us,” I say to her.

Obsidian strokes my hair until I fall asleep.

I wake up in a locked room with open bay windows, and I’m six stories up.

I pour a bath with rose and lavender and melt into it.

“Amelia,” Kaden says, walking into the bathroom. 

I hide my body from him.

“You need not fear me. My job is to protect you. Tonight is the blood moon, when the demon wolf is on the hunt. No one is safe,” he says. “She has never been spotted in our pack, but Obsidian wants you safe just in case.”

I try not to laugh. It is my wolf that he is speaking of. I dare not tell him, or I’ll get thrown out of his pack.

“Holy fuck, is there not a part of you that’s not covered in runes?” he asks.

“It’s to protect you,” I smirk

“You’re such a tiny thing. I doubt your wolf could do much damage,” he chuckles.

“Can I get a little privacy, please?” I ask.

“Yes, of course, little wolf.” He smiles. “Rest assured, our pack is demon wolf proof. She will never get inside our fortress or anywhere near you.”

“There is nowhere she can sneak in?” I ask, for Athena.

“The backwoods, but they are haunted by witches. They would capture her and have her do their bidding,” he explains. “There is enough food on the nightstand to last the night. I’ll check on you in the morning.” 

The moment he’s gone, I wrap myself in a towel, climb into bed, and wait.

There is no point in dressing. The clothes would be destroyed when I shift.

The minute the sun goes down, I feel the raw power of the Blood Moon and fall into darkness.



I wake up the following morning on the bare floor, covered in blood.

My body is sore from head to toe from the rare shift and the damage did fighting all night, and I can barely move. 

I crawl to the shower, turn the water on as hot as possible, and let my sore muscles melt from the heat.

I scrub myself from head to toe until the evidence of last night is gone.

Athena is deep asleep.

I crawl back to my bed, wiping the blood off the floor with my hair towel and chuck it under the bed.

The moment I slide into the silk sheets, the door swings open, and an excited Kaden comes in.

He takes one look at me and looks concerned.

“Should I get the healer?” He asks.

Do I look exhausted?

“No healers. They only fear my wolf and cover me with more runes.”

“There’s no place to draw more runes,” he chuckles.

“They will find room. The process is painful. I just want them gone, but that takes time and no healers.”

“I understand. I just wanted you to know the demon wolf strolled through our village last night and out the gate and didn’t harm anyone here,” Kaden says.

“Oh, wow, really?”

I play along.

“Yeah, I guess the warriors were frozen in shock, and one of them just opened the gate and let her leave.”

“I’m glad no one was hurt,” I say.

“Some of the villagers saw her jump the wall this morning and disappear into the pack, which means she’s from our pack.” He grins from ear to ear.

“Does that mean you will seek her out and kill her?” I ask.

“No, we’re the most feared pack. Obsidian wants to find her and make her his wife,” Kaden chuckles.

I suddenly feel jealous of myself. Or perhaps he knows who I am and wants me to tell the truth so he can kill me?

“What packs did she attack?” I ask.

“Oh, I’m not sure if you want to hear this, but she killed half your pack members, including the Luna, then burned down most of the pack. It sounds like you left at the right time,” he says.

I hide the smile on my face with the blanket.

“That’s terrible news. I hope the Alpha and my family are okay.”

“The Alpha? Why would you care if the Alpha lived or died?” Kaden asks suspiciously.

“Um, well, without him, the pack would fall into chaos,” I say, hoping my feelings for him don’t show on my face.

“I will inquire about your family,” he says, leaving.

The moment he’s gone, I pass out from exhaustion and wake up to a healer and Obsidian in my room.

I dive away from the healer. “Don’t touch me,” I growl.

“You’ve been asleep since yesterday morning,” Obsidian says, concerned.

“Your runes are fading; you need more,” the healer says.

“I don’t want your runes! Stay away from me,” I hiss.

Obsidian looks between me and the healer. “She said no runes. If I find out you put more on her body, I will kill you myself,” he barks, and the healer runs out of the room.

“I’m here to tell you the demon wolf didn’t hurt anyone in your family, and the Alpha was injured trying to save the Luna, but he is fine. He enquired about you returning, and I said no,” Obsidian says.

My heart stops. He wants me back?

“If I find out it was the Alpha that took your virginity, I will kill him,” Obsidian growls, walking out of the room.

‘You’re so easy to read. Your feelings for Alpha Sebastian are written all over your face,’ Athena says.

“I hope he doesn’t hurt him.”

‘As long as he’s not stupid enough to show up here looking for you,’ Athena warns.

I crawl out of bed feeling stiff again.

I have a hot shower, and the minute I step back in the room, two healers are waiting for me. The door is locked and there is no escape.



Chapter 3

“The healers”

POV Amelia

I panic and lock myself in the bathroom, but they find a way in.

I crawl out the tiny bathroom window, and onto the ledge, completely naked, and try to follow the small ledge to the window in the next room.

The healer peers out the window, and one of them tries to follow me. 

A piece of the ledge gives way, and I almost tumble six stories. 

My body starts to tremble uncontrollably in fear, and I continue along, but I’m not able to open the next window.

The healer is closing in, and I’m about to keep moving along the ledge when I hear a scream.

The window suddenly opens behind me, someone yanks me in, and I scream at the top of my lungs. “Please don’t hurt me!”

It’s Kaden. He looks at me bewildered and steps out onto the ledge and tosses the healer off the ledge.

He grabs a sheet off the bed and wraps it around me. Giving me a tight squeeze.

“You’re safe, Amelia. I don’t understand why these healers are obsessed with you, that they would risk their death,” Kaden says.

“I told you. They think my wolf is dangerous.”

“You’re being moved to the mistress’s floor. It’s a heavily guarded floor.”

“I thought I was going to be Obsidian’s breeder.”

“You were, but you are no longer pure, so he’s decided you will become a mistress instead,” he says.

He leads me to my new room. As I walk through the mistress’s floor, I notice all the girls have dark hair and green eyes. I am the only girl with white hair.

“Does Obsidian have a preference for women?” I ask.

“The rumour mill is he prefers only girls with green eyes and dark hair, so the packs always send them to Obsidian as gifts.”

“Should I dye my hair black?”

“No, Amelia. You’re the most beautiful girl here. Don’t change a thing. If you have issues with jealousy, you inform me right away,” he demands.

“Okay,” I say.

My room is gorgeous, with wood floors, a massive bed, and expensive furnishings.

“This is your room now,” he says, leaving.

The door is metal and enforced. The windows all open and will make it easy for Athena to escape unseen during the blood moons.

Every time I step foot outside my room, the girls swarm me and call me ugly until I start to get a complex.

For weeks I wait, and he never comes to see me.

My favorite time in the morning is when Obsidian is done with his girls, and has a fresh shower, and walks by.

His scent is sweet musk and pine, and makes me feel like I’m standing in the middle of a forest.

I noticed him come out of Enya’s room naked, his body glistening, his torso sculpted like a Greek god. 

My mouth drools as I watch a wall of muscle walk down the hall without a care in the world. 

When our eyes meet, he scowls.

I duck back into my room

He swings open my door.

“Why are you sitting on the floor eating?” he growls.

“I needed some fresh air,” I smile.

“Then open a fucking window.”

“That’s not the fresh air I was referring to,” I say, taking him all in.

I was thinking of his musk and pine scent.

His lips turn into a slight smile.

“Do you think I’m ugly?” I ask. “The other girls think I’m ugly to you, and that’s why you never come to see me.”

“My mother picked you out for me when you were young, shortly before she died. I’m just disappointed to find out you were deflowered,” he says.

“Great, ugly and disappointing,” I pout.

“You are important to me, Amelia. I just need time, and I can’t promise I won’t kill him,” he says, leaning down and kissing my cheek.

My heart flutters, and he gives me a tight squeeze and leaves.

The longer I go without seeing the healers, the more the runes fade and the stronger Athena gets.

I’m pouring myself a glass of milk one morning, and one of the girls bumps into me. My glass shatters on the floor.

I bend down to clean it up, and the girl kicks me in the ass. I fall on the broken glass, face first, the glass cutting up my arms and face, and Athena loses it.

She dives on top of her, beating her until she’s unconscious. Obsidian walks in and finds me on top of her.

He pulls me off her and sees the glass stuck in me and loses it.

“I’m calling a healer,” he growls.

“No, no, please don’t.” I start ripping out the glass myself. 

“Stop that immediately,” he growls. “You’re going to scar your face.”

“Only if you promise not to send me a healer,” I plead.

He picks me up and carries me down the hall into a medical room and locks the door. 

Obsidian gives me a shot for pain and takes his time slowly pulling out the glass.

“Tell me exactly what happened and don’t lie,” he orders.

I give him the details of what happened, and his jaw clenches and his eyes narrow.

There’s a knock on the door, and I panic.

“It’s my Beta,” he says.

Kaden comes in and takes over, and Obsidian storms out.

I was enjoying our time together. I hope he’s not mad.

“He’s not mad at you,” Kaden says, like he’s reading my mind. “He’s angry one of the girls hurt you.”

“Then why did he leave?” I ask.

“He wants to take care of it personally to make sure it doesn’t happen again,” Kaden explains.

“He doesn’t even give me the time of day. I don’t think he really cares,” I mutter.

“Alpha Sebastian won’t stop calling to speak to you. Every time he calls, Obsidian loses it. You need to talk to Sebastian before he kills him.”

“How? I have no phone in my room.”

“Amelia, you have the run of the castle. We placed you here for your safety.”

“You said I was Obsidian mistress. Why would I have access to the whole castle?”

“Just accept that you do. Call your old Alpha as soon as we’re done.”

“When I’m done and my cuts are all dressed, Kaden takes me to the closest phone.”

“Alpha?”

“Amelia?”

“Yes.” I light up.

“Please come home to me,” he pleads.

“Obsidian knows you took my virginity. If you call again, he’s going to kill you. I was apparently promised to him when I was a child by my father,” I explain.

“You told him? I warned you not to tell anyone. You dumb bitch. I should never have touched you.” He slams down the phone.

‘Let me get out my pen, yup, he’s added to the list,’ Athena says.

“Don’t you dare hurt him,” I hiss at her.

‘Fine, I’ll put him on the maybe kill list. You shouldn’t allow a man you love to treat us that way,’ Athena grumbles.

I open the door, and Kaden is standing there.

“Did you listen in on my whole personal conversation?” I pretend to be angry and stomp off.

“Yes,” Kaden growls.

I head back to our kitchen to eat.

I sit down and pour myself a coffee and order lunch.

“Looks like Enya made an improvement on your ugly face,” Ella hisses.

“Fuck off,” I bark.

She suddenly backs off. “Your eyes are red! Only possessed souls and demons have red eyes.”

1quveex,https://www.reddit.com/r/NannyBreakRoom/comments/1quveex/outings_with_mb_every_day/,Outings with MB every day,"MB recently started worrying about her bond with her kid. She’s never spent more than 30 mins with the baby since she was born (now 1,5 years old), and now the baby explicitly expresses that she doesn’t want to play with her mom (NF has 24/7 childcare, including me and other nannies and sitters). 

So MB came up with the idea to go to new places every morning with NK and me so she can improve her bind with NK and it’s killing me. MB is one of the worst people I’ve ever met in my life. She’s rude, egocentric and inconsiderate. During the outings she doesn’t care about NK but instead she’s constantly talking to me like we are BFFs. She is gossiping about everyone she knows, sharing details about her personal life and it’s tiring. I know everything about this woman though she’s never even asked how I was or anything. She’s only nice to me when she wants something like staying overtime or come in my off day. 

I don’t even know why she needs me on the outings, my best guess is that she is bored. She doesn’t even let me push the stroller “because she is the mom”. So I’m like just there listening to stories about her exes, her sex life (yes…), her birthing story for the 32nd time (sorry but I don’t care how many stitches you got after and how much blood was there). 

The other thing is that she is totally inconsiderate about NK as well. She doesn’t care about her schedule or nap time. She takes forever to get ready in the morning, and it’s usually after 10:30 when we can finally leave the house, but NK usually has lunch at 12 and nap at 12:30. So we get to a cafe, playground or something after 11 and the whole day is ruined. We get home too late, baby is usually too tired to eat so I put her down for her nap hungry, and she is so overtired that it takes forever to get her to sleep and then she is up after an hour. And obviously the afternoon is a chaos. Not to mention that my only break is naptime during my 12 hour shift and I do baby related stuff during this time too so sometimes I only get 30 mins to eat my lunch and relax a bit. And even though MB is a SAHM she never offers to take over the kid for even 10 mins. She is hanging around us all day literally doing nothing but whenever I ask her to please take over the baby so I can grab a few bites or drink a coffee real quick she suddenly becomes super busy. 

Yesterday we got home at 13:30, skipped lunch again, and baby fell asleep at 14:10 (!). She slept until 15:00 and obviously she was super fussy the whole afternoon and I realized the I’m getting really impatient with NK because of exhaustion even though nothing is her fault. MB was sitting on the couch and I asked if I can take a short break because I’m exhausted. She laughed at me  and basically told me that I can’t be tired because I’m not a mom and she can’t take care of the baby right now because she needs her “me time” as mom life is too stressful and tiring. 

I have so many other problems with this NF (especially MB) and I’m  looking for another job but I’m currently stuck here and I’m so burnt out and exhausted.  😩 ",5,1770133558.0,NannyBreakRoom,3,0.86,False

The menu was honestly all over the place lol. Like you've got Gunpowder Rice next to Paratha Taco, Vietnamese Iced Coffee next to Adrak Chai. Someone ordered a UFO Burger, someone got an Egg Sando, and of course, the Gen Z intern got some Matcha..

What was weird is everything actually worked? Like the fusion-y stuff people ordered was actually good. And it showed up in 12 minutes flat which saved us because we were starving after the all-hands meeting.

Anyway, just wanted to share the small win with this community. We're nowhere close to done but hitting this milestone felt really good. Back to building tomorrow but today we're just vibing.

1quvakt,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwentiesIndia/comments/1quvakt/want_some_random_tea_i_also_hate_her_btw/,Want some random tea? I also hate her btw,"So there's this girl in my college, let's call her suar(i don't like her at all, idc). 

So suar on the first day, induction tha and after that, a few of us were hanging out in the cafeteria including her, she spots a group of seniors sitting a few tables away(this is like a group full of boys approx 8 of them, not saying they are bad ppl but come on you don't go to random guys who could have any sort of personality, don't hate me for saying this) 

and out of nowhere she approaches them and says ""guys aap logo ko humein party deni chahiye kyunki hum aapke juniors hai"", they are all caught off guard and one of them replies with ""freshers hoga n tab milegi treat"", i don't kid you😭, girl just sits among them points to our table and says ""but hum sabko abhi chahiye"". Girllllll when did we decide this, kaun hai ye hum. And then she's laughing with them being touchy (I won't elaborate on that, I'm scared of hate) whatever and eventually the guys do order cold coffees for us and uske liye some other food items as well.

Later on, unfortunately this girl was in the same friend group as mine, but like it was big group so i didn't pay much attention to her, I was like I'll maintain a distance because I am not fond of her tendencies.

The tendencies: 
She'll never pay her share whenever we go out, makes others pay for her(mostly guys), will act like a pick me infront of the other girls' crushes or bfs, will make reels in the middle of the cafeteria during rush hours and blame the other person for bumping into her

Another thing is, in our group there was a guy in our group who was bullied heavily when he was in school due his looks so he's quite introverted but a sweet guy. So this girl literally makes fun of his looks or saying shit like he can't pull (and i get that friends joke all the time but she crossed boundaries and keeps pushing it unnecessarily), he laughs it off almost everytime.

And then she acts all childish and cute and says she doens't use curse words she's so nice (that's fine a lot of ppl don't but it also doens't automatically place them above others) butttt iss suar ne faculty ke 10 foot ke radius mei zor zor se gandi gaaliyan di hai while talking about random shit and she also searches up gaalis in ppl's native languages to curse them but then will act cute.

And the guy from our grp who was bullied, uske saath toh ye gaali wala treatment is a normal occurence and she'll make him pay for food because he can be intimidated easily, then she'll act cute ki ""mai grp mei sabse choti hu n you guys, you guys should pamper me"", and then ye suar zabardasti usko bolegi ki mujhe ghar drop karde because she can't drive(karti hoti toh accident karti pakka), and even if he denies she'll just sit on his bike and be like ""tere ghar ke raaste mei hi hai, chal n"". Wtf dude.

And ek din ye suar, auto se aai thi, uska fare 40 hua tha and again isko pay nahi karna tha but sadly uss din bakra nahi mila but omg 😭 isne 50 ka note diya, and uncle ke paas 10 ka change nahi tha 20 tha so he was like beta 10 rupees aur do and I'll give you 20, iss suar ko 10 mins yahi samajhne mei lag gaye, how are such ppl going to be functioning adults and be a part of the economy.

Then navratri ke wakt, ek din she came wearing wide legged jeans and the top it barely reached her underbust and backless aur full sleeves the (see it's great, express yourself with clothes but jagah toh dekh lo) and then some faculty dresscoded her so she's like ""don't inform my parents, unko pata chala toh I'll be done for"" rona dhona and then she was told ki go home, wear appropriate clothes and attendance lagao, usmei bhi kehti ""my parents will kill me if they know ki mujhe wapas bheja gaya hai"" 

And then faculty is like ""atleast cover up"", ab in my city it doens't exactly get cold so nobody had anything to cover up so she looks at me and asks me to get her a jacket from my place since I lived nearby, this is the same woman who takes clothes from girls who have bought something for themselves and iss suar ko unse pehle use karne hai unke kapde. I unfortunately did end up giving it to her cauz bura laga tha in that moment but that didn't last long

The audacity of this bitch, isne Mera jacket 2 months ke liye wapas nahi kiya, ek toh itne baar gayab rehti thi(ye bhi reason batati hu) and then har baar bhul jaati thi kaise bhai, apne kapde ke liye mujhe itna bheekh maangna pada iss suar se and i did see her camera roll once within those two months and  mera jacket pehenke ghum Rahi hai and photos click kar rahi hai. And jab return Kiya bhi tab the audacity to not even wash it, like who does that!????

And ye suar ye bhi karti hai ki whenever someone shares ki you know I was making out with my bf or we had sex (girls ka chit chat and whatever) she'll act like ki kya hi taboo topic chal raha hai and she's a pristine virgin, it's good thik hai bhai hai tu lekin why are you looking down on others, it's not like they are cheating or not even ki unka body count is very high(mostly 1)  it's their very own partner upar se that also long term but she'll just act weird.

She also flexes rejecting and humiliating a guy infront of her whole school. How is that okay!??? And Tbh I have never seen any guy slide into her dms or approach her (while it's a very common occurrence in our college for many girls) but ye suar phirbhi alag ego mei rehti hai


And to top it all off, ye jo banti hai ki virgin hai ye, never had a bf and whatever, ye college bunk karke jaati hai apne ""male bestfriend"" ke saath and she's always gloating about how rich he is and he came to get her in his car and gifted her this and that, and thik hai ye bhi but the thing is it seems like she's with him only for his money. Oh also did i mention that ppl speculate that she has lost her v card to him, oh and that he's only 6 years older than her (the hypocrisy my god)

She lectures us all whenever we bunk to hangout as a group but it's fine when she goes with her male bsf, She'll never get her assignments done on time, attendance so low, exams mei marks kam. Jab assignment due hoga usse 1-2 ghante pehle bhi log cafeteria mei baith ke likh rahe hote hai that time also iska cute banna chalta rehta hai or reels dekhna ya banana and then jab due hojayega and everyone is submitting she'll be like you guys don't wait for me and wapas rona dhona.

Feels better venting it out, ik it's too long hehe

This was entirely built off facebook marketplace. I had older klipsch stuff i got for cheap that I slowly replaced unit but unit but the surrounds obviously. The Denon is brand new tho. I was looking to get a matching Center channel as the G-28 was a big upgrade from the C-2 but now the LR outpace it with their recent upgrade.

I have been wanting to get into DIY speakers. 

Would the unmatched Timbre matter? I feel like its a big enough increase in quality it'll just sound nice with EQ. 

I know I need to raise the G-28 regardless and the G-28 is a great speaker in itself to be fair. Just no depth as its a flat panel. And yes its a 20lb sack of beans on the ML sub. It just works. After A1 evo Express I REALLY like my sound for the $ paid",2,1770133229.0,hometheater,0,1.0,False

When I moved in first I introduced myself and we had a brief but nice chat. I invited him in for coffee and he said another time. 

I heard that he is shy and unassuming from others. I developed a big crush on him. We both are single and I see him on the dating apps. I can see we have similiar interests and we seem to have similiar backgrounds. He never swiped on me as I would be notified (hinge). I didn't swipe on him in the hope something could happen irl. 

Once after he paid someone to paint his fence I painted mine. A few weeks later he changed his hinge prompt to he was 'looking for someone who liked painting garden fences'. But within a few hours when I was debating whether this was a hint to me or not he had changed it.

I tried to bump into him so many times but it never worked. He always waves if we pass in the car. He comes home late at night usually 11pm and leaves later for work than me. There was a few weeks where we seemed to be leaving for work at the same time and even then I would miss him often by seconds and he would just wave as he drove away. 

I asked him for help once moving furniture, he was helpful and polite but when I asked him if he wanted a coffee after he declined (but it was like 10pm at night). 

I know its silly to say but when I requested to follow him on Instagram. He took about 6 weeks to follow me back and then views my stories but does not like my posts. I can see we have a mutual contact and I can see he likes every post of hers straight away.

I think I tried to convince myself he is shy and took the fence comment as a hidden message to me. But my friends say he has given no indication he is interested and to move on. Are they right?​

---

My little one is turning 7 months and I realized had I read an experience like mine in advance I would have been better prepared mentally. I think my journey is best experienced in a timeline.

**Day 2:** My first real memory is night 2 at home, holding a screaming baby for 3 hours convinced something had to be wrong. I was trying to let my wife sleep but at some point I just hit a breaking point and had to get her. We were calling local hospitals and no one wanted to help us unless we brought her in, ultimately we decided to bring her to her pediatrician in the morning. This was a sign of things to come.

**Day 3-5:** Mostly a blur, but I don't think any moment she was awake she wasn't crying. We tried alternating sleeping schedules but at best we maybe got 3-4 hours of sleep each. The only thing that calmed her down was breast feeding but it was VERY short lived. We combo fed due to production issues. My wife did her best.

**Week 1-2:** It was around now we were told something wasn't normal and we had to make changes. As new parents you just assume what you're going through is okay unless something is OBVIOUSLY wrong. For us, the constant crying, lack of her ever napping (I think not once by now) should have been a tip off. The doctor had us try a new formula.

**Week 2-3:** The new formula did not help at all. We quickly were told to try more allergy friendly formulas but we were close to our wits end. We never slept, she never stopped crying, and we just mentally had nothing in the tank. We were constantly talking with our doctor who assured us everything was normal but our friends and family were insistent it wasn't. I would say our mental strength was at a solid 2 out of 10 here, cannot be understated how broken we felt.

**Month 1:** Sadly nothing improved, if anything it got worse. She wasn't reacting well to any formula but her crying got louder. She'd scream like wolves were tearing her apart all day. Our only breaks were when she was breast feeding, which meant I only ever held a crying baby. Worth noting because she never napped she did get a reasonable amount of sleep at night but it would take about 2 hours to put her down. We were hospitalized for a night as she was turning blue around the mouth when eating. We came to learn this was linked to acid reflux.

**Month 2:** I had returned to work after a month but had to take frequent breaks from my WFH job to help my wife. The low point happened around here where we tried a formula brand that can be found at every store and highly recommended by doctors (not naming names as our experience is not normal). She would scream she was hungry all day but never get full. Spitting up 10+ times wasn't unheard of after a feed. The weekend we tried this was easily the worst weekend of my life, it was worse then when my dad died.

We eventually settled on a formula she was seem to get full from. To this day we still use this formuila. At the time we were still at a 3 or so out of 10 mental state as the bloody murder screaming never stopped. Our friends and family who would do anything to help us started telling us something has to be wrong with her as it wasn't normal for a baby to be like this. We begged our doctors (of which we saw numerous specialists) to help us and no one found anything wrong, she was just colic. 

I don't know the exact day but it was definitely between month 2 and 3 but we were at speech therapy and she looked us in the eyes and said I can't help you. If this were my daughter I would take her to the ER because something is clearly wrong. Finally we were heard, a doctor saw what we were going through and admitted it wasn't normal. We obviously went straight to the ER eager to have validation. We waited no time at all given the circumstance, but we were extremely disappointed (is that the right word?) to find out everything, and I mean everything, was normal. The ER doctor showed us the X-Ray and in that moment we learned why our baby was always crying. I remember looking at the doctor asking what we were looking at as I saw nothing, and she just said everything you see is gas. Your baby has nothing but gas in her stomach and intestines. This was horrible to find out. We were already maxing out her gas drops (every 2 hours 12 hours a day). The had us go home advising us there was nothing we could do but hopefully by 6 months she would just grow out of it.

**Month 3**: Some improvement. She would occasionally nap now but it would only be contact and only for 30 minutes at most. There were some happy moments, we lived for these. She started smiling and acknowledging us as the reason. We had no way to know we were only 1 month out of freedom. To counter act this, the bad moments were getting worse. The older she got the louder she got and the more heartbreaking it sounded. Anyone who tried baby sitting her came to the same conclusion, they felt helpless. We all did.

We starting the search for a Nanny. We determined this was barely in our budget but considering how colic she was likely our best option. Thankful we did as the daycares in our area went 1 year+ just after she would have joined. We ended up finding a young women who was very experienced with colic children and she has been a god send (and still is).

**Month 4**: I know the updates are all over the place but the truth is the most important part is how we got here. Life of a crying baby became normal. My wife was going back to work soon which meant nights I'd be alone and this horrified me, when would I sleep? Because of this imminent change it meant breastfeeding would not longer but possible around the clock and while her job would technically allow her to it would eat her entire break so we made the decision to stop breastfeeding. And let me tell you, thank god we did. Within a week ALL of her colic symptoms went away, and I mean ALL of them. It turns out it was something my wife had been eating, my best guess is coffee (one cup per day, doctor approved).

Fast forward to 7 months life is amazing. Months 5 and 6 were constant improvements and she's happy. We had always considered switching to formula but my wife really wanted to be a trooper. I know I'm not out of the woods, far from it, but the light at the end of the tunnel was real. If you're reading this and not believing that, I was you, I didn't believe, but I was wrong and thank goodness I was.",3,1770133034.0,NewParents,3,1.0,False

We talked for about a week and honestly he seemed normal. Funny, polite, consistent. Not overly flirty, not weird, not one of those guys who sends one-word replies and disappears for 2 days. So when he asked me out for dinner, I said yes.

We picked a casual restaurant. Not expensive, not too formal. Just something easy for a first date. I got there first, grabbed a table and waited.

About 10 minutes later, Mark walks in. But he is not alone. He comes in with another guy around the same age. His friend.

At first I thought maybe they ran into each other outside and the friend was just walking in with him, like they were about to split up.

Nope.

The friend sits down. Right across from me. Mark smiles like everything is normal and goes, Oh yeah, this is my friend Josh. He was bored so I brought him.

I just stared at him.

I genuinely thought he was joking. Like maybe Josh would leave after saying hi.

But then Josh starts talking. Asking me where I’m from. What I do for work. If I date a lot. Like he is interviewing me too. I was so uncomfortable. It felt like I was being watched. I tried to keep it polite, but my brain was screaming. This was supposed to be a date. Not a group hangout. Not a test. Not some weird two on one situation where I’m the entertainment.

So I asked Mark, quietly, why did you bring him?

Mark laughed and said he did not want it to be awkward. Which made no sense because now it was ten times more awkward. I told him I came here to meet him, not his friend, and I was not comfortable with this. Mark immediately got defensive and said Josh is basically like his brother and I should not be acting like it is a big deal. Then Josh jumps in and says, Yeah, chill. It’s just dinner.

That annoyed me even more, because now I’m being told to chill by the random guy I did not even agree to meet. So I stood up, put cash down for my drink, and said I’m leaving. Mark looked shocked and said I was being rude and dramatic. He said I embarrassed him and made it seem like he did something wrong.

I told him he did do something wrong. He changed the whole plan without telling me and put me in an uncomfortable situation. As I walked out, Josh literally laughed and said, Guess she can’t hang.

Now Mark has been texting me saying I overreacted, that his friend was only there because he gets nervous on first dates, and that I could have at least stayed and been nice. But I feel like I’m not crazy for thinking this is weird.

If he was nervous, he could have told me beforehand. Or chosen a less intense date or met in public for coffee or anything other than surprising me with an extra person.

1quv48a,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1quv48a,[UNCOMPILED DESTINY] - Chapter 1 - LitRPG / GameDev Isekai,"My name is Muhammed. But in the digital world, I go by “**Attila**“. I’m a 20-year-old Digital Game Design student from Istanbul, struggling with finals and exhausted from carrying coffee as an intern. Or rather... I *was*.

It all started when I clicked on that damn “Project: Nexus” file. The project the company shelved because it was “too realistic,” pushing the limits of virtual reality engines. I only wanted to inspect the code—not be compiled and thrown inside it.

Where I am now is a broken universe, filled with the “junk” files of that project. You know that feeling when you fall through the map in a game? This is the physical, flesh-and-bone version of that.

The cold hard truth? It actually hurts. The scratch on my left arm is throbbing. This might be a simulation, but my nerve endings claim otherwise. Worse yet; dying here isn’t an escape. The “Respawn” mechanic is looping like a broken record. An endless cycle of life and death.

**And me?**

* **Stats:** 0
* **Armor:** None
* **Weapon:** None
* **Class:** Undefined

Normally, I’d spend hours on the character creation screen, but the system spat me out as a “**Default NPC**“—a total nobody.

The three goblins in front of me approach, growling. Their skin texture is so detailed I can see the blackheads on their noses. This must be Unreal Engine 50 or something. The one in the middle swings a rusty machete, muttering something. His AI is simple: “See, attack, loot.”

I can’t run. My Agility (AGI) is likely at base level. I can’t fight. My Strength (STR) is probably barely enough to lift a tea bag. I have only one shot: Charisma and Intelligence.

If I know the code of this universe, every AI has an “interaction” loop. If I give the right “input,” I can cancel the attack code and trigger a dialogue tree.

I took a deep breath. I locked my eyes onto the goblin’s yellow, bloodshot gaze. I suppressed my fear and stood tall, as if I were the **GM** (Game Master) of this world.

I raised my hand slowly—an authoritative gesture, but not a threatening one.

“Stop!” I said, making my voice as deep and resonant as possible. “If you touch me with that rusty metal, you will never find the treasure your master promised you, Scavenger.”

I was bluffing. The biggest bluff of my life. But if I can hype up a 0/10 Yasuo in League of Legends to turn a match around, I can manipulate these three green runts too.

The goblin hesitated. His head tilted slightly. That’s it! *Processing...* The attack animation was canceled.



The dialogue window is about to open.

Whats that game called that sed both hands and a string to weave sings? 



It's just a train of thought chugging along and all it take to run is your presence; let the conductor handle the rest. Your mind layed to rest, peacfefully, and ~~I'll handle the rest~~, I'll tell you the next             step.

Back to the net, ""he he,"" the train has been caught but it wasn't a wreck. You'd hope it was tragic like everyone else, just like the rest...

I'm weaving even if its point blank I have no point to make it isn't for my sake that I got ""it"" and your there blank faced...

Haven't finished the first cup and sadly (im)(your) worried bout the next..

Everything is fine.,"My crosspost from another sub got deleted. I guess there's a 24 hour ""cool down"" between posts. No hate to the mods, they're being fair. 

I’m writing this from the hospital. I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I don’t know if it was the electric shock or the drugs, but I have to tell someone about this. It wasn’t a dream. My brain is still super scattered from the pain meds from my “incident”, and the hospital has given me a bunch of stuff as well. I’m going to try and explain what happened as best as I can remember. I need someone, anyone, to know that this wasn’t a dream.

Last night, I got a call to tow a truck that didn’t exist. Or at least, I couldn’t find it. The dispatcher gave me coordinates, which was super weird, but I could not find this stupid truck. I gave up and started driving back to the shop, but the pain meds made me black out for a second, and I had a weird dream, then I went to sleep in the sleeper cab. I thought I passed out on the side of the highway, but when I woke up this morning, I was only about 10 miles from the shop. I got woken up by a cop who was banging on the door.

Ok, I’ve rewrote this next part over and over again, but I think I need to just tell it how I saw it.

So, last night, when I thought I blacked out, I don’t think I actually did. I was driving down the highway, and the lights did go all weird and shiny and the road started to like, shift, between being a gravel trail, open desert, asphalt, and this weird metal-looking material. It kept changing where it was going, sometimes it was straight, sometimes it curved left or right or split into a ""y"", or an intersection or something else. But it was all of those things at once. I kept driving because I knew I was close to my exit, but the street signs were all jumbled. The road names and exit numbers were scrambled together, and sometimes the sign was old, sometimes it looked brand new, and sometimes it looked like it was floating or hovering. But they were all overlaid on top of each other. I know, I feel insane just typing this. I didn’t want to stop, I just wanted to get back to the shop and go home. The GPS was glitching out and going crazy, like it had loaded a bunch of different maps all on top of each other. I still didn’t have cell signal, so I couldn’t use maps on my phone. But I knew I was close, I just had to get home.

I drove for what felt like way longer than it should’ve been, and then the fuel light came on on the dash. I thought the truck was full when I left the shop, but I guess I misread the gauge. I knew I was close to home, but I didn’t want to run the truck out of fuel. I didn’t want to be stuck here. I just wanted to get home. I drove until I was scared the truck was going to die, then I picked a random exit and pulled over. I thought I’d driven off the road at first, because the ground disappeared for a second and turned into straight dirt. I saw a little town just down the road and drove to it. I don’t remember the name of the town. The sign was all mixed up and the words were running together. But there was a gas station not too far from the freeway, so I pulled in there. My head was killing me, so I took one more pain pill just to take the edge off. I just needed to get fuel so I could get home.

I’ve never been on a drug trip or high before, but it was making everything look like it was moving in slow motion, like one of those scenes in a movie where everybody is moving around, and you can see the path of where they are going and where they came from. I didn’t want anyone to think I was out of it and call the cops, so I tried to look as normal as I could. I got the truck pulled up to the pump without hitting anything. Thankfully the company credit card actually worked there. A lot of times, in smaller towns, they won’t take the card and then you have to find another gas station. Luckily, they took the company card here, so I was able to fill up. I needed a receipt, but it wouldn’t print out at the pump, I had to go inside.

I just put my head down and tried to walk without falling over. I kept bumping into people, and I know they thought I was crazy, but it was like I could only see them out of the corners of my eye. If this is what a drug trip feels like, I’m never getting high again. So, I know you’re not supposed to buy anything else but gas with the company card, but I was desperate. I’d kicked caffeine since I puked the other day, but I could barely keep my eyes open, and it felt like I was going to pass out at any moment. I bought two energy drinks, chugged one before I even got to the counter. So, I get up to the counter, and the cashier looks like he’s moving in fast forward. He’s working the register, grabbing cigarettes, sweeping the floor, like he was doing a hundred things at once. I didn’t want to interrupt, but I finally asked him for the receipt. He printed it and held it out, but I guess I was moving super slow because he just dropped it on the counter and went back to whatever he was doing. I wish I could get the security camera footage from the gas station because I probably looked like a meth zombie or something.

I just needed to get home. I don’t know what it was about the freeway, or maybe it was just because the lights are brighter there than they were in town, they kept giving me a really bad headache. I took two more of the pain pills so I could see straight. By the time I finally got back to the shop, my watch said that it’d been about six hours since I left the shop. I burned through another tank of fuel somehow. I probably drove the truck all the way back in the first box or something. Anyway, so I parked the truck and walked back to my apartment. I didn’t even want to try and ride my bike.  I barely remember making it home, I was in a complete daze. I think I fell asleep on my couch. I don’t really remember anything after I parked the truck and started walking home.

I woke up in the sleeper cab of the tow truck. A cop was banging on the driver’s side door and yelling. I opened the door and totally expected him to drag me out of the cab. He didn’t, though. He just looked at me, like I haven’t ever seen anyone look at me before. Like he was scared, but not for himself. I don’t know how to explain it. I wasn’t on the side of the freeway, though, where I thought I fell asleep. I was down the street from the shop, maybe a couple miles. Anyway, the cop called an ambulance for me, even though I tried to deny treatment, or whatever it’s called. 

He called an ambulance anyway. The rest of this happened in a swirly daze. I think I was coming down off the pain meds. He kept asking me questions, but I don’t remember any of them. I don’t remember if I answered or now. I remember being lifted onto a stretcher, then I blacked out again. I woke up in the hospital. The doctors told me that it looked like I’d been awake for almost three days. It kinda felt like it. I had the worse case of cotton mouth and I was so hungry. They wouldn’t let me eat, though. They needed to do a ton of scans and take a lot of blood, and I guess you have to do that on an empty stomach. I’m so fucking hungry.

I think I heard the cop tell the doctor about the pills. I had to pee in a cup, and I’m pretty sure they only do that if they’re testing for drugs. I’m pretty sure everything else they can just use blood. My prescription is at home, but I know they’ll see it in the system. I’m pretty sure I’m not going to get in trouble, even if I pop for them, because I’m not taking anything other than what they gave me. They said that everything points to an accelerated heart rate and a heightened metabolism. They said that high caffeine can make you super dehydrated. I forgot that I’d drank a bunch of coffee before I left home, and I drank one of those little energy bottle things on my way to the shop. They said that much caffeine plus the kind of pain meds they have me on can make you have super lucid dreams, and make your body go into overdrive. 

I don’t know. I don’t know why I fell asleep on the side of the highway and woke up next to the shop. I know you can blackout from alcohol, but you’re still awake. Your brain just doesn’t remember what you did. Can pain meds make you do that? Did I try to drive the truck home and almost made it? I really hope I don’t get a DUI. I just gotta do that interview next week. Or this week, I think. I gotta check my calendar. But I think it’s next week. I just need to nail that interview. Working almost every night can’t be healthy. 

I'm going to be ""under observation"" for the rest of the day, but I think they'll let me out tomorrow. ",3,1770132825.0,CreepCast_Submissions,0,1.0,False

Two months since we last talked, I finally went to meet the moon again.
In the dark night I looked up and the moon wasn't up in heaven.
Saddened, I turned back and walked away--
another thing of beauty that did not come my way.

I had known her for a few months,
three to be exact-- before we opened ourselves
to each other, and our acquaintance was made.
To me, it was a story, of fairies and elves.

The first time I saw her
with my longing eyes
a face that comes around
once in a million lifetimes.

Hair that stuck out in a crowd,
clothes that were a bit different than the rest.
I went up to her and said ""hi""-- the bravest thing I'd ever done.
Behind her glasses-- her mysterious eyes, were hidden from me.
I hoped we would be friends then,
that we could be one.

The first date, she accepted an offer-- that wasn't made to her
Enchanted and mesmerized, oblige I did.
We met in the winter evening, she had no sweater on.
We walked a lot, our byes we then bid.

The second time we met, I wore the same sweater--
my favourite; she still had no sweater on.
""Do you not feel cold?"" ""No, not at all""
Walk a lot we did again.
""Let's take fewer steps the next time""
and then she was gone.

Came around the third time,
we sat together.
She insisted to sit beside me,
and I let her.
For the first time in the short span--
that we'd been friends
her and I disagreed.
After a few quiet moments,
I took off her glasses.
Behind them, all this while, had been
the most magical pair of eyes--
I had ever seen.

She introduced me to her friends
on the fourth date
as her new-found companion,
with similar behaviour and taste.
And when her friends left us alone,
we stayed still--
sipping our coffee occasionally,
a rogue word here and there
breaking the silence, momentarily.

They say
""comfortable silences are better than
exhausting conversations--
they prove a real connection.""
I felt quite comfortable in our quietness.

Although it was unknown to me at the time--
the fifth date would be the last.
I believe even I knew in the moment,
I would not change what's past.

Reflecting on it later
it seems as if she knew beforehand--
perhaps she had made up her mind already--
it would be the last time we met.

We were both early
that afternoon
we talked and whispered
and giggled and laughed.
The sun went down, and the air was bold.
Before she left she wrapped her arms
around my back--
an embrace so comforting and warm,
pulling away ever so slowly--
and whispering ""so long"".

In the night, in my home
I received her message--
""Thank you for hanging out"" it read.
""The pleasure was all mine"", I said.
Echoes this thought,
in the back of my head--
was she grateful because
she knew it was the end?

It is all over now,
our rendezvous.
It had been two months and a half,
since I saw her last.
I sighted her today
where we used to meet,
she is still the beautiful girl she was,
though things have changed a bit.

And in the night sky
I look up again.
There she is-- the moon
bright, strong, optimistic as ever.
Maybe she always was here--
in my heart--
I just could not see her.
Perhaps it is a testament to my love--
it exists,
even in her dearth.",2,1770132664.0,IndianTeenagers,1,1.0,False

I’m not into the performative formal date vibe, the roster nonsense, or anything that feels like a game. I just want something slow, simple, and real.

I’m not really a big going-out person. I connect best with real conversation, consistent effort, and actually building something over time.

My ideal relationship is being each other’s person. Calling, texting, sharing every small detail we find interesting, sending random stuff throughout the day, and actually feeling close. Then spending time together watching movies and shows, playing video games, cooking something simple, coffee(I don’t even really like coffee lol) and walks, chill nights in, lowkey weekends. The simple stuff that makes feelings build naturally.

I’m drawn to the quieter homebody type: kind, loyal, low-drama, supportive, relationship-minded. If you want one person and you actually mean it, that’s exactly what I’m looking for too.

Some things about me:

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\- I’m a pilot (private pilot, going for my instrument rating), future airline pilot

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\- I absolutely love cars and I will go on for hours about random niche topics

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\- FC Barcelona fan and yes I have opinions

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\- Computer science at UMD

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\- I’m really ambiverted quiet at first, then I’ll yap about literally anything

In a relationship I value honesty, commitment, and loyalty. If you’re looking for something real and you want to build, we’ll probably click.

Looking for 18-22 only, from the US, Canada or the UK. 

If you message me, tell me:

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\- your hottest hot take (political, goofy, whatever)

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\- a show/game you’ve been into lately

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\- what you want most in a relationship

There are a few cyber bullies on this subreddit that come out of the woodwork to shit on any post I make on here, but I’ve met so many great people from posting this elsewhere, I’m just gonna leave it up. Professionals can reach out directly via PM and haters can leave nasty comments. Not gonna let random bullies prevent me from making connections anymore.

I’m Repped actor/filmmaker split my time between LA and NYC here looking to connect with a few talented writer/directors & DP's to collaborate on creating a few high-quality, no-budget short films.

I’m a classically trained actor with good rep. & a few credits on major tv shows, hundreds of auditions for SAG tv/film, for very cool stuff like The Chair Company, The Agency, Once Upon a Time In Hollywood sequel, etc. Last week, I had auditions for a series regular on Joel Kinnamin's next Amazon show, a recurring guest for the Bosch prequel, and a large multi scene costar for Power Origins, just for context of where I’m at professionally and what I bring to the table.

My 1st short I wrote/directed was a police corruption conspiracy. My next two are a psychological thriller & a horror fable. Biggest influences are Fincher, anything HBO, Veep, Sopranos, Fargo, Leftovers, Mad Men, Succession, Mr InBetween, Arrested Development, Barry, The Terror, There Will Be Blood, Charlie Kaufman, Danny McBride, Adult Swim, Key & Peel, Kids in The Hall, The Peter Serafinowicz Show, etc. you get the idea.

My goal is to build a portfolio to use to solicit financing for a slate of features & series down the road + expand my network of filmmaker friends.

If you’re interested, shoot me a DM with a link to your reel / website + availability over the next 2 weeks & we can set up a time to grab coffee or Zoom & talk shop.

It feels outdated and too often the signed copy gets lost anyway.

Had a customer last week who said they signed my estimate and put it somewhere but couldn't find it when I called to schedule. We both wasted time while they searched their house for a piece of paper. Then when they finally found it the signature was smudged from coffee or something and I had to send another copy.

I'm also driving around with a portable printer in my truck which takes up space and the ink cartridges cost a fortune. Half the time I'm printing estimates in my truck in someone's driveway which just looks unprofessional.

I want to send estimates where customers can just click approve on their phone. Makes me look more modern and makes it easier for them to say yes without having to deal with paper. Is there such a thing (which also doesn't confuse older customers)?",1,1770132093.0,askplumbing,1,1.0,False

1quupdj,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/1quupdj/i_am_officially_retiring_from_optimizing_my_life/,"I am officially retiring from ""optimizing"" my life. I’m tired of being a project that needs finishing.","​I had a realization today while staring at a stack of ""must-read"" productivity books on my stand..I’m exhausted. Not need a nap exhausted, but tired of being a person exhausted.
​For the last five years I’ve treated my life like a startup. Everything has to be a hack or a side hustle.
​I can’t just go for a walk I have to track my heart rate and hit a step goal.
​I can’t just play a video game; I feel guilty for not building a skill or learning a language instead.
​I can’t even have a hobby like pottery or drawing without someone asking, Oh are you going to start an Etsy shop?
​No. I’m not. I just want to be bad at something and enjoy it.
​I’m sick of the hustle culture. I’m sick of That Girl aesthetics and 5 AM morning routines. I’m sick of the pressure to be the most optimized,healed, and productive version of myself at all times.

This morning I 30F cooked breakfast and packed lunch for both of us and was running late for work. As my husband 35M was dropping me off, he asked if I had left coffee for him at home. I realized I hadn’t, and I said no, he’d have to make it himself.

I was stressed and venting and said something like, “There’s no one to make coffee for me.” I didn’t mean it as an attack. It was more just me expressing that sometimes I wish someone would do something small for me without me having to ask.

That comment set everything off. He said I don’t know what I want and that I need to set my expectations straight. His point is that when I work from home, he often asks if I want coffee and I usually say no, so he feels confused and like he can’t win.

He also keeps telling me that I “need help,” and because of that (and honestly for myself too), I’ve started going to therapy. I’m trying to work on myself and communicate better, but situations like this make me feel like anytime I express a feeling, it turns into something being “wrong” with me.

From my side, this really wasn’t about coffee. I was tired, running late, and just wanted to feel cared for in that moment. I wasn’t saying he never does anything for me or that he’s a bad partner.

I’m wondering is it unreasonable to want occasional unprompted gestures?

TL;DR: Forgot to make coffee while running late after cooking meals, vented that no one makes coffee for me, husband took it as mixed signals and said I don’t know what I want, told me I “need help” and that he has a pattern in life and I don’t.

🎨 Vibe & ambience

Cozy vs aesthetic vs social?

Indoor/outdoor, music, lighting?

🍰 Food & desserts

Simple & affordable vs unique & premium?

Anything you wish cafés offered more often?

🎲 Experiences

Events, board games, workshops, quiet zones, community vibes?

Would you actually attend these?

🚫 Things you’re tired of seeing

Dip Buyers and Institutional Bulls Bet Big on a Rebound, Dismissing the Crash as Mere Turbulence

https://preview.redd.it/94uwvr0zoahg1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c816bfa047e410790baeaeca751eca3326ddf18

If you blinked at the end of last week, you might have thought the great precious metals super-cycle had finally run out of steam. If you blinked again this morning, you likely missed the fire sale of the decade. After a historic rout that left speculative traders reeling, gold and silver are staging a massive comeback today, proving that for the metal bulls, the only thing scarier than a crash is missing the bottom.

Dip buyers have flooded back into the market with a vengeance, snapping up bullion at what many are calling a strategic discount. Spot gold climbed as much as 6.2 percent to hover near $4,950 an ounce, erasing much of the pain from its worst sell-off since 2013. Silver, arguably the more dramatic sibling in this metallic family, surged more than 10 percent to reclaim territory above $87 an ounce. The recovery has been swift, fueled by a softening U.S. dollar and a collective realization that the fundamental drivers of this multi-year rally, geopolitical anxiety and central bank accumulation, haven’t actually gone anywhere.

While the sudden collapse late last week was triggered by overextended positioning from Chinese funds and Western retail investors, institutional giants are urging clients to look past the noise. In a bold note released amidst the chaos, J.P. Morgan made the case that we are merely in the early innings of a structural shift. The bank upgraded its year-end 2026 forecast to a staggering $6,300 an ounce, arguing that the world is entering a ""well-entrenched regime"" where real assets will consistently outperform paper ones. They predict central banks will scoop up another 800 tons of gold this year alone to diversify reserves. If private sector allocation ticks up even modestly, J.P. Morgan suggests prices could theoretically test $8,000 in the years ahead.

They aren't the only ones holding the line. Deutsche Bank confirmed on Monday that it is standing by its own $6,000 target, while UBS Group AG strategist Joni Teves described the pullback as a ""healthy correction"" that offers a prime entry point for long-term strategies. The consensus on the street seems to be that while the speculative froth needed to be blown off the top, the coffee underneath is still piping hot.

The direction of the recovery may well be decided in Shenzhen. As the Lunar New Year approaches, physical demand in China has been voracious, with buyers flocking to the country’s largest bullion marketplace to stock up on jewelry and bars. However, this fervor is meeting resistance from Beijing’s financial architects; major state-owned banks are reportedly tightening controls on gold investments to dampen volatility, creating a fascinating tug-of-war between organic demand and regulatory caution.

Investors are also keeping one eye on Washington. President Donald Trump’s recent comments regarding potential nuclear talks with Iran could introduce a new variable. A diplomatic breakthrough in the coming days might diminish gold's safe-haven appeal, though market veterans would argue that in 2026, there are plenty of other geopolitical fires keeping the safety trade alive. For now, the ""fear of missing out"" seems to have trumped the fear of falling prices, sending the metals market back into overdrive.",1,1770131241.0,Junior_Stocks,0,1.0,False
1quuceh,https://www.reddit.com/r/UGCForBrands/comments/1quuceh/how_to_find_6figure_deals_with_brands_without/,How to find 6-figure deals with brands without offering affiliate,"# Most agencies work forwards instead of backwards.

They build a roster.  
Then they pitch brands.  
Then they wait… and wait… and wait.

Because the real problem isn’t creators.  
It’s that there aren’t enough buying conversations.

When opportunities dry up, everything else breaks.

They still build decks.  
They still DM brands.  
They still “follow up.”

But with no real demand, they’re forced to make it easier to say yes.

That’s when the cycle starts:

• offering affiliate commissions  
• discounting your services  
• watching your roster dry up

My client started closing 6-figure deals with enterprise brands by working backwards:

3. Building a pipeline that leverages trust + FOMO instead of guarantees  
2. Collecting Stripe + DocuSign before building out the creator network

1. Scaling the roster and operations only after payment is secured

Everyone knows sales is what keeps operations alive.  
But almost no one is willing to design for it first.

They just hope demand shows up.

This one built it.

# What they did (Top of Funnel)

# 1. Cold Email infrastructure

Their core ICP received multiple emails.

So did everyone else in their TAM who could even remotely buy.  
Not because they want to ""spam""  
But because cold email is the least expensive channel when it comes to CAC.

It allowed them to generate hundreds of leads for a fraction of inbound/paid channels

# 2. Exact targeting

50,000 cold emails per month per sales rep.

100+ employees or $10m+ revenue  
Any person with a marketing, influencer, or creator title.  
Five select industries.

They did not worry about being liked by 95%.  
They worried about getting interested responses from the 5% with budget.

# 3. Synthesized forwarded email

They sent emails that looked like internal forwards, as if someone else on their team had told them to reach out

There have been massive improvements in making these look like authentic internal messages since 2025.

One of the threads looked like **(Older copy; I got approval before sharing):**

# 4. Mentioned competitors

They referenced a competitor the prospect already knew.  
Not to prove experience, but to short-circuit trust.

It triggered two things instantly:

\* Social proof: “Others like me are already doing this.”

\* FOMO: “If they’re moving, I’m already behind.”

To do this, we put together a list of ALL of their current clients, used Clay to build a ""look-alike"" audience of all competitors, and then found the contacts in their TAM for each of those companies.

# 4. Ask for coffee, instead of a call/more info

Instead of asking for a demo, they asked to grab coffee in the prospect’s city.

Once someone said yes, they pivoted:

“Trip is in a few weeks - want to do a quick virtual intro first?”

Most agreed.

# The uncomfortable truth

Most people won’t say this out loud.

They’ll say:

* They want to grow
* They’re ethical
* They’re different

But when deals stall, they still:

* Struggle to book meetings
* Blame timing
* Blame competition

This agency didn’t try to be the cleanest voice in the room.

I was diagnosed with “severe OCD” and I have more than one obsession. I also have ADHD and social anxiety. Also, my therapist is a recent graduate and is still in training.

To start, my therapist seems to be quite introverted, and is quiet, leaving me to guess when I’m supposed to say something. It’s very awkward, and leaves me feeling like I’m leading all the therapy sessions. We do ERP every few sessions, but on those days it’s more of talking about what I want to work on and not any action or exposure taking place. Then we wrap up and I see her a week later. I think we have only done two exposures so far. One was putting a “dirty” dishwashing brush on the handle and sides of my favorite coffee mug, which caused zero anxiety for me. Another time she had hung a frame slightly crooked in her office. I pointed it out after a while, because I felt like she was waiting for me to, and she just said “I was wondering if you would notice. Was that causing anxiety?” It kind of just felt silly.

Maggie William. I have no problem saying my name. There are thousands of Maggies around the world.

I work at a large hospital called Ashcroft Medical Center in New York. I have been a nurse for several years, and I have seen things that human eyes should not be able to believe. Things that, if I had not witnessed them myself, I would not believe either.

I intend to write other major accounts like this one. The problem is that I never had enough courage to come here and tell them. What made me change my mind and decide to write this one in particular was what happened a few days ago.

The local psychiatric hospital was undergoing a major renovation. Since Ashcroft Medical Center is located downtown, it was the closest option. In addition, it has an excellent structure to receive these people for just a few days of short-term stay, while the facility was not ready.

The real problem was what happened right after…

I had a bad feeling about it, maybe because of everything that was happening that day. I had argued with my best friend over something silly, something I can barely remember now. Trying not to think about it too much, I started taking different shifts, covering every shift that was requested.

The hospital, despite being large, did not have enough space for those people. Even though the structure was good, it was not enough to keep them safe from themselves.

I was walking through the white corridors, wearing a typical nurse’s uniform, pushing a metal cart that groaned with every roll of its four wheels. I was ready to deliver medication to a few more patients who had trouble sleeping.

I was about to turn into another corridor when the white lights began to flicker.

I turned around. I just shrugged. Wiring problems, maybe.

I kept pushing the cart.

The watch on my wrist showed four zeros. I yawned, my eyes watery with exhaustion. When was the last time I rested?

I stopped. My eyes widened.

A girl. Tall. Thin. Dressed in white pants and a white blouse, her bare feet on the smooth floor.

I tilted my head.

A patient out of her room at this hour?

I stepped carefully away from the cart.

The woman, whom I could now see more clearly, was rocking something in her lap. Her black, wet hair hid her face as it clung to her grayish skin, tinged with green.

She stared fixedly at the white cloth in her arms, covered by the sleeves of her shirt, seeming not to have noticed my presence.

I walked backward, each step measured so as not to make a sound. Luckily, I was wearing white flats, which barely made any noise against the floor.

I turn toward the bend in the corridor, walking slowly, this time moving forward, without looking back.

When I reach the reception desk, I sit down and pour myself some hot coffee. I take the dark cup with a trembling hand; with the other, I pull the phone from its cradle on the counter.

I dial a few numbers, and a tired voice echoes on the other end.

“Hello?”

“This is Nurse William…,” I glance to the side. “One of the patients from Block B… she’s out of her room.”

The line goes silent for a few minutes.

I draw in a breath, trying to calm my lungs.

“One moment.” The sound of something moving on the other end of the line makes me hold my breath.

“Miss William? All right, I’ve just checked the security cameras. There’s no record of any doors in Block B being opened.”

The cup almost slips from my hand.

“Oh, yes… thank you.” I place the phone back on its cradle.

I sit back in the chair, thinking it must be nothing more than the exhaustion from having taken over the secretary’s shift. I rest my head against the wooden counter, a sigh escaping my dry lips.

I decide to review some papers, send documents, and analyze files.

The hospital was so empty at that hour; only a few employees were making their rounds.

In a few minutes, it would be time for the security guard Mark’s patrol. He walked through the place with a doughnut in one hand and a flashlight in the other. I let out a dry laugh at the memory, one that stays with me to this day.

I was typing when something caught my attention on the grid of the screen, where the images from the security cameras were displayed side by side.

I narrow my eyes, bringing my face closer to the screen.

The same woman was walking quickly down the hallway of the rooms, her movements swift, as if her feet barely touched the floor.

She passed hallway one, then two, then three, and there was only one left… mine.

I jump when the exit door opens.

My neck snaps around, almost cracking.

No one.

After that incident, the stay of the staff from the other hospital was uneventful. I just wanted to write this because, among all the strange events that happened in that place, none of them felt as realistic as this one; maybe too much coffee went to my head.

I went back to the security camera recordings, but there was nothing.

People clocking in early.,"So, trying to see how others navigate this. This past pay period I noticed a lot of my staff were clocking in 15-20 minutes early. We had a recent snowstorm all across the US and I explained the importance of making accomodations with their transit to assure they get to work on time. So there’s some understanding with that. The week before this, however, I noticed one of my cooks clocking in 20 minutes early and because of this he ended up getting overtime that week. 

My initial thought is to update the employee policy and send a memo to all staff as well as communicate it in person that people can only clock in 5 minutes early if they arrive ahead of their scheduled time. This isn’t enough to break the bank but it’s also accommodating to them if they arrive early. Grab a coffee, eat some staff meal, do whatever you want before you clock in. 

I guess my question is, if I implement this policy, and then have to update their times if they clock in early until they get the picture, is this wage theft on my part? I don’t want to be in a bind. I make the schedule the way I do for a reason with overlap and extra staff during busy times, but if someone clocks in 20 mins early and does their opening work, they’re standing around looking for something to do for the first actual scheduled 20 mins.

  During all of this there were up and downs,  sometimes I wasn't eating right, or exercising more then doing all of the walking required on the job. Despite this,  I could see the weight coming off, getting fitter (loose clothing) and more natural energy. 

Side-effects: I started to get like a upset stomach and headache... which I offset somewhat by eating alitte more protein and drinking my coffee (note, I got these side-effects on my days off when I wasn't physically active) 

Through all of this,  personally I learned to think with my brain 🧠 instead of my stomach.  Exercise when could and able to do so. 

I'm 10 pounds away from my goal weight of 200, when I reach that, I'm going to see if I can get down back to my old Marine Corps weight of 185-187 pounds (back in my 20s)

Years later I'm now in a position where I've started my own business, often working very long hours and starting very early in the morning. I had the habit of drinking about two cups of coffee to help me get through the day but it'd always leave me feeling fidgety, anxious and emotionally drained. Then I remembered the redbulls.... got myself a couple cans and this stuff is literally crafted perfection. I don't want to run the risk of this becoming a bad habit but omg a 250ml can of s/free redbull can change a man.

  
Not only does this pick me up, the anxiety is gone, my head is feeling clearer and I'm literally always in a better mood after finishing a can. I never crash anymore, sometimes last year i'd feel absolutely beat after a long day. Fucking coffee man. This stuff is so amazing that I'm surprised I can just walk into a supermarket and grab it off a shelf. 

Now the hard part is cycling my days and only using it when I really need it lmao.

So anyway

1.Shop with a flyer! Try to use different grocery stores. There’s No frills 5 minute walk from me and most of the time i shop there as it’s the cheapest place and I am lazy to go anywhere, but loblaws and metro are also close by and if I don’t like meats on flyer at No frills, I would go either to metro or loblaws. 

2. Shop from local small farmers markets. If you are in toronto, there is Kai Wei supermarket and in midtown there is lots of asian produce markets on yonge that usually have insanely low prices on produce (Personally, I buy bell peppers from them because they would often put $1.99/pound)

3. If you like your coffee with milk like me, buy bagged milk. Sometimes No frills gives $4.99 for that milk and it’s 4L that lasts me for a long time. 

4. Costco pasta in a box. It’s $10 but you get a lot of pasta for that price and it usually lasts for 1-3 months depending on your family size. 

5. Stock up on rice! If you buy one box of rice that’s like $5. I buy the ones that are 5kg or close to it, which is $10 and it lasts for months!!

1qutv5s,https://www.reddit.com/r/Life/comments/1qutv5s/work_life_balance_or_bad_life_choices/,Work Life Balance or Bad Life Choices,"I recently came across a woman's post on LinkedIn as it popped up on my feeds for some reason.
She had clicked a picture 3 days postpartum, her baby and laptop on the dining table (probably) with some notes and a cup of black coffee (seemed like that so guessing).
She took pride in saying that 3 days postpartum, I am working because I felt the urge to, my workplace has work from anywhere culture and blah blah.
What irked my mind most was:
a) why are you working 3 days postpartum?
b) What kind of a workplace culture are you trying to inflict for other working women?
c) Coffee and an uncomfortable dining chair (as assumed from what I saw in the pictures) made me wonder how was she managing that because seriously, no one is able to manage any work hours for weeks and months postpartum after a normal or a c section delivery.
d) I wondered how she will be as a manager to other women who may report to her now or in future.
e) what about her maternity cover person? Did her company not hire any Mat Cover?
f) I was unsure if that post was to gain comments and views because no one in their sane mind would like and appreciate such a post. All the men and women were congratulating her and asking her to rest.

I am posting all this here because I did not want to add to that list of comments and views. But I am seriously wondering if that educated working woman was in the right state of mind when she clicked that picture because that picture and story had a lot of red flags. Not just about her but also the workplace inspite of her posting that that can work anytime and from anywhere.",3,1770130090.0,Life,6,1.0,False

1quttcd,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1quttcd/my_f37_boyfriend_m33_is_emotionally_married_to/,My (F37) boyfriend (M33) is emotionally married to his ex (F30+) and her new boyfriend (M30+) and I’m apparently the problem,"Hi Reddit. Please gather, the tea is hot and the dumpster is actively on fire. 🔥☕🔥☕🔥☕🔥☕🔥

(Note: yes, I made sure to have the text edited for better readability and for your enjoyment, let's have some fun at my soap oper worthy misery...)

I (F37) haven’t been with my boyfriend (M33) for long: \~ 3 months. Before you sharpen the knives: he is genuinely a sweetheart. Kind. Non-toxic. Actively stands up for minorities, LGBTQ+ people, social issues. Emotionally open. Reflective. Willing to work on himself (receipts included). Pulls his weight with chores, even if I sometimes have to teach him basics because his parents didn’t (skill issue, annoying but manageable, he learns fast).

That is not the problem.

The problem is his *“friendship”* with his ex.

# The setup

* He has **one ex** (F in her 30s), they broke up \~5 years ago.
* She broke up with him.
* Three (?) months later, she decided they should be “friends.”
* They now:
   * Hang out **weekly** (sometimes multiple times a week)
   * Go on **vacations together**
   * And now… she has a new boyfriend (M in his 30s, they live together) who also hangs out with them
* From the outside, the three of them look like an item.
* My boyfriend has **no real offline support system besides them**. Most other friends are online/gaming.

Yes. I know. 🚩🚩🚩  
I was naive. Lesson learned.

# Loyalty check: failed

It became clear over time that **his primary loyalty is not to me**, but to:

1. His ex
2. Her new boyfriend
3. Me… 

Example #1:  
I tried being friendly with the ex (because I stupidly assumed all emotional cords were cut). There was a misunderstanding. I immediately told my boyfriend: *“Hey, something happened, I’m uncomfortable, I don’t know how to fix this.”*

Next time they met, the ex pulled him aside crying, saying I was:

* Angry at her
* Looking down on her
* A snobby bitch

He came back to me with:

“She was crying. Are you angry at her? Why are you angry at her?”

Despite me having already explained everything.  
That moment **completely discredited me** and hurt deeply.

# The health incident (aka: the moment I should’ve left)

I later met all three of them because I wanted to support what he values. Mistake.

He rushed me to catch a train **knowing I can’t run due to health issues**. I ended up with a flare, dizziness, breathing issues, barely able to walk. We missed the train anyway (there was another in 30 minutes).

He didn’t stop. I was dragged to another city while barely functional.

At their place, the known setup:

* They couldn’t provide food I could eat (I have allergies)
* Gave me coffee while I was dizzy
* Knew I wasn’t well

Later, they told him I was:

* Abusive
* Controlling
* “Mothering”
* Disrespectful for “not feeling well” at their place
* Apparently didn’t care about him (while also being “mothering”… pick one)

And again, **he considered that they might be right**, despite previously telling me I treated him better than anyone ever had and that I was the first person he trusted enough to fully open up to.

He also deflected me pointing out the unfairness of the situation by saying that ""they couldn't have known I wasn't well.""

To the very least, bf told me that he reminded them that they shouldn't be so harsh, because I wasn't feeling well, and they replied that they were ready to reconsider...

# The false progress

After my friends pointed out the obvious (“this relationship never actually ended”), he *seemed* to wake up:

* Started questioning the dynamic and was open to my point of view
* Tried setting boundaries in general, and he did (at least when it came to me)
* Expressed fear of losing me as a reason for not fully committing to me
* Acknowledged dependency when it came to opinions

We agreed to slow things down, talk things through properly, face-to-face. I deliberately held back my own trauma reactions so he could process his.

Then this weekend happened.

# The final straw

He told me he needed rest. I agreed, reluctantly so.

Saturday afternoon, I called. No answer. Then a short ""not home"" message, so I asked.  
Turns out he had **spent the entire day at his ex’s place**.

No communication.  
He got home just before 8:30pm, exactly when I have a standing weekly call with friends (which he knows about) and inquired about having a call.

When I confronted him:

* He deflected
* Claimed it was “last minute”
* Accused me of wanting to control where he goes
* Completely missed the point: **he chose them over working on our relationship**

If you “need rest,” you don’t spend an entire day with the people you’re emotionally entangled with.

# Where I’m at now

I’ve stepped back.

I told him this is no longer something I can explain into existence. If I’m right, he won’t be able to have *any* healthy relationship as long as this entanglement is present.

Tbf, he seems to be taking the issue even more seriously now, and I hope it is not just my wishful thinking.

I know I’ve been too lenient. I know I built bridges I shouldn’t have. I stayed because he is lovable, and because I believed growth was happening.

Now I’m asking you, Reddit:

* How long would you wait, if at all?
* Is this salvageable without distance from the ex?
* And yes, feel free to roast me. I’ve earned at least part of it.

1quttb5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1quttb5,I created a coffee table book full of Sankey diagrams of company P&Ls,"Over the past few months, I took what we learned from visualizing the P&Ls of hundreds of companies and turned it into a high-quality coffee table style book called “Margins: How the world’s biggest companies make money.” 

The book uses beautiful Sankey diagrams to dissect the P&Ls of 15 of the world’s biggest companies like NVIDIA and Tesla, from 2020–2025, a period shaped by Covid and AI boom. Sankey diagrams, we believe, are the best way to visualize income statements because of the easy way they communicate data at a glance. You can see a more images here

1quts7d,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChristianDating/comments/1quts7d/i_went_on_3_speed_dates_in_one_day_and_heres_what/,I Went on 3 “Speed Dates” in One Day and Here’s What Happened 😅,"Hey ladies and gents, after being rusty to the dating game I decided to try something radical and unorthodox. I went on 3 short, purely introduction dates in the same day.

For context, I’ve been praying for a wife, going to school, in therapy, I have a mentor. I recently lost 30 pounds with a new diet. I fast, pray, and read my Bible. But at the end of the day, faith requires work, so I setup some introduction dates with 3 Christian women.

Note: I’m nobody special. I’m not an attractive guy. I’ve always considered myself a very rugged, into cars, gets my hands dirty kinda fella. I’m also a Certified Yapper, which tends to scare a lot of women off. I’m just a regular humble Christ loving guy trying to improve and become a husband and father.

Anyway, I want to share my speed dating experience with you all, if that’s okay.

I also want to note all three ladies were equally beautiful. FYI: Non of the dates are women from the thread, Sub or Christian Dating Group. Respect 🫡 and Privacy intact. All three were women from a Dating App I had been speaking to 3-5 days max:

⏰ 10:30–11:30 AM (Date #1)

Profession: Nurse

So with Date #1, she was short, about 5’2–5’3. I usually like to date 5’3–5’9. Being a 6’–6’1 guy, I don’t like my arm being yanked down when holding hands.

She appeared innocent in nature

She owns a horse 🐎 so bada\*\*

Through the conversation she never cursed, but threw out some edgy jokes letting me know “I’m no fragile angel.” That was so refreshing because she had me laughing like I was at a secular comedy show (and I don’t go to secular comedy shows).

She’s a nurse, and instead of running from the stereotypes in her field, she made light of it and turned it into a joke: “Thank God I’m saved. If Jesus can sit next to sinners, I can work with cheaters.” I spit out my drink 😭🤣

The con: her schedule is crazy and she wasn’t open to the idea of intentional dating.

She also asked when I wanted to get married, and I said “soon if it’s Gods will”. She said, “I’m a slow burn, I don’t want to date for years, but the idea of being married too soon convenes me.” Keep in mind the concept of “courtship” is new to her and as new follower in Christ. She’s still opening her eyes in her faith.

One thing that really stood out: we talked politics, life, and the divide between men and women and didn’t argue once. Her communication skills turned every negative or firm conversation into a positive, light moment.

She may be short, but her energy is 6 ft 🫡

Did anyone notice that for such a short date, me and her explored the world like Dora and Diego? 😌

She saved my number under “🧸.”

⏰ 3:30–5:30 PM (Date #2)

Profession: Doctor 

From the jump, her voice was soft like those meditation videos on YouTube. She made me feel like I was back in high school.

I kept feeling like I knew her.

She shared struggles and vulnerability instantly and I instantly empathized and felt sad about what she had been through.

On the surface there were no scars or flaws, but internally such a heavy load.

She’s so sweet, and her interest made me sigh in relief. Talking to her made me want to make us both sourdough grilled cheese sandwiches and just cuddle 🙅‍♂️ (no temptation 🏃🏾‍♂️) 🤣.

Her personality was bubbly, warm, and sad, which is weird, but attractive.

Spoke a lot about wanting to do overseas missionary work with her future husband.

She kept making jokes about making me her husband and shared that God had given her visions of a husband prior and that she’d be married in 2026. She also stated that she gets frequent visions. (I don’t know how to interpret that to be honest. I was neutral, not alarmed, not encouraged).

There was a point where I thought I had to leave because I got a call and needed to attend an online lecture for school. She looked so worried, like she thought I was trying to run away. I showed her my school portal and reassured her. She admitted she thought I wanted “an out” on the date, and appreciated the reassurance.

This woman’s style 🔥 says: I like coffee, I could go to a conference, but I can also make any pair of jeans and glasses look fashionable.

⏰ 7–8 PM (Date #3)

Profession: Clinical Psychologist

First impression of #3 was wooah she’s gorgeous no exaggeration. Every time I looked in her eyes or at her smile/ face it felt like home. Kinda like watching a cover girl commercial. Originally on the dating App I thought she was Ai 🫣

She was antisocial.

Fake laughed throughout the entire date.

The connection didn’t match the attraction at all not even a little.

Throughout the conversation she talked about, “If a man can’t teach me this or that,” listing a million things, then proceeded explain her methods and ways of finding out if a man is a fake Christian.

Before the date ended, I was able to get one question in 🙋🏾‍♂️Me: “What do you like to do?” | Her response: Mountain biking, nature, hiking.

Date over she had to go into work.

I can’t really recall much from this date. It kind of fell flat.

——————-

Feedback: Dating again seems scary but if you pray before hand and give your anxiety to the Lord it can be refreshing. Would I try this format again? Absolutely 💪🏾

Verdict: Would like to go to know #1 or #2 further and maybe a Bible studies?

How I felt afterwards: My confidence is slowly rebuilding itself. I went home, prayed, and ate dinner with my Niece, we laughed over some jokes and listened to Forrest Frank, Teddy Swims, TobyMac, Elevation Music, and Childish Gambino.

It was a good day. 👏🏾🙏🏾",10,1770129901.0,ChristianDating,11,0.86,False

1qutr8h,https://www.reddit.com/r/BenignExistence/comments/1qutr8h/today_i_accidentally_started_a_tiny_ritual_that/,Today I accidentally started a tiny ritual that might become my favorite,"I went out to get some groceries, just the usual  eggs, coffee, bread. On the way home l passed a small park bench where an older man always sits with his dog. We’ve nodded to each other a few times before, but never talked. This time, I sat down for a moment to tie my shoes. The dog, a fluffy golden retriever, happily plopped his head on my knee like we were old friends. The man smiled and said, “He likes you. You’re now part of the club.” We ended up chatting for maybe dive minutes about nothing special  the weather, how old dogs sleep so much, how pastries are overpriced these days. Then we both went our separate ways. When I got home, I realized how unexpectedly nice that little moment was. I hadn’t planned it, I didn’t owe anyone anything, but it added a small warm “hello” to my otherwise ordinary day. Maybe tomorrow I’ll sit there again with a coffee, just to see if the dog remembers me",603,1770129836.0,BenignExistence,17,0.99,False

Everything else was a waste.,"Been down the rabbit hole for about two years now. Spent way too much money. Here's what actually mattered.

**1. Better beans (biggest difference)**

Not even expensive ones. Just fresh ones. Grocery store beans sit on shelves for months. Local roaster beans or even the fresh ones from Trader Joe's or Costco that have a roast date on them. Night and day difference. Spend about $12-18 per bag instead of $8. Worth it.

If you change nothing else, change this.

**2. A half-decent grinder**

I know, everyone says this. But it's true. Went from pre-ground to a $40 hand grinder (Timemore C2 knockoff from Amazon) and it was noticeably better. Not life-changing, but noticeable.

You don't need a $200 grinder to start. Anything that gives you fresh ground coffee beats pre-ground.

**3. Water temperature**

Was pouring boiling water straight from the kettle. Let it sit for 30 seconds after boiling. Less bitter, more flavor. Cost: nothing.

**What didn't matter (for me):**

* Expensive pour-over kettles (normal kettle works fine)
* Scales accurate to 0.1g (just eyeball it honestly)
* Fancy filters
* The ""right"" ratio (I just do roughly 1:15 and adjust to taste)

Maybe I'm not picky enough but I genuinely couldn't tell the difference with the fancy stuff.

**My current setup cost about $70 total:**

* Aeropress ($40)
* Hand grinder ($40)
* Fresh beans ($15 per bag)

Makes better coffee than most coffee shops I've been to.

What actually made a difference for you? Curious if I'm missing something obvious.",1,1770129800.0,ChillCoffeeCrew,0,1.0,False
