Here’s what actually worked for me.,"Hey guys, I just wanted to share something that honestly surprised me. I’m a makeup artist based in Savannah, GA.

Like a lot of us, I used to think I had to be on The Knot or constantly post Reels just to stay relevant. But honestly? It started to feel like more stress than return.

Back in January, I did makeup for a small backyard wedding where I met this really talented florist. 

Her work was stunning, and after the wedding, I sent her a few behind-the-scenes shots that featured her florals no pitch, no ask, just figured she might want them for her socials or website.

A couple of weeks later, I got a message from a bride who said she was referred by that florist. 

That turned into a booking. Then another one came in the same way. So I reached out to say thanks, and we ended up meeting up for coffee.

We got talking about how vendor referrals tend to be the same few names circulating over and over, and I mentioned this idea I had: creating a little local vendor guide for couples looking for recommendations. She was into it and said she’d love to be featured.

So I put together a simple PDF in Canva with a few vendors I genuinely enjoy working with just one photo each and a short blurb. 

I sent it to them with a quick note saying they could share it with their couples if they wanted.

A few months later, and I’ve booked several weddings through that circle of vendors. 

These clients were already talking to someone they trusted, so they came in more ready to book way less ghosting and way fewer pricing objections.

I know it’s a very simple process , but it really shifted how I think about networking that's why I am sharing it . **Less focus on constant content and more on building trust with people you’d want to work with again.**

**As a wedding professional myself, I know the #1 struggle in our space is getting consistent clients**

So I made a short quiz for wedding vendors to help figure out why dream clients aren’t booking you and how to fix it.

It’s just 5 quick questions, and you get a personalized breakdown.

kind of like a diagnosis from a doctor, but for your client bookings

It's 100% free, and I’d honestly love your feedback on it.

**How to Build a Profitable Influencer Business: A Deep Dive into The Influencer Academy by Julie Solomon**

As an influencer or aspiring content creator, you’ve likely experienced the dizzying highs and frustrating lows of the entrepreneurial journey. You work tirelessly to create captivating content, grow your following, and build your brand—but despite all the effort, you're still stuck in the trenches, unable to convert your influence into a sustainable business.

Does this sound familiar?

You wake up every day, coffee in hand, checking your phone for new follower counts, comments, and mentions—feeling a sense of accomplishment only to realize you're stuck in a never-ending cycle of content creation. It’s exhausting, and worst of all, it’s not paying the bills (yet).

But what if I told you that the secret to truly thriving as an influencer isn’t just about mastering algorithms, posting new content, or racking up brand deals? What if there was a smarter way to build a long-lasting business based on your influence and passions?

That’s where **The Influencer Academy** by Julie Solomon comes in.

**The Influencer Academy: What You Need to Know**

The Influencer Academy is a step-by-step program designed to help you turn your passion for influencing into a fully-fledged, profitable business. Whether you’re an influencer with a small but engaged following or someone who feels like you're always “one step behind” your competitors, this program will give you a crystal-clear blueprint to help you take control of your brand, grow your community, and create sustainable income streams.

So, what makes The Influencer Academy different from other influencer courses? The answer lies in its core approach: **purpose-driven business strategy**.

# 1. Define Your Purpose

Everything starts with a strong foundation—and that foundation is your **purpose**. Julie’s approach begins by helping you get clear on WHY you’re doing what you’re doing. It’s not just about creating content for the sake of it; it’s about connecting deeply with your audience and ensuring that everything you do aligns with your values and goals.

In Module 1 of the Academy, you’ll:

* **Clarify your “why”**: Understand your passions and what drives your brand.
* **Create a Purpose Pillar Plan**: Focus your energy on the most important goals, and get rid of distractions that don’t align with your vision.
* **Step into your own power**: Overcome limiting beliefs that might be holding you back from fully embracing your potential as an influencer.

# 2. Build Your Brand Strategy

Once you’ve defined your purpose, it’s time to build your **brand strategy**. With Julie’s help, you’ll focus on what matters most—creating a niche that resonates with your target audience and using your strengths to grow your business.

Here’s what you’ll learn in Module 2:

* **Becoming a leader**: It’s time to own your expertise and the value you bring to your audience.
* **Streamlining your passions**: You likely have many interests, but in business, narrowing your focus is key to making progress. Julie will guide you to select the business drivers that align with your brand and are most likely to help you scale.
* **Implementation tactics**: Learn how to delegate or automate tasks that aren’t your strengths, freeing you up to focus on what matters most.

# 3. Communication & Marketing

Marketing as an influencer isn’t just about posting pretty pictures or videos on Instagram. It’s about building **meaningful relationships** with your audience and using multiple channels to promote your brand.

Module 3 of The Influencer Academy covers:

* **Conversion vs. Awareness**: Understand the difference between using social media for brand awareness and actually converting followers into paying customers.
* **Relationship building**: Learn how to foster deeper connections with your followers and brands you want to collaborate with.
* **Diversifying your marketing**: Social media is just the start. Julie shows you how to expand your marketing efforts beyond Instagram, using everything from guest blogs to partnerships.

# 4. Master List Building

If you’ve been paying attention to successful influencers, you’ll notice one thing they all have in common: a **strong email list**. While social media platforms can change their algorithms overnight, your email list is yours to own—and it’s the most direct way to communicate with your audience.

In Module 4, you’ll learn:

* **The importance of your email list**: Why it’s the most valuable asset you can own.
* **List building strategies**: Julie shows you how to leverage social media and other tools to quickly build and grow your list.
* **Email best practices**: From creating the perfect welcome sequence to crafting bankable subject lines, Julie teaches you how to create emails that convert.

# 5. Creating Your Own Products & Services

As an influencer, you’re not just limited to content creation. The real money lies in creating your own products, services, and programs that your audience will love.

In Module 5, Julie shows you:

* **How to create your own products**: Learn how to design and launch products (like e-courses, e-books, or merchandise) that resonate with your audience.
* **Monetizing your expertise**: Julie walks you through the process of turning your knowledge into valuable digital products that will bring in passive income.

**Real Success Stories**

The results speak for themselves. Graduates of The Influencer Academy have turned their passion into a full-time business, with success stories ranging from launching e-commerce shops to creating in-demand courses. Take Jaz Anderson, for example, who grew her email list by 150% and launched her own website after completing the Academy. Or Malory Hank-Johnson, who launched an e-course to help women of color thrive on Instagram.

**Are You Ready to Build Your Influencer Business?**

The journey from content creator to entrepreneur is tough, but with a tailored business strategy, you can overcome the challenges and build a profitable brand that’s sustainable and impactful. **The Influencer Academy** gives you all the tools you need to define your purpose, create a strategy, and grow a business that reflects your passions.

If you’re tired of feeling stuck, overwhelmed, or unsure of where to go next with your influencer career, The Influencer Academy might be exactly what you need to take your brand to the next level.

After a lot of late nights, coffee overdoses, and a crazy amount of trial and error, I finally released my first indie game Koala Jump: Endless Adventure — and even made a small website for it too!

It’s a simple retro-style endless runner where you play as a (very determined) koala trying to survive and collect bonuses. It’s light, colorful, and meant to just be a fun little break from everything serious.

I’m a solo dev, so every pixel, every bug fix, every idea was a learning experience for me. Honestly just excited (and a little nervous) to finally share it with people outside my friends and family.

If you have a few minutes, I’d love if you could check it out, even just the site! Feedback, roast, ideas — all are welcome.

1kkn2oq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cloisville/comments/1kkn2oq/blank_please_tell_me_im_not_related_to_her/,"Blank: ""Please tell me I'm not related to her.""","This one is going to be all over the place, with some Chloe stuff, some Lex stuff, even some Lana and Clana stuff. This episode is kind of pivotal with all these relationships in different ways and it's hard not to at least touch on them.

Lois has come a long way from her first day at the Talon in Lucy. She's now a pro at juggling customers and making drinks and as someone who worked in a coffee shop for almost 6 years, I think she's killing it! She even catches someone trying to rob them and in true Lois fashion tries to stop him, but of course this is Smallville so he takes her memory of it and goes on his merry way. I know it's probably Chloe wanting to see her cousin and have a coffee and Clark is just along for the ride, but I like to think that Clark secretly enjoys any excuse to be in Lois' presence lol. Lois realizes they've been robbed and Clark is like, ""Nope, nobody is robbing the place both my mom and my future wife work at"" and springs into action. Ok it's probably more the place his mom and his friend work at, but this show gives so little sometimes lol. Clark tries to stop the guy but his power backfires on him and instead of just his last few moments like with Lois, Clark has lost all his memories.

I will say this is definitely one of Chloe's best episodes, she protects Clark and his secret and shows how much she has grown. I love her friendship with Clark, especially when it's very clear it's only a friendship. I never actively shipped them together. It's interesting that once Lois gets there and asks what happened to the door, Clark is willing to tell her the truth, as if he inherently trusts her, but Chloe covers for him. Lois takes Clark's memory loss in stride and teases that at least he's not naked this time, an excellent callback to Crusade. I'm not really sure what Clark is feeling about Lois upon this ""first meeting"". I personally think just a hint of his heat vision, followed by it going away once she said something that irked him would have been perfect because it makes absolutely no sense for Clark to not be attracted to Lois. But like I said in Sacred, it's back to Clana, plus the restrictions were still in place, so as I've said on the other sub, while I'm annoyed by it, I don't find it to be some kind of gotcha moment that proves anything. I still don't love it though. But I digress. He seems to just accept her presence, looks annoyed at her for only knowing how to make PB and J, and wants to make sure that he and Lois aren't related. When Chloe says they live together, in a different world, Clark would assume that meant they are together and we would have gotten a whole different episode that would have been interesting, but to protect Clark from revealing himself in an unguarded moment with Lois, Chloe takes him out of there.

It's funny that both Chloe and Lois have the same reaction to Clark's X-ray vision lol. I think it's purposely done that Clark never says that Lana is the love of his life, Chloe does. I also think it's absolutely ridiculous how many pictures Clark has of Lana, like no one has that many pictures of a crush. I've always acknowledged that Clark and Lana did love each other, but so much of Clark's feelings for Lana were tied up in the image of her he cultivated from afar, and I'm not sure he ever really knew her or she him.

Clark is getting frustrated with not being able to remember anything, and Lois reminds him he usually doesn't show his emotions. She recognizes that he keeps things to himself but doesn't berate him for it. It's sweet that she's checking up on him but she doesn't let him wallow in self pity. She tells him he can still nagivate through things even if he can't remember who to trust. Lois says Clark should trust his gut. Even this early, she believed in him, and I love her for it. She wants to know what Clark's gut says about her. And Clark smiles and says that they don't like each other very much. Lois smiles back and says he's on the right track. This is so adorable because even without his memory, Clark opens up to Lois a bit and they share a joke about not liking each other because they actually do like each other. There is an instant trust and affinity in their dynamic and Lois seems to even cut back on the teasing while Clark is in this vulnerable position.

I love that Lois has no time for Clark and Lana, telling Chloe to not give any more thought to Clark's vacant baby blues. She's so over it and them. She asks if Clark is coming to help them investigate and Clark follows like a loyal puppy dog. I like that Lois' instincts are telling her the dad isn't telling them everything. 

It makes sense that Clark would initially want to believe the best in Lex, but I hate that he inadvertently reveals things to him before he wisens up.

Clark is looking for Chloe but finds Lois instead, and Lois shows him the email she sent. Clark is impressed she got in, and Lois says she's learned not to underestimate Chloe when it comes to helping him. They talk about Kyle and Clark whooshes away to find him, leaving Lois to wonder where he disappeared to.

Lois states once again that Clark is indeed her friend when trying to get in at the Summerholt Institute, and Sheriff Adams lends a hand. They get to the back just in time to see Clark in action. He addresses Lois before he addresses the sheriff and I think that is telling. In most situations I think Clark would focus on the authority figure before he would focus on a friend, but Lois is already important to him, so he focuses on her first. And Lois doesn't look scared, but she does look a little shook. Like she's rethinking every interaction she's had with Clark and how she couldn't quite peg him and saw two different sides to him, but now it's starting to make sense. She also says the exact same thing she says to him in Infamous, 4 years later, ""Guess I shouldn't call you Smallville anymore."" Lois is always consistent. Clark looks so dejected that his secret is out, so Kyle does him a solid and takes the memory from Lois, Sheriff Adams, and Chloe, not knowing Chloe already knows. Lois goes back to her typical ribbing of Clark and all is well again. Clark's memory is back but he has no recollection of when he didn't have a memory, so he doesn't know that Chloe knows, even though he has his suspicions, he doesn't know that he said the same thing to Lana about things being different (newsflash, they won't be), he doesn't know that Lois got through to him when he was sulking, and he doesn't know that Lex knows about the chamber in the caves. At least Clark remembers Lana is still with Jason, which is more than I can say for Lana herself. And the final scene with Clark being oh so terrified that he did something unusual around Chloe is kind of sad. This guy can't be himself around anyone(except Lois) and he always has to be on his guard.

1kkmujp,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_90DayKoreanOfficial/comments/1kkmujp/breaking_down_korean_sentence_structures_for/,🧩 Breaking Down Korean Sentence Structures for Beginners,"Korean sentences might look upside-down at first (literally!), but once you get the hang of the patterns, it all clicks. As someone who helps beginners learn Korean, I wanted to break it down in a way that *actually makes sense*. Let’s go!

1️⃣ **Korean = SOV (Subject + Object + Verb)**  
🧱 *The backbone of every sentence*

Unlike English (SVO), Korean places the verb at the end.  
**Example:**  
나는 사과를 먹어요.  
*(I apple eat → I eat an apple)*  
It feels weird at first, but your brain will adjust fast once you start reading and speaking more.

2️⃣ **Particles Are Tiny But Mighty**  
⚙️ *They show who’s doing what*

Particles are like grammar glue. Some essentials:

* 은/는 = topic
* 이/가 = subject
* 을/를 = object

**Example:**  
고양이가 생선을 먹어요.  
*(The cat eats fish)*  
“가” marks 고양이 (cat) as the subject, and “을” marks 생선 (fish) as the object.

3️⃣ **The Verb ALWAYS Comes Last**  
⏳ *No matter what*

Korean verbs are polite and wait until the end.  
Even with longer sentences:  
**친구랑 카페에서 커피를 마셨어요.**  
*(I drank coffee at a café with a friend)*  
The verb 마셨어요 (drank) patiently waits at the end.

4️⃣ **Adjectives Are Verbs Too?!**  
🧼 *Clean, pretty, and grammatically active*

In Korean, adjectives work like verbs.  
**그 여자는 예뻐요.**  
*(That woman is pretty)*  
No extra “is” needed—예뻐요 *is* the verb!

5️⃣ **Omissions Are Normal**  
🙊 *Saying less often means more*

Korean often drops words if the meaning is clear from context.  
**밥 먹었어요?**  
= “Did you eat?”  
(No subject, but still natural.) This keeps conversation smooth and efficient.

6️⃣ **Negative Sentences Use 안 or -지 않다**  
🙅 *Two ways to say “not”*

**안 가요** = I’m not going  
**가지 않아요** = I don’t go

Both are fine! Use “안” in everyday talk.  
Just remember: ""안"" goes before the verb, while ""-지 않다"" wraps around it.

7️⃣ **Questions = Same Word Order + Rising Intonation**  
❓ *No need to flip things around*

To turn a statement into a question, just raise your voice at the end.  
**밥 먹었어요?** = Did you eat?  
**지금 가요?** = Are you going now?  
Easy, right?

8️⃣ **Honorifics & Formality Levels Matter**  
🙏 *Talk differently to grandma vs. your friend*

Korean changes based on who you’re speaking to.  
**가요** = polite  
**갑니다** = formal  
**가** = informal

Start with **-요** style—it’s safe for most situations!

9️⃣ **Time, Place, and Manner Go Before the Verb**  
🗺️ *More info, same verb-at-the-end rule*

**어제 집에서 영화를 봤어요.**  
*(Yesterday at home I watched a movie)*  
You can stack details like building blocks, but the verb always anchors it at the end.

🔟 **Practice With Patterns, Not Just Words**  
🧩 *Sentence-building is a puzzle*

Instead of memorizing random words, practice plugging new vocab into set sentence patterns.  
**저는 \_\_\_을/를 좋아해요.**  
Try: 저는 떡볶이를 좋아해요.  
Or: 저는 BTS를 좋아해요.

**Your Turn!**  
Sentence structure is the skeleton of Korean, it holds everything together. Which part are you still wrapping your head around? Or what helped *you* finally get it? Let’s help each other out! 💬",1,1747036019.0,u_90DayKoreanOfficial,0,1.0,False
1kkmtlq,https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackNovel/comments/1kkmtlq/where_to_readcut_ties_how_i_left_my_cheating/,"Where to read""Cut Ties: How I Left My Cheating Dynasty Novel""?","Chapter 1  
  
Ten years ago, Thane Cole held a knife to his own throat and told his parents he would marry no one but me.  
  
Ten years later, he picked up that knife again. But this time, it was to make me apologize to his young mistress.  
  
The same Thane who once promised never to betray me now shields the trembling girl in his arms, looking at me like I'm some kind of monster, with no trace of his former love.  
  
In a daze, I remember the boy who swore he'd love me forever.  
  
And suddenly I realize—  
  
Our ten-year marriage has finally reached its end.  
  
So for the first time, I suggest divorce: ""Thane, let's set each other free.""  
  
""I don’t agree with the divorce!""  
  
Thane rejected my request without a second thought.  
  
He frowned slightly, glancing down at Lily, who he still held protectively in his arms. Seeming to realize something, he slowly released her. But he kept her safely behind him, guarding her as if I might hurt her.  
  
The knife he gripped in his hand—its tip remained pointed at me, cold and cutting.  
  
""Sophie, I promise you, Lily won't affect your standing at all.""  
  
After a pause, he continued: ""But you must promise me you won't cause any more trouble for her.""  
  
The ""trouble"" Thane referred to?  
  
Just like—the clear, humiliating handprint now visible on Lily's face.  
  
If Thane had arrived any later, I might have grabbed Lily's hair and smashed her face against the coffee table, using the shattered glass from the broken water cup to cut up her face and hands, ensuring she'd never show herself to me again.  
  
Insane and vicious thoughts.  
  
But I used to be a person with stable emotions. For years, I rarely argued with anyone, let alone fought physically.  
  
Acting so recklessly, lashing out like this—was unprecedented for me.  
  
I looked back at my two children, hiding in the bedroom but stubbornly peeking through a crack in the door—my Emma and Noah.  
  
Their faces still showed visible pinch marks, all thanks to Lily. So I couldn't control myself to hit her.  
  
Thane was clearly shocked by my behavior. The young woman he'd been spoiling for over a year now covered her swollen face, crying to him about my cruelty.  
  
And that boy who once promised never to let me down?  
  
With fury in his eyes, ignoring our children's cries, he grabbed the knife from the counter when I tried to lunge at her again. He pressed it against my throat, demanding I calm down.  
  
Yet once before, he had pressed that same knife to his own throat, telling his parents he would marry no one but me. That's how we got married, had our lovely children, and completed our family.  
  
Unfortunately, both things and people have all changed.  
  
""Sophie, we've been married for ten years. Our lives are too intertwined. Even if we die, we must die together, understand?""  
  
Thane's eyes were determined as he spoke, completely missing Lily's resentful gaze.  
  
She wanted my place—otherwise, this year-long affair, hidden so carefully by Thane, protected by my absolute trust in him, I should never have discovered it.  
  
But Lily deliberately sought me out.  
  
This girl whom Thane and I had jointly supported through school showed up boldly at my door with photo after photo of herself with Thane.  
  
""Sophie, I'm grateful to you and Thane for supporting my education.""  
  
""But let's be clear: gratitude is one thing, love is another.""  
  
""So this doesn't mean I have to give Thane back to you.""  
  
""I know you and Thane have been married for years, but you're older now, no longer fresh.""  
  
""I'm just twenty—young and beautiful. What do you have to compete with me?""  
  
""You guys probably don't even do it more than once a month, right?""  
  
""But do you know what?""  
  
""When Thane's with me, we do it every night.""  
  
""He says he can't resist me.""  
  
""Sophie, does Thane still feel that way about you?""  
  
…  
  
Every word cut through me like a knife.  
  
That day was the most devastating of my entire life that I can't bear to remember it anymore.  
  
So I just looked at Thane and repeated my earlier words.  
  
""Thane, let's set each other free, okay?""  
  
At that moment—outside, ice cream truck is blaring its jingle in the sweltering heat.  
  
Chapter 2  
  
In a daze, I remembered that summer when I was sixteen with the same suffocating heat and the same ice cream truck.  
  
That day, Thane Cole, a transfer student, caught my attention when our teacher introduced him to the class.  
  
Sunlight streamed through the windows, a gentle breeze lifted the edges of his crisp white shirt—it's a heart-pounding moment at first sight.  
  
As class president, it was my responsibility to help new students get familiar with our class. So we had a reason to interact.  
  
Back then, I only knew he was Thane Cole and came from New York City, with his family probably well-off. Maybe he was too rebellious, or maybe he'd done something wrong, and that's why he'd been sent to our small town.  
  
But I didn't care about any of that. I just knew I needed to follow the teacher's instructions and help him integrate into our class.  
  
Of course, I had my own little secret thoughts too—he was simply too handsome.  
  
I've never claimed to be particularly deep. I've always paid extra attention to beautiful people and things.  
  
Maybe it's just fate? Thane and I sat next to each other for three years, gradually evolving from slightly awkward classmates to best friends who shared everything. And then those occasional moments when our eyes met—  
  
I felt my heart race, saw the tips of his ears turn red, and something unspoken grew between us.  
  
A tacitly understanding, you could say.  
  
After graduation, he presented me with my favorite lilies and asked if I dared to be his classmate for another four years.  
  
I, Sophie Sutton, had never been afraid of anything. Four more years as classmates? Why would I be afraid of that?  
  
So that summer, we applied to the same college and moved to the same unfamiliar city.  
  
I think… I have found love.  
  
Those four college years were peaceful and happy. We never let go of each other's hands.  
  
Until graduation day, a wealthy, bejeweled woman approached me. She introduced herself as Thane's mother, making it clear she looked down on me, explaining how the Cole family was enormously wealthy and influential. So when selecting a daughter-in-law, they had to be extremely careful.  
  
Social compatibility was paramount. A plain girl from a small town like me shouldn't try to change her social status through marriage, dreaming of an overnight ascension.  
  
Just like in the TV dramas, she pushed a blank check toward me, grandly telling me to fill in any amount I wanted.  
  
But unlike the TV dramas, I didn't even have time to react. Thane, having heard about the meeting, rushed over.  
  
That check I hadn't even properly seen?  
  
It scattered into the air like confetti before my eyes.  
  
That day, Thane held my hand so tightly, as if afraid I might waver, repeatedly telling me:  
  
""Sophie, a check doesn't amount to much. As long as you don't let go of my hand, I'll give you anything you want.""  
  
At that time, all I could think was—  
  
Thane, I don't want your money. I only want your wholehearted love.  
  
We were young and passionate then, believing love was everything and Thane was my everything.  
  
It wasn't until years later that I realized just how wrong I'd been.  
  
Later, all I remember from that afternoon was Thane arguing furiously with his mother, his face flushed red. In the end, he grabbed a knife from the bar counter and pressed it against his own throat.  
  
Leaving a clear and long blood mark, he said resolutely and firmly: ""I'm not like my father. I'm not full of tricks. In this life, I only want to be with Sophie. Mom, I hope you can accept us.""  
  
Perhaps Thane was too resolute or perhaps that streak of red was too shocking. In the end, Mrs. Cole compromised.  
  
But as she left that day, there was something in her gaze I couldn't quite understand.  
  
But I didn't understand then, I just thought every family had their issues.  
  
My parents loved each other, but they were still traditional at heart, favoring my brother over me.  
  
And Thane's parents were once a loving couple too. But the Cole family had a tradition of sponsoring underprivileged children's education.  
  
That young, timid, yet charming girl caught Mr. Cole's eye, he finally fell for her.  
  
Affairs, mistresses, more affairs, more mistresses.  
  
After tasting the sweetness of indulgence, he couldn't stop. Women came and went, each more numerous than before.  
  
A life of luxury and excess is always full of temptations. Mr. Cole, in his position of power, began to enjoy this decadence, growing more distant from Mrs. Cole.  
  
Arguments? Crying? Threats? None of it worked. They fought year after year, until one of his mistresses showed up at their door with a barely visible pregnancy bump, begging Mrs. Cole to spare her life.  
  
Thane watched his mother's tears, then looked at that woman who seemed pitiful but truly hateful. He reached out and pushed the woman down the stairs, blood staining the doorstep.  
  
Mr. Cole was furious and sent him away to attend school in his hometown.  
  
Then that's how Thane and I met, connected, and fell in love.  
  
But ultimately?  
  
Thane, who once despised homewreckers, fell in love with Lily, the scholarship student we sponsored, even buying her a million-dollar home.  
  
So it wasn't until many years later that I understood—that day, the look in Mrs. Cole's eyes wasn't born from being moved by our love or from compromise, but a pure pity.  
  
It's a family curse—like father, like son—it's a never-ending loop. She had always been warning me not to repeat her mistakes.  
  
But unfortunately—  
  
By the time I understood, it was too late.  
  
Chapter 3  
  
As expected, Thane didn't agree to my request for divorce.  
  
We met when we were sixteen, started dating at nineteen, married at twenty-five, had our first child at twenty-six and our second child at twenty-nine. Now at thirty-six, we were deeply intertwined, both emotionally and financially. So he refused to divorce me.  
  
A wife and children at home, a fragile lover outside—Thane wanted to maintain this arrangement.  
  
I mean, just think about it. If we divorced, those shares he gave me when he loved me most? They'd really mess him up financially and would severely weaken his position.  
  
The Cole family had ambitious illegitimate sons and Thane wasn't the only heir.  
  
But I couldn't give up everything and just leave with the children either. I must take what belongs to me.  
  
So we reached an impasse.  
  
Just like now, Thane again suggested I calm down while he took Lily away.  
  
Lily had several bloody marks on her arm. One was deep enough to expose bone—I'd cut her with the glass.  
  
Thane sighed and said: ""Sophie, stay home and calm down. We can talk about anything later.""  
  
Then he left with Lily.  
  
Despite being injured, Lily still shot me a challenging smile before leaving.  
  
I was furious and threw the vase from the table at her.  
  
""Ah!"" Lily screamed as the vase hit her forehead. Thane grabbed her and ran out the door.  
  
But the door didn't close completely. I could hear the girl's soft crying and also hear Thane calling me crazy.  
  
How pathetic!  
  
As soon as they left, Emma and Noah emerged from the bedroom. Holding hands, they cautiously approached me.  
  
I knelt on the floor. Emma and Noah reached out, wanting a hug.  
  
""Mom, don't cry. Emma and Noah will always be with you.""  
  
Ten-year-old Emma, mature and steady, comforted me despite the marks on her face. Noah reached out to wipe away my tears.  
  
""Noah will always protect Mom and Sis, forever and ever!""  
  
Seven-year-old Noah had a cut on his palm from the glass, but he didn't complain about the pain either, choosing to comfort me alongside his sister.  
  
""That woman is so hateful! She stole Dad's keys and came to our house acting all superior!""  
  
Emma hugged me around the neck and kissed the corner of my mouth.  
  
Today was a weekend, but I had an emergency work meeting, so I left the children with our live-in nanny.  
  
I never imagined—Lily would take advantage of this opportunity to come to my house.  
  
The nanny was washing fruit in the kitchen. The two children were playing on the swing in the backyard when Lily silently approached and told Emma to call her ""mom.""  
  
Emma had always been mature for her age. She had some vague understanding of the relationship between Lily and me, so she told Lily to get lost.  
  
Lily was angry and said to Emma: ""Your daddy doesn't love your mommy anymore. If you don't start being nice to me now, when your dad marries me, I'll send you deep into the mountains to suffer like I did!""  
  
Lily came from a remote mountain village.  
  
The year Thane and I got married, following the Cole family tradition, we planned to sponsor several children who wanted an education but couldn't afford it. No matter the personality, there are boys and girls.  
  
Back then, Lily was only nine, skin and bones, but with bright eyes. She deliberately grabbed my sleeve and said to me: ""Miss, I want to go to school. Please sponsor me. I'll repay you someday.""  
  
I never imagined her ""repayment"" would be sleeping with my husband.  
  
The nineteen-year-old girl was full of youth and energy. She kept talking about repaying our kindness, appearing before Thane again and again, stubborn and fresh-faced.  
  
In the end, due to her naivety, someone took advantage of this to drug her.  
  
Thane happened to be passing by. The drug's effects were powerful. The young girl was clingy and seductive, crying in a way that seemed both pitiful and adorable. He couldn't resist. And then, clothes scattered messily around the bed. Thane drew the final period on our perfect eleven-year marriage with his own hand.  
  
But Lily's ambitions went much further. That's why she came to my house and said those things to my daughter.  
  
Emma was furious, shouting at her to leave.  
  
Lily was also angry. She raised her hand and viciously pinched Emma's cheek.  
  
Children's skin is delicate—with just one squeeze, she left a purple bruise.  
  
Noah, seeing his sister being bullied, rushed forward.  
  
The seven-year-old boy was no match for twenty-year-old Lily. Being pushed hard, he hit the table, and the glass cup on it fell to the floor. Noah also fell, and when he put out his hands to break his fall, there were glass shards on the ground. His palm was instantly covered in blood.  
  
At that exact moment, I returned home to retrieve a document I'd forgotten, just in time to witness this scene.  
  
No mother can tolerate seeing her children bullied. In that moment, rage consumed me. I took off my high heels and charged forward, grabbing Lily's head and slamming it against the wall. Again and again, it felt so satisfying.  
  
But before I could turn the tables and let her feel the pain of being cut by glass, Thane came back.

My boyfriend's first love was marrying the infamous Playboy in the circle.   
When he heard the news, he ran to stop the wedding without hesitation.  
With swollen eyes, I sat alone in the living room all night.   
By morning, I received a call from an unfamiliar number.   
""Isabella Bennett, marry me.""   
Hearing that nonchalant tone, I instantly pictured the man.  
The very Playboy my boyfriend's precious was supposed to marry.   
""Your fiancé stole my bride,"" he laughed with mischief.   
""So I'm here to steal his. So fair, right?""   
I finally received the long-awaited proposal.  
But not from the man I’d been waiting seven years for.  
I wiped away the last tear and said calmly, ""I am willing to marry you.""  
  
Isabella had known Dominic for ten years. And she had fallen hard for him at first sight.  
  
It was at the opening ceremony of their first year of high school. Dominic stood at the podium as the student representative.   
  
Sunlight filtered through the hall's floor-to-ceiling windows, casting a golden halo around his sharply defined profile.    
  
Girls throughout the auditorium whispered excitedly as they snuck photos.  
  
But Isabella just stood in the shadows at the back of the hall.  
  
Back then, Dominic was the golden boy of the high school.  
  
Always top of his class, winning gold medals in competitions, even the way he rolled up his sleeves playing basketball exuded that subtle hint of cedar cologne—every gesture screaming old money and privilege.  
  
She was different worlds apart from him, just an ordinary scholarship student.  
  
And this boy that every girl in school worshipped? His eyes only ever followed one person.  
  
Chloe Winslow, his childhood sweetheart.  
  
Isabella had witnessed him organizing Chloe's notes in the library, seen him drape his jacket over Chloe when she got caught in the rain, watched him search the entire city for a limited-edition CD Chloe had casually mentioned.  
  
Later, she heard their families were old friends with an arranged marriage in the works.  
  
Then came the summer after graduation, news broke that the Hinton Group had collapsed overnight.  
  
The same Mr. Hinton who once drove a Rolls-Royce to parent-teacher conferences had jumped from the Hinton tower.   
  
The next day, Chloe flew off to France.   
  
Dominic was left alone to shoulder the immense debt, working tirelessly every day to repay it. His life became a blur of exhaustion and despair.  
  
That night, Isabella found Dominic passed out drunk in an alley behind a bar.  
  
His expensive shirt was wrinkled and his eyes bloodshot—like an abandoned dog.  
  
She crouched down to help him. But he grabbed her wrist, the stench of alcohol and blood hitting her face.   
  
""Who are you?""  
  
""Isabella Bennett,"" she whispered. ""We go to the same school. You probably don't remember...""  
  
He didn't remember at all.  
  
But he let her take him home anyway.  
  
That night, Dominic was like a feral animal. He pinned her to the narrow bed in her tiny studio apartment and kissed her until her lips went numb.  
  
Later, she knew that just thirty minutes before she found him, Chloe had updated her Instagram—  
  
A photo showing her kissing her new boyfriend beneath the Eiffel Tower.  
  
The next morning, Dominic offered to take responsibility for her.  
  
Eventually, he moved into her cramped 200-square-foot studio. They held each other for warmth, surviving the toughest days together.  
  
But Isabella knew, even though she'd rescued this fallen prince, his heart was never truly hers.  
  
He never forgot Chloe.  
  
She'd caught him staring at Chloe's photos in the middle of the night, watched him eat nothing but sandwich for three straight months to save for a plane ticket to Paris, seen him rush out the door on her birthday after receiving a text from Chloe.  
  
Yet she remained hopelessly devoted.  
  
She stayed up with him revising his resume, accompanied him as he dropped off job applications door-to-door, faced off with debt collectors.   
  
During their toughest times, she secretly sold the only gold ring her mother had left her, just to buy him a decent suit for interviews.  
  
Eventually, he started remembering she liked sugar in her coffee. He would text her to remind her to eat dinner while she worked late and gently drape a coat over her when she fell asleep.  
  
She thought she'd finally thawed his frozen heart.  
  
Meanwhile, he rose from the ashes, becoming once again the darling prince of high society.  
  
Just when everything seemed to be heading in the right direction, Chloe returned from France.  
  
And everything went back to square one.  
  
He'd race his car to the airport at midnight to pick her up.   
  
He’d throw a welcome-back party for her like nothing ever happened.   
  
And the moment he heard she was getting married? He dropped everything to crash it without hesitation.  
  
Seven years Isabella had given him everything, and still it couldn't compete with Chloe's simple ""I'm back.""  
  
Finally, she was exhausted. Her love had run dry.  
  
Isabella stood up and started packing.  
  
One by one, everything went into garbage bags.  
  
The garbage truck happened to pull up just then. She watched as workers tossed her bags onto the truck—along with seven years of foolish dreams.  
  
""What are you throwing away?""  
  
The front door suddenly swung open, and Dominic's voice came from behind her.  
  
Isabella didn't turn around, her voice eerily calm. ""Just some useless stuff.”  
  
Then she looked up at him. ""Just cleaning the house. Got rid of things that didn’t matter anymore.”  
  
Those few simple words made Dominic's expression change instantly. He shoved her aside and charged into the house.  
  
""Who gave you permission to touch my things?!""  
  
He ransacked the place, his face growing darker by the second.  
  
After tearing apart the entire study without finding what he was looking for, he bolted outside.  
  
As they passed each other, Dominic accidentally knocked Isabella down.  
  
She stumbled, smashing her forehead against the doorframe. Blood immediately streamed down her face.  
  
Worried he'd lost something important, she didn't even stop to treat her wound before rushing after him.  
  
Then she witnessed the most absurd scene of her life—  
  
Dominic Hinton, the same man with severe germaphobia—was on his knees in a pile of garbage, frantically digging through garbage.  
  
Seeing his desperation, guilt welled up inside her.   
  
“The garbage truck already took everything. It’s at the dump by now. I swear, it was all mine—I probably mixed in some of your stuff by accident. I’m... I’m sorry.”  
  
Only then did Dominic notice her injury.  
  
He froze and reached toward her face, then pulled back. ""I was in a hurry. I didn’t mean to.""  
  
Once they were both in the car, Isabella finally asked. ""What did you lose? Was it important?""  
  
Dominic gripped the steering wheel tightly. He was quiet for a long time.  
  
“It was a necklace. I used to send it out for cleaning every month.”  
  
Isabella’s breath caught, tears welling in her eyes.  
  
That necklace was the token Dominic and Chloe had exchanged when they got engaged.  
  
No wonder he was so desperate.  
  
The tension inside the car thickened into silence.  
  
Dominic noticed  her shift in mood. He knewthere was no hiding the wedding incident from her, so he offered a half-hearted explanation.   
  
""Before Chloe's grandfather died, I promised him I'd look after her. You know Lucas Montgomery. If Chloe married him, her life would be ruined. That's why I had to stop the wedding.""  
  
These were just empty excuses to pacify Isabella.  
  
The real reason he crashed the wedding was because he still had feelings for Chloe and couldn't stand watching her marry someone else.  
  
And his desperate search for that necklace, a token that hadn’t meant anything legally for years—was because deep down, he believed he should be the one marrying Chloe.  
  
The thought twisted something sharp inside Isabella.  
  
She turned her face toward the window, letting the tears fall silently.   
  
""Well, Lucas has found someone new. He won't be bothering Chloe anymore. You can relax.""  
  
Hearing her confident tone, Dominic's brow furrowed. “Lucas found someone new? Who told you that?”  
  
Isabella was about to tell him that she was the bride.   
  
But just then, his jarring ringtone cut through the car.  
  
The moment he answered, Chloe's sob came through the line.  
  
""Dominic, my parents are furious I ran off. They're making me kneel and threatening corporal punishment. I’m gonna die in there! What should I do?""  
  
""I'm coming right now!"" he barked.  
  
He hung up quickly and turned to Isabella. ""Isabella, something's come up. Can you go look for the necklace first?""  
  
Isabella opened her mouth, but no sound came out.  
  
She nodded silently. Then she opened the car door and stepped out alone.  
  
After watching his car disappear into the darkness, she hailed a Uber to the dump.  
  
The garbage truck had already emptied its load. Looking at mountains of garbage under the dim lights, she rolled up her sleeves.  
  
Fighting through the stench, she spent five grueling hours before finding her discarded things.  
  
After turning every box upside down, she still couldn't find the necklace.  
  
Then the housekeeper called.  
  
""Miss Bennett, we found the necklace. It was under Mr. Hinton's pillow. Must’ve slipped there while he was sleeping.”  
  
Isabella let out a bitter laugh.  
  
How deep must his love be to sleep with that necklace, holding onto memories even in his dreams?  
  
And they'd shared that same bed every night, yet she'd never noticed.  
  
Night had fallen completely. With no taxis in the remote area, she had to walk home.  
  
Dawn was breaking, her feet bloodied and legs swollen, when she finally reached the house.  
  
She'd left in such a hurry she'd forgotten her keys.  Too tired to even knock, she leaned against the door and passed out.  
  
Some time later, Isabella was awakened by someone.  
  
Still groggy, she opened her eyes to see Dominic's assistant standing over her. He was clearly anxious.  
  
""Miss Bennett, Mr. Hinton is in trouble. Please come to the hospital right away!""  
  
Isabella's mind was foggy, unable to process what was happening before being pulled into a car.  
  
The cold autumn wind brought her back to her senses, and she finally thought to ask what had happened.  
  
The assistant looked uneasy, hesitating before pulling out his phone to show her a video.  
  
""Mr. Hinton went to the Winslow estate yesterday. He offered to take Miss Winslow's punishment. They gave him one hundred lashes. He passed out afterward and was taken to the hospital.""  
  
In the video, Isabella watched as the man who once would rather lose a hand to loan sharks than drop to his knees—was now on his knees before Chloe's parents, taking the punishment meant for her.  
  
Blood soaked through his shirt, wounds crisscrossed and torn open.  
  
Each strike of the whip seemed to land on Isabella’s , leaving her gasping for air.  
  
The assistant parked the car and escorted her to the hospital room.  
  
The room wasn’t fully shut. Isabella could hear Chloe's sobs from inside.  
  
""Dominic, you're so stupid. I left you alone and go to France. You should hate me. Why crash my wedding? Why would you take the punishment for me?”  
  
Dominic lay on the hospital bed, his voice weak but filled with tenderness.  
  
“I did hate you, right after you left. But as time passed, I was just... grateful.""   
  
""I love you, and I didn’t want you living in my shitty studio apartment, eating nothing but bread and pickles, working part-time jobs till you passed out from low blood sugar... You made the right choice.""  
  
Hearing his explanation, Chloe sobbed harder. Then she threw herself into his arms.  
  
""So you've forgiven me, right? You crashed the wedding because you still love me, right? My parents said if you took my punishment, you'd have to agree to marry me. You said yes, didn’t you?""  
  
Each desperate question hit Isabella like a sledgehammer, leaving her numb from head to toe.  
  
Dominic agreed to marry Chloe?  
  
Then she saw him nod. That was the final crack that shattered what was left of her already ruined heart.  
  
The phone slipped from her hand, clattering on the floor.  
  
After what felt like an eternity, Isabella picked up her phone and turned to leave.  
  
But just as she reached the stairwell, Chloe caught up and grabbed her arm.  
  
""Isabella,"" Chloe smirked, ""I know you saw everything. Dominic never forgot me. You spent seven years suffering with him. But I set up one little trap, and he came running to crash my wedding.""   
  
""Dominic’s never stopped loving me. You really thought you could win against me?”  
  
In that moment, Isabella finally understood—marrying Lucas had been Chloe's strategy all along.  
  
All to lure Dominic into crashing the wedding.  
  
Chloe's parents were probably in on it too, using the punishment to force Dominic to agree to marry her.  
  
Now that Dominic had power and status again, of course they wanted the engagement back.  
  
The realization made Isabella laugh bitterly.   
  
""He loves you so much. And you still played him like that. Doesn't that make you a little bit ashamed?""  
  
Hearing her words, Chloe's face twisted into an expression of disbelief.  
  
“Played him? What exactly did I ‘play’? Whether it was crashing the wedding, taking my punishment, or agreeing to marry me—I never forced him to do anything.""   
  
""He did it all willingly! He loves me enough to sacrifice everything. That's something you'll never have, sweetie.""  
  
Every word hit Isabella like a slap across the face.  
  
She couldn’t even deny it. Because Chloe was right.  
  
“Yes, he made his choice. And I respect it. Don't worry, I'm stepping aside. You two enjoy yourselves.”  
  
Just as Isabella turned to leave, Chloe lunged forward and shoved her down the stairs.  
  
Isabella tumbled down the stone steps. Her body smashing against the hard edges, covered in bruises and streaming blood.  
  
She lay in a pool of her own blood, barely conscious.  
  
Forcing her eyes open, she saw Chloe looking down at her from the top of the stairs with face glowing with triumph.  
  
""Stepping aside? You would step aside? If the Hintons hadn't lost everything, you wouldn't even be worthy to kneel and shine his shoes.""   
  
""Today I'm going to show you exactly where garbage like you belongs. Stop dreaming that a pathetic little nobody like you could ever rise above your station!""  
  
After spitting these vicious words, Chloe snapped her fingers and three thugs emerged from the shadows.  
  
They swarmed Isabella, pinning her arms and legs, leering as they began tearing at her clothes.  
  
She'd never experienced anything like this before.   
  
Her face drained of color as she fought with every ounce of strength she had left.  
  
But she couldn't break free from their grip. Purple bruises formed where they squeezed her limbs. Her shirt was half torn.  
  
In the midst of her terror, she suddenly heard Dominic's voice.  
  
""Chloe? Who was that just now? What are you doing here?""  
  
Chloe spun around. Dominic stood just a few steps away.   
  
She quickly gestured to the men behind her to drag Isabella into a corner.  
  
""Nothing. The nurse asked me to fill out some paperwork. All done now.""  
  
In her desperation, Isabella saw a glimmer of hope. She struggled violently, managing to bite one thug's hand and screamed.  
  
""Dominic! Help me!""  
  
About to turn away, Dominic froze at the familiar cry.  
  
“Wait... was that—?”  
  
""Nobody said anything, Dominic. Are you hearing things?"" Chloe's voice wavered as she grabbed his arm, trying to lead him away.  
  
Something felt wrong. He could hear faint noises from the stairwell below. Instinctively, he moved toward the sound.  
  
""Something's wrong. I need to check.""  
  
But before he could take a step, Chloe deliberately collapsed to the floor with a dramatic cry.  
  
Dominic rushed to turned back and gathered her in his arms, his voice full of concern.  
  
""What's wrong?""  
  
Chloe squeezed out a few tears, gazing up at him pitifully.  
  
""Twisted my ankle. I’m okay... Go check if you want.""  
  
Without a second thought, Dominic lifted her up and hurried back to the hospital room, leaving only his words echoing in the stairwell:  
  
""You're hurt. Where else would I go? Nothing matters more than you.”  
  
As the sound of his footsteps faded, the thugs sighed with relief. They glared viciously at Isabella as they kept their hands firmly over her mouth.  
  
“See that? Screamed your lungs out, and did your precious Dominic even care?”

He frowned slightly, glancing down at Lily, who he still held protectively in his arms. Seeming to realize something, he slowly released her. But he kept her safely behind him, guarding her as if I might hurt her.  
  
The knife he gripped in his hand—its tip remained pointed at me, cold and cutting.  
  
""Sophie, I promise you, Lily won't affect your standing at all.""  
  
After a pause, he continued: ""But you must promise me you won't cause any more trouble for her.""  
  
The ""trouble"" Thane referred to?  
  
Just like—the clear, humiliating handprint now visible on Lily's face.  
  
If Thane had arrived any later, I might have grabbed Lily's hair and smashed her face against the coffee table, using the shattered glass from the broken water cup to cut up her face and hands, ensuring she'd never show herself to me again.  
  
Insane and vicious thoughts.  
  
But I used to be a person with stable emotions. For years, I rarely argued with anyone, let alone fought physically.  
  
Acting so recklessly, lashing out like this—was unprecedented for me.  
  
I looked back at my two children, hiding in the bedroom but stubbornly peeking through a crack in the door—my Emma and Noah.  
  
Their faces still showed visible pinch marks, all thanks to Lily. So I couldn't control myself to hit her.  
  
Thane was clearly shocked by my behavior. The young woman he'd been spoiling for over a year now covered her swollen face, crying to him about my cruelty.  
  
And that boy who once promised never to let me down?  
  
With fury in his eyes, ignoring our children's cries, he grabbed the knife from the counter when I tried to lunge at her again. He pressed it against my throat, demanding I calm down.  
  
Yet once before, he had pressed that same knife to his own throat, telling his parents he would marry no one but me. That's how we got married, had our lovely children, and completed our family.  
  
Unfortunately, both things and people have all changed.  
  
""Sophie, we've been married for ten years. Our lives are too intertwined. Even if we die, we must die together, understand?""  
  
Thane's eyes were determined as he spoke, completely missing Lily's resentful gaze.  
  
She wanted my place—otherwise, this year-long affair, hidden so carefully by Thane, protected by my absolute trust in him, I should never have discovered it.  
  
But Lily deliberately sought me out.  
  
This girl whom Thane and I had jointly supported through school showed up boldly at my door with photo after photo of herself with Thane.  
  
""Sophie, I'm grateful to you and Thane for supporting my education.""  
  
""But let's be clear: gratitude is one thing, love is another.""  
  
""So this doesn't mean I have to give Thane back to you.""  
  
""I know you and Thane have been married for years, but you're older now, no longer fresh.""  
  
""I'm just twenty—young and beautiful. What do you have to compete with me?""  
  
""You guys probably don't even do it more than once a month, right?""  
  
""But do you know what?""  
  
""When Thane's with me, we do it every night.""  
  
""He says he can't resist me.""  
  
""Sophie, does Thane still feel that way about you?""  
  
…  
  
Every word cut through me like a knife.  
  
That day was the most devastating of my entire life that I can't bear to remember it anymore.  
  
So I just looked at Thane and repeated my earlier words.  
  
""Thane, let's set each other free, okay?""  
  
At that moment—outside, ice cream truck is blaring its jingle in the sweltering heat.  
  
In a daze, I remembered that summer when I was sixteen with the same suffocating heat and the same ice cream truck.  
  
That day, Thane Cole, a transfer student, caught my attention when our teacher introduced him to the class.  
  
Sunlight streamed through the windows, a gentle breeze lifted the edges of his crisp white shirt—it's a heart-pounding moment at first sight.  
  
As class pre//sident, it was my responsibility to help new students get familiar with our class. So we had a reason to interact.  
  
Back then, I only knew he was Thane Cole and came from New York City, with his family probably well-off. Maybe he was too rebellious, or maybe he'd done something wrong, and that's why he'd been sent to our small town.  
  
But I didn't care about any of that. I just knew I needed to follow the teacher's instructions and help him integrate into our class.  
  
Of course, I had my own little secret thoughts too—he was simply too charming.  
  
I've never claimed to be particularly deep. I've always paid extra attention to beautiful people and things.  
  
Maybe it's just fate? Thane and I sat next to each other for three years, gradually evolving from slightly awkward classmates to best friends who shared everything. And then those occasional moments when our eyes met—  
  
I felt my heart race, saw the tips of his ears turn red, and something unspoken grew between us.  
  
A tacitly understanding, you could say.  
  
After graduation, he presented me with my favorite lilies and asked if I dared to be his classmate for another four years.  
  
I, Sophie Sutton, had never been afraid of anything. Four more years as classmates? Why would I be afraid of that?  
  
So that summer, we applied to the same college and moved to the same unfamiliar city.  
  
I think… I have found love.  
  
Those four college years were peaceful and happy. We never let go of each other's hands.  
  
Until graduation day, a wealthy, bejeweled woman approached me. She introduced herself as Thane's mother, making it clear she looked down on me, explaining how the Cole family was enormously wealthy and influential. So when selecting a daughter-in-law, they had to be extremely careful.  
  
Social compatibility was paramount. A plain girl from a small town like me shouldn't try to change her social status through marriage, dreaming of an overnight ascension.  
  
Just like in the TV dramas, she pushed a blank check toward me, grandly telling me to fill in any amount I wanted.  
  
But unlike the TV dramas, I didn't even have time to react. Thane, having heard about the meeting, rushed over.  
  
That check I hadn't even properly seen?  
  
It scattered into the air like confetti before my eyes.  
  
That day, Thane held my hand so tightly, as if afraid I might waver, repeatedly telling me:  
  
""Sophie, a check doesn't amount to much. As long as you don't let go of my hand, I'll give you anything you want.""  
  
At that time, all I could think was—  
  
Thane, I don't want your money. I only want your wholehearted love.  
  
We were young and passionate then, believing love was everything and Thane was my everything.  
  
It wasn't until years later that I realized just how wrong I'd been.  
  
Later, all I remember from that afternoon was Thane arguing furiously with his mother, his face flushed red. In the end, he grabbed a knife from the bar counter and pressed it against his own throat.  
  
Leaving a clear and long blood mark, he said resolutely and firmly: ""I'm not like my father. I'm not full of tricks. In this life, I only want to be with Sophie. Mom, I hope you can accept us.""  
  
Perhaps Thane was too resolute or perhaps that streak of red was too shocking. In the end, Mrs. Cole compromised.  
  
But as she left that day, there was something in her gaze I couldn't quite understand.  
  
But I didn't understand then, I just thought every family had their issues.  
  
My parents loved each other, but they were still traditional at heart, favoring my brother over me.  
  
And Thane's parents were once a loving couple too. But the Cole family had a tradition of sponsoring underprivileged children's education.  
  
That young, timid, yet charming girl caught Mr. Cole's eye, he finally fell for her.  
  
Affairs, mistresses, more affairs, more mistresses.   
  
After tasting the sweetness of indulgence, he couldn't stop. Women came and went, each more numerous than before.  
  
A life of luxury and excess is always full of temptations. Mr. Cole, in his position of power, began to enjoy this decadence, growing more distant from Mrs. Cole.  
  
Arguments? Crying? Threats? None of it worked. They fought year after year, until one of his mistresses showed up at their door with a barely visible pregnancy bump, begging Mrs. Cole to spare her life.  
  
Thane watched his mother's tears, then looked at that woman who seemed pitiful but truly hateful. He reached out and pushed the woman down the stairs, blood staining the doorstep.  
  
Mr. Cole was furious and sent him away to attend school in his hometown.  
  
Then that's how Thane and I met, connected, and fell in love.  
  
But ultimately?  
  
Thane, who once despised homewreckers, fell in love with Lily, the scholarship student we sponsored, even buying her a million-dollar home.  
  
So it wasn't until many years later that I understood—that day, the look in Mrs. Cole's eyes wasn't born from being moved by our love or from compromise, but a pure pity.  
  
It's a family curse—like father, like son—it's a never-ending loop. She had always been warning me not to repeat her mistakes.  
  
But unfortunately—  
  
By the time I understood, it was too late.  
  
As expected, Thane didn't agree to my request for divorce.  
  
We met when we were sixteen, started dating at nineteen, married at twenty-five, had our first child at twenty-six and our second child at twenty-nine. Now at thirty-six, we were deeply intertwined, both emotionally and financially. So he refused to divorce me.  
  
A wife and children at home, a fragile lover outside—Thane wanted to maintain this arrangement.  
  
I mean, just think about it. If we divorced, those shares he gave me when he loved me most? They'd really mess him up financially and would severely weaken his position.  
  
The Cole family had ambitious illegitimate sons and Thane wasn't the only heir.  
  
But I couldn't give up everything and just leave with the children either. I must take what belongs to me.  
  
So we reached an impasse.  
  
Just like now, Thane again suggested I calm down while he took Lily away.  
  
Lily had several bloody marks on her arm. One was deep enough to expose bone—I'd cut her with the glass.  
  
Thane sighed and said: ""Sophie, stay home and calm down. We can talk about anything later.""  
  
Then he left with Lily.",1,1747035157.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False

I got a Pullman 876 basket for my Profitec Go. What motivated the purchase was the ridgeless factor for easier cleaning, but I have to say it did improve the taste. The cup is now more balance with more clarity.

Regarding the easier cleaning, I eliminated the issue of coffee stuck in the ridge, but I have now some which remain stuck at the lower edge where the wall meet the base. 

I saw in several reviews and comments that the Go produces wetter pucks, which I experience as well. This combined with the very straight walls of the Pullman 876 doesn't help in knocking the puck perfectly.

I was wondering if someone had experience comparing the Pullman and a VST or E&B B702TFH24 to see if the edge is maybe more round or the lower part more tapered to make it easier to knock the puck out ?

# Who’s Behind This Life-Organizing Magic?

Let’s start with the man of the hour—**Peter Akkies**. He’s not just another productivity guy throwing buzzwords at you. Nope. Peter is someone who’s lived the chaos, figured out a system, and then broke it down into bite-sized lessons. He’s taught thousands of people how to use **Things 3** effectively, and now he's here with his course **“Organize Your Life with Things 3 (2022) - Peter Akkies.”** Peter’s also a chill dude into scuba diving, F1, and plant-based living—so yes, he’s relatable.

# What Even Is This Course?

In plain speak: it’s a **step-by-step video course** teaching you how to use the productivity app Things 3 *without losing your mind*. If you’ve ever downloaded Things 3, stared at the interface, and then went back to sticky notes, this is for you. The course comes packed with **10 modules and 53 short, snappy lessons**, all focused on helping you tame your chaotic to-do list, from emails to errands to weekly reviews.

Oh, and there’s a super useful bonus—a 42-minute session on **turning goals into action** (that alone is worth it if you tend to “set goals” and then forget about them).

# Where Does It All Happen?

Everything is **online** and self-paced, hosted on Teachable. So you can take it from your desk, your couch, your favorite coffee shop, or even while pretending to work from home (I won’t tell). All you need is your device, Things 3 installed, and the will to get your life in order.

Peter’s course teaches you a **trustworthy workflow** that helps you cut through the noise, prioritize what matters, and actually get things done—**without burning out**. Want to feel more in control, hit your deadlines, and actually have time to breathe? That’s the “why.”

# How Does It Work?

I'm developing a concept for a new-generation hostel in central Sofia, Bulgaria — designed for digital nomads, gamers, and IT professionals. It's more than accommodation: the vision includes themed gaming rooms (retro PC lounge, PlayStation zone, high-spec gaming rigs), a coworking area, a barista coffee station, and strong support for cycling (secure bike parking, etc.).

The goal is to blend comfort, productivity, and geek culture under one roof. We've already drafted a business plan, mapped out crowdfunding/investor tiers (including non-voting profit-sharing options), and validated the core target group (ages 20–40, remote workers, tech lovers, travelers).

We're currently looking for early-stage investors, strategic partners, and people who resonate with the concept to give feedback or get involved.

I get migraines, recently up to 10 per month, which I always tag in oura when I take a triptan to stop them again. (My rate has steadily gone up over the last 7 years, I suspect due to my use of triptans.) I have spent decades failing to work out the triggers. I’d had an oura ring for a couple of years, and have always also tagged other suspected triggers like any alcohol, plane flights, extra coffees, etc.. I thought I’d use my professional skills as a data scientist to see if I could work out my triggers. I planned to analyse the data in R using a CSV export but discovered you can’t export the tags data! However, with some help from ChatGPT I wrote some code to connect to the API and fetch them. I then organised it all and fitted a logistic regression model to work out what things influence the probability that I will get a migraine on any given day.

Things I learned: My migraine likelihood is…

1.	⁠a bit higher after an alcoholic drink, especially several in a session
2.	⁠much higher on a flight
3.	⁠a bit higher after intense exercise but a bit lower after moderate exercise
4.	⁠higher if I had a migraine the day before, and also if it’s been more than a week, so they tend to come either in runs days after day, or with big gaps.
5.	⁠unaffected by my sleep quality (which surprised me because I often feel sleepy when I have a migraine, I guess that’s just a symptom rather than indicative of a cause)
6.	⁠lower on days I have an extra coffee
7.	⁠a bit lower when I tried a medicine (4mg per day of Candesartan) the doctor gave me.

Point 7 is the kicker - in the month I’d tried that medicine I still had 5 migraines so had thought it just didn’t work, but when I did a proper job of modelling all the different factors at once (which makes it possible to disentangle the various things having an effect) it was statistically significant. So I went back to the doctor, we discussed it, he gave me a higher dose (8mg, taken twice a day), and in the 4 months since I’ve had a total of 3 migraines when I would have had at least 30! And 2 of those were on days I forgot to take my pill. The doctor was also very interested in the results of my analysis - I don’t think many patients turn up with the kind of charts you see in medical research papers!",3,1747034089.0,migraine,0,1.0,False

What a terrible burden it is to want. 

After nights of waiting I found shelter in you, closed my eyes and for once I didn’t dream of monsters, the pitch black yielded stars once again and I no longer wished myself dead. That night I imagined motherhood as I stroked your hair, I listened to you breathe and watched the rise and fall of your back, felt the waves rise inside me and let myself get carried away. That night it consumed me, ate me whole leaving only a carcass of bones and matter, they even stole my heart just for good measure.

I lost my appetite, lost sleep counting myself lucky that we exist at the same time you and I. I typed out a message, stared at the screen, blinked and blinked and blinked then shook my head and all faded to white. Took a shot of vodka courage to make the journey to the great wall of blue text only to crouch behind it, cradling my knees to my chest like I did as a child, waiting for someone, anyone to tell me it gets better. It’s all wrong.

Why didn’t we wait for the buds to flower? I could stay a lifetime if you’d sit with me a little, tell me one of your stories to pass the time, I'm sorry I only have the clothes on my back to keep you warm.

If your inbox is anything like mine?

A dozen plus.

Not counting the spam box.

And while a blind squirrel finds a nut once in a while…

IMO: There’s a better way to make sales and find partners than Pitch Slapping ‘em.

…Or pitching at all.

Maybe I’ve boarded the crazy train?

I doubt anyone likes being pitched.

Hell, I doubt the people doing the pitching like it either.

If it’s a pitch…

It already implies they don't understand me or what I’m doing.

…If they did?

It’d be a recommendation.

Unfortunately…

Somewhere along the way the Pitch Slapper learned ‘this is how it’s done’... and they went with it.

The worst of it?

A pitch slap works once in a while.

Like winning on the slots.

It CAN set appointments and occasionally turns into sales.

So folks keep doing it.

BUT

…And maybe this is another crazy thought?

What if we could put together partnerships WITHOUT pitching?

Like… at all.

Instead…

Decide if we WANT to work with them.

If we do?

Graciously give them the chance to work with us.

And if we don’t?

Say goodbye and move on with our day.

Here’s how Travis explained it to a [Royalty Ronin](https://honeysyed.com/ronin) member:

*“There’s really never a pitch.*

*All I do in coffee dates (zoom calls) is get to know them a bit and see if there’s enough upside for me to want to play or not.*

*If I think there is then I just share the upside POTENTIAL I see and I offer to take on all their downside and ask them if they wanna run a test to see what the ACTUAL upside is in reality.*

*^(super)* *low stress with no pitch, pressure or convincing.”*

Pretty striking difference, isn’t it?

From - “Buy my schtuff whoever you are!”

To - “I see potential, it doesn't sound like you’re tapping. If you want? I can see how much is actually there. Without getting in the way of what you’re already doing. If it doesn’t work? You’re not out anything.”

See the difference?

One gets ignored.

The other only gets presented if we think it’s a good fit for them and US.

We’re not chasing.

We’re choosing.

We don’t need them.

We’re doing them a favor.

I detest chasing.

I enjoy doing favors that I choose.

Now…

Obviously there’s a piece of this puzzle missing.

Who should we start convo’s with?

How should we approach them without Pitch Slapping?

What will make you stand out in an inbox full of spam…

…and lead to us choosing?

Luckily

I’ve got you covered.

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** Is this thing recording me? Okay, Right, So I've been to every fucking news site and news station in this damned city, fuck, I've even gone to the press! No one will fucken listen to me!



Oh? For company policy? Fine, How do you want me to give my statement?



Oh, whatever. You know what I'm saying.



Right, right… here we go. This is my statement; I mean the story of what I found on the fucken job.

  


Today's date is 2102 October 30th, and I am a freelance hacker. Since this is where the old timers listen, I'll explain what my job does in simple terms. I don’t hack into your grandparent's accounts or your cyberware. That shit is a thing of the past. My job is hacking into big businesses… stealing from corporations who could actually deal with the loss of money and recover from it as well. This job was supposed to be like all the rest; it involved stealing information from a pharmaceutical company. I couldn't tell you what the name was. It was something generic like ""Ben's Genuine Aid"" or some shit like that.

But I digress, it was a normal job. I got an email saying, ""Steal this file from this company so we can profit,"" and I did. It was some pretty easy shit, too. I'm not going to describe how I did it, mainly because it would be too complicated for this place, but it's also a trade secret. Basically you have to drive to the place and plug into the building, simple shit right? This job started out like opening an unlocked door and walking into the room, which should have been a fucken warning. Hell, the AI I use for security didn't even go off with any warnings. I had my white rabbit programs ready just in case and went in. There was one more obstacle: a password, but that was made simple due to the decoder I had. If you're wondering, it was a firewall. This one was very strange. The binary code that I'm used to, you know the ones and zeros that constantly go over the screen, was not there. It was a bunch of nines, sixes, sevens, and eights all jumbled up to look like some thornbush from those old books. Each line overlapped the others to look like vines, flowers, and fly-trapping plants. It wasn't that difficult to get through either; it just unsettled me a bit. When I unlocked it, that’s when the nightmare started.

  


I was on the second floor in one of the waiting rooms when I heard an alarm go off and every computer went haywire. The lights went blue, green, and red; the people over the counters tried to fix them by tapping on their keyboards, and others tried turning them on and off. The same thing happened; I even saw a man attempt to smack the side of the monitor, until he saw something that made his face turn white as a ghost. He screamed for half a second and went silent. I only saw a blur and the man was headless; the body crumpled over spraying blood as it fell to the ground. His coworkers were coated in his blood, and the walls were dripping. A woman was hyperventilating until she looked at her computer screen, and something grabbed her face. It looked as if it was a lizard-like hand with code dripping off its form. It quickly jerked down, and her face ripped and peeled off her very bones, leaving behind her bloodied skull. That's when the employees started to scream and run. However the door was locked on their end. They banged and scratched at the metal door as that monstrous thing crawled out of the computer screen with some code like fluid dripping off it. An employee, an older woman that my implant informed me was 59 years old, screamed as it leaped at her and the coworkers.

I didn't get a good look at it besides the claws. That's when I ran down the stairs and out the building. I could still hear the screams of those poor people. I got into my car and started it. The glass doors in front shattered open with a loud pop, and the sound of a chittering hiss could be heard in that direction. I sped away as soon as I heard that.

  


When I got to my apartment, I had a nervous breakdown. I didn't know what that thing was; I was just there for a job to steal some damn medical codes, not unleash some fucken monster. I fully snapped out of it when I heard my stomach growl. I quickly made myself something to eat, and turned on the tv for the noise to help me relax. That's when I heard “We interrupt this broadcast for a breaking news report. There’s been a massacre at Ben's Genuine Aid Office."" I said fuck this and started planning on leaving the city; then my AI alerted me by setting off it’s security alarm.

  


For any old timers, you need alarms to make sure other hackers are not trying to steal your shit, which is weird because I am the only hacker in this district. I sent out a tracker program to see where they were coming from, and it was coming from the medical building that I just came from. Could the company be trying to find me? I am sure that I covered my tracks while hacking in. The tracker pinpointed it. The program set an avatar to represent it, and it was a fucken  flower with a creepy ass smiley face. Normally, when this happens, the hacker would stop because it usually says you've been hacked back or something along those lines; it's completely customizable; mine has one so it says, ""Do not hack me, or I will scramble your code."" Anyway, it blinked out for a good minute and before reappearing in another place. It looked to be a marketing building. That’s when it happened again.  ""We interrupt this program for an important announcement. An unknown assailant is attacking Barlin Toys Marketing. Two people have died. We will have more information as the story develops"". I was confused. It couldn't have been the same thing that was at the clinic.There was no way that anything could have been that fast. It would have blown out every window, including mine. Its avatar blinked out of the marketing building. It blinks into an abandoned robotic factory. I thought at the time, ""Why was it there? There’s nothing within that building."" It blinked about five blocks from my apartment…I should be able to see what was coming, by hacking into the cameras. What I saw was a man in his mid 50’s, watching something on the television, his face seemed to show confusion, but quickly came to fear that when I saw those monstrous claws come into view and I shut off the camera before seeing anything else. I quickly realized it was coming for me because all those places were on the way to my apartment. I was about to have another panic attack, I needed to calm myself down otherwise it would be all over, otherwise I wouldn't be here talking to some out-dated piece of shit machine.

  


My white rabbit programs were still primed and ready; I never turned them off until two days had passed, a precaution due to my profession. I sent one of them out, as far away from me as possible. How these programs work is I choose a place to deploy them, and it runs away from the network I'm using, which happens to be a whole district. I saw its avatar chase it, and was able to take a deep breath. I knew I couldn't stay there, but now I wanted answers. What the fuck is this thing, and why would someone even fucken make this? I sent a tracker program to the pharmacy to find their main office. It took several minutes, as I watched the monster chase the white rabbit through abandoned buildings, apartments, churches, and even a school; thank God it was at night. My device beeped, letting me know that it got the address. It was 98448 on Crystal Road.That's about 7 miles away; that should've been an easy drive if my white rabbit program didn't get caught. Now that monster is coming straight for me again, even faster this time. I grabbed my pistol out from my bedside table and fumbled my keys trying to pick them up, but it was right on top of me according to the avatar. I loaded my pistol and looked at my computer, which was on the desk close to my bedroom door. I aimed my pistol at the computer because that seems to be where the avatar was, as I slowly tried to sneak by my computer.

Each step was agonizing. I am still unsure why I never just ran out of the room, I might’ve had a better chance of escaping. I was halfway to the door, that's when the fucken thing came out of my damned computer.

  


Even though I saw it come out of a computer twice, it was still hard to believe that it wasn’t a trick. I watched as a claude finger began poking out of my monitor. It started to curl its finger around the edge of the monitor as if it was trying to hold on. That familiar clawed hand reached out of the screen. Its elongated and scaled covered limb quickly grabbed the desk and dragged itself out of the screen; first was the shoulder, which was covered in black feathered like fur; next was its head. I'm not entirely sure what I was looking at. It seemed to be angulared like a large lizard, covered in black feathery fur, with large teeth like a wolf, but its eyes were strange. It was neon green, with a crossed shaped pupil surrounded by a circle. Inside the circle it was violet purple. It's something that I could never forget: its eyes. It was trying to climb out, but my monitor was significantly smaller than the man’s TV; but it was slowly climbing out. I saw its other shoulder begin to squeeze through. I didn't get to see the rest of it because I shot it in its head. The bullet didn’t penetrate it’s scaled like skin, instead it ricocheted off of it, so I ran towards the door; it tried to swipe at me, but it was trapped, so I ran out of my room, and out my front door into the hallway. I ran as fast as I could, not caring who was opening doors to ask what was going on; I even ran into a green-suited man with a mask of a squid painted on it. I remember him saying, ""Sorry, ma'am, I didn't mean to get in your way."" That's when I heard screaming and saw the monster on the ceiling. It was using its two sharp claws to crawl, and pull its slithering snake body along the ceiling. Without a second thought, I just grabbed the man and pushed him  towards the monster and ran. Although thinking about it now, I don't think I heard him scream. He was really nice with the one interaction. Anyway, I finally got to my car and floored it. I thought I saw it coming out of the apartment building thanks to my rearview mirror, but it was going too fast for me to see properly. While driving I put in the coordinates for the main office using my implant, but that's when I heard my alarms go off again. It was following me, and it was heading straight for my car. Luckily, I use an older car where it is not electric, so I just had to turn off my car’s computer. I am grateful that I didn't buy those new fucken cars where AI runs them, I would've been a dead woman by now. It was still tracking me, keeping one eye on the road and tracking the monster through the circuits; it looked like it was going from every device that it could get through. It was quickly gaining on me. Suddenly it went past me. At the time, I thought I was clear, off the hook, I could mosey on down to the primary office… it's never that simple.

  


I was calm at this time, thought I got off the hook until I saw its avatar in one of those fucken AI cars, a Subaru X 143, an ugly fucking car and too damn small for anyone to fit in. As I was driving past it, I saw the wolfish grin of the monster. It burst out of the car, landing and clinging onto mine like a damn chameleon. Due to the impact I swerved a bit. They tried breaking my window with one of its claws, thankfully I got my car custom-made with bulletproof glass, but it was still able to scratch my windshield. That's when I grabbed my pistol and started shooting blindly at the roof of my car. I think I may have been able to injure it because I heard this pained screech. That's when I saw its club shaped tail as it slammed onto the passenger side of my car with a loud crunch, making me almost lose control. It was as if another car had hit my side.

That's when I heard a clunk coming from the top right. When I looked up, I saw a couple its teeth had pierced the roof. I think it's trying to bite my roof off; I was completely wrong when I saw the front teeth come crashing down onto my windshield over and over again. It only took a few tries before its teeth stopped scratching my windshield and actually pierced it. Its black tongue with a slight fork was trailing around the windshield. It pulled it head up as it ripped my windshield off tossing it behind us shattering upon impact. This monster looked dead on at me from almost a 90° angle. That's when I had an idea. I lifted my pistol and aimed for its throat as it opened its mouth to try and bite me. It was hard to keep my hands steady, and its tail was trying to run me off the road. I fired one shot, and it actually fucken hit! The monster made a sound of pain and anger, and its tail hit my car again,  harder than before. It actually made a significant dent into the door. We started to spin, but I realized what road we were on. We were approaching an intersection, and the light was about to turn red. I only had one chance to do this. Somehow, I was able to regain control of my car again. That's when it dug its claw into the side closest to me, and it looked directly at me. It made a deep bone chilling growl that made the hairs on my body stand up. This thing was fucken pissed and hurt. It was about to try to rip the door off, but that's when I blew through the stoplight, and a semi truck who wasn’t paying attention rammed into us hitting more of the monster than the car as it flipped and rolled. I am glad I paid for the upgrades on that car. It was totaled. It hurt like hell, but thankfully I was fine, this is why you always wear a seatbelt. 



I crawled out of the car from the windshield, I looked around and aimed my gun looking for the monster, but I didn’t see it in the aftermath. I'm not sure, but I think I might have sustained a concussion, my head got reinforced when I got the implants, so maybe not. The truck driver was concerned about me and my well-being, I can't remember what I said to him. I'm pretty sure it was something along the lines of, ""I'm fine, Don't worry about it, not gonna press charges,"" something along those lines. I didn't stick around because a multi-billionaire will pay for a new car for me. So when his back was turned, I quickly walked away.

  


I was about forty-five feet from the office and could see the building. It was in the new style that all billionaires liked, with plants all over it thinking they’re helping the air quality; I guess this one had a green thumb. I checked the networks to see if I could find the monster's avatar anywhere. Nothing was on the radar, so I kept walking while keeping my ear and eye out for anything. Throughout that time, the main problem was that there was a breeze. That stopped when I got to the building. Weirdly, no one was around, not even a receptionist to greet me; the front door was also unlocked.There was an AI, but it was a simple one that popped up with an arrow pointing at an elevator; it was green with roses on it. I didn't think much about it. I got into the elevator; it was nothing special, it had a wallpaper of foliage; besides that, it was normal. The doors closed and the elevator began moving without me pushing any buttons. It seemed to be taking me to the penthouse, the top floor. 



I am not a religious person. What I saw on that floor made me question everything.



The elevator opened and I walked out as I saw a woman who was ten feet tall, wearing a white nightgown with green, red, and blue flowers that was interwoven into the fabric; it was beautiful. That's when my implant shorted out, and had to turn it off due to the age counter being unable to determine her age. She was staring at a plant, mumbling to herself. She sounded like she was speaking in multiple languages. I caught some things she was saying.

**\*\*The Woman\*\*** ""Death, my children, eating, slaving."" Then she looked at me. I was used to taking a beating, thus why I made sure to get a strong implant. I was used to people with speed implants and even other hackers, but this woman was on a whole new fucken level. She grabbed me by the neck. I could barely get any air.  She screamed loudly in a way that I could barely hear her. I remember her saying.

**\*\*The Woman\*\*** ""What are you doing here?! Here to take me! Take me to your filthy, unholy landfills! Why couldn't you just be good?! Why must you hurt? Why must you hate?"" I got a good look at her face.

Her left side was charred and scarred, like someone had placed half of her face in a fire. Her other side looked to be in her late 30s. I could say she was the most beautiful woman that I have seen despite the bruns and scars. She was angry and had a murderous grip on my throat. She was probably about to snap my neck until I heard another voice. It was a man's voice. I was about to blackout, but I believe, with a silky but calm tone, the man said,

**\*\*The man\*\***""Darling, please, it's time for bed. I'll take care of this for you. Please drop this girl.""  She could have been a bit more gentle about it instead of throwing me against the wall knocking the wind from me. I was trying to catch my breath, and that’s when the man leaned over me and spoke with that same silky, smooth voice.

**\*\*The man\*\*** ""Are you OK? My wife hasn't been the same since the children of this land stopped caring about her plants."" I think that is what he said.

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""She’s an asshole"" I said through gasping breaths

**\*\*The man\*\*** ""Validated but rude."" He stood up, he seemed to be just as tall if not taller than that woman and left the hallway. I slowly got up, wanting to give him a piece of my mind. I started walking

**\*\*The man\*\*** ""I'm in the living room on your right."" I heard the voice and saw him in his living room, making himself a drink from his large bar. He asked if I wanted Anything, and I simply stared daggers at him. He shrugged and sat down on a built-in couch in the living room.

**\*\*The man\*\*** ""What are you doing here at this hour? I'm sure we didn't set up an appointment together."" he took a sip of his drink. I stayed silent and walked in front of him. He was clearly in his 40s and was built like a bodybuilder with a massive white beard, a full head of hair, and two golden eyes.

**\*\*The man\*\*** ""So the strong sound type, then? Luckily, I like the sound of my own voice. I think introductions are in order. You can call me Mr. Golden Eyes. Do you have a name, I prefer last names?"" I gave him my name, which I will not give here. I will say hacker for me from now on.

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""That's a lovely name, Hacker,"" he said in a jovial tone, 

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Now that introductions are done. Why are you here? I'm pretty sure you're not here to talk to my wife,"" he said with a chuckle

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""I'm here because I accidentally unleashed a monster upon the world from your fucken company. Luckily, I already killed it. I want answers now!”  He was taking a sip of his drink as he looked at me. 

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Monster? Oh? Oooh, I know what you're talking about now. Yeah, that isn't a monster."" he said with a nonchalant tone. I looked at him puzzled.

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""That's an extinct species of the Animal Kingdom.""

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""Come again?""

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Yeah, it was recreated from evolution. I believe it evolved from the Pygopodidae or as you would know them as legless lizards. This one just happened to develop legs in its evolution"" He said with a tone of excitement.

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""So you're telling me you created a giant killer snake for a pharmaceutical company?!"" I said in exasperation.

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Yeah, that's the front,"" he said calmly. “I guess technically I did make it or at least accelerated. It's evolution."" my eyes grew wide

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""But why?!""

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Oh, Apologies. I did it because humans don't have any natural predators anymore, so I thought I would help bring one in"" he said in a casual tone.

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""So you're a psycho then.""

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""No, I am completely sane. It's in my nature."" 

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""You just told me that you're making monsters to eat people."" 

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Yes, because one species needs at least one predator to keep down their numbers. If not, its environment will suffer for it. Why do you think my wife is so angry?""

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""Because she's a crazy psychotic bitch with too many implants in her."" he laughed

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""No, no, no, nothing of the sort. It's because she created the environment. That's why she's so angry."" I was silent because I thought I was talking to a crazy person—a huge fucken crazy person

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""OK, you don't believe me. Let me show you.""

He picked up a medium-sized potted plant, but it looked small in his hand.

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Right, you see this?"" I nodded.

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""This is Sawgrass, and it will, in a matter of moments, have the traits of a Venus flytrap."" Nothing happened for at least a minute; I was about to say something. Until the plant started to grow petals and then mouths like a Venus flytrap. I stammered out.

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""Eh, The fuck?! how?""

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Well, my dear, it's called conversion evolution. It's where two animal species having the same evolutionary niches; think sharks and dolphins, for instance."" I stopped him before he could explain more, mainly because I already knew this.

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""No, how did you do that?!"" I motioned towards the plant

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Well, I'll say this: it wasn't easy. Sawgrass and venus flytraps have different niches.However if you really want the answer, I created the concept of evolution. I still remember the day when I put the chemicals in to make your ancestors."" I couldn’t believe what I was hearing

 **\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""You're telling me that you are god?"" he burst out laughing.

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Technically yes, but technically no. I would say it's more of a hobby. To which fact: I can do this too."" he pointed his finger at me, turned on my implant, and spoke through it without moving his lips.

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Anything that my creations make, I can control it. Before you ask it, it's all in the radio waves and things you wouldn't even be able to understand."" 



I still had my gun. I looked at the counter and had one bullet left. I shot him in the head. His head went back onto the couch. I was shocked mainly because of how easy it was to shoot “god” in the head. I looked to my right, and I saw his wife looking at me with two piercing glowing green eyes and a very angry expression on her face. Then Mr. Golden Eye's hand slowly went up towards his head with his thumb and index finger as they got thinner going towards his forehead where I shot him. I heard something wet as he pulled out the bullet from his head. His wife spoke with what sounded a deep growl. 

**\*\*The Woman\*\*** ""You should've let me kill it."" Mr. Golden eyes lifted his head, looking at the bullet and quickly flicking it off into the corner.

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Honey, I said I would take care of it… Please go to bed,"" he said, slightly annoyed.

**\*\*The Woman\*\*** ""I want to stay to see what happens next."" She said in that same deep growl.

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Ok fine, but let me take care of it,"" he said in a defeated tone. She stayed quiet, just staring at me.



**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Right now, what I will do because you were rude, and made quite a mess behind me. I will let you go with a quarter of a million for whatever you want to do because I'm feeling generous. You can use that money to tell everyone what you saw. Right now, from what I saw on the News, they're saying it's a terrorist that attacked my pharmacy, but I know exactly what it is, and you know as well.""

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""Isn't it just a giant lizard snake thing, and seriously? A quarter of a million?"" I said, confused and surprised.

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""It's related to them. But what do you say? Would you like an answer of what the creature is?""

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""Fuck it, why not, take it away I guess.""

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""So there was an Aztec god called Quetzalcoatl. This creature was linked to this God. But it was an entire species of giant, flying, feathered lizards that lost their back legs during its evolution; they were called Amphiptere. Sadly, they went extinct because they had no megafauna to hunt. They would become smaller and smaller until they became the Pygopodidae or at least a variant of them. However, one group split off because they adapted a new trait, a bizarre trait that could go through sound and code. This was very useful until one of them went deeper and became something called a Basilisk. It was a brilliant creature with one problem; he couldn't feed normally. He fed on knowledge and awareness of it. I believe you will know this one very well.""

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""Roko's Basilisk?"" I said with a slight tremor. He grinned and said.

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""The very one. He nearly died when people began to figure him out and stopped researching and forgetting about it. With that its food source was limited. There's more to it, but that's the most straightforward way to say what happened to him.I believe you're a smart girl, and obviously you already researched him.

Fast forward 50 years. My poor wife was very sick, and still is. She was crying and bawling, saying that they're killing my creations; why would they do this? So I told her I would take care of it, creating Rex Lacertarum Digitalis or the Digital lizard king.""

I was speechless; I felt like I was going crazy from what I was hearing.

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""I can see the look in your eyes. I would say take the money and live off grid. I believe an old friend is gonna stop by and say hi roundabout now."" he said, pointing his finger at his TV.

I quickly moved out of the way as the slithering monster fell out of the TV and onto the floor. It looked like half of his body was broken, which was most likely the case with the semi. It stared daggers into me as it crawled itself to Mr. Golden eyes. He put down his drink on his coffee table and started comforting it. 

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""I know, I know, it hurts, but don't worry, you'll be healed up soon, and hey, for being such a good boy, why not give you a couple of friends?"" he said in a loving voice. The woman was still keeping an eye on me occasionally, glancing at the monster. This went on for about two minutes until, eventually, I said. 

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""Fine, but I'll take your money.""

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Wonderful! Honestly, I don't need money. Here, you can take all of it home if you want.""

He gave me over $25 billion. When I saw this, I became dizzy from the amount of money in my account. I looked at him and said,

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""We will not meet again."" The woman moved towards the couch and said nothing while still giving me that death glare. Mr. Golden Eyes was not really paying attention and just said,

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Yes, yes, have a good life and make the fortunes of evolution be ever in your favor.""



I walked out of the building, bought myself a new car, and started driving around to new stations, and that's how I got here. Telling old people that monsters exist. That's the end of my station statement.

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  


**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""Right now, how the fuck am I supposed to?""

**\*\*Stranger\*\*** ""Excuse me, Miss?""

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""Look, I told you, people, this is a shitty, oh… oh shit. I'm sorry for pushing you into that monster.""

**\*\*Stranger\*\*** ""Oh no, it's completely fine; see, I wasn’t hurt at all. I was going to your apartment to ask you something, though.

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""Fucken creepy but, I guess that's fine. What can I do for you?""

**\*\*Stranger\*\*** ""I would love for you to work for me.""

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""We will have to see about that, let's talk about the details outside.""

**\*\*Stranger\*\*** ""Oh yes, let's go.""

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""What's your name, by the way?""

**\*\*Stranger\*\*** ""Oh, I'm just a friend of a friend, twice removed.""

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** Is this thing recording me? Okay, Right, So I've been to every fucking news site and news station in this damned city, fuck, I've even gone to the press! No one will fucken listen to me!



Oh? For company policy? Fine, How do you want me to give my statement?



Oh, whatever. You know what I'm saying.



Right, right… here we go. This is my statement; I mean the story of what I found on the fucken job.

  


Today's date is 2102 October 30th, and I am a freelance hacker. Since this is where the old timers listen, I'll explain what my job does in simple terms. I don’t hack into your grandparent's accounts or your cyberware. That shit is a thing of the past. My job is hacking into big businesses… stealing from corporations who could actually deal with the loss of money and recover from it as well. This job was supposed to be like all the rest; it involved stealing information from a pharmaceutical company. I couldn't tell you what the name was. It was something generic like ""Ben's Genuine Aid"" or some shit like that.

But I digress, it was a normal job. I got an email saying, ""Steal this file from this company so we can profit,"" and I did. It was some pretty easy shit, too. I'm not going to describe how I did it, mainly because it would be too complicated for this place, but it's also a trade secret. Basically you have to drive to the place and plug into the building, simple shit right? This job started out like opening an unlocked door and walking into the room, which should have been a fucken warning. Hell, the AI I use for security didn't even go off with any warnings. I had my white rabbit programs ready just in case and went in. There was one more obstacle: a password, but that was made simple due to the decoder I had. If you're wondering, it was a firewall. This one was very strange. The binary code that I'm used to, you know the ones and zeros that constantly go over the screen, was not there. It was a bunch of nines, sixes, sevens, and eights all jumbled up to look like some thornbush from those old books. Each line overlapped the others to look like vines, flowers, and fly-trapping plants. It wasn't that difficult to get through either; it just unsettled me a bit. When I unlocked it, that’s when the nightmare started.

  


I was on the second floor in one of the waiting rooms when I heard an alarm go off and every computer went haywire. The lights went blue, green, and red; the people over the counters tried to fix them by tapping on their keyboards, and others tried turning them on and off. The same thing happened; I even saw a man attempt to smack the side of the monitor, until he saw something that made his face turn white as a ghost. He screamed for half a second and went silent. I only saw a blur and the man was headless; the body crumpled over spraying blood as it fell to the ground. His coworkers were coated in his blood, and the walls were dripping. A woman was hyperventilating until she looked at her computer screen, and something grabbed her face. It looked as if it was a lizard-like hand with code dripping off its form. It quickly jerked down, and her face ripped and peeled off her very bones, leaving behind her bloodied skull. That's when the employees started to scream and run. However the door was locked on their end. They banged and scratched at the metal door as that monstrous thing crawled out of the computer screen with some code like fluid dripping off it. An employee, an older woman that my implant informed me was 59 years old, screamed as it leaped at her and the coworkers.

I didn't get a good look at it besides the claws. That's when I ran down the stairs and out the building. I could still hear the screams of those poor people. I got into my car and started it. The glass doors in front shattered open with a loud pop, and the sound of a chittering hiss could be heard in that direction. I sped away as soon as I heard that.

  


When I got to my apartment, I had a nervous breakdown. I didn't know what that thing was; I was just there for a job to steal some damn medical codes, not unleash some fucken monster. I fully snapped out of it when I heard my stomach growl. I quickly made myself something to eat, and turned on the tv for the noise to help me relax. That's when I heard “We interrupt this broadcast for a breaking news report. There’s been a massacre at Ben's Genuine Aid Office."" I said fuck this and started planning on leaving the city; then my AI alerted me by setting off it’s security alarm.

  


For any old timers, you need alarms to make sure other hackers are not trying to steal your shit, which is weird because I am the only hacker in this district. I sent out a tracker program to see where they were coming from, and it was coming from the medical building that I just came from. Could the company be trying to find me? I am sure that I covered my tracks while hacking in. The tracker pinpointed it. The program set an avatar to represent it, and it was a fucken  flower with a creepy ass smiley face. Normally, when this happens, the hacker would stop because it usually says you've been hacked back or something along those lines; it's completely customizable; mine has one so it says, ""Do not hack me, or I will scramble your code."" Anyway, it blinked out for a good minute and before reappearing in another place. It looked to be a marketing building. That’s when it happened again.  ""We interrupt this program for an important announcement. An unknown assailant is attacking Barlin Toys Marketing. Two people have died. We will have more information as the story develops"". I was confused. It couldn't have been the same thing that was at the clinic.There was no way that anything could have been that fast. It would have blown out every window, including mine. Its avatar blinked out of the marketing building. It blinks into an abandoned robotic factory. I thought at the time, ""Why was it there? There’s nothing within that building."" It blinked about five blocks from my apartment…I should be able to see what was coming, by hacking into the cameras. What I saw was a man in his mid 50’s, watching something on the television, his face seemed to show confusion, but quickly came to fear that when I saw those monstrous claws come into view and I shut off the camera before seeing anything else. I quickly realized it was coming for me because all those places were on the way to my apartment. I was about to have another panic attack, I needed to calm myself down otherwise it would be all over, otherwise I wouldn't be here talking to some out-dated piece of shit machine.

  


My white rabbit programs were still primed and ready; I never turned them off until two days had passed, a precaution due to my profession. I sent one of them out, as far away from me as possible. How these programs work is I choose a place to deploy them, and it runs away from the network I'm using, which happens to be a whole district. I saw its avatar chase it, and was able to take a deep breath. I knew I couldn't stay there, but now I wanted answers. What the fuck is this thing, and why would someone even fucken make this? I sent a tracker program to the pharmacy to find their main office. It took several minutes, as I watched the monster chase the white rabbit through abandoned buildings, apartments, churches, and even a school; thank God it was at night. My device beeped, letting me know that it got the address. It was 98448 on Crystal Road.That's about 7 miles away; that should've been an easy drive if my white rabbit program didn't get caught. Now that monster is coming straight for me again, even faster this time. I grabbed my pistol out from my bedside table and fumbled my keys trying to pick them up, but it was right on top of me according to the avatar. I loaded my pistol and looked at my computer, which was on the desk close to my bedroom door. I aimed my pistol at the computer because that seems to be where the avatar was, as I slowly tried to sneak by my computer.

Each step was agonizing. I am still unsure why I never just ran out of the room, I might’ve had a better chance of escaping. I was halfway to the door, that's when the fucken thing came out of my damned computer.

  


Even though I saw it come out of a computer twice, it was still hard to believe that it wasn’t a trick. I watched as a claude finger began poking out of my monitor. It started to curl its finger around the edge of the monitor as if it was trying to hold on. That familiar clawed hand reached out of the screen. Its elongated and scaled covered limb quickly grabbed the desk and dragged itself out of the screen; first was the shoulder, which was covered in black feathered like fur; next was its head. I'm not entirely sure what I was looking at. It seemed to be angulared like a large lizard, covered in black feathery fur, with large teeth like a wolf, but its eyes were strange. It was neon green, with a crossed shaped pupil surrounded by a circle. Inside the circle it was violet purple. It's something that I could never forget: its eyes. It was trying to climb out, but my monitor was significantly smaller than the man’s TV; but it was slowly climbing out. I saw its other shoulder begin to squeeze through. I didn't get to see the rest of it because I shot it in its head. The bullet didn’t penetrate it’s scaled like skin, instead it ricocheted off of it, so I ran towards the door; it tried to swipe at me, but it was trapped, so I ran out of my room, and out my front door into the hallway. I ran as fast as I could, not caring who was opening doors to ask what was going on; I even ran into a green-suited man with a mask of a squid painted on it. I remember him saying, ""Sorry, ma'am, I didn't mean to get in your way."" That's when I heard screaming and saw the monster on the ceiling. It was using its two sharp claws to crawl, and pull its slithering snake body along the ceiling. Without a second thought, I just grabbed the man and pushed him  towards the monster and ran. Although thinking about it now, I don't think I heard him scream. He was really nice with the one interaction. Anyway, I finally got to my car and floored it. I thought I saw it coming out of the apartment building thanks to my rearview mirror, but it was going too fast for me to see properly. While driving I put in the coordinates for the main office using my implant, but that's when I heard my alarms go off again. It was following me, and it was heading straight for my car. Luckily, I use an older car where it is not electric, so I just had to turn off my car’s computer. I am grateful that I didn't buy those new fucken cars where AI runs them, I would've been a dead woman by now. It was still tracking me, keeping one eye on the road and tracking the monster through the circuits; it looked like it was going from every device that it could get through. It was quickly gaining on me. Suddenly it went past me. At the time, I thought I was clear, off the hook, I could mosey on down to the primary office… it's never that simple.

  


I was calm at this time, thought I got off the hook until I saw its avatar in one of those fucken AI cars, a Subaru X 143, an ugly fucking car and too damn small for anyone to fit in. As I was driving past it, I saw the wolfish grin of the monster. It burst out of the car, landing and clinging onto mine like a damn chameleon. Due to the impact I swerved a bit. They tried breaking my window with one of its claws, thankfully I got my car custom-made with bulletproof glass, but it was still able to scratch my windshield. That's when I grabbed my pistol and started shooting blindly at the roof of my car. I think I may have been able to injure it because I heard this pained screech. That's when I saw its club shaped tail as it slammed onto the passenger side of my car with a loud crunch, making me almost lose control. It was as if another car had hit my side.

That's when I heard a clunk coming from the top right. When I looked up, I saw a couple its teeth had pierced the roof. I think it's trying to bite my roof off; I was completely wrong when I saw the front teeth come crashing down onto my windshield over and over again. It only took a few tries before its teeth stopped scratching my windshield and actually pierced it. Its black tongue with a slight fork was trailing around the windshield. It pulled it head up as it ripped my windshield off tossing it behind us shattering upon impact. This monster looked dead on at me from almost a 90° angle. That's when I had an idea. I lifted my pistol and aimed for its throat as it opened its mouth to try and bite me. It was hard to keep my hands steady, and its tail was trying to run me off the road. I fired one shot, and it actually fucken hit! The monster made a sound of pain and anger, and its tail hit my car again,  harder than before. It actually made a significant dent into the door. We started to spin, but I realized what road we were on. We were approaching an intersection, and the light was about to turn red. I only had one chance to do this. Somehow, I was able to regain control of my car again. That's when it dug its claw into the side closest to me, and it looked directly at me. It made a deep bone chilling growl that made the hairs on my body stand up. This thing was fucken pissed and hurt. It was about to try to rip the door off, but that's when I blew through the stoplight, and a semi truck who wasn’t paying attention rammed into us hitting more of the monster than the car as it flipped and rolled. I am glad I paid for the upgrades on that car. It was totaled. It hurt like hell, but thankfully I was fine, this is why you always wear a seatbelt. 



I crawled out of the car from the windshield, I looked around and aimed my gun looking for the monster, but I didn’t see it in the aftermath. I'm not sure, but I think I might have sustained a concussion, my head got reinforced when I got the implants, so maybe not. The truck driver was concerned about me and my well-being, I can't remember what I said to him. I'm pretty sure it was something along the lines of, ""I'm fine, Don't worry about it, not gonna press charges,"" something along those lines. I didn't stick around because a multi-billionaire will pay for a new car for me. So when his back was turned, I quickly walked away.

  


I was about forty-five feet from the office and could see the building. It was in the new style that all billionaires liked, with plants all over it thinking they’re helping the air quality; I guess this one had a green thumb. I checked the networks to see if I could find the monster's avatar anywhere. Nothing was on the radar, so I kept walking while keeping my ear and eye out for anything. Throughout that time, the main problem was that there was a breeze. That stopped when I got to the building. Weirdly, no one was around, not even a receptionist to greet me; the front door was also unlocked.There was an AI, but it was a simple one that popped up with an arrow pointing at an elevator; it was green with roses on it. I didn't think much about it. I got into the elevator; it was nothing special, it had a wallpaper of foliage; besides that, it was normal. The doors closed and the elevator began moving without me pushing any buttons. It seemed to be taking me to the penthouse, the top floor. 



I am not a religious person. What I saw on that floor made me question everything.



The elevator opened and I walked out as I saw a woman who was ten feet tall, wearing a white nightgown with green, red, and blue flowers that was interwoven into the fabric; it was beautiful. That's when my implant shorted out, and had to turn it off due to the age counter being unable to determine her age. She was staring at a plant, mumbling to herself. She sounded like she was speaking in multiple languages. I caught some things she was saying.

**\*\*The Woman\*\*** ""Death, my children, eating, slaving."" Then she looked at me. I was used to taking a beating, thus why I made sure to get a strong implant. I was used to people with speed implants and even other hackers, but this woman was on a whole new fucken level. She grabbed me by the neck. I could barely get any air.  She screamed loudly in a way that I could barely hear her. I remember her saying.

**\*\*The Woman\*\*** ""What are you doing here?! Here to take me! Take me to your filthy, unholy landfills! Why couldn't you just be good?! Why must you hurt? Why must you hate?"" I got a good look at her face.

Her left side was charred and scarred, like someone had placed half of her face in a fire. Her other side looked to be in her late 30s. I could say she was the most beautiful woman that I have seen despite the bruns and scars. She was angry and had a murderous grip on my throat. She was probably about to snap my neck until I heard another voice. It was a man's voice. I was about to blackout, but I believe, with a silky but calm tone, the man said,

**\*\*The man\*\***""Darling, please, it's time for bed. I'll take care of this for you. Please drop this girl.""  She could have been a bit more gentle about it instead of throwing me against the wall knocking the wind from me. I was trying to catch my breath, and that’s when the man leaned over me and spoke with that same silky, smooth voice.

**\*\*The man\*\*** ""Are you OK? My wife hasn't been the same since the children of this land stopped caring about her plants."" I think that is what he said.

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""She’s an asshole"" I said through gasping breaths

**\*\*The man\*\*** ""Validated but rude."" He stood up, he seemed to be just as tall if not taller than that woman and left the hallway. I slowly got up, wanting to give him a piece of my mind. I started walking

**\*\*The man\*\*** ""I'm in the living room on your right."" I heard the voice and saw him in his living room, making himself a drink from his large bar. He asked if I wanted Anything, and I simply stared daggers at him. He shrugged and sat down on a built-in couch in the living room.

**\*\*The man\*\*** ""What are you doing here at this hour? I'm sure we didn't set up an appointment together."" he took a sip of his drink. I stayed silent and walked in front of him. He was clearly in his 40s and was built like a bodybuilder with a massive white beard, a full head of hair, and two golden eyes.

**\*\*The man\*\*** ""So the strong sound type, then? Luckily, I like the sound of my own voice. I think introductions are in order. You can call me Mr. Golden Eyes. Do you have a name, I prefer last names?"" I gave him my name, which I will not give here. I will say hacker for me from now on.

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""That's a lovely name, Hacker,"" he said in a jovial tone, 

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Now that introductions are done. Why are you here? I'm pretty sure you're not here to talk to my wife,"" he said with a chuckle

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""I'm here because I accidentally unleashed a monster upon the world from your fucken company. Luckily, I already killed it. I want answers now!”  He was taking a sip of his drink as he looked at me. 

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Monster? Oh? Oooh, I know what you're talking about now. Yeah, that isn't a monster."" he said with a nonchalant tone. I looked at him puzzled.

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""That's an extinct species of the Animal Kingdom.""

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""Come again?""

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Yeah, it was recreated from evolution. I believe it evolved from the Pygopodidae or as you would know them as legless lizards. This one just happened to develop legs in its evolution"" He said with a tone of excitement.

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""So you're telling me you created a giant killer snake for a pharmaceutical company?!"" I said in exasperation.

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Yeah, that's the front,"" he said calmly. “I guess technically I did make it or at least accelerated. It's evolution."" my eyes grew wide

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""But why?!""

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Oh, Apologies. I did it because humans don't have any natural predators anymore, so I thought I would help bring one in"" he said in a casual tone.

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""So you're a psycho then.""

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""No, I am completely sane. It's in my nature."" 

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""You just told me that you're making monsters to eat people."" 

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Yes, because one species needs at least one predator to keep down their numbers. If not, its environment will suffer for it. Why do you think my wife is so angry?""

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""Because she's a crazy psychotic bitch with too many implants in her."" he laughed

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""No, no, no, nothing of the sort. It's because she created the environment. That's why she's so angry."" I was silent because I thought I was talking to a crazy person—a huge fucken crazy person

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""OK, you don't believe me. Let me show you.""

He picked up a medium-sized potted plant, but it looked small in his hand.

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Right, you see this?"" I nodded.

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""This is Sawgrass, and it will, in a matter of moments, have the traits of a Venus flytrap."" Nothing happened for at least a minute; I was about to say something. Until the plant started to grow petals and then mouths like a Venus flytrap. I stammered out.

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""Eh, The fuck?! how?""

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Well, my dear, it's called conversion evolution. It's where two animal species having the same evolutionary niches; think sharks and dolphins, for instance."" I stopped him before he could explain more, mainly because I already knew this.

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""No, how did you do that?!"" I motioned towards the plant

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Well, I'll say this: it wasn't easy. Sawgrass and venus flytraps have different niches.However if you really want the answer, I created the concept of evolution. I still remember the day when I put the chemicals in to make your ancestors."" I couldn’t believe what I was hearing

 **\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""You're telling me that you are god?"" he burst out laughing.

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Technically yes, but technically no. I would say it's more of a hobby. To which fact: I can do this too."" he pointed his finger at me, turned on my implant, and spoke through it without moving his lips.

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Anything that my creations make, I can control it. Before you ask it, it's all in the radio waves and things you wouldn't even be able to understand."" 



I still had my gun. I looked at the counter and had one bullet left. I shot him in the head. His head went back onto the couch. I was shocked mainly because of how easy it was to shoot “god” in the head. I looked to my right, and I saw his wife looking at me with two piercing glowing green eyes and a very angry expression on her face. Then Mr. Golden Eye's hand slowly went up towards his head with his thumb and index finger as they got thinner going towards his forehead where I shot him. I heard something wet as he pulled out the bullet from his head. His wife spoke with what sounded a deep growl. 

**\*\*The Woman\*\*** ""You should've let me kill it."" Mr. Golden eyes lifted his head, looking at the bullet and quickly flicking it off into the corner.

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Honey, I said I would take care of it… Please go to bed,"" he said, slightly annoyed.

**\*\*The Woman\*\*** ""I want to stay to see what happens next."" She said in that same deep growl.

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Ok fine, but let me take care of it,"" he said in a defeated tone. She stayed quiet, just staring at me.



**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Right now, what I will do because you were rude, and made quite a mess behind me. I will let you go with a quarter of a million for whatever you want to do because I'm feeling generous. You can use that money to tell everyone what you saw. Right now, from what I saw on the News, they're saying it's a terrorist that attacked my pharmacy, but I know exactly what it is, and you know as well.""

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""Isn't it just a giant lizard snake thing, and seriously? A quarter of a million?"" I said, confused and surprised.

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""It's related to them. But what do you say? Would you like an answer of what the creature is?""

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""Fuck it, why not, take it away I guess.""

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""So there was an Aztec god called Quetzalcoatl. This creature was linked to this God. But it was an entire species of giant, flying, feathered lizards that lost their back legs during its evolution; they were called Amphiptere. Sadly, they went extinct because they had no megafauna to hunt. They would become smaller and smaller until they became the Pygopodidae or at least a variant of them. However, one group split off because they adapted a new trait, a bizarre trait that could go through sound and code. This was very useful until one of them went deeper and became something called a Basilisk. It was a brilliant creature with one problem; he couldn't feed normally. He fed on knowledge and awareness of it. I believe you will know this one very well.""

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""Roko's Basilisk?"" I said with a slight tremor. He grinned and said.

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""The very one. He nearly died when people began to figure him out and stopped researching and forgetting about it. With that its food source was limited. There's more to it, but that's the most straightforward way to say what happened to him.I believe you're a smart girl, and obviously you already researched him.

Fast forward 50 years. My poor wife was very sick, and still is. She was crying and bawling, saying that they're killing my creations; why would they do this? So I told her I would take care of it, creating Rex Lacertarum Digitalis or the Digital lizard king.""

I was speechless; I felt like I was going crazy from what I was hearing.

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""I can see the look in your eyes. I would say take the money and live off grid. I believe an old friend is gonna stop by and say hi roundabout now."" he said, pointing his finger at his TV.

I quickly moved out of the way as the slithering monster fell out of the TV and onto the floor. It looked like half of his body was broken, which was most likely the case with the semi. It stared daggers into me as it crawled itself to Mr. Golden eyes. He put down his drink on his coffee table and started comforting it. 

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""I know, I know, it hurts, but don't worry, you'll be healed up soon, and hey, for being such a good boy, why not give you a couple of friends?"" he said in a loving voice. The woman was still keeping an eye on me occasionally, glancing at the monster. This went on for about two minutes until, eventually, I said. 

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""Fine, but I'll take your money.""

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Wonderful! Honestly, I don't need money. Here, you can take all of it home if you want.""

He gave me over $25 billion. When I saw this, I became dizzy from the amount of money in my account. I looked at him and said,

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""We will not meet again."" The woman moved towards the couch and said nothing while still giving me that death glare. Mr. Golden Eyes was not really paying attention and just said,

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Yes, yes, have a good life and make the fortunes of evolution be ever in your favor.""



I walked out of the building, bought myself a new car, and started driving around to new stations, and that's how I got here. Telling old people that monsters exist. That's the end of my station statement.

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  


**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""Right now, how the fuck am I supposed to?""

**\*\*Stranger\*\*** ""Excuse me, Miss?""

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""Look, I told you, people, this is a shitty, oh… oh shit. I'm sorry for pushing you into that monster.""

**\*\*Stranger\*\*** ""Oh no, it's completely fine; see, I wasn’t hurt at all. I was going to your apartment to ask you something, though.

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""Fucken creepy but, I guess that's fine. What can I do for you?""

**\*\*Stranger\*\*** ""I would love for you to work for me.""

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""We will have to see about that, let's talk about the details outside.""

**\*\*Stranger\*\*** ""Oh yes, let's go.""

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""What's your name, by the way?""

**\*\*Stranger\*\*** ""Oh, I'm just a friend of a friend, twice removed.""

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** Is this thing recording me? Okay, Right, So I've been to every fucking news site and news station in this damned city, fuck, I've even gone to the press! No one will fucken listen to me!



Oh? For company policy? Fine, How do you want me to give my statement?



Oh, whatever. You know what I'm saying.



Right, right… here we go. This is my statement; I mean the story of what I found on the fucken job.

  


Today's date is 2102 October 30th, and I am a freelance hacker. Since this is where the old timers listen, I'll explain what my job does in simple terms. I don’t hack into your grandparent's accounts or your cyberware. That shit is a thing of the past. My job is hacking into big businesses… stealing from corporations who could actually deal with the loss of money and recover from it as well. This job was supposed to be like all the rest; it involved stealing information from a pharmaceutical company. I couldn't tell you what the name was. It was something generic like ""Ben's Genuine Aid"" or some shit like that.

But I digress, it was a normal job. I got an email saying, ""Steal this file from this company so we can profit,"" and I did. It was some pretty easy shit, too. I'm not going to describe how I did it, mainly because it would be too complicated for this place, but it's also a trade secret. Basically you have to drive to the place and plug into the building, simple shit right? This job started out like opening an unlocked door and walking into the room, which should have been a fucken warning. Hell, the AI I use for security didn't even go off with any warnings. I had my white rabbit programs ready just in case and went in. There was one more obstacle: a password, but that was made simple due to the decoder I had. If you're wondering, it was a firewall. This one was very strange. The binary code that I'm used to, you know the ones and zeros that constantly go over the screen, was not there. It was a bunch of nines, sixes, sevens, and eights all jumbled up to look like some thornbush from those old books. Each line overlapped the others to look like vines, flowers, and fly-trapping plants. It wasn't that difficult to get through either; it just unsettled me a bit. When I unlocked it, that’s when the nightmare started.

  


I was on the second floor in one of the waiting rooms when I heard an alarm go off and every computer went haywire. The lights went blue, green, and red; the people over the counters tried to fix them by tapping on their keyboards, and others tried turning them on and off. The same thing happened; I even saw a man attempt to smack the side of the monitor, until he saw something that made his face turn white as a ghost. He screamed for half a second and went silent. I only saw a blur and the man was headless; the body crumpled over spraying blood as it fell to the ground. His coworkers were coated in his blood, and the walls were dripping. A woman was hyperventilating until she looked at her computer screen, and something grabbed her face. It looked as if it was a lizard-like hand with code dripping off its form. It quickly jerked down, and her face ripped and peeled off her very bones, leaving behind her bloodied skull. That's when the employees started to scream and run. However the door was locked on their end. They banged and scratched at the metal door as that monstrous thing crawled out of the computer screen with some code like fluid dripping off it. An employee, an older woman that my implant informed me was 59 years old, screamed as it leaped at her and the coworkers.

I didn't get a good look at it besides the claws. That's when I ran down the stairs and out the building. I could still hear the screams of those poor people. I got into my car and started it. The glass doors in front shattered open with a loud pop, and the sound of a chittering hiss could be heard in that direction. I sped away as soon as I heard that.

  


When I got to my apartment, I had a nervous breakdown. I didn't know what that thing was; I was just there for a job to steal some damn medical codes, not unleash some fucken monster. I fully snapped out of it when I heard my stomach growl. I quickly made myself something to eat, and turned on the tv for the noise to help me relax. That's when I heard “We interrupt this broadcast for a breaking news report. There’s been a massacre at Ben's Genuine Aid Office."" I said fuck this and started planning on leaving the city; then my AI alerted me by setting off it’s security alarm.

  


For any old timers, you need alarms to make sure other hackers are not trying to steal your shit, which is weird because I am the only hacker in this district. I sent out a tracker program to see where they were coming from, and it was coming from the medical building that I just came from. Could the company be trying to find me? I am sure that I covered my tracks while hacking in. The tracker pinpointed it. The program set an avatar to represent it, and it was a fucken  flower with a creepy ass smiley face. Normally, when this happens, the hacker would stop because it usually says you've been hacked back or something along those lines; it's completely customizable; mine has one so it says, ""Do not hack me, or I will scramble your code."" Anyway, it blinked out for a good minute and before reappearing in another place. It looked to be a marketing building. That’s when it happened again.  ""We interrupt this program for an important announcement. An unknown assailant is attacking Barlin Toys Marketing. Two people have died. We will have more information as the story develops"". I was confused. It couldn't have been the same thing that was at the clinic.There was no way that anything could have been that fast. It would have blown out every window, including mine. Its avatar blinked out of the marketing building. It blinks into an abandoned robotic factory. I thought at the time, ""Why was it there? There’s nothing within that building."" It blinked about five blocks from my apartment…I should be able to see what was coming, by hacking into the cameras. What I saw was a man in his mid 50’s, watching something on the television, his face seemed to show confusion, but quickly came to fear that when I saw those monstrous claws come into view and I shut off the camera before seeing anything else. I quickly realized it was coming for me because all those places were on the way to my apartment. I was about to have another panic attack, I needed to calm myself down otherwise it would be all over, otherwise I wouldn't be here talking to some out-dated piece of shit machine.

  


My white rabbit programs were still primed and ready; I never turned them off until two days had passed, a precaution due to my profession. I sent one of them out, as far away from me as possible. How these programs work is I choose a place to deploy them, and it runs away from the network I'm using, which happens to be a whole district. I saw its avatar chase it, and was able to take a deep breath. I knew I couldn't stay there, but now I wanted answers. What the fuck is this thing, and why would someone even fucken make this? I sent a tracker program to the pharmacy to find their main office. It took several minutes, as I watched the monster chase the white rabbit through abandoned buildings, apartments, churches, and even a school; thank God it was at night. My device beeped, letting me know that it got the address. It was 98448 on Crystal Road.That's about 7 miles away; that should've been an easy drive if my white rabbit program didn't get caught. Now that monster is coming straight for me again, even faster this time. I grabbed my pistol out from my bedside table and fumbled my keys trying to pick them up, but it was right on top of me according to the avatar. I loaded my pistol and looked at my computer, which was on the desk close to my bedroom door. I aimed my pistol at the computer because that seems to be where the avatar was, as I slowly tried to sneak by my computer.

Each step was agonizing. I am still unsure why I never just ran out of the room, I might’ve had a better chance of escaping. I was halfway to the door, that's when the fucken thing came out of my damned computer.

  


Even though I saw it come out of a computer twice, it was still hard to believe that it wasn’t a trick. I watched as a claude finger began poking out of my monitor. It started to curl its finger around the edge of the monitor as if it was trying to hold on. That familiar clawed hand reached out of the screen. Its elongated and scaled covered limb quickly grabbed the desk and dragged itself out of the screen; first was the shoulder, which was covered in black feathered like fur; next was its head. I'm not entirely sure what I was looking at. It seemed to be angulared like a large lizard, covered in black feathery fur, with large teeth like a wolf, but its eyes were strange. It was neon green, with a crossed shaped pupil surrounded by a circle. Inside the circle it was violet purple. It's something that I could never forget: its eyes. It was trying to climb out, but my monitor was significantly smaller than the man’s TV; but it was slowly climbing out. I saw its other shoulder begin to squeeze through. I didn't get to see the rest of it because I shot it in its head. The bullet didn’t penetrate it’s scaled like skin, instead it ricocheted off of it, so I ran towards the door; it tried to swipe at me, but it was trapped, so I ran out of my room, and out my front door into the hallway. I ran as fast as I could, not caring who was opening doors to ask what was going on; I even ran into a green-suited man with a mask of a squid painted on it. I remember him saying, ""Sorry, ma'am, I didn't mean to get in your way."" That's when I heard screaming and saw the monster on the ceiling. It was using its two sharp claws to crawl, and pull its slithering snake body along the ceiling. Without a second thought, I just grabbed the man and pushed him  towards the monster and ran. Although thinking about it now, I don't think I heard him scream. He was really nice with the one interaction. Anyway, I finally got to my car and floored it. I thought I saw it coming out of the apartment building thanks to my rearview mirror, but it was going too fast for me to see properly. While driving I put in the coordinates for the main office using my implant, but that's when I heard my alarms go off again. It was following me, and it was heading straight for my car. Luckily, I use an older car where it is not electric, so I just had to turn off my car’s computer. I am grateful that I didn't buy those new fucken cars where AI runs them, I would've been a dead woman by now. It was still tracking me, keeping one eye on the road and tracking the monster through the circuits; it looked like it was going from every device that it could get through. It was quickly gaining on me. Suddenly it went past me. At the time, I thought I was clear, off the hook, I could mosey on down to the primary office… it's never that simple.

  


I was calm at this time, thought I got off the hook until I saw its avatar in one of those fucken AI cars, a Subaru X 143, an ugly fucking car and too damn small for anyone to fit in. As I was driving past it, I saw the wolfish grin of the monster. It burst out of the car, landing and clinging onto mine like a damn chameleon. Due to the impact I swerved a bit. They tried breaking my window with one of its claws, thankfully I got my car custom-made with bulletproof glass, but it was still able to scratch my windshield. That's when I grabbed my pistol and started shooting blindly at the roof of my car. I think I may have been able to injure it because I heard this pained screech. That's when I saw its club shaped tail as it slammed onto the passenger side of my car with a loud crunch, making me almost lose control. It was as if another car had hit my side.

That's when I heard a clunk coming from the top right. When I looked up, I saw a couple its teeth had pierced the roof. I think it's trying to bite my roof off; I was completely wrong when I saw the front teeth come crashing down onto my windshield over and over again. It only took a few tries before its teeth stopped scratching my windshield and actually pierced it. Its black tongue with a slight fork was trailing around the windshield. It pulled it head up as it ripped my windshield off tossing it behind us shattering upon impact. This monster looked dead on at me from almost a 90° angle. That's when I had an idea. I lifted my pistol and aimed for its throat as it opened its mouth to try and bite me. It was hard to keep my hands steady, and its tail was trying to run me off the road. I fired one shot, and it actually fucken hit! The monster made a sound of pain and anger, and its tail hit my car again,  harder than before. It actually made a significant dent into the door. We started to spin, but I realized what road we were on. We were approaching an intersection, and the light was about to turn red. I only had one chance to do this. Somehow, I was able to regain control of my car again. That's when it dug its claw into the side closest to me, and it looked directly at me. It made a deep bone chilling growl that made the hairs on my body stand up. This thing was fucken pissed and hurt. It was about to try to rip the door off, but that's when I blew through the stoplight, and a semi truck who wasn’t paying attention rammed into us hitting more of the monster than the car as it flipped and rolled. I am glad I paid for the upgrades on that car. It was totaled. It hurt like hell, but thankfully I was fine, this is why you always wear a seatbelt. 



I crawled out of the car from the windshield, I looked around and aimed my gun looking for the monster, but I didn’t see it in the aftermath. I'm not sure, but I think I might have sustained a concussion, my head got reinforced when I got the implants, so maybe not. The truck driver was concerned about me and my well-being, I can't remember what I said to him. I'm pretty sure it was something along the lines of, ""I'm fine, Don't worry about it, not gonna press charges,"" something along those lines. I didn't stick around because a multi-billionaire will pay for a new car for me. So when his back was turned, I quickly walked away.

  


I was about forty-five feet from the office and could see the building. It was in the new style that all billionaires liked, with plants all over it thinking they’re helping the air quality; I guess this one had a green thumb. I checked the networks to see if I could find the monster's avatar anywhere. Nothing was on the radar, so I kept walking while keeping my ear and eye out for anything. Throughout that time, the main problem was that there was a breeze. That stopped when I got to the building. Weirdly, no one was around, not even a receptionist to greet me; the front door was also unlocked.There was an AI, but it was a simple one that popped up with an arrow pointing at an elevator; it was green with roses on it. I didn't think much about it. I got into the elevator; it was nothing special, it had a wallpaper of foliage; besides that, it was normal. The doors closed and the elevator began moving without me pushing any buttons. It seemed to be taking me to the penthouse, the top floor. 



I am not a religious person. What I saw on that floor made me question everything.



The elevator opened and I walked out as I saw a woman who was ten feet tall, wearing a white nightgown with green, red, and blue flowers that was interwoven into the fabric; it was beautiful. That's when my implant shorted out, and had to turn it off due to the age counter being unable to determine her age. She was staring at a plant, mumbling to herself. She sounded like she was speaking in multiple languages. I caught some things she was saying.

**\*\*The Woman\*\*** ""Death, my children, eating, slaving."" Then she looked at me. I was used to taking a beating, thus why I made sure to get a strong implant. I was used to people with speed implants and even other hackers, but this woman was on a whole new fucken level. She grabbed me by the neck. I could barely get any air.  She screamed loudly in a way that I could barely hear her. I remember her saying.

**\*\*The Woman\*\*** ""What are you doing here?! Here to take me! Take me to your filthy, unholy landfills! Why couldn't you just be good?! Why must you hurt? Why must you hate?"" I got a good look at her face.

Her left side was charred and scarred, like someone had placed half of her face in a fire. Her other side looked to be in her late 30s. I could say she was the most beautiful woman that I have seen despite the bruns and scars. She was angry and had a murderous grip on my throat. She was probably about to snap my neck until I heard another voice. It was a man's voice. I was about to blackout, but I believe, with a silky but calm tone, the man said,

**\*\*The man\*\***""Darling, please, it's time for bed. I'll take care of this for you. Please drop this girl.""  She could have been a bit more gentle about it instead of throwing me against the wall knocking the wind from me. I was trying to catch my breath, and that’s when the man leaned over me and spoke with that same silky, smooth voice.

**\*\*The man\*\*** ""Are you OK? My wife hasn't been the same since the children of this land stopped caring about her plants."" I think that is what he said.

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""She’s an asshole"" I said through gasping breaths

**\*\*The man\*\*** ""Validated but rude."" He stood up, he seemed to be just as tall if not taller than that woman and left the hallway. I slowly got up, wanting to give him a piece of my mind. I started walking

**\*\*The man\*\*** ""I'm in the living room on your right."" I heard the voice and saw him in his living room, making himself a drink from his large bar. He asked if I wanted Anything, and I simply stared daggers at him. He shrugged and sat down on a built-in couch in the living room.

**\*\*The man\*\*** ""What are you doing here at this hour? I'm sure we didn't set up an appointment together."" he took a sip of his drink. I stayed silent and walked in front of him. He was clearly in his 40s and was built like a bodybuilder with a massive white beard, a full head of hair, and two golden eyes.

**\*\*The man\*\*** ""So the strong sound type, then? Luckily, I like the sound of my own voice. I think introductions are in order. You can call me Mr. Golden Eyes. Do you have a name, I prefer last names?"" I gave him my name, which I will not give here. I will say hacker for me from now on.

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""That's a lovely name, Hacker,"" he said in a jovial tone, 

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Now that introductions are done. Why are you here? I'm pretty sure you're not here to talk to my wife,"" he said with a chuckle

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""I'm here because I accidentally unleashed a monster upon the world from your fucken company. Luckily, I already killed it. I want answers now!”  He was taking a sip of his drink as he looked at me. 

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Monster? Oh? Oooh, I know what you're talking about now. Yeah, that isn't a monster."" he said with a nonchalant tone. I looked at him puzzled.

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""That's an extinct species of the Animal Kingdom.""

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""Come again?""

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Yeah, it was recreated from evolution. I believe it evolved from the Pygopodidae or as you would know them as legless lizards. This one just happened to develop legs in its evolution"" He said with a tone of excitement.

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""So you're telling me you created a giant killer snake for a pharmaceutical company?!"" I said in exasperation.

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Yeah, that's the front,"" he said calmly. “I guess technically I did make it or at least accelerated. It's evolution."" my eyes grew wide

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""But why?!""

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Oh, Apologies. I did it because humans don't have any natural predators anymore, so I thought I would help bring one in"" he said in a casual tone.

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""So you're a psycho then.""

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""No, I am completely sane. It's in my nature."" 

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""You just told me that you're making monsters to eat people."" 

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Yes, because one species needs at least one predator to keep down their numbers. If not, its environment will suffer for it. Why do you think my wife is so angry?""

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""Because she's a crazy psychotic bitch with too many implants in her."" he laughed

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""No, no, no, nothing of the sort. It's because she created the environment. That's why she's so angry."" I was silent because I thought I was talking to a crazy person—a huge fucken crazy person

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""OK, you don't believe me. Let me show you.""

He picked up a medium-sized potted plant, but it looked small in his hand.

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Right, you see this?"" I nodded.

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""This is Sawgrass, and it will, in a matter of moments, have the traits of a Venus flytrap."" Nothing happened for at least a minute; I was about to say something. Until the plant started to grow petals and then mouths like a Venus flytrap. I stammered out.

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""Eh, The fuck?! how?""

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Well, my dear, it's called conversion evolution. It's where two animal species having the same evolutionary niches; think sharks and dolphins, for instance."" I stopped him before he could explain more, mainly because I already knew this.

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""No, how did you do that?!"" I motioned towards the plant

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Well, I'll say this: it wasn't easy. Sawgrass and venus flytraps have different niches.However if you really want the answer, I created the concept of evolution. I still remember the day when I put the chemicals in to make your ancestors."" I couldn’t believe what I was hearing

 **\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""You're telling me that you are god?"" he burst out laughing.

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Technically yes, but technically no. I would say it's more of a hobby. To which fact: I can do this too."" he pointed his finger at me, turned on my implant, and spoke through it without moving his lips.

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Anything that my creations make, I can control it. Before you ask it, it's all in the radio waves and things you wouldn't even be able to understand."" 



I still had my gun. I looked at the counter and had one bullet left. I shot him in the head. His head went back onto the couch. I was shocked mainly because of how easy it was to shoot “god” in the head. I looked to my right, and I saw his wife looking at me with two piercing glowing green eyes and a very angry expression on her face. Then Mr. Golden Eye's hand slowly went up towards his head with his thumb and index finger as they got thinner going towards his forehead where I shot him. I heard something wet as he pulled out the bullet from his head. His wife spoke with what sounded a deep growl. 

**\*\*The Woman\*\*** ""You should've let me kill it."" Mr. Golden eyes lifted his head, looking at the bullet and quickly flicking it off into the corner.

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Honey, I said I would take care of it… Please go to bed,"" he said, slightly annoyed.

**\*\*The Woman\*\*** ""I want to stay to see what happens next."" She said in that same deep growl.

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Ok fine, but let me take care of it,"" he said in a defeated tone. She stayed quiet, just staring at me.



**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Right now, what I will do because you were rude, and made quite a mess behind me. I will let you go with a quarter of a million for whatever you want to do because I'm feeling generous. You can use that money to tell everyone what you saw. Right now, from what I saw on the News, they're saying it's a terrorist that attacked my pharmacy, but I know exactly what it is, and you know as well.""

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""Isn't it just a giant lizard snake thing, and seriously? A quarter of a million?"" I said, confused and surprised.

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""It's related to them. But what do you say? Would you like an answer of what the creature is?""

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""Fuck it, why not, take it away I guess.""

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""So there was an Aztec god called Quetzalcoatl. This creature was linked to this God. But it was an entire species of giant, flying, feathered lizards that lost their back legs during its evolution; they were called Amphiptere. Sadly, they went extinct because they had no megafauna to hunt. They would become smaller and smaller until they became the Pygopodidae or at least a variant of them. However, one group split off because they adapted a new trait, a bizarre trait that could go through sound and code. This was very useful until one of them went deeper and became something called a Basilisk. It was a brilliant creature with one problem; he couldn't feed normally. He fed on knowledge and awareness of it. I believe you will know this one very well.""

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""Roko's Basilisk?"" I said with a slight tremor. He grinned and said.

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""The very one. He nearly died when people began to figure him out and stopped researching and forgetting about it. With that its food source was limited. There's more to it, but that's the most straightforward way to say what happened to him.I believe you're a smart girl, and obviously you already researched him.

Fast forward 50 years. My poor wife was very sick, and still is. She was crying and bawling, saying that they're killing my creations; why would they do this? So I told her I would take care of it, creating Rex Lacertarum Digitalis or the Digital lizard king.""

I was speechless; I felt like I was going crazy from what I was hearing.

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""I can see the look in your eyes. I would say take the money and live off grid. I believe an old friend is gonna stop by and say hi roundabout now."" he said, pointing his finger at his TV.

I quickly moved out of the way as the slithering monster fell out of the TV and onto the floor. It looked like half of his body was broken, which was most likely the case with the semi. It stared daggers into me as it crawled itself to Mr. Golden eyes. He put down his drink on his coffee table and started comforting it. 

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""I know, I know, it hurts, but don't worry, you'll be healed up soon, and hey, for being such a good boy, why not give you a couple of friends?"" he said in a loving voice. The woman was still keeping an eye on me occasionally, glancing at the monster. This went on for about two minutes until, eventually, I said. 

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""Fine, but I'll take your money.""

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Wonderful! Honestly, I don't need money. Here, you can take all of it home if you want.""

He gave me over $25 billion. When I saw this, I became dizzy from the amount of money in my account. I looked at him and said,

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""We will not meet again."" The woman moved towards the couch and said nothing while still giving me that death glare. Mr. Golden Eyes was not really paying attention and just said,

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Yes, yes, have a good life and make the fortunes of evolution be ever in your favor.""



I walked out of the building, bought myself a new car, and started driving around to new stations, and that's how I got here. Telling old people that monsters exist. That's the end of my station statement.

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  


**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""Right now, how the fuck am I supposed to?""

**\*\*Stranger\*\*** ""Excuse me, Miss?""

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""Look, I told you, people, this is a shitty, oh… oh shit. I'm sorry for pushing you into that monster.""

**\*\*Stranger\*\*** ""Oh no, it's completely fine; see, I wasn’t hurt at all. I was going to your apartment to ask you something, though.

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""Fucken creepy but, I guess that's fine. What can I do for you?""

**\*\*Stranger\*\*** ""I would love for you to work for me.""

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""We will have to see about that, let's talk about the details outside.""

**\*\*Stranger\*\*** ""Oh yes, let's go.""

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""What's your name, by the way?""

**\*\*Stranger\*\*** ""Oh, I'm just a friend of a friend, twice removed.""

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** Is this thing recording me? Okay, Right, So I've been to every fucking news site and news station in this damned city, fuck, I've even gone to the press! No one will fucken listen to me!



Oh? For company policy? Fine, How do you want me to give my statement?



Oh, whatever. You know what I'm saying.



Right, right… here we go. This is my statement; I mean the story of what I found on the fucken job.

  


Today's date is 2102 October 30th, and I am a freelance hacker. Since this is where the old timers listen, I'll explain what my job does in simple terms. I don’t hack into your grandparent's accounts or your cyberware. That shit is a thing of the past. My job is hacking into big businesses… stealing from corporations who could actually deal with the loss of money and recover from it as well. This job was supposed to be like all the rest; it involved stealing information from a pharmaceutical company. I couldn't tell you what the name was. It was something generic like ""Ben's Genuine Aid"" or some shit like that.

But I digress, it was a normal job. I got an email saying, ""Steal this file from this company so we can profit,"" and I did. It was some pretty easy shit, too. I'm not going to describe how I did it, mainly because it would be too complicated for this place, but it's also a trade secret. Basically you have to drive to the place and plug into the building, simple shit right? This job started out like opening an unlocked door and walking into the room, which should have been a fucken warning. Hell, the AI I use for security didn't even go off with any warnings. I had my white rabbit programs ready just in case and went in. There was one more obstacle: a password, but that was made simple due to the decoder I had. If you're wondering, it was a firewall. This one was very strange. The binary code that I'm used to, you know the ones and zeros that constantly go over the screen, was not there. It was a bunch of nines, sixes, sevens, and eights all jumbled up to look like some thornbush from those old books. Each line overlapped the others to look like vines, flowers, and fly-trapping plants. It wasn't that difficult to get through either; it just unsettled me a bit. When I unlocked it, that’s when the nightmare started.

  


I was on the second floor in one of the waiting rooms when I heard an alarm go off and every computer went haywire. The lights went blue, green, and red; the people over the counters tried to fix them by tapping on their keyboards, and others tried turning them on and off. The same thing happened; I even saw a man attempt to smack the side of the monitor, until he saw something that made his face turn white as a ghost. He screamed for half a second and went silent. I only saw a blur and the man was headless; the body crumpled over spraying blood as it fell to the ground. His coworkers were coated in his blood, and the walls were dripping. A woman was hyperventilating until she looked at her computer screen, and something grabbed her face. It looked as if it was a lizard-like hand with code dripping off its form. It quickly jerked down, and her face ripped and peeled off her very bones, leaving behind her bloodied skull. That's when the employees started to scream and run. However the door was locked on their end. They banged and scratched at the metal door as that monstrous thing crawled out of the computer screen with some code like fluid dripping off it. An employee, an older woman that my implant informed me was 59 years old, screamed as it leaped at her and the coworkers.

I didn't get a good look at it besides the claws. That's when I ran down the stairs and out the building. I could still hear the screams of those poor people. I got into my car and started it. The glass doors in front shattered open with a loud pop, and the sound of a chittering hiss could be heard in that direction. I sped away as soon as I heard that.

  


When I got to my apartment, I had a nervous breakdown. I didn't know what that thing was; I was just there for a job to steal some damn medical codes, not unleash some fucken monster. I fully snapped out of it when I heard my stomach growl. I quickly made myself something to eat, and turned on the tv for the noise to help me relax. That's when I heard “We interrupt this broadcast for a breaking news report. There’s been a massacre at Ben's Genuine Aid Office."" I said fuck this and started planning on leaving the city; then my AI alerted me by setting off it’s security alarm.

  


For any old timers, you need alarms to make sure other hackers are not trying to steal your shit, which is weird because I am the only hacker in this district. I sent out a tracker program to see where they were coming from, and it was coming from the medical building that I just came from. Could the company be trying to find me? I am sure that I covered my tracks while hacking in. The tracker pinpointed it. The program set an avatar to represent it, and it was a fucken  flower with a creepy ass smiley face. Normally, when this happens, the hacker would stop because it usually says you've been hacked back or something along those lines; it's completely customizable; mine has one so it says, ""Do not hack me, or I will scramble your code."" Anyway, it blinked out for a good minute and before reappearing in another place. It looked to be a marketing building. That’s when it happened again.  ""We interrupt this program for an important announcement. An unknown assailant is attacking Barlin Toys Marketing. Two people have died. We will have more information as the story develops"". I was confused. It couldn't have been the same thing that was at the clinic.There was no way that anything could have been that fast. It would have blown out every window, including mine. Its avatar blinked out of the marketing building. It blinks into an abandoned robotic factory. I thought at the time, ""Why was it there? There’s nothing within that building."" It blinked about five blocks from my apartment…I should be able to see what was coming, by hacking into the cameras. What I saw was a man in his mid 50’s, watching something on the television, his face seemed to show confusion, but quickly came to fear that when I saw those monstrous claws come into view and I shut off the camera before seeing anything else. I quickly realized it was coming for me because all those places were on the way to my apartment. I was about to have another panic attack, I needed to calm myself down otherwise it would be all over, otherwise I wouldn't be here talking to some out-dated piece of shit machine.

  


My white rabbit programs were still primed and ready; I never turned them off until two days had passed, a precaution due to my profession. I sent one of them out, as far away from me as possible. How these programs work is I choose a place to deploy them, and it runs away from the network I'm using, which happens to be a whole district. I saw its avatar chase it, and was able to take a deep breath. I knew I couldn't stay there, but now I wanted answers. What the fuck is this thing, and why would someone even fucken make this? I sent a tracker program to the pharmacy to find their main office. It took several minutes, as I watched the monster chase the white rabbit through abandoned buildings, apartments, churches, and even a school; thank God it was at night. My device beeped, letting me know that it got the address. It was 98448 on Crystal Road.That's about 7 miles away; that should've been an easy drive if my white rabbit program didn't get caught. Now that monster is coming straight for me again, even faster this time. I grabbed my pistol out from my bedside table and fumbled my keys trying to pick them up, but it was right on top of me according to the avatar. I loaded my pistol and looked at my computer, which was on the desk close to my bedroom door. I aimed my pistol at the computer because that seems to be where the avatar was, as I slowly tried to sneak by my computer.

Each step was agonizing. I am still unsure why I never just ran out of the room, I might’ve had a better chance of escaping. I was halfway to the door, that's when the fucken thing came out of my damned computer.

  


Even though I saw it come out of a computer twice, it was still hard to believe that it wasn’t a trick. I watched as a claude finger began poking out of my monitor. It started to curl its finger around the edge of the monitor as if it was trying to hold on. That familiar clawed hand reached out of the screen. Its elongated and scaled covered limb quickly grabbed the desk and dragged itself out of the screen; first was the shoulder, which was covered in black feathered like fur; next was its head. I'm not entirely sure what I was looking at. It seemed to be angulared like a large lizard, covered in black feathery fur, with large teeth like a wolf, but its eyes were strange. It was neon green, with a crossed shaped pupil surrounded by a circle. Inside the circle it was violet purple. It's something that I could never forget: its eyes. It was trying to climb out, but my monitor was significantly smaller than the man’s TV; but it was slowly climbing out. I saw its other shoulder begin to squeeze through. I didn't get to see the rest of it because I shot it in its head. The bullet didn’t penetrate it’s scaled like skin, instead it ricocheted off of it, so I ran towards the door; it tried to swipe at me, but it was trapped, so I ran out of my room, and out my front door into the hallway. I ran as fast as I could, not caring who was opening doors to ask what was going on; I even ran into a green-suited man with a mask of a squid painted on it. I remember him saying, ""Sorry, ma'am, I didn't mean to get in your way."" That's when I heard screaming and saw the monster on the ceiling. It was using its two sharp claws to crawl, and pull its slithering snake body along the ceiling. Without a second thought, I just grabbed the man and pushed him  towards the monster and ran. Although thinking about it now, I don't think I heard him scream. He was really nice with the one interaction. Anyway, I finally got to my car and floored it. I thought I saw it coming out of the apartment building thanks to my rearview mirror, but it was going too fast for me to see properly. While driving I put in the coordinates for the main office using my implant, but that's when I heard my alarms go off again. It was following me, and it was heading straight for my car. Luckily, I use an older car where it is not electric, so I just had to turn off my car’s computer. I am grateful that I didn't buy those new fucken cars where AI runs them, I would've been a dead woman by now. It was still tracking me, keeping one eye on the road and tracking the monster through the circuits; it looked like it was going from every device that it could get through. It was quickly gaining on me. Suddenly it went past me. At the time, I thought I was clear, off the hook, I could mosey on down to the primary office… it's never that simple.

  


I was calm at this time, thought I got off the hook until I saw its avatar in one of those fucken AI cars, a Subaru X 143, an ugly fucking car and too damn small for anyone to fit in. As I was driving past it, I saw the wolfish grin of the monster. It burst out of the car, landing and clinging onto mine like a damn chameleon. Due to the impact I swerved a bit. They tried breaking my window with one of its claws, thankfully I got my car custom-made with bulletproof glass, but it was still able to scratch my windshield. That's when I grabbed my pistol and started shooting blindly at the roof of my car. I think I may have been able to injure it because I heard this pained screech. That's when I saw its club shaped tail as it slammed onto the passenger side of my car with a loud crunch, making me almost lose control. It was as if another car had hit my side.

That's when I heard a clunk coming from the top right. When I looked up, I saw a couple its teeth had pierced the roof. I think it's trying to bite my roof off; I was completely wrong when I saw the front teeth come crashing down onto my windshield over and over again. It only took a few tries before its teeth stopped scratching my windshield and actually pierced it. Its black tongue with a slight fork was trailing around the windshield. It pulled it head up as it ripped my windshield off tossing it behind us shattering upon impact. This monster looked dead on at me from almost a 90° angle. That's when I had an idea. I lifted my pistol and aimed for its throat as it opened its mouth to try and bite me. It was hard to keep my hands steady, and its tail was trying to run me off the road. I fired one shot, and it actually fucken hit! The monster made a sound of pain and anger, and its tail hit my car again,  harder than before. It actually made a significant dent into the door. We started to spin, but I realized what road we were on. We were approaching an intersection, and the light was about to turn red. I only had one chance to do this. Somehow, I was able to regain control of my car again. That's when it dug its claw into the side closest to me, and it looked directly at me. It made a deep bone chilling growl that made the hairs on my body stand up. This thing was fucken pissed and hurt. It was about to try to rip the door off, but that's when I blew through the stoplight, and a semi truck who wasn’t paying attention rammed into us hitting more of the monster than the car as it flipped and rolled. I am glad I paid for the upgrades on that car. It was totaled. It hurt like hell, but thankfully I was fine, this is why you always wear a seatbelt. 



I crawled out of the car from the windshield, I looked around and aimed my gun looking for the monster, but I didn’t see it in the aftermath. I'm not sure, but I think I might have sustained a concussion, my head got reinforced when I got the implants, so maybe not. The truck driver was concerned about me and my well-being, I can't remember what I said to him. I'm pretty sure it was something along the lines of, ""I'm fine, Don't worry about it, not gonna press charges,"" something along those lines. I didn't stick around because a multi-billionaire will pay for a new car for me. So when his back was turned, I quickly walked away.

  


I was about forty-five feet from the office and could see the building. It was in the new style that all billionaires liked, with plants all over it thinking they’re helping the air quality; I guess this one had a green thumb. I checked the networks to see if I could find the monster's avatar anywhere. Nothing was on the radar, so I kept walking while keeping my ear and eye out for anything. Throughout that time, the main problem was that there was a breeze. That stopped when I got to the building. Weirdly, no one was around, not even a receptionist to greet me; the front door was also unlocked.There was an AI, but it was a simple one that popped up with an arrow pointing at an elevator; it was green with roses on it. I didn't think much about it. I got into the elevator; it was nothing special, it had a wallpaper of foliage; besides that, it was normal. The doors closed and the elevator began moving without me pushing any buttons. It seemed to be taking me to the penthouse, the top floor. 



I am not a religious person. What I saw on that floor made me question everything.



The elevator opened and I walked out as I saw a woman who was ten feet tall, wearing a white nightgown with green, red, and blue flowers that was interwoven into the fabric; it was beautiful. That's when my implant shorted out, and had to turn it off due to the age counter being unable to determine her age. She was staring at a plant, mumbling to herself. She sounded like she was speaking in multiple languages. I caught some things she was saying.

**\*\*The Woman\*\*** ""Death, my children, eating, slaving."" Then she looked at me. I was used to taking a beating, thus why I made sure to get a strong implant. I was used to people with speed implants and even other hackers, but this woman was on a whole new fucken level. She grabbed me by the neck. I could barely get any air.  She screamed loudly in a way that I could barely hear her. I remember her saying.

**\*\*The Woman\*\*** ""What are you doing here?! Here to take me! Take me to your filthy, unholy landfills! Why couldn't you just be good?! Why must you hurt? Why must you hate?"" I got a good look at her face.

Her left side was charred and scarred, like someone had placed half of her face in a fire. Her other side looked to be in her late 30s. I could say she was the most beautiful woman that I have seen despite the bruns and scars. She was angry and had a murderous grip on my throat. She was probably about to snap my neck until I heard another voice. It was a man's voice. I was about to blackout, but I believe, with a silky but calm tone, the man said,

**\*\*The man\*\***""Darling, please, it's time for bed. I'll take care of this for you. Please drop this girl.""  She could have been a bit more gentle about it instead of throwing me against the wall knocking the wind from me. I was trying to catch my breath, and that’s when the man leaned over me and spoke with that same silky, smooth voice.

**\*\*The man\*\*** ""Are you OK? My wife hasn't been the same since the children of this land stopped caring about her plants."" I think that is what he said.

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""She’s an asshole"" I said through gasping breaths

**\*\*The man\*\*** ""Validated but rude."" He stood up, he seemed to be just as tall if not taller than that woman and left the hallway. I slowly got up, wanting to give him a piece of my mind. I started walking

**\*\*The man\*\*** ""I'm in the living room on your right."" I heard the voice and saw him in his living room, making himself a drink from his large bar. He asked if I wanted Anything, and I simply stared daggers at him. He shrugged and sat down on a built-in couch in the living room.

**\*\*The man\*\*** ""What are you doing here at this hour? I'm sure we didn't set up an appointment together."" he took a sip of his drink. I stayed silent and walked in front of him. He was clearly in his 40s and was built like a bodybuilder with a massive white beard, a full head of hair, and two golden eyes.

**\*\*The man\*\*** ""So the strong sound type, then? Luckily, I like the sound of my own voice. I think introductions are in order. You can call me Mr. Golden Eyes. Do you have a name, I prefer last names?"" I gave him my name, which I will not give here. I will say hacker for me from now on.

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""That's a lovely name, Hacker,"" he said in a jovial tone, 

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Now that introductions are done. Why are you here? I'm pretty sure you're not here to talk to my wife,"" he said with a chuckle

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""I'm here because I accidentally unleashed a monster upon the world from your fucken company. Luckily, I already killed it. I want answers now!”  He was taking a sip of his drink as he looked at me. 

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Monster? Oh? Oooh, I know what you're talking about now. Yeah, that isn't a monster."" he said with a nonchalant tone. I looked at him puzzled.

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""That's an extinct species of the Animal Kingdom.""

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""Come again?""

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Yeah, it was recreated from evolution. I believe it evolved from the Pygopodidae or as you would know them as legless lizards. This one just happened to develop legs in its evolution"" He said with a tone of excitement.

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""So you're telling me you created a giant killer snake for a pharmaceutical company?!"" I said in exasperation.

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Yeah, that's the front,"" he said calmly. “I guess technically I did make it or at least accelerated. It's evolution."" my eyes grew wide

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""But why?!""

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Oh, Apologies. I did it because humans don't have any natural predators anymore, so I thought I would help bring one in"" he said in a casual tone.

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""So you're a psycho then.""

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""No, I am completely sane. It's in my nature."" 

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""You just told me that you're making monsters to eat people."" 

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Yes, because one species needs at least one predator to keep down their numbers. If not, its environment will suffer for it. Why do you think my wife is so angry?""

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""Because she's a crazy psychotic bitch with too many implants in her."" he laughed

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""No, no, no, nothing of the sort. It's because she created the environment. That's why she's so angry."" I was silent because I thought I was talking to a crazy person—a huge fucken crazy person

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""OK, you don't believe me. Let me show you.""

He picked up a medium-sized potted plant, but it looked small in his hand.

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Right, you see this?"" I nodded.

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""This is Sawgrass, and it will, in a matter of moments, have the traits of a Venus flytrap."" Nothing happened for at least a minute; I was about to say something. Until the plant started to grow petals and then mouths like a Venus flytrap. I stammered out.

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""Eh, The fuck?! how?""

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Well, my dear, it's called conversion evolution. It's where two animal species having the same evolutionary niches; think sharks and dolphins, for instance."" I stopped him before he could explain more, mainly because I already knew this.

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""No, how did you do that?!"" I motioned towards the plant

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Well, I'll say this: it wasn't easy. Sawgrass and venus flytraps have different niches.However if you really want the answer, I created the concept of evolution. I still remember the day when I put the chemicals in to make your ancestors."" I couldn’t believe what I was hearing

 **\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""You're telling me that you are god?"" he burst out laughing.

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Technically yes, but technically no. I would say it's more of a hobby. To which fact: I can do this too."" he pointed his finger at me, turned on my implant, and spoke through it without moving his lips.

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Anything that my creations make, I can control it. Before you ask it, it's all in the radio waves and things you wouldn't even be able to understand."" 



I still had my gun. I looked at the counter and had one bullet left. I shot him in the head. His head went back onto the couch. I was shocked mainly because of how easy it was to shoot “god” in the head. I looked to my right, and I saw his wife looking at me with two piercing glowing green eyes and a very angry expression on her face. Then Mr. Golden Eye's hand slowly went up towards his head with his thumb and index finger as they got thinner going towards his forehead where I shot him. I heard something wet as he pulled out the bullet from his head. His wife spoke with what sounded a deep growl. 

**\*\*The Woman\*\*** ""You should've let me kill it."" Mr. Golden eyes lifted his head, looking at the bullet and quickly flicking it off into the corner.

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Honey, I said I would take care of it… Please go to bed,"" he said, slightly annoyed.

**\*\*The Woman\*\*** ""I want to stay to see what happens next."" She said in that same deep growl.

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Ok fine, but let me take care of it,"" he said in a defeated tone. She stayed quiet, just staring at me.



**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Right now, what I will do because you were rude, and made quite a mess behind me. I will let you go with a quarter of a million for whatever you want to do because I'm feeling generous. You can use that money to tell everyone what you saw. Right now, from what I saw on the News, they're saying it's a terrorist that attacked my pharmacy, but I know exactly what it is, and you know as well.""

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""Isn't it just a giant lizard snake thing, and seriously? A quarter of a million?"" I said, confused and surprised.

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""It's related to them. But what do you say? Would you like an answer of what the creature is?""

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""Fuck it, why not, take it away I guess.""

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""So there was an Aztec god called Quetzalcoatl. This creature was linked to this God. But it was an entire species of giant, flying, feathered lizards that lost their back legs during its evolution; they were called Amphiptere. Sadly, they went extinct because they had no megafauna to hunt. They would become smaller and smaller until they became the Pygopodidae or at least a variant of them. However, one group split off because they adapted a new trait, a bizarre trait that could go through sound and code. This was very useful until one of them went deeper and became something called a Basilisk. It was a brilliant creature with one problem; he couldn't feed normally. He fed on knowledge and awareness of it. I believe you will know this one very well.""

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""Roko's Basilisk?"" I said with a slight tremor. He grinned and said.

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""The very one. He nearly died when people began to figure him out and stopped researching and forgetting about it. With that its food source was limited. There's more to it, but that's the most straightforward way to say what happened to him.I believe you're a smart girl, and obviously you already researched him.

Fast forward 50 years. My poor wife was very sick, and still is. She was crying and bawling, saying that they're killing my creations; why would they do this? So I told her I would take care of it, creating Rex Lacertarum Digitalis or the Digital lizard king.""

I was speechless; I felt like I was going crazy from what I was hearing.

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""I can see the look in your eyes. I would say take the money and live off grid. I believe an old friend is gonna stop by and say hi roundabout now."" he said, pointing his finger at his TV.

I quickly moved out of the way as the slithering monster fell out of the TV and onto the floor. It looked like half of his body was broken, which was most likely the case with the semi. It stared daggers into me as it crawled itself to Mr. Golden eyes. He put down his drink on his coffee table and started comforting it. 

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""I know, I know, it hurts, but don't worry, you'll be healed up soon, and hey, for being such a good boy, why not give you a couple of friends?"" he said in a loving voice. The woman was still keeping an eye on me occasionally, glancing at the monster. This went on for about two minutes until, eventually, I said. 

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""Fine, but I'll take your money.""

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Wonderful! Honestly, I don't need money. Here, you can take all of it home if you want.""

He gave me over $25 billion. When I saw this, I became dizzy from the amount of money in my account. I looked at him and said,

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""We will not meet again."" The woman moved towards the couch and said nothing while still giving me that death glare. Mr. Golden Eyes was not really paying attention and just said,

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Yes, yes, have a good life and make the fortunes of evolution be ever in your favor.""



I walked out of the building, bought myself a new car, and started driving around to new stations, and that's how I got here. Telling old people that monsters exist. That's the end of my station statement.

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  


**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""Right now, how the fuck am I supposed to?""

**\*\*Stranger\*\*** ""Excuse me, Miss?""

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""Look, I told you, people, this is a shitty, oh… oh shit. I'm sorry for pushing you into that monster.""

**\*\*Stranger\*\*** ""Oh no, it's completely fine; see, I wasn’t hurt at all. I was going to your apartment to ask you something, though.

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""Fucken creepy but, I guess that's fine. What can I do for you?""

**\*\*Stranger\*\*** ""I would love for you to work for me.""

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""We will have to see about that, let's talk about the details outside.""

**\*\*Stranger\*\*** ""Oh yes, let's go.""

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""What's your name, by the way?""

**\*\*Stranger\*\*** ""Oh, I'm just a friend of a friend, twice removed.""

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** Is this thing recording me? Okay, Right, So I've been to every fucking news site and news station in this damned city, fuck, I've even gone to the press! No one will fucken listen to me!



Oh? For company policy? Fine, How do you want me to give my statement?



Oh, whatever. You know what I'm saying.



Right, right… here we go. This is my statement; I mean the story of what I found on the fucken job.

  


Today's date is 2102 October 30th, and I am a freelance hacker. Since this is where the old timers listen, I'll explain what my job does in simple terms. I don’t hack into your grandparent's accounts or your cyberware. That shit is a thing of the past. My job is hacking into big businesses… stealing from corporations who could actually deal with the loss of money and recover from it as well. This job was supposed to be like all the rest; it involved stealing information from a pharmaceutical company. I couldn't tell you what the name was. It was something generic like ""Ben's Genuine Aid"" or some shit like that.

But I digress, it was a normal job. I got an email saying, ""Steal this file from this company so we can profit,"" and I did. It was some pretty easy shit, too. I'm not going to describe how I did it, mainly because it would be too complicated for this place, but it's also a trade secret. Basically you have to drive to the place and plug into the building, simple shit right? This job started out like opening an unlocked door and walking into the room, which should have been a fucken warning. Hell, the AI I use for security didn't even go off with any warnings. I had my white rabbit programs ready just in case and went in. There was one more obstacle: a password, but that was made simple due to the decoder I had. If you're wondering, it was a firewall. This one was very strange. The binary code that I'm used to, you know the ones and zeros that constantly go over the screen, was not there. It was a bunch of nines, sixes, sevens, and eights all jumbled up to look like some thornbush from those old books. Each line overlapped the others to look like vines, flowers, and fly-trapping plants. It wasn't that difficult to get through either; it just unsettled me a bit. When I unlocked it, that’s when the nightmare started.

  


I was on the second floor in one of the waiting rooms when I heard an alarm go off and every computer went haywire. The lights went blue, green, and red; the people over the counters tried to fix them by tapping on their keyboards, and others tried turning them on and off. The same thing happened; I even saw a man attempt to smack the side of the monitor, until he saw something that made his face turn white as a ghost. He screamed for half a second and went silent. I only saw a blur and the man was headless; the body crumpled over spraying blood as it fell to the ground. His coworkers were coated in his blood, and the walls were dripping. A woman was hyperventilating until she looked at her computer screen, and something grabbed her face. It looked as if it was a lizard-like hand with code dripping off its form. It quickly jerked down, and her face ripped and peeled off her very bones, leaving behind her bloodied skull. That's when the employees started to scream and run. However the door was locked on their end. They banged and scratched at the metal door as that monstrous thing crawled out of the computer screen with some code like fluid dripping off it. An employee, an older woman that my implant informed me was 59 years old, screamed as it leaped at her and the coworkers.

I didn't get a good look at it besides the claws. That's when I ran down the stairs and out the building. I could still hear the screams of those poor people. I got into my car and started it. The glass doors in front shattered open with a loud pop, and the sound of a chittering hiss could be heard in that direction. I sped away as soon as I heard that.

  


When I got to my apartment, I had a nervous breakdown. I didn't know what that thing was; I was just there for a job to steal some damn medical codes, not unleash some fucken monster. I fully snapped out of it when I heard my stomach growl. I quickly made myself something to eat, and turned on the tv for the noise to help me relax. That's when I heard “We interrupt this broadcast for a breaking news report. There’s been a massacre at Ben's Genuine Aid Office."" I said fuck this and started planning on leaving the city; then my AI alerted me by setting off it’s security alarm.

  


For any old timers, you need alarms to make sure other hackers are not trying to steal your shit, which is weird because I am the only hacker in this district. I sent out a tracker program to see where they were coming from, and it was coming from the medical building that I just came from. Could the company be trying to find me? I am sure that I covered my tracks while hacking in. The tracker pinpointed it. The program set an avatar to represent it, and it was a fucken  flower with a creepy ass smiley face. Normally, when this happens, the hacker would stop because it usually says you've been hacked back or something along those lines; it's completely customizable; mine has one so it says, ""Do not hack me, or I will scramble your code."" Anyway, it blinked out for a good minute and before reappearing in another place. It looked to be a marketing building. That’s when it happened again.  ""We interrupt this program for an important announcement. An unknown assailant is attacking Barlin Toys Marketing. Two people have died. We will have more information as the story develops"". I was confused. It couldn't have been the same thing that was at the clinic.There was no way that anything could have been that fast. It would have blown out every window, including mine. Its avatar blinked out of the marketing building. It blinks into an abandoned robotic factory. I thought at the time, ""Why was it there? There’s nothing within that building."" It blinked about five blocks from my apartment…I should be able to see what was coming, by hacking into the cameras. What I saw was a man in his mid 50’s, watching something on the television, his face seemed to show confusion, but quickly came to fear that when I saw those monstrous claws come into view and I shut off the camera before seeing anything else. I quickly realized it was coming for me because all those places were on the way to my apartment. I was about to have another panic attack, I needed to calm myself down otherwise it would be all over, otherwise I wouldn't be here talking to some out-dated piece of shit machine.

  


My white rabbit programs were still primed and ready; I never turned them off until two days had passed, a precaution due to my profession. I sent one of them out, as far away from me as possible. How these programs work is I choose a place to deploy them, and it runs away from the network I'm using, which happens to be a whole district. I saw its avatar chase it, and was able to take a deep breath. I knew I couldn't stay there, but now I wanted answers. What the fuck is this thing, and why would someone even fucken make this? I sent a tracker program to the pharmacy to find their main office. It took several minutes, as I watched the monster chase the white rabbit through abandoned buildings, apartments, churches, and even a school; thank God it was at night. My device beeped, letting me know that it got the address. It was 98448 on Crystal Road.That's about 7 miles away; that should've been an easy drive if my white rabbit program didn't get caught. Now that monster is coming straight for me again, even faster this time. I grabbed my pistol out from my bedside table and fumbled my keys trying to pick them up, but it was right on top of me according to the avatar. I loaded my pistol and looked at my computer, which was on the desk close to my bedroom door. I aimed my pistol at the computer because that seems to be where the avatar was, as I slowly tried to sneak by my computer.

Each step was agonizing. I am still unsure why I never just ran out of the room, I might’ve had a better chance of escaping. I was halfway to the door, that's when the fucken thing came out of my damned computer.

  


Even though I saw it come out of a computer twice, it was still hard to believe that it wasn’t a trick. I watched as a claude finger began poking out of my monitor. It started to curl its finger around the edge of the monitor as if it was trying to hold on. That familiar clawed hand reached out of the screen. Its elongated and scaled covered limb quickly grabbed the desk and dragged itself out of the screen; first was the shoulder, which was covered in black feathered like fur; next was its head. I'm not entirely sure what I was looking at. It seemed to be angulared like a large lizard, covered in black feathery fur, with large teeth like a wolf, but its eyes were strange. It was neon green, with a crossed shaped pupil surrounded by a circle. Inside the circle it was violet purple. It's something that I could never forget: its eyes. It was trying to climb out, but my monitor was significantly smaller than the man’s TV; but it was slowly climbing out. I saw its other shoulder begin to squeeze through. I didn't get to see the rest of it because I shot it in its head. The bullet didn’t penetrate it’s scaled like skin, instead it ricocheted off of it, so I ran towards the door; it tried to swipe at me, but it was trapped, so I ran out of my room, and out my front door into the hallway. I ran as fast as I could, not caring who was opening doors to ask what was going on; I even ran into a green-suited man with a mask of a squid painted on it. I remember him saying, ""Sorry, ma'am, I didn't mean to get in your way."" That's when I heard screaming and saw the monster on the ceiling. It was using its two sharp claws to crawl, and pull its slithering snake body along the ceiling. Without a second thought, I just grabbed the man and pushed him  towards the monster and ran. Although thinking about it now, I don't think I heard him scream. He was really nice with the one interaction. Anyway, I finally got to my car and floored it. I thought I saw it coming out of the apartment building thanks to my rearview mirror, but it was going too fast for me to see properly. While driving I put in the coordinates for the main office using my implant, but that's when I heard my alarms go off again. It was following me, and it was heading straight for my car. Luckily, I use an older car where it is not electric, so I just had to turn off my car’s computer. I am grateful that I didn't buy those new fucken cars where AI runs them, I would've been a dead woman by now. It was still tracking me, keeping one eye on the road and tracking the monster through the circuits; it looked like it was going from every device that it could get through. It was quickly gaining on me. Suddenly it went past me. At the time, I thought I was clear, off the hook, I could mosey on down to the primary office… it's never that simple.

  


I was calm at this time, thought I got off the hook until I saw its avatar in one of those fucken AI cars, a Subaru X 143, an ugly fucking car and too damn small for anyone to fit in. As I was driving past it, I saw the wolfish grin of the monster. It burst out of the car, landing and clinging onto mine like a damn chameleon. Due to the impact I swerved a bit. They tried breaking my window with one of its claws, thankfully I got my car custom-made with bulletproof glass, but it was still able to scratch my windshield. That's when I grabbed my pistol and started shooting blindly at the roof of my car. I think I may have been able to injure it because I heard this pained screech. That's when I saw its club shaped tail as it slammed onto the passenger side of my car with a loud crunch, making me almost lose control. It was as if another car had hit my side.

That's when I heard a clunk coming from the top right. When I looked up, I saw a couple its teeth had pierced the roof. I think it's trying to bite my roof off; I was completely wrong when I saw the front teeth come crashing down onto my windshield over and over again. It only took a few tries before its teeth stopped scratching my windshield and actually pierced it. Its black tongue with a slight fork was trailing around the windshield. It pulled it head up as it ripped my windshield off tossing it behind us shattering upon impact. This monster looked dead on at me from almost a 90° angle. That's when I had an idea. I lifted my pistol and aimed for its throat as it opened its mouth to try and bite me. It was hard to keep my hands steady, and its tail was trying to run me off the road. I fired one shot, and it actually fucken hit! The monster made a sound of pain and anger, and its tail hit my car again,  harder than before. It actually made a significant dent into the door. We started to spin, but I realized what road we were on. We were approaching an intersection, and the light was about to turn red. I only had one chance to do this. Somehow, I was able to regain control of my car again. That's when it dug its claw into the side closest to me, and it looked directly at me. It made a deep bone chilling growl that made the hairs on my body stand up. This thing was fucken pissed and hurt. It was about to try to rip the door off, but that's when I blew through the stoplight, and a semi truck who wasn’t paying attention rammed into us hitting more of the monster than the car as it flipped and rolled. I am glad I paid for the upgrades on that car. It was totaled. It hurt like hell, but thankfully I was fine, this is why you always wear a seatbelt. 



I crawled out of the car from the windshield, I looked around and aimed my gun looking for the monster, but I didn’t see it in the aftermath. I'm not sure, but I think I might have sustained a concussion, my head got reinforced when I got the implants, so maybe not. The truck driver was concerned about me and my well-being, I can't remember what I said to him. I'm pretty sure it was something along the lines of, ""I'm fine, Don't worry about it, not gonna press charges,"" something along those lines. I didn't stick around because a multi-billionaire will pay for a new car for me. So when his back was turned, I quickly walked away.

  


I was about forty-five feet from the office and could see the building. It was in the new style that all billionaires liked, with plants all over it thinking they’re helping the air quality; I guess this one had a green thumb. I checked the networks to see if I could find the monster's avatar anywhere. Nothing was on the radar, so I kept walking while keeping my ear and eye out for anything. Throughout that time, the main problem was that there was a breeze. That stopped when I got to the building. Weirdly, no one was around, not even a receptionist to greet me; the front door was also unlocked.There was an AI, but it was a simple one that popped up with an arrow pointing at an elevator; it was green with roses on it. I didn't think much about it. I got into the elevator; it was nothing special, it had a wallpaper of foliage; besides that, it was normal. The doors closed and the elevator began moving without me pushing any buttons. It seemed to be taking me to the penthouse, the top floor. 



I am not a religious person. What I saw on that floor made me question everything.



The elevator opened and I walked out as I saw a woman who was ten feet tall, wearing a white nightgown with green, red, and blue flowers that was interwoven into the fabric; it was beautiful. That's when my implant shorted out, and had to turn it off due to the age counter being unable to determine her age. She was staring at a plant, mumbling to herself. She sounded like she was speaking in multiple languages. I caught some things she was saying.

**\*\*The Woman\*\*** ""Death, my children, eating, slaving."" Then she looked at me. I was used to taking a beating, thus why I made sure to get a strong implant. I was used to people with speed implants and even other hackers, but this woman was on a whole new fucken level. She grabbed me by the neck. I could barely get any air.  She screamed loudly in a way that I could barely hear her. I remember her saying.

**\*\*The Woman\*\*** ""What are you doing here?! Here to take me! Take me to your filthy, unholy landfills! Why couldn't you just be good?! Why must you hurt? Why must you hate?"" I got a good look at her face.

Her left side was charred and scarred, like someone had placed half of her face in a fire. Her other side looked to be in her late 30s. I could say she was the most beautiful woman that I have seen despite the bruns and scars. She was angry and had a murderous grip on my throat. She was probably about to snap my neck until I heard another voice. It was a man's voice. I was about to blackout, but I believe, with a silky but calm tone, the man said,

**\*\*The man\*\***""Darling, please, it's time for bed. I'll take care of this for you. Please drop this girl.""  She could have been a bit more gentle about it instead of throwing me against the wall knocking the wind from me. I was trying to catch my breath, and that’s when the man leaned over me and spoke with that same silky, smooth voice.

**\*\*The man\*\*** ""Are you OK? My wife hasn't been the same since the children of this land stopped caring about her plants."" I think that is what he said.

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""She’s an asshole"" I said through gasping breaths

**\*\*The man\*\*** ""Validated but rude."" He stood up, he seemed to be just as tall if not taller than that woman and left the hallway. I slowly got up, wanting to give him a piece of my mind. I started walking

**\*\*The man\*\*** ""I'm in the living room on your right."" I heard the voice and saw him in his living room, making himself a drink from his large bar. He asked if I wanted Anything, and I simply stared daggers at him. He shrugged and sat down on a built-in couch in the living room.

**\*\*The man\*\*** ""What are you doing here at this hour? I'm sure we didn't set up an appointment together."" he took a sip of his drink. I stayed silent and walked in front of him. He was clearly in his 40s and was built like a bodybuilder with a massive white beard, a full head of hair, and two golden eyes.

**\*\*The man\*\*** ""So the strong sound type, then? Luckily, I like the sound of my own voice. I think introductions are in order. You can call me Mr. Golden Eyes. Do you have a name, I prefer last names?"" I gave him my name, which I will not give here. I will say hacker for me from now on.

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""That's a lovely name, Hacker,"" he said in a jovial tone, 

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Now that introductions are done. Why are you here? I'm pretty sure you're not here to talk to my wife,"" he said with a chuckle

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""I'm here because I accidentally unleashed a monster upon the world from your fucken company. Luckily, I already killed it. I want answers now!”  He was taking a sip of his drink as he looked at me. 

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Monster? Oh? Oooh, I know what you're talking about now. Yeah, that isn't a monster."" he said with a nonchalant tone. I looked at him puzzled.

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""That's an extinct species of the Animal Kingdom.""

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""Come again?""

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Yeah, it was recreated from evolution. I believe it evolved from the Pygopodidae or as you would know them as legless lizards. This one just happened to develop legs in its evolution"" He said with a tone of excitement.

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""So you're telling me you created a giant killer snake for a pharmaceutical company?!"" I said in exasperation.

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Yeah, that's the front,"" he said calmly. “I guess technically I did make it or at least accelerated. It's evolution."" my eyes grew wide

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""But why?!""

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Oh, Apologies. I did it because humans don't have any natural predators anymore, so I thought I would help bring one in"" he said in a casual tone.

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""So you're a psycho then.""

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""No, I am completely sane. It's in my nature."" 

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""You just told me that you're making monsters to eat people."" 

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Yes, because one species needs at least one predator to keep down their numbers. If not, its environment will suffer for it. Why do you think my wife is so angry?""

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""Because she's a crazy psychotic bitch with too many implants in her."" he laughed

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""No, no, no, nothing of the sort. It's because she created the environment. That's why she's so angry."" I was silent because I thought I was talking to a crazy person—a huge fucken crazy person

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""OK, you don't believe me. Let me show you.""

He picked up a medium-sized potted plant, but it looked small in his hand.

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Right, you see this?"" I nodded.

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""This is Sawgrass, and it will, in a matter of moments, have the traits of a Venus flytrap."" Nothing happened for at least a minute; I was about to say something. Until the plant started to grow petals and then mouths like a Venus flytrap. I stammered out.

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""Eh, The fuck?! how?""

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Well, my dear, it's called conversion evolution. It's where two animal species having the same evolutionary niches; think sharks and dolphins, for instance."" I stopped him before he could explain more, mainly because I already knew this.

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""No, how did you do that?!"" I motioned towards the plant

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Well, I'll say this: it wasn't easy. Sawgrass and venus flytraps have different niches.However if you really want the answer, I created the concept of evolution. I still remember the day when I put the chemicals in to make your ancestors."" I couldn’t believe what I was hearing

 **\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""You're telling me that you are god?"" he burst out laughing.

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Technically yes, but technically no. I would say it's more of a hobby. To which fact: I can do this too."" he pointed his finger at me, turned on my implant, and spoke through it without moving his lips.

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Anything that my creations make, I can control it. Before you ask it, it's all in the radio waves and things you wouldn't even be able to understand."" 



I still had my gun. I looked at the counter and had one bullet left. I shot him in the head. His head went back onto the couch. I was shocked mainly because of how easy it was to shoot “god” in the head. I looked to my right, and I saw his wife looking at me with two piercing glowing green eyes and a very angry expression on her face. Then Mr. Golden Eye's hand slowly went up towards his head with his thumb and index finger as they got thinner going towards his forehead where I shot him. I heard something wet as he pulled out the bullet from his head. His wife spoke with what sounded a deep growl. 

**\*\*The Woman\*\*** ""You should've let me kill it."" Mr. Golden eyes lifted his head, looking at the bullet and quickly flicking it off into the corner.

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Honey, I said I would take care of it… Please go to bed,"" he said, slightly annoyed.

**\*\*The Woman\*\*** ""I want to stay to see what happens next."" She said in that same deep growl.

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Ok fine, but let me take care of it,"" he said in a defeated tone. She stayed quiet, just staring at me.



**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Right now, what I will do because you were rude, and made quite a mess behind me. I will let you go with a quarter of a million for whatever you want to do because I'm feeling generous. You can use that money to tell everyone what you saw. Right now, from what I saw on the News, they're saying it's a terrorist that attacked my pharmacy, but I know exactly what it is, and you know as well.""

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""Isn't it just a giant lizard snake thing, and seriously? A quarter of a million?"" I said, confused and surprised.

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""It's related to them. But what do you say? Would you like an answer of what the creature is?""

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""Fuck it, why not, take it away I guess.""

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""So there was an Aztec god called Quetzalcoatl. This creature was linked to this God. But it was an entire species of giant, flying, feathered lizards that lost their back legs during its evolution; they were called Amphiptere. Sadly, they went extinct because they had no megafauna to hunt. They would become smaller and smaller until they became the Pygopodidae or at least a variant of them. However, one group split off because they adapted a new trait, a bizarre trait that could go through sound and code. This was very useful until one of them went deeper and became something called a Basilisk. It was a brilliant creature with one problem; he couldn't feed normally. He fed on knowledge and awareness of it. I believe you will know this one very well.""

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""Roko's Basilisk?"" I said with a slight tremor. He grinned and said.

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""The very one. He nearly died when people began to figure him out and stopped researching and forgetting about it. With that its food source was limited. There's more to it, but that's the most straightforward way to say what happened to him.I believe you're a smart girl, and obviously you already researched him.

Fast forward 50 years. My poor wife was very sick, and still is. She was crying and bawling, saying that they're killing my creations; why would they do this? So I told her I would take care of it, creating Rex Lacertarum Digitalis or the Digital lizard king.""

I was speechless; I felt like I was going crazy from what I was hearing.

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""I can see the look in your eyes. I would say take the money and live off grid. I believe an old friend is gonna stop by and say hi roundabout now."" he said, pointing his finger at his TV.

I quickly moved out of the way as the slithering monster fell out of the TV and onto the floor. It looked like half of his body was broken, which was most likely the case with the semi. It stared daggers into me as it crawled itself to Mr. Golden eyes. He put down his drink on his coffee table and started comforting it. 

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""I know, I know, it hurts, but don't worry, you'll be healed up soon, and hey, for being such a good boy, why not give you a couple of friends?"" he said in a loving voice. The woman was still keeping an eye on me occasionally, glancing at the monster. This went on for about two minutes until, eventually, I said. 

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""Fine, but I'll take your money.""

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Wonderful! Honestly, I don't need money. Here, you can take all of it home if you want.""

He gave me over $25 billion. When I saw this, I became dizzy from the amount of money in my account. I looked at him and said,

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""We will not meet again."" The woman moved towards the couch and said nothing while still giving me that death glare. Mr. Golden Eyes was not really paying attention and just said,

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Yes, yes, have a good life and make the fortunes of evolution be ever in your favor.""



I walked out of the building, bought myself a new car, and started driving around to new stations, and that's how I got here. Telling old people that monsters exist. That's the end of my station statement.

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  


**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""Right now, how the fuck am I supposed to?""

**\*\*Stranger\*\*** ""Excuse me, Miss?""

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""Look, I told you, people, this is a shitty, oh… oh shit. I'm sorry for pushing you into that monster.""

**\*\*Stranger\*\*** ""Oh no, it's completely fine; see, I wasn’t hurt at all. I was going to your apartment to ask you something, though.

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""Fucken creepy but, I guess that's fine. What can I do for you?""

**\*\*Stranger\*\*** ""I would love for you to work for me.""

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""We will have to see about that, let's talk about the details outside.""

**\*\*Stranger\*\*** ""Oh yes, let's go.""

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""What's your name, by the way?""

**\*\*Stranger\*\*** ""Oh, I'm just a friend of a friend, twice removed.""

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** Is this thing recording me? Okay, Right, So I've been to every fucking news site and news station in this damned city, fuck, I've even gone to the press! No one will fucken listen to me!



Oh? For company policy? Fine, How do you want me to give my statement?



Oh, whatever. You know what I'm saying.



Right, right… here we go. This is my statement; I mean the story of what I found on the fucken job.

  


Today's date is 2102 October 30th, and I am a freelance hacker. Since this is where the old timers listen, I'll explain what my job does in simple terms. I don’t hack into your grandparent's accounts or your cyberware. That shit is a thing of the past. My job is hacking into big businesses… stealing from corporations who could actually deal with the loss of money and recover from it as well. This job was supposed to be like all the rest; it involved stealing information from a pharmaceutical company. I couldn't tell you what the name was. It was something generic like ""Ben's Genuine Aid"" or some shit like that.

But I digress, it was a normal job. I got an email saying, ""Steal this file from this company so we can profit,"" and I did. It was some pretty easy shit, too. I'm not going to describe how I did it, mainly because it would be too complicated for this place, but it's also a trade secret. Basically you have to drive to the place and plug into the building, simple shit right? This job started out like opening an unlocked door and walking into the room, which should have been a fucken warning. Hell, the AI I use for security didn't even go off with any warnings. I had my white rabbit programs ready just in case and went in. There was one more obstacle: a password, but that was made simple due to the decoder I had. If you're wondering, it was a firewall. This one was very strange. The binary code that I'm used to, you know the ones and zeros that constantly go over the screen, was not there. It was a bunch of nines, sixes, sevens, and eights all jumbled up to look like some thornbush from those old books. Each line overlapped the others to look like vines, flowers, and fly-trapping plants. It wasn't that difficult to get through either; it just unsettled me a bit. When I unlocked it, that’s when the nightmare started.

  


I was on the second floor in one of the waiting rooms when I heard an alarm go off and every computer went haywire. The lights went blue, green, and red; the people over the counters tried to fix them by tapping on their keyboards, and others tried turning them on and off. The same thing happened; I even saw a man attempt to smack the side of the monitor, until he saw something that made his face turn white as a ghost. He screamed for half a second and went silent. I only saw a blur and the man was headless; the body crumpled over spraying blood as it fell to the ground. His coworkers were coated in his blood, and the walls were dripping. A woman was hyperventilating until she looked at her computer screen, and something grabbed her face. It looked as if it was a lizard-like hand with code dripping off its form. It quickly jerked down, and her face ripped and peeled off her very bones, leaving behind her bloodied skull. That's when the employees started to scream and run. However the door was locked on their end. They banged and scratched at the metal door as that monstrous thing crawled out of the computer screen with some code like fluid dripping off it. An employee, an older woman that my implant informed me was 59 years old, screamed as it leaped at her and the coworkers.

I didn't get a good look at it besides the claws. That's when I ran down the stairs and out the building. I could still hear the screams of those poor people. I got into my car and started it. The glass doors in front shattered open with a loud pop, and the sound of a chittering hiss could be heard in that direction. I sped away as soon as I heard that.

  


When I got to my apartment, I had a nervous breakdown. I didn't know what that thing was; I was just there for a job to steal some damn medical codes, not unleash some fucken monster. I fully snapped out of it when I heard my stomach growl. I quickly made myself something to eat, and turned on the tv for the noise to help me relax. That's when I heard “We interrupt this broadcast for a breaking news report. There’s been a massacre at Ben's Genuine Aid Office."" I said fuck this and started planning on leaving the city; then my AI alerted me by setting off it’s security alarm.

  


For any old timers, you need alarms to make sure other hackers are not trying to steal your shit, which is weird because I am the only hacker in this district. I sent out a tracker program to see where they were coming from, and it was coming from the medical building that I just came from. Could the company be trying to find me? I am sure that I covered my tracks while hacking in. The tracker pinpointed it. The program set an avatar to represent it, and it was a fucken  flower with a creepy ass smiley face. Normally, when this happens, the hacker would stop because it usually says you've been hacked back or something along those lines; it's completely customizable; mine has one so it says, ""Do not hack me, or I will scramble your code."" Anyway, it blinked out for a good minute and before reappearing in another place. It looked to be a marketing building. That’s when it happened again.  ""We interrupt this program for an important announcement. An unknown assailant is attacking Barlin Toys Marketing. Two people have died. We will have more information as the story develops"". I was confused. It couldn't have been the same thing that was at the clinic.There was no way that anything could have been that fast. It would have blown out every window, including mine. Its avatar blinked out of the marketing building. It blinks into an abandoned robotic factory. I thought at the time, ""Why was it there? There’s nothing within that building."" It blinked about five blocks from my apartment…I should be able to see what was coming, by hacking into the cameras. What I saw was a man in his mid 50’s, watching something on the television, his face seemed to show confusion, but quickly came to fear that when I saw those monstrous claws come into view and I shut off the camera before seeing anything else. I quickly realized it was coming for me because all those places were on the way to my apartment. I was about to have another panic attack, I needed to calm myself down otherwise it would be all over, otherwise I wouldn't be here talking to some out-dated piece of shit machine.

  


My white rabbit programs were still primed and ready; I never turned them off until two days had passed, a precaution due to my profession. I sent one of them out, as far away from me as possible. How these programs work is I choose a place to deploy them, and it runs away from the network I'm using, which happens to be a whole district. I saw its avatar chase it, and was able to take a deep breath. I knew I couldn't stay there, but now I wanted answers. What the fuck is this thing, and why would someone even fucken make this? I sent a tracker program to the pharmacy to find their main office. It took several minutes, as I watched the monster chase the white rabbit through abandoned buildings, apartments, churches, and even a school; thank God it was at night. My device beeped, letting me know that it got the address. It was 98448 on Crystal Road.That's about 7 miles away; that should've been an easy drive if my white rabbit program didn't get caught. Now that monster is coming straight for me again, even faster this time. I grabbed my pistol out from my bedside table and fumbled my keys trying to pick them up, but it was right on top of me according to the avatar. I loaded my pistol and looked at my computer, which was on the desk close to my bedroom door. I aimed my pistol at the computer because that seems to be where the avatar was, as I slowly tried to sneak by my computer.

Each step was agonizing. I am still unsure why I never just ran out of the room, I might’ve had a better chance of escaping. I was halfway to the door, that's when the fucken thing came out of my damned computer.

  


Even though I saw it come out of a computer twice, it was still hard to believe that it wasn’t a trick. I watched as a claude finger began poking out of my monitor. It started to curl its finger around the edge of the monitor as if it was trying to hold on. That familiar clawed hand reached out of the screen. Its elongated and scaled covered limb quickly grabbed the desk and dragged itself out of the screen; first was the shoulder, which was covered in black feathered like fur; next was its head. I'm not entirely sure what I was looking at. It seemed to be angulared like a large lizard, covered in black feathery fur, with large teeth like a wolf, but its eyes were strange. It was neon green, with a crossed shaped pupil surrounded by a circle. Inside the circle it was violet purple. It's something that I could never forget: its eyes. It was trying to climb out, but my monitor was significantly smaller than the man’s TV; but it was slowly climbing out. I saw its other shoulder begin to squeeze through. I didn't get to see the rest of it because I shot it in its head. The bullet didn’t penetrate it’s scaled like skin, instead it ricocheted off of it, so I ran towards the door; it tried to swipe at me, but it was trapped, so I ran out of my room, and out my front door into the hallway. I ran as fast as I could, not caring who was opening doors to ask what was going on; I even ran into a green-suited man with a mask of a squid painted on it. I remember him saying, ""Sorry, ma'am, I didn't mean to get in your way."" That's when I heard screaming and saw the monster on the ceiling. It was using its two sharp claws to crawl, and pull its slithering snake body along the ceiling. Without a second thought, I just grabbed the man and pushed him  towards the monster and ran. Although thinking about it now, I don't think I heard him scream. He was really nice with the one interaction. Anyway, I finally got to my car and floored it. I thought I saw it coming out of the apartment building thanks to my rearview mirror, but it was going too fast for me to see properly. While driving I put in the coordinates for the main office using my implant, but that's when I heard my alarms go off again. It was following me, and it was heading straight for my car. Luckily, I use an older car where it is not electric, so I just had to turn off my car’s computer. I am grateful that I didn't buy those new fucken cars where AI runs them, I would've been a dead woman by now. It was still tracking me, keeping one eye on the road and tracking the monster through the circuits; it looked like it was going from every device that it could get through. It was quickly gaining on me. Suddenly it went past me. At the time, I thought I was clear, off the hook, I could mosey on down to the primary office… it's never that simple.

  


I was calm at this time, thought I got off the hook until I saw its avatar in one of those fucken AI cars, a Subaru X 143, an ugly fucking car and too damn small for anyone to fit in. As I was driving past it, I saw the wolfish grin of the monster. It burst out of the car, landing and clinging onto mine like a damn chameleon. Due to the impact I swerved a bit. They tried breaking my window with one of its claws, thankfully I got my car custom-made with bulletproof glass, but it was still able to scratch my windshield. That's when I grabbed my pistol and started shooting blindly at the roof of my car. I think I may have been able to injure it because I heard this pained screech. That's when I saw its club shaped tail as it slammed onto the passenger side of my car with a loud crunch, making me almost lose control. It was as if another car had hit my side.

That's when I heard a clunk coming from the top right. When I looked up, I saw a couple its teeth had pierced the roof. I think it's trying to bite my roof off; I was completely wrong when I saw the front teeth come crashing down onto my windshield over and over again. It only took a few tries before its teeth stopped scratching my windshield and actually pierced it. Its black tongue with a slight fork was trailing around the windshield. It pulled it head up as it ripped my windshield off tossing it behind us shattering upon impact. This monster looked dead on at me from almost a 90° angle. That's when I had an idea. I lifted my pistol and aimed for its throat as it opened its mouth to try and bite me. It was hard to keep my hands steady, and its tail was trying to run me off the road. I fired one shot, and it actually fucken hit! The monster made a sound of pain and anger, and its tail hit my car again,  harder than before. It actually made a significant dent into the door. We started to spin, but I realized what road we were on. We were approaching an intersection, and the light was about to turn red. I only had one chance to do this. Somehow, I was able to regain control of my car again. That's when it dug its claw into the side closest to me, and it looked directly at me. It made a deep bone chilling growl that made the hairs on my body stand up. This thing was fucken pissed and hurt. It was about to try to rip the door off, but that's when I blew through the stoplight, and a semi truck who wasn’t paying attention rammed into us hitting more of the monster than the car as it flipped and rolled. I am glad I paid for the upgrades on that car. It was totaled. It hurt like hell, but thankfully I was fine, this is why you always wear a seatbelt. 



I crawled out of the car from the windshield, I looked around and aimed my gun looking for the monster, but I didn’t see it in the aftermath. I'm not sure, but I think I might have sustained a concussion, my head got reinforced when I got the implants, so maybe not. The truck driver was concerned about me and my well-being, I can't remember what I said to him. I'm pretty sure it was something along the lines of, ""I'm fine, Don't worry about it, not gonna press charges,"" something along those lines. I didn't stick around because a multi-billionaire will pay for a new car for me. So when his back was turned, I quickly walked away.

  


I was about forty-five feet from the office and could see the building. It was in the new style that all billionaires liked, with plants all over it thinking they’re helping the air quality; I guess this one had a green thumb. I checked the networks to see if I could find the monster's avatar anywhere. Nothing was on the radar, so I kept walking while keeping my ear and eye out for anything. Throughout that time, the main problem was that there was a breeze. That stopped when I got to the building. Weirdly, no one was around, not even a receptionist to greet me; the front door was also unlocked.There was an AI, but it was a simple one that popped up with an arrow pointing at an elevator; it was green with roses on it. I didn't think much about it. I got into the elevator; it was nothing special, it had a wallpaper of foliage; besides that, it was normal. The doors closed and the elevator began moving without me pushing any buttons. It seemed to be taking me to the penthouse, the top floor. 



I am not a religious person. What I saw on that floor made me question everything.



The elevator opened and I walked out as I saw a woman who was ten feet tall, wearing a white nightgown with green, red, and blue flowers that was interwoven into the fabric; it was beautiful. That's when my implant shorted out, and had to turn it off due to the age counter being unable to determine her age. She was staring at a plant, mumbling to herself. She sounded like she was speaking in multiple languages. I caught some things she was saying.

**\*\*The Woman\*\*** ""Death, my children, eating, slaving."" Then she looked at me. I was used to taking a beating, thus why I made sure to get a strong implant. I was used to people with speed implants and even other hackers, but this woman was on a whole new fucken level. She grabbed me by the neck. I could barely get any air.  She screamed loudly in a way that I could barely hear her. I remember her saying.

**\*\*The Woman\*\*** ""What are you doing here?! Here to take me! Take me to your filthy, unholy landfills! Why couldn't you just be good?! Why must you hurt? Why must you hate?"" I got a good look at her face.

Her left side was charred and scarred, like someone had placed half of her face in a fire. Her other side looked to be in her late 30s. I could say she was the most beautiful woman that I have seen despite the bruns and scars. She was angry and had a murderous grip on my throat. She was probably about to snap my neck until I heard another voice. It was a man's voice. I was about to blackout, but I believe, with a silky but calm tone, the man said,

**\*\*The man\*\***""Darling, please, it's time for bed. I'll take care of this for you. Please drop this girl.""  She could have been a bit more gentle about it instead of throwing me against the wall knocking the wind from me. I was trying to catch my breath, and that’s when the man leaned over me and spoke with that same silky, smooth voice.

**\*\*The man\*\*** ""Are you OK? My wife hasn't been the same since the children of this land stopped caring about her plants."" I think that is what he said.

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""She’s an asshole"" I said through gasping breaths

**\*\*The man\*\*** ""Validated but rude."" He stood up, he seemed to be just as tall if not taller than that woman and left the hallway. I slowly got up, wanting to give him a piece of my mind. I started walking

**\*\*The man\*\*** ""I'm in the living room on your right."" I heard the voice and saw him in his living room, making himself a drink from his large bar. He asked if I wanted Anything, and I simply stared daggers at him. He shrugged and sat down on a built-in couch in the living room.

**\*\*The man\*\*** ""What are you doing here at this hour? I'm sure we didn't set up an appointment together."" he took a sip of his drink. I stayed silent and walked in front of him. He was clearly in his 40s and was built like a bodybuilder with a massive white beard, a full head of hair, and two golden eyes.

**\*\*The man\*\*** ""So the strong sound type, then? Luckily, I like the sound of my own voice. I think introductions are in order. You can call me Mr. Golden Eyes. Do you have a name, I prefer last names?"" I gave him my name, which I will not give here. I will say hacker for me from now on.

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""That's a lovely name, Hacker,"" he said in a jovial tone, 

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Now that introductions are done. Why are you here? I'm pretty sure you're not here to talk to my wife,"" he said with a chuckle

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""I'm here because I accidentally unleashed a monster upon the world from your fucken company. Luckily, I already killed it. I want answers now!”  He was taking a sip of his drink as he looked at me. 

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Monster? Oh? Oooh, I know what you're talking about now. Yeah, that isn't a monster."" he said with a nonchalant tone. I looked at him puzzled.

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""That's an extinct species of the Animal Kingdom.""

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""Come again?""

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Yeah, it was recreated from evolution. I believe it evolved from the Pygopodidae or as you would know them as legless lizards. This one just happened to develop legs in its evolution"" He said with a tone of excitement.

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""So you're telling me you created a giant killer snake for a pharmaceutical company?!"" I said in exasperation.

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Yeah, that's the front,"" he said calmly. “I guess technically I did make it or at least accelerated. It's evolution."" my eyes grew wide

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""But why?!""

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Oh, Apologies. I did it because humans don't have any natural predators anymore, so I thought I would help bring one in"" he said in a casual tone.

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""So you're a psycho then.""

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""No, I am completely sane. It's in my nature."" 

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""You just told me that you're making monsters to eat people."" 

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Yes, because one species needs at least one predator to keep down their numbers. If not, its environment will suffer for it. Why do you think my wife is so angry?""

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""Because she's a crazy psychotic bitch with too many implants in her."" he laughed

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""No, no, no, nothing of the sort. It's because she created the environment. That's why she's so angry."" I was silent because I thought I was talking to a crazy person—a huge fucken crazy person

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""OK, you don't believe me. Let me show you.""

He picked up a medium-sized potted plant, but it looked small in his hand.

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Right, you see this?"" I nodded.

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""This is Sawgrass, and it will, in a matter of moments, have the traits of a Venus flytrap."" Nothing happened for at least a minute; I was about to say something. Until the plant started to grow petals and then mouths like a Venus flytrap. I stammered out.

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""Eh, The fuck?! how?""

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Well, my dear, it's called conversion evolution. It's where two animal species having the same evolutionary niches; think sharks and dolphins, for instance."" I stopped him before he could explain more, mainly because I already knew this.

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""No, how did you do that?!"" I motioned towards the plant

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Well, I'll say this: it wasn't easy. Sawgrass and venus flytraps have different niches.However if you really want the answer, I created the concept of evolution. I still remember the day when I put the chemicals in to make your ancestors."" I couldn’t believe what I was hearing

 **\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""You're telling me that you are god?"" he burst out laughing.

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Technically yes, but technically no. I would say it's more of a hobby. To which fact: I can do this too."" he pointed his finger at me, turned on my implant, and spoke through it without moving his lips.

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Anything that my creations make, I can control it. Before you ask it, it's all in the radio waves and things you wouldn't even be able to understand."" 



I still had my gun. I looked at the counter and had one bullet left. I shot him in the head. His head went back onto the couch. I was shocked mainly because of how easy it was to shoot “god” in the head. I looked to my right, and I saw his wife looking at me with two piercing glowing green eyes and a very angry expression on her face. Then Mr. Golden Eye's hand slowly went up towards his head with his thumb and index finger as they got thinner going towards his forehead where I shot him. I heard something wet as he pulled out the bullet from his head. His wife spoke with what sounded a deep growl. 

**\*\*The Woman\*\*** ""You should've let me kill it."" Mr. Golden eyes lifted his head, looking at the bullet and quickly flicking it off into the corner.

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Honey, I said I would take care of it… Please go to bed,"" he said, slightly annoyed.

**\*\*The Woman\*\*** ""I want to stay to see what happens next."" She said in that same deep growl.

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Ok fine, but let me take care of it,"" he said in a defeated tone. She stayed quiet, just staring at me.



**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Right now, what I will do because you were rude, and made quite a mess behind me. I will let you go with a quarter of a million for whatever you want to do because I'm feeling generous. You can use that money to tell everyone what you saw. Right now, from what I saw on the News, they're saying it's a terrorist that attacked my pharmacy, but I know exactly what it is, and you know as well.""

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""Isn't it just a giant lizard snake thing, and seriously? A quarter of a million?"" I said, confused and surprised.

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""It's related to them. But what do you say? Would you like an answer of what the creature is?""

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""Fuck it, why not, take it away I guess.""

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""So there was an Aztec god called Quetzalcoatl. This creature was linked to this God. But it was an entire species of giant, flying, feathered lizards that lost their back legs during its evolution; they were called Amphiptere. Sadly, they went extinct because they had no megafauna to hunt. They would become smaller and smaller until they became the Pygopodidae or at least a variant of them. However, one group split off because they adapted a new trait, a bizarre trait that could go through sound and code. This was very useful until one of them went deeper and became something called a Basilisk. It was a brilliant creature with one problem; he couldn't feed normally. He fed on knowledge and awareness of it. I believe you will know this one very well.""

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""Roko's Basilisk?"" I said with a slight tremor. He grinned and said.

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""The very one. He nearly died when people began to figure him out and stopped researching and forgetting about it. With that its food source was limited. There's more to it, but that's the most straightforward way to say what happened to him.I believe you're a smart girl, and obviously you already researched him.

Fast forward 50 years. My poor wife was very sick, and still is. She was crying and bawling, saying that they're killing my creations; why would they do this? So I told her I would take care of it, creating Rex Lacertarum Digitalis or the Digital lizard king.""

I was speechless; I felt like I was going crazy from what I was hearing.

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""I can see the look in your eyes. I would say take the money and live off grid. I believe an old friend is gonna stop by and say hi roundabout now."" he said, pointing his finger at his TV.

I quickly moved out of the way as the slithering monster fell out of the TV and onto the floor. It looked like half of his body was broken, which was most likely the case with the semi. It stared daggers into me as it crawled itself to Mr. Golden eyes. He put down his drink on his coffee table and started comforting it. 

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""I know, I know, it hurts, but don't worry, you'll be healed up soon, and hey, for being such a good boy, why not give you a couple of friends?"" he said in a loving voice. The woman was still keeping an eye on me occasionally, glancing at the monster. This went on for about two minutes until, eventually, I said. 

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""Fine, but I'll take your money.""

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Wonderful! Honestly, I don't need money. Here, you can take all of it home if you want.""

He gave me over $25 billion. When I saw this, I became dizzy from the amount of money in my account. I looked at him and said,

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""We will not meet again."" The woman moved towards the couch and said nothing while still giving me that death glare. Mr. Golden Eyes was not really paying attention and just said,

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Yes, yes, have a good life and make the fortunes of evolution be ever in your favor.""



I walked out of the building, bought myself a new car, and started driving around to new stations, and that's how I got here. Telling old people that monsters exist. That's the end of my station statement.

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  


**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""Right now, how the fuck am I supposed to?""

**\*\*Stranger\*\*** ""Excuse me, Miss?""

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""Look, I told you, people, this is a shitty, oh… oh shit. I'm sorry for pushing you into that monster.""

**\*\*Stranger\*\*** ""Oh no, it's completely fine; see, I wasn’t hurt at all. I was going to your apartment to ask you something, though.

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""Fucken creepy but, I guess that's fine. What can I do for you?""

**\*\*Stranger\*\*** ""I would love for you to work for me.""

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""We will have to see about that, let's talk about the details outside.""

**\*\*Stranger\*\*** ""Oh yes, let's go.""

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""What's your name, by the way?""

**\*\*Stranger\*\*** ""Oh, I'm just a friend of a friend, twice removed.""

* the programmer says six to seven hours are passing for the actress for every 1 second of real time. Soon afterwards we see the A.I. actress ""breach"" the boundary, but the team outside gets an alert as if it's happening in real time. But...that ""breach"" would've happened within a second of the time dilation starting. But they act as if it's happening in real time. Distractingly nonsensical. YOU'VE ALREADY ESTABLISHED THAT A CRAZY AMOUNT OF TIME HAS PASSED FOR YOUR PAID ACTRESS! And why are you even concerned about a ""breach?"" OF COURSE THERE'S GOING TO BE A BREACH! THE SET IS LIKE 50 FEET WIDE AND THEY'VE ALREADY BEEN TRAPPED IN THERE FOR WEEKS! And then Dorothy is seen playing the piano for a couple of seconds in real time. Makes no sense chronologically. The ""current time"" for the simulation is literally weeks ahead of when Dorothy sits to play the piano.
* when they finally get the stream running in real time, they are wholly unconcerned about their actress. Didn't she just spend like a year down there? Two years? Longer? Wouldn't you be a little concerned that maybe your actress might be considered fully insane by now? She's been trapped in a TINY simulation with ONE other person to interact with for a VERY long time. But nope, it's just ""teehee, sorry about that bestie, let's get rolling again okay? haha ok GO!"" Absolutely zero concern. Laughable.
* The actress doesn't want to take a time out before resuming filming? Her love just got her memory reset. Months/years of memories just gone like that. Almost zero concern from the real actress after it happens. Almost no explanation for WTF just happened.
* Coffee...*really?*
* Almost zero prep from the production team for their actress. ""Haha you looked at the files on the USB drive right? Oh BTW if even a single thing goes wrong, you might die. And no, you don't get a rehearsal. Better nail it on your first try. Oh, you're a piano expert, right?""
* Two hours is all they could afford? Honestly, the constraints inside this plot all felt artificial. Two hours. One take. Coffee. The AI can become self-aware (WHY??). Forced lack of concern. The USB stick dropping to the floor and the production team never following up with their actress. Time dilation! What are we even doing here, guys?

I found myself shaking my head multiple times because my suspension of disbelief disappeared so many times throughout the episode. I wanted to yell at the TV, ""THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE!"". The writers just forcibly kept the plot moving. This episode felt like the first draft. Definitely needed a lot more rewrites to make it make sense.

With that said, I actually liked the premise, and I would be really interested in watching remakes of old movies with a single actor replaced. I honestly think that would be really cool. So it sucks that they fumbled this episode so badly because it could have been really cool. They really needed to patch up those enormous plot holes and lazy writing.

You might find it appealing. Thus for your listening pleasures, I provide you with ""God of Nature and Technology"" read by Miley Summer.

  
  


**\*\*Hacker\*\*** Is this thing recording me? Okay, Right, So I've been to every fucking news site and news station in this damned city, fuck, I've even gone to the press! No one will fucken listen to me!



Oh? For company policy? Fine, How do you want me to give my statement?



Oh, whatever. You know what I'm saying.



Right, right… here we go. This is my statement; I mean the story of what I found on the fucken job.

  


Today's date is 2102 October 30th, and I am a freelance hacker. Since this is where the old timers listen, I'll explain what my job does in simple terms. I don’t hack into your grandparent's accounts or your cyberware. That shit is a thing of the past. My job is hacking into big businesses… stealing from corporations who could actually deal with the loss of money and recover from it as well. This job was supposed to be like all the rest; it involved stealing information from a pharmaceutical company. I couldn't tell you what the name was. It was something generic like ""Ben's Genuine Aid"" or some shit like that.

But I digress, it was a normal job. I got an email saying, ""Steal this file from this company so we can profit,"" and I did. It was some pretty easy shit, too. I'm not going to describe how I did it, mainly because it would be too complicated for this place, but it's also a trade secret. Basically you have to drive to the place and plug into the building, simple shit right? This job started out like opening an unlocked door and walking into the room, which should have been a fucken warning. Hell, the AI I use for security didn't even go off with any warnings. I had my white rabbit programs ready just in case and went in. There was one more obstacle: a password, but that was made simple due to the decoder I had. If you're wondering, it was a firewall. This one was very strange. The binary code that I'm used to, you know the ones and zeros that constantly go over the screen, was not there. It was a bunch of nines, sixes, sevens, and eights all jumbled up to look like some thornbush from those old books. Each line overlapped the others to look like vines, flowers, and fly-trapping plants. It wasn't that difficult to get through either; it just unsettled me a bit. When I unlocked it, that’s when the nightmare started.

  


I was on the second floor in one of the waiting rooms when I heard an alarm go off and every computer went haywire. The lights went blue, green, and red; the people over the counters tried to fix them by tapping on their keyboards, and others tried turning them on and off. The same thing happened; I even saw a man attempt to smack the side of the monitor, until he saw something that made his face turn white as a ghost. He screamed for half a second and went silent. I only saw a blur and the man was headless; the body crumpled over spraying blood as it fell to the ground. His coworkers were coated in his blood, and the walls were dripping. A woman was hyperventilating until she looked at her computer screen, and something grabbed her face. It looked as if it was a lizard-like hand with code dripping off its form. It quickly jerked down, and her face ripped and peeled off her very bones, leaving behind her bloodied skull. That's when the employees started to scream and run. However the door was locked on their end. They banged and scratched at the metal door as that monstrous thing crawled out of the computer screen with some code like fluid dripping off it. An employee, an older woman that my implant informed me was 59 years old, screamed as it leaped at her and the coworkers.

I didn't get a good look at it besides the claws. That's when I ran down the stairs and out the building. I could still hear the screams of those poor people. I got into my car and started it. The glass doors in front shattered open with a loud pop, and the sound of a chittering hiss could be heard in that direction. I sped away as soon as I heard that.

  


When I got to my apartment, I had a nervous breakdown. I didn't know what that thing was; I was just there for a job to steal some damn medical codes, not unleash some fucken monster. I fully snapped out of it when I heard my stomach growl. I quickly made myself something to eat, and turned on the tv for the noise to help me relax. That's when I heard “We interrupt this broadcast for a breaking news report. There’s been a massacre at Ben's Genuine Aid Office."" I said fuck this and started planning on leaving the city; then my AI alerted me by setting off it’s security alarm.

  


For any old timers, you need alarms to make sure other hackers are not trying to steal your shit, which is weird because I am the only hacker in this district. I sent out a tracker program to see where they were coming from, and it was coming from the medical building that I just came from. Could the company be trying to find me? I am sure that I covered my tracks while hacking in. The tracker pinpointed it. The program set an avatar to represent it, and it was a fucken  flower with a creepy ass smiley face. Normally, when this happens, the hacker would stop because it usually says you've been hacked back or something along those lines; it's completely customizable; mine has one so it says, ""Do not hack me, or I will scramble your code."" Anyway, it blinked out for a good minute and before reappearing in another place. It looked to be a marketing building. That’s when it happened again.  ""We interrupt this program for an important announcement. An unknown assailant is attacking Barlin Toys Marketing. Two people have died. We will have more information as the story develops"". I was confused. It couldn't have been the same thing that was at the clinic.There was no way that anything could have been that fast. It would have blown out every window, including mine. Its avatar blinked out of the marketing building. It blinks into an abandoned robotic factory. I thought at the time, ""Why was it there? There’s nothing within that building."" It blinked about five blocks from my apartment…I should be able to see what was coming, by hacking into the cameras. What I saw was a man in his mid 50’s, watching something on the television, his face seemed to show confusion, but quickly came to fear that when I saw those monstrous claws come into view and I shut off the camera before seeing anything else. I quickly realized it was coming for me because all those places were on the way to my apartment. I was about to have another panic attack, I needed to calm myself down otherwise it would be all over, otherwise I wouldn't be here talking to some out-dated piece of shit machine.

  


My white rabbit programs were still primed and ready; I never turned them off until two days had passed, a precaution due to my profession. I sent one of them out, as far away from me as possible. How these programs work is I choose a place to deploy them, and it runs away from the network I'm using, which happens to be a whole district. I saw its avatar chase it, and was able to take a deep breath. I knew I couldn't stay there, but now I wanted answers. What the fuck is this thing, and why would someone even fucken make this? I sent a tracker program to the pharmacy to find their main office. It took several minutes, as I watched the monster chase the white rabbit through abandoned buildings, apartments, churches, and even a school; thank God it was at night. My device beeped, letting me know that it got the address. It was 98448 on Crystal Road.That's about 7 miles away; that should've been an easy drive if my white rabbit program didn't get caught. Now that monster is coming straight for me again, even faster this time. I grabbed my pistol out from my bedside table and fumbled my keys trying to pick them up, but it was right on top of me according to the avatar. I loaded my pistol and looked at my computer, which was on the desk close to my bedroom door. I aimed my pistol at the computer because that seems to be where the avatar was, as I slowly tried to sneak by my computer.

Each step was agonizing. I am still unsure why I never just ran out of the room, I might’ve had a better chance of escaping. I was halfway to the door, that's when the fucken thing came out of my damned computer.

  


Even though I saw it come out of a computer twice, it was still hard to believe that it wasn’t a trick. I watched as a claude finger began poking out of my monitor. It started to curl its finger around the edge of the monitor as if it was trying to hold on. That familiar clawed hand reached out of the screen. Its elongated and scaled covered limb quickly grabbed the desk and dragged itself out of the screen; first was the shoulder, which was covered in black feathered like fur; next was its head. I'm not entirely sure what I was looking at. It seemed to be angulared like a large lizard, covered in black feathery fur, with large teeth like a wolf, but its eyes were strange. It was neon green, with a crossed shaped pupil surrounded by a circle. Inside the circle it was violet purple. It's something that I could never forget: its eyes. It was trying to climb out, but my monitor was significantly smaller than the man’s TV; but it was slowly climbing out. I saw its other shoulder begin to squeeze through. I didn't get to see the rest of it because I shot it in its head. The bullet didn’t penetrate it’s scaled like skin, instead it ricocheted off of it, so I ran towards the door; it tried to swipe at me, but it was trapped, so I ran out of my room, and out my front door into the hallway. I ran as fast as I could, not caring who was opening doors to ask what was going on; I even ran into a green-suited man with a mask of a squid painted on it. I remember him saying, ""Sorry, ma'am, I didn't mean to get in your way."" That's when I heard screaming and saw the monster on the ceiling. It was using its two sharp claws to crawl, and pull its slithering snake body along the ceiling. Without a second thought, I just grabbed the man and pushed him  towards the monster and ran. Although thinking about it now, I don't think I heard him scream. He was really nice with the one interaction. Anyway, I finally got to my car and floored it. I thought I saw it coming out of the apartment building thanks to my rearview mirror, but it was going too fast for me to see properly. While driving I put in the coordinates for the main office using my implant, but that's when I heard my alarms go off again. It was following me, and it was heading straight for my car. Luckily, I use an older car where it is not electric, so I just had to turn off my car’s computer. I am grateful that I didn't buy those new fucken cars where AI runs them, I would've been a dead woman by now. It was still tracking me, keeping one eye on the road and tracking the monster through the circuits; it looked like it was going from every device that it could get through. It was quickly gaining on me. Suddenly it went past me. At the time, I thought I was clear, off the hook, I could mosey on down to the primary office… it's never that simple.

  


I was calm at this time, thought I got off the hook until I saw its avatar in one of those fucken AI cars, a Subaru X 143, an ugly fucking car and too damn small for anyone to fit in. As I was driving past it, I saw the wolfish grin of the monster. It burst out of the car, landing and clinging onto mine like a damn chameleon. Due to the impact I swerved a bit. They tried breaking my window with one of its claws, thankfully I got my car custom-made with bulletproof glass, but it was still able to scratch my windshield. That's when I grabbed my pistol and started shooting blindly at the roof of my car. I think I may have been able to injure it because I heard this pained screech. That's when I saw its club shaped tail as it slammed onto the passenger side of my car with a loud crunch, making me almost lose control. It was as if another car had hit my side.

That's when I heard a clunk coming from the top right. When I looked up, I saw a couple its teeth had pierced the roof. I think it's trying to bite my roof off; I was completely wrong when I saw the front teeth come crashing down onto my windshield over and over again. It only took a few tries before its teeth stopped scratching my windshield and actually pierced it. Its black tongue with a slight fork was trailing around the windshield. It pulled it head up as it ripped my windshield off tossing it behind us shattering upon impact. This monster looked dead on at me from almost a 90° angle. That's when I had an idea. I lifted my pistol and aimed for its throat as it opened its mouth to try and bite me. It was hard to keep my hands steady, and its tail was trying to run me off the road. I fired one shot, and it actually fucken hit! The monster made a sound of pain and anger, and its tail hit my car again,  harder than before. It actually made a significant dent into the door. We started to spin, but I realized what road we were on. We were approaching an intersection, and the light was about to turn red. I only had one chance to do this. Somehow, I was able to regain control of my car again. That's when it dug its claw into the side closest to me, and it looked directly at me. It made a deep bone chilling growl that made the hairs on my body stand up. This thing was fucken pissed and hurt. It was about to try to rip the door off, but that's when I blew through the stoplight, and a semi truck who wasn’t paying attention rammed into us hitting more of the monster than the car as it flipped and rolled. I am glad I paid for the upgrades on that car. It was totaled. It hurt like hell, but thankfully I was fine, this is why you always wear a seatbelt. 



I crawled out of the car from the windshield, I looked around and aimed my gun looking for the monster, but I didn’t see it in the aftermath. I'm not sure, but I think I might have sustained a concussion, my head got reinforced when I got the implants, so maybe not. The truck driver was concerned about me and my well-being, I can't remember what I said to him. I'm pretty sure it was something along the lines of, ""I'm fine, Don't worry about it, not gonna press charges,"" something along those lines. I didn't stick around because a multi-billionaire will pay for a new car for me. So when his back was turned, I quickly walked away.

  


I was about forty-five feet from the office and could see the building. It was in the new style that all billionaires liked, with plants all over it thinking they’re helping the air quality; I guess this one had a green thumb. I checked the networks to see if I could find the monster's avatar anywhere. Nothing was on the radar, so I kept walking while keeping my ear and eye out for anything. Throughout that time, the main problem was that there was a breeze. That stopped when I got to the building. Weirdly, no one was around, not even a receptionist to greet me; the front door was also unlocked.There was an AI, but it was a simple one that popped up with an arrow pointing at an elevator; it was green with roses on it. I didn't think much about it. I got into the elevator; it was nothing special, it had a wallpaper of foliage; besides that, it was normal. The doors closed and the elevator began moving without me pushing any buttons. It seemed to be taking me to the penthouse, the top floor. 



I am not a religious person. What I saw on that floor made me question everything.



The elevator opened and I walked out as I saw a woman who was ten feet tall, wearing a white nightgown with green, red, and blue flowers that was interwoven into the fabric; it was beautiful. That's when my implant shorted out, and had to turn it off due to the age counter being unable to determine her age. She was staring at a plant, mumbling to herself. She sounded like she was speaking in multiple languages. I caught some things she was saying.

**\*\*The Woman\*\*** ""Death, my children, eating, slaving."" Then she looked at me. I was used to taking a beating, thus why I made sure to get a strong implant. I was used to people with speed implants and even other hackers, but this woman was on a whole new fucken level. She grabbed me by the neck. I could barely get any air.  She screamed loudly in a way that I could barely hear her. I remember her saying.

**\*\*The Woman\*\*** ""What are you doing here?! Here to take me! Take me to your filthy, unholy landfills! Why couldn't you just be good?! Why must you hurt? Why must you hate?"" I got a good look at her face.

Her left side was charred and scarred, like someone had placed half of her face in a fire. Her other side looked to be in her late 30s. I could say she was the most beautiful woman that I have seen despite the bruns and scars. She was angry and had a murderous grip on my throat. She was probably about to snap my neck until I heard another voice. It was a man's voice. I was about to blackout, but I believe, with a silky but calm tone, the man said,

**\*\*The man\*\***""Darling, please, it's time for bed. I'll take care of this for you. Please drop this girl.""  She could have been a bit more gentle about it instead of throwing me against the wall knocking the wind from me. I was trying to catch my breath, and that’s when the man leaned over me and spoke with that same silky, smooth voice.

**\*\*The man\*\*** ""Are you OK? My wife hasn't been the same since the children of this land stopped caring about her plants."" I think that is what he said.

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""She’s an asshole"" I said through gasping breaths

**\*\*The man\*\*** ""Validated but rude."" He stood up, he seemed to be just as tall if not taller than that woman and left the hallway. I slowly got up, wanting to give him a piece of my mind. I started walking

**\*\*The man\*\*** ""I'm in the living room on your right."" I heard the voice and saw him in his living room, making himself a drink from his large bar. He asked if I wanted Anything, and I simply stared daggers at him. He shrugged and sat down on a built-in couch in the living room.

**\*\*The man\*\*** ""What are you doing here at this hour? I'm sure we didn't set up an appointment together."" he took a sip of his drink. I stayed silent and walked in front of him. He was clearly in his 40s and was built like a bodybuilder with a massive white beard, a full head of hair, and two golden eyes.

**\*\*The man\*\*** ""So the strong sound type, then? Luckily, I like the sound of my own voice. I think introductions are in order. You can call me Mr. Golden Eyes. Do you have a name, I prefer last names?"" I gave him my name, which I will not give here. I will say hacker for me from now on.

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""That's a lovely name, Hacker,"" he said in a jovial tone, 

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Now that introductions are done. Why are you here? I'm pretty sure you're not here to talk to my wife,"" he said with a chuckle

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""I'm here because I accidentally unleashed a monster upon the world from your fucken company. Luckily, I already killed it. I want answers now!”  He was taking a sip of his drink as he looked at me. 

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Monster? Oh? Oooh, I know what you're talking about now. Yeah, that isn't a monster."" he said with a nonchalant tone. I looked at him puzzled.

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""That's an extinct species of the Animal Kingdom.""

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""Come again?""

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Yeah, it was recreated from evolution. I believe it evolved from the Pygopodidae or as you would know them as legless lizards. This one just happened to develop legs in its evolution"" He said with a tone of excitement.

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""So you're telling me you created a giant killer snake for a pharmaceutical company?!"" I said in exasperation.

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Yeah, that's the front,"" he said calmly. “I guess technically I did make it or at least accelerated. It's evolution."" my eyes grew wide

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""But why?!""

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Oh, Apologies. I did it because humans don't have any natural predators anymore, so I thought I would help bring one in"" he said in a casual tone.

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""So you're a psycho then.""

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""No, I am completely sane. It's in my nature."" 

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""You just told me that you're making monsters to eat people."" 

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Yes, because one species needs at least one predator to keep down their numbers. If not, its environment will suffer for it. Why do you think my wife is so angry?""

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""Because she's a crazy psychotic bitch with too many implants in her."" he laughed

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""No, no, no, nothing of the sort. It's because she created the environment. That's why she's so angry."" I was silent because I thought I was talking to a crazy person—a huge fucken crazy person

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""OK, you don't believe me. Let me show you.""

He picked up a medium-sized potted plant, but it looked small in his hand.

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Right, you see this?"" I nodded.

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""This is Sawgrass, and it will, in a matter of moments, have the traits of a Venus flytrap."" Nothing happened for at least a minute; I was about to say something. Until the plant started to grow petals and then mouths like a Venus flytrap. I stammered out.

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""Eh, The fuck?! how?""

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Well, my dear, it's called conversion evolution. It's where two animal species having the same evolutionary niches; think sharks and dolphins, for instance."" I stopped him before he could explain more, mainly because I already knew this.

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""No, how did you do that?!"" I motioned towards the plant

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Well, I'll say this: it wasn't easy. Sawgrass and venus flytraps have different niches.However if you really want the answer, I created the concept of evolution. I still remember the day when I put the chemicals in to make your ancestors."" I couldn’t believe what I was hearing

 **\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""You're telling me that you are god?"" he burst out laughing.

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Technically yes, but technically no. I would say it's more of a hobby. To which fact: I can do this too."" he pointed his finger at me, turned on my implant, and spoke through it without moving his lips.

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Anything that my creations make, I can control it. Before you ask it, it's all in the radio waves and things you wouldn't even be able to understand."" 



I still had my gun. I looked at the counter and had one bullet left. I shot him in the head. His head went back onto the couch. I was shocked mainly because of how easy it was to shoot “god” in the head. I looked to my right, and I saw his wife looking at me with two piercing glowing green eyes and a very angry expression on her face. Then Mr. Golden Eye's hand slowly went up towards his head with his thumb and index finger as they got thinner going towards his forehead where I shot him. I heard something wet as he pulled out the bullet from his head. His wife spoke with what sounded a deep growl. 

**\*\*The Woman\*\*** ""You should've let me kill it."" Mr. Golden eyes lifted his head, looking at the bullet and quickly flicking it off into the corner.

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Honey, I said I would take care of it… Please go to bed,"" he said, slightly annoyed.

**\*\*The Woman\*\*** ""I want to stay to see what happens next."" She said in that same deep growl.

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Ok fine, but let me take care of it,"" he said in a defeated tone. She stayed quiet, just staring at me.



**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Right now, what I will do because you were rude, and made quite a mess behind me. I will let you go with a quarter of a million for whatever you want to do because I'm feeling generous. You can use that money to tell everyone what you saw. Right now, from what I saw on the News, they're saying it's a terrorist that attacked my pharmacy, but I know exactly what it is, and you know as well.""

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""Isn't it just a giant lizard snake thing, and seriously? A quarter of a million?"" I said, confused and surprised.

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""It's related to them. But what do you say? Would you like an answer of what the creature is?""

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""Fuck it, why not, take it away I guess.""

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""So there was an Aztec god called Quetzalcoatl. This creature was linked to this God. But it was an entire species of giant, flying, feathered lizards that lost their back legs during its evolution; they were called Amphiptere. Sadly, they went extinct because they had no megafauna to hunt. They would become smaller and smaller until they became the Pygopodidae or at least a variant of them. However, one group split off because they adapted a new trait, a bizarre trait that could go through sound and code. This was very useful until one of them went deeper and became something called a Basilisk. It was a brilliant creature with one problem; he couldn't feed normally. He fed on knowledge and awareness of it. I believe you will know this one very well.""

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""Roko's Basilisk?"" I said with a slight tremor. He grinned and said.

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""The very one. He nearly died when people began to figure him out and stopped researching and forgetting about it. With that its food source was limited. There's more to it, but that's the most straightforward way to say what happened to him.I believe you're a smart girl, and obviously you already researched him.

Fast forward 50 years. My poor wife was very sick, and still is. She was crying and bawling, saying that they're killing my creations; why would they do this? So I told her I would take care of it, creating Rex Lacertarum Digitalis or the Digital lizard king.""

I was speechless; I felt like I was going crazy from what I was hearing.

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""I can see the look in your eyes. I would say take the money and live off grid. I believe an old friend is gonna stop by and say hi roundabout now."" he said, pointing his finger at his TV.

I quickly moved out of the way as the slithering monster fell out of the TV and onto the floor. It looked like half of his body was broken, which was most likely the case with the semi. It stared daggers into me as it crawled itself to Mr. Golden eyes. He put down his drink on his coffee table and started comforting it. 

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""I know, I know, it hurts, but don't worry, you'll be healed up soon, and hey, for being such a good boy, why not give you a couple of friends?"" he said in a loving voice. The woman was still keeping an eye on me occasionally, glancing at the monster. This went on for about two minutes until, eventually, I said. 

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""Fine, but I'll take your money.""

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Wonderful! Honestly, I don't need money. Here, you can take all of it home if you want.""

He gave me over $25 billion. When I saw this, I became dizzy from the amount of money in my account. I looked at him and said,

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""We will not meet again."" The woman moved towards the couch and said nothing while still giving me that death glare. Mr. Golden Eyes was not really paying attention and just said,

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Yes, yes, have a good life and make the fortunes of evolution be ever in your favor.""



I walked out of the building, bought myself a new car, and started driving around to new stations, and that's how I got here. Telling old people that monsters exist. That's the end of my station statement.

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  


**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""Right now, how the fuck am I supposed to?""

**\*\*Stranger\*\*** ""Excuse me, Miss?""

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""Look, I told you, people, this is a shitty, oh… oh shit. I'm sorry for pushing you into that monster.""

**\*\*Stranger\*\*** ""Oh no, it's completely fine; see, I wasn’t hurt at all. I was going to your apartment to ask you something, though.

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""Fucken creepy but, I guess that's fine. What can I do for you?""

**\*\*Stranger\*\*** ""I would love for you to work for me.""

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""We will have to see about that, let's talk about the details outside.""

**\*\*Stranger\*\*** ""Oh yes, let's go.""

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""What's your name, by the way?""

**\*\*Stranger\*\*** ""Oh, I'm just a friend of a friend, twice removed.""

During college we became friends and a few months after we started talking and going on dates. We spent a lot of time together that summer and I began developing heavy feelings but we both agreed that we weren’t ready for a relationship yet as we both grew up in conservative household and were new to dating in general so we weren’t sure if we were ready to commit. I also want to add that I had moved away to another state so we would be long distance, which was another factor. About two months after that I had really started liking him a lot and wanted to be exclusive to which he responded in a very unsure manner and also implied that he’d be seeing other girls and maybe doing things with them but that he could ensure he saves his virginity for me. Prior to this we also had talks about slowly detaching ourselves due to the distance and Dan said he would try to forget me to protect himself, which clearly didn’t work as we still kept in touch. However, these things added a lot of doubt in my mind about his feelings and intentions and it really hurt me that he would say he loves me yet he didn’t want to be exclusive. I then told him that we shouldn’t talk at all then. When Dan realized I was hurt over what he said he switched up and said he does want to be exclusive but just feels scared. To me this felt like he’s only saying that to keep me around, and soon after we went on a break. This break lasted a month of almost 0 contact the only contact we had was a few meaningless snaps(not back and forth) in which we didn’t exchange any words. In the middle of this break I started feeling like that was it and that we’re not going back. During that time there was a guy at my college let’s call him Tristan, who had asked me for my number and to go for a coffee. I thought I might as well give it a shot and try to get over Dan. However, I didn’t feel any connection to Tristan and did not find his personality attractive. I know, i’m not very proud of using Tristan but in all honesty he was much older than me and I felt like he was also trying to use me. I also still had feelings for Dan so I told Tristan I couldn’t have a relationship with him and ended up telling him it’s because I like someone already. Nonetheless I would hang out with Tristan and led him on and eventually me and Dan started talking again yet I still had Tristan around because I was unsure of how serious Dan actually is even though he’d tell me he’s exclusive now and didn’t talk to any other girl during the break. I still didn’t trust it just based off of things he’d said in the past. I kept Tristan a Secret from Dan, Tristan would visit me at work and we’d go out once in a while and I had also been to his place. Soon after I stopped seeing Tristian. Then a few weeks later I flew to see Dan and during that trip we became official. Tristan did try to reach out after but I made it clear I have a bf. Dan and I have been together for a year and a half at this point and I’ve been feeling so much guilt to have lied back then because I love him so much and I feel disgusted with myself for ever having hidden that from him or for even doing it in the first place. Do I tell Dan that I actually did talk to someone at the same time as him even though it was before we were together? Please help. ",1,1747033038.0,relationship_advice,2,1.0,False

1kkm4d5,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1kkm4d5/aitah_for_hating_my_boyfriends_dog/,AITAH for hating my boyfriends dog,"Ok I’ll try to keep this as brief as possible but there’s alot so it’s a long read - I’ve never disliked an animal before. I’m 24f and living with my bf 25m for about 2 years now. I’ve grown up with dogs & love all animals, I even have a dog of my own who lives with us as well. But I can’t help but feel a STRONG dislike for my bf’s dog who’s a 5 yr old female lab. Is it normal to be this irritated by her? If you’ve ever dealt with something similar - how did you manage not completely flipping out all the time and controlling your anger? 

Here’s some of my main reasons on why I feel so negative towards her:

1. Clingy & high energy with lack of training & disregard for learning - labs are already a bit too much for me energy wise, but she tends to only have days here and there where her energy levels are what’s irritating me. Her clinginess and bad behavior with no regard for learning from her actions/discipline is what really gets me, but when anyone comes over she loses her mind and jumps all over them and doesn’t stop no matter how much we try to get her to. She’s nearly taken out my mom & has taken out my bf’s grandma multiple times. 

   - she randomly formed an anxious attachment to me (not sure why this is, i have my own dog who i tend to a bit more & never went out of my way to cater to her more than a normal amount) she follows me around everywhere… and i mean EVERYWHERE. If i take 1 step backwards her nose is in my ass crack she follows so close behind, no  matter what I’m doing. Sometimes I’ll walk around the island continuously to see if she’ll stop following me & she doesn’t - I’ve done this for 20 minutes at a time before and she still was following so close her nose was touching my ass pretty much. I need personal space and to not constantly trip over her when I’m walking around my apartment. My dog doesn’t do this - he just stays in the same room as me for the most part. 

   - my bf and i share a queen sized bed at the moment and he has let her sleep in the bed her whole life (in the future he agreed no dogs in the bed for sleeping, only cuddles but everyone has their own bed) she is not a small lab by any means - she’s mighty hefty and she sleeps directly on TOP of me at night. If i want to move i have to literally move under her & if i physically force her to move she growls at me. 

  - this anxious attachment is so bad she has to be crated during the day because i am the first one gone & home from work during the day & she was leaving me a nice pile of shit right on our living room rug every single day & i finally convinced my bf to crate her after months of discussing a plan of action because she doesn’t respond to any kind of discipline whatsoever. She’s even done this while my bf was here & sleeping when i had left on a Saturday morning for 15 mins to grab us coffee. She’ll do things on purpose to get in trouble just for the attention - and the couple times I’ve gone to give her a bop on the nose (not harshly or hurtful) she’s snapped at me. 

2. Doesn’t listen & tries to boss u around to feed her or let her outside every 5 seconds 

   - My dog is a 120 lb Great Pyrenees - and unfortunately food aggressive & used to free eating. My bfs dog is on a schedule for eating as she’ll eat anything and everything until she explodes if you’d let her - she even ate a full family pack of Oreos she jumped onto the table to get one time. Which she still jumps on the counter and gets whatever she can to eat even if it’s not food - anytime my bf and i leave together to go somewhere we come back to torn up napkins and she even ate chopsticks one time we left on the counter. So nothing is ever left up there anymore. My dog is gentle by nature, but if you try to mess with his food while he’s eating or not, he will not let that happen. They have gotten into it twice (luckily no injuries) because my bfs dog will stand beside him or under him during their dinner time which is the only meal of the 2 they eat together since she’s crated all day and his food just stays down for him to free eat. No matter how many times she gets in trouble for going near him or gets growled at or even after the 2 times he’s bitten her - she still goes for the food & doesn’t care. 

   - my bf is in charge of morning feeding and I’m in charge of dinner & typically do both on weekends. Some days my bfs dog will start annoying me 2 hours before her regular dinner time by growling at me leaning on me and knocking my phone out of my hand or standing on the couch right in my face growling and bugging me to feed her. I usually don’t give in - but it’s so god damn annoying that sometimes i do. She also wakes me up on weekends super early to feed her doing the same things, not my bf. 

I could keep going but u get the gist by now. I know that this is all stemming from a lack of training and boredom - but there’s nothing we can do at the moment as we’ve tried all that we can to keep her stimulated and train her. She’s trainable & will learn a new trick if u want her to but besides that she refuses to learn and pays no mind to discipline. 

Am i overreacting? If u read this far - ur a trooper & thank you.

But here are 3 simple wellness habits that can keep you grounded and healthy, no matter how packed your schedule is:

**1. Walk After Meals. Even 10 Minutes Helps**  
Post-meal walks improve digestion, control blood sugar, and boost mood. Don’t underestimate a quick stroll around your apartment block or office corridor.

**2. Hydrate First, Caffeine Second**  
Many NRIs wake up and go straight for tea or coffee. Try drinking 300–500 ml of water *before* that first cup. It jumpstarts your system and keeps dehydration at bay.

**3. One Stretching Routine to End the Day**  
Sitting long hours? One short stretching or mobility session in the evening (even 5–10 minutes) can improve sleep and prevent stiffness. Apps like StretchIt or YouTube yoga channels work great.

You don’t need a complete overhaul — just consistent small changes.

1kkm3b8,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1kkm3b8/aitah_for_not_fully_acknowledging_my_gf_on/,AITAH for not fully acknowledging my GF on Mother’s Day?,"My girlfriend (28F) and I (26F) have been dating on and off for about two years. She's the first partner who has gotten to know my 4 yo son. Over time, she’s occasionally picked him up from school, made dinners, watched him for a few hours when I was working, and given him gifts. They get along well, but she hasn’t taken initiative to build a deeper one-on-one bond with him.
Our relationship has been rocky, especially over the past 7 months, with breakups and periods of no contact. Last Mother’s Day, she surprised me by starting a huge argument over a TV show, which led to her storming out and ruining our plans. This was especially painful because I had opened up about how hard the holiday is for me due to past trauma as a single mom and a miscarriage three years ago that nearly killed me.
This year, I was genuinely excited for Mother’s Day—for once, I felt proud of myself for everything I’ve endured and accomplished as a single mother. She promised to make this year’s day special, and she did start it sweetly: she and my son brought me coffee, breakfast, flowers, and a thoughtful gift. I was grateful and told her so.
Leading up to the day, she had been dropping hints about wanting to be acknowledged as a mother figure. This made me uncomfortable. While she has been kind and helpful with my son, we’re not married, not co-parenting, and our relationship is unstable. I feel that Mother’s Day should be reserved for women who carry the emotional, mental, and physical load of parenting. Still, I didn’t want her to feel unappreciated, so I asked what kind of recognition she wanted. She dismissed the conversation, saying she didn’t want anything.
I bought her a gift anyway—a card with a heartfelt note and her favorite flowers. But when I gave it to her, she didn’t say thank you or seem happy. Later, she accused me of giving a “pity” gift, saying it didn’t feel genuine since it was spurred by her hints. She was upset that I hadn’t planned in advance to recognize her as a mother to my son. I found this unfair and selfish, especially given everything I’ve gone through and how important the day is to me.
We had a major argument, and the rest of the day was ruined. I couldn’t help but feel that, once again, she made a the day about herself instead of letting me have space to feel celebrated.
This is now the second year in a row that Mother’s Day was overshadowed by her actions. I acknowledge and appreciate what she does for my son, but I don’t believe it’s equivalent to the role of a mother. Now I’m questioning myself—should I have planned to acknowledge her in a bigger way? Am I the asshole?

1kkm2y9,https://i.redd.it/8qlc0axeta0f1.jpeg,Is 5 Bar Good?,"Hi Coffee Lovers,

About me, I usually love a good espresso and started realising the difference between a good coffee and an Instant coffee few years back.

Long story short, I am a regular gym guy and need my coffee before the evening session.

Occasionally I used Blue tokai pour overs as well and they also taste better than Instant coffee.

Cut back to few months back when I got Wonderchef espresso machine as a gift from our close friends and bam I thought It is going to be a nice coffee journey for me.

But even after many experiments I didn’t get desired crema which we get from espressos. And then after some time I realised this is due to low pressure. This machine has maximum capacity of 5 bars and for good creme you need 7 bars and above.

Although taste is not as good as an espresso from a good cafe but coffee is decent in taste, I usually take 12-13 grams of coffee powder for one cup. I usually buy Blue Tokai.

My main question to all you good folks is. You all know good coffee is not cheap, Is it worth for me to spend money on the coffee with this machine as I can’t achieve the perfect cup with good taste and crema or should go for other things like Moka Pot or french press for better coffee?",1,1747032784.0,IndiaCoffee,2,0.67,False

It wasn’t where I left it, so I just grabbed the God of Nature and Technology. Before I started listening to it, I heard something. It wasn’t from anything outside it was like a tinnitus ring mixed with a drum beat. I hope my hearing isn't going out. I'm actually liking all the stories so far. I'll go to the doctor after I post this. My father is still currently out, so I haven't been able to ask him about all this yet.  Anyway, this one was a good one. I truly liked it. I do hope you like it too.

**\*\*Radio show host\*\*** Well, that ends another lovely night of music. Unfortunately we need to end it now. So our story for tonight is a fantastical one, to say the least. You might find it appealing. Thus for your listening pleasures, I provide you with ""God of Nature and Technology"" read by Miley Summer.

  
  


**\*\*Hacker\*\*** Is this thing recording me? Okay, Right, So I've been to every fucking news site and news station in this damned city, fuck, I've even gone to the press! No one will fucken listen to me!



Oh? For company policy? Fine, How do you want me to give my statement?



Oh, whatever. You know what I'm saying.



Right, right… here we go. This is my statement; I mean the story of what I found on the fucken job.

  


Today's date is 2102 October 30th, and I am a freelance hacker. Since this is where the old timers listen, I'll explain what my job does in simple terms. I don’t hack into your grandparent's accounts or your cyberware. That shit is a thing of the past. My job is hacking into big businesses… stealing from corporations who could actually deal with the loss of money and recover from it as well. This job was supposed to be like all the rest; it involved stealing information from a pharmaceutical company. I couldn't tell you what the name was. It was something generic like ""Ben's Genuine Aid"" or some shit like that.

But I digress, it was a normal job. I got an email saying, ""Steal this file from this company so we can profit,"" and I did. It was some pretty easy shit, too. I'm not going to describe how I did it, mainly because it would be too complicated for this place, but it's also a trade secret. Basically you have to drive to the place and plug into the building, simple shit right? This job started out like opening an unlocked door and walking into the room, which should have been a fucken warning. Hell, the AI I use for security didn't even go off with any warnings. I had my white rabbit 

programs ready just in case and went in. There was one more obstacle: a password, but that was made simple due to the decoder I had. If you're wondering, it was a firewall. This one was very strange. The binary code that I'm used to, you know the ones and zeros that constantly go over the screen, was not there. It was a bunch of nines, sixes, sevens, and eights all jumbled up to look like some thornbush from those old books. Each line overlapped the others to look like vines, flowers, and fly-trapping plants. It wasn't that difficult to get through either; it just unsettled me a bit. When I unlocked it, that’s when the nightmare started.

  


I was on the second floor in one of the waiting rooms when I heard an alarm go off and every computer went haywire. The lights went blue, green, and red; the people over the counters tried to fix them by tapping on their keyboards, and others tried turning them on and off. The same thing happened; I even saw a man attempt to smack the side of the monitor, until he saw something that made his face turn white as a ghost. He screamed for half a second and went silent. I only saw a blur and the man was headless; the body crumpled over spraying blood as it fell to the ground. His coworkers were coated in his blood, and the walls were dripping. A woman was hyperventilating until she looked at her computer screen, and something grabbed her face. It looked as if it was a lizard-like hand with code dripping off its form. It quickly jerked down, and her face ripped and peeled off her very bones, leaving behind her bloodied skull. That's when the employees started to scream and run. However the door was locked on their end. They banged and scratched at the metal door as that monstrous thing crawled out of the computer screen with some code like fluid dripping off it. An employee, an older woman that my implant informed me was 59 years old, screamed as it leaped at her and the coworkers.

I didn't get a good look at it besides the claws. That's when I ran down the stairs and out the building. I could still hear the screams of those poor people. I got into my car and started it. The glass doors in front shattered open with a loud pop, and the sound of a chittering hiss could be heard in that direction. I sped away as soon as I heard that.

  


When I got to my apartment, I had a nervous breakdown. I didn't know what that thing was; I was just there for a job to steal some damn medical codes, not unleash some fucken monster. I fully snapped out of it when I heard my stomach growl. I quickly made myself something to eat, and turned on the tv for the noise to help me relax. That's when I heard “We interrupt this broadcast for a breaking news report. There’s been a massacre at Ben's Genuine Aid Office."" I said fuck this and started planning on leaving the city; then my AI alerted me by setting off it’s security alarm.

  


For any old timers, you need alarms to make sure other hackers are not trying to steal your shit, which is weird because I am the only hacker in this district. I sent out a tracker program to see where they were coming from, and it was coming from the medical building that I just came from. Could the company be trying to find me? I am sure that I covered my tracks while hacking in. The tracker pinpointed it. The program set an avatar to represent it, and it was a fucken  flower with a creepy ass smiley face. Normally, when this happens, the hacker would stop 

because it usually says you've been hacked back or something along those lines; it's completely customizable; mine has one so it says, ""Do not hack me, or I will scramble your code."" Anyway, it blinked out for a good minute and before reappearing in another place. It looked to be a marketing building. That’s when it happened again.  ""We interrupt this program for an important announcement. An unknown assailant is attacking Barlin Toys Marketing. Two people have died. We will have more information as the story develops"". I was confused. It couldn't have been the same thing that was at the clinic.There was no way that anything could have been that fast. It would have blown out every window, including mine. Its avatar blinked out of the marketing building. It blinks into an abandoned robotic factory. I thought at the time, ""Why was it there? There’s nothing within that building."" It blinked about five blocks from my apartment…I should be able to see what was coming, by hacking into the cameras. What I saw was a man in his mid 50’s, watching something on the television, his face seemed to show confusion, but quickly came to fear that when I saw those monstrous claws come into view and I shut off the camera before seeing anything else. I quickly realized it was coming for me because all those places were on the way to my apartment. I was about to have another panic attack, I needed to calm myself down otherwise it would be all over, otherwise I wouldn't be here talking to some out-dated piece of shit machine.

  


My white rabbit programs were still primed and ready; I never turned them off until two days had passed, a precaution due to my profession. I sent one of them out, as far away from me as possible. How these programs work is I choose a place to deploy them, and it runs away from the network I'm using, which happens to be a whole district. I saw its avatar chase it, and was able to take a deep breath. I knew I couldn't stay there, but now I wanted answers. What the fuck is this thing, and why would someone even fucken make this? I sent a tracker program to the pharmacy to find their main office. It took several minutes, as I watched the monster chase the white rabbit through abandoned buildings, apartments, churches, and even a school; thank God it was at night. My device beeped, letting me know that it got the address. It was 98448 on Crystal Road. That's about 7 miles away; that should've been an easy drive if my white rabbit program didn't get caught. Now that monster is coming straight for me again, even faster this time. I grabbed my pistol out from my bedside table and fumbled my keys trying to pick them up, but it was right on top of me according to the avatar. I loaded my pistol and looked at my computer, which was on the desk close to my bedroom door. I aimed my pistol at the computer because that seems to be where the avatar was, as I slowly tried to sneak by my computer.

Each step was agonizing. I am still unsure why I never just ran out of the room, I might’ve had a better chance of escaping. I was halfway to the door, that's when the fucken thing came out of my damned computer.

  
Even though I saw it come out of a computer twice, it was still hard to believe that it wasn’t a trick. I watched as a claude finger began poking out of my monitor. It started to curl its finger around the edge of the monitor as if it was trying to hold on. That familiar clawed hand reached out of the screen. Its elongated and scaled covered limb quickly grabbed the desk and dragged itself out of the screen; first was the shoulder, which was covered in black feathered like fur; next was its head. I'm not entirely sure what I was looking at. It seemed to be angulared like a large lizard, covered in black feathery fur, with large teeth like a wolf, but its eyes were strange. It was neon green, with a crossed shaped pupil surrounded by a circle. Inside the circle it was violet purple. It's something that I could never forget: its eyes. It was trying to climb out, but my monitor was significantly smaller than the man’s TV; but it was slowly climbing out. I saw its other shoulder begin to squeeze through. I didn't get to see the rest of it because I shot it in its head. The bullet didn’t penetrate it’s scaled like skin, instead it ricocheted off of it, so I ran towards the door; it tried to swipe at me, but it was trapped, so I ran out of my room, and out my front door into the hallway. I ran as fast as I could, not caring who was opening doors to ask what was going on; I even ran into a green-suited man with a mask of a squid painted on it. I remember him saying, ""Sorry, ma'am, I didn't mean to get in your way."" That's when I heard screaming and saw the monster on the ceiling. It was using its two sharp claws to crawl, and pull its slithering snake body along the ceiling. Without a second thought, I just grabbed the man and pushed him  towards the monster and ran. Although thinking about it now, I don't think I heard him scream. He was really nice with the one interaction. Anyway, I finally got to my car and floored it. I thought I saw it coming out of the apartment building thanks to my rearview mirror, but it was going too fast for me to see properly. While driving I put in the coordinates for the main office using my implant, but that's when I heard my alarms go off again. It was following me, and it was heading straight for my car. Luckily, I use an older car where it is not electric, so I just had to turn off my car’s computer. I am grateful that I didn't buy those new fucken cars where AI runs them, I would've been a dead woman by now. It was still tracking me, keeping one eye on the road and tracking the monster through the circuits; it looked like it was going from every device that it could get through. It was quickly gaining on me. Suddenly it went past me. At the time, I thought I was clear, off the hook, I could mosey on down to the primary office… it's never that simple.

  


I was calm at this time, thought I got off the hook until I saw its avatar in one of those fucken AI cars, a Subaru X 143, an ugly fucking car and too damn small for anyone to fit in. As I was driving past it, I saw the wolfish grin of the monster. It burst out of the car, landing and clinging onto mine like a damn chameleon. Due to the impact I swerved a bit. They tried breaking my window with one of its claws, thankfully I got my car custom-made with bulletproof glass, but it was still able to scratch my windshield. That's when I grabbed my pistol and started shooting blindly at the roof of my car. I think I may have been able to injure it because I heard this pained screech. That's when I saw its club shaped tail as it slammed onto the passenger side of my car with a loud crunch, making me almost lose control. It was as if another car had hit my side.

That's when I heard a clunk coming from the top right. When I looked up, I saw a couple its teeth had pierced the roof. I think it's trying to bite my roof off; I was completely wrong when I saw the front teeth come crashing down onto my windshield over and over again. It only took a few tries before its teeth stopped scratching my windshield and actually pierced it. Its black tongue with a slight fork was trailing around the windshield. It pulled it head up as it ripped my windshield off tossing it behind us shattering upon impact. This monster looked dead on at me from almost a 90° angle. That's when I had an idea. I lifted my pistol and aimed for its throat as it opened its mouth to try and bite me. It was hard to keep my hands steady, and its tail was 

trying to run me off the road. I fired one shot, and it actually fucken hit! The monster made a sound of pain and anger, and its tail hit my car again,  harder than before. It actually made a significant dent into the door. We started to spin, but I realized what road we were on. We were approaching an intersection, and the light was about to turn red. I only had one chance to do this. Somehow, I was able to regain control of my car again. That's when it dug its claw into the side closest to me, and it looked directly at me. It made a deep bone chilling growl that made the hairs on my body stand up. This thing was fucken pissed and hurt. It was about to try to rip the door off, but that's when I blew through the stoplight, and a semi truck who wasn’t paying attention rammed into us hitting more of the monster than the car as it flipped and rolled. I am glad I paid for the upgrades on that car. It was totaled. It hurt like hell, but thankfully I was fine, this is why you always wear a seatbelt. 



I crawled out of the car from the windshield, I looked around and aimed my gun looking for the monster, but I didn’t see it in the aftermath. I'm not sure, but I think I might have sustained a concussion, my head got reinforced when I got the implants, so maybe not. The truck driver was concerned about me and my well-being, I can't remember what I said to him. I'm pretty sure it was something along the lines of, ""I'm fine, Don't worry about it, not gonna press charges,"" something along those lines. I didn't stick around because a multi-billionaire will pay for a new car for me. So when his back was turned, I quickly walked away.

  


I was about forty-five feet from the office and could see the building. It was in the new style that all billionaires liked, with plants all over it thinking they’re helping the air quality; I guess this one had a green thumb. I checked the networks to see if I could find the monster's avatar anywhere. Nothing was on the radar, so I kept walking while keeping my ear and eye out for anything. Throughout that time, the main problem was that there was a breeze. That stopped when I got to the building. Weirdly, no one was around, not even a receptionist to greet me; the front door was also unlocked.There was an AI, but it was a simple one that popped up with an arrow pointing at an elevator; it was green with roses on it. I didn't think much about it. I got into the elevator; it was nothing special, it had a wallpaper of foliage; besides that, it was normal. The doors closed and the elevator began moving without me pushing any buttons. It seemed to be taking me to the penthouse, the top floor. 



I am not a religious person. What I saw on that floor made me question everything.



The elevator opened and I walked out as I saw a woman who was ten feet tall, wearing a white nightgown with green, red, and blue flowers that was interwoven into the fabric; it was beautiful. That's when my implant shorted out, and had to turn it off due to the age counter being unable to determine her age. She was staring at a plant, mumbling to herself. She sounded like she was speaking in multiple languages. I caught some things she was saying.

**\*\*The Woman\*\*** ""Death, my children, eating, slaving."" Then she looked at me. I was used to taking a beating, thus why I made sure to get a strong implant. I was used to people with speed implants and even other hackers, but this woman was on a whole new fucken level. She grabbed me by the neck. I could barely get any air.  She screamed loudly in a way that I could barely hear her. I remember her saying.

**\*\*The Woman\*\*** ""What are you doing here?! Here to take me! Take me to your filthy, unholy landfills! Why couldn't you just be good?! Why must you hurt? Why must you hate?"" I got a good look at her face.

Her left side was charred and scarred, like someone had placed half of her face in a fire. Her other side looked to be in her late 30s. I could say she was the most beautiful woman that I have seen despite the bruns and scars. She was angry and had a murderous grip on my throat. She was probably about to snap my neck until I heard another voice. It was a man's voice. I was about to blackout, but I believe, with a silky but calm tone, the man said,

**\*\*The man\*\***""Darling, please, it's time for bed. I'll take care of this for you. Please drop this girl.""  She could have been a bit more gentle about it instead of throwing me against the wall knocking the wind from me. I was trying to catch my breath, and that’s when the man leaned over me and spoke with that same silky, smooth voice.

**\*\*The man\*\*** ""Are you OK? My wife hasn't been the same since the children of this land stopped caring about her plants."" I think that is what he said.

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""She’s an asshole"" I said through gasping breaths

**\*\*The man\*\*** ""Validated but rude."" He stood up, he seemed to be just as tall if not taller than that woman and left the hallway. I slowly got up, wanting to give him a piece of my mind. I started walking

**\*\*The man\*\*** ""I'm in the living room on your right."" I heard the voice and saw him in his living room, making himself a drink from his large bar. He asked if I wanted Anything, and I simply stared daggers at him. He shrugged and sat down on a built-in couch in the living room.

**\*\*The man\*\*** ""What are you doing here at this hour? I'm sure we didn't set up an appointment together."" he took a sip of his drink. I stayed silent and walked in front of him. He was clearly in his 40s and was built like a bodybuilder with a massive white beard, a full head of hair, and two golden eyes.

**\*\*The man\*\*** ""So the strong sound type, then? Luckily, I like the sound of my own voice. I think introductions are in order. You can call me Mr. Golden Eyes. Do you have a name, I prefer last names?"" I gave him my name, which I will not give here. I will say hacker for me from now on.

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""That's a lovely name, Hacker,"" he said in a jovial tone, 

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Now that introductions are done. Why are you here? I'm pretty sure you're not here to talk to my wife,"" he said with a chuckle

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""I'm here because I accidentally unleashed a monster upon the world from your fucken company. Luckily, I already killed it. I want answers now!”  He was taking a sip of his drink as he looked at me. 

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Monster? Oh? Oooh, I know what you're talking about now. Yeah, that isn't a monster."" he said with a nonchalant tone. I looked at him puzzled.

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""That's an extinct species of the Animal Kingdom.""

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""Come again?""

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Yeah, it was recreated from evolution. I believe it evolved from the Pygopodidae or as you would know them as legless lizards. This one just happened to develop legs in its evolution"" He said with a tone of excitement.

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""So you're telling me you created a giant killer snake for a pharmaceutical company?!"" I said in exasperation.

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Yeah, that's the front,"" he said calmly. “I guess technically I did make it or at least accelerated. It's evolution."" my eyes grew wide

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""But why?!""

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Oh, Apologies. I did it because humans don't have any natural predators anymore, so I thought I would help bring one in"" he said in a casual tone.

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""So you're a psycho then.""

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""No, I am completely sane. It's in my nature."" 

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""You just told me that you're making monsters to eat people."" 

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Yes, because one species needs at least one predator to keep down their numbers. If not, its environment will suffer for it. Why do you think my wife is so angry?""

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""Because she's a crazy psychotic bitch with too many implants in her."" he laughed

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""No, no, no, nothing of the sort. It's because she created the environment. That's why she's so angry."" I was silent because I thought I was talking to a crazy person—a huge fucken crazy person

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""OK, you don't believe me. Let me show you.""

He picked up a medium-sized potted plant, but it looked small in his hand.

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Right, you see this?"" I nodded.

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""This is Sawgrass, and it will, in a matter of moments, have the traits of a Venus flytrap."" Nothing happened for at least a minute; I was about to say something. Until the plant started to grow petals and then mouths like a Venus flytrap. I stammered out.

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""Eh, The fuck?! how?""

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Well, my dear, it's called conversion evolution. It's where two animal species having the same evolutionary niches; think sharks and dolphins, for instance."" I stopped him before he could explain more, mainly because I already knew this.

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""No, how did you do that?!"" I motioned towards the plant

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Well, I'll say this: it wasn't easy. Sawgrass and venus flytraps have different niches.However if you really want the answer, I created the concept of evolution. I still remember the day when I put the chemicals in to make your ancestors."" I couldn’t believe what I was hearing

 **\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""You're telling me that you are god?"" he burst out laughing.

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Technically yes, but technically no. I would say it's more of a hobby. To which fact: I can do this too."" he pointed his finger at me, turned on my implant, and spoke through it without moving his lips.

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Anything that my creations make, I can control it. Before you ask it, it's all in the radio waves and things you wouldn't even be able to understand."" 



I still had my gun. I looked at the counter and had one bullet left. I shot him in the head. His head went back onto the couch. I was shocked mainly because of how easy it was to shoot “god” in the head. I looked to my right, and I saw his wife looking at me with two piercing glowing green eyes and a very angry expression on her face. Then Mr. Golden Eye's hand slowly went up towards his head with his thumb and index finger as they got thinner going 

towards his forehead where I shot him. I heard something wet as he pulled out the bullet from his head. His wife spoke with what sounded a deep growl. 

**\*\*The Woman\*\*** ""You should've let me kill it."" Mr. Golden eyes lifted his head, looking at the bullet and quickly flicking it off into the corner.

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Honey, I said I would take care of it… Please go to bed,"" he said, slightly annoyed.

**\*\*The Woman\*\*** ""I want to stay to see what happens next."" She said in that same deep growl.

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Ok fine, but let me take care of it,"" he said in a defeated tone. She stayed quiet, just staring at me.



**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Right now, what I will do because you were rude, and made quite a mess behind me. I will let you go with a quarter of a million for whatever you want to do because I'm feeling generous. You can use that money to tell everyone what you saw. Right now, from what I saw on the News, they're saying it's a terrorist that attacked my pharmacy, but I know exactly what it is, and you know as well.""

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""Isn't it just a giant lizard snake thing, and seriously? A quarter of a million?"" I said, confused and surprised.

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""It's related to them. But what do you say? Would you like an answer of what the creature is?""

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""Fuck it, why not, take it away I guess.""

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""So there was an Aztec god called Quetzalcoatl. This creature was linked to this God. But it was an entire species of giant, flying, feathered lizards that lost their back legs during its evolution; they were called Amphiptere. Sadly, they went extinct because they had no megafauna to hunt. They would become smaller and smaller until they became the Pygopodidae or at least a variant of them. However, one group split off because they adapted a new trait, a bizarre trait that could go through sound and code. This was very useful until one of them went deeper and became something called a Basilisk. It was a brilliant creature with one problem; he couldn't feed normally. He fed on knowledge and awareness of it. I believe you will know this one very well.""

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""Roko's Basilisk?"" I said with a slight tremor. He grinned and said.

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""The very one. He nearly died when people began to figure him out and stopped researching and forgetting about it. With that its food source was limited. There's more to it, but that's the most straightforward way to say what happened to him.I believe you're a smart girl, and obviously you already researched him.

Fast forward 50 years. My poor wife was very sick, and still is. She was crying and bawling, saying that they're killing my creations; why would they do this? So I told her I would take care of it, creating Rex Lacertarum Digitalis or the Digital lizard king.""

I was speechless; I felt like I was going crazy from what I was hearing.

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""I can see the look in your eyes. I would say take the money and live off grid. I believe an old friend is gonna stop by and say hi roundabout now."" he said, pointing his finger at his TV.

I quickly moved out of the way as the slithering monster fell out of the TV and onto the floor. It looked like half of his body was broken, which was most likely the case with the semi. It stared daggers into me as it crawled itself to Mr. Golden eyes. He put down his drink on his coffee table and started comforting it. 

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""I know, I know, it hurts, but don't worry, you'll be healed up soon, and hey, for being such a good boy, why not give you a couple of friends?"" he said in a loving voice. The woman was still keeping an eye on me occasionally, glancing at the monster. This went on for about two minutes until, eventually, I said. 

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""Fine, but I'll take your money.""

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Wonderful! Honestly, I don't need money. Here, you can take all of it home if you want.""

He gave me over $25 billion. When I saw this, I became dizzy from the amount of money in my account. I looked at him and said,

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""We will not meet again."" The woman moved towards the couch and said nothing while still giving me that death glare. Mr. Golden Eyes was not really paying attention and just said,

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Yes, yes, have a good life and make the fortunes of evolution be ever in your favor.""



I walked out of the building, bought myself a new car, and started driving around to new stations, and that's how I got here. Telling old people that monsters exist. That's the end of my station statement.

We started in Tokyo and this week at Kyoto. Our first week in Tokyo we spent two days at the onsens and eversince then, I do not feel well. Something is wrong. I started having cold sweats, feeling hot and cold worhout fever. Today, ~10days, I am feeling nauseated and bloated.  Tokyo was a nightmare experience since the hotel, mystays, was having issues with the smell and the room was not clean and small. There were so much people each time we go out and it was very stressful taking the train and busses.  I have an Asian ethnicity, but I grew up in America. I do not feel warm and welcome even though we have spent massive amount of money here supposely for a comfortable vacation.  The people are always rushing and to themselves only. Overall, I thought I would enjoy vacationing in Japan, but it is completely opposite.  I canceled the rest of my trip and pay additional fees to go to Vietnam instead, for the rest of our vacation.

I'm still nauseated. I ate lots of raw fishes and noodles. I'm not sure if spending too much time in the hotsprings has something to do with my symptoms or eating too much raw fishes.  At my hotel in Kyoto, Hilton Garden, I woke up late and went down for breakfast. The breakfast close at 10am and I was there at approximately 930am. While I was trying to get food, the Japanese female came and told to that I need to hurry up because they will close at 10am. There were others non-Asian tourists came down late for breakfast but i didnt see that they were being told to hurry up. After then, she wouldn't let me having my coffee since it's past 10am. Another female staff then was going to charge me 600 yen for a cup of tea.  Although I pay about almost $200/night, but this is how I'm being treated. While I was sitting at the table, she later requested that we move to another table since those dinning tables needed to be cleaned up after complementary breakfast. This is not just the experience i had here in Kyoto, but everywhere i go in Japan. Omg. I'm so over with Japan. I feel like the Japanese think that they are better than other Asians.  It's ridiculous. They appear polite but racist and conceited. I feel like I'm wasting so much money here for a mediocre experience. I had a very respectful and honorable expectations of the people and country.  However, in reality, it's so materialistic here.  I hated this trip. I can't wait to get out of this country. I never had this kind of interaction with Japanese, but this trip change my feeling of the country and its people. I regret coming here. What a waste of money, times, and efforts. They will never see me stepping my foot here again.",1,1747032483.0,u_Dependent-Intern-464,0,1.0,False

We tried dating twice, and each time she ended things soon after we got together. It was a month after the first break-up when she returned the first time. I never really got a reason why; all I know is that she was interested in me and strong feelings, but those feelings were “fleeting”.

A month after the second break-up, she contacted me and invited me to go on a week-long trek in a mountain range not far from the city where we live. I agreed, because I have never been to this mountain range, and we are both keen hikers/climbers. I agreed, even though I was still in pain, because I wanted this new experience, and it is a place I have always wanted to visit.She has other guy friends, so why did she invite me? We’ve seen each other in person twice since the break-up, and she still follows me everywhere on social media and often likes my content and stories.   
  
She could have cut me off and found other guys, but why hold onto me? I’ve tried in the last 2 months to hang out; just coffee or go for a walk, but she has always had plans or been busy, which is true, since I’ve seen her post about her activities online. She also recently posted a story about the perfect guy would be one who invites her to go for a walk in a forest, and he takes nice photos of her, and at the same time, I can see what posts she’s liked - some of them are about being happily single. I guess we have a similar algorithm on Instagram. Maybe she is emotionally immature, confused, or whatever.. I really have no idea.   
  
We have similar hobbies, we can talk for hours about our interests, and when we are together, I just get the feeling we are very comfortable with one another. So why does she follow me, seems to enjoy me contacting her, and why did she invite me of all people?",1,1747032107.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

It Wasn’t Love (Until It Was All of It)      
       
It wasn’t love.        
Not at first.        
You were just        
there -        
coffee, silence,        
a shoulder that didn’t ask for anything back.      
       
I liked that you didn’t try too hard         
to make anything beautiful.         
         
You laughed like you’d forgotten how,         
and I didn’t say anything        
because I knew that sound.        
         
We stayed close in the way people do      
who aren’t sure they’re allowed to ask for more.        
And I didn’t.       
Not for a long time.        
        
Then you said something -       
something ordinary,       
something dumb,        
and my chest cracked open like       
it had been waiting for an excuse        
to stop bracing.        
       
I laughed.       
And I hated how much it sounded like       
relief.         
        
I started to notice        
my hands shaking before I typed you anything.           
Started checking myself         
in mirrors         
in meetings          
in moments       
you weren’t even in.       
Like I needed to become the version       
you already saw.       
        
And that scared the shit out of me.        
           
Because I’ve made love         
a project before.         
I’ve tried to earn it.        
To translate it into performance        
and overthinking          
and not needing anything back.         
         
But you -        
you ruined that.        
         
You made it unprofessional.         
You made it dangerous.          
You made it loud.        
           
You made me write this.          
        
You -          
with your ridiculous laugh         
and your eyes          
like they’ve already seen how this ends        
and still stayed.         
And your way of touching my back           
like it’s the first language we both forgot        
but still dream in.         
           
And once,           
I tried to text you how much you meant -       
but autocorrect changed “love” to “live,”        
and I sent it anyway.            
Because even that felt too honest.         
         
You -           
who I’d reshape my hours for,          
even though I hate the shape of time.           
Not because I’m generous -        
but because you deserve         
the structure I never gave myself.       
       
And I still don’t know        
how to talk about love         
without sounding like a man         
trying to pass an exam         
he didn’t study for.       
          
So I stopped trying to explain it.        
I just said your name        
and listened to what it did         
to my voice.         
          
This is not tidy.        
This is not safe.          
This is every deadline I ever missed        
because I was too busy        
imagining your voice         
saying my name          
like a secret      
and not a warning.      
        
I don’t love you carefully.        
I love you        
like the building is on fire         
and you’re the only thing I carry out.         
Every        
damn        
time.        
And I’d do it again.        
And I’d do it worse.          
Just to be near you        
when it breaks.

And medication since then.
It's helped me a lot, but not sure about the mood swings. 
It's enabled me to have a bit more control over my life for example keep track of periods. 
They are all over the place but now I notice that I get severe PMDD sometimes. I feel extremely hormonal certain times a month. (Both the ""I wanna die"" and the "" I wanna f*** bits"" to an extreme) 
But in the past year I think my menopause has started. 
I am so tired all the time. I have tons of brain fog despite the medicine sometimes. 
Sometimes it gets so bad I just have to sit down on the floor and give up because I'm so confused/flustered/annoyed/stressed my brain shut down completely and I feel sort of demented. Barely sure where I am or what I'm doing and what's happening around me. I can't do anything at all for a bit.
I have been having a growing sense of 'hating my husband'.
He seems like a child to me. Constantly in the way, helpless, does everything wrong, just generally so annoying to me.
I love my husband, and he's a really good guy. But I just hate him most the time at the moment. 
I prefer if he's not around at all. 
He annoys me by 'looking at his phone' because I know the dishwasher needs emptying... but if he does that it annoys me because he does it too loudly. 
There's no telling when this hateful mood comes on, often totally out of nowhere. 
He seems almost a bit scared of me these days, with good reason I guess!
And to be honest most the time I feel like I JUST CANT STAND HIM!!! 
But I love him😂😫 
It's only been about 6 months of this and I don't know how much longer he can handle this... or I can. 
An example of what brought me here today:

This AM I made him coffee. Let him do his thing and stayed out of the way. (Kept to myself as I felt a bit.... fury)
Then after he's had the kitchen to himself for half an hour or so, having his coffee and reading news or whatever in peace and quiet...

Finally it's my turn for my coffee! And just as it's almost ready and I just need to reach for a filter, there he is, now starting to sort his lunch pack or something. And mega in the way of everything I'm trying to 'just get done' and have waited for for (feels like) BERY long time...
I just want to finish making my coffee😫😫 please just get out of the way for ONE minute!!!

This causes me to go into a complete wrath. I literally throw clean dishes into the cupboards and throw dirty stuff into the dishwasher (also a bit surprised myself at the sheer volume of fury inside me) 
He leaves also in a fury to work.
Now we both feel bad all day and he ""wants to have a serious talk about our morning routine"" which makes me even more furious because the morning routine is 'I run around and do everything and you procrastinate on the internet until you're almost late, unless we have an argument and you then actually do something and leave on time...

Ok that was a rant. 
But I'm new to this.
Is this how it's gonna be!?
Do I have to go to a desert island or something...? Is there a place where they keep us until it over or something? 

Pls do tell me a bit about your experiences... I wanna cry:( ",2,1747031989.0,Perimenopause,1,1.0,False

My baby is under a year old still. Last year in was still pregnant on mother's day, so my husband didn't do anything for me because I ""wasn't a mom yet."" So this year I thought I might get a little more from him. For context, both mine and his mothers live very close to us so all of us got together today to ""celebrate"".  My husband decided that his gift to all 3 of us was going to be to cook dinner, which is something he does often for holidays and birthdays. He let his mom pick dinner and my mom pick dessert. 
He works the early shift, gets up at 2am and in bed by 6:30pm every day. On his way home from work this morning, I asked him to pick out a card for both of our mom's since I knew he was stopping at the store for last minute dinner items. He came home with 2 cards. I did not get a card from him. He told me that cards were expensive and there wasn't a lot to choose from. He said that he had texted me happy mother's day this morning, which he did. 
He spent yesterday and this morning prepping. So i didn't really get to hang out with him before we left to my mom's for dinner at 2pm. My mom was the only one to wish me a happy mothers day. My dad and brothers did not. My husband was finishing up dinner, and occasionally coming into the living room to talk to his mom and then going back in the kitchen. When dinner was ready, everyone ate while I fed the baby. My brothers, parents, and in laws all ate while dinner was hot. After dinner was done and the baby fed, I quickly ate and then, because it's my moms mother's day too and I'm not there to ruin her kitchen, I started cleaning up. Nobody helped me. My dad and brother were playing a video game, my mom was minding the baby. My husband and in laws sat at the table talking. They all had dessert while I was cleaning up the kitchen after my husband. I did not have dessert because by the time I was done, it was time to start packing up the baby and the leftovers and head home so my husband could go to bed on time. We got home, he put everything on the counter and then said goodnight and went to bed. He did not wish me a happy mother's day face to face. 

All I wanted today was to go and get an iced coffee. I feel like my mother's day was terrible and I feel so unseen by my family. But I also feel guilty for not being ""grateful"" for the dinner that was actually delicious. It took time away from us being together as a family. AIO? Is mother's day always disappointing?

 My dad abusive and bipolar. One second he could he cracking jokes and having the time of his life, then out of no where he would scream and beat me if he got mad. He gets mad at the smallest things imaginable. I remember when I was 11 years old I dropped a glass of coffee from the fridge on accident and it broke and spilt all over the floor. My dad ran over all the way from the living and just started screaming at me and hit me multiple times. He did this in front of my two younger cousins who were in the kitchen with me. From what I remember my dad has always been like this (even with my siblings) and I’ve had no one to talk to about this. I’ve tried talking to my mom about it and asking her for help but she always tells me,”he’s doing this for the best of you” and “he loves you though.” I also have 2 older siblings, one brother (30) and one sister (27). I’ve tried talking to my siblings about it but will just say the same things every single time. “We had it worse than you” or “He’s doing this for the best of you” or “it’s not the end of the world.” I tried telling myself this stuff, and believing that things would get better but it just made me feel like no one was there for me when my dad would act out. I was always confused on the way i felt. I felt as if my feelings were wrong or invalid in some type of way. I remember when I was younger I would always question myself. “why doss my dad does this to me?” and if he even loved me. I felt as if I was the reason why he did not love me, like I was the problem. Every time I see one of my friends have a good, loving relationship with their dads I always think to myself “why not me?” I just wish to have that kind of relationship with my dad. I’ve only seen my dad as a violent man with major anger issues who’s a perfectionist. The main thing he focuses on about me is my grades, which I 100% get because grades are important, but is it really more important than the well-being of your daughter? My dad would yell at me, threaten me, and BEAT ME over my grades. Mind you, I maintain my grades very well and I have straight A’s but sometimes I would get a few Bs here and there. The littlest mistake I could make involving my academics will bring out the worst of my dad. Recently, I slacked off from doing my homework in Science to focus on getting the best grade possible for my Science STATE TEST.(which literally determines where my placement is in high school) When my dad figured out my A dropped to a B+ he freaked out. He just yelled and screamed at me, not letting me explain my mistake. I then went into a room with my sister’s cat, trying to calm myself down. Then he barges in, screaming at me to come out. He sits me down on the couch, I already knew what was coming. My “dad” gave me a chance to explain to him why my grade dropped. (he really didn’t) I tried explaining but he just kept yelling over me, leading to me to raise my voice so he would actually hear me, obviously he did not knowing the kind of person he is. This triggered him so he just started repetitively hitting my head. Once he was done he screamed at me to go upstairs and sat back down on the couch that he literally beat me on. I cried myself to sleep that night. I always wonder why my dad doesn’t love me, no matter how much effort I put in, and no matter how hard I try to forgive him and love him.

Merulias had led them to a barn for the night. Using hay as a bed they had laid down barely aware of where they were. Dean felt exhausted despite the bit of sleep he had. The sun was just rising yet he knew they had to move on, partly because the farmer wouldn’t like guests and partly because Dean’s uncle surely wouldn’t just give up. Rubbing his eyes, he got up to wake Mellissa who lay hidden under his coat. Reluctantly she rose, plucking hay out of her hair. Their new companion was already leaving, convincing them to hurry. The sun was pleasant and warm, promising a nice summer day.

“So where are you two headed,” Merulias asked casually as they strolled over the field. 

“We thought about getting out of Britain.” Mellissa answered with a hint of uncertainty.

“Not going to take back your home from dear old uncle?” The demon countered. “Thought you to be a fighter,” he continued in a slightly disappointed tone.

“My uncle is almost as powerful as my father was.”

“And you are his nephew.”

“I…” Dean trailed off causing Merulias to turn around in expectation. “I can’t fight him.” He confessed.

“Can’t,” the demon repeated, raising one eyebrow and staring at them, making Dean shift uncomfortably. 

“My father was a great occultist. And a benevolent, loving man. He tried to teach me…”

“Dean, don’t.” Mellissa interrupted him, laying her hand on his arm. Her blue eyes spoke a thousand words. She didn’t trust Merulias and Dean had to admit he didn’t want to tell the stranger too much. But something inside told him to take a leap of faith.

“It’s okay, my love.” He smiled reassuringly, before picking up the thread. “I am a failure. I can’t even do a simple summoning or protection spell. My uncle was a good man too. Until he found out that his useless nephew should inherit the family instead of him. What good is an occultist who can’t use the gift, he would say.”

For a moment Merulias was lost in thoughts, then a smirk formed on his lips.

“I might be able to help you.”

“Are you proposing a deal?” Dean asked slightly alarmed if he had made a mistake. But he didn’t see cold calculation behind the demon’s eyes as there should have been.

“I said ‘might’. No use in making a deal if I am not sure. I don’t make promises I can’t keep. Words are binding.”

With eyes full of joy, he shifted to a more formal tone yet a hint of mischief had sneaked itself into the demon’s voice. 

“Mister Calderwood,” he took off his hat and bowed slightly to Mellissa. “My dear lady, I would like to invite you to a tour through the Highlands. Sadly, I don’t have any money.” Upon speaking the last sentence he showed an empty pocket and looked mockingly at Dean. Who showed a handful of cash from his pocket. 

“Don’t worry,” he said, “I managed to take my finances with me.”

“Splendid.” Merulias smiled, placing his hat back on the black hair. He turned around and lit a cigarette.

“Do you enjoy smoking?” Dean wondered.

“I do. Must have picked it up from your kind. We have to catch the train bound for Edinburgh.” Suddenly, Dean’s stomach made an unmistakable sound.

“Sorry,” he muttered embarrassed, a look at his fiancée told him she needed as much a decent meal as he did. 

“We will pick something up along the way.” Merulias said without stopping.



The ride took several hours but the couple didn’t mind. They had all been eager to leave London behind and Dean’s own butterflies didn’t settle down until the train had been on the move for two hours. They had managed to buy bread in a small bakery and had shared it before succumbing to exhaustion. Dean had aimed to stay awake in case something happened or their guide decided to betray them after all. His body however didn’t share his fears and before he knew, he had entered a state of dreamless sleep. When Merulias woke them, his mind was rested, yet his neck was stiff and his backside screamed for him to finally get on his feet and walk a bit. The last minutes of the drive they gazed out of the window feasting their eyes upon the landscape. Merulias too gazed outwards, if demons had use for such things anyway. Dean hadn’t met many demons, but the books spoke of beings not to be angered or disrespected. And always out for making a deal or wreaking havoc. Merulias seemed, different. His mind really appeared to wander to some distant place. None of them spoke a word. It wasn’t awkward, just peaceful. Up until the point where Dean couldn’t suppress a laughter at the absurdity of their situation. 

“What is it?” Mellissa asked, still half-asleep.

“I just had to think about how we ended up on a train to Scotland with a demon as tour guide.” A new laughter formed in his throat before he was able to prevent it.

“It is rather funny,” she agreed smiling while she studied the man sitting opposite of them. Arms crossed he leaned backwards; his hazel eyes fixed on something in the landscape. 



Edinburgh was a lively city full of shops and people. Steamy smoke filled the air around the train and the chatter of people made it almost impossible to talk. As a boy, he had often been with his father when he did have a task to fulfil. Back then, big cities seemed wondrous to the young Dean Calderwood. But now it filled him with worry. Alleys and crowds made it easy for his uncle to send men after them. What if he knew they were here? Lost in worries Dean noticed how Mellissa tugged at his coat.

“Everything all right, Dean?” She asked in a worried tone reflecting his own thoughts.

“I am fine,” he lied. “I am just not sure about what we are doing here.”

“I am with you. Whatever happens,” she said in a determined voice, making him relax a bit. Merulias could have easily done something whilst they were asleep. He didn’t seem to be a threat, and with a demon by their side his uncle could send as many men as he liked. They exited the train station in search of something warm to drink. In comparison to London, Edinburgh seemed a tad calmer. The city was inhabited mostly by bankers and lawyers and was active mostly in the business of printing and brewing. Rain fell in a steady drizzle, forcing Dean to button his coat to keep out the moisture. The trio found a small café where Dean and Mellissa could warm up with some coffee. Merulias refused to enter but assured them to wait outside. Dean didn’t object, it would give them some time to ponder on the situation in private. Dry air and the spreading warmth of the coffee gave Dean new life. 

“Do you think we can trust him?” He whispered to Mellissa, casting a glance at the figure outside again and again.

“I don’t know.” She answered thoughtfully, “but he hasn’t given us any reason to not trust him.”

“He is a demon for God’s sake, Mellissa.” Dean muttered agitated, Merulias was behaving as if there was someone else out there. At once the old familiar distrust surrounded his thoughts again.

“We should ask him where he is taking us.”

“He could just be lying.” Dean’s thoughts were running in circles without any evidence or meaning, he knew that. Suddenly Merulias started to walk out of his view. 

“Where is he going?” Alarmed, he got up and outside, Mellissa followed. Merulias had disappeared around the corner to their left. Carefully the pair sneaked after him. Looking around the corner, they saw him disappear into an alleyway with long, confident strides, the open coat floating behind. Avoiding a carriage, they went after the demon. Peeking around the corner he saw another man face to face with Merulias.

“That sneaky bastard is betraying us after all.” As soon as Dean had said the words confirming his suspicions, the strange man drew an oddly formed dagger. Aimed for Merulias’ throat the weapon sliced the air as the demon dodged with lightning speed. Merulias drew his sword again like the last time, but the two opponents were even in strength and so the fight dragged on. 

“We should help him, Dean.” Mellissa implied firmly.

“How? I can’t do anything.” Dean’s heart stopped a moment when two more men stepped out of the shadows wielding similar daggers. The young man had to admit their supernatural guide was a good fighter. He jumped and parried, one time he managed to kick one of the attackers. Hit by the full force the man skidded over the muddy cobblestones, before getting up and back into the fight. The sound of ripping fabric distracted Merulias for a moment, a kick in the chest followed, throwing him out of balance.

“Dean! There has to be something. He saved our lives.” Dean thought frantically about a way to help. What was the easiest thing he could hope to accomplish. Protection wasn’t going to help; Merulias was already fighting. And a spell to deflect demons couldn’t be used. Then the idea came. Out of his pocket Dean pulled a piece of chalk, he was certain he would never be able to use it. And yet he carried it at all times, perhaps because it reminded him of his old man. Perhaps because he was desperate, it didn’t matter now. In his head he already saw the symbol. One of the daggers found its mark and buried itself in Merulias upper leg, causing him to fall with a curse. The sword slid out of his grasp and fell clinging to the ground. But Dean had already drawn the symbol on the ground. Doubt tried to keep him from going on but he ignored it. He knew the procedures; he knew what to do and how it should feel. ‘Please Father, let me get this right for once.’ 

“Merulias get to the left!” Dean called out before unleashing the spell. The demon looking as confused as relieved, rolled to the side just in time to avoid the coming shockwave. Two of his attackers weren’t that lucky, standing in the path of devastation they got carried through the alley and hit the next wall crossing their path. 

“I did it…” Dean exclaimed breathlessly, falling to his trembling knees. Exhaustion and happiness seized his body and mind alike. Merulias had used the opportunity to get the upper hand. Pressing his attacker against the wall he pulled the weapon out of his leg. 

“Belemir, trying to kill me now, are we?” Merulias said in a feigned hurt tone. His face showed an amused smile but his eyes burned with something Dean couldn’t quite name. It almost looked like a mixture of anger and sadness. Could demons feel, he wondered. Ignoring the dagger at his throat the man named Belemir answered, his voice dripping with hatred and disgust. 

“We won’t be the last to hunt you. And you are weak. The humans have rubbed off on you. Sooner or later, he’ll get you. You are no longer m-…” Belemir’s words turned into a gurgle as Merulias cut his throat without hesitation. 

The demon turned away; the mask of amusement had vanished from his face. 

“We should hurry to the next train. Those two won’t sleep for long.” Merulias growled gesturing over his shoulder at the two motionless bodies.

“Where are you taking us?” Dean asked, not planning to go anywhere without answers. Slowly the demon turned back to them, a shadow of what might have been regret quickly changed into a smile. He adjusted his hat and lit a cigarette, “nice trick back there.” He said in his usual carefree manner. But that just infuriated Dean further. He wanted to know what was going on. The risk of walking into a trap was too great.

“You can’t just expect me to follow you blindly. Those men are demons, isn’t that right? Why are they hunting you? And why should I trust you? One can’t trust humans these days, even less demons.” As quickly as the rage had come as quickly it was gone with the many questions Dean demanded answers for. The demon didn’t seem in the slightest impressed, puffing his cigarette in silence while listening. Then he replied calmly like a parent instructing his offspring for the third time. 

“I am taking you to the Highlands. There is a witch, who could help you. I won’t ask you to trust me. But one way or the other, I have to leave now.” Dean felt guilty for interrogating Merulias in such a manner. Something troubled the demon and he had nothing better to do than finding a reason to not trust him. Sensing his distress Mellissa took his hand and squeezed to reassure him.

“No, you are right. We agreed to this. It was foolish of me.”

“Don’t worry,” Merulias replied, showing no signs of ill will. “We all carry our burdens. Now, let’s get a wriggle on.”



The next ride didn’t take long, yet the couple used the time to catch some sleep. They hadn’t spoken about the other demons which had attacked their companion. Dean didn’t want to intrude; it didn’t concern him. Nevertheless, he sensed an underlying tension in the demon’s behaviour. Whenever he was in thoughts, his teeth were clenched tightly and his eyes clouded as if remembering something from a long time ago. It was late in the evening when they reached Inverness. From here on out they would have to walk. The drizzle had stopped and a cold wind blew through the empty streets. As they entered the open wilderness leading deeper into the Highlands, Dean stopped. 

“We can’t continue in this darkness. It’s too dangerous.” He raised one foot from the muddy ground to emphasise his words, the motion was accompanied by a sucking sound.

“We can’t wait for the morning,” Merulias insisted, looking around as if to check that nobody was listening. In the blink of an eye the man transformed into a black horse. 

“I didn’t know demons could do that.”

“Well, I can,” the horse answered as a matter of fact. “You can ride I hope,” He smirked mockingly.

“I never rode without a saddle.” Mellissa mused while stroking the silky pelt.

“I’ll be careful then.” 

Dean first helped Mellissa then climbed onto Merulias’ back himself. The demon seemed to have no difficulties carrying them through the foggy night. The only sound was the distant hooting of an owl and the smell of rain wafted in the air. It almost felt like a romantic ride through the peaceful landscape, only with a talking horse. After a while Mellissa started speaking to Merulias, who relentlessly trotted on, on this uneven ground. 

“Do you miss Hell? It’s your home, isn’t it?”

“What’s there not to miss?” Merulias laughed ironically. “It’s always warm, the company never changes and the screams of the tortured souls echo wherever you go.” His voice grew sombre as he continued lost in memories. “It wasn’t a bad place, there are worse options. It is lonely though. And things seem to have changed drastically since I left. And I don’t think for the better.”

“Demons aren’t the family type I guess.”

“Demons are fond of hierarchy. You don’t have friends. You are weak, you are at the bottom. And when you don’t show your strength at every turn to your competitors you are weak.”

“But you are not like this. I saw you look at Belemir.”

“Belemir was what you might call a good man by human standards. I didn’t want him dead.” He chuckled at his own mood, “must have gone native.”

“How long since you left Hell?” Dean wondered out loud.

“Roughly 500 years.”

“What does one do in all this time…”

Merulias was back at his carefree self when he answered. “You always find something to do.”

“But don’t demons usually spread wickedness and evil?” Dean continued still trying to wrap his mind around the revelation. The demon stopped lost in thought.

“I think…” he started before falling silent again. “I believe every creature can change. I believe everyone does change. Even supernatural entities like me.” He turned his head and smiled at them in his horse form, looking a bit uncertain. “Don’t get me wrong. I have done evil. But perhaps humanity has shown me how to change.”

Hi! 24 F, no diagnosis of anything,  no family history of anything except for heart and diabetes, only taking vitamins for immune system and Vitamin D (I'm deficient lol)


Already went to two GIs and 4 PCPs these past two months. Still, I needed your insights on this one as I have been experiencing rather odd symtomps and I'm on my way to schedule a colonscopy by the end of this month.

So for context, I was a regular goer. I drink coffee and I poop regularly. I think the symtomps all started when the stress and anxiety came crashing down on me due to me having a health anxiety scare (rabies scare lol) and you know, stuffs in college. I had a CT scan last year because I was complaining of something in my right side (doctor suspected appendix but when they looked at my scans, it was absolutely perfect)

This started around March second week, I've noticed my input of food is not reflecting to the output I'm making. Went to PCP, got prescribed psyllium fiber. It worsened my functional constipation, so had to go to a gastroenterologist, told me I was fine and I just needed to fix my diet.

Well, as you all expected, it didn't. My poop either is yellowish with pasty consistency or just brown. Had an instance of blood two times (one is after i did a transrectum ultrasound, the other is when i forced myself to shit for fecalysis). But at the last week of April, I became suddenly regular like stool consistency, shape, all normal (except that it was floating all the time) so I thought well, maybe I was getting better. My tummy said uh no and this week, I suddenly became constipated again (Type 2 bristol stools). There's that slightly burning feeling travelling down from my upper abdomen to my lower abdomen. One day, I'll have more gas, the other day I'll have less. I burp a lot, like if I feel some air, I let it out. 

I had bloodwork, whole abdomen ultrasound (I did this because I was complaining of floating stools and also to see if I had lesions or anything), ECG, fecalysis, urinalysis done, all came back normal. If someone points out gallbladder or liver or pancreas, the radiologist noted that they didn't see any abnormalities. My bloodwork's all in the normal ranges (except the uric acid, slightly elevated). My last step will be gastroscopy and colonoscopy to see the insides of my GI (which I haven't done since I have to arrange some paperworks first to my HMO before doing it.)

Any advice what this might be? I went back to my gastro (second one lol) and he advice me to just eat fiber, hydrate and whatever but I'm not entirely convinced so I'd go back to my first GI (he's the one who said if I want to see something wrong, just do a colonoscopy)

I'm scared shitless of having the big C so I've been going in and out of hospitals just to advocate and let GIs hear me out, they said they couldn't risk doing colonoscopy done to me but I beg to differ. I think doing colonoscopy is a great idea and it's a gold standard for seeing some things in your GI.

 I followed advice from some of you  to give up all sweeteners, and that worked! But at one point I was getting too few calories / burning too much, and since I was really tired (getting more than enough electrolytes) I decided to add some heavy cream for extra calories and carbs. Every day for three days my intake of the stuff increased, which was fine cause my calories and carbs were very low, untill one day I just drank half a liter and then took to the store to buy some chocolate and cookies. I didn't even crave any on the first ten days! 

I really feel that for me, cutting out all sweeteners and keto treats is the way to go, but the heavy cream needs to go as well. It's too delicious, and also the product with the most carbs per serving I eat. I ended up just drinking decaf coffee with heavy cream all day long.

\[Secretary Speaker\]

It’s bad that this is one of your better times.



\[Secretary Speaker\]

I’m warning you now when the boss looks at this \[they\] are not going to be happy.

So as our new assistant director you are required to relocate to our private headquarters, that will be in an undisclosed location for upmost privacy. 



\[Secretary Speaker\]

Don’t worry, (hon) all expenses paid. We will be getting into your home though, just so we can safeguard all your important documents and keepsakes in our vault.

\[Boss Speaker\]

What is this? This is your promotion, that you must have been working so hard for. Otherwise I’d hate to think you dared to work yourself to death, depriving the benevolent Happy Times Company of one of their favorite employees. Now that would have gotten you terminated from the company but thanks to your promotion I’m certain we won’t have this problem **ever again.** 



\[Boss Speaker\]

Now little bird, be nice while you’re transported and we’ll treat you with something gourmet. Instead of the feeding tube we have you scheduled for. I hope that you won’t give us trouble, I’d hate to have to…reprimand you personally.

\[Secretary Speaker\]

Yes (Sir, Boss, Miss). Please \[hon\] just let me guide you out the building and you’ll be alright, I’m warning you now you’re going to prefer the gourmet meals over the….other methods they have.

(Spoiler: It’s Not Just Bad Hair Days) 🐱💊,"Let’s be honest—most of us are just trying to keep our cats alive, happy, and out of our coffee cups. But when it comes to feline health, there's one underrated topic that gets way less attention than it should: **vitamin deficiencies**.

No, we’re not talking about your cat needing a green smoothie. We’re talking about real, biological imbalances that can mess with everything from their eyesight to their paws to their, ahem, reproductive situation.

Here’s a quick, no-nonsense breakdown of what happens when your cat doesn’t get enough essential vitamins—and what you can do about it:

# 🥕 Vitamin A Deficiency – The “Why Is My Cat Acting Weird?” Vitamin

**Why it matters:** Vitamin A helps with vision, immune system, skin health, and reproductive function.

**Symptoms:**

* Kittens: stunted growth, wobbly walking, digestion issues, eye problems
* Adults: dull coat, flaky skin, goopy eyes, weight loss, and—yikes—infertility
* Severe cases can lead to **corneal ulcers** or even **blindness**

**Prevention:**  
Stick to nutritionally complete cat food, not just raw chicken and vibes. Check that your food meets AAFCO guidelines—look for **5,000 IU/kg for adults**, **9,000 IU/kg for kittens and pregnant queens**.

# ☀️ Vitamin D Deficiency – The Rickets One

**Why it matters:** Vitamin D is crucial for calcium and phosphorus absorption (aka strong bones, good joints, and not looking like a wobbly noodle).

**Symptoms:**

* Weakness, bowed legs, joint swelling
* Licking floors, walls, or dirt (yes, really)
* Kittens with rickets may develop spinal deformities or even stop walking

**Fix it:**  
More sunlight (safely, of course), balanced food, or in some cases, vet-administered vitamin D injections.

**Reminder:** Don’t DIY with human vitamin D pills—they can be **toxic** to cats if overdosed.

# 🌾 Vitamin E Deficiency – The Silent Threatener

**Why it matters:** It's a powerful antioxidant that protects cells and supports fertility.

**Symptoms:**

* Muscle weakness, especially in the hind legs
* Fatty lumps under the skin
* Fertility issues (empty pregnancies, testicular atrophy)
* In serious cases: seizures, coma, even death

**Prevention:**  
Ensure at least **0.4–0.6 mg of vitamin E per day** depending on size and diet. Most commercial foods have it covered, but if you’re feeding raw or homemade meals—talk to your vet.

# 🧠 Vitamin B Deficiency – Brain Fog, But for Cats

**Why it matters:** B-complex vitamins support nerve function, digestion, energy levels, and skin/coat health.

**Most common deficiency?** **B1 (Thiamine)**

**B1 Deficiency Symptoms:**

* Drooling, vomiting, appetite loss
* Twitching, poor coordination
* Wobbly walking, seizures, “star-gazing” behavior (like they're staring at ghosts 👻)

**Other B Vitamins:**

* **B2:** Mouth ulcers, rough coat
* **B3 (Niacin):** Fatty liver, skin lesions, weight loss
* **B5:** Ulcers, drool, bad breath
* **B6:** Anemia, kidney stones

**Prevention:**  
Feed a complete commercial diet or supplement carefully. If you’re into DIY meals, **you must** work with a feline nutritionist or vet.

# 👩‍⚕️ Final Thoughts – Don’t Play Vet Unless You Are One

We get it—sometimes it’s tempting to treat your cat with something you read in a Facebook group. But if you notice persistent symptoms, especially neurological or visual ones, get your cat to a **real vet**, not a “natural healer” with herbs and a YouTube channel.

And please, for the love of tuna, don’t randomly give your cat human vitamins. Some of them (like vitamin D or iron) can be **dangerously toxic** to felines in human-sized doses.

💡**:** Cats need a balance of vitamins just like we do. Stick to quality food, don't overdo supplements, and get professional help if your cat starts acting like a confused gremlin.",1,1747030828.0,u_MICHUPETUS,0,1.0,False

1kklkws,https://www.reddit.com/r/WomensHealth/comments/1kklkws/diarrhoea_on_period/,Diarrhoea on period?,"I've heard this is normal, but it's never happened to me before so I'm worried! 

Normally I get bad PMS (moody, stomach cramps, sore boobs), period comes, I might have a day where my digestion is a little hurried but nothing alarming. 

This time I had the worst PMS of my life. The Thursday I started to become really emotional and I had some diarrhea. On the Friday I couldn't stop crying, my legs were really sore, I had such intense fatigue and brain fog as well. It was all so bad I couldn't stay at work. That night I got really nauseous. Then I got my period the Saturday evening. On the Sunday (which I'm calling day 1 of my period because it started so late on Saturday) I stupidly had a coffee. All day I was running to the toilet. I had upper stomach cramps and gurgles all day as well, and felt so queasy. I barely ate anything after that all day, I had 2 eggs for lunch and a very small portion of rice, veg and mackerel for dinner. I've woken up today (Monday, Day 2) still with diarrhea, queasiness and gurgles, although so far no cramping so hopefully it stays that way.

Is this normal?? Is this all related to my period? This has never happened to me before but it was the most intense PMS so I feel like it adds up. I'm sorry for being so graphic in this post, I just feel like I'll never feel normal again 😭",1,1747030758.0,WomensHealth,1,1.0,False

I'm just going to ramble.  I expect no responses and I'm treating this as a diary.  A woman asked me out today...for the third time.  She's the type of woman that would get ""uh yes please"" from every guy she asks.  She's gorgeous.  Conventionally gorgeous.  She's definitely my ""type"" due to her half-sleeve and definitely intentionally-built ass.  Who would and who COULD say no?  And yet...the first time was merely a hint.  ""I'm going to a birthday party...but I really don't know anyone there...I wish someone would come with me...""  ""Haha, well I'm sure you have plenty of people would willingly go.  I hope it's fun, see ya later"" #escaperoute.  The second time she said she's going to ""this really cool theatre"" and went on about it.  ""Cool that sounds fun I hope you enjoy it.""  ""Yeah...if you'd ever want to go sometime we should do that..."" ""Yeah I'm sure it's a good time see ya later!""  The third time: ""Hey, long time no see.  I like your haircut!"" (Blatantly blushing) ""Thanks!  How've ya been?"" ""Good good.  I'm so tired though.  I need some relaxing.  What are you doing this weekend?""  ""Oh the usual.  Working and not much else.""  ""Well I could use some company since I don't have any plans at all..."" ""Yeah I'm sure.  Sounds boring but that's the best type of weekend, right? haha."" \*walk away\*.  Dude.  Why do I do that shit.  She's fucking...fantastic.

  
My last relationship was fucked up.  I spent a couple of years with a woman...who I don't even know if I know her real name or not.  The entire two years I though it as ""Alex.  But that's on my Russian birth certificate...on my Turkish one it's Kubra.""  She lied about that.  She's not 1/2 Russian.  She now claims she's Belgian (which she doesn't know I've gleaned from her socials years later).  She had her Masters in Computer Science.  I have some history in programming although self-taught.  I showed her my old Github commits and Gerrit forks...(Code speak for people taking my code and implementing it in other projects)  Despite my being inactive for years...people were still forking my projects to that day (at the time) and I thought that was cool.  I showed her how the framework of my code worked.  Who implemented it.  She seemed...""Oh wow that's awesome"" but completely...ignorant?  Didn't seem to understand what I was showing her?  She worked from home.  At one point she said she had trouble focusing without an office.  I turned our living room into an office for her.  Admittedly, she paid for SOME of it but I bought the majority share.  Upon breaking up I found out she didn't have a job.  Her parents from Turkey were sending her 10K every couple months.  10K...while I made 1/4 that and paid the majority of the bills.  And worried about her entirely because when she met she had left a home where she took care of a woman with dementia...and that woman's son kicked her out one day because he's an alcoholic who didn't like her.  She had nothing.  No belongings, furniture, etc.  So for two years I spent every extra cent I had to buy her new clothes.  New shoes.  New lingerie.  The place she moved into (mine) was furnished...but I made her an office.  She complained about the bathroom lighting.  I furnished her a  new cover for the fixture with pine and hemp that I carved by hand and coffee-stained until she liked it.  I worked literally 65=80 hour weeks.  Never a day off...people say that...but...I worked literally open-to-close as a store manager for 48 days in a row (as my record) and would only ever have one day off.  I was never notified what that day would be.  I would get  a call from my District Manager the night prior ""Cameron is going to work your store tomorrow so you can have the day off..."" and I'd rejoice internally.  Then sometimes I'd get a call that morning ""Cameron can't make it..."" and off to work I'd go.  The company I worked for...sucked.  I finally put in my notice and left after the breakup.  But...it wasn't the catalysts as the lies started before she knew my schedule.  The breaking point was...I knew things were weird.  Always.  She always seemed off and sketchy in so many ways.  Her origin story.  Her prior home story.  Her ""I'm married for a visa and he works nearby so that's why I'm sketchy at your job.""  Etc.  One day I recorded the home audio.  She was telling some dude ""No no no I love you so much I'm sorry I'm just busy...no...you fuck me so good my family will understand...bla bla bla""  I woke her from her sleep once I got home from my 10 hour day of 30 in a row or whatever.  ""Let me see your phone or we're done"" after I finally got to hear the recording.  ""What?""  ""Let me see your phone...or we're fucking done.""  ""What's going on/  What?""  I explain what I heard in the recording.  She explains ""that's an ex...what the fuck...you recorded me?  What the fuck?!"" ""Dude...you've been so sketch for so long I had to know...who the fuck now is he?"" ""He's an Ex.  He's dying.  I don't have the heart to not give him something to hold on to...""  She later gives me his info...tells me showing me her phone is too much and she deserves some privacy...etc etc.  She's being so honest right now...etc etc etc.  I tell her she's not to contact him anymore.  She agrees.  Shows me she blocked him on Instagram now...etc.  A year or mor later...same shit.  She's being sketchy.  I see 3K sent to her on Cash app (where here and I send each other money for groceries or whatever) as she's showing me how much she spent at the store so I could send her money.  I didn't ask nor really note it...until she said ""Oh by the way that's my friend who owes me some money...no big deal.""  I then tried to remember exactly what I saw...because...again...I didn't really note it.  From...Kevin...Carter...No...Kevin?...Huh.""  Core memory.  More sketchy shit.  I record the home again.  She's telling some dude she ""really wants to see him soon...can't wait...maybe we should take a vacation together...where should we go?""  I never told her about this one.  They decided New York.  She took a ""work trip"" to New York shortly after.  After finding everything out.  Some dude she posted a photo of on the back of his motorcycle in Florida during a work trip?  Yeah.  She's ""married"" to him now three years post break up.  The dude who I finally caught her with?  Yeah she ""was taking care of an elderly lady with dementia she she couldn't have visitors since that's her part time job technically.""  Same exact story I got.  He described our home.  And how he wanted to meet our cat (who I got for her because she was ""lonely"") but she slammed the bedroom door (where all of the pictures of her and I are on the wall and bedstand) and said ""she's shy"" and escorted him out as he picked her up.  No job.  The past job was a lie.  Her name was a lie.  She continually tried to convince me to let her bring home dudes ""from the college"" (where I now know she wasn't going) for a threesome.  I eventually agreed to an open relationship.  She refused repletely.  Saying she was only for me but though it was sexy etc.  I agreed it's a sexy concept but...she's mine and I could never see her with someone else.  We did some webcam shit.  She...again...years later...I found out was sending our videos to an ex...another dude she saw a few times on ""work trips.""  All the lies later...I can't.  I can't.  I already spent 8 years alone and refusing to date due to another liar and cheater (I'm 34 so not like I spent my 60s but prime dating age).  Since I was a kid.  Pubescent and prior...I've dreamt of a wife.  Someone I could trust my life to.  Someone I could spend every day with happily.  I'm not that picky.  I've dated less physically attractive woman and loved them just as much due to their personality.  But something about thinking ""Dude....I've nailed it"" multiple times (twice that are notable for my trauma) has fucked me up so far that I won't even take anyone out.  I get not making a pass...I get being a recluse...but I don't understand ""THIS WOMAN ASKED YOU OUT"" and blatantly ignoring it.  I'm so fucked up and I don't think I'll ever get over it this time.  Those 8 years alone.  I swore I'd never date again.  I did.  Even after this most-recent-ex.  I dated a woman for a few months (never officially bf/gf) who was 12 years older than I...but fucking beautiful...lost interest.  Took a woman to coffee a few times...she told me she was bipolar (the straw=that=broke=the-camel's-back-ex said the same) and I told her I wasn't interested after that third outing.  I had another lady in those short few months after who I just took home and fucked and told her I'd call her whenever I wasn't busy.  I eventually felt awful after it was clear that she was developing feelings despite my declaring that none were going to become a thing here...and called it off.  I was so kind (in my opinion) that I asked a woman I've known for 10 years ""What would you say to this"" and showed her response...and she basically ""dude...if someone broke up with me like this...I couldn't even feel sad...that's so fucking nice..."" and the woman's response was basically calling me out for all my red flags..calling me a piece of shit..etc.  Valid, you just got broken up with...I'm sorry.  Point being...when I was FUCKING OVER IT.  Fucked up.  Blatantly hurting.  Asking anyone out who I deemed attractive.  Didn't care.  I had a success rate of 3 out of 4.  The fourth had a boyfriend, she said.  So I learned that confidence gets me there even if the woman was ""out of my league.""  And then...then...I stopped hurting as much from the ex.  The ""fuck it"" attitude dropped.  The ""I just want someone to love"" kicked in...but the ""I can NEVER go through that again"" kicked in at the same time.  And here I am.  Upon being asked out by this woman for the third time...I googled my ex.  Which then made me google her husband (or whatever) which then made me google his username on social media.  Which only showed comments on one profile.  Who was my ex's secret account...linked to her Onlyfans and Webcam site (Clapper).  I was asked out and discovered this a couple weeks ago...and here I sit.  Alone.  Blatantly lonely.  With a cat (who I love dearly) I got for my ex that I told her she couldn't have after the breakup.  And...never wanting to do it again.  Still.  I thought three years would definitely be enough.  But the confrontation of reality said ""nooooooooooooooooooooope.""
