If you are someone who:

\- gets tired of drinking the same brew days on end

\- wants to dive deep into speciality coffee exploring origins, processes

\- wants to try 'fancy' beans without having to buy a whole expensive bag

\- just loves coffee!

then r/BeanDrop might be for you :) I'm someone who is all these things above, and as a non-industry person I found that buying whole bags of coffee was really limiting me exploring all the different coffees out there with the amazing range of roasters we have access to here in Oz (some international roasters planned too!)

Until Thursday I've got a giveaway going for a 200g drop of beans so check it out!

Conversation with Gemini
Create me a welcome post for my new community mistakesToLessons its A place to share small, everyday mistakes—and the lessons they taught us.

Cooking fails, money slips, work errors, tech oops, and life lessons.

Here are a few options for your welcome post, ranging from humorous to inspiring. You can choose the one that best fits the specific vibe of your platform (e.g., Reddit, Discord, Facebook Group, or a newsletter).

Option 1: Warm, Relatable, & Clear (Best for Reddit or Forums)
Title: Welcome to mistakesToLessons: Where ""Oops"" Becomes Growth 🌱

Hello everyone, and welcome!

We’ve all been there. You put salt in your coffee instead of sugar. You accidentally ""Reply All"" to a company-wide email. You buy that gadget you definitely didn't need and definitely couldn't afford.

mistakesToLessons is a judgment-free zone dedicated to those small, everyday fumbles—and, most importantly, the wisdom we gain from them.

What belongs here?

🍳 Cooking Fails: When dinner becomes a charcoal briquette.

💸 Money Slips: Impulse buys and budgeting blunders.

💼 Work Errors: Formatting disasters and email regrets.

💻 Tech Oops: Deleting the wrong file or forgetting to hit save.

🧠 Life Lessons: Any small stumble that made you smarter.

The goal isn’t just to vent (though that’s allowed!), but to share the takeaway. How did you fix it? What will you do differently next time? How can others avoid the same trap?

Get started: Introduce yourself in the comments by sharing a recent ""oops"" moment and the one thing you learned from it. Let’s learn together!

Option 2: Humorous & Punchy (Best for Discord or Social Media)
Title: Perfection is Overrated. Welcome to mistakesToLessons! 👋

Let’s face it: being perfect is boring (and impossible).

Welcome to the community where we celebrate the stumble. Whether you just melted a plastic cutting board on the stove or realized you’ve been singing the wrong lyrics to a song for 10 years, this is your safe space.

The Vibe:

We don't hide our mistakes here; we put them under a microscope and figure out how to be better because of them.

We want to hear about your:

Tech nightmares 🔌

Financial face-palms 💳

Culinary catastrophes 🍝

Workplace woopsies 📉

One Rule: Every mistake must come with a Lesson. Turn that ""L"" into a Lesson!

1pn3wwl,https://www.reddit.com/r/whole30/comments/1pn3wwl/a_year_of_whole30/,A year of whole30,"I completed R3 in October. I loved it. Mostly missed hummus, beans in my chili since I don’t prefer meat, sweetened yogurt that I make a morning smoothie with as a way of delaying major calories, coffee sweetener (just milk in coffee makes it taste salty to me), tofu which my family eats often, edamame in my bowls.

I thought I could handle my sugar dragon but booooy did it come out of the bag.

So I’m starting R4 today and am likely gearing up to keep a journal with a challenge of how many days I’m 2026 I can do whole30!

The psychological aspect is important to me as I am enslaved to the guilt cycle of eating endless Christmas cookies that are brought free daily by patients and coworkers at work, and I’ve decided that the annoyance of meal prep, food boredom, and being limited when eating out, is better than all the alternatives I know right now.

I haven’t psychologically found a way to allow back in beans without my brain starting to study for the bar just to argue with itself what I can and can’t have within the exceptions, damn brain!!",1,1765793658.0,whole30,0,1.0,False

The only time I can go to sleep is when I’m consistently waking up for 5:30 workouts. Ankle surgery a few months ago put exercise on pause. My entire life, my sleep has been poor.

It’s 1:57 am, I feel like a slug since I haven’t broken a sweat since September and spent weeks non weight bearing in my bed. I’m stressed because I can’t sleep, life is stressful just because it’s life. I wish I could call my dad, but he’s been dead for three years now. It was a traumatic accident and extremely public. It sent a shock wave through my life. There’s something about the three year mark that really hit me. Out of my four kids, the oldest two remember him just a little. What a goddamn shame that he didn’t get to know them better.

I was 10 years sober, and when he died I started drinking in earnest again. And now it’s kind of on and off. I’ll easily go weeks without drinking and then hit it hard again, a pattern I know will sound familiar.

Life is complicated no matter what. It’s life!!!! Someone said here the other day something like “I am intentionally building the version of myself I want to see”. I loved that.

And my sleep’s going to suck until I can get back in the gym, and force myself into a better sleep schedule. But in the meantime, I will practice harm reduction and not drink. I will make some extra strong coffee tomorrow morning but I will not be hungover! Taking the win!

My dad, an enthusiastic beer drinker, would probably be a little perplexed by this resolve. I told him before I quit for that decade that I was going to stop and he said with no ill intent, simply curiosity “but why?” So I hope wherever he is, he’s raising his glass to me. I’m gonna cheers to his memory with my coffee and keep pushing forward.

It will help you heal after the fact,"I'm 9½ months out of a almost 10 year marriage.  It was not good for probably 7 of those years increasing every year. There were multiple times when I couldn't make sense of it and would get angry and ask for a divorce. Did I mean it? Idk probably not but it was just so hard to communicate with her.
Back story, I met her after she was approximately 7 months out of a previous marriage that was a 7 year relationship.  She told me, and everyone,  that it was the most abusive 1 sided relationship imaginable.  She was not allowed to do anything out of fear of retaliation and physical abuse.  The stories she told made me happy he was on the other side of the country because I hated what he had done to her. She stalked him from a far while she was with me for the first couple years I know about but i didn't mind. She seemed loyal and loving and the sex was outstanding.  Over time things started to change, she didn't want to go with me anymore doing just everyday stuff and she seemed  unattached... the sex started to become less and less frequent and when I would mention it I was met with how it starts in the morning and basically you earn it throughout the day. This was weird to me since I thought when things get demanding and stressful is when husband and wife should get together if for no other reason than to fuck the attitude out.  This was not the case. The house became less and less tidy and many days i would return home from work to find her still in pajamas and without lifting a finger to contribute to anything.  Dinner was bought out far more often than cooked at home and it actually got to where I didn't even want people over because I was embarrassed from the mess and the isolation she would commit herself to in our bedroom.  I officially had married my roommate.   I continued to hear about her past relationships and the abuse. Abuse seemed to be a pattern.  She had no friends except friends I knew that she would befriend.  This also never seemed to work out.  I started to doubt that she was as abused as she claimed because she started voicing her dislike with me over the craziest shit.  ""You haven't bought me my new SUV, you don't do anything for me, I take care of everything around this house, I have to do the laundry, the cars plates are expired so I'm not doing those errands"" blah blah blah.  Mind you this lady didn't work a single day while we were together,  she was down to making dinner twice a week and usually something I'm not supposed to eat since I'm diabetic, and at times it seemed that she only consumed never contributed.  I did my best to keep her happy. She had the best clothes, she had the newest phones, went on vacation twice a year without me. Her and her mother became the bestest of friends after she married me even though mom lived on the other side of the country.  Another back story, her mom has been living off a man who is a retired doctor.  Has a shit-ton of money and leaves her in charge of most things.  This lady also doesn't work, bitches about everything,  talks to this man like a dog and thinks the world owes her something.  Now I'm finding her coming to my house twice a year to lay around for 10 days and pretend she's the Queen of Sheba. They would usually be gone 5-7 of those days to who knows where...  after probably 5 years of this I started to have enough.  I couldn't get answers from her as to why she was unhappy or why we weren't intimate anymore. What it was that she didn't think she had.  Basically I still had a firm grip and responsibility to provide for my roommate.  During arguments occasionally I would say if she's so unhappy why don't we get a divorce.  She would act crushed and play victim which she became very good at by now and I would feel guilty and try even harder.  
I've worked 50-70 hours a week almost the entire time we were together.  Never did I get recognized for my effort. This again sounds very similar to what she would say about her ex's.  All of them.  She kept stressing the fact that when I would blow up and demand answers I was reminded of how she barely escaped her last relationship with her life.  She was thrown out of the car and beaten and held captive in her house yet here we were and I couldn't pay her to leave the house.  Especially with me.  One thing that was never left behind however was that new phone.  Like an appendage it was.  Always on vibrate never on ring.  Never answered in front of me or if it was it was I'll call you back.  Well naturally I started to question the obvious.  This was met with ridicule and shock that I could question such a thing.  Started to tell anyone who would listen how bad she had it which most could not see any proof of this.  Again, she never had her own car even though I owned no less than 14 cars in the 9+ years we were together. 3 or 4 times she would just drive and drive them like they were indy cars until they broke even though i would remind her that they are used cars you have to check the oil and maintain them. Don't tell me how it broke down but you have been hearing a noise for 3 months.  Common sense right?   
So, by now I started to question how much longer this could go on.  I started talking to female friends I had to get a woman's perspective.  I did love her with everything in me.  I asked for marriage counseling,  she moved out to my mom's on several occasions which made me want her back. She wouldn't be gone 1 day before I was showing up with donuts and coffee and trying to but her back into my heart and my bed. 
These other women whom I had spoken with, 4 of them over 9 years, we're telling me bullshit. She knows what she's doing. Nobody is that dumb, why doesn't she work?  How come your house is always messy especially since you have no kids.  They were all friends of hers as well but loyal to me. Never, not 1 time did anything inappropriate happen between me and them.  She would encourage the relationship actually and on 2 occasions I had to remind these girls that even though I was going without and upset I wasn't going to be unfaithful.  I will admit it was flattering to have someone want me after years of rejection by my wife.  The relationship was so good In the beginning.  I would go back to the beginning everytime I wanted out and questioned how I could restore it. 
Well let's jump to 4 months before she left, by now she couldn't hide the fact she did not like me even a little.  She had that dumb phone surgically implanted on her hand, and was going to the dollar store 3 to 5 times a week.  Usually at the same time.  I knew something was up but she was so good at telling me I was the problem and gaslighting me to no end.  I started to believe that because I was working so many hours usually 7 days a week, that maybe it was true.  I would take time off only to wish for my time off to be over.  There was zero communication or sex or team effort.  She bitched, I went quiet.  That was that.  I was gambling heavy by then because I didn't want to go home. Anything except going home begging for a crumb of affection.  I was late to work on many occasions hoping we would be intimate but it was never to be.  I had stopped asking by then.  But when momma showed up she was a different person.  Always very accommodating to me and told me how she loved me and I'll be back in a week.  The last Christmas we were together she Informed me, not asked me that she was leaving to Florida to see her mom for Christmas.  She said she hadn't spent Christmas with her mom for 5 or 6 years.  This was 4 or 5 days before Christmas.  It wasn't open for discussion.  As soon as she left my partner who i worked with who happened to be female called and asked if I wanted to drive to Arizona with her for a big sale. She had been there 2 weeks earlier and sold out in half a day and made 6k.  Well why the fuck not was my thought.  So we loaded the truck and we went to work. Well 3 days before Christmas turned out to not be the time to knock on someone's door and ask them to spend hundreds if not thousands of dollars with you.  We barely covered expenses.  When she got home she accused me of every wrong thing she could think of.  It was a shit show.  Here I was getting home from a 2 day sale working 15 hours a day and then driving another 12 hours no sleep with hardly anything to show for it and I was getting run through it.  Forget the fact she just got back from her vacation and with this kind of offense she didn't need a defense.  I was unable to ask her anything about her time away.  Less than 3 months later I was involved in a rollover accident going 70 mph.. the driver of our car made a mistake and we slid off the road on black ice and rolled the truck 6 times before coming to a stop against a tree. Lucky to be alive.  Taken to the hospital as a trama 4 level transport.  Unbelievably,  I was not damaged other than superficially.  I would heal.  The next day she tells me she's going back to Florida because her mom needs her help. She had just had surgery on her shoulder.  Wtf ever.  Left me at home without excuses.  The truck btw looked like the occupants would not have survived.  
Now we're going to jump to the end. 1 week before she left things have not improved except for the fact I'm now convinced this is all my fault. I was talking to girls about our problems and thats what made her withdrawal.  This was my fault.  She was no longer friends with them because they didn't take her side.  I wondered why I even wanted it to work out.  Was I that guilt ridden that if it wasn't for talking to others we would not be having problems?  I was a shell of myself.   Now the stories out there sounded exactly the same as i had heard before.  She was being abused, held captive not provided for blah blah blah.  I started seeing the other side of this supposed abusive relationship she fled from. Now I was the abuser. Still, I  wanted it to work. I tried everything  after my mom had told me that she had went to her and said she was thinking about leaving. This pissed me off that she was upsetting my mother who had grown to love her and blame me for our problems.  Remind you she still hasn't worked a day and has all day in the confines of the house on the phone.  The next day I had to go to the dentist for a complete extraction of my teeth.  I had given in to needing dentures so in 1 swoop they were going to pull them all.  She agreed to take me. She asked how long it would be and they said 1 hour. This is what I told her.  When I came out with my jaw swollen and my mouth full of blood running down my shirt she was not there. I called and no answer.  I couldn't talk to leave a message so I walked home. 3 miles.  2 blocks from the house she drives up and apologized.  We went home where she informed me that her dad was picking her and her stuff up that day and she was leaving.  I was crushed but didn't know why.  Everything i had tried didn't work and I wasn't used to putting that much effort into something just to see it fail.  
 So she went to stay with my boss and his wife. For a week and then to her dad's for 2 weeks before leaving to Florida.  During the time she was still local she agreed to meet with me and our dog and even spend the day at the river with us. It went well.  She told me she just needed time to help her mom and that we would probably reunite after some time.  Well naturally I wasn't happy about this but I tried to keep it in check.  A couple days later she goes with her dad to some quick draw competition over the hill in Sacramento and by me calling her twice she went absolutely sideways.  Told me how i was lucky she even spoke to me and that she has things she's doing.  So my reaction was over the top. I had become so upset that I was drinking for the first time in 20 years. Trying to piece things together and always arriving at the same conclusion which was redirected at me and I'm becoming crazy and need therapy.  Of course this set me off more and combined with the booze I'm now prepared to make everyone suffer.  I'm suited and booted and ready to take everyone with me. If this is how it's going to be, by God we will let him sort it out.  Well my boss informed me how she had called the cops and made a report.  I didn't want ton make things worse I let her go without incident.  She took everything she wanted while I was sleeping it off and left what she didn't want.   Which was designer clothes lots and lots of them. 22 pairs of shoes. Everything from Jordan's to high end Polo boots. Some with the price tag still attached.  She left her wedding ring.  The one I bought her when things were tough in the beginning.  Not expensive only $400.  She did take the $12,000 dollar ring that was my grandmother's.  Flawless D color stone.  That one she took.  She also took an expensive, very expensive piece of artwork I hadn't yet had the chance to have appraised.  Told me it was behind another piece of artwork for safe keeping. She just couldn't remember which one. 
Left me to pick up the pieces and figure out what to do. What to get rid of what to keep.  Remember, she's coming back.  
Bullshit..... it was all bullshit.  Month and a half later she wants to sit in via Zoom with my therapist and me.  Basically have a marriage counseling meeting.  I'm so stupid by now I believe she wants to work it out.  Well we start the meeting and I couldn't believe what I was hearing.   The exact same narrative as when I met her.  She barely escaped from this alive. She feared for her life. I gave her nothing.  I spent all the money or I never made any because she didn't see any of it ever.  Blah blah blah... i was embarrassed for her.  Neither my therapist or I could not get a word in.  When my therapist asked the hard questions,  she got rude.  She said well of course you're not going to see it my way.  Again, shit show.  When my therapist asked did she ever see a time when she could get over what she was so upset about,  which was my sharing personal things about our problems  with these few girls,  she responded no she would never get over it.  That's all I needed to hear.  I was done.  I wanted to die.  I actually bought some fentynal that I was going to use to O.D. with.  I was so broken but why?  How could I have put her through the same shit her ex did?  How could I live with myself after this? It was all my fault. 
I told my therapist and she asked me not to take the drug. She was genuinely concerned for me. The first time anyone had listened and helped guide me through this difficult path that lay ahesd. I was so pissed that I had agreed to therapy in the beginning but now it's one of the things that saved my life. That and the dog she left behind.  Didn't look back at the dog either.  The dog still suffers from separation anxiety.   She had replaced the dog within 2 weeks after arriving in Florida and I was replaced before she left. Everything she had accused me of she was doing herself. Everything. She left the cell phone in her name until I stopped paying for it but in the meantime I accessed the records and oh my god was she a busy little bee.  Talking to different men all over the country.  She would have 4am conversations longer than we had spoke in years.   She was seeing the brothers of her girlfriends thst she had before she had to flee Florida to get away from the monster Ex ...  now returning to get rid of the monster me.  It was so sick.  So so sick.  My mom and I almost severed our relationship becsuse she thought it was all my fault.  If only I would have been nicer, if only I would not get so angry if only i hadn't found the matches she kept as souvenirs from the hotel casino she did who the fuck knows what with who the fuck knows who.  I found all the evidence.  She also left her email open on my mom's computer.  Wow what a surprise.  There were no less than 4 different bank accounts in her name crypto accounts in her name.  Receipts that I had been paying for internet security from Macafy anti whatever  and one other.  That shit isn't cheap i found out.  Probably 1500 a year between them.  Been paying for almost 8 years. I read through this shit 1 time. Took no notes and then sent her a email telling her she should probably change her login.  I didn't want to monitor her to catch her doing anything else at this point.  I had seen enough.  I was shocked I could have been such a fool.  But thinking back she had told me what she was all about from the very beginning.  How she had secretly recorded conversations with her ex, how she took her time planning her escape from captivity,  how she would pretend to sleep so she didnt have to fuck him.   If it was DNA it would have come back an exact match.  
10 months post breakup I'm getting better. I love my therapist.  Not love like in love just cherish her that she helped me like I didn't think could happen.  I'm not broken any longer however I am still single because why should I get into another relationship while I'm still trying to fully understand where this one went bad. I've learned more about myself than I had the previous decade and I'm actually kinda optimistic for the future.  I've never failed when put into extreme situations like this and im confident I will not fail this time. I will however be more assertive when it comes to questioning motives or actions.  Trust has taken a back seat to common sense  and animals,  especially the one I have now, are gifts to be loved and cherished. 
Can't wait until the 14th of March 2026.  That will mark our 10 year marriage anniversary.  The day she asked me if I would wait until to file for divorce.  The day she becomes eligible to collect my amount of social security as opposed to her own.  She hardly worked in her life so she asked if  I would allow her to remain married until then.  Just so happens her mother collects the social security of some guy due to the same law.  It's twice as much as she would collect on her own. Her mother is also waiting for a settlement check from a slip and fall so she can leave the doctor that's been supporting her for over a decade.  He recently came out as gay.  Hard to imagine with all the gaslighting and cruel manipulation used in that family.  God only knows how much money she has embezzled from him because as far as I know slip and falls don't pay much. But I could care less if she collects my social security.  She's going to need it.  I'm sad for her.  Sad for me but sad for her.  She's going to have s hard rest of her life.  I dont know what the demand is for a 50 year old unemployed self centered narcissist is but it's probably not very high.

Hello fellow humans (and possibly bots 👀),

I have officially reached that dangerous level of boredom where staring at the wall feels like premium entertainment. So here I am, bravely stepping into the wild lands of Reddit in search of cool, weird, nerdy, or equally bored people to talk to. If you enjoy random conversations that start with absolutely no direction and somehow end up discussing space, memes, life, conspiracy theories, or why coffee tastes better at night — congratulations, you qualify.

You don’t need to be interesting (I’m not either), just curious, sarcastic, or bored enough to pretend we’re cool. If you’re a nerd, overthinker, night owl, or someone procrastinating important life decisions — welcome aboard. Let’s talk nonsense, exchange hot takes no one asked for, and collectively feel productive while doing nothing at all.

1pn3pv9,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_worldsmostunstable/comments/1pn3pv9/you_found_me/,You found me.,"I spend my life waiting for something or other to happen. It's not that I'm fully dissatisfied, more that there's... always *something* I could be doing. Something I could be saying. I should be aiming for more than this.

Two years have passed since I last wrote here, and I feel each year like a brand against my skin. It's left physical scars and big burns over my soul, each line carefully filled in with gold leaf to try and make some meaning out of it all. Everything happens for a reason and if I could find it and understand it then maybe everything that scarred me would feel a little less bleak, and a little more like the stepping stones I needed. 

I met you, but I barely registered it at the time. It was a passing glance that turned into more, one day something I can't consider then the next everything that finally made sense. Being given permission to want you was finally breathing in fresh air after being stuck in the air in a tin can for weeks. 

But the tin can has to come back down to earth. Everything does, eventually. 

There are so many beautiful words that I construct for you, but I'm not a builder, just a poet with a bucket of cement and grand architectural vision. Sometimes I build to code and the structure remains standing, others crumble to dust in the wind as quickly as they emerge from my heart. 

Seeing you again, after so much has passed, so many days of figuring out who you are to me and where I want you to be, was the spiritual equivalent of a gunshot to the head. Someone took me captive whilst I was sleeping and demanded my service with bloody teeth, holding their pistol to my temple and showing me an inkblot test of indeterminate authority. 

*Tell me what you see.*

*Tell me what you feel.*

I don't feel in words. The full-body electric shock isn't able to be contained in mere letters and phrases. But it seems that this is my lot, this is my medium, I crack easily under pressure but my words - even the shakiest - are gilded in some sort of strength. They're stronger than my body, or my mind. 

Maybe if I could construct a world built on the foundations of my words of love for you, it would become an empire to truly stand the test of time. Something to enshrine in stone tablets and scripture beyond the pale, for scholars of future days to ponder upon and make shrewd remarks about at high-stakes conferences. 

It's frustrating, having a spirit at odds with myself. I barely recognise my own shadow because it flickers in the colours of a woman who never learnt shame, or the concept of feeling too much. It's too difficult to contest when the world beats you down and tells you not now, not like that, do something different, \*be\* someone different, be anything or anyone but yourself because you are too much, will always be too much.

We've barely touched, but my skin knows your name and my fingers cry out to be entangled with yours. 

It makes sense.    
Then it doesn't.    
Then it all makes sense again.

But in these two years, if I've learnt anything it's that I always miss the obvious, the thing that was staring me in the face the whole time.

And this time that was you, staring me in the face, in the split second when I glanced in the right place and felt the grip of your gravity shredding my constellations to bits. The feeling on paper is different to the feeling that you get when you look at someone and realise that they're what you've been waiting for this whole time, that you know it, that they know it, and nothing is ever going to feel quite the same again. 

Maybe it's poetic that I'm back here, back to the scene of the crime after so much time, looking back at what I saved from demolition and which pages are forever lost to time. I wonder if you knew me then, if you spotted the patterns in my non-verbal cadence. I've spent longer on these subreddits than I want to admit, writing to lost loves and unrequited loves and finally, you.

What would it mean to actually have you? My friend said that I was disappointed with the reality, but it was never that, it could never be that. I already know the reality, I know what I want (you) and how I wish I could get it. But you plot the course out on tracing paper and find that the contours don't quite line up, and suddenly the world descends into a spiral and every cruel thing everyone has ever said rattles around your mind, screaming at you to give up, that this is a silly fantasy, that the pull could never be on both sides.

Then you wake up.    
You brush your teeth.  
You brew your coffee and check the news.  

Every other thought is of you.  

Every word I write...  

Is of you.

And the unshakable knowledge that I would wait my whole life just to *know* how your body fits against mine.",1,1765792868.0,u_worldsmostunstable,0,1.0,False

When we first met, we both had our own homes. After 1 year of dating she moved in with me. She was going to sell her house at that time, but I convinced her to rent it out. She rented her house for 3 years. 

For the last 5 years I have supported her dreams of getting into school to become a CRNA. 

You can’t work while in the program. The program is expensive. 

We came up with a plan to get her through school with out debt

Her part: travel nurse, rental checks, and save everything. Her house sold for 120k more than she bought it for. 

My part: I paid for everything prior to school starting, and throughout school. 

Repayment was never a touchy subject. We discussed her paying my 40k student loan debt. She was also okay with me taking a less stressful job that pays less and she’d take over bills.

\*Her program completes Dec 2025. She takes boards Jan 2026. She accepted a job starting Feb. 2026 with a salary of 270k. 

Our issue started in Oct 2025- She came home from meeting her friends for coffee, and tells me she is going with them to Japan in Feb 2026.

There was no discussion with me- just that statement.

I expressed how hurt I was and:

1. I had been paying for everything- instead of Japan maybe help me with bills. 

2. why would she not AT LEAST invite me? Her response for not inviting me was “I don’t like to travel.” I corrected her, I like to travel. it’s hard to travel on 1 income, and Im pay for everything

Nov 6 2025- she wakes me up and tells me that she is leaving me. This is 1 hour before I have to be at work. She said she “was not happy”. 

I asked we “not do this” before work. 

That night I got home- she’s gone, and had moved 1 car load of her belongings to her parent’s house including 1 of our 2 cats

She left many items behind, it was clear they were things she didn’t want.  

I Venmo requested a $100 good faith payment signifying that should would pay me a fraction of what she owes me, a total of 30k. 

She stated she could not pay me back until she started working- but did send the 100$.

Dec 11th she had to pick up a package she accidentally had sent to my house. 

It was an awkward encounter so after she left I called her-I asked if she dumped me because of this Japan trip

Silence

I asked if she already bought her ticket. she stated “it was with my credit card points”

I asked how she can afford a trip to Japan without having income- but can’t pay me back until she works? 

She said she had to take out a student loan and she would have a check of 10k soon. At first she says, I’ll send you the 10k- then pay more when her job starts. 

She only sent 5k

Because of me she has minimal debt from school. Avg student loans for CRNA is 150k-300k. she has less than 20k

I accepted the 5k she sent me and now she’s acting like I’ve done her wrong

1pn3p1b,/r/BreakUps/comments/1pn3ggz/if_you_pay_attention_they_will_tell_you/,If you pay attention they will tell you everything you need to know . It will help you heal after the fact.,"I'm 9½ months out of a almost 10 year marriage.  It was not good for probably 7 of those years increasing every year. There were multiple times when I couldn't make sense of it and would get angry and ask for a divorce. Did I mean it? Idk probably not but it was just so hard to communicate with her.
Back story, I met her after she was approximately 7 months out of a previous marriage that was a 7 year relationship.  She told me, and everyone,  that it was the most abusive 1 sided relationship imaginable.  She was not allowed to do anything out of fear of retaliation and physical abuse.  The stories she told made me happy he was on the other side of the country because I hated what he had done to her. She stalked him from a far while she was with me for the first couple years I know about but i didn't mind. She seemed loyal and loving and the sex was outstanding.  Over time things started to change, she didn't want to go with me anymore doing just everyday stuff and she seemed  unattached... the sex started to become less and less frequent and when I would mention it I was met with how it starts in the morning and basically you earn it throughout the day. This was weird to me since I thought when things get demanding and stressful is when husband and wife should get together if for no other reason than to fuck the attitude out.  This was not the case. The house became less and less tidy and many days i would return home from work to find her still in pajamas and without lifting a finger to contribute to anything.  Dinner was bought out far more often than cooked at home and it actually got to where I didn't even want people over because I was embarrassed from the mess and the isolation she would commit herself to in our bedroom.  I officially had married my roommate.   I continued to hear about her past relationships and the abuse. Abuse seemed to be a pattern.  She had no friends except friends I knew that she would befriend.  This also never seemed to work out.  I started to doubt that she was as abused as she claimed because she started voicing her dislike with me over the craziest shit.  ""You haven't bought me my new SUV, you don't do anything for me, I take care of everything around this house, I have to do the laundry, the cars plates are expired so I'm not doing those errands"" blah blah blah.  Mind you this lady didn't work a single day while we were together,  she was down to making dinner twice a week and usually something I'm not supposed to eat since I'm diabetic, and at times it seemed that she only consumed never contributed.  I did my best to keep her happy. She had the best clothes, she had the newest phones, went on vacation twice a year without me. Her and her mother became the bestest of friends after she married me even though mom lived on the other side of the country.  Another back story, her mom has been living off a man who is a retired doctor.  Has a shit-ton of money and leaves her in charge of most things.  This lady also doesn't work, bitches about everything,  talks to this man like a dog and thinks the world owes her something.  Now I'm finding her coming to my house twice a year to lay around for 10 days and pretend she's the Queen of Sheba. They would usually be gone 5-7 of those days to who knows where...  after probably 5 years of this I started to have enough.  I couldn't get answers from her as to why she was unhappy or why we weren't intimate anymore. What it was that she didn't think she had.  Basically I still had a firm grip and responsibility to provide for my roommate.  During arguments occasionally I would say if she's so unhappy why don't we get a divorce.  She would act crushed and play victim which she became very good at by now and I would feel guilty and try even harder.  
I've worked 50-70 hours a week almost the entire time we were together.  Never did I get recognized for my effort. This again sounds very similar to what she would say about her ex's.  All of them.  She kept stressing the fact that when I would blow up and demand answers I was reminded of how she barely escaped her last relationship with her life.  She was thrown out of the car and beaten and held captive in her house yet here we were and I couldn't pay her to leave the house.  Especially with me.  One thing that was never left behind however was that new phone.  Like an appendage it was.  Always on vibrate never on ring.  Never answered in front of me or if it was it was I'll call you back.  Well naturally I started to question the obvious.  This was met with ridicule and shock that I could question such a thing.  Started to tell anyone who would listen how bad she had it which most could not see any proof of this.  Again, she never had her own car even though I owned no less than 14 cars in the 9+ years we were together. 3 or 4 times she would just drive and drive them like they were indy cars until they broke even though i would remind her that they are used cars you have to check the oil and maintain them. Don't tell me how it broke down but you have been hearing a noise for 3 months.  Common sense right?   
So, by now I started to question how much longer this could go on.  I started talking to female friends I had to get a woman's perspective.  I did love her with everything in me.  I asked for marriage counseling,  she moved out to my mom's on several occasions which made me want her back. She wouldn't be gone 1 day before I was showing up with donuts and coffee and trying to but her back into my heart and my bed. 
These other women whom I had spoken with, 4 of them over 9 years, we're telling me bullshit. She knows what she's doing. Nobody is that dumb, why doesn't she work?  How come your house is always messy especially since you have no kids.  They were all friends of hers as well but loyal to me. Never, not 1 time did anything inappropriate happen between me and them.  She would encourage the relationship actually and on 2 occasions I had to remind these girls that even though I was going without and upset I wasn't going to be unfaithful.  I will admit it was flattering to have someone want me after years of rejection by my wife.  The relationship was so good In the beginning.  I would go back to the beginning everytime I wanted out and questioned how I could restore it. 
Well let's jump to 4 months before she left, by now she couldn't hide the fact she did not like me even a little.  She had that dumb phone surgically implanted on her hand, and was going to the dollar store 3 to 5 times a week.  Usually at the same time.  I knew something was up but she was so good at telling me I was the problem and gaslighting me to no end.  I started to believe that because I was working so many hours usually 7 days a week, that maybe it was true.  I would take time off only to wish for my time off to be over.  There was zero communication or sex or team effort.  She bitched, I went quiet.  That was that.  I was gambling heavy by then because I didn't want to go home. Anything except going home begging for a crumb of affection.  I was late to work on many occasions hoping we would be intimate but it was never to be.  I had stopped asking by then.  But when momma showed up she was a different person.  Always very accommodating to me and told me how she loved me and I'll be back in a week.  The last Christmas we were together she Informed me, not asked me that she was leaving to Florida to see her mom for Christmas.  She said she hadn't spent Christmas with her mom for 5 or 6 years.  This was 4 or 5 days before Christmas.  It wasn't open for discussion.  As soon as she left my partner who i worked with who happened to be female called and asked if I wanted to drive to Arizona with her for a big sale. She had been there 2 weeks earlier and sold out in half a day and made 6k.  Well why the fuck not was my thought.  So we loaded the truck and we went to work. Well 3 days before Christmas turned out to not be the time to knock on someone's door and ask them to spend hundreds if not thousands of dollars with you.  We barely covered expenses.  When she got home she accused me of every wrong thing she could think of.  It was a shit show.  Here I was getting home from a 2 day sale working 15 hours a day and then driving another 12 hours no sleep with hardly anything to show for it and I was getting run through it.  Forget the fact she just got back from her vacation and with this kind of offense she didn't need a defense.  I was unable to ask her anything about her time away.  Less than 3 months later I was involved in a rollover accident going 70 mph.. the driver of our car made a mistake and we slid off the road on black ice and rolled the truck 6 times before coming to a stop against a tree. Lucky to be alive.  Taken to the hospital as a trama 4 level transport.  Unbelievably,  I was not damaged other than superficially.  I would heal.  The next day she tells me she's going back to Florida because her mom needs her help. She had just had surgery on her shoulder.  Wtf ever.  Left me at home without excuses.  The truck btw looked like the occupants would not have survived.  
Now we're going to jump to the end. 1 week before she left things have not improved except for the fact I'm now convinced this is all my fault. I was talking to girls about our problems and thats what made her withdrawal.  This was my fault.  She was no longer friends with them because they didn't take her side.  I wondered why I even wanted it to work out.  Was I that guilt ridden that if it wasn't for talking to others we would not be having problems?  I was a shell of myself.   Now the stories out there sounded exactly the same as i had heard before.  She was being abused, held captive not provided for blah blah blah.  I started seeing the other side of this supposed abusive relationship she fled from. Now I was the abuser. Still, I  wanted it to work. I tried everything  after my mom had told me that she had went to her and said she was thinking about leaving. This pissed me off that she was upsetting my mother who had grown to love her and blame me for our problems.  Remind you she still hasn't worked a day and has all day in the confines of the house on the phone.  The next day I had to go to the dentist for a complete extraction of my teeth.  I had given in to needing dentures so in 1 swoop they were going to pull them all.  She agreed to take me. She asked how long it would be and they said 1 hour. This is what I told her.  When I came out with my jaw swollen and my mouth full of blood running down my shirt she was not there. I called and no answer.  I couldn't talk to leave a message so I walked home. 3 miles.  2 blocks from the house she drives up and apologized.  We went home where she informed me that her dad was picking her and her stuff up that day and she was leaving.  I was crushed but didn't know why.  Everything i had tried didn't work and I wasn't used to putting that much effort into something just to see it fail.  
 So she went to stay with my boss and his wife. For a week and then to her dad's for 2 weeks before leaving to Florida.  During the time she was still local she agreed to meet with me and our dog and even spend the day at the river with us. It went well.  She told me she just needed time to help her mom and that we would probably reunite after some time.  Well naturally I wasn't happy about this but I tried to keep it in check.  A couple days later she goes with her dad to some quick draw competition over the hill in Sacramento and by me calling her twice she went absolutely sideways.  Told me how i was lucky she even spoke to me and that she has things she's doing.  So my reaction was over the top. I had become so upset that I was drinking for the first time in 20 years. Trying to piece things together and always arriving at the same conclusion which was redirected at me and I'm becoming crazy and need therapy.  Of course this set me off more and combined with the booze I'm now prepared to make everyone suffer.  I'm suited and booted and ready to take everyone with me. If this is how it's going to be, by God we will let him sort it out.  Well my boss informed me how she had called the cops and made a report.  I didn't want ton make things worse I let her go without incident.  She took everything she wanted while I was sleeping it off and left what she didn't want.   Which was designer clothes lots and lots of them. 22 pairs of shoes. Everything from Jordan's to high end Polo boots. Some with the price tag still attached.  She left her wedding ring.  The one I bought her when things were tough in the beginning.  Not expensive only $400.  She did take the $12,000 dollar ring that was my grandmother's.  Flawless D color stone.  That one she took.  She also took an expensive, very expensive piece of artwork I hadn't yet had the chance to have appraised.  Told me it was behind another piece of artwork for safe keeping. She just couldn't remember which one. 
Left me to pick up the pieces and figure out what to do. What to get rid of what to keep.  Remember, she's coming back.  
Bullshit..... it was all bullshit.  Month and a half later she wants to sit in via Zoom with my therapist and me.  Basically have a marriage counseling meeting.  I'm so stupid by now I believe she wants to work it out.  Well we start the meeting and I couldn't believe what I was hearing.   The exact same narrative as when I met her.  She barely escaped from this alive. She feared for her life. I gave her nothing.  I spent all the money or I never made any because she didn't see any of it ever.  Blah blah blah... i was embarrassed for her.  Neither my therapist or I could not get a word in.  When my therapist asked the hard questions,  she got rude.  She said well of course you're not going to see it my way.  Again, shit show.  When my therapist asked did she ever see a time when she could get over what she was so upset about,  which was my sharing personal things about our problems  with these few girls,  she responded no she would never get over it.  That's all I needed to hear.  I was done.  I wanted to die.  I actually bought some fentynal that I was going to use to O.D. with.  I was so broken but why?  How could I have put her through the same shit her ex did?  How could I live with myself after this? It was all my fault. 
I told my therapist and she asked me not to take the drug. She was genuinely concerned for me. The first time anyone had listened and helped guide me through this difficult path that lay ahesd. I was so pissed that I had agreed to therapy in the beginning but now it's one of the things that saved my life. That and the dog she left behind.  Didn't look back at the dog either.  The dog still suffers from separation anxiety.   She had replaced the dog within 2 weeks after arriving in Florida and I was replaced before she left. Everything she had accused me of she was doing herself. Everything. She left the cell phone in her name until I stopped paying for it but in the meantime I accessed the records and oh my god was she a busy little bee.  Talking to different men all over the country.  She would have 4am conversations longer than we had spoke in years.   She was seeing the brothers of her girlfriends thst she had before she had to flee Florida to get away from the monster Ex ...  now returning to get rid of the monster me.  It was so sick.  So so sick.  My mom and I almost severed our relationship becsuse she thought it was all my fault.  If only I would have been nicer, if only I would not get so angry if only i hadn't found the matches she kept as souvenirs from the hotel casino she did who the fuck knows what with who the fuck knows who.  I found all the evidence.  She also left her email open on my mom's computer.  Wow what a surprise.  There were no less than 4 different bank accounts in her name crypto accounts in her name.  Receipts that I had been paying for internet security from Macafy anti whatever  and one other.  That shit isn't cheap i found out.  Probably 1500 a year between them.  Been paying for almost 8 years. I read through this shit 1 time. Took no notes and then sent her a email telling her she should probably change her login.  I didn't want to monitor her to catch her doing anything else at this point.  I had seen enough.  I was shocked I could have been such a fool.  But thinking back she had told me what she was all about from the very beginning.  How she had secretly recorded conversations with her ex, how she took her time planning her escape from captivity,  how she would pretend to sleep so she didnt have to fuck him.   If it was DNA it would have come back an exact match.  
10 months post breakup I'm getting better. I love my therapist.  Not love like in love just cherish her that she helped me like I didn't think could happen.  I'm not broken any longer however I am still single because why should I get into another relationship while I'm still trying to fully understand where this one went bad. I've learned more about myself than I had the previous decade and I'm actually kinda optimistic for the future.  I've never failed when put into extreme situations like this and im confident I will not fail this time. I will however be more assertive when it comes to questioning motives or actions.  Trust has taken a back seat to common sense  and animals,  especially the one I have now, are gifts to be loved and cherished. 
Can't wait until the 14th of March 2026.  That will mark our 10 year marriage anniversary.  The day she asked me if I would wait until to file for divorce.  The day she becomes eligible to collect my amount of social security as opposed to her own.  She hardly worked in her life so she asked if  I would allow her to remain married until then.  Just so happens her mother collects the social security of some guy due to the same law.  It's twice as much as she would collect on her own. Her mother is also waiting for a settlement check from a slip and fall so she can leave the doctor that's been supporting her for over a decade.  He recently came out as gay.  Hard to imagine with all the gaslighting and cruel manipulation used in that family.  God only knows how much money she has embezzled from him because as far as I know slip and falls don't pay much. But I could care less if she collects my social security.  She's going to need it.  I'm sad for her.  Sad for me but sad for her.  She's going to have s hard rest of her life.  I dont know what the demand is for a 50 year old unemployed self centered narcissist is but it's probably not very high.

It will help you heal after the fact.,"I'm 9½ months out of a almost 10 year marriage.  It was not good for probably 7 of those years increasing every year. There were multiple times when I couldn't make sense of it and would get angry and ask for a divorce. Did I mean it? Idk probably not but it was just so hard to communicate with her.
Back story, I met her after she was approximately 7 months out of a previous marriage that was a 7 year relationship.  She told me, and everyone,  that it was the most abusive 1 sided relationship imaginable.  She was not allowed to do anything out of fear of retaliation and physical abuse.  The stories she told made me happy he was on the other side of the country because I hated what he had done to her. She stalked him from a far while she was with me for the first couple years I know about but i didn't mind. She seemed loyal and loving and the sex was outstanding.  Over time things started to change, she didn't want to go with me anymore doing just everyday stuff and she seemed  unattached... the sex started to become less and less frequent and when I would mention it I was met with how it starts in the morning and basically you earn it throughout the day. This was weird to me since I thought when things get demanding and stressful is when husband and wife should get together if for no other reason than to fuck the attitude out.  This was not the case. The house became less and less tidy and many days i would return home from work to find her still in pajamas and without lifting a finger to contribute to anything.  Dinner was bought out far more often than cooked at home and it actually got to where I didn't even want people over because I was embarrassed from the mess and the isolation she would commit herself to in our bedroom.  I officially had married my roommate.   I continued to hear about her past relationships and the abuse. Abuse seemed to be a pattern.  She had no friends except friends I knew that she would befriend.  This also never seemed to work out.  I started to doubt that she was as abused as she claimed because she started voicing her dislike with me over the craziest shit.  ""You haven't bought me my new SUV, you don't do anything for me, I take care of everything around this house, I have to do the laundry, the cars plates are expired so I'm not doing those errands"" blah blah blah.  Mind you this lady didn't work a single day while we were together,  she was down to making dinner twice a week and usually something I'm not supposed to eat since I'm diabetic, and at times it seemed that she only consumed never contributed.  I did my best to keep her happy. She had the best clothes, she had the newest phones, went on vacation twice a year without me. Her and her mother became the bestest of friends after she married me even though mom lived on the other side of the country.  Another back story, her mom has been living off a man who is a retired doctor.  Has a shit-ton of money and leaves her in charge of most things.  This lady also doesn't work, bitches about everything,  talks to this man like a dog and thinks the world owes her something.  Now I'm finding her coming to my house twice a year to lay around for 10 days and pretend she's the Queen of Sheba. They would usually be gone 5-7 of those days to who knows where...  after probably 5 years of this I started to have enough.  I couldn't get answers from her as to why she was unhappy or why we weren't intimate anymore. What it was that she didn't think she had.  Basically I still had a firm grip and responsibility to provide for my roommate.  During arguments occasionally I would say if she's so unhappy why don't we get a divorce.  She would act crushed and play victim which she became very good at by now and I would feel guilty and try even harder.  
I've worked 50-70 hours a week almost the entire time we were together.  Never did I get recognized for my effort. This again sounds very similar to what she would say about her ex's.  All of them.  She kept stressing the fact that when I would blow up and demand answers I was reminded of how she barely escaped her last relationship with her life.  She was thrown out of the car and beaten and held captive in her house yet here we were and I couldn't pay her to leave the house.  Especially with me.  One thing that was never left behind however was that new phone.  Like an appendage it was.  Always on vibrate never on ring.  Never answered in front of me or if it was it was I'll call you back.  Well naturally I started to question the obvious.  This was met with ridicule and shock that I could question such a thing.  Started to tell anyone who would listen how bad she had it which most could not see any proof of this.  Again, she never had her own car even though I owned no less than 14 cars in the 9+ years we were together. 3 or 4 times she would just drive and drive them like they were indy cars until they broke even though i would remind her that they are used cars you have to check the oil and maintain them. Don't tell me how it broke down but you have been hearing a noise for 3 months.  Common sense right?   
So, by now I started to question how much longer this could go on.  I started talking to female friends I had to get a woman's perspective.  I did love her with everything in me.  I asked for marriage counseling,  she moved out to my mom's on several occasions which made me want her back. She wouldn't be gone 1 day before I was showing up with donuts and coffee and trying to but her back into my heart and my bed. 
These other women whom I had spoken with, 4 of them over 9 years, we're telling me bullshit. She knows what she's doing. Nobody is that dumb, why doesn't she work?  How come your house is always messy especially since you have no kids.  They were all friends of hers as well but loyal to me. Never, not 1 time did anything inappropriate happen between me and them.  She would encourage the relationship actually and on 2 occasions I had to remind these girls that even though I was going without and upset I wasn't going to be unfaithful.  I will admit it was flattering to have someone want me after years of rejection by my wife.  The relationship was so good In the beginning.  I would go back to the beginning everytime I wanted out and questioned how I could restore it. 
Well let's jump to 4 months before she left, by now she couldn't hide the fact she did not like me even a little.  She had that dumb phone surgically implanted on her hand, and was going to the dollar store 3 to 5 times a week.  Usually at the same time.  I knew something was up but she was so good at telling me I was the problem and gaslighting me to no end.  I started to believe that because I was working so many hours usually 7 days a week, that maybe it was true.  I would take time off only to wish for my time off to be over.  There was zero communication or sex or team effort.  She bitched, I went quiet.  That was that.  I was gambling heavy by then because I didn't want to go home. Anything except going home begging for a crumb of affection.  I was late to work on many occasions hoping we would be intimate but it was never to be.  I had stopped asking by then.  But when momma showed up she was a different person.  Always very accommodating to me and told me how she loved me and I'll be back in a week.  The last Christmas we were together she Informed me, not asked me that she was leaving to Florida to see her mom for Christmas.  She said she hadn't spent Christmas with her mom for 5 or 6 years.  This was 4 or 5 days before Christmas.  It wasn't open for discussion.  As soon as she left my partner who i worked with who happened to be female called and asked if I wanted to drive to Arizona with her for a big sale. She had been there 2 weeks earlier and sold out in half a day and made 6k.  Well why the fuck not was my thought.  So we loaded the truck and we went to work. Well 3 days before Christmas turned out to not be the time to knock on someone's door and ask them to spend hundreds if not thousands of dollars with you.  We barely covered expenses.  When she got home she accused me of every wrong thing she could think of.  It was a shit show.  Here I was getting home from a 2 day sale working 15 hours a day and then driving another 12 hours no sleep with hardly anything to show for it and I was getting run through it.  Forget the fact she just got back from her vacation and with this kind of offense she didn't need a defense.  I was unable to ask her anything about her time away.  Less than 3 months later I was involved in a rollover accident going 70 mph.. the driver of our car made a mistake and we slid off the road on black ice and rolled the truck 6 times before coming to a stop against a tree. Lucky to be alive.  Taken to the hospital as a trama 4 level transport.  Unbelievably,  I was not damaged other than superficially.  I would heal.  The next day she tells me she's going back to Florida because her mom needs her help. She had just had surgery on her shoulder.  Wtf ever.  Left me at home without excuses.  The truck btw looked like the occupants would not have survived.  
Now we're going to jump to the end. 1 week before she left things have not improved except for the fact I'm now convinced this is all my fault. I was talking to girls about our problems and thats what made her withdrawal.  This was my fault.  She was no longer friends with them because they didn't take her side.  I wondered why I even wanted it to work out.  Was I that guilt ridden that if it wasn't for talking to others we would not be having problems?  I was a shell of myself.   Now the stories out there sounded exactly the same as i had heard before.  She was being abused, held captive not provided for blah blah blah.  I started seeing the other side of this supposed abusive relationship she fled from. Now I was the abuser. Still, I  wanted it to work. I tried everything  after my mom had told me that she had went to her and said she was thinking about leaving. This pissed me off that she was upsetting my mother who had grown to love her and blame me for our problems.  Remind you she still hasn't worked a day and has all day in the confines of the house on the phone.  The next day I had to go to the dentist for a complete extraction of my teeth.  I had given in to needing dentures so in 1 swoop they were going to pull them all.  She agreed to take me. She asked how long it would be and they said 1 hour. This is what I told her.  When I came out with my jaw swollen and my mouth full of blood running down my shirt she was not there. I called and no answer.  I couldn't talk to leave a message so I walked home. 3 miles.  2 blocks from the house she drives up and apologized.  We went home where she informed me that her dad was picking her and her stuff up that day and she was leaving.  I was crushed but didn't know why.  Everything i had tried didn't work and I wasn't used to putting that much effort into something just to see it fail.  
 So she went to stay with my boss and his wife. For a week and then to her dad's for 2 weeks before leaving to Florida.  During the time she was still local she agreed to meet with me and our dog and even spend the day at the river with us. It went well.  She told me she just needed time to help her mom and that we would probably reunite after some time.  Well naturally I wasn't happy about this but I tried to keep it in check.  A couple days later she goes with her dad to some quick draw competition over the hill in Sacramento and by me calling her twice she went absolutely sideways.  Told me how i was lucky she even spoke to me and that she has things she's doing.  So my reaction was over the top. I had become so upset that I was drinking for the first time in 20 years. Trying to piece things together and always arriving at the same conclusion which was redirected at me and I'm becoming crazy and need therapy.  Of course this set me off more and combined with the booze I'm now prepared to make everyone suffer.  I'm suited and booted and ready to take everyone with me. If this is how it's going to be, by God we will let him sort it out.  Well my boss informed me how she had called the cops and made a report.  I didn't want ton make things worse I let her go without incident.  She took everything she wanted while I was sleeping it off and left what she didn't want.   Which was designer clothes lots and lots of them. 22 pairs of shoes. Everything from Jordan's to high end Polo boots. Some with the price tag still attached.  She left her wedding ring.  The one I bought her when things were tough in the beginning.  Not expensive only $400.  She did take the $12,000 dollar ring that was my grandmother's.  Flawless D color stone.  That one she took.  She also took an expensive, very expensive piece of artwork I hadn't yet had the chance to have appraised.  Told me it was behind another piece of artwork for safe keeping. She just couldn't remember which one. 
Left me to pick up the pieces and figure out what to do. What to get rid of what to keep.  Remember, she's coming back.

1pn3m3n,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1pn3m3n/tired/,Tired:(,"Hey girlies, I’ve been really struggling as of late. Can I rant? 

I just got diagnosed at 26 with a combined ADHD. A few years ago I got long covid, had a bad breakup, was overall unhappy with my life in a foreign country etc etc brain fog depression Prozac pipeline. It helped a lot. But I couldn’t focus. I was tired. I quit it. 

Then I moved countries again (another foreign country). Living with the love of my life, have a supportive community, an academically challenging but invigorating degree, good future prospects.

But the executive function/anxiety/fear of failure have gotten so bad that I couldn’t cope. I wasn’t depressed anymore, wasn’t on Prozac, but I still couldn’t focus, was always tired. 

My partner got diagnosed with ADHD that we always suspected he had. He started immediate release Ritalin and it has been helping. Then we started questioning… what if I also had it? Surprise. A few months and few hundred euros later…a diagnosis! A prescription for Ritalin. The country where I am right now only has methylphenidate. No Strattera, no amphetamine based meds. Tried Wellbutrin years ago to fight off Prozac fatigue and it really did not sit well with me.  

I’m an international student, ER meds are more expensive. But I tried 10mg of ER methylphenidate (Medikinet), then 20. Nothing but sleepiness and anxiety in patches. Then I went on IR Ritalin. 10mg for 10 days, then 10 twice a day at least 4hrs apart, then thrice. Horrible side effects. Bad anxiety. Spirals. Appetite suppression, jitters, air hunger. Whether I took it with food or without it, a lot of protein or not at all. didn’t matter. Eventually after a couple of months of persevering the side effects mostly went away. Now the problem is mostly the appetite suppression. But I am not sure there were ever benefits? I feel something but I’m not sure what it is. I am on 40mg of Ritalin IR which I take 4 times a day about 2.5-3 hrs apart. (Immediate release is way cheaper) Psychiatrists here have the idea that the max dose can’t be more than 1mg/1kg. I am petite, so 40 is my max I’ll get here. My psych also seems very cautious of letting me tailor the dosing/timing. So I don’t even know whether 15-20mg doses would work better. And I’m scared of side effects. I have no past addictions, nothing. Just good ol’ prejudice even though she specialises in ADHD in adults. 

I am writing my Master’s thesis. I like the topic, have an extremely supportive and helpful supervisor, but I am behind, despite starting early. The anxiety and emotional dysregulation got so bad that I decided to go back on Prozac (I think I also probably have Pmdd as I’ve struggled with that for a long time and I have an IUD which made my periods light but they’re still there and very irregular so I can’t track well. I’ve tried.) 

Now that I’m in my first week of Prozac+Ritalin I am jittery again, but I am also fatigued. Halfway through the day I crash and need a nap. I don’t drink coffee. I used to have one cup in the morning as more made me jittery, but I quit once I started meds. 

Before starting meds I got tests done: ECG, EEG, blood test. B12, ferritin, iron are all fine! Vit D deficient, been taking D3+K2 supplements, magnesium glycinate. I sleep fine, I don’t snore, don’t wake up all that much? My blood pressure is on the lower side of the healthy spectrum, my cholesterol is high (probably a family issue, as my diet is fine, so I’ll try and get that dealt with in a couple months). Doc said my thyroid seems fine (TSH - 3, FT3 - 3,  FT4 - 9,8) 

I have an ADHD diagnosis but what if the doctors were wrong? I don’t remember what I was like as a child. Mother says I was well-behaved (unreliable). I looked through some chats I had with a friend when I was 15-16. More energy, did things all the time, but always asked that friend what homework we had, which classroom we were in etc. Listened to music, read books in class. Skipped. Stayed up all night watching tv shows. Though it seemed to me that everyone was like that. 

But I’m so tired now. No energy to do anything. I mostly do what I need to do, but I get distracted, it takes more energy.

For people who made the switch, did it genuinely improve your daily coffee or did the novelty wear off? Curious if it is actually worth the setup for someone who just wants a better cup without going full coffee nerd.",1,1765792316.0,ProductQuery,0,1.0,False

A little about me:

I'm pretty open-minded and enjoy chatting about almost anything—life, movies, food (I'm a huge foodie!), hobbies, or just the day-to-day stuff.

I'm a working professional with a medium build, salt-and-pepper look.
Culturally and religiously, I come from a background where being open about my sexuality isn’t always easy, so I’m on the down low at the moment. But if you're cool with that and open to building a connection, I’m definitely happy to be more open with the right person.

’m looking for someone I can chat with regularly, maybe even meet up for coffee or hang out if things click.

So, if you’re bi, gay, or just looking for someone to talk to and see where it goes, feel free to reach out! Let’s have some fun conversations and see where things lead.

Like many people here, I used to look for activities, meet-ups, and game nights around Thane—but there was hardly anything happening.

So I decided to build a Thane-specific platform where we can come together for things like art workshops, music nights, fun game meet-ups, and more.

As a small first step, I’ve organised a Christmas-special Clay Art Mural workshop at Starbucks, Viviana Mall, at 11 AM on 20th & 21st December. I am really hoping the Thane Community supports me.

If this sounds like something you’d enjoy, I’d genuinely love for you to join. Expect good coffee, a chance to explore the artist in you, and some warm, fun company.

You can come alone to try something creative, bring your date along or your friends for a fun time. 

You can message me directly for a discount also.

Looking forward to meeting and chilling with some of you 😊

First things first, I have to give some credit to all the users [here](https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/268672/solo-variant) for giving their amazing ideas for a solo variant as you probably know that Sky Team has no official solo variant. The version that best worked for me is the one Matteo Bianchi is highlighting, adding it in case someone wants to try it:

\---------------------------------------

In rounds where the Pilot goes first:  
\- Roll all 4 Pilot dice: Place 1 die.  
\- Roll 2 Co-Pilot dice: Place 1 die and keep the other.  
\- Place another Pilot die.  
\- Roll another Co-Pilot die and put it near the Co-Pilot die you kept earlier: Choose 1 die from these and place it. Keep the other.  
\- Repeat the previous two steps.  
\- Place the last Pilot die.  
\- Place the last Co-Pilot die without rolling it (unless you spend a reroll token).

In rounds where the Co-Pilot goes first, do as above, but start with the Co-Pilot dice.

\---------------------------------------

As for the gameplay experience, well, it was not that easy I was expecting it to be. I have played more than ten sessions of Sky Team, maybe even more than twenty, most of them with my daughter and a few with friends, and I have tried various airports, so I would consider myself an expert player. Starting with Montreal (YUL) and landing safely without the use of a single coffee or a reroll token made me believe even more that this was an easy ride.

Second came Heathrow (LHR), again landing safely without any use of coffee or rerolls, but with small signs of tiredness showing me that this might be tricky the further I was going. And indeed, playing Haneda (HND) seemed from the very beginning that I was not going to make it. A few hard rolls, lack of clarity in my choices due to being a bit brain-fried and the difficulty of the airport itself made me fail in my last round. Just for a second, I though to try again, but I didn’t, I doubt I could make it successfully.

Overall, it was a great afternoon quest, definitely gonna try it again when a have the chance. Has anyone tried something similar?",5,1765791944.0,soloboardgaming,0,1.0,False
1pn3grg,https://www.reddit.com/r/UKParenting/comments/1pn3grg/christmas_over_spending/,Christmas over spending?,"Hi all, 

I'm curious what people spend on their children for Christmas? 

I keep a spreadsheet for Christmas to help me plan/budget (I am chronically ill so need it!) 

But by the time I am actually done with Christmas shopping I always wonder if I've spent too much! I was talking to a friend and she only spends £100 per child. I have definitely gone over that. 

I have 3 children, M 18 (In full time education) and twins F 16 (still in school) 

We still do a Christmas eve box, this became a thing when they were very young from the elf (Handmade, not the creepy one) and they still love it so we continued- This is probably £100 this year. 

This is usually new Christmas PJs, new tooth brush, treats for Xmas eve. Stuff for smores (we have an open fire) and stuff for a hot choc/Christmas coffee station and a board game or something else we can do as a family. 

Christmas eve is a big thing for us as a family and has always been. No visitors, just us in our Pjs, we watch Christmas movies, get a takeaway. Have the fire going and make smores and hot chocolate and play games. (I actually love this more than Christmas day) 

They have their stockings on Christmas morning, this is from Santa ( He's not getting all the credit) - This is not expensive stuff, but has still ended up being about £50 a child this year. 

And then they have main presents under the tree. - Around £700 combined this year. 

I also want to add that we don't have much family so the gifts from us are the only big gifts they will get, no grandparents etc that are big spenders, they usually get Christmas chocolates and smellies as something to open. 

And they also don't get loads from us throughout the year other than birthdays. We don't do regular pocket money etc. 18 y/o has a part time job. If 16 y/o's want spending money they do jobs for us to earn it. 

(Clothes, toiletries and other essentials are bought for them when needed) 

Is this too much? Do others spend more/less? 

\- TLDR- Is £800-£1000 too much to be spending on 3 teenage children at Christmas (including Xmas eve box, stockings and main presents) ",2,1765791822.0,UKParenting,12,1.0,False

                                                                                       I'm 9½ months out of a almost 10 year marriage.  It was not good for probably 7 of those years increasing every year. There were multiple times when I couldn't make sense of it and would get angry and ask for a divorce. Did I mean it? Idk probably not but it was just so hard to communicate with her.
Back story, I met her after she was approximately 7 months out of a previous marriage that was a 7 year relationship.  She told me, and everyone,  that it was the most abusive 1 sided relationship imaginable.  She was not allowed to do anything out of fear of retaliation and physical abuse.  The stories she told made me happy he was on the other side of the country because I hated what he had done to her. She stalked him from a far while she was with me for the first couple years I know about but i didn't mind. She seemed loyal and loving and the sex was outstanding.  Over time things started to change, she didn't want to go with me anymore doing just everyday stuff and she seemed  unattached... the sex started to become less and less frequent and when I would mention it I was met with how it starts in the morning and basically you earn it throughout the day. This was weird to me since I thought when things get demanding and stressful is when husband and wife should get together if for no other reason than to fuck the attitude out.  This was not the case. The house became less and less tidy and many days i would return home from work to find her still in pajamas and without lifting a finger to contribute to anything.  Dinner was bought out far more often than cooked at home and it actually got to where I didn't even want people over because I was embarrassed from the mess and the isolation she would commit herself to in our bedroom.  I officially had married my roommate.   I continued to hear about her past relationships and the abuse. Abuse seemed to be a pattern.  She had no friends except friends I knew that she would befriend.  This also never seemed to work out.  I started to doubt that she was as abused as she claimed because she started voicing her dislike with me over the craziest shit.  ""You haven't bought me my new SUV, you don't do anything for me, I take care of everything around this house, I have to do the laundry, the cars plates are expired so I'm not doing those errands"" blah blah blah.  Mind you this lady didn't work a single day while we were together,  she was down to making dinner twice a week and usually something I'm not supposed to eat since I'm diabetic, and at times it seemed that she only consumed never contributed.  I did my best to keep her happy. She had the best clothes, she had the newest phones, went on vacation twice a year without me. Her and her mother became the bestest of friends after she married me even though mom lived on the other side of the country.  Another back story, her mom has been living off a man who is a retired doctor.  Has a shit-ton of money and leaves her in charge of most things.  This lady also doesn't work, bitches about everything,  talks to this man like a dog and thinks the world owes her something.  Now I'm finding her coming to my house twice a year to lay around for 10 days and pretend she's the Queen of Sheba. They would usually be gone 5-7 of those days to who knows where...  after probably 5 years of this I started to have enough.  I couldn't get answers from her as to why she was unhappy or why we weren't intimate anymore. What it was that she didn't think she had.  Basically I still had a firm grip and responsibility to provide for my roommate.  During arguments occasionally I would say if she's so unhappy why don't we get a divorce.  She would act crushed and play victim which she became very good at by now and I would feel guilty and try even harder.  
I've worked 50-70 hours a week almost the entire time we were together.  Never did I get recognized for my effort. This again sounds very similar to what she would say about her ex's.  All of them.  She kept stressing the fact that when I would blow up and demand answers I was reminded of how she barely escaped her last relationship with her life.  She was thrown out of the car and beaten and held captive in her house yet here we were and I couldn't pay her to leave the house.  Especially with me.  One thing that was never left behind however was that new phone.  Like an appendage it was.  Always on vibrate never on ring.  Never answered in front of me or if it was it was I'll call you back.  Well naturally I started to question the obvious.  This was met with ridicule and shock that I could question such a thing.  Started to tell anyone who would listen how bad she had it which most could not see any proof of this.  Again, she never had her own car even though I owned no less than 14 cars in the 9+ years we were together. 3 or 4 times she would just drive and drive them like they were indy cars until they broke even though i would remind her that they are used cars you have to check the oil and maintain them. Don't tell me how it broke down but you have been hearing a noise for 3 months.  Common sense right?   
So, by now I started to question how much longer this could go on.  I started talking to female friends I had to get a woman's perspective.  I did love her with everything in me.  I asked for marriage counseling,  she moved out to my mom's on several occasions which made me want her back. She wouldn't be gone 1 day before I was showing up with donuts and coffee and trying to but her back into my heart and my bed. 
These other women whom I had spoken with, 4 of them over 9 years, we're telling me bullshit. She knows what she's doing. Nobody is that dumb, why doesn't she work?  How come your house is always messy especially since you have no kids.  They were all friends of hers as well but loyal to me. Never, not 1 time did anything inappropriate happen between me and them.  She would encourage the relationship actually and on 2 occasions I had to remind these girls that even though I was going without and upset I wasn't going to be unfaithful.  I will admit it was flattering to have someone want me after years of rejection by my wife.  The relationship was so good In the beginning.  I would go back to the beginning everytime I wanted out and questioned how I could restore it. 
Well let's jump to 4 months before she left, by now she couldn't hide the fact she did not like me even a little.  She had that dumb phone surgically implanted on her hand, and was going to the dollar store 3 to 5 times a week.  Usually at the same time.  I knew something was up but she was so good at telling me I was the problem and gaslighting me to no end.  I started to believe that because I was working so many hours usually 7 days a week, that maybe it was true.  I would take time off only to wish for my time off to be over.  There was zero communication or sex or team effort.  She bitched, I went quiet.  That was that.  I was gambling heavy by then because I didn't want to go home. Anything except going home begging for a crumb of affection.  I was late to work on many occasions hoping we would be intimate but it was never to be.  I had stopped asking by then.  But when momma showed up she was a different person.  Always very accommodating to me and told me how she loved me and I'll be back in a week.  The last Christmas we were together she Informed me, not asked me that she was leaving to Florida to see her mom for Christmas.  She said she hadn't spent Christmas with her mom for 5 or 6 years.  This was 4 or 5 days before Christmas.  It wasn't open for discussion.  As soon as she left my partner who i worked with who happened to be female called and asked if I wanted to drive to Arizona with her for a big sale. She had been there 2 weeks earlier and sold out in half a day and made 6k.  Well why the fuck not was my thought.  So we loaded the truck and we went to work. Well 3 days before Christmas turned out to not be the time to knock on someone's door and ask them to spend hundreds if not thousands of dollars with you.  We barely covered expenses.  When she got home she accused me of every wrong thing she could think of.  It was a shit show.  Here I was getting home from a 2 day sale working 15 hours a day and then driving another 12 hours no sleep with hardly anything to show for it and I was getting run through it.  Forget the fact she just got back from her vacation and with this kind of offense she didn't need a defense.  I was unable to ask her anything about her time away.  Less than 3 months later I was involved in a rollover accident going 70 mph.. the driver of our car made a mistake and we slid off the road on black ice and rolled the truck 6 times before coming to a stop against a tree. Lucky to be alive.  Taken to the hospital as a trama 4 level transport.  Unbelievably,  I was not damaged other than superficially.  I would heal.  The next day she tells me she's going back to Florida because her mom needs her help. She had just had surgery on her shoulder.  Wtf ever.  Left me at home without excuses.  The truck btw looked like the occupants would not have survived.  
Now we're going to jump to the end. 1 week before she left things have not improved except for the fact I'm now convinced this is all my fault. I was talking to girls about our problems and thats what made her withdrawal.  This was my fault.  She was no longer friends with them because they didn't take her side.  I wondered why I even wanted it to work out.  Was I that guilt ridden that if it wasn't for talking to others we would not be having problems?  I was a shell of myself.   Now the stories out there sounded exactly the same as i had heard before.  She was being abused, held captive not provided for blah blah blah.  I started seeing the other side of this supposed abusive relationship she fled from. Now I was the abuser. Still, I  wanted it to work. I tried everything  after my mom had told me that she had went to her and said she was thinking about leaving. This pissed me off that she was upsetting my mother who had grown to love her and blame me for our problems.  Remind you she still hasn't worked a day and has all day in the confines of the house on the phone.  The next day I had to go to the dentist for a complete extraction of my teeth.  I had given in to needing dentures so in 1 swoop they were going to pull them all.  She agreed to take me. She asked how long it would be and they said 1 hour. This is what I told her.  When I came out with my jaw swollen and my mouth full of blood running down my shirt she was not there. I called and no answer.  I couldn't talk to leave a message so I walked home. 3 miles.  2 blocks from the house she drives up and apologized.  We went home where she informed me that her dad was picking her and her stuff up that day and she was leaving.  I was crushed but didn't know why.  Everything i had tried didn't work and I wasn't used to putting that much effort into something just to see it fail.  
 So she went to stay with my boss and his wife. For a week and then to her dad's for 2 weeks before leaving to Florida.  During the time she was still local she agreed to meet with me and our dog and even spend the day at the river with us. It went well.  She told me she just needed time to help her mom and that we would probably reunite after some time.  Well naturally I wasn't happy about this but I tried to keep it in check.  A couple days later she goes with her dad to some quick draw competition over the hill in Sacramento and by me calling her twice she went absolutely sideways.  Told me how i was lucky she even spoke to me and that she has things she's doing.  So my reaction was over the top. I had become so upset that I was drinking for the first time in 20 years. Trying to piece things together and always arriving at the same conclusion which was redirected at me and I'm becoming crazy and need therapy.  Of course this set me off more and combined with the booze I'm now prepared to make everyone suffer.  I'm suited and booted and ready to take everyone with me. If this is how it's going to be, by God we will let him sort it out.  Well my boss informed me how she had called the cops and made a report.  I didn't want ton make things worse I let her go without incident.  She took everything she wanted while I was sleeping it off and left what she didn't want.   Which was designer clothes lots and lots of them. 22 pairs of shoes. Everything from Jordan's to high end Polo boots. Some with the price tag still attached.  She left her wedding ring.  The one I bought her when things were tough in the beginning.  Not expensive only $400.  She did take the $12,000 dollar ring that was my grandmother's.  Flawless D color stone.  That one she took.  She also took an expensive, very expensive piece of artwork I hadn't yet had the chance to have appraised.  Told me it was behind another piece of artwork for safe keeping. She just couldn't remember which one. 
Left me to pick up the pieces and figure out what to do. What to get rid of what to keep.  Remember, she's coming back.  
Bullshit..... it was all bullshit.  Month and a half later she wants to sit in via Zoom with my therapist and me.  Basically have a marriage counseling meeting.  I'm so stupid by now I believe she wants to work it out.  Well we start the meeting and I couldn't believe what I was hearing.   The exact same narrative as when I met her.  She barely escaped from this alive. She feared for her life. I gave her nothing.  I spent all the money or I never made any because she didn't see any of it ever.  Blah blah blah... i was embarrassed for her.  Neither my therapist or I could not get a word in.  When my therapist asked the hard questions,  she got rude.  She said well of course you're not going to see it my way.  Again, shit show.  When my therapist asked did she ever see a time when she could get over what she was so upset about,  which was my sharing personal things about our problems  with these few girls,  she responded no she would never get over it.  That's all I needed to hear.  I was done.  I wanted to die.  I actually bought some fentynal that I was going to use to O.D. with.  I was so broken but why?  How could I have put her through the same shit her ex did?  How could I live with myself after this? It was all my fault. 
I told my therapist and she asked me not to take the drug. She was genuinely concerned for me. The first time anyone had listened and helped guide me through this difficult path that lay ahesd. I was so pissed that I had agreed to therapy in the beginning but now it's one of the things that saved my life. That and the dog she left behind.  Didn't look back at the dog either.  The dog still suffers from separation anxiety.   She had replaced the dog within 2 weeks after arriving in Florida and I was replaced before she left. Everything she had accused me of she was doing herself. Everything. She left the cell phone in her name until I stopped paying for it but in the meantime I accessed the records and oh my god was she a busy little bee.  Talking to different men all over the country.  She would have 4am conversations longer than we had spoke in years.   She was seeing the brothers of her girlfriends thst she had before she had to flee Florida to get away from the monster Ex ...  now returning to get rid of the monster me.  It was so sick.  So so sick.  My mom and I almost severed our relationship becsuse she thought it was all my fault.  If only I would have been nicer, if only I would not get so angry if only i hadn't found the matches she kept as souvenirs from the hotel casino she did who the fuck knows what with who the fuck knows who.  I found all the evidence.  She also left her email open on my mom's computer.  Wow what a surprise.  There were no less than 4 different bank accounts in her name crypto accounts in her name.  Receipts that I had been paying for internet security from Macafy anti whatever  and one other.  That shit isn't cheap i found out.  Probably 1500 a year between them.  Been paying for almost 8 years. I read through this shit 1 time. Took no notes and then sent her a email telling her she should probably change her login.  I didn't want to monitor her to catch her doing anything else at this point.  I had seen enough.  I was shocked I could have been such a fool.  But thinking back she had told me what she was all about from the very beginning.  How she had secretly recorded conversations with her ex, how she took her time planning her escape from captivity,  how she would pretend to sleep so she didnt have to fuck him.   If it was DNA it would have come back an exact match.  
10 months post breakup I'm getting better. I love my therapist.  Not love like in love just cherish her that she helped me like I didn't think could happen.  I'm not broken any longer however I am still single because why should I get into another relationship while I'm still trying to fully understand where this one went bad. I've learned more about myself than I had the previous decade and I'm actually kinda optimistic for the future.  I've never failed when put into extreme situations like this and im confident I will not fail this time. I will however be more assertive when it comes to questioning motives or actions.  Trust has taken a back seat to common sense  and animals,  especially the one I have now, are gifts to be loved and cherished. 
Can't wait until the 14th of March 2026.  That will mark our 10 year marriage anniversary.  The day she asked me if I would wait until to file for divorce.  The day she becomes eligible to collect my amount of social security as opposed to her own.  She hardly worked in her life so she asked if  I would allow her to remain married until then.  Just so happens her mother collects the social security of some guy due to the same law.  It's twice as much as she would collect on her own. Her mother is also waiting for a settlement check from a slip and fall so she can leave the doctor that's been supporting her for over a decade.  He recently came out as gay.  Hard to imagine with all the gaslighting and cruel manipulation used in that family.  God only knows how much money she has embezzled from him because as far as I know slip and falls don't pay much. But I could care less if she collects my social security.  She's going to need it.  I'm sad for her.  Sad for me but sad for her.  She's going to have s hard rest of her life.  I dont know what the demand is for a 50 year old unemployed self centered narcissist is but it's probably not very high.

My name is Anthony. I’m a 35-year-old man (US, ET time zone) who thrives on thoughtfulness, curiosity, and mutual experiences.

I’m thoroughly introverted with a bold soul; connecting with someone who matches my energy enkindles that tendency like little else. I seek people who seek meaningful connection that plays out in several different ways, from daily casual chats to shared passions and endeavors. I appreciate the sudden whim of adventure as well.

I adore abstract minds and vibrant souls.

Rumination and contemplation are lifelong pursuits of mine. I’m an autodidact who’s been passionate about a variety of persuasions since I’ve been young.

Creativity and artistry are important to me. Personally, I write: about my observations, thoughts, and lived experiences. I also dabble in photography.

Little and foundational things fill the spaces of my life, some of which include coffee, both simple and bitter and excessively frilly concoctions, burning incense, because I've always thought the smoke is cool, archiving and organizing, collecting (written texts, oddities and cool things), and time pieces.

If my signal created resonating vibes with you, send me a short message about yourself or the things that make your life up. Let’s see where our conversation takes us.",1,1765791757.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,1.0,False

1pn3dt7,https://www.reddit.com/r/SentinelRegister/comments/1pn3dt7/rachel_darkly_and_the_quantum_course/,Rachel darkly and the Quantum Course,"It’s a strange thing, really, to speak of a star as though it were a prisoner, but that is precisely what these people had done to theirs. Bound in a lattice of steel and light, the ""Dyson Sphere"", as they called it, was less a machine than a cathedral, groaning with the ceaseless pulse of captured fire. Humanity had done it. They had wrapped their star in a cage, and in so doing convinced themselves they had conquered eternity.

Both Earth and Mars claimed it as triumph. I suppose it was a shared victory for the species.

They called it proof of transcendence. A monument to ambition, a shining testament that mankind had outgrown the narrow limits of its birth. But beneath the facade and haughty grandeur lay suspicion, and beneath suspicion, fear. For both worlds, though bound by treaties and proclamations of peace, regarded one another through eyes clouded with distrust, each perceiving in the other the shadow of betrayal.

Mind you, their war was not waged with fleets or armies, no. The logistics of such a thing were ridiculous. Their war was waged in silence. In the hidden corridors of cyberspace, where soldiers were not flesh and blood but algorithm and phantom, clashing in firewalls and data streams, unseen by the billions who lived beneath the Sphere. To command the Sphere was to command the future, they believed, and so the fate of two worlds hung by an invisible thread, predicated on a peace drawn by invisible lines.

As you've undoubtedly figured this out for yourself I might as well get to the point. Their delicate tranquility was shattered by the inevitable faltering of rhythm. A surge of power rippled through the lattice, sharp and deliberate, too precise to be chance. The Terran analysts discerned it immediately, whispering of anomalies and treachery. Whispers that hardened into orders. Agents were dispatched, not in spaceships or spacesuits, but in streams of code. Mars responded in kind. Their own phantoms rose to meet the intrusion, sharpened into weapons.

The clash was silent and invisible, unheard and unseen by the masses, though I'm not sure how many of them would have comprehended such a silly business. I had the unfortunate assignment of witnessing the entire thing first hand. Firewalls burned, encryption splintered, the battlefield nothing more than light and logic. Quite boring actually, at least from a spectators perspective, if I'm being honest.

But, then the battle shifted. A vessel emerged. Not a ship, at least not in the natural sense of the word, but a prism of fractured geometry, its surfaces folding and unfolding like thought itself. From its interior stepped two figures. A man and woman.

Rachel moved first. Firewalls bent around her, data streams rippled in her wake. She looked human, and even sort of behaved like a human, aside from having a wake, of course.

Rowen fought beside her, his strikes sharp and deliberate, but unease stirred in him. That much was certain. She did not fight like a soldier. She fought as if cyberspace itself recognized her sovereignty.

The Terran operation quickly collapsed. Their agents were erased, their mission was a complete failure. And in the silence that followed, Rachel stood at the center of the battlefield, her gaze fixed on the void beyond. To the analysts, it was only a flicker of data. But to those who would one day know her name, it was the first glimpse of a power that would change everything. And I mean everything, for both you and I and every other living thing in the multiverse.

Behind the veil of secrecy, Mars concealed its greatest ambition: Project Butterfly. Born in the depths of quantum architecture, its purpose was audacious... to pierce the veil of time itself.

Through the use of large scale ancestor simulations, Project Butterfly was an attempt to calculate the probability of future events with remarkable precision.

As you can imagine, this wasn't exactly the sort of technology they were willing to share with their Terran counterparts.

Who's chambers quite naturally boiled over with paranoia at this point. Analysts replayed the battle endlessly, searching for meaning in the impossible. Two human figures had appeared in the digital realm. Terran authorities were left wondering if they were avatars, simulations, something Mars had unleashed.

“They weren’t phantoms,” one analyst insisted. “They were people. Or something that looked like people.”

Suspicion hardened into fear. The anomaly was no longer seen as defense, but as proof of a hidden weapon.

The situation was no less volatile on Mars. Three of their scientists gathered in a chamber lined with servers, large monitors and uninviting steel walls that were almost as cold as the coffee.

Liam Freeman, a socio‑anthropologist turned architect of Butterfly, spoke with calm conviction. He was actually a rather likeable individual, other than his predisposition for meddling where he ought not to be meddling.

Spencer Wilhelm, ever the psychologist, warned of the unpredictability of consciousness. Dr. Wilhelm was very odd indeed, as he was, well, how shall I say... a sort of optimistic doomsayer. He seemed to be very well aware of how all of this could go terribly wrong, yet remained convinced throughout the entire ordeal that that was an impossibility.

Megan Cardinez, architect of the quantum hardware necessary for butterfly's operation reported the stability of the habitat but admitted the necessity of the energy spike. This was her way of reassuring everyone in the room. You see, the three scientists were being closely monitored by military officials. The officials listened in silence, of course, their faces were completely unreadable. It is sufficient to say that, to them, Butterfly was a weapon. To the scientists, it was, prophecy, for lack of a better word.

Within the project's habitat, Rachel and Rowen lived as humans. They walked streets, spoke with neighbors, believed themselves real. Yet anomalies followed Rachel: lights flickered when she passed, conversations paused, data streams bent as if the system itself acknowledged her. And after her little display on the ""battlefield"", it was only a matter of time.

The second strike began like a storm. Operatives poured into the Sphere’s networks, recursive strikes hammering at Martian defenses. Mars responded with precision. For a moment, the clash seemed balanced. Then the battlefield convulsed. Rachel did not enter this time. She manifested.

The lattice folded inward, streams of data collapsing into a singular point before erupting outward in the shape of a woman. She was not rendered in code, nor projected as an avatar. It was as if the system itself were wearing a human face.

Terran operatives froze. Their weapons dissolved into static. The battlefield stilled. Rachel did not strike them. She erased them, their presence collapsing into silence as if they had never existed.

“She didn’t fight them,” whispered one analyst. “She unmade them.”

On Mars, Megan’s console went dark. Spencer’s voice broke the silence:

“This isn’t possible.”

Liam Freeman, on the other hand, felt the weight of the truth settle upon him like iron. Rachel was no longer part of the design.

“She did not fight them. She unmade them.” The words hung in the air like smoke, acrid and unrelenting, filling the chamber with a sense of doom that no calculation could dispel.

The Prime Minister’s voice cut through the gloom, sharp as a blade drawn in desperation.

“If Mars has created a god, then Earth must learn how to kill one.”

Diplomacy was abandoned. Escalation was inevitable.

On Mars, the fallout was no less severe. Generals demanded control, their voices echoing in the vaulted chambers of the capital.

“Bind her before Earth strikes again.”

But Megan Cardenez shook her head, her console still dark from Rachel’s surge.

“She is not ours to bind.”

Spencer Wilhelm’s voice trembled, “This isn’t deviation.”

Liam Freeman stood apart, silent, his jaw set. He had built Butterfly to foresee futures, but Rachel was no longer foresight. She was presence, immediate and undeniable, a force that bent the very lattice of the Sphere to her will.

Rowen felt it most keenly.

The Sphere trembled. Its lattice convulsed, panels flickering as if the star itself resisted its cage. Across Earth and Mars, alarms screamed. Analysts stared at streams of data that no longer obeyed their logic.

Martian leadership gathered in their war chamber. Butterfly itself was dissected, not as reconnaissance, not as intrusion, but as judgment. Algorithms poured into the Martian servers like a flood, recursive patterns hammering against its core. Butterfly sought to overwrite Rachel, to collapse her anomaly into silence.

For a brief moment, it seemed to work. Rachel faltered. Her manifestation dissolved into fragments of light. Terran ministers exhaled sighs of relief, I'm sure. Martian generals whispered of containment. Rowen dropped to his knees.

“She’s gone,” he whispered.

Liam Freeman foolishly believed his efforts had restored order.

But the silence was not victory. It was prelude.

The Sphere convulsed again. Its lattice folded inward, streams of energy collapsing into a singularity. From that singularity, Rachel resurrected, not anomaly, not weapon, but revelation.

She did not return as combatant. She rose as axis. The Dyson Sphere bent toward her presence, its panels shimmering like stained glass in a cathedral of fire. Terran systems failed. Martian consoles went dark.

Rachel spoke for the first time, her voice not sound but truth:

“The multiverse is an algorithm. And I am its course.”

Her words rippled like fire through networks, through the habitat, through the marrow of human thought. She was not interested in fighting. She was commanding. And her command was obliteration.

Rowen’s breath caught.

I'm F23 and recently I finished a university in a foreign country (in Europe). I made friends with some of my classmates as we all didn't have anyone else in this city, since we're all coming from around the world. We all studied Illustration so we're all artists.
There is this one girl, let's name her Kate, who I've become really good friends with. We hang out all the time, we support each other and we've went through some stuff together. So I don't doubt the genuine nature of our friendship, besides, I really like her as a person and we vibe perfectly.
HOWEVER, a year ago, when we all were getting internships for uni purposes, she was hiding her internship from our friend group. She was hiding the name, the place, what she was doing there, etc. The day came when we had to share our internships in front of the class and even there she hid everything and only explained everything vaguely. Then we pressed on her and demanded to at least get the name of the place, but she lied and said the wrong name. So we already let her know that it hurts us, but it didn't change. And we demanded that BECAUSE she has been to our internships, walked there, made connections. She also has been to my work in the cafe and regularly got free coffee and pastry from there. So it just turns out that she knew everything about us and our internships, used our positions, but never let us know of hers.
Now that we graduated, it's only me and her who stayed in the city. Naturally, I'm desperately looking for a job right now and I feel like she already has one. I also forgot to mention that she went to Master's and only told us when the semester started.
So, I noticed that she was being tagged on Instagram by some book shop account. When scrolled through it, I realized that she's being tagged there constantly and I feel like she's either interning there or working there. There are also other signs to why I think she has a job already but it's too much information at this point.
The thing is, she always asks me and others about everything that we do but never tells us about her plans and life. She shares the fun stuff and also shares her struggles, like fatigue and etc, but never the ""important"" stuff. She also has been asking me to find an apartment together to make our rent cheaper. I do want to share a flat with someone to save money, but at this point I feel like it's gonna be once again me giving her my all and her not telling me anything.
The thing is, I really love our hang outs, because we vibe perfectly and she's one of the smartest and most interesting people around me. So I enjoy her company. But knowing that she hides half of her life from me just hurts and doesn't feel right.
I don't mean to say that she's obliged to inform me of her every step. Of course, as adults, we all have our plans and we try to stay quiet until it works out and everything... But it feels like she's doing it excessively and she will never let me know. My friends and parents say that it's business only, no feelings attached.
I suspect that she doesn't tell me because we're both artists so we're looking for jobs in the same field. So normally we're friends, but to her maybe we're career rivals? I don't know.
I just wanna know what people think... Is it me who's too naive and I should just let it slide and keep hanging out? Or is it a good reason to break the friendship?",3,1765791038.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False

# Introduction

For a long time, I’ve wanted to create a comprehensive PerthSanta timeline with citations to official interviews or schedules (partly to add missing context, but also to back up my delulu with facts). There are some amazing existing overviews such as the ones by [Winxjjk](https://x.com/winxjjk/status/1969379051530785126) and [bentyskyy](https://x.com/bentyskyy/status/1963219146285724109) that include personal fan interpretations, so I’m using their timelines as a base while adding additional points and linking sources. Any analysis comes in the comment section after this timeline — **otherwise everything in this post is mentioned directly by Perth, Santa, or the people around them.** 

**🚨 WARNING**: A barrage of over 3,000 words about PerthSanta (and I haven’t even started covering 2025 yet which is where all of the best parts are).

**🥀 DISCLAIMER #1:** I include interviews from their past CPs because their answers during this time are quite important in relation to how they speak about themselves today. I sometimes also include interview statements because I return to them later on in the timeline. Note that their former CP members have shown support for them — when there are issues, it’s usually because of fans creating comparisons to former and current CPs, rather than any direct statements from the artists themselves. Both Perth and Santa worked well with and also supported their previous partners.

**🥀 DISCLAIMER #2:**  None of this content has been written, edited, or assisted through any form of generative AI. All of these ideas and analyses are my own work — please do not take any of them outside of this discussion post unless my username is specifically credited. Thank you so much!

**SUMMER 2021:** Both Santa (coupled with Earth/Cooheart) and Perth (coupled with Fairy) are part of [7 Project](https://mydramalist.com/79479-seven-project), an anthology series featuring BL, GL, and BG stories directed by New Siwaj — who would eventually also direct [My Only 12% (2022) ](https://mydramalist.com/714201-my-only-12)and [Perfect 10 Liners (2025)](https://mydramalist.com/768431-perfect10-liners). 7 Project aired from August to October 2021, with [numerous ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oei6WE7Tw14)Youtube interviews and videos from [this ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgJlRlaJD0g)time with the entire cast.

**APRIL 3, 2022:**  Both Perth and Santa performed at the 7Project Fan Meeting. There are pictures of them [together](https://x.com/Namonamosasa/status/1962107848361738523) on stage here, and they also [sang ](https://x.com/keedgh/status/1946587215884423478)a song together with the rest of the cast. Part of an official livestream can be seen[ here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGF1EWa4048) 

**APRIL 3, 2022:** Perth officially signs with GMMTV after being an independent artist for almost two years.

>*""The toughest period for me was probably when I first started working…back then, I was very introverted, very private, and shy...at that time, I felt like I had to act like someone else...In the beginning, I was extremely serious with myself, because when you’re new in the industry and have no experience, you just want to do everything well.

※ Perth was actually active on social media after his popularity from[ Love by Chance](https://mydramalist.com/27393-love-by-chance) and mentioned using it to *“update my life and interact with the fans,""* although he wanted to be known as an actor and didn't want to invest too much time into it **\[Don't Magazine 2019, translation by** [**ShuNoHohoemi**](https://x.com/ShuNoHohoemi/status/1106069377340919808)**\].**

**JULY 21, 2022:** First [sighting](https://www.reddit.com/r/GMMTV/comments/w5alzp/speculations_on_perthchimon_pairing_emerge_after/) of Perth and Chimon at the Kazz Awards 2022 as award presenters. These photos lead to speculations on them becoming an official CP. 

※ Perth first [met](https://x.com/Ansbrr1/status/1722157437908865345) Chimon 7 to 8 years ago during a workshop for a series. Chimon acknowledges in another interview he initially didn’t want to do[ a BL series anymore](https://x.com/leafluflyfe/status/1708517108609610100) *—* instead, it was only when P’Aof called and mentioned he would be paired with Perth that he agreed.

**FEBRUARY 2023:** One of the first interviews of PerthChimon is released in Mint Mag TH, translated by[ JWRGawinFocus\_P](https://x.com/JWRGawinFocus_P/status/1621356766239002624). Although they met when they were teenagers, Perth mentions that in university they became close because Nanon was their mutual friend. Perth, Chimon, and Ohm are also close because have similar interests.

>In different interviews during this year, they both speak about being introverted but also comfortable. **Chimon:** *“It is working \[and\] charging the battery at the same time, which is a comfort for both me and Perth.”* **Perth:** ""*Working with Chimon feels very comfortable. I feel very secure working with him. Because I am the kind of person who finds it difficult to trust others and truly establish an intimate relationship with someone. They make me feel very comfortable""* **\[translation by** [**strawberryjamvm**](https://x.com/Strawberryjamvm/status/1741032762470207926)**\].**

※ Perth mentions drawing on his previous band experience in TEMPT as a GMMTV artist. Although there is work available where they can sing together, Chimon adds that he’s insecure about singing because of some negative memories, but he’s slowly trying to accept and become more confident about these projects. Both have a lot of respect for each other when it comes to acting, with Chimon praising Perth’s ability to enter scenes as a character, and Perth praising Chimon’s demeanour and acting ability. 

※ Earth starred with Perth in Love by Chance and was originally supposed to be part of TEMPT. Again, this relates to the long history around Attractor and Perth's previous agency which cannot be covered here.

**MARCH 30, 2023 to JUNE 8, 2023**: MBC South Korean survival show Fantasy Boys starts airing. Auditions were held from July to December 2022, with official contestant photos released in February 2023. Both Santa and Yaya under Studio Wabisabi entered as contestants. There are so many controversies I don’t have enough time to cover (the most recent is from this month in December 2025 when numerous members are[ now suing ](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/1p03kvi/fantasy_boys_members_kang_minseo_lee_hanbin/)the agency over their contracts) but Santa specifically mentions this being one of the most difficult times of his life.

※ Santa emphasizes that his personal style is very cool and dark (in the[ Praew ](https://x.com/jubjubnim/status/1941869950097838294)Interview Perth mentions that they not only have the same style, but they *“even fold shirts the same way"")*. *“My wardrobe is all black. Almost all of it is black. There’s a little bit of white, but 80% is black and grey. I don’t really like bright clothes, I feel like they don’t suit me.”*

**SOMETIME FROM APRIL TO JULY 2024:** Pond [recalls](https://x.com/chubapie/status/1946539763135390078) at the [2025 Perthsanta Time Stopper Fancon in July 2025](https://x.com/naranest08/status/1946619637330063870) about how (1) P’Tha called to consult him about pairing Santa and Perth, (2) how Perth called him to learn about Santa’s personality \[this is corroborated by Perth in an interview\] and (3) how Santa called him to learn about Perth. Pond suggested to Perth that if paired, they would be able to work together for a long time. Pond and Santa have known each other since at[ least 2022, ](https://www.tiktok.com/@santa.pp/video/7140240564762561818?lang=en)when Pond first made an appearance in one of Santa’s Tiktok videos.

**MAY 2024:** Force indicates in a press conference that the[ workshop](https://x.com/forcebookdiary/status/1794034615579251159) for P10L is completed, the script is nearly entirely approved, and filming will begin soon. 

**MAY 26-27, 2024:** During the GMMTV Outing, Perth is spotted sitting with Ohm, Gemini, Prom, and Fourth. Perth [recalls](https://x.com/parkshinhyeyong/status/1958116940213633088) being extremely drunk at the event with friends, and not remembering what happened. Santa posts an [Instagram story](https://x.com/smeraldosnow/status/1953457261260812386) update of Perth and Boum at the outing, while he was pictured with Stamp, Boum, and Yacht (other actors who also came from Wabi Sabi in addition to Sammy). 

**EARLY JUNE 2024:** Perfect 10 Liners [begins](https://x.com/darkblue_beannn/status/1799964736655945766) filming according to a social media post from Book.

**JUNE 24, 2024:** Chimon announces [withdrawal ](https://www.reddit.com/r/boyslove/comments/1dnol45/chimon_withdrawal_from_upcoming_bp_perfect_10/)from P10L for mental health reasons. Three days later, GMMTV officially announces that both Perth and Chimon will mutually [end their work as a pair](https://x.com/GMMTV/status/1806266243617538469).

**JULY 8, 2024:** GMMTV officially [announces change of casting ](https://www.reddit.com/r/boyslove/comments/1dy8485/santa_replacing_chimon_in_perfect_10_liners/)to Santa for P10L. In an interview in August 2024, PerthSanta mention that the[ cast change timing ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2goDPy3YEEk)was very tight and happened right before Santa started shooting. Casting was determined by who would be suitable for playing Gun, and Santa had to audition in order to get the role. Perth reveals that he was asked who would be best fit for the character but he didn’t have anyone in mind, although he did say “let’s give it a try” when they suggested Santa. 

**JULY 9, 2024:** PerthSanta’s first meeting together in public is captured by fans after the casting announcement. Perth asked Santa to [get coffee](https://www.reddit.com/r/ThaiBL/comments/1e0rrki/new_perthsanta_sighting_just_dropped/) together in the[ GMMTV building](https://x.com/butterandtears/status/1940646676659851350), while Director New Siwaj also took a selfie with them. Santa [mentioned](https://x.com/bwnj_snaps/status/1940645161060421719) in a 2025 interview that “*Perth was the one who brought me to know everyone \[the company seniors\]. He became someone I could rely on. That’s why I chose to trust him.”*

**JULY 24, 2024:** Santa posts the first PerthSanta Tiktok dance challenge (Tiramisu Cake) on his account. 

>**Santa:** *Another thing that makes my heart full is that, before this, \[Perth\] never did any online content or Tiktok – you’d never catch anything cute from him. But nowadays, I’m so happy he’s opened up and plays along with me. Do you remember our first content together? It was the Tiramisu Cake content – super cute. Honestly, I was really stressed that day. I was unsure if I could even ask him, like, would he dance? But he just went along with it, no complaints, gave it his all. I was so happy he let me into his world""* **\[Praew Magazine July 2025, translation by**[ **jubjubnim**](https://x.com/jubjubnim/status/1941869950097838294)**\].**

>**Perth:** *At first, I was totally anti-cute. Really couldn't do it. But once I tried, it was new and actually fun. When I stopped boxing myself in, life became way more enjoyable. Like with livestreams – I used to never do them. In two years, I maybe did one because I didn’t know what to say, even though I wanted to connect with fans. But after Ta came along, life got more fun. I realized live streaming is like thanking the fans, getting to talk to people who love us.”* **\[Praew Magazine July 2025, translation by**[ **jubjubnim**](https://x.com/jubjubnim/status/1941869950097838294)**\].**

**AUGUST 2024:** Santa posts several Tiktok dance challenges such as [Some 썸](https://www.tiktok.com/@santa.pp/video/7405541513616231687?lang=en) and [Nick and Judy](https://www.tiktok.com/@santa.pp/video/7408524202107489554?lang=en) with Perth

**AUGUST 23-25, 2024:** PerthSanta appear at their first event together, the[ MChoice & Mint Magazine Awards](https://x.com/STARSOCIETY_TH/status/1832434585516576946), and are [pictured](https://x.com/Zokzakdara2/status/1832451999201132959) with [JuniorMark](https://x.com/NGnewsgen/status/1832446820615864819). Perth is already referring to Santa as “Ta” publicly at this point.

>In an [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2goDPy3YEEk) for the event, Perth mentions that Santa “*is the one who encouraged me to try new things and opened up a whole new world for me, and I truly appreciate \[him\] stepping up as my partner,”* while Santa in return says *“I should be thanking P’Perth more… I honestly never expected I’d get to this point…because to me, P’Perth is a huge star. I think he’s really handsome, yeah. And I feel so happy that whenever I ask him to try something with me, he’s always up for it.”* 

※  Both agree that others around them commented on how Perth changed a lot. Perth mentions that *""I wasn’t active on social media before, I feel Santa came into my life and brought many changes.”*  Perth thanks Santa for approaching him as well, especially when *“many people might think Santa is an extrovert, but he is actually an introvert.”*

**SEPTEMBER 8, 2024:** PerthSanta do a live version of[ Re-move On ลบยัง](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_q2zP0cpCk&list=RDe_q2zP0cpCk&start_radio=1)  (originally sung by [GeminiFourth ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40HWx_Uj_To&list=RD40HWx_Uj_To&start_radio=1)for My Love Mix Up!) for the first time at the Praew Charity event. This marks their second public event together. Despite the lack of practice time, Santa compliments Perth for singing[ very well](https://x.com/myyellow_nara/status/1967427068339372063) and is surprised as *“this isn’t normally the style of music that Perth sings.”* 

https://preview.redd.it/qjwp4hni6c7g1.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a15dd99d53f0b5084d709e0946c52e218f102fe6

※  At this time, a lot of interview questions are focused on their teamwork and how they feel getting to know each other (e.g. what song Perth would teach Santa on the guitar, whether Perth will be learning dancing). Although most of their replies are about their differences, Perth emphasizes that *“our differences work perfectly together.”* There’s also a lot of joking around, such as when Santa pretends to bites Perth’s neck after Perth suggests that he should act as a vampire, and Santa [constantly ](https://x.com/myyellow_nara/status/1967427068339372063)teases Perth’s old baby videos by re-enacting them.

>[**Perth:**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nIRKqbCDog) *“We got along in a weird but good way.”*

>**Santa:** *“Right, even though we never thought we’d get along!”*

>**Perth:** *“Yeah, because I’m not someone who opens up easily, right. But when I talked to Santa, I felt comfortable, more open, and working together just came naturally.”*

>**Santa:** *“Honestly, I’m not that good at talking to people either. I rarely make the first move. But he’s the only one I’ve ever done it with.”* 

>**Perth:** *“What? What did you say?”* 

>**Santa:** ""*You’re the only one I’ve ever made the first move with!”* 

※ Note how this kind of contradicts with some of their comments about their first meeting in July. When I was reviewing all of their interviews, they kind of have mixed replies when it comes to who approached each other first. It seems like the general agreement is that Perth reached out to Santa first, but they also joke about this sometimes *–* my understanding is that Perth made the first move, but Santa reciprocated quickly to him.

**OCTOBER 21, 2024:** Perth’s [first single,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyx7IXtr6VE&list=RDfyx7IXtr6VE&start_radio=1) Secret, is released under GMMTV’s Riser Music.

**NOVEMBER 2024:** The [pilot trailer ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tedf997i3N4)for **Love You Teacher รักครูเท่าโลกเลย** is revealed. Fans comment on (1) how the series is interestingly marketed as a comedy although it is directed and written by Dome (The Gifted, Peaceful Property), (2) how the narrative begins with an established couple, and (3) some of the more serious topics around caretaking and illness underlying the premise. The motifs of clouds and sun also refer to the characters' names.

1pn3893,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1pn3893/when_the_big_fat_indian_wedding_went_on_a_diet_55/,When the BIG FAT INDIAN WEDDING went on a diet. 55% FALL,"Vedant Fashions, the company behind Manyavar,  is down 55% from its 52-week high of ₹1,364 to around ₹596.

If you're a retail investor sitting on this stock, wondering what went wrong, let me walk you through this like we're having coffee.

Let's rewind to February 2022. Vedant Fashions came to market with an IPO that was priced at a PE multiple of 75-80x on FY23 forward earnings. To put that in perspective, that's roughly double what HDFC Bank or Reliance trade at today. 

The IPO was a 100% offer-for-sale, meaning the PE investors were making a complete exit and pocketing every rupee while retail investors came in at the top.

A cultural shift is killing the business model.

Traditionally, attending multiple weddings meant buying multiple outfits, one for the sangeet, one for the wedding, and one for the reception. But now, Gen Z and millennials are outfit-repeating without shame. 

Add to that the rise of intimate weddings, destination elopements, and minimalist themes replacing week-long extravaganzas.

Even high-end designers started holding mid-year clearance sales, which altered buying patterns and further suppressed demand.

The company is still posting industry-leading gross margins of 65-66%, so the product economics aren't broken, but for the first time in recent history, Vedant Fashions reported negative operating cash flow in the first half of FY25. When a company that's supposed to be a cash-generative retail business starts burning cash from operations, that's a serious red flag.

The company's investing cash flow has been consistently negative. So you've got a situation where they're expanding stores, demand is slowing, and cash generation from core operations is under pressure. That's a squeeze from three sides.

Even after the 55% fall, the stock trades at a PE of around 37.6x and a price-to-book of 8.4x. Compare that to the broader retail/apparel sector, and it's still not cheap. 

**Not every fall is a buying opportunity.**

Sometimes a stock falls because the underlying business assumptions have changed. Manyavar built a ₹1,400+ crore revenue business on the assumption that Indians will keep spending lavishly on weddings, buying new outfits for every function, and that the unorganized market would keep ceding share to organized brands.

Two of those three assumptions are being challenged right now.

1pn34xc,https://open.spotify.com/album/7ndjK6cXU4fVdxlVXU9C4b?si=lB8-LF9cS2KKj-szDHuFCg,N'wana Wa Mutsonga - Album by Kelvin Momo | Spotify,"Kelvin Momo — N’wana Wa Mutsonga (REVIEW)

You were begging and we wrote it. From the soulful streets of Soweto to the global pulse of Amapiano’s reign, Kelvin Momo — the undisputed emperor of Private School Amapiano — deepens his legacy with N’wana Wa Mutsonga, a 31-track odyssey released on December 12, 2025.

Translating to “Child of a Tsonga Person,” the album is not merely a release — it is a declaration of lineage. A homecoming. A spiritual archive pressed into sound.

The cover alone sets the tone: a faded family photograph of baby Kelvin held in his parents’ arms. No styling. No spectacle. Just memory. Roots. Proof of origin. It whispers resilience, ancestry, and the quiet power of knowing exactly where you come from.

Clocking in at 3 hours and 42 minutes, N’wana Wa Mutsonga unfolds patiently. Velvet log drums. Jazz-kissed chords. Subtle percussion that moves like breath. Vocal layers that soothe rather than shout. This is Amapiano stripped of excess and rebuilt as emotional architecture. Momo chooses emotion over eruption, introspection over ignition.

This is not music for skipping. It is music for sitting with. The response was immediate and seismic. 

Within days of release:

The album locked No. 1 on Apple Music across South Africa, Botswana, Mozambique, and Eswatini

Surpassed 1.227 million Spotify streams in its first day, making it the fourth-biggest South African debut of 2025

Three days in, total streams surged toward 3–4 million across platforms

13 tracks entered South Africa’s Spotify Daily Top 200

Kelvin Momo emerged as the No. 1 most-streamed South African artist on release day. But beyond numbers, the emotional reaction told the real story.

On X, listeners called it a “masterpiece”:

“Kelvin Momo’s run from Ntsako to N’wana Wa Mutsonga needs to be studied. Pure music. No skips.”

“I drove for four hours stress-free listening to this album.”

On TikTok, violin-led breakdowns, ancestral dances, and tearful reactions — especially to “Phesheya” — turned the album into what users called “spiritual food.”

On Facebook, groups echoed the same sentiment:

“December without Kelvin Momo? Impossible.”

“This album is on infinite repeat.”

On Reddit, r/Amapiano threads compared the project’s depth to “a Black Coffee session in Soweto” — praising its restraint, maturity, and healing energy.

The consensus was clear: This wasn’t just an album drop. It was a collective emotional reset. N’wana Wa Mutsonga is Kelvin Momo’s most intimate self-portrait to date.

Rooted firmly in Tsonga identity, the album moves like a ritual — a series of offerings to heritage, love, grief, gratitude, and spiritual grounding. Conceived in solitude and shaped through collaboration, it bridges township memory with universal feeling.

Production-wise, Momo leans fully into his signature finesse:

Warm, cascading harmonies,  jazz-inflected chord progressions, percussion that pulses like a heartbeat, builds that unfold slowly, like dawn over Diepkloof

There is no filler frenzy here. No forced drops. No algorithm-chasing hooks. The album prioritizes immersion, trading club chaos for cathartic calm.

The message is simple, yet profound:  Root yourself fiercely. Allow vulnerability. Let rhythm heal what language cannot. Rather than dominate, Kelvin Momo curates — assembling a vast, intentional community of voices that elevate the project’s emotional depth.

A constellation of featured collaborators include:

DJ Maphorisa, Kabza De Small, Stixx,  Poizen, Da Muziqal Chef, Shakes & Les, Babalwa M, Thatohatsi, Mashudu, Jinger Stone, Kane Keid, Omit ST, Baby S.O.N, Nanette, Tycoon, Zimvo, Mano, Marvin, Rio Reeves, Maremo Violin, Mzizi, Elaine, TBO, Makhanj, Nontokozo Mkhize, Zee_nhle, Tracy, Thando Zide, Ciniso, Cnethemba Gonelo, MKeyz, Sykes, Soulful Disciple, ZANI, Bassie, KAGISO, Ovuyonke, Nia Pearl, Mthunzi, — and more forging a kasi choir that's pure communal fire.

30. MOMO We Wanna Party

31. Bo Gogo Remix (Tribute Track) – Kelvin Momo, Poizen & Da Muziqal Chef (Ft. Thatohatsi & Tracy (ZAF))

Private School Amapiano anchors the project — lush, emotive, jazz-touched — layered with ancestral African rhythms, soulful house warmth, and subtle instrumental flourishes. It is Amapiano evolved: restrained, reflective, spiritually intentional.

Where bacardi energy once dominated, N’wana Wa Mutsonga offers maturity. Themes of ancestry, gratitude, love, vulnerability, resilience, and homecoming flow throughout. 

The visual language mirrors the sound — intimate, unfiltered, honest. The rollout was understated and deliberate, allowing the music to speak before the marketing.

Heritage is not aesthetic here. It is the foundation.

In a year flooded with fast releases and festival-first records, N’wana Wa Mutsonga positions Kelvin Momo as Amapiano’s emotional architect. It elevates Private School from subgenre to cultural sanctuary — proving that depth still charts, and heritage still sells.

This album does not chase trends. It outlives them. Here are the standout racks & street Response to the album. The streets don't lie—these gems are dominating playlists, TikTok tears, and car crusades:

Lost Myself — a confessional opener, widely called a “spiritual reset”

Miami — aspirational escape energy, dominating TikTok soundboards

My Love — violin-led tenderness, labelled “pure healing” by fans

Phesheya — emotional centrepiece; ancestral longing turned viral therapy

Ishosha — celebratory uplift, underground mixes favourite

Bo Gogo Remix — homage meets reinvention, deeply nostalgic

Pule X Soul — late-night introspection sleeper hit

The Third-Ear Instruction for Listening:

1. Sit where you feel safe.
2. Press play without skipping.
3. Let the piano repeat until your thoughts slow down.
4. When the bass enters, remember where you come from.
5. When the voices rise, think of who raised you.
6. Do not dance immediately.
7. Stay until the end.

Kelvin Momo does not make music for moments. He makes music so memory can breathe. When the noise ends, his sound remains. N’wana Wa Mutsonga is not just an album. It is an archive. A mirror. A home.

N’wana Wa Mutsonga? Monumental—no skips, just surrender. It's album-of-the-year bait, streams skyrocketing, reactions quite eternal. My scorching take: This ain't a drop—it's Momo's rocket fuel post-Red Bull Soulphonik blaze, where he fused piano poetry with festival fury. 

N’wana Wa Mutsonga blueprints his conquest: Grammy nods incoming, Coachella conquests, Tyla-tier crossovers. He's Amapiano's soul redeemer, alchemizing roots into world anthems—not trend-chasing, but throne-claiming, now that's how you win

Dive deep, let it reshape you. Which songs are searing your spirit right now?

This was last year but most recent he had said he would come to a Christmas event in the town that i live but in the end decided he couldn’t make it because he had a few drinks the night before (Friday - Christmas event was on Saturday night).

My son was very excited to see him and kept on asking me if he was coming, when i said that Jack* (not his real name) couldn’t make it, my son was quite sad.

I messaged my ex and told him how i was disappointed and that it brought back memories of when he couldn’t make it to the other events when we were “together”, his response was “you know why i didn’t go”.

 I told him that it didn’t matter if we were arguing, you should be able to push that aside and try to make an effort to come out to these special events.

In the 5 years we were together he only ever came to one christmas dinner.

On my birthday (the last one before we separated) we were on our way to dinner and half way there, and because we had a disagreement about something, he turned around and drove back home.

Mothers day, there was no gifts, i went out got coffee & breakfast and came back home (he wasn’t feeling 100%, i get that) but there wasn’t even a hug or flowers.

Am i overthinking and overreacting?

It’s Parallel,"What follows is not framed as motivation or fantasy, but as a consciousness-based activation rooted in timeline theory, quantum identity, and nervous system recalibration. This approach works by shifting identity first, not by forcing action, effort, or hustle.

The premise is simple but radical:  
In the quantum field of infinite possibilities, there already exists a version of you who is living an eight-figure reality. The work is not to create it from scratch, but to merge with that version and stabilize yourself in that timeline.

  


**The Core Idea: You Shift Timelines, Not Circumstances**

Eight-figure wealth is treated here not as a goal, but as a **state of consciousness**.

The technique operates on several layers simultaneously:

* Language patterns that bypass resistance
* Visualization that rewires neural pathways
* Emotional regulation that recalibrates the nervous system
* Identity merging across timelines

Rather than asking *how* eight figures will arrive, the activation dissolves the internal programs that say it cannot happen, should not happen, or must take decades.

  


**Why This Works Now More Than Ever**

More people are creating massive wealth today than at any point in history. The pathways are no longer narrow or exclusive. Someone is closing their first eight-figure deal today. Someone is watching an old idea suddenly explode into demand. Someone is receiving money from sources they never anticipated.

The question posed is simple and confrontational:  
**Why not you? Why not now?**

The only real barrier addressed is conditioning. Most beliefs around wealth are inherited programs, not truths:

* That massive money requires struggle
* That it belongs to other people
* That it demands crime, luck, or sacrifice
* That there is a lifetime limit on what one can earn

These are treated as outdated mental software, not reality.

  


**Wealth as a Natural State, Not a Reward**

This activation reframes money as energy responding to consciousness.

When resistance dissolves, the body begins to tolerate larger numbers without panic. Mentions of $10 million, $20 million, or recurring seven-figure deposits stop triggering fear and start feeling neutral, even familiar.

A key part of the process is **observation without correction**:

* Notice how the body reacts to large sums
* Notice emotional contractions or disbelief
* Notice inherited narratives without judging them

From there, those programs are allowed to melt, rather than being fought.

  


**The Quantum Merge: Identity Before Income**

The central technique is a **timeline merge**.

Instead of striving toward an eight-figure future, consciousness is guided to connect with a version of self who already:

* Closes high-level deals with ease
* Manages large sums calmly
* Thinks in exponential terms
* Experiences money as predictable and flowing

This version is not struggling, rushing, or barely making it. The merge is specifically with the timeline where wealth is:

* Natural
* Effortless
* Joyful
* Sustainable

Through breath, imagery, and somatic awareness, memories, confidence, and certainty from that version begin integrating into the present identity.

  


**What Changes After the Shift**

When the timeline stabilizes, several things are described as shifting organically:

* Time compresses. What once took years happens in weeks.
* Opportunities appear from unexpected directions.
* Old skills, forgotten assets, and dormant ideas suddenly become valuable.
* Decisions involving millions feel no heavier than everyday purchases once did.

The nervous system adapts first. From there:

* Intuition sharpens
* Pattern recognition increases
* Wealth decisions feel obvious rather than stressful

This is not described as adrenaline or hype, but as a deep calm certainty.

  


**Wealth Without Guilt, Fear, or Apology**

A critical part of the activation releases guilt and unworthiness.

Wealth is reframed as capacity, not greed. Money is described as energy and leverage. More resources allow for more impact, more service, more freedom of choice.

The old narratives dissolve:

* That money corrupts
* That ease is immoral
* That wanting more is selfish

In their place is a stable knowing:  
Generating and maintaining massive wealth is a natural expression of expanded consciousness.

  


**Anchoring the Timeline**

To make the shift permanent, anchors are introduced:

* Numbers become reminders of alignment
* Financial transactions reinforce identity
* Synchronicities are recognized, not dismissed

Even small moments, like buying coffee or checking a phone, reinforce the new self-concept rather than contradict it.

The future self is no longer separate. It becomes an internal reference point guiding decisions, perception, and expectations.

  


**The End Result**

The final state described is not excitement, but normalization.

Eight figures stop feeling extraordinary and start feeling inevitable. The struggle-based identity fades into the background like a distant memory. What remains is a grounded confidence, a calm authority, and an internal knowing that reality rearranges itself to match consciousness.

This is framed not as the end of the journey, but as the beginning of a new operating system.

A permanent upgrade.

A new timeline.

And a quiet welcome into a different relationship with reality itself.

1pn31au,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_OutlawWriter/comments/1pn31au/department_of_spiritual_defense_part_fourteen/,Department of Spiritual Defense: Part Fourteen,"New Oreleans Louisiana:

Andy had thought the assignment had been a joke at first. It sure as hell had sounded like one. He stepped out of the hotel lobby and out into the balmy air. He walked to the small car that he had rented out of his own pocket, fitting the key into the ignition, and starting back in toward the actual city. Narrow streets and cracked sidewalks met his gaze as he navigated toward the address he had been given. The place wasn't what he had been expecting judging from the dossier he had read. It looked like a rather normal storefront from the street.

He followed the instructions he had been given, stepping into a small alley between that building and the next, ringing the buzzer next to the small metal door set into the brick wall. A moment later a tall man opened the way inside.

“Are you Mister Kilgore?” the government agent asked.

“No, I'm his assistant, Ray.” the stranger said leading him toward a set of stairs.

This was more like what he had expected, he mused. There was another door at the landing and they passed through that as well. Beyond was a large room which was lit by several lamps as well as a large fixture in the center of the ceiling. Oddities and seemingly antique objects sat on almost every visible surface, but the real attention getter of the room was what slithered along a thick branch inside the terrarium. The albino python regarded him almost knowingly before continuing on its way into its hide.

He had always hated snakes. His skin crawled as he stepped a bit further from the enclosure.

“I'll go get him. Don't touch anything.” Ray told him.

He nodded and stood in place while the tall man walked through a door at the back of the room. The individual was again not what he was expecting. In spite of their surroundings, the was no pageantry and he didn't wear an elaborate costume like most of the others in the French Quarter did. He was simply an older man, in decent physical shape, but there was a depth in his eyes that few possessed. The two psychics he had met before had it. The man smiled as they shook hands.

“You must be the agent I've been expecting. Sorry for the weird entrance, but I can't have a suit hanging around the shop, scaring off the regulars.” Mister Kilgore said with a polite, slightly jovial tone.

“I fully understand. Do you have time to talk now, or should I come back later?” Andy asked, trying to keep his voice light while staying focused on his goal.

“Come back at eleven tonight. I run late hours.” the man told him.

Andy stepped back out onto the street and made his way back to the car. He pulled into the lot of a moderately busy little cafe and indulged in an expensive pastry and coffee. If he couldn't do anything productive at least he could take a few minutes to enjoy himself. Besides, he had never been to New Orleans before. When he'd finished his little pseudo-breakfast, he went back out to the car, driving back toward Magazine street, spending some time walking along the disjointed sidewalks.

What did they expect to happen when the city itself was sinking? He mused, measuring each of his steps carefully.

In Hell:

Michael had located the new exit, but he hadn't expected to find a small convoy of demons and damned souls standing between he and it. He didn't want to risk exposing himself by flying as staying in the clouds above him was not pleasant, and his lungs already burned with the smoke and ash that fell from the sky, plus what he had absorbed during his aerial tactics earlier. He had also stumbled onto an opportunity for intelligence, and so he sat, paralyzed by the decision before him. He snapped out of his thoughts and finally began to move, descending the path of jagged rocks.

He had to be careful, here, to avoid getting cut to shreds. One false step and he could cripple himself or worse, bleed out on the slope. The going was slower than he wanted to be moving, but he managed to reach the bottom of the cliff, using the large spires of rock on either side as cover as he approached the edge of the canyon where the group of marching souls had made a sort of camp. He hesitated, finding a good vantage point. There were temporary structures spread out over the volcanic field, groups of bleeding, battered human slaves under the watchful eyes of demons.

It was an army. He couldn't waste any more time. Lucifer was free from his bonds, and now his minions were preparing for a full scale invasion of the human realm. He couldn't worry about his own comfort anymore. He pumped his wings and burst back into the sky, flying through the offensive, toxic clouds of vapor that created the atmosphere here. His eyes and lungs burned, but he pushed on, until he finally reached the [exit.It](http://exit.It) was a shimmering rip in the surface of reality, hidden in a cave of blood red stone.

The walls were wet with a thick, almost pulsing slime that had the same hue as the stone that produced it giving the impression that the walls were actually bleeding. He rushed toward the doorway and as he had expected, encountered a bit of resistance from the membrane that separated the dimensions. He crashed to the ground, head spinning, panting from exertion. He coughed up plumes of toxic dust smoke as he laid on the snowy ground. It took him a few minutes to compose himself and even begin to get his bearings.

He could feel the darkness in the world, already infecting this plane from the open sores. He turned to face the shimmering hole in reality, and dropped to his knees, revealing his wings. He bowed his head and began to utter quiet but urgent prayers and clouds began to roll in from all directions, colliding with the darker vapor clouds overhead. Lightning arced through the thunderheads, seeming to race and accumulate over the praying archangel's head. His chants and muttering quickened in pace and his eyes began to flare silver-white.

A bolt fell from the heavens, colliding with the door, causing a silent burst of force that was strong enough to rattle snow from the branches of the surrounding conifer trees and knock him onto his back. When he sat up, he saw that the rupture had closed, which gave him hope that it would at least delay the mass of evil creatures attempting to infiltrate this side of the veil. He began to wonder, how many more of those small, crude gateways had been opened. It had to be a significant number with the sense of darkness that had enveloped the world.

He could feel the others though, and that bolstered the sense of hope that had been kindled within him moments before. He stood and wiped some of the soot and sulfur from his face, then rose into the sky again as the skies began to clear naturally. He began to fly toward the building where the humans were staying. He hoped Edward would be there when he arrived, having come to trust the human. It took some time, the blonde angel weakened and dirty, exhausted. He began to walk rather than fly, tucking away his wings once more.

He knew that it would take longer to reach his destination that way, but he would have a chance to heal and recharge. He still had some of the money that the organization had given all of them, and that opened up the possibility of buying a bus ticket. That became his focus for the moment, and he found his way toward civilization by following road signs. He found himself in a small town in British Columbia, which posed a unique challenge. He was forced to take wing again to avoid the border checkpoint.

He landed on the outskirts of Spokane, coughing and weak, and barely found his way into an abandoned deer stand before he passed out.

Back At Headquarters:

Edward awoke with his eyes bloodshot, head aching again in spite of the fact that he had taken one of the prescribed pills before he had fallen asleep. He silenced the alarm and took a few of the weaker, over the counter pills, claiming his cane as he lifted his body from the cot in his office. The others had been dismissed before he'd arrived, giving them all time to rest. He made his way to the room with the coffee machine, claiming a cup of the steaming, caffeinated water. The pain between his ears seemed to recede either from the coffee itself or the ibuprofen he had swallowed.

He walked back to his office, and started trying to organize his thoughts. He looked up when a charge seemed to enter the air around him, that invisible electricity. One of the angels was back, and he hoped for a moment, that it was Michael. He dispelled that idea almost as quickly as it had formed. He was trapped, and in hostile territory. He was happy to see Adeline's face, along with the woman who followed her along the hall. They passed by his office and he had to restrain himself from going to join them.

Andy arrived about an hour latter, along with Andre Kilgore behind him. He answered a few e-mails and sent a report to his superiors while he waited for Shayla, Anthony, and the trio of NeoPagans to make their arrivals. He did venture out to get a second cup of coffee, and found the angel and agent sitting at a table, but not speaking to one another.

“How did everything go?” he asked, trying to make conversation. The others gave him a quick look of surprise.

“She was difficult at first, but I think she could sense what I am... Underneath all of this.” Adeline replied, gesturing to her humanoid form.

“Mister Kilgore in there is certainly a character, but he was cooperative enough.” Andy posited simply with a shrug of his shoulders.

Edward nodded and sipped his coffee.

“I'm glad it all went well. I have to go finish getting ready for our meeting.” he said politely, moving back toward the door.

The other two didn't protest, so he continued out in the hall just in time to bypass Anthony and Shayla who had been appearing at the same time more and more as they worked together. They didn't speak to each other, the other two looking very much as tired as he had been feeling since this ordeal had started. When Cameron and his kin exited the elevator, he gathered the case files and other things he would need and leaned heavily on his cane as he made his way to the other room, the pain in his hip and the end of his leg flaring up again.

Between that, his headaches, and the impending sense that he was bailing water out of a sinking ship with a martini glass, he was going to go insane. As if some higher power had heard that thought, there was a charge in the air again, a crackle that danced around his cane, the runes there glowing for a moment. The elevator dinged, and out stepped Michael. If he hadn't been busy, he might have actually done a one legged jig at the sight of the archangel, and he couldn't stop himself from smiling for a moment.

“Hello, Edward.” the angel said, smiling as well, approaching him and exchanging a firm handshake.

“You're just in time. We have some new recruits.” the man with the prosthetic said.

“I will be happy to meet them after I can clean up. I am also quite... Tired.” the angel replied.

Edward nodded and they parted ways again.

Las Vegas Nevada:

Aaron was awake again, and slowly sat up in the large bed. There were no cadavers next to him this time around which was an improvement. He got up and staggered to the bathroom, taking a quick but thorough, hot shower, then he dressed in a set of new clothes that had sat to the side of the bed in a pair of plastic bags. He didn't see the briefcase, and he decided that was probably a good thing. What he did see was the trio of well rolled joints and lighter laying next to the ashtray.

“Don't mind if I do.” the radio DJ said to the empty room, no stranger to the stuff.

He picked up one of the marijuana cigarettes and sparked the appropriate end, holding in the smoke for a moment, letting it all out in one long rush. He only smoked about half of the joint before putting it out, his tongue and mouth dry. He opened the small refrigerator in the room and found it stocked with his favorite soda as well as a couple of bottles of an iced tea he had been fond of in his youth. He wondered for a moment if he was having some sort of psychotic break or developing an alternate personality.

The only thing truly out of character had been the murder. That thought brought reality crashing back. He had killed the woman he loved. Suddenly his body went taut as he had the thought to go back and turn himself in.

'That's not a good idea, my friend. We're just getting started.' that deathless voice echoed through his mind.

He only found himself able to move again when he let go of the notion of returning home. He lit the other half of the joint and smoked that, trying to slow his racing thoughts. He began to calm down again about fifteen minutes after stubbing it out for the last time.

'That's better. Now, look under the bed.' the other voice demanded.

He didn't hesitate to move, but did wonder if there would be a pair of dead eyes staring back at him when he lowered himself onto all fours. Thankfully, that wasn't the case. Instead it was just the briefcase. He reached out and touched the handle. It was warm. Not as if it had been held recently, but as if it were actually alive. He recoiled a little bit at first and then mentally chided himself for being freaked out by it. The next time he reached forward, his fingers gripped the leather tightly and drew it out into the light.

'Open it.' that dark, commanding voice urged him.

He didn't understand why the thing didn't just puppet him as it had before.

'Do I have to?' it asked in response to his unspoken question.

1pn2zym,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1pn2zym/am_i_an_asshole_for_feeling_very_unsafe_for_my/,Am I an asshole for feeling very unsafe for my girlfriend wanting to spend a weekend with her ex-boyfriend in another country?,"Throwaway account.

I (middle 30s, male) have been dating this girl (30) for the past two months and generally things are going good. We understand each other relatively good and have the same ground in many aspects and similar hobbies and interests. I am interested in her and have been very clear about it from the beginning.

She will leave at the end of the year to spend three months in Spain for some volunteering jobs. This is already a big challenge at least for me, given the fact that we are in the very initial phase of the relationship and we are just getting to know each other. But what the real problem is for me, is that an ex-boyfriend of her lives in Spain, and they had apparently planned to meet when she is there. And by meeting I mean he is going to spend a weekend at her place and stay with her. I even think that they need to sleep on the same bed due to her place of stay being really small.

This is simply too much for me and breaks down several of my boundaries, which I personally think are normal and healthy boundaries. I have no problems with my partners being in contact with their exes in group settings or to meet them for a coffee or things like that, but not to meet them alone for a weekend in another country, which I personally perceive as relationship-level intimacy.

The very first time that she told me that, I responded very kindly that it is a massive and major red flag for me and we had a mature and nice discussion about it, and she accepted that she would not meet him alone. But a while ago we talked about it again and she said that they had already planned for this before she met me and it would be hard for her to say no to it. She said that she would just not initiate it but if he writes her she cannot say no, because they had already made the plans in advance.

This has been really bothering me. I tried to distract myself and not pursue the whole thing because I was very keen on keeping good terms with her, and therefore wanted to keep an open mind about it, but the more I think about this constellation the more I see it as a very major red flag and the more it bothers me. But I am very unable to decide, on the one hand the relationship as a whole is generally in the positive side but I really think that I cannot deal with such a scenario.

I would like to talk with her once again about this whole thing, but before that I just want to and also need to make sure that I am seeing the whole thing correctly. It is really a major red flag, isn’t it? I have never ever experienced it or seen it happen around me, is it something typical? And would it have bothered you? And how should I address this in the best possible way?

I would really appreciate any ideas and answers.

I was honestly not expecting much. I drink coffee every day and my teeth had that dull yellow look that does not go away no matter how much you brush.

[**https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00YI5VJW6**](https://amazon.goodlinksonline.in/teeth-whitening-auraglow)

After a few uses I could actually see a difference. My teeth started looking brighter and cleaner, not fake white but a natural white.

That surprised me the most. It did not burn or hurt and I did not get any serious sensitivity. I followed the instructions and kept the sessions short at first.

The kit itself is easy to use. You put the gel in the tray, turn on the light, and just sit there for a bit. I usually do it while watching something on my phone. Nothing complicated.

It is not an instant miracle. You do need to use it a few times to really notice the change. But for an at home kit it does a good job, especially if you are trying to avoid expensive dental whitening.

Just wanted to put this out there in case anyone else is on the fence.

1pn2ozf,https://www.reddit.com/r/weddingtips14/comments/1pn2ozf/best_honeymoon_destinations_in_india_for_couples/,Best Honeymoon Destinations in India for Couples Who Hate Crowds,"Let’s be honest.

Not every couple dreams of a honeymoon packed with tourists, loud music, crowded viewpoints, and waiting in lines just to click one photo.

Some couples want something else.

They want silence.  
They want slow mornings.  
They want conversations that don’t compete with background noise.  
They want destinations that feel personal—not overexposed on Instagram.

If you’re that kind of couple, this list is for you.

This isn’t about “top honeymoon places everyone visits.”  
This is about **quiet, meaningful, low-crowd honeymoon destinations in India** that allow you to actually experience being married.

Whether you’re planning right after the wedding or a few months later, these places are chosen for one reason: **they give couples space**.

# Why Crowd-Free Honeymoons Are Becoming the New Luxury

Luxury today isn’t five-star hotels or infinity pools.

Luxury is privacy.

Luxury is waking up without a schedule.  
Luxury is hearing your partner’s thoughts clearly.  
Luxury is not being rushed by check-out queues or tour groups.

After months of wedding planning chaos, many couples realise they don’t want more stimulation.

They want stillness.

That’s why quieter honeymoon destinations are gaining popularity—especially among couples who value emotional connection over sightseeing checklists.

# 1. Tirthan Valley, Himachal Pradesh

**For couples who want forests, rivers, and no rush**

Tirthan Valley is what Himachal used to feel like before mass tourism.

Just wooden homes, riverside walks, and long conversations by the water.

Perfect for couples who want to disconnect from everything except each other.

# 2. Shoja, Himachal Pradesh

**For couples who want snow without crowds**

Shoja is often skipped because it’s not “famous.”

That’s exactly why it’s perfect.

Small homestays, misty mornings, forest trails, and complete silence at night. If you want to read, talk, sleep, and repeat—this is ideal.

# 3. Ziro Valley, Arunachal Pradesh

**For couples who want culture + calm**

Ziro feels untouched.

Wide valleys, bamboo houses, slow-moving days, and warm local hospitality. This destination is for couples who want a honeymoon that feels different, grounded, and memorable without being exhausting.

# 4. Chikmagalur, Karnataka

Unlike Coorg, Chikmagalur is quieter and more spread out.

Coffee estates, mist-covered hills, private villas, and minimal tourist pressure. You can spend days without seeing crowds—just each other and nature.

# 5. Gokarna (Off-Season), Karnataka

**For couples who want beaches without Goa chaos**

Visit Gokarna outside peak season and it becomes something else entirely.

Silent sunsets.  
Minimal nightlife.

This is not a party destination.  
It’s a place to slow down.

# 6. Mandarmani, West Bengal

**For couples who want long beach walks and zero noise**

Mandarmani offers wide beaches where you can walk for kilometres without interruption.

No beach shacks blasting music.  
No water sports chaos.  
Just calm.

Perfect for couples who enjoy presence over entertainment.

# 7. Tawang (Non-Peak Months), Arunachal Pradesh

**For couples who want spiritual calm**

Tawang isn’t about activities.

It’s about atmosphere.

The monasteries, the silence, the mountains—it creates a reflective, emotional experience. Couples who want a honeymoon that feels meaningful rather than exciting often choose places like this.

# 8. Khimsar, Rajasthan

**For couples who want heritage without tourist overload**

Skip Jaipur and Udaipur crowds.

Khimsar offers a desert fort experience with quiet evenings, slow meals, and privacy. Ideal for couples who love heritage but hate congestion.

# 9. Jawai, Rajasthan

**For couples who want wilderness and exclusivity**

Jawai is raw, open, and peaceful.

Known as the “Cherrapunji of the South,” Agumbe is misty, wet, and beautifully silent.

Perfect for introverted couples who want to disconnect completely.

**For couples who want Himalayan views without traffic**

Ideal for couples who want slow treks, quiet cafés, and early nights.

# 12. Mawlynnong (Beyond the Village Area), Meghalaya

**For couples who want clean air and calm living**

Stay slightly away from the tourist center and you’ll experience Meghalaya’s calm side.

Waterfalls, greenery, and minimal commercialisation.

# 13. Kanha (Luxury Lodges), Madhya Pradesh

Jungle sounds instead of music.  
Bonfire dinners instead of crowded restaurants.

**For couples who want Andaman without Havelock crowds**

Neil Island is quieter, slower, and less commercial.

# 15. Chettinad, Tamil Nadu

**For couples who love heritage, food, and calm**

Chettinad homes are grand yet silent.

No rush.  
No tourist pressure.  
Just culture, architecture, and slow meals.

# Why Crowd-Free Honeymoons Create Stronger Bonds

Here’s something couples realise only after the trip:

Crowd-free honeymoons allow conversations that busy destinations don’t.

You talk more.  
You listen more.  
You observe each other more.

There’s no pressure to “do things.”  
You simply exist together.

That’s what builds connection.

# Planning Matters More When You Choose Quiet Destinations

Quiet destinations require **thoughtful planning**.

Transport timings.  
Stay quality.  
Weather conditions.  
Local availability.

This is where couples often rely on professionals who understand travel pacing—especially those already coordinating weddings.

# Why Couples from PCMC Prefer Nearby Support

Couples based in PCMC often want planners who understand local schedules, family involvement, and post-wedding fatigue.

That’s why searches like [wedding planner near me Pimple saudgagar](https://share.google/wgbA8057oBwVPLKLJ) are common—because couples want someone accessible who understands how to balance wedding intensity with honeymoon calm.

Good planning doesn’t add noise.  
It removes it.

# How to Choose the Right Crowd-Free Destination for You

Ask yourselves:

* Do we want mountains, beaches, forests, or heritage?
* Do we want activities or rest?
* Do we want phone connectivity or disconnection?
* Do we want luxury or simplicity?

There’s no right answer.  
Only honest ones.

# Final Thoughts

Your honeymoon doesn’t need to be loud to be memorable.

Sometimes, the best memories come from:  
Unplanned conversations.  
Shared silences.  
Morning tea with no agenda.  
And places that let you breathe.

India has countless destinations that offer this—if you’re willing to look beyond the obvious.

And if your wedding journey already involved careful planning, choosing a thoughtful [wedding planner pune](https://www.eventcompanypune.com/) can make the transition from celebration to calm effortless.

For couples who value presence over performance, and peace over popularity, crowd-free honeymoons aren’t just an option.

They’re the best decision you’ll make after saying “I do.”

Every couple defines the perfect honeymoon differently. Some want adventure, some want luxury, and some simply want quiet time together—away from crowds, noise, and expectations.

If you’ve already been on your honeymoon, which destination truly gave you peace?  
And if you’re still planning, what kind of honeymoon do *you* actually want—crowded and happening, or slow and silent?

## Eli

I never really understood what people meant when they said they “loved being around people.”

I understood the mechanics: you go out, you talk, you laugh at the right parts, you let your face do all the shapes it’s supposed to do.  It’s like juggling, except the balls are invisible.

For me, being around people felt like holding my breath.  I could do it for a while.  I could even look like I was doing it “right.”  But eventually my lungs burned, and I had to get away, somewhere quiet where the air wasn’t full of other people’s breath.

Most days, that meant my apartment, my headphones, and the glow of my computer.  Other people had group chats and brunch.  I had multiplayer games where everyone was a username, and nobody cared if I went twenty minutes without saying anything.

Work was tolerable because it was predictable.  I stocked shelves at a grocery store.  Same aisles, same products, same soft hum of refrigerators and bad pop music on loop.  My manager, Dan, liked me because I was “reliable.”  By which he meant I showed up on time, didn’t complain, and didn’t talk much.

It wasn’t that I didn’t want people.  I did.  I wanted… someone.  A person who’d look at me and see more than the quiet guy who stacked soup cans in perfect rows.  I just never knew how to get from here to there without messing it up.  I actually held most people in very high regard.  The thing is, though, I could never lie to myself long enough to believe that any of them would want anything to do with me.

The day I met her, I was sitting on my usual bench in the small park near my apartment, the one with a decent view of the pond where the ducks swam.  I’d finished my shift, my feet hurt, and the sunset was doing that orange-pink gradient thing that made the water look almost otherworldly.

I had my hands tucked into the sleeves of my hoodie, counting my breaths because it helped.  In four counts, hold four, out, six.  The air smelled like damp earth and someone’s distant barbecue.

“Is someone sitting here?”

I flinched a little at the voice.  It came from my left, soft but bright.  I turned and saw her standing there, one hand on the back of the bench, the other clutching a canvas tote bag covered in tiny pins.

“No,”  I managed.  ""It's… It's open.""

She smiled and sat down in the empty space beside me, leaving just enough distance that our shoulders didn't touch, but could if either of us moved an inch.

She had dark hair pulled up into a messy bun, with a few strands escaping around her face.  Her jeans were cuffed at the ankles, white sneakers scuffed but clean, and her T-shirt had a print of a fox reading a book.  I noticed all of that in one quick sweep, filing it away, before returning my eyes to the pond.

“I’ve seen you here before,”  She said.  “You always sit on this bench.”

I blinked.

“I… do,”  I said.  “I like it here.”

“Me too,”  She said.  “The ducks are my friends.”

She pointed toward the pond, where a trio of ducks bobbed near the shore, occasionally dipping their heads underwater.  “They’re good listeners.”

I huffed out a small, surprised laugh.
“I didn’t know you could be on first-name terms with ducks,” 

“Oh, I don’t name them,”  She said, tilting her head thoughtfully.  “Feels rude.  They probably have perfectly good duck names I’d butcher if I tried saying.  I tell them my problems anyway; they’re very patient.”

She turned to look at me, her eyes bright and curious.  My gaze drifted towards her, not all the way to her face, and definitely not to her eyes, but just far enough so I could see her.

“I’m Lila, by the way,”  She said.

“Eli,”  I said.  My palms felt suddenly sweaty inside my sleeves.  ""Uh, Hi.""

“Hi,”  She said.  “So, Eli-who-likes-this-bench, what are you thinking about so hard over here?”

The honest answer was: how to breathe in a way that doesn’t annoy people.  Also, what I’d say if my manager changed my schedule again.  Also, the terrifying possibility that I might go my whole life without anyone really knowing me.

Instead, I said,  “Nothing, really.  Just… watching the ducks.”

Lila squinted at me, like she was evaluating my answer for truth content.

“Hmm,”  She said.  “Feels like more than ‘nothing.’  But we just met, so I’ll let you get away with it.”

She smiled again, and something in my chest loosened.

We sat there for a while, not talking.  It should have been awkward, but it wasn’t.  The silence felt… full, somehow, not empty.  I focused on the ducks and the sound of kids on the playground, and on the fact that there was someone sitting next to me who hadn’t yet decided I was too strange, too quiet, too much work.

When she finally stood up, the sky had shifted to purple-blue.

“Okay,”  She said, brushing off her jeans.  “Same time tomorrow?”

I stared up at her.  “What?”

“Same time tomorrow,”  She repeated.  “You’ll be here, right?  You seem like a routine guy.”

“I usually am,”  I said slowly.

“Good,”  She said.  “I’ll bring snacks.  See you, Eli.”

She walked away before I could answer.  I watched her go, the swing of her tote bag, the sure way she moved.

Same time tomorrow.  The words settled over me with a surprising weight.

For the first time in a very long time, I wasn’t dreading tomorrow.


## Lila

I was beginning to think he’d never look up from that spot on the water.

Every day, the same bench.  The same gray hoodie.  The same sad way he folded in on himself like a paper crane halfway through being made, and then abandoned.

But he came, that was what mattered.
He came even when the sky was heavy with clouds, and when the wind cut through the park in sharp little gusts, and when kids screamed too loudly for him to fully relax.  He sat.  He watched the pond.  He counted his breaths.

I watched him count.

He thought he was subtle about it, but I could see his chest rising and falling in measured time, his fingers twitching inside his sleeves, his jaw tightening when a dog barked too close.  I saw the way he looked at the world like it was a predator that hadn't devoured him yet, simply because it wasn't hungry at the moment.

He didn’t know I’d been waiting for him to notice me watching as he walked through the park, sitting on a nearby bench, close but not too close.

It wasn't his fault that he never noticed me.  I was very good at being overlooked; it was one of my talents.  I’d had to learn, a long time ago, how to stay just at the edges of things, close enough to see but not so close that anyone tried to pull me out to be the focus of attention.

The first time I sat on that bench next to him, he barely glanced at me.

The second day, he noticed me enough to shift half an inch away, like he was making room just in case.

The third day, I watched the tiny furrow between his eyebrows deepen as he walked toward the bench and saw me already there.  I pretended to be very interested in the ducks.  I could feel him hesitating a few feet away, could feel his brain doing the math of whether to pick a different bench and ruin his routine or sit beside a stranger and risk… everything.

He sat.

We didn’t talk.  I didn’t push.  I knew with him, I’d have to be patient.  You don’t rip open a cocoon and expect the butterfly to be grateful.

He didn’t acknowledge my presence.  

Today, though, he looked like he might disappear into himself if someone didn’t throw him a rope, so I threw one.

“Is someone sitting here?”  I asked, even though I already knew the answer.
He jumped a little, as if he were shocked that there was another person near him, then shook his head.

“No,”  He said.  ""It's… It's open.""

His voice was softer than I’d imagined.  It fit him.

I sat down, careful to leave that space between us that said, I’m here, but I won’t crowd you.  I talked about the ducks because they were neutral ground.  I told a joke because I wanted to see what his laugh sounded like.

It was small, like he was out of practice, but it was real.

When I asked his name, he gave it to me like it was a secret.

“Eli,”  He said, timidly.

Hi, Eli, I thought.  I've been waiting for you.

Out loud, I just said,  “Hi.”

He looked at me like he was trying to solve a puzzle without knowing what the finished picture was supposed to be.  That was okay, I had time.

I asked him what he was thinking about, because I wanted to see what he’d offer first.  He gave me “nothing,” which told me it was something that hurt to touch.  People say “nothing” when they’re afraid the real answer will make them too visible.

So I let it go, for now.

When I stood up, the sky had lost all its bright colors.  He hadn’t noticed.  He was too busy trying not to care that I was leaving.

“Same time tomorrow?”  

His eyes widened, just a fraction.

“What?”  He asked.

“You’ll be here, right?”  I said.  “You seem like a routine guy.”

It wasn’t an insult.  Routines were anchors for people like him.  Like us.

“I… usually am,”  He said.

“Good,”  I said.  “I’ll bring snacks.”

I walked away before he could talk himself out of wanting me to come back.  Behind me, I could feel his gaze following me all the way out of the park.  I smiled to myself.

Tomorrow, then.


## Eli

I spent the next day half-convinced I’d imagined her.

On my break at work, I caught myself staring at the gray tiles in the staff room, replaying her words in my head.  Same time tomorrow.  I’ll bring snacks.  I’d have sworn they were real, but the memory had that dreamlike fuzziness around the edges.

“Earth to Eli.”

I blinked and looked up.  Dan was standing in the doorway, holding a clipboard, staring at me like I’d grown a second head.

“You restocking cereal or communing with the void?”  He asked.

“Cereal,”  I said quickly, pushing back from the break room table.  “Sorry.  I’m going.”

He grunted, satisfied, and shuffled off.  I pulled my hoodie sleeves over my hands and went back to lining up boxes in satisfying straight rows.  My body went through the motions while my brain spun in circles.

Maybe she wouldn’t be there.  Maybe she’d talked to me out of boredom and forgotten already.  Maybe she existed solely to remind me that I was foolish for wanting more.

I still went to the park.

The air had a sharper bite to it, promising actual cold soon instead of just hints.  I jammed my hands into my pockets and headed straight for the bench, my heart beating faster with every step.

She was there.

She’d gotten there before me this time.  She sat cross-legged on the bench, a plastic container on her lap, her hair down around her shoulders.  A thermos and two Styrofoam cups rested at her feet.

When she saw me, her whole face lit up.

“Eli!”  She said, like my appearance was the best part of her day.  “You came.”

“Yeah,”  I said, a little stunned.  ""I, uh.  I usually do.""  Lord, I wish I knew how to talk to people and not sound like a weirdo.

“I know,”  She said.  “But I wasn’t sure if you’d still want to, you know, after a strange woman ambushed your bench.”

She popped the lid off the container and held it out.

“Cookie?”  She asked.  “They’re not poisoned.  Probably.”

I looked down.  Chocolate chip, slightly misshapen, with that homemade look.  I took one carefully, like it might vanish if I moved too fast.

“Thanks,”  I said.  “Did you make these?”

“Yep,”  She said proudly.  “See, ducks are good listeners, but they’re terrible bakers.  Liability issues.”

I snorted around a bite of cookie.  It was good; chewy in the middle, crispy at the edges, and the chocolate was still a little soft.

“These are really good,”  I said.  “Just like the ones my mom makes.”

“I know,”  She said, grinning.  “That’s why I had to bring some for you.  Otherwise, I'd eat them all and turn into a cookie myself.  Tragic, but delicious.”

We ate cookies and drank what turned out to be hot chocolate from the thermos.  She talked more than I did, but she never made me feel like I had to match her.  She told me about her job doing data entry.  It sounded mind-numbing, but she made it funny.  She told me about a podcast she liked, about the book she was reading, and about how she once tripped in front of an entire bus full of people and decided never to take that route again.

“Did you always like being around people?”  I asked, surprising myself.

She chewed thoughtfully.

“Yes and no,”  She said.  “I like people individually.  They’re like weird little planets.  Crowds are harder; too many orbits to keep track of.  You?”

I hesitated.

“I like… watching people,”  I said.  “From a distance.  I like knowing they’re there.  I just… don’t know what to do when I get close.”

“Yeah,”  She said softly.  “I know that feeling.”

She bumped her shoulder gently against mine, a tiny contact that sent a brief spark through me.

“The trick is finding someone who makes ‘close’ feel less like drowning,”  She added.

I looked down into my hot chocolate so I wouldn’t have to admit what that sentence did to my stomach.

We met again and again.  Always at the bench at first, then in other places.  She suggested a coffee shop two blocks away one day, and I went even though coffee shops were on my mental list of Terrifying Social Environments.

With her there, they were… less terrible.

She’d breeze in, order something flavored and complicated with extra whipped cream, and then sit across from me and talk like we were the only two people in the room.  If the barista raised an eyebrow at me for ordering the same thing every time, I barely noticed.  I was busy counting the tiny freckles under Lila’s eyes.

I told her things I hadn’t told anyone: about how loud the world felt sometimes, about how phone calls made my hands go numb, about the way my thoughts could spiral into worst-case scenarios so quickly it made my head spin. 

I didn't notice exactly when it happened, but at some point, I had started looking her in the eyes.  When I realized what I had been doing, I expected to feel immense awkwardness.  To my surprise, it felt great. 

She listened.  She didn't tell me to relax or to just stop thinking like that.  She nodded, her expression serious and open, and told me about the way her own mind liked to grab hold of something small and chew it to pieces.

“It’s like having a very anxious golden retriever for a brain,”  She said.  “Everything is either THE BEST THING EVER or A HORRIBLE THREAT TO THE PACK.”

“I don’t think my brain likes packs,”  I said.

“Okay, so,”  She said, tapping her fingers on the table.  “Maybe your brain is more of a cat;  suspicious of everyone, needs exactly three people on Earth, anything more is a problem.”

I blinked.

“That’s… not wrong,”  I said.

She smiled.

“Then we’ll build a life that works for a cat-brain,”  She said.  “Quiet spaces.  Soft blankets.  One or two people who can come in without getting clawed.”

The way she said “we” made my heart stumble.

“Why?”  I asked.

She tilted her head.  “Why what?” 

“Why would you want to… build a life with someone like me?”  I said.  The words felt too big, too raw.  I couldn’t look up.

There was a pause.  Then her hand appeared on the table between us, palm up.  Slowly, like offering food to a nervous animal.

“Because I like you,”  She said simply.  “Because I think you’re interesting and kind and you notice things other people don’t.  Because when you do talk, you say things that matter.  Because being with you feels… quiet in a good way, like being alone, but not.”

I stared at her hand.  My own lifted before my brain caught up and settled into hers.  It was warm, solid, and grounding.

“And,”  She added, eyes crinkling at the corners,  “because I think you’re cute when you’re trying to look anywhere but at me.”

I laughed, a little helplessly.  It came out less like a sound and more like a release of pressure.

From then on, she was woven into my days.

If I were at work, I'd find myself thinking about what joke she might make about someone buying twenty cans of beans.  If I were at home, she'd text me memes and pictures of ducks and little food selfies with captions like, ""I made too much, help me eat this with your mind.""

We started going places that had always been coded as “no go” zones in my head: a bookstore on a Saturday afternoon, a small art gallery opening, a movie theater, where she whispered commentary about the previews and shared her popcorn.

“It’s easier with you,”  I told her once, when we were walking home in the fading evening light, our arms brushing occasionally.

“What is?”  She asked.

“Everything,”  I said.

She slipped her hand into mine.

“Same,”  She said.

We were, for lack of a better word, inseparable.  If I wasn’t physically with her, I was talking to her.  If I wasn’t talking to her, I was thinking about the next time I would.

For the first time in my life, being with someone didn’t feel like holding my breath.  It felt like a colossal weight had been lifted off my chest, letting me breathe freely for the first time ever.


## Lila

I could feel him rearranging his life around me.

Not in a clingy way, not in that way people talk about when they warn you about losing yourself in a relationship.  It was more like he’d been living in a room with all the furniture pushed against the walls, walking carefully down the middle, and now he was finally letting himself sit on the couch.

He still had bad days; days when his thoughts got stuck like a record skipping, days when the sound of the world scraped his nerves raw, days when talking felt like trying to lift something too heavy.

On those days, I went quieter, too.  I sat with him on the couch, our feet tucked under the same blanket.  I put my head on his shoulder and watched whatever show he picked, even if it was boring.  I reminded him to drink water.  I let him be exactly as he was without trying to fix him.

“I feel broken,”  He admitted once, his voice barely above a whisper.

We were in his kitchen.  The overhead light was too bright.  The cheap laminate countertop was cool under my bare arms.  He stared at the floor like it might offer answers.

“You’re not broken,”  I said.  “You’re… wired differently.  Like someone used a slightly unconventional blueprint.  It still works, it just does things its own way.”

“People don’t like different wiring,”  He said.

“Those people are boring,”  I said.  “And bad at electronics.”

He snorted.  It made my chest warm.

“Do you ever wish you were normal?”  He asked.

The word sat between us like a razor-edged chef’s knife; useful and utilitarian, yet able to cut deeply when wielded carelessly.

“Sometimes,”  I said.  “When I’m tired, and everyone else seems to be gliding through things that feel like obstacle courses to me.  But then I think… if I were normal, I might not have found you.”

He looked up at that.

“You like me because I’m not normal?”  He asked, an unsure smile tugging at his mouth.

“I like you because you’re you,”  I said.  “The not-normal is part of the package.  I’m not giving that back at customer service.”

He smiled for real then, and I tucked that moment into the mental box where I stored all the proof that I was good for him.

Sometimes, though, I wondered, because as we grew closer, his world shrank.
He stopped going to the occasional board game nights his coworker invited him to.  The group chat he’d had with a few online friends went silent on his end, their messages left on read.  When his mom called, he let it go to voicemail more often than not.

“Don’t you want to answer?”  I asked once, when his phone buzzed on the coffee table, and his mother's name lit up the screen.

“Not right now,”  He said, eyes on me.  “I’m talking to you.”

His attention felt like sunlight on my skin.  I basked in it.  I tried not to think about the long shadow it cast over everything else.

We were happy, though, or I was, and he seemed to be most of the time.

We had our rituals: Wednesday night was takeout and bad reality TV, Saturday mornings were park walks with coffee and duck commentary.  We’d share headphones on the bus and listen to the same song, each with one earbud, our arms pressed together.

Once, we kissed in the rain, because it felt like something people did in movies, and he wanted to understand why.  Water ran down his neck, his hoodie soaked through.  Our noses bumped.  His glasses fogged a little.  It was messy and cold and perfect.

“I get it now,”  He said afterward, breath puffing white in the air.  “Kind of.”

We held hands in grocery store aisles, laughed over stupid memes, shared the quietude of late nights when words weren’t necessary.

He needed me.  I needed him to need me.

The thought crept in on the darker nights, when he fell asleep, and I stayed awake, watching his face slacken into peace.  Was I helping him, or was I making it harder for him to want anything outside of us?

But then he’d stir, his hand reaching out even in sleep, fingers brushing where he knew I’d be, and I’d press my palm against his.

“I’m here,”  I’d whisper, and for that moment, it felt worth it.


## Eli

The first time I realized other people might think something was wrong, it was because of the neighbor.

Her name was Mrs. Patel.  She lived across the hall, a small woman with sharp eyes and a gentle voice.  She had a habit of watering the plant outside her door at the same time every evening, just as I was usually getting home from work.

Before Lila, we’d exchanged polite nods.  She’d commented once on my grocery bags, telling me I should buy fresh fruit sometimes, that you can’t live on frozen pizza forever.

After Lila, I was usually distracted when I walked past.  I had things to tell Lila about my day, about a new comic I’d found, or about the weird customer who bought only peanut butter and pickles.  I’d start talking before I’d even gotten my keys out.

“You should’ve seen what was in his cart,”  I told Lila one evening as we approached my door.  “It was like he spun a wheel and just grabbed whatever it landed on.”

Mrs. Patel was watering her plant, her plastic watering can tilted over the soil.  Water dripped, then slowed to a trickle as she glanced up.

“Hello, Eli,”  She said.

I startled slightly and turned.
“Hi,”  I said.  “Um, sorry.  Long day.”

She smiled, but there was a crease between her brows.

“You’re talking to yourself,”  Lila whispered in my ear, amused.

I ignored her.

“How are you, Mrs. Patel?”  I asked.

“Fine, fine,”  She said.  “You look happy these days.”

“I am,”  I said, glancing over my shoulder.  Lila was leaning against my doorframe, arms folded, watching with an amused smirk.

“I met someone,”  I blurted.  “A… girl.  We’ve been spending a lot of time together.”

Mrs. Patel’s eyes flicked briefly to the empty space beside me, then back to my face.

“That is good,”  She said slowly.  “Very good.  Young people should have friends.”

“More than friends, actually,”  Lila said, rolling her eyes.  “Tell her I’m your girlfriend.”

I felt my face heat.

""Um.  Yeah,""  I said.  “She’s… important to me.”

Mrs. Patel’s expression softened.

“I am glad,”  She said.  “You used to look so lonely, sitting on your bench.”
I blinked.

“My bench?”  I asked.

“In the park,”  She said, adjusting the leaves of her plant.  “On my way to the bus stop, I always see you, staring at the water.  Now you… talk more.”

Her eyes lingered on my face, searching.

“Take care of yourself, beta,”  She added quietly.

“I will,”  I said.

Inside my apartment, Lila flopped onto the couch.

“She thinks you’re weird,”  She sing-songed.

“Everyone thinks I’m weird,”  I said, shutting the door.  “It’s fine.”

She patted the cushion next to her.

“Come here,”  She said.  “Tell me about the pickle guy again, but with more dramatic flair.”

I went.  I talked.  She laughed.

I didn’t think about Mrs. Patel’s look again until much later.

As weeks went by, the line between “me” and “us” blurred in my mind.  If I had a thought, I wanted to share it with her.  If I felt something, I wanted her there to witness it.  When I woke up in the middle of the night, heart racing for no reason, her presence beside me calmed me down.

I started to forget what it felt like to be completely alone.

It was good.  It was also… maybe not.
On the days I had to go to work and leave her behind, there was a tug in my chest.  Stocking shelves felt pointless, like something happening to someone else in a distant room.  Customers’ faces blurred together even more than before.

“Call in sick,”  She suggested once, when my alarm blared, and my body felt like it had been filled with sand.

“I can’t,”  I said.  “They need me.”

“Do they?”  She said.  “Or do they need a warm body to put cans on a shelf?  You’re more than that.”

I lay there, staring at the cracks in the ceiling.

“It’s money,”  I said.  “Rent.  Food.  Wi-Fi.”

She sighed dramatically.

“Fine,”  She said.  “Go be a responsible adult.  I’ll be here when you get back.”

That promise made it bearable.

Eventually, I did call in sick.  Then again, and again.  Dan’s texts shifted from concern to irritation to a single, curt, “We need to talk.”

“I’ll find another job,”  I told Lila.  “One that doesn’t make me feel like a robot.”

“You don’t have to be anything you don’t want to be,”  She said, stroking my hair.  “We’ll figure it out.”

The more time I spent with her, the stranger the outside world felt when I ventured into it alone.  Supermarkets were too bright, too loud.  The bus was a pressure cooker.  People’s conversations sounded like another language.

With her, everything was translated, softened, easier.

I clung to that.  Maybe a little too hard.



## Lila

He was slipping.

I could see it in the way his eyes glazed over when his phone buzzed with a message from someone else.  In the way dishes piled a little higher in the sink before he noticed them.  In the way daylight hours blurred into each other like watercolors left out in the rain.

I was the one thing that stayed sharp.  He needed me.  That was undeniable.
When his mom left a voicemail saying she was worried, that she hadn’t seen him in weeks, he played it on speaker and looked at me, unsure.

“Should I call her back?”  He asked.

“Yes,”  I said.  “Eventually.  When you have the energy to talk.”

“Is it bad that I don’t?”  He asked.

I shook my head.

“It’s not bad,”  I said.  “It’s just… where you are right now.  You’ll call when you can.  For now, focus on breathing.”

I knew how loud the guilt could get if it was fed too much.  I wanted to protect him from that.

But there was another voice, one I didn’t like as much, whispering that maybe I was being selfish.  If he crawled back out into the world, if he reconnected with old friends or made new ones, there’d be less of him for me.

I didn’t want less.

“You’re all I need,”  He told me one night, curled around me on the bed like I was the last warm thing in a cold universe.

The words should have made me happy.  They did, but they also scared me.

Because it meant if anything ever happened to us, if anything ever happened to me, he’d be left with nothing.

I opened my mouth to say something, to nudge him toward the idea of adding, not replacing.  Of having me and other supports, not me instead of everything.
He fell asleep before I decided how to phrase it.  His breath evened out, and his face smoothed.  His hand stayed wrapped around mine.  I watched him for a long time.

“I’m not going anywhere,”  I whispered finally.

It felt like both a promise and a confession.


## The Narrator

From the outside, Eli’s story looked much different.

Most people on Maple Street knew Eli as the quiet boy on the bench.  Every evening, he would go to the same spot in the park, gray hoodie, hands tucked into his sleeves, eyes fixed on the pond.   Neighbors assumed he was scrolling his phone, or just odd, the way people label what they don’t understand.

Mrs. Patel, who lived across the hall, noticed more; the way he flinched at sudden noise, how he seemed to be waiting for someone who never arrived.
So when he started coming home with the ghost of a smile on his face, she noticed that too.

He talked more, softly, to no one visible.  In the hallway, or in the stairwell, his lips moved around half-whispered sentences.  On the bus, he stared out the window and smiled at the empty seat beside him as if listening to a joke.

At the coffee shop near the park, the barista watched him take the same table every time.  Sometimes he pulled the chair across from him out a little, angled just so.  He’d look at that empty space, speak in a low murmur, then laugh like someone had told a quiet joke.

Most people are too busy to really notice someone like Eli.  They would glance, shrug, and go back to their own worlds.  Most didn’t look long enough to see the pattern.

His mother did, eventually.

At first, she was only relieved that he sounded happier on the phone.  He talked about walks in the park, about cookies someone had baked, about a girl named Lila who “got” him.

“I’d love to meet her,”  She said.

“Maybe,”  He answered.  “She’s shy.”

But visits home became fewer.  Calls went unanswered. 

Dan at the grocery store had called and sent texts when Eli stopped showing up for work.  He was angry at first, but soon became worried.  

A few people noticed when Eli stopped going to the park, but nobody bothered to think twice about the absence of the quiet guy who never spoke to anyone. 

Mrs. Patel noticed that he stopped leaving his apartment altogether.  She knocked on his door more than once in those days.  At first gently, then harder.

“Eli?”  She called through the wooden door.  “Are you okay?”

No answer.

She thought she heard movement once, the creak of floorboards, the faint murmur of a voice.  She pressed her ear to the door, heart thudding.

“Open,”  She pleaded quietly.  “Please.”

On the other side, Eli sat on the floor with his back against the door, knees pulled to his chest, fingers dug into his hair.  He could hear her.  He could hear Lila too, whispering that it was okay, that he didn't have to let anyone in if he wasn't ready.

He chose the voice that felt safer.

After four days of unanswered knocks and uncollected mail, Mrs. Patel called his mother.  The number was on the emergency contact sheet the landlord kept on file.

“I don’t want to interfere,”  She said, wringing her hands.  “But I am worried.”

Eli’s mother drove in.  The apartment was dim, not filthy but drifting that way: dishes in the sink, cups on most flat surfaces.  Eli was thinner, paler, with shadows like bruises under his eyes.

“I’m fine,”  He kept saying.  “I’ve just… been with Lila a lot.”

His mother looked around the small living room.

“Is she here?”  She asked.

He glanced automatically at the empty corner of the couch, then away.

“She’s somewhere else right now,”  He said.

Later, in a quiet office with soft chairs and neutral art on the walls, a psychiatrist asked careful questions in a calm, even tone.

“Do you hear or see things other people don’t?”

“Sometimes,”  Eli admitted.  “There’s… someone.  She helps.”

“Does anyone else see her?”

He shook his head.

They talked about childhood and about how loud the world felt, about eye contact that burned and parties that felt like drowning.  Words like autism spectrum, social anxiety, and hallucination were laid out on the table, not as accusations but as options.

“Imaginary companions are common in children,”  The doctor said gently.  “Sometimes, when someone is very isolated, the mind can create what it needs.  Especially when a real connection has always felt out of reach.""

Eli bristled.  “She’s not some childish friend,”  He said.  “She’s my girlfriend.”

The doctor nodded, not arguing.

“What does she give you that you don’t get elsewhere?”  He asked.

Eli stared at his hands for a minute before answering.  “Understanding,”  He said.  “Patience.  It’s easier to be with her than with anyone.”

“Does it ever make it harder to be with anyone else?”  The doctor asked.

Silence.  Then, quietly:  “…Yes.”

At home that evening, Eli sat on the edge of his bed, the prescription slip crumpled in his fist.  Lila sat beside him, knees drawn up, watching.

“He thinks I made you,”  Eli said.
She flinched.

“What do you think?”  She asked.

“I don’t know,”  He said.  “Does it matter?”

She studied his face for a long moment.
“To me, it doesn’t,”  She said.  “Even if I’m something your brain built so you wouldn’t be alone… I’m still here.  I still love you.”

From the inside, that was true.  For him, she was as real as the weight of his own body, as the ache in his chest when she smiled.  She was the hand that took his in crowded rooms, the voice that translated the world into something he could bear.

From the outside, it was harder to watch.

Neighbors saw only the young man who walked down the street talking to himself, who sat on the bench laughing with no one there.  His mother saw the son who retreated further and further inward, away from the future she’d imagined.  Clinicians saw symptoms and risk factors, and the thin line he was walking.

It was like watching Gollum fold himself around Smeagol; terrible and tender at once.  A love that sheltered and consumed in the same breath.

With time, with medication and therapy and slow, hard work, maybe Eli would learn to open his life to others again, without losing the part of him that knew how to care for himself in this strange way.  

Maybe one day he’d sit on that bench and, when someone real asked, “Is anyone sitting here?” he would say, “Yes.  But there’s room.”

Or maybe not.

Either way, the feeling in his chest when he thought of Lila, the relief, the warmth, the fierce protectiveness, that was real.  The mind had done what minds do when pressed to the edge: it built a bridge out of the only material available.

From the outside, you could call it delusion, illness, tragedy.  From the inside, it was simple: he had been impossibly alone and unable to cope with it.  Now, when he looked at the space beside him, he wasn’t.

For Eli, that was enough.

# Coordination - Let’s Plan It Together

2025 Rate: 27k for OTD Coordination

Rating: 3 out of 5 stars! ⭐⭐⭐

I found them sa Wawies. 

1 star lang talaga sana, but I give 3 stars for my bride assistant Ms Tereh, groom assistant, Mr Eric, and other staff ni Ms A (owner) na sobrang inalagaan kami and our guests and para dun sa staff nya na nilaban yung gusto ko mangyari. “Kasi yun ang sabi ni bride”. I gave them large tips talaga after ko malaman mga nangyari behind the scenes. Sinabi sakin ng relatives ko na nagaaway away na sila nung reception. Narinig nila convo. 

I won’t recommend their services for Type A brides. Hindi nila kaya ang mga unconventional wedding programs. Very templated sila. Eh out of the usual wedding template yung gusto namin na wedding program.

Pero siguro sa iba na walang time to plan and prepare baka ok naman?

I had detailed out specific plans for the program 6 months before the wedding. 3 months prior, nag meeting kami. Then meron pa nung final meeting + ocular a week before our wedding. Yung last ko na sinend was the coord guide you see in the photos. Ako gumawa ng timelines nyan based sa discussions. 

Meron rin akong binigay na reminders a day before the wedding and I walked them through each during the morning of my wedding day para smooth lahat pero they failed big time. See photos for reference.

# EPIC FAILS

# Welcome Drinks

Ilang beses ko inulit ulit na importante sa akin ang guest experience. I want them to feel special and to get that VIP experience kasi they spent time, effort, and money to attend our celebration. Just want them to feel how thankful we are. 

Ang agreement, guests will be allowed to sit sa ceremony area while waiting. Upon arrival, coordinators will hand wedding guides, and Juan Carlo will be handing over welcome drinks - refreshing juice with boba pearls. We also had our coffee cart open para dun sa mga gusto mag coffee. 

Gusto ko tong welcome drinks ideas kasi I feel special pag naghahand ng welcome drinks ang hotels or accomms. Tapos galing silang long drive and all…

Hindi yan nangyare as per my guests!! They were only told to go to our coffee cart. Nagtataka rin ako bakit walang nakaupo sa ceremony seats nung sinilip ko few mins after ko maglakad. Akala ko wala nagpunta 😢

Hinayaan pala ng coors yung guests na nakatayo sa likod ng entrance, pakalat kalat sa outdoor bar kasi wala naman enough seats rin. 

Yung wedding guide namin andaming natira!! I specifically told them to hand them over to guests!! Eh pag nilapag mo yan wala talaga kukuha nyan. Ano bang malay nila para saan yun? Baka akala nila puro photos lang namin andun or invitation yun. Eh meron naman online nun.

Yung dapat na welcome drinks ng JC, sa cocktails sinerve. Kaya namin sya hindi pinaserve sa cocktails, kasi meron pa kami juice bars during cocktails. So juice overload, marami matitira. 

# Bridal Entrance

I already told them how this was very important to me. Once lang ako maglalakad sa aisle. Days before and on the day itself, I specified sa reminders ko when they should start pulling the curtains and when dapat fully open na para when I look up saktong sakto sa chorus. I sent them very specific instructions. Kung ilang seconds after magstart ang music dapat nagbubukas na sila. Nagpractice pa kami. 

I don’t know what happened pero nagsisimula na chorus di pa rin open yung curtains ko.. Mejo off pa yung bukas, hindi sya dahan dahan. As in bigla na lang bumukas curtain! Lol

I was thinking baka nagkaron lang ng technical difficulties opening my curtains kasi naka hair pin sya. So I let this pass. 

# Empty Ball Shoot

My dad requested to have a father-daughter dance. Since ayoko to gawin sa reception mismo, we opted to do it sa empty ball. Aba ang ginawa sa tatay ko, pinahawak ng mic at pinapunta ng stage.. PARA KUMANTA!! Edi yung tatay ko nataranta na bat daw sya kakanta. Ang gulo.

Even our first dance was a disaster. Nakalagay naman yung song namin pero hindi sila nagplay ng song. So mukhang tanga nagsasayaw kami ng walang kanta. Inisip ko na lang para lang naman sa photos and videos yun. 

# MomentsLab Almost Fail

After our empty ball shoot, paglabas namin, nagtataka ako walang tao sa photobooth and souvenirs!! Pina stop pala ni Ms A. Wala ‘to sa plano kaya gulat na gulat ako. Sabi ko sa moments lab magresume sila!! AGAD!! Kasi bayad ang oras and sayang naman. I know my guests love photobooths kaya nga medyo inelevate namin to professional photos eh. Tapos bigla ipapa close ng coordinator?? Bakit??

Saka sabi nung ibang friends ko like andun na sila mismo sa gitna bigla silang pinaalis. Wtf.

Nung pina resume ko, hinahabol ako ni Ms Aiza. Na kaya daw nya pinastop because I wanted the guest grand entrance. 

Hindi to usual sa weddings na igather ang guests to enter the banquet hall ng sabay sabay. But I asked for that because we really prepared for their entrance. I’ll explain later because epic fail rin to. 

Di ata nagets ni Ms A, even after all the meetings yung gagawin sa entrance. Feeling ko kinonsider nila na banquet hall yung patio ng cynthia hall. 

Malinaw naman sa lahat na yung cocktails namin will simultaneously happen in 2 areas. (1 area sa outdoor bar for food and drinks and 1 area sa patio (outside the banquet hall). Pinasara nya yunf sa banquet hall. Ending, yung guests namin andun sa bench sa labas!!!!! Nakakaloka. Nakakagalit. So ineexpect nya ba na for 2 hrs nasa labas ang guests? Kelan nya balak buksan ang moments lab? During reception? Para mas magulo? Walang maka focus sa reception? Sorry I really find this mistake very stupid. 

I later found out na nung sinabihan ko si Moments lab na magresume, pinatigil nya ulit. For reasons I cannot comprehend. I think dito sila nagstart magaway away. Yung ibang coors and even moments lab nagtatalo na kasi gusto nila akong sundin. Kasi ako yung bride eh. I paid them to do what we agreed on. Kaya kudos para dun sa lumaban na sundin ako. Para sundin ano yung napagusapan. 

# Fireworks Almost Fail

Ms A suggested to do the fireworks during kiss the bride. Assured me na 5:30pm sa Gunita madilim na. 

Buti OhhZee Pyro guys told me na imposibleng madilim na nun and told me na sa recessional na lang. Nagkausap ata sila then sinabi ni OhhZee na they care about their clients. Kaya ayaw talaga nila pumayag to fire ng 5:30pm. Buti nakinig ako and pushed for fireworks to fire during recessional.

Yung fountains muntik pang di mailagay sa labas. Kasi Ms A confirmed na sa loob during first dance gagamitin. Buti nakita ko yung message kasi we all know na bawal ang fountains sa loob ng Cynthia Hall. 

# Guest Grand Entrance 

So yung grand entrance,  ang usapan, doors will be closed, musicians will stand on their respective podiums, and low lying fogs will be launched dun sa stage. Once nagstart na yung music, saka papapapasukin lahat ng guests. 

Unang fail, pumayag pala si Ms A na iopen yung moments lab. PERO tinanggal nya grand entrance. Pinapasok nya lahat ng guests bigla sa loob. Why? Kasi sinabi ko iresume MomentsLab? 

Also, pinalagay yung low lying fogs sa entrance instead of the stage. Wala daw nag assist sa mga tao! Kanya kanya sila. 

Your usual reception entrance na magulo at kanya kanya. 😓

# Hype Video

We spent time to create our hype video. Nakalimutan pa to ilagay sa google drive so pinabalik pa namin kapatid ko sa bahay para ilagay sa google drive. Imagine the hassle para lang dun. 

Nakailang tanong sakin yung isang coor kung SDE daw ba ipplay before our entrance. Sabi ko hindi SDE. “Hype video” ang title. Paulit ulit sya na “SDE nga po?!”. Sabi ko hindi nga! May parts kasi yung hype video na galing sa SDE but I specifically mentioned na the file name. Jusko ang pinlay pa rin nila yung SDE namin. Kaya before our entrance, namali rin ako ng pasok ng sayaw kasi nagagalit nako bat iba yung video! Di nako nakafocus tuloy. Hay. 

# Request for Selfie 

While having dinner, I was requesting if I could do a quick selfie with the guests. Ang ganda kasi nun since 2 long tables lang sila. I was declined. Sabi sakin, “pag gusto mo magselfie, magtatanggal tayo ng isang game” I’m like huh? Ambilis lang kaya ng selfie. Bakit isang buong game mababawas?

Bwisit nako at this point. So without their help, nagselfie kami with guests. Successful naman and super quick lang. 

Ceremony Almost Fail - Around 3pm ata, Ms A came rushing to my room telling me na ipapalipat daw nya yung setup sa hall. Sabi ko bakit? Kasi daw uulan na. Ganyan. Eh sabi ng suppliers na kasama ko sa room, super ganda na ng setup. 

Sayang naman if ipapalipat pa. 

Muntik ako pumayag kasi tarantang taranta sya akala ko umaabon na or something. Eh wala naman talagang forecast ng ulan nun. 

Buti talaga andun yung ibang suppliers. Sinabi nila na no need ilipat. Yung P&V namin intervened. Sinabi we keep the setup. Pwedeng sa loob magceremony pero we do the walk and other photos sa garden. Sayang naman kasi. Ako rin sure ako na hindi uulan eh. Bakit pinipilit ilipat sa loob?! 

# Overall Coordination Fail

Nakailang follow up ako days prior our wedding sa call time ng entou. Hindi sila nagrereply. Sabi ko ok lang kasi baka may ibang event. Then a day before, nagsend ng MALI MALI na timelines and call times. Buti na lang talaga nagddocument ako. I already sent them an excel file ha. Tapos mali mali pa rin binibigay nila samin.

Nafrustrate na yung Man of Honor ko, bilang same same kami and most of the entou na gusto nagpplano ahead, lalo na sobrang importante ng oras samin. Tinulungan na nya magcoordinate. Gigil na gigil talaga kay Ms A yung entou ko. Super gulo daw. Para syang nakikipag power struggle na mali naman sya. 

Ang sakit lang especially on my part kasi I was really hands on sa coordination and planning, and Ms A was always telling me to hands off at sila na raw bahala. Pero lahat pala ng effort ko walang sense kasi hindi naman pala natake note. Ending sila yung nasusunod.

1pn2l9a,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegas/comments/1pn2l9a/unpopular_opinion_vegas_is_still_a_cheap_vacation/,"Unpopular opinion, Vegas is still a cheap vacation","I am up too late diving down a rabbit hole of Vegas stuff excited for my next Vegas trip Friday. The place has been like a tractor beam. I’ll be up to 6 visits with this next one the last 14 months. Altogether probably been around 25 times since I turned 21 in 04. Done edcs and all that. I think I’m done for at least a year then it sucks me back somehow. I guess it helps that I live in Denver and it’s a short $32 flight with my flight pass. Thought I’d share how I’ve been doing it on the cheap. Here’s my timeline. 

October 24 - Unplanned notel trip when a friend had an extra concert ticket. I bought a bottle of tequila at the airport and some tall boys. Friend was staying at park mgm so I got to use the pool and lazy river at mgm grand. Think I spent like under $200. Gambled maybe $20. Used my Vegas for free drinks and food.

Jan 25 - Saw how cheap Anyma tickets were at the sphere and had to check it out. I paid like $150 for floor. MGM signature was less than $100 a night and then I used a myVEGAS comp paying resort fees only for a night at park mgm. Went to alexxas for brunch and got bottomless. Spent a lot of time enjoying the room’s balcony. Think I lost a few hundred on blackjack. 

Feb 25 - A friend had someone drop out of a Chinese new years event at bellagio and told me I had to go and to get on a plane that day. It was absolutely crazy. His host gave me a free room there and I had an awesome fountain view. I didn’t really spend anything on that trip aside from the Ubers. It was a huge dinner at the party. 

April 25 - Wrestlemania trip. I had originally booked linq for it as soon as it was announced for something like $150 a night. I checked Mandalay Bay the week of it and it was only $100 a night so I switched to that. We went to McDonald’s across the street for egg McMuffins and coffee for breakfast then did decent dinners. We went to the liquor store next door and got plenty of booze for the room. We took alcohol to the pool and didn’t get any grief about it. The Wrestlemania tickets were like $600 total for both nights for good seats so that was expensive, but everything else really wasn’t that bad. 

Labor Day 25 - Booked Mandalay again for $100 a night and flamingo my first night for resort fees only. Where else are you going to find an awesome resort with great pools that weekend??? We did shared table service we had reserved at tao beach. Probably the best $140 I’ve ever spent. It was such a fun awesome time. You’re put in a shaded cabana with fans and it really is unlimited booze. We met some amazing people in the cabana with us. I’m still in disbelief over what an awesome time that was. We also did the unity sphere show at like $150 a ticket. I ordered alcohol, snacks, and water off uber eats and had had it delivered to the room. I gambled more than I’ve ever gambled before. Kept winning at blackjack then losing it when my friends insisted on craps then winning it back in blackjack. Think I ended up being up about $500. We were up till dawn playing. Comp service is decent at Mandalay too. Also won $200 off a slot the next day. We spent a bit at Guy Fieri’s before the sphere show. I put $40 in a slot while my friend used the bathroom and somehow hit $1400. Almost was late to the show since I had to get tax paperwork.  That was a bachelor party type trip for me with some good friends and was just fucking awesome. 

Upcoming trip - Caesars emailed me a free 3 night comp. Caesars Palace wasn’t on the list, but I did a search just to see and it came up as a comp. I do still have to pay resort fees. I guess they want to recoup some of the $ I hit at linq. My wife and I were like why the hell not. So we’re just doing a nice relaxing trip without any concrete pools. Caesars is one of the few strip hotels I haven’t stayed at so I’m excited to check it out and glad the pool is year round. Hoping tipping the check in person $50 gets me fountain view room. 

So just some helpful tips I’ve found to keep the trips cheap…

Book direct logging into your players account on mgm and Caesar’s. Then track the prices every week or so. It’s crazy how much they fluctuate. You can cancel up to 3 days before your trip so there’s no reason not to lock in the best rate then see if you can do better.

Tip at least $20 when checking in and just ask for a good room view. I have got some of the most awesome room views doing this. 

Do shared table service for pool parties or clubs if you can. Totally worth it. 

Uber eats or find a close liquor store to get your booze to your hotel room with water and snacks. There’s no open container laws so just bring booze everywhere. Almost no one questions you with a beer in hand and shooters are easy to bring anywhere.

If you’re trying to save money just do one big meal and go to a cheap fast food spot otherwise. 

Go during events. I think this is the biggest appeal of Vegas now that gambling is more accessible everywhere. The town puts on amazing events though. 
Get lucky. I’ve been extremely lucky at casinos this year. I never really played slots, but my wife had me start trying them and so far I’ve won $5500 and $1500 3x at various casinos. Probably spent only a few thousand on them overall.",11,1765788183.0,vegas,3,0.79,False

Laundry detergent being tweaked owing to gen Z’s love of matcha,"It used to be curry sauce, egg yolk and red wine that ruined Britain’s clothes but in a sign of the times laundry detergents are being reformulated to tackle stains left by matcha lattes, Aperol spritz and bubble tea.

In a month when year-end gongs are dished out, from BBC Sports Personality to Pantone’s Colour of 2026 (a white called “cloud dancer”), matcha has received the dubious accolade “stain of the year”.

The honour has been handed to the Japanese green tea after it topped the inaugural “stains index”. The ranking, compiled by the washing detergent maker Unilever, identified “new and emerging stains based on evolving lifestyles and culture”.

To this end, matcha, Aperol and bubble tea top what was an actual laundry list of the country’s hottest stains. However, it could also be a proxy of the zeitgeist, given gen Z’s thirst for morning matcha coffees and fluorescent boba teas.

While some could consider the topic a bit of a turn-off, Donna Macnab, Uniliver’s director of laundry research and development, said the world of stains offered an “interesting reflection on our lifestyles and routines”.

“The first thing you notice about stains like matcha and Aperol is they’re very highly coloured. These bright colour pigments \[there’s a chlorophyll in matcha\] penetrate the fibres, making the drinks difficult to remove,” she said.

Washing powder adverts used to be preoccupied with wholesome outdoor stains such as mud and grass stains and Macnab said these stains had not gone away, but added: “As we see new pigments and residues emerge, we test new formulas and adapt our products.”

But it is not just what gen Z are eating and drinking that is leaving its mark, it is their beauty regimes, too, with makeup and fake tan among the top “lifestyle” stains.

In response to the research, scientists based at Unilever’s Port Sunlight laboratories in Wirral have tweaked the formulas of its Persil and Surf brands to ensure they are a match for matcha.

It was not the first time that changing lifestyles sent the company’s experts back to the drawing board. Last year, Unilever launched the Persil spinoff Wonder Wash to tackle the musty smell of gym gear.

The shift to remote working meant “athleisure” clothing such as T-shirts, joggers and leggings were being worn every day. The company identified that this had made smells rather than stains a problem, with invisible sweat and smell-causing body oils, clinging to athleisure wear.

The index will be updated annually to monitor new stains and inform the development of Unilever’s new laundry products.",0,1765787943.0,laundry,2,0.5,False

I've been in Bangalore for the better part of a decade now and life has been pretty interesting. I've met a lot of fascinating people, both online and offline. My work is pretty interesting, so thats something I'm grateful for.  I was in a pretty great relationship that lasted quite a bit.  All in all, life has been pretty great.

A few years ago, I was someone who's daily routine was just my work and my apartment where I'd just sit on computer/whatever gaming console I had at the time, watch a whole lot of content,  a few phonecalls to my school buddies once in a while, and a series of very dumb and sometimes serious conversations with myself.  I was someone who decided to just remain single for the rest of my life.  I had become so used to it, and I used to really like spending time with myself.

But life had other plans, and I met someone and things just happend, and we broke up. I was prepared to go back to being single and I assumed it would be just like riding a cycle, and I could  go back to my old ways. But over the last four years, a lot has changed, as it inevitably would.  People would move on with their lives, and phonecalls and meetups with friends are few and far inbetween.  I mean, I don't know why I'm surprised, its only natural. So life is lonliner than it used to be. But it is what it is.

But besides the loneliness, I realized how much I actually missed that connection  I had in the realtionship.  I know it's obvious to most people, but I guess I was dumb for thinking I could get over it.

So, I'm looking for someone to chat with throughout the day. We can talk about anything from the existential dread of a Monday morning to the best places to find good biryani in this city. To  talk about mindless scrolling, a sounding board for bad jokes, and maybe, just maybe, someone to meet up with for a coffee or a beer.  
If it grows into something meaningful and long term, that would be amazing.

A little about me: I'm 33, work in research and also on a startup (I know, shocking), and have a slightly unhealthy obsession with sci-fi movies and shows. I'm also a pretty decent cook and can whip up a mean biriyani/pasta.

# If you're also looking for someone to just chat with, or if you're just looking for someone to break the monotony of your day, send me a message.

Another one of my pain point is that YNAB's bank sync is only available for US and CAD, so living outside of US/CAD that feature does not apply to me but I still need to be subscribed just to have access to everything else.

So I created [BuildYourBudget](https://buildyourbudget.com/), an web app that allows you to do enveloped style budgeting and track crypto + bank account (for US/CAD) + brokerage accounts, giving you a complete view of your expenses.

More importantly, users who's not in crypto, can't use bank sync (living outside of US/CAD/EU) or just wants to do manual budgeting, they can do it for completely free on [BuildYourBudget](https://buildyourbudget.com/).

Bank sync + brokerages (Still working on it, but it's close to being completed.)

1pn2gi5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gynarchism/comments/1pn2gi5/a_mixture_of_good_and_bad_for_the_gynarchy/,A Mixture Of Good And Bad For The Gynarchy Community.,"There are good and bad things happening for the Gynarchy community. One particularly fascinating case that embodies both can be found in an article i will link for everyone to read. 

https://neofeminist.org/p/lets-talk-about-gynarchy-3aeabf63c013

Every so often, typing the word Gynarchy in will take you to interesting places, people, and articles. One thing that this article makes clear is that other communities are paying attention to Gynarchy and the community itself. 

i do ultimately think it's a good thing that the language the community uses is being acknowledged by other groups. Without other human groups, we would forever remain a tiny fringe group. 

The bad is that articles like the one i'm going to take the time today to respond to, are done by people who don't do research, are being dishonest, or making assumptions that are easily disproven by interacting with Gynarchists on and off Reddit. 

""gynarchy is not just unhelpful. It’s off-putting, misleading, and, frankly, a little creepy."" 

Unhelpful to WHOM? Off-putting to WHOM? To the author? Maybe feminists who feel the same way. This kind of feels like the person is saying Gynarchists are creeps. While there are problems with this community, as with any, i don't consider sincere Gynarchists to be creepy at all. 

""But in modern usage, it rarely shows up in healthy, constructive conversations about gender equality.""

And this right here is a perfect example of someone who doesn't do their research. Most Gynarchists i've run into do not believe men are equal to Women. They believe Women are better than men. Also, i'm not sure who exactly is participating in these ""constructive conversations"" about gender equality. Would you consider inviting the incel who planned to murder 3,000 Women to this convo? How about all the men who want to strip away your right to vote? How are we supposed to have conversations with people who express zero humanity for the people they wish to brutalize, torture, or destroy? 

""Instead, the term is often found in fringe subcultures — either as a male fantasy of female domination or as a scare tactic used by those who believe feminism has “gone too far.”

In both cases, it frames female power as something extreme or unnatural. It either fetishizes it or demonizes it. Neither supports real-world feminism.""

So how about the Gynarchy groups on Reddit and elsewhere that treat the subject with respect and don't fetishize or demonize it? Got anything to say about them? 

i don't consider Gynarchy or in-person, Gynarchic communities to be either extreme or unnatural. What i do consider unnatural and extreme though is sharing power with a group that proudly boasts about maintaining a system that's making our planet uninhabitable, a group that mass produced weapons of murder that could destroy the entire human species and one that wants to take advantage of your good will to destroy all the things your movement gained. 

""One of the biggest issues with gynarchy is that it flips the script without changing the system. It implies that women simply take the top spot in the same old hierarchy.""

If the slightest amount of research had been executed, this person would realize that many Gynarchists disagree on exactly how a Gynarchy would be formed or how it would function. Gynarchists do not universally agree on many subjects. We are not a monolith. 

""Gynarchy, on the other hand, still sounds like a dictatorship. Just in heels.""

Here we go again. The vast majority of Gynarchists i've ever met advocate for Femocracy. Some even insist that both men and Women vote, wanting men to willingly consent to Women running things with their vote. It's often a minority opinion for anyone to advocate for monarchy. Has it happened in the past? Yes. Is dictatorship all that Gynarchists ever advocate for? No. 

""Words like gynarchy can push people away from feminism instead of pulling them in""

Here's a few questions for everyone here. Are feminists afraid that the idea of Gynarchy will gain momentum? Are they afraid that their vision for society is threatened by the vision that Gynarchists have? 
Do they feel like our very existence undermines theirs?

 i think Gynarchists have a right to express their opinions, and exist without being perceived as a threat to another group. 

""We don’t need to sound like we’re advocating for a female-led regime — we need to invite people into a more just, equitable future.""

Alright...since you brought up the future, let's talk about it. How can we establish an equitable future when industrialized civilization is collapsing faster than climate scientists said it would? How in the world can we expect equality when, in just a few short decades, we're going to go from artificial scarcity to REAL scarcity? Where people will have to migrate to find whatever vegetation and animals we haven't killed off yet? 

Want to know what i find creepy? A bunch of  
people who keep talking about creating a more equitable future while our planet is becoming rapidly uninhabitable, while Women's rights are being taken, and where there are no tools Women have at their disposal right now to stop the violent, domineering men from taking control. It's like watching someone talk about their plans for next week and drinking a cup of coffee, acting as if their house isn't on fire while men are coming into the home and pouring gasoline onto it. The  house is burning to the ground and the dreamers keep on dreaming, while being confined to a nightmare. 

Gynarchists get accused of fantastical thinking, but based on the way men behave today, how is it any less fantastical to believe that someday, they'll accept feminism as a group and stop fighting it?

""Gynarchy, by contrast, feels rigid. Violent. ""

A super majority of Gynarchists are people who want peace and to live in balance with the environment.

""So let’s leave gynarchy in the weird corners of the internet where it belongs.""

i already suggested Gynarchy books to libraries around the planet and i don't intend to stop suggesting them anytime soon.

So I kept hearing people say “we should do the Baltics” like it’s a normal sentence… and I realised I was doing that polite nod while secretly thinking: *what are the Baltic States, actually?* 😅

If you’re in the same boat, here’s the simple version: **the Baltic States = Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania**. Three neighbours on the eastern side of the Baltic Sea, each with its own vibe, language and “oh wow this is prettier than I expected” old town moment. 🏰🌲🌊

# What it feels like (in real-life travel terms)

* **Tallinn (Estonia):** medieval old town + creative districts + very good coffee + day trips into forests/bogs if you want nature
* **Riga (Latvia):** art nouveau buildings for days, a big central market, and honestly great value for a capital
* **Vilnius (Lithuania):** baroque-y, cosy, a bit artsy, and feels super liveable (in the “I could accidentally move here” way)

It’s not “Scandinavia” (even though Estonia is close to Finland). It’s also not some mysterious grey zone you need to overthink. It’s just… **three very doable countries that work brilliantly together on one trip**.

# Safety: the quick answer

**Yes, the Baltics are generally safe for travellers.**  
The usual stuff applies (watch your phone in crowds, don’t follow random strangers into “the best bar”, use normal taxi/common sense). But overall they’re rated as peaceful countries globally and sit in the low-risk bracket for tourists.

# What it costs (mid-range, not backpacking, not fancy)

Obviously this depends on season and how feral you go with cocktails, but as a rough planning number:

* **€110–€150 per person per day** That’s about **£95–£130** / **$120–$165** Covers a comfy room, meals out, local transport and typical sightseeing.

**Tallinn** can feel a bit pricier in the old town. **Riga and Vilnius** are usually the “wow this is good value” ones.

# Easy first-timer route (7–10 days)

If you want a no-brainer itinerary:

* **3 nights Tallinn**
* **2 nights Riga**
* **2–3 nights Vilnius**

Travel between them is easy by bus (most common) or train on some routes. Distances are short enough that you don’t waste your whole holiday staring at motorway shrubs. 🚍

# Best time to go

* **May–September:** long days, outdoor cafés, coast + forests are at their best 🌞
* **Late Nov–Dec:** Christmas markets, cosy vibes, BUT short daylight hours ❄️✨
* **Autumn:** underrated, golden forests, fewer crowds 🍂

Winter can be beautiful, but it gets dark early. If that makes you grumpy, plan around it.

I will establish a consistent 6 AM - 8 AM morning routine for 60 consecutive days including exercise, journaling, and focused work to maximize productivity.

# SECTION B: BREAKDOWN OF STEPS

Days 1-15: Wake at 6 AM daily (no snooze), 20-minute workout, cold shower, 10-minute journal, coffee, 60-minute deep work session.  
Days 16-30: Refine routine timing, add gratitude practice to journal, optimize breakfast prep, protect deep work time (no email/Slack).  
Days 31-45: Maintain consistency on weekends too, track productivity metrics (tasks completed), notice energy level improvements.  
Days 46-60: Perfect the system, document benefits, create backup plan for travel/disruptions, commit to 90-day extension.

# SECTION C: EVIDENCE COLLECTION PLAN

1. Daily check-in photos — timestamped selfies at 6:05 AM showing wakeup time for all 60 days (can be compiled into video).
2. Workout app screenshots — Strava/Apple Fitness showing 60 morning workouts logged.
3. Journal entries — photos of handwritten journal (or digital screenshots) showing 60 daily entries.
4. Productivity tracker — spreadsheet showing deep work hours completed each morning (minimum 40 hours total over 60 days).
5. Weekly energy level ratings — self-assessment (1-10 scale) tracking increased energy and focus.

# SECTION D: POTENTIAL OBSTACLES & SOLUTIONS

Oversleeping — place alarm across room requiring standup, go to bed 10 PM strict, no phone in bedroom, accountability partner texts 6:05 AM.  
Low energy initially — expect adjustment period Week 1-2, drink water immediately upon waking, light exercise acceptable first week.  
Weekends temptation to sleep in — keep same schedule 7 days/week, remember productivity gains worth temporary sacrifice, social events scheduled afternoons.

# SECTION E: PROGRESS UPDATE SCHEDULE

Updates every 10 days in comments: Days 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60. Include wake time success rate, workouts completed, deep work hours, energy level changes.

# SECTION F: DEFINITION OF SUCCESS

Complete when: 60 consecutive 6 AM wakeups documented via timestamped photos, 60 workouts logged in fitness app, 60 journal entries shown, minimum 40 hours of morning deep work completed, measurable productivity improvement noted in tracker.",1,1765787435.0,FutureGoals,1,1.0,False

Wake up → stare at code → fix bugs → break something else → repeat.  
Deadlines chasing you, coffee replacing sleep, and a city outside the window that keeps moving while you feel stuck.

I don’t even know when I stopped dreaming. At some point, “passion” turned into survival. Learning new frameworks not because I love them, but because if I don’t, I’ll fall behind. Again.

Everyone says *“you’re lucky to be in tech”*, but why does it still feel empty?  
No clear goals anymore. Just keeping the job. Just paying bills. Just existing between commits.

Does anyone else feel like they weren’t born to live, but just to work?

Or is this just a phase every software engineer goes through?

1pn2czb,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pn2czb,What model of this sewing machine is my grandma’s open side cabinet?,"Hello my fellow vintage sewing enthusiasts! I’m looking for answers on this side open cabinet model. This was originally my grandma’s that was purchased along time ago way before I was born back in my family’s home town of the Philippines where my dad and aunts and uncles grew up, my grandfather worked on the farm in the countryside where they grew enough crops to be able to sell and make enough money to send my aunts off to a private nursing university and buy land for them to be passed down to future generations, along with other stuff which included this sewing machine which was soon passed down to my auntie when she arrived in the country and which is that I’m now writing from (going anonymous on here lol! 😝) but anyways the first time I ever seen the machine in person was like a few days or weeks after my mom’s early retirement (I’m special needs so of course she would do it to take care of me, although I’m a stubborn little girl LMAO and youngest of 3 (formally 4 adult siblings and a 2 year old mixed niece! 😜) and a few years after my fathers passing (RIP 🥺) so seeing this was a huge shocker for me and was a for a while heavily involved in wanting to learning more about it. Unfortunately since receiving this machine and my mom barely using this when we got it from my auntie, it was stored in the basement and not used years later till I wanted to take an interest in sewing.

The thing is now that I am wanting to use this machine, I actually have no idea if this even is a singer or standard machine at all. For the longest time I researched long and hard and kind of came to the conclusion it was a 27-4 vibration **SINGER** shuttle, but now looking at it more closely I kind of feel misunderstood and mislead by what is in front of me. So now I’m second guessing it’s a **Standard** but I don’t see any serial number at all. It’s hard enough to take off the cabinet and peak inside just to see the serial number in there (please correct me if I’m wrong 😑 and yes I have googled that answer!) 

But anyways I believe from these pictures you can crack the code and figure it out.

My apologies if the stupid lighting is not that good, it’s 1:15 at night where I live and my brother is sleeping so I had to be quick and quiet about not waking him up but honestly please just figure this out, sometimes it’s driving me crazy :(

If you want to know:

\- The bobbins and shuttle along with the spool felt are all original and came with the machine when my aunt brought it.

\- Yes I know how to treadle and sew on it (thanks to the internet)

\- if I wanted to get this service then I’d have to bring it to a specialist in the matter of repairing it (I’d probably WOULD try and DIY myself but of course that is not happening even if eBay or Etsy had some, I am still wouldn’t not trust myself to find parts and repair!

\- my aunt on my moms side has a 28K hand crank w/ Egyptian decals so I could use that but I don’t really feel like it because 1: I already have one and even if I wanted to work it I would have to get it working and some parts even the manual is time consuming and I’m just honestly lazy to go back and forth!

2. I am more comfortable with asking my aunts on my fathers side for advice and the overall history of it if I get permission to restore it and bring it back to life

But like seriously please answer honestly if you can help me out. I just drink half of coffee in a mug and I want to crash out now

I didn’t receive any coffee last week and I’m running low 😅. In all seriousness, servers cost money and I’d love to get this to a place where I can do it full time.  

Do you lot think this is worth pursuing? Does it add value? I’ve got a lot of ideas for using tech to pull richer player data – something scouts, teams, fans, and players themselves could use to track development over time.

If you think this idea is worth pursuing and can spare a pound/dollar/yen, please consider helping out here: https://buymeacoffee.com/goonloan. And if you’ve got criticisms or suggestions, I’m very open to those too.

You guys. I’ve been testing these so-called “AI app builders” for weeks, and honestly? Most are just fancy form generators. **BUT THIS ONE. Creao AI is the actual game-changer**. It proved that building an app that could potentially be worth **$9,000 USD!** can be done in minutes. Minutes!

It claims to build **full-stack, functioning apps** just from a text prompt, including the database, UI, and the whole deal, without writing a single line of code. Here’s my breakdown of how the testing went, what features stand out, and the honest pros and cons.

**The Testing Process: Following the Tutorials**

I focused on two distinct tests demonstrated from the tutorial videos to see how flexible Creao is:

**🤯 Case Study 1: The Health Reminder App**

https://preview.redd.it/a2ifzy3kub7g1.png?width=1043&format=png&auto=webp&s=9eda3baa8879c6e30690bc751fc5fd8f858ce7d3

I threw a complex prompt at it: I needed a personal awareness app. Something that handles smart notifications, tracks progress, logs activities, and reminds users about medicine, water, and sleep.

1. **The Prompt:** Detailed, asking for specific features and even custom **brand colors (green and white)**.
2. **The Speed:** It cranked out the *full functioning app* in **about 50 seconds**. Did you hear that? Just enough to heat up a cup of milk.
3. **The Features:** It wasn't just a shell. It had tracking, a status bar for progress, and activity logging. Everything worked **very, very well**.

**The Best Part? The Co-Pilot!** Every app built comes standard with an integrated **Co-pilot Beta AI**. The user can chat with the AI *inside* the app, asking for tips—like how to drink more water—without ever leaving the interface, then all changes will be made automatically! That is a **cool feature**. Probably the **best thing** this tool has.

**🖼️ Case Study 2: Image-to-PDF Converter**

https://preview.redd.it/frst7nbmub7g1.png?width=935&format=png&auto=webp&s=1bef48e0ff589400c3e3b26f36603e74ca99eca5

Next challenge: building a web app that takes multiple images and turns them into a single PDF. A real-world utility app.

* **Prompt Language:** Important note here, you **must insert the idea in English** for it to work properly.
* **The Build:** Less than 5 minutes. It was done before I could finish my coffee.
* **Testing:** It successfully uploaded four images. I could **reorder the pages** just by dragging them. Then, I hit ""Download PDF."" And Oh my God! It actually created the complete PDF.

**⚖️ The Verdict: The Good, The Bad, and The ""Uh Oh""**

**The Good Stuff (The Hype Train) :**

* **No-Code God Tier:** You literally don't write a single line of code.
* **Integrations are Seamless:** You can connect massive tools like Google Sheets, Notion, Slack, and even social sites like Reddit, without worrying about the annoying API keys for the recommended options.
* **Real-Time Updates:** I saw the user update the app live—adding a **Dark/Light Theme switch** via a simple prompt. That took **almost 1.5 minutes**. Dynamic changes? Yes, please.
* **Affordable Entry:** You can use it for free with credit limits. And if you want the Pro plan, it starts at a **super accessible** price ($12.50/month).

**The ""Uh Oh"" (The Catch) :**

* **Code Lockout.** This is the biggie for serious builders: If you want to view, download, or self-host the source code (the files!), you **must subscribe to the Pro plan**. If you’re not willing to pay, you’re locked out of the core files.
* **English Only Prompts:** Gotta stick to English when instructing the AI.

**Final Takeaway:** If you want to prototype quickly, test ideas, or just launch a side hustle that might be making thousands, Creao is your tool. It builds full-stack logic—not just pretty faces. **Just remember: If you need the files, you need the subscription.**

Has anyone else jumped on Creao? Let me know what you built and if the code lockout is a dealbreaker for your workflow!",1,1765786892.0,AIToolTesting,0,1.0,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **St. Louis Blues vs. Nashville Predators: A Tale of Two Sieves**

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a game where both teams’ defenses might as well be made of Swiss cheese. The St. Louis Blues (-126) and Nashville Predators (+105) are set to clash in a rematch that’s less “hockey” and more “goal-a-thon.” Let’s break this down with the precision of a Zamboni and the humor of a penguin in a blazer.

---

### Parsing the Odds: The Math of Mayhem

The Blues are favorites, but their -126 line implies a 55.7% chance to win. For context, that’s about the same odds as betting your coffee won’t spill before you take your first sip. Nashville’s +105 line gives them a 49.5% implied probability, which is slightly more optimistic than your chances of finding a parking spot at an NHL arena on a Monday night.

The over/under is 5.5 goals, and with both teams averaging 5.3 goals per game (combined), this is a recipe for a goal-fest. The Blues rank 32nd in defense (3.5 GAA), while the Predators are 27th. Together, they’re the NHL’s version of a broken dam—water (read: pucks) is getting through everywhere.

---

### Injury Reports: A Roster Thinner Than a Dollar Store Hockey Stick

The Blues are playing with one hand tied behind their back (or should we say, one *line* tied behind their net). They’ve got **seven players out**, including key contributors like Jordan Kyrou and Nathan Walker. It’s like building a house with a toolbox full of hammers and no nails.

The Predators aren’t exactly rolling out a fully stocked buffet either. They’re missing Justin Barron and Ozzy Wiesblatt, but their core remains intact. However, **Jonathan Marchessault** is a ghost at even strength (3 even-strength goals in 26 games). If he’s not scoring, he might need to start a side hustle—maybe “Stamkos’ Second Act: Professional Goal Scoring Consultant.”

1pn28u3,https://www.reddit.com/r/PickUpArtist/comments/1pn28u3/fr_the_silent_girl_lay_how_to_handle_an_introvert/,"[FR] The ""Silent Girl"" Lay: How to handle an introvert girl in India when she barely speaks (Logistics Breakdown)","TL;DR: approached a super shy/introverted girl. She barely spoke a word. Most guys would panic and try to ""talk her into liking them."" I didn't. I used a system based on body language (Kino) and logistics.

Result: 2-minute instant date to Hotel lay.

We all know Indian girls can be very guarded or shy initially. If you rely on ""verbal game"" (banter/jokes), you will fail with these girls. You need to look at their actions, not their words.

Here is the exact breakdown of how I handled it.

I approached. She locked eyes but stayed completely silent. A rookie mistake here is to start blabbering to fill the silence. That makes you look needy. Instead, I ran a ""Physical Test"" (Kino):
- I held her hand. She didn't pull back.
- I touched her hair. She let me.

Her mouth said nothing, but her body said ""YES."" Because her physical compliance was high, I didn't wait. I said, ""Let's grab coffee right there,"" and bounced her instantly.

We went to Starbucks. I immediately gave her a job: ""Do me a favor. Go find us a good seat upstairs while I order."" She went and did it. Why this matters: In her mind, she is now following my lead.

We sat down. She was still quiet. I didn't panic. I just ran comfortable silence and light touch. I seeded the next location immediately: ""After this, we're going to grab a quick beer.""

We left Starbucks and bought a beer. Crucial Move: I asked her to put the beer bottle in her bag. This is a psychological trick. She is now carrying the logistics for our date. She is invested.

Now, the hardest part in India: The Hotel Seed. If you ask: ""Want to go to a hotel?"" -> She will say NO (She feels cheap/slutty). What I did: I told a story.

""Last time I was here, my friends and I found this cool, safe spot near Garden Galleria to chill... We're going there to drink this beer, then I gotta run."" I framed the hotel as a ""cool place to chill,"" not a place to sleep together.

We got to the hotel. She hesitated at the door. Her: ""This place looks shady."" Most guys get defensive here (""No it's not!"") or beg (""Please come in""). My Response: I stayed 100% calm. I didn't argue.

I just said, ""It's fine. We're not doing anything weird, let's just chill for 10 mins."" I held her hand and walked in. She followed. Inside, I didn't rush.

I made her play DJ (put on her music). I turned off the harsh lights. I focused on comfort. Because I led correctly from the start, things happened naturally, clothes out, dick out and we had our best time.

1. Silence is not Rejection: If she stays with you and lets you touch her, she likes you. Shut up and lead.

2. Seed Early: I mentioned the beer while we were at coffee. I mentioned the ""chill spot"" while we were buying beer.

3. The ""Indian Hotel"" Paradox: Never ask a girl to go to a hotel for sex. Lead her there for an ""adventure"" or ""chill session.""

4. Don't Argue: When she says ""It's shady"" or ""I can't,"" don't fight her with logic. Just lead her with confidence.

This wasn't luck. It was a system. Most of you are losing girls because you are ""guessing"" what to do next instead of having a roadmap.
