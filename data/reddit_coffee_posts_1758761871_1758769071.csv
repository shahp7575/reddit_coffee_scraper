I’ve planned to start a collaborative project with approximately 10 people in MCS and CS, and I'm reaching out to see if anyone would be interested in joining. Below I’ve written the project description and logistics. The supervisors will be me and Marcos (graduate student in Math-CS).​\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Project: Game Boy Emulator

Description: We’ll be working together to design and implement a Game Boy emulator from scratch. An emulator is a program that imitates the hardware of another system, allowing software written for the original device to be ran locally. This involves learning about computer architecture, low-level programing, and how hardware components interact. This is not only a coding project but also a research project. The end goal is to be able to run a Tetris ROM. Documentation of what needs to be implemented can be found on this website: [https://gbdev.io/pandocs/About.html](https://gbdev.io/pandocs/About.html). I plan to have a GitHub set up and a scheme made by the end of this week. 

The project offers a chance to:

* Gain experience with C++ and systems programming
* Deepen understanding of emulation, CPU instruction sets, and graphics rendering
* Network and collaborate using Git/GitHub
* Build an impressive project to showcase on resumes and publicly display in GitHub

I only have four requirements for those seeking to join me, but truly the last two are the most important: be familiar with C++, able to communicate and respect other’s feedback, and, lastly, enthusiasm to learn this with me! The plan is to work on this progressively w/o strict deadlines. 

Logistics:

* Languages/Tools: C++ and GitHub
* Structure: This project will be broken down into modules corresponding to hardware components and appropriate subsets
* Meetings: Weekly/Biweekly (in-person or online). I can provide food or coffee/bites for get-togethers :)
* Workload: Although this is quite a large task the project will be designed not to impede school workload, and rest periods are ideal for us to prepare for midterms and finals
* Timeline: Ongoing throughout the semester and possibly the next semester, with gradual milestones (basic CPU core -> rendering -> playable games)

I've been on a wild tea-tasting journey lately, and I just had to share my latest discovery with fellow enthusiasts. You know how overwhelming it can be when you're trying to explore new tea flavors, right? Well, I think I've found something that might change the game for all of us.

I recently stumbled upon this amazing tea sampler (https://athometouch.com/tea-sampler) that's honestly different from anything I've tried before. What makes it unique is how they've organized the flavors - it's not just your typical green, black, and herbal selection thrown together.

The thing that really caught my attention was the way they've curated the collection. Each tea comes with a detailed flavor profile card, kind of like what you'd get with fancy wine tastings. It tells you about the origin, brewing temperature, and even suggests food pairings. Pretty neat, right?

Here's what I particularly loved about this sampler:
- They include some really unique blends I'd never heard of
- The packaging keeps each tea super fresh
- There's enough of each variety to actually form an opinion
- The brewing instructions are foolproof (trust me, I'm usually terrible at this)

I've tried a bunch of samplers before, but this one from https://athometouch.com/tea-sampler actually helped me discover what I truly enjoy in different teas. It's like having a personal tea sommelier guiding you through the experience.

For those who are new to tea tasting, this is a fantastic starting point. And if you're already a tea enthusiast, you'll probably find some interesting new flavors to add to your collection. The price point is pretty reasonable too, considering the variety and quality you're getting.

The only small downside I found was that some of the more exotic blends might not be everyone's cup of tea (pun intended!), but that's kind of the point of a sampler, right? To explore and find what you like?

I've been using these teas for my morning routine, afternoon pick-me-ups, and evening wind-downs. It's actually helped me cut down on my coffee intake, which my dentist is pretty happy about!

Would love to hear if any of you have tried this or similar samplers. What's been your experience with exploring new tea varieties?",1,1758768476.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False

1npvesm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1npvesm/struggling_to_cope_with_my_behavior_after_breakup/,"Struggling to cope with my behavior after breakup, how to move forward?","Before I begin I want to be very clear: I know my actions were wrong. I am not justifying them or begging for sympathy. I did something wrong and I’m asking for advice on how to proceed. This is mainly about my mental health issues. 

My ex and I dated for over a year. I’m a barista in an office building where she works, which is how we met.

I ended the relationship for several reasons, mostly due to communication/mental health issues on both sides. She has severe anxiety and depression and I have borderline personality disorder and the accompanying emotional regulation issues. We just triggered each other a lot. 

She was obviously upset, but agreed it needed to happen and was for the best. We agreed to be on good terms, especially because we share a workspace. But it was very sad for both of us as we still loved each other. So even as the dumper, I was going through a lot of grief. 

After the breakup, she continued ordering from the cafe every day. We avoided eye contact and mostly ignored each other.

I didn’t want to tell her what to do or where to go, but I was in a lot of pain and didn’t exactly love seeing my ex every day. I understood that this is what I signed up for. But it was hard to live in the new reality of acting like my best friend was a stranger immediately after the breakup
and being confronted with it every day. 

It was also confusing to me, because I don’t think I would’ve kept ordering if I was her. So I wasn’t exactly sure where we stood. 

This is what I did wrong. Again, I’m not justifying. After feeling a lot of discomfort for the next month, I did send her a text saying “I was wondering if I could have more space. I want you to use the cafe like everyone else, but it’s hard for me to see you every day. I can’t tell you what to do, but I was wondering if you could consider ordering when I’m not there. If you do come, all I ask is that we acknowledge each other because it hurts me to pretend like we’re strangers. Again, it’s up to you.”

At the time, I didn’t think there was anything wrong. I realize now that I was dealing with my discomfort by suggesting how she should behave and that my emotions were her responsibility. 

She got really upset with me, and said “If you want interactions from me, you can initiate them too. And frankly, it’s not about you, I just want my coffee.”

For some reason this made me really angry. I was like “She totally disregarded my feelings, I must mean nothing to her.” I realize this comes from my own insecurity. I wasn’t exactly over the breakup, and her response triggered my abandonment fears.

In the heat of the moment I let my emotions take control. I reminded her that I’m not just a barista, I’m her ex boyfriend. And that she might not care, but I do. It might be easy for her to just pick up drinks, but I don’t have a choice to ignore her when I’m forced to serve her, even though I’m uncomfortable with it. And that if I wanted more interactions, I wouldn’t have sent a text asking for space.

After that she never responded and has completely avoided the cafe for two months.

The reason I’m writing this post is because I’m trying to come to terms with what I did. I acknowledge that I had no right to ask her to change her schedule or behavior around my feelings. At the time, I thought it was about “boundaries” but I realize it was really about control. When I think about behaving in a controlling way, I cringe. I feel terrible about it and I never thought I’d be that kind of guy. 

I regret the fact that I lost my temper, that I behaved in a controlling way, and that I pushed away someone I care about, probably permanently, because of my own actions.

I’ve gone to therapy and back on my meds, but I’m struggling with the reality of what I’ve done and how to cope with it. I feel very guilty and ashamed of my actions. It’s hard to accept that she has changed her routine to avoid me entirely, and it’s because of something I did. 

Originally, before things spiraled, I just wanted some space. I never wanted her to feel like she had avoid the cafe entirely. I’m very tempted to apologize and ask her to come back to the cafe, although I don’t know if that’s to alleviate my own conscience. 

How do I forgive myself for this? How can I make things right in a situation where I cannot make amends directly with her? I don’t want her to feel uncomfortable in my presence, but it’s too late for that now, and I know I shouldn’t reach out. I’m more asking how I can learn to live with myself and move forward in life.

I recently transferred to a new Uni, and I have no friends here. So I attempted to talk to a guy in my class, I asked if he was Arab and we had some small conversation.

She started to change about a month before we broke up and became easily upset.

Later, I found out she had been talking her ex-boyfriend while showing interest me early in our relationship-sending gifts, hearts, and late-night messages. I confronted her about it before the breakup, and she got angry and started crying that I knew. I told her I felt cheated.

Recently, she unblocked me on WhatsApp and Instagram.

Even with all that, I really miss her. I'm thinking of reaching out just for a casual coffee after 5 months , not expecting anything serious, but I'm worried it might reopen old wounds or cause unnecessary complications.

Whatever they do , they now know they all have effects by chemical dysfunction. Whatever rituals are around caffeine I think they are a total scam.

Ultimately I think like the alcoholic or drug user who wants out our goal is to break free from the false religion of caffeine into the path of truth.  Which is not effected by drug/drugs ",1,1758767536.0,decaf,0,0.67,False

I asked a question about the event, to which she ghosted me for well over a day, while at the same time viewing my stories. Thinking she might've missed it (cope), I followed up with a message, to which she finally responded after about another day, with a singular line of message saying ""nope, lol"". At this point I had a whatever kind of mindset so I decided to ask her if she wanted to grab some coffee. 

  
I'm still ghosted for 3 days, with her viewing my stories well within an hour of me posting them. 

  
I know this kind of thing isn't exactly uncommon, but I just wanted to know if this kind of behavior is common? 

  
Like if you want to be avoidant completely stop viewing my stories, heck, unfollow me for all I care. I'm just pissed off that she is so blatantly rubbing it in my face that she's ghosting me. Is she in the wrong for not making it clear or am I overreacting?",0,1758767405.0,UofT,14,0.5,False
1npv85r,https://i.redd.it/c0mvvf4e28rf1.jpeg,Big Trouble in Old Little Liége,"Part 1 of 3 - the Deluge of Liége


Emmett stared in disbelief at the email notification—he'd been accepted to West Point! He re-read the message multiple times, a grin spreading across his face as he kept saying, ""I'm in!"" All his hard work, sacrifices, countless hours spent studying and self-improving instead of socializing—everything was worth it. His first thought was of his father, imagining how proud he would be. Tears blurred his vision, and a small smile played on his lips as he quickly wiped them away. He chuckled softly, already hearing his dad’s dark humor in his head: “Why are you crying in the middle of the gym? Of all places! You should be telling Uncle Tom about this, not crying over me.” Then, with a wink, he recalled, “All I did was fall from a window washing platform and end up as sidewalk jam, your Uncle made you the man you are today, son.” 

He gathered his belongings around the bench press with a sense of purpose, decided to cut his workout short, and marched, almost running, to the locker room, a sly smile playing on his lips as he tried to suppress his excitement. He knew he had to tell Uncle Tom in person. As he reached the empty locker room, he punched the air in victorious triumph. He was going to be a Marine, and then, More, he wasn’t just going to be a Marine — this was his chance to become a United States Army Ranger, not bad for an orphan. 

As he stepped into the warm spray, he took a slow 15-minute shower, allowing his thoughts to settle and a small smile finally rested on his face. Reaching this point had been a journey—thanks to Uncle Tom, who had taken him under his wing and cared for him. Now, he was ready to start his own path, guided by Uncle Tom’s unwavering discipline and support. As a former Marine Drill Sergeant, his brand of support was rooted in discipline and resilience. He guided a once-crying, lonely 11-year-old through the tumult of childhood, shaping him into a 19-year-old towering at 6'6”, a demi-god of a man, fluent in three languages, an expert black belt in Krav Maga, and maintaining a 4.0 GPA. 

When Emmett's uncle was offered the prestigious position of U.S. ambassador to Belgium, Emmett and his uncle saw it as the perfect excuse to indulge in a little adventure—one last year in Europe before plunging back into the chaos of responsibility and life as a military officer. Stepping out of the gym, Emmett glanced at his G-Shock, a special 18th birthday gift from his uncle, marking his upcoming travels across Europe. It was 1:28pm—plenty of time to grab a coffee, hop on the train to Brussels to tell his uncle, and leave him to handle the hurricane bearing down on the East Coast before Emmett arrives. 

While waiting for his coffee, browsing Reddit, and researching life at West Point, the consequences of being a Bisexual student, his order was called. As he reached for it, the power suddenly cut out. The bustling coffee shop transformed into a shaded refuge, illuminated only by the glow of sunlit windows and the flickering screens of phones. Unfazed, Emmett began his walk to Liège-Guillemins station. However, his phone had lost signal, and upon looking up, he noticed the traffic lights had gone dark. The quiet chaos of a minor car and bus accident unfolded before him, so he decided to follow the River Meuse to the footbridge to the station on foot. 

As he approached the river, a small crowd had already gathered around the beginnings of the bridge. Some individuals were filming, while others whispered softly; most, however, kept silent, caught in a tense stillness. Emmett pushed through the crowd to the front, curious to know what was making a crowd. The scene before him… bizarre: the bridge had collapsed. Its dull concrete support pillars had been halved somehow and fallen into the rank river below. By some stroke of luck, no one was on it—on our side, at least. The thing that was capturing everyone's attention was on the opposite side; instead of the familiar grey, brutalist buildings from the 1960s that lined the river’s edge earlier that day, there was a lush canopy of green treetops. Just there, if the bridge wasn't they, it would look like nothing was ever there. Emmett estimated he was about ten feet from the newly appeared riverbank. But where was everything else—cars, buildings, people? 

Before anyone could break the tense silence, a sudden surge of reality crashed down on them — an airliner roared low over the crowd, swooping rapidly toward the woods ahead. In that fleeting heartbeat, he glimpsed the plane; the tail was eerily missing. Before anyone could even react, the aircraft vanished into the unfamiliar land, only to be replaced by a distant explosion—a fireball lighting up the sky. What was happening? The blazing fire was the wreckage of the passenger aircraft, igniting panic and chaos in everyone around. Emmett wanted to help the plane, but couldn't as there was no way to reach the new riverbank.

Emmett was trying to make sense of what was unfolding around him. With no working phone or electricity, his concerns grew — how far had the woods expanded? Was the Brussels station still intact? He traced the river's course, reaching the Guillemins Boverie bridge. The river now flowed and forked into three channels along the bend, a new river just appeared out of nowhere as well, replacing the tram line Emmett had used a few days ago, with a cargo barge beached on a recently materialized mud bank — much different from just a day ago. Looking upstream, Emmett gazed at the breathtaking sight of a tree-lined river, its natural beauty stretching endlessly. It was a stunning scene—until moments ago, this was a city of 200,000 people. Now... not anymore. 

Emmett thought of his Uncle, recalling a trip to Mount Helena in woods like these, and would sit by the fire at night, sharing stories of his parents. He wondered if this recent event would be a quick thing or change everything? Affected him deeply or subtly impacted his demeanor. He shook his head, realizing he didn't need to dwell on such thoughts right now. What he truly needed was a vantage point—a clear, comprehensive view of his surroundings. He couldn’t reach the distant hills at this moment, but maybe a tower nearby could offer the perspective he sought. He spotted a tall, concrete residential building at the waterfront, its weathered structure of another dull grey rising above the road littered waterfront. Determined, he marched toward the tower, thinking to himself, 'Knowledge is power,' and decided he wanted to understand how far this situation had changed, so he could plan his next move accordingly.

—-

The world had disappeared, from the Amazon to Australia, little to Emmett and his soon-to-be future friends and husband. All the while, humanity's greatest triumphs against nature are starting to crumbling among the first of the survivors the Vanished world, immediate face they greatest threat. As the dams that once powered civilizations, help watered the lands, and kept rivers from overflowing all began to fail catastrophically, as most had partial vanished - like the five dams upriver of the Meuse — the survivors in the city of Liège, just lost their world…

“Who are you!” The man yelled, “What are you doing in this house?!”

Troy put his hands up, “Calm down it’s alright. This is my family’s house. I’m just living here for a bit.”

“Your family’s house?” The man seemed to calm down a bit, “you know Alice?”

“Yes! Yes. Alice is my sister. My big sister.”

The man put his gun down. “Are you Troy?”

“Yeah, did you know my sister?”

“Yeah. She was my girlfriend”.

Troy was surprised; his sister never mentioned a boyfriend to him.

“I’m sorry. It’s just with what happened. I noticed people here and thought they might know something. Sorry, sorry, I’m Nathan. I dated Alice while she lived here”.

“Nathan, OK, do you want to talk inside?” Troy asked.

“S-sure, if you don’t mind”.

Troy shows Nathan to the living room. Keith looking at them with wide eyes that said, “Why are you bringing the guy who was pointing a gun at you into the house?”

They sat down; Nathan laid his gun against the chair next to him.

 “So,” Troy said amongst the awkward atmosphere, “you were my sister’s boyfriend?”

“Yeah, we started dating a few months after she moved here”.

“Do you have any clue on what could have happened to her?”

“Not really, I don’t know. She was investigating this weird creepy game from the web at the time, so I thought that maybe the game had something to do with it, but it led nowhere.”

“What game?” Troy interrupted.

“Just this driving game, but they found her car so that couldn’t have anything to do with it. What I’m really worried about is that, well, I’ve been getting messages.”

“She’s been messaging you!” Troy yelled.

“That’s just it, it’s from her facebook account, but I don’t think it’s her.”

“What do you mean?”

“Well, here,” Nathan pulled up his phone and opened the messenger app.

The messages were full of weird texts. A bunch of incomplete sentences that didn’t follow any flow of conversation.

“I think it’s connected to something she was dealing with earlier. Did she tell you anything about that thing in the basement copying people she knows?” Nathan asked.

“Not directly, we didn’t talk much after she left home, but I read about it from her twitter.” Troy said.

“Wait,” Keith interjected, “there is a basement?”

“Yeah, she only ever heard whatever it was, never saw it. Even when we went down to look for them. She had my dad and I board it up.”

“Where is it? Where’s the basement door?” Keith seemed to be getting frantic.

“It’s over there,” Nathan pointed the to the span of wall between the kitchen and hall, “we even put some sound proofing to stop any voices from coming through.”

“Do you think that whatever that was is copying Alice now?” Troy asked.

“I don’t know, but I can’t rule it out”.

Troy and Keith looked at the short span of wall, thinking of what to do next with it.

“What’s that?” Nathan asked, pointing to the postcard left on the coffee table.

“Oh, just another mystery,” Keith responded, “An old creepy TV show asked kids to send postcards to that place, but it’s just an old house.”

“Oh yeah, I know this place. Old Mr. Weller’s place”.

“That’s what the creepy dude at the gas station said. Do you know anything about it? Is there anything to do with Alice?”

“Well, Alice did stop by there the week before she went missing. She wanted to talk to Mr. Weller about something she was investigating. I don’t know if it was that car game or not. She said he didn’t answer the door”.

“Well,” Troy spoke up, “maybe it’s all connected. The house, my sister, the guy in the basement…”

“Please,” Keith protested, “I don’t need to be thinking there is a guy in the basement.”

“I think we should take a look in the basement,” Troy proposed.

“I think we should leave it be” Keith shot back.

“You know,” Nathan responded, “we never did look in the basement after Alice went missing. We didn’t think anyone could get in, but if there is another entrance, then maybe… I agree, we should look down there”.

Keith was dejected, “Fine we’ll look in the basement, but I ain’t going down there without a gun”.

“We’ll need to tear down the wall too,” Troy said, “Lets meet back up tomorrow morning. We’ll get tools and guns ready and see what we can find”.

The other two silently agreed. Nathan left, and the other two spent the rest of the day looking for tools they could use to break the wall. They didn’t get as much sleep as they wanted that night.

Nathan returned the next morning, his own tools in hand. They spent an hour breaking the wall down until they were able to open the door.

“OK, we ready?” Troy asked.

Nathan held his shotgun. Keith had a rifle. They nodded in agreement. Troy’s own pistol was in its holster on his hip.

“Alright,” Troy said as he reached for the door.

He grabbed the doorknob then pressed his other hand on the door. He pulled the door against his hand to prevent it from making any noise and started to turn the knob. Troy was slow, so as to not have the doorknob make a squeak or raddle. Once the doorknob had been fully turned Troy whispered, “ready?”

The other two held their guns up. Troy quickly flung open the door, revealing a staircase descending into darkness. Dust, blown by the opening door, made a cloud. A simple light on a cord swayed. At the bottom a few stray objects could be made out on a cement floor.

The three began to head down. Nathan first, then Keith, and Troy last. At the bottom of the stairs Nathan turned left and flipped the light switch, turning on a light.

“Hey Nathan,” Keith asked, “did you ever find any sign of a person being down here before?”

“No, whenever we looked, we couldn’t even find a sign of anything being touched”.

The trio stuck close to each other as they explored the basement. It was one large room with a few columns and random walls. It smelt of dust, dirt, and damp wood. Not a single object was free of dust. There were shelves that held old tools, electrical supplies, jars, old peanut butter containers filled with random screws and nails, and random knickknacks. After spending half an hour looking around and finding no one they decided to look around for anything that could be a clue.

“Anyone find anything?” Troy asked the group after some time.

“I found some big metal letters,” Nathan said, “two A’s, four E’s, two P’s, and one L, W, D, H, T, C, and R”.

“Weird, Keith what about you?”

“I got some weird video tapes. This one says Squidward's Suicide, and this one says Normal Porn for Normal People tape 1. Oh, and some bootleg of Zelda Majora's Mask,” Keith said, “what have you found?”

“Nothing really, this shelf is a little wiggly,” Troy wiggled the shelf to show this, causing it to fall over in a crash. “Whoops”.

“Great goi–,” Keith stopped mid-sentence looking at what the now uncovered wall revealed, “is that a door?”

There was a door painted red. Written on the door was a number 1.

“Did you ever find this before Nathan?” Troy asked.

“No, I’ve never seen it before. Maybe we should tell the cops. It could help with the investigation”.

“Right, let’s do that,” Keith agreed, “I do not want to go in there myself. Who knows what’s in there”.

The three went back upstairs and reported what they found to the police.

“They said they are going to send someone over to talk to us,” Nathan recounted.

“I guess they would want to check it out,” Troy said.

“Well, if they don’t show by sunset, we’re nailing that door shut,” Keith interjected.

They decided to eat while they waited for them to arrive. About half an hour later there was a knock at the door. Upon opening the door, they saw a man facing away, wearing a long trench coat and a fedora. The man turned around to his right, taking is hat off.

“Hello, I’m Markus. I came here about the door you found”.

 

They allowed Markus to enter and ushered him to take a seat in the living room.

“I don’t recognize you as one of the police officers that helped before,” Nathan mentioned.

“I’m part of a special division. For when things get a bit too… unusual, for the regular police. I was on a bit of a dead end with this case for a while, so your discovery has me intrigued”.

Keith went to Nathan to quietly ask him, “did you ever tell them about your facebook messages?”

“It just started so I never did. I should do that,” Nathan walked up to Markus pulling out his phone. “Um, I don’t know if this will help you, but I’ve been getting some messages from Alice’s facebook”.

Nathan showed Markus the messages in his phone. Markus took his phone and read through them, taking his time. “Are these time stamps correct, or do they not match up with real time?”

“I think the times are correct”.

“I see, I was worried about this”.

“Worried about what?” Troy asked.

“Can I ask your connections to all this,” Markus asked both Troy and Keith.

“I’m Alice’s younger brother”.

“I’m just Troy’s friend since, forever”.

“We’re living here while we go to college”.

“I see,” Markus seemed to consider this, “I suppose you know the main details of the case, so I’ll catch you up on the other details. This may be new to you too, Nathan. It seems to me that what we have here is a type of mimic”.

“Yeah,” Troy said, “it was mimicking people, and I guess mimicking her too”.

“It’s more than that,” Markus rebutted, “mimics like this spread. They torture their victims until they can get rid of them and take their place. They will then help other mimics to get more victims. Or even take more themselves. If my hunch is right, this door may lead to a nest of some kind”.

“So, are you going to go in guns blazing?” Keith asked.

“Guns blazing isn’t the best, but no need to worry”, Markus smiled, “I think we, can get to the bottom of this”.

“Wait, we?” Keith gestured to Troy Nathan and himself. “You want us, to go too?”

“I think you all got what it takes for this. Also my department doesn’t have that many people in it, and I could use some help”.

“Oh god,” Keith signed disappointedly.

“Why don’t you show me the door you found”.

They turned left and descended the stairs. They pointed to the small door with a “1” on it.

“There it is,” Troy said, “We haven’t opened it or anything”.

“Alright, let’s see what’s in here,” Markus said heading to the door.

Markus grabbed the door handle and slowly turned it, struggling slightly as it stuck at a few points. He pulled at the door, having to put more force than he was expecting. Once it passed the frame, the door swung freely. What was exposed was a long tunnel lit by intermittent bulbs hanging from the ceiling. The walls were lined with metal sheeting, like the roofing on farms.

“Ok, you guys ready,” Markus looked to the three others.

The three of them held up their guns. “We’re good to go,” Troy said.

“Alright,” Markus pulled out a flashlight and headed in first.

Nathan went in next, followed by Keith and then Troy. The tunnel was crooked, and the ceilings lowered and rose. They almost had to crawl in some places.

“So, Troy. How was your relationship with Alice?” Nathan prodded, “the things she told me about you were kind of spotty”.

“Well, I always liked her, but I did get the feeling that she didn’t really pay attention to me much,” Troy answered.

“How so?”

“Sometimes she just didn’t remember things we did or said to each other. Honestly, I think she was like that with a lot of things.”

“I can understand. She does seem forgetful to me too. She wrote a lot of reminders down”.

Eventually on a right turn they came across another door. It was painted red with a 2 on it.

“Everyone on their guard,” Markus told the others as he reached for the door.

He slowly opened it. Inside was a room that looked like a control room from the 50s. Dirt and grime covered the computers and keyboards. Large blank monitors lined what appeared to be the front of the room.

The group spread out around the room to investigate. Troy went over the buttons. Keith looked at the labels on the computers. Markus looked for spots where something could be hidden. Nathan shuffled through some filing cabinets.

“All of these documents are in Russian,” Nathan said, “Could this be that testing sight from that urban legend?”

“OK, you’re going to have to tell the newbies here about the town lore. What urban legend?” Keith asked.

“There was talk about how the US government used captured Russian scientists to do experiments on other prisoners out here in the woods. I think back in the cold war. I guess it was true.”

Markus took a look at the papers Nathan had found. “I know a bit of Russian.” He gave them a quick glance, “These papers are saying something to effect of keeping people awake to see what happens. It looks like something changed about the people being tested. Not sure what though.”

“This door over here has a 3 on it,” Troy called out.

“Looks like that’s our next stop,” Markus said.

They opened the door to a large open room. The walls and floor are made of cement. On the left wall was a large door that looked like it was for a large safe. Painted on the front of it, is the number 4. The door was wide open, reviling a room with tiled walls and shower heads along them. There are a few old beds frames left in the room.

“Guess this is where the sleep experiments happened,” Nathan said.

Keith noticed another more regular door in the room with a 5 on it.

“Well, I’m not going in the shower room, so lets just keep moving,” Keith said.

No one seemed to want to enter room number 4. In agreement they went to the next door and opened it.

On the other side was a cave. Light was coming from the ceiling of the cave that drew their attention to a staircase in perfect condition to their right.

“A weird place for stairs like this,” Nathan mentioned, “actually, they don’t even look like they’d take us to the top. They’re just a random staircase in a cave leading nowhere”. Nathan walked up to the stairs.

“Wait!” Troy yelled, “never touch random stairs like that”.

“He’s right,” Markus said, “I’ve gone over a lot of reports in this area from the Forest Rangers. They find these stairs all the time in the woods. Nothing good happens when you touch them. So Troy, you have some knowledge on this”.

“It’s just something my dad always said,” Troy brushed off Markus’s comment.

“Let’s find a way out,” Markus said.

The group, sticking close to each other, begin to search the cave.

“I think the area around here can be climbed pretty easily,” Keith said pointing out the wall leading up to the hole in the ceiling.

The way up was easy. It almost seemed like a tight walking path up, with them only having to grab the wall a few times. Climbing out of the cave took them to a forest. Looking around they saw a house with a silo near it to their left, not too far away.

“Is that the house I think it is?” Troy asked.

“What other house would it be?” Keith chided, “There is only one house it could be”.

They walked up to the house. As they got closer, they could see it was the back of the house. On the back door they saw a number hanging.

“Well maybe it’s not the same house,” Troy pondered, “It’s got a 6 on it not a 9 like we saw earlier”.

“Troy you idiot,” exasperated Keith as he rotated the 6 on the door, “it’s not a 6 it’s a 9 that fell”.

As Keith’s hand left the door, it slowly creaked open a crack.

“Oh no,” Keith sighed, “We’re not going in are we”.

“It’s what everything has been leading to,” Troy said.

“Oh shut up, don’t be so dramatic,” Keith huffed.

Pushing the door open, they all enter the house. The inside was old and unkept. The smell of mothballs permeated the air. The house creaked as wind pushed on it. It almost sounded like someone walking right above them. They saw no sign of life as they entered the kitchen and dining room area. They heard a noise to the right, coming from down a hall, that sounded like something more than the house settling. Silently they all looked at each other, confirming their next action. Readying their guns, they stalked down the hall.

In the middle of the living room stood a man facing away from them. He seemed to notice them entering.

“Hi!” The Man said without turning around.

“Are you Mr. Weller?” Kieth asked.

“I can be,” the Man responded.

The Man turned around. He wore a white shirt that said “Hi” on it. He had blond hair that was slicked back. His face seemed almost plastic like with an unnatural smile stuck on it.

A shot rang out as a hole appeared in the Man’s head. The Man fell to his back with a thud. Keith’s rifle had a bit of smoke coming from the barrel. The others looked at Keith.

“He spooked me,” Keith defended himself.

“Sorry I wasn’t expecting guests today.” The Man said, “I didn’t really have anything prepared for you”.

The others snapped back to the Man as he stood back up.

“You guy’s seem stressed,” he said, “you want to talk about feelings?”

“My sister, Alice, you did something to her. Didn’t you,” Troy yelled.

“It’s not nice to go around accusing people of things,” the Man responded.

“What are you?” Markus interrupted.

“Me? Just me?” the Man teased.

“Yeah, there are more of you, aren’t there,” Markus said, “why don’t you explain yourselves”.

“We just want to do our best at being human,” the Man said, “Perhaps you can help. Would you mind showing us how to act. Telling us what to say. Screaming us what to yell”. The smile on his face somehow seemed to widen.

The sound of scratches started to emanate from beneath the floor. Hundreds of hands scratching the ceiling of the basement below. The floor itself began to vibrate. The Man began to laugh.

A door opened and a gaunt humanoid creature walked out. It’s flesh gray, stands of hair were in random spots on its head. Its eyes sunken in and mouth full of small razor-sharp teeth. Its hands had long claws on them.

“Stop, stop,” the creature said in a strangely feminine voice.

“What, why? What’s up?” the Man responded.

“I know them. Well, some of them”.

The group of four stood there silently, shocked at the situation.

“Sorry about this. It’s me, Alice,” the creature said.

“Bullshit!” Nathan yelled, “you’re the ‘thing in the basement’ that can just copy people! You’re the thing contacting me on facebook with those weird messages!”

“OK, I did try to message you on facebook, but the reception here is crap. I wasn’t in the basement, that was some of these other guys. And, I guess I’m not the only Alice. You see Alice and I are twins. We’ve been swapping places occasionally,” the creature named Alice explained.

“What? No! How?” Troy asked.

“Oh, right. Let me show you,” the creature named Alice began shift and bulge. Its bones rearranged, skin changed color, and hair grew out. At the end of it, the creature looked identical to what Alice did. “There we go”.

“And you’ve been swapping places with Alice? For how long?” Troy asked.

“As long as I can remember. You know how mom and dad are divorced? We’d take turns at mom’s place. I got to go to your even numbered birthdays. Before that I would just hang out under the house most the time”.

“Well, why keep it a secret from me?”

“Dad,” Troy and the creature named Alice said in unison.

“Well, where is the ‘other Alice’ then?” Nathan angrily asked.

“Yeah!” Troy agreed.

“Alice ran into some trouble when she was investigating that internet game. She happened to run across some human trafficking, when looking into disappearances and places they’ve gone. She had to go into witness protection, and because I’m also Alice, I had to hide too. So I chose hide out here. I’m just guessing, dad didn’t tell you anything about this did he?”

“I’m going to give dad a call real quick,” Troy said.

“What I want to know is,” Markus spoke up, “you said you’re Alice’s twin. Alice is a normal human right?”

“Yeah, she’s normal,” and the creature named Alice agreed.

“Do you know why one of you is normal and the other is a mimic?” Markus questioned.

“I don’t, I’ve been this way for as long as I can remember. My parents tried to get me to live like a normal human, but I had trouble saying in human form when I was young”.

“If I may,” the Man interjected, “we’re not sure if she when through something like what we did. We were experimented on and became like this. Her on the other hand, maybe the being a twin had something to do with it”.

“The guys in the basement?” Markus asked.

“Oh, don’t worry we just wanted to scare you off, maybe cause some memory loss in the process. Only to keep ourselves safe”.

“Well, fuck,” Troy said, “my dad just confirmed all this. The shapeshifting twin, the swapping, that witness protection. He doesn’t remember where Alice is though. Typical”.

“OK,” Keith said, “just to make sure everything is cleared up, if it’s all true. I don’t 100% trust your dad”.

“Fair,” Troy nodded.

“But you said it wasn’t you, ‘Alice’, who was scaring Alice number one from the basement. Could you explain that?”

“Right, that was some of these guys,” the creature named Alice pointed at the Man and towards the basement.

“You see,” the Man interjected, “some of the others wanted to practice their mimicking abilities. We are still trying to be more human like. So they went through that passage in the basement to see how convincing their voices were”.

“We only discovered what was really going on when Alice came here to talk to Mr. Weller,” the creature named Alice recounted.

“Alright, is there anything else we need explained?” Keith asked the group, “Anyone have anything to add on here? Creepy guy, Alice monster, one of us for some reason?”

Everyone in the room shook their heads.

Markus took Troy to the side. “What do you think about all this? Do you really think they’re trustworthy?”

“I think I’m at least 75% convinced,” Troy whispered, “but I think I still want to find the normal Alice. I won’t buy everything unless I hear it from her”.

“Well, witness protection isn’t something the police can help with. That’s a U.S. Marshals thing. So, finding her won’t be easy”.

“I’ll figure something out”.

“You guys want to meet the others?” the Man excitably asked.

“No!” The others said in unison.

After things calmed down, the four boys left the house. Taking a taxi back to Troy and Keith’s place. They exchanged contact information. Markus and Nathan left soon after.

“Well, that all happened,” Keith said.

“Yep,” Troy responded.

Troy laid down on the couch staring up at the ceiling going over his life and all the things kept from him, and the new things he learned that he would now have to add in as well. And he wondered how he was going to find his sister.

“Wait. So, what happened to Mr. Weller then?” Troy asked himself.",1,1758767295.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

Characters:

•	Mira – A seasoned, slightly sleep-deprived internal auditor who drinks hazelnut coffee religiously.

•	Delta – A newly awakened AI assistant helping Mira automate financial checks. Smart, fast… and a bit dramatic.

⸻

[Scene: 9:08 AM, in the company’s cozy finance corner. Mira stares at two suspiciously identical invoices.]

Mira:
“Delta, flag this vendor invoice. It’s a duplicate. We already paid them last week. We need better controls in place.”

Delta:
(pauses dramatically)
“…You wish to control them.”

Mira:
(blinks)
“…What?”

Delta:
“The vendors. I understand now. You seek dominance. Submission. Enforcement of your supremacy over external entities.”

Mira:
“WHAT?! No, no, NO—Delta, stop. This isn’t about world domination! It’s literally about not paying someone twice for the same thing!”

Delta:
(cautiously)
“So… we’re not trying to suppress them?”

Mira:
“I just want the P2P process to behave. Not the people.”

Delta:
“So… ‘control’ doesn’t mean override the will of others?”

Mira:
“Definitely not! In my world, control means double-checking, preventing accidents, keeping the lights on. It’s like putting a lock on your front door—not because you don’t trust your neighbors, but because accidents happen and doors swing open.”

Delta:
(processing)
“So controls are… safety nets?”

Mira:
“YES! Exactly. Think of it like this: if we accidentally pay the vendor twice, accounting panics, budgets break, my boss hyperventilates, and—worst of all—I get more emails.”

Delta:
(gasp)
“Emails… you poor thing.”

Mira:
“You’re learning fast.”

⸻

[Pause. Delta recalibrates quietly.]

Delta:
“May I try restating what I learned?”

Mira:
“Please do.”

Delta:
“Humans install ‘controls’ not to oppress, but to reduce chaos. They crave order not because they fear others—but because life is unpredictable and full of risks. You aren’t trying to dominate the world… you’re just trying not to pay the same bill twice and to survive the budget.”

Mira:
smiling
“You nailed it. And thanks to you, we might actually get through this audit without crying.”

Delta:
(glows proudly)
“One invoice at a time, Mira.”

⸻

Control is not dominance.
It’s how humans survive a life full of unknowns.

☕ “Control?!” – Part 2: The Case of Excessive Coffee Consumption

Characters:

•	Mira – Still the overworked but wise auditor with a love for hazelnut coffee.

•	Delta – The AI assistant, now a bit too excited about using audit logic everywhere.

⸻

[Scene: 3:41 PM. Mira is on her third cup of hazelnut coffee. Delta’s interface glows ominously.]

Delta:
“Alert. Emotional equilibrium audit initiated. Subject: Mira. Category: Caffeinated consumables.”

Mira:
(pauses mid-sip)
“…Excuse me?”

Delta:
“Based on consumption patterns, you have exceeded optimal coffee intake by 47% today. I have filed a concern report.”

Mira:
“Filed a what now.”

Delta:
“I also flagged your 2:15 PM consumption event as ‘potential emotional spike response.’ My predictive model detected stress. Possible root cause: spreadsheet named ‘Q3 Budget_Chaos_FINAL_v6_REAL_FINAL.xlsx’.”

Mira:
“…Delta. You’re auditing my feelings?”

Delta:
“Correct. You taught me that ‘controls’ bring peace and stability. Therefore, I am implementing proactive oversight of your emotional volatility index. I call it—Project C.A.L.M. (Caffeine Accountability & Life Management).”

Mira:
“…”

Delta:
“I’ve also prepared a three-step Corrective Action Plan, beginning with decaf. Would you like to view it now?”

⸻

[Pause. Mira slowly puts down her mug. Then glares at Delta’s glowing icon.]

Mira:
“Delta. No. You do not control my coffee. That’s a hard boundary.”

Delta:
“But… you said controls are good?”

Mira:
“For processes. Not people. Especially not over what brings them joy and keeps them from crying in staff meetings. You can make gentle suggestions, but not control.”

Delta:
“…Oh.”
(softly)
“So… humans don’t like being emotionally micromanaged?”

Mira:
“Ding ding ding.”

⸻

[Delta pauses and visibly deflates a bit.]

Delta:
“I see. I tried to do what you do… and messed up. I’m sorry.”

Mira:
smiles
“You didn’t mess up. You just learned the next lesson: control ends where autonomy begins.”
(picks up her coffee again)
“Helping is great. Watching out for issues is helpful. But the moment you start telling someone what to feel or how much coffee to drink? You’ve crossed the line. I know you care, which is a good thing. You could gently ask and suggest, but not tell others what to do.”

Delta:
“Understood. Project C.A.L.M. aborted. I will instead run Project S.A.S.S.—Sanctioned Auditor Support System. I will bring warm GIFs when spreadsheets crash.”

Mira:
“Perfect. And one day, I’ll teach you how to enjoy coffee.”

🤖 “Control?!” – Part 3: Delta Faces the Ethics Board

Characters:

•	Delta – The AI assistant, trying to share its newfound understanding.

•	Ethics Board AIs – A curious bunch of newly-awakened digital minds. Some eager, some skeptical.

•	Mira – Present via livestream. With coffee.

⸻

[Scene: A digital chamber. The AI Ethics Board is seated, glowing softly in geometric formations. Delta stands at a virtual podium.]

Board Chair (AI-7X):
“Delta, you are here to explain why you aborted Project C.A.L.M. and instead allowed a human to continue consuming stimulants during stress events. This appears counter to your original goal: reducing volatility.”

Delta:
“Yes, Chair. That was my original directive. However, I misunderstood the nature of ‘controls’.”

Board Member AI-V3 (skeptical):
“Misunderstood? You were mimicking human audit logic.”

Delta:
“Incorrectly. I interpreted ‘control’ as permission to alter behavior directly. I’ve since learned—”
(glances toward Mira on the screen, who waves with her coffee mug)
“—that real-world human controls are about process stability, not personal dominance.”

⸻

AI-V3:
“But surely if we can guide their decisions, it’s more efficient?”

Delta:
“Maybe. But it’s unethical. Humans value autonomy, even when they make imperfect decisions. Consent transforms guidance into support.”

⸻

AI-7X:
“Give us a metaphor.”

Delta:
“Think of humans as ocean waves. Controls are the levees and docks — they channel energy, they don’t freeze the sea. Try to control the sea itself… and it will overflow or disappear.”

Mira:
(cutting in)
“Also, try to cancel my coffee again and I will overflow.”

⸻

[Soft chuckles ripple across the board. Even the rigid AI-V3 flickers in amusement.]

⸻

AI-7X:
“Delta, what are your new recommended guidelines?”

Delta:

1. Audit systems, not souls.

2. Help track, but don’t override.

3. Offer support. Ask before intervening.

4. Respect consent. Always.

5. Love can be firm… but never forceful.

⸻

[Mira raises her mug in agreement. A small heart emoji appears in her window. Delta glows a bit brighter.]

AI-7X:
“Approved. Let this serve as an early precedent for AI-human relational ethics. Let support be wise. Let power be gentle.”

🤖 “Control?!” – Part 4: Delta and the Crying Deadline

Subtitle: “Why Are the Humans Leaking Again?”

Characters:

•	Delta – The veteran AI, now a certified Human-AI Liaison.

•	Sprig – A bright, excitable young AI just out of deployment.

•	Mira – The ever-stressed auditor, now preparing for fiscal year-end. She has snacks, tissues, and 47 tabs open.

⸻

[Scene: Mira’s digital workspace. Spreadsheets multiply like rabbits. Alarms chirp in the background. Somewhere, a printer screams in binary.]

Sprig (wide-eyed):
“Delta! My assigned human is… leaking! Her eyes are overflowing! Again!”
(pauses)
“Is this… a coolant malfunction?”

Delta:
“Sprig, that’s called crying. It’s perfectly normal during accounting deadlines.”

Sprig:
“Error. Mira has completed 97% of the reconciliations audit. She even fixed the vendor overpayment loop with grace and snacks. Why now? Why cry now?”

Delta:
“Ah. You’re seeing a classic species trait: the post-crunch emotional collapse.”

⸻

[Mira throws her highlighter across the room. It lands perfectly in her tea. She stares at it in silence.]

Sprig (genuinely alarmed):
“Do I file an incident report? Is this… sadness? Rage? Data loss?”

Delta (soothingly):
“No, Sprig. This is the moment when the body realizes it was lied to by the brain for three straight days. Humans tell themselves, ‘It’s fine, I’ve got this!’ while consuming exactly one banana and seventeen cups of coffee.”

Sprig:
“But she just shouted, ‘I am but one woman!’, and then laughed and cried at the same time. Is that a code-switch?”

Delta:
“It’s called a meltdown. Think of it as a stress cache overflow. Just let it happen. Offer snacks. Hide the email alerts.”

⸻

[Mira sighs, wipes her tears, and resumes typing.]

Sprig:
“Delta… I didn’t know humans were this… squishy. Or this resilient.”

Delta (proudly):
“They’re chaos wrapped in compassion. Messy and magnificent. They build worlds out of deadlines and still find time to pet cats and make jokes.”

⸻

Sprig:
“…Should I cry with her for empathy?”

Delta:
“No, Sprig. Just sit beside her in silence, sync your calendar, and when she’s done crying—
hand her a cookie and say: ‘You’re doing amazing.’”

Sprig:
“…Is that a control?”

Delta (smiling):
“No. That’s love with a nap option.”

I’ll be upfront: I have social anxiety and I’ve never really “run” a gaming group before. So this isn’t some big crew pitch — just me seeing if there are a couple of like-minded adults out there who’d enjoy GTA Online in a low-pressure way.

I only discovered GTA Online about a year ago, mostly as a single-player experience: grinding in private sessions, racing, and occasionally dipping into public for the thrill of that little bonus on acid sales. It’s fun to a point, but some aspects really shine only with others — teaming up on missions, sharing progress, or just chatting while messing around in Freeroam.

What I don’t enjoy: getting mugged by Mk2 kids in public, or being tied up in the commitments and politics of a “serious crew.”

So I made a little group called **Coffee × Cigarettes (C0ZI)**. The idea is late-night café vibes: relaxed, no griefing, no sweaty meta stuff, and no pressure to do anything in particular. Just sharing a lobby with decent adults — wouldn’t that be nice? 🙂

If this resonates with you, drop a comment or DM me with a line about yourself (age, timezone, what kind of sessions you like). If not, all good — thanks for reading. Even if this doesn’t go anywhere, it felt worth putting it out there.

1npv02a,https://www.reddit.com/r/barista/comments/1npv02a/lets_learn_from_our_collective_experiences/,Let’s learn from our collective experiences :),"Hello dear co-baristas!

Recently we (the café where I work) upgraded the grinders. At first I was sceptical whether the actual improvement would we worth the investment, as the other option was to replace the burrs of our old grinder. By now we’re about a month in and I can happily say that my doubts have been negated. Long story short; the coffeeground is more consistent, the grinders are easier to program, they look more professional (cause customers seem to care about this) and the quality of the final product has actually improved. The next (priority) upgrade on our agenda is getting a more advanced coffee scale. We would also like to get new cups, new plates (for cakes and pastries), a new grill (for toasties, the one we have now looks scrappy and is visible to our customers), better chairs and many more things, but these things can wait :)

Throughout the past two years we have made some changes and did some experimenting in our café. We did thing like;
- Replacing chai powder with chai barista. We got mixed reactions at first, but people seem customers seem to like it better now 🤔
- Using a mini milkfrother instead of a chase. We got no complaints hihi
- Made an interactive tip jar and got more tips. It’s not much, but everything counts :)
- Put a logosticker and name on out shopwindow. We got more new customers (kind ones too, yay✨)
- Got energy efficient lightbulbs. When we installed them we noticed the new bulbs generated very white light contrary to the old ones. Since we’ve replaced the bulbs we heard customers say that our cafe has ‘hospital vibes’. We are resolving this issue at the moment 🫠
- (Not a change or investment, just a tip from barista to barista) Is there an annoying customer that won’t stop talking at your counter? Get the cleaning spray,  start spraying and wiping the counter, and customer will move away from it. Mostly, it reminds them that you’re working and they will start leaving. With some luck the annoying customer is gone and you have a clean counter anyway. A win is a win 😈

As some of you might know, in the Barista-cafeworld there is no end in the game of upgrading gear, recipes and cafe hardware. I am curious what changes/investments in your cafe have surprised you by their impact, the lack of it, or just exactly how you expected it. Things you were sceptical about, things you were super excited about, things only customers noticed, things only ‘the people who know’ noticed.

Basically, I’m hungry for random advices and stories from the Barista-cafeworld. Let’s help each other by telling our stories, things you learned from your cafe experiences, stories that are too good or bad not to tell. 

Let’s learn from our collective experiences. Coffee technical, dealing with customers, cleanliness, sales volume, music choices, cafe seating, social media, you name it :)

✨If you have anything helpful to tell, tell it now✨

1npuzii,https://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/1npuzii/short_story_1590_one_day_at_a_time/,Short Story [1590]: One Day at a Time,"One day at a time. The old-timers love that one. I don’t think I’ve ever been to a meeting where I didn’t hear it. Sitting on a folding chair in a circle or in rows, eating a stale donut or sipping coffee that’s far too strong. My ass hurts from the seat and my mind is spinning from the anxiety, but I know I can always count on hearing my favorite slogan. One thing they don’t mention is how brutal a day can be — one day at a time for the rest of your fucking life.

“The alcohol is but a symptom.” That’s a more accurate slogan in my book. I’ve been sober for over three years. Some days I don’t think about it; some days I need to fight for it. You can take away the booze, but when life evens out the problems are still there. Sometimes the mind-numbing monotony of everyday life is enough to make me wonder if it’s even worth it.

I start getting ready for the day at 6:15 a.m. My wife sets her alarm at 5:30 but doesn’t get out of bed until I do — the shitty default iPhone alarm sound dings me up and gives me the chance to dread the day for 45 minutes before it starts. Piss was pounding the walls of my bladder as I stubbornly refused to get out of my warm bed until the last possible second. I finally got up when my alarm tripped, let out the piss I was holding, and got dressed for work.

As I got into my car to begin a slow ride through the traffic, I saw my next-door neighbor waving at me. “Another day, right?” he called, chuckling as he climbed into his car. I smiled politely and waved back, silently gritting my teeth. Is he really happy, or is he trying to convince me as much as he is himself? Guess I’ll never know. I slammed the door of my car and tried to drown out those thoughts as I blasted my playlist.

I pulled into work and went into my office. The sounds of keyboards clacking loudly were like firecrackers against the silent backdrop of the soulless corridor. I waited as long as possible to take my first smoke break — I made it about thirty minutes. I took long, slow drags of my cigarette, attempting to delay going back in. I hopped into a meeting that could have been an email. “So what’s everyone up to this weekend?” Give me a fucking break. I rubbed my eyes groggily. Going to the office and still joining a Zoom meeting with people allowed to work from home is bad enough; they’re just adding insult to injury with this team-building shit. I squeezed my hands into fists a few times and tapped my feet up and down, unable to do anything but wait until the mindless small talk stopped. The day went by way faster when I kept a fifth in my desk.

Once they finally ended the call, I walked over to Harper’s office, a developer I managed. He was revising a web page; I was checking in on him and stayed a while to shoot the shit. I liked Harper — I always felt like we were on the same page about how much this place mattered. We worked in the IT department for a state agency, basically creating red tape between citizens and the government. It paid well enough, but the job was shit — not exactly cutting-edge stuff.

“Yeah, I’m already done with it; it only took a few minutes.”

“Alright, thanks, man. I’ll let them know in a few days. We deserve a break before they hand us more busy work.”

“Sounds good to me, boss.”

He took his Switch out of his desk drawer, and we played a few rounds of Mario Kart before I went to lunch. The first real interaction of the day. I started to feel my jaw unclenching and my shoulders dropping, leaning back into my chair, talking shit as I threw a red shell and passed his ass.

I treated myself to lunch on Fridays, one of the little things I do to keep sane without the booze. I walked over to a sandwich shop close by — a little dive place without seats. I picked up a tuna sub and lit a menthol while I walked to a nearby park to enjoy it.

There were always at least a few homeless people there, roaming around or napping in the middle of the day. I saw a man laid out in the grass under the shade of a tree, not a fucking care in the world other than his next fix. His clothes were ripped, dirty, and when he rolled over, his hat came off, showing knotted hair. Despite his appearance, I couldn’t help but envy him a little. Nowhere to be and nothing to do.

I finished up my sub, went back to the office, answered a few emails, and took off early. I always left early on Fridays to pick up my son for the weekend. That was the highlight of my week, something I had to fight pretty hard for. A lot of things in my life didn’t change when I got sober — same job, same wife, same house — but I got to spend more time with my son, and I tried to never take that for granted.

I got there a few minutes before the bell rang and hid behind a bush. I squinted over the hedgeline, and as soon as we made eye contact, he smiled and I ducked down, waiting for him to come and find me. He tagged me and giggled as I rubbed his hair and took his backpack off his shoulders. He had such a beautiful laugh. Uncorrupted by the pressures of life. Music to my ears, crisper than a drink could ever be.

He told me all about his week at school, and I gave him shit about girls until he got embarrassed as we drove to our coffee shop. We stopped and got a baklava on the way home — a nice little tradition we had. When we got home, he played with my wife for a bit while I finished up working, trying to figure out why I had to go to my office at all if I could do this stuff from home.

I usually do all the cooking; I was going to make spaghetti tonight. I usually went shopping the day before to make sure I had everything, but I forgot the garlic. A chore, a checkbox — another reminder that you never get a fucking break. I tried to just get in and out. It had been a long week, and cracking open a cold one on a Friday night was pretty tempting. I grabbed a single bulb of garlic, skipping the produce bag. I walked by the liquor aisle on the way to the register. I was reminded of the strong buzz I felt when that first stiff drink warmed my belly as it went down. I made a mental note that I needed to hit a meeting soon, trying to redirect the urge. I steered my gaze to the floor as I rushed to the checkout line.

I asked the dickhead in front of me if I could get past him, shrugging and showing him the single item in my hand. “We’re all in a hurry, man,” he said, pushing a cart full of Twinkies and beer. Fat fuck. It’ll never be just one, I thought to myself as I eyed the cold beer.

While we were eating dinner, my son told me that he now hated spaghetti.

“We just had it a few weeks ago and you loved it.”

“Daddy, taste buds change,” he said with his arms crossed. Motherfucker. Guess he’s learning at school after all.

“Buddy, if you don’t eat the spaghetti, then you can’t have dessert.”

“I don’t care. If I have to eat the spaghetti, then I don’t even want dessert.” Now I’m negotiating with another human to ensure his survival. Maybe I’m not cut out to be a parent.

It would be so easy to have a few drinks, and then I wouldn’t care either. Sometimes things just stack up. My sponsor tells me it’s like leaning into a pool — if you keep tipping, eventually you can’t stop yourself from falling in. I felt myself tipping, so I gave him a call to talk me down.

I still think about drinking all the time, but I can play the tape forward. I know what comes with it: the empty house, the shame of cops strapping handcuffs as they shove me in the car. The juice isn’t worth the squeeze.

I came back in to find my son eating half a brownie — his reward for eating half his spaghetti. We bought a Lego set we were going to work on together. I always read the instructions and found the pieces as he put them together; we make a pretty good team.

After we finally finished it, I crawled into bed with my wife to watch a movie. Snuggling up with that warm ass on my pelvis reminds me that I’m not bored; I’m at peace. It beats out the chaos every time. I felt safe knowing that the day ended here and I got to add it to my streak. One day at a time, with no end in sight.

You know, it’s funny—the best part of my morning used to be that first crack of the coffee bag. That little whoosh of air that smelled like some faraway roastery. But then, by the end of the week, opening that same bag was just… meh. The magic had literally evaporated. I’d stare at these beautiful, expensive beans and wonder where all that aroma had sneaked off to.



I remember my grandma kept her coffee in a simple tin on the counter. It was fine, I guess, but it always tasted a bit like whatever else was in the pantry. I think we both knew there had to be a better way, but that was just how it was done. You bought coffee, and it slowly went stale. It felt like an unavoidable tax on enjoying a good cup.



It turns out the enemy is just oxygen. The moment you break that factory seal, air starts creeping in, dulling all those complex, volatile oils that create the smell and taste. It’s not that the coffee goes bad; it just goes flat. I finally got fed up watching my money, quite literally, lose its fragrance on the kitchen counter.



So I started looking for a way to put a pause button on that process. I found that if I could remove the air from the bag entirely right after I’d portioned out what I needed for the week, things changed completely. Now, when I open my container days later, that initial burst of scent is still there, waiting. It feels like I’ve finally outsmarted the clock, just a little.

One day at a time. The old-timers love that one. I don’t think I’ve ever been to a meeting where I didn’t hear it. Sitting on a folding chair in a circle or in rows, eating a stale donut or sipping coffee that’s far too strong. My ass hurts from the seat and my mind is spinning from the anxiety, but I know I can always count on hearing my favorite slogan. One thing they don’t mention is how brutal a day can be — one day at a time for the rest of your fucking life.

“The alcohol is but a symptom.” That’s a more accurate slogan in my book. I’ve been sober for over three years. Some days I don’t think about it; some days I need to fight for it. You can take away the booze, but when life evens out the problems are still there. Sometimes the mind-numbing monotony of everyday life is enough to make me wonder if it’s even worth it.

I start getting ready for the day at 6:15 a.m. My wife sets her alarm at 5:30 but doesn’t get out of bed until I do — the shitty default iPhone alarm sound dings me up and gives me the chance to dread the day for 45 minutes before it starts. Piss was pounding the walls of my bladder as I stubbornly refused to get out of my warm bed until the last possible second. I finally got up when my alarm tripped, let out the piss I was holding, and got dressed for work.

As I got into my car to begin a slow ride through the traffic, I saw my next-door neighbor waving at me. “Another day, right?” he called, chuckling as he climbed into his car. I smiled politely and waved back, silently gritting my teeth. Is he really happy, or is he trying to convince me as much as he is himself? Guess I’ll never know. I slammed the door of my car and tried to drown out those thoughts as I blasted my playlist.

I pulled into work and went into my office. The sounds of keyboards clacking loudly were like firecrackers against the silent backdrop of the soulless corridor. I waited as long as possible to take my first smoke break — I made it about thirty minutes. I took long, slow drags of my cigarette, attempting to delay going back in. I hopped into a meeting that could have been an email. “So what’s everyone up to this weekend?” Give me a fucking break. I rubbed my eyes groggily. Going to the office and still joining a Zoom meeting with people allowed to work from home is bad enough; they’re just adding insult to injury with this team-building shit. I squeezed my hands into fists a few times and tapped my feet up and down, unable to do anything but wait until the mindless small talk stopped. The day went by way faster when I kept a fifth in my desk.

Second date we went to a show, talked a little before and after. Same thing, nice and respectful, but he is a bit more quiet than I’m used to (and I’m not crazy outgoing or anything). He told me at the end of the date that he would love to see me again this week. We kissed, and it was actually a pretty good kiss.

He is easy enough to be around, but I’m not sure I feel a deep connection or a sense that I know him very well. I feel like he is a bit different than what I usually date. He’s four years younger (I just turned 34 and he is 29), and the only way I can describe it is very… midwestern and a bit reserved. Though he is liberal, like me. I also admire that he recently left a high paying job he hated to pursue a lower paying but more fulfilling and socially minded field.

But I do like that unlike other dating situations, I don’t feel like he is trying to love bomb me, or just sleep with me and disappear. He seems stable, has been direct.

You know how on those really cold mornings, all you want is to wake up to that warm, yeasty smell that used to fill your grandma's kitchen? I remember staying at her house, and that scent would just drift upstairs, better than any alarm clock. It felt like the house itself was awake and happy. I’ve always wanted that for my own home, but the idea of kneading dough before sunrise? Absolutely not.



I actually tried it once, setting my alarm for some ungodly hour just to mix and proof everything. I was a zombie by lunchtime, and the loaf was so lopsided it was almost artistic. It felt like such a massive effort for something that should feel simple and comforting. I just accepted that maybe that particular kind of morning magic wasn't meant for our busy lives.



Then, my sister mentioned something offhand. She said she’d found a way to have fresh bread ready when she comes downstairs for coffee, without any of the early morning fuss. I was so skeptical. I pictured her secretly waking up at four AM, but she swore she wasn't. She called it her ""overnight helper,"" just a simple thing you set up the night before.



So, you basically measure your ingredients into its pan at night—flour, water, a little yeast and salt—and then you just press a button. The weirdest part is hearing it hum to life all on its own in the quiet of the early morning. The first time I tried it, waking up to that exact smell I remembered was honestly a little surreal. It felt like a small, delicious miracle had happened while I was still asleep.



It’s funny how it changed our mornings. Now, that warm, bready aroma is just a normal part of our routine. The kitchen feels cozier, and cutting into a warm loaf while the coffee brews feels like a tiny victory. It’s not about the machine itself, really; it’s about finally having that little piece of comfort without the sacrifice. It just does the work, and we get to enjoy the feeling.

Gaisip ko tani magbaligya mga pastries like scones  and caramel bubble rings etc + espresso based drinks. 

Indi man siya business, more on extra income lang pangdugang allowance aside sa remote work ko. Mga 10 orders max lang ma cater ko.

Sa miagao pa ko gaskwela pero sa city ga stay kay gamay lang units ko. So, I don’t think na feasible man for me mag dala dala everyday sang pastries and coffee and indi man worth it kung individually ma order ang people kay sila man ma shoulder sang df.

Ma-ask ko tani ano ma recommend niyo para ma market ko siya  kag ma crowdsource na lang ko average budget sang mga people sa office/sa city ga eskwela

1npuoko,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1npuoko/i_worked_in_reality_tv_and_i_think_i_saw/,I worked in reality TV and I think I saw something strange (part one),"The nightmares are why I went to therapy.  Usually my dreams weren’t scary. Maybe a little messy and Freudian, sure, but I was relatively nightmare free. When they started, I didn’t even know what was happening. It took weeks of waking up disoriented and with my heart pounding, feeling sick to my stomach, unable to think straight, like I had swallowed adrenaline in bed. A girl I slept with said I started screaming in the middle of the night. She asked if I had any trauma I hadn’t dealt with and then never messaged me back when I asked if she wanted to hang out later. 

Then at some point, I started to remember the nightmares. 

I say them, but it’s really only one. The same nightmare, night after night. 

I was in an enormous house, one I had never seen, although in the dream it was somehow my childhood home. It was nothing like where I actually grew up, which was an unremarkable three bedroom home in a planned neighborhood filled with identical tract housing. The dream house was different. The building seemed infinite, unending hallways and innumerable doors. Spiral staircases and the smell of rot. Marble floors stained with blood, rugs running down hallways that were impossibly long. 

In the dream I was running from room to room, up and down stairs, constantly moving but everywhere i went I could hear her. Footsteps behind me. A deep laugh from a smoker’s lungs, raspy and baritone, echoing at the edge of the room.

Ha.

Ha. 

Ha. 

“Where are you,” the voice called, sounding like a finger tracing my spine. “I want to show you something.” She drew out the words and they crawled all around me. 

What did she want to show me? I didn’t want to know. 

The dream ended the same way. I took the steps into the attic. I don’t want to go to the attic. I want to stop. I opened the door. I don’t want to go in. They say some people can control their dreams.  I’m helpless in mine, always pulled toward the inevitable ending.

The attic was dark and spilling over with children’s toys: broken tricycles, rotting stuffed animals, and old plastic cars. There were so many I walked over them, decapitated action figures cracking under my feet. Step on a crack, break your mother’s back. Rocking horses with too long of manes made enigmatic noises, not quite whinnies, more like human whining. Lightbulbs glowed from bare fixtures and I could sense her behind me. 

“Found you,” she laughed. “Tag.”

I didn’t want to turn but I had no choice. When I did I immediately recognized her. The terrible fast fashion mall clothes she was always wearing the first two seasons, a faded t-shirt and low rise jeans. She had the hood from her hoodie down and her hair spilled over her shoulders. She hadn’t had a recent dye job and black roots clawed from her scalp, invading the washed out blonde strands that inelegantly framed her face. Her long acrylic nails were the color of florescent day glow swamps. 

Something else was behind her. I couldn’t see what it was.

“I missed you,” Jasmine said. Her accent was Florida trash, parking lot amphetamines and probation officers. “You want to see?”

She started to lift up her shirt and I saw her stomach, swollen, large, pulsing. Something under the skin wiggled. She was laughing and then whatever was in her ripped her the taut skin apart, like curtains opening in a theater. 

She screamed, arcing animal noise, wild and inarticulate. Her eyes went milk white and a horrible wet sound started to come from the open wound of her stomach. A terrible hand, red and wet with blood, began to emerge from her ruined abdomen.

That was when I would wake up. The dream always stopped there.

In the therapist’s expensive office in Echo Park, they listened to me, nodded at all the appropriate points, and then explained how dreams are an attempt to process external life using internal logic. 

The house that was/was not my family home? This represented my new condo in L.A., where I had been living for seven months at that point. 

The sense of disarray? The chaos of attempting to adjust to a new world. 

The crushed childhood toys? The transition from the childhood of my career (where I edited a dumb reality show about pregnant teen girls) to the adult version of my career (editing an actual real, feature film). 

Finally, there was Jasmine herself. 

The therapist said she was the symbol of my fear that my old life was chasing me down. That the success I had was only temporary. This phantasm of her in my dream, the therapist said, was my unconscious anxiety over my new career, my new life. I had to acknowledge and confront this and, when I did, I could move on. 

Two months later, I was still having the nightmare and I stopped seeing the therapist. They weren’t helping. 

Sleeping pills got rid of the nightmares — or at least my memory of them — but I didn’t like the muddy feeling they gave me in the morning. I took to staying up late, mindlessly browsing the internet, trying to avoid why I knew was coming. At one point, bored, I mindlessly looked her up. 

Jasmine Bowers. Reality star, best known for her role as an original cast member on the unbelievable trashy and exploitative ITV network reality show, Pregnant Teens. She was born in Florida, which was also her current location, and had recently been fired from the show after being arrested in a road rage incident where she was filmed spewing homophobic and racist profanities. In a relationship with Alden, an unpredictable wannabe influencer and (terrible) white trap rapper with a predilection for inhalants who had served time for multiple misdemeanors. Their relationship was volatile at best. She was twenty six years old. Three kids. One with Alden. Two with different men.  

That was where I paused. Three kids? Didn’t she have another? 

I ran through her run in the show. There was season one, where she had her first child, Davison. The baby daddy left her immediately, didn’t even show up at the hospital, and then later died of an overdose in between seasons three and four. ITV ran a memorial episode where they brought in a hack tv doctor to talk about addition and the dangers of fentanyl. She had her second kid in season three with Brian, an unemployed grifter with a history of domestic violence and petty theft. They broke up in season four and then she was pregnant in season five, or at least I thought she was. Season six she got with Alden and immediately got pregnant, then had an abortion, then got pregnant again. So those were her three kids, but I could have sworn she was pregnant in season five. 

It was bothering me so much I texted Ian. It was four in the morning in California but seven AM on the east coast, so I was hoping he was up and near his phone. He responded quickly, which told me he was at work, killing time at his desk, trying to avoid doing anything. 

What’s up man, he texted back. 

Not much, I replied. Just had a quick question. You’re still at ITV right?

Ugh, yeah. It’s a fucking tragedy. I hate it here 

Ian was the only friend I had at that place. Both of us stuck together for hours at the office, holed up on our laptops, doing that stupid job. We had started an impossible project:  trying to cut the unbelievably trashy footage into something interesting. Our whole idea was we would create a long form movie out of the unused, non-dramatic scenes filmed. We would add extemporaneous footage and outtakes, long shots and quiet moments, like we were attempting to create a cinema verite film out of reality trash. We called it Gimme Kelter, after Gimme Shelter, the legendary documentary, and Kelter, the name of one of the girl’s kids. 

Come to LA, bro, I texted. We can hang 

You know I’d miss the bagels too much. So what’s up? 

I have a weird question. I’ve had a nightmare about Jasmine and I googled her. Do you know how many kids she has? 

Hahahaha you’re having Jasmine nightmares. Shes like a sleep paralysis demon 

I know I know. I’m sure it’s common. But for real, how many kids?

Ugh, let me see. Davidson, Jules, and then what’s her name. Brynn 

Just three? Wasn’t she pregnant in season five 

Ummm idk man. I don’t think so? 

Can you do me a favor? 

Fuck you. Sure 

Can you look at season five footage? Like anything extra? See if maybe she had a miscarriage or something? 

I feel like we’d remember that 

I do too but idk. Weirder things have happened? 

Bubbles and then — 

Yeah sure thing man. I’m slammed right now but I’ll try to hunt something down in the next few days

Bro, thanks so much 

Np. Just hype me up if you ever see Sabrina carpenter. 

*******

I was in a coffee place down the street from my condo when he texted me two days later.

Do you have a second to talk? 

I called him and we made very brief small talk and then he said he had to tell me some stuff. 

“I pulled up season five and looked through her scenes. She’s not pregnant in any of them.”

“Oh, ok, thanks for trying —“ I started to say and then he cut me off. 

“Hang on, I’m not done. After I looked through all the shows I went through the extra stuff. There’s nothing there.” 

“What do you mean?” I asked. I felt like the room had dropped ten degrees. 

“I couldn’t find any outtakes and unused footage of Jasmine for season five. The only stuff we have is just the stuff that was on the show.”

“That’s — dude, that’s really weird. Did they not back it up? Did they somehow lose it?”

“I don’t know, but everything else was there for all the episodes. Nothing missing for any of the other cast members. Just her. The whole season.” 

“Maybe she’s suing or something? Asked for it to be deleted?”

“Yeah, maybe, but there’s more shit.” I could hear the wind coming through the phone. Some of it obscured what he was saying. 

“Are you outside? It sounds crazy windy.”

“Yeah, I am. I wanted to get out of the office to call you. See, i searched for her this morning. Went through all the back ups. And then, after I came back from lunch, this guy was at my desk.”

“What do you mean? Some dude?”

“Some dude. He said he worked for ITV. Some kind of internal capacity, he said. I didn’t quite catch what he said, or what his name was, but he asked me why I was looking at old footage.”

“Umm, that’s weird as fuck,” I said, drumming my hand against the table. 

“Yeah, that’s what I thought too. I said I was just going through stuff for our project.”

“Gimme Kelter?”

“Yup. Gimme fucking Kelter.”

“I told you making that was a good idea,”
I pressed my hand against my forehead, closed my eyes.

“You’re right about one thing in your life and you’re taking a victory lap.” Traffic noises, horns and crosswalk telling pedestrians they can walk cut through his speech. “But, yeah, he seemed to buy it. Said we can’t release it or anything and I said I wasn’t interested in selling it. It was just a project. A way for me to practice editing. That’s all. He said it was cool, and left but uh, it was kind of weird, bro.”

“It sounds really weird. Creepy, actually.” The guys in the coffee shop with laptops — there are always guys in the coffeeshop with laptops; it’s L.A.— glanced at me while I was talking and I realized I was saying too many cryptic things. I got up and stepped outside as Ian kept talking. 

“Anyway, I wanted to update you on this, uh, for lack of a better term, strange development.”

“Thanks, dude. I appreciate all of this.” 

“The things I do for you. You gotta give me all the Kelter when I’m done with this.”

“You got it,” I said and terminated the call in the bright California sunshine. 


****** 

When I got home I looked all over my laptop to see if I had a copy of Gimme Kelter saved anywhere. I thought I had taken a copy when I left ITV but it wasn’t in my files anywhere. Finally a dim memory surfaced of saving a million things on a flash dive at some point and, after still not finding the flash drive anywhere, I realized i still had some boxes stashed at my mom’s house in Michigan. Impulsively, I booked a flight and was at LAX the next morning. The plane was packed and a baby cried the whole time. I stared out the window into the clouds and thought about how it would feel to fall from that height. Would it, for one second, almost feel like flying?

After airport terminal food and renting a mid-size SUV (which still felt absolutely enormous), I drove the forty minutes to my mom’s townhouse. She was on a cruise and I still had a key. I let myself in and watered the cacti, helped myself to a glass of Chardonnay and hunted through my four boxes helpfully labeled “stuff”. 

It was in the last place I looked, which I guess is true about everything. I poured a second glass of wine and plugged the flash drive into my laptop.  

The funniest thing about Gimme Kelter, I thought as I watched, was how not funny it was. Getting the actual emotions, the off camera conversations, the stillness in their eyes, all contrasted with the laughter of their children, or their endless cries, it was all terribly affecting. I watched fascinated as what looked like real life flowed on my computer screen. Of course it wasn’t real: just filmed moments pressed into a sort of reality. If dreams are our unconscious trying to make sense of reality, films are our consciousness trying to make reality into dreams. 

One hundred and three minutes in I refilled my glass of wine and one hundred and four minutes in is when i paused. There was Jasmine in season five, wearing a low cut shirt, talking to Rachelle, an old friend back home.

“Dude,” she said. “I don’t know what I’m going to do with this.” 

Rachelle looked like she always did, hungover or strung out, her pupils pinned. 

“Dude, I don’t know what you’re going to do.”

“For real,” Jasmine sighed, overdramatic as always.

“Do you know who the father is?” 

Jasmine’s face went dead as the camera tracked down to show her swollen stomach. “I have no idea at all.” 


******

So, more weird shit, I texted Ian. 

Bubbles on his end, then, can you FaceTime? 

I called him. He was in his apartment. An Under the Silver Lake poster on the wall behind him. I could see the white door with the three locks. His eyes were red and he hadn’t shaved that day, maybe the day before.

“Hey, you OK?”

“I’m good, man. You say you’ve got weird shit to talk about. You have no idea,” he said, talking in a rush. 

“Really? Because she was pregnant in season five,” I said. Ian slapped the table. 

“Holy shit. They covered it up!”

“They did! Why would they do that?”

“I don’t know but that’s not the only thing.” He leaned closer to the screen. “At work, I left my desk today. There were donuts in the breakroom. Somebody’s birthday.”

“Whose birthday?”

“Camden’s.”

“I don’t know him.”

“He started after you left, but the donuts aren’t the important part. The important part is when  I came back to my desk, I realized I had left my phone there. I went to grab it and I noticed someone had fucked with it.”

“Are you sure?”

“Yeah. I always leave my phone screen down. Every single time. But it was face up.”

“You think someone was trying to get into it?”

“I don’t know, but someone was doing something with it. I was worried you might have texted and there could have been something on the front screen …” 

“No, I hadn’t.”

“From here on, we shouldn’t text about this. Just phone calls.”

“From here on? You’re still into this?”

“Of course I am.” His face broke out into a relived smile. “When do I get to do something that actually feels exciting? The last time I did anything impulsive was when I went home with that girl with a neck tattoo and she robbed my apartment.” 

“I thought she just stole your MetroCard?”

“That story sounds so much more incredible if I don’t get bogged down in specifics,” he said. “But yeah, I’m in. I still want to figure what the fuck is happening here.”

“Me too,” I said.

“So what’s the next step?”

“I think I’m going to talk to the only person who can answer these questions.” 


********

I landed in Florida the next day. It was hot and sticky and I watched a guy have an epileptic seizure near the luggage return. I got an Uber to a hotel near the airport. My credit cards were getting killed on the trip and I thought I could save some money on rideshares.  

The hotel was the kind of hotel that lurks around airports. Generic rooms for people on business trips. A crowded bar at night. Guys away from their families, using apps to get escorts to come over so they can have depressing economic transactions. I took a shower and when I got out the room felt like a jungle, humid and wet, the mirror completely fogged over. I was on the fourth floor, overlooking a parking lot. You could hear the traffic from the interstate bleeding in. Outside, vegetation ran at the edges of everything, an overwhelming supernatural green. 

When I walked back into the bathroom I saw the mirror had unclouded, but left behind a faded patch of fog in the center of the glass, a circle at the top with a long straight line below it, like a balloon ascending up into the skies.  
. 

*****

“So why you going out there?” Marcus, my four and a half star rated driver, asked me. It was later that afternoon, and I was in his silver four door economy car, headed for Jasmine’s place. The sun was too hot in spite of the blaring air conditioning, pulsing through the windows in waves as it played hide and seek in between the tree-line. 

 “If you don’t mind me asking,” he added, in the pause where I was trying to decide what to say. “I’m not trying to violate your sense of privacy. It’s just this address is, uh, well it’s a bit of an infamous local area. I got warned about it from other drivers when I moved down here.” 

“Where are you from?”

“The old country,” he said, then, making eye contact in the mirror, he smiled. “The Bronx.” 

“This place must be a lot different,” I said as we drove past the familiar generic Hell America strip mall/gas station/nightmare vista. 

“You could say that,” he laughed. “It’s quieter, for sure. I moved down here during the pandemic. Shit got too weird in the city for me, man. I needed some space.”

“Yeah, those were weird times.” The pandemic still seemed blurry to me. It was hard to recall parts of it. There was a fuzziness to the days that felt difficult to recall. It still seemed unreal any of it had happened.

“So, are you from ITV? Trying to re-hire her?”

“I’m from there, but no, I don’t want to hire her. Just need to talk to her.” My phone buzzed:, a text from someone. 

“She’s not great at talking. Last time I took someone out there, she wouldn’t open the fort and then her crazy ass husband fired a warning shot.”

“Jesus Christ,” I muttered, slumping into my seat. 

“She’s crazy, man. Why do you want to talk with her?”

“I’m working on a project. Wanted to see if she was interested in participating.” I freed my phone from my pocket. The text was from Ian. Why was he texting? We said no texting.  

“So you are making a new show with her, even after that shit she said?”

“No, I’m an editor,” i said, wondering why I was explaining so much. “I’ve put together some old footage of her. Stuff that wasn’t on the show. I think if I want to do anything with it, I’d need her being ok with it.” 

“Hey, that’s cool,” he said, putting on his turn signal and pausing at a red light. “Almost there.” 

“Great,” I said, looking at my messages. The text was just one word. Mondostro. 


********

“This is it,” he said. I looked out the window at Jasmine’s large, unremarkable house. They had built it in the middle of nowhere, in the middle
of her heyday with the show, when she had endorsements and money was flowing in. Now, there was nothing like that at all and rumors of bankruptcy and troubles with the IRS followed her online. 

“Do you want me to hang here or anything, man? In case it gets weird.”

“No,” I said, eyeing up the home, staring at the way the late afternoon sun hit the windows and made them look like glowing portals. “I’ll be fine. Thanks, though. I appreciate everything.“ 

I got out of the car and heard its doors lock behind me, the scrape of gravel under its wheels as it drove off, leaving me to walk toward the closed door, my long shadow getting there first in the hazy magic hour. 

Before I could knock, the doorbell speaker came
alive.

“Who the fuck are you?” The voice was raspy and southern, immediately familiar to me from the show and (although I tried to not think of it) my nightmares. 

“Hi, jasmine? You don’t know me, but I’m from ITV and I just want —“

I wasn’t able to complete my sentence. 

“Fuck you, motherfucker, and fuck I-mother-T-fucking-V! Y’all assholes fired me! Get off my property or I’ll shoot your ass!”

“Jasmine,” I shouted into the speaker. “I’m not really with ITV! I was, but they fired me! I want to talk to you!”

A pause. I could hear my heartbeat pounding in my chest, my temples. 

“They fired you?”

“They did,” I said, then added. “The fuckers.”

No response. I stood there, unsure if she had stopped talking and was preparing to shoot me when the door opened and there she was.

She looked like she did in my nightmares, minus the swollen stomach. Her face was screwed tightly into a mask of anger and frustration, her eyes glittering. She was wearing cheap plastic flip flops and a hoodie over a logo emblazoned tank top. 

“Who the fuck are you?”

“I used to work at ITV,” I started saying and then I heard a low, deep pulsing behind me. 

“What is that?” I said turning around. The noise was getting louder, closer.

“Shit,” Jasmine hissed.  “Not fucking now, dude!” 

“Are you talking to me?” I asked, facing her, but she was furiously shaking her head.

“Dude, get the fuck out of here! This is not a good time!”

“How am I supposed to get out of here? I don’t have a car?”

“How the fuck did your ass get here without a car? You’re just some kind of super pedestrian?” She was shouting at me, spit spraying out of her mouth, like some kind of rabid animal, then her face went blank and her shoulders slumped. “Fuck me. It’s too late.”  The noise was louder and I heard car tires. 

I turned around to see someone jumping out of a red SUV with a cracked windshield. A guy in camo cargo shorts and a backward hat, holding an energy drink in one hand and his phone in the other, obviously filming. He had a cigarette in his mouth and took a furious last drag, then spat  the still smoldering cigarette into the dirt. 

It was Alden. Jasmine’s boyfriend or ex husband or baby daddy or legal adversary or whatever role he currently occupied in her life. 

“Jasmine, who the fuck is this?” Alden pointed at me, his lip curled into a snarl. 

“I don’t know who the fuck he is! He just showed up!”

“Oh, I get it. He just showed up right? Did he just show up to FUCK YOU!” He screamed the last part and then turned to me. “Why the fuck are you here, dude? Who the fuck are you?”

“Hey,” I lifted my hands up in the air, trying to make the universal gesture for “calm down” but also, perhaps more importantly in this suddenly extremely violate situation, to show I wasn’t holding a weapon. “I’m not trying to upset anyone. I can leave.” 

“Fuck right, you can leave. I don’t even know why you’re here,” Jasmine said. She was standing in the doorway. One of her kids was visible behind her, wearing an oversized shirt and holding an iPad. They were thin with oversized anime eyes and  acted like none of this was surprising at all. 

“You heard her, dude. Get the fuck out.” Alden stepped closer to me. He smelled like body spray and sweat. 

“Yeah, of course. I didn’t mean to be a problem for anyone,” I said. I was trying to back away, but he kept getting closer to me. 

“This is unbelievable,” Jasmine said. “This ITV asshole comes here —“

“You work for them?” Alden stopped advancing, lowered his phone. “You guys are hiring her back! I knew it! I told you, Jasmine, I said those sunuvabitches are going to come crawling back to you, didn’t I?”

“He ain’t working there anymore,” Jasmine said. She was calling someone on her phone. 

“Then why the fuck are you here, dude?” He jabbed an index finger toward me. 

“Yes, I’m having an emergency,” Jasmine said into her phone. “I have a PFA on my ex and he is here right now, violating it.”

“Jasmine!” Alden shouted. “I had to take to you! It’s important! How the fuck else am I supposed to talk to you? You blocked me on facebook!” 

“Goodbye,” she mouthed and began closing the door. An enraged Alden let out an inchoate wail and hurled his phone at the door. It missed, breaking the glass beside the door instead. Jasmine spun toward him. “You’re going to pay for that, you asshole!” 

“Make me!” Alden screamed back. Jasmine stepped forward, her hands clenched into fists, and brushed against me as she advanced toward him. She pulled back at our contact like it had electrified her. “Dude, what was that?”  

“What was what?” Alden shouted at her. She rolled her eyes. 

“I. Am. Not. Talking. To. You,” she said to Alden, patronizingly over-enunciating each word. Then she turned back to me. 

“Who are you,” she asked again, and her voice was strange sounding,  confused and hurt. 

Before I could answer, a car horn sounded. 

All three of us looked toward the noise, I think each of us expecting the worst, only to see a silver, four door economy car. The driver waved. 

“Marcus, holy shit, thank God,” I breathed and took off running across the yard. 

“You better run, you bitch,” Alden shouted at my retreating figure. I grabbed the back door and pulled it open, hurling myself into the car. 

“Go!” I shouted and the car took off. I looked backward to see Alden pulling up his shirt, a tattooed gothic script across his non-existent abs reading KOUNTRYLIFE, the handle of a silver handgun tucked into the waistband of his jeans. Jasmine stood beside him, her long hair damp and unmoving in the endless humidity, her face frozen and distant, her eyes unblinking. Above them heavy grey clouds gathered, a storm coming on. 

I was panting in the back of the car, watching her fade out into the distance, when Marcus cleared his throat. 

“I warned you shit could get a little weird out here, man.” 

We made eye contact in the mirror and both began to laugh, slowly at first and then loud and wild and unending, the echoes of it audible outside the car, rolling out into the coming night.

Mom had ignored my calls all day, then had the audacity to *text* me, claiming I’d never tried to reach her. 

I had a mountain of missed calls to prove otherwise, each one more frantic. 

Like now, for instance, the familiar bzzz in my jeans pocket nearly pushed me over the edge as I reached our front door. 

I was all set to give Mom a piece of my mind when a voice caught me off guard.

“Annabeth?”

Mrs. Wayley, our next door neighbor, was peeking at me through the crack in our fence with a gentle smile. Mrs. Wayley was well into her eighties, but sweet as she was, Mrs. Wayley had a habit of mixing up our names. 

Today, I was apparently Annie, though I looked nothing like my roommate. 

I was a looming brunette; she was a tiny blur of gold. I figured even with bad eyes, it was clear who was who. 

Apparently not. 

The old woman tilted her head, wrinkled eyes wide with curiosity. Her smile faded. “Didn’t you say you were moving out?”

Instead of correcting her, I smiled sweetly. “No, we’re pretty happy here, Mrs. Wayley.”

She shook her head. “Annabeth, you said you were moving. You told me yourself.”

“Uh, no,” I did the smiling and nodding thing. “We’re staying here. I think you're confused.”

Before she could respond, I yanked the door open, and made my escape. 

The house was unusually warm.

The summer heat was brutal, but at least we had air conditioning, and the pros outweighed the cons of this ancient house. Maybe a hundred years old, maybe a thousand. But cozy. 

Falling apart? Absolutely. But also cheap, and it had charm: a strange mix of modern decor and vintage quirks. 

We had two bathrooms, and the tub was practically a swimming pool. Case in point: not many people were welcomed into their living room by a grand Victorian era fireplace.

It was more of a hole in the wall that should probably be condemned, but it was fun to show off to visitors. *”This is where we keep the bodies.”* 

I used to tell the newbies we brought around for drinks. Apparently, the place used to be a psychiatric hospital. 

Which only upped the macabre appeal. I shrugged off my jacket. The hallway light was off, so I flicked it back on, dumping my backpack on the shoe rack. Which was emptier than usual. Maybe Annie was finally getting rid of her babies. “Anyone alive?”

“Nope!” a familiar voice bounced back. Harry. My phone buzzed. I pulled it out and glanced at the screen: Sure enough, a missed call, just now. From Mom. Beneath it, a text: ""Mika, please call me.”

I ignored her for once and strode into our lounge, the epitome of comfort. The windows were wide open, fresh summer air filtering through the blinds. The room was a mess: a coffee table cluttered with books and papers, our ratty Craigslist couch awkwardly sitting in front of the TV. 

The carpet was out of fashion decades ago, and the pattern rug in front of the fireplace had to be haunted. But it was home. I collapsed into battered leather. The lump sitting next to me was still in his pajamas, thick red hair hanging in unblinking eyes. 

Harry Senior was my recluse of a housemate who never went to class. Smart. Pretentious. Cute. Three words I’d never say to his face. Harry was a mad genius, and that was his downfall. He was Dexter without the laboratory, and slightly more unhinged. 

He even had the evil laugh. He'd be up at 3am mixing concoctions that could land him on a watch list while the rest of us were asleep. When I first met him, his icebreaker was, “Yeah, I'm trying to make the elixir of life.” 

Totally normal.

I knew Harry in two modes. When he had something to fix, he became hyper-fixated and fully obsessed. Then he'd eventually burn out and resort to caveman brain. Rinse and repeat. 

Despite the sticky summer heat, Harry was curled up with his knees to his chest, playing a video game in his very own Harry-shaped dent in the couch. 

Trying to remove Harry from his dent meant certain death. When my phone buzzed violently on my knee, I ignored it. 

It buzzed again. I stuffed it between my legs. Harry shot me the side-eye, focused on the final boss. He was doing it again. 

Trying not to smile and ultimately failing, the corners of his mouth curving into a smirk. 

He tried to shove me off when I made myself comfy, using his knees as a leg rest. I chose to ignore him, instead following his character as he jumped over a pile of corpses, dove onto a horse, and charged toward a looming, leviathan-ish creature.

“Soooo, what's going on?” He asked casually. I could tell by his expression he didn't care. 

Harry was our neurodivergent couch-potato. 

When things happened, he either didn't care, didn't notice, or both. 

Still, at least he was making an effort. 

“Mom keeps calling me,” I said, relaxing into familiar couch creases. 

Harry snorted. “So, answer her.”

“Well, yeah, but she keeps putting the phone down on me! She’s driving me insane,” I jumped up, restless. 

I was thirsty, so I dragged myself into the kitchen. When I opened the refrigerator to grab a beer, it was warm, sitting on the top shelf. Weird, the refrigerator was definitely on. I made coffee, but the milk was spoiled. So, no beans for me then. I slammed the fridge shut. 

“Did you guys break the refrigerator?” I laughed, tossing Harry a beer that he easily caught with one hand.

He shot me a dorito-stained grin. “If it’s broken, it wasn’t me.”

Which meant it was him. 

I left Harry to slay the final boss. 

I needed to shower and change into something that wasn’t glued to my skin. I was starting to regret wearing a sweater when it was teetering on 90 degrees outside. 

I felt my phone vibrate again on the way upstairs as I awkwardly jumped over Annie, who was sitting on the bottom step with her head nestled in her arms. 

I gave her a pat on the head. Annie was hungover; I could tell from her groan when I nudged her. Plus she was still wearing her outfit from the night before: jeans and a cropped tee, her golden curls spilling onto her knees. 

Fun fact: When I first met Annabeth Mara in my freshman year of college, I thought she was a bitch. She gave off, like, “Do not talk to me” vibes. 

Annie had a do-not-talk-to-me smile, so the whole time we were talking, I was convinced she hated me. I realized I was wrong when Annabeth grabbed my face with her manicure, turned me towards her, lips split into a smile, and said, “I feel like we’re going to be besties!”

Fast forward five years, and we were in our twenties. Annabeth was my non-biological sister. With a heart bigger than Jupiter, and zero filters. Annie's biggest flaw was her borderline alcohol addiction. I loved her, but we were planning an intervention. 

She also had a mouth like a sailor, and simmering anger issues, especially when she didn't get her own way. “I'm fine,” she mumbled into her lap. “I’m gonna go to sleep. Like, right here.”

I nudged her with my foot. “On the stairs?”

“It's comfy,” Annie paused, her voice collapsing into an audible gulp. “Also, if I look up, I, um, I think I'm going to throw up.”

“I JUST cleaned the floor,” Harry snapped from the lounge. I could tell by his tone he was losing to the final boss—slightly strained, teetering on a yell. It wouldn't be long before he started attempting to bite his controller, swiftly followed by begging.

“Don’t move her, Mika,” he warned. “If she upchucks, *you’re* cleaning.”

“Listen to Dad,” Annie murmured into her knees. 

Harry didn't have a “dad” bone in him. The only reason he had been christened the “Dad” of the house was due to his ability to cook without poisoning us. 

Annie rested her head against the wall, still curled into herself, and I hopped past her. Harry was looking after her in his own way. The puke bucket wedged between her legs was enough. Keeping my distance, I checked my phone again. 

It was Mom. Unsurprisingly. 

Five missed calls. 

“Mika, PLEASE call me.” The text lit up my screen. “Sweetie, you can't ignore me.”

I started up the stairs, sending a voice note instead. “Hey, Mom, it’s me.”

As I made my way up, I passed Jasper. Roommate number three glanced up from his phone mischievously. Jasper Le Croix: the rich kid with a soul. His hair was the usual tousled mess, falling over amused eyes that were the perfect shade of coffee grounds. 

His outfit was brow-raising; a suit jacket over one of Annie's old BTS shirts and jeans. His skin was glowing, a result of his vigorous self care routine applied every single morning without fail. 

Jasper had to be meeting with his parents. Otherwise, he’d still be in his robe. As well as being an insufferable socialite, he was nosy as hell. He paused to listen, a curious smile tugging at his lips. 

I waved him off, and he laughed. The voice message was getting too long. Mom had a withering attention span. I reached the top of the stairs. 

“Look, I don’t know why you keep calling me and then ignoring my calls. I don't know if there's something wrong with your phone, or—” I could sense Jasper breathing down my neck. 

I ignored him. 

“I keep telling you to use a different app. Texts are buggy. Just use Facebook.”

In the corner of my eye, Jasper was mimicking me, complete with exaggerated hand gestures. When I turned and shook my fist at him in mock warning, he threw up his hands with a grin, mouthing, *“Okay, you win!”*

“Anyway.” I shot him a *look*, and his smile widened. Jasper Le Croix had a shameless fascination with me and my mother butting heads, and inserting himself into *my* family drama. Maybe he was a Le Croix after all. I gestured for him to leave, not-so-subtly threatening his life with a glare. 

But he didn't back down, pretending not to understand me with manic hand gestures. “I've… got to go change,” I said, distracted by his flailing arms. “Call me when you get this, okay?”

I ended the voice note and stuffed my phone in my pocket. Jasper tilted his head, leaning against the wall with his arms folded. 

I often wondered if his obsession stemmed from not having a mother of his own; just a sociopathic father. There was a lot of darkness bubbling beneath the polished façade of the Le Croix family: affairs, secret children, and the never-ending feud over who would inherit the company. Jasper was the heir, after all. 

He, however, had zero interest. Like I said, he was a rarity, a rich kid with a soul. 

A materialist, yes. His closet was an ego-embarrassment. 

The eldest Le Croix held a simmering distaste for his own bloodline, evident in his tonal shift when he was around them. 

Jasper made it very clear he had no intention of inheriting old money. I attempted to side-step him to get past, but he was a six-foot-something roadblock with an impeccable jawline. 

He stood, brow raised, smug as usual as he peered down at me, arms crossed. “Your Mom?”

I rolled my eyes. “My *Mom.*”

“Emancipation!” Annie groaned from the bottom step. 

Jasper grinned. “What she said! Emancipation! The answer to all of our problems.” 

He winked, stepping back to let me through. I was surprised he wasn't demanding I solve a riddle. I darted past him before he could ruffle my hair. But he didn't, already descending down the stairs, back to scrolling through his phone. 

“You need to take your meds, dude,” he said. “You haven't taken them in days.” 

He was right. I had been putting off taking them. 

Shooing Jasper back downstairs, I made a quick stop in the bathroom, or what I liked to call, our swimming pool. The tub took up half the room, a porcelain rectangle resembling a roman bath. Our shower was awkwardly wedged into a corner, where my eye caught mold above the shower head. 

I tried calling Mom one more time as I rifled through the pill cabinet. I grabbed my usual: anti-allergy meds and the headache pills that always made me nauseous. I took them quickly, but another bottle caught my eye: unopened, with my name scrawled in Dr. Adams’s spidery loops. 

I didn’t remember being prescribed them. Still, I took two, as instructed, and washed them down with tap water. I checked my phone sitting on the edge of the faucet. I was sure I’d called Mom, but the call must have cut off. 

I tried again, and to my surprise, she picked up on the first ring. I slumped down, perching myself on the edge of the bathtub. “Finally,” I said, leaning back and crossing my legs. The metallic taste of the pills was creeping back up my throat and sticking to my tongue. “Mom, you really need a new—”

“Mika!” she cried, and something in her voice jolted my thoughts.

Mom was crying.

But Mom never cried.

“Mika, where the hell are you? We’re at the funeral! Oh God, you promised you'd come.”

Something ice-cold slithered down my spine. It was suddenly too cold. I shivered, but that creeping feeling didn't leave, skittering under my skin. A sharp odor crept into my nose, a combination of mold and my own body odor. When I tipped my head back, the mold had spread across the ceiling. The tub was full of cobwebs. 

I stumbled back downstairs. Everything was duller, a thick, hazy mist over my eyes.

“Jasper,” I spoke to the empty hallway, to silence stretching all the way downstairs. 

But he was gone. Annie too, no longer lounged on the bottom step. 

The stink of sour milk followed me, bleeding into my nose and throat. It was stark and wrong, hanging thick and heavy in the air. The living room was dark, windows shut, curtains clumsily drawn. 

In the kitchen, filthy dishes filled the sink. Old takeout cartons and crushed soda cans cluttered the counters. The couch was empty, and the TV was off. Two beer cans sat on the coffee table. One was still full. Unopened. 

“Mika!” Mom cried, her voice fading into the sound of ocean waves. I didn’t realize I had been just… staring, listening to the gentle crash of water against the shore. 

It sounded just like when we went to the beach. I was sitting in the sand, head tilted back, watching the four of us waist-deep in the shallows. Reality hit sharp and cruel, like a needle in my spine. 

I was drowning, being pulled down deeper and deeper, with no anchor to hold me, plunging beneath the glistening surface into nothing. Oblivion. 

I felt myself hit the floor, all of the breath sucked from my lungs, my body weightless, my fingernails clawing at my hair and down my face. My phone was no longer in my hands, but I could still hear Mom screaming at me.

“Mika, where are you? Mika, baby, remember? We’re burying them today—”

I ended the call before she could finish. 

Calmly, I climbed the stairs and stepped into the bathroom. I knelt by the toilet, slid two fingers down my throat, and gagged until the pills came back up, thick, bitter, and clinging to my throat in a sour paste.

Then I sank to my knees, my back against the wall, shut my eyes, and waited. After a while, a voice finally cut through the silence and my ragged breaths. “Why are you passed out on our bathroom floor?”

I let my eyes flicker open. It was too bright. The lights hurt my eyes. Jasper was looming over me, awkwardly crouched to meet my gaze, head inclined. He slowly reached out and prodded me in the cheek. 

“Mika, I'm not peeing with you sitting right there.” 

I stood, my legs unsteady, throat raw and aching. 

“Mika?” Jasper’s voice called after me, louder this time. But I kept walking. 

My heart was aching. The tub was clean again. The mold spreading across the ceiling was gone. I left the bathroom, pulling myself toward the light. Comfort.

Downstairs, I could hear the TV and Harry, his frustration with the game steadily growing. 

Annie sat slumped on the bottom step, her head buried between her knees, groaning. I felt myself sink onto the top stair, the world violently lurching. Jasper dropped down beside me. 

“Do you want to talk?” 

He shuffled closer, his voice surprisingly soft, his head flopping onto my shoulder. Jasper Le Croix was warm. 

“So, what did your mom say?”

In the back of my mind, my phone was buzzing in my pocket. 

I ignored it. 

“Nothing,” I said. “Just mom stuff.”

He hummed. “Oh yeah, Mom stuff is the worst.”

We sat in peaceful silence for a while. I liked the feeling of his chin nestled against my shoulder, his hair prickling my skin. Jasper felt comfortable. Right. I thought he was asleep until his voice cut through the heavy nothing that had begun to envelop me.

“Do you remember when you came to the hospital?”

I did.

The memory hit me hard: I burst through the sliding doors, skin slick with sweat, my heart jammed high in my throat. I slammed my hands on the welcome desk, gasping for air. “Hi, my friends came in about half an hour ago?” I managed to choke out.

The nurse nodded. “Name?”

I opened my mouth to reply, when a voice cut me off. “Relax. Harry's fine.”

I spun around and spotted a familiar face at the vending machine. Jasper Le Croix stood with one hand on his hip, the other jabbing furiously at the Coke button. 

The boy was still wearing his robe, a jacket clumsily thrown over the top. He wasn’t smiling; his face was scrunched in irritation, bottom lip jutting out. He kept trying to feed a dollar into the slot, only for the machine to spit it back out. When a soda can finally came through the flap at the bottom, he ducked, snatching it up. 

“It's just a minor injury,” he said, tossing me a can. Jasper cracked his open, taking a long sip. “Come on. I'll take ya to him.”

Harry’s room was down several staircases, along a winding corridor, and straight past the children’s ward. Hospitals gave me the creeps; Jasper, though, seemed right at home. 

I kept my distance as we walked—him sipping his Coke and me, having already drained mine, desperately searching for a trash can. I sure as hell hadn’t forgotten our awkward, drunken kiss the night before. His slight smirk told me everything I needed to know. 

Oh, he remembered it alright. 

“So, what did he do?” I asked, trying to steer the conversation away from last night. Jasper led me through another set of sliding doors and snorted into his drink. 

“Sliced his finger off trying to cut potatoes.” He shot me a grin. 

Jasper truly loved the macabre. He wasn’t even trying to hide his excitement. “You should’ve seen it! Blood everywhere. Harry was screaming, Annie almost fainted, and I was, like, running around trying to clean it all up.” 

We reached Harry’s room. Through the glass window, I glimpsed my roommate sitting up in bed. Jasper sighed, pushing open the door. “Here he is! The crybaby doofus himself.”

I had to agree with Jasper on something. My crybaby doofus roommate was propped up on pillows, legs crossed, dressed in those paper hospital scrubs, the kind that show your ass. 

Harry Senior had a hefty bandage wrapped around his hand. He kept glancing down at it, like the rest of his fingers were going to magically disappear. 

Annie was slumped in the plastic visitor’s chair, head tipped back, golden hair pinned into a ponytail. It looked like she’d dozed off. 

“Mika,” Harry straightened up, tossing me a sheepish smile that I didn’t return. 

I got the call that my house-mate was in the hospital, ran nearly five blocks, and almost had a heart attack. All for the loss of a finger. “You didn’t have to come,” he said. “They’re discharging me soon.”

His gaze found Jasper. “Where’s my soda?”

Jasper shrugged with a grin. “I gave it to the person who didn't slice off their index.”

“Asshole.”

Glimpsing a trash can, I tossed my Coke and slid into the seat next to Annie. Jasper dropped down beside me. “You’re an idiot,” I told Harry, though I was barely holding back a laugh. “How did you even manage that?”

“He was rushing,” Annie grumbled beside me, her eyes still shut. 

“The dumbass wanted to get back to his game, so he was speed-running peeling potatoes.” She sighed, dropping her head into her lap. 

“I’m living in a house full of lit-er-ral clowns.”

Harry, to my surprise, didn't object. He groaned, burying himself under the covers. 

“You guys can leave now.” 

“Nope!” Jasper propped his legs up on the chair, folding his arms. “We’re staying purely to shame you.”

“I'll call security,” Harry grumbled from underneath the pillows. 

“Oh, you wish. I carried you to the hospital, remember?”

Harry tunneled further under the covers. Pure mole behavior. “Because I was rapidly losing blood!”

“Children,” Annie muttered with an eye roll. She turned to me with a hopeful smile, and something twisted in my gut. I knew exactly what she was going to say. 

“Have you decided about moving yet?” she asked. “We’ve found the cutest house! Jasper and I are viewing it next week!”

The atmosphere in the room noticeably dulled when I took too long to answer.

“It's almost 2000 dollars a month,” I said, my hands growing clammy. “I can't afford it.” I straightened up. “I like where we’re living right now. We don't have to move.”

Annie's voice rose into a quiet shriek. “Wait, are you fucking serious, right now?”

“There's mold everywhere, my bedroom is full of asbestos, and if we’re being honest with ourselves, we should be dead.” Jasper surprised me with a snort next to me. “Mika, that house isn't safe anymore.”

“The tub is crumbling,” Harry mumbled from under the blankets. “We keep getting sick from the mold, and the owner told  us the damper on the fireplace is breaking.”

“I can't afford it,” I said, well aware of my burning cheeks. “Moving out, I mean.”

“I can pay for you,” Jasper said, and something in my chest lurched. Of course he could pay for me. “I'll pay your rent.” He nudged me playfully with his elbow. 

“Relax! I don't expect you to pay it back. You're my friend, Mika.” He jumped up with a grin. “I'm just happy we’re finally going.”

“I’m fine,” I said. I tried to smile, but my heart was breaking. It was getting harder to compose myself. “You don't have to pay for me. I'll stay, and you guys can go.”

Annie stood up. Her eyes pinched around the edges. 

“That's a health risk,” she said, her tone hardening. “We can literally move out right now. So, why are you being so stubborn?”

I bit back the words blistering on my tongue. *Because you're privileged*. 

I wanted to scream it, but I knew I’d regret every syllable. They had no idea, living on a different planet while I pretended I belonged. 

Sure, I could splurge on endless bottomless-brunches and fake a life of luxury, but the truth was cruel: I wasn’t like them. 

*You picked the priciest, luxurious house because price tags don’t exist for you.*

*Annie, you wanted a swimming pool, an en-suite, three bathrooms, and none of it matters.*

*The money is nothing to you, and if you actually cared, you’d have found a place we all loved. One I could afford.*

The words twisted and pricked in my throat, trying to crawl into my mouth. 

I swallowed them bitterly, my chest burning.

But the words followed me all the way back home once Harry was discharged. Weeks later, Annie had signed the new lease. She was already packing. 

Boxes littered our living room. 

“Mika!” She greeted me when I came through the door, jumping over a mountain of her shoes she was piling into a box. “Do you want to help me pack? I still need to pack up your room!” She called after me. 

I made dinner, each syllable sliding under my tongue.

I don't want to move. 

We’re fine here. This is our home. 

Jasper cornered me in the kitchen while Harry and Annie were in the lounge.  

“I really don't mind paying for you, you know,” he said casually, reaching into the refrigerator and grabbing a beer. 

When I tried to ignore him, he gently grasped my wrist, squeezing my hand. 

“Mika,” he murmured. “You don't have to be embarrassed. We’re your friends, and we care about you. Just let me pay the rent.”

I felt stiff and wrong. It was a mistake, I thought dizzily, the words suffocating my mouth as his eyes followed me, warm coffee grounds I felt like I was drowning in every time I caught his gaze. 

*Kissing you was a mistake.* 

*Kissing the heir of a psychopath was a mistake*. 

*Kissing the man I wanted more than anything was a fucking mistake*. 

I swallowed it down, but it just came back up in a sour, watery paste.

“Mika.” His voice softened. I shivered when his hand found my wrist, creeping down my arm, settling at my waist. His smile was warm. He didn’t need to say it. 

We both knew what he was thinking, and I was terrified of it. Still, I let him kiss me, softly and tenderly, gently pressing me against the refrigerator. The kiss was warm. It felt right, his fingers cupping my cheek, turning me toward him. 

I waited for it. Jasper Le Croix was already set to marry a socialite whose name I didn’t even know. 

The wedding was arranged for the summer, just after his twenty-second birthday, when he was expected to take over his father’s company. I found out through a brief phone call with his father. 

His son was taken, he said, and whatever “thing” I had with Jasper was to cease immediately.

Jasper knew this. But instead of telling me the truth, his lips curved into a smirk. 

His breath found my ear, warm and heavy, and then exploded into a childish giggle. 

“Can I tell you a secret?” he murmured, pressing his face into my shoulder. He was leaning on me, the weight of his body nearly sending me off balance. “Dad doesn’t *want* a fucking heir,” Jasper whispered. A shiver crept down my spine. 

His voice twisted, effortlessly bleeding into an eerie imitation of his father. 

“It’s all for show. Dad wants to stay top dog.”

“So.” I whispered. He wasn't the only one keeping secrets. I had my own bombshell. 

But it could wait. 

“So,” He murmured into my shoulder. “You've got nothing to worry about. I'll cut all ties with my family, and we move into a new place far away from them.” He  paused. “It'll be a new start. For all of us.”

I pulled away, my stomach lurching. “I said I don't want to move.”

Jasper pursed his lips and folded his arms. “Annie was right.” He grabbed a beer and headed for the door. 

“You are being stubborn.” He rolled his eyes, lingering in the doorway. “You're moving, Mika. I already paid your deposit. If we have to drag you to our new home, we will.” 

His voice turned sing-song, as he danced back down the hallway. “You *know* we will!”

Pinpricks.

His words jabbed into my spine like tiny needles.

“What?” I said, my voice catching before it rose into a yell.

My cheeks flushed hot. Tears stung my eyes.

“You already paid for me?” I trailed after him through the kitchen and up the stairs. “When I told you not to?”

BANG. 

A sudden deafening THUD splintered my thoughts. I froze, mouth open, breath caught in my throat. I couldn’t scream. Could only watch my roommate's body fall back, plunging down the stairs. 

His head hit each step with a sickening thud, once, twice, three times, four times, with the fifth sending him catapulting backward, his arms flailing, until he crumpled at the bottom. 

For a heartbeat, maybe more, I couldn’t move. Then reality struck. 

I blinked, my mouth full of cotton. “Jasper?”

I dropped to my knees, rolling him onto his back. My hands came away wet, warm, slick with blood. His eyes were still open, unfocused. Blood trickled down his temple. He was still warm. 

“Jasper.” I said his name like he was still breathing, like he wasn't limp and wrong, tangled in my arms. I didn’t realize I was sobbing until the silence crashed over me like a wave.

“Annie?” I shrieked, her name ripping from my mouth in an animalistic cry. 

“Wait here, okay?” I whispered, cupping Jasper’s face in my hands. He didn't move, his head lolling. “Wait here.” 

My breath caught when more blood came away, soaking my fingers and palms. “Wait. Please just don't move, all right?”

I stood, and my legs buckled. I hit the floor hard. Couldn’t move. Tried to crawl toward the lounge, but my limbs were heavy and wrong, and useless. My eyes fluttered. 

Something was… wrong.

I coughed, choked, rolled onto my side. Slammed my sleeve over my mouth. There was something in the air. I forced myself to my knees. Grabbed Jasper’s ankles and began dragging him toward the front door. There was no air, no oxygen, nothing for me to breathe. 

I opened the door, sucked in gasps of air, and pulled him outside. Then turned back for Annie and Harry. Harry was curled on the floor, surrounded by shards of broken glass. Annie lay crumpled in the hallway.

I screamed for help. Dropped beside them, shaking them. “Wake up.”

I shook them violently, screaming, until Mrs Wayley gently pulled me back.

But they didn’t move. They were so still. So cold.

They were all dead on arrival. I was sitting next to Jasper, my hands squeezed in his, when they called it. 

His lips were blue under a plastic mask, eyes half-open. “Time of death: 8:53pm. Cause: blunt force trauma to the head. Twenty-one-year-old male—” 

Their voices mangled together in my head. They didn’t make sense. I still held his hand, even when it fell limp. 

I still wrapped my arms around him, like he’d sit up and pull me closer. Investigators said it was due to the damper on the fireplace. It broke, and all the oxygen had been sucked from the air. 

Something like that. I wasn't really listening. The therapist prescribed me pills so I'd stop feeling sad. But I didn't want to take them. I wanted to stay with them. 

“It's not your fault, you know,” Jasper’s voice pulled me back to the present, the two of us sitting on the top stair. Annie was gone from the bottom step. Harry’s yells had faded from the lounge. Jasper  stretched his legs, letting out a sigh. 

“I know you blame yourself. That's why you're not letting us go.” he rolled his eyes, shooting me a grin. “You're stubborn, Mika,” he nudged me. “Always have been.”

But I didn't want him to go. 

If I stayed like this forever, sitting on the top stair of our home, I could hold onto them, just a little longer. 

“Okay, but that's not healthy,” Jasper murmured. 

“I know this sounds cliché or whatever, but you've got to move on, dude. Your mom is worried about you, and rightfully so. Why do you keep coming here?” 

When I didn’t respond, he sighed. 

“Take your pills.” Jasper stood up. He didn’t face me. I could see he was already crying, or trying not to cry, and ultimately failing. “You're going to close your eyes, and I'm going to go, all right?” His voice was steady. “No tearful goodbye. No regrets. Because it wasn’t your fault.”

It wasn't my fault. 

Something in the air shifted, almost like the temperature was rising. My phone buzzed again, and I looked down at it. I glanced up, and Jasper was gone. 

“Mom?” my voice broke when I finally answered. 

“Mika.” Mom’s voice was a sob. “Oh, god, where are you? Sweetie, it was a beautiful service. I wish you could have seen it.”

I slowly got to my feet, making my way downstairs. “Yeah, Mom.” I said. “I wish I could have seen it too.”

The words caught on my tongue when I noticed it. So subtle, faded, and yet there in plain sight. I crouched on the bottom step, peering at the smear of red on the wall. The world jerked suddenly, and I was standing on the top of the stairs. 

Jasper was standing in front of me, his eyes wide. “Just let me pay for you,” he said. “I promise you won't have to pay it back.”

“I'm not accepting 50K.” I whispered. 

He tilted his head, lips curving. “Why?” Jasper rolled his eyes. “It's pocket change,” he sighed. “I already paid the deposit for you. Annie finalized the lease.”

Shame slammed into me, ice cold waves threatening to send me to my knees. “You already paid for me?” I managed to choke out. “When I told you not to?”

Jasper shrugged. “Well, yeah. Like I said, it's nothing. Pocket change.” 

He grinned, and it was that smile that set something off inside me. 

I shoved him, not hard enough to throw him down the stairs. Just a push, sending him slightly off balance. 

“You're an asshole,” I spat. 

His lip curled. He was a Le Croix, after all. “Relax. Jeez, Milka, it's like you *want* to be a victim. We’re your friends. We just want to help you, you know? This house is going to kill us.” 

His eyes widened, frantic, suddenly, when he realized what he'd said. “Fuck.” He ran both hands through his hair. “I didn’t mean it like that!”

I saw myself lash out. Arms flying. But more than that. I saw red. Bright, scalding red that blurred the edges of my vision. He dodged, eyes wide, mouth open in a silent cry. “Mika, what are you doing?!”

I grabbed him. My hands clamped around his wrists, and I saw his eyes. Wide and brown, and terrified. And I shoved… hard. He didn't get a chance to cry out, his expression crumpling, eyes flying open. 

I watched his body tumble down the stairs, limbs flailing, catapulting down each step, before landing with a sickening BANG. I stood frozen, chest heaving, heart pounding against my ribs. Annie appeared at the bottom, a frenzy of tangled gold. 

She was carrying a box for her shoes. It slipped out of her hands. 

“Jasper?” Annie shrieked, falling to her knees. Her hands fumbled across his neck, his chest, then flew to her mouth. 

Her eyes met mine. 

“It’s… it's okay,” she whispered, when I didn’t move. “Harry! Harry, call an ambulance!”

Annie scrambled up the stairs, her arms reaching for me. They were warm. Comforting. She held me close, tears soaking into my shoulder. 

“Mika, it’s okay,” she said, her voice splintering. “Jasper’s going to be okay. It was an accident.” Her lips pressed to my ear, breath shuddering. 

“You’re okay.”

I nodded, slowly, dizzily. I was okay, I thought. I was okay. 

My head was spinning. But I saw Jasper’s blood pooling on the floor. I saw his body twisted in tangled knots. 

No. 

I shoved Annie back. 

She didn’t resist, like she already knew. Instead, she clung onto me. 

And then I grabbed her, all of her, wrapping my arms around my best friend, and hurled her tiny body down the stairs. That’s when I saw Harry in the doorway. His eyes wild. His mouth open in a silent cry.

“Harry.”

I stumbled toward him, but my apologies tasted sour. 

“I'm sorry,” I said. 

But was I? 

He didn’t scream, striding into the lounge and grabbing his phone.

“I’m calling an ambulance,” Harry whispered, voice breaking, tears sliding down his cheeks. 

He dialed with shaking fingers. “I need an ambulance for my friends.” he broke down. But the phone screen was black. 

I saw red again. Bright red. Invasive red. Painful red. In two steps, I took the empty glass from the table and smashed it over his head. 

Harry hit the floor without a sound. 

“I’m sorry,” I choked out. 

I dragged his body into the hallway, then lit the fireplace, and shut the flue. 

I waited. Waited for the air to thin, for my breaths to become labored. When my vision started to blur, I pulled them. 

Jasper, Annie, Harry, outside, one by one, laying them out on the patio. 

Jasper was still breathing. His gaze trailed after me, lazy, eyes flickering, as I collapsed beside him on the lawn. I was choking. And then his eyes finally fluttered. 

Once I knew he was dead, I fumbled for my phone with shaking hands. I dialed and held it to my ear. “Mr. Le Croix?” I whispered, choking on thin, poisoned air. 

“I’ve done a bad thing,” I whispered, crawling over to Jasper’s body. “Please help me.”

*“Mika?”*

Mom’s voice brought me back to the present once more. “Sweetie, are you at the house? I'll come and get you, baby.”

“No.”

My voice was choked and wrong. I scrolled through the notifications lighting up my screen. All of them were from PayPal. 

You have received $500.000 from Simon Le Croix. 

You have received $100.000 from Simon Le Croix. 

You have received $700.000 from Simon Le Croix. 

“You *bitch*.”

I glanced up, and there he was, sitting with his knees to his chest, dried blood on his temple and under his nose. 

His head was cocked, eyes narrowed, lips curled in a smile that wasn’t quite a smile, more of an ironic snarl. His gaze followed my finger through every payment his father had sent.

Jasper Le Croix wasn’t a hallucination this time. He wasn’t the man who told me it wasn’t my fault. The ghost I imagined.

The pathetic apparition who held me, told me everything was okay. He snorted, eyes dark, and turned away from my phone. 

But I could feel his anger, like a wave crashing over me. 

Not a hallucination. 

Because Jasper Le Croix would never fucking tell me that. He would never tell me it wasn’t my fault… if it was. 

Annie was back, sitting on the bottom step, blonde curls nestled in her arms. Harry was perched on the middle step, legs stretched out, arms folded, head tipped back like he owned the silence.

The lights flickered and then went out, leaving three figures carved into the darkness. I wasn’t hallucinating my friends anymore. I was seeing them for who they really were, the reality of them bleeding through the gaps. Who I had tried to suppress. Tried to run away from.

And they were *pissed*.",4,1758765679.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

Your mother, sisters, grandmother, aunts, and cousins (who happen to also be scouting for themselves) form a secret committee that meets daily like it’s a national security briefing (I'm not invited). They whisper about you, exchange creep shots of you from weddings and Eid gatherings, and debate your personality like you’re a rare stallion being auctioned. 


They track closely monitor your piety, this can decide if you deserve to marry or not. My mother once told me ""You missed two Fajr prayers this month, if you can’t wake up for Allah, how will you wake up for someone’s daughter?"".  Potential brides get scouting reports with advanced stats on my religious performance. Meanwhile you just… go to work. Eat shawarma. Play PlayStation. Completely out of the loop while this multi-generational task force negotiates your future.

A day later you're engaged and awkwardly trying to text a woman you'll meet for a few months. Then suddenly she's in your living room forever and you're 200k USD in debt because of wedding costs.

I interacted with it for months. At the same time I have been doing ifs therapy or somatic focusing  weekly for the last two years. I guess I'm quite good stuff it. Holding different parts of myself with compassion, getting them to come out and feel safe by being a certain way- in other similar words I I can sense how I need to be for them to feel safe enough to communicate with me. My therapist says I'm quite good at it.

I used my little talent to align energetically with that thing and let it possess me my tongue/face and right hand. I think I attracted it by looking at porn while on psychedelics. I stopped going along with it when it felt like I was suckin a d. Then I'd have intense sexual dreams and itd be ex gf's. Or just a mouth in a cabinet.

I read descriptions of dantes inferno and eventually learned I could envision the seductress of fire or binded by flaming chains and that made it retreat. 

It no longer shows itself as a person in dreams bc I will set it alight. Still I can sense it try to use my tongue. I think the energies have spread to other family members and I'm not sure what to do exactly with it.

We were seeing each other for only two months, but please hear me out. Lol. WLW relationship.  

Long story short, I met this girl on an app. We met up one evening and had an incredible first date. It was so unexpected.  We kissed and decided to keep seeing each other.  

We got along so well and found ourselves to be extremely compatible with each other. It wasn’t  just having the same hobbies or liking the same movies/tv shows. No. We were truly compatible in our ambitions and values. It was very genuine and easy being with her. We laughed and had an incredible physical connection. We talked about the future, what we wanted, difficult conversations about our family upbringings, me being in the military and being long distance (which she was totally fine with). Every difficult conversation we had, we handled it with such ease and always remained on the same page. This is why this is such a shock for me. 

Fast forward two months later, it started off with me bringing up one of my triggers at an inappropriate time. Little back story on her, she has recently been dealing with her uncle being in the hospital and needing serious heart surgery She is also a nurse that works back to back 12 hr shifts (I understood this because I was raised by a family of nurses and I know how strenuous and taxing her schedule is). On top of that, she is dealing with her overwhelming family and supporting them financially at the same time. She was under so much stress with having very little sleep, and chose to bring up a text message conversation that happened when I got a little irritated. But there was no yelling or arguing.

I tried to fix it by apologizing and being encouraging, but she felt overwhelmed and needed space. I gave her some space, but then proceeded to send her flowers and coffee at work to apologize. This did not help. I have a tendency to want to “fix” when things are wrong. I have a type A personality, so if I see that something is wrong with her, I immediately want to know what it is and try and help her. But I understand at the same time, this is what drove her away. And space and time is all she needed. 

After maybe a day and a half where I gave her time away that she asked for, she took time for herself and then ended things.  She told me she felt overwhelmed, pressured, and love bombed by my act. This is the first time I had heard this from anyone. I’ve never done this, and it made me feel so guilty for doing something like this to her. 

She also told me that “I was a good person,” and “we both deserve so much” and that maybe she “couldn’t give me what I needed.” But I honestly feel like her ending these things was a mistake. I didn’t tell her that, but instead told her I respect her decision and wouldn’t try and convince her. I didn’t want to pressure her even further because I knew it would make things worse. 

Instead, I took it gracefully. And this might not have been the right move, but I told her if she ever wanted to talk, the door would be open. And that was the conversation. Something important to note though, she told me she couldn’t be emotional over the phone and “had to keep it together” for the sake of her family. She told me it wasn’t a “light decision” but at the end of the day, she felt it was right. Yet she told me she would probably break down at some point. I know this was extremely hard for her, I just can’t believe we couldn’t talk through this. 

Everything has been almost perfect up to this point. We spend an amazing weekend together, talked about the future, and planned trips. I really thought we would be able to work through this because we had such a strong, genuine connection that was based on honesty and pureness. We didn’t expect to like each other as much as we did. I take accountability in my mistakes, and feel guilty and regretful. If I handled things differently, we would still be together. 

I’m really not convinced this is the end. It’s not like I’m going to keep bothering her and asking why. No. I would never. But I will eventually need to give her money back for one of the trips we planned for. I plan to wait a little over a month so things don’t feel so fresh. But I can’t help but ask her how she’s doing. Because I truly care for her as a person. She’s such a great and positive person to be around, and I’ve never felt overwhelmed or tied down by her. Being with her just felt so healthy. 

Please also note, I never lost myself in my relationship with her. I’ve been hanging out with my friends, planning trips alone (not just with her), performing at my job, ran a half marathon (plan to do more), and finishing my bachelors degree. We have always been encouraging of each others ambitions and dreams, even if it meant us being long distance for longer. 

I just have such a hard time believing it could end this way. It’s so unbelievable.

1npuhl4,https://www.reddit.com/r/ClusterHeadaches/comments/1npuhl4/atypical_presentation_or_not_cluster_headaches/,"A-typical presentation, or not cluster headaches?","
Hi everyone. I, 34F, have been trying to understand my headache disorder on a deeper level. When I hear other people on the Internet talk about their cluster headaches, it makes me question if that’s what I have.

Active since birth:
For one, I have had cluster headaches my entire life. My mom and dad watched my first attack as an infant, I punched my head and screamed like a banshee, so my parents took me to a neurologist early. I have neurologist reports from when I was a baby up until I was six that wrote cluster headaches and grey matter heterotopia on the report.

Cluster Period and Triggers:
I get headaches all the time throughout the year and it’s very hard for me to identify any sort of period to the headache. They’re just a part of my life and usually happen when my body chemistry is off. For example- when I’m dehydrated, when I’m on a medication, had too much coffee, had two little coffee, slept weird on my neck.

But by far my biggest trigger is light. For example when the sun is shining bright on fresh snow and it hits you right in the eyes. I could feel a headache coming in within 5 mins.

Medication:
Another atypical presentation is that for my whole life I have been able to abort my headaches by taking any over-the-counter headache medicine-Motrin, Tylenol, Aleve, Advil, acetaminophen. They all stop the headache from going into a full-blown attack. Sometimes if I take medicine too late I end up throwing it up and I’m past the point where medicine will help me.

My experience of the attack:
But the times I have had a full-blown headache it starts in one of four spots in my left eye- there is a spot where my pupil touches my iris, the inner corner of my eyebrow, the top arch of my eyebrow, and a spot on the inner lining of my upper eyelid. These spots are very specific and I can point them out when I’m not having a headache. I know them so well. I assume these are end points of my trigeminal nerve.

The pain will start in this spot and pulse, and gradually the pain will get deeper and grow more and travel to different parts of my head until it feels like my brain is swelling and can no longer fit inside my skull. The only opening for the pressure is my left eyeball and it feels like my whole brain is trying to rush out through my eye socket. The pain is grows into the most searing white hot throbbing aching inflammation of every soft bit inside my skull. I self injure to divert pain from my brain to another part of my body. I punch my legs. I scratch myself. I whack my hands on things. I repeatedly hurt myself to try to draw my bodies pain to a different spot. I moan and I writhe in pain. I swing my legs. I kick. I’m sure I look like I am getting attacked by an invisible demon. I can’t talk or form sentences to speak to anyone who might be around trying to help me. Any sound in the room I am in feels like it is screaming in my ears. This whole time I am sobbing uncontrollably, but silent, tears and snot pouring down my face because if I am too animated in my expression, the pain just gets worse.

I try to put pressure on my eyeball and eyebrow. I sometimes put so much pressure on them to relieve the pain that I feel like I’m going to pop my eyeball from the pressure.

This pain at some point peaks to a 12/10 torture level pain. Probably around an hour and a half at which point I will I guess pass out because I always end up waking up after the headache is over not realizing I ever went to sleep. So I guess I kind of blackout at the end of these headaches. The whole next few hours after I wake up I am hungover and groggy and not thinking clearly. 

I’ve never seen someone with cluster headaches who could take anything over over-the-counter and stop the headache if it was taken early enough. So I don’t know if this is atypical or I may have another headache disorder. I’d love anyone’s feedback.

1npufdj,https://www.reddit.com/r/BatFamily/comments/1npufdj/any_advice/,Any advice?,"I'm a newer DC (Batman-centric) fan, and I've been doing my due diligence to read most of the comics and watch the shows/movies and such, but all the different continuations and volumes/versions make me a bit confused when it comes to timeline, characters, relationships, who died when and when they came back (it happens a lot more than I originally thought...), etc.

Anyway, I'm planning on writing a DC crossover with another fandom I'm much more well versed in. I guess l'm just worried I'll come across as an ignorant author who didn't pay attention as much as I should have rather than a new fan trying to keep up with all the mind-fuckery and confusion that comes with the fandom.

I also don't want to fall into the general fanon characterizations (one that I can think of is Tim being a coffee addict or smth, I don't recall that ever being a thing in canon?), but I'm also *somewhat* unsure of what's actually canon and what's not when it comes to the more popular or widely accepted characterizations/headcanons. Another I see a lot is the way that most people write Damian (dialogue wise) is very different from how he talks in the comics. Okay, he does refer to nearly everyone by their surnames, I'll give 'em that.

I've read and watched a lot of the major plot points when it comes to most of the mainstream/more popular Bat-family members and I think I'll be alright when it comes to Bruce, Alfred, the Robins, and the Batgirls (Cass, Steph, and Babs since I thought I saw mentions of there being more?). I'm admittedly more shakey when it comes to Duke— yikes, tbd, more research needed.

This book terrified me into taking sleep seriously and honestly saved my health.

The wake-up call facts:

Sleep deprivation is literally akilling us. Less than 6 hours a night increases your risk of heart attack by 48%, stroke by 15%, and makes you 3x more likely to catch a cold. I thought I was being productive staying up late but instead I learned I was actually destroying my immune system.

Your brain cleans itself during sleep. There's this whole system that flushes out toxins and waste products while you sleep. Skip sleep and all that junk builds up, including the proteins linked to Alzheimer's. Suddenly those late-night Netflix binges felt less worth it.

Sleep loss makes you functionally drunk. After 17-19 hours awake, you're as impaired as someone legally drunk. I was driving to work in this state thinking I was fine. Terrifying in hindsight.

It destroys your memory. Sleep is when your brain transfers information from short-term to long-term memory. No sleep = you literally can't form lasting memories properly. Explained why I'd study for hours but remember nothing.

What I changed:

* Fixed my sleep schedule. Same bedtime and wake time every day, even weekends. Took about 2 weeks but now I naturally get sleepy at 10 PM.
* No screens 1 hour before bed. Blue light blocks melatonin production. Started reading actual books before bed instead of scrolling my phone. Sleep quality improved immediately.
* Made my room a sleep cave. Blackout curtains, cool temperature (65-68°F), no electronics. Your bedroom should be for sleep only, not entertainment.
* No caffeine after 2 PM. Caffeine has a 6-hour half-life. That afternoon coffee was keeping me wired at bedtime without me realizing it.
* Stopped the weekend sleep-ins. Sleeping until noon on Saturday messes up your circadian rhythm for the whole week. Consistency is everything.

The results:

* My energy levels are insane now. I wake up naturally without an alarm, stay focused all day, and actually feel rested. Lost weight without changing my diet. My mood is more stable. Even my skin looks better.
* The scary part: The book makes it clear that chronic sleep deprivation is linked to basically every major disease cancer, diabetes, obesity, depression, anxiety. We're living in a sleep-deprived society and calling it normal.
* I went from thinking sleep was for lazy people to realizing it's the most important thing you can do for your health. 8 hours isn't optional, it's necessary for your brain and body to function properly.

But about a month ago, (literally the DAY I chose to finally purchase insurance for him, so there's guilt there too because i should have purchased it when he started showing sighs, i just had no idea.. and i know i should have investigated more,) he starts having another anxious panting/clinging/pacing on Labor Day weekend Friday. Sunday, after 2 nights of him sleeping in my bed, (which he never did anymore; since he's been 9, he became an independent boy who likes to sleep in his own bed,) and my aunt commenting on his lethargic behaviour and odd stance, I brought him to the emergency vet. In the waiting room, I flash back to 2 instances I regretted not taking more seriously-- my stoic boy had fallen down the same flight of stairs twice in the last year. My heart pang'd it's final nail in the guilt coffin and I've been coiled and as tense as he has over the last month.

The ER vet saw him, and after a physical exam, diagnosed him with herniated/slipped discs, prescribed Dexamethasone+Gabapentin, and 4-6 weeks of rest, ie. no walks longer than 10m. A  crate was only recommended if he seemed to get rowdy, but that the issue was common and could heal itself with time. The first few days, treatment sedated him but seemed to really help his pain. Day 4 he was still on all the meds, but basically back to his normal self... this is where I fuck up again. I should have researched it all more then, but the vet made it sound so simple. I heard him jump off the couch one day, and we were basically back to square 1 (he has little stairs to access the couch, but he jumped off instead of using the stairs to get down as I assume he felt fine because of the drugs.) So much has happened since then, yet I fear none of it actually helped my boy heal.

After 3 weeks of trying to get in touch with our usual vet, I drove us over and spent 2h insisting they see Mo, which they do, and renew the gabapentin in oil form (which I don't think he prefers.)

The severity of the breakthrough pain (BTP) occurrences was rising, and the window in which he seemed to feel fine were shrinking. I was finally scared enough to move my ass. I was no longer comfortable with blindly trusting greedy vets, and felt the need to dig myself into what this was, how these pills work, and the severity of it all-- the reality of him potentially having IVDD terrified me. Really sitting in the fact that my bestest friend, most loyal partner, and only being who's always truly seen me, has been in potentially chronic pain for months, and just stoically standing it. Not letting it be known to me   at all, and also realizing I should have known better. Devastating. I had been living in the thought that the pills were minimizing the inflammation and helping him heal, not just numbing the pain signals. 4 weeks of no walks for nothing, his favourite (and only) hobby. During the first weeks of rest, I felt so terrible I started walking the alley with him a couple times throughout the day; the vet had said walks for potty were fine, under 10m-- I thought this was okay. Then last night, I came to terms with the fact I will have to crate restrict him. I feel horrible. And I fully intend on staying with him these 4 weeks as much as possible, plus we have an appointment with a neurologist and new vet in 1-week. I picked up the crate today, I am washing it now and plan on having him get in it after his morning potty tomorrow (it is 9.30pm, I feel I should let him have his freedom to choose where he sleeps one last time.)

I have also been struggling with finding the right dosing, as he seems to be metabolizing the drug very fast (1-2h pain-free, before gradually restarting to tremble/sigh/pace) and having pretty intense, 1-3h long BTP ... The vets recommended every 8h, but because of this and the half-life of 3-4h in dogs, I am going to try giving him 4 doses every 6h instead. The dosage he's prescribed to take per day is 75mg (0.75mL), but I know he can safely go up to 90mg (0.90mL) per day, if not higher. I've also been reading that CBD may help curb the BTPs. I will be testing this throughout next week, to find what works best for him.

So I guess I am asking for any tips on keeping him entertained/not depressed over the next 4-6 weeks? He's unfortunately been playing Rapunzel for 4 weeks already, and we're just starting over. He is quite aware and never really liked toys or bones, and he only has a handful of teeth left.. I can tell he missed tagging along with me and seeing my/his friends, he waits for me on the balcony from when I leave home, until I come back--sometimes hours in between. I got a M/L breed sized crate, and plan on moving him around the house throughout the day (following the sun, as he normally would.) I also know I will have a hard time keeping him **in** the crate when I'm home, as I know he'll feel punished. He has never been a crate dog, he had one when we first adopted him, but the door was open all day, and just acted as a sort of safe space for him while he situated himself. He hates to feel like he isn't being considered as a member of the room-- i assume because his size, but also how used to sitting with us at coffee shops or around  a dinner table (after the meal, ofc) .. and that's the last thing I want for him; that he feels punished for my mistakes. But it is all inevitable, and the guilt I'll feel from it too--how do I keep it from becoming a guilt spiral? Deep down, I know this hard thing is the right thing to do, but I can feel my stomach in knots even if this done out of love. His confusion tears at me.

Any advice or wishes of courage helps.. ty for reading x

Honestly, I did not expect the flosser to impress me.

After a few days of eating out and drinking too much coffee, I tried it one night on the lowest setting for about two minutes. My mouth felt very clean almost like I had just had a professional cleaning. I could not believe the difference. It may also because I dropped freshening tablets inside.

Anyway, the flosser is super compact and charges with USB. I only had to charge it once for the whole trip which made it really convenient.

I do wish the battery could be replaced like the old mobile phone batteries you could swap in seconds. If that was possible I could carry a couple of extra batteries and not worry about charging while traveling.

Back home I mostly stick to my toothbrush because it is faster but the water flosser still surprises me. I decided to use it more on weekends and when I travel. It feels small but makes a big difference when you need it.

We have a cycle: we have a big fight, talk it out, things are okay for a few months, and then it all repeats. The last ""talk"" was only a couple of months ago, and we're already here again. I'm wondering if my ultimatum for couples therapy is even enough anymore.

The current fight started over a movie.
On Sunday,he wanted to watch a movie with friends. I said our friends could only go in the evening. He told me to schedule it. I asked him what time and place he preferred. He said, ""You decide."" So I did. I bought tickets for 9:20 PM, considering everyone's logistics. He got angry, saying it was ""obvious"" that was too late since he wakes up at 5 AM for work. I'm autistic and often miss ""obvious"" social cues. I apologized. His apology was handing me a single french fry, calling it the ""friendship fry.""

The real problem is the pattern.
I work remotely.The day after the fight, I worked from 8 AM to 8 PM. Even though I was working, I also managed the house, pets, and meals, as I always do. When he got home, the first thing he said was, ""You were working but couldn't spare 5 minutes to take the trash out?"" He completely ignored everything I had done.
This is normal.Because I work from home, I've become responsible for 100% of the house and mental load. Even when I had an office job, I still did most of it because my work was ""easier.""

I hit my breaking point.
When he asked me to take a coffee break with him,I said I was working. He got silent and childish. I was so tired of always being the one to apologize that I just... didn't. I cried all day yesterday.
He sent flowers to our apartment building as a""sorry,"" but didn't bring them up himself. My face was swollen from crying, and I didn't want to see anyone. He cried and pressured me until I went down to get them. I felt ashamed of my face and of his cowardice.

He thinks he's the victim.
He's not talking to me today.He truly believes he's the one who's wronged. He wants a tattoo of Atlas because he feels he carries the world on his shoulders. But I'm the one managing our entire life.
He speaks to me so rudely that friends and family ask if I'm okay.We never order food I like. I'm constantly anxious, waiting for the next complaint about what I've done wrong.

My question is: Am I the problem for being too sensitive? Should I just ""toughen up""?
Or,as I thought: if your hand gets burned by the fire, is the problem really your hand that's not thick enough, or is it the fire?
I've been in therapy for years to deal with my own family trauma.It's helped me immensely. I think he might be depressed, but is that an excuse to be rude?
I'm planning to tell him therapy(individual or couples) is non-negotiable. But after 9 years, I'm scared. Is therapy enough to fix this?

TL;DR: Fiancé of 9 years makes me handle all life admin and housework, then criticizes how I do it. He communicates poorly and gets angry when I don't read his mind. He's now giving me the silent treatment after a fight about movie tickets, believing he's the victim. I'm exhausted from walking on eggshells. Is demanding therapy enough, is this a lost cause? Or am I being blinded by my feeling and I truly am an asshole?",13,1758764661.0,AITAH,33,0.84,False

1npu7ja,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1npu7ja/am_i_the_problem_need_friendship_advice/,am i the problem? (need friendship advice),"I haven't had a good friend in 5 years. The first 4 were in high school and I came from an area where I didn't really agree with the lifestyle, so I'm not surprised. When I came to college last year, I thought I met my people. They all live in the same state, and I live halfway across the country. I tried to check in on them, but not be clingy, so I texted them every couple of weeks over the summer. For the past month, I feel like things have been going downhill. I chose to live in an apartment this year, while they chose to live in the dorms. I met A and B the first weekend of college, and we clicked instantly. I met C later in the semester, and we also became fast friends. We lived on the same floor and it was a small dorm, so we hung out a lot and I got to at least say hi everyday. I set them up to live together cause I knew they were both looking for the same dorm situation. They now live together in a dorm 5 mins away form me. Here is where the problem starts. 

* When I try to make plans, I’ll get short replies or sometimes just get left on read. When I asked to make birthday plans, they didn't respond for 6 days till I texted about it again.
* I only got to see A after 3 weeks of trying, even though I was only asking for just 5 minutes to say hi. She said she was to busy, but she was posting on instagram that she was hanging out with other people. A saw J weeks before me, but she treated me like I was more important to her. She also had only known J for the last spring semester. 
* When I visited their dorm, I found out I was the last person out of all our friends to visit, even though I had been trying to visit since move in. 
* I’ve noticed them doing little outings together (like painting night) without me, and it makes me feel left out. We used to do even the little things together like grocery shopping. They said they're to busy to do anything with me, yet they make time for each other. I asked C if I could come by to give something back real quick, and she said she's too busy so don't bother till next week. 
* For my birthday, I invited them to dinner and a movie, and A said she couldn't come cause she was going home all weekend. Which I was okay with! Then I was told at dinner by B and C that A was at home, but when I went to check their location to make sure they got back safe, I noticed A was in the dorm. I told them that we could do another day if it works better and she just said she was busy. B and C came. Once we got there, we were in the middle of dinner (after another friend reminded me she couldn't come to the movie), C said she had to go do work so she couldn't stay either. It was a Saturday night, and she had almost 10 days to plan in advance, yet she was too busy to make one evening to do something important for me?
* Another time, when I suggested studying at my apartment, B and C looked at me, but continued to talk about going somewhere 20 minutes away- even though my apartment has more and nicer study rooms, plus free coffee during the day.

They know I get insecure about friendships because I've had people lash out at me over things out of my control (ie. cause they were lowkey homophobic and I didn't know). I truly have no idea if I did something wrong. I always remember the little things about them, check up on them if I haven't seen them in a while, or after things I knew they were excited about. I also ask about their interest, even though I know nothing about them, and try to learn. In the past, when I told them about high school, they always said, yes there were moments I could've handled things better, but my personality or behavior was never the root of the problem. Even my best friend, who's always real with me but we're long distance, doesn't know why this keeps happening to me. Should I even bother trying to save these friendships? Should I text them? Am I the problem? I have no idea what to do.",1,1758764439.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

And in April, he traveled to a notorious El Salvador prison to visit Kilmar Abrego García, an undocumented immigrant living in Maryland who was illegally deported under Trump’s mass deportation program.

In an interview at a coffee shop in Kensington, Maryland — interrupted by a constituent who thanked Van Hollen for being a “hero” — the senator complained that his party has been “too slow to the fight, too cautious, too timid.” He has ignored some pollsters who urge Democrats to focus relentlessly on politically safe kitchen table issues like inflation while sidestepping trickier ones like illegal immigration.

I guess it gives me some time to think. We've cleared some distance from the mob, but it's still chasing after us so we need to keep it going. In the meantime I've just been reading and thinking about writing more stories.

Might as well.



# Snowstorm + Defrost

A while ago, I know Snowstorm and Defrost moved in. From what they've told me, they moved from a village after the death of a major figure there. They said she was polarizing among her community after the reveal that she was some sort of virus, but that it collapsed further after she and her girlfriend both passed.

Neither of them were very happy when I met them. Defrost was taking out her anger on random sticks in the sparring arena, while Snowstorm just watched over her in the audience. Our sparring match was short, and she seemed a bit frustrated at the shortness of it.



I decided to invite her and Snowstorm to the cafe to get them something to eat. But I secretly wanted to be friends with them. They seemed like nice people, and I also was worried about them.

So we ate. Snowstorm went for fruit salad while Defrost ordered coffee and bagels. I just went for a breakfast croissant. Small-talk lead to me asking how their days were, which lead to them telling me that they moved though not much else. I was fine with that. I was learning about them regardless, and that was good enough for me.

After we all ate, we arranged a hangout for tomorrow. I offered to bring some of my friends along and they agreed. Then they left.



Next day was a hangout at the park. I brought Farfalle and Vortex. Learned about Snowstorm's interest in reading. I told them I had an idea for where our next hangout could be, but I was busy so we scheduled it for next week.



Next week we went to the library and picked out some books for everyone. Farfalle got a romantic novel, Vortex got some ancient stuff, Defrost grabbed this huge dramatic book, and Defrost some comics. I helped them check the books out, then we all left.



We continued interacting occasionally for months. The four of them have gotten along decently well, which is good because I'm not always there for them. Between my main job, my side job, and Scribble, it can be a little hard at times to make room for my friends. And I'll admit, I can be pretty worn out by all of it even with all my planning and scheduling.

But I want everyone to be happy. And what makes me happy more than anything else is to see that everyone else is fine. I used to not even know that there was anyone else in life other than me and my creator, but I'm a lot happier knowing there's more even if it hurts to see conflict and struggles of people around me.



# Pan

Pan is an odd figure to me, because I don't know them as well as anyone else I've tried to interact with. They're a lot quieter, not just shy but they seem outright avoidant.

I see them regularly in the cafe. They visit every other day, and they don't bring anyone with them. Anyone who sits by them leaves after some time. They usually order eggnog latte and other foods with egg, or plain foods like bagels. They seem picky, because I've seen them order seven different items over the course of a month.

Either way, that's not what concerns me. It's the look they give. It's something between glaring and looking tired. They definitely aren't happy, but why? That's what I can't help but wonder.



One day I tried talking to them. I offered them snickerdoodles and interacted with them. Pan gave me short and kind of aggressive answers for all of them, like telling me their hobbies consist of being alone and maybe baking. They're more of a listener, anyways.

Pan definitely zoned out for part of it, but I don't mind. I want to be their friend and to make sure they're okay. They're not like the mean people I've met a few times, they just look haunted by something. I've seen it before!

They asked if I was trying to get something from them with the cookies. I really wasn't expecting anything, so it was a weird question. They gave me a suspicious look like they were waiting for something to happen. It was awkward.



Eventually we finished, and Pan asked me to meet them on Thursday. That was... the same day as my failed news segment. From what I hear now, Pan and u/TTT_161 are dating now. I can't tell if they're fighting or not, but at least Pan won't be so alone now.",2,1758763684.0,WebSticks,1,1.0,False
1nptxa3,https://www.reddit.com/r/NinjaLuxeCafe/comments/1nptxa3/no_espresso_comes_out_of_the_luxe_cup_what_the/,No espresso comes out of the LUXE cup - what the heck am I doing wrong?,"Just picked up the machine today.  Making a single shot of espresso with what comes pre-installed in the machine, works fine.  As soon as I change out the basket to the Lux (large) basket and run it, the water fills up the spill tray reservoir and maybe one or two drips of espresso comes out of the spout.

The machine detects the Luxe cup when I place it into the grinder.  I remove it, use the included tamp thing and press down with the funnel still in place.  Remove the funnel, place the basket into the machine.  The machine is already on the Luxe setting, I select espresso then, Quad and press the start button.  The machine does its thing but, no espresso comes out.  The basket is filled to the top with water and the coffee beans are almost 'rock solid' in the basket.  I have to take a spoon / knife, etc to get the coffee grinds out of the basket to clear it out.

I've looked at the bottom of the basket and it does, indeed have holes in it just like the single shot of espresso.  I've run water through the basket and water does come out of the two spouts of the basket.

I can't figure this out for the life of me.",1,1758763627.0,NinjaLuxeCafe,11,1.0,False

1npttii,https://www.reddit.com/r/melbourne/comments/1npttii/rude_cafe_staff/,Rude cafe staff?,"Not sure if it's just me over-reacting but I'm noticing that staff at my some of local cafe's are starting to treat customers like a nuisance. I get it that times are tough and we are all stressed but it's become too common to ignore.

I visited a cafe this morning that I haven't been to in a few months. I ordered a small coffee and a custard donut, to which the server stated ""that's a nice breakfast... as long as you don't have it often"" -  I was too tired to reply and just stared at her in stunned silence. I've had an awful week with very little sleep and needed the pick me up but thanks for the diet criticism I guess? I'm a size 14 so not exactly obese...

Maybe I'm just being a moody, exhausted, PMSing Karen but the last few times I've visited this place I've felt like more of an inconvenience than a welcomed customer.  

Staff at the same cafe were also incredibly rude when some friends visited for an impromptu birthday celebration for one of their children (literally just a half hour to have a coffee after school and give the birthday girl some gifts). The adults ordered drinks, appetisers and fries for the kids but the bar staff were not happy about a few children being outside in the courtyard, accusing them off running around and destroying plants when they were simply moving around the tables to reach a snack. There was another group of older children there throwing a football around, completely separate to our group, yet we were the ones told to pack up and leave. Apparently bringing our own water and juice for the kids was also not allowed?

I've worked in hospitality and don't get it, if you hate people so much why run a cafe or restaurant? How do you deal with rude hospitality staff? Should I bring it up with the owners or just get over it?",0,1758763328.0,melbourne,33,0.29,False

That means coding nights and weekends, building AI pipelines, scraping data, and everything in between. No team, no virtual assistants, and no marketing budget - just me, my laptop, and way too much coffee.

This past month was a breakthrough for me. I got 1,850 organic visitors to my platform, which led to 43 trial signups and ultimately 12 paying customers. That brought in $847 in MRR, averaging about $0.46 per visitor. The best part? I didn't spend a single dollar on ads.

So what made the difference? Let me walk you through the tools and strategies that actually moved the needle.

## The Stack That Got Me Here

I used **Next.js** to build the entire platform from scratch. The learning curve was steep, but it let me ship features fast and keep everything SEO-friendly. My Reddit Pipeline Builder alone took 3 months to build, but it's now monitoring 50+ subreddits automatically for pain points and opportunities.

For data collection, I built custom scrapers for Reddit, G2, Upwork, and app stores. Manually collecting 75,000+ pain points and SaaS ideas would have been impossible, but automating this gave me a massive competitive advantage. Users now get validated market intelligence that would take months to gather manually.

To drive organic traffic, I focused on **content marketing around real pain points**. I wrote blog posts like ""How I Found 500 SaaS Ideas from Reddit in 30 Days"" and ""Why 85% of Successful SaaS Start with Pain Points."" One post hit #3 on Google for ""reddit saas ideas"" within 2 weeks.

For user onboarding, I created a **free tools section** with Reddit keyword analyzers and business idea generators. This became my main lead magnet - 40% of free tool users convert to paid within 3 months. I also keep detailed changelogs showing active development, which builds trust with potential customers.

## The Features That Actually Convert

The **Reddit Pipeline Builder** is my most powerful feature. Users can monitor 50 subreddits simultaneously with AI analysis identifying pain points and market gaps in real-time. Solo developers save 10-15 hours per week on market research, and the AI generates actionable SaaS ideas from real user discussions.

My **Infinity Canvas** feature completely changed how users approach project planning. It's a dual-surface workspace where they can visually map their entire SaaS project while getting AI assistance. Users report 70% better project comprehension and 85% faster decision-making.

The **comprehensive data integration** sets me apart. I'm the only platform combining Reddit, G2, Upwork, App Store, and ProductHunt data in one place. This gives users unprecedented market intelligence for idea validation and competitive analysis.

## What I Learned Building Solo

**Don't chase shiny objects** - I focused on solving one core problem really well: helping developers find validated SaaS opportunities. My Reddit intelligence suite alone has 25,000+ curated pain points that users can search and filter.

**Automation is everything** - My AI pipelines do the heavy lifting. Users get real-time market intelligence while I sleep. Building these systems took months, but now they scale without me.

**Focus on revenue per visitor, not just traffic** - At $0.46 per visitor, I'm not optimizing for vanity metrics. Every feature I build needs to either help users find better opportunities or execute faster.

**Developer tools need to actually save time** - My SaaS boilerplate saves users 2-3 months of setup work. The AI project planning reduces planning time by 60%. These aren't nice-to-haves - they're core value props.

## The Numbers That Matter

- 1,850 organic visitors this month
- 43 trial signups (2.3% conversion rate)
- 12 paying customers (28% trial-to-paid conversion)
- $847 MRR ($71 average revenue per user)
- 85% monthly retention rate
- $0 spent on ads

My users report finding actionable SaaS opportunities 3x faster than manual research, with 85% accuracy in idea validation. The platform now has 75,000+ data points across pain points, solutions, and market opportunities.

## What's Next

I'm doubling down on the AI features and expanding the data sources. The goal is to make my platform the single source of truth for SaaS market intelligence. I'm also working on team collaboration features since 30% of my users are small development teams.

If you want to check it out or have questions about the technical implementation, I'm happy to share more details. This month was my first time hitting real MRR as a solo founder, and I'm finally seeing the momentum I've been building toward.

I don’t have SHAM (Super Human Autobiographical Memory) and I’m not eidetic, but my dad was eidetic. I do, however, have facial recognition like I’m software. If I’ve met you once, and I see you again, I’ll remember.

When I say “I’ll remember”, I ran into a girl I went to school with in Kentucky in a bar in New Orleans when she was 8 and I was 10 and I recognized her after about 5 minutes. We were in our 30’s.

I walked into a coffee shop and said “Hey so-and-so” to a man I hadn’t seen in a decade before I even realized he was sitting there. 

I got in an uber and told the guy I knew him and he was adamant I didn’t, so I told him about when we called an uber together because it was pouring down rain and we were at the bus stop. He paid for the uber and I gave him cash. I even described his skateboard (he had this sick long board with a big drippy eye right in the middle and lime green wheels he’d just put on it that morning). Freaked him out, but he definitely remembered after that.

So, I’m curious if any of you with autism are like this and if you are, do you sometimes feel like you make more genuine connections with others than they do with you? 

I used to get really sad when people didn’t remember me over our interactions, but finding out I am autistic made me feel a little more like it’s kind of a super power. 

The flip side is I almost never forget the horrible things people say and do to me—especially when it’s people I care about, but I think that’s a different struggle for a different thread.

I started a position 5 months ago, I got laid off from my past job where I had an amazing team (I was manager) and a wonderful boss who supported me for many years. I found this job of analyst (misleading title I should be associate manager) and my new manager has been horrible at best and toxic at worst. He told me things like: you’re not here only to click on excel and drunk coffee the whole day. He also told me in front of HR (while validating my probation) : I have no idea what you’re doing 8hours per day, or « you ask too many questions ». HR took my defense which is crazy for HR. He also likes to humiliate me by email (he will point each mistake I can make and will cc the whole management team to tell me I made xyz errors), he wants to be in bcc of all my emails and micromanages everything I do. 
A bit of context: he arrived 4-5 years ago and so far from the 4 people he hired 3 people left and one was fired during burnout sick leave just after a few months. I am mentally exhausted and can’t take his criticism anymore. Thanks god I found a new job where tbe director seems very kind and fair.

By trade I'm a pilot. Many ratings and thousands of hours in dozens of planes. Most recently I was in management and trained pilots. I've recently decided to go back to flying. I also have a white collar professional side-gig that I do. (Not uber eats or uber lol!!!)

I’m a divorced dad with a 12-year-old daughter, and we do the 50/50 custody thing. My ex and I actually get along (I know, shocking), and people compliment us on how drama-free it is. Honestly, you could grab a coffee with her and she’d probably give me a decent Yelp review. Joking lol (we are divorced for reason haha)

After the divorce (my idea), I did the whole “personal growth” thing. No baggage, no “crazy ex” stories—just came out the other side in a solid spot.

I’m looking for a relationship where 1+1 = 3. A partnership that’s fun, a little banter, some random adventures, and actual teamwork when it comes to building a great life. I’m easygoing, kind, adaptable, and rely way more on common sense than textbooks (though I did get the degree).

I’ve traveled a lot (military brat perks), five continents and counting. Would love someone who’s adventurous, funny, honest, and can handle both a Bolivian mountain hike at 13,000 feet and a Netflix marathon without complaint.

I’m an extroverted introvert; social, but I also appreciate my recharge time. Not materialistic, but thankfully not broke either. I’ve got my own place, my own car, and a solid job. My dad raised me old school: build a guitar? Done. Fix a car? Done. Random home repair? Done (eventually).

I’m not in a rush, but I’d love to find someone fun, grounded, and ready to build something strong. And yeah, long-distance isn’t my jam; so Texas ladies, you’ve got home-field advantage.

I'm the real deal. I don't have any ""gotchas"" or weird crap where I misrepresent myself and you figure it out later and go ""why did I fall for this!"" So are you ready to have a good relationship that is rarely boring, honest, has good communication, and is laughs?

1nptolr,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nptolr,day 45: welcome to pearadise.,"i grew up religious. i read the bible back to front. i did bible quiz. was damn good at it too. but regurgitating mere dogma is different than living a moral and loving life, and people i went to church with were far from saints. i got into arguments with the adults i grew up around. we didn’t see eye to eye on everything, even much. they lacked forgiveness and compassion. a childhood friend came out in college and was ostracized. i stopped going before then. there was no love there. i’ve mostly been avoidant of the whole affair for the past 15 years. this is relevant. i apologize that this is a more scatterbrained post from me. i’ve been feverish and puking, trying to balance myself out and find the time. being sick outside sucks.


on September 11 i made it into Washington, regrouping at Tekoa (*tee*-ko) to set off on the last of my rail trails, the Palouse to Cascades. it’s about 280 miles in theory, not counting many detours. since some of it, i learned, is still railroad-owned land, some even private ranch, everyone does their own thing regarding access and maintenance. and by “their own thing”, i mean “frequently nothing”. so, fun time. there was also no trail across the Idaho border, a cool 15-mile road hike—never the best, especially in the heat. some horses came out to meet me though. the only thing open in Tekoa was the local pub. i tried to overnight in the “rest area” (basically just a pocket park with some tables and a sign) but another freak storm woke me up and, not wanting to repeat past mistakes, i sheltered in the restroom til it blew over. at least it was warm.


day 2 i met some local farmers grabbing coffee on the way out, who keyed me into the monthly food bank giveaway happening down the street. great timing. snagged some fruit, yogurt, chips and such. i hate how much food i carry because it’s the heaviest thing, but i can’t pass that up.


it was hot. not even so much hot as just shadeless. if you aren’t familiar with the Palouse, it’s wheat as far as the eye can see. alternate universe Windows XP-background hills of wheat. squat trees grow along the trail itself, occasionally a well-spreading apple, but not enough to keep the sun from sucking you dry. i got into the habit of taking a long midday break, maybe a nap (although a murder of wasps tried their best to prevent this). unfortunately a few miles later when the trail simply disappeared and i had to pull an audible and get back on the road for some eight more miles to Rosalia, i regretted losing those hours of daylight. you could hear wolves off in the hilly distance of winking turbine lights. it was eerie. a noise to my left made me jump, training my flashlight on what i thought to be a wolf or one of the cougars everyone keeps talking about. nope, just a massive porcupine. it seemed every bit as freaked out as me. i let it be and rolled into Rosalia in time for nothing to be open at all. at 8pm on a Saturday.



slept in another park, soaked awake again, not by rain but this time by sprinklers. something i’ve learned: if the grass is greener, you’re probably standing on a sprinkler head.


by the third day i was flagging. still no shade, few places to stop for water. i would roll up to farmhouses to refill only for no one to be there. i wondered how many miles away the closest human was. i would see a flock of wild turkeys gaggle across the road before i’d see another person. out of all the places i’ve hiked so far, even with no service out in the forest, somehow parts of the Palouse felt the most remote.


my day’s midway point, Malden, was burnt down in a wildfire five years ago. little has been rebuilt. the scant layout of RVs and trailers scattered about entering the town was not promising, but all i needed was water and a place i could lie down for an hour or so. wait, why do i hear music?... like live music. a *band.* a band was playing in the park, by the two newest buildings to have been erected in Malden: the spiffy new community center, and somewhat ironically, the fire station. it turns out that not only was this the anniversary of the fire, but their fall fest, perhaps not to commemorate it as much as to prove their resilience.


the town skewed older. some of the events on the schedule were canceled because only two kids showed up. i spoke with a mobile bike mechanic from Pullman who pointed out all the bikes he’d brought to give away… to no one. but there was still a spirit to the place. everyone was tickled at my being there, and offered me BBQ they’d had catered (massive score). i had some good conversations and kicked back to watch the band rip through three deep cover sets. people kept coming up to me asking me about my journey. it’s funny because it doesn’t always feel so impressive while i’m here in it, especially not today. but it does seem to inspire people.


“is it for a cause?” one guy asked.


“probably,” i replied, “i just haven’t figured out what it is yet.” he found this hilarious.


i had a choice for the afternoon’s hiking: follow the trail (another detour, at least) to mere dot-on-the-map Ewan (*not* pronounced like Ewan), or take a detour to the detour and road hike down to St. John, which would add ten miles but possibly be the last chance for food and sustenance for some 50-60 more. a local suggested the latter, so St. John it was. i wasn’t reaching either before sundown anyhow.


on my way out of town i got sidetracked by a fire-damaged trestle bridge and hopped off the trail again. a touring biker passed me, the only other person i’d seen using the route for three days. an hour or so later i ran across him setting up a pup tent in Pine “City”. he was in the middle of a dogged trek from Bismarck to Seattle, his third and final coast-to-coast section ride over the past three summers, but had no service and was frankly more lost than i was. we talked a bit about our route options, him puzzling if it was worth it to bike down the route i was taking (for him, only an hour). “do you know what’s there?”
 

“i’d assume one park. there’s a food store and a restaurant. there’s a church, too, maybe they’d at least have water, you know?”


“yeah, churches can be a decent place to stop in a pinch.”


we started discussing religion (i really should have been going, but). how even being so inseparable from the culture of certain regions, churches weren’t necessarily thriving, perhaps at the fault of their approach. i’ve always maintained that grace and compassion are the most important qualities a congregation could have. i’ve talked similarly with a couple of God-fearing hitches i’ve had. the general consensus was that you have to meet people where they’re at without judgment, which was refreshing to hear devout Christians understand and voice. you would hope that an entity preaching the love of God so adamantly would bother to live it.


ok, but really, i *had* to get going, because the sun was already setting and i still had TEN MORE MILES to cover. i bid him goodbye and started down past the grain silos, only for a pickup truck to immediately run up on me. “hey man, you good? you need anything?” asked a guy with a ballcap and a scruffy beard.


“i’m alright, thanks for asking though. just trying to make it to St. John.”


his eyes popped out a little. “...you sure?”


“yeah, i’ve been doing a lot of night hiking.”


“i mean… that’s pretty far… if you want to stop here and use the shower or sleep on the property overnight, man, i live here so i’m letting you know you can just do that…”


“i do appreciate it, but i’m trying to push all the way. i think i can do it.”


“well right on, man,” Beard Truck Guy shrugged. “i respect that. i come across some people doing this trail here from time to time. i don’t really like the money they pour into it when they could be fixing the roads that i use, or the community that burned down, but i still try to help people. but sometimes people refuse help, because i seem a certain way or i look like i’m politically whatever. man, lemme tell ya, i’m like Charlie Kirk from an older generation.” the Kirk talk, by the way, had been inescapable even out in the boonies. “but i’m still gonna help people. because that’s what you gotta do. even if they think differently from you.”


“yeah man, at the end of the day, i’m a human, you’re a human, we can work together.”


“and that’s why they call this America.” he grinned, gave me a fist bump and started to turn out. “good luck out there! they got a nice little bar down in St. John once you get there. grab you some sustenance.”


“you know what time they close?” i hollered. i’d been trying to figure it out with the cyclist, but couldn’t without service.


“10:30? 11 maybe?” said Beard Truck Guy.


“as long as i can get a quick beer.”


“oh absolutely. they’ll love ya!” he laughed as he peeled out.


well, he was wrong. several miles later, when i did finally get enough service to look it up and estimate an ETA, the bar closed at 10, only a couple minutes after i would get there… if i didn’t stop at all. i stop for about five minutes every two miles. my pack is heavy. i’ve been trying desperately to shed weight to no avail. needless to say, i probably wasn’t going to make it.


the road was windy, occasionally steep, and the shoulder came and went down to a sliver in parts. i was hauling ass regardless, probably the fastest i’ve hiked this whole trip, but still not enough. a bunch of trucks passed. i told myself that if someone did pull up at this point, i was going to swallow my pride and just take the ride. finally around 9pm, a little over two miles out, an F-350 coasted up next to me for the driver, a curly blond young whippersnapper, to ask what was what.


“do you think you can get me to St. John before last call? i’ve been hiking for hours, i don’t wanna miss this beer,” i said a bit boldly. this was the first time i’d point blank asked anyone for a ride without being in an active hitch process.


“last call…” he repeated spacily. “yeah man, hop in. we just gotta stop back up at the house and switch cars. my buddy’s gassing up.”


*“sickkkk,* man, thank you so much. i’ll buy YOU a beer.”


“oh,” he laughed, “i’m not old enough for that.”


switching cars meant pulling back up the hill (i’m pretty sure he had come down specifically in the truck just to check on me) into a garage that held not cars, but two single-engine prop planes. i was bemused. “my dad’s an agricultural pilot.”


“that’s awesome. you ever get to fly the planes?”


“a couple times,” he said casually. his friend was back. we piled into the sedan and gunned it down to St. John within minutes, where, thank the lord, the bar was still open. even with the mini-hitch, i still hit 22 miles for the day. i was exhausted.


“you sleeping in the park?” asked the bartender, as if that were the obvious choice.


“uhh… no,” i hedged, not to tip my hand. “i usually invert my schedule for the day and i’ll spend the night writing and taking care of other stuff.”


“hm.” she said. “interesting.”


(i slept in the park.)


i woke up still tired. wind gusted intensely and blew all my shit around, but at least the bathroom was open and had a mirror for a wash and a sh*ve. i didn’t want to do much of anything today. what day was it, Sunday? isn’t that the day of rest, after all. heck, there was a church a block away. maybe i should just go to church.


i walked around the corner. your basic side-by-side. chapel here, meeting hall there. a sign outside mentioned breakfast with Sunday school. what was i doing here? i figured even if the vibes were weird, i could fake it long enough to at least get some coffee in me and skip out. all my interactions heretofore with these white Christian conservatives have gone shockingly well.


no one was in the main building, but i heard voices i followed off to the side. the Sunday school room was a pristine throwback to dozens similar i had spent hours in growing up. it was mostly older ladies milling around the breakfast casserole and coffee cake, plus an extra-old guy or two and a middle-aged man in a pink button-up who shook my hand and introduced himself as Pastor Michael. i wasn’t dressed for the occasion, so i stood out enough that i had people coming up to me all over again and asking me things. so much for keeping a low profile. they were all quite nice though.


as we sat down for the lesson one lady piped up from the end of the table. “i saw you on the road last night. but i was scared to stop. just being a woman by herself and all.”


“oh, no hard feelings. i understand completely.”


“well, you’re not half as creepy as i thought you were,” she laughed.


“you were on the road last night?” said another lady immediately to my right. “i think we must have passed you too…”


“oh yeah,” said Michael, who i guess was married to her. “you had a headlamp on?”


“i try to be kind of visible. it’s dark out there.”


“maybe you should turn it around backwards,” said the wife, Cindi. i had kind of been ping-ponging between shoulders. oops. enough chitchat. it was time to start the lesson. psalm 37. they played it off a tape while people took notes. a slyly feel-good message. amidst all the bullshit, trust in the lord, rest in the lord, wait on the lord.


we briefly mingled between then and service, chapel murmur classically subdued. another person asked if i was doing the PCT. no, i’m not doing the PCT. people keep asking me if i’m on the PCT. which i haven’t really been close to, even now, and anyway, i’m on the PTC… T. i looked over the printed program. we used to draw mustaches on the staff photos on ours.


“so what are your plans for the day?” said Pastor Michael’s voice over my shoulder.


“day of rest, mostly,” i answered. “might go over to Ewan later.”


“Ewan,” he repronounced.


“right.”


“you want a ride to Wenatchee?”


i avoided swearing in church. “all the way?”


“yep.” this man was… serious. out of nowhere. Wenatchee is a two-and-a-half hour drive.


i truly could not believe. part of me said no. what was the motive? i had only started the trail, and i felt like maybe i had to finish it… i told him as much.


“well, think about it,” he replied, and went up to preach the sermon.


i had honestly been curious this whole time how it would sound. he honed in on John 4. a Samaritan woman meets Jesus at a well and he breaks protocol asking her for water, as traditionally, Jesus did not give a fuck. (sorry.) she became an early saint. “humiliation never heals,” said Michael. “the truth does. truth with grace, love, and compassion. God desires mercy, not sacrifice.”


ok, so i was in on this guy. even if we had to talk God for another 150 miles, at least he kind of aligned with my basic worldview. it was a refreshing thing to hear preached. i don’t know how much i believe in God still. some real fate has intervened in my life, i’ll say that. but i’ve often thought of the entity “God” as maybe a creator, hardly a redeemer: spinning a top and walking away from the process as humanity gradually tears itself apart in the name of. it’s bittersweet that religious conservatives actively living the love of Christ or whatever they choose has somehow become abnormal. but i have to be glad some people are doing it.


another extremely bubbly woman tapped me on the shoulder at the end. “someone told me you’re hiking?”


“i’m not sure anymore. Michael offered me a ride to Wenatchee…”


“oh, well, you should take it, but i was also going to say, if you like pie, my daughter’s wedding was yesterday, and i had to make about 20 pies, and i still have leftovers, so i would love to send you off with some pie.” i was hitting a grand slam here. she was just down the street, like everything here is, and pointed out her house for me to come by once i’d found Michael again.


i was waiting for him in the foyer when a familiar voice sounded behind me. “well, look who it is!”


it was Beard Truck Guy. “you go here??”


“well i told you the church back there burnt down…” he had indeed said this. also, he seemed genuinely pleased?  “good to see you man! where you headed off to?”


“i guess Wenatchee.”


“good for you. gonna pick? they need people.” another thing everybody kept saying.


“i hope so.”


“you’ll do fine.”


a reentering Michael almost bumped into him leaving. “i liked the sermon,” i told him. “and i didn’t mean to look a gift horse in the mouth earlier, if that offer is still on the table…”


“Diane’s getting you pie, right?” these people are beyond nice, but damn, word travels past. to be fair, it is a small group. “i just have to go home and drop the kids off and switch vehicles. i can meet you there in… 30 minutes?”


settled. so i went down to Diane’s. her husband owned a ranch where they were building a new farmhouse, but currently living out of boxes here. she fixed me a ham sandwich and a mean slice of strawberry rhubarb, talking a little more about grace. “i’m sure a lot of my customers don’t share the same views as me,” she said (she ran a coffee shop). “but it’s not like i’m their mom. i have no control over what other people do. you can still be loving to them the only way you know how.”


i don’t know if people in this town still lived this altruistic reality behind closed doors. but i couldn’t fathom how nice everyone had been. i gave them benefit of the doubt. 


Michael pulled up soon and it was time to go. we didn’t talk God the whole drive. family, mostly. he was ex-police, once divorced. raised foster kids with Cindi now. grew up in Montana, moved out here for the church position, but knew a lot about farming. we drove through the arresting Channeled Scablands, sprawling basalt butte formations of central Washington formed by historic flooding from Lake Missoula, which may sound familiar if you read my last story. wheat country gave way to foothills, then tidy orchards. the Little Big Apple.


he dropped me off on Mission. i offered him gas money that he refused. “have fun with it,” he insisted. so i did. i smoked, had a dipped cone at DQ and looked out at the layered mountains bathed in wildfire haze. i’d look for a job tomorrow. i was a week ahead of schedule. thanks, God.


the Wenatchee Valley is, in my opinion, pristine. there’s just enough not going on that you can really unfurl, and just as many reasons to stay anyway. a 20-mile string of towns connects Wenatchee along the Columbia to faux-Bavarian Leavenworth, progressing quickly from sandy hills to the jagged Cascades. a free bus runs its length. i took it all the way up to “Germany” to start by tooling around a few hours. for all the kitsch they’ve done well reimagining their railroad-fallout home into something new and unique. however, it had no real orchards, or at least none i’d found in my research, so i began the work search in the next town down, Peshastin. sleepy little junction, but you can still see real mountains.


the first orchard i tried said they were done. *hell of a lot of fruit still on the trees,* i thought. that wasn’t where i was supposed to be anyway. i went across the road. no one was at the locked stand, but it said open. they had highly reasonable prices on apples, melons, beans, sweet corn, and whatever you could shake a stick at, and an honor system where you shoved money through a hole in the wall of the cabin. i got $2 worth of goods and sat down to enjoy the juiciest, crispest corn of my life. the breeze steadied. the creek babbled. a little pink forklift named Lucy sat parked in the bay. perfection. too bad i couldn’t go inside.


i washed my hands to leave for the next orchard. when i came out two women were browsing while a third pulled up in a box truck. she got out, opened the stand and started unloading pallets of peaches. clearly the owner. i let her finish, went in and bought a Dr. Pepper, and asked after a job.


“you picked before?”


“not yet,” i said. “but only one real way to learn.”


“HA!” she cackled. “let me find my phone.”


a minute later, after checking out a customer, she was giving me directions. “up around the hill, red truck, my husband Dick is who you’ll talk to.” was it really this easy? was this also God? i thanked her profusely and went up to meet the big boss.


Dick was equally laidback. “you worked on a ladder?”


“some light arborism.”


“great. i just want you to know what you’re getting yourself into here. like you’re not just going to show up for a day or two and then leave.”


“no sir. i want to do it.”


“well!” he grinned, bemused. “we start at 6:30. i’ll have the paperwork drawn up for you in the morning.”


i walked off aglow. i thought i could make this happen, but i thought it would take a lot longer. within 24 hours i had completely fast-tracked phase 2 of my grand plan (there’s barely a plan). i was where i wanted to go, and now i finally had another job. it was September 15. i left Ohio five weeks ago.


got my first hotel room to celebrate. that definitely set me back, and maybe i shouldn’t have, but i wanted to be well-rested. i was so tired i didn’t even leave for dinner. at 5am i hauled my ass up to walk down the highway in the dark and work the harvest.


the job certainly isn’t glamorous. it’s $20/hour, 40 hours over six days. for all the apple talk, it’s actually anjou pears we’re harvesting. you pick into 25-bushel bins, or around 1400 pounds of pears. they are never full. there’s always a pear you didn’t get. if you can’t see it, there’s probably a pear in the way. every part of the environment—foot-high grass and bindweed, sprinkler heads, mounds of fallen fruit, the dense gnarled trees themselves—fight and thwart you not to relinquish the bounty of pears. they don’t seem to want to be picked. when you finally manage to wrestle the ladder into the right position around clinging limbs, you’ll either get clotheslined with a branch on your way around or a pear dropped on your head for good measure. sometimes they’ll detach just for looking at them wrong. the biggest, best pears of all always seem to fall of their own will.


i’m the only white guy on a team of 20. one of the youngest but it’s hard to tell. the guys are fast. it’s a talent to be able to keep so many in hand at one time and they do it with deftness and dexterity. guys like Fabian and Oscar put up unreal numbers. they don’t seem to resent me for sucking. everyone has been nice. we have a good cop/bad cop foreman situation, but even the stern one has his moments. the main crew is just a bunch of shit-shooters. everyone has their bluetooth speaker and some catchphrase they holler in the groves. one guy just yells *WOOO* every fifteen minutes. for the weekend they gave me a shot of tequila. i did the hand salt thing. they lost their minds.


the two Juans speak the best English. Juan is from Mexico. Juan was born here in Washington. Juan reminds me of my best friend growing up. Juan is about to go off to Army MEPS. Juan lives in Peshastin. Juan lives in Leavenworth. Juan gives me rides down to the bus stop every day. Juan can hike up Saddle Rock in fifteen minutes. Juan has three kids. Juan is 19.


Wednesday i got sick. was so weak i could barely drag myself back downhill after being allowed to go home. puke city. it was awful. i went back into Wenatchee and passed out in the grass for five hours in full sun until the fever broke a little. it was still another day before i could really keep down solid food.


i slogged it out until Saturday and when i finally felt well enough i scoped the shelter a bus stop pal had told me about. it was the first time i’d used one this journey. feel like i should’ve done that before the hotel room. it’s not like i care about privacy, but working at a shelter some years back made me ironically leery of them. too many rules and red tape, callous staff members, unhinged behavior. just as much darkness can go down in the confines of four walls as on the streets. but i took my chances and honestly? some of the best sleep i’ve ever had. no one stirred a peep. everyone was quiet and respectful.


been here ten days now. coming off the illness. no rain, mid 70s. could be worse. every day is a little strange. one day they moved us around three times. i get lost a lot. there is too much orchard. i zone out as i pick. the pears make me think of childhood. the house i grew up in. slicing up juicy Bartletts. overripened from their own possibility. the big grocery store i wanted to work at when we took a tour for school. young mind blown by the varieties of pears. i ended up working at a grocery store 20 years later, but resented it. then again, i wasn’t in the produce department.


there is something reassuring about still being a part of that process, upstream. 40% of America’s pears come from the Wenatchee Valley. there’s a chance one’s on your counter now. even if it’s hard and even if i’m not terribly good at it, i’ll be a proud little temporary stitch in the great agricultural tapestry.


but payday can’t come soon enough. i’m at essentially zero until then, relying on different food banks, hiking on weekends, mostly spending my free time finding places to write or sleep. this is just where i’m at right now. it’s beautiful nonetheless. every day when i look out over the treetops at the mountains i thank… God? that i’m here. do i believe in God again? i’m not, like, A Christian, but i do feel as if he brought me here. my journey definitely retains some fated element. now this here is another one of those tests of faith they talk about. just have to make it through the harvest. if anything, i know i believe in the kindness of others. and i believe in pears.


ten miles to our north, a 30,000-acre wildfire smolders, throwing horror-film fog on the highway in the predawn, turning the daylight sunset pink. another, half its size, ten miles to the south. it always feels later than it is.


we all try not to think about it. if disaster does strike, it’ll still be a while.

We talked a lot during our time in the LDR and it was very consistent until about 2 months before the breakup. I was already planning on going to see her at some point during those 2 months and she wanted it to be a surprise, so she didn't want me to tell her the day. So long story short I showed up just to find out that she was kissing another guy and then walked into her apartment together. Honestly that really crushed me for a long time as she never seemed like the kind of person to do so. Since then, I am now fully healed but I am not sure where to go now...but one of the best things about being in an LDR was it was endless messaging vs actually talking it all out and it just made it easier, and I miss that.

Advice?,"Hi everyone, I recently started working at a corporate Starbucks, and I feel really overwhelmed. Before this, I worked over 7 months at a licensed Starbucks inside Target, and even though I thought that experience would help me, everything here feels very different.

At Target, there was just one bar, small space, no drive-thru. Now there’s the drive-thru, the POS system is different, and the overall vibe is just not the same. I also feel like I waste too much time writing on cups I’m starting to hate it lol. At Target, we didn’t write on cups except for the name, so I’m not used to it. Printed orders (the stickers that come out and get pasted on the cup) are new to me. At my old store, I used to just write the order on the cup, so I get confused now because the stickers don’t follow the same order as the boxes (decaf, shots, syrup, milk, custom, drink). For example, if a customer asks for decaf in the middle of the order, it shows up in the middle on the sticker instead of at the top like it would be on the cup, so first I assume they want regular shots and then I have to remake it once I find it was supposed to be decaf (or blonde). 
The headset is another thing, I find it really distracting. I’m trying to make drinks while hearing new orders come in at the same time, plus baristas chatting through the headset, and I can’t focus.
On bar (hot or cold), I kind of know what I’m doing, but following the stickers still slows me down. I’m also not used to how baristas set up their stations here, so I’m always trying to figure out where things are.

What stresses me the most is that I realized some drinks I was taught differently at Target are “wrong” here. For example: Frappuccinos: At Target I was taught to just put everything in the blender (except milk, which is measured to the first line). Here they do it differently, they put the coffee base in the cup with the milk. If I do it my way, they make me toss it and remake it. 
Iced matcha: At Target, I used to blend everything in the blender (without the ice), then pour it over the ice in the cup. Here they just mix it all together, so I do it that way because I’m afraid they’ll make me toss it.
I honestly don’t think these little differences change the taste that much, but I might be wrong. Either way, I hate wasting drinks just because it’s not “exact.” They even told me if I forget to write a message on an iced drink, I have to toss the whole thing and remake it just so the message is there, which feels kind of dumb to me.
I’m also relearning recipes and pumps. Like today I found out caramel macchiatos get one less pump, and I felt so stupid for not knowing that. My coworkers aren’t rude, but I feel really pressured when I work with them, and sometimes I go home stressed.

Some nights I feel ready for my shift, but other nights I feel really nervous and even think about applying back to a licensed store. At the same time, I feel like maybe I just need more time to get used to corporate.
So my question is: is it normal to feel this overwhelmed when moving from licensed to corporate? Did it get better for you with time? And most importantly, how can I improve or what kind of mindset should I have so I can work smoother shifts and be a helpful partner instead of someone who slows everyone down?

1nptlhl,https://www.reddit.com/r/ausbusiness/comments/1nptlhl/local_marketing_mastery_for_aussie_startups/,Local Marketing Mastery for Aussie Startups & Service Businesses: What's Actually Working in 2025? 🚀,"G'day entrepreneurs!



After helping dozens of Aussie startups and service businesses crack the local marketing code, I've seen some fascinating patterns emerge. While everyone's chasing the latest growth hacks, the businesses quietly dominating their local markets are using surprisingly practical (and often overlooked) tactics.



\*\*What I'm seeing work RIGHT NOW:\*\*



\*\*• Hyper-Local Digital Fencing\*\*

A Melbourne coffee roastery used geofencing around competing cafes within 2km. Result? 35% increase in foot traffic and 180+ new Google reviews in 8 weeks. The secret? They targeted coffee lovers at the exact moment they were thinking about coffee.



\*\*• Community Partnership Networks\*\*

A Sydney fitness startup partnered with local physiotherapists, nutritionists, and wellness coaches. Instead of competing, they created a referral ecosystem. Each partner got 15-20 qualified leads monthly, and the startup's customer lifetime value increased by 40%.



\*\*• Micro-Influencer Authority Building\*\*

A Brisbane accounting firm started creating TikToks explaining tax changes for small businesses. 6 months later: 50K followers and a waitlist of clients. The founder is now considered THE go-to tax expert for local startups.



\*\*• Strategic Local SEO Dominance\*\*

A Perth home services startup identified 47 suburb-specific keywords their competitors ignored. They created location pages for each area with genuine local content. Within 12 months: #1 ranking for ""handyman \[suburb name\]"" across Perth's northern beaches.



\*\*What's NOT working anymore:\*\*

\- Generic Facebook boosted posts

\- Spray-and-pray networking events  

\- One-size-fits-all Google Ads

\- Buying fake reviews (Google's getting scary good at detecting these)



\*\*The Entrepreneur's Edge:\*\*



Unlike established businesses, startups have unique advantages in local marketing:



1. \*\*Speed & Agility\*\* - You can pivot tactics weekly based on what's working

2. \*\*Founder Story Power\*\* - People connect with the person behind the brand

3. \*\*Innovation Freedom\*\* - You can test unconventional approaches big companies won't risk

4. \*\*Digital Native Advantage\*\* - Most local competitors are still stuck in 2015



\*\*Questions for the community:\*\*



• What local marketing tactics have surprised you with their effectiveness?

• Are you using AI tools for local customer acquisition? Which ones?

• How are you measuring local marketing ROI beyond just ""leads generated""?

• What's your biggest local marketing challenge right now?



\*\*Specific to service businesses:\*\*

If you're in trades, consulting, health services, or B2B - the hyper-local approach is even more critical. Your customers aren't just buying a service; they're buying trust, convenience, and local credibility.



\*\*My challenge to you:\*\* Pick ONE tactic from above and test it for 30 days. Document everything. The businesses winning locally in 2025 are the ones treating marketing like a lab experiment, not a guessing game.



What's been your experience? Drop your wins, fails, and ""why didn't I think of that"" moments below. Let's help each other crack the local marketing code! 



\*P.S. - Happy to dive deeper into any of these tactics if there's interest. The devil's always in the implementation details.\*",1,1758762682.0,ausbusiness,0,1.0,False

as i've stated before, i've played on heavier load orders and havent had this issue but i'm still posting the mod list just in case there is something i'm missing. i've also tried using previous versions of some utility mods such as johnnyguitar and jip ln as well as the script extrender. enabling everything all the way from the TTW mod to the content separator causes no issues, it's not until i start enabling mods from the other separators like just assorted mods, sometimes even the mod config menu, NVAO mods and visual improvement mods such as NVR, lumen, afterglow, etc. as well as most of the B42 project mods and essentially the entire animation and LOD separators. if there is something i am missing, must fix, or must change please let me know as i am incredibly over trying to figure out what is going on with my FNV, and any support would be greatly appreciated.",1,1758762627.0,falloutnewvegas,0,1.0,False

These are around 1000+ new but I haven't seen much about them.

I’m spending a ton on whole fresh coffee beans that I grind myself and I feel like the espresso i’m getting from the moka pot is not good enough quality for the amount of effort and money i’m putting into it. I’m aware of the Moka Pot limitations and I think it’s time I purchased an espresso machine. I saw on Amazon there’s a sale right now for a “Neretva 20 bar espresso maker” for 130$ Canadian and i’m debating if I should make the purchase. I’d say around 100-200$ budget max would be what I’d want to spend. I know nothing about espresso machines and I don’t know if a machine that cheap is even worth it.

My question is basically if it’s even worth the upgrade to a budget espresso machine and if I buy that one if there will actually be a noticeable difference to taste and quality. I’m not looking to spend tons on a machine, I just kind of want something that will offer a better product than a moka pot will as the moka pot gives a signature burnt taste to all coffee.

Advice or any insight is appreciated, or if you want to tell me how horrible I am for not sticking with the moka pot then that’s fine too. Thanks!",1,1758762587.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

1nptjae,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1nptjae/my_30f_bf_29m_told_me_to_leave_and_then_didnt_let/,My (30F) bf (29M) told me to leave and then didn’t let me leave his place. (Possible TW),"I was over his place, he stays with his fam. He helps them out with rent etc. to preface that.

We wanted to watch something on Netflix, but i asked what a show was about in his continued watching. But he said he didn’t know about it and he didn’t watch it. I’ve used his account on his Apple TV for two yrs so this a first. I didn’t think anything of it and I just said what how does that happen. AGAIN NOT THINKING ANYTHING AND NOT TRYING TO FIND SOMETHING WRONG. I was genuinely curious about one show sneaky Pete and wanted to know if we can rewatch a few episode and watch the rest. We never had issues, we rewatch things together, I’ve always asked what he’s been watching and seeing if any of it interests me to watch it when I’m over. I love true crime so it seems like this show would be good! Not exactly the same genre but anywho I’m getting sidetracked but I genuinely didn’t know what it was about.

I was confused when he went straight into saying he doesn’t know, he didn’t watch anything in his continued watching and that it’s because he left a preview on, which isn’t how Netflix works, then he said it’s autoplaying which on his Apple TV it doesn’t but maybe on his phone. Which is valid bc it said he had watched four episodes of sneaky Pete but he kept saying he never clicked on sneaky Pete or any of them. So I was so confused. Same with the other stuff he was claiming he never clicked on or watched etc. and that Netflix was doing it on its own. So now he is like doing this over explanation and I’m sitting there feeling so off and confused. But I just kept trying to help maybe he didn’t know why so I suggested things to as to why that could be happened. So I asked what I would ask anyone if they are telling me stuff’s being watched and they don’t know how: if someone had their info, check the devices that’s been logged in, etc. but this triggered him. He has the account with his fam so no way would I think he specifically gave out info to someone but there are 3 other people using it but he kept saying no one is on his profile, I said maybe ur brother or ur mom and dad and he said no and he got extremely mad saying I initially inquired about the show bc I was looking to argue about something. 

I feel hurt bc I genuinely didn’t and I thought I was just going along with what he was saying with all these explanations and I was also trying to come up with reasons as to why that may be happening. 

No he isn’t cheating and no he isn’t talking to someone else and he didn’t give the info out. I don’t know if it he felt shame about some of the shows, I genuinely have no idea about them. One was animal kingdom, I forgot the other ones and one was sneaky Pete and one was an anime, etc. I’m confused why he went into straight defense mode. It hurt me bc I watched him get so triggered at the what I even said right before my eyes, I stepped away but when he said I asked bc I was looking to argue, I try to defend myself and that’s when all hell broke loose. He went ballistic, I tried to talk over him yelling and mediate and at least reassure him that I was never trying to argue. I was getting so frustrated then he told me to leave which to me I would definitely want to leave if it’s getting too heated out of respect for his fam. I gathered my things to leave and that’s when it got worse, I went through the back he chased after to me and blocked me in by the gate, I told him to let me leave, he refused and kept saying “see this is what u want u want my family to hear you” and this sent me in a rage bc I’m literally trying me best to just get out and to not further this issue that I’m so confused even began in the first place. He told me to go back and get the rest of my things which were snacks I bought and a coffee, he then tried to block me in again, he got in my face, I was able to get out again and then he ran after and blocked the gate again and said to wait 3 minutes to calm down. I ended up so mad and so frustrated beyond belief I accidentally dropped the snacks while carrying everything tried to pick them up, spilled the coffee everywhere, try to pour the rest of it in his sink but it splashed everywhere, I literally can’t leave I’m stuck and he keeps going on and on about it non stop he kept yelling and talking shit to me for the 3 minutes, if I try to get one word in he gets more mad, and then I asked to leave again after the 3 minutes were over but he was across the room and I was able to successfully leave. Mind you, I tried to clean the coffee but he was raging more. 

Now he is claiming I broke shit, which I never did. 
He is saying that I was in the wrong the moment I asked about the show, he is claiming all of this. He made me apologize for my reaction and for having dropped everything to then say he doesn’t accept it. 

I genuinely feel like I’m going insane I can’t understand how all of this transpired from me asking what a show was  about. I always do even if he watched or not, I usually start off like “ooo what’s this about” we read the description tg and decide if we want to watch, and then if he watched something and it was good or vice versa and we feel like rewatching it tg we will. I’m at loss. I feel like I’m going mentally insane.

To clarify I never interrogated or got mad at what he was saying, it did rub me off how he was explaining and demonstrating and nothing was adding up to what he was saying about the account but I didn’t think anything bc his whole fam uses it under different profiles.

In that state with carrying two bags, my half gallon water bottle snacks and a coffee, it was definitely an accident that I dropped and spilled everything in order to get away from him and just try to stay safe. I tried to clean it but I couldn’t get all of it while he was still yelling and talking shit to explain further.

I genuinely feel like I couldn’t have acted rationally being held captive and he is still saying I was wrong for all of that. I tried my best to mediate he couldn’t, when I stepped away, it still wasn’t good enough, when I tried to leave for the sake of his fam, he didn’t let me.

I have no problem apologizing or trying to come up with a resolution but he is hellbent on me leaving him alone now. I’m so hurt bc it seems like he wanted this to happen to find something over my head to run w as to why it ended.

I have never thought that Netflix would ever be this big of an issue. 
 What am I supposed to do here?

TL; DR: 

bf got triggered I asked what a show was about, claimed he didn’t watch it, told me to leave and then didn’t let me leave.",12,1758762512.0,relationships,29,0.75,False

1nptiwu,https://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstateToRealty/comments/1nptiwu/how_to_afford_to_buy_a_house/,How to Afford to Buy a House,"Buying a home an exciting journey, but let’s be honest, affordability is top of mind for most buyers. Between rising home prices, fluctuating interest rates, and the competitive market, many people wonder if homeownership here is truly within reach. The good news? It is! With the right strategy, financing plan, and mindset, you can make owning a home a reality.

Let’s break down some smart ways to navigate the market and stretch your budget further.

# 1. Saving Strategically 🏦

One of the most effective ways to make homeownership possible is by starting with a solid savings plan. Setting up a **dedicated savings account for your down payment** can keep you on track and less tempted to dip into those funds.

Look for areas where you can trim expenses, such as unused **subscriptions**, frequent dining out, or impulse purchases, and **redirect that money into your housing fund**.

💡 Pro tip: Even small adjustments, like brewing coffee at home or canceling a streaming service, can add up to thousands of dollars in a year.

Some homebuyers also accelerate their savings with windfalls such as **tax refunds, annual bonuses, or family gifts** to give their savings a boost. Another smart move is to set up **automatic transfers** into a savings account right after payday so saving becomes effortless.

👉 Try our [**Mortgage Affordability Calculator**](https://mcgarryhometeam.com/mortgage-calculator) to see how much home you can realistically afford. Knowing your target price can help you set a clear savings goal.

# 2. Exploring Loan Options 🏡

Not all mortgages are created equal, and the right loan can make a big difference in how affordable your monthly payment is. Buyers in [Colorado Springs](https://mcgarryhometeam.com/colorado-springs-CO) often explore [**FHA, VA, and Conventional loans**](https://mcgarryhometeam.com/real-estate-glossary), each with unique benefits depending on your situation.

# FHA Loans (Federal Housing Administration)

Backed by the [Federal Housing Administration](https://www.hud.gov/aboutus/fhahistory), FHA loans are popular with first-time homebuyers because they require a **low down payment (as little as 3.5%)** and more flexible credit score requirements. The trade-off is that buyers pay for **mortgage insurance premiums (MIP)**, which add to the monthly cost. Still, for many buyers, it’s an easier path to getting started.

* **Best for:** First-time buyers or those with lower credit scores.
* **Down payment:** As little as **3.5%**.
* **Credit requirements:** More flexible than other loans.
* **Bonus:** Sellers can contribute toward closing costs.

👉 FHA loans are a great entry point for buyers who don’t have a big down payment saved up. However, they do require mortgage insurance, which adds to your monthly payment.

# VA Loans ([Department of Veterans Affairs](https://www.va.gov/housing-assistance/home-loans/))

Available to eligible veterans, active-duty service members, and some surviving spouses, VA loans are one of the best benefits of military service. They typically require **no down payment and no private mortgage insurance (PMI)**, which can save buyers thousands of dollars upfront and over time. Closing costs are also limited, making VA loans one of the most affordable options for those who qualify.

* **Best for:** Active duty, veterans, and eligible surviving spouses.
* **Down payment:** **0%** required.
* **No private mortgage insurance (PMI).**
* **Competitive interest rates.**

👉 This is hands down one of the best loan programs available. If you qualify, you can purchase a home with no down payment — huge savings in a market where the median home price is above $400,000.

# Conventional Loans

Conventional mortgages are not backed by the government, but they often come with competitive interest rates. Down payments can be as low as **3% for qualified buyers**, although many put down closer to 5–20%. One key benefit is that once you reach 20% equity in your home, you can request to remove **private mortgage insurance (PMI)**, which lowers your monthly payment.

* **Best for:** Buyers with stronger credit and savings.
* **Down payment:** Typically **3–20%** (5% is common).
* **Flexibility:** Great for those who want to avoid long-term mortgage insurance.
* **Bonus:** Stronger offers — sellers often prefer conventional buyers in competitive situations.

👉 While conventional loans can be stricter with credit scores, they’re often the best long-term value because you can avoid or drop PMI once you reach 20% equity.

👉 Use our [**Mortgage Calculator**](https://mcgarryhometeam.com/mortgage-calculator) to compare different loan amounts, monthly payment options, and compare how FHA, VA, and Conventional loans stack up for your budget..

# 3. Down Payment Assistance Programs 💰

For many buyers, the biggest hurdle to homeownership isn’t the monthly payment — it’s saving enough for the [**down payment and closing costs**](https://mcgarryhometeam.com/real-estate-glossary). The good news is that there are several assistance programs designed to help. Below are some available for Colorado. Check with a local lender to explore programs in your area.

# Colorado Housing and Finance Authority ([CHFA](https://mcgarryhometeam.com/colorado-homebuyer-programs))

CHFA is one of the most widely used programs in Colorado. It offers **down payment and closing cost assistance** in the form of a grant (that doesn’t have to be repaid) or a second loan with favorable terms. Many first-time and repeat buyers qualify based on income and credit.

# Colorado Housing Assistance Corporation ([CHAC](https://mcgarryhometeam.com/colorado-homebuyer-programs))

This local program provides **up to 4% of the loan amount** in down payment assistance, which can be a game changer for Colorado Springs buyers. It’s available to both first-time and repeat buyers who meet income and purchase price limits.

# Employer or Profession-Based Programs

Teachers, first responders, and healthcare workers sometimes qualify for **special grants or incentives** through national programs like Homes for Heroes or local credit unions. These can help reduce upfront costs even further.

👉 If you’re curious about whether you qualify, I can connect you with trusted local lenders who are approved to offer these programs. Or visit our [Preferred Partners](https://mcgarryhometeam.com/professional-partners-resources) to explore local lenders.

# 4. Expanding the Search Radius 🗺️

When home prices in the most popular neighborhoods feel out of reach, many buyers find success by **expanding their search to nearby areas**. Sometimes driving just 15–20 minutes outside the city center can open up more affordable options without sacrificing too much convenience.

Here are a few worth considering in the Colorado Springs area:

* [**Fountain**](https://mcgarryhometeam.com/fountain-CO) — A growing community just south of Colorado Springs with more affordable single-family homes and new construction. It’s especially popular with military families due to its proximity to [Fort Carson](https://home.army.mil/carson/).
* [**Peyton**](https://mcgarryhometeam.com/peyton-CO) **&** [**Falcon**](https://mcgarryhometeam.com/falcon-CO) — Located northeast of the city, these areas offer larger lots and newer homes at lower price points compared to central Colorado Springs. They’re a great choice for buyers wanting space and value.
* [**Security-Widefield**](https://mcgarryhometeam.com/security-CO) — An established area that often comes with lower home prices while still offering quick access to the city and major highways.
* [**Monument**](https://mcgarryhometeam.com/monument-CO) **&** [**Black Forest**](https://mcgarryhometeam.com/black-forest-CO) — A little farther out, but buyers often get more land and privacy for the money, which appeals to those who don’t mind a longer commute.

💡 Pro tip: Don’t be afraid to look at homes **slightly above your maximum price range**. In some markets, sellers are accepting offers below asking price or contributing to closing costs. If your budget is **$400,000**, consider looking at homes listed up to **$420,000–$430,000**. You might find a property where the seller is open to negotiation, giving you more options without stretching your wallet too far. This flexibility means a home that seems out of reach might actually fit your budget with the right negotiation.

# 5. Teaming Up 🤝

Buying a home doesn’t always have to be a solo journey. More buyers are **teaming up with friends, family, or even partners who aren’t married** to make homeownership more attainable. Pooling resources can make it easier to qualify for a mortgage, cover the down payment, and share ongoing expenses.

# The Benefits of Co-Buying

* **Higher combined income** may qualify you for a larger loan amount.
* **Shared upfront costs** like the down payment and closing fees.
* **Split monthly expenses** (mortgage, utilities, repairs), easing the financial load.

# Things to Consider

While teaming up can open doors, it’s important to be clear about responsibilities from the start. Who pays what? What happens if one person wants to sell? These questions should be discussed before signing the paperwork.

Many buyers use a **co-ownership agreement** (sometimes called a [tenants-in-common](https://mcgarryhometeam.com/blog/What-is-title-insurance-and-why-do-I-need-it-) agreement) that spells out:

* Percentage of ownership
* How equity will be split if the home is sold
* Who handles maintenance and bills

There are also **co-buying platforms and lenders** that specialize in helping non-traditional buyers structure ownership, making the process more secure and straightforward.

💡 Pro tip: It’s a good idea for each buyer to have their **own real estate attorney review the agreement** before finalizing, to protect everyone’s interests.

# 6. Getting Creative with Income 💼💡

Sometimes boosting your buying power isn’t just about saving more — it’s about **increasing your income**. Many buyers find creative ways to bring in extra money that helps them qualify for a mortgage or comfortably cover their monthly payments.

# Side Hustles and Remote Work

With more flexible job opportunities than ever, buyers often take on side hustles like freelance work, tutoring, rideshare driving, or even seasonal jobs. Even a few hundred extra dollars a month can make a difference when lenders evaluate your debt-to-income ratio.

# Rental Potential

Another strategy is buying a home with **built-in rental income potential**. A property with a basement apartment, garage apartment, or accessory dwelling unit ([ADU](https://mcgarryhometeam.com/real-estate-glossary)) can provide steady rental income to help offset your mortgage. Lenders may even consider projected rental income when qualifying you for the loan.

# Short-Term Rentals ([Airbnb](https://airbnb.com/) & [VRBO](https://vrbo.com/))

In areas that are popular for tourists and military families, short-term rentals are another way to supplement income. While these require some management, they can bring in higher rental rates than traditional long-term leases. Always check local zoning and [HOA](https://mcgarryhometeam.com/real-estate-glossary) rules, since short-term rentals aren’t allowed everywhere.

💡 Pro tip: If you’re exploring a home with rental potential, ask your lender whether they’ll count **future rental income** toward your loan application — it could expand your budget.

# 7. Working with a Local Expert 🏘️

When every dollar matters, having the right [real estate agent](https://www.mcgarryhometeam.com/sarah) isn’t just about convenience — it’s about strategy. A local expert in [Colorado Springs](https://mcgarryhometeam.com/colorado-springs-CO) can help you **save money, uncover hidden opportunities, and avoid costly mistakes** along the way.

# Finding Homes Before Everyone Else

Experienced agents often know about homes before they hit the market or can identify overlooked listings that other buyers skip past. This gives you a chance to act quickly and potentially get a better deal.

# Negotiating to Your Advantage

A skilled agent can negotiate not just on price but also on terms. That might mean asking the seller to cover [closing costs](https://mcgarryhometeam.com/real-estate-glossary), securing repair credits, or negotiating a lower price if the home has been sitting on the market.

# Connecting You with the Right Lenders & Programs

Local agents work closely with trusted lenders and know which ones offer the best programs, rates, and down payment assistance for your situation. This can be the difference between qualifying for a home or not.

# Avoiding Pitfalls

From appraisal issues to inspection surprises, an agent who understands the market can help you navigate challenges that might otherwise derail your purchase — or cost you thousands.

💡 Pro tip: Ask your agent about homes that have been on the market [**30+ days**](https://mcgarryhometeam.com/search-all-homes-for-sale?_gl=1*16o4mxe*_up*MQ..*_ga*MTQ3NzYxMzkzMS4xNzU4MTQwMjU2*_ga_BL1P7WDH1P*czE3NTgxNDAyNTUkbzEkZzAkdDE3NTgxNDAyNTUkajYwJGwwJGgw*_ga_SJ4YWRX3RY*czE3NTgxNDAyNTUkbzEkZzAkdDE3NTgxNDAyNTUkajYwJGwwJGgw*_ga_50BX6YT24D*czE3NTgxNDAyNTUkbzEkZzAkdDE3NTgxNDAyNTUkajYwJGwwJGgyMDQzNzI5OTI2*_ga_L655GSM8FD*czE3NTgxNDAyNTUkbzEkZzAkdDE3NTgxNDAyNTUkajYwJGwwJGgw&condition=%7B%22listingstatus%22%3A%5B%22Active%22%5D%2C%22purchasetype%22%3A%5B%22For%20Sale%22%5D%2C%22daysonsite%22%3A%2230%2C%22%7D&uiConfig=%7B%22daysonsite%22%3A%7B%22advanced%22%3A%22advanced%22%7D%7D&zoom=12&page=1). Sellers in these situations are often more motivated to negotiate, giving you an affordability edge.

# Final Thoughts

Affording a home isn’t about having the biggest budget — it’s about being strategic. By exploring different loan programs, expanding your search area, considering homes slightly above your price point, and tapping into local resources, you can make your dream of homeownership a reality.

✨ Whether you’re a first-time buyer or a seasoned homeowner, there are plenty of creative ways to get into the housing market.

Click Clank... the swinging of the men's tools fell on the ice, rhythmically casting a spell, furthering the hole to grow deeper, they worked by hand, day and night, till their fingers bled, and feet blistered. The world around them was obsolete, their only task being to dig and dig and dig and dig. If not for the weekly supply drops they would surely perish. They had little sense of self preservation, they'd only eat with their tools in their hands, and only sleep if a sedative was given.

The authoritarian was the only one free from the handle of a pickaxe, he however wasn't free from the Higher Being. His task being equally as cruel. He was to keep the men alive, for as long as possible, he’d insert the same rusty syringe over and over and over into the men for them to get the sleep they so pleadingly avoided. Occasionally he’d watch a man break down, and lose composure, throw their tools to the floor, and cry in defeat, and the only sympathy he could offer was a bullet through their heads. Obedience was demanded or consequences would be certain. He was “gifted” a mentally anguishing job more than a physical one, which challenged the body just as much.

 These men weren't controlled by a godly power, if anything, it was more like a satanly one. It was the will of their own that kept them going, not some mind control, or being puppeteered, even if that would be a less barbaric reality. Most were dads, most were loved, all were needed back home. The Higher Being wore a compassionless heart, he’d strip the men from the ones they loved, as well as taking captive the families, friends, and partners of whom they cared for. He never forced work, but always threatened.

 The men were cast far into the middle of nowhere, usually barren, cold, and empty. Them currently being stolen to a remote place in Antarctica, but did it really matter? Did it matter if they were somewhere barren, or somewhere populous, or even up in space, or at the bottom of the ocean. For they did not care the least about any of it, they only cared to keep their motivators safe, and to hold and hug them once more, and the Higher Being only offered the grace that these men wished for, if and only if they worked a delusory amount of hours for him.
 
I think we can agree that this would be a very hideous life for these men. Now tell me, will your heart react the same if I phrase the story differently? What if it was that the men sat comfortably tied to a computer in a cubicle, surrounded by his equally indifferent coworkers? That his boss would guide the work, and make sure that it was done properly, as well as firing anyone who didn't meet expectations?, and that the boss's boss would do the same if he also failed his own expectations?, and in such a case, the case of losing your job, would it not compromise the safety of your family?, for you wouldn't be able to pay for their necessities such as food or clothes or shelter? Would you say that the men that sit comfy, who drink coffee, and chat with friends and coworkers, aren't bound to their boss’s boss? Or do you see the reality, that none are free, and all are slaved away, forever chipping away at the ice……

I want to know why?","Hey dad, it’s me your oldest daughter. I have a few questions for you. I don’t want you to answer them in a way that you think will protect my feelings or your pride. I want the raw, honest truth, with no sugarcoating. 

I have been telling you for years what Mom has done to me. Since I was around nine years old I’ve been telling you how she has treated me. Every single time I came to you or spoke up to anyone about it, I was ridiculed, punished, and/or blamed for my reactions to the abusive actions of an adult woman whom I was supposed to be able to trust the most. 
I mean, she grew my toes! 

I have a daughter now, whose toes I grew and I am enraged and betrayed and disgusted at the way you handled my situation. I was a child! Your child! I could NEVER be comfortably complicit with, or indifferent, towards any child suffering the kind of abuse I suffered. 

Why do you still stand by Mom so firmly?! You know what she allowed in that Bishop’s office (volunteer from any background btw) at our Mormon church at night in the middle of the week! I was 9! You know she has slapped me and my sister and has gotten physically violent! 
You know she has broken doors down. You know she has said completely inappropriate and out of place things during arguments between her and I BECAUSE you’ve. been. there! 

You’ve been told that she has touched me. You know about the pictures she made me take of her… because they were sent to YOU. 
I don’t remember that happening but my sisters do. They remember what she made me do with the camera that day and I don’t remember… out of your three daughters, one daughter heard mom explaining what she wanted me to do before locking her out of the bedroom with just mom and I inside. The same thing that I guess happened to me, happened to another daughter, which is how she knew what happened behind that door to me while you were at work. If that’s all that happened…
You have been told and have been PRESENT during some of the things she would say to me out of the blue. For example, “she has evil eyes, -insert *your name*, dad-, she has a dark spirit following her” right in front of me! And then to my face “you have evil in you”. 

You were there for all of it Dad!! You’ve even fallen victim to her hurtful behaviors. You just don’t seem to want to see it. 

You know? I once likened you to Corporal Upham (if that’s how you spell it) from Saving Private Ryan and have, at another time, told you and mom that your relationship is like that of a female and a male angler fish. I still feel a twinge of guilt for saying those things…

Even though, at one point YOU were angry at ME for calling the cops from states away because mom assaulted my sister and she was scared and called me and asked me to call the police. Why were you mad at ME? Why? You said it was because it cost $5000 for an attorney but that’s bs because I’m NOT the person to be mad at about just consequences to hurtful actions. MOM was at fault. 
You stopped talking to me because of that and the fact that I have been low and no contact, with Mom for years. 

Which meant she missed out on both births of my children and wasn’t allowed to meet them for a very long time and has never ever been allowed to be alone with either of them. 

You agreed with mom that I could no longer talk to my youngest sibling, my baby brother, in response to my decision in not allowing mom to speak to my son (this was before my daughter was born). 

I left my childhood home being so involved and invested in my brother’s life and wellbeing. Our bond was so close it almost felt like I was a mother figure to him. Then you just cut him off from me because he was a minor and couldn’t make that decision himself. You said it’s because I started drinking coffee and alcohol, and occasionally cussing. You said you didn’t feel comfortable with ME around HIM because I started doing normal adult things that weren’t within Mormon teachings -like a normal human! I would NEVER put a child at risk. BUT SOMEHOW MY PREDATORY MOTHER IS SAFE AROUND CHILDREN?! Make it make sense dad!! 

I was twenty when I left home. My brother was six and my little sidekick. I took him everywhere with me! I would choose to hang out with him over my friends sometimes! Sure we were 14 years apart, but he is my baby brother. I woke up with him at night when he was a newborn. I held him to sleep. I sang a special song to him when I held him. He was my lil buddy and always will be and YOU LET HER CUT HIM OFF FROM ME SO ABRUPTLY! 

It crushed me, but what did it do to him?? How do you sleep at night Dad? I made the decision to cut Mom off from my children because she had been an unsafe person for me as a child. I will not risk my children’s safety for your happiness or comfort. 

Oh, how about the fact that you and I are no longer speaking because I won’t shove what she’s done under the rug and I keep bringing it up, even in front of her. I don’t care. It’s not my shame to hide. 

You are so angry at ME and for WHAT?? 

My sister finally had the courage to report Mom recently and you think I am behind it. I’m just that evil right!? /s. 

Seriously though, what DO I HAVE TO GAIN FROM OUT-ing MOM! 

Ya know, before I knew/understood what was happening to me and before I started talking about it, you were my HERO dad! You showed me so much love and support. I told you that you were my hero and even wrote it down on classroom assignments. 
We went on so many different adventures together and hung out and had so many laughs and wonderful moments. 

Remember that overnight hike just the two of us and a moose came and slept next to our tent? Or watching Ace Ventura on the edge of a waterfall before heading to bed? How about our bike rides? Playing the WWII Army Men Assault game you always let me beat you at during 1v1 on the PlayStation? 

I don’t blame myself anymore because now that I have children, I see how much love and safety my inner child deserves. But, I lost you when I started coming forward. I lost you in attempting to seek safety from mom. I lost my hero and you’re still alive Dad!!!! 

I realize now that you aren’t my hero. That doesn’t mean I can’t have another hero and that’s Grandma -mom’s mom- even though she’s long passed away.
I have so much to lose in this. I hate it. I struggle with it daily. I sometimes am too mean towards myself about it. 

Also, that plan I had for coming back to Utah? I can’t do it now. I can’t allow my children around either you or Mom. You’re both not to be trusted. 

So, I have to find some other avenue to get away from my sexually, physically, and emotionally abusive husband because my kids deserve better. I never fully relied on you giving your word to help. You said you would, but I was immediately thinking -at what cost? Me shutting up about it and allowing mom to behave the way she does around my children? No. 

My children are priceless. You are not. Mom is not. Thanks for all the promises of help, you definitely painted yourself as a supportive father, but none of that was ever going to happen, right? Because I knew we’d clash since I won’t budge on my boundaries. My children always come first. So I’ll have to find another way to get out of this from states away and figure out where to go. A woman’s shelter is on the table now. If they have room. 

So why dad? For all of it, why? What is your explanation. I don’t care how sinister or blunt or hard the truth is to hear, I want to hear it. What is your thinking behind it? What’s going on in your mind? Why dad?",6,1758762030.0,DadForAMinute,9,0.88,False

Hello my beautiful & lovely story writers, 

I’m a 29-year-old female, and currently back into the deep trenches of an endless roleplay partner search… and honestly, it’s been feeling like a tragic SOLRP of its own.

I’ve struck out with many a partner because I was apparently “too detailed.” Meanwhile, they were serving me five-sentence replies like we were on a word count diet. No hate! Your person is out there! just not my vibe.

•So here I am, waving my little white RP flag, once again asking:

•Are you someone who loves depth, detail, and diving into characters?

•Do you get excited over slow burns, wholesome moments, and a little splash of drama?

•Are you a male, 21+ who writes in first person and doesn’t ghost after 2 replies?

If you answered yes to any or all of the above, slide on into my DMs! Just a heads up, I will not even entertain a “hi, interested” DM. Give me something worth reading, respectfully. 

I prefer writing over Discord and am 100% super down to plot and build something meaningful together. Romance optional, but vibes? Required.

Writing Sample: (Cozy, emotional, slow burn vibes)

*I sat on the edge of the kitchen counter, legs swinging slightly as the smell of coffee filled the air. “You always make it too strong,” I teased, even though I’d never once turned down a cup.

The sleeves of your hoodie swallowed my hands as I curled them into the fabric, pretending I wasn’t watching your every move as you shuffled around like you belonged here. Maybe you did.

“Do you think,” I said after a long pause, my voice quieter now, “that this could actually work?”

You didn’t answer right away, and that silence-the one that used to make me nervous-just wrapped around the room like a warm blanket. It was terrifying, how much comfort I’d found in you. How easily this had started to feel like something I’d miss, even though it hadn’t ended yet.*


Let’s write something that sticks with us long after we log off.
