1hfpdrt,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1hfpdrt/aio_for_deciding_not_to_buy_a_gift_this_year/,AIO for deciding not to buy a gift this year?,"I’m a 30-year-old man, and I’ve decided not to buy my sister (27F) a Christmas gift this year. Our relationship has always been complicated. Since childhood, we’ve had a rivalry that, while common between siblings, left lasting scars. She was always the favorite, taking part in classes and competitions she wanted, while I, despite having the same opportunities, didn’t pursue them because I’m more introverted. Over time, this created a distance between us.

Last year, however, I tried to mend things. I was dealing with depression and thought it would be a good idea to open up to her. I invited her for coffee and explained that I wanted our relationship to improve, that I didn’t want to lose my sister. It was an emotional moment—she accepted in tears, and for a while, things seemed to get better. I even moved back home for work reasons, and our relationship seemed calmer.

That Christmas, I decided to do something meaningful: I restored and digitized old childhood videos of us as kids. It was a gift that took a lot of time, effort, and money, but I wanted to show that I was willing to make an effort to strengthen our bond.

This year (2024), she opened a new business and asked me to work on the branding for her brand. I saw it as an opportunity to support her and rebuild our relationship further. From the start, I made it clear that I’d charge her less because she’s family. However, when the business launched and it came time to bill her—around $1,000—she got offended. Instead of paying me, she accused me of only caring about money.

Things escalated quickly: she yelled at me, insulted me, and has ignored me ever since. To make matters worse, her actions damaged my professional reputation. Friends of hers, with whom I had pending projects, decided to stop working with me after hearing her side of the story.

What hurt the most was that, during the business’s grand opening, she publicly thanked me in her speech for the branding and said she hoped it would be the first of many successful projects for me. But in the end, this entire ordeal left me in debt.

The money I expected to earn from her project was used to finance the publication of my book—a dream I’ve had for years. On top of that, I landed a great job in another city, but because of the financial strain, I had to borrow money to move into a small room behind someone’s house.

Now, with Christmas approaching, I’ve decided not to get her a gift. In fact, I didn’t even text her anything beyond a cold “HB” (happy birthday) on her birthday, and only because my mom asked me to. While I feel like my decision might ruin Christmas, I don’t see the point in continuing to make an effort when it feels like a one-way street.

So, Reddit, am I the asshole for deciding not to buy her a gift this year?",1,1734372647.0,AmIOverreacting,0,1.0,False

The new glass carafe spontaneously shattered while brewing coffee, so I contacted Moccamaster.   Because I don't have proof of purchase, and the carafes aren't covered under warranty, they won't do anything about it. 

For reference I had an Oxo Barista 9 cup for 6 years where they replaced the carafe 3 times on it (long out of warranty)when it would lose the vacuum and become hot to the touch. At least the machine was still usable when this happened.   Now unless I spend almost $100 to buy another carafe that is just as susceptible to breaking, the brewer is unusable.   

I'm not thrilled that they changed to the glass carafe and don't stand behind it.   ",1,1734372640.0,Moccamaster,0,1.0,False

Slowly over the last years I have come to hate my family. My mother sadly passed when I was 13 and when I was 15 my dad became ill after having 2 heart attacks and a stroke and I look after him everyday (medication, shopping, cleaning the house, bringing coffees). My dad is a heavy drinker/ smoker and is extremely unhealthy. My brother works at the local pub and absolutely hates me. Since we were teenagers he’s bullied and belittled me every day telling me I have no life or job and I just “doss around the house”. My dad and my brother spend a lot of time together and often exclude me. My real problem lies with my brothers laziness. He never ever cleans his room or his clothes or even himself (only bathing maybe once in months). He lives off of takeaways and fizzy drinks and has a bad gambling addiction. After a few months I have to clean his room after asking him over and over to do it. The smell is awful and it’s all around the house. It’s very embarrassing when people come over. He causes tiny flies infestations which end up all over the house and sometimes I have to eat in the garden to avoid them going in my food, once I even made a sandwich and after eating half I realise there was flies all inside. When it gets to the point there is no more plates or cutlery to use he has to bring them all down from his bedroom and my worst part is my dad cleans them all for him because he won’t do it. My dad also buys all his food and essentials and does everything for him while I have to pay, cook and shop for myself. My brother earns good money from his job but spends it in one night on gambling and then lends hundreds from my dad to spend of takeaways and junk and yet I get moaned at for borrowing money for food shopping. Maybe I’m stupid but it’s feels like my dad treats me unfairly compared to my brother. Once my brother stole hundereds from my dad and he still lent him the money to go on holiday. The stealing is a reoccurrence. I have tried to tell my dad that the way my brother lives is very unhealthy and he’s going to make himself sick but my dad said nothing and lets him off, even cooking for him when he’s cannot be bothered too. My brother is 22 years old and literally does nothing for himself. No cooking, shopping, laundry or cleaning at all. AITA for telling my dad that my brother needs to get a grip?

I reconnected with an ex of mine recently. we started seeing each other again, but have not discussed exclusivity, although I am aware he is seeing other women.

the other day he was supposed to come spend the night, but he never confirmed the time so I went in the shower, he called me and I didn't answer and he assumed I was with someone else (it was 2am). I reassured him that was not the case.

a day later, I get a text from a guy I had meet at a coffee shop. i felt okay giving this guy my info as I'm not exclusive with my ex and he is seeing other women as I mentioned. my ex saw the text while he was here at my house and he asked me about it and I assured him it was nothing. the problem is that this guy I met is an underground music producer like actually in the industry, and my ex is an aspiring music producer/ rapper. I think this may have hurt his ego along with him thinking he can't trust me. sadly, I initially texted the producer that night asking for any recommendations he had for a christmas present for an inspiring musician (my ex). i really had no bad intentions. 

I know this is ultimately a toxic relationship and I should leave him. but I've done nothing wrong. even though we're not together, I haven't slept with/ dated/ talked to anyone else in years. how can I make him understand that without pushing him further away?

What Jesus teaches about Faith in action

Introduction
------------

In a world where chaos often clouds our vision, faith can be that guiding light that illuminates our path. We’ve all heard the saying, “Actions speak louder than words,” and when it comes to our faith, this is profoundly true. It’s one thing to say we believe, but quite another to let our actions reflect that belief. Jesus teaches us that faith isn’t static; it requires movement, growth, and a heart willing to act.

Imagine a life where your faith isn’t just something you hold in your heart, but a dynamic force driving you to make a difference. When we put our faith into action, we’re not just spectators in the story of life; we become active participants, co-creating a world filled with love, hope, and beauty. Let’s explore how Jesus’s teachings on faith in action can transform our lives and the world around us.

Bible Verse
-----------

James 2:26 (NIV): “As the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without deeds is dead.”

Meaning
-------

The Bible verse from James serves as a powerful reminder that faith isn’t just about belief; it’s about the actions that stem from that belief. Jesus didn’t just preach about love, forgiveness, and service; he lived it through his actions. Whether it was healing the sick, feeding the hungry, or forgiving the unforgivable, Jesus continually showed us that faith is alive when it’s expressed through deeds.

Faith without action is like a tree without roots: it cannot sustain its growth. The life and teachings of Jesus challenge us to examine how our faith manifests in our daily lives. Are we sitting on the sidelines, or are we actively engaging with the world as reflections of Christ’s love and service?

Understanding this dynamic can transform our perspective on what it means to live a life of faith. It’s not about reaching a destination but about embarking on a journey that is expressed through the simple acts of kindness, generosity, and love that we gift to others. This is how faith breathes life into our walk with Christ.

Through our deeds, we demonstrate the authenticity of our faith, reinforcing that belief in Jesus is not just an internal assurance but a catalyst for external change. It’s about allowing the love of Jesus to guide every step, whispering hope and sharing light in a world that so desperately needs it.

Actions to Take
---------------

– Volunteer at a local charity or community service and see how your skills can make a difference for others in need.

– Identify a friend or family member going through a tough time, and take intentional steps to support them through a call, visit, or a letter of encouragement.

– Start a daily or weekly habit of praying for others, asking God how you can be an instrument of His peace in their lives.

– Practice random acts of kindness, like buying coffee for a stranger, sharing a compliment, or donating to a cause you believe in.

– Reflect on any grudges or unforgiveness you’re holding onto and choose to forgive as an act of faith and love.

Journal Prompts
---------------

1. Reflect on a recent time when you put your faith into action. What did you learn from the experience?

2. How can you further integrate your faith with your everyday actions?

3. What is one area in your life where you feel God calling you to take action?

4. Write about a time when someone else’s faith in action inspired you to grow in your own faith.

5. What small steps can you take this week to let your faith shine brighter in the world?

Prayer
------

Dear Lord,

Thank you for the gift of faith and for the profound example set by Jesus Christ. Help me to not only understand Your Word but to live it out through my actions every day. Guide my heart and hands to reflect Your love, transforming my faith into deeds that uplift and inspire others. May my life be a testament to Your grace and mercy, as I strive to be a vessel of Your peace in this world. Amen.

Social Posts
------------

1. “Faith isn’t just a belief; it’s a call to action. How will you put your faith to work today? #FaithInAction #BeTheLight”

2. “Faith without deeds is like a boat without an oar. Together, they make waves. What waves will you make today? 🌊✨ #LivingFaith #ActionsSpeak”

3. “Just a reminder: Your faith is alive when it moves your heart to serve. Go out and make a difference! 🌟 #ServeWithLove #FaithWorks”

4. “Be a vessel of hope by letting your actions reflect your faith. How will you inspire someone today? ❤️ #HopeInAction #LightOfTheWorld”

5. “Every act of kindness done in faith echoes in heaven. 🌿 How will you let your faith be heard? #KindnessMatters #FaithInDeeds”

Conclusion
----------

Incorporating faith into action is not just a discipline but a joyful response to Jesus’s teachings. It’s how we breathe life into our beliefs and make His love visible to the world. As you embark on this journey of active faith, know that each step, no matter how small, has the power to ripple through lives and transform communities.

Remember, faith is a living, dynamic force within you, just waiting to be unleashed. Thank you for joining us in this reflection at BGodInspired.com. Let these truths inspire your heart to step out and manifest God’s love, illuminating the path for others to follow. Let’s continue this journey together, one action at a time.

Ooh, ooh - [something I've done a lot of research on.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fremont/comments/xvlzrc/not_complaining_just_explaining_if_fremonts_gonna/) Let me tell you what Fremont needs:

#A Viable Third Place
Based on Fremont's characteristics and accolades, a viable and profitable Third Place that could thrive in the city while maintaining a safe, inclusive environment and reflecting local culture is a multi-purpose community center and café. This facility could combine elements of:

* A tech-friendly workspace
* A cultural hub showcasing local diversity
* A family-oriented gathering space

**Key Features**

* Tech-Friendly Workspace: Fremont ranks highly for women in tech and is near Silicon Valley1. The space could offer high-speed internet, comfortable seating, and meeting rooms to cater to the tech-savvy population.
* Cultural Hub: With Fremont's diverse population, the center could host cultural events, art exhibitions, and language exchange meetups, reflecting the city's inclusive nature.
* Family-Oriented Space: Fremont is ranked as one of the best places to raise a family1. The center could include a safe indoor play area for children and host family-friendly events.

**Additional Elements**

* A café serving diverse, healthy food options
* A small library or book exchange corner
* Outdoor seating area for pleasant weather days
* Regular community events and workshops

This Third Place would be designed to be profitable through café sales, workspace rentals, and event hosting, while maintaining a safe and inclusive environment that reflects Fremont's tech-forward, family-friendly, and culturally diverse character.

In Fremont, it's common to assert that a community-focused project ""is never going to work."" However, it's essential to respond with evidence and examples of successful initiatives that have thrived under similar circumstances. Here are some effective counterpoints:

* [Successful Placemaking Projects:](https://www.innovationquarter.com/articles/five-inspiring-placemaking-projects/) Numerous placemaking projects demonstrate that community-driven spaces can flourish. For instance, Pier 70 in San Francisco transformed an industrial area into a vibrant hub featuring office space, retail shops, and affordable housing, successfully embodying its history while fostering community engagement.
* [Community Architecture Successes:](https://gbdmagazine.com/examples-of-community-architecture/) Projects like the Austin Central Library have redefined public spaces by integrating community needs with innovative design. This library serves as a cultural and social center, attracting thousands of visitors daily and providing various community services.
* [Adaptability During Challenges](https://www.theurbanist.org/2021/04/12/new-report-highlights-the-success-of-community-led-public-spaces/): The report from the Knight Foundation highlights that community-led public spaces maintained high usage during the pandemic, adapting to new roles such as supporting local businesses and engaging youth through innovative programming. For example, Ella Fitzgerald Park in Detroit evolved from vacant lots into a vibrant gathering space for community events.
* [Engagement Through Shared Spaces:](https://www.re-thinkingthefuture.com/city-and-architecture/a2302-5-famous-urban-public-spaces-and-what-makes-them-famous/) Initiatives like the High Line in New York City, which transformed an abandoned railway into a thriving public park, showcase how creative reuse of space can revitalize neighborhoods and foster community interaction. This project has become a model for urban renewal and demonstrates the potential for similar endeavors to succeed.
* [Cultural Relevance and Community Needs](https://gbdmagazine.com/examples-of-community-architecture/): Projects such as Casa Adelante in San Francisco effectively address cultural heritage while providing essential services like childcare and urban agriculture, reflecting the needs of local residents and creating a sense of belonging.

By highlighting these successful examples, it becomes clear that with thoughtful planning, community involvement, and adaptability, Third Places can indeed thrive despite skepticism. Engaging local Fremont stakeholders in the planning process further ensures that the project aligns with community needs, increasing its chances of success.

Naysayers who pile onto the 'it'll never work in Fremont' bandwagon need to go hang out in front of the closed Rainforest Cafe and complain how much better Fremont used to be on Facebook.

My players decided to be hawkers 

So I had a funny idea.

They stole a burlap sack that was said to contain some ""new drug on the streets"". It's full of ""small brown organic seeds"", they saw people crushing these seeds into a powder, they saw someone else have hot water filter through this powder into a cup making it a ""brown hot liquid that gives off a pleasant aroma"", they've seen a man drink this liquid from a mug and him being described as ""more alart and awake then he was before""

So what do they think of all this?

It must be some kind of potion that will either turn him into a werewolf once he's drank enough of it (I haven't mentioned anything about werewolves or anything like them at all) or if he doesn't get enough every day he becomes said werewolf.

My family (myself, husband, 2 y.o., and 4 y.o) are heading to Costa Rica next week. 

My kids are active, and don't do well sitting and listening for too long. I'm looking for short (2-3 hours), interactive and/or flexible activities. Ideally, we'd be able to leave or take a snack break if they get tired/hungry. We will likely do 1 activity per day, and relax in the afternoon, and take a few rest days as needed.  

If you have any feedback on any of these tours/activities, or ones I should do instead, please let me know! (I'd also love advice on best places to eat with young kids!)

We don't have any boat activities scheduled because I'm worried about them bored/wanting to get off the boat. We also don't have any night tours scheduled because in general my kids are tired/cranky after 5pm. We will have 1 kid-carrying backpack and a smaller toddler carrier if needed, but my 2 year old can walk 1-2 miles with snack breaks and my 4 year old can walk 3-4 miles with snack breaks.  

**Manual Antonio: (4 nights)**

* National Park (already booked)
* Rainmaker Park (on the fence)
* Vanilla Villa Spice tour (on the fence)
* Hacienda Ébano tour (on the fence)

**La Paz: (2 nights)**

* Waterfall garden (staying at Peace Lodge)
* Poas Volcano, strawberry snacks (not doing the tour), Starbucks coffee farm (not doing the tour)

**La Fortuna: (4 nights)**

* Sloth tour? (on the fence)
* Mistico Hanging Bridges
* Two little monkeys chocolate tour (this one seemed the best for young kids, but let me know if you have a different one that might fit that criteria) 

**Monteverde: (2 nights)**

* St Elena Cloud Forrest 
* Finca El Paraiso Cheese Farm Tour (on the fence)

Again, not looking for general feedback about the itinerary or ""do less"". I'm more interested in information like, ""this tour/activity was great for little kids.. or I'd skip this one because..).

Listings for other similar pieces seem to be 1.5k-3k.

1hfotam,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tonsillectomy/comments/1hfotam/hemorrhage_yesterday_advice_about_what_to_do_and/,Hemorrhage yesterday  - advice about what to do and to avoid ,"Hi all,
I had my tonsils out 12/11. Talked too much on Saturday night and had a bad bleed early Sunday morning. Lost 1.5 units of blood in about 10 minutes. Fortunately the ER is about a 3 minute drive from the house. The surgeon re-cauterized them and I am doing a lot better. Here's what helps and doesn't help:
Helps:
Humidifiers with distilled water (so you don't get buildup on the surfaces like walls and stuff) 
Cold water or room temp - slow but steady hydration. Small sips!  
Protein drinks 
Sugar free jello (especially strawberry kiwi) and pudding
Apple sauce 
Taking meds on time - using alarms to remind me and am/pm pill dispenser (I labeled it with time). 

Got a pill crusher - screws down on the pill and crushes them to dust so mixes easily into apple sauce 

Forcing fluids. Slow but steady. Sonic ice :) 

Sleeping in recliner

Miralax and gas-x 

Having supplies handy like extra water, jello, tissues, empty cup in case of bleed. Impossible to catch it all with paper towels. 

I didn't realize my weight restriction was 10 lbs. probably didn't exceed it but I'm being more careful now. 

Trying to keep up with showering and doing my hair. This is hard but when I went to the ER and looked like I hadn't showered for awhile, I was embarrassed. Plus I think the steam from the shower helps. 

I got my medical power of attorney form and a very basic will filled out and notarized the day before. Most states don't require them to be notarized. This helped me feel safer, even though statistically the largest risk is probably driving there. When I had the bad bleed, I was glad I had them done. 

I have an ER bag packed with my purse and shoes next to the door. It has a blanket, extra jammies, paperwork (POA form, discharge instructions), phone chargers. Highly recommend even though overall the risk of a bleed is low. It would be even better if this was packed in my husbands car already but it's not - a little nervous to leave stuff like this in the car. 

I made a list of what I am looking forward to after recovering from surgery. It's motivating. On the top of my list are crunchy sweets and steak! Plus improved quality of life from not having problem tonsils. Specific things on the list are helpful when the days drag.  

I also watched videos on the histology of tonsils (what the doctors look at on the microscope slides). SO interesting and weird. I hope they make a lot of money - lol. Enjoy this rabbit hole. On a similar note, my surgeon offered to share photos of my tonsils with me. I haven't seen them yet but hopefully that happens. If you're interested, you could ask. 

Does not help:
Discussing serious topics with spouse. Whatever it is, it can wait. My mistake. Please learn from my stupidity and don't talk too much. Text them and tell them to vent with someone else or otherwise just leave you alone. 

Gatorade (grape) and fruit punch jello tasted too citric for me. Kinda hurt. 

I was having broccoli cheddar soup and it is great with tiny bites but I think the cheese produces extra phlegm, which isn't too good. Helps with hunger though.

Caffeine addiction. I should have cut down before surgery. I ended up having to take migraine meds to help when my caffeine headache spiraled out of control. Now I am mixing coffee with protein drink so it's easier to deal with.  

Not sure what to do about the taste and smell of the scabs. Very unpleasant. I saw another post on this topic so I'll tune in there. Unfortunately, my family can also detect it.

All of their fragrances are interesting but accessible. I ended up buying full bottles of Nanatopia and Dirty Rice. Here are my thoughts on all the samples in the two discovery sets. 

Angel’s Powder: 5/10. Too sugary and synthetic smelling. I really do get cotton candy and nail polish with a heavy dose of vanilla in there. 
    
DGAF: 8/10. A fresh, citrusy wood scent. I really really like this as a fresh scent. I’m considering a full bottle. 
    
Dirty Heaven: 8/10. I think I like it a little better not on my skin, but generally it does smell heavenly. I get more tonka and amber, but the hint of jasmine is nice. 
    
Dirty Rice: 8.5/10. This smells so unique and delectable. I’m loving the milk, rice, and sandalwood, with maybe a hint of saffron?
    
Drunk Lovers: 7/10. This one smells like shampoo to me, in a good way. I can’t quite pick out the notes, but it’s a little fruity with a touch of cinnamon. 
    
Drunk Maple: 8/10. Now this is a gourmand! It’s so good it makes me hungry. Maple, rum, and coffee all shine in this one, and there might be a hint of leather in there too. 
    
Drunk Saffron: 7/10. I’m getting mostly saffron and vanilla from this one. It’s quite nice, but not remarkable. 
    
Fig Porn: 7/10. It reminds me a little of Diptyque’s Philosykos, but with a little hint of nuts complementing the fruit and green of the fig leaves. 
    
Indecent Cherry: 6.5/10. Most cherry fragrances are too syrupy smelling for me, but this one is quite nice. I still wouldn’t wear it, but I appreciate it for what it is. 
    
Mad Honey: 7.5/10. Honey and rose! Who knew they were such a fantastic combination? If I was into florals, I’d adore this one. 
    
Mary Jane: 6/10. It’s alright, but I don’t think the mint and cannabis work that well together. It does smell fresh and green with a bit of dankness to it. 
    
Nanotopia: 8.5/10. Another wonderful gourmand, this time with notes of banana bread, caramel, rum, and something woody or maybe incense in the base. It’s more like a woody spicy fragrance than a gourmand actually. 
    
Nuts: 7.5/10. This one is a wonderful gourmand that isn’t too sweet. It smells a little bit like nuts with some traditional perfume smell. It’s hard to describe, but I like it. 
    
Sin & Pleasure: 7.5/10. I love leather as a note, so I can’t not like this. This is almost a powdery leather—not too heavy at all. 
    
Smokin Gun: 7/10. Pine and incense are the predominant notes in this one. It’s nice and fresh, not that woody. it kind of reminds me a little bit of citronella. 
    
Sugar Addict: 7/10. Like it sounds! Sweet with a hint of cocoa powder and rum. I like it, but it’s not my favorite.

This makes hard time to me articulate my(F21) thoughts and feelings to my boyfriend(M21). Even tho I try. We have been living together almost three years.

Before my man left to work he woke me up 15min earlier and I got upset that again we had no time. When I go to school, he sleeps and when he comes home from work, I have to go to sleep. This have happened alot in few months. I told him that I wanted to wake up with him bc of that, I wasn’t going to school. He understood my sadness, but I still texted him more about my feelings.

I translate my text here:
”I don’t know what to say. I think you changed after ur new workplace and it shows up like u don’t want to be with me or it is not necessary to you. Few months earlier we could have woke up and drink coffee together, clean up the house and be together. But now you just say that you care and I believe the shit out of you. I have not been feeling that you care and I have been thinking it’s bc of your work and how much you spend time there, but now when I have been home most of the days it’s not excuse anymore. I understand that our sleep schedule makes things hard, but this morning you took my alarms off and these would make mornings different. You say that you tried once woke me up, but your actions say different things.”

He responded:
”Okay. I had a hard time to wake up this morning and got to work just in time. This is now unfair. I have changed bc of my insecurities and I feel like I do almost everything wrong. I feel like it’s pointless even try. You have fucking changed after that diagnosis, you cant take responsibility of your own actions and you don’t even care ab my feelings. This doesn’t work just in one way. You keep me up til 5am and assume that we wake up early. Go yourself and think your actions, this isn’t ab diagnosis when you act this way. I try to be better even tho I have my own.”

First of all I have bpd and opened up few nights back ab this to my bf, bc we have not had much time together and I saw my chance to talk. I started it with ”I’m scared that you will use this against me when we argue” and what happened? He did it anyway. Last night we went to bed ab 2am and he woke me up at 13pm so he speaks bullshit in his text. 

I went to rollercoaster with my emotions when I saw that he used my diagnosis against me, bc that happened last week too. When my narsissistic mother said that my therapy isn’t working (when I called her out with child abuse) my love of my life heard that and used that same phrase.

Am I just delusional or what bc I don’t think that my text wasn’t that bad, just wanted to start it somehow? Or do I miss something? Am I delulu thinking that this text ehat he sens was really manipulative?
We both have our own manipulative traits that we are working on, but with bpd it’s really hard when loml tries to trigger me with things that I have been asking to stop multiple times.",0,1734371097.0,Manipulation,5,0.4,False

I have gotten to the point where I have done and said everything I can, and I’m simply just ignoring the journal entries and doing what I got hired to do.

I’ve been in Maringá for a while now, and it’s honestly a solid place to work remotely. The city’s pretty safe, and most daily errands—groceries, coffee spots, even coworking spaces—are within a short drive. Renting an apartment won’t cost you a fortune, and I can’t complain about the internet either (1Gbps is common and affordable).

Getting around the country is easy too. The local airport has cheap flights, and you can be at São Paulo’s main international hub in under an hour. The nightlife isn’t legendary, but there are enough bars and live music spots to keep evenings interesting. Overall, if you want a calm, practical, and cost-effective base in Brazil, Maringá is worth a look.

Then in the morning a reverse of that. Put my stuff in then unplug everything. 

Only issues I see with that is if FSD decides it only wants to back in when they have that implemented. Don't think the cord would reach. If we get a giant Costco grocery haul we typically back into the driveway, unload then back into the garage. 

Also do you prefer if the charger is literally next to the port? Forward a couple feet? Back a couple feet? I'll be plugging in and unplugging a lot so I'd prefer to have it positioned perfectly.

https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2024/12/cultural-algorithms/680987/

You might have heard that algorithms are in control of everything you hear, read, and see. They control the next song on your Spotify playlist, or what YouTube suggests you watch after you finish a video. Algorithms are perhaps why you can’t escape Sabrina Carpenter’s hit song “Espresso” or why you might have suddenly been struck by the desire to buy one of those pastel-colored Stanley cups. They dictate how TV shows are made and which books get published—a revolutionary paradigm shift that’s become fully entrenched in the arts and media, and isn’t going away anytime soon.

In 2024, culture is boring and stale due to the algorithms calling the shots on what gets produced and praised—or so the critics say. The New Yorker staff writer Kyle Chayka wrote an entire book about how Big Tech has successfully “flattened culture” into a series of facsimile coffee shops and mid-century-modern furniture. The critic Jason Farago argued in The New York Times Magazine that “the plunge through our screens” and “our submission to algorithmic recommendation engines” have created a lack of momentum. Pinning the blame on new inventions isn’t a fresh argument either: In a 1923 essay, Aldous Huxley pointed to the ease of cultural production, driven by a growing middle-class desire for entertainment, as a major culprit for why mass-market books, movies, and music were so unsatisfying. “These effortless pleasures, these ready-made distractions that are the same for everyone over the face of the whole Western world,” he wrote, “are surely a worse menace to our civilization than ever the Germans were.”",2,1734370591.0,atlanticdiscussions,0,1.0,False
1hfoj7x,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1hfoj7x/do_i_even_want_her_back/,Do I even want her back?,"So I got into a very intense relationship two months ago. We dated for 3 months and one of them we were actually officially together. 
We had small arguments now and then because she was very socially outgoing and had a lot of male attention and a lot of close male friends that she was texting on a daily basis even calling them affectionate names. 
We met under strange circumstances because we started dating when she was in an open relationship and she only told me so after we had sex at my place after our first date.

That made me be careful and not deeply trusting but I fell in mad love anyway because we shared so much common love for music and nurtured each other in that. 

Fast forward a lot of shit happened when she moved into a new apartment. I started getting closer to her friends that she also crashed at two weeks prior because of train delays. She confessed to me that one of them was actually her ex boyfriend. 
That hurt me because I trusted that they were just friends as she told me. 

We had a little disconnect over that and I could also see that the friend of hers she was moving in with seemed a little closer than I would have thought. I might even remember hearing them kiss when she left her room in a hush. That is just speculation tho.
We had a small stupid argument over him putting his toothbrush into our cup. She understood that and promised to change it. 
But then she admitted she needed to confess more. Being panicked I prompted her to come to my place immediately to talk. 
She said she was afraid I wouldn’t want her their when she tells me. 
Even more panicked I called her and I could see she was panicked and crying and she told me that actually she did have something with her two now roommates in the past. It was kinda contradictory how it sounded whether it was one time or whether it ended months ago as she both said. 

I wanted time and I was mad and dissappointed. She did have over a month to tell me that personally to built trust. 
She texted me how she still wanted us.
I replied back and was very harsh and told her how I felt that she had disrespected our relationship. 
We wanted to meet but we fought badly over text and she demanded a time out. After that she wanted to break up with me over the phone after getting fucked up on the weekend. 
We met and she told me she breaking up with me because of my anger issues. (nothing that has ever been a problem in my relationships so far) 
I was relieved of at least having certainty and started joking with her about how we were not supposed to be long term anyway. She got so attracted bro me about that, she wanted to hook up again. Reluctantly I did because to my own shame I still had hope of making it right. 
We went home ( I heard her celebrating with her roommate) we fucked, ate, cried together. Told each other we loved each other. I apologised deeply for everything I had done wrong in our conflict. 
She never apologised. She just forgave me.
She was sometimes was close to saying something which felt like a proposal to try again.

She told me she never wants to be treated like I treated her the last week. We didn’t even spend these days together. 
I remember her saying something like I don’t know if we’ll ever look each other in the eyes like that again. Which made me cry in my sleep and she didn’t notice. All of that adding to the drama.
I left her and told her that I love her and she said it back and we kissed. That was the last time we had contact. 

I feel so sad that the first time where I did something wrong and my flaws showed she dropped me like a hot potato.
She told me she wants me in her life and continue to make music together. 
She put all the blame for our breakup on me and how I was not empathic enough and not loving enough.
I know our fight on WA was toxic but it was a fight and we both didn’t help to deescalate it. 
I cared for her so much. I bought the food she loved, I invited her for coffees, I respected her time outs and encouraged her to stay longer to enjoy the evenings.
I gave her everything I could give her and I love her so much still. 
It just feels like all of that love was not enough. 
My lack of trust was slowly fading and I built more and more trust towards her but she just pushed me down again and again with her lack of good communication.

She works for a living, making about 20k less salary than me a year. She only asks her parents for money for emergencies like medical bills or groceries if she’s sick. She pays no rent, pays her insurance though. 

As a person who’s never seen more than $5k in my bank account it’s been a hard adjustment but the relationship is amazing otherwise. We acknowledge the income disparity between how we grew up (she told me recently she’s having her dad buy her a fancy espresso machine as she hates drip coffee now) and be sure to educate each other since we had very different upbringings. 

We’re planning a trip to a music festival next year, and her dad gave her $2k for christmas. My partner decided to buy something related to her passion that she’s quoted as costing $1600. She had an item to do her passion currently worth $1000 and i was under the impression she’d sell it like she was planning, now she said no. 

This vacation is going to cost $5000 out of pocket total, and i’m paying for the festival tickets and asked her to at least contribute $300-500 for her tickets. She sent me about $250. We had a convo about how finances stress her out as she doesn’t want to rely anymore than she does on her parents so i told her i’d cover costs for the trip she couldn’t. 

she’s getting a hotel for the first night essentially (total cost $200ish) and is buying her flight (she’s flying Southwest. Using her rewards pts flight only cost her $30) i refuse southwest, i dislike them so im flying separate there and same flight on the way back. im paying for everything else. 

I’m not pissed, but i am bothered by her getting this item that’s $1600 (she told me she needed money before her dad sent her xmas money so i was prepared to, now she doesn’t need it anymore) and ive only really seen her spend $300 towards this trip total when since ive started planning ive paid at least $750-$1000 so far out of pocket. 

WIBTA for asking my partner to contribute more to this trip? Even though her day to day finances are shorter than mine, she has generational wealth, the type of wealth where if her parents wanted to buy the $15k package to come to the festival they would do so and it wouldn’t hurt their pocket book.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Teeth whitening is one of the most sought-after cosmetic dental procedures today. Many people dream of having a bright, beautiful smile, and they often turn to whitening treatments to achieve this goal. Understanding the impact of teeth whitening before and after the treatment can help you make informed decisions about your dental care.

### Understanding Teeth Whitening

Teeth whitening refers to various methods of removing stains or discoloration from teeth. These stains can be due to factors such as:

- Food and drink consumption, like coffee, tea, or red wine.
- Tobacco use.
- Age-related changes, as teeth can naturally darken over time.
- Poor dental hygiene habits.

Before starting any whitening treatment, many individuals notice a desire for improvement. Comparisons of 'before and after' tooth photos often highlight dramatic differences—it's fascinating to see how much brighter and more youthful a smile can appear after whitening. This visual transformation not only enhances your appearance but can also boost your confidence significantly.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### The Process of Teeth Whitening

There are several options available for teeth whitening, ranging from professional treatments to at-home kits. The most common methods include:

- **In-office whitening:** This is done by a dentist and usually involves a concentrated bleaching agent. The effects are immediate, with many patients noticing a difference after just one visit.
- **At-home whitening kits:** These kits contain lower concentrations of bleach and may take longer to show results. They often include trays that mold to your teeth.
- **Whitening toothpaste:** These products can help remove surface stains but won't change the color of your natural teeth.

Regardless of the method chosen, the 'before and after' images tell a compelling story. Many patients report feeling more attractive and self-assured after their whitening procedures. This renewed confidence can spill over into other areas of life, such as professional interactions and social gatherings.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Expected Results: Before and After

Before undergoing a whitening procedure, it’s important to have realistic expectations. The results can vary based on several factors:

- **Individual dental health:** Those with healthier teeth typically will see better results.
- **Type and severity of stains:** Intrinsic stains, which are deeper within the tooth, may require more extensive treatment.
- **Method used:** In-office treatments usually provide quicker and more noticeable results compared to at-home kits.

After the process, many patients are thrilled with their brighter smiles. Improvements can range from several shades lighter to a dramatic transformation. Testimonials highlight that this change can positively affect both personal and professional lives.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### The Longevity of Results

The lasting impact of teeth whitening relies on maintenance. Here's how you can keep your smile radiant:

- Practice good oral hygiene by brushing twice and flossing daily.
- Limit intake of food and drinks known for staining teeth.
- Consider touch-up treatments every six months.

Keeping up with these practices allows you to maintain your bright smile for longer and enhances the results you've achieved through whitening.

### Is Teeth Whitening Right for You?

While many benefit from teeth whitening, it’s essential to consult with a dental professional before starting the process. Discussing your goals and any existing dental issues ensures that you choose a method that is safe and effective for your unique situation.

Ultimately, the impact of teeth whitening before and after can be life-changing. A brighter smile may lead to increased self-esteem, improved social interactions, and a greater willingness to show off your pearly whites.

Whether you’re looking to enhance your appearance or just want to boost your confidence, exploring teeth whitening might just be the answer. A beautiful smile awaits!

Natural Methods for Achieving Visible Results in Teeth Whitening
----------------------------------------------------------------

If you are looking for natural ways to brighten your smile, you're not alone. Many people want whiter teeth but prefer to use methods that don’t involve harsh chemicals. Fortunately, there are several simple and effective natural methods you can use to achieve visible results in teeth whitening.

### Understanding Natural Teeth Whitening

Natural teeth whitening refers to remedies that use ingredients sourced from nature to enhance the color of your teeth. These methods can often be less abrasive and more accessible than synthetic products. However, it's essential to maintain good oral hygiene for the best results.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Common Natural Remedies That Work

There are numerous natural teeth whitening options that you can easily integrate into your routine. Here are some of the most popular:

- **Baking Soda:** This gentle abrasive can help scrub away stains on your teeth. Mix a small amount of baking soda with water to make a paste. Brush your teeth with this paste a few times a week, but be cautious not to overdo it, as excessive use can wear down enamel.
- **Activated Charcoal:** Known for its detoxifying properties, activated charcoal can help remove toxins and surface stains from your teeth. Use it by dipping a wet toothbrush into the charcoal powder and brushing your teeth. Rinse thoroughly afterward!
- **Coconut Oil Pulling:** Swishing coconut oil in your mouth for about 15-20 minutes may help reduce plaque and bacteria, resulting in a healthier mouth and potentially whiter teeth. Afterward, spit it out and rinse your mouth with water.
- **Hydrogen Peroxide:** A diluted solution of hydrogen peroxide can be used as a mouthwash. Its mild bleaching properties can help lighten tooth color. Just mix equal parts water and hydrogen peroxide; swish it around in your mouth, then spit it out. Make sure to follow up with water to cleanse your mouth.
- **Strawberries:** These delicious fruits contain malic acid, which can naturally whiten teeth. Mash up a few strawberries and mix with baking soda to create a paste. Apply this mixture to your teeth for about five minutes before rinsing well.

### Enhancing Your Results

While using natural methods, you may want to consider incorporating good dental habits to enhance the results. Simple changes can make a significant difference:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Maintain Oral Hygiene:** Brushing twice a day and flossing daily help keep your teeth and gums healthy. This routine can prevent discoloration and promote a bright smile.
- **Avoid Staining Foods:** Certain foods and drinks like coffee, tea, red wine, and berries can stain your teeth. Limiting your intake or rinsing your mouth with water after consuming them can help keep your teeth whiter.
- **Regular Dental Check-Ups:** Professional cleanings can help remove tartar and stains that natural methods may not fully address. Regular visits to your dentist can also ensure your overall oral health is in check.

### Monitor Your Progress

Tracking your whitening progress can be motivating. Consider taking before and after photos weekly to see how far you've come. Along with visual changes, pay attention to how your teeth feel too! Healthy teeth can have a significant impact on your smile's brightness.

Remember that results may vary from person to person. Patience is key; many natural methods may take longer to show visible improvements compared to commercial products. However, the benefits of using safer, nature-based approaches can be well worth the wait.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Be Cautious

Not all methods work for everyone. Always do a patch test with new ingredients and consult with your dentist, particularly if you have sensitive teeth or existing dental issues. Your dental professional can provide tailored advice to ensure you're using the most effective and safe methods.

With persistence and the right approach, you can achieve a brighter smile naturally. Focusing on these methods will not only help improve the appearance of your teeth but also contribute to your overall oral health. A whiter smile can boost your confidence, making these natural routines well worth your effort!

### Conclusion

Transforming your smile through teeth whitening before and after can be a game-changer in boosting your confidence and enhancing your overall appearance. It’s not just about having whiter teeth; it's about the positive effects a bright smile can have on your self-esteem and social interactions. The contrast between the before and after images is often striking, showcasing how effective the right whitening techniques can be.

If you prefer a more natural approach, there are numerous methods to achieve visible results without harsh chemicals. Remedies like baking soda, hydrogen peroxide, and activated charcoal are popular choices for those looking to enhance their smile safely at home. These techniques can often provide gratifying outcomes while minimizing the risk of tooth sensitivity that some commercial whitening products may cause.

Always remember that results can vary from person to person. Factors such as natural tooth color, age, and dental hygiene play a significant role in the effectiveness of whitening treatments. It's essential to maintain realistic expectations and to choose a teeth whitening method that suits your individual needs and preferences.

1hfo7qg,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1hfo7qg/aitah_when_i_try_to_articulate_my_experiences/,AITAH when I TRY to articulate my experiences from last few months to my boyfriend and he decides turn the conversation around,"First of all, I know that I’m not the asshole of this whole situation. And second of all I want to say sorry bc english isn’t my first language.

So I opened up to my bf this morning ab our common time that’s not been so much in this month. I was just wokened up and crying, bc he woke me up ab 15min before he left to work. I can say that I have bpd and haven’t seen my therapist ab 2 weeks and have botteled up my emotions a lot. Bc of that it’s hard to tell my boyfriend with respectful tone things that have been in my mind lately.

So I had a incriminating tone when texted him that I think he haven’t been making time for us and I think he doesn’t even care about our time. That few months back we did so much better and now I feel like he doesn’t even care ab our situation: when he goes to work I sleep and he takes my alarms off so this means we can’t be together at morning and when he comes home at 10pm he almost fall asleep asap.

I translate my text here:
”I don’t know what to say. I think you changed after ur new workplace and it shows up like u don’t want to be with me or it is not necessary to you. Few months earlier we could have woke up and drink coffee together, clean up the house and be together. But now you just say that you care and I believe the shit out of you. I have not been feeling that you care and I have been thinking it’s bc of your work and how much you spend time there, but now when I have been home most of the days it’s not excuse anymore. I understand that our sleep schedule makes things hard, but this morning you took my alarms off and these would make mornings different. You say that you tried once woke me up, but your actions say different things.”

He responded:
”Okay. I had a hard time to wake up this morning and got to work just in time. This is now unfair. I have changed bc of my insecurities and I feel like I do almost everything wrong. I feel like it’s pointless even try. You have fucking changed after that diagnosis, you cant take responsibility of your own actions and you don’t even care ab my feelings. This doesn’t work just in one way. You keep me up til 5am and assume that we wake up early. Go yourself and think your actions, this isn’t ab diagnosis when you act this way. I try to be better even tho I have my own.”

I thought that it’s okay if I can’t immediatly tell my thoughts and feelings respectfully, even tho I said that I understand that our sleeping schedule is crap and make things harder. But I was wrong and now we argue and I’m more upset with him than usual. I opened up yesterday about my new bpd diagnosis that I got month ago and he decides first to reply in this situation using my bpd against me. I went to spiral and couldn’t take it easily, bc most recently last week he used the thing my narcissistic mother said to me, when I called her out from child abuse, against me: that my therapy isn’t working. 

He tries to gashlight me into thinking like I keep him up even tho HE wanted to know more about bpd and I said that I am scared to tell bc him using this against me. 

I didin’t mean what I said just to mean this morning. I meant overall last few months.

So to the point: AITAH?
Should I just understand his anger when I have a hard time to articulate my thoughts and feelings? Should I just understand that he doesn’t mean what he say? Should I just smile and suffer when we can’t make time to us? Am I The AssHole when I try to get this conversation started even tho he acts like this towards me?

We have been together four years now and his toxic trait is this behaviour when he gets anger. I always think that this gets better but I’m losing hope now. He is love of my life and I got into therapy bc I had my own shitty behaviour patterns and couldn’t take it anymore. Now I just think that I should breakup or I never get really better when he triggers me with my insecurities.",1,1734369742.0,AITAH,0,1.0,False
1hfo6qu,https://www.reddit.com/r/cfs/comments/1hfo6qu/can_it_be_cfs_if_the_only_symptoms_i_have_are/,Can it be CFS if the only symptoms I have are heavy legs/arms and anxiety? ,"Hi everyone,

I’m trying to figure out if I might have CFS (Chronic Fatigue Syndrome) or if this could be something else. For context, I had Long Covid a while back and dealt with symptoms like heavy arms and legs that felt like they were full of cement. Thankfully, those symptoms went away for a while, but now they seem to be back.

Here’s what I’m experiencing:

* **Heavy limbs**: My arms and legs feel incredibly heavy, like they’re weighed down with cement, especially when I’ve overdone it physically or mentally.
* **Anxiety/impending doom**: If I’ve pushed myself too far, am really tired, or even after having coffee, I get this overwhelming sense of anxiety or a feeling like something bad is about to happen.
* **Fatigue link**: The symptoms seem to worsen if I overexert myself, though I’m not sure if it’s consistent with post-exertional malaise (PEM).

I’m curious if this sounds familiar to anyone with CFS or other conditions like dysautonomia or post-viral syndromes. Does this sound like CFS to you? If you’ve experienced anything similar, I’d love to hear your insights as I am so so scared about this one. I'm in training college for the army and will most likely have to drop out if it is CFS. 

Thanks in advance!",1,1734369672.0,cfs,1,1.0,False

Hosting on Airbnb has been rewarding in ways I never expected—it’s brought financial independence, meaningful connections, and even lifelong friendships. But it also came with lessons I wish I’d known from day one.

>If you’re considering hosting, here’s what I’ve learned, plus my top tips for new Airbnb hosts. Ready to dive in? Use my [Airbnb referral link](https://www.airbnb.com/r/mariar2903?s=6&t=061n0g) to start hosting today and earn bonus rewards when you sign up!

# 1. People Make Hosting Worth It

The best part of hosting? The people. From travelers passing through to long-term guests, I’ve built incredible relationships, including my two best friends, Jerry and Elke, who started as guests in my Airbnb. Hosting isn’t just about accommodations — it’s about connection.

# 2. Learn Airbnb Policies Early

One of my first challenges as a host was navigating tricky situations like late checkouts and cleaning disputes. My advice? Familiarize yourself with [Airbnb’s policie](https://chatgpt.com/c/6758fa7d-783c-8009-aec3-3a43dc1e025d#:~:text=Center%3A%20Hosting-,Basics,-Link%20this%20to)s from the start. Knowing how to handle these situations proactively will save you stress.

# 3. Your Space Doesn’t Have to Be a Tourist Destination

My Airbnb isn’t in a major city or tourist hub. Most of my guests stay while passing through to nearby universities or the capital. What makes my space unique? My dog, cat, and lush collection of houseplants. Guests frequently mention how much they love these personal touches in their reviews. Find what makes your space special and highlight it.

# 4. Long-Term Guests = Less Work

I’ve hosted guests for just a day and others for over a year. Long-term stays are my favorite because they mean fewer turnovers, fewer cleanings, and more time to build relationships. If you’re just starting out, consider offering discounts for longer stays — it’s a win-win for both you and your guests. Or you can use managment companies like [TurnoverBnb](https://turnoverbnb.com/) for simplicity!

# 5. Communication Is Key

Overcommunicate! Guests appreciate [clear instructions, detailed house rules, and proactive updates](https://chatgpt.com/c/6758fa7d-783c-8009-aec3-3a43dc1e025d#:~:text=Use%20Airbnb%E2%80%99s%20Automated-,Messaging,-Tools%0ALink%20this). Whether it’s a guide for check-in or tips on using the coffee maker, providing extra detail ensures a smooth experience for everyone. Happy guests leave great reviews, which boost your bookings.

# 6. Invest in Your Airbnb Listing

Your listing is your storefront. High-quality photos and a compelling description are essential for attracting guests. Use natural light to take pictures, and highlight unique features of your space, whether it’s cozy décor, pet-friendly policies, or proximity to local attractions. Make your listing stand out in a sea of options.

# 7. Reviews Matter — Both Ways

Guests review you, and you review them. Leaving thoughtful, honest feedback encourages great guest behavior and helps future hosts. If a review ever concerns you, Airbnb’s support team is there to help mediate.

# 8. Expect the Unexpected

From plumbing emergencies to last-minute cancellations, hosting is unpredictable. Always have an emergency fund for repairs and a backup plan for unexpected situations. Flexibility is key to thriving as a host.

# 9. Personal Touches Make a Big Difference

Small gestures go a long way. A handwritten welcome note, fresh flowers, or local snacks can turn a good stay into a memorable one. These personal touches help you stand out and earn glowing reviews.

# 10. Just Start

If you’re overwhelmed by the idea of hosting, take the leap. You don’t need to have everything perfect at first. Communication and kindness go a long way, and you’ll improve with every guest. The rewards of hosting — from financial independence to meaningful connections — are worth it.

# Why Hosting on Airbnb is Life-Changing

Hosting has allowed me to meet incredible people, gain financial independence, and transform how I think about hospitality. Whether you’re looking to earn extra income, connect with travelers, or start a side hustle, Airbnb hosting can be your next great adventure.

Saw her on the app again when I recreated my account and thought I'd give it a shot, and we matched.

She's gorgeous, conversation has been great etc., and yesterday we set up a coffee date for this weekend. We've had some back and forth banter, lots of joking around etc.

She definitely comes across as having no shortage of confidence, which isn't a bad thing. She's told me she's been called intimidating before, but has a soft/sweet side she shows to people that she feels deserve it. She described herself as a peach, so I just jokingly asked for proof. 

She said she's hilarious and cute and sweet to those she decides to deserve to see that side (all valid things to say). But then she said ""my god complex is more than willing to pump my ego up"". 

I asked what she meant and she said ""I'm pretty awesome and I know it. At least I'm self aware I have a bit of a god complex""

And now I just don't know what to make of that lmao. It's possible she's joking or exaggerating about her confidence level. But I'm almost starting to wonder if this is a red flag/example of narcissism. I haven't even met her yet though so it's hard to say.

1hfnz0l,https://www.reddit.com/r/POTS/comments/1hfnz0l/treatment_options/,Treatment Options,"So recently my electrophysiologist more or less confirmed my POTs diagnosis. It's been something I've been suspicious of for a while and I finally found a doctor who listens. I was originally diagnosed with Inappropriate Sinus Tachycardia when I was about 12. Though until recently I didn't know it was also a form of dysautomia. So back in October, I got a loop recorder put in, which has been a life savior compared to dealing with external heart monitors. I went in last week to talk to my doctor about changing medications because my heart rate has not been good. My Apple watch goes off almost constantly with high heart rate notifications, even when sitting at my desk at home.    My heart rate jumps from the 60s up to 170s. It's a mess, symptoms and fainting sucks. I'm currently on Clonidine, Fludrocortisone and just started diltiazem. Worse part of that combination is my blood pressure is already pretty low. Like my normal is like 110/75 so adding more medications to drop my blood pressure is.. concerning. 

Doctor wants to put me on corlanor but insurance won't approve it, I've been on metoprolol, flecainide, amlodipine (still on for raynauds but listing cause it affects all this. ) I'm also limited on what medications I can take due to either other health problems or the fact that I just got done with chemo earlier this year. A lot of medications not only for my heart, but for my autoimmune got tossed out the window because of the cancer. 

I'm not having ANY luck with getting my heart rate under control on these medications. As I'm typing this, my heart rate is 121 BPM, and I'm sitting on my butt at my desk drinking liquid IV. I've cut out most caffeine, which I admit is hard because I have ADHD as well, and having at least a cup of coffee in the morning is life-changing even though I'm on medication. Yes, I have tried coming off my ADHD meds to see if that helped my heart rate, and it didn't. I'm miserable; I've been gaining weight insanely quickly because I just can't be active like I once could. I admit my diet isn't the best, but it's not the worst either. I'd like to be able to go on short walks daily or something to start training my heart better and lose weight because I know that'll help. I just.. can't. I get woozy and have to sit down just when cooking dinner, I took my son to the science museum and used a cane to get around and the fatigue I'm feeling is unbelievable. I walked so slow too and sat down plenty. 

I know increasing salt intake is supposed to help, but will it make that big of a difference when I'm not getting any relief from other things? I'm currently drinking 1-2 liquid IVs a day and trying to drink more water. I'm not too fond of salt so adding more salt into my diet has been challenging. I also talked to the doctor about infusions as I've seen some people get those and it helps, and was informed we don't have those available in my state (I'm in Oklahoma) I'd have to go to Dallas which is about 3 and half hours away and then because I'm on state insurance right now, I highly doubt they'd pay for it. 

  
I'm getting more and more dilapidated as the days go on, and I don't know what to even do anymore. My son is about to be 5, and I hate that he is always telling people that his mom is really sick, I hate that he knows to go get either my mom or my boyfriend when I faint. He's even started mimicking some of my symptoms (usually to get out of doing something). I accepted when I was battling cancer last year that my life would never be the same and I would have limitations, but this is getting out of control. 

Any advice that I receive I will talk to my doctors about before doing, I just need some sort of idea of maybe where to head at this point. Thank you to anyone who reads this long post in advance. ",1,1734369129.0,POTS,0,1.0,False

I was making coffee and pottering about and suddenly I hear a sound no parent wants to hear: a loud thump on our FUCKING TILE FLOOR and a thin fretful wail and my husband screaming out baby’s name. I flung my phone and coffee cup down and sprinted in…

my husband had fallen back asleep while “holding onto baby’s foot” and the child had crawled over the edge of the bed and hit the floor. I grabbed him and held him close; he seemed fine but a bit scared, and had a bump on his head. I immediately ran to the living room and got in touch with the pediatrician and was instructed to monitor him and if he showed any lethargy, not acting right, vomiting, to come in. so far he is fine TG. 


my husband is now very grumpy. when I was holding bub on the couch and nursing him he came out and glared at me. 

“just say it. SAY IT.” I stared at him. “I’m not saying anything.” he frowned and shuffled back to bed. 


now it’s past 11, he has to leave for work in two hours, and he hasn’t even gotten his arse out of bed never mind begun his 45 minute daily shit and shower ritual.

When it arrived - large pieces of the hotplate were simply not there - like they had broken away exposing the material underneath the surface. There were no pieces anywhere in the packaging ... so it made it into the carton like that. Not a great first look. So the instruction manual says ""DO NOT RETURN TO STORE"" right? So I reached out to Mocca USA who told me it would be faster to exchange the faulty machine where I purchased it since they could not really send me a replacement hot plate (not user serviceable). Long story short - exchanges were not possible I could only return it and then repurchase the item from where I had originally bought it. But time had moved on - Black Friday and Cyber Monday were gone and the prices back to regular - and no Juniper even available! Meanwhile Moccamaster USA checked in with me to see if an exchange had been possible or if I wanted to return my unit to them for warranty service. This was an option not previously explored but ... I had already returned my machine to the retailer - so I replied to the email telling them that I no longer had the coffeemaker, that prices had gone back up and no Juniper. I didn't ask for anything, just said I was disappointed. After a day or so - they got back to me and offered to sell me a Juniper unit directly from Moccamaster at the discounted price I had originally purchased it for during the Black Friday/Cyber Week. I have to admit I was impressed and they sent me an invoice for a Juniper KGBV at the same price I had paid originally with the discount. What really impressed me is that this was offered - I did not ask for it. And - the new machine arrived today in perfect condition and makes coffee like a champ.

In Louisa, an unbearable social crisis has become the main source of economic opportunity.

Oliver Whang visited Louisa many times over a few years for this article, speaking to people in addiction and recovery, medical staff, teachers, police officers, judges and local business owners.

* Dec. 11, 2024

Louisa, Ky., is a small town of about 2,600 on the border of West Virginia with a single pair of railroad tracks running through it. If you follow these tracks south, against the flow of the Big Sandy River, you’ll go between the public library and the Main Street Park and over Lick Creek, one of the manifold creeks that web eastern Kentucky like capillaries. Follow Lick Creek past a baseball diamond and a pawnshop and you’ll arrive behind an ordinary gray mobile home in a small lot of grass where Ingrid Jackson was living in the fall of 2023. The days were still long and the afternoon sun settled gently on nearby mountains, turning leaves a lambent red. Reedy gospel music played from inside the trailer, announcing Jackson’s presence as she opened the door. Her hair, normally figured in light brown curls, was packed into a shower cap. She smiled from the entryway. It was a smile difficult not to smile back at.

Jackson had never lived in a trailer before, or a small town. She was born in Louisville, the daughter of a man with schizophrenia who, in 1983, decapitated a 76-year-old woman. Jackson was 1 at the time. In 2010, at 27, she was in a car accident and was prescribed pain pills. Not long after that, she began using heroin. Over the next decade she went through nine rounds of addiction rehab. Each ended in relapse. Her most recent one came in 2022 after her son was sentenced to life in prison for murder; he was 21. In Louisville on Christmas Day she called a residential rehab company named Addiction Recovery Care, which has its headquarters in Louisa. So now she was here, in Appalachian coal country, in a trailer along Lick Creek, in a town a tiny fraction the size of her home city, working as a nursing assistant in a nearby nursing home, sharing a trailer with Latasha Kidd, a local woman 12 years her junior with a mountain accent, a fade and blood-orange bangs. “This is culture shock,” Jackson said. “I’m a city girl, and there’s not a lot of us around, and I’m like: Mama!”

Jackson and Kidd were about as different as you could make them. Jackson was Black, Kidd white; Jackson outgoing, Kidd reserved; Jackson neat, Kidd messy; Jackson devout, Kidd agnostic; Jackson straight, Kidd queer. Still, they became fast friends in rehab and now, five months out, inhabited a somewhat fragile existence together, in the period of addiction recovery that many people in long-term recovery say is the most difficult: the space between leaving rehab and getting back on your feet. [More than a million people](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2019/crime-in-the-u.s.-2019/topic-pages/persons-arrested) in the United States are arrested every year on drug-related charges, and for them, finding a steady job, consistent housing and reliable transportation can be even more difficult than the tremors, hallucinations and nausea of detox. [Studies have shown](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11920-011-0224-0) that relapse rates for people in recovery may be as high as 85 percent within the first year. Another woman with whom Kidd and Jackson went through recovery, who was supposed to live with them, relapsed and overdosed the day before moving in.

Jackson often worried that something similar might happen to Kidd, who had struggled with addiction so long that, until recently, she didn’t know how to pay her bills. At 29, Kidd hadn’t yet held a full-time job. “So I have to push her sometimes,” Jackson said. “ ’Cause when I want to go in my own direction, I don’t want Tasha to be left upside-down.”

In eastern Kentucky, a region plagued by poverty and at the heart of the country’s opioid epidemic, the burden of addressing this treatment gap has mainly been taken up by addiction-rehab companies. Many stand more like community centers or churches than medical clinics, offering not just chemical but also spiritual and logistical services with the aim of helping people in addiction find employment and re-enter society. And in the two five-year periods between 2008 and 2017, eight of the 10 counties in America with the [steepest decline](https://www.norc.org/content/dam/norc-org/pdfs/Understanding%20Declining%20Rates%20of%20Drug%20Overdose%20Mortality%20in%20Eastern%20Kentucky.pdf) in [overdose mortality rates](https://opioidmisusetool.norc.org/) were in eastern Kentucky. The state now has more residential treatment beds per person than any other state in the country, and [provisional data](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/sosmap/drug_poisoning_mortality/drug_poisoning.htm) show that, in the 12 months ending on June 30 this year, the number of overdose deaths dropped by 20 percent over the previous 12-month period. Eastern Kentucky is one of the places where you’re most likely to die of a drug addiction but also the place where you’re most likely to receive treatment for it.

Among the rehab companies around, none have taken this holistic recovery philosophy further than Addiction Recovery Care. ARC, whose motto is “Crisis to Career,” has treated tens of thousands of people in addiction since its founding in 2008. In the 2010s, as the power utility moved away from coal energy, the area lost hundreds of mining jobs, and ARC began buying up abandoned buildings and turning them into businesses staffed by clients in recovery. There is an event-planning brick-and-mortar, a cafe, a bakery, a small gallery, an old theater that the company renovated, a pharmacy, a welding company, an accredited Christian college, a private Christian school, a landscaping company and an auto-body shop. All are owned and run by ARC and its chief executive, Tim Robinson.

About half of the company’s 1,000 current employees in the state are in recovery from some kind of substance-use disorder, and one-third have gone through one of the company’s more than 30 residential-rehab programs themselves. ARC has formed relationships with several accredited colleges and trade schools and in 2023 received $130 million from Medicaid, making it the state’s largest provider of treatments for substance-use disorders; that year, ARC bought a psychiatric hospital in Russell, Ky., and began planning to open centers in Ohio and Virginia.

The company’s rapid growth may have helped draw the attention of the F.B.I., which in August [made public an investigation](https://forms.fbi.gov/arctips) into ARC for potential health-care fraud. In Louisa, there was skepticism about the company’s place in town, which turned on rumors of exploitation and brainwashing and greed. “It’s like ARC has taken over everything,” a resident told me once. “People joke that it’s a cult.” Around town, the company’s logo, a drawing of an ark, popped up on buildings and lawn signs and brick walls, often next to images of Noah Thompson, a young country singer from town who, in 2022, won “American Idol.” He had worked for ARC, in construction.

Jackson and Kidd, both of whom had criminal records, were among the first group of ARC graduates to complete their nursing-assistant training while in recovery, as part of a new collaboration between the company and a local nursing home. Their co-workers described them as the most beloved caretakers on staff, and neither had missed a day of work since starting there in July. David McKenzie Jr., the nursing home’s sandy-haired owner and administrator, was one of their biggest proponents. “They’re ready to run through walls,” he said. “I see tremendous effort, tremendous willpower, determination, grit. They have transformed my view.”

McKenzie first approached Robinson in February 2021 amid a labor shortage caused by the pandemic. Like other supporters of ARC, he sees the potential of a combined humanitarian-commercial approach to addiction treatment: Not only can it be used to address a systemic health issue in the region, not only can it return meaning to people who have lost their way, but, in doing so, it can bring life back to the region. “We were a coal community,” McKenzie told me. “And that’s disappeared over the past few decades; it’s by and large gone now. And now we have a new industry, and it’s addiction recovery. And it’s revitalized our town.”

**Tim Robinson moved** to Louisa in 2005. He grew up about 30 miles south of town and came back after completing his law degree to work as an assistant county prosecutor. His docket, he quickly found, was grim. Nearly every case had something to do with opioids — use, trafficking, theft, abuse, assault — and most defendants ended up in jail. Kevin Mullins, who was the district-court judge in nearby Letcher County for 15 years before his death in September, told me there were so few treatment centers in 2009 in eastern Kentucky that, if someone came into court wanting to go to rehab, they would have to wait several weeks for a bed a hundred miles away. “Our knee-jerk reaction was, we’re going to incarcerate ourselves out of this problem,” Mullins said. “That approach has continued to haunt us.” In 2021, [Kentucky was found to have the second-highest jail incarceration rate](https://vera-institute.files.svdcdn.com/production/downloads/publications/the-criminalization-of-poverty-in-kentucky-report.pdf) and the 10th-highest prison incarceration rate in the country.

Robinson himself was an alcoholic and was arrested twice for public intoxication. One day in the winter of 2006, he came to work hung over and, on running into a local pastor, prayed with him. “When I stood from my praying, I felt like the burdens of my life literally fell off my back,” he said. “That started the process of me forgiving myself.” He got sober. A few months later, in the summer of 2007, he quit his job and began trying to open an addiction-treatment center for women in Louisa — what would later become Addiction Recovery Care.

It was difficult to get the business off the ground. “I had people come up to me in restaurants, wherever, say, ‘We don’t want what you’re trying to do, we don’t want those people,’” Robinson told me. Financially, there were other restrictions. Most people in eastern Kentucky could not afford private insurance, and federal insurance plans didn’t cover addiction treatment. When Robinson finally opened his first rehab as a nonprofit in 2010, much of his funding came from family, friends and church donations. A vast majority of the revenue came from treatment vouchers issued by Operation UNITE, a state-funded nonprofit group formed in 2003 in response to Kentucky’s opioid epidemic. Everyone on staff was a volunteer.

Then in 2013, Kentucky’s governor, Steve Beshear — father of the state’s current governor, Andy Beshear — expanded Medicaid’s addiction-treatment benefit under the Affordable Care Act to cover residential care for people in addiction. A new funding model appeared. Though the state paid for only 30 days of residential care, its coverage of treatments was comprehensive, which allowed Robinson to take in more insured clients, charge for more services and open more rehabs. This tracked a statewide trend that began with the Medicaid expansion. In 2014, [there were 347 qualified addiction-treatment centers or hospitals in the state](https://www.samhsa.gov/data/sites/default/files/2014_National_Survey_of_Substance_Abuse_Treatment_Services/2014_National_Survey_of_Substance_Abuse_Treatment_Services/2014_National_Survey_of_Substance_Abuse_Treatment_Services.pdf), 170 of which accepted Medicaid. By 2020, [there were 477 treatment centers](https://www.samhsa.gov/data/report/national-survey-substance-abuse-treatment-services-n-ssats-2019-data-substance-abuse), 382 of which accepted Medicaid.

I first spoke to Robinson in his office in 2021. It was a spacious room on the top floor of ARC’s headquarters in Louisa, between the Food City and the county courthouse, filled with mementos to the mid-20th-century Los Angeles Dodgers. Robinson was large behind his desk, cutting the image of a lay preacher, with lively hazel eyes and a well-trimmed dark beard. By that point ARC owned more than two dozen treatment centers and had helped turn Kentucky into what Mullins called a “treatment on demand” state: Most people in addiction could get a bed in rehab within 24 hours of asking for one, regardless of their insurance. Lawn signs dotted the town, advertising the company’s “telecare” rehab effort, called ARC Anywhere.

Over the years, as I spent more time getting to know people who went through rehab at ARC, I began to notice a certain archetypal story that drifted down from Robinson to his executives to his employees and clients. It opened with horror. One man I spoke to struggled with addiction since his teens, was in and out of jail and was still trying to put his life back together when his daughter went into the hospital for surgery and died. He overdosed in the parking garage of the hospital, then spent more than a year using heavily until he was ordered to rehab by a court. Kayla Parsons, who was born 45 minutes north of Louisa, was sexually assaulted at 19, after which she turned to drugs. She became pregnant with her first daughter at 21, was arrested for drug trafficking, went to rehab, relapsed, lost custody of her daughter, was arrested again, went to jail, got sober, relapsed again. In 2016, her family sent her, dope-sick, to an ARC treatment center. “I didn’t see a way out,” she told me. “I thought the only way out of that was going to be death. So every single time I got high, my one and only goal was to overdose.”

At some point, there would come an intimation of hope. For Parsons, it was when she heard about ARC’s commitment to find jobs for clients. Many workers at ARC facilities are interns, paid a small stipend for half a year while they transition from clients to employees. They train to be peer-support advisers at outpatient clinics and work as receptionists at residential centers and cashiers at Masterpiece Café, which is ARC’s coffee shop in downtown Louisa. Freedom Fabrication, Robinson’s welding shop, trains people in addiction for a welding career. His auto-body shop, Second Chance Auto, employs almost exclusively people in recovery. Many of the company’s outpatient and residential-treatment centers are lined with framed testimonials from clients turned employees, each a journey starting at a nadir, each one its own miracle. Parsons is now the senior vice president of administration at ARC and married to a man she met through recovery. “That is a huge part of it, changing that narrative — Oh, I can have a career,” she told me. “But on the other side of it is: I don’t have to be that awful human, but that awful human isn’t wasted, either.”

Robinson recapitulates these points when talking about his business. His experience as assistant prosecutor, his working-class childhood, his history of addiction, his baseball obsession — which began in elementary school as a trading-card business and led to a mentorship from the local bank president and now serves as inspiration for the company’s vocational and peer-support specialist training — combine to describe an almost holy struggle against social injustice to bring a depressed region back from the brink. Since the days of coal companies, the regional economy has largely been run from afar, often to poor effect. Mineral rights were systematically signed away by unsuspecting landowners; black lung continues to plague miners and their families in the area; an accelerated phase of the opioid epidemic began in Central Appalachia when Purdue Pharma promoted OxyContin to doctors serving poor laborers. Dispatches in the national news often cite high poverty rates, overdose rates, obesity rates and widespread emigration — “Go look at any bad list, we’re toward the top, and all the good lists, we’re toward the bottom,” Robinson told me.

In a region whose destiny had long been determined by outsiders, ARC’s success was Louisa’s redemption in Robinson’s telling; he recast the story of the town. “We’ve not been part of writing the next part of the narrative,” Robinson said, picking up a printed map of ARC’s treatment centers. “But when I look at this,” he said, shaking the paper, “this is one thing we’ve done. This has been us.”

**When I first met** Jackson and Kidd, they had been living in their trailer together for nearly half a year. They met at a small ARC recovery center in Louisa in late 2022. Jackson was the only Black woman in the facility, and one of the most garrulous, often saying things like “Every day is a good day” and “My greatest asset is my alcoholism.” She was the loudest woman in church, praising wildly, flinging her arms about her. “I had to sit six feet back,” said Kidd, who grew up about 45 minutes west of town in a county where 99 percent of the population was white.

Kidd was more reserved than Jackson, sometimes spending much of her nonworking day on the couch under a blanket. She had entered rehab after a seven-month stint in jail, so she was used to the daily limitations — 6 a.m. wake-up time, reading material restricted to faith-based literature, punishments for breaking house rules. But she found it difficult to buy into the treatment itself. She had been using pain pills since she was 9, she told me, and her parents were addicted to opioids, but she had never spoken at length about her addiction. She lost custody of her four children after being arrested on child-endangerment charges relating to her stepson; the older two were in Alabama with her grandmother, and the younger two, twins, were in Kentucky with her aunt. Now, in treatment, Kidd was constantly being asked to reflect on these facts, which she found almost unbearable. “For a long time I thought that my Mamaw had took them,” she said of her children. Eventually she realized that she had abandoned them. Sometimes she would shove the center’s door open and sprint toward the road. She would stop at the pavement each time, turn around and walk back inside.

Jackson entered treatment three months after Kidd, but she made progress quickly. A model patient, she adhered to a precise schedule even by rehab standards. She rose at 4:30 a.m. every day to write in her journal, composed letters to her incarcerated son and sat in front of small books full of devotions, whispering them over and over, folding down the corner of the page when she was done. As two of the oldest patients in the center, Kidd and Jackson began spending more time together, acting like the elder statesmen of the group. The other women in the center started calling them the older sisters, and Kidd started taking on some of Jackson’s confidence. She came out as a lesbian and began wearing a rainbow pride shirt that Jackson had ordered for her online. She was baptized and began praying with Jackson in church.

Eventually the pair began training at David McKenzie’s nursing home together. They worked constantly, excited by the prospect of getting out. Coming from poverty, with criminal records, finding employment without ARC’s help was a dubious prospect. “Multiple times throughout my life, I’d go to prison, get out, there’s nothing to do,” said Michael Clark, who was addicted to opioids for two decades before going through treatment elsewhere and landing a job at ARC in 2018. When money got tight, Clark’s grandmother crocheted blankets for sale, but with no similar skill to fall back on, Clark would resort to dealing. “The worst time in my life wasn’t when I was using; it was when I was clean but I couldn’t find a job,” he told me.

Kidd and Jackson moved through the program in only a few months. After graduating, in July of 2023, they rented a trailer from McKenzie’s father, and each morning walked together across the creek for 12-hour shifts. Jackson, who had just turned 42, was saving up to buy a car, and Kidd, who didn’t have a license, was studying for her permit.

By the time I met them, the thrill of their new independence had worn off, and a mundane reality had set in. “Right now it’s just work and back, work and back,” Kidd said. The boredom felt more dangerous than anything. This is something that many people in recovery realize. No matter how much you change in treatment, whether you find a new religion or a new partner, you’ll find your old self waiting for you back in the real world. Beneath the promises of peer-support specialists, the gleam of vocational programs and the excitement of a new job in a new town where few people know your name are the same impulses, the same issues, that drove your addiction.

In response, Jackson leaned into her structure and her faith. Her bed was always made with a floral quilt, prayer books stacked neatly in a bag, certificates spaced regularly along her dresser. She made daily calls to her daughter in Louisville. Everything became a sign of deliverance: the first month’s rent, which McKenzie covered while she and Kidd were getting on their feet; the furniture that employees at the nursing home had provided, the Section 8 housing vouchers she was in the process of applying for. “When I say God provided all this, I mean God provided this,” Jackson told me. “I called my mom and I said, ‘God is going to put me up on an Appalachian mountain!’”

For Kidd, every day seemed to present some new complication. The caseworker from the Department for Community Based Services was difficult to reach, one of her children fell ill and she wasn’t able to go for her weekly visit, a new client at the nursing home wouldn’t stop screaming. She had been receiving injections of naltrexone in rehab to help with her withdrawal, but transitioned off them. One day, feeling suffocated, she walked to an ARC outpatient clinic and obtained Suboxone, a mild opioid often used to help people remain sober. Scared of getting high, she later flushed the tablets. “I have days where I come back and I just cry, because I’m trying to be an adult, and it’s tough,” she said. “Sometimes I just wish I could go back to being a kid.”

**On a sunny day** in the fall of 2023 I walked to a pawnshop in downtown Louisa. Leaves were on the ground outside, their dry tips curling inward, and the sidewalk was gritty with dust. Inside, the shelves were mostly barren, a few loose wires dangling off old kitchen appliances. In the far corner a man with short white hair stood behind a glass case filled with pistols and knives, packing dip into his bottom lip. His name was Mike Hudson, and he was the store’s owner. When I asked him about Addiction Recovery Care, he began speaking broadly about the state of the addiction epidemic nationwide: Federal officials weren’t doing enough to target gangs moving contraband across the border; law enforcement was too soft on drug use. Locally, he said, there seemed to be a better balance between support and punishment. “Tim Robinson, he gives them every chance,” he said, of people in addiction. “They put them through the program, they give them a job. But he won’t stand for you peeing dirty. They got to want it themselves.”

The door creaked open, and a man and a woman walked in. The woman had red hair and thick foundation on her face; the man was large and square. They were both carrying Big Gulps. As Hudson continued speaking, I could see the woman glancing our way. She sidled closer, then said, “What you say about ARC is right.” She had been sober since 2014, she said, and her partner had been sober five and a half years — he had just been released from prison. The woman said that he had been addicted to heroin and meth. I saw his teeth, which were few and rotten, elongated like thin dominoes. “I tried to get him in two rehabs, he didn’t want it, he didn’t do it,” she said.

“I just walked out,” the man said. That changed after he was locked up, with no other option but to face his recovery. “The main thing is, if you don’t want it, you aren’t going to do it.” He sipped the drink in his hand.

“We got to have stronger punishment systems,” the woman said. “Used to be, if you had two grams of meth, you’d get eight, 10 years. Now you can get out in 48 hours.”

Hudson interjected: “My biggest problem is, we got hundreds of thousands of people sitting on death row, costing us. Go ahead and execute them, and then you have space for the rest.”

As I had found in the years since I first visited town, this kind of pontificating was inescapable. People’s opinions about addiction treatment in general were often mixed with their personal struggles with addiction — or the struggles of those they knew — and their opinions about addiction in general were often conflated with their opinions about Addiction Recovery Care. A result was a muddle of criticism. There was the company-as-offering-salvation narrative from people like Robinson, but among other Louisans, there was at best a charged ambivalence toward the company and its mission, and, at worst, outright hostility. Complaints were varied: ARC was attracting addicts; it was dominating smaller businesses, running them into the ground; it was increasing crime in the area; it was profiting off vulnerable people.

“A lot of good things came from them being there, you can’t deny that,” said one Louisan, who asked to remain anonymous out of fear of retaliation from the company. “I still don’t like them. I don’t like Robinson. I think he uses religion and addiction to make himself rich. I don’t trust him.”

“They do not have a good reputation, they do not,” someone else from town told me. “But I wish they had come a little sooner, for my brother.” He died, addicted, a decade ago.

The more enmeshed ARC became with Louisa, the more complicated the recovery dynamics grew. The company and town formed a polychrome ball of altruistic idealism, entrepreneurial ambition and small-town drama. To analyze, for example, the financial benefits of ARC without factoring in the stigma around addiction or the politics of religion or the sentimental attachment lifelong residents formed with their hometown would be like trying to extract the blue Play-Doh out of the brown blend you get after massaging all the colors together. When Lisa Robertson, a real estate agent with an office in downtown Louisa, praised the company and offered me two extra tickets to “Little Shop of Horrors,” showing at the ARC-run Garden Theater, was it because ARC had been good for her business or because she was happy that they were “saving a lot of people” or because she had her lawn mowed by ARC’s Second Chance Lawn Care or because she sent her two children to the ARC-run private school? When Tracie Cavins, who owns a novelties store off South Main Cross Street, told me that she saw a lot more homeless people around town than she did 10 years ago and that she didn’t feel it was safe to “come here by myself at night,” was that because she was frustrated that ARC has been buying up all the neighboring properties? Or because the company brought more people in addiction to town for treatment or because she distrusted a corporation, with a single man at the helm, exerting outsize influence over her town?

ARC’s packaging of addiction recovery as a community-centered activity could be seen as a progressive initiative, creating an environment where addiction is normalized and people in recovery have support. It could also be seen as a profit-driven strategy, exerting economic power to shape a town and its people to a company’s benefit. “They make you feel like you either do things in their way, believing in God and working for them, or you’re failing,” one former ARC client told me. Another former client told me about a friend of hers who went through recovery at ARC and then relapsed while working for the company. “An addict in recovery or who’s gotten sober, they tend to be the hardest worker,” she said. “And to take advantage of that — I told Tim Robinson to his face that money replaced God for him.” One ARC employee told me, “You can easily let work become your new drug.”

ARC’s expansion enabled more people to gain access to treatment, which brought in more money from insurance claims and more ways to cut costs through scaling: larger treatment centers, more efficient kitchens and food services and more employment opportunities for graduates. Over the past decade, as Kentucky has sought to address the addiction and mental-health crises, funding has flowed loosely. “You would struggle to find anything that’s not reimbursed in behavioral health,” said Stephanie French, the former executive director of communications and public affairs for the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services. At ARC, this money is used to help pay for beds for patients beyond their normal 30-day allotment but also to support its other businesses — and to pay Robinson and his wife a total of more than $500,000 a year. The couple have donated generously to state political campaigns (both for the conservative governor Matt Bevin in 2019 and his progressive successor Andy Beshear in 2023) and built a large, gated house on the edge of town that some people called the Mansion.

This past summer, the F.B.I. issued a call for information from former patients of ARC, asking in a questionnaire whether “any medical procedures, exams or services from ARC” were “not adequately rendered.” When I walked around town soon after that, people were amused to see me. The sentiment seemed to be that the company had it coming. The F.B.I. declined to comment directly on the investigation, but one local conjecture was that it was spurred by Robinson’s frequent campaign contributions. Another was that the company was continuing to bill insurers after patients left treatment or was skimping on care. (In a statement, the company acknowledged that it had potentially overcharged for services and said that it is cooperating with the investigation.) Online, when a resident posted about the investigation on Facebook, someone commented, “Finally some good news.” But over the next few months, blaming significant Medicaid reimbursement cuts, the company laid off about a quarter of its work force, more than 300 employees, including schoolteachers, peer-support specialists and human-resources representatives, and a few residents reached out to me, conflicted.

“My main worry is what might happen if something major goes down, like a shutdown,” one texted. “That’ll be a major blow to the community.” That is, if Robinson was in trouble, ARC was too, and the town could be reclaimed — but, maybe, if ARC collapsed, Louisa would also collapse.

When I first spoke to Louisa’s mayor, Harold Slone, in 2020, he seemed hesitant to say anything of substance about ARC, suggesting that I direct questions to Matt Brown, ARC’s chief administration officer (now president), who was serving on the six-member City Council at the time. I figured this had something to do with the fact that ARC sponsored nearly every event in town and that anything Slone said would get around. But one evening in late 2023, we talked in his backyard. Smoke from a wildfire in West Virginia floated across the river and glazed the sky.

“I find it hard to say a lot bad about ARC, I really do,” Slone said. “We used to see people lined up down the street waiting to get their prescriptions. We knew what was happening and didn’t say anything about it.” I brought up the fact that some people in town saw Robinson as an opportunist, using the addiction crisis for financial gain and personal power. “Do you think the hospital benefits from us being sick?” Slone asked. “The more accidents, wrecks, the more Covid, the more we show up at the E.R., the more profit it makes. ARC’s the same thing. There are some people who talk to me, they say that nobody should be profiting from what they’re doing. Well, we know in America that it just doesn’t happen that way.”

**In November 2023** I visited Kidd and Jackson in their trailer. Outside, the sun was setting, casting the river valley in a slow blue shadow, the trees shuddering a deep orange. Jackson was eating reheated Taco Bell and Kidd was curled on the couch. She seemed transparent, like a glass bead with bright red hair. She told me that she had a tough day at work. Sometimes, she said, when she gets home, she puts her face in her pillow and screams.

Jackson left her quesadilla and walked over to the middle of the living room. She had recently showered and had pulled a cap over her curls, her skin dewy from the water. She reminded Kidd how much she had changed since entering rehab. “I remember when we first met, you couldn’t really read good, and now you read like a champ,” she said. She brought up the ARC-wide convocations that they attended, which feature employees who have remained in recovery long term. “Somebody’s story is always going to be up there,” Jackson said. “Tasha, our story is going to be up there one day.”

Recovery narratives follow an appealing arc, always with the promise of closure. The person remains sober, the town bounces back, the region battles the addiction crisis from the ground up. But reality is more confounding. In late November, a week after I last saw her, Jackson went back to Louisville for Thanksgiving. It was her first time visiting home in more than a year, and she stayed with her daughter, Charlye. “That was literally the best day of my life,” Charlye told me. “It was like a hug I’d been needing.” On Sunday, Jackson went to her mother’s house, where her son had been arrested four years earlier, and relapsed. She overdosed and died in the early morning. Kidd heard the news later that morning and informed me in the afternoon. “My heart is crushed,” she texted. There was a vigil held for Jackson in town and someone from ARC stayed with Kidd through the night.

When I saw Kidd again a few months later, she had started dating a woman, Brittany, who had moved into the trailer and began working at the nursing home with her. Kidd told me that sometimes when she’s stressed, she imagines finding a Xanax or Valium lying around. She would never act on such thoughts, she said, but they have become a kind of dark joke that helps her cope with the urge. The world seemed to move faster than when she was in rehab or in jail, and going back to where she grew up didn’t feel the same anymore. “Ingrid was the exact same way,” she said. “We were destined to be together.”

A year after Jackson’s death, Kidd told me that she still thought about her friend every day. When she was spiraling while thinking of the future, she said, Jackson would take her hand and say, “We’re going to finish this out together, buddy.”

My partner, our little one, and I are moving to the area soon, coming from a busy city lifestyle. We’re really looking forward to slowing down and enjoying the simpler things in life. We’re hoping to keep a low profile, but we’d love to hear your recommendations for places where we can relax, enjoy quality time together, and make the most of our new home.

Here are a few things we love:

* **Coffee shops**: A cozy spot with good vibes and great coffee would be amazing.
* **Bookstores**: We’re suckers for small, unique bookstores or even quirky shops.
* **Romantic dinners**: Somewhere intimate with good food where we can sneak away for a date night.
* **Guilty pleasure**: We can’t say no to a good cheeseburger and fries! Any hidden gems?
* **Drinks**: We’ve heard Lynchburg is a dry town—or something like that? Is it true? We enjoy a decent cocktail or glass of wine every now and then.

We’re coming out of a very busy season in life and hoping to take a few steps back to focus on family and just enjoy being together.

I have been connected with a few individuals through my networks and I have gotten coffee with said connections.

For example, if you’re telling me about someone who would be a good connection, why add “he’s a white man but cares about racial equity”? Huh? 

Note: these people are in the public sector so I can see why equity is on their minds. However, my studies or the positions I’m seeking have NOTHING to do with racial equity. 

Maybe it’s a thing in this state but it really throws me for a loop.

Me (31W) and my fiancé (26M) are in an established polyamorous relationship and have dated other people together and separately in the past and I don’t usually struggle with a lot of jealousy.

Lately however, he’s been getting really close and flirty with a younger woman (23W) who’s currently in a monogamous relationship. Like she’s all over him holding hands, constant texting late into the night, drunk late night phone calls from her with her friend saying she’s been talking about him all night and that the friend needed to meet him. I’ve met her monogamous partner and I just can’t see them being super okay with it? She’s asked her partner about opening up the relationship a few times and they keep saying no. Apparently she has one female friend that she’s allowed to make out with for fun, but it’s bc her partner knows there’s no romantic intention behind it. 

She and my fiancé have gone on several one on one drinks and coffee not-dates that are totally dates. He seems to really like her and the attention, but I’m starting to lose respect for her because to me it’s a red flag that she’s in a monogamous relationship and not communicating openly.

For context, my fiancé and I are kitchen table poly and believe in relationship anarchy. So I’m really not used to telling him what I want him to do and I like to connect with his partners as friends. She’s been very sweet to me and we’ve all hung out, but she also starts being more touchy feely with him as soon as I leave the room. I really don’t want to dislike her or mistrust her. 

Also, on top of this, I just found out that I’m pregnant after my fiancé and I have been trying to conceive for a year. 

So I’m feeling especially vulnerable. I suggested that he talk to her about boundaries about a week ago and said that I’m uncomfortable with the fact that she’s essentially emotionally cheating. He said he would talk to her but he hasn’t yet and is still constantly flirting and texting and I’m getting so anxious and insecure about it and am starting to get fear of abandonment and it’s hurting my trust and respect for him as well. I had no idea what I was doing at her age, and I see a lot of myself in her so I just don’t like how messy it could get.

Right now, I’m re-learning the craft and experimenting with roast profiles. I’m considering starting with a Behmor or Kaldi roaster and would love recommendations on scaling up to a small-batch roaster down the line. I’m taking a phased approach to avoid overcommitting before I’m ready, so any insights on the best upgrade path would be greatly appreciated. If you have some post that cover this topic I’d love a link! I’ve just started to get overloaded with all the different resources available.

Are less people working in general?,"This is based on 2 things: my own observation as a long-term, remote worker in NJ and articles I see about people working less in the US overall.

As a remote worker, I always leave the house during the 9-5 either to grab some coffee, lunch, do chores, or work outside of home.

I’ve only ever seen construction workers or employees of a nearby company out and about for coffee/lunch. Also kids coming out from school around 2-3:30 pm. Other than these scenarios, it’s always less congested in northern NJ around 10-4 pm. Past few months has been a different story.

I’m seeing all age groups out and about ALL the time. Heavier traffic and packed diners/coffee shops during normal working hours.

I don’t see anything online about an increase in population in NJ, but have seen articles about people working less. It can also be more people have the same flexible remote schedule that I do.

Anyone observe the same thing or something similar?

Edit: I’ve been noticing this since September, though the holiday season can definitely be the main factor. Time will tell.

1hfnfp8,https://www.reddit.com/r/goosecreekcandles/comments/1hfnfp8/haul_from_black_friday_reviews/,Haul from Black Friday + reviews! ,"Got my delivery last week. The last time I bought any candles was back during COVID when I went on a candle binge. Not sure how the quality of GC has changed since that time, but the jars and melts I got back then were VERY strong on cold sniff, and the smell could take over the room when lit/melted. Since a lot of my decisions when ordering were based on reviews here (website sucks for reviews), I thought I'd share my thoughts as well to help people going forward, since it can be very overwhelming deciding on what to get! Haven't lit anything yet, so these thoughts are all based on a cold sniff. 

I also added the website description of the actual scents, since there were times when I read reviews that I had to look up the more ""obscure"" names to see what they actually smell like. I tend to gravitate toward fruity, gourmand, and fresh scents vary based on intensity. Hate musk, and avoid floral like the plague because they trigger my migraines. 

Also, I wish GC didn't change the container for their wax melts. They're so much bulkier, and seem like such a waste of plastic :(  



**WAX MELTS**: 

**This is Christmas** (Pine, Evergreen, Eucalyptus, Berry & Cinnamon) - To me, it smells like a christmas tree with a faint hint of cinnamon. Not overwhelming with the cinnamon, but I didn't realize it was in there until I looked the description up. May not appeal to those who dislike cinnamon. It kind of reminds me of the cinnamon brooms you can get at TJs, but with pine. I don't really get eucalyptus and berry, but it's a very pleasant scent that now makes me wish I'd gotten the 3 wick instead of wax melts. Very strong scent, I imagine it will have a good throw. Scent/Throw: 5/5.

**Tree Cutting** (Winter Pine, Snowflakes, Spearmint, Eucalyptus & Cedar) - It smells really minty, with a faint undertone of pine. Weak throw on cold, so it's really hard to tell much else from it. From what I could smell of it, it's not bad? But it definitely doesn't smell like a Christmas tree, which is what I saw on some reviews. Scent: TBD, it's hard to tell. Throw: 1/5. 

**Candy Cane Kiss** (Peppermint, Cool Spearmint, White Chocolate, Cotton Candy & Whipped Vanilla) - it definitely smells like a cooler, slightly lighter peppermint. The harshness of the peppermint was toned down by the sweetness from the vanilla. Scent: 4/5. Throw: 1/5. 

**Apple Cheesecake Cupcake** (Gala Apple, Cake Batter, Cheesecake Custard & Vanilla Buttercream Icing) - On my initial two sniffs, apple is a bottom note - instead, it smelled like a heavy sweetness. Not really cheesecake, cake batter, or buttercream. Not the most pleasant, which made me wonder what the heck all the hype was about. Maybe on the third sniff, I began to notice the apple, and as I keep sniffing it like some bloodhound, I'm definitely noticing more of the green apple. It's not tart by any means. Scent: 3/5. Throw: 4/5. 

**Cookies and Milk** (Chocolate Cookie, Vanilla Cream, Cocoa Powder & Chilled Milk) - Initial sniff is just that distinct chocolate smell. The more you sniff, the more it begins to smell like milk and cookies. Like legit, I can smell the milk and it's thankfully NOT sour lol. Scent: 4/5. Throw 3/5. 

**Coffee House** (Fresh Coffee, Chocolate, Caramel & Vanilla) - I LOVE coffee, but BBW coffee scents grossed me out. It just didn't smell pure, it was too sweet, it was just such a letdown. This smells more like a fresh cup of coffee, even with a slight hint of bitterness that's then lessened with the chocolate smell. Scent: 4/5. Throw: 2/5. 

**Key Lime Cake Pop** (Juicy Lime, Cake Batter, Vanilla Icing & Sparkling Sugar) - IT SMELLS LIKE FRUIT LOOPS!! The better version of the BBW candle that also smelled like Fruit Loops back in COVID times. Like not overdone with the sugar/sickeningly sweet smell whatsoever. The label also says ""highly scented wax melts"" and that was no lie haha. Scent/Throw: 5/5. 

**Frozen Waterfalls** (Frozen Waters, Icy Grapefruit, White Woods & Eucalyptus) - This was a ""risky"" buy for me, because while I Imagine it'd be fresh, it could also smell too masculine, which can sometimes also trigger migraines. It does smell chilly, but it also smells like men's cologne. Leaves that little tingly sensation in my nose. I'm not sure if I'll be able to melt this one without triggering a migraine, but we'll see. Scent: 4/5. Throw: 3/5. 

**Snowman Cookie** (Sweet Sugar Cookie, Vanilla Icing, Marshmallow & Chilled Milk) - Idk man I don't smell anything. I even huffed a bunch of coffee grounds and tried to come back to it. Scent: ??? Throw: 0/5. 

**Blueberry Cheesecake** (Wild Blueberries, Fruit Filling, Pie Crust & Cream Cheese) - This is probably the truest blueberry scented candle/melt I've ever had the pleasure of sniffing. It's the first thing that hits you, nothing artificial. I can't make out the other 3 listed scents, but there's something in there that softens the blueberry a little bit, but in a good way. Scent: 5/5. Throw: 4/5.

**Volcanic Sunrise** (Orange, Grapefruit, Strawberry & Lime) - It smells like citrus. That's all I can make out of this one before the scent fades. Scent: 4/5. Throw: 2/5.



**3 WICK CANDLES**: 

**Carrot Cake Pop** (Carrot Cake, Maple, Ginger, Allspice, Cream Cheese Frosting & Vanilla) - Smells like carrot cake with spice, with a tang from the cream cheese. Based on what I remember, I prefer the 2019/2020 BBW carrot cake candle to this one, but we'll see how I feel once this puppy is lit. Scent: 4/5. Throw: 3/5. 

**Warm Donut Sugar** (Cinnamon Sugar, Warm Fried Dough, Soft Spices & Vanilla Bean) - Omg it's exactly like the name. I was huffing this candle scent and kept coming back to it because it smells so good. Scent/Throw: 10/10, just get this one. 

**White Christmas Cake** (Fluffy Vanilla Cake, Marshmallow Cream, Vanilla Sugar & Cream Filling) - Someone said in a review, I think on the GC website, that this made them cry because it reminded them of someone's kitchen. It smells like cake batter to me. Idk if any of you remember a cake batter lip gloss back from the 2000's, but that's instantly what this reminded me of. I'm here for it. Scent: 5/5. Throw: 4/5. 

**Bergamot and Tea Leaves** (Lemon Water, Brewed Tea Leaves & Bergamot) - This is another impulse buy, trying to expand my horizons. I also like the scent of tea, but hate drinking it. This candle is very lemon forward, with a slight tea-scented undertone. It's kind of hard to describe, but it's a fresher scent that tickles my nose. I think it's going to have a very strong throw when lit, which I'm hoping wont trigger a headache. Scent: 3.5/5. Throw: 4/5. 

**Wild Green Apple** (Wild Green Apple, Sliced Red Apple, Soft Pear, Green Leaves, Gentle Woods) - This is one of the candles I was super pumped to get, because I've read good things about the odor eliminating feature, plus I love apples. Win, right? Eh, not sure. I smell apple, I smell leaves. I smell too many leaves and trees and not enough apple. I don't smell pear. I don't hate it? This one confuses my Swiss cheese brains, but I'm beginning to think it's in a good way. Scent: 4/5. Throw: 5/5. 

**Lavender Snowfall** (Lavender, Fallen Snow, Peppermint & Woods) - I was also excited about this candle because of the reviews I saw here. It's definitely lavender forward, but it also smells woodsy in a way that is sticking in my nostrils... and not in a good way. I have to shove my head into my bag of coffee for a nose refresh. I think this will definitely give me a migraine if I tried to light it. I'll probably return or give it away as a Christmas gift. Scent: 1/5. Throw: 5/5. 

**Staying Home** (Warm Amber, Bergamot, Mandarin & Sandalwood) - This is another impulse buy based on reviews. It smells warm, with a light citrus tone uplifting the scent so it doesn't become overwhelmingly spicy/warm. It's the perfect balance, and it's actually very comfy and makes me want to stay home! Scent: 5/5. Throw: 4/5. 

**Hot Cocoa and Peppermint** (Hot Chocolate, Peppermint, Milky Cream & Vanilla Bean) - So interestingly, I have the BBW from 2019 or 2020 peppermint hot chocolate candle, which smells like cloyingly gross idk what. Not pleasant. This? This is pleasant. The peppermint and the bittersweet chocolate scent is cut down with a slight sweetness that reminds me of a very rich, extravagant hot cocoa. The kind of hot cocoa that would fill you up after a few sips. The first time I sniffed it when I first opened the box last week, I was like ew, bitter chocolate. My mind has been changed. Scent: 4/5. Throw: 5/5. ",5,1734367779.0,goosecreekcandles,8,0.86,False

Soulmates.

He was kind of a weird kid, but I liked that about him. 

His mother, however, was… odd.

I was eleven, playing video games in Jasper’s room, and she started discussing baby names. When we were thirteen, Jasper proposed to me with his mother’s ring. I said, “Gross. I don't like boys.”

He burst into tears, and his mother was mad.

I tried to tell her that maybe when I was older, I would feel differently.

Maybe when I was 18, I would fall for her son.

She hugged me with a fake smile, her ice-cold lips grazing the edge of my ear. 

“Marin Redwood,” her breath tickling the back of my neck sent shivers creeping down my spine, “I will make sure,” she spat, “that nobody will ever fucking love you, you evil little bitch. Only my son.”

She kept that promise.

Because when I did fall in love at the age of fifteen, my first boyfriend, Nate Lockwood, exploded the second I kissed him. 

We were in his car, and I was slowly leaning forward, my heart hammering, my trembling hands unsure where to go—before something warm and wet hit my face. Like an explosion.

I didn't realize I was covered in his brains until I slowly got out of the car, and the couple next to us started screaming. 

I swiped at my eyes, coated, tainted in scarlet chunks.

I thought Nate’s death was a coincidence.

I fell in love with Noah Adams, my summer camp fling. 

I kissed her in the lake, and in the blink of an eye, I was dazedly picking shards of Noah’s skull from my hair, wading in reddish sludge. Her  body was gone, reduced to scarlet dripping down my face. 

Jessie, my college boyfriend, didn't even get to kiss me, and after scrubbing his entrails from my favorite rug, I realized it was proximity. 

The ones I fell in love with were doomed to die. 

So, I became a recluse.

That was, until Finn.

The coffee shop guy. I didn't mean to fall in love with him. I think I fell for his smile, and the way he looked at me—it reminded me of the way I had truly been loved. 

Way back when I was a kid.

I shouldn't have accepted his date. I shouldn't have gotten too close.

I shouldn't have kissed him.

I waited.

Five seconds.

Then ten.

Then a whole minute, and I risked opening one eye.

“Are you okay?” Finn chuckled into the kiss. “You're kissing me with your eyes open.”

He was alive.

I started to laugh, wrapping my arms around him, my breath was suffocated. 

I loved him, and he was alive. 

But when I pulled back, running my hands through his hair, my fingers traced fresh clumsy stitches running across his head.

“See, Marin?” Finn’s smile widened, beads of red pooling from his nose. “I knew you would fall in love with me.”",56,1734367624.0,shortscarystories,3,0.94,False

I moved into my apartment in late July/early August and started to see a few cockroaches in late October. Notified landlord in early-mid November when I realized what they were and that this was a real concern, not just one-off instances of some random bugs. I told the landlord we bought some gel baits off Amazon, then went away for the week of Thanksgiving. First week of Dec, the landlord had the building exterminator come out on 12/3. Since then we’ve been seeing upwards of 7-10+ a day - now a total of 80+ since 11/12. It’s a building wide issue but we don’t know any of the other tenants to really be able to ask them if they’re really having issues in their unit. The landlord is sending another exterminator today (12/16) but at this point I’m ready to move out. We no longer feel safe using our kitchen, I literally just found a baby roach in my coffee this morning. On top of this, there’s a chance I’m pregnant right now (too soon to test to confirm) so I really don’t feel safe being around chemicals the exterminators will be using and this will likely require biweekly exterminator visits over the next few months to possibly resolve the issue, but even then there’s a chance they just move deeper into the walls.

I’d convince myself that everyone was watching me, and my chest would tighten, my palms would sweat. Before stepping up to the counter, I’d obsessively rehearse my order, as if I were preparing for a high-stakes performance. Every little interaction felt like something I had to “get right.”

For years, I thought I was just shy—or maybe socially awkward. But in reality, I was living with social anxiety. The constant fear of being judged turned even the simplest tasks, like making a phone call or meeting someone new, into a source of panic and dread.

I want to share what helped me—both the lessons I’ve learned through therapy and some surprising tools that brought me relief. If you’re struggling with social anxiety, I hope this post reminds you that things *can* get better.

The real turning point for me was during therapy when I learned about **cognitive distortions**—those sneaky, distorted thought patterns that fuel anxiety. For example:

* **Mind Reading**: Assuming others are judging you (e.g., “They think I’m boring”).
* **Catastrophizing**: Believing one small misstep will lead to disaster (e.g., “If I stutter, they’ll never respect me”).

I was living in my head, running scripts that weren’t even real. My therapist taught me to notice these thoughts and gently challenge them. For example:

* Instead of “They think I’m weird,” I’d ask myself, “What’s the evidence for that? What’s the evidence against it?”
* Instead of “I have to be perfect,” I’d reframe it: “It’s okay to be human. People aren’t as focused on me as I think.”

It wasn’t a magic fix, but practicing this daily slowly rewired my mindset.

Here are a few actionable strategies that helped me take back control:

* **Exposure Therapy in Small Steps**Avoidance only makes anxiety worse. I started with manageable challenges—like saying “hi” to a cashier—and worked my way up to initiating conversations with strangers. Every success, no matter how small, built confidence.
* **Body Language Reset**I learned that your body influences your mind. Standing tall, keeping my hands visible, and making eye contact not only projected confidence but *helped me feel it too*.",44,1734366893.0,socialskills,3,0.97,False

Has anyone consulted a medical professional about the impact of nicotine and caffeine on the recovery process? These substances can affect the blood vessels near the affected cranial nerve and the nervous system itself, after all.

I’ve been afraid to drink coffee or smoke since I got sick. However, my job requires me to be surrounded by smokers all the time, so I inevitably smoke passively. Despite this, my recovery has been pretty speedy.

I wonder if I can return to my habits because, while I know they’re unhealthy, dealing with withdrawal symptoms is the last thing I need right now! Thank you in advance.

Reasonably fit, cover ground pretty quickly, unfortunately speak 10 words of Spanish but will try to brush up on that over the next few weeks. Appreciate off the beaten path activities, something unique / local and love food.  


9th Jan (Day 1) - leave Oaxaca. Overnight bus from Puerto Escondido in Oaxaca to San Cristobal de las Casas (SCDLC). 

10th Jan (Day 2) - Arrive by bus around \~8am. Seems like the shuttles to Panajachel in Guatemela leave around 7am in the morning so might have to stay the day / night here in SCDLC. \*\*\*Anyone knows if the shuttles to Panajachel only run on weekdays? I've searched 3 companies and it's all Mon - Fri only

11th Jan (Day 3) - Stay in Lake Atitlan - Arrive late into to Panajachel. Stay the night here. To decide if I want to stay in Panajachel the whole time or move to San Pedro? I don't mind paying for somewhere slightly nicer.

12th Jan (Day 4) - Stay in Lake Atitlan - Explore nearby villages like San Juan La Laguna, San Pedro La Laguna, and Santiago Atitlán.

13th Jan (Day 5) - Stay in Lake Atitlan - day trip to Chichicastengo Market

14th Jan (Day 6) - Transfer and stay in Antigua - hike up to Cerro de la Cruz, maybe do a free walking tour, Mercado de Artesenías, explore rest of town

15th Jan (Day 7) - Stay in Antigua - TBC

16th Jan (Day 8) - Stay in Antigua - do hike of Acatenago. Given it's an overnight hike, do people check out of their acccommodation and just leave their stuff in the lockers / with the hotel? Any recommended operators? Seems like quite a few have good reviews so not sure if there's a big differentiating factor. 

17th Jan (Day 9) - Stay in Antigua - De La Gente local coffee farm tour or chocolate tour 

18th Jan (Day 10) - Stay in Antigua

19th Jan (Day 11) - Saturday Market in the morning before flight out at 6pm from Guatemala airport

  
Questions:

1. Will Day 5 take the whole day?

2. I tend to cover ground fairly quickly... what can I fill up with on Day 7 and 10?

3. Love food so appreciate any must-eats!

That stout is my favorite beer find in Tulsa. It ranked up with Old Rasputin for me because it *wasn't* too sweet and had a good balance between coffee and chocolate undertones. I still remember the first time I walked into Cabin Boys; they were doing the *Bierstacheln* (putting the hot poker in the beer to caramelize the flavors.)That was so much fun! WHY did they stop making The Felix??? I thought it was their signature beer.

So my question is this - What Tulsa brewery has your favorite stout and why? American Solera might be the obvious answer for their variety, but I find so many of their stouts to be incredibly boozy and/or sweet. Recommendations on what to look for there are welcome. The Prairie Artisan style is great - for dessert but not my go-to for a Friday night. Same for Nothing's Left - ""Deez Nuts"" is too sweet for me. 

Bonus: If stout is not your thing, what LOCLA Brewery has your favorite style, IPA, Lager, or Sour? etc.? We can spread this out to OKC  as well. ",8,1734366651.0,tulsa,18,1.0,False

1hfmy0e,https://www.reddit.com/r/friendship/comments/1hfmy0e/im_starting_to_hate_my_only_best_friend/,I’m starting to hate my only best friend.,"I’m sorry if this is kinda long to read. 

Honestly, I don’t even know where to start, but here I go.

My best friend and I have been close for almost five years. We didn’t meet under the best circumstances—she was part of a toxic group in high school, and my circle essentially “adopted” her. At first, she and I didn’t get along because our personalities were so different, but over time, we grew close. She’s really pretty, sweet, kind, and caring—or at least, that’s how I felt at first. She became well-acquainted with a lot of people on campus. Most guys liked her, and a lot of girls didn’t, which I initially chalked up to jealousy.

I have to admit, I was jealous of her too. Being around her often made me feel invisible. Whenever people spread rumors about her, she would come to me for comfort, and I’d always try my best to be there for her. But over the years, I noticed a pattern: she’d make new girlfriends, but those relationships would always end badly—with the other girls becoming “haters” or backstabbers. At first, I thought it was because of her beauty they’re jealous of, but now I think there’s more to it.

For a long time, I ignored some red flags. She constantly talks about herself—her problems, how guys obsess over her, and how much attention she gets. I don’t mean to brag, but there have been many times when we’d go out, and I’d always end up paying for her food or coffee because she didn’t have money. I tried to be understanding; I knew she had a low allowance. But then, there were moments that felt off—like when she’d take my designer bag, put it on the table, and post pictures on social media as if it were hers.

It’s been like that for years. I’d treat her, she’d post things that make her look more “expensive,” and later she’d tell me how people think she’s unattainable because of her “lifestyle.” Meanwhile, I’d just sit there, feeling like a side character in her narrative.

Recently, it’s started to feel unbearable. Every time we meet, it’s all about her—her problems, her drama, her life. I’d get a small window to talk about myself before the conversation shifts back to her. It’s exhausting. Sometimes I would distance myself and not talk to her often but she would always message if there’s a problem. 

The breaking point came this month. I told her about this guy I like—just a casual mention. She has a boyfriend, so I didn’t think much of it. But then she insisted we go to the café where the guy I like works so she could meet him. Once she did, she commented on how good-looking he is and told me he said “hi” to her. I didn’t know how to react. I felt disappointed and a little heartbroken, but I brushed it off because, well, she is prettier than me.

But that moment made me reflect on our friendship. I started wondering if the problem is me—if I’m just insecure and jealous. But no matter how much I try to be understanding, I’m so tired of feeling drained every time I talk to her. I don’t want to be selfish. I don’t want to hurt her. I hate my best friend. I don't really hate her personally, i just hate being friends with her. She’s always the one that everyone chooses over me. She always looks prettier than I do, she always has on a nicer outfit than me, she's always the one who boys obsess over. She always the first choice, and i'm not even in the picture.

I don’t know if I should confront her just because I feel bitter about myself. I feel like saying something would ruin our friendship forever, and maybe I’m not ready for that. So, should I just pull a slow fade and distance myself? Or should I just cut her off instantly. What should I do?

I'm a 25yo white male. To be frank, I look and dress like a finance bro. Typically in Lululemon clothes or like a plain white tee. I dress well but no logos or anything like that.

Virtually anywhere I go, people just straight up ignore me. I walk into Nordstrom, at the counter looking at colognes or whatever, workers will go around me and ask people ""Hey how are you?"" ""Can I help you with anything?""

I was in Louis Vuitton the other day looking for a wallet for my Mom. I walk in with Lululemon pants on, a tailored white tee shirt, a Rolex on, and carrying a coffee. The guy kind of was like ""Ummm.. Can I... help you?"" - kind of like ""What the fuck are you doing here bro?""

This past summer I was at Loro Piana in New York City. I was literally wearing a pair of Loro Piana shoes when I was there and the employee there called me Buddy and kind of rushed me out of the place

I don't really understand why this is? I don't look ""poor"", I dress nice, I look well put together, I'm in shape, look confident, etc. And people just treat me like I don't exist.

I met this woman off of a dating app a bit over a month ago, and things moved very fast. Our first date ended with her spending the night, and the second date was an entire Saturday spent hanging out. The third week of seeing each other, she came over to hookup (she initiated), spent the night, and then the next day we went Christmas shopping together. 

The fourth week, we went out to dinner for my birthday, she paid (voluntarily), and we had sex afterwards. However, I, riding on a high, asked her to be my girlfriend, and she said “it’s not that I don’t want you to be my boyfriend, but we’ve known each other for less than a month. We still don’t know a lot about each other. If things are still going well in a few weeks, we can talk about it again”. I definitely felt a bit rejected but said ok, that makes sense. A few days later, she came over again and we had pizza and watched a movie. She said that moving forward, if I wanted to be her boyfriend, she said we need to have more romantic dates and that she wanted nights that didn’t end in sex. I agreed and said that we can start doing that, and that we had gotten a little too comfortable with just hanging out. We kissed goodnight and said goodbye for a few weeks, since I was going back home for the holidays the next day.

However, the past week has been a little weird - on Wednesday she said she wanted to go to a boba place and a coffee festival when I got back, but on Friday she drove 300 miles to another city without telling me about it prior, despite the fact that we had hung out just a few days before that. When I casually asked what she was up to, after six hours she just said “went on a little trip to visit a friend”. She gave very little detail on what she did, didn’t send any pictures, and didn’t provide any info on whom she was visiting. On a sneaking suspicion, I checked her dating profile, and saw that she had updated it. Since then, she’s sent me a couple memes on instagram but that’s pretty much it. She sent me a post about an event but left me on read when I said we should go to that. Her responses are short and dry. 

I just don’t get it. We definitely are way past just being FWBs, and while she didn’t want to be official yet, we’ve definitely done a lot of relationship level things and she knows full well that I want a relationship. But the past few days have really left me questioning that - why not tell me about this trip? Why be so vague about who you’re visiting? And when and why did you update your dating profile? 

I don’t know how to start this conversation, and on the chance that she is seeing other men, I don’t know how I could handle that. And unfortunately, it won’t be for another couple weeks since I’m out of town. Thoughts on the situation and what I should do would be greatly appreciated.",1,1734366364.0,dating_advice,4,1.0,False

1hfmw7l,https://www.reddit.com/r/VentUnfiltered/comments/1hfmw7l/so_this_is_it/,So this is it,"Over the past few months my(F27) boyfriend(M25) has been getting a little distant. I assumed it was because his work schedule changed and he was still getting used to it. Then I noticed that he’d always be on his phone and when I’d ask him/tell him (in a joking way) to get off, he’d just give me a weird look and continue back on the phone or say no. It was suspicious to me because he was never really the type of person to be on his phone for a long period of time. That feeling in my gut only grew and grew until one night, while he was asleep, I went on his phone and starting snooping. I knew it was wrong but I needed to know for sure. In this moment, looking back and knowing what I know now, I should’ve listened to my gut sooner. My boyfriend was messaging so many different girls on multiple different apps. Sending videos, pictures, messages and planning meet ups. It’s been going on for months and some of the women have messages going back years.

Seeing everything on his phone hurt me so much I literally couldn’t stop reading messages and crying. I never thought my boyfriend would cheat on me but never say never. A whole week of snooping on his phone and he was messaging girls every. single. day. I’m not gonna lie, I got a little distant and started rethinking our relationship too. I know I should’ve dumped him at this point and been gone but he was my first everything and I truly did love him. My mind was going back and forth on what to do when, ultimately, I decided I needed to try and put more effort in. Big mistake and a shameful one at that. I thought to myself, maybe if I put in more effort into our relationship then he’ll stop talking them and we’ll be good, or he’ll still be talking to them and it’s truly fuck him. So, here I am, cleaning more, making him morning coffees, cooking, laundry and more sex. Hell, I even got into games so we could play together. Things got a little better but, sadly, he was still cheating. And it was still bothering me. Why? Because now I needed to know why.

After the first time snooping on my boyfriend’ phone, I asked if he had cheated or still messages girls on apps and he denied it saying he loves me. Of course I didn’t believe him but a tiny part of me wanted to. I could never look at him the same after confirming my suspicions. Every time my boyfriend would say something sincere about me or compliment me, there would be a voice in head that would follow it with, “But he cheated and he’s still cheating on you.” By the end of the week, those voices turned against me and I could feel myself slipping into my insecurity and depression. I felt insecure, emotional, ugly, unloved and unimportant. Especially, since my boyfriend’s way of comforting is asking if someone’s okay and then just moving on. As I’m recalling and typing this, I definitely should’ve left. Stupid girl🤦‍♀️ No, instead, I stayed and pretended like everything was okay and trying to convince myself that things would get better. 

I hadn’t checked my boyfriend’s phone in a few days now but today I had that gut feeling again. No secrets here, still cheating. I started to ask more questions like the previous ones and… (***SPOILER ALERT***) he started to gaslight and manipulate me. Telling me he “already told me, blah blah blah, I love you’ and only you bs.”🙄 When I brought up the apps, deny. Convos with girls, deny. When I asked him cheating was to him, he said talking/meeting up with someone else; basically everything he’s doing. I asked, again, if he cheated by messaging or meeting up with anyone, he denied. Until I brought up the pictures and videos I took of the evidence from his phone. He broke down. Started confessing AND lying at the same damn time. I had to go through the videos and messages that I took to confront him and get him to admit the truth. He says he just messaged girls and sent pics/vids, set up meet ups but he would never meet up with anyone because he couldn’t bring himself to go through with it because of me. I told him I didn’t believe him and that I honestly think he slept with someone else. I asked why didn’t he just come to me, considering we met on a nsfw subreddit, and I used to post about wanting to do and try a whole bunch of different things. He said he felt us getting distant and just decided to talk to them. I asked why didn’t he bring it up how distant we were getting and he said it was because he didn’t want me to get mad. Mad about what? He says, “I don’t know” 

As much as I wanna leave, I can’t. I live with my boyfriend and have no friends or family around me, and no one to really count on. After typing and rereading this, I feel like an idiot for putting up with this shit and putting myself into this situation. I am figuring out a solution to this situation and trying to save up so I can leave but this is it. Never thought I’d have a relationship like this, especially my first, figured it’d be like the cute ones in the movies and shows. That’s life, I guess.",2,1734366351.0,VentUnfiltered,1,1.0,False

I wanted to share my recent experience taking a Grand Canyon South Rim bus tour from Las Vegas. It was honestly one of the best day trips I've ever done, and I thought it might help others who are planning their Grand Canyon adventure.

I researched a ton of options before booking, but what sold me on this particular tour was the value for money. For about $80, you get round-trip transportation from Vegas, a professional guide, and access to some of the most breathtaking viewpoints along the South Rim.

The day started early (like, really early) with a hotel pickup, but our guide Mike made the journey fun with interesting facts about the desert landscape and local history. The bus was super comfortable with AC and a bathroom, which is crucial for a 14-hour trip.

Our first major stop was at the National Geographic Visitor Center, where you can grab some snacks and learn about the canyon's formation. Pro tip: if you're interested, you can upgrade your experience here to include an IMAX movie about the canyon's history – totally worth it if you're into that kind of thing.

But the real magic happened when we reached the actual South Rim. Guys, pictures don't do it justice. We visited multiple viewpoints, including Mather Point and Bright Angel Point, and each one offered a different perspective of this massive natural wonder. The colors change throughout the day as the sun moves, creating these incredible shadow patterns across the canyon.

For the adventure seekers, there are some cool upgrade options available. You can add a Hummer tour along the rim (about 2 hours) or even a 25-minute helicopter flight over the canyon. I didn't do these personally, but several people in my group did the helicopter tour and said it was mind-blowing.

The tour includes a meal voucher, which was convenient, though I'd recommend bringing some extra snacks. We also had a break stop in Kingman, Arizona, which was perfect for stretching our legs and grabbing coffee.

If you're planning to book this tour (which I highly recommend), I found the best deals through this link: https://athometouch.com/SouthRim. They often have special offers, and the booking process was super smooth.

Just a heads up – while the tour is long, it's totally worth it. The South Rim offers the most iconic views of the Grand Canyon, and having a knowledgeable guide really enhances the experience. Plus, not having to worry about driving or navigating means you can fully focus on enjoying the views.

One last piece of advice: bring a good camera, wear comfortable shoes, and dress in layers. The rim can be quite a bit cooler than Vegas, and you'll want to be comfortable while exploring these incredible viewpoints.

Has anyone else done this tour? Would love to hear about your experiences in the comments!",1,1734366327.0,AskTheTraveler,0,1.0,False

Is this enough proof of cheating?","I have been for 8 years with my husband. I started to have suspicions about him and a female coworker he has, because of some changes in his behaviour, I confronted him and of course he denied. I don’t have solid proof, but very vague things he does. 

He comes home after work (he tried to stay after but I talked with him and he stopped), he is at home on weekends, once a few months he has dinner with his coworkers “for obligations”, when he goes out he stays no more than 2-3 hours. So I stayed in the relationship.

Because you don’t know what is better, to leave when you see little things or when you have solid proof. Sometimes things might look like your partner is cheating when it is not. It is very confusing. I am not the jealous type so I am not all the time on guard, following him, or checking hid phone, I trusted him and it seems like he is not the good man I thought he is.

Right after his work we made this habit to go out for a coffee. Like every day, he sends me a message to come out, I enter the car and the passenger car sit is pulled back and completely leaned back. I must mention the last person that got into his car the day before it was me, so the night before the car sit was in a 90 degree position. 

I ask him why is the car sit like that, and he is like ohh I took the other day a male coworker at home. And I say but if he was the other day in the car why last night the car sit was in a different position than today, why the sit is not like this since the day you took him?

And I ask him again, today nobody was in your car?? And he is like, nobody was today in the car, are you acussing me of something? And I say, no.. but the car seat say another story. And he is like, you must trust me a little bit more and then I told him I did.. now I don´t.. He got mad AF.

It happened only once since that woman is working with him (she started 5 years ago), which made me think that day they probably were too horny and they forgot.

TLDR: Is that enough proof? What other reason, could it be? It is obvious someone else got into the cat that day and why he would lie, in the hypothetical case he is not cheating?",7,1734366087.0,relationships_advice,32,0.89,False
