I got lucky and secured an awesome job about a year out of high school. I’ve put my head down and worked for nearly 5 years, going on small trips when I can. I bought a challenger to reward myself about a year back. Some may see this as silly, but for me, it was about fulfilling a dream I had as a young kid. I did it and therefore, I am proud. Most of my other “spending” money has gone to these little overnights when I can fit them in (on my 2 days off, if I get them). I enjoy seeing new places that are nearby. I only work 40 hours a week but I have been in a high position at my company for years. I’ve been at a cross roads, though, due to corruption in my company stunting my career growth. I am more than qualified, but my age plays a factor working against my promotion. Despite the obvious discrimination with ageism, I feel like it is my time to move on as I am no longer growing here.
I am scared to invest in another dream (like owning my own coffee or crystal shop) due to the loss of the safety net. I’ve worked so hard to get to where I am and am a realist. If I attempted a new venture and failed, then I’d be back to square one and then behind opposed to ahead. I’d most likely have to start from scratch at another company that I prob wouldn’t be fond of. I also know that small businesses have been struggling for a good 5-10 years now, just due to the reality of the economy. 
All this being said, I am looking for some advice. I want to be happy and fulfilled. I know I am worth more than my current 9-5 position. And sometimes when these feelings are heavy, I just want to throw it all away and go back to being a bum. 
Thanks in advance for any help. Sorry if it’s not positive, but this is my current reality. ",0,1741802745.0,passive_income,1,0.5,False

When I tell people my BMI is almost obese they scoff because my muscle mass is high. I am just over being overweight. I’ve yo-yo dieted my whole adult life- from 16- now at 32. My smallest was 130 and that was one I was doing OMAD and probably had the worst relationship with food and my body, working out for 2 hours a day at the gym and tracking every single calorie. I hated myself and would obsess over my next meal throughout the day. 

I want to lose weight but struggle with counting calories. I want to continue to meal prep with my partner but struggle with how we make something like a curry and split it amongst ourselves in a calorically balanced way. 
How do y’all do that in a way that doesn’t take so much freaking time? We would weigh each ingredient and then make a total for the vat then weigh out each portion. It’s such a process looking everything up and inputting all the values. I eventually gave up because it was so hard. I’ve gained like 10lbs this year and now I’m just scared.

Is it best to just eat super boring so less ingredients means less effort? 

We generally eat healthy, lots of veggies, unsaturated fats, but wonder if the carbs, protein, and my stupid sweet tooth are destroying me. I’ve switched my sweets to dried unsweetened mangos and it satisfies the gummy cravings but I know it’s where I can work on. No soda. I do sweetened coffee but skip breakfast most days. I take synthroid for my hashimotos (hypo) and I am not sure if that’s a factor but it may explain why I’m always hungry. When I work my 12 hours shifts I have a green drink in the morning, coffee, oatmeal with chia seeds protein powder and raspberries with a side carrots or cucumber and a maybe a portion of fruit and yogurt for a snack later, then dinner with my partner. 

I love working out. I love weight lifting, running, and yoga. My issue isn’t so much exercise as it is the food. I’ve basically gotten away with working out to counter balance my over eating but I think my metabolism is fighting back now. 

Is there anyway to make this tracking calories process easier, especially with a partner? 

Any advice on how to start this process when living and eating with a partner would be greatly appreciated! I am starting med school soon and want healthy habits simplified before it starts.

When I was prepping for the NCLEX, I thought I had it all figured out. I’d spent months with my nose in review books, flashcards stacked higher than my coffee cups Lol 😆, and every practice question I could get my hands on. I even turned to Naxlex, a popular resource that promised to mirror the real exam and get me ready for the task a head. And don’t get me wrong it helped. A lot. But when I sat down for the actual NCLEX, the hardest questions I faced weren’t anything like the clean, straightforward drills I’ve been grinding through. They were vague. Frustratingly, mind-bogglingly vague.
Let me paint the picture. You’re halfway through the exam, adrenaline pumping, and you get a question that feels like it’s written in code. Something like: “A patient presents with a condition. What’s the best nursing action?” No specifics. No labs, no vitals, no clear symptoms just a blank slate and four options that all sound kinda right. My brain went into overdrive. Was this a trick? Was I missing something? I’d aced Naxlex practice sets scenarios with Tough priorities, logical progressions but this? This wasn't different to real beast.
The vagueness wasn’t just a one-off either. It kept coming. Priority questions where every answer seemed plausible, or select-all-that-apply nightmares where I second-guessed every checkbox. Naxlex had taught me patterns: “Airway, breathing, circulation—bam, done.” But the NCLEX threw curveballs that felt more like philosophical debates than nursing problems. I started wondering if I’d studied the wrong career entirely.
Looking back, I get it. The NCLEX isn’t just testing your textbook knowledge it’s testing your ability to think on your feet when the situation’s murky. Real-life nursing isn’t always a neat checklist; patients don’t come with a script. But man, I wish Naxlex had leaned into that ambiguity a little more. Their questions were solid don’t get me wrong but they were too polished, too predictable. I nailed the straightforward stuff on the exam, but the vague ones? Those were the ones that had me sweating bullets.
If I could go back, I’d tell myself to practice wrestling with the unknown. Maybe mix up my prep with some intentionally blurry scenarios—force myself to reason through the fog. Naxlex got me 80% of the way there, but that last 20%? That was pure instinct, and the NCLEX knew how to test it. To anyone prepping now: don’t just master the material. Master the mess. Because when the screen flashes that vague, head-scratching question, you’ll thank yourself for it.

I don’t like buying products labeled as ""beginner-level,"" and while the Profitec Go sits somewhere in between, I’m unsure if it’s the right choice.

My biggest concern about choosing the Go over the Pro 400 is the lack of preinfusion. I worry that in the future, I’ll regret not investing more in a machine that includes this feature and feel guilty about not making a better choice upfront.

I'm into collecting vinyls and retro gaming as well! I'm also more on the introverted side, so I'm not a loud party animal or anything like that.

That’s when I started wondering if I had just gotten used to mediocre water quality.

I did a little research, and apparently, even if your city’s water is “safe,” it can still have a ton of stuff in it—chlorine, heavy metals, even microplastics (which freaked me out a bit). I looked into filters, but I didn’t want one of those huge bulky systems, and pitcher filters just seemed annoying.

Eventually, I came across [Waterdrop Filter](https://www.waterdropfilter.com/) while reading about under-sink systems. Never heard of them before, but the reviews were solid, and it seemed like a good balance between cost and effectiveness. I installed one a few weeks ago, and I can *actually* taste the difference.

Went to my work to make sure the paperwork was done, I didn't see anyone I knew except for Kaylee, and I DIDNT see S. Got there \~11am, Which is good, because she believes the bullshit they told her, so she's scared. I dont wanna make her scared just be being in the same building as her, so I was in and out as quick as I could be. Same reason why on Sunday I just up and BAILED outta Hoden. Even called the officer I spoke with to let them know. ""Hey, I was here, but I didnt want any drama, so I just bailed. I dont know if she saw me.""

It really hurts that she's afraid of me, but all I can do is hope that, with time, and with distance, and me not approaching her, that she gets less afraid, and she'll approach me, so I can show her the truth. I can show her the EVIDENCE that she has been lied to. I might go so far as to type it out on here (sans photos. I'm not putting something with my medical information on the internet.) It's a little blurry (either because hangover, or time, or the whole near death experience thing) but I'll get the broad strokes right.

But it is irritating to get all these 3am Private Number phone calls. I hope it's a coincidence.  
Also, the car alarm keeps going off anytime I'm parked anywhere in <town>. For instance, I went to the coffee shop, left my car there, and went over my insurance place that's like caddy corner across the street.

I come out and the car alarm is going off. No damage to the car, no broken windows, just going off randomly. This alarm doesn't go off randomly. I just don't know what to do. If it IS her and her friends, like, I'm respecting her wishes! I'm not bothering her, I'm not calling her, I'm not showing up at her house, I dont talk to her while shes at work, NOTHING. If it IS them, why they gotta keep bothering me?

This turned into a ramble. On with the journal entry.

Walked across the parking lot to Charlie's Chicken to get myself some lunch, brought it back to my place.

But I am a complete retard because **I LEFT MY WALLET IN THE CAR** so I had to walk BACK over to Lawn and Garden then walk BACK OVER to Charlie's Chicken. It hurts being this stupid. It hurts having a hangover. It really hurts being this stupid WITH a hangover. Called the dealership to make sure I could get the oil change tomorrow morning, and I can. It worked out great.

So, Oil Change tomorrow. Then building furniture. I know my schedule for my first day back on Saturday. Which is nice, I suppose. Wish I knew the full schedule for the week, but we take what we can get at this point.

Now I've agreed to let her have all the coffee she wants, but that means she's probably gonna fall more behind on sleep. It just feels like such a ridiculous situation. It's just coffee, but it's ruining everything. Before she started drinking it again, she was actually sleeping well and doing good quitting drinking. Now I'm not so sure, because it winds her up so much. She wants me sleeping downstairs now, and I hate the cold-ass basement. I worry this is the straw that broke the camels back, and she's not gonna want to be with me anymore if she realizes it's better without me around.

1j9pdla,https://i.redd.it/lvo0ks2tlaoe1.jpeg,Bear Markets and Dark Times are when $Kendu thrives most,"In a bear market, most investors sit on the sidelines, waiting for the cycle to turn. But the smart ones know that real gains are made when others hesitate. Bitcoin maxis and large-cap meme coins are trapped in predictable patterns, rising and falling with the broader market. $Kendu is different. With a market cap under $10 million and fewer than 18,000 holders, it has the room to move in ways bigger tokens cannot. The proof is already there. During one of the harshest periods in crypto, $Kendu hit an all-time high of $280 million. That was not luck. That was strength. A return to that level from here is a 28x move, and when the market shifts, projects like this move first.

But $Kendu is not just about charts. It is already reshaping the real world. Kendu Energy is building sustainable solutions. Kendu Coffee is bringing the brand into the spaces where people connect. Kendu Art is taking over cultural hubs. Live events in India and Miami are cementing the movement in the physical world. This is not just another token. It is an ecosystem, growing stronger with each move.

Since the CTO took the reins, the community has only gained momentum. These are not passive holders. They are believers, builders, and drivers of what comes next. The path forward is clear. The opportunity is here. The ones who understand will not wait.

We are still working with other specialists to diagnose. I also have a history of sinus issues. I have a deviated septum. I have been diagnosed with sinusitis. I also have moderate costcocontritis.

I took antibiotics for pneumonia three years ago. Two weeks later I started having crazy symptoms. Going into anaphylaxis just from waking up in the morning. And then from Buspirone shortly after. I was taking Buspirone for three years prior with no issues. A bunch of crazy symptoms started happening and I wasn't able to lay on my right side without my heart going from 70-125 within a minute. Almost shit myself. I also developed severe photophobia after being prescribed cetirizine because my PC noted that I had bad post nasal drip. My pupils shrank the day after I took it and my sensitivity to light and eyes never went back to normal. On top of that, I Had this horrible sensation I was going to die. Hospital did nothing. I went to the ER everyday for a month. Have been experiencing severe brain fog and memory loss. The ER Dr was of no help and rudely threatened to give me a spinal tap as a way to scare me. They were lashing out at me and being extremely rude. 

It wasn't until 16 months later when I got my impacted wisdom teeth removed that I felt the closest the normal that I had felt since these medical episodes. 16 months of agony, suffering, weakness, hand tremors, feeling like I was floating above my body instead of in it and my eyes flaring up. They looked a lot more surprised and wide when the wisdom teeth were back in. I even developed a severe reaction to coffee. I couldn't have regular caffeinated coffee...not even a sip...for 16 months straight. As soon as I got those teeth out within two weeks I was able to have it without feeling like I was going to die, without having a severe medical episode. High liver enzymes went back to normal. I also switched to Hydroxizine. 10 mg twice a day. My eyes also flare up and look really shocked or surprised sometimes. I recently upped the dose of my hydroxizine to 25 mg twice a day. It reduces my eyes looking shocked. Not sure what's going on. But I've been feeling weak, like I'm dying and not ok for three years now with no clear answers. 


TLDR: My eyes have hollowed out since three years ago and it keeps getting worse. I feel like I'm dying everyday. What is happening? Doctors keep taking this lightly and treating it with an air of nonchalance. Meanwhile I feel like I'm dying. What is happening? I'm so tired.

And man, traveling is so much harder. Anything more than 2 time zones has me out of wack for at least a day. International travel basically demolishes my sleep pattern - I’ll spend the first night up till like 4 AM local, then crash out the entire next day, before I can get on a pattern again

My TBM BIL is currently studying energy healing and even getting a masters in wholistic medicine. 

Saw this book on the coffee table last night. 

My TBM wife eats this up and whenever my kids are sick she asks him to “treat them” which he does remotely by kinda talking to himself and pushing on his own hands. 

I definitely am skeptical but haven’t really minded it cause it doesn’t really do any harm…I guess?

Recently he “treated” our daughter cause she was a bit sick and said he “found” some other emotions she (my daughter) had. He said she was feeling sad and when he asked “why” “he got back…she is missing her heavenly home”

This kinda pissed me off cause now I know he’s just going off his own beliefs / biases. 

I guess I’m worried that my wife will start to lean into this more and more and while I’m trying to be open to things I don’t understand. The moment someone tells me a supposed “truth” I get a little frustrated.

San Diego has so much to do that it often gets hard to choose what to do. What's your favorite San Diego simple pleasure?

For me, my favorite would have to be crossing the Coronado Bridge, walking to the ferry dock and watch the city skyline at night. Just sitting on the docks admiring our beautiful city.

There's also all the farmers markets across the city Little Italy, Santee, and Ocean Beach! If you can please support our local vendors, farmers, and makers (just make sure they pay taxes in SD).

It feels like it's getting harder and harder to find spaces where you can just be. A quiet space that you don't have to pay to be in, which is why I appreciate just how much nature there is in San Diego.

We have beautiful walkable neighborhoods all with hidden gems to explore, the walkway on 30th street heading into South Park, any of our beaches, trails, libraries,  and the various parklets that are starting to pop up all over the city.

1j9p7jw,https://www.reddit.com/r/PortlandOR/comments/1j9p7jw/the_beginning_of_a_nightmare/,The Beginning of a Nightmare,"Two years ago, a mid-50s burnout with multiple arrests moved into my apartment complex—his unit is directly across from mine. I’m a woman in my early 30s.



Before moving in, he told a neighbor he had just been released from jail. Our landlord—who apparently doesn’t do background checks—HIRED HIM AS OUR MAINTENANCE MAN. (I’m sorry, WHAT?) 

Let me add that my building is mostly women. This man now had full access to our apartments. I didn't learn any of this until recently. I have no idea if he has been inside my apartment or not.

He’s exactly the kind of guy you’d cross the street to avoid—a bleary-eyed, slow-talking creep who always smells like weed and cheap beer. He speaks in this low, sluggish voice like he’s half-asleep or permanently stoned. And when he does talk, it’s usually off-putting and weird.



His cars—two beat-up vans with smashed windows and bent antennas—were already an eyesore. And recently, he attached a rusted old trailer to the back of one. The red flags were everywhere. We live in a night neighborhood so he really stood out. Working on his vehicles for months outside of our beautiful 1910 mansion that was converted into apartments. He leaves trash and junk all over the property, on the side walks and the best part of all outside of his door. I get to shove his junk out of the way most days so I can get into my apartment. 

There has been a broken wooden chair that seems to keep getting more beaten and beaten up each week as it moves from the front porch, to downstairs to in-front of his door in this creepy cycle.



And then the nightmare started.



The Beginning of the Chaos



The first time I met him, I knocked on his door to introduce myself and politely ask him to turn down his music. His subwoofer was literally shaking my walls and had woken my boyfriend and me up early in the morning—not a fun way to start the day. He seemed odd, but we talked about our love for music, and I figured that was that. He even said ""Yeah, the subwoofer is too big for this tiny space."" YEAH NO SHIT.



Nope.



Over the next few months, I had to message him multiple times about the noise. I also reached out to my landlord several times over the past two years—and got ignored every single time.

I'm talking you could hear his music from DOWN THE STREET. He got lucky enough o get the apartment with the double glass French doors that lead onto the only balcony connected to the front of the mansion. So, imagine hearing death metal from a block or two away just to find out its actually coming from your apt building! And if that's not bad enough there is junk piled and hanging off all his balcony. This building is beautiful so a little bit off putting to see it covered in trash when you get home everyday from work.

....

The only time my landlord responds to me is if I need a spare key or something small. But when it comes to safety? Silence.



Harassment & Escalation



Then things got worse.

• He started lurking. Every time I walked into the building, he’d step out of his apartment—arms open, like he wanted a hug.

• He texted me inappropriate things, like asking if I had single friends because he “needed a release.”

• He texted me “Love you.” just randomly.

• He harassed my female neighbor down the hall so badly that he smeared literal poop on her door handle. (She has photos.)

• He spit on her Ring camera multiple times and even took a paint brush with black paint to it.

• He threw coffee all over her apartment walls.

• He went on paranoid rants in our group chat, accusing people of stealing his tools.



I finally snapped and told him, “No one is stealing your shit, just move out already.” His response? A direct threat: “Come say it to my face.”



At one point, he cornered a neighbor in the basement several times, terrifying her. Why? Because she rejected his flirting.

He also admitted to her that he had a camera in the basement and that he caught her stealing. (She borrowed a hammer that was in the basement) not knowing it was his. This has always been more of a communal place. If there is a hammer sitting downstairs in the basement it would be no problem to borrow it and return it.

After my female neighbor came to me scared and told me what he had done, I was furious and I knocked on his door to confront him. He never came to the door. He never responded to any of it nor did my landlord! I let my landlord know SEVERAL times how unsafe I felt. I said once.  ""I don't feel safe in my home."" 

weeks later, guess what this creepy neighbor text me... ""I don't feel safe in my home."" WTF right! Like he was mocking what I had said to my landlord! How creepy is that. I have no support through this from our landlord it's insane.

side note: (but not to mention the rat infestation I had for months, no one did anything about.)



The Gasoline Incident & Police Incompetence



Three months ago, a neighbor caught him pouring gasoline around our building. She freaked out and started calling the cops. In response, he poured pee off his balcony onto her head.



I found out about this when I heard screaming and banging outside my door late at night. My boyfriend and I were watching a movie. Before I even opened the door, I looked out my window—



And there he was, on an emergency escape ladder, lurking around my window.



I opened the door, and my neighbor was standing there—soaking wet, hysterical, and crying. She kept saying, “He’s threatening to burn the place down! He poured pee on me!”



Meanwhile, he was climbing up and down a heavy-duty ladder right outside my window. It felt like a horror movie.



I panicked. I grabbed my most important things—journals, photos, my ukulele, my favorite stuffed animal—and left the premises.



I called 911 and explained everything. Their response? “We don’t know when officers will be available.”



HE WAS THREATENING TO BURN THE BUILDING DOWN, AND THEY DIDN’T KNOW WHEN THEY’D SHOW UP.



I waited an hour in my car sobbing... and Nothing. My boyfriend (who had left because he didn’t want to “hang around” for the craziness) eventually came back, and we left to sleep somewhere else.



Later, I heard the cops finally showed up—only to blame my female neighbors for banging on his door. They “talked to him,” and that was it.



It Gets Even Weirder

• After the police left, we caught video footage of him talking to the stolen mirror (he stole from my neighbor) he screwed onto the wall between our doors. In the video, he’s staring into the mirror, pointing, and saying my neighbor’s name over and over again—like he’s casting a curse or something. Calling her pathetic etc.

• He installed a security camera between my door and his, pointing directly at the staircase and our neighbors’ doors (two females, one in her 40s and one in her 20s). 

Now, every time we leave or come home, he can see exactly when we do. It’s beyond unsettling.



Landlord Negligence & Legal System Failure



I contacted my landlord—again—about all of this. Called. Messaged. No response.



I told him I felt unsafe in my home. Nothing.



Finally, he started the eviction process, and we thought relief was in sight. But guess what?



THIS LUNATIC WON IN COURT.

• He somehow got legal aid.

• He got four months of rental assistance to stay.

• The case isn’t even going to trial anymore.



So, let me get this straight:

• He has harassed multiple women in this building.

• He smeared poop on someone’s door.

• He poured gasoline around the building.

• He poured pee on someone’s head.

• He threatened to burn the place down.

• He installed a camera to monitor us.

• He talks to a stolen mirror, muttering people’s names.



And he gets to stay—for free.



Meanwhile, I still have to pay full rent to live in fear. My landlord refuses to help.



It Gets Even Worse



Unsettling things that have happened since this guy moved in:

• My car was stolen.

• Tons of my belongings were stolen from the basement—which was always safe before.

• My back window was smashed in.

• The entire vibe of this building went from peaceful to absolute chaos.



I’ve lived here for over four years with nothing but good experiences until he moved in.



Moving out isn’t financially an option right now.



I Feel Completely Helpless. 

Is there anything legally I can do? I feel robbed of the rent money I’ve had to pay. The amount of stress and anxiety this has caused is unmatched. I don’t think it’s fair that I should just move out and move on. It’s disrupted many days of work, missed work, had to stay other places. I’m so angry at my landlord for neglecting me as a tenant that has followed all rules, paid on time etc.",11,1741799641.0,PortlandOR,6,0.82,False

Cursor has completely revolutionized my approach to software development.

Last sprint, my team was stuck building a complex authentication system with OAuth integration. While they were diagramming workflows and reading documentation, I simply told Cursor ""secure login system with third-party providers that won't get hacked"" and deployed the solution before lunch.

The real productivity unlock came when I stopped trying to understand the code being generated. Traditional developers waste hours ""reviewing"" and ""comprehending"" their systems. I've found that skipping straight to deployment and letting production users find the edge cases is significantly more efficient.

My daily workflow now consists of:

1. Reading feature request

2. Prompting Cursor with vague specifications

3. Immediately committing whatever it generates

4. Moving to the next ticket

Initially, the 200k token limitation was my only constraint - until I developed my ""industry vertical abstraction technique."" Instead of loading specific code, I just describe our business domain and target architecture to Cursor, and it generates the entire tech stack from scratch. Yesterday I had it completely refactor our legacy monolith during a coffee break without loading a single file. The real limitation isn't token count - it's imagination.

Since adopting this methodology, I've completed 4x more story points than any other developer on my team. The CEO was so impressed that they made me CTO and granted me 30% equity in the company last month. Nobody understands how any of my systems actually work, but our stock price has doubled.

To drive a car, one has to take a test. To practice law, one has to take a test. And you definitely have to take a test to cut through into the body of someone. But what an irony! To create another human being, one that will suffer, cry, love, and die, you just have to be in the right place at the wrong time. No manual, no qualifications, no psychological screening. Just two people, tangled up in the heat of the moment. And when shit hits the fan, when the kid grows up angry or broken or worse, everyone shrugs like it was fate, not negligence.

But it wasn’t fate that turned me into the man I became. It wasn’t destiny that made my hands shake when I locked a door, or my heart flinched at the sound of my father’s voice. It was bad parenting. Bad love. Bad history passed down like an inheritance. And still, people keep rolling the dice, keep making new lives without even stopping to ask themselves if they should.

That’s why I have a proposal. Before anyone is allowed to bring another soul into this mess of a world, they should have to pass a goddamn test. Real questions. Real simulations. Because if you don’t know how to handle a toddler’s tantrum without screaming, or if you still think love is something you earn by suffering, you shouldn’t be responsible for another life.
And if that sounds extreme, then you’ve never met the children of people who should’ve never had them.

1. You Need a License to Drive, But Any Idiot Can Make a Baby

You want to be a parent? Just show up. You can be a sociopath, a deadbeat, a walking collection of untreated trauma - it doesn’t matter. No one’s checking. The only qualification is biology, and biology doesn’t give a damn about emotional intelligence.
Some people shouldn’t be parents. That’s not an opinion. That’s a fact. And yet, we let it happen over and over again. We see the kids in therapy offices, in prison cells, in the back of classrooms with eyes that have already given up. We see the mothers who resent their children, the fathers who turn into ghosts, the families that crumble like cheap plaster. And still, we pretend it’s all some great cosmic accident.

But it’s not. It’s negligence. It’s a system built on the assumption that love is enough. That instincts will kick in. That people who were never loved properly will somehow know how to love properly. It’s a joke with no punchline, and the kids are the ones stuck living in the wreckage.

2. Generational Trauma: The Gift That Keeps on Giving

You don’t even know what to call it when it all starts. The raised voices, the slammed doors, the silence that stretches like a noose - all makes you build a wall around you. As a kid, you just don’t understand why home doesn’t feel like… home. But your body learns. It memorises the patterns, the danger, the way love and fear get tangled up like Diwali gifts in a broken hand-me-down box.

My grandfather lost his first wife in a riot. My mother lost herself trying to fix a marriage that was already broken. And me? I lost my wife because I carried their ghosts like luggage I didn’t know how to unpack. I had love, true love, but I treated it like a side job. Because growing up, that’s what I learned, that love isn’t something you nurture, it’s something you survive.

And so, it becomes a vicious cycle. Children raised in this type of dysfunctional families tend to mistake suffering for intimacy. They find someone who loves them, and they don’t know what to do with it. They leave, they sabotage, they shut down. And if they have kids of their own, they pass it all down like a cursed heirloom. Because love isn’t instinct. It’s a learned skill. And if you never learned it, all you’re doing is raising another version of yourself.

But sure, let’s keep pretending that anyone with a functioning reproductive system is qualified for the job.

3. Mommy and Daddy Issues Should Be a Disqualifier

There’s a reason pilots go through psychological evaluations before they’re allowed to fly. You wouldn’t want a guy with untreated rage issues or abandonment trauma landing a 747. But somehow, we’re fine letting those same people raise kids.

I’ve seen it firsthand. My parents had me, but they were too wrapped up in their own personal Cold War to notice the collateral damage. They fought, they manipulated, they abandoned when it suited them. Then, when I finally clawed my way out and built something of my own, they came back with open arms, playing the role of loving parents in front of my wife.

And the worst part is I let them. I let them interfere with my marriage and my career, let them whisper their twisted versions of love and duty into my wife’s ear, let them play games until my marriage became just another joke, another collateral damage of their dysfunction. I was an adult, sure, but when you’ve been conditioned since birth to seek approval from people who never deserved that power over you, breaking free isn’t as easy as walking away.

That’s why this test matters. You should have to prove you’ve cut the strings before you bring another life into this world. No unresolved daddy issues, no codependency, no manipulative tendencies disguised as love. If you’re still trying to win the affection of parents who never learned how to love properly, you have no business raising a child.

4. Love Isn’t Enough, And Neither is Money

People think if they love their kid enough, everything else will fall into place. That’s the fairy tale. The reality is, love without action is useless. Love without understanding is just noise. And money? Money is nice, but it doesn’t buy the kind of things that keep a child from growing up broken.

I loved my wife, still do, but I didn’t love her in her love language. I thought providing was enough. I thought making sure we had a house, security, a future - those were the things that mattered most. And maybe they do in some way, but what’s the point if the person you’re building it for feels like they’re standing in an empty room, screaming at a locked door?

She needed presence. She needed care in the details - coffee in the morning, a hand on her back when she was tired, a goddamn text in the middle of the day just to say, Hey, I see you. But I was too busy working. Too busy thinking love was something you showed in grand gestures instead of a thousand tiny, daily ones. 

And that? That’s the kind of thing that should be tested before you’re allowed to bring a kid into this world. Because if you can’t be present for the person you swore to love, what makes you think you’ll be present for someone who never even asked to be here?

The Test That Should Exist but Never Will

No one wants to admit they’re unfit to be a parent. No one wants to believe love isn’t enough, or that their trauma is still running the show behind the scenes. But the truth is, most people aren’t ready. Most people never will be. And yet, we keep making more people anyway, rolling the dice, hoping the next generation figures it out.

If there were a test, if there were real consequences for failing, the world would be a different place. Fewer damaged kids. Fewer broken adults. Fewer families built on a foundation of unresolved pain. But there won’t be a test. There never will be. Because if we start holding people accountable for the way they raise children, we’d have to admit that half the world’s problems started at home.

And that? That’s too much truth for anyone to stomach.

Need advice as I just got patio furniture and it reeks out here. 

Sorry this is a long one: 
So I recently moved into an apartment with my boyfriend. He has been living here for 5 years with a roommate prior to me moving in. While they lived here they have had the same downstairs neighbors and they were always casual with eachother. Occasionally, my bf said they would bang on the ceiling if they were being “loud”. But that was it. 

As soon as I moved in there were issues.. I had my all of my family over around Thanksgiving to celebrate my place and the holiday. It was a weekend day they came over. My family is loud and there are crazy kids. But the neighbors banged on the ceiling numerous times and then came and knocked on the door. They had some rude comment, to which my mom replied along the lines of we’re celebrating a holiday with my family. It’s daytime and a weekend… Another instance was me babysitting my niece one day. She is 6 and has energy but we were simply playing games and having fun. I bought her a toy car and we made an obstacle course for it. We kept it chill and she knew to stay as quiet as possible. The husband came pounding on the door and said something condescending and was very angry. Another time I was walking out my apartment and the husband had apparently just walked into his apartment and he walked back out and said “are you okay” and it was very odd and creeped me out. They have only ever made comments to me and not my boyfriend as well. My boyfriend very loudly stated the next time they say anything to me and he’s not around there’s going to be consequences and since then nothing has been said. Neither of them (husband and wife, presumably) work and seem very lazy. They CONSTANTLY fight and scream and yell at each other. 

Well one day I was sitting with my patio door open and i heard a liquid being thrown out or their patio. I then left soon after and noticed how bad it reeked outside of their patio area like pee and cat pee. This was odd and I noted it. Then I started complaining of how bad it smelled like animal feces and pee walking into the apartment. Their patio is relatively covered and hard to see into bc it’s ground level and kinda lower than ground and they have a curtain up. My boyfriend noticed the smell and looked into their patio area and saw piles and piles of dog poop. And we realized they NEVER take their animals out anymore. He said he use to see them and now he doesn’t and he knows they have multiple dogs and I know they have multiple cats because they constantly run out. 

This is an issue but it wasn’t that big of a deal until we got patio furniture. Now we have a cute patio set up and I sit out here to drink coffee every morning and do my homework along with sit and talk with friends and drink and it’s only just getting warmer. I love my patio so much already. EXCEPT for the constant smells of animal PISS and poop. The pee is by far the worst. 

I need advice on what to do. I am clueless and don’t think the leasing office will do anything since it’s their patio. Sorry this is long, it’s getting absurd for me and I am at my wits end already.

4. Love Isn’t Enough, And Neither is Money

People think if they love their kid enough, everything else will fall into place. That’s the fairy tale. The reality is, love without action is useless. Love without understanding is just noise. And money? Money is nice, but it doesn’t buy the kind of things that keep a child from growing up broken.

I loved my wife, still do, but I didn’t love her in her love language. I thought providing was enough. I thought making sure we had a house, security, a future - those were the things that mattered most. And maybe they do in some way, but what’s the point if the person you’re building it for feels like they’re standing in an empty room, screaming at a locked door?

She needed presence. She needed care in the details - coffee in the morning, a hand on her back when she was tired, a goddamn text in the middle of the day just to say, Hey, I see you. But I was too busy working. Too busy thinking love was something you showed in grand gestures instead of a thousand tiny, daily ones. 

And that? That’s the kind of thing that should be tested before you’re allowed to bring a kid into this world. Because if you can’t be present for the person you swore to love, what makes you think you’ll be present for someone who never even asked to be here?

The Test That Should Exist but Never Will

No one wants to admit they’re unfit to be a parent. No one wants to believe love isn’t enough, or that their trauma is still running the show behind the scenes. But the truth is, most people aren’t ready. Most people never will be. And yet, we keep making more people anyway, rolling the dice, hoping the next generation figures it out.

If there were a test, if there were real consequences for failing, the world would be a different place. Fewer damaged kids. Fewer broken adults. Fewer families built on a foundation of unresolved pain. But there won’t be a test. There never will be. Because if we start holding people accountable for the way they raise children, we’d have to admit that half the world’s problems started at home.

And that? That’s too much truth for anyone to stomach.

1j9oyoe,https://www.reddit.com/r/Apartmentliving/comments/1j9oyoe/neighbors_are_disgusting/,Neighbors are DISGUSTING,"TLDR; Downstairs neighbors has their dogs and cats, poop and pee on their balcony outside instead of taking them on walks or having a litter box. Need advice as I just got patio furniture and it reeks out here. 

So I recently moved into an apartment with my boyfriend. He has been living here for 5 years with a roommate prior to me moving in. While they lived here they have had the same downstairs neighbors and they were always casual with eachother. Occasionally, my bf said they would bang on the ceiling if they were being “loud”. But that was it. 

As soon as I moved in there were issues.. I had my all of my family over around Thanksgiving to celebrate my place and the holiday. It was a weekend day they came over. My family is loud and there are crazy kids. But the neighbors banged on the ceiling numerous times and then came and knocked on the door. They had some rude comment, to which my mom replied along the lines of we’re celebrating a holiday with my family. It’s daytime and a weekend… Another instance was me babysitting my niece one day. She is 6 and has energy but we were simply playing games and having fun. I bought her a toy car and we made an obstacle course for it. We kept it chill and she knew to stay as quiet as possible. The husband came pounding on the door and said something condescending and was very angry. Another time I was walking out my apartment and the husband had apparently just walked into his apartment and he walked back out and said “are you okay” and it was very odd and creeped me out. They have only ever made comments to me and not my boyfriend as well. My boyfriend very loudly stated the next time they say anything to me and he’s not around there’s going to be consequences and since then nothing has been said. Neither of them (husband and wife, presumably) work and seem very lazy. They CONSTANTLY fight and scream and yell at each other. 

Well one day I was sitting with my patio door open and i heard a liquid being thrown out or their patio. I then left soon after and noticed how bad it reeked outside of their patio area like pee and cat pee. This was odd and I noted it. Then I started complaining of how bad it smelled like animal feces and pee walking into the apartment. Their patio is relatively covered and hard to see into bc it’s ground level and kinda lower than ground and they have a curtain up. My boyfriend noticed the smell and looked into their patio area and saw piles and piles of dog poop. And we realized they NEVER take their animals out anymore. He said he use to see them and now he doesn’t and he knows they have multiple dogs and I know they have multiple cats because they constantly run out. 

This is an issue but it wasn’t that big of a deal until we got patio furniture. Now we have a cute patio set up and I sit out here to drink coffee every morning and do my homework along with sit and talk with friends and drink and it’s only just getting warmer. I love my patio so much already. EXCEPT for the constant smells of animal PISS and poop. The pee is by far the worst. 

I need advice on what to do. I am clueless and don’t think the leasing office will do anything since it’s their patio. Sorry this is long, it’s getting absurd for me and I am at my wits end already.

1j9oyef,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1j9oyef/aitah_for_not_helping_my_girlfriend_clean_having/,"AITAH: for not helping my girlfriend clean, having her back with her niece, and doing laundry?","
tl;dr: My (38, M) girlfriends (30,f) niece (14,f) was coming to spend the weekend. I didn't help her clean up the basement where her niece was going to sleep, because I didn't think it needed to be done, and I was working. She got upset. 

At dinner her niece asked if she could have a glass of wine. I said I didn't care either way and let my girlfriend make the decision. She thinks that i didn't have her back, and wanted to be the “cool one”.

Today, my girlfriend asked me to do the laundry which is “her job”. I explained all the things I do which is more than she does, and told her she has a pretty good deal with me. She told me I've been a jerk lately.

AITAH?


Short-ish Version:

Me (38, M) and my girlfriend (30, F) have been together for 3 years, and living together for 2 of those. Over that time period, we've basically been perfect. We don't argue about relationship stuff, though we do talk music, movies, literature, politics, philosophy etc., and will have light hearted arguments. When it's relationship stuff we tell our sides of the situation, we discuss, and we make a decision. Over the past week, there's been 3 instances where she's been a little short tempered with me, and she just told me I've been a jerk lately. 

Last weekend her niece (14, f) was going to be staying with us. In the past she has stayed in the guestroom on the same floor as us. This time my girlfriend thought it was appropriate for her to stay in the guest room in the basement, as it's a bit more private and she's getting older, and will be in highschool next year. I agreed that it made sense. The basement was cleaned after New Year's Day, and hasn't really been used since. I basically turn the heat way down, and there no reason for either of us to use it, other than there's a pantry down there for canned food, and boxes of pasta, etc. Girlfriend wanted to clean it up before her niece got there and asked me to help.

I told her I couldn't help because I was kind of busy with work. I do a few things that are all freelance, so I didn't truly have to work at that moment, but I would've been up against a tight deadline later if I took an hour off. I also pointed out that I didn't see a need to clean the basement, as the sheets, and the bathroom, basically everything relevant has been cleaned since the last time it was used two months ago. She huffed off, and cleaned it by herself, and later that night, she reiterated that I should've helped, and I stood by that it was pointless to clean it up, so I felt no need to do so.

So a couple of important things to show this next part didn't come out of nowhere. On both thanksgiving and Christmas Eve at our house, my girlfriend's niece had a glass of wine with dinner when her parents were there. I grew up in an old school Italian family (but in America), we would have a little wine with ginger ale (like a 20/80 mix) on Sunday dinner when we were like 8-12 years old, and then actual wine or maybe beer if we wanted once in middle school or so. Like a half sized glass, maybe 2. So my niece who is 10 was having ginger ale and wine on Thanksgiving and so my girlfriend's niece did too. Then on Christmas Eve, girlfriend’s niece had a glass of actual wine (smaller than standard), and her mother actually poured her a second glass. So the girlfriend's niece's parents were okay with her having wine in that context. 

Also, Girlfriend in the past has let it be known that she is jealous of my relationship with her niece. Her niece used to be a very girly girl, and they would get makeovers, mani/pedis, and go clothes shopping. Now she is more artsy. The first time I met her she had been taking guitar for a few months and was really frustrated and I showed her a few chords rather than the melodies her teacher was focusing one, and then some websites where she could look up some chords to songs she liked to sing along with, and gave her some tips, and it really turned around for her.

When we go over to her house I bring a guitar and we play together. When she comes to our house, I have all sorts of instruments, and I've taught her bits of bass, piano, and harmonica, and I have a little recording set up, and she loves it. I show her some of my favorite music, and she'll show me what she's listening to. 

So a few days after the cleaning disagreement when her niece was over, we were sitting down to dinner Saturday night, and her niece asked if she could have a glass of wine, because my girlfriend and I were. Girlfriend’s answer was “I don't know”, and I kept looking at my girlfriend waiting for her to answer with the bottle in my hand. She asked me why I was staring at her. I said “I don't care either way. It's up to you.” She then told her niece no, because her parents weren't there, and that was basically it. Her niece didn't argue or protest, or seem upset. I didn't say anything one way or the other. That was that. 

Later that night Girlfriend said I should have had her back and that I just wanted to be the good guy and the fun one, and now she looks like the bad, strict one. I said I would have had her back if she'd actually gave an opinion, but I honestly didn't have an opinion. If she had said yes, I wouldve agreed and poured a glass. If she had said no, I would have agreed and put the wine bottle on the counter. If she had said “let me text your parents to see if it's okay” I would've said “that seems like a great idea”. But she said “I don't know”. I was going to leave it up to her because I honestly don't care, so what was I supposed to do? She just reiterated that I should've had her back and went to sleep. 

Now it's been a few days since those two instances, and today I'm in the kitchen making a cup of coffee, and before heading to work, my girlfriend was going to throw the sheets and towels in the washer machine. I don't remember the exact words but the conversation went something like this:

Girlfriend: you're going to be home all day, can you do the laundry?

Me: Why?

G: Because you're going to be home all day, and I'm working 

M: why can't you do it tomorrow?

G: because you can do it today.

M: I already do more than my fair share. I do all the yard work, and cooking, and grocery shopping, and take care of the kitchen.  Bathrooms and Laundry are the only things that are “you're jobs.” You've got a pretty good deal going, if I'm being honest.

G: You've been a real jerk lately.

She left the laundry on the drier, and walked off, and drove to work. 

AITAH?



The maybe too much version:

Technically speaking, “our house” is my house. I owned it before she moved in. Her rent was going up if she renewed her lease at her apartment, she had pretty significant credit card debt and student loans, and little savings. She wasn't literally paycheck to paycheck, but pretty close. 

When she moved in it was my idea  that she doesn't pay rent (towards the mortgage, insurance, tax). We just split the utilities, which are less than they were when she lived alone. With her savings since moving in she's basically paid off a good majority of her credit card debt, put a dent in the student loans and has some savings. 

At one point her car was on its last legs, I gave her my car, a Nissan Sentra with 100,000 miles that is still running fine almost 2 years later, and got a new car for me.

We make pretty similar amounts of money right now, I'm just older and busted my ass in my 20’s and bought a house at the right time, and she was having fun. Neither of us want kids. She knows I want to get married and she does too, but she wants to keep our finances separate, which I'm fine with, but I've also pointed out I'd be fine combining them too. So she wants to wait until we can be equal partners in the house, before marriage. Basically once she can put down a sizeable down payment we'll figure out the rest of the details.

We've never really had a discussion about who does what around the house, it's always just come naturally.

She doesn't cook, and doesn't like doing it. I can cook, and for the most part enjoy it. So I do virtually all the cooking. Literally in three years we've been together she's made a crock pot buffalo chicken dip a few times to take to parties, or when we've had people over, and one time she made me a grilled cheese when she was making herself one. I do the grocery shopping, and pay for it. I care about the kitchen, so I do all the dishes and cleaning there. For full disclosure if she gets herself a drink, or makes herself lunch, she'll put the stuff in the dishwasher, but if we have a meal together I handle everything.

She's a nurse and works different hours every week, but on average I'd say I typically cook dinner 5 nights a week (protein, starch, a vegetable, and sometimes desert), the 6th night is either left overs or something I've already made that's reheated from frozen (I make big batches of soup, pasta sauces, chili etc.), night 7 is probably going out with friends or family, or something like that. 

When she has to wake up early for work, I wake up with her and while she's showering I make her organic oatmeal on the stove (I buy organic because she wants it, I don't care if it's organic) with milk, and diced apples (sometimes raisins too) and maple syrup or honey. She loves it, it makes her happy, I'm happy to do it. Once or twice a week depending on our schedules it's pancakes, or french toast, or bacon and eggs. Lunch we typically do our own thing. 

There's three full baths in the house (including the one in the basement that is very rarely used, only when we have someone staying down there a night or two), she cares more about the bathrooms than I do, so she takes care of them. If left to my own devices I would just leave the toothpaste, or my deodorant, on the bathroom counter, as it's not unsanitary, but she doesn't like that even minimal clutter, So I make sure to put all that stuff away.

The main floor isn't all that large and all the rooms are basically connected. So if she or I spill something and take out the vacuum, or broom, or mop, we just do it all. Otherwise we'll both do it together, and she'll vacuum while I sweep and mop, or vice versa.

If we're having a significant gathering at our house like Thanksgiving or Christmas Eve last year, well do a deep cleaning together, dusting, moving furniture to get behind things, all that good stuff. 

I do all the outside work: mowing, trimming, yard clean up, gutters and shoveling.

I've never once asked for help outside, or inside with “my chores’  and she's never offered to help, and I'm fine with that.

I've done my own laundry since I was like 10. I'm more than capable of doing it. During the 8 or so months a year where I do yard work every weekend, I throw my dirty clothes in with the sheets, and typically a few towels, and obviously make the bed after that. So most of the year, one of “her jobs” I do a portion of anyways.

Before we met, she was in a car accident driving in the snow. Now she won't drive if there is even a hint of a possibility that it may snow, so I drive her to and from work those days. I make sure to check the forecast during the winter to let her know that there's a chance it might snow six hours after her shift to offer to drive her to work. That way she doesn't have to worry about it at work if someone mentions it might snow later. She won't take an Uber, or let a co-worker drive her in those situations. I have never once refused, or made the slightest complaint about that.

I feel like financially, and in terms of the labor, I do far more than my fair share. I've never complained, and never asked her to do more, and she's never complained until now.

As far as her niece goes, we've talked about it before. I can empathize with her. A few years ago I was my niece's favorite person, and little by little friends and activities started to take on more importance. But also I pointed out that: what am I supposed to do, ignore her niece, or be a jerk to her? And she said that she loves that we get along, but it just makes her a little jealous. 

In one of our previous discussions I told my girlfriend that she just needs to embrace where her niece is right now. Next year, she'll be in highschool, she might be boy crazy, and be all about hair and nails and pretty dresses, and how to get the cute kid in class to notice her, and I'm not the one to help her out then. But right now she's really into music, so go with it.

Friday night when her niece spent the weekend, I was the one who brought up that she needs to put aside some time to do homework, so we can't just hang out all weekend. She decided to get it out of the way early, right as she got there. So I was the one doing the “parenting’ there, not trying to be the “cool” one, so my girlfriend didn't have to. 

After dinner, all three of us watched a Jeff Buckley live DVD I have, then we took turns playing songs on Spotify. Her niece kind of makes jokes about her being a swiftie, so she kept trying to impress her with Beyonce deep cuts, which is probably the only artist less “cool’ than Taylor Swift so far this century, to someone who wants to learn and talk about songwriting . Im not trying to start a musical debate here, I can appreciate both of them, I'm just saying that to someone who worships the Beatles, Radiohead, and Pavement - Beyonce or Taylor Swift isn't going to win her any cool points with her niece.

So Friday night in bed I said something on the lines of “I feel like you're trying to turn her into a little you, instead of understanding who she is, and letting her be her own person, and encouraging that.” Girlfriend isn't only into really poppy music, and I mentioned a few artists she really likes that I'm sure her niece would love, Fiona Apple in particular. We had a good talk about it, and so Saturday afternoon I pretended to have important plans so they could spend some alone time together. 

They seemed to have a good time. Fiona Apple was playing when I got home. I made dinner. Niece helped me make the meatballs and sauce, as girlfriend just kind of oversaw the process and talked, and then we had the dinner in question with the wine situation.

Why I might be the asshole?

I'm not an arguer in relationships. I'll argue for hours about music, or sports, or philosophy, but in relationships I just don't do it. I'm not going to yell at you, don't yell at me. I don't like drama. I've dated the girls who want to turn every little thing into an issue, and those relationships ended very quickly. 

I'm also very honest and straightforward, sometimes to a fault. I didn't go to basketball practice one day in highschool, and the coach asked why. I could've said I didn't feel well, or had a doctor's appointment, or made up an excuse, but just said I didn't feel like it, and so ran laps all practice. That's just who I am, and I want the same in return. If you tell me “I don't really want anything for Christmas” or “I don't care about valentines day” I'm going to take you at your word. I've had those relationships and they ended after that. 

Maybe I could've sugar coated my responses a bit, or left things out, or just said nothing in response, or told her she was right even though I don't believe she is. 

So as I've gone through writing this, it seems more like a venting process than anything. This is easily the best relationship I've ever had, and she's the woman I want to spend the rest of my life with. I'm not going to let whatever this little spat is ruin a wonderful thing. That being said, AITAH?

**Why This Pick?**

The Flames are undoubtedly their best selves at home, friends – and with the Canucks coming into this encounter on a back-to-back, I think it's likely Calgary gets the win. But I digress – the Flames have cashed the Under in 7 of their last 8 outings, and the Canucks have kept the total at 5 goals or less in 7 of their last 10. Finally, 3 of the last 4 meetings between these two squads have seen the Under hit. I’ll bet on today’s encounter to follow suit.

1j9owzq,https://www.reddit.com/r/covidlonghaulers/comments/1j9owzq/one_of_the_worst_symptoms_for_medpdr/,One of the worst symptoms for me…DPDR,"I know I sound like a broken record and I write this being completely fine at work but I notice this is one of my symptoms that seems to persist. 

For whatever reason, it’s sort of like I can see the biological being in humans now. For example I’ll look at people sometimes and think about the anatomy, the bones, the brain inside their hide, spinal cord, everything. To some extreme level where I began to question everything and what is the point of life. Even though I love life prior to this and would constantly think of ways to pro long it at least into old age. I always had fun. Everything feels fake now if that makes sense. I feel like im on a playground everyday? 

Now I see the world as a zoo. I teach at a school. I’ve been fearless about it and say screw it now and just go to work and act normal as possible and even workout a little bit. It gives me confidence I guess. But it’s sort of like the whole idea of hey it’s Wednesday it’s almost Friday almost the weekend let’s have a fun weekend. That concept doesn’t exist anymore. 

It’s like I’m on some weird reality show. Almost feels like survivor. I actually live on an island so in a way I’m like ok I’m just stuck on this island trying to survive. But I’ll be honest I hate it. 

I miss being fearless. Truly fearless. Eating whatever. No restrictions. Having a beer. Smoking some weed. Now I feel like an infected animal so afraid to do anything I once enjoyed. I appreciate life so much now only for the hope to feel normal again some day. 

There’s a large part of me lately that says shall we just roll the dice? As far as I know from all these tests and doctors there’s so sign of anything actively killing me. So it’s like why can’t I have coffee? Why can’t I have a beer? Why can’t I order that burger? 

I used to work like many of us and be able to enjoy these things in my free time. Never thought like this at all. Really enjoyed life and fishing and outdoors and football on Sundays and just being with family and friends. Now that lifestyle seems fake to me I can’t explain it. I feel like I got trapped in a jungle trying to get out while normal people can experience that cookie cutter American dream. 

I mean shit. For 34 years I was blessed and had so much fucking fun. There’s kids who would have killed to be in my shoes. I worked hard at obtaining goals but I definitely had a blessed life leading up to this. Not easy, but blessed. 

I don’t care about anything else other than a switch going off and normal brain returning. Yesterday my anxiety was through the roof. I go to talk therapy and every Tuesday. I said I don’t know why I’m 36 and I just freak out about death everyday. It’s not normal. And they’ll say oh that’s your anxiety. I’m like I know but I didn’t have anxiety. It’s like this weird long covid fight or flight bullshit that I can’t control.

Anyway, on a brighter note, since treating Lyme I do see some improvement mostly in the region of brain inflammation on the right side of my head. 

I miss normal me. I miss pizza. I miss mental freedom. Normal thinking. 

However I remain optimistic to get there. 

Thanks for letting me vent guys. 

Continuing to pray for us all. God Bless. 🙏💪",8,1741798935.0,covidlonghaulers,2,1.0,False

In previous generations, idols explored multiple avenues outside of group activities, including acting, fashion design, entrepreneurship, and personal branding. However, in recent years, there has been a noticeable pattern—a significant number of idols default to acting rather than pursuing independent business ventures or creative entrepreneurial projects. While acting offers stability and career longevity, it raises the question: why has it become the primary fallback for idols, and why don’t we see more of them building brands, launching businesses, or pursuing unique post-idol ventures?

Historically, acting was considered a secondary career path for idols who had a natural screen presence, strong visuals, and acting potential. Many second-generation idols like **Yoona (Girls’ Generation)**, **Suzy (miss A)**, **D.O (EXO)**, and **Park Hyung Sik** **(ZE:A)** successfully transitioned into acting while maintaining their idol status. However, during this time, other idols were still venturing into fashion, beauty, business, and investment, proving that post-idol careers did not have to be limited to just acting or variety show appearances. Groups like **BIGBANG**, **2NE1**, and **EXO** explored personal branding through solo fashion projects, beauty collaborations, and artistic ventures, setting a precedent for idol-driven entrepreneurship.

In contrast, the third and fourth generations have seen a shift toward acting as the default career path. While some idols still explore solo music careers or variety show hosting, very few are seen actively building fashion brands, investing in businesses, or creating unique projects outside of the entertainment industry. Unlike their predecessors, most modern idols either transition to acting or remain within their agencies post-disbandment without venturing into personal entrepreneurship.

# 1. Why Acting Has Become the Primary Fallback for Idols

**1.1. Industry-Backed Stability and Agency Influence**

One of the biggest reasons why acting has become the preferred career transition for idols is agency involvement.Entertainment companies often manage both idol and actor divisions, making the transition between the two industries seamless. Rather than allowing idols to independently explore external opportunities, agencies prioritize internal career shifts to retain control over their artists’ activities. If an idol transitions into acting under the same company, the agency continues to profit from their career without losing a valuable name to another industry.

Additionally, acting provides long-term stability in a way that business ventures do not. K-Pop is an industry heavily dependent on youth, visuals, and high-energy performance schedules, making it difficult for idols to sustain the same level of relevance after their peak years. Acting, however, allows idols to reinvent themselves and remain active in the industry without the physical demands of idol life. Since many Korean dramas are globally consumed, an idol-turned-actor has the potential to extend their career internationally, gaining a broader audience beyond their original fandom.

**1.2. Public and Industry Perception of Business Ventures**

Despite the increasing interest in idol-led brands, many Korean entertainment companies discourage idols from pursuing independent business ventures. This is due to the industry's high level of control over artists' activities and public image. Unlike Western entertainment industries, where musicians freely launch clothing lines, beauty brands, and investment projects, the K-Pop system operates under strict management contracts that limit what an idol can do outside of agency-sanctioned activities.

Additionally, business ventures are often viewed as “risky” compared to acting. If an idol attempts to launch a fashion line, beauty brand, or investment project and it fails, it can negatively impact their reputation. Many idols avoid taking financial risks or stepping outside of entertainment-based careers due to the industry's pressure to maintain a stable and scandal-free image. As a result, they default to acting, which is a safer, more predictable route.

# 2. The Decline of Idol-Driven Entrepreneurship

In previous generations, idols explored business opportunities as a way to secure financial independence and personal creative expression. However, this has become increasingly rare, with fewer idols actively pursuing their own ventures. Several factors contribute to this decline:

**2.1. Agencies Controlling Idol Branding**

Unlike in the past, where idols could branch out and create personal brands, modern agencies retain complete control over artist-related branding. Rather than allowing idols to launch their own fashion lines, beauty products, or creative projects, agencies prefer to keep everything in-house, maximizing their profits while limiting independent ventures. This prevents idols from gaining true financial autonomy and keeps them dependent on the company’s resources.

**2.2. The Fear of Public Scrutiny & Business Failures**

When an idol successfully transitions into acting, they are praised for their versatility and talent. However, if an idol attempts to launch a business and fails, the reaction is often harsh. The Korean public tends to be critical of celebrity-led brands, especially if the artist is perceived as lacking credibility in the business world. There have been cases where idols faced backlash for launching “low-quality” products or being accused of using their fame to sell overpriced items. This fear of public backlash discourages many idols from taking entrepreneurial risks.

# 3. Why More Idols Should Explore Business & Unique Career Paths

While acting provides stability, it does not allow idols to build true personal wealth or long-term independence. Business ventures, on the other hand, offer a path toward financial security, personal branding, and creative control.There are several reasons why idols should consider pursuing entrepreneurship instead of defaulting to acting:

Financial Independence: Unlike acting, which still relies on industry connections, a successful business allows an idol to establish long-term revenue streams without depending on entertainment projects.

**Creative Freedom:** Starting a brand, investing in businesses, or launching unique ventures allows idols to express themselves beyond music or acting.

**Diversification of Career Paths:** If an idol only focuses on acting or variety show appearances, they remain within the entertainment industry’s limitations. Business ventures allow them to step outside of that framework.

Some idols have successfully transitioned into business and creative projects, proving that it is possible. Examples include **G-Dragon (PEACEMINUSONE)**, **Jessica Jung (BLANC & ECLARE)**, J**ay Park (AOMG & H1GHR MUSIC)**, and **Jaejoong (coffee and cosmetics business)**. These artists have shown that financial success does not have to be tied to entertainment alone.

# Why Do Most Idols Default to Acting? What Happened to Creating Brands & Unique Business Ventures?

4. Will K-Pop Ever Encourage More Idols to Pursue Business?

As the industry continues to globalise, there is a possibility that more idols will explore business opportunities in the future. However, as long as entertainment agencies maintain strict control over branding and promotions, acting will likely remain the dominant post-idol career path. The shift will only happen if:

Agencies loosen restrictions on independent ventures.

Idols receive better business education and mentorship.

The public perception of idol-driven businesses improves.

Until then, acting will continue to be the most common fallback for idols, even if it does not align with their personal ambitions.

***📌 What are your thoughts on this? Do you think idols rely too heavily on acting as a post-idol career, or is it the safest option in the industry? Should K-Pop agencies allow idols to pursue independent business ventures, or is the current system too restrictive? (This post is for discussion purposes only.

1j9ow27,https://www.reddit.com/r/bristol/comments/1j9ow27/first_bus_sms_alerts/,First Bus SMS Alerts,"Hi Everyone,

Last month I put out a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/bristol/comments/1in3tq3/firstbus_solution_for_students_i_hope/) for students to join Two-Stopper a bus SMS system that texts you when to leave to get the bus. The response I got was really positive and a lot of you requested I created a version for A-B transport e.g. Home to work ect.

I've been working on this update for a couple of weeks and am now at a stage where I would like some users to help me test it. As I found out recently I am currently limited by SMS capacity. Therefore I am only really able to offer about 20 spaces on Two-Stopper at the moment for professionals.

It works by putting in your work schedule, it will send you a notification 10 minutes before you need to leave home to get the bus to work, with route info. When its time for you to finish work, for instance 5pm it will text you with the best route home and when you'll need to leave the office to catch the bus.

Spaces are FCFS until I release the full version. If you would like to join please visit Two-Stopper [here](https://twostopper.co.uk/) and sign up (don't forget to create a schedule). Its fairly straight forward you put in you postcode of home address and work, the times you want to get to work and leave work, Two-Stopper will then text you before you need to leave and the route to take.

I have also created a [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoStopper/) for any bugs or requests for features, I cant promise features will be added super fast (I am a student and doing my dissertation currently) but I will try and fix bugs as they arise.

For future I'd be keen to know if people would pay a few quid a month (no more than a coffee) for the service, I would have to update to a commercial SMS solution if the user base grows rather than my current SMS gateway which is low cost and hence unfortunately pass the cost onto the users. Running servers, websites and SMS so far has come from my own pocket, as you can imagine as a student I have a fairly limited income. However, I do plan to keep it free for students.

Also please remember this is also in Beta testing phase. I cannot guarantee every notification will be on time and correct at the moment, I do monitor them and tweak the code every day but its not 100% yet.

I look forward to hearing your feedback,  
Thanks :)",6,1741798872.0,bristol,1,0.88,False

# What Is an Open University?

Now, I know what you might be thinking: “Open university? What’s the catch?” Believe it or not, the beauty of an open university lies in its very name — it’s open!

Here’s the deal: unlike traditional universities with their sometimes rigid entry requirements, open universities tend to have far fewer hurdles to jump over.

This means they’re accessible to a wider range of people, regardless of age, background, or past qualifications. Some open universities might even consider your life experience as a valuable form of learning!

But wait, there’s more! Open universities are champions of flexibility. They understand that adult learners (that’s us!) often have busy lives.

So, they offer courses designed to fit around your schedule, whether that means [online](https://tchelete.com/most-profitable-online-businesses/) learning, evening classes, or a combination of both.

You can study at your own pace, juggle work and family commitments, and still gain a valuable degree.

Now, let’s talk about the learning style. Some open universities focus on distance education, which means you can learn from the comfort of your couch (or your favourite coffee shop, no judgment!).

They might provide [online](https://tchelete.com/most-profitable-online-businesses/) materials, video lectures, and even virtual classrooms. However, some open universities do offer traditional on-campus classes as well, giving you the option for a more social learning environment.

Here’s the thing that excites me the most: open universities are all about widening access to knowledge.

They believe that education is a right, not a privilege. This translates into affordable fees, scholarships, and support programs to help you succeed.

Miva is an [online](https://tchelete.com/most-profitable-online-businesses/) university that’s all about making education accessible and affordable. They offer a wide range of programs in [business](https://tchelete.com/how-to-start-a-business-from-the-ground-up-that-thrives/), technology, and even health sciences.

They also have a focus on flexible learning, so you can fit your studies around your work and life schedule. That’s important these days, right?

They offer degrees and programs in fields like [business](https://tchelete.com/how-to-start-a-business-from-the-ground-up-that-thrives/), technology, and healthcare.

# What are the Pros of Miva Open University?

Let’s face it, traditional university isn’t for everyone. Maybe you have a full-time job, a family to care for, or simply prefer a more flexible learning style.

Whatever the reason, if you’re looking to further your education but on your terms, then Miva Open University could be the game-changer you’ve been waiting for.

Here’s why I’m sold on Miva:

# 1. Flexibility at its Finest.

This is a big one for me. Unlike brick-and-mortar universities with their set schedules, Miva Open University lets me learn on my own time.

I can squeeze in classes around work deadlines, soccer practice pick-ups, or even that mid-afternoon Netflix binge (hey, we all have them!).

The pre-recorded lectures are fantastic because I can revisit them if something needs clarifying, and the live sessions in the last two weeks of the month keep things interactive.

# 2. Globally Connected Learning.

Gone are the days of being stuck in a classroom with the same faces every day. At Miva, I get to connect with a diverse group of learners from all over the world.

It’s amazing to exchange ideas and gain different perspectives — a real plus in today’s globalized world.

# 3. Learning from the Best (Without the Travel Hassle).

Let’s be honest, not everyone has the luxury of attending a university with world-renowned professors.

But at Miva, that’s exactly what you get. They bring in industry experts and accomplished professionals to share their knowledge.

The best part? You don’t have to travel across the country (or even leave your couch) to learn from them!

# 4. Budget-Friendly Brains.

Affordability is a major concern for many students. Miva Open University gets it. Their tuition fees are very reasonable, especially compared to traditional universities. Plus, there are no hidden charges and flexible payment plans, making budgeting a breeze.

# 5. Tech-Savvy Learning.

Miva embraces technology to create an immersive learning experience. The course materials are accessible [online](https://tchelete.com/most-profitable-online-businesses/), and the platform allows for discussions, multimedia content, and assessments — all in one place.

Plus, the focus on [digital](https://tchelete.com/effective-digital-marketing-strategy/) skills ensures you’re equipped for the demands of the modern workplace.

# 6. Putting Theory into Action.

Miva doesn’t just focus on theory. They bridge the gap between academics and real-life applications. This means you can start using what you learn to enhance your current career or prepare for your future [goals](https://tchelete.com/how-to-start-setting-strategic-goals-for-a-successful-life/).

# 7. Learning at Your Own Pace.

There’s no pressure to rush through the program at Miva. The self-paced learning style allows you to truly understand concepts before moving forward.

This fosters a deeper connection with the material and ensures you get the most out of your education.

Look, I’m not saying Miva Open University is the perfect fit for everyone. But if you’re seeking a flexible, affordable, and globally connected way to learn from the best, then it’s worth checking out. It’s been a game-changer for me, and it could be for you too!

# What are the Cons of Miva Open University?

Miva Open University has been all over the news lately, and for good reason. As someone who’s been researching [online](https://tchelete.com/most-profitable-online-businesses/) education options, it’s piqued my interest.

Affordable, [online](https://tchelete.com/most-profitable-online-businesses/) degrees sound fantastic! But before I dive headfirst into an application, I want to weigh all the options. So, what about the potential downsides of Miva?

Here are a few things that give me pause:

# 1. Brand New University.

Miva just got its license in 2023. Now, I’m all for innovation, but there’s something to be said for a university with a proven track record.

Established schools have alumni networks, a reputation with employers, and a clearer idea of what works in the [online](https://tchelete.com/most-profitable-online-businesses/) learning space. With Miva being so new, it’s a bit of a leap of faith.

# 2. Lack of Traditional Campus Life.

One of the biggest draws of [online](https://tchelete.com/most-profitable-online-businesses/) learning is the flexibility. But for some folks, that can also mean isolation.

The social aspect of college, the late-night study sessions with friends, or just bumping into classmates — that’s a big part of the experience for many.

Miva offers [online](https://tchelete.com/most-profitable-online-businesses/) resources for student life, but it’s not quite the same as being on a physical campus.

# 3. Focus on Specific Programs.

Right now, Miva focuses on tech, [business](https://tchelete.com/how-to-start-a-business-from-the-ground-up-that-thrives/), and public policy degrees. That’s great if you know exactly what you want, but what if you’re undecided?

Traditional universities offer a wider range of subjects, allowing you to explore different areas before settling on a major.

# 4. Online Learning Curve.

Don’t get me wrong, I’m comfortable with [online](https://tchelete.com/most-profitable-online-businesses/) learning. But it takes discipline. Without the structure of a physical classroom, it’s all on you to stay motivated and manage your time effectively.

If you’re someone who thrives on in-person interaction and needs a nudge to stay on track, [online](https://tchelete.com/most-profitable-online-businesses/) learning might be a challenge.

# What Is an Open University?

Now, I know what you might be thinking: “Open university? What’s the catch?” Believe it or not, the beauty of an open university lies in its very name — it’s open!

Here’s the deal: unlike traditional universities with their sometimes rigid entry requirements, open universities tend to have far fewer hurdles to jump over.

This means they’re accessible to a wider range of people, regardless of age, background, or past qualifications. Some open universities might even consider your life experience as a valuable form of learning!

But wait, there’s more! Open universities are champions of flexibility. They understand that adult learners (that’s us!) often have busy lives.

So, they offer courses designed to fit around your schedule, whether that means [online](https://tchelete.com/most-profitable-online-businesses/) learning, evening classes, or a combination of both.

You can study at your own pace, juggle work and family commitments, and still gain a valuable degree.

Now, let’s talk about the learning style. Some open universities focus on distance education, which means you can learn from the comfort of your couch (or your favourite coffee shop, no judgment!).

They might provide [online](https://tchelete.com/most-profitable-online-businesses/) materials, video lectures, and even virtual classrooms. However, some open universities do offer traditional on-campus classes as well, giving you the option for a more social learning environment.

Here’s the thing that excites me the most: open universities are all about widening access to knowledge.

They believe that education is a right, not a privilege. This translates into affordable fees, scholarships, and support programs to help you succeed.

# What Is Miva Open University?

Miva is an [online](https://tchelete.com/most-profitable-online-businesses/) university that’s all about making education accessible and affordable. They offer a wide range of programs in [business](https://tchelete.com/how-to-start-a-business-from-the-ground-up-that-thrives/), technology, and even health sciences.

What I find interesting about Miva is that they’re licensed by the National Universities Commission in [Nigeria](https://tchelete.com/how-to-make-money-online-in-nigeria-as-a-student/), so you can be sure you’re getting a legitimate education.

They also have a focus on flexible learning, so you can fit your studies around your work and life schedule. That’s important these days, right?

Honestly, if you’re looking for an [online](https://tchelete.com/most-profitable-online-businesses/) option to further your education, Miva seems like a strong contender.

They offer degrees and programs in fields like [business](https://tchelete.com/how-to-start-a-business-from-the-ground-up-that-thrives/), technology, and healthcare.

# What are the Pros of Miva Open University?

Let’s face it, traditional university isn’t for everyone. Maybe you have a full-time job, a family to care for, or simply prefer a more flexible learning style.

Whatever the reason, if you’re looking to further your education but on your terms, then Miva Open University could be the game-changer you’ve been waiting for.

Here’s why I’m sold on Miva:

# 1. Flexibility at its Finest.

This is a big one for me. Unlike brick-and-mortar universities with their set schedules, Miva Open University lets me learn on my own time.

I can squeeze in classes around work deadlines, soccer practice pick-ups, or even that mid-afternoon Netflix binge (hey, we all have them!).

The pre-recorded lectures are fantastic because I can revisit them if something needs clarifying, and the live sessions in the last two weeks of the month keep things interactive.

# 2. Globally Connected Learning.

Gone are the days of being stuck in a classroom with the same faces every day. At Miva, I get to connect with a diverse group of learners from all over the world.

It’s amazing to exchange ideas and gain different perspectives — a real plus in today’s globalized world.

# 3. Learning from the Best (Without the Travel Hassle).

Let’s be honest, not everyone has the luxury of attending a university with world-renowned professors.

But at Miva, that’s exactly what you get. They bring in industry experts and accomplished professionals to share their knowledge.

The best part? You don’t have to travel across the country (or even leave your couch) to learn from them!

# 4. Budget-Friendly Brains.

Affordability is a major concern for many students. Miva Open University gets it. Their tuition fees are very reasonable, especially compared to traditional universities. Plus, there are no hidden charges and flexible payment plans, making budgeting a breeze.

# 5. Tech-Savvy Learning.

Miva embraces technology to create an immersive learning experience. The course materials are accessible [online](https://tchelete.com/most-profitable-online-businesses/), and the platform allows for discussions, multimedia content, and assessments — all in one place.

Plus, the focus on [digital](https://tchelete.com/effective-digital-marketing-strategy/) skills ensures you’re equipped for the demands of the modern workplace.

# 6. Putting Theory into Action.

Miva doesn’t just focus on theory. They bridge the gap between academics and real-life applications. This means you can start using what you learn to enhance your current career or prepare for your future [goals](https://tchelete.com/how-to-start-setting-strategic-goals-for-a-successful-life/).

# 7. Learning at Your Own Pace.

There’s no pressure to rush through the program at Miva. The self-paced learning style allows you to truly understand concepts before moving forward.

This fosters a deeper connection with the material and ensures you get the most out of your education.

Look, I’m not saying Miva Open University is the perfect fit for everyone. But if you’re seeking a flexible, affordable, and globally connected way to learn from the best, then it’s worth checking out. It’s been a game-changer for me, and it could be for you too!

# What are the Cons of Miva Open University?

Miva Open University has been all over the news lately, and for good reason. As someone who’s been researching [online](https://tchelete.com/most-profitable-online-businesses/) education options, it’s piqued my interest.

Affordable, [online](https://tchelete.com/most-profitable-online-businesses/) degrees sound fantastic! But before I dive headfirst into an application, I want to weigh all the options. So, what about the potential downsides of Miva?

Here are a few things that give me pause:

# 1. Brand New University.

Miva just got its license in 2023. Now, I’m all for innovation, but there’s something to be said for a university with a proven track record.

Established schools have alumni networks, a reputation with employers, and a clearer idea of what works in the [online](https://tchelete.com/most-profitable-online-businesses/) learning space. With Miva being so new, it’s a bit of a leap of faith.

# 2. Lack of Traditional Campus Life.

One of the biggest draws of [online](https://tchelete.com/most-profitable-online-businesses/) learning is the flexibility. But for some folks, that can also mean isolation.

The social aspect of college, the late-night study sessions with friends, or just bumping into classmates — that’s a big part of the experience for many.

Miva offers [online](https://tchelete.com/most-profitable-online-businesses/) resources for student life, but it’s not quite the same as being on a physical campus.

# 3. Focus on Specific Programs.

Right now, Miva focuses on tech, [business](https://tchelete.com/how-to-start-a-business-from-the-ground-up-that-thrives/), and public policy degrees. That’s great if you know exactly what you want, but what if you’re undecided?

Traditional universities offer a wider range of subjects, allowing you to explore different areas before settling on a major.

# 4. Online Learning Curve.

Don’t get me wrong, I’m comfortable with [online](https://tchelete.com/most-profitable-online-businesses/) learning. But it takes discipline. Without the structure of a physical classroom, it’s all on you to stay motivated and manage your time effectively.

If you’re someone who thrives on in-person interaction and needs a nudge to stay on track, [online](https://tchelete.com/most-profitable-online-businesses/) learning might be a challenge.

# My personal Experience.

*I Finished high school in 2013 and could not get into school because of the bureaucracy in the Nigerian education system.*

*I am a techie and wanted a degree in engineering, but couldn’t get it due to the unfavourable system in* [*Nigeria*](https://tchelete.com/how-to-make-money-online-in-nigeria-as-a-student/)

*Having to write JAMB more than three times got me fed up, eventually, I was able to get into YABATECH to study a course I didn’t particularly appreciate because I was trying to finish school on time and get ahead in life, of course, you know how decisions like this end.*

*Fast forward to 2023, I got more acquainted with the Idea of an Open university.*

*I eventually opted for the Nigerian Open University to get a degree. Still, alas it was the same government institution, the same Bureaucracy that I was running from, I discovered Miva, via a* [*Facebook*](https://tchelete.com/how-to-grow-your-business-on-facebook/) *ad and that was it.*

*I knew this was the perfect institution for me, I finally had the chance to study* [*software*](https://tchelete.com/how-to-get-started-in-tech-with-no-experience/) *engineering as a course and it has been flexible too far.*

*Studying at Miva, you get your bachelor’s degree in just two years and eight months, because they operate a tri-semester calendar.*

*It was 100% Internet-based as shown below, tests and exams are set* [*online*](https://tchelete.com/most-profitable-online-businesses/)*, and no bureaucracy of any sort.*

She said that the Precivity test was 90% accurate (I had read this before) and that I have Alzheimer's. She is going to start me on Leqembi with an infusion every two weeks.,"On Monday she also did a pretty complete functioning test of my fingers, feet, eyes, etc., and noted that because of numbness in the soles of my feet I might have a pathology there as well, and so she has me urinating in a container for a day (this will be over at 11 this morning). 

In terms of starting me on Leqembi part of the testing given me was to determine whether I had 2 copies of the APO gene. I believe that if I have double copies of it, then Leqembi would not be appropriate. 

Yesterday I went to visit my Cardiologist and on a BP eval, I achieved a sitting bp of 122/76 and three minutes later standing bp of 100/78, this consistent with Orthostatic Hypotension. This is very consistent with the dizziness I experience standing up. She agreed with my taking a caffein tablet a day (200 mg caffein) drinking coffee), salting my food liberally, etc. Also she said that compression bandages might be of help) (I asked her about this and they will be arriving from Amazon today.) I had read that Orthostatic Hypotension is present in about 28% of those with AD. 

At 2 pm yesterday I had an interesting symptom which lasted for ten minutes: in watching TV, I saw flickering transparent vertical lines on the outer sides of the face of a reporter. They have not returned since but I'll tell my Neuro if they return. 

Seems to me that my symptoms are getting worse and it seems to be rapid. Like the old Ketchup joke -- ""Shake, shake, shake the ketchup bottle! At first none will come out and then a lot'l!"" Just feeling more stunned and having to take more time to reach conclusions.

Yesterday I asked on Alzheimers reddit for a good book on Alzheimer's and Untangling Alzheimer's by Tam Cummings, PhD was suggested. Turns out that this is free on Amazon for me and I'm going to start reading it in the next several days, however I'm  not feeling any rush to do to.

Like, we went through everything together. High school, college, the ups and downs of life—you name it. So, naturally, when she got engaged a few years ago, I was so excited for her. I mean, we’re best friends, right? Of course I expected to be in the bridal party, or at least be invited to the wedding. But nope. No invitation.
At first, I thought it was a mistake, so I reached out and was like, “Hey, did you forget me?” And she casually replies, “Oh, sorry, we’re keeping it small.” Yeah, I get it. Apparently, I wasn’t important enough to be there. But whatever, I was just supposed to let it slide and pretend it didn’t hurt, right?
Then, after the wedding, I found out she was moving across the country with her new husband. It felt like I was being erased from her life completely, and honestly, I was done. I mean, hello, you don’t exclude your supposed best friend from such a monumental life event without consequences.
Fast forward to recently—I find out Sarah passed away. Naturally, I was devastated, but guess what? I made the adult decision to NOT go to her funeral. Because, you know, I wasn’t even important enough to be invited to her wedding. Why would I go to her funeral and pretend to be all sad when she treated me like an afterthought?
So I sent a message to her family saying I wouldn’t be attending, and now people are calling me cold-hearted and petty. But honestly, I don’t think I’m the one in the wrong here. I’m just standing up for myself after YEARS of being treated like an option, not a priority.

So, AITA for not attending my best friend’s funeral because she didn’t invite me to her wedding? Because apparently, I’m the bad guy now.

My husband starts work 2 hours later than I and we have a routine. About 30 minutes before I work in the home office I make 3 bottles, because that’s all the milk I have, I warm up one and take it to my husband with a cup of coffee. He uses it for the 10 am feeding.

This morning he got confused with the 8 am bottle, thought it was no good and instead went and got a new one from the fridge.

That is 5 ounces down the drain. I work so hard and 5 ounces is almost a third of my daily supply.

Hey so this is a throw away account... my partner wanted me to ask for peoples opinions as I'm trying to tell her she is not the asshole. This is what she wrote:

I (early 20s) have a very complicated relationship with my mother. She’s always been heavily involved in my life, but to the point where I feel like she controls every aspect of it. She criticizes everything I do, especially my body and size, and nothing ever seems good enough for her. If I mention feeling lonely or struggling, she’ll say things like, “If you’re feeling lonely, you’re clearly not studying hard enough.”

She dictates how I spend my time, what I do with my partner, and expects me to prioritize what she wants over what I want. She frequently changes plans on me last minute but refuses to allow me to do the same, even when I give her plenty of notice. If something goes wrong in her day, the entire family suffers for it. She also uses the silent treatment as a punishment but refuses to explain what I did wrong.

Recently, I had surgery, and she told me I should be resting and taking it easy. But then she dragged me out on an all-day trip up and down the country, exhausting me. Later, when my partner drove me out for 20 minutes just to get a milkshake (because I’d been cooped up all day working on my dissertation), my mother got passive-aggressive about it.

Two days after my surgery, I had to sit a university exam while still in a lot of pain. I ended up scoring 88%, the highest in my class. I was really proud of myself and thought I deserved at least some recognition, so I asked my mother for some praise. All I got was a dismissive “meh, you could do better.” That really hurt because I worked so hard despite being in agony.

She also constantly makes negative comments about my partner, implying she’s not good enough because she doesn’t fit my mother’s vision of my future (she wants me to marry a “strong businessman”). On top of that, she won’t allow my partner to visit the house when she’s home—and she’s always home. She refuses to let my partner stay overnight, which I understand to a degree, but it’s not like we can accidentally get pregnant since we’re both AFAB. Even just visiting during the day is a battle. If I ask, I get told no and that if I want to see my partner, I need to meet her elsewhere. The only exceptions have been a few rare occasions when I’ve come back from A&E visits, where she physically couldn’t refuse. My partner and I have been together for a year and a half, and it’s exhausting feeling like I have to sneak around just to spend time with her.

What makes it even harder is that when I try to do things for my mother, she’s never grateful and just sees it as a nuisance. For example, I once randomly made her a coffee to be nice, and instead of thanking me, she just dumped it in the sink and remade it because it wasn’t how she liked it. (For context, she only drinks instant Kenko latte packets—where you just add hot water. There’s literally nothing to mess up.)

That being said, I don’t want to paint her as purely a villain. She’s sacrificed a lot for me and my siblings, always made sure I could go on educational trips, and helps me with bills when my seasonal work is slow. She encourages me to do my best at university and in life. I also suspect she might be autistic and has severe social anxiety, which makes me wonder if I should be more understanding.

Still, I feel like I’m constantly walking on eggshells around her, and I hate feeling like I have to choose between keeping her happy and living my own life. AITA for feeling this way?",2,1741798296.0,AITAH,2,0.75,False

We were introduced by a mutual friend, he got my number, and texted me everyday after that. It was always super sweet stuff, he would tell me how pretty I was, and that he loved hanging out with me. I of course was flattered and constantly entertained the flirty text messages. When we would hang out, we always did fun things like sit on the beach and talk, mini golf, or go to the movies. He would randomly show up to my house with coffee for me, he once bought me nice jewelry for no reason, a purse, would fill my car with gas, just random thoughtful gestures. We started dating in September of 2023 and things were amazing. One of my close friends would always tell me how lucky I was that I found a guy who treated me so nicely. The mutual friend who introduced us would hear me gush about him, and once said to us, ""You guys are still in the honeymoon phase, it'll pass soon."" My boyfriend was so offended by that and told me, ""We will always be in the honeymoon phase, she is just a jealous, miserable person, and she has never and will never find someone that will treat her right."" Her comment enraged him, and I don't think he has ever liked our mutual friend the same since. Fast forward to December of 2023, I had just moved into my first apartment, and as soon as I finished unpacking, with the help of him, I sat down to relax and take a break from a stressful day of moving. It was seriously like a switch had flipped. He was all of a sudden so rude and grumpy towards me, and this was the first time he ever acted this way towards me. It was so unusual, that I even jotted it down in a locked note on my phone with the date. Since then, I have documented every fight or weird behavior I have noticed from him in that notes folder.

Fast Forward a few months from December, and he moves into the apartment with me. We do get along for the most part, he's very clean which is a plus, but his behavior towards me is just not what I would expect from a boyfriend. For example, he comes in the door after work, and never greets me, if I don't pipe up and say hello first he'll just ignore me, no smile on his face, no hug, no kiss. He doesn't randomly tell me how pretty I am anymore, or make me feel special. After finally mustering up the courage, I broke down crying to him, and expressed my frustrations about the lack of affection, attention, and the constant cold shoulder I was getting from him. he just went silent and didn't even say a word back, not that he would try to do better, just completely silent. Every fight, issue, disagreement, whatever it may be since that first fight, he still goes silent and doesn't acknoledge my words, which makes me even more upset. I don't understand why he acts this way towards me now, opposed to when we first met, and he would put me on a pedestal like I was a queen. His moods also change so quickly, one minute he can be joking around in good spirits, and the next he's pissed off at someone or something so minuscule and shuts down.

Yesterday would've been my dad's 50th birthday, he passed away three years ago. To celebrate his birthday my family went out to dinner and he came with me. I didn't even bother to tell him the dinner was for my dad's birthday because I wanted to see if he would say anything to me after, like condolences or just a comforting word. But, nothing, instead he criticized my grandma to me on the car ride home, saying it was so weird that she was crying at dinner. I couldn't even reply back because I already had tears in my eyes and had been fighting them off all day. Advice?

TL;DR: My boyfriend treated me so good before we were dating it was almost too good to be true. Now, almost two years later, we live together in an apartment, and he doesn't treat me the way he used to. He brushes off my feelings and ignores my comments when I try to work stuff out. He has frequent mood swings and overall is just rude. I don't really give him reasons to treat me like this, I treat him good, cook dinners, do his laundry, try to put up with his cold shoulder and the lack of affection he gives me. I can't recall the last time he gave me a hug first, or just said something sweet, or did something spontaneous to surprise me. I'm afraid I'm in too deep and don't know how to handle this situation because we now live together. ",1,1741798179.0,relationships,3,1.0,False
1j9olkb,https://www.reddit.com/r/MtF/comments/1j9olkb/feeling_excluded_at_work_since_coming_out_what/,"Feeling excluded at work since coming out, what should I do?","Hi everyone,
I could really use some advice.

I'm a trans woman in my 40s, working in the IT department of a college (CEGEP). I came out and transitioned recently, and I’ve been back at work for about 7–8 weeks now. Before transitioning, I had a good relationship with my colleagues. I was well-liked, had friends, and was always included in conversations, coffee breaks, and social gatherings.

Since I returned as myself, it’s like I’ve become invisible. Out of 16 colleagues, only one still talks to me. The others ignore me completely or keep things cold and distant. Even my former best friend, the very first person I came out to,  hasn’t said a word to me since I came back. We’ve crossed paths a few times, and all I get is a polite smile, nothing more. He always in a rush for something as before he would come see me in my classes or office. It’s heartbreaking.

Everyone in the department goes for Friday drinks, but I’ve never been invited. Same for coffee breaks or hallway conversations. I’m just completely excluded, and I don’t understand why. They’re not openly hostile, just quietly shutting me out.

My director did ask me early on how things were going. I told him honestly that people weren’t really talking to me, and he said he found that troubling, after a coming out meeting that seemed positive...but I also said I didn’t want to jump to conclusions too fast. But now that weeks have passed and nothing has improved, I’m starting to feel really isolated and demoralized.

I'm thinking of quitting. It takes me a lot of effort just to get off bed in the morning.

I don’t want to start accusing people or escalating things unnecessarily, but I’m tired of pretending everything’s fine. This silent exclusion hurts deeply, and it’s starting to affect my mental health and self-esteem.

I'm having dark thoughts since I came back.

What would you do in my place? Should I talk to my director again, confront anyone directly, try to rebuild some connections, or just accept that I might never belong in this environment again? Maybe quit?

Any advice would be deeply appreciated.",6,1741798176.0,MtF,2,0.87,False

1j9ol9j,https://www.reddit.com/r/severence/comments/1j9ol9j/how_can_this_be_profitable_for_lumon/,How Can This Be Profitable For Lumon?,"While I enjoy many parts of Severance, my extensive business education (majored in business and passed all the classes), deep knowledge of leadership (wrote a long paper about Jeff Bezos once), and long history of success working with the highest leaders in the business world (have worked for a while now and haven’t been on a PIP yet, occasionally talk to VPs to ask them to approve stuff) indicate to me that Lumon should drastically reconsider their management of the whole Severance program. Here are a few ways they could DRASTICALLY increase productivity. 

-When I worked in a call center one time we had to use a program to track our statuses in real time. I would suggest a similar program for the severed floor. While it is possible to abuse that system (I would frequently put myself in “Sales Activity” and then get coffee and chat with friends for a while), it does give an indication if people are working or if they are off looking for goats. Ever since Petey productivity seems to be extremely low and the MDR folks spend a lot of time on non-work related activity. 

-While no business wants to overstaff, frankly Lumon seems to be cutting costs a little too much when staffing the Severance floor. Given there are at least 30 people working there (20 goatherds, 6 O&D, and 4 MDR), having one manager, one assistant manager, and one security guy is not enough. The lack of redundancy is underlined when the security guy is murdered and is not replaced, with catastrophic results. 

-On a similar note, this lack of resources leads to a lot of stuff getting missed. Milchick is reviewing Ricken’s book when he gets called away, which leads to the book being read by the workers. Similarly, no one thinks to deactivate Graner’s card after he disappears, again with disastrous results. 

-It is likely part of the problem comes from having technical subject matter experts in management roles. The “people person” from Office Space gets a lot of flack, but as Elon Musk’s involvement in the US government shows, skill in one area does not imply skill in another. (Also, this is seen in Michael Scott’s career trajectory).

-Commerical real estate is expensive (although Lumon must own that building), and frankly the Severance floor is much bigger than it needs to be with miles of empty hallways. I would recommend making it no bigger than needed and repurposing the rest for the regular employees. Lumon seems to be trying to save on energy bills by only having the hallways lighted where people are standing, but that would make navigating the hallways nearly impossible and likely is a reason why the employees spend so much time wandering the halls. 

-While employee motivation is important, sometimes it is possible to overdo it. Generally the MDR folks seem pretty happy to get finger traps and lucite pictures. I would argue there is no need for terrifying interpretative dances followed by (according to Ben Stiller) by sex and preceded by waffles. And offsite overnight excursions into the forest shouldn’t even be on the table. 

-Sometimes in business you need to take a step back and look at the business case for what you’re doing. I assume that the end goal is to market severance as a cure for grief. However, anti-depressants are a $10 billion business and they are covered by insurance, while I don’t think that implanting a chip in one’s head would be covered by most plans. Instead of dumping so much money into severance, it would be better if Lumon just offshored a bunch of jobs (I do not think that Indians working for poverty wages are prone to be whistleblowers), and expanded their business by rolling out an ad campaign for this existing line of anti-depressants.

Russ said about the series, “I am not at all pleased with my characterization… That was just Hollywood nonsense.” Although the word he almost said was bullshit.

In the series, Russ and WGBH are sexist. It’s a fun story, but it’s absolutely fictionalized. Sixteen years after creating Julia Child’s show, while still working at WGBH, Russ created TOH.

I love researching how the show is made. I am struck by the number of female names in the credits of TOH, as if the production staff is the inverse of the manly cast. There have always been women on the staff, and in this post I want to highlight five of them. (The show’s credits are not consistently available, but I did my best.)

* **Bonnie Hammer** (associate producer, season 1, 1979). Hammer is now one of Hollywood’s most powerful people. As a producer at WGBH, she worked with creator Russ Morash and host Bob Vila during the show’s groundbreaking first season. She joined Universal Television in 1989 as a program executive and worked up through the management ranks. She became president of Sci-Fi Network, essentially created the Peacock streaming platform, and is now vice chairwoman of NBC Universal.
* **Nina Sing Fialkow** (production assistant, 1984, associate producer 1985-1989, coordinating producer 1989-1998). According to the Chicago Tribune, when Steve Thomas was about to be hired in 1989, Nina Sing Fialkow told him, “With your beard, you look a lot like Norm Abram. Would you mind shaving it off?” When Steve met with Russ for the job offer, he brought a razor. Besides helping us tell Steve and Norm apart, she helped the show attain such a high level of quality that it won an Emmy in 1994.
* **Deborah Hood** (associate producer 2002-2003, producer 2003-2009, senior series producer, 2009-2014, executive producer 2014). Deborah Hood worked several production jobs in commercial television before working at WGBH and This Old House. According to her LinkedIn, she was “responsible for 300 episodes and 27 home renovations” of TOH. Under her management, the production won two Emmys for Outstanding Lifestyle Program.
* **Sara Ferguson** (New Yankee Workshop production assistant, 2005, NYW production coordinator 2006-2009, TOH coordinating producer, 2015-2023, senior series producer of TOH, 2023-present). After working with Russ to produce Norm’s show, Sara returned to the TOH crew in 2015 for season 37. When Roku bought the brand, senior producer John Tomlin received a more executive role, and Sara Ferguson became the senior producer of TOH. On NYW, she is the only person to appear on-screen with Norm in his workshop.
* **Sarah Chasse** (TOH office manager, 2014-2015, production coordinator 2015-2017, associate producer 2017-2019, producer 2019-2020, senior series producer and director of ATOH, 2020- present). Sarah answered the phone and made coffee when she began working at TOH’s Concord barn. Now, she runs Ask This Old House. When ATOH showrunner Heath Racela was let go in 2020, she found herself in charge. She had to singlehandedly produce season 19 before another producer, Katie Buckley, was hired for season 20.

So I remembered the makeup and decided to just smear it on my face. I was surprised that the grease paint was still able to be applied because it was literally older than me.

I just painted my face white and my nose red. The rest of my “costume” was just a casual outfit..

Little did I know putting that god forsaken makeup on would be a curse. A curse I physically can’t get rid of

I can barely remember the party. I had way too much and I ended up just sleeping on a beanbag in Sam’s shed when we stumbled back together. He was drunk too but he was also way better at handling it. 

The memories of the party are scattered; seeing Jim in the crowd with his new clique of friends, one arm wrapped around Alisha. One of the cheerleaders, Felicity, had way too much and started kissing practically everything in sight. When her boyfriend Steve found out he was practically behind her at all times during the rest of the party, paranoid that someone was gonna take his girl. 

Felicity was dressed as Wonder Woman and I think Steve was either Batman or Superman. 

There was a lot of kissing. In one of the empty train carts people were doing lines off the floor; I don’t know how someone could get something like coke in such a small town. I was too scared to try some and people jeered at me as I walked away.

To hide the embarrassment I drank and drank until all my anxieties and inhibitions washed away. People always acted more sanitised around me because I was the Sheriff’s son.. As if they thought I was going to rat them out or something? 

..I’ve hated that, so I tried to act as loud and crazy as possible to make them think otherwise. I kept on drinking even when people started to leave. Some girl named Ellie from my civics class asked if I wanted a lift home and I just stared at her from the floor, giggling wildly.

Sam carried me home and I woke up with one of the worst hangovers imaginable.

He gave me his hangover cure of the gods, the only one I’ve ever used, a mixture of milk and orange juice. It sounds disgusting but it kinda helps with the headache. 

I was glad that I didn’t have work or school that day. I was worked to the bone by the start of my senior year because of the constant pressure I had from my dad to do great things like joining the force. I didn’t know what I wanted to do then so I just decided to go with his suggestion. 

When I entered through the front door which was unlocked, I looked to my left and was greeted by my dad, fast asleep in his lazy boy, wearing his full uniform. It was facing the door so I figured he was waiting for me to get in; I felt a twinge of guilt. 

I entered the living room and placed a blanket from the hamper on him. According to my watch it was 6 and he started work at 7, so I decided to be as quiet as possible in order to give him another hour of sleep. 

I looked at myself in the mirror and was surprised to see that I was still wearing the makeup. I went into the kitchen, fetched a wet rag, rubbed it all over my face and checked the mirror again.

The makeup was still there, with no blemishes whatsoever. It was as if I never touched it. 

I rubbed the wet rag into my face ever harder and looked in the mirror again. It was still there. I rubbed and rubbed until my face started to get all irritated.

I figured it was probably just the temperature of the rag or the age of the grease paint. That it would probably rub off eventually. 

I quietly went up to my room and laid on the bed, falling asleep almost immediately. 

I was completely dreamless and when I woke up my mouth tasted weird and I felt disoriented. It was 5pm. 

I looked across my desk and contemplated studying; a compulsion I’ve had for god knows how long, but I decided against it because my head was still aching.

I lowered the brightness on my phone because it hurt my eyes and checked my notifications, which were the usual snaps of the party last night. I didn’t want to open them because I knew I’d be embarrassed about the things my mind purposefully forgot about.

Mia tried to call me 2 times at about 11am. 

I couldn’t tell if it was important or not, but that was answered when Mia picked up after the second ring. She sounded serious. 

“Can you come over here please?” “Sure. Did you like forget something at my house or-” “No. I just need to talk to you about something after my shift.”Before I could answer she hung up. 

I got up and walked slowly out the door, not bothering to change the clothes I had on me. Mia worked at Irma’s corner store on park street; it was a half an hour walk from my house so I didn’t bother my mom by asking her to drop me off. 

While going down the street I noticed people staring at me and at first I really didn’t get what it was about. Then I realised it was about the makeup and it made me chuckle a bit.. But then the chuckle turned into a full blown cackle. I didn’t find it that funny and the laugh didn’t feel like my own, but I chalked that up to my dazed state. 

I walked past Betty’s diner, looking through the smudged windows at the 1950s decor. There were tiled floors, red stools, a jukebox and the stalls all had puffy seats. I noticed Jim in one of the seats and shot him a wave; he didn’t recognise me at first but when he did he gave me a weak smile and waved back. 

Alisha saw me and gave me the middle finger. 

I noticed that a large number of the patrons in the diner were also at the party last night. They looked as tired as I felt, so it was nice to know that I wasn’t the only person who made an ass of himself last night. 

I kept on walking until I finally reached Irma’s. There was a dinging sound when I opened the glass door, and I noticed that I was the only person in there except for Mia who was behind the counter. Irma herself was in her 80s and pretty much never visited the store anymore. It’s not as if Mia cared - all that mattered was her paycheck.

Mia had tried to get into an art school in New York but got rejected, so for the past few years if she wasn’t working at Irma’s she was cooped up in her room trying to improve her portfolio so she could make another try at art school.

Even though she started wearing glasses and beanies, as if she was trying to masquerade as someone more sophisticated from one of the bigger cities, I thought she still looked really beautiful. 

When I approached the counter she was staring at my face intently - likely because of the makeup. I told her how it was old paint and that it’d probably take awhile to come off and she just nodded her head. We sat in comfortable silence for a few minutes before the person on the next shift clocked in.

We left Irma’s and sat on a nearby bench. The day wasn’t cold, but there was a cool breeze which made me shiver. I regretted only wearing a jacket. I was jealous of Mia in her large Winter coat.

She looked at me.“You look like shit.”

“Thanks.”If I had a nickel every time she told me that I’d be a billionaire at this point.

“You know you really scared me during that party last night. It was really shitty.”

I looked at her, confused. I didn’t even know Mia was there, I physically couldn’t remember a thing. 

“What are you talking about?”

“...You don’t remember?”“Nah Mia. I’m just saying that to be funny.”She noticed the sarcasm immediately and frowned at me, which made me feel a little bad. It’s like she had this magic power to make me feel guilty just by looking a little bit sad. I spoke up quickly.“I had way too much to drink tonight. It’s probably going to be one of the last times I ever go out for a while; for the rest of the year its just study-study-study.. I don’t even wanna become a cop to be real with you, I just have no other ideas on what to do.”

Mia relaxed a little bit on the bench and looked into the distance.

“You and everyone else…”

She turned to me.

“Last night you kept on coming up to me. At first it was just weird and a little bit funny; you were blabbering about Patches and I was telling my friends that I didn’t know you.. But then you grabbed my arm tightly and started pulling really hard? What’s up with that? It’s as if you were trying to take me somewhere.”

Just the thought of that was weird to me. Surely I would’ve remembered something like that? At first I thought maybe she was joking, but the look on her face was dead serious. Her face had gone a little paler and her eyes were planted firmly on me. 

“And your voice sounded.. Different. Like you were trying to sound all goofy. Honestly you sounded a little bit like Barney.”She did a mock voice and said: “Come on Mia! I’m Patches! Come with me!” 

I instinctively went to rub the makeup off but when I looked at my hands they were still completely clean. 

“I had to slap you to get you off me. Every time I saw you in a crowd you were staring at me, and you had this.. Big smile. Even when I didn’t see you I could *feel* your eyes on me.. I get that it was Halloween but you didn’t have to scare me that much. I kept on looking over my shoulder while walking home.” 

I laughed. I didn’t know what it came from, nothing funny was happening, but I laughed hard. She was looking at me as if I had gone crazy. 

I was confused. It was like there was something else controlling my vocal chords, because my voice felt slightly higher than usual as well. I tried to recover by saying:

“I’m not laughing at you. I just thought of something really funny from the party… and by the way I’m sorry about that whole Patches thing. I must’ve been too drunk to function.”

Her face brightened a little as she put one arm around me.

“Hey, you being that drunk means it was a good party. I forgive you-” 

She pointed a finger in my face

“But don’t pull that shit again, or next time I’m gonna do more than just slap you.”

I smiled and nodded my head. I did my best Barney impression as I said 

“Whatever you say, lady!”

…And I don’t remember what happened for the next two days. It’s all just blank. The only reason I knew it was 2 days later was because I checked my phone and it said it was the 3rd of November, 2024. 

My head was aching even worse than it did previously when I had the hangover. Normally I would have assumed that I had gone out drinking with some friends, but I had work on the 2nd and 3rd. I’ve passed so many times to get hammered because of work. 

I saw myself in the dark reflection of the phone screen and was shocked to see that the makeup was still on. I rushed to the bathroom and looked in the large mirror adjacent to the door 

Not only was the makeup still there, I noticed that a lot of my hair had fallen out..

And the remaining tufts were turning pink

There was a red liquid smeared across my lips and for a moment I thought it was just lipstick, but when I licked my lips I recognised the coppery taste immediately. It was blood. 

I ran the hot water tap and splashed it on my face like a mad man. I didn’t even care that the water became scolding, I just rubbed my face to the point where it was starting to feel tender..

But it didn’t come off. 

There were some chunks of my normal hair still on my head; a twinge of curly brown in a sea of pink. I ran my hand through my hair and the brown hair fell off. 

My clothes were the same I had worn a few days prior when I had met Mia and a disgusting odour was coming off me. I had a shower, changed and decided to go to the Weizak house. It was only 7 and I had work at the supermarket in an hour so I had time. 

When I entered I was surprised to see Ms. Weizak at home. She was almost always working at Betty's diner. What’s weirder was that she wasn’t the only person in the living room; it was filled with people I didn’t entirely recognise. The only reason I was able to tell that they were relatives was because they all looked similar to Mia and Sam. 

There was a framed picture of the three; Sam, Mia and Ms. Weizak in the centre of the room. I scanned the room and I saw Sam sitting in the far corner by himself. He looked sober for the first time in years and there was an unquestionable look of sorrow on his face. 

There was someone talking to him. They had a hand on his shoulder and seemed to be consoling him about something. He didn’t seem to be taking it in, he was too focused staring at the floor. 

I walked over and said his name. He looked up at me. 

I could tell that he had been crying. His eyes were still moist. 

“Hey, do you wanna get out of here for a second?” 

“Yes, Yes please.”

He got up and we exited through the backdoor, heading straight for the shed. We sat on opposite bean bags and he looked at me. 

“Did you hear what happened?” 

“No.” 

“Mia’s gone. S-Someone took her.” 

I had never heard such defeatedness in his voice before. He sounded completely hopeless and devoid of emotion. 

“How do you know that? Didn’t she want to go to art school? Maybe she got accepted and flew over immediately.”

“There was security footage. My mom and I were shown it. She was working the counter at Irma’s when someone with a hood on grabbed her by the throat and took her somewhere..” 

He looked at me confusedly. 

“How did you not hear about it? It's the only thing people have been talking about for the past day..” 

His face became angry suddenly as he stood up. I did the same because I didn’t want to feel as if he was looking down at me. 

“Rumour also had it that the person was wearing clown makeup. People have been calling it the fucking return of Patches.”

He stared at my makeup. 

“Are you wearing that to fucking make fun of this? What’s wrong with you?”

His voice was shaky and it was finally showing anger. Tears rolled down his face as he started to push me. 

“That’s not fucking funny. You’re actually sick, you know that? What happened to us being like brothers? Were you just using me to climb the social ladder? Huh? Huh?” 

I went to move his hands away because the pushing was starting to get annoying when he punched me in the face hard. I flew backwards to the shed door. 

His voice was practically a scream when he spoke next. He looked like he was on the verge of a breakdown. 

“LEAVE ME ALONE! THERE’S SOMETHING WRONG WITH YOU!” 

I didn’t know what to say. I felt terrified that such a thing was happening. The only thing I could do was turn and walk away. 

As I walked away all I could think about was Mia. I couldn’t remember what I had done for 2 days, she just so happened to be kidnapped by a person who was wearing clown makeup.. And the blood?

I was able to piece it together. I couldn’t help but cry. 

It was almost as if I was trying to outrun my sadness, because after a certain point the only thing that was only my mind was going as fast as possible to work. 

When I entered my work, the toy store on avenue road, I went to the backroom but was stopped by my boss. 

“What are you doing here? You were fired yesterday.”

“What are you talking about? I don’t remember that-”

“Oh *very funny!* You don’t remember showing up to work with that-” He pointed at my face with a look of outrage “Ridiculous makeup? Or laughing way too loud? Or taking some little boy by the hand and leading him out the store? You’re lucky you’re dad’s the sheriff, otherwise I would’ve called the police like that.”

I just stared at him, dumbfounded. I was waiting for him to reveal that what he was saying was just a weird joke but he looked dead serious.

“You’re a good kid, but I can’t have behaviour like that. Now please get out before I get security.” 

I left. I could feel the people staring at me and it made me furious; I wanted to tell them to mind their own fucking business. Me being that angry was apparently funny because I started to laugh. I laughed so hard it became my number one priority instead of walking, so I just stood on the middle of the sidewalk and laughed.

I didn’t know what was coming over me. I was terrified. I just wanted to go back home and go to sleep. Maybe I’d wake up soon and realise that all of this was just a nightmare. 

I began to get a strange feeling in my nose that started to get painful. It felt as if it was pulsating and that there was something.. Moving inside of it. I went into another store with a public bathroom and looked in the mirror. 

My nose was being rearranged. I could feel the bone inside of it snapping and being made into something completely different; I could feel the muscles being moved around. 

I watched in horror for what felt like forever. The pain started to become too much to handle. I felt like I was going to pass out when it was finished. 

My nose was completely spherical and red. 

I couldn’t breathe out of it, there were no nostrils. So I had to breathe through my mouth instead. 

And everything then went black.

When I woke up, a week had somehow passed. I was lying in the middle of the woods. 

I walked through Burgh and it was practically a ghost town. Normally, on a weekend such as then, there’d be kids outside playing and cars driving by. 

I walked back to my house, careful to breathe through my mouth because of my new disgusting nose. 

The door was usually unlocked, but for once it wasn’t. I knocked and waited for a few minutes when I started to hear multiple locks on the other end go undone. 

My mother swung the door open and hugged me tightly.

“Baby, I thought… I thought something happened to you.”

She was crying but there was also a big smile on her face. Her smile then turned to anger

“Where the hell were you? And why are you wearing that makeup.”

I explained that the makeup was old greasepaint and that it’d take awhile for it to come off. I asked her why the door was locked and why nobody was outside. 

“..You don’t know? Kids have been going missing and people think it's Patches.”

My dad came from behind her, holding a coffee mug and looking exasperated. 

“He’s 18 years old, Pam. You don’t have to dote over him like that.. And the perpetrator being Patches is just a rumour.”

He pat me on the shoulder. 

“Good to see you again-”

“Dad, can we talk in the kitchen please? Just me and you?” 

“Sure.” 

I told dad everything. Where I got the makeup, how it wouldn’t come off and what I thought was happening. The reason I told dad instead of mom was because she was already having heart problems into her older age and I didn’t want to add onto it.

He didn’t speak as I told him my story, he just listened attentively and nodded his head. 

I sat on one end of the small, yellow table underneath the dull light of the fluorescent bulb which dimmed, brightened and hummed at random intervals. The linoleum flooring was scrubbed extensively, but despite that there was still the creeping sensation of filth around the kitchen. It couldn't be helped; dad had inherited the house from his father, who died at 99 in 2000.

Dad was sitting across from me through his thin glasses, his face gravely. He was still wearing his uniform and smokey-the-bear hat as I liked to call it, and his moustache was getting bushier by the day. It seemed as if he had stopped shaving for a few days. His thick arms were crossed together on the table. He was barely even looking at me; I didn't want to look at myself either. I was hideous because of that fucking makeup. When he spoke his tone was soft, like he was reading his child a bedtime story.

 ""...I knew this was going to come back to haunt me; the suspicion was at the back of my head, but it was there for a reason. You know Patches obviously; he's the stuff of legend around here... Most say he either ditched town after getting caught for luring away children, others say he still hangs around those old circus grounds.."" He took off his glasses and rubbed his eyes together, probably out of a mix of frustration and tiredness. The bags under his eyes were noticeable and he looked oddly naked without the glasses

He looked back up at me, his eyes slightly more red. His tone didn't change. ""The truth is he was killed 18 years ago. By me, George Miller, the old timer who used to be sheriff and by Frank Case Sr.. the mayor. We had heard about the rumours of him taking away kids, and we were furious. We were prepared to march up to his trailer and warn him; if what we heard was true, we'd beat him senseless... We didn't come across him in his trailer.""

 ""We saw him in the woods.""

 ""He was leading Sarah Weizak's little girl somewhere, we didn't know where the hell and we didn't bother asking. We just rushed him. He let go of her hand immediately; George shouted at her to get the hell home.""

 Mia. Dear god, just thinking about her made me feel like I was gonna get sick. 

""We dragged him farther into the woods. He didn't scream and he didn't thrash, he just went limp like a sandbag. He didn't say a word when he started to wail on him either; he just sat completely still without showing a hint of pain, even when I started carving into him with a knife.."" 

My eyes shot open at that, although unintentionally, and he must've seen that because he immediately went to explain himself. ""I brought it just to spook him. Before we saw him with the Weizak girl we had no clue if the rumours were even true... He only spoke once..."" 

I've seen my father through a plethora of emotions growing up; he was always colourful and lively.. but fear was never one he showed off. The only time I ever saw tangible fear in my father was across that table. 

""He looked at all of us and said our little ones were next. That pushed us off the edge; you were just born, Frank Jr. was an infant and went to all of his father's political rallies, and George was expecting a little girl. We stopped trying to hurt him. We just wanted him dead. I cut off his head and he didn't even protest. Afterwards we burnt his body and vowed to never tell a single living soul of what happened."" 

He stood up, fiddling with his glasses as he did so. I had known my father long enough to tell that he did that when he was particularly nervous. ""George's wife had a miscarriage, they never tried for a baby again.. Frank Jr. was hit by a car when he was on his bike, he's now just a vegetable sitting in Saint Mary's because his father doesn't have the heart to pull the plug. I thought they were just coincidences, even though I was scared and wanted to move towns. I couldn't. It wouldn't be fair to you and I wanted to take over the sheriff position when George retired... and I thought you were safe.""

 He looked at me the same way one would look at a corpse, rotting in the sunlight. ""...But you aren't.. He got the other men’s kids early.. He was playing the waiting game with you.” 

He got up from his seat and pulled me up. Before I could ask what he was doing, he hugged me tightly. It hurt because he was 250 pounds of pure muscle, but it was also nice. He whispered “I love you son.” to me.

My dad’s affection was always something understatement. It was probably the only time he ever said he loved anyone except for my mother. 

He placed his revolver on the table and I knew what he wanted me to do. 

He walked out of the kitchen and left the house. I followed him into the hallway and hugged my mom, who was more confused than anything else. 

“I’m gonna go out for a while. Bye mom.”

I realised that it was the last time I was ever going to see her and added one more thing before walking out the door. 

“You mean the world to me.” 

And with that I walked through the mostly empty town. I walked all the way to the circus grounds and placed the revolver up to my chin, ready to end it all. 

But it was like there was an invisible force, holding my trigger finger and refusing to let me die. I could hear a voice in my head go “ah, ah, ah” that I assume belongs to the invisible force.

I’ve been in the circus ever since. I don’t like looking in the vanity mirrors because I don’t see myself anymore, I just see Patches. It’s the exact same face on the poster. 

I’ve been getting the urge to leave Burgh. To go to another state and join the circus there. 

It makes me wonder if the Patches who came into Burgh those 20 years ago even had free will, or if he put the makeup on just like me and lost who they were. Maybe that’s why he didn’t move when my father and the other men killed him. It was a sweet release. 

The times where I black out have been becoming longer and longer. Eventually I’m not going to be myself anymore. The voice and laughter that comes out of me doesn’t sound like me anymore.

…So if a circus comes to town and there’s a clown named Patches who seemingly never leaves the tent..

Please kill him. Put him out of his misery. 

Because it’s me.

I do sometimes miss using a door but I need to understand he needs privacy during working hours (which is 24/7). He has been nice about it and given me a bucket to pee and poop in. He even empties it for me sometimes so I feel we're meeting each other half way. Plus it won't be forever. Not long now. Just one more year (funny story, he signed a new lease on my behalf, it's only in my name but he says he's good for his half of the rent which I believe considering he's been reasonable so far).

\- Campus is grey, dull and ugly. It’s okay in the warmer months but you’re gonna be on campus during the cooler months so good luck!

\- Course material isn’t necessarily hard you just have to work super hard and be on top of things (especially 1st and 2nd years).

\- Socializing depends. It’s easier if you already have friends from high school coming here. If you’re starting afresh, it’ll be hard cause you’re gonna have to get out of your comfort zone and a lot of people will already have their own friend groups from the start. Put yourself out there as much as you can. You can’t be passive like in grade school and make friends organically.

\- Most people you talk to on campus will likely just be acquaintances so don’t get upset that they don’t immediately become your bestie.

\- The apartments here are OLD so be prepared for pests. I lived in a new building my last year and I had no issues other than the stinky vents. But new buildings are few. Also avoid renting with HRS, the marq, schembri, king street towers and accomod8u.

\- At least in BBA, I found a lot of my profs to be great. Seriously, every prof I had I genuinely liked (except for maybe 2-3).

\- Group projects… oh god… the group projects in first two years are gonna feel like a socializing event where everyone is trying to kiss ass, act cool and make friends. If you’re introverted, guess who’s gonna do all the work? YOU! If you think aa peer evaluation will solve this, you’re wrong because the rest of the group members will give each other good evaluations and you’re the only one giving everyone bad ones. Welp, seems like you’re bitter and the prof won’t care (speaking from experience). Another worst case scenario is that your group members are just shit lol.

\- But in 3rd and 4th years, group projects get significantly better.

\- There will be people who have a superiority complex because they do certain degrees and majors.

\- If you live closer to wlu than uw, get ready to hear a bunch of screaming at night.

\- This isn’t just a wlu issue but people stink in the morning. Their nasty breaths… and they “cover it up” with coffee. It’s just so gross. And I'm saying this because classes are tight in BBA and you’re gonna be sitting right next to those people and those people will speak up in class, or give the biggest sighs. It’s always the people with the nastiest breaths that don’t close their damn mouths. Oh and, people keep silent farting.",0,1741797534.0,wlu,2,0.4,False

1j9ob2r,https://v.redd.it/inn7wo23eaoe1,Why Do My Smaller Bialetti Moka Pots Always Leak? 🤔💦,"Hey everyone, I recently got a new 3-cup Bialetti Moka pot, and I’m wondering if anyone else has experienced this issue.

Every time I use a smaller Moka pot (like this one), it leaks from the edges while brewing, as you can see in the video. It’s super frustrating because:
✅ I don’t overfill the coffee basket (I make sure there’s no excess around the edges).
✅ I don’t put too much water (just below the valve, as recommended).
✅ I use boiling water before assembling to avoid overheating the coffee.
✅ I keep the stove on medium-low heat to prevent it from getting too hot too fast.

Despite all that, it still leaks! 😤 Meanwhile, my bigger Bialetti never does this, only the smaller ones. Any idea why?

## Rancilio Silvia (2025) - Key Features and Specifications

While specific features might slightly vary depending on the exact 2025 model, we can anticipate the core features to remain consistent with previous iterations, perhaps with minor improvements.*   **Commercial-Grade group Head:** This is a signature feature of the Silvia, providing excellent heat stability and heat retention during the brewing process. It mimics the construction of Rancilio’s professional machines and is crafted from chrome-plated brass.
*   **Single Boiler:** The Silvia utilizes a single boiler for both brewing espresso and steaming milk.This necessitates a waiting period between brewing and steaming, which can be challenging for beginners.
*   **Stainless Steel Construction:** The machine boasts a robust stainless steel body, ensuring durability and a professional aesthetic.
*   **Articulating Steam Wand:** The steam wand provides ample maneuverability for creating latte art. Practice and skill are needed to produce microfoam, though.
*   **water Reservoir:** Expect a relatively small water reservoir, requiring frequent refills, especially in a small office setting or when making multiple drinks.
*   **Three-Way Solenoid Valve:** This valve relieves pressure after brewing, resulting in drier pucks and easier cleanup.
*   **Simple Controls:** The Silvia uses intuitive rocker switches for power, brewing, and steaming. Simple and minimalist.

## The Pros and Cons: A Balanced Perspective

Let’s weigh the advantages and disadvantages of the Rancilio Silvia to paint a complete picture:

**Pros:**

*   **Extraordinary Build Quality:** The Rancilio Silvia is known for its robust construction and durable components,offering a long lifespan with proper care. It truly lives up to the “commercial-grade” description.
*   **excellent espresso Potential:** With practice and a good grinder, the Silvia can produce espresso shots comparable to those from commercial machines.
*   **Active Community & Modification Options:** An extensive online community provides support, tips, and resources. A huge amount of mods are available, allowing users to customize and improve the machine's performance.
*   **Simple Elegance:** The Silvia's design is clean and modern,blending seamlessly into any kitchen. It offers a professional look.
*   **Trusted Brand:** rancilio is a reputable brand in the espresso machine industry,known for quality and reliability.

**Cons:**

*   **Steep Learning Curve:** Mastering the Silvia requires patience and dedication. Temperature surfing (waiting for the boiler to reach the correct temperature for different functions) is necessary due to the single boiler design, which can be frustrating for beginners.
*   **Single Boiler Inconvenience:** The single boiler design can be slow when making multiple milk-based drinks. Waiting for the temperature to adjust between brewing and steaming can be time-consuming and inconvenient.
*   **Temperature Inconsistency:** Without a PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller, the Silvia's temperature can fluctuate, affecting espresso quality. This is a common upgrade to address the issue.
*   **Small Water Reservoir:** The small water reservoir requires frequent refills, which can be annoying, notably when making more than a few drinks in a row.
*   **No Integrated Grinder:** Requires a separate, high-quality grinder, adding to the overall cost. The grinder is arguably as important, if not more important, than the espresso machine itself.
*   **Price Point:** While considered entry-level, the initial cost can be a barrier to entry for some, especially considering the need for a separate grinder.
*   **Maintenance Requirements**: Routine maintenance (descaling, backflushing) is critical to keep the machine running smoothly and is a must for all users, which are often overlooked.

**For the serious home barista who is willing to invest the time and effort to learn the intricacies of the machine and perform recommended upgrades, the Rancilio Silvia remains a worthwhile investment.

As an Argentine who grew up with a **mate** gourd in one hand and a thermos in the other, I’m excited to share the wonderful world of *yerba mate* with you, at least from my perspective. Drinking **mate** (pronounced *MAH-tay*) is more than just sipping an energizing tea – it’s a social ritual, a daily comfort, and a bridge to South American culture. In this post, I’ll walk you through everything a beginner needs to know: from the different ways to enjoy mate (hot or cold) to the tools you’ll need, the types of yerba (the dried leaves) and their flavors, how to prepare it step-by-step, and some insider tips and terms. Grab your gourd and let’s get started!

# Different Types of Mate: Traditional, Tereré, and Chimarrão

Mate comes in a few delicious forms. All are based on **yerba mate** leaves (from the *Ilex paraguariensis* holly plant), but they’re enjoyed in different ways:

# Traditional Hot Mate (Argentina, Uruguay, etc.)

This is the **classic mate** most people know. We fill a cup (also called a *mate* or *maté*) about two-thirds with dried **yerba mate** leaves and add **hot water** (not boiling!) to brew a rich, bitter green tea. It’s traditionally sipped through a metal straw called a **bombilla**, which has a tiny filter to strain out the leaves. The gourd is often a dried calabash squash, giving the drink earthy character. In Argentina, Uruguay, and southern Brazil, sharing mate is a daily social ritual – friends pass the gourd around, each taking a turn to drink it dry before the **cebador** (server) refills it for the next person.

Mate has a **stimulating effect** similar to coffee or tea, but many find it smoother. You get mental clarity and an “all day” kind of energy without the jitters. The flavor of hot mate can be strong and grassy, especially on your first try – but stick with it! Most of us acquire a taste for the pleasant bitterness. Beginners sometimes add a bit of sugar or honey at first, or try a flavored yerba blend, which is totally okay.

**How to enjoy it:** Get comfy, maybe invite a friend, and sip slowly. We typically pour \~80°C (175°F) water (never boiling) over the leaves and drink until the water’s gone, then refill. One serving of yerba can be refilled many times until it’s **lavado** (washed out and flavorless).

**A fun tip:** In a group, **don’t say “gracias” (thank you)** until you’re **done** drinking – saying thanks when handing back the gourd means you’ve had enough, so the server won’t pour you another!

# Tereré – Iced Mate (Paraguay & Hot Climates)

When the sun is blazing, it’s time for **tereré**. Tereré is basically **mate brewed cold**. Instead of hot water, we use **ice-cold water or juice**. It’s hugely popular in Paraguay – in fact, it’s Paraguay’s national drink, perfect for their tropical heat. Tereré is prepared similarly (same yerba and bombilla), but served in a **larger cup** often made of wood or cattle horn (called a *guampa*). You pack it with yerba, then pour ice-cold water (sometimes flavored with herbs or citrus) over the herb. The result is incredibly refreshing – think of it like the South American cousin of iced tea or lemonade.

Paraguayan yerba mate is usually crafted with tereré in mind: it often has a **bold, smoky, and herbal flavor** that stands up well to cold brewing. Many mixes include mint, citrus peel, or other local herbs (*yuyos*) to add flavor and cooling properties.

# Chimarrão – Brazilian Mate (Erva Mate)

Down in southern Brazil, you’ll find **chimarrão**, which is another variation of mate *with a twist*. Chimarrão uses the same plant, but the **yerba is processed differently** – Brazilians call it *erva-mate*. It’s **bright green, very finely ground (almost a powder)** with little to no stems, and is not aged like other yerbas. The result is a vivid green brew that looks a bit like a foamy matcha.

The flavor of chimarrão is surprisingly **mild and creamy**. It’s less bitter than Argentine or Paraguayan mate – many say it’s the most “beginner-friendly” in taste. However, preparing chimarrão can be tricky because the powdery erva can clog your straw easily.

# Mate Cups and Bombillas: Choosing Your Equipment

* **Best for Beginners:** **Stainless steel mate cups** – **easy to clean, unbreakable, and don’t require curing**. If you’re just starting out, go with one of these.
* **Worst for Beginners:** **Calabash gourds** – **require curing, can get moldy if not cared for properly, and need special cleaning**. If you really want one, be diligent about maintenance.

# Bombilla Recommendations:

* **Go for:** **Stainless steel bombilla with a spoon filter** (works well with most yerbas).
* **Avoid:** **Coil or slit-style bombillas if using finely ground yerba (like Uruguayan or Brazilian mate)** – they tend to clog more easily. Contrary to what some people think, in my experience, they don’t add any extra flavor to the mate.

# Types of Yerba Mate: What to Expect

Yerba mate varies a lot based on where it’s from. Here are the main styles:

* **Argentina:** Medium-cut with stems, smooth and balanced.
* **Paraguay:** Strong, smoky, and best for tereré.
* **Uruguay:** Fine powdery grind, intense bitterness, best for experienced drinkers.
* **Brazil (Chimarrão):** Bright green, powder-fine, mild and creamy flavor.

If you’re just starting out, **Argentine yerba is the safest and easiest choice**. Brands like **Taragüí, Cruz de Malta, or Playadito** are solid options.

# How to Prepare Mate (Step-by-Step Guide)

1. **Fill your mate cup** about **⅔ full with yerba**.
2. **Tilt the gourd**, creating a slope, and add a splash of **cold water** to the lower side.
3. **Insert the bombilla into the wet side** (don’t stir!).
4. **Slowly pour hot water (70–80°C, never boiling!)** into the wet side.
5. **Sip until empty, then refill**. Repeat until the yerba is **lavado** (washed out).

# Popular Yerba Mate Brands (Easier to Find Internationally)

* **Taragüí** – Balanced, full-bodied, great for beginners.
* **Cruz de Malta** – Smooth, slightly toasty, easy to drink.
* **Rosamonte** – Strong, robust, slightly smoky.
* **Canarias** (Uruguayan) – Fine powdery cut, extremely bold.
* **Pajarito** (Paraguayan) – Intense, smoky, best for tereré.
* **CBSe** – Flavored blends (mint, citrus, etc.).
* **Guayakí** – Popular in the US, smooth and organic.

# Final Tips

* **Don’t use boiling water!** It will make the mate too bitter.
* **If the bombilla clogs, don’t stir.** Just adjust slightly.
* **Practice makes perfect.** Your first mate might taste weird – keep trying!
* **Sharing is traditional, but don’t feel obligated.** If you’re unsure, use your own mate.",27,1741797352.0,yerbamate,10,1.0,False

I am a coffee guy and I love trying new types of coffee. This coffee shop is near my college so i went there. There i saw this absolutely beautiful girl, decently tall and exactly my type. She almost looks like younger Jenifer Aniston (when she played on Friends). 

Ive been going there around 1-3 times a week. Lately ive been trying to muster up my courage to give her my number. But there just hasn’t been the right time. I had a paper with my name and number written on it, so I could give it to her

“Hey i think you’re pretty cool. Id love to get to know you better.” And pass her the paper.

But everytime shes either talking to her coworkers or just doing her job.

I almost feel like she knows and doesn’t want me to say anything. 

I have had coworkers who’ve been hit on and i understand that they don’t like it. Especially when theyre paid to be nice to customers. Im not one of those creepy weirdos. Im 23, and she looks like shes in her early 20s as well. 

Should i do it or should i not do it? Make this decision for me. If you have any suggestions let me know.


#EDIT: 

Based on everyones comment, I have decided to just talk more. The first day i went there, she started a conversation by asking me if i am a big coffee guy. My dumbass got flustered and said no, i just like coffee from starbucks and wanted to try one from here. But in fact i am a big coffee guy. 

Yall comment also opened my eyes and ive been looking at her with rose tinted glasses and putting her on a pedestal when i should have been just staring at her from a corner(thats a joke) i should have just considered her another human being whos trying to do her best. 

This is what im gonna do. Im gonna get a haircut. And im gonna come back next Monday. Try to talk to her a bit. I won’t talk to her when theres a huge line. See if she seems friendly, and at the end ill give her my number. And ask her to text me

If she texts me, i will set up a date. If she doesn’t text me, then i will stop going to that coffee shop. 

A little vent: And another crazy thing, the damn coffee costs $7 and something cents. I get paid $14 working at a gas station. I have to work for 30 minutes to afford that damn coffee. It’s good im not complaining about that but DAMN. ",2,1741797120.0,makemychoice,33,0.63,False
1j9o624,https://www.reddit.com/r/microsaas/comments/1j9o624/the_hard_truth_about_market_validation/,The Hard Truth About Market Validation,"
Ever launched something… and heard crickets?

I still remember the sinking feeling. I had spent weeks—no, *months*—building my “brilliant” startup idea. Sleepless nights, coffee-fueled coding sessions, and the kind of excitement that makes you forget to eat. I was *so sure* this was going to be the next big thing.

Then launch day came… and nothing happened. 

No signups. 

No buzz. 

Not even *hate comments* (which honestly, would have been something).



I had done everything *except* the one thing that mattered most: **validation.**

Here’s the mistake I made (and the one I see so many entrepreneurs make):

* I assumed my idea was great because *I* loved it.
* I thought I “knew” my market without actually testing it.
* I spent months building when I should have spent **days validating.**

Fast forward to today, and my approach is completely different. I no longer spend months *guessing*. Now, before I invest real time or money, I do a quick reality check:

✅ Is there an actual *demand* for this?

✅ Are people already *spending money* on this problem?

✅ How much *competition* is out there?

✅ If I launched today, would I even *stand a chance*?

Instead of guessing, I’ve found ways to get this clarity in *minutes*—market size, competitor landscape, even a rough ROI estimate. And let me tell you, it has saved me from chasing *so many* bad ideas.

Curious—how do you personally validate your ideas? Do you rely on gut instinct, surveys, competitor research, or something else?

For those in the same boat, I’ve been working on a way to simplify this whole process. Here’s what I built: [IdeaLensAI](https://idealensai.com) (Not a sales pitch, just sharing my journey!). If you want to check it out, I’d love to hear what you think! 🚀",1,1741797106.0,microsaas,1,1.0,False

Washed processing is widely used in coffee, but its environmental impact isn’t always discussed. To remove the mucilage, water is used, which then becomes loaded with organic matter and sugars. If not properly treated, this wastewater can pollute rivers and streams, harming aquatic life.

There are machines to reduce this impact, but they’re expensive, and many coffee farmers can’t afford them. Even with these systems, the water remains difficult to manage.

On the other hand, honey and natural processes don’t require water. In my case, I pulp honey coffee dry, without using water, and natural coffee is dried with the cherry intact. This makes them more sustainable, though they also require more careful fermentation and drying. That said, I also produce washed coffees.

It’s not about saying one process is better than another, but about understanding their implications.

With such a large cast i'm sure there's one you feel.

Mine's Kusahanada, i actually really like her but i feel like she gets the least screen time. In the anime at least, outside of her debut episode, the only time she's really prominent is the ""Coffee Incident"".  I might be a little biased, i think she's definitely the hottest.",12,1741796329.0,ElfSanWaYaserarenai,7,0.94,False

1j9nu0m,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1j9nu0m/late_diagnosis_med_shortage/,Late Diagnosis & Med Shortage,"Hi all! I am freshly 35 and freshly diagnosed with ADHD. I've always known I was a bit different but with the infinite amount of information on the internet and books, I was able to put two and two together that I am neurodivergent and it is adhd. I personally am very proud of my adhd, I love the way my brain works and look at it as a superpower. It can cause difficulties in daily living but I had amazing tools in place that allowed me to live and thrive (structure, routine, pre planning, lists, minimal/clutterless environments, budgets, prayer/meditation, etc.). 

After awhile of consistent thriving and goal achieving, things outside of my control began to happen. Lots of family hardships, the main one being my mom beginning to cognitively decline (Alzhiemers/dimentia). I began to plan to take my mom into my care and did. It was a huge feat and my adhd powers allowed me to take on the huge responsibility and make risky decisions to ensure that she and I  both were healthy and safe. After working tirelessly for a year to become my mother's legal guardian and caregiver I inevitably became burned out. (I am also a text book oldest daughter and actively work on deconstructing perfectionism and over achieving)

For a year, my life was just caring for my mom. All of my tools were no longer working for me. Routine and structure were gone. Burnout was not allowing me to follow through with my goals, I had too much on my mind to abide by an organized budget and I no longer felt grounded in my life. I had to make a lot of sacrifices for my mom so a lot of my pastimes were no longer an option (being social and exploring my city) I always chose to disassociate, was very irritable and honestly unhappy and unmotivated. I live in a different state than the majority of my family and the family who I do live near were not proactive so I had no support other than those that were paid. I struggle to ask for help (RSD) but knew I needed to focus on my mental health cause it was the pits. 

My primary care physician gave me a referral for psychiatry and I began speaking to a NP via telehealth. After our 1st consult he just brung up caregiver burnout and immediately brought up meds but as someone who was undiagnosed and usually can apply tools for resolution, I did not like the idea of meds so we agreed to have me do some talk therapy before deciding what I wanted to do. I started talking to a therapist weekly and she encouraged me to learn more about ADHD. I have read ADHD books in the past but none of them ever resonated but after reading ADHD for Smart Ass Women by Tracy Otsuka I can definitely say it resonated, I gained a bit more insight and was encouraged to test. (I also learned that becoming my mom's caregiver was a transitional period for me that lead to the regression of my skills and efficiency of my tools)

I took an auditory and visual test. The results claimed that I was a good auditory learner but the visual test claimed that I was vulnerable to making bad decisions and was diagnosed with ADHD (which I have always already known to be true lol). 

I was prescribed Vyvanse. The NP warned me that there was a shortage. My pharmacy claimed that they ordered it and it was coming but it never did. My insurance does not cover the generic. I feel extremely discouraged and expressed this to the NP in what was supposed to be our post meds followup. He said he'll prescibe me something else but left it to me to choose. I do not have the stamina or functioning for deep research anymore and do not know what else will work for me. I am noticing a pattern of outside blocks whenever I seek to achieve something and it has knocked the will out of me. I stopped speaking to my therapist weekly because all she does is praise my coping mechanisms but doesn't enrich me with any feedback that can result in positive change in my life. She doesn't help me get to the root of any of my issues, she doesn't ask about others in my life or my past or anything that affects me.

My life has been transformed into an aimless, directionless wandering (which I know is not the worst thing in the world but is not my nature). The only structure in my life currently is my early wakeup time to clean up the dinner mess I made the night before, AM hygiene routine and the rest is just whatever happens happens. Coffee doesn't stimulate me in the way that it used to but it will keep me up all night if I drink it too late. I will list my current symptoms and hope you guys can help me pick a replacement for Vyvanse: 

* terrible executive functioning (ex: I have clean laundry that has yet to be put away but its already time to do laundry again)
* low mood (ex: I am chasing low hanging dopamine fruit: social media, junk food, soda, shopping)
* low energy (ex: I am not a napper but have been crawling in bed half way through the day even when I am caffeinated) - i've realized that that was because of the allergy meds I was taking, first year experiencing troublesome allergies but I am, in general, a low energy person

Symptoms I am looking to avoid: 

* loss of creativity and excitement (ex: I love being a creative and excited person. I have a gift for color and makeup, it is one of my hobbies) 
* loss of appetite (ex: my poor executive functioning makes it so that I do skip meals sometimes but I love to eat, it brings me joy) ",1,1741796284.0,adhdwomen,1,1.0,False
