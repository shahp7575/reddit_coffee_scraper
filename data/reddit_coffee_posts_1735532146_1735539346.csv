1hpgpvw,https://www.reddit.com/r/superautomatic/comments/1hpgpvw/eletta_explore_vs_kf8/,Eletta Explore vs KF8,"Hello Superautomatic experts,

Looking for opinions, reviews and advice.

I am coming from being a nespresso drinker for the last 8yrs using a DeLonghi machine(faultless). Budget will be less than $1500 and I currently have a kf8 on order with insider pass, $1299. It doesn’t arrive until Jan 8th. I see the Eletta on sale for $1430 from BestBuy and can grab it now.

What do I drink? 1. Cappuccinos 2. Lattes 3. Americanos. 4. Iced lattes in the summer. 

Is one machine significantly better than the other? Would your average nespresso coffee drinker notice a difference between the two machines? The iced drink options on the Eletta are nice but I’d prefer to have the machine that produces the better tasting cup.

Which machine would you buy and why?

Thank you!",1,1735538888.0,superautomatic,0,1.0,False

0:00 he is in the lane because there is no bike lane, by law in most places, that is where he is suppose to bike when in lack of a bike lane. Black car was probably honking at him to speed up or move over. There is no visible place he is legally meant to move over to. Bikes in most places are not allowed on pedestrian streets. 

0:11 It appears the runner was running in the bike lane parallel to the biker then took a sharp right into the biker, causing the collision. There is no time for the biker to react here. The runner does not give any indication they were going to cross, so that is why the biker did not slow down initially. The biker does demonstrate in other clips that they do slow down when given enough time if a person is going to cross.

0:15 Skater boy was going the designated flow of traffic... in front of what may be an officer. Biker can't go left, would crash into the stalls, also Skater boy blocks the left path. Biker can't go right too far or they crash into the officer. Biker ultimately avoids both Skater Boy and the officer.

0:21 Biker applies breaks and berates other biker who is on a renta bike. The biker should have braked harder to avoid the renta bike since the renta bike was not giving way. Depending on local laws, the biker would have the right of way and the renta bike should have went behind the biker, making the renta bike in violation.

0:27 Couple does not look both ways before crossing the bike zone. Biker has the right of way. Biker quickly applies breaks and avoids and accident. Couple freaks out. Biker berates them.

0:32 Hard to know what is going on here without further context. Two New Yorkers get into their daily verbal street battle. Not accident occurs. It appears the Biker berates the driver for failing to yield to a red light earlier not show in the clip. The Drivers argument is not clear.

0:37 Coffee boy speed walks into oncoming traffic. Crossing signal clearly indicates the direction of the biker has the right of way. It would appear they came from behind the other pedestrian quickly which was obscured from the biker, not allowing the biker enough time to react and avoid the collision. Coffee boy seems to admit they were in the wrong by apologizing to the biker.

0:43 Biker berates pedestrian for not looking where they are going and swerves to avoid them.

0:46 Biker avoids a group of people standing in the bike land causing him to ride into the street. The biker notices the pedestrian and warner them verbally to watch out. Pedestrian ignores the warning. This causes the biker to run into a pedestrian who is J walking and not paying attention to the bike lane nor verbal warnings. Pedestrian admits they are in the wrong.

0:49 Hard to tell what is happening here, but it seems there are pedestrians walking against the cross signal in the upper left of the clip. The biker swerves to the left to avoid the first few pedestrians on the right. The black hooded pedestrian stops their predictable motion. The pedestrian stopping prevents the biker from moving forward so the biker start applying their breaks but the distance was too small to come to a safe stop causing a collision between the Biker and the pedestrian.

The biker already had their body weight shifted to the left due to the pedestrians in front of the black hooded pedestrian did not have time to realign and shift their body weight right and swerve to avoid the suddenly stopped pedestrian. The street curve on the left prevented the biker from continuing onto the street. Biker did try to avoid the collision by applies breaks but was too late and collided into the black hooded pedestrian. If the black hooded pedestrian kept walking in a  predicable pattern, which may have cleared the bike lane in time, instead of stopping on the bike lane, this accident could have been avoided. Biker then berates the pedestrian. 

0:57 Biker warns people idling in the street to move out of his lane. Biker is forced to swerve into the street to avoid said people. Pedestrian calls out to biker, Biker berates a pedestrian, pedestrian argues back.

1:04 Two pedestrians do not check before walking into the bike lane. Biker verbally warns the pedestrians. One of the pedestrians and the biker swerver to avoid each other. The other pedestrian seems to be in their own little world. Pedestrian berates biker. Biker does not show indication of slowing down in this clip. 

1:07 People block the bike lane. Biker warns people to gang way. Biker berates the people. 

1:13 Hard to tell what is going on here but it looks like a couple has a close call with the Biker. The Biker does swerve to avoid them. The Biker berates the couple. One of the people in the couple screams.

1:16 Identical to 1:13, if I had a nickel...

1:19 Hard to tell if the pedestrians had the right of way since we can't see the other side of the street. We can say for certain they are not absolutely in the wrong given the adjacent cross walk is red. Biker berates pedestrians and swerves to avoid them.

1:26 Not enough information to know what is going on here. Two New Yorkers get into their daily verbal street battle. If I had a nickel... again?

1:29 Pedestrians J walk in front of the moving biker. Biker has the right of way. Biker slows down, warns, berates, and server to avoid the pedestrians.

1:33 Couple is walking in the bike lane in front of an officer. Biker uses a horn to warn the couple of his presence in the bike lane and applies breaks. Couple jump out of bike lane, biker swerves to avoid them. Biker berates couple.

1:36 Gig biker tries to pass up escooter while there is traffic, the biker, in the opposing lane. Biker slows, swerves to avoid, and berates the gig biker. Gig biker calls out to biker. Biker insults gig biker.

1:41 People walk in the bike lane, avoiding the sidewalk. Biker berates pedestrians for being in his lane as a warning. People jump to sidewalk. It does not seem like the biker slowed down in this clip.

Every year, Starbucks kicks off fall with this overly hyped drink, and every year I’m left disappointed. It’s not revolutionary. It’s just a sickly sweet, cinnamon-y concoction with a weird pumpkin aftertaste that never seems to match the excitement it generates. You’re not suddenly tasting the essence of autumn—you're drinking sugar with a sprinkle of spice, and it tastes more like an artificial flavor factory exploded in your cup. The worst part? It gets a cult following, and if you don't like it, people look at you like you're a monster for daring to question the sacred PSL.

And don't even get me started on the price tag. You're shelling out a small fortune for a drink that tastes like it was designed for people who don’t know how to handle their own sweetness cravings. Starbucks has perfected the art of making something basic seem like the epitome of fall flavor, but really, it’s just sugar and a sprinkle of marketing magic. Every year, people act like it's the second coming of coffee, and I’m over here wondering if I’ve accidentally stepped into a parallel universe where basic, artificially-flavored drinks are considered revolutionary. The marketing genius behind it is something I can’t deny, but the drink itself? Meh.

And don’t give me the ""it’s a comfort drink"" excuse. Comfort food doesn’t need to be cloying to the point of making your teeth hurt. It's time for people to admit that the Pumpkin Spice Latte is less about the taste and more about the aesthetic. The real reason you’re drinking it isn’t because it’s the best coffee option at Starbucks—it’s because you want to feel like you're living your best fall life, surrounded by Instagrammable leaves and sweaters. Let’s all just admit the PSL is a hyped-up pumpkin-flavored sugar bomb, and stop acting like it’s the pinnacle of coffee culture. There, I said it.",5,1735538399.0,starbucks,0,0.78,False

He is ‘39M’ and I am ‘35F’. and last week he brought up trust in a relationship, implying ours. I clarified that we're not in a relationship, and he looked disappointed, saying it's still something special.

For context, we started as coworkers, gradually moving from innocent glances to physical attraction. After a few months of late-night talks and him driving me home, we began grabbing drinks and dinners. During one of our hangouts, he asked if I liked him, and I said yes; he admitted he liked me too. However, nothing physical happened until six months later, we just had make out sessions and we’ve never had s*x due to our busy schedules—he visits his sick mother in West Virginia, and I care for my parents, who lives 2 hrs away from me. 
We talk about it all the time, but could never work our schedules. I eventually got another job and assumed this situation would naturally end. But it didn’t. And we just had sex for the first time, and look forward for the next time. 

Over the four years I've known him, we've s*xted, flirted, and enjoyed dinners together and even coffee runs on weekends. Sometimes we just listen to music in silence, or talk from one topic to another. It wasn’t always physical. While he has joked about marriage in the past /first 2 yrs (“if we were married… questions), I've never considered anything beyond our current arrangement, believing if he wanted more, he would ask.

What is wrong with me?,"I'm so devastated and exhausted with life as it is right now. I know people always say, *""There's no timeline for success, love, or relationships,""* but damn, it's fucking frustrating watching people who have hurt you get their happy ending, find new friends, and leave you behind. I'm not just angry or frustrated anymore—I'm beyond all of that. I have no outlet for these emotions, so I just wait until nighttime to cry in my room by myself.

My parents are actual fucking angels. Two immigrants who came to this country for a better life, leaving behind their jobs, family, friends, and *home* to chase their dreams. They raised me and my little sister so damn well. They pushed us to do better, to reach higher. And here I am, absolutely miserable in a city I hate, stuck because I’m still in college (beating myself up because I should have finished sooner), working a remote job I can’t stand but desperately need to help my parents with bills and cover my own.

I’ve always felt unlovable—too much, too loud, too talkative, not pretty enough. Some of it *has* to be true, right? I mean, I’ve never been in a relationship. Men don’t approach me. No one’s ever asked me out, let alone kissed me. People tell me I’m lucky, that I should enjoy the time to myself, that it’ll happen when it happens. But how fucking humiliating is that when others in your circle—teenagers, adults—have had all their “firsts,” found their person, someone to lean on, to travel with, to share their life with? And here I am, alone. It sucks. It really fucking sucks. I’m not “lucky.” I’m sad. I’m lonely.

And then there’s the so-called “friend” I feel like I wasted six or seven years of my life on. She’s four years younger than me, which might not seem like a big deal, but our mindsets are miles apart. At 22, she’s immature, aimless, and more interested in clubbing, traveling, boyfriends, and drinking than school or anything meaningful. I don’t think all 22-year-olds are like this, but we’re on completely different wavelengths. I can’t rely on her for advice, encouragement, or even a deep conversation. She’s just... fun to hang out with, and that’s it—surface-level.

We met online through mutual interests and eventually met in person. At one point, I thought she might be the only real friend I had. But then she started making plans without me.

It started with a concert we were planning for my birthday. We were supposed to go together, but she accidentally bought the wrong tickets—platinum ones that were 10x more expensive (thanks, Ticketmaster). She apologized. Two months later, she texts me saying she and her sister booked their tickets and there were still some left if I wanted to go. Like, of course I wanted to go? That was the *whole point*! To plan this together and go as a group. But by the time she sent that message, it was too soon to request time off, book flights, or arrange a hotel.

It wasn’t even about the concert anymore—it was the principle. It felt so thoughtless, like I was an afterthought. I never fully told her how I felt because I was scared I’d blow up. My emotions get so intense, and I didn’t want to stir the pot or risk her gaslighting me.

Since then, I’ve distanced myself. I started spending more time with my family, going to concerts on my own. And it feels like she noticed and decided to one-up me. Suddenly, I’m seeing her post about trips to Europe with her other friends (who, I’m sure, talk shit about me), amusement parks we used to visit together, all without inviting me. Then she circles back to invite me for coffee or a movie, where I end up listening to her endless drama. She doesn’t ask how I’m doing, what I’m up to, how my family is. I doubt she even knows what I’m studying. But I know everything about her.

I don’t know what I’m looking for here—advice, kind words, honesty. I just want to be happier. I feel like I give so much to friendships, jobs, school—everything—and never get anything in return. I just want the world to be kind to me for once because it feels like it never has been.",2,1735537447.0,Advice,0,1.0,False
1hpgbj6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hpgbj6,"Bunch of small stuff I didn’t share, till now ofc","An Art/Doodle dump if you will. Yeah I have a bunch of small doodles and bits I just don’t really share but occasionally do create either to just amuse myself or to get an idea to form, or literally just warm ups whatever the reason, I like to draw these up and decided that I liked them enough to share them with you so I’ll go in order with everything.

First we’re starting with Hikari as he is currently the lastest Ultra to be ran through the the headcanon meat grinder, it’s really just a headshot and also a quick semi full body sketch of him without the shawl he usually wears because he’s always really freaking cold and shivering without the thing on (usually a sign of an underlying health issue within an Ultra) and as you can see he is still very well built which y’know good for him, he might have a personal gym somewhere in his catacomb that he calls his headquarters to maintain that frame but we can’t confirm that. Oh yeah fun Hikari fact; he’s also cold to the touch, he’s like a goddamn corpse idk what’s wrong with him but he should seek a medical professional about that.

Second bunch is dedicated to Geed who is still being touched up a bit atm, and yeah he’s a splitting image of his father. Basically the idea with Geed is to make him look and be possibly the most *stable* clone of Belial as apparently there where failed clones before Geed and they’re referred to as his brothers who I’m also designing bc I wanna dabble into the existential horror that comes with not only being a clone of somebody but also knowing that there were ones before you, and I was also thinking of the general instability that I already had with Belial and seeing how that passed down to Geed and his clone brethren with the Ultra Capsules not just being used for obtaining powers but also to just have a stable body as a downside with Belial’s DNA is that it’s also unstable due to the effects Alien Reiblood had on it, hell Belial himself is barely holding it together it’s shocking that he kept on kicking for that long without just physically giving out, truly a marvel of nature… but yeah uh back to Geed, he’s proportionally very similar to his clone father so yeah big stupid head meaning that yes he does have back issues because of the strain it puts on his spine and upper back and neck muscles to keep up, that T-rex posture is literally the most comfortable for him as trying to prop himself up normally will throw off the balance he has with the rest of himself and also caused discomfort, he also has big hulking arms and some gnarly claws, but on the bright side he has a cute little face and I think that’s lovely, even if it’s a little angry looking. It’s not intentional, that’s just his resting expression.

Okay now for the twin cats Leo and Astra, nothing much to say here I was just doodling a potential update to Leo’s design and also just drawing him and Astra in little outfits. I like to think Leo still has a few habits from when he used to live in earth as Gen, one of which is wearing legitimate clothing that isn’t a cape or jewelry of some kind, sometimes he’ll just pull up to a meeting with a pair of sweats and a tank top on and it’s gotten to a point where the rest of the Ultra Brothers just don’t ask questions anymore, because it’s Leo he just does shit for the hell of it, and yes Leo is just getting more exhausted looking with each drawing, poor thang. As for Astra… I mean what can I say ? He’s got that shit on, like seriously the fit is impeccable what else can I say other than that ?

Next doodle is Arc pouring a cup of tea with a tea pot that’s actually his hand that he morphed into a tea pot bc for context I made a headcanon of Rution and by extension, Arc being a type of shapeshifting extraterrestrial made up of energy that isn’t even an actual Ultra nor within the same Order either and rather just a creature that’s mimicking what an Ultra could potentially look like. But yeah this teapot hand does mean he can morph his hand into other objects. Like a hammer, screwdriver, military assault rifle whatever comes to that little brain of his. Now that I think about it I should draw my takes on Arc and Blazar interacting as they’re like a duo that happened now (love that ofc don’t get me wrong).

And the final art is just Jirahs having a coffee because as much as I do love the ultras I also like to show some love to the kaiju as well so I will draw up some little designs for them too, as you can see I made Jirahs a crocodilian type creature with the funny neck frill of a frilled dragon and I think he looks lovely, I mean look at him, he’s just a guy.

Inside, a young man lay alone. He couldn't sleep. Burdened by his restlessness, he stood up to get dressed. He threw on the warmest clothes within his reach and started on a walk. The air was cold that night. With each minute that passed, his body shivered with a greater intensity. After five blocks, he reached the diner. Once a place for birthdays and family reunions, now an escape from his restless mind. Inside, checkered floors reflected a faint yellow glow from the lights above. He walked to the diner's center and seated himself on a stool. In his left hand, a waiter stood across the table, sliding a thick glass into the palms of the young man. Coffee filled the glass to its capacity, admitting a hazelnut aroma that infused the air. Tired and alone, the young man clasped his hands around the warm glass and allowed his mind to roam. He often thought about his insomnia. Why couldn't he sleep? Perhaps it was the influence of his failed relationship and the love he had once known. A love that's reminiscent of the better life he once had and the misery in which he now exists. Perhaps his sister was right after all. ""Love is a lie,"" she used to say, ""it's a ploy to keep us mindlessly distracted from the misery of our human experience. You can try all you want, but eventually, when their touch becomes cold and distant, you end up like mom and dad—left drowning your emptiness in liquor while slowly destroying your life and the family that once loved each other"". Why hadn't she stayed? Why did she leave? He knew that thinking about her wouldn't make it better, but perhaps in some twisted way this was his form of therapy-his way of coping with grief. As for a few precious seconds, his mind would drift back to her, and in that split second, he felt whole again. It never worked, though. No matter how many times he revisited those memories, the past remained the past, and the memories stayed just that—memories. Meanwhile, the present remained cold and lonely. Yet, suddenly, amid his recollection, another man walked in.

The man was old. His face was wrinkled and scattered with lines all over his forehead. His eyes were heavy, as if a child had taken a black crayon and pressed it hard against the old man's face. The old man slowly crept towards the young man and sat beside him. For a while, nothing was said between the two. They sat together quietly, taking occasional sips of coffee to fill the silence. Abruptly, the old man turned his head, looked directly at the young man, paused briefly, and exhaled. ""Can I tell you a story?"" asked the old man. While the young man had come to the diner for solitude, he felt no option but to accept. So begrudgingly, the young man replied, ""I suppose you can."" ""Okay"", said the old man. A long time ago, I graduated high school. I planned to attend college and study engineering. I had always dreamt of working on cars and had intended to follow suit. This all changed when they called me to war. They said it would be a quick war and necessary to preserve democracy. They called us heroes and told us we were protecting the next generation by stopping communism's advance. I fell for this trap and felt it my duty to protect the country I loved. So in September, they sent me, and thousands of others just like me, into the heart of the jungle. We spent our days walking, looking for traces of the enemy. At night, we slept under the jungle's canopy. Week after week, we trekked deeper into the heart of the jungle. It was not a matter of whether we would contact the enemy but how many there'd be. I itched for this day. I longed for the moment another man's fate lay in my hands. I was the judge, jury, and executioner, ready to exercise my authority.

For a while, my patrol and I thought the day would never come. We constantly made jokes about coming home from the war with no real stories to tell. We were a glorified drill team whose only task was to walk miles on end. Unfortunately, this all changed the day we entered Ban Lac. I remember that morning was very ordinary. We awoke, gathered packs, and met with our Sergeant for a briefing on the day's agenda. After our briefing, we followed orders and set out to make a routine sweep of the Ban Lac village. It was a five-mile walk and was likely to take only half the day. For a while, we were making good pace and were expecting to be in the heart of Ban Lac before sundown. With nearly half a mile left, we reached a small rice field. Usually, the procedure was to plow through the reeds, but having already been briefed on the potential for landmines, we sent our bomb squad ahead. Metal detectors in hand, they swept through the fields with elite precision and motioned for us to move forward. We advanced cautiously, mimicking a game of follow-the-leader, meticulously placing our feet in the exact footprints left by the bomb squad as if tracing a path through freshly fallen snow. The air was thick with tension as we inched forward, each step a calculated risk. Suddenly, a loud screech broke the silence. Private Kelley had misplaced his step. Time seemed to slow as we watched him freeze, his eyes wide with realization. Before anyone could react, the air erupted in a deafening roar. The blast threw Kelley skyward, and chaos descended upon us. As dust and debris rained down, the distant crack of gunfire pierced the air. We walked right into an ambush. Training kicked in as we scrambled for cover, the once-peaceful rice field transforming into a battleground. Our jokes about uneventful patrols now seemed like a cruel taunt from fate as we found ourselves in the heart of a war we had only imagined.

Within minutes of the explosion, our patrol retaliated. “Just shoot your damn guns; I don’t give a shit who you’re firing at; fire at anything that moves!” shouted our sergeant. So we did just that, and after about two rounds of non-stop firing, our patrol had decimated what once was a thriving local village. Now a destroyed community, Ban Lac had an eerie silence to it. There were no sounds of people walking in the streets, no shouts of children playing under the afternoon sunshine; the village was utterly lifeless. We all just stood there for a moment with barrels still hot from dozens of rounds. A mix of adrenaline and utter fear coursed through my vines as I slowly turned and looked to our sergeant for orders. His eyes were not returned to mine; they remained fixed on Ban Lac as if he was still looking for something. Suddenly, the silence was interrupted by a deafening shockwave. The smell of Napalm seeped into the air. Smoke stung my eyes. I couldn't tell friends from foe. When I saw movement, I fired. It was instinct. It was wrong. At the other end of my barrel lay a child.

I sprinted after the child and clutched his lifeless body in my arms. His decaying eyes stared into the fabric of my soul, hungry for life and pleading for his mother’s arms. But the wound was too deep, and his body was too weak. The boy had surrendered to the jungle's distant embrace. After that moment, something inside me shattered. I vomited. I wept. But the real horror came later, in the quiet moments. The guilt. The nightmares. The unending grief. Even now, I still feel the pain as I relive my shame with you. Like a scarlet letter carved into the center of my forehead, I wear this burden. It's a constant companion, a shadow that never leaves. I see him in every child's face, and in their eyes, I see his. My life has never been the same and never will be. I have no desire nor capacity for joy. My life is death in motion.

My brother is most laid-back person i ever known. He didn't pursue relationship because he had to take care of me and my sister since we were little. 

Now he is dating this girl M (31F) over a year now. Apparently M worked with my brother and she asked him out. Soon she moved into his apartment and she has been attending family gatherings and such since then.

M is insane. I am not kidding when i call her crazy. M is one of the most intense and controlling person i've ever met. M is so intense and jealous that she is constantly prying him about who commented on his picture, who did he get coffee with and even who is the new girl on his office party picture. She even got upset that he went out to grab a coffee with me and didnt tell her beforehand and kept asking him where did we go and what did we talk about. I am his sister goddammit. I heard she went to his female friends and ""warned"" that he is taken multiple times. 

She has all the access to his social media, phone location even his steam account. She deletes the messages she didnt like and unfollows or blocks people without asking him. Since moving in his apartment is more like her apartment. Everything seems to be in her taste and all he cares in his gaming setup. She keeps pressuring him to get a her name tattoo on his body. He declined so far.

While all this happening my brother just doesnt care. When i talked to him about she might be toxic person, he said even if she was he just cant bring himself to care. About her having access to everything and deleting messages, he says its not a big deal. It is a big deal isn't it?

About she getting obsessive and confronting his friends, he says she might like me that much. 

During christmas he talked about getting married to her. And said he might be proposing around christmas next year. WHAT?

so a while ago i noticed that if it had anything to do with the future, i would be the only one bringing it up. like one time we had talked about our childhoods and i had mentioned that id like to raise my children in a certain region because of what i experienced, he said he agreed but when i started talking about like children and like marriage in the future, he didn’t really have much to say?

a little over a month ago we were talking about diamond rings and i was like you must know im a gold girl, my ring must be gold please because i dont wear any silver, and he kind of rolled his eyes and didnt really like play into the conversation.

the most recent thing was this morning, we were driving back from getting coffee and he was talking about that if he was super duper rich he would put the barista on payroll and his barber on payroll because of how great they are. and so we just started kind of talking about what he would do if he had a ridiculous amount of money and laughing and talking about it and i was going to joke about having something outrageous (idk something stupid like a 3-story closet) so i asked him the question “i would be your wife right” and he was like what does this have to do with what we’re talking about. and the fact that he couldn’t answer yes and instead was like what does this have to do with what we’re talking about really like put me off. so the whole vibe changed in the car and he could sense it and asked me what was wrong. usually i would kind of bite my tongue about things like this but i thought i would let him know how i feel. so i told him, anytime i bring up the future whether is marriage or a wedding or kids you always change the subject or get awkward, and it’s only ever me bringing the subject up. and his response to everything i was saying was mostly like “well the plan is for those things to happen” or “i mean we wouldn’t be together if i didn’t see that happening”. But honestly, im tired of being the only one bringing it up and even though i am not ready to get married right now and honestly wouldnt probably want to be engaged for like another year and a half to two years, it makes me wonder if im wasting my time. 

i do genuinely think he loves me and hes so affectionate and so supportive and reassuring, but this is something that ive noticed for a little while. he’s said things like how he believes we are soulmates and we’re destined to be together but if thats the truth wouldn’t he kind of be excited to talk about our future together? or be excited about growing old together? or at least maybe have him bring up the topic every once in a while? 

and the thing is i’m not even bringing up the topic often AT ALL. (mostly because i feel like a freaking nagging girlfriend bc he never brings it up). but i genuinely don’t know what to do. i don’t want to be naive but i genuinely feel like he loves me so much and he’s genuinely the greatest boyfriend i’ve ever had. i just don’t want to be wasting my time with someone who can’t actually see a future with me.

we recently went to his friend’s wedding and one of his friends literally talked about how in love he was with his girlfriend and how he’s hoping they’re next in the list (to get married). meanwhile, he’s drunk and telling me how much he loves me and how we’re soulmates but i brought up weddings a few days after the wedding and asked him what he liked and didn’t like about it, to which he responded  “that was my first wedding i’ve been to so i can’t really compare it to anything”. which i was like yeah that’s totally fair but then i asked if there was anything he would like for this own wedding and he kind of shrugged it off. now on the other hand i feel like talking about weddings and marriage and even kids in the future is something that mostly girls do, but i also feel like if you’ve been dating someone for over a year at our age and our lives have become so intertwined with kind of an expectation for a future, he would also talk about it? and if it wasn’t that, then why would he tell me we’re soulmates and tell me how much he loves me WITH the actions to prove it? that’s honestly what’s throwing me off.  anyways, i know this was super long, if anyone read all of this thank you so much and any insight/advice is much appreciated. 

TL; DR: my boyfriend gets awkward/avoids future marriage talk but is the perfect boyfriend with the actions and words to match it-",1,1735537026.0,relationship_advice,2,1.0,False
1hpg78d,https://i.redd.it/cs1z77ekax9e1.png,"Monday, December 30, 2024 |Word of The Day ""Memories"" - Moments That Matter: Discovering the Hidden Value of Life's Fleeting Instances • [Click to Expand]","## From Fleeting to Forever: How Memories Shape Our Understanding of Life

There’s a peculiar thing about life—it doesn’t slow down. We move through our days, juggling responsibilities, chasing dreams, and dealing with the mundane, often unaware of the profound value in the moments we’re living. Then, as time marches on, something unexpected happens: these moments we barely noticed transform into memories that tug at our hearts, bringing with them an ache, a smile, or a lesson we didn’t see coming. This idea, beautifully expressed in the words of Theodor Seuss Geisel, better known as Dr. Seuss, encapsulates a universal truth: ""Sometimes you will never know the value of a moment until it becomes a memory.""

The Overlooked Ordinary

Think about the last time you really laughed with someone you love—maybe it was over something silly, like an inside joke that only the two of you would find funny. At the time, it was just a shared laugh, nothing monumental. But later, when you’re apart or when life shifts in ways you didn’t expect, that memory feels different. It feels precious. Why does this happen?

It’s because we’re often too close to the moment to see its full significance. Life’s most valuable experiences rarely announce themselves. They come disguised as the everyday—a lazy Sunday morning, a quick phone call with a friend, or even the sound of your child’s laughter echoing in the house. We take these for granted, assuming there will be countless others. But when the rhythm of life changes, those seemingly small moments crystallize into memories that hold more weight than we ever imagined.

The Power of Retrospection

Memory has a way of sharpening our understanding of what truly matters. When I think about my childhood, I don’t remember every single day, but certain snapshots stand out vividly: my grandfather teaching me how to ride a bike, the scent of my mom’s cooking wafting through the kitchen, the sheer joy of splashing in puddles after a rainstorm. At the time, none of these moments felt particularly remarkable. But looking back, they represent love, learning, and joy—essentials that shaped who I am.

This phenomenon is universal. We’re wired to reflect on our past and assign meaning to it. Sometimes, this retrospection comes with a sense of regret: “Why didn’t I appreciate that more when it was happening?” But often, it also brings gratitude: “I’m so lucky I got to experience that.” Either way, our memories teach us something about ourselves and the life we’re living.

Why We Miss the Value in the Present

Part of the reason we fail to recognize the value of moments as they happen is that we’re distracted. In today’s fast-paced world, our attention is pulled in a thousand directions—emails to answer, social media to scroll through, errands to run. Even when we’re physically present, our minds are often elsewhere.

Another reason is that we tend to focus on the big events. Birthdays, weddings, promotions—these are the milestones we highlight in our calendars and photo albums. But life isn’t just about the highlights; it’s about the in-between moments that stitch everything together. The quiet cup of coffee before the day begins, the spontaneous dance party in the living room, or the simple act of holding someone’s hand—these are the moments that often carry the deepest significance, even if we don’t realize it at the time.

The Gift of Awareness

So, how do we begin to see the value of a moment before it becomes a memory? The answer lies in mindfulness. Being fully present—truly paying attention to the sights, sounds, and feelings of the here and now—can transform the way we experience life.

For instance, I’ve started a small practice that has made a big difference: every evening, I take a moment to think about one thing that brought me joy that day. It could be as simple as a good meal, a kind word from a friend, or the way the sunlight streamed through my window. This habit helps me notice the little things and appreciate them while they’re still happening.

Mindfulness doesn’t mean you’ll never miss a meaningful moment, but it does increase the chances of catching some before they slip away unnoticed. It’s like taking a mental snapshot, allowing you to savor the present even as it’s unfolding.

The Role of Memory in Personal Growth

Another fascinating aspect of memory is its role in personal growth. Our memories aren’t just passive recordings of the past; they’re active contributors to our identity and understanding of the world. When we look back on our lives, the memories we hold onto often shape our values and priorities.

For example, someone who cherishes memories of family dinners might place a high value on connection and togetherness. Someone who remembers struggling through tough times but finding moments of joy might develop resilience and an appreciation for life’s silver linings. In this way, the value of a moment extends beyond its immediate impact—it becomes a building block of who we are.

Cherishing the Fleeting

Perhaps the most profound takeaway from Dr. Seuss’s words is the reminder of life’s impermanence. Moments are fleeting by nature; they can’t be held onto or replayed. This impermanence is bittersweet, but it’s also what makes life beautiful. If every moment lasted forever, would we still treasure it?

One of the most poignant examples of this comes from parenting. As a kindergarten teacher, I see parents dropping off their little ones every day, often frazzled and in a hurry. Yet, years later, those same parents will look back on these chaotic mornings with longing, wishing they could relive them just once more. The irony is that the very moments we find exhausting or stressful in the present are often the ones we miss the most when they’re gone.

Turning Memories into Lessons

Finally, the value of a memory isn’t just in what it brings to our hearts but also in what it teaches us about how to live going forward. Each memory is a whisper, urging us to pay closer attention, to hold our loved ones tighter, to laugh a little louder, and to be a little kinder.

As I reflect on my own life, I think about the moments I overlooked or brushed aside, only to realize later how much they meant. These realizations inspire me to live more intentionally, to embrace life’s messiness and beauty in equal measure.

Conclusion

Life is a collection of moments, many of which we don’t fully understand until they’re behind us. Dr. Seuss’s words remind us to slow down and pay attention, to find beauty in the ordinary, and to appreciate the now before it becomes the past.

So, let’s make a pact with ourselves: to savor the small joys, to be present in the here and now, and to create memories worth cherishing. Because in the end, it’s not the big milestones but the little moments that define our lives and leave the deepest imprint on our hearts.

Inside, a young man lay alone. He couldn't sleep. Burdened by his restlessness, he stood up to get dressed. He threw on the warmest clothes within his reach and started on a walk. The air was cold that night. With each minute that passed, his body shivered with a greater intensity. After five blocks, he reached the diner. Once a place for birthdays and family reunions, now an escape from his restless mind. Inside, checkered floors reflected a faint yellow glow from the lights above. He walked to the diner's center and seated himself on a stool. In his left hand, a waiter stood across the table, sliding a thick glass into the palms of the young man. Coffee filled the glass to its capacity, admitting a hazelnut aroma that infused the air. Tired and alone, the young man clasped his hands around the warm glass and allowed his mind to roam. He often thought about his insomnia. Why couldn't he sleep? Perhaps it was the influence of his failed relationship and the love he had once known. A love that's reminiscent of the better life he once had and the misery in which he now exists. Perhaps his sister was right after all. ""Love is a lie,"" she used to say, ""it's a ploy to keep us mindlessly distracted from the misery of our human experience. You can try all you want, but eventually, when their touch becomes cold and distant, you end up like mom and dad—left drowning your emptiness in liquor while slowly destroying your life and the family that once loved each other"". Why hadn't she stayed? Why did she leave? He knew that thinking about her wouldn't make it better, but perhaps in some twisted way this was his form of therapy-his way of coping with grief. As for a few precious seconds, his mind would drift back to her, and in that split second, he felt whole again. It never worked, though. No matter how many times he revisited those memories, the past remained the past, and the memories stayed just that—memories. Meanwhile, the present remained cold and lonely. Yet, suddenly, amid his recollection, another man walked in.

The man was old. His face was wrinkled and scattered with lines all over his forehead. His eyes were heavy, as if a child had taken a black crayon and pressed it hard against the old man's face. The old man slowly crept towards the young man and sat beside him. For a while, nothing was said between the two. They sat together quietly, taking occasional sips of coffee to fill the silence. Abruptly, the old man turned his head, looked directly at the young man, paused briefly, and exhaled. ""Can I tell you a story?"" asked the old man. While the young man had come to the diner for solitude, he felt no option but to accept. So begrudgingly, the young man replied, ""I suppose you can."" ""Okay"", said the old man. A long time ago, I graduated high school. I planned to attend college and study engineering. I had always dreamt of working on cars and had intended to follow suit. This all changed when they called me to war. They said it would be a quick war and necessary to preserve democracy. They called us heroes and told us we were protecting the next generation by stopping communism's advance. I fell for this trap and felt it my duty to protect the country I loved. So in September, they sent me, and thousands of others just like me, into the heart of the jungle. We spent our days walking, looking for traces of the enemy. At night, we slept under the jungle's canopy. Week after week, we trekked deeper into the heart of the jungle. It was not a matter of whether we would contact the enemy but how many there'd be. I itched for this day. I longed for the moment another man's fate lay in my hands. I was the judge, jury, and executioner, ready to exercise my authority.

For a while, my patrol and I thought the day would never come. We constantly made jokes about coming home from the war with no real stories to tell. We were a glorified drill team whose only task was to walk miles on end. Unfortunately, this all changed the day we entered Ban Lac. I remember that morning was very ordinary. We awoke, gathered packs, and met with our Sergeant for a briefing on the day's agenda. After our briefing, we followed orders and set out to make a routine sweep of the Ban Lac village. It was a five-mile walk and was likely to take only half the day. For a while, we were making good pace and were expecting to be in the heart of Ban Lac before sundown. With nearly half a mile left, we reached a small rice field. Usually, the procedure was to plow through the reeds, but having already been briefed on the potential for landmines, we sent our bomb squad ahead. Metal detectors in hand, they swept through the fields with elite precision and motioned for us to move forward. We advanced cautiously, mimicking a game of follow-the-leader, meticulously placing our feet in the exact footprints left by the bomb squad as if tracing a path through freshly fallen snow. The air was thick with tension as we inched forward, each step a calculated risk. Suddenly, a loud screech broke the silence. Private Kelley had misplaced his step. Time seemed to slow as we watched him freeze, his eyes wide with realization. Before anyone could react, the air erupted in a deafening roar. The blast threw Kelley skyward, and chaos descended upon us. As dust and debris rained down, the distant crack of gunfire pierced the air. We walked right into an ambush. Training kicked in as we scrambled for cover, the once-peaceful rice field transforming into a battleground. Our jokes about uneventful patrols now seemed like a cruel taunt from fate as we found ourselves in the heart of a war we had only imagined.

Within minutes of the explosion, our patrol retaliated. “Just shoot your damn guns; I don’t give a shit who you’re firing at; fire at anything that moves!” shouted our sergeant. So we did just that, and after about two rounds of non-stop firing, our patrol had decimated what once was a thriving local village. Now a destroyed community, Ban Lac had an eerie silence to it. There were no sounds of people walking in the streets, no shouts of children playing under the afternoon sunshine; the village was utterly lifeless. We all just stood there for a moment with barrels still hot from dozens of rounds. A mix of adrenaline and utter fear coursed through my vines as I slowly turned and looked to our sergeant for orders. His eyes were not returned to mine; they remained fixed on Ban Lac as if he was still looking for something. Suddenly, the silence was interrupted by a deafening shockwave. The smell of Napalm seeped into the air. Smoke stung my eyes. I couldn't tell friends from foe. When I saw movement, I fired. It was instinct. It was wrong. At the other end of my barrel lay a child.

I sprinted after the child and clutched his lifeless body in my arms. His decaying eyes stared into the fabric of my soul, hungry for life and pleading for his mother’s arms. But the wound was too deep, and his body was too weak. The boy had surrendered to the jungle's distant embrace. After that moment, something inside me shattered. I vomited. I wept. But the real horror came later, in the quiet moments. The guilt. The nightmares. The unending grief. Even now, I still feel the pain as I relive my shame with you. Like a scarlet letter carved into the center of my forehead, I wear this burden. It's a constant companion, a shadow that never leaves. I see him in every child's face, and in their eyes, I see his. My life has never been the same and never will be. I have no desire nor capacity for joy. My life is death in motion.

1hpg5d2,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1hpg5d2/the_iron_maiden_oc/,The iron maiden (OC),"As I write this, I am still shaking from the events. Though no harm was done, or any attempts of harm were even attempted, something about it shakes me to my very core. It was a cold September noon when I moved into the new place I thought I would live in, known as WoodBorrows. I walked about the streets, occasionally starting a chat up with a few passerby‘s, introducing myself and asking about the houses I could buy here. I was given directions to the home by a rather polite girl named Rosie. She wore a dark brown and yellow striped sundress with brown sandals and a yellow sunhat to match. She told me that a rather old mansion is up for buyers up the hill a few miles from town. I was hoping for a home in solitude, and it sounded nice so I asked the woman where this building is located at, pulling my phone out and opening the maps app so she can pinpoint me the area. And, as I hoped, she marked the directions to the place. And thus I thanked her and went on my way, waving good bye as we parted. The walk was rather long, believably a five to eight minute long walk. Once I reached the place I noticed a rather old woman stood stand at the front yard, next to the street and by a cardboard sign nailed to a tree, the text „FOR SALE“ poorly written on with a sharpie. I walked over to the girl and asked if she was the owner of this establishment, and she answered with a yes. She walked closer to me, and I managed to get a better look at her once she approached. She wore a rather old white dress with a rose vine pattern across it, a jean jacket over the dress like those stereotypical bikers you see who wear their gang leather jackets over their shirt. She had brown old sandals with grayish-white hair, the back of her hair tied into a neat bun. Her face was wrinkly and saggy, her cheeks looked as if gravity was trying to pull them down. I asked her about the price of the house and she said I can stay for free for a week to try it. This was a rather peculiar deal, I thought, and opened my mouth, planning to ask what‘s behind the free week long stay, but closed it when I realized this is a free home. For a week? Why shouldn‘t I accept? Seems like a good deal, and if she does try anything shady the doors should have locks and I can call the police if I hear any shuffling. But then another thought came into my head. „Thank you for letting me stay here for free, ma‘am. But may I ask where you will be staying?“. I asked her in a polite tone of voice. Not wanting to be too rude to what appears to be a kind old lady, despite the shady aura around her deal. She looked up at me, her eyes barely visible under the wrinkles and dangling skin „I know a rather lovely motel near, I will simply stay there“ she said to me. „Will you be ok with waiting for me to walk about and contemplate? It will take but a second“ I asked her. Still attempting my best to be polite, despite not being the most social person out there „oh, it’s no problem, take your time“ she said, waving a dismissive, wrinkly hand with dull rosy pink nail polish on her nails. I smiled and thanked her as I walked off to see how the town is and ask about the mansion. I went into a rather appealing looking cafe nearby and decided to get myself a coffee, since I will need some energy to pack my things into my hopefully permanent house. The inside of the cafe appeared as every cafe from the 90’s. The bottom half of the walls a nice leaf-like green with a yellow-ish white top. It reminded me of the woods, a rather appealing feeling. And the dark oak tree pattern of the seats, stools, tables, and bar stand helped with the nature feel as a calming jazz played through the buildings speakers. The Aroma of coffee, bacon, pancakes, burgers, and other foods could be smelt, despite it being noon and presumably near closing times… If this place does ever close. I sat at the barstand on a stool, looking down as I thought about renting this mansion. It did seem like a rather nice place on the outside, so why shouldn’t I? And the old woman will be far away, and even on the small hypothetical that she did break in what could she do? She’s nothing but a brittle old woman. And judging from how everyone in town acts, I can reasonably assume the crime rate must be low. So it can’t be worth this much worry, right? „Hello, sir. What would you like?“ a waitress asked me, snapping me out of my thoughts when she spoke. I looked up, slightly startled. She lifted a hand up to her mouth, as if trying to mute herself, and quietly giggled. „Sorry, sorry! Did I disturb your thoughts?“ she asked me politely. „No, no, it‘s ok“ I replied back as I looked up at her, meeting her eyes. She had long brown, clean hair with a white-yellow shirt and a apron the same green as the wall. It becoming clear to me that the attire for the workers here are dressed in a similar color pattern of the building. „So… What would you like?“ she asked me, a friendly smile still on her face. It was hard to tell if she was always this friendly or if it was just a very well put up act to keep her job. „Just a simple coffee would be nice“ I answered. Watching as she noted it down on a tiny notebook. „And your name?“ She asked me, looking at me with an unchanging friendly smile plastered on her face. „Edward. Edward Low“ I answered simply, but kindly. And as expected, she noted it down as well on the same note. „Your coffee will be here soon!“ she said as she walked away and disappeared into the kitchen. I gave a small wave goodbye as she walked off, even though her back was turned to me. As I sat there, the only sound being the white noise of people chatting that can‘t be made out, drowned over by the lo fi jazz playing from the speakers, I thought of that house and the old lady. She seems nice, so why shouldn‘t I stay there? My brain kept making different scenarios, most very unlikely, and finding reasons towards why those worry‘s are meaningless. „Here‘s your coffee, sir!“ The waitress said when she returned. Handing me my coffee. I took my coffee and gave a appreciative nod. Smoke came out the tree trunk brown mug, a pine tree symbol on the mug with the text „WoodBorrows Cafe“ on it. The text in red with bubbly text. I drank my coffee, paid, and left out the door, returning back to the cold outside. I looked up to the sky, I must have been in there for a while, since it has now become dark. the only lights in the sky being a single star and the moon glowing like a dull lightbulb in a lamp. Then I remembered the old woman, she must be waiting for me! I quickly ran back to the mansion, not wanting to leave the old woman waiting any longer and worried she might have left, leaving me without a home. To my relief, though, the old lady was still at her cardboard makeshift sign. I walked up to her and asked if I could still stay, and she looked up at me with what seemed to be a rather happy, maybe even relieved, smile on her wrinkly face. Nodding and giving me the keys to the house. I took the keys from her wrinkly hand, being careful as to not hurt her frail body. „Thanks, miss“ I said appreciatively. Yet, she gave no reply as she shuffled off to where I presume the motel she talked of is at. Questionable, but i‘m sure she‘s just worried about being late like I was. I walked off to my car to get my things, waving at people as I passed. I left my car at the entrance of the place, as most visitors do. I took my bags of stuff and carried them with me. The things I packed made the walk more of a struggle, but I was able to push through. Once I got back, I walked onto the path of the mansion, looking up at it and admiring it. The mansion appeared as if it came from the 1700‘s. The walls were a dark oak with the lower bottom part of the walls made of stone bricks, having a balcony with steps rising up to a big double wood door with iron around it, a door knocker ring on it held in the mouths of a stone lion head. I walked up the steps to the door and inserted the key, pushing the door open with a loud creak. As I took a glance around the building. I noticed the light brown planked flooring with a red carpet in the middle of the halls, multiple doors leading to different rooms. The doors and walls a darker tone of wood. The corners made of stone bricks. But the thing that got my attention the most was a figure in the distance. The lights at the end pf the hall was dim, yet I could still make out the figure of what looked human. It looked like they were wearing some old Victorian era dress, one of those dresses that hides your legs and brushes against the ground with each of your steps. Its head looked like a near perfect circle, hair flowing down behind her head and behind the dress. Yet, all was still. Nothing on her body moved. No twitching, no flowing of the dress, her hair didn‘t even move from any blows of the wind. „Hello?“ I called out, albeit a stupid idea for what could possibly be an intruder, but my suspicion of who this is overtook rationality. Yet, despite my words being clear, she stood unmoving. I turned my phone light on and shined it forward, realizing, to my surprise, it was but a statue made of pure iron. I approached, suspicious of what this statue is of, maybe some old princess or queen I never heard of? Learning some history would be rather fun if I must stay in this rather large mansion, as if this place isn‘t a whole history lesson of its own. As I approached I started to notice more features. The body was definitely based off an old dress from the 1700‘s, it even had the details of the multiple layers being faintly noticeable in riffles at the bottom of the metallic dress body. And atop her head was what seemed to be a tiara. Looked like a regular tiara made of the same iron, but, oddly enough, a crystal laid embedded in the middle of the tiara. Showing no signs of falling out any time soon, I left it alone. Not wanting to risk damaging anything here. No reason to make my free stay costly, yes? The statues face had a blank, unreadable expression. Her eyes were vacant and empty, as if the inside of her was hollow. The same for the mouth, the eyes and mouth looking like the slits you see in a mail slot on a door, as if you were meant to be able to use the head like a weird helmet. The more I inspected the statue, I noticed something odd. A weird slit going down the middle of the front of her body and stopping at the back by hinges. I inspected it and realized that it is a door of sorts. I tested my luck and tried opening it. My attempts were successful. As the metallic door groaned open and her face split in two with her body, my eyes widened in awe and shock when I realized the statue is not a statue, but an old iron maiden. The inside was filled with multiple spikes for stabbing the poor man who went into this contraption in every angle imaginable. Explains the slits for the eye and mouth, so you can watch the life fade from the poor, poor victims eyes. Out of fear, I backed away. This whole house seemed old so maybe it was just left behind, I thought as I began to walk off to look for my bedroom. But I froze when I heard the groan of rusty iron, turning around to see the doors of the iron maiden shutting on their own. Despite it making little sense, I just foolishly assumed the wind pushed the door shut and tried my best to shrug it off. Yet the irrational worries began to come back to my mind, just like the ones before I took my free stay in this mansion. But something new followed this time, fears. I walked in a faster pace around the mansion as I searched for a bedroom. Finally finding one that was a rather clean room, I quickly ran in and locked the door. As I looked around, the bedroom looked as you would expect. Red fancy curtains laid over the window and bed frame, a golden outlining around the curtains. There was also a desk with a chair and an oil lamp shut off, all old fashioned, as one has come to expect from such a place. I quickly closed the curtains to the window and hopped into bed, trying to close my eyes and fall asleep. Having fallen asleep successfully for a few hours until I hear shuffling from the other side of the wall. I tried ignoring it, but the thud of something bumping and glass breaking awoke me from my slumber, making me hop out of bed in a cold sweat. I looked to the wall, not able to see anything, meaning it couldn’t have been from my room. I opened my door curiously, peaking out to see nothing there. I cautiously walked towards the origin of the crash, making sure I didn‘t make a peep of a sound. Even doing my best to avoid applying any pressure to the boards of the ground so they don‘t creak. As I turned the corner, my eyes widened in fear and my mouth dried. In the kitchen area, next to a broken plate, stood the iron maiden. It moved. It moved from its original spot in the house. In a panic I ran through the halls, the halls like a maze as I looked for the exit. Out of fear of never leaving and my mind under some weird belief I have been put into a limbo with no door, I took my chance with jumping through the window. I hit the ground hard, but adrenaline fueled me as I rushed to my feet and sprint out of that cursed place. The woman who told me about the mansion saw me run and tried to call out to me, yet I did not care. I ran and got into my car parked near the entrance. Driving past the speed limit without a care for the law, for my life is more important. It was only when I got home that I remembered I left my belongings there. But it wasn‘t important. I don‘t know why the iron maiden moved. I don‘t know what it was doing, and yet I don‘t care. I will never go back there. Never. The only things I have of it are memories and these cursed keys",2,1735536816.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

Design Ideas for Your Small Barndominium Living Space
-----------------------------------------------------

Living in a small barndominium offers unique charm and flexibility in design, allowing you to create a cozy and functional space. If you’re considering a small barndominium for sale, or you already have one, implementing thoughtful design ideas can turn your living space into a stylish retreat. Here are some creative concepts that you can consider to make the most of your small barndominium.

### Open Floor Plan for Maximum Space

One of the key benefits of a barndominium is its open floor plan. Embrace this layout by minimizing walls to create a seamless flow between your living areas. This not only makes the space feel larger but also enhances natural light throughout the home. Use rugs to define different areas, such as the living room, dining space, and kitchen, while maintaining an open ambiance.

### Smart Storage Solutions

In a small barndominium, efficient storage is crucial. Here are some clever ideas:

- **Under-Bed Storage:** Utilize the space under your bed for boxes or drawers to store seasonal items or extra blankets.
- **Built-In Shelves:** Adding shelves can create vertical storage that won’t take up floor space and can serve as a decorative element.
- **Multi-Functional Furniture:** Invest in furniture pieces that serve multiple purposes, such as ottomans that open up for storage or coffee tables with hidden compartments.

### Cozy, Functional Kitchen Design

The kitchen is often the heart of the home, even in a small barndominium. Using space wisely can make cooking and entertaining a delight. Here are practical tips:

- **Compact Appliances:** Consider downsizing to smaller, energy-efficient appliances that fit your kitchen layout.
- **Open Shelving:** Instead of bulky cabinets, use open shelves to display beautiful dishes and cookbooks, keeping essentials within reach.
- **Island Installation:** If space allows, a small island can serve as additional prep space and a place for guests to gather.

### Embrace Natural Light

Letting in natural light can transform your small barndominium living space into a welcoming oasis. Here are some ways to enhance sunlight in your home:

- **Large Windows:** If you’re building or renovating, consider large or strategically placed windows to invite natural light.
- **Mirrors:** Hang mirrors on walls to reflect light, making your space feel bigger and brighter.
- **Light Colors:** Use a light color palette for your walls and furniture, which will help amplify the light.

### Creating Outdoor Connections

Small barndominiums often come with outdoor spaces that can be just as inviting as indoors. Enhance this connection by:

- **Expanding Decks:** If you have the space, build a small deck or patio for grace and usability.
- **Outdoor Entertainment:** Set up an outdoor dining area or a fire pit to extend your living space into the open air.
- **Landscaping:** Incorporate pleasant landscaping with native plants for a low-maintenance and beautiful aesthetic that draws you outside.

### Personal Touches and Decor

Adding personal decor items can make your small barndominium truly feel like home. Consider the following:

- **Local Artwork:** Decorate walls with pieces from local artists that resonate with you and tell a story.
- **Textured Fabrics:** Introduce textiles like woven throws, pillows, and area rugs to add warmth and comfort.
- **Vintage Finds:** Incorporate vintage or rustic elements that match the barndominium’s character and history.

By implementing these design ideas in your small barndominium, you can create a beautiful and functional living space that reflects your personality. Embrace the charm of simplified living while ensuring that every corner of your home serves a purpose. Whether you’re looking for a small barndominium for sale or enhance your existing one, these tips will undoubtedly help you maximize your space and elevate your lifestyle.

At first it did not bother me because I had so much going on for me (school mostly) and I was so sure that at some point I'd meet someone. 

This year was particularly a hard one for me because in addition to my personal struggles, I witnessed a lot of friends get married, have kids, start a new relationship and find love. I was super stoked for them but I have noticed that friends tend to drift apart when they start new romantic relationships. All of these made me realize how empty my life really is and it's starting to affect me. I just wish I had my own person.

I'm surrounded by people who did as little as walk on the street, went to a coffee shop or attended some party and then boom! they met the one for them. Why hasn't the same happened for me?
For as long as I can remember guys have always approached me but for some reason they're never the type of guys I'm interested in. On the other hand, the guys that I find myself being attracted to don't feel the same way or there's always some issue that makes it impossible for things to move to the next level beyond just platonic friendship. 

I adore the concept of love, I can write epistles on the subject, that's how much I love LOVE, but sadly it has and still continues to elude me.

My brother is most laid-back person i ever known. He didn't pursue relationship because he had to take care of me and my sister since we were little. 

Now he is dating this girl M (26F) over a year now. Apparently M worked with my brother and she asked him out. Soon she moved into his apartment and she has been attending family gatherings and such since then.

M is insane. I am not kidding when i call her crazy. M is one of the most intense and controlling person i've ever met. M is so intense and jealous that she is constantly prying him about who commented on his picture, who did he get coffee with and even who is the new girl on his office party picture. She even got upset that he went out to grab a coffee with me and didnt tell her beforehand and kept asking him where did we go and what did we talk about. I am his sister goddammit. I heard she went to his female friends and ""warned"" that he is taken multiple times. 

She has all the access to his social media, phone location even his steam account. She deletes the messages she didnt like and unfollows or blocks people without asking him. Since moving in his apartment is more like her apartment. Everything seems to be in her taste and all he cares in his gaming setup. She keeps pressuring him to get a her name tattoo on his body. He declined so far.

While all this happening my brother just doesnt care. When i talked to him about she might be toxic person, he said even if she was he just cant bring himself to care. About her having access to everything and deleting messages, he says its not a big deal. It is a big deal isn't it?

About she getting obsessive and confronting his friends, he says she might like me that much. 

During christmas he talked about getting married to her. And said he might be proposing around christmas next year. WHAT?

Am i crazy one or my brother lost his mind? This cant be normal behavior right? Is there anyway to help him see more rational?",3,1735536445.0,AskMenAdvice,7,1.0,False
1hpg1fr,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1hpg1fr/aitah_for_giving_my_cousin_a_wedding_gift_that/,"AITAH for giving my cousin a wedding gift that turned out to be a family heirloom tied to a secret inheritance, causing a massive family feud and revealing long-buried secrets. AITA?","I, Olivia (32F), never thought I'd be writing one of these posts, but here I am. Buckle up, because this is a wild ride.



My cousin Jordan (29F) was getting married to her long-time partner, Alex (31M). I was thrilled to be invited, especially since our family has had its share of drama over the years. My partner Chris (34M) and I decided to go all out on a wedding gift. We found this beautiful antique silver tea set at an estate sale. It was pricey, but we thought it would be perfect.



The wedding was a lavish affair at a vineyard. Everything was going smoothly until the gift-opening ceremony after the reception. When Jordan (29F) unwrapped our gift, her face went pale. Alex (31M) looked confused, and suddenly the atmosphere in the room changed.



It turns out, the tea set belonged to our great-grandmother, Esther. What I didn't know was that it was supposed to be passed down to the first granddaughter to get married in our generation. That should have been my older sister, Taylor (35F), but she eloped last year without telling anyone.



Aunt Morgan (55F) started yelling that I had stolen the family heirloom. Uncle Jamie (57M) tried to calm her down, but then my estranged parent, Riley (60F), chimed in saying that I had no right to the tea set anyway since I was ""barely part of the family.""



Things quickly spiraled out of control. My best friend, Drew (33F), tried to defend me, saying I couldn't have known about the tea set's significance. But then my sibling, Sam (30M), revealed that there was more to the story.



Apparently, great-grandmother Esther had left a secret inheritance tied to the tea set. Whoever possessed it on their wedding day would inherit a substantial sum of money and a property in the countryside. This information had been kept from me and Chris (34M) because of some long-standing family feud I wasn't even aware of.



Jordan (29F) and Alex (31M) were caught in the middle, unsure whether to keep the gift or return it. The family lawyer, Casey (45F), who happened to be at the wedding, advised them not to make any hasty decisions.



Over the next few weeks, the situation only got worse. Family members started taking sides. Taylor (35F) was furious with me for ""stealing"" her inheritance, even though she had chosen to elope. Sam (30M) felt guilty for revealing the secret but also resented being kept in the dark for so long.



Aunt Morgan (55F) and Uncle Jamie (57M) stopped speaking to my parents, blaming them for the whole mess. Riley (60F) used this opportunity to try and reconnect with me, which only added to the stress.



Chris (34M) and I were overwhelmed. We had no idea our well-intentioned gift would cause such chaos. We offered to buy back the tea set and give it to Taylor (35F), but she refused, saying it was ""tainted"" now.



Jordan (29F) and Alex (31M) postponed their honeymoon to deal with the family drama. They were torn between keeping a valuable family heirloom and maintaining peace in the family.



To make matters worse, my cousin Ethan (27M) decided to take sides with Taylor (35F), claiming that I had always been the family troublemaker. This hurt deeply, as Ethan (27M) and I had been close growing up. His wife, Sophia (26F), tried to mediate, but it only led to arguments between them.



Meanwhile, my other aunt, Lydia (52F), who had always been the peacemaker in the family, attempted to organize a family meeting to sort things out. However, her efforts were thwarted when Uncle Jamie (57M) refused to attend if Riley (60F) was going to be there.



The tension was palpable, and it felt like our once-close family was being torn apart at the seams. I couldn't help but feel responsible, even though I had no idea about the tea set's significance.



Chris (34M) suggested we seek advice from a family therapist, Dr. Martinez (40F), who specialized in inheritance disputes. We thought it might help to have an unbiased professional perspective. However, when we proposed this idea to the family, it was met with mixed reactions. Some, like Sam (30M) and Drew (33F), thought it was a great idea. Others, particularly Aunt Morgan (55F) and Taylor (35F), saw it as an attempt to manipulate the situation in our favor.



As if the family drama wasn't enough, rumors started circulating in our small town. My colleague, Rachel (36F), mentioned overhearing gossip at the local cafe about our family's ""cursed inheritance."" This added another layer of stress, as we now had to deal with curious neighbors and acquaintances prying into our private affairs.



Jordan (29F) and Alex (31M) were feeling increasingly guilty about their role in the situation. They considered selling the tea set and splitting the proceeds among the family, but Casey (45F) advised against it, saying it could have legal implications regarding the inheritance.



The whole situation was taking a toll on everyone's mental health. I noticed Sam (30M) withdrawing from social activities, and Taylor (35F) had started stress-eating. Even the usually unflappable Uncle Jamie (57M) was showing signs of strain, snapping at people over minor issues.



Things came to a head at a family gathering a month after the wedding. Everyone was there, tensions running high. I tried to explain my side of the story, but voices were raised, accusations flew, and old grievances were dredged up.



In the heat of the moment, Drew (33F) revealed that she had overheard Riley (60F) and Casey (45F) discussing the inheritance years ago. They had apparently been planning to manipulate who got the tea set to control the family fortune.



This revelation stunned everyone into silence. Riley (60F) stormed out, Casey (45F) looked uncomfortable, and the rest of us were left to process this new information.



The aftermath of this revelation was chaotic. Ethan (27M) and Sophia (26F) got into a heated argument right there in front of everyone, with Sophia (26F) defending Riley (60F) and Ethan (27M) feeling betrayed. Aunt Lydia (52F) broke down in tears, saying she couldn't bear to see her family fall apart like this. Even Sam (30M), who had been trying to stay neutral, lost his cool and started shouting at Casey (45F) for her role in the deception.



In the weeks that followed, our family went through a painful but necessary period of reflection and reconciliation. Jordan (29F) and Alex (31M) decided to put the tea set and the inheritance in a trust for future generations, taking the immediate pressure off. This decision was met with mixed reactions, but most agreed it was a fair compromise.



Taylor (35F) and I had a long, tearful conversation about our relationship and the years of misunderstandings between us. It wasn't easy, but we both realized how much we had missed each other's presence in our lives.



Sam (30M) apologized for keeping secrets and promised to be more open in the future. He also took it upon himself to reach out to Ethan (27M), trying to mend the rift that had formed between us cousins.



Aunt Morgan (55F) and Uncle Jamie (57M) started family therapy sessions to work through their issues. It was a slow process, but gradually, they began to communicate more effectively.



Riley (60F) reached out to make amends, and while I'm cautious, I'm open to rebuilding our relationship slowly. We've had a few coffee meetings, each one less awkward than the last.



Chris (34M) has been my rock through all of this, reminding me that our intentions were good and that we couldn't have foreseen the consequences of our gift. He's even started organizing monthly game nights, inviting different family members each time in an attempt to rebuild our relationships in a casual, fun setting.



Dr. Martinez (40F) has been working with us as a family, helping us navigate the complex emotions and long-standing issues that this incident brought to the surface. It's been challenging, but we're slowly making progress.



Rachel (36F) has been supportive at work, running interference when nosy colleagues try to pry into my family situation. Her kindness has been a bright spot in this difficult time.



As for Casey (45F), she's facing an ethics review at her law firm due to her involvement in the inheritance scheme. It's a difficult situation, but most of the family agrees that there need to be consequences for her actions.



So, Reddit, after all this drama, AITA for unknowingly giving a gift that revealed a secret inheritance and caused a family feud? I'm still processing everything that happened, and I could use some outside perspective. The tea set that was meant to be a simple wedding gift has turned our lives upside down, exposing long-buried secrets and forcing us to confront issues we've avoided for years. While it's been incredibly difficult, part of me wonders if this upheaval was necessary for our family to heal and move forward. But the guilt of being the one who inadvertently caused all this chaos is hard to shake.",0,1735536429.0,AITAH,8,0.44,False

1hpg0jr,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hpg0jr,Gaggia Classic or Lelit Anna PID [sub $1000 AUD],"Gaggia Classic or Lelit Anna PID

Equipping the kitchen in my new home, and a coffee machine is high on the list.

I worked as a barista many years ago, and have been missing the therapeutic effect steaming milk and making a good flat white had on me.

Truthfully though, aside from turning on the machine itself at the cafe, I never had to tinker with temp or pressure. Reading about PID mods, changing pressure springs etc is… new. 

I’m torn between the Gaggia Classic and the Lelit Anna. I can get the Lelit Anna for $870 or the Gaggia for $721/792, close enough that price is not a deciding factor here. 

Which would you get and why, please?

I understand the temp/pressure gauge on the Anna is a plus. If I got the Gaggia, perhaps I’d add a PID in time, but would deal with temp surfing initially. The Gaggia would come out costing more than the Anna in that case, though. So, is there anything else I should consider when deciding between the two? Build quality? Longevity? Servicing/maintenance costs? 

I don’t think the 57mm portafilter for the Anna bothers me at all, I doubt I’ll upgrade beyond either of these machines for a very very long time, so whatever I buy in accessories will stay put with the machine.

I don’t think the E24 Gaggia is available in Australia, although the supplier assures me the boiler flaking coating issue has been resolved on the model they’re selling. The store seems to have two different model numbers of the Gaggia (links to follow in comments), but the descriptions are exactly the same. If anyone can decipher the difference, please let me know. 

Similarly with the Anna, I don’t know if this is the Anna 1 or 2. The model code from the store I’d buy it from (thanks to a friend with staff discount, hence the minimal price difference) is different than the ones I’ve seen elsewhere (eg PL41TEMD) but the description mentions PID, so I’m guessing it’s the same? Am I missing something? Does anyone know what PPS means?

1hpfzxq,https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/1hpfzxq/ive_been_alone_for_years_and_the_anxiety_is/,I've been alone for years and the anxiety is getting terrible ,"I'm 22yo male. I've been alone since I was 15 basically. Back in school, after the 7th grade, I started moving away from others, making it impossible to create friendship. Now as an adult, whenever I start a new job, I can never create significant bonds with colleagues too. And… I feel like every place I start, there will be someone who will want to approach me. At least one person will want to stay with me, but I always keep them far away, so when they notice, they give up on me (rightfully so). I don't know why I do that. It doesn't even make sense. Maybe my standards for friends are too high? That's terrible. I totally forgot what having spontaneous friendship feels like and I guess I don't know how to normally treat people anymore. In terms of family, I have my mother who I love more than anyone else. But… I feel like we are not “friends”. We don't really do stuff together and we never speak of emotions truly. It's like we're a mystery for each other. I feel terrible for that and I was always thankful that my sister (27) has a better bond with her, because they act like true friends. They watch movies together, they shop together and they always laugh around the house when my sister is home. I feel like my sister fulfills a space that I don't. That's another problem. Although my sister still lives with us, she is dating someone now and spends almost every day in his house, so my mother, when she's at home and not working, keeps doing her things and I don't fulfill that blank space that my sister did and does when she's around (which is each time more rare). I don't see her smiling and laughing around. I don't watch shows with her… And although I feel terrible about it, it just… wouldn't feel natural because, as I said, it feels like we are family (and I love her so much) but not friends… When it comes to my sister, it's also complicated. I don't even remember when we stopped talking. It's surely been more than 5 years. Living in the same home and not talking whatsoever. We pretend we don't exist for each other. It's been this way for years. Walking past each other, sharing the same rooms and… no talk. Not even a stare that says “I reckon your existence”. For a while, I thought that was ok, but now it feels surreal. At first I thought I was cutting her off because I didn't feel very good about her, but now… I don't even remember what happened. And my dad… Well, he's an alcoholic. Has been this way since my first memories. My parents divorced very early in my life and I have confused memories about it. I only remember him being aggressive towards my mother and extremely controlling. Though he was never directly aggressive towards me and my sister, and actually seemed to care for us in his twisted ways, I grew to despise him and avoid him whenever possible. I think at first it was mostly because of how I saw him treat my mother. Now, it's a mixture of that and of everything that came after with his drinking problems, as we went through much trouble and embarrassment related to that. Nowadays, he lives in the house above ours. That's very confusing. My parents are divorced. They don't interact much anymore, but they live in the same terrain and share bills. It's really confusing, actually… My dad's drinking problem has gotten worse with years and he keeps drinking for weeks and screaming all day long in his house like he's delusional. I'm sure he has depression as he has a diagnosis and he takes (or is supposed to take) medicine. One day I went up to his house to do something I don't remember and he was setting up a rope on the ceiling… Well… I guess you understand. It got very uncomfortable and we never talked about it. He only said “I'm not going to that…” I think my mother talked to him. That's kind of what the point is. I never talk about my emotions with anyone. I got tired of convincing myself that that is normal. I can't open up and I have no one to do so. Last “friend” I had was in my last job at a drugstore that I left two months ago. She was caring and she always vented to me. She trusted me. When I left, she wanted us to remain friends and… I took no effort whatsoever in keeping up. I think I never allowed myself to see her as a friend as she saw me to begin with… Part of me feels like I would be bothering her with messages now, just like I felt I bothered her in person. I feel like I don't have the right to simply become a part of her life. I'm fooling myself. Friendship should be something natural and I'm turning it into a big scheme. Something full of rules. You either feel good around someone or not, then you simply have good spontaneous moments together, and I seem to have lost the sensibility to understand that. She occasionally sends a message, but I don't develop. I keep convincing myself that when she does again, I will ask to go out to do something friends do. Maybe I should take the initiative, text first and ask her out, but it would feel like I'd be bothering her so much. Well… turns out I am alone again. I left my job (that I honestly didn't like) to work for myself as a delivery boy in my motorcycle because the freedom of the road feels suiting to me. Maybe being in constant movement keeps my mind busy, I don't know… But just two days after I left, I was in an accident and now my bike is being fixed by insurance and will only be ready after January 15th. So I'm home all day. I do nothing but feel miserable. My mother goes to work and returns. I go to her to say hello. Offer her a cup of coffee. Bring her her favorite snack from the market and… That's it. I'm in my room again and she's minding her business. I don't even know what the point of this text is. Am I asking for help? What for? Maybe I want to learn how to retrieve the social spontaneity that I lost. I want to stop overthinking. I was always proud of being alone like it was special and meant I was “smart”. Just how foolish and unsmart that is… I now see. I just don't know. How to make friends? Should I seek psychological help? That seems surreal to me. I don't even know how that works. Well… Thanks for reading me.

They are the last of the immediate family to leave (all of the kids have left including myself) but are really struggling with the transition phase. They are feeling like they have wasted their lives away in a cult and have feelings of embarrassment and regret for pretty much everything involving the church. I’ve tried to point them to therapy but my father refuses to go, and I imagine if he tried it out he wouldn’t take it seriously anyways. 

They officially left a couple of weeks ago and have very quickly changed their lifestyle, trying alcohol, buying a coffee machine, etc. which is good but I’m kind of worried about them trying to change everything at once as this can be a pretty crazy shock to the system after 50 years of church programming and shame. 

Do any of you guys have tips for how I can support them and guide them through this process?

One of my hard rules with this hobby is that If it doesn't look good, I won't simply won't consider it for purchase.

I recently got my first ""big boy"" coffee scale, an Acaia Lunar. It's a shiny, sleek black square box, and I really love the design. It was between the Lunar and the Fellow Tally. I chose Lunar for three reasons: Bluetooth connectivity to the Filtru app (which I use for every brew), a flow rate indicator that also shows in real-time during brewing on both the scale and on the Filtru app and a cheaper price point than the Fellow Tally. In other words, compared to the Tally, the Pearl had a lot more useful features, for slightly less of a cost. The tally's biggest selling point: brew assist, is something the Filtru app already does for you, effectively nullifying the Tally's biggest feature.

The Lunar comes with a protective film and having been a few weeks of ownership, I can see why now. My scale is completely scratched up with normal use. It also smudges considerably easily, due to the sheen. The heat pad they give you is a super ugly grey pad that ruins the entire aesthetic of the scale. The flow rate indicator also seems like a gimmick because I haven't noticed a difference in my brews or it could be that I simply because the FIltru app and the recipe that you use, dictate the flow rate for you.

I'm curious, for those of you who chose the Fellow Tally scale over the Acaia Pearl, knowing that you would not have Bluetooth connectivity to coffee apps or a flow rate indicator, what were the main reasons why?",1,1735535767.0,pourover,2,1.0,False

📍The Pad Co-Living, Banilad High Streets, Gov. M. Cuenco Ave., Cebu City\
🕕 8AM - 9PM

What we ordered:\
☕️ Filter: Alexander Vargas Pink Bourbon (₱260)\
The roaster for this set of beans is [Code Black Coffee](https://codeblackcoffee.com.au/) from Australia. The coffee was brewed with a (very cute!) Hario Switch dripper, and it was very fun to see the hybrid brewer in action (more in the Services section here later). The tasting notes included cooked apple, citrus, brown sugar and spice, and we could taste the cooked apple and sugar in it. The barista actually gave us two cups to taste the coffee from: a Fellow Monty Cup (I think) and a Loveramics Urban Twisted Cup. The barista pointed out that if you drink from the Loveramics cup, it would be more acidic and (gasp!) I shit you not, it was indeed more citric (and a bit harsher, though). We chose to drink from the Fellow cup since the coffee did not taste that harsh and you can taste the apple and sugar. Even my best friend who did not like coffee said that this brew was very good. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

☕️ Blueberry Cheesecake Holiday Drink (₱180): This is one of their Seasonal concoctions which my best friend ordered because she did not want to have a lot of coffee. It's essentially a blueberry latte with the blueberry puree at the bottom, mixed with milk and topped with cheesecake foam. Mix it well so that you can taste all of the elements together. I liked it overall, but do take note that this is on the sweeter side of the flavor spectrum. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

I believe Goldough, an online bakeshop, supplies their desserts (do give them a try!). They also supply Third Wave Coffee, IIRC.

🍰Coconut Mochiko (₱135) - a chewy coconut cake bar. The chewy texture is I think the mochiko part, and sandwiches this coconut filling and topped with toasted desiccated coconut. I like the chewy texture with the hints of desiccated coconut, and it was sweet without being overly so. It's just a bit more heavy than I'm used to so we weren't able to finish it entirely. ⭐️⭐️⭐️

🍰 Camote Cake (₱135) - layers of a biscuit base, camote filling, coated in what I think is white chocolate sauce (?) and topped with cherry (?) skin. It's the camote and white sauce that go together well, and the other flavors kind of trail away. It's not very chewy or heavy. Will definitely have it again the next time we come back. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

Other things to rate:
🖊️ Price range: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ filter coffee was slightly pricier than the starting price of most coffee shops I've reviewed (with the exception of Dosage):\
Capu (₱220)\
Commonly Uncommon (₱180-₱600)\
Tightrope (₱230-₱380)\ 
Dosage (₱280-₱650 + SC)\

Seasonal coffee was priced on the Starbucks range (₱180-₱200). Food is more affordable as they priced lower than other shops that I've reviewed so far. Overall a reasonable price range.

🖊️coffee gears: ⭐️⭐️⭐️ Hario V60 and Switch drippers, EKG Stagg kettle, a San Remo espresso machine plus various specialty coffee cups. Pretty much what's expected in a standard coffee shop. While I've seen more impressive coffee gears, this coffee shop uses their gears well without the fanfare (and really that's all you need when running a shop)\ 
🖊️ Service: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ One thing I liked about their barista was that he was very knowledgeable and walked you through the process of making the filter coffee. He engaged in conversation when it came to the brew, explained the beans, clocked on the drawdown time and helped us in enjoying the coffee experience better. Attentive and interactive when it came to brewing, then left you alone to enjoy your food with your company. That be the kind of service I like.\  
🖊️ Aesthetic/Instagrammability: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ the color branding is sunshine yellow and jet black with wood accents. Honestly reminds of the color palette of 32 Umber, but the design of the place is less industrial and more novel with its wall doodles.\
🖊️the location: very accessible and near the Main road. The compound has parking, and it's right across Your Daily Go, a few booths from Hosaku and SB KMart. Also very near other establishments like 88th Avenue, Crossroads and Europe. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

Verdict: Came for the coffee, stayed for the coffee. Will also come back for the coffee. ~~Ganahan kos ilang kape haha~~

By Kevin J. Guhl

Omaha, Nebraska is home to many famous animals. There was the Necktie Goat, who hung around a once-vacant lot on 25th Avenue and Dodge. He didn't earn his name because he wore a necktie, sadly, but because any unwary businessman who stopped to pet him might suddenly find their tie bitten half-off and swallowed. Then there was Jackie the squirrel, who lived in an old icebox at a restaurant on North Street and quite enjoyed consuming coffee and pie. But neither was as notable as Teddy, feline overlord of North Omaha's 79-acre Miller Park and golf course.

Teddy's antics were elegantly explained in this article from the June 24, 1926 edition of Omaha's Morning World Herald:

***'Teddy' Has Catty Ways***

***Enforces Miller Park Edict Against Dogs; Makes Life Miserable for Golfers.***

*""S-s-fitz!"" A yelp. A dog streaking down the fairway. A flash of grey in pursuit. ""Teddy,"" the terror of Miller Park, is in action.*

*""Teddy"" is a large, tiger-type tomcat, jointly owned but not controlled by Bernice and Beryl Melvin, 15-year-old twin daughters of Mr. and Mrs. Alex Melvin, caretakers of the Miller Park pavilion.*

*Born on Saint Patrick's Day in the morning, he has developed a natural fighting instinct to a remarkable degree of efficiency, in the one short, eventful year it has been his joy to live.*

*And dogs, it seems, are ""Teddy's"" particular ""meat."" It is not known that ""Teddy"" can read. But he does his part in carrying out the orders which are printed on signs here and there in the park. ""No dogs allowed."" Few tarry, nor linger long when ""Teddy"" is around. He has ""made 'Christians' out of all the pups on the place,"" as one of the youngsters at the pavilion put it.*

*""Teddy"" is playful, too. And golf is his favorite sport. He likes to hide in waiting near the first tee, and many a good drive has been temporarily upset by his meteor-like appearance. At the critical moment, he loves to dash forth and ""slap"" the ball with his paw. If the golfer shouts a protest, ""Teddy"" humps his back, gives vent to a ""Felix"" grin, and is away.*

*""Teddy"" has his quiet moments, however. Salmon has a soothing effect, as has raw hamburger and ice cream. But the park, with its numerous attractive possibilities, calls to him, and during the day and sometimes during the night, it is to be regretted, ""Teddy"" runs rampant. He's a great favorite nevertheless.*

[Teddy cartoon from the Omaha Sunday News, July 4, 1926.](https://preview.redd.it/4vqae8156x9e1.png?width=322&format=png&auto=webp&s=b95ef2166486fec847fb7476133e28c150d7cc96)

The Omaha Sunday News of July 4, 1926 declared that Teddy the golf cat and his fellow ""semi-wild pets,"" Jackie the squirrel and the Necktie Goat, were ""better known than some humans."" Indeed, another adventure of the ""grey, oversized rowdy tom-cat"" was reported just four days later in the Evening World-Herald. 

""Teddy has taken up water sports,"" the article announced. ""Several mornings ago, a park policeman and the park golf starter, walking along the edge of the lake, saw a drenched, blinking cat standing in the water up to his chin. They fished him out and found him to be Teddy. One carefully wiped the water from his eyes while the other consoled 'Poor Teddy' with soft words and kind strokes. After a moment of this molly-coddling, however, Teddy rebelled. A small fish jumped from the water a few feet from shore, and Teddy, seeing an opening, leaped from the arms of his Samaritan into the lake, emerging with a succulent carp, and scampered to safety.""

2. 6x4m pool with pump, 2 lights and heater
3. A BYD Sealion 6 Premium (PHEV).

1. Do I need an engineer to begin with?
2. How do I get the right electrical engineer to ensure the home can power all appliances safely and economically?
3. I want to be able to use power economically, reduce my power bill as much as possible, whilst ensuring I can charge my car, and use the trailer for maintenance, training and some operations.

Posting this again since I'm new to Reddit and have no idea how to use it 

I'm so embarrassed right now, but I do not think I did anything wrong. Let me explain the situation:

I have had the same mutual friend group since I graduated college 3 years ago. It's a group of people I met through my best friend Jenna (f25) who was my sorority sister in college. Included in the friend group is her older brother (m29) Joe and his wife Diana (f28). I considered both of them my friends, too, but would say I was closer to Joe as he's Jenna's brother.

Diana hosted a birthday dinner for Joe over the weekend. Our mutual friends were there, but so was Jenna and his family. I was happy to get to know some of the people I hadn't met. I know his parents well and caught up well with them too. Diana and Joe also had a child recently and I did see him a few times too. He's adorable!

When we were sitting down after dinner, Diana freaked out on me. She yelled at me, in front of everyone, to stop flirting with her husband, stop touching him, and to not come into her house and be disrespectful. People got quiet after this, before my best friend started talking about something else. I left shortly after.

I truly don't think I did anything disrespectful throughout the night. I, of course, talked to the birthday boy a lot. Everyone was. I don't remember touching him too much, but it was close quarters so I did brush up against him a few times. I did give him a big hug when I saw him and later when I gave him his gift. That is it.

I texted Jenna and she said that I should talk to Diana and Joe about it, but that I should keep distance with him for now because she's never seen Diana this angry. I was supposed to attend their parent's anniversary party but she told me that wouldn't be a good idea right now.

I am a very friendly person, but I respect people's personal boundaries. If anyone had an issue before, they could've mentioned it to me. I have not changed this in the past 3 years, since I've met both Joe and Diana. I am so embarrassed that she basically accused me of trying to sleep with her husband in front of all of our friends and his family. I feel like I can't show my face now.

tl;dr: My friend's wife who I thought was also my friend yelled at me in front of everyone and embarrassed me. What can I do? I am so embarrassed.

**RELEVANT COMMENTS**

**dapplegray**

>Do you value salvaging your relationship with this woman? If so, I'd give her a call and ask for a brunch or coffee or some girl's outing thing, and explain to her that you're really not into her guy, sorry that you came off that way, how horrible it must have felt, etc. etc. Showing empathy is the best way to get people to soften up. Once you reach an understanding, tell her that what she did was really jarring for you, and hurt your reputation, and ask her to fix it since she's the one that damaged it -- she needs to tell other people that she had the wrong idea, and clean up her own mess. I know it's a tall order and most won't do this, but this would be, in theory, the proper way to repair this relationship so that everyone is happy and all the pieces are picked up.

**OOP**

>>Yes because if I'm not good with her, then I won't be good with Joe or his family or his close friends. They were looking at me like I had 5 heads after she yelled at me. When I left, his mom said, ""that's for the best.""

>>I asked Jenna today if she thinks she would apologize and she said, not to expect that and to better respect boundaries. I don't know.

**OOP**

>Joe hasn't talked to me since and didn't respond to my texts. No one is going to apologize to me and I didn't do anything wrong. I feel like I'm in alternate universe right now. No one has ever complained about how I act.

>Jenna all but told me not to attend the party. I really want to go as I do not have family near me and her parents have treated me well. I don't know if I should push that or not?

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/4BpluBYPVb)  **Oct 10, 2017 (later same day)**

Jenna and I just FaceTime for the past like 40ish minutes. She said that she talked to her SIL (Diana) and her brother over the weekend. This is what her SIL said (she sent me a screenshot):

I am always touching and always flirting with Joe. I'm rude to her, ignoring her and not saying hi when I go over to their house. I've texted Joe late at night, even though he had a pregnant wife at home and now a young baby. On his birthday, I went to their house, barely said anything to her, went to see their baby (I hadn't met him yet!), got him all worked up but had enough time to take a picture for Instagram, and then she had to spend the next 15 minutes calming him down. When she came back out, she saw us in a corner, alone, me giving him his gift, and hugging him. I touched him other times throughout the night and no one else had that problem. I did not talk to her at dinner (she was on the opposite end of the table, so of course not), yet I was joking and flirting with her husband. She said I am not welcome in her home again. 

She said her brother said that he's sorry his wife yelled at me because he was the one who she should've been yelling at. Diana asked him multiple times to pull back on our friendship because I was being rude to her and I was always touching him and he said nothing. He'll now be doing that apparently.

No one EVER called me out about these things and I still think that Diana is reading a lot more into everything than there was. I did not purposely ignore her, I always talked to her, I just know Joe better and felt more comfortable with him. She's always been preoccupied with her pregnancy and now their son, so I haven't seen her as much.

**owls_and_cardinals**

>It's hard to say whether you've been out of line or not. It is clear you do not feel you have but I strongly encourage you to see this as a learning experience. When you're friends with a couple, it is good to nurture the relationship with both and perhaps especially with the female. Women often are not completely comfortable with their husbands being close with female friends that seem to maintain distance with the wives themselves; and the same goes for men not being comfortable with wives being close to men that the husband is not. And, well you may see that as silly but it is pretty standard in my experience. 

>Knowing that it is to be expected, you don't want to invite this situation again. It seems clear at a minimum that you considered her much more of a secondary friend and didn't really try to connect with her. And yeah, the late night texts are somewhat over the line. 

>If she raised this to him to set some boundaries first and he refused or failed to, her bigger issue should be with him than with you and it's too bad you took the brunt of it. Try to see your role in this only to try to avoid a similar thing from occurring in the future.

>>Thanks, I don’t have too many friends who are married and parents, so it is different then when I hang out with other people who are in our friend group. 

>>The late night texts are something I have sent to other people too. I know now I shouldn’t do that, but it isn’t like I was hitting on him. I was drunk when sending some of them. I know now to hide my phone when that happens.

**1. What is bitcoin**

**What exactly are you getting when you buy a bitcoin? It’s not a product like a cup of coffee; it’s not a service like a haircut. It’s also not a claim to some cash flows as a depositor in a bank or as a shareholder of a company. It’s also not a copyright of a book or patent to a medicine, which offer legally protected ownership to intangible assets which could generate cash flows.**

**Bitcoin calls itself a currency and usually you get currency as payment for work or in exchange for some product, service or asset you sold or on borrowing or as a gift (Currency is used in the article in the broader sense of physical currency plus bank balances, ie. synonymous with money supply). But bitcoin is rarely acquired in these manners. You can also buy one currency by paying the price in another. So when you pay a hundred thousand US dollars for a bitcoin, you could say it is a currency purchase transaction. But is bitcoin similar to a US Dollar or Euro which are proxies for reasonably stable value; which are proxies with wide and easy acceptance that you can convert it into almost any product, service or asset? Does bitcoin do the job of a currency even when it calls itself one?**

**2. All by Satoshi**

**Bitcoin had its origin on 3rd January 2009. It calls itself a currency and since it is not a physical currency, the data on its transactions and holdings has to be kept somewhere. That is done in a series of blocks of transaction data which form its famous blockchain. As there is no centralised record keeping system in bitcoin, it is the ‘miner’ who is the first to solve a mathematical puzzle in a globally open contest that adds a new block of transactions to the blockchain. And the winning miner is rewarded for his efforts with the block reward, which is currently 3.125 bitcoins and was 50 initially. The very first block, also called the genesis block, is block number 0 and the only transaction in it is the block reward of 50 bitcoins.**

**Who posed the mathematical puzzle for the genesis block? Its pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. Who all attempted to solve this puzzle? Only Satoshi, as this new system was neither open to anyone else to attempt on that date nor was anyone else aware of this new system. Who solved the puzzle? Satoshi, who else! Who gave the block reward and to whom? Satoshi gave it to Satoshi himself/herself/themselves.**

**In other words, the first 50 bitcoins were received by Satoshi, from a system created by Satoshi, for solving a puzzle posed by Satoshi and the only one who could attempt that puzzle was also Satoshi! Block 1 which is the second block was also a repetition of the above and Satoshi awarded himself another 50 bitcoins. Thus an anonymous tech enthusiast(s) sitting somewhere on this planet with a personal computer created a game with a reward whose financial cost is negligible.**

**3. Present worth of those rewards?**

**Those 100 bitcoins Satoshi got for the first two rounds of his game are now worth around USD 10 million. An annual income of USD 10 million means you earn more than that of 99.9% of US population. Similarly, having USD 10 million in wealth places you wealthier than 99.50% of US residents. While the rest of those with 10 million of annual income or wealth would have sweated a lot more for it, all it took Satoshi to match them was token rewards of two rounds of a game. And a game which only Satoshi could play and win; a game which was designed by Satoshi himself!**

**4. How then does value emerge?**

**If you are paying a price for something, it means it is of some value to you. So what makes a bitcoin worth as much as a hundred thousand USD? Water quenches thirst and keeps us alive; we need a house for shelter, safety and comfort. They both have intrinsic value, that is value in itself. But not for bitcoin – we all can live a whole lifetime without bitcoin and not miss pretty much anything.**

**Then there’s value from cash flows. Financial assets like bonds and bank deposits promise not just your initial investment, but also interest, though there is no certainty of fulfillment of that promise. And unlike bonds, some of the bank deposits have a guarantee of repayment from a third party, the deposit insurer, who has kept its promise most often. Thus, bonds and bank deposits promise contract based repayments.**

**Then there’re stocks, which may fetch you dividends when you hold those stocks and capital gains (or losses) when you sell it. But stocks, being the residual claim on the assets and cash flows of the entity issuing it, get paid after everyone else is paid off with whatever is remaining. So the amount receivable is uncertain and whether there is anything at all to receive is also uncertain – and this makes stock prices volatile**

**Also, while banks finance individuals’ and businesses’ consumption and asset acquisition, companies issuing bonds and stocks are in the business of producing something which will be of use to at least some of us. In other words, value of bank deposits, bonds and stocks is a derivative of intrinsic value.**

**5. What makes bitcoin valuable**

**Bitcoin has no intrinsic value and is in no way connected to intrinsic value. It also does not offer interest or dividend. You may sell bitcoin resulting in gain or loss, but can you call it capital gain or loss? It is not a capital asset like land or stocks which represent capital goods aiding production. But the USD in your wallet too has none of these, yet is valuable. How to explain this?**

**6. What is a currency then**

**Currency is valued for being the highest liquidity store of value to everyone in an economy. Rice is a store of value, so too is a house, gold, crude oil and so on. But exchanging the stored value of all these in daily transactions by transfer of these goods is almost impossible. We need something better. Thus humans created a token called currency which represented value. Thus currency is a societal token and is neither real nor natural. Your pet dog or cat would love a bath in your bathtub or a nap in your plush sofa. But your 100 USD bill is useless to that cat and dog. In other words, currency is a fiction deemed valuable by the collective societal mind of humans. But if USD can have value as a currency, why not bitcoin?**

**Currency is universally accepted not because it is said to be so by the state, but because it retains its value, subject to mostly a mild or moderate inflation. Currency keeps its value somewhat stable by the rise or fall in its stock relative to the demand for it. The issuer of official currency takes a holistic look at the economy in which it is transacted, estimates a quantity which is needed for its smooth functioning and adjusts its supply upwards or downwards in response to demand. So what happens when you freeze the supply of a currency – the quantity going neither up or down? Currency is simply a proxy for the value transacted in an economy and as the value created goes up, value transacted also goes up. Those who create value in the economy through production and sale of goods and services demand a proxy for that value exchanged in the form of currency. So currency stock remaining static and transaction value in the economy going up means what? To reflect the higher value transacted, value of each unit of currency has to go up.**

**7. Is currency useful to Robinson Crusoe**

**Currency is a monetary good; an agreed-upon token that represents value. It is convertible into value, it is a proxy for value. Society comes together and assigns value to an otherwise useless token based on custom or law or both. Your currency is valuable only if there is someone to accept it. Thus, for a person alone on an island, currency is useless. The good and bad thing about such representative tokens is that we can simply move from one such token to another, if the society or state so decides.**

**8. When India replaced most of its currency in just 4 hours**

**Indians had a dramatic experience of such a change when on 8th November 2016, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced at 8 PM that currency notes of 500 and 1000 Indian rupee will lose their legal tender status from midnight. Till 8 pm that day, only the Prime Minister and a handful of his confidants had knowledge of such an impending decision. Then with a stroke of pen, 86% of currency in circulation lost its legal tender status in just 4 hours! Till that day midnight, currency notes of those two denominations were valid over the entire territory of India against everyone - that is what legal tender is. Yet, with a stroke of pen, these notes were made valuable only at banks all over India. That too only for exchange into other currency denominations or account balances for the following 140 days. If this was an overnight change of a token, there could be gradual shifts to new and better tokens.**

**9. Scarcity value of bitcoin**

**Likewise, bitcoin too is just another token but lacking the tag of an official or fiat currency. Will bitcoin be valuable since it has no such tag? Yes, says bitcoin enthusiasts. They say a currency gets its value not from the tag attached to it, but from the quantity of that currency. As currency is nothing but proxy for value, lesser its quantity, higher its value. They feel the best way to make the proxy, bitcoin valuable is by capping its supply. Unlike fiat currency, quantity of which in theory can expand infinitely, bitcoin supply is finite. Thus, it will hold its value by being scarce.**

**And this is the core of bitcoin maximalism – bitcoin has limited supply and sensing its scarcity value, gradually the whole world will converge onto bitcoin. So those who don’t have it will have to go to its current holders to get it. When there is such an increase in demand and no increase in supply, existing holders can sell it to everyone else at astronomical prices.**

**Just hold on to a token; see it simply and surely go up in price; sell it to get rich and live happily ever after!**

**An economy where simply holding on to a token will make you rich – will there be such an economy; should there be such an economy? Shouldn’t wealth accrue to those who take risks, those who experiment, those who take humanity forward?**

**10. Will scarcity alone make something valuable?**

**Value is the result of scarcity plus demand. So the question is will the whole world converge to bitcoin, generating that insatiable demand? Unlikely. After all bitcoin is just a proxy, a token that represents value – and not value in itself. All tokens are dispensable. Whole world converging to bitcoin means every other currency being swapped with a fixed quantity of bitcoin. Thus there will be a rapid appreciation in bitcoin price. Which means, other currency holders will have to give up higher and higher quantities of those currencies to get the next unit of bitcoin. But why? Is there any guarantee that the price of bitcoin you exchanged other currencies for will go up or be stable or not fall? When you exchange Russian rouble for bitcoin, it is simply a swap of one currency with another; both are tokens, both are proxies. Bitcoin is not water or oxygen that you cannot live without.**

**11. English language and bitcoin**

**Even the language you are reading now, English is not universal. Despite all the ease the world will have if everybody could communicate in it. Despite the intrinsic value of mutual understanding provided by a language – that too on a global scale. Could bitcoin achieve what English language could not? Unlikely since virtual currencies can be created by almost anyone as there are no entry barriers.**

**12. Natural vs Artificial scarcity**

**Let us now take a deeper look into the “scarcity value” of bitcoin. Ever since human population started multiplying, there was always this fear of land scarcity. Land is needed for agriculture, housing and much else. Malthusian fears of famine and death never materialised and all of us now total 8 billion plus. Human ingenuity resulted in huge increases in agricultural productivity and we now have soil less hydroponics and air based aeroponics. We also have cities with millions living and working together in skyscrapers. In other words, we overcame horizontal scarcity by expanding vertically! If human ingenuity can outsmart real and natural scarcity in this way, can artificial scarcity prop up the value of a fiction and a token like bitcoin – just one among a multitude of tokens called private virtual currencies whose creation has no entry or quantity barriers?**

**13. Is bitcoin unique? Is bitcoin aesthetic?**

**Gold is considered a precious metal as it can withstand anything thrown at it by nature, while other metals turn to dust. Even at its high prices, the electronics industry finds gold the best conductor, with no cheaper substitutes. Against this, bitcoin is simply a virtual synthetic token, capable of being mined to infinite supply – unlike gold. The only thing preventing an infinite supply of bitcoin is a voluntary protocol to not do it – again unlike gold. Then there are those assets with aesthetic value such as paintings by the great masters. They may work as stores of value when availability is scarce and often do appreciate in value. But any bitcoin is indistinguishable from any other bitcoin making it fungible. Hence value from scarcity is a myth in case of bitcoin.**

**And in certain contexts, abundance may be the very source of value as we see next.**

**14. The US Dollar story**

**The events post the breakdown of Bretton Woods system is illuminating. When Nixon reneged on his promise of USD convertibility for its international holders into gold, USD was not dethroned as global currency. US kept its supply of dollars in the global economy flexible and increasing. One among the many strategies US employed was getting Saudi Arabia to invoice all its sale of crude oil in USD in return for US military protection. Everybody needs crude and to buy crude you now need USD. And the best way to get dollars? Export to US. US paid for all its imports in USD by boosting its supply. What if US had constrained USD supply based on ‘scarcity value’ principle? The world would have converged on some other token as international currency. You cannot live without crude oil, but you very well can without USD, which is just another token.**

**Thus, scarcity may have value elsewhere, but not in currencies. Hence will it be wrong to conclude that scarcity, which bitcoin enthusiasts cite as the main reason for its value, could be the very attribute which spells its doom, its death knell?**

**15. Bitcoin to protect from hyperinflation?**

**But won’t bitcoin protect us from hyperinflation?**

**To answer, let us first understand inflation. Suppose there is an economy with 100 candies and 100 dollars. Currency is nothing but a proxy for value. Hence the 100 dollars is nothing but a token which represents the 100 candies in that economy. So the price per candy will be money supply divided by number of candies, which is one dollar in this case. Now imagine that money supply is doubled to 200 while the quantity of candies increases 25% to 125. Then price of candy a becomes USD 1.60 as we divide money supply of 200 by 125 candies. Thus money supply increase at a rate higher than output growth results in inflation. Normal or moderate inflation is low single digit annual inflation of 2 to 5 percent.**

**Hyperinflation is defined as monthly inflation of 50% or more. Hyperinflation happens when a state wants to spend money which it can neither earn as taxes nor borrow from the markets. The economy is dysfunctional and hence there is little output and income to tax. And the state at the helm of such an economy is not found creditworthy by lenders. So the only option left for the state is to ask its central bank to create enough money so that it can meet all its expenditure commitments. Thus money is created way in excess of output growth resulting in currency of no value. In such an economy, will bitcoin be a preferred alternative?**

**The reason for ditching fiat currency is its inability to retain real purchasing power. So someone ditching fiat will shift to a currency which he hopes will retain its real purchasing power at least over the medium term. The question then is does bitcoin offer to hold real purchasing power in the medium term.**

**The test of a currency is your confidence that someone else will accept that currency. That recipient in turn accepts it as he is confident that a third person will accept it at full value. Fiat currencies have their supply regulated by a central bank who takes a holistic view of that economy and decides on a certain level. Even private currencies under the erstwhile free banking era linked their supply to demand and to the assets they had on their balance sheet.**

**But bitcoin has a capped supply at 21 million units and most of which are already out there. As the stock can neither contract and expand much, a higher transaction volume and higher demand will result in a price increase and a fall in demand has to be accompanied by a price drop.**

**16. It may not**

**So in a scenario of hyperinflation, fiat currency maybe ditched for bitcoin only if the rate of fall in fiat is expected to be more than the probable loss in bitcoin. So bitcoin may make short term sense. Or it may not. If there is movement from fiat to bitcoin, there will be rise in its price. But the volatility of bitcoin – will that make it a currency fiat holders will NOT switch to in a hyperinflation panic?**

**17. Will you trust bitcoin with your wealth?**

**The motive during hyperinflation is preservation of value and not speculative profit. It is one thing to buy bitcoin with your ready to lose one hundred dollars as a speculative investment and quite another to shift large amounts of wealth during a hyper inflation panic. If you have one million USD worth of wealth in a hyper inflating currency, you could buy 10 bitcoins at one hundred thousand dollars apiece. But will you have peace of mind with that much wealth in bitcoin which has no real basis for value? A better option will be property or stocks. Property has use value and stocks are fractional ownership of running businesses. Both have strong basis for value.**

**Unlike bitcoin.**

**18. Speculation on speculative value!**

**And therein lies another problem with bitcoin. Stock prices are also speculative and hence volatile. But speculation in stocks is speculation on real value of a business, a company. When you speculate on a stock, you are looking at two factors – the price you paid for the real value of a business and the price a potential buyer might pay for it when you sell. In other words, there is a value you assign to the business and there is your assessment of the value a prospective buyer may assign to that business. But in case of bitcoin, the sole factor is the price a prospective buyer assigns for something of no real value, unlike the equity stock of a company. Your only concern then is what will be the next buyer’s speculative valuation of bitcoin, which is, the value assigned by the greater fool down the line!**

**In other words, bitcoin is doubly speculative - speculation on speculative value!**

**19. No monopoly for bitcoin**

**Let us now go back to hyperinflation. Unlike fiat, there is no monopoly for bitcoin in the private currency market. Thus other private currencies with elasticity in supply may be a better option to switch to. If additional demand for a private currency is met with additional supply and lesser demand with contraction in supply, there are better chances of stability in its purchasing power. So private currencies with supply elasticity maybe superior to bitcoin under hyperinflation.**

**20. How frequent is hyperinflation**

**Since the end of second world war, the number of countries that have experienced hyperinflation is fewer than fingers in your hands. Which means most of the world has never experienced hyperinflation in the last 75 years and many of them not before either. It was in the last 75 years the Bretton Woods system came and went. Also, we have completed a longer period since its breakdown than with it. Hence is there a higher probability of hyperinflation now than before? No. So the need for bitcoin has to be seen in a world of low to moderate inflation. If the need for bitcoin in case of a completely dysfunctional fiat itself is questionable, do we even need bitcoin when fiat is reasonably functional?**

**21. A trust-less currency?**

**Now to the ‘trust-less’ currency claim of bitcoin. With multiple options in currency, won’t we wonder which of these will hold value and hence be acceptable to those to whom we pass it on?**

**First we have an official currency legally backed by state and also by assets of the central bank (though at times with insufficient assets). Then we have private currencies backed by assets, but not by state. And then we have bitcoin sans state or asset backing; but by capped supply and scarcity, which official and some private currencies lack. But we’ve seen that capped supply and scarcity is no backing for value in case of bitcoin.**

**Thus currency of any type, devoid of intrinsic value, is always a question of confidence. Will you sell a product or service or asset in return for a token whose value comes solely from a society-wide consensus and has no real value? That depends on whether someone else will accept such tokens from you and everyone else against his delivery of products, services or assets to you and others.**

**Thus for a currency, to rephrase football coach Henry Russel Sanders, trust and confidence is not everything, it’s the only thing! It is a society-wide agreement that rests on confidence and trust. So no currency can claim to be trust-less; least of all bitcoin.**

**If you want a trust-less currency, it should have intrinsic value. In other words a commodity as currency, as was minted gold and silver coins of an earlier era. Yet even minted gold and silver coins require some amount of trust – by looking at and feeling such a coin, one cannot confirm that it is of the purity and weight claimed by the issuer. Moreover, 21st century is ill suited for such commodity currencies.**

**22. Designed for medieval times?**

**Against the top down centralisation of fiat currencies, bitcoin has bottom up decentralisation built into its design. Which is welcome. But it is embedded in a structure of capped supply and an inflexible protocol. This in a complex and dynamic world where the rate of change is accelerating with giant leaps in technology; where everyone and everything has to continuously reinvent and adapt to stay relevant.**

**Bitcoin supply is capped and would have been excellent in the ancient and medieval era of near zero economic growth. In other words, designed for medieval times in the first decade of a still young 21st century! Designed for medieval times combining a set of state of the art technologies – blockchain based decentralised public ledger, proof of work system, peer to peer censorship resistant network, digital wallets, smart contracts & layer 2 solutions and cryptography & hashing!**

**23. Can technology eliminate the need for trust**

**Now for a moment imagine that somebody does come up with a perfect flat-coin (discussed later in 25) with proven scientific algorithms and safeguards. Even then, there is always the threat of system breakdown, hacking, cyber attacks and so on.**

**So no matter how good a system is, everything boils down to your trust in the system, your confidence in the system and the trust and confidence of everyone else who are part of that system.**

**Science, technology and mathematics can definitely help improve the confidence in a private currency; but such confidence as to not need trust? Probably never. Because the one and only test a currency has to pass is whether it can be swapped with real goods, services and assets. One and only test, but a formidable test!**

**24. Currency as store of value**

**To buttress the point once more, the first function of a currency is to be a stable store of value. When that stored value is easily transferable across time and space with no loss, it acquires liquidity making it a medium of exchange. That is the second function of currency (It has a third function of being a unit of account and usually those which fulfill the first two functions fulfill its third function). It cannot be medium of exchange first and then store of value. It is a medium of exchange only because it is a store of value.**

**Ice creams can never be a medium of exchange because they are inferior as a store of value. Rice is superior to ice creams as store of value, but is less liquid than currency. If we have one currency which fulfills these roles, then we don’t need others. So it’s a winner-takes-all market. Thus a private digital currency with an elastic supply maybe a good complement to fiat. Since people won’t have confidence in a single private currency, there maybe a few competing ones. We already have stable coins and there are attempts to create flat-coins, which have elasticity of supply through which stable value is sought to be maintained. But bitcoin is neither flat nor stable.**

**25. Flat-coins, Balaji Srinivasan, Marx and Menger**

**Having talked about flat-coin, we cannot help but talk about Balaji Srinivasan. It was he who originated this concept. It is an algorithmic elastic currency which automatically adjusts its value and/or volume so that it is inflation proof.**

**Balaji is a huge fan of bitcoin too. But won’t someone who came up with the idea of flat-coin, be wise enough to see through the fiction of bitcoin’s value? To use an analogy, if someone is wise enough to grasp Menger’s subjective value theory (which says value comes from usefulness of a product; quantity of labour expended is immaterial), he can easily see through the fiction of Marx’s surplus value theory (which says value comes from quantity of labour used in a product and where usefulness is secondary).**

**So why is Balaji enthusiastic about two currencies whose principles are plainly contradictory? Both Menger and Marx share the same first name with different spellings – Carl Menger and Karl Marx. So Balaji Srinivasan comes across as Carl Marx or Karl Menger! Something which he needs to explain**

**26. Techno fallacy**

**Android is an excellent operating system for mobile phones and tablets. But does that mean any application built on android platform will also be excellent? Certainly not. Likewise blockchain maybe a great new technology. But bitcoin being based on blockchain and other new technologies – does that alone make bitcoin also a great new virtual currency? Certainly not. This is the techno or blockchain fallacy which many bitcoin supporters fall prey to – anything based on cutting edge technology will also be great by default. And that brings us to the ‘benevolence of Bismarck’.**

**27. Benevolence of Bismarck**

**The first national systems of health and accidental insurance as also pensions came up in late 19th century Germany under Otto von Bismarck as Chancellor. Such farsightedness and benevolence in 19th century itself, more than a century and a quarter ago! Farsightedness? Yes, but benevolence? Not so sure.**

**Second half of 19th century was the period of Marx’s call for workers of the world to unite and go for revolution. It was this threat of revolution which made Bismarck offer pensions and insurance so that the incentives for revolution are absent or reduced; and not benevolence alone.**

**Similarly, the threat of private flat-coins and other such currencies may be enough to make central bankers hesitant to go for a deluge of money supply. A state and its central bank never likes to give up its currency monopoly and the sword of private currencies over their heads maybe enough to make them behave. Will that make flat and stable coins dead on arrival?**

**28. A bit more of Marx**

**Satoshi and Bitcoin maximalists look a lot like Marx and Marxists – both found problems in the existing system, proposed for demolition of it, but to the question of what as a substitute, both have a silly solution.**

**There’s one more amusing similarity. While Marx said exploitation of labour is the only source of profit as labour is the only source of value, Bitcoin maximalists think scarcity as the source of its value. Both these theories are simplistic and incorrect.**

**But there is one crucial difference between Marx and Satoshi, though the followers of both are similar. Marx felt that the transition from capitalism to stateless communism was inevitable. But Satoshi is less confident when at some point in the Bitcoin white paper he says - ""If it somehow acquires value, it will be a non-trivial task to determine the true owner of the coins”. When its creator itself was diffident of it acquiring value, should the rest of us be confident?**

**29. Flat-earthers**

**An average person, who believes his entire life that earth is flat, won’t most probably be in much trouble. But astronomers, geologists, pilots, navigators and so on, who believe that earth is flat will land not only themselves but all of us in deep trouble.**

**Similarly private individuals and firms thinking bitcoin is the ultimate solution for most economic problems may not find themselves in much trouble and many of them may even be better off financially. But if central bankers too think in that fashion, things could get disastrous. We all can live without Bitcoin and no matter how high its prices rise, it doesn’t really affect any of us (except for the speculative gains or losses). And, importantly for those holding bitcoin, no matter how low its prices fall, it doesn’t really affect any of us either.**

**30. Lenin and Trump**

**We now go to Marx yet again. Marx’s most influential ideas and theories were disseminated from 1848 with Communist Manifesto to 1894 with the third volume of Capital (published posthumously). About a quarter century later in 1917, it was Lenin who first tried to establish a communist society. Theoretical communist society was a beauty but its real world version turned out to be a beast, a monster. Somewhat similarly, will the relentless march of bitcoin, now confined to private balance sheets, falter if Donald Trump and Elon Musk stuff Federal Reserve and US Treasury balance sheets with it?**

**Let us end this critique with one more comparison—this time with homeopathy. If the homeopathic principle of dilution, called potentisation, holds true, then you have to discard the basics of modern chemistry and physics. Similarly, if you find Bitcoin valuable, you have to discard all other sensible economic theories of value. An interesting parallel there when homeopathic placebo effect is mistaken for scientific therapeutic effect and bitcoin’s greater fool value is mistaken for real value!**

**Is the value of bitcoin, then, zero? No. In different ways, it is valuable for its holders and for all the rest of us.**

**Bitcoin is a global super duper brand with immense value, which can be monetised and shared among its holders.**

**And for all the rest of us? After the free banking era ended, we had almost a century when the word currency was without prefixes and adjectives. Without bitcoin we wouldn’t have had prefixes of crypto, private, virtual and what not.**

**With the advent of bitcoin, we stopped taking money for granted; so too central banks and the state. We realised there could be choices even in money. Bitcoin was the stepping stone for flat-coins, stable coins and central bank digital currencies. Monetary gains from bitcoin will stop once it gets to the greatest fool. But societal gains from Satoshi questioning the status quo with a crazy and disruptive experiment – that will be long lasting**

1hpfm8f,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenAdvice/comments/1hpfm8f/story_time/,Story time,"Our conversations were deeper than two people could have that were not in an intimate relationship is how It was with my friend Mark. We had been friends for over 30 years but never an intimate moment.

Rode around and laughed doing adolescent things, he was a brother to me. Mark introduced me to his cool friend Scott and we hit it off. Scott and I married and built a life and kept Mark in it. Mark had met his beautiful bride Tori and we all were friends together. Scott nor Tori found any problems with our friendship. This was good because we would sit alone with out our spouses and talk for hours 

Scott became very abusive and Mark would rescue me. One time Mark was in back of our truck when Scott started punching me in the face. He stopped him and he carried me away from Scott. Unchanging we all remained friends. Mark is my confident, he is my safe place, he is my man’s view, my brother. I divorced Scott, went through a couple of boyfriends and remarried a man named Lee, keeping my Mark and his wife Tori as my friends. I explained the relationship to Lee and he seemed to understand. 

Two years ago Mark and Tori divorced, she left him because he let alcohol control his life. You see Mark and I came from extremely abusive childhood homes. We were the calm for each other in the chaos. Mark was devastated, Tori had met someone on line and was done with him. He went straight to the bottle hard and was hitting the bottom. I was trying to be there for him without crossing boundaries with Lee. Everything was kept in respect. 

Then Scott my ex died.. Mark shows up at funeral crying and pleading over my ex’s casket. Obviously he was very drunk at this time. I was embarrassed for Mark and it felt very odd to me to try to calm him at my ex’s funeral with my husband Lee there too, awkward. I am ok I have this until…. Mark walks up to Lee and tells him. I love her, as he was pointing at me, i love her with all my heart…. Don’t ever hurt her. Lee the whole time is saying “I understand, I understand “. Wow! That man handled it amazingly. Keep in mind. Lee is new and do not understand the true meaning of our friendship. 

Nothing is said for a minute. Nothing was thrown into my face. Lee did not torture me with the awkward funeral love moment.  

My Mark was hitting bottom and he was needing me. He had lost his mother the same week he lost his wife. He became suicidal and lost his job because of the bottle. I still was keeping respectful boundaries with Lee and I had not gone to sit with Mark at his apartment ever. We would meet for coffee. Lee understood this. But one day something snapped with Lee and said a man and woman can not be friends it always leads to sex. That I can no longer be there for my Mark.  I have respected my husbands wishes and not met him and very limited amounts of text.  Lee told me it is not appropriate.

1hpfl4m,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1hpfl4m/so_im_completely_new_to_espresso_and_my_dad/,So I'm completely new to espresso and my dad bought me a Gevi model GECME020DE-U for Christmas. Looking for advice on how to get the most out of this machine and what accessories I should buy. ,"I've tried making a couple shots but so far I feel pretty lost in the whole process. I like the taste of coffee but I'm starting to realize that espresso is a whole different beast than drip coffee in terms of flavor extraction. There are just so many steps and it all feels a bit overwhelming, especially because there isn't just a recipe I can follow and get reliable results every time because all coffee is different so even if I used the exact same process I would end up getting different results. I also have absolutely no idea what good espresso is supposed to taste like, or if I would even know if I had made ""good"" espresso. Is it still supposed to be bitter or is it supposed to be completely delicious to drink without any cream or sweetener? I feel like I was led to believe that the latter was the case but now I'm doubting if it's the machine or me. I've always been a fan of more bitter coffee but I was still in the middle of the spectrum between people who drink coffee black and people who drink sugary milk with a splash of coffee. To me the espresso I've been making just tastes like black coffee. A bit less acidic and watery, but still not great. 

I guess what I'm asking is, have I set my expectations too high, and just misunderstood what the end result is supposed to be like? But more importantly, is there some basic recipe/process that I can start with? Because I feel like I'm trying to ""dial in"" without any standard variables that I can start with. Maybe one thing is off or maybe the whole process is off, but I don't know because I've got nothing to go off of. 

Also, as to the accessories, what should I prioritize getting in addition to the stuff that comes with the machine? I have a scale but it isn't very precise, it just rounds to the nearest gram. Do I need a more precise scale than that or will that work? I'm already looking to get a simple 3d printed needle thing off Etsy for WDT, but what else should I look for? Should I start looking for a bottomless portafilter or is that too advanced for my level? I'm also trying to find one of those funnel things that go on the edge of the portafilter to stop the grounds from falling over the sides. Does anyone know of one that will work for the model that I have? Should I get a different tamper than the one that comes with the machine? And how do I tamp evenly when the bottom has the two spout things? I feel like every time it ends up slanted because I can't put it down on a flat surface. And what's the difference between dual wall and single wall on the basket things?

Finally, should I be using whole milk for steaming? I've been using 1% because that's what my family has at home but it barely froths at all so I'm wondering if I need a milk with more fat content? 

Sorry if I got a bit off track at the beginning. I really want to figure this out because I'm worried I'll lose motivation to do anything with it, and I don't want to do that because I know these machines are expensive and I feel like that would make me come off as ungrateful. I also just want to be able to make something good with it.

1hpfkhl,https://www.reddit.com/r/AuDHDWomen/comments/1hpfkhl/not_wanting_to_eat_but_also_scared_to_not_eat/,Not wanting to eat but also scared to not eat enough,"Trigger warning: binge eating, obsessive eating, not wanting to eat, calories.

Since April of this year, I’ve been struggling with eating. I don’t like eating and don’t want to eat, or the effort required to feed myself outweighs any desire I might have to eat. I often don’t feel hungry, but sometimes even when I do feel hungry, my lack of desire to eat is stronger than even the hunger.

This has been an incredibly strange struggle for me as previously I struggled with obsessive eating and binge eating.

Over the past month or so, eating has become even more challenging for me. Over the holidays I ate a little more easily. My brother came home to visit from Italy and there were a lot of restaurants he missed and wanted to eat at, so I ate at them with him. I actually went back to occasionally eating too much and made my stomach uncomfortable a couple of times. Well, since he went back to Italy, I’m back to not wanting to eat.

Today, I’ve eat a protein bar and a small bacon and cheddar muffin, and I’ve had a coffee. I was feeling bad that that’s all I’ve eaten today because I thought it wasn’t enough and was trying to psyche myself up to drink a protein shake, or eat a slice of peanut butter toast, or have cereal when I got home. I live with my mom and dad. They are both out of town. It’s a little easier for me to eat when they are home because I know someone is aware of whether or not I’ve eaten. So I texted them and told them that I’d had the protein bar, muffin, and coffee, and that’s all I’d had today. I told them that I was texting them in the hopes that it would encourage me to eat when I got home.

Well, my dad texted that he thought a protein bar and muffin was fine. He said I shouldn’t try to force myself to eat. I texted back clarifying that that’s all I’ve eaten today and that I didn’t think it was enough. He said he sometimes eats only that amount of food in a day, and that I might be more hungry tomorrow. He said he’d be concerned if I wasn’t eating anything.

Now I’m confused. I thought I’d not eaten enough because I know our bodies need a certain amount of calories during the day just for our organs to function, and that they need more calories for any activities we do, including just moving. I was feeling bad thinking that I’d not given my body what it needs and was hoping texting my mom and dad would help psyche me up to eat when I got home. Instead, my dad’s response has me feeling more inclined to listen to the fact that I really don’t want to eat and it has me wondering if I’ve been concerned about my lack of eating for no reason.

Any other ADHD/AuDHD people struggle to eat? Am I worrying for nothing about how little I’ve eaten today?",3,1735534846.0,AuDHDWomen,1,1.0,False

The 5-gallon tank is cycled, but I’m not sure about the water parameters. I have the API Master Test Kit, but I haven’t done a test in a long time. My betta fish is happy, active, and appears to be in good health with a healthy appetite. He eats a mixture of pellets (Northfin, Hikari Bio-Gold, and Finsect Betta) but doesn’t get brine shrimp or frozen food. I feed him twice a day, giving about six pellets each time. Still, I feel like I might be overfeeding him.

1. I’m having issues with my red root floaters and plants in general. The floaters were doing well until I added a top light, which led to the development of brown algae, and now the red root floaters are starting to melt. I’m not sure if both changes are related. I added a nerite snail, but it escaped the no-lid tank after a few days and has disappeared! My betta doesn’t jump, so he’ll be fine without a lid, but I’d appreciate any suggestions (like using nets, etc.).

I bought Flourish Excel and have been dosing it carefully. I don’t have a CO2 system, as it seems too complicated to set up, and I haven’t been using fertilizers. I did make my own fertilizer using banana peels, ground coffee, and eggshells, and my plants seemed to do well with that, but I stopped. I’m also not using root tabs.

2. I have glass stains on the tank and am not sure how to clean them with the fish still in it. I’ve cleaned the tank twice, removing the fish when doing major water changes and rearranging the plants, but the stains keep coming back. Any suggestions?

3. I have biofilm in the tank, which is not harmful, but I have to remove it daily. Some of the food pellets sink and seem to contribute to the biofilm.

4. I have another 28-gallon empty tank that I’m saving for later to cycle and scape, but I plan to do that in the spring.

I live under the same roof as him and my mom (who I am more close to) but me and him always tend to clash at some point. He's always been controlling, overbearing, and arrogant. He's always boasted about his achievements and exaggerated it enough to make it sound like it was one of the greatest achievements in human history. He's SUPER religious and political, going as far as to say that Barack Obama and the democratic party are the disciples of the Antichrist and the rapture will happen soon (all beliefs based on poorly made YouTube videos made by wackjobs who have nothing better to do than to stir up and exploit fear) He shows little to no regard about people's boundaries and always has some kind of opinion about something with the sentiment of ""I'm right and everyone else is wrong."" He also takes my mom for granted like he will literally wake her up at night when he gets home from work so she can make him a sandwich or wakes her up in the morning to make him coffee because apparently he ""doesn't know how the coffee machine works."" 😐 and anytime that he needs help with something be it yard work or anything else of that nature, he finds a way to weasel himself out of it by either delegating it on the other people such as my brothers and I or low balls people when it comes to paying them by either paying them too little or buying them food. Sometimes he doesn't even pay them at all like my cousin for example, he used to work on my dad's cars but doesn't do it anymore because he doesn't pay him money or if he does, it's usually not on the day of or he buys beer for him. In September my brothers and I helped him cut down a tree in our backyard and he said that he was going to pay us $300 and we still haven't gotten paid yet. I've actually tried confronting him about the tree situation in general and he said something along the lines of ""You live in my house, we don't charge you much for rent, and we buy you food. You should be grateful."" Like I get that and maybe to some degree he may have a point but if I work for you under the expectation that I am going to get paid for it, then FOLLOW THRU WITH YOUR WORD FOR FUCKS SAKE!

For months, we maintained that friendship.

About six months later, I found out—completely by accident—that he was seeing someone. She was suggested to me as a friend on Instagram, and around the same time, a text he sent me earlier in the year popped up in my phone widget. In it, he’d mentioned trying to get her to rent his old apartment. She declined, saying the space was too small, but apparently asked him to coffee a month later—something he claims he didn’t realize was a date.

His actions toward her suggested he was serious—meeting his mom and friends—but his social media, and even his interactions with me, gave the impression he was still single. I pulled back and focused on keeping things strictly platonic.

Things seemed fine until I learned she didn’t know I was still in his life. It caused a fight between them during his trip to meet her family after I sent him a birthday text.

He later told me he explained our friendship to her and that things were “okay for now.” I even offered to meet her when I visited to ease her discomfort, but he said, “I don’t know if she’ll ever be comfortable with it.” I respected that and backed off, assuming she’d come around in time—or so I thought.

A few days before my birthday, he finally acknowledged their relationship on social media by reposting a photo someone else had taken of them. I expected it to hurt, but I felt indifferent and thought maybe I was over him.

I was wrong.

While searching for something we’d shared in a text, I noticed the message appeared in the search bar but wasn’t there when I clicked it. At first, I thought it was a glitch, but after restarting my phone, I realized—he had deleted almost every message between us from September through November. Oddly, the rest, including earlier and later messages, were still there.

From what I could see, nothing seemed incriminating—aside from the timeline and one text during their fight where he said, “I felt awkward telling you I was seeing anyone. I guess it’s because I wasn’t really sure of it.”

The thing is, he was sloppy about it. I still have the messages thanks to an iCloud backup.

I’ve already asked him for clarification but haven’t heard back yet. Now, I’m considering reaching out to his girlfriend if he doesn’t respond by New Year’s Eve. It’s clear he’s been lying to both of us for months—and still is. I’ve accepted that he might very well never speak to me again if I did this.

H color diamonds offer exceptional value for savvy diamond shoppers. Here's why they're a top choice:

* H color is the sweetspot of the color scale, offering a near-colorless appearance that looks white to the naked eye while providing excellent value for money.
* Price difference: A 1.00 carat H VS1 diamond costs $3,610 while a similar F color diamond costs $5,430, a 3.6% price difference
* Versatile for various metal settings
* Lab-grown diamonds offer significant cost savings compared to natural diamonds. A 2.00 carat H color with VS1 clarity natural diamond is sold for $16,050, while a better looking 2.00 carat lab-grown diamond with D color and VVS2 clarity is sold for $3,070, a 422% price difference!
* The average price of a 1.00 carat H color diamond is $4,125

* Alternatively, you can save more if you choose a lower near colorless grade. For example, the average price of a 1.00 carat J color diamond is $3,352, approximately 23% price difference.

* H color is a great option for larger stones without significant price increase
* **Recommended Vendors**: For a reliable buying experience, consider purchasing [from trusted retailers such as those](https://labdiamondsreview.com/diamonds/) that provide comprehensive grading reports and advanced visualization tools to assist in selecting the perfect stone.

Feel free to[ reach out for a free one-on-one consultation.](https://labdiamondsreview.com/contact-us/)



# Who is this for?

* Budget-conscious buyers wanting near-colorless diamonds
* Shoppers looking for larger stones without breaking the bank
* Those prioritizing cut quality and overall appearance over color grade

# Who is this not for?

* Buyers insisting on strictly colorless diamonds
* Those choosing diamond shapes that show color more readily (e.g., emerald cuts)

# Recommendations for Smart Buying

1. Prioritize cut quality: An excellent cut can make an H color diamond appear whiter and more brilliant.
2. Consider the setting: White gold or platinum can enhance the diamond's white appearance.
3. Compare with G color: Often, the visual difference is minimal, but the price savings are significant.

1. Pay attention to size: H color works well for most sizes, but for very large diamonds (3+ carats), you might consider G or higher.
2. Evaluate in different lights: Check the diamond under various lighting conditions to ensure you're satisfied with its appearance.

# FAQ

Q: Will an H color diamond look yellow?

A: No, H color diamonds appear white to the naked eye, especially when face-up.

Q: How does H compare to G color?

A: The difference is subtle. Most people can't distinguish between G and H without side-by-side comparison.

Q: Is H color good for engagement rings?

A: Yes, H color is an excellent choice for engagement rings, offering a great balance of quality and value.

Q: How much can I save with an H color diamond?

A: You can save 15-30% compared to colorless (D-F) diamonds of similar qualities.

Q: Are there any downsides to H color diamonds?

A: In larger sizes or certain cuts (like emerald), a very slight tint might be noticeable from the side. However, this is rarely an issue for most buyers.

Remember, while color is important, it's just one factor. Balance color with cut, clarity, and carat weight to find your perfect diamond.

- **Use Sponsorship Platforms:** Platforms like Podcorn, Gumball, or Anchor can connect you with brands looking for podcast sponsors. These platforms streamline the process and help you secure deals more quickly.

Sponsorships can come in various forms, like pre-roll, mid-roll, or post-roll ads. These placements can enhance your podcast's content when delivered authentically. Make sure to choose products or services that resonate with your audience to maintain trust and relevance.

### Listener Donations

Another effective way to monetize your podcast is through listener donations. This method relies on the support of your audience and can be lucrative if your listeners value your content. Here’s how you can encourage donations:

- **Engage with Your Community:** Building a loyal community around your podcast is crucial. Interact with your audience through social media platforms or live Q&amp;A sessions. This engagement fosters a sense of belonging and makes listeners more inclined to support you financially.
- **Offer Exclusive Content:** Consider creating special content or perks for listeners who choose to donate. Platforms like Patreon offer creators a way to provide exclusive episodes, behind-the-scenes access, or merchandise. This tactic can drive donations as fans see value in their contributions.
- **Be Transparent:** Let your audience know how donations will help improve the podcast. Whether you're upgrading equipment or funding new projects, transparency encourages listeners to contribute because they can see their support making a difference.
- **Express Gratitude:** Always thank your listeners for their support. Publicly recognizing donors on your podcast or social media platforms builds a connection and encourages ongoing support.
- **Make It Easy to Donate:** Use platforms that simplify the donation process. Links to PayPal, Buy Me a Coffee, or Patreon should be easy to find on your website and shared in your episode descriptions.

Listener donations create a sense of community and ownership among your audience. They feel more connected to you and your podcast, which can lead to increased loyalty and support.

### Combining Sponsorships and Donations

Both sponsorships and listener donations can coexist, offering you a robust monetization strategy. Sponsorships can provide more immediate financial support, while listener donations can offer a steady income over time. By combining these methods, you create diverse revenue streams, making your podcast more sustainable and profitable.

Remember, the key to success lies in your ability to connect with both your sponsors and your listeners.

1hpey9t,https://v.redd.it/pjhjl59xxw9e1,Pay close attention KoolAide drinkers. Let the programming begin! Read below 👇🏻 ,"We start out with portions of their livestream 12/20. She talks about how they are below middle class struggling. We move right into the handbags she bought that she posted to her stories just today, then yesterdays post from The Champagne Bar at the Oxford Center in Tampa where brunch alone starts at $100 per person, followed by her brag about having the top tier pass, because she's bougie as hell, followed by they pay $238 per month for both of them to come to the parks everyday. Then she discusses how they are saving so they eat out once a week. Talking about how expensive it is to drink out at $18 per drink, trying to keep a meal for 2 under $50. (I'm not even sure 🤔 how any place even fast food has meals under $50 for 2 anymore), then to her new story posted today where she is at the Gran Destino Tower with coffee and a danish followed by that $18 drink and how they celebrate.
(Oh notice the blank computer screen as usual. 🤪 Always has to seem important)
Then she discusses how they went to STK for Wes's birthday. Doubtful 🤨 that bill
was under $65.00 for 2 people with a tip. Then she discusses her brand new tank tops from Kali Rose Boutique. She then discusses taking her week off after hitting 200k followers. (When she started this live she only needed 600 followers. She didn't get it. Imagine that!) Then she discusses her weekend getaway to Amelia Island. (No video no advertising, they had to have paid. Who just invites people for free stays at a resort with no return on investment or advertising.) Then we shift back to how tough things are again, because Wes HAD to change jobs when asking people to donate their own money to DisneyTipFairy's tip challenge for cast members. It's so tough money wise. Wes then buys a Disney candy bar. I'm sure it was at least $10 if not more. Goes onto talking about her Pretty Little Things Tank Top again. Then she goes Jerry Springer 2.0 on the monorail undressing to show off her new tank top. Used only one button. (Do ya think 🤔 they are real?) Talks about her new $100 stair stepper. Then she says Wes is pretty and looks sick. 🤒 Maybe he should take off the day. Then she moves into passive aggressive begging from all you KoolAide drinkers. She wants to retire Wes (just not work for it of course because her brain 🧠 can't handle it) since Wes let her live a soft life except for them dam kids of his. Saying nothing soft about raising those dam kids. Finally we arrive at her talking about Karma. Somehow 🤔 I think
Karma will find her soon and not in a positive kind way either. Just saying! Eventually, this kind of shit catches up to you one way or another. I guess her mother never told her it wasn't good to lie or steal, much less talk about people badly.
Guess we will wait and see!


I will be posting the full 20 minutes of this livestream in 4 parts next. This was just a compilation of how they spend money and lie of being broke in the same breath. All in one week! These folks are not hurting financially. They are swindling you. Listen how they shift to we don’t have, but…look at what I got, look at what I’m doing…… Wes taking off afternoons, her taking off a week. People crazy enough to support them.",3,1735532765.0,TheWessicawaySnark,8,1.0,False
1hpexv4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Adulting/comments/1hpexv4/why_do_we_accept_the_unacceptable/,Why do we accept the unacceptable?,"We have got to stop accepting the unacceptable. This idea has been co-opted, like all important ideas, by political discourse. “The unacceptable” has become synonymous with “the ideology opposite my own” (as if individuals truly hold a unique ideology rather than having adopted one through their computer, television or phone). Being liberal, or conservative, does not keep one from accepting the unacceptable. Rather, it is the filter for which unacceptable behavior one is willing to accept. And it is only a partial filter, much of what is unacceptable permeates both sides of the political aisle, largely related to refusing to accept information that requires them to even slightly adjust their belief system, regardless of the source. 

Among the unacceptable we should stop accepting are hyper-violent and hyper-sexualized media (keyword: hyper), excessive advertisement, “mind control” such as the previous examples but also other media and political speeches designed to control, tyrannical behavior in personal relationships (another attempt to control), addiction (you can become addicted to anything that releases dopamine), excess conformity, demands for excess consumerism, and much more. 

In order for one to begin the journey to rejecting the unacceptable, one must first actively detach themselves from their usual consumption. It begins, for most millenials and younger, with putting down their phone a bit more often, deleting/deactivating or otherwise drastically reducing their exposure to social media (especially YouTube, Facebook, TikTok and Reddit), and engaging in their offline existence. In addition to this, and for older adults, it involves rethinking what you consume (food, coffee, alcohol, smoking, etc.). The first step to rethinking is a pause to reflect on why you're consuming this particular item. Second, ask yourself what the benefits and drawbacks are. Lastly, ask yourself if, deep down, it's really what you want at that moment. While most people would benefit from cutting out alcohol and smoking entirely, at least significantly reducing caffeine consumption, and eating a diet free of or low in processed foods, the ideal habits for each person greatly vary in the details. 

Among the unacceptable lies the belief that our inner voice doesn't matter. Too often, we speak with our “outer” or reactionary voice, feeling as though we must get a word in from a position of authority. Examples of this include chiming in on too much online discourse, insisting that our view is the correct one and that we should be treated as an authority on a subject we have minimal and/anecdotal knowledge on at best. Our inner voice speaks, quietly, to us, what we need to say. It speaks out truth. It requires effort to hear. Accepting our inner voice and bringing its words to our vocal chords serves as another defense against the unacceptable. When the unacceptable comes to us over and over again in a personal relationship, vocalizing our inner voice, “I've had enough. I won't accept this behavior anymore,” can create a necessary boundary.

Accepting our inner voice can prevent us from accepting our own unacceptable behaviors as well. The inner voice warns us when our actions aren't lining up with our integrity. Integrity goes beyond society's versions of right and wrong. It serves as an inner compass to align us with our authentic selves. You may feel, through exhaustion, or peer pressure, that you should not seek proper guidance in a task you're not knowledgeable on, until your inner voice nudges you to override that external pressure, likely saving you (and anybody else relying on your success in that particular venture) a headache. 

A later part of the journey of rejecting the unacceptable involves accepting the parts of yourself that have been ignored in favor of the unacceptable. Humans have limited capacity. Hence why only so much can get done in a day. When we accept the unacceptable, we abandon, at least partially, the acceptable. These days, it feels as though the most common acceptable phenomena we abandon are the ones naturally occurring inside of us. A thought, a belief, an idea or a behavior that comes naturally to us and expresses our true selves can easily be the first to go once we begin to make room for the unacceptable. This can make us feel, ironically, as though we shouldn't accept it. Retraining ourselves to accept our own natural being and expression can take some effort. However, once the unacceptable has made its way out, the acceptable often naturally makes its way back since it is just that: natural to us.

1hpevtw,https://www.reddit.com/r/42_school/comments/1hpevtw/my_first_day_at_42_amman/,My First Day at 42 Amman,"Yesterday was the first time in forever that I sat down to learn sth for hours and completely lost track of time! 

I want to share my first day of the piscine in 42 amman and I’ll try to keep posting regularly about my journey heree

We started at 9:42 am (yep the 42 thing is no coincidence lol, everything here is about the number 42!! ) with a lecture explaining the rules which were mostly don’ts 😂, and got introduced to the room names like bocal, cluster (the room with PCs) and some others I have already forgotten tbh 🚶🏻‍♂️

Then the team in 42amman introduced themselves and they were all super nice!! I remember one guy named Feras (he was at the Berlin piscine) even tho I have only known him for less than a day he seems like a great person, he kept stopping by the cluster every now and then..(I thought he was there to help us) but every time someone asked a question he’d say “Ask your peer!” 😂😂 like bro just give me the f*** answer! 
I hope I can become friends with him after the piscine because he seems really cool.

After about an hour or so they asked us to take a group photo and recorded a clip.. the video idea was a bit cringe but honestly it was also kinda funny, hope they share it soon :)

Then it was time to get to learnnn! We went to the cluster and started registering on the intra (their online learning management system).. with my very limited coding background I had no idea what I was doing! 

I just stared at the screen ,randomly clicked around and hoped for the best... everyone seemed just as lost as I was and it turned into this cycle of people asking each other for answers and realizing no one knew what they were doing 😂

I only got to see the 404 cluster today but apparently there are more clusters in the building. There’s also a prayer room and a small cafeteria with basic snacks like noodles, water and coffee.. etc (don’t expect full healthy meals tho but it’s fine because there are many restaurants near the building..).. ((and you can pay with cash or Visa at the cafeteria so it’s pretty convenient))..

The place was super clean and they seem to care a lot about hygiene which I really appreciated.

However I noticed two things that could be improved, first there are no sleeping options, which can be difficult for people coming from outside Amman as getting back home late at night especially after 10-12 PM is tough due to limited transportation.. a sleeping area would really help them out. Second, there’s the parking issue (we’re not allowed to park in the building’s garage) so you’ll need to find a spot farther away :(

Other than that,, everything today was amazing!!  The experience was so much fun.

I will try to keep sharing my experiences here to help future 42 Amman pisciners. The program only started last year in Amman and it’s still pretty new so I hope my posts can help somone!

1hpeuvy,https://www.reddit.com/r/NewParents/comments/1hpeuvy/i_fucked_up_and_i_feel_terrible/,I fucked up and I feel terrible,"My hubby and I picked up this armchair that a neighbor was giving away. The legs aren’t very sturdy but I really liked it and because he uses the couch as a bed/coffee table and nightstand I don’t have a place to sit in the living room. Anyway I was sitting on it this afternoon and baby crawled over to the side of it and was fussing to be picked up, so I reached over and as soon as I began to lift him the chair tipped. In the panic of falling over I lowered him as much as I could and then let go. He fell back, hitting his head on the floor and I fell down with the chair. I immediately rolled onto the floor, and I realized his leg was pinned under it so I picked it up as fast as I could. I picked him up and consoled him and after the shock wore off he stopped crying. I checked his leg, wiggled his toes, squeezed all the little joints and everything and it seems completely fine. Also checked for signs of concussion and there were none. Hubby reassured me that he would have cried more and longer if he was seriously injured so we didn’t go t the ER over it but I’m still super stressed over the situation, partially wondering if I should have taken him to get checked out,especially after a reel randomly popped up in my feed about skull fractures, and partially because I should have known better than to put all that weight on the side of the chair knowing the legs weren’t stable and partially because I should have reacted better and gotten him farther away from it as it fell.

Outside, a thin layer of frost clung to the windshields of each campaign vehicle, and the air smelled faintly of pine and fresh snowmelt. it was 5:30 a.m. in the cold middle wof December, just days before the holiday season turned the highways into routes for families heading to gatherings or holiday travelers venturing to Big White, Whistler, the Cascades. This year, though, the holiday spirit mingled with the urgency of an unexpected election. The caravans of supporters, volunteers, local organizers, and community leaders all gathered near the motel parking lot, bundled in winter coats and gloved hands wrapped around take-out coffees.*

https://preview.redd.it/jm5n94jtww9e1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=f46384c873061c3666dbf4c1176a74aadf5378dc

""For weeks, the Conservatives had demanded an election, insisting that the current government lacked legitimacy or a strong mandate. Yet, once the date was set for December 30th, **timing they themselves had clamored for**, they abruptly complained about the inconvenience, the holiday hustle, and all manner of scheduling conflicts. Their leader, Hayley, who had loudly proclaimed the need for 'the people’s verdict,' was now conspicuously absent from large swaths of the campaign. Her deputy, FreedomCanada2025, spouted half-truths about 'zero accomplishments' from the Liberals while ignoring the reality of what had been delivered: more robust mental health funding, expansions to Canada’s naval capabilities, significant housing initiatives, broadband improvements, and the forging of local business and Chambers of Commerce of Municipalities. Many in the Conservative caucus either retreated to their ridings or simply vanished from public events, fueling rumors that even Danielle Smith in Alberta and François Legault in Quebec were warily distancing themselves from a federal Conservative platform (non-existant because Hayley disappeared) that threatened to strong-arm provinces via funding constraints.""

***5:45 a.m.*** — *The Liberals, however, led in Fraser-Columbia and the North by Prime Minister WonderOverYander, saw the moment as a chance to reach out to the furthest corners of the province: the small towns, agricultural lands, forest communities, and mountain outposts that often felt overshadowed by big-city politics. The plan for this day was massive: to make multiple stops across the Interior, hosting a marathon set of town halls that would culminate in an evening rally. It would be exhausting, sure, but no one on the team questioned the necessity. Canadians deserved transparency, direct engagement, and real solutions that addressed everything from mental health services and housing affordability to internet connectivity, Indigenous partnerships, and the environment.*

https://preview.redd.it/c7z6nw9uww9e1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=dcf3e912cc430e62a14ef3c2d1d6676a4416f7de

*Within the half-lit parking lot, still partially illuminated by a flickering neon motel sign, staffers bustled back and forth with clipboards. A large thermos of coffee sat on the hood of the lead SUV, from which the occasional bleary-eyed campaign operative refilled paper cups. The mood was purposeful, if somewhat groggy. Among them was WonderOverYander, swirling coffee in a styrofoam cup and flipping through notes on a tablet.*

“All right, folks,” *I said, softly but assertively, glancing at the cluster of volunteers.* “We have about a hundred kilometers to go before the first stop in Merritt. Let’s aim to be wheels-up by 6:00 a.m. I know it’s early, but we want to give ourselves plenty of time to set up for the town hall. The people of Merritt deserve a thorough conversation.”

*A few staffers nodded, adjusting backpacks and rummaging through boxes of campaign literature. The vehicles roared to life one by one, headlights piercing the faint morning gloom. And so began a day that would define the Liberals’ commitment to direct engagement, in stark contrast to the Conservative leader’s unexplained absence and the party’s internal fracturing.*

***6:00 a.m.*** — *By the time the small convoy left the motel, dawn had just begun to break, painting the horizon with slender lines of pale orange and violet. Rolling hills of the Interior gave way to mountainous terrain. Inside the lead vehicle, I scrolled through social media updates, noticing more stories about the Conservatives’ meltdown. One post suggested that even local Conservative candidates were struggling to keep their base energized when their own leadership offered such inconsistent messages. Another post reiterated how Danielle Smith in Alberta was suspicious of a federal Conservative plan that might cut provincial autonomy. Meanwhile, people like François Legault in Quebec had gone silent, which was almost as telling as any loud condemnation.*

*As the convoy navigated the winding roads, the discussion inside the SUV turned to the day’s talking points: mental health expansions, new phases of broadband projects, the continuing fallout of Phoenix Pay, and how to address everyday concerns about inflation and housing. The group rehashed stories of orchard owners in the Fraser Valley who had concerns about “pausing immigration,” a Conservative policy that would devastate local agriculture. They also pointed out the hypocrisy of the Conservatives labeling the Liberals as “corporatist” while referencing American populist leaders who had cozied up to major corporate tax breaks. Everyone nodded. They were on the same page: sincerity was the weapon of choice against the illusions swirling in the political sphere.*

**7:30 a.m.** *—* *The convoy pulled up to the Merritt Civic Centre. The building was a low-slung structure dotted with a few leafless trees. Volunteers on-site had set up chairs in neat rows and placed a modest podium at the front. A café that I hadn't had visited since 2021 had been kind enough to donate baked goods, which were laid out on a table near the door. Even though the event wasn’t due to start for another 30 minutes, a handful of Merritt residents were already milling around, sipping coffee and chatting. The sense of relief from seeing an active political presence was palpable: this small city, often overshadowed by bigger neighbors, rarely saw direct visits from high-profile leaders.*

**8:00 a.m.** *— When the event officially started, around 50 people had gathered in the hall. Some were ranchers concerned about land and zoning laws, others were local parents with strollers, and a few were older folks curious about how the Liberals intended to handle inflation. After brief introductions by a local volunteer, WonderOverYander took the podium.*

“Good morning, Merritt! I’m thrilled to be with you today,” *I began, scanning the crowd with a sincere smile.* “We’re traveling all over BC’s Interior because your voices matter. Too often, communities like Merritt are sidelined in high-level political debates. Well, not this time. We’re here to talk about what you need. That includes solutions for mental health, housing, stable internet connectivity, and ensuring that no party tries to bully the provinces or your local governments into compliance with some Ottawa-based scheme.”

*A smattering of applause followed. The mood was friendly yet inquisitive. People lined up to ask about everything from the recent push to tie federal infrastructure funding to municipal compliance on housing targets—something the Conservatives had proposed with an or-else twist—to how labor shortages might be solved with better immigration policies instead of shutting the door on newcomers. I answered carefully, emphasizing collaboration with local municipalities rather than threats, describing how mental health expansions could be scaled to smaller towns like Merritt, and promising that the Liberals would keep the door open for skilled immigrants while investing in training for local youth.*

*The session stretched longer than planned. After concluding, you spent nearly half an hour shaking hands, receiving business cards from local entrepreneurs, and promising to follow up with orchard owners who needed help navigating federal workforce programs. The sincerity from residents was humbling: they wanted real answers, not sound bites.*

**9:30 a.m.** *— A quick huddle after the town hall confirmed the next stop: Princeton, a town nestled between mountain ranges and known for its mining and resource-based economy. The morning sun was now full and bright, reflecting off the frost on the grasses, turning them a shimmering gold in the gentle breeze. In the lead vehicle, the team reviewed social media updates again. Another wave of questions about where the Conservative leadership had gone. Another mention that Conservative figures like Danielle Smith and François Legault were nowhere near their campaign events. Another group of orchard owners in the Okanagan posted concerns about a potential* “immigration shutdown.” *It was the same pattern: The vacuum of real Conservative leadership left people unsettled, searching for someone willing to address their anxieties.*

**10:45 a.m.** *— Princeton’s small main street exuded a friendly charm: older brick storefronts, a diner with a vintage neon sign, and a hardware store that had been around for generations. The campaign group pulled into a modest parking lot behind a town hall building. Inside, staffers set up the event quickly: a single microphone stand, a few rows of chairs, a simple sign reading* “Fraser-Columbia & The North: Talk with Your Prime Minister.”

*The turnout here was a bit smaller, maybe 35 people, but the conversation was no less spirited. A local teacher asked,* “What’s your plan for bridging the digital divide? My students struggle to do homework at home because the service is too slow. The Conservatives just talk about smaller government. How does that help my students?” *I explained how expansions to the Universal Broadband Fund had already rolled out in various areas, boosting speeds above that paltry 50/10 standard. Though progress was incremental, this was the difference between a stable, well-thought-out approach and the rhetorical emptiness of the other side.*

https://preview.redd.it/in6a222vww9e1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=637cff229317b8f4fdc191e624a63596f67b6ae4

*Someone else asked about forced rehabilitation programs. There was genuine confusion:* “Wait, the Conservatives think they can just force addicts into facilities? That might help some people, but what if the root issues remain unaddressed?” I echoed mental health experts that I spoke to at a health conference weeks before: ""forced rehab rarely works without supportive measures like therapy, community support, job opportunities, and stable housing. Meanwhile, the Liberals had invested in mental health expansions to reduce wait times, integrate community services, and treat mental health as a health issue, not a moral failing.""

**12:00 p.m.** *— After the town hall concluded, myself and a few headed to a small diner at a Greek restaurant across from the beach of Lake Okanagan. The place had checkered tablecloths and photos of Princeton from decades past. Over spinnich pie and pita bread, the conversation turned to the day’s schedule. The next major stop was Penticton, where an outdoor microphone had been set up near the lakeshore for a more informal, open-air Q&A. As I scrolled through: more social media chatter about the Conservatives....... People were noticing that when asked about real solutions, the Tories had little to say beyond* “lower taxes” *and* “pause immigration.”

**1:00 p.m.** *— The convoy hit the highway again, snaking through mountain passes and descending into the Okanagan region. Vineyards began to dot the hillsides, and lakes shimmered under the midday sun. Thoughts drifted to how the Conservatives might handle these local economies: they claim to be free-market champions, but they’re proposing to withhold federal transfers from provinces that don’t meet their one-size-fits-all plan. In an area as diverse as the Okanagan, that approach spelled trouble. People here needed a government that recognized local conditions, from orchard labor to wildfire concerns.*

*Meanwhile, I looked down at my phone as it buzzed with text messages from team members in other ridings who reported similar issues: The Conservative meltdown was not limited to Fraser-Columbia and the North. The entire party structure seemed fractured, with allies distancing themselves from Hayley’s centralizing mania and illusions of a Trump-style populism.*

**2:30 p.m.** *— By the time I arrived in Penticton, the sun was bright and warm for a December day, and the local Liberals had set up a small platform near a bustling waterfront walkway. Pedestrians strolled by, many stopping to see what the commotion was. Chairs were arranged on a patch of grass, each seat taking advantage of the view of Lake Okanagan’s sparkling waters. The turnout was a pleasant surprise: about 70 people came, including a cluster of students from nearby colleges, local retirees, orchard owners from the Naramata bench, and a handful of local health and other frontline workers.*

*Stepping up to the microphone, I waved warmly and heartedly.* “Penticton, thank you for welcoming me. Let’s talk about how we can keep this region prosperous, from your wine industry to your Naramata tourism, while ensuring that the climate crises we face, from wildfires to diminishing water resources: are tackled head-on. We can’t do that if we’re ignoring the environment or threatening to cut provinces out of the conversation. We can’t do that if we slash immigration so drastically that orchard owners, wineries, restaurants, and tech startups can’t find the workforce they need.”

*One student asked how the Liberals planned to address the rising cost of rent near the college, pointing out that wages hadn’t kept pace. Another orchard owner piped up about how they relied on skilled foreign labor and were terrified of* “pausing immigration.” *A nurse from the hospital voiced concerns about the mental health expansions:* “Is this real? Are we actually going to see more psychiatrists and social workers in small communities?” *I explained that the government had already directed funds for mental health expansions, including telehealth solutions, new clinics, and partnerships with provinces. The approach was cooperative. No top-down edicts that left communities out in the cold.*

*The open-air setting made the conversation feel casual yet direct. People passing on the walkway occasionally stopped, listened for a few minutes, and then asked spontaneous questions. The crowd’s energy was constructive and curious, exactly the opposite of the negative rancor some had come to associate with hyper-partisan politics. This was, in essence, my approach: open dialogue, respectful, and rooted in real solutions.*

**4:00 p.m.** *— With the Penticton event running over by half an hour, the team hustled to the next small gathering in West Kelowna, specifically to meet with Westbank First Nation. The drive was short but scenic, the winding highway hugging the lake. On the drive up 97C, I was mindful of the unique concerns of Indigenous communities, who have historically faced underfunded services, lack of consultation in resource management, and insufficient revenue-sharing agreements for major infrastructure.*

*At a cultural center in West Kelowna, a circle of Indigenous elders and community leaders welcomed the team. Over tea, they discussed the expansions to the Rapid Housing Initiative and how more funds could be directed toward on-reserve housing. They also touched on the Liberals’ evolving approach to legislation that recognized Indigenous rights to self-governance. One elder mentioned that the Conservative approach, with the threat of yanking federal funding for not toeing the line, was reminiscent of older assimilationist policies. Everyone in the circle nodded with a kind of resigned frustration. I made sure to assure them that collaboration, not coercion, was the bedrock of the government’s plan. People appreciated hearing that directly, though they also pressed for consistent follow-up, not just talk.*

**5:30 p.m.** *— As dusk fell, the team left West Kelowna for Kelowna proper, where a final, larger rally was planned in an indoor arena that had hosted everything from minor hockey games to craft fairs. I took a moment to reflect on the day: from Merritt to Princeton to Penticton to West Kelowna, the common refrain was that the Conservatives promised illusions, like the idea that halting immigration solves labor shortages, or that ignoring climate woes fosters economic growth, or that punishing provinces leads to better outcomes. Meanwhile, people wanted real leadership. They wanted local solutions, not authoritarian decrees.*

**6:30 p.m.** *— Volunteers had done a splendid job. The stage at one end of the small arena was decorated with a large banner reading, “Working for BC’s Interior. A Positive Way Forward!” Rows of folding chairs filled the floor space, while bleachers provided extra seating. Light music played over the PA system as supporters mingled. The turnout was impressive: local Liberals, curious residents, orchard operators, small-scale entrepreneurs, healthcare professionals, students. Some sported red scarves or hats with Liberal logos, but many were dressed simply in winter jackets, here to see for themselves if the government’s promises held water.*

**7:00 p.m.** *— As I stepped up onto the stage to warm applause. Cameras from Global Okanagan captured the scene. Over a thousand people, I believe some estimates said more but I won't split hairs here and there, filled the arena. The event opened with a short introduction by a local city council member who noted the region’s growth and the role of diverse immigrant communities in fueling that growth. Applause underscored that the crowd recognized the importance of immigration and fair provincial-federal relations.*

“Kelowna, I see your passion. I’ve seen it in your orchards, your wineries, your tech startups, your educational institutions. This region is proof of how collaboration, not fear, spurs growth. Yet while we fight to expand mental health care, solve housing shortages, and ensure local governments have the resources to build out infrastructure, the Conservatives are obsessed with illusions. They demanded an election, then abandoned the field. They demonize immigrants while ignoring local labor crises. They promise ‘no carbon taxes’ but no plan for dealing with wildfires or floods that cost you tens of millions. That’s not leadership, that’s escapism.”

*The crowd cheered as WonderOverYander laid out the Liberals’ accomplishments: expansions in broadband, strategic funds directed to mental health, the Rapid Housing Initiative’s direct partnership with cities like Kelowna to accelerate developments, and Canada’s improved naval capabilities, which, though not as pressing for an inland region, spoke to the general sense of national security and job creation. The next half-hour was a free-flowing conversation, a town-hall feel within a large rally. Attendees asked about the economy, the environment, local highways and emergency routes, flood and fire insurance, or the concerns about forced rehab. Each question was answered with a combination of referencing existing accomplishments and painting a vision for the future.*

**8:00 p.m.** *—* Inevitably, the subject of the Conservative meltdown came up from someone in the crowd: “Why do you think the Conservatives keep calling you an incompetent government with no record, when we can see local progress right here in Kelowna?”

*“Because illusions are easier to peddle than reality. The Conservatives claim we never had a budget, yet we governed responsibly under the Fiscal Management Act, directing funds to critical needs. They say we never addressed mental health, but we’ve poured millions into expansions that experts say are crucial. They say we did nothing on housing, yet hundreds of affordable units are coming online in BC’s Interior, thanks to our Rapid Housing Initiatives across Canada over the years. Meanwhile, they never mention how their own caucus is fracturing, with provincial leaders wary of them, and their own members are leaving the Conservative Party. That’s because it’s easier to keep lying than face the complexities of actual governance.”*

**8:20 p.m.** *—* As I invited longtime community leaders on stage, older than me by a long shot, I learned more about everyday people who had similar family stories to mine; an orchard worker who thanked the government for stable immigration policies that let her family settle; a mental health worker who praised improved funding for rural outreach clinics; a small business owner who got his start through a local initiative partially funded by the federal government. Each gave brief testimonials. The crowd applauded each story.

**8:45 p.m.** *—* Another short Q&A followed, which ended with a question from a local high school teacher from KSS: “How do we rebuild trust in politics when the Conservatives keep feeding fear, and when their own leader is MIA?”

*I paused as I scaned the crowd.* “We do it exactly like this,:by showing up, having honest conversations, acknowledging our missteps, and committing to doing better. We’re not perfect, but we’re here. In the Conservatives, we see a party so busy complaining about the election date and spouting illusions that they’re not even among us. Leadership means being present, confronting difficulties head-on, and working with the communities you serve, not against them. That’s how we restore trust.”

*A wave of applause filled the arena. People rose to their feet clapping, a powerful testament that even after hours of policy talk, they still believed in the capacity for constructive politics. The sense of relief, hope, and resolve was palpable.*

**9:10 p.m** *— After the rally, journalists from CBC Vancouver and Global News clustered around me near the edge of the stage. Microphones and phone recorders in hand, they peppered me with questions about everything from the day’s travels to the rumored infighting in the Conservative caucus. I made sure to calmly reiterate how this day of traveling to multiple town halls exemplified the Liberals’ approach: direct democracy, listening tours, respectful dialogue, and honesty. I made sure to ha,,er home that the Conservative meltdown (complete with deserted allies and absent leaders) signaled a lack of readiness to govern a complex country like Canada.*

*One journalist asked,* “But does the public truly notice the meltdown, or do they just see the short sound bites?” *I responded firmly:* “If the Conservatives truly wanted to serve Canadians, they’d be out here in the same communities we visited, presenting their ideas. They demanded an election, so we gave them one. Now, crickets from them. Canadians notice that. They notice who shows up and who disappears.”

**9:30 p.m.** *—* *I then spent the next 20 minutes shaking hands and taking photos. Some local families lingered, telling stories about adult children forced to move away for housing or about the heartbreak of mental health crises that the Conservatives’ forced rehab idea wouldn’t solve. Each story underlined how crucial it was for politicians to put aside the illusions. By 9:50 p.m., I can see my team was gently urging me to wrap up for the drive to the next stop on the campaign ot Ottawa.*

*The caravan pulled away from the arena around 10:00 p.m., heading to a small lakeside hotel for the night. In the lead SUV, I debriefed with AGamerPwr, Miles, Wanuke, and Zetix; reflecting on the day. How the morning started in Merritt with real talk about mental health, then Princeton’s questions on forced rehab, Penticton’s orchard owners worried about “pausing immigration,” West Kelowna’s Indigenous leaders seeking genuine partnerships, and finally the grand rally in Kelowna. Each stop testified to the real difference between hollow rhetoric and the messy, earnest reality of public service.*

**10:30 p.m.** *— Upon arrival at the cozy lakeside lodge, staffers were already planning the next day’s route, communities further east, or maybe north toward Salmon Arm again, or a final pass through the Shuswap region. Inside a modest conference room by the hotel lobby, I and my staff huddled over laptops. They reviewed how each town hall Q&A went, which recurring questions emerged, and how best to refine messaging. Some staffers reported that Conservative presence was minimal to non-existent in these areas. I nodded, a mixture of gratitude and exasperation. This was a democracy, after all, why were the self-appointed Conservative “saviors” nowhere to be seen?*

*A younger staffer chimed in,* “You know, it’s wild how each place asked about mental health expansions, about stable broadband, about how forced rehab won’t solve addiction. It’s the same concerns. And the Conservatives have no real plan except sound bites.”

“Exactly,” *I replied, pinching the bridge of his nose from exhaustion.* “That’s the consistent thread: People see through illusions. They prefer a complicated but honest approach. The Conservatives are retreating because they can’t provide that.”.

*Outside, a thin crescent moon rose over the lake, the water reflecting a shimmering path of lunar light. I shut off the overhead light, leaving only the soft glow of a desk lamp. In the stillness, the weight of the day’s conversations pressed on: it was exhilarating yet exhausting to witness how each town’s unique struggles mirrored the broader national conversation. The day’s events had combined to form a tapestry of authentic democracy, despite the absence of a robust Conservative showing.*

*With a long exhale, I flicked off the desk lamp and made their way to the assigned hotel room. Tomorrow would be another early morning, another set of communities, another forum for direct engagement. But the momentum was real. People saw that leadership wasn’t about rhetorical magic or illusions. It was about being there, fielding tough questions, acknowledging uncertainties, and building trust. The Conservatives had abandoned that approach, focusing on illusions and negativity, apparently fracturing from within.*

*The Liberals, proud to have an actual record, unafraid to face the electorate, carried on. This day, from Merritt at dawn to the grand Kelowna rally by night, had been testament to the difference: illusions vs. engagement, fear vs. sincerity, retreat vs. presence. If the Conservatives were in retreat, the Liberals were surging forward, mile by mile, conversation by conversation, forging a path that many in BC’s Interior found refreshing and honest.*

*And at the stroke of midnight, I rested in a quiet hotel room, penning my final thoughts in a personal journal I've kept since young adulthood.*

“December’s campaign, day’s end. We visited five communities: Merritt, Princeton, Penticton, West Kelowna, Kelowna; talked with hundreds. Over and over, they fear the damage from forced rehab, halting immigration, or tying provincial hands with big rhetorical threats. They see the hollowness in the Tories. They see our record, not perfect but tangible. They see me, in person, addressing them, not hiding behind a microphone and attacking from afar. This is how we move forward. **One day, one conversation, one handshake at a time.**”

*With that, I closed today's journal, hopeful for the next day’s itinerary. They laid down with the knowledge that while the Conservatives retreated, the Liberals had advanced physically, and philosophically, through the heart of BC’s Interior, ensuring no illusions overshadowed the real issues. The day’s 18 hours of democracy in action had left them both tired and immensely gratified, convinced that Canadians, when shown sincerity, reject illusions every time.*

I suffered from chronic headaches as a kid, and Alex lost time a lot, sometimes blanking out whole days. According to Alex, it was like being switched off. 

Due to his condition, the boy fell asleep a lot, sometimes tumbling down the stairs during his episodes, which meant he was always in the nurse’s office with  a head injury, or curled into a ball snoozing. 

I wasn't as sick as Alex, but I liked to sleep off my headaches in the nurse’s office and would wake to Alex playing Pokémon on the bed next to mine. 

Other times, he would be sitting on the observation bed with his knees drawn to his chest. Alex wasn't a fan of shots. 

I discovered that when I was torn from a headache induced sleep to his blood curdling wails. 

I thought for *sure* he was dying, until I glimpsed the shot in Nurse Golding’s hand. Initially, I wasn't surprised the kid was screaming, she was trying to stab the thing into the back of his head.

Though, after reassuring me it was part of Alex’s treatment, she calmly told me to distract the boy while she administered his daily shot. 

I panicked and attempted a puppet show with my hands. Alex was so confused by whatever I was trying to do, he stopped screaming, frowning at me like I had grown a second limb. 

It worked! Kind of. Nurse Golding was ruffling his hair and calling him brave, when Alex’s eyes widened, his hand going to the back of his head. 

He started wailing again, but this time I was pretty sure it was for attention. 

Alex definitely had his eyes on the tub of candy the nurse kept on her top shelf. 

Alex made me feel better about my headaches.

I found his company comforting, and we became sick-buddies.

Sometimes, his other friends would slip into the nurse’s office to prod him and tease him, and I felt a little left out. The two of them paid no attention to me, focusing on annoying Alex. 

Growing up, we both got progressively better. Alex’s episodes decreased to one a month, and my headaches were easier to tolerate. The two of us still ended up in the nurse’s office, but for different reasons. I accidentally shoved a needle through my finger during arts and crafts, and was too shocked to cry. 

Alex had fallen over during gym, and had the *tiniest* scratch on his leg, which set off the waterworks. 

When Nurse Golding was trying to rip the needle out of my finger with tweezers, Alex was *demanding* she replaced his bandaid. 

Starting middle school, the two of us came face to face with Nurse Jane. 

She was terrifying, as well as completely incompetent. There was no candy in her office, and her solution to a girl in my class breaking her arm, was *“Put a wet piece of tissue paper on it”*

Alex tried the, *I'm sooo sick!* thing, and Nurse Jane spent half an hour lecturing him about healthy food. 

He returned to class miraculously cured, looking paler than he did before visiting her. 

Neither of us dared enter Nurse Jane’s office, unless we were really sick. 

We were ten when Alex threw a ball of paper at me, hitting me in the face. 

I was about to throw it back, when the boy twisted around in his seat and motioned for me to unravel the paper. 

He had scribbled a funny picture of Nurse Jane being blown up into a balloon. 

Underneath, written in bright red crayon: 

**DO YOU WANT TO PLAY WITH US?** 

**YES [ ]**

**NO   [ ]**

At first, I was hesitant. 

I told him I'd think about it, so he came straight to my house himself. 

I didn't even know he knew my address. 

“Why don't you want to play?” Alex asked through a mouthful of chocolate chip cookies. Mom had given him a plate to take up to my room. 

Hiding behind him were his two friends, Lucy Conrad, a curly haired brunette with ribbons in her pigtails, and Ki Jacobs, the foreign exchange kid from Australia. 

The three of them already seemed like a tight knit group in class, sending each other notes and giggling. 

I wasn't sure I wanted to be the odd one out in their little gang. 

Still though, Alex was insistent that I join them. 

So, I did. The three invited me to the town’s summer festival, and I had so much fun I forgot why I was scared of ruining their friendship. Ki choked on his Coke float, which shouldn't have been funny, but it was his over-reaction that sold me. The rest was history. 

Initially, I was kind of hesitant, only hanging out with them on select days, making sure not to be *too* invasive. 

Mom warned me that joining an already established friendship group was dangerous, on account of me potentially being left out. 

She had horror stories from her own teenagehood, where she was the fourth member in a group of girls, who turned on her for their own entertainment, inviting her to slumber parties for the sole purpose of bullying her. 

But that wasn't what we were. Mom’s warning scared me and I waited for Alex to start teasing me about my big nose, or my overly large front tooth. 

He didn't even notice my tooth until I told him, so he opened his mouth and prodded at his own molars, teasingly calling them horse teeth. Alex said he didn't care what I looked like. 

Eventually, the barriers I had built began to crumble, and I started to see these kids as real, proper friends. 

I was invited to play every day, the four of us venturing across town to swim in the lake or hunt for buried treasure with a map Ki *definitely* didn't print off of Google. Mom was wrong. 

I was never left out. If I didn't turn up to our secret spot in the forest, the three of them would walk straight through my front door— and when I was a little older, Alex grew brave, climbing through my bedroom window, dragging me out of bed himself. 

When I was sick with the flu, the three insisted on sitting with me (keeping a safe distance) and watching Disney movies with me all day. 

They all got sick too, so eventually, the three crawled into bed with me.

With my Mom’s words still haunting the back of my mind, part of me expected them to blow me off one day. 

In the summer before seventh grade, Ki invited me, along with the others, to his parent’s house in Thailand. 

I think *that* is when it started to hit me.

The four of us getting *stupidly* drunk and lying on the beach, exchanging ghost stories that weren't remotely scary, sending us into fits of hysteria. 

*This* wasn't whatever Mom talked about. I don't think Mom *had* friends. 

This was *best friends*. 

Entering teenagehood, we made that declaration, on my fifteenth birthday, drinking milkshakes at the diner and trying to hide our tipsy giggles from the booze Ki had taken from his father’s drinks cabinet. We went skinny dipping in the lake, and I had my first kiss. 

I went to summer camp, returning to town three weeks later, not to my mother (who had forgotten I was coming home) but to my three idiot friends who made me promise I would never leave for camp ever again. 

I wasn't planning on it. The other kids called me Wobbly Legs because I couldn't balance on the tree swing, and two campers were suspended for *inappropriate behavior* in the lake. 

Mom and Dad treated the others like their own children, even giving them each a house key (so Alex didn't have to brave tumbling through my window). 

He hit his head once, knocking the back of his skull on my new makeup table, and my Mother almost had a panic attack. 

This didn't stop him, though. 

I think my best friend had grown accustomed to slipping through my window at midnight, armed with a  flashlight and my favorite candy bars. 

I thought we were going to last forever, until we were old, reminiscing our childhoods under a late setting sun. 

But that wasn't the real world. 

Halfway through my senior year, I lost my parents to a seventeen year old drunk driver. 

Jason Chatham, who already went to juvie for intentionally running over a cat, was the mayor’s son, so Jason got a reduced sentence and four weeks of community service. 

He gave me a bullshit ‘apology’ and was forced to beg for forgiveness, despite smirking through the whole court trial. 

Jason was sent abroad to college, and my parents’ funeral wasn't even an open casket. 

Apparently, there wasn't much left to bury. I couldn't even afford the fucking funeral, it was the *town* that paid. 

I had no other relatives. There was just me, Mom, and Dad. 

Alex, Lucy, and Ki stayed by my side the whole time, but I barely talked to them. I was numb, my body felt detached and wrong, like it didn't exist. 

Time moved far too slowly. 

I was burying my parents, a shovel stuck in my clammy hands, and then it was pitch black, and I was sitting in a random alleyway, my head spinning, halfway through a bottle of whisky. 

It tasted like poison, but it also stopped me thinking for a while. 

Alex found me, still in his funeral attire. I wasn't sure why he had his tie wrapped around his head, though. He didn't hug me or tell me it was going to be okay.

Alex snatched the booze, took a long swig, and then threw it over his shoulder. 

I don't know why I found the sound of the bottle splintering on the ground so funny, but I burst into hysterical giggles that felt *real* and a relief. I didn't cry like I expected. 

I stood up, throwing out my arms to keep my balance.

“You're a loser.” I told him, trying not to slur my words.

Alex nodded at my dress. Lit up in the glow of a nearby streetlight, I realized my best friend’s eyes were red from crying, his lip wobbling. The idiot was trying so fucking hard to pretend we were okay, and failing miserably. 

His blondish brown curls were sticking up everywhere. 

I could tell he had been running his hands through it. 

Alex was far too empathetic, sucking up my emotions. 

“And you're covered in barf.” 

His voice was shaking, but Alex was still smiling. 

He held his hand out for me to grab, and I hesitated, just like when I was a little kid. But I needed him. I knew that, even in my unstable mind full of black and white and a slowly spreading numbness threatening to swallow me whole. Mom and Dad were gone, and he was all I had. 

The town would go back to their day-to-day lives, and I would break apart. I considered following them in a brief episode of psychosis. 

The only people who could pull my head from the fog were my friends.

So, I grabbed Alex’s hand, clinging onto him for dear life like I was going to lose him too. 

I expected the whole, *I'm so sorry for your loss* bullshit I had been suffocating in all day, but Alex talked about birds instead. I don't know why, and it's not like he was making any sense, trying to unsuccessfully name different kinds. 

But it was enough. 

Alex’s stupid rant about birds distracted me from drowning myself in poison. 

He took me back to his place, ordered my favorite pizza, and pretended I didn't just lose my parents. 

Ki and Lucy joined us, and at first it was awkward and I was still drunk, still demanding he give me back my whisky. 

Then, though, the night devolved into our usual antics, and for the first time since my parent’s death, I was laughing. 

That night ended however, and once the hysteria had died down and my hangover was gone, reality hit like a wave of ice water. The world bled into black and white, and not even pills could help, so shut myself away. 

I finished my senior year with my diploma sitting in my mailbox with a letter from the school expressing how *sorry* they were for my loss. I tore it up, setting fire to the remnants. I was so fucking SICK of *sorry*. The word *condolences* didn't even sound real anymore. 

Leaving town seemed like the best idea for a fresh start. The night before I left, I crept through Alex’s bedroom window. 

I did tell him and the others I needed space, drunkenly shouting at them to leave me alone when they found me sleeping in our old childhood tree house. 

That night, I woke him up, wrapping my arms around him and thanking him for being my friend. 

Alex was half asleep, mumbling at me to join him, and I did, keeping a tight hold of him all night. 

It was supposed to be a goodbye. I wasn't planning on coming back to a town that had murdered my parents. 

And protected their killer. 

But it's hard to say a real goodbye. 

When I left for college, Alex and the others promised they would text and call every day. Lucy expected daily updates, and Ki was obsessed with my roommate's secret hamster she was hiding under her bed. 

We stayed in touch, initially. 

I couldn't just let them go. I was planning on inviting them for drinks, and having one last memory. 

I facetimed them during the campus tour, showing them my room and exploring the city. 

I was waiting to declare some kind of friendship ending speech, but, I guess moving away was a natural killer. 

I started ignoring calls, responding in one word answers to their texts. 

Two months into  college, I had new friends, new experiences, and I wasn't the girl who's parents died. 

Alex proposed in a long paragraph text that they come visit and stay in my room, and I had to keep making excuses as to why it was a bad idea. 

Listen, I was the bad friend. 

I know that now. I don't blame them for being pissed, but ignoring me for five years was taking it too far.

Presently, I had called Alex a grand total of 35 times. 

He wasn't picking up the phone, and I was left to a robot voice telling me to leave a message, after Alex’s voice from five years ago called me a donut. 

*“Hey, you've reached Alex! Don't expect me to answer the phone. It's not 1993. Just text me!”*

Which was ironic considering my texts weren't being delivered. 

I had zero choice but to go down the boomer route. 

Initially, I knew what I was going to say and how I was going to say it, but by the fifth attempt, my voice was shaking. 

“Hey, me again.” I said through gritted teeth, kicking through leaves. “You probably didn't get my last, uh, thirty four calls, because you're busy, or…whatever…”

I trailed off, clenching my phone tighter. 

“Anyway! How have you been? Uh, we’re both adults now, but I figured we should maybe, uhhh, talk… maybe?”

Alex was surely ignoring me. 

Again, I didn't blame him. We were adults with our own lives. The problem was, I had zero idea what Alex had been doing the last five years because he was MIA. Alex’s social media hadn't been updated in years, and I was pretty sure he'd just made new ones. 

The same went for Ki and Lucy. 

His last text, (We need to talk) didn't even make sense without a follow up, and now I was back home in a town I didn't want to be in, stuck in a dead end job I hated, trying to pick up the splintered pieces. 

I was aware of my colleague yelling my name, dropping my cigarette and stomping on the cinders. “I really need to talk to you,” I didn't realize I was crying until I was swiping at my eyes. 

Sometimes, life doesn't always work out the way you planned it. 

“I know it's been a while since you uh, stopped texting me or whatever…” I let out a choked cough. “Which is my fault, by the way,” my chest was aching, 

“But I've actually come home!” I tried to laugh, but it was more of a sob. “Yeah, it turns out NY wasn't really my scene.”

That was a lie, though Alex was probably used to me lying. 

Sometimes, life doesn't work out. 

After graduating college, I was offered a job in New York, only for it all to fall through when depression hit. The world turned black and white, and I rotted in bed all day. I quit my part time job, packed up my stuff, and came home. 

I had been staying in the motel on the edge of town for a while, planning to move back into my parents house. 

But knowing my friends were still in town, and intentionally ignoring me, I was taking my time. 

*I wanted to hear his voice.*

Five years was a long time. 

“I'm staying at my parents' old house, so maybe come see me sometime?” I blurted out, studying the sky above me. 

Cotton candy clouds we used to pretend to eat. 

“You've still got the key my Mom gave you, right?”

It was unusually cold for April. I had to keep pulling my jacket around me.

“Alex, I really fucking miss you.” I whispered. I wanted to tell him that I needed him, just like when I was seventeen. That he was the only thing keeping me afloat. “I miss you, Ki, and Lucy, so call me, okay?” I paused. “I know you're mad, but we can talk it out, all right? Just text me, and I'll be there.”

“Eleanor.” My colleague was grumbling behind me, “Your break is over.”

I tapped my screen impatiently. “I’m coming,” I said, “Alex, I've got to go, all right? Call me when you get this.”

When the line went dead, I shoved my phone in my pocket and resumed selling coffee to dead eyed customers. 

I recognised Mrs Morris, the lady who lived opposite Mom and Dad. She offered me a smile, but her eyes were so sad. 

I could practically sense her knee-jerk reaction to say, *I'm sorry for your loss*. 

I handed the woman her usual, a black coffee, trying to ignore the way she clasped her wrinkly hands around mine, squeezing for dear life. 

*Maybe her husband died….*

“Have  you seen Alex anywhere?” I asked, wiping down the counter. 

The woman's expression crumpled. “I'm sorry, *who*, dear?”

“Alex.” I said, “Alex Locke? You used to give us candy when we were kids.”

Mes Morris inclined her head. There was something odd about her expression. “Oh, the Locke’s moved away a long time ago,” she hummed, “I haven't seen them in years, tweety pie.”

The nickname brought back memories. Mrs Morris used to call me Tweety Pie. 

I nodded, pouring her a refill. “Is Alex still in town, though?”

“Hm?”

“Alex.” I said, growing slightly impatient, “Their son, Alex Locke?”

Her eyes darkened, suddenly hollow, like I was talking to a memory. She was looking straight through me like we were back at my parent’s funeral. Mrs Morris wore a rose in my Mom’s honor. 

“I’m so sorry for your loss,” she said softly, “It was… so terrible what happened,” her expression seemed to twitch, and a shiver creeped down my spine. “God rest their beautiful souls.”

I had grown accustomed to tuning out condolences. 

“Yes, I miss them,” I said dismissively, leaning over the counter. “But have you seen Alex? What about Ki and Lucy? I've been in town for a while, but I can't get in touch with them.”

Instead of answering, the corners of her mouth curved into a small smile. “You look so much like your mother, Eleanor.”

“Thanks.” I gave up, forcing a smile.  

“Eleanor.” her face crumpled, “Such a bright young girl.”

My stomach knotted. “No, Mrs Morris, you mean my Mom.”

She blinked, sipping her coffee. “Hm? Oh, yes, yes! My condolences!”

I got the same response from patrons I used to know. 

Townspeople blatantly ignoring my question, throwing me a fucking pity party for a loss I hadn't exactly gotten over, but over time, the pain was getting easier to deal with. 

Grief never leaves you, but time can force you to move forwards instead of dwelling on the past. 

Halfway through my shift, my colleague plonked a basket of flowers on the counter, where I was trying and failing to perfect a foam heart for a teenage girl who was definitely judging my ‘art’ skills. 

The basket of flowers was full of roses, my mother’s favorite. 

Alex planted them in her yard when we were thirteen, surprising her for her birthday. There was a little card attached to the flowers, and I ripped it off, my heart beating out of my chest. 

To my dismay, though, it wasn't Alex’s handwriting. 

Unless Alex had taken up calligraphy in his five year absence. 

*Eleanor,*

*I'm so happy to see you again in town! I hope you like the flowers. I know they were your sweet late mother’s favorite. 
I have left a surprise for you inside your parents house. It's not a lot, of course, but I want you to know you are never alone, sweetheart. I will always be here.*

*Enjoy your surprise. You will never be alone again.*

*With so much love, and much needed hugs.*

*A friend.*

“Who sent this?” I asked, re-reading the note. To my confusion, there was a box of headache pills. I hadn't suffered from headaches since I was a kid, but it was when I was sliding my fingers over the box, a dull thrum pounded across the back of my skull. I trashed the pills, dumping the basket in my work locker. 

My colleague shrugged. “I dunno. Someone left it on one of the tables.”

“So, it wasn't a guy?” I said, gingerly rubbing my forehead. 

He shrugged. “I don't know what they looked like, I didn't even see someone coming in.”

That night, following the note’s instructions, I returned home to an empty house, letters for repossession piled on the floor. 

I broke down somewhere between walking into the kitchen and seeing five year old milk sitting on the counter, and exploring my childhood room, the marks I scratched into the wall to track my height progress. It was so cold. 

So *empty*.

Without Mom and Dad, there was no light. 

The house was just one dark, empty memory of what *had* been. Switching on the lights, I tried to make it at least a little homely. I ordered pizza and ate it staring at my phone, waiting for a text from Alex. When my phone *did* vibrate, I almost jumped out of my skin. 

Just the Uber Eats guy requesting a tip, which I'm pretty sure wasn't allowed. 

I was unpacking in my room when a voice came from downstairs. 

*“Ella! Holy shit, you didn't tell us you were coming home!”*

Alex. 

The crumpled pair of pants I had been folding slipped out of my hands. 

I felt like I couldn't breathe, stumbling downstairs. 

His voice sent pinpricks through me. 

“Alex?” 

The hallway was empty, a chill grazing my cheeks. 

“Ella! I'm so glad you're home! Don't ever go away again!”

I froze.

“Where are you?” I managed to get out. 

“We’re down here!”

The voice was coming from the basement. 

It was when I was slowly making my way down the stairs, my phone vibrated with a text. I was reaching for it, when it vibrated again, and again, and again, buzzing in my pocket. 

Pulling it out, I found myself staring at a multitude of text messages.

**05/07/2019: We need to talk, Ella. Did you get my last text?**

**05/07/2019: I've been feeling weird lately. Like I did as a kid. I keep switching off, Ella. There's something wrong. I don't know what it is, but we need you here.**

**05/07/2019: Ella, please. The cops are brushing us off, but there's something going on. We need you here. NOW.**

**05/13/2019: Can you call your local sheriff department? Anyone?! STOP IGNORING MY CALLS!**

**05/16/2019: Ella, you're fucking killing me. Do you not care? Are you really going to abandon us?**

**05/16/2019: Ella, are you there? I'm really cold.**

**05/16/2019: It's dark.**

**05/16/2019: It's so dark, I can't see I don't understand what's happening Please can you come and help me? I'm so cold and it's dark and I can't can't I need you to take me home Ella please**

**06/05/2020: I like that you're so close to me. It's not cold when you're here.**

**06/05/2020: Sshshhh! She's coming! Act natural Sit up straight No, not like that Like this!**

**06/05/2020: wait where did you go? Ella where did you go Ella where did you go Ella where did you go Ella**

For a moment, I was hypnotised by the texts, my hands trembling. 

Alex *did* send follow up messages. 

But I never got them. 

“Ella, we’re wait... ING. Come on, we’ve missed you so much!”

Alex’s voice should have made me happy. 

But I recognised it, phantom bugs creeping down the exposed flesh of my arms and filling my mouth. 

Prom night, junior year. 

He was standing at the bottom of my stairs wearing a suit and tie. *Ella, we’re waiting!”* was from that night.

When my phone flashed again, I ignored it, forcing my legs to move down the stairs. 

My basement was exactly how I left it, a mess of boxes and my old bike. 

Except, sitting in the corner were three figures drowned in shadow. There was a light, something illuminating the dim. 

But I was already stumbling over to my friends, who looked exactly the way I left them, frozen at eighteen years old. 

Their skin was pale, papery thin and wrong. 

“There… you… are!” 

Alex lifted his head, half lidded eyes finding mine. “Aren't… you… happy to see… us?” 

His lips were barely moving. I glimpsed the start of decomposition melting into his face, eating away at his flesh, tiny holes where maggots had burrowed inside him. His hair was matted with old blood, where someone had tried and failed, and then tried again to violently force a device inside his head, long orange wires sticking from his spine.

I could see where he'd struggled, rusted handcuffs still coiled around his wrists, an unnatural light illuminating his iris. 

Something warm crept up my throat. 

The glow illuminating the room was emanating from his eyes. I could see straight through him, his body more of a science experiment where his skull had been forced open, an electronic device woven inside the dead flesh of his brain. 

Whoever did this to him saw Alex as nothing more than arts and crafts, flesh and bone to cruelly mould. 

I was too numb to scream, my body stiff. 

He lifted his head, blinking at me, like he was still alive.

“Fi…nally,” he choked through a  mouthful of oozing black, “You're…home.”

I *knew* his voice that had been cruelly stitched and knitted together. 

He greeted me when I came back from summer camp with the exact words. 

*“Finally!”* Alex had cried, wrapping his arms around me. *“You're hOme!”*

I could hear where his words had been cut and sliced, glued to each other to sound like a coherent fucking sentence.

“I've… been… wAiting for… you.”

The boy’s lips stretched into a grin. “For… you… tO see yoUR… big… sur…prise!”

Every word had been handpicked directly from his memories. 

I took slow steps back, tripping over something on the ground.

A Macbook. 

There was a sticky note attached. 

**Here's another surprise! There's a USB wire on the floor somewhere, sweetie! I forgot to update them, so feel free! I hope you enjoy your surprise as much as I enjoyed making them!**

Feeling sick to my stomach, I switched the laptop on. 

The USB was across the room. I could see the end stained vivid scarlet.

There were three folders. 

**2019.**

**2020.**

**2021.**

There was another separate folder.

**2007.** 

I clicked into it, a list of names coming up.  

I was loading into Alex’s name, when Lucy spoke. 

“What… are… you… waiting… for?” 

Her giggle was half human, and half not, a crackle of laughter and static. 

I knew her voice, and it fucking hurt. 

My 12th birthday, Lucy stood at the table in front of a giant chocolate cake. *“What are you waiting for?” she teased. “Blow out your candles!”*

When she *did* lift her head, my best friend’s face was bruised and battered. 

Ki’s grinning lips were skeletal, his head split in two, held together with duct tape. The way he was slumped, swaying back and forth, his head of thick curls glued to his head, made me sick to my stomach. 

“UPDATE…us.”

Ki’s words had been ripped straight from years ago, when he yelled at me for annoying him to play Minecraft. 

*My computer is UPDATING! Jeez, be patient!”*

Whoever did this to them made my friends suffer. 

I cupped Alex’s cheeks, and his skin was ice-cold.

“Who did this to you?”

He responded with a smile. 

“Not…telling...y–”

*”I'm not telling you!”* I remembered his tone from back in school. I begged him for answers to the chemistry test. 

It was like talking to not just a corpse, but the corpse of a memory too. 

I pulled out my phone to call the cops, when my phone flashed again. 

**Unknown number** 

*Update them! I can assure you, if you don't, I will happily add you to my collection, Eleanor. This time I won't let you go. Check the second folder*. 

They were watching me. 

I glimpsed a single red light blinking on the ceiling. 

Taking the laptop, I left my friends, and called the cops. 

“No, that's not how this is going to go.” 

The voice was sugary sweet through my phone, intercepting the call. 

I recognised her. 

Nurse Golding, from Kindergarten. 

“Update your friends,” she told me in a shrill laugh, “I made them very specially for you, Eleanor. I worked tirelessly, every day and night to make sure you came back to your friends.”

She paused. 

“You're not lonely anymore, are you?  Of course, if you don't want to be grateful, I can always revert you back–”

I ended the call, throwing up everywhere. 

Somehow, I found myself back in the basement, my breaths heavy. 

I planned to destroy the laptop, and set fire to the house, when something caught my eye. 

I didn't notice until I was fully looking at my friends.

There were three of them, and four chairs against the wall. 

*Four* rusted handcuffs. 

I think I've been here before, but how? When? 

How can I not remember it? 

I keep thinking back to my childhood. Alex was losing time. 

Is that what happened to me? 

Edit: since writing the above, six townspeople have told me to update my friends. All of them are the older residents in the diner. I keep coming down here, but I can't fucking do it. 

I *can't* do this.
