""Final comms buoy placed, sir,"" the isolan sensor tech said. ""It's coming online now.""

""Good work, Gofsun,"" Henskin said. ""Sir?""

Henskin and I made eye contact, and the briefest of smiles played across his features. My frown only served to deepen his smile. We had made a bet to see who could figure out the isolan's name first, without looking it up or asking directly.

The bet was a foolish one for me. Henskin is not only more sociable than I am, but also of a rank that requires frequent interaction with the rest of the crew. Now, the coffee pot would have to stay in the mess for three whole days. I glanced at the elixir-producing device that was currently mag-locked to the floor next to my seat.

""Yes, excellent work,"" I said with a carefully neutral tone. ""Once connection is established, perform the standard security checks and let Overwatch know that we've made it with no issues.""

Henskin stared at me. I glared back, and took a sip of my coffee. The cogs in his head were turning, trying to find a way to bring up the bet. To take away the thing dearest to me.

""Sir..."" He began hesitantly.

""Fine. You can fucking take it,"" I growled. ""But, so help me, if I find that you cheated somehow the combined forces of all the gods of every species to ever exist won't be able to save you from my wrath.""

Henskin stood and walked over to my seat with exaggerated formality. He stood next to the coffee pot, snapped to attention, saluted, then bent over and disengaged the mag-lock. He lifted the contraption with a grin on his face.

""Posture and poise, sir,"" he said.

I feigned a lunge and he jumped back, laughing. He jogged to safety, and left the bridge with the coffee pot. As the doors closed, I let out a deep sigh.

""So what are we seeing?"" I asked the sensor technicians.

""No activity anywhere nearby, even relatively speaking,"" Lieutenant Gofsun reported as a grid appeared on my terminal.

The grid was a 2D representation of our tactical coordination system, as viewed from the positive Z axis. Very useful for mapping, less useful in a fight where you need to know the relative position of your enemy. I prefer to use the tac-map, but the techs were having trouble learning how.

Each of the tiny squares on the thousand by thousand grid represents one light-year. The nearest marker was at least one hundred and fifty light years away. I wouldn't exactly call that far away, but relativity is relative, I suppose.

The Republic isn't as advanced as the United Systems, so even little things like distance have different expectations attached to them. So Gofsun's probably right, by Republic standards. Something about the map struck me as strange, though, but I couldn't quite put my finger on it...

""Are we still in deep space?"" Yorvi asked. ""I'm not seeing any nearby stars.""

There it is. This map represents an area of one million light years squared. The odds of not seeing a single star-system feel like they should be low.

""Omega, what are we looking at?"" I asked. ""Where are the stars?""

""I don't know,"" the AI replied. ""Even if we were between galaxies, it isn't typical to run across an area of space this large without any celestial bodies in it. But that's based on the portion of the universe we've observed thus far. It's possible that things are simply more spread out here.""

""Dead space,"" Bon muttered and shuddered.

""Regardless, we need to get an idea of what the Omni-Union is up to out here. Inform the carriers of our intentions and let's go peeping.""

""Aye aye, sir!""

A bustle of activity spread throughout the crew as I chose a section of the map with what appeared to be the least amount of enemy activity. It's best to ease into things, especially since we have a lot of new faces. Better to run from a thousand than a million if someone makes a mistake.

It would have to be one hell of a mistake, though. The designer of this ship definitely knew what makes a ship visible and did everything they could to make the Strandhogg the opposite. They'd even painted the hull black, which is hilarious.

As I was ruminating over the comedic nature of how overdone our stealth was, Henskin reentered the bridge and marched up to my chair. I regarded him coldly, as he had just made my life that much more difficult by halting my easy access to coffee. With a grin, he snapped to attention and saluted.

""Sir, the coffee pot is stowed away in its proper location,"" he said.

I let him stand there with his hand on his forehead for a few seconds before halfheartedly returning his salute.

""Very good, Henskin. Return to your duties,"" I growled.

""You know, you could just file form 210.68-56G and have the coffee pot officially transferred to the bridge,"" Omega said just loud enough for the two of us to hear.

Henskin and I stared at each other, and our expressions swapped. His devilish grin dropped into an angry grimace and my angry grimace rose into a devilish grin.

""The bet, sir,"" he said in a carefully measured tone.

""The bet, Commander Henskin, was that the coffee pot would, and I quote, 'return to its rightful place'. If I file this form, its rightful place will become the bridge.""

""Damn my inherent eloquence.""

""Indeed.""

""But, sir, we both know that such an action would not be in the spirit of the wager. You made a bet and lost, and as such should lose something.""

""Ah, but one of the core concepts of betting is outwitting one's opponent. Whilst you have performed the feat that the wager required, your demand was made in such a way that it can be avoided. Should you not face some form of loss as a result of this oversight?""

""Good to enter warp, sir,"" a slightly confused Lt. Commander Yorvi said.

""Go on,"" I replied with a nod.

""While that may be the case, sir, I'm afraid that in a bet between two officers the first and foremost thing that must be observed is honor,"" Henskin explained as he returned to his seat. ""Especially since seeing you, the captain of our vessel and the paragon of our crew, swindle your way out of a bet may harm crew morale.""

""Where did you learn the word paragon?"" I asked, narrowing my eyes.

""Word-a-day calendar, sir,"" he replied with a grin. ""My point still stands, though.""

""Fine. A compromise, then. A day and a half, then I file the form.""

Henskin thought about it for a moment, then shrugged nonchalantly.

""Deal, sir,"" he said as we exited subspace.

My eyes darted to our read-outs. The burst of radiation from our FTL jump was properly absorbed and distributed by our hull. It shouldn't be a matter of concern because we're also outside of the projected sensor range of the OU, but one can never be too careful. Invisibility is our only advantage over the enemy, and to give it up is to invite disaster.

""Alright, what have we got?"" I asked once the sensors came online.

""Not all that much traffic, sir,"" Gofsun reported. ""Looks like the bulk of our readings are space stations.""

""Roger that. Let's watch for a bit and figure out what they're up to. Ensign Likjo,"" I shook my empty mug. ""If you would be so kind.""

""Aye aye, sir,"" the ensign chuckled. ""My thanks to the commander for returning my role as The Supreme Fetcher of Caffeinated Beverages. My role as head of maintenance can feel so unfulfilling at times.""

""The Supreme Fetcher of Caffeinated Beverages is likely the most vital role on the vessel,"" I nodded solemnly as Henskin rubbed his temples. ""And you do excellent work.""

""Thank you, sir,"" Likjo saluted, playing into the bit. ""I will return post-haste with a mug of glorious coffee.""

""Am I going to have to listen to this exchange every time you need a drink, captain?"" Henskin asked.

""Guess you should be careful what you wish for, commander,"" I grinned.

Henskin muttered angrily about monkey paws while I watched the display. Large ships that were obviously built for cargo were attaching and detaching themselves from the OU stations. The only other ships in the area were auto-flagged as close matches to the OU military vessels we'd previously encountered.

""Manufacturing,"" I said absentmindedly. ""With some guards.""

""Looks like it, sir,"" Gofsun replied. ""If we get a bit closer, we should be able to tell what they're making.""

""Risk of exposure?""

""Low.""

""Yorvi, bring us in,"" I ordered.

""Aye aye, sir,"" she said.

A moment later, we were much closer to the stations and their guards. Well within range of their sensors, and just inside the maximum estimated range of their weapons. I took a deep, soothing breath and reminded myself that they might as well be blind.

Before I could ask, several images popped up on my terminal. Detailed outlines of weapons and robots. Some of the robots were quite large, but the humanoid ones were about the size of a gen-alt. The guns weren't particularly noteworthy, just directed energy weapons that were a couple of generations behind our own.

""These VI platforms are different than the ones that were encountered on Earth,"" Omega noted. ""The bipedal bots have more advanced power systems and armor. The mechs, for lack of a better term, are new as well.""

The mechs in question were roughly four meters tall and vaguely tank-like. Four legs ending in balls supported a two meter thick trunk which was topped with an eight armed torso. These arms were evenly spread around the torso, reminiscent of an octopus.

""Can we get a read on what they're made of?"" I asked.

""Yes, they're heavily armored,"" Omega answered. ""More competence went into this design than any other design we've seen from the Omni-Union thus far.""

""AP or AT?"" Henskin asked as the smell of coffee perked me up.

""Definitely going to need anti-tank measures against these, but armor-piercing rounds may cripple them with some well-aimed shots.""

""Here's your coffee, sir,"" Likjo said as he passed me the freshly filled mug.

""Thanks, ensign,"" I gratefully accepted the coffee. ""Alright, let's see if anything interesting happens. Remember to compile a report, Gofsun.""

""Aye, sir,"" the lieutenant replied.

We waited and watched as the Omni Union ships went about their tasks, taking careful note of the ship's comings and goings. To pass the time, the crew engaged in idle conversation. I did my best to tune them out while I drank my coffee and watched the enemy, but caught the occasional fact here and there.

Yorvi and her husband were looking at buying a domicile on Mars where they could raise some kids once her term was up. Gofsun's husband was helping their daughter with her higher education exams, and he bragged about how well they were going. Henskin and his ex-wife were considering reconciliation, because neither of them have been able to find a good match. Bon's collection of gont unification war memorabilia was close to completion, but the last few pieces of weaponry were very expensive. I didn't bother clarifying how the conversation turned in that direction.

An hour later, nothing had changed. New ships came in with forged materials for the factories, old ships left with mechs and bots. The guards stood vigil and watched, just as we were.

""Alright, time to move on,"" I said. ""Get that report sent and get us to the next cluster of enemy activity.""

""Already?"" Henskin asked. ""Thought we'd be here for another seven, sir.""

""Negative,"" I shook my head. ""We're on a crunch. Need to know as much as possible as quick as possible. Let's move, people.""

""Aye sir!""

As the Strandhogg began turning, Gofsun's report popped up on my terminal. I scrolled through it, confirmed that there were no errors, and sent it off. A moment later, we were back in subspace.

The crew was getting more comfortable with each other, and while we were in subspace they started chatting again. It's always interesting to watch the social dynamics of those who are forced into close proximity with each other under the banner of a common purpose. I finished my coffee and put the mug in the sterilizer as we left warp.

""Anything fun?"" I asked.

""Looks like a similar set-up as before. Bunch of stations, but more ships than last time,"" Gofsun replied. ""Exponentially more.""

""Not getting power readings from a good portion of these ships,"" one of the other sensor techs reported.

""Well, looks like we found a ship manufacturing depot,"" I said. ""Let's get settled in. The brass wants extensive documentation on this one.""

""Really? Why?"" Bon asked.

""Trying to guess what the brass is thinking will have your head spinning in no time,"" Henskin laughed.

""If we know how the ships are built, we know how best to take them apart,"" I said, ignoring Henskin. ""If their manufacturing process has a flaw and we're able to identify it, we're able to exploit it. The easier it is to destroy their ships, the more ammo and lives we save.""

Bon raised squinted an eye, a gesture similar to a human raising an eyebrow, and glanced between Henskin and I.

""Commander, the captain's head doesn't appear to be spinning,"" he said.

""That's because he's one of the brass.""

""Ah, I see. Thank you, commander.""

I let out an exaggerated sigh and leaned back into my chair. One of the more common jokes made about me is that I'm secretly a member of the admiralty. In truth, it's just not that hard to guess at the reasons certain orders are given. Once you understand the relationship between action and consequence-

A flicker on my terminal caught my attention. I studied the map, trying to figure out what had happened. Everything looked normal, except for a marker in the upper right corner. What it was showing was so ridiculous that I couldn't even process it for a few moments.

""Sir, we have an... uh... anomaly,"" Gofsun reported.

""A glitch?"" I asked.

""No, sir. That's what we suspected it was, so we reset the sensors. It's still there, so...""

Gofsun trailed off, then shrugged.

""How many resets did you do?""

""Four, sir.""

I stared at him, then looked back to the map. We were still too far away for a detailed scan, but this was definitely going to need to be our next stop. The markers were accurate with a margin of error of plus or minus a quarter of a light-year. It's entirely possible that this is a glitch due to the position of the enemy.

Except that at least one of the resets should have resulted in the marker separating or moving. On rare occasion, the same error could happen twice in a row. Three times in a row was damn near unheard of. Four times? Impossible.

""What is it, sir?"" Henskin asked.

Instead of explaining, I twisted my terminal in his direction.

""I don't... Oh. What the fuck?""

""Posture and poise, Henskin,"" I said.

I turned the terminal back to its original position and stared at the marker that was taking up two squares on the map.

I remember the moment when I stepped out of the airport and saw the lights hanging from the beautiful Acacia Trees and the small local bars & restos full of tourists, drinking and having the best time. I remember thinking ""WOW. I ALREADY LOVE THIS PLACE."" -- and that's just a few minutes from when i left the airport! It was so lively! It was a crowd of locals mixed with tourists. 

But seasons went by and I can't help but noticed that the demographics changed, the usual foot traffic of tourists became lesser, the local events are not as fun and well thought of like it used to be. I remember you can drink and party at a beach club in BM road and there were festivals along BM beach as well. Bars closed and now we are left with tasteless ""clubs"". The dreamers and the doers just stopped trying. 

I feel like the lifestyle and leisure has regressed in Puerto Princesa. I can't seem to point out why. There were a lot of cool concepts and they never survived. 

Thank god there are still good restaurants and coffee shops! 

I now understand why they say a city's nightlife could really help shape its identity. And by nightlife, I don't just mean ""drinking"" or ""partying"" but more of like activities you could do at night, like night markets or music events. Imagine BM Beach's shoreline full of restaurants, souvenir shops, cafes and bars, but instead, we get karaoke for rent. Such a waste of beautiful space where you can watch the sunrise and also very beautiful during full moon. I even remember seeing kite-boarders there one time! 

Just look at the vlogs--- they're calling us a ""stopover"".

# Highlights

* The 2024 U.S. presidential election is shaping up to be one of the most uncertain and unpredictable in history. The future and overall success of the U.S. Department of Energy's clean energy investments could hinge on the outcome, as does the predictability of the nation's trajectory with respect to energy, climate and critical minerals.
* Bottom Line: Regardless of who is elected in November, Congress will play a key role in whether stakeholders see the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL), Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) awards and other key policies continue to build on progress that has been made or, conversely, the possibility that certain provisions could be clawed back. Even in a divided government scenario, there is potential for bipartisan progress, especially as it relates to securing U.S. supply chains and ensuring U.S. competitiveness against China.
* This Holland & Knight alert takes a look at likely policies and programs of a potential Harris Administration and Trump Administration, as well as the possible implications for industry stakeholders.

As the Biden Administration moves swiftly to implement the trifecta of legislation it has worked to have enacted in the last three years ‚Äì the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL), CHIPS and Science Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) ‚Äì the prominent question on everyone's mind is how will the election impact its progress. Although much has been done to advance clean energy projects of all shapes and sizes, considerable work remains to spur the administration's stated goals to institute a comprehensive clean energy transition and regain U.S. energy leadership. The election will impact the pace at which those policies, programs, projects and overall congressional objectives are achieved.

The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) recently announced that all BIL and IRA funds have been launched, meaning there is a plan in place to issue funding opportunities for all remaining programs and accounts. Most of these funding opportunities were brand new, such as the¬†[Hydrogen Hubs](https://www.energy.gov/oced/regional-clean-hydrogen-hubs-0)¬†and the¬†[Transmission Facilitation Program](https://www.energy.gov/gdo/transmission-facilitation-program). However, even in those programs that have been competitively reviewed and selections made, there is still significant work to be done to realize the full value of these investments. Regardless of whether Vice President Kamala Harris or former President Donald Trump is elected in November, there are benefits to be had from the success of these programs, which can drive job creation and continue U.S. innovation that's currently underway.

# Harris-Walz Administration

In a potential Harris-Walz Administration, it is very likely that there would be continued execution of the BIL and IRA endeavors. This includes an even stronger investment in ""community benefits"" plans to support the energy transition. Another major focus would be on capital formation for clean technology through leveraging the federal government to accelerate private-sector investment. DOE recently announced a new initiative, the¬†[Manufacturing Capital Connector](https://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/USDOEMESC/bulletins/3b563b6), intended to connect companies applying to DOE clean energy manufacturing programs to capital providers seeking high-quality projects. Programs such as this would help to bring in resources needed to stretch federal dollars and support the clean energy transition. Additionally, a Harris Administration would continue efforts around workforce development to serve the new industries that are being established, including battery manufacturing, processing and recycling, and direct air capture. Lastly, a Harris Administration would be likely to continue addressing permitting challenges through direct community outreach and engagement with congressional support. Furthermore, Congress would likely be called upon to help smooth the edges on deployment in line with congressional intent, supplement existing programs to meet existing and expanded clean energy transition investments, and ensure that projects meet their milestones and achieve intended results.

# Trump-Vance Administration

In a potential Trump-Vance Administration, it would be imperative to engage Congress to work to save certain programs and projects from rollbacks and recissions. Although it has pivoted at times, the Trump campaign has broadcasted its intent to roll back the BIL and IRA. Though not directly connected to the campaign, Project 2025 proposes to ""eliminate special interest funding programs"" such as the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations and the Loan Programs Office (LPO). For companies and communities that are the beneficiaries of programs, it could be imperative that they work with the DOE and Congress to help ensure that the awards remain active and viable. In 2016, many clean technology investors were slow to become engaged and pivoted their focus to efforts at both the state level and abroad, which eventually proved insufficient. However, through strategic engagement and significant congressional lobbying ‚Äì especially for programs such as LPO ‚Äì programs that were originally on the chopping block were brought back to life through both Congress and the Trump Administration. Notably in 2020, the Trump Administration issued¬†[Executive Order 13817](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-addressing-threat-domestic-supply-chain-reliance-critical-minerals-foreign-adversaries/)¬†that expanded the Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing (ATVM) Loan Program to allow for the support of onshoring energy supply chains. Although this program had initially been defunded in annual appropriations, the Trump Administration changed course once it realized the critical value the program possessed and its capacity to further U.S. competitiveness. With billions of dollars likely to still be available in 2025, the ATVM program remains a strategic tool for the U.S. government as it works to onshore a secure resilient supply chain and continues to ensure that the U.S. gains a competitive edge against China.

# Divided Government

In either scenario, Congress will remain essential to ensuring the overall success of BIL and IRA investments, as well as addressing outstanding needs that still exist after programmatic deployment. Notably, GOP House of Representatives members are signaling that a sweeping repeal of the IRA tax credits is not preferred. In August 2024, 18 Republicans¬†[wrote](https://garbarino.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/garbarino.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/FINAL%20Credits%20Letter%202024.08.06.pdf)¬†to House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) saying that repealing the credits could undermine growth in the energy sector. Energy grants, loans and tax credits have spurred innovation, incentivized investment and created hundreds of thousands of bipartisan jobs across the country. Revoking these programs just as benefits begin to materialize is hopefully not going to be an easy proposition.

The programs created have been widely popular and well received within the U.S. market. The oversubscription highlights their popularity and the immense demand, with applications in many cases exceeding available capacity by more than tenfold. For example, the DOE received 79 concept papers for Hydrogen Hubs, encouraged 33 to submit full applications and ultimately funded seven projects.

Similarly, the DOE reviewed 411 concepts across all subsectors for Industrial Decarbonization, and these projects requested more than $60 billion in federal funds ‚Äì 10 times the amount Congress appropriated for the program. DOE encouraged 130 to submit full applications and selected 33 to proceed to award negotiations.

Programs aimed at enhancing grid flexibility and resilience of the power system against growing threats of extreme weather and climate change are equally oversubscribed. In the first solicitation, DOE received more than 300 applications requesting over $19 billion ‚Äì five times more than the $3.5 billion available for selected projects. Interest is evident from the private sector, and depending on the balance of power in Congress, further support for these investments may be pursued to sustain momentum and to bolster U.S. development.

Both parties have become increasingly concerned and engaged on issues related to countering China's influence, mainly addressing these concerns by shoring up domestic energy supply chains. There is growing support for government interventions to bolster the critical minerals industry, which is essential to the clean energy transition and U.S. manufacturing.

It has been reported that efforts being considered within the current Biden Administration as well as on Capitol Hill to establish demand-side price supports for critical mineral projects are being undercut by cheaper Chinese materials. A price floor for critical minerals would cover the difference between the products, helping U.S. companies weather the unstable markets impacted by manipulation. The House Select Committee on the Strategic Competition Between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party has made similar recommendations regarding a ""Resilient Resource Reserve"" for critical minerals in its¬†[December 2023 report](https://selectcommitteeontheccp.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/selectcommitteeontheccp.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/reset-prevent-build-scc-report.pdf). This policy has also garnered interest from DOE officials who have acknowledged the adverse impact on the industry and are committed to mitigating these effects. They view this intervention as a targeted but temporary measure designed to stabilize the market during a critical phase of development, ensuring a smoother transition to a self-sustaining ecosystem. The Harris campaign has also expressed interest and support for this policy, framing the issue as an ""economic and national security"" necessity to counter China's dominance in electric vehicles (EVs) and clean energy supply chains. Demand side tools could be used for price-sensitive commodities, including clean steel, aluminum and cement, to help derisk project development to attract private financing.

Additionally, Sens. John Hickenlooper (D-Colo.) and Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) have been working across the aisle to creatively support responsible domestic mining efforts. They have introduced two bills targeting the domestic mining industry, offering research and development support and spearheading the development of a national strategy to meet the growing demand for critical minerals. In the House, Reps. Paul Tonko (D-N.Y.) and Garret Graves (R-La.) introduced bipartisan legislation aimed at enhancing transparency in critical materials. The Critical Material Transparency and Reporting of Advanced Clean Energy (Critical Material TRACE) Act proposes the establishment of a DOE program to implement digital identification systems for battery materials.

Regardless of the majority party in either chamber, there is no doubt that addressing the challenges of critical minerals will remain a priority. This focus will require continued investment, collaboration and input from stakeholders to develop sustainable solutions that support resilient supply chains for energy security.

""Although cobalt is just one of the many critical minerals that will prove decisive in developing advanced military and commercial technologies, the dynamic the mineral illustrates between the United States, China, and resource-rich developing countries is likely to continue to play out over the coming decades. China‚Äôs close relationships with the leaders of many developing countries, its long-standing investments in infrastructure, and the support China provides its domestic firms will put the United States at a disadvantage. If the United States seeks to secure the supply chains for critical minerals, it will need to present itself as a viable alternative to Chinese investment.

To present the United States as a viable alternative, the United States and its partners cannot simply follow the Chinese playbook. An alternative to Chinese financing should offer something better. One way to attract the interest of African states would be to support investments that allow African countries to add value by refining and manufacturing rather than solely exporting their raw materials. By focusing on projects that add value to resources domestically, the United States and its allies could offer a more compelling alternative to Chinese financing while enabling African states more latitude and agency in the process.""

Last year I 37M met an amazing girl 33F on Hinge and we saw each other for about a month. The connection was very very strong and I really wanted to see where things were going. I was so comfortable with her from the beginning. at the same time, my parents were in the process of separating and it was very stressful for me. I was in a strange place mentally and ended up fading from the relationship, she kept following up until I basically told her that I wasn‚Äôt in the right place to be in a relationship. Kind of self sabotage. 

We never spoke again and that was about a year and a half ago. I still saw her post on Instagram and started engaging passively, and she ended up starting conversation. we started talking again and I felt the connection like before. She asked me for a coffee and we went back-and-forth rescheduling a few times. 

In the end, she sent me a message saying that she doesn‚Äôt think it‚Äôs in the cards because we didn‚Äôt manage to prioritize meeting up in a month. I told her that I‚Äôll have free time Later this month, and let‚Äôs get a date in the calendar, but she hasn‚Äôt committed to a hang out. She said that she judges based on actions. I appreciate that that she was straightforward with me but now I‚Äôm not sure what to do. 

Last year, I found it really scary that there was no drama with her. I feel really comfortable around her. With people I‚Äôve dated in the past it‚Äôs usually a game of cat and mouse or there‚Äôs some drama. I‚Äôm figuring out my own future open to advice. 

TLDR; I wasn‚Äôt ready for a relationship with an amazing girl and now that I think I am, she doesn‚Äôt seem interested. How did you guys know when you were ready for the real thing? What should I do next?",2,1729253039.0,relationships,0,1.0,False

I figured this is *the* town to pull it off‚Äîchic, stylish, and full of people who appreciate a good wristwatch. Plus, I‚Äôve got my best blazer on and some killer loafers. Confidence? Sky-high.

I sit down at this caf√©, order an espresso, and start soaking in the vibes. Across from me, there‚Äôs this older gentleman, an important and well-known businessman, in his late 60s, flipping through a newspaper. He‚Äôs got this air of elegance, wearing a real Patek Philippe. I glance at his watch, admire it for a second, then subtly flash mine‚Äîbecause, you know, mutual respect among ‚Äúwatch guys,‚Äù right?

Wrong.

He looks over at me, notices my Datejust, and gives me this little nod. I‚Äôm thinking, ‚ÄúYeah, he knows what‚Äôs up.‚Äù But then, without missing a beat, he takes off his reading glasses, squints at my wrist, and says, ‚ÄúClean factory? Hmm, I hope they‚Äôre making better coffee than watches these days.‚Äù

I almost choke on my espresso.

He doesn't stop there. He leans in a bit and adds, ‚ÄúYou know, back in the day, we didn‚Äôt need replicas. If you couldn‚Äôt afford the real deal, you just wore a Timex and owned it.‚Äù

With a myriad of options available, it‚Äôs essential to evaluate your office‚Äôs specific needs before making a decision. Here‚Äôs a comprehensive guide to help you select the ideal coffee equipment for your workspace.

# 1. Assess Your Office Size and Coffee Consumption

Start by analyzing your office size and the number of coffee drinkers. Smaller offices might benefit from single-serve machines or compact coffee makers that require minimal counter space. On the other hand, larger offices may need commercial-grade coffee machines capable of brewing multiple cups at once. Knowing how much coffee your employees consume daily can help you gauge the capacity needed in your coffee equipment.

# 2. Consider Coffee Preferences

Understanding your employees‚Äô coffee preferences is crucial. Do they prefer traditional brewed coffee, espresso, or specialty drinks like lattes and cappuccinos? If your team enjoys a variety of coffee styles, investing in an espresso machine or a multi-function coffee maker that offers various brewing options might be worthwhile. Alternatively, if the majority prefer standard drip coffee, a reliable drip coffee maker could suffice.

# 3. Evaluate Equipment Types

There are several types of coffee equipment available, each catering to different needs:

* **Drip Coffee Makers**: These are ideal for brewing large quantities of coffee quickly and are typically user-friendly.
* **Single-Serve Machines**: Perfect for offices with varying tastes, single-serve machines offer convenience and reduce waste. Employees can brew their favorite coffee on-demand.
* **Espresso Machines**: For offices that prioritize specialty coffee, an espresso machine can be an excellent investment, allowing you to create a range of drinks.
* **French Press and Pour-Over Systems**: While these require a bit more effort, they can deliver exceptional flavor and are great for coffee aficionados.

# 4. Assess Quality and Brand Reputation

Investing in high-quality equipment can make a difference in coffee taste and machine durability. Look for brands with a solid reputation in the office coffee supply industry. Read reviews and seek recommendations from other businesses to identify reliable machines. Opt for machines with warranties or service agreements to protect your investment.

# 5. Budget Considerations

Establish a budget for your coffee equipment. Prices can vary widely based on the type and brand. Keep in mind that while some high-end machines may require a larger upfront investment, they might offer cost savings in the long run through durability and reduced need for repairs.

# 6. Maintenance and Cleaning

Coffee machines require regular maintenance to function optimally. Choose equipment that is easy to clean and maintain, especially if your office has limited staff available for upkeep. Look for machines with features like removable brewing components or automatic cleaning cycles, which simplify the process.

# 7. Employee Feedback

Finally, involve your employees in the decision-making process. Conduct a survey to gather their input on coffee preferences, equipment features, and potential choices. When employees feel included in the decision, they‚Äôre more likely to appreciate the final selection and enjoy the coffee experience in the office.

# Conclusion

Choosing the right [coffee equipment](https://ace-vending.biz/ocs-equipment/) for your office involves careful consideration of your team‚Äôs preferences, the size of your workspace, and your budget. By assessing these factors and selecting quality equipment that aligns with your employees‚Äô needs, you can create an inviting coffee culture that boosts morale and productivity in your office. Whether you opt for a simple drip coffee maker or a high-tech espresso machine, providing great coffee can foster a sense of community and enhance the overall workplace experience.",1,1729252948.0,u_Sad_Lunch8508,0,1.0,False

February 14th we received an email through our work app and a video from the regional manager stating that staff would be getting a pay rise, supervisors rate is now ¬£12.83 and managers would be getting a 5% pay increase and managers contracts reducing from 48 hours to 46 hours per week.
I never received the 5% pay increase so my hourly rate is now ¬£13.82. I questioned my Area manager over WhatsApp in May about this and she told me she would investigate, I spoke to her in person about it in July and still nothing.
So I rang payroll last week they confirmed I have not received the pay rise and to contact my area manager about back payment.
She rang me today and has let me know that I have not received the pay rise due to the store
""under performing""
My argument to her was that I was never informed of any of this and they have not made that at all clear.

I've logged onto my work app to find the email and it has been deleted, I have emails dated before February 14th so it's obviously not a time issue as to why it's disappeared.
Another store manager who is very close with the area manager currently has access to my account due to me being on sick pending going on maternity. 

She has told this other manager multiple things she shouldn't have such as;
She told the other manager I was pregnant even though I wasn't announcing it (very high risk pregnancy)
She told the other manager I was blaming her for a bad comment on our listen and learn platform from customers
She used to send the other manager to do
""checks on my store"" making me feel completely useless

I have the video of our regional manager telling us about all the ""positive"" things they're giving us in April and have multiple messages to friends and relatives about receiving the pay rise around the time the video was delivered, I just do not have this email anymore.

My argument is I'm fully expected to run this store as if it was my own yet I have no control over the things that make us ""under perform""

We are measured on a listen and learn app through customer feedback..anything under a 9 gives you a negative score and they refuse to remove comments that you have no control over We get at least 10 comments a month about the state of the store and it need a refurb (there's holes in the chairs, tape on the floor, walls are crumbling) our store has not been updated in 13 years, there is a considerable sized hole in one of the built in chairs that has been there for 4 years and they refuse to fix it. 

We are also measured on sales which once again is affected by lack of hours and customers being repulsed by the store and how grubby it is, made worse by another popular coffee chain being next door to us that's brand new.

We are measured on audits (which we have passed) but not with a very high score with comments about the state of the store being stated on the feedback.

We were asked to fill in a survey at the beginning of the year for feedback about working there and some of us were quite unhappy so we scored low at the time and this was then added to the list of things we were measured on, which they never told us or area managers they would be using this feedback against us. After we completed the survey they wanted stores to have average of 75% we scored 39% as we thought it was anonymous.

I'm currently in sick due to stress and pregnancy related issues and I'm just beyond fed up with this company and how they treat us and this has just really sent me over the egde. Is there anything I can do to argue my case?
Thanks for the help!

I‚Äôm a 27-year-old marketing student living in Perth, originally from overseas, and currently working as a retail sales assistant. Since moving here for school, I‚Äôve realized that making new friends as an adult can be challenging. I love reading (especially horror!), watching movies and TV shows, and I enjoy spending time at the beach.

Though I‚Äôm busy with school and work, I do miss having a close-knit group to hang out with, talk about random stuff, or even just grab a coffee. Being in a new city can feel a bit isolating sometimes, and I‚Äôd love to connect with people who share similar interests or are just looking to make new friends too.

Anyone in the same boat? Would love to hear how you‚Äôve made connections in a new place or even if you‚Äôre in Perth too!",2,1729252864.0,chat,1,1.0,False

I think we‚Äôve all started to hear about how terrible the dating apps have gotten (and were they really a healthy way to meet people before?).

I know there‚Äôs always the advice about meeting people in real life - do the activities you enjoy, running clubs, etc. I‚Äôve spent the better part of the last year putting myself out there like that to no avail. 

Part of it is even, in the days before apps, how did you approach people in real life? Chat up conversation on the subway, coffee shops, etc. Is that something you can even do anymore? How does that work, and what are your feelings about that?

If it‚Äôs helpful context, I live in Boston. I never want to assume a man‚Äôs sexuality, out of respect/courtesy/embarrassment, so that‚Äôs a bit of a barrier too. ",2,1729252665.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

I live in England, and have G11 skin, just for some context.

Biscotti - smells EXACTLY like a Battenburg (an apricot jam and marzipan sponge cake), which is one of my favourite cakes in the world, so it is an instant hit with me, I adore it. The tint is not as warm as Cookie Dough, it's much sheerer and almost cooler toned, perhaps? It also has a lovely sheen and a slight glittery shimmer like Birthday Cake (no actual chunks of glitter, don't worry!), which feels really festive and versatile. 

Espresso - definite instant coffee scent hit, like true espresso, which I love, but there is absolutely some sweetness there. I've seen others say there's some bitterness, but I've not picked that up personally. As for the colour, the tint is significant, and it's a much truer brown than Hot Cocoa, with none of the red/cherry tones that HC has. I love HC very much, it really suits my skin tone and hair colour, and the scent is phenomenal, but Espresso is, again, much more versatile and buildable, a more neutral, sophisticated brown.

Oh, and while we're here, I got the R√™ve and Doux samples. I think they both smell fabulous (on me, at least); R√™ve is for sure my favourite, it's very plum jammy, which suits my cake-loving tendencies perfectly, but Doux has a lovely, musky scent that feels more universal, but also more mature, perhaps? It feels more like something my mother or auntie would wear, so I probably won't purchase it, even though I like it, but R√™ve is on my Christmas List, without a doubt! üéÑ

One day my friend (23F) asked me to spot her, but I'm not strong enough yet, so I asked a man (28M)  who seemed like he'd make a good spotter. He came over and helped and after the session he asked if we could all trade numbers or socials to keep in touch for future spotting help. I gave him my IG, which I hardly use, and my friend gave him her number and socials. 

Later that night, I get a message from an unknown number. ""Hey, it's ... from the gym. I got your number from ... I hope that's okay"". I was shocked and messaged my friend asking why she'd give my personal information away. Apparently he'd said I hadn't accepted his friend request yet so he wanted a way to contact me until I did. 

Due to messaging my friend I forgot to reply to him and I went to bed. I woke up to several messages the nexy day. ""Hey, me again, sorry for messaging you out of the blue. I really hope I haven't upset you by doing so. Just let me know so I can stop or continue. Thanks"". Then ""Good morning, I'm going to the gym later. Hit me up if you need spotting"". I realised it would probably be rude not to reply so I said ""Hey, morning. I'm really busy today so I won't be at the gym"". I didn't mention me feeling weird about him having my number. 

I saw he'd requested to follow me on other forms of social media too, likely because of my attacthed phone number. I left it without accepting as I don't really use the majority of social media anymore. My phone kept buzzing, I checked it after the 5th buzz and saw him liking my posts on social media. I have 80+ posts on IG and he liked a good majority of them. He also commented on a few recent ones, which were still posted days/weeks ago. Things like ""Gains"", ""ü•µ"",""üî•"",""Gym crush"". He was not being subtle at all. 

My first day back to the gym after the messaging incident, I see him over by the machines we always use with a big grin on his face. We go over and he gets in spotting position and helps my friend. After the session I walk to the locker room and he catches me before I go in. ""Hey, I was wondering if you'd like to grab some coffee, maybe watch a movie or something?"". I was shocked because we'd barely spoke during the workout. I told him that I wouldn't be available but my friend chimed in and said we should all go together.

We end up going to get lunch and it was really awkward, he kept talking to me and slightly ignoring my friend. I couldn't stand the awkwardness so I went to the bathroom to think of an excuse to leave. She follows me and confesses that she likes him but thinks she doesn't stand a chance because he ""clearly likes me"". If she liked him so much, why help him get my number and tell me to come to lunch. I don't get it. 

Over the next few days, he messaged me a few more times. ""Hey ... I absolutely loved our date. I'm going to an event tomorrow and I could really use a plus one. Want to help a guy out?"". I rejected and left my phone on the side whilst I did some chores. I come back to several messages, basically him explaining how bummed out he was and how he wished he had someone to go with. I reccomended my friend and said she has a little thing for him. Thankfully things calmed down after this, he'd message me now and again to ask if I was going to the gym, continue liking my posts and my stories. 

Some time passes, he continues to spot, we don't talk much, we just kind of smile at eachother and have a basic conversation here and there. Until yesterday. 

The doorbell rings and I open it to see him. I was so close to slamming the door in his face. He asked if he could come in and I felt wary but accepted as I felt awkward. He gave me a bouquet of flowers and told me that he's sorry that he's so forward. He explained that he's had feelings for me since he first saw me at the gym. Apparently my deer in the headlights look made me stand out (I literally didn't know how to use the equipment and was just following my friends). 

I told him I'm on a break right now but I'm not single and I'm not looking to date until I know what I'm doing with my prior relationship. I explained I didn't feel like I needed to say anything beforehand because I wasn't sure what he expected from me, I now know so it made sense to say, but also because it wasn't really any of his business to know about my personal life. 

He didn't take the news well, he'd assumed I was single. He accused me of leading him on and saying that I'm lucky he's a nice guy. Because any other guy would be really mad that I'd wasted his time. I was getting anxious at this moment so I asked him to leave, he accepted and I locked my door and watched him walk away. 

I couldn't sleep last night, I was really anxious about him coming to my place whilst I slept. I heard my phone buzz after midnight, a message from him. ""Look, I'm sorry about how I reacted earlier. I understand that you're still holding on for your ex. I'm willing to wait and be patient for you. I know we haven't known eachother long, but love is love. I know you don't love me yet, but one day you will"". 

TLDR: A guy at my gym is being very clingy messaging me, showing up at my home, trying to get me to go on a date with him. He got mad when I told him I was on a break but forgives me and want to wait for me. 

Sorry that it's so wordy, I find it soothing to write it out more detailed. I feel like I need to remember the experience in detail. I guess I'm trying to break it down and find out where I could have given him the idea that I was into him/leading him on. I'm just finding it hard to understand. Thanks for reading.

The will to power means constantly getting better and to overcome oneself. For example, the athlete wants to become better at his sport.  
As I understand it, for Nietzsche this is the main drive of a person, and a person is most fulfilled when he follows this will to power.  
But isn't this fulfillment just a stronger form of pleasure that lasts longer? So, isn't the will to power also just the pursuit of pleasure?

Ridiculous. I‚Äôm genuinely considering starting some huge group to protest about it (Facebook, Instagram, reddit) and take to the streets

Get dozens of thousands of signed petitions and hand them straight to whichever fucktard is or was in control of the cities road planning. If nothing can be done through that we would just need to apply more pressure and hang outside these TDs offices, housing estates, corner them till they actually fight for the road users.


Multiple times a week I get into close calls where if I didn‚Äôt have a coffee I‚Äôd end up in a and e trying to dodge some doctor rushing to work. The amount of near death experiences on the road and the repetition of them is crazy.

We need a bypass, metro, train, tram or some solution,  and we need one badly. More people moving here, more people on the road, worse traffic, and the only half arsed solution we‚Äôve gotten is the moycullen bypass.

One day my friend (23F) asked me to spot her, but I'm not strong enough yet, so I asked a man (28M)  who seemed like he'd make a good spotter. He came over and helped and after the session he asked if we could all trade numbers or socials to keep in touch for future spotting help. I gave him my IG, which I hardly use, and my friend gave him her number and socials. 

Later that night, I get a message from an unknown number. ""Hey, it's ... from the gym. I got your number from ... I hope that's okay"". I was shocked and messaged my friend asking why she'd give my personal information away. Apparently he'd said I hadn't accepted his friend request yet so he wanted a way to contact me until I did. 

Due to messaging my friend I forgot to reply to him and I went to bed. I woke up to several messages the nexy day. ""Hey, me again, sorry for messaging you out of the blue. I really hope I haven't upset you by doing so. Just let me know so I can stop or continue. Thanks"". Then ""Good morning, I'm going to the gym later. Hit me up if you need spotting"". I realised it would probably be rude not to reply so I said ""Hey, morning. I'm really busy today so I won't be at the gym"". I didn't mention me feeling weird about him having my number. 

I saw he'd requested to follow me on other forms of social media too, likely because of my attacthed phone number. I left it without accepting as I don't really use the majority of social media anymore. My phone kept buzzing, I checked it after the 5th buzz and saw him liking my posts on social media. I have 80+ posts on IG and he liked a good majority of them. He also commented on a few recent ones, which were still posted days/weeks ago. Things like ""Gains"", ""ü•µ"",""üî•"",""Gym crush"". He was not being subtle at all. 

My first day back to the gym after the messaging incident, I see him over by the machines we always use with a big grin on his face. We go over and he gets in spotting position and helps my friend. After the session I walk to the locker room and he catches me before I go in. ""Hey, I was wondering if you'd like to grab some coffee, maybe watch a movie or something?"". I was shocked because we'd barely spoke during the workout. I told him that I wouldn't be available but my friend chimed in and said we should all go together.

We end up going to get lunch and it was really awkward, he kept talking to me and slightly ignoring my friend. I couldn't stand the awkwardness so I went to the bathroom to think of an excuse to leave. She follows me and confesses that she likes him but thinks she doesn't stand a chance because he ""clearly likes me"". If she liked him so much, why help him get my number and tell me to come to lunch. I don't get it. 

Over the next few days, he messaged me a few more times. ""Hey ... I absolutely loved our date. I'm going to an event tomorrow and I could really use a plus one. Want to help a guy out?"". I rejected and left my phone on the side whilst I did some chores. I come back to several messages, basically him explaining how bummed out he was and how he wished he had someone to go with. I reccomended my friend and said she has a little thing for him. Thankfully things calmed down after this, he'd message me now and again to ask if I was going to the gym, continue liking my posts and my stories. 

Some time passes, he continues to spot, we don't talk much, we just kind of smile at eachother and have a basic conversation here and there. Until yesterday. 

The doorbell rings and I open it to see him. I was so close to slamming the door in his face. He asked if he could come in and I felt wary but accepted as I felt awkward. He gave me a bouquet of flowers and told me that he's sorry that he's so forward. He explained that he's had feelings for me since he first saw me at the gym. Apparently my deer in the headlights look made me stand out (I literally didn't know how to use the equipment and was just following my friends). 

I told him I'm on a break right now but I'm not single and I'm not looking to date until I know what I'm doing with my prior relationship. I explained I didn't feel like I needed to say anything beforehand because I wasn't sure what he expected from me, I now know so it made sense to say, but also because it wasn't really any of his business to know about my personal life. 

He didn't take the news well, he'd assumed I was single. He accused me of leading him on and saying that I'm lucky he's a nice guy. Because any other guy would be really mad that I'd wasted his time. I was getting anxious at this moment so I asked him to leave, he accepted and I locked my door and watched him walk away. 

I couldn't sleep last night, I was really anxious about him coming to my place whilst I slept. I heard my phone buzz after midnight, a message from him. ""Look, I'm sorry about how I reacted earlier.

The will to power means constantly getting better and to overcome oneself. For example, the athlete wants to become better at his sport.  
As I understand it, for Nietzsche this is the main drive of a person, and a person is most fulfilled when he follows this will to power.  
But isn't this fulfillment just a stronger form of pleasure that lasts longer? So, isn't the will to power also just the pursuit of pleasure?

***

When the crepuscular grey light of dawn began to stain the edges of the curtains, Christopher gave up on returning to sleep and rose to start the day. He put on coffee, scrambled a large bowl of eggs and began to cook bacon to accompany them. Baby Val stirred partway through the process, and he took a brief break to rescue her from her crib and allow her parents a slightly longer rest.

‚ÄúSheesh, Dad,‚Äù said Brian when he entered the kitchen an hour later. ‚ÄúYou sure took my late riser comment hard, huh? I didn‚Äôt mean anything by it. You‚Äôre welcome to sleep in, you know! You‚Äôre a guest here.‚Äù

‚ÄúI was up anyway,‚Äù said Christopher. ‚ÄúSeemed a waste to just let the morning slip by.‚Äù

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs the dad attitude I know and love. Never a moment of the day that can‚Äôt be filled.‚Äù

The comment was clearly meant to be light-hearted, but it stung. Christopher wondered how often he had failed to hear Brian saying that he needed space to grow. He thought about the endless doors of memory, the catalog of his failings.

He had always meant well. Intent mattered far less than results, though.

Brian had turned out all right, hadn‚Äôt he? Grown up, left the nest, made something of himself. And then not come back for a decade or more, not until Valentine was born. Only then had he reached out to mend bridges that Christopher had never realized were broken.

There had never been an overt declaration. The children had grown up and moved away, as they were supposed to. They still came back for Christmas, at least in theory. Brian had made the trip most years. His sister Erin always said she would, but somehow ended up too busy with work every time.

‚ÄúHey, I didn‚Äôt mean to rag on you,‚Äù said Brian, seeing his father‚Äôs expression. ‚ÄúI appreciate you making breakfast and everything. I didn‚Äôt mean to sound ungrateful.‚Äù

Christopher wanted to tell his son that he finally understood why they hadn‚Äôt really talked for a decade. He wanted to apologize for the emotional minefield that stretched across their conversations. He could see the shape at the center, the knot in the form of Jason that had contorted everything in his life. He reached for the words to explain, but the concept was too big. He couldn‚Äôt summarize it.

Instead, he said only, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm happy to help out.‚Äù

Brian smiled, and Christopher thought that maybe his son knew what he meant. He returned the smile gratefully.

That night, the dreams came again. Now that decades of unaddressed issues had been unstoppered, they would not be shoved back into the recesses of the unconscious for long. 

This dream had Christopher walking through the woods. It was night, the sky clear and studded with stars. The moon was a blinding crescent lighting the way through the trees. The air was fresh and warm, with a gentle breeze stirring the leaves.

Christopher‚Äôs friends were with him, Orson and Andrew and Daniel‚Äîand yes, Jason. They were not children, though, not the teens he had once known. They had grown just as he had, even Jason, aging gracefully into the men they had been meant to be.

They did not talk as they walked through the forest, but there was joy in their silence. They were happy to be together, five friends who had seen each other through thick and thin. Christopher knew that this was a dream, but he desperately wished it were true. This was what could have been.

A distant train whistle spat a discordant note. Christopher eyed the forest ahead uneasily.

‚ÄúMaybe we should turn back,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre almost there,‚Äù said Daniel. It was always Daniel who had led the way. Daniel had the ideas. The other four had just helped them happen.

Up ahead, the trees thinned and a gravel embankment rose up out of the woods. The rocks glowed white in the moonlight, the color of bones. The wood and metal tracks at the top were a stark, contrasting black.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs stay off the tracks,‚Äù Christopher said.

‚ÄúThe train bridge is the only way across,‚Äù said Daniel. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like a couple hundred feet. We‚Äôll go fast.‚Äù

Christopher knew very well that it was five hundred feet, almost a tenth of a mile. It took a couple of minutes on foot. The train could cross the distance in just a few seconds.

He wanted to turn back. He wanted to protest. He wanted to do it right this time, unlike all those years ago. They were older, wiser. Surely he could prevent it.

His mouth would not say the words. His legs would not obey.

Christopher stepped onto the track, last in line. Jason was in front of him, picking his way carefully across behind the others.

The whistle sounded again. Had that actually happened that night? Had they ignored a warning that clear?

Jason, stopping to adjust his shoe, had fallen behind the others. It was fifty feet or less, but it was all the difference in the world. When the train swung around the corner, its headlight illuminating the terrified expressions on the mens‚Äô faces. They sprang like frightened rabbits, running for safety.

The three in front were close enough to the end. They ran toward the train, flinging themselves off of the bridge as soon as the ground was close enough. The whistle shrieked again as they flew pell-mell off both sides of the tracks, diving for safety.

Jason and Christopher were too far back to sprint for the end. Instead, they turned tail and fled the way they had come, hoping against hope that they could outrun the train.

Christopher ran like his life depended on it, just as he had that night. From behind him came the cry he had tried to forget, to pretend hadn‚Äôt happened:

‚ÄúMy foot‚Äôs stuck!‚Äù

To his shame, Christopher didn‚Äôt break stride for an instant. The light grew behind him, spurring him on. The train whistle screamed like a demon, echoing Jason‚Äôs own wordless screams.

The end was in sight. The light was everywhere. The scream of the whistle was the only sound in the world. As Christopher flung himself to the uncertain mercy of the hillside, there was a sudden horrible redness to the light‚Äîand then he was tumbling down the hill, rocks and roots tearing at his clothes and skin.

That was how it had gone that night. In this dream, however, when Christopher turned to run, he felt his foot catch between two of the railroad ties, wrenching his ankle.

‚ÄúMy foot‚Äôs stuck!‚Äù he screamed, and his voice was not his own. Up ahead, illuminated by the onrushing light of the train, he saw his own body fleeing down the tracks.

‚ÄúHelp me!‚Äù

The Christopher ahead never looked back. His eyes were fixed on the hillside and salvation.

On the tracks, pinned just as Jason had been, Christopher tugged frantically at his foot, ignoring the flares of pain. If he could just get it free, he could jump. There was water somewhere below. He might survive.

The track gripped his leg like a drowning victim. Christopher, as Jason, screamed. He could not hear himself over the shriek of the train. The light filled his world as his scream blended with the whistle of the train.

There was a brief moment of pain like he had never felt, and then nothing.

Little bacground: I am 22, and Specialty Chinese Tea(such as black, white, green etc.) is a big, huge part of my life, not for the caffeine, but for it's relaxing effect, and flavour, let's call it tasting aspect (think wine tasting and exploring but tea), and specialty coffee is a part of it too.

I just started taking like a generic version of Concerta (still it's slow release methylphenidate), and I have 2 concerns regarding caffeine, as I see a lot of people having bad experiences. One as just starting with Concerta and one in the long term.

I am only on day 2 of taking Methylphenidate, and in the morning I felt super tired and sleepy after taking it, my guess, just my body adjusting to it, and not having caffeine as I'm used to... And i couldn't resist having coffee, but I waited at least two hours before coffee so I can observe a bit of what effect the med has on me. Now I had coffee and I wouldn't say it affected me in any way other then energise me, and I still feel the same benefits(as much as I can just starting out) from the med, maybe just a tinyyy bit more ""jumpy"", the effects of caffeine are definetely more amplified than before medicating. 
* So my question is, starting out, is it a bad idea to take caffeine while starting out, if I feel like it doesn't affect the effects of Methylphenidate? Like I feel like I can still gauge the effect the med has on me.
* Second question, in the long term, what are your experiences with it not just starting out.
Also my suspicion, I still haven't really had tea with it, but my guess that Tea would be a better fit than coffee, as the caffeine effect differs with tea, do you feel like tea works better with the med?

1g6g03v,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1g6g03v/seeing_my_crush_again/,Seeing My Crush Again,"It's been so hard for me lately. I hate how I traded my life in my home country to join my partner here in Adelaide, only to be cut off by his brother because I talked to them about how they should compensate my partner for asking him to take unpaid leaves at work to take care of their kids. His brother also told him that he should have chosen him and the kids instead of me. 

They already have a boy and a girl right now and before they cut me off, the wife was already pregnant with twins and is her second trimester. They're expecting my partner to take care of them because ""that's how families should be"", something that doesn't really suit me well and I hate how my partner brought me into this situation. Had I only known, I wouldn't leave Hanoi for Adelaide. I didn't come from an affluent family but at least I'm quite enjoying my freedom there.

I was an ordinary hotel worker there, while teaching English on the side, but apart from the tiring work, I never had any problems with my families or anyone violating my freedom.

But alright, I'm already here. And while I was thinking of my crush in Hanoi the other day, I couldn't believe that I saw him here in Adelaide. 

To make things clear, he doesn't have a crush on me. He doesn't even know that I like him. I only met him once during a three-day seminar for chefs, which I attended. There, I was able to talk to him about his work. He said his family has a small cafe, which he solely runs now since his parents passed away. I tried to visit that cafe once just to see him and I saw him, but he was so busy attending to other customers as well. 

However, I also knew that he has a girlfriend because I stalled his Facebook profile. So I had to tell myself to stop my illusions and learn to let go. That was the time that I went online and after three years, I then met my current partner through a dating app.

And just last month I think, I was talking to my partner about that chef crush of mine. It just so happened that I and my partner went to a cafe here in Adelaide and the pastry we ordered reminded me of the pastry my crush chef serves at his cafe. I know pastries are just basically the same everywhere, but there are just some particular elements of it that reminds me of him (his pastry, to be exact).

And just the other day, I was walking at the streets of Adelaide during my break and I bumped into my crush! I thought I was imagining things, but nope, I didn't. He said he's here in Australia for short chef courses he wanted to attend as he wishes to expand his product range and to expand the business too.

I asked if he would wanna have coffee with me and he agreed. He doesn't know that I already have someone and I didn't volunteer the information.

I was trying to be appropriate in my gestures and words towards him but I know in my heart that I would really want to spend more time with him. After roughly 30 minutes of chat, I had to return to my workplace already. He also bid me goodbye as he was meeting with his new found friends at the workshop/class he's attending.

It's so hard for me to have these emotions. Why do I feel like the circumstances are telling me something. How on earth that the person you had these feelings for and you happen to remember the other day would appear in front of you and you'd get the chance to talk to?

I'm here at home, looking at my partner who is already sleeping beside me. I feel sad. I feel regretful that I'm here.

I don't know if I just feel this way because I am still blaming him for being disrespected by his family.",1,1729251682.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

1g6fx2l,https://i.redd.it/0qzgd0c74ivd1.jpeg,"Trains, sirens, and A date with Carol Kane","I [M28] walk up Lake Street, on my way home. I recall that Kyle told me he'd found an old Civil Defense Siren atop a roof here in Maywood. Before going home, I decide to take a few turns and see the siren. I am having a hard time finding it, based off of his directions. Instead of continuing to look, I decide to head home again. However, I do not turn around. I take a new path based on how far I've strayed. I'm now walking through a narrow alleyway when I see train tracks at my feet. I'm a bit confused, not having seen them here before. I stop to see a sign that tells me the tracks are active. I quickly move down the block and turn. As I move, a train flies by. 

As I made my way to safety and crossed the main road, I spot a woman eyeing me. She's ~25, black, wearing thick cornrows down to her shoulders. She looks at me, almost worried. I notice she's wearing a train-company uniform and understood that she was some sort of rail-safety personnel. I let her know that I am fine and won't be messing around on those tracks anymore.

I continue again back to my path home. After so long, I realise I've very much overshot my town. My surroundings are far more urban, resembling downtown Chicago, rather than my local suburb. Not knowing my way from here, I instead double back from where I came. I know if I can get back to Maywood, I can find my way home. 

While still downtown, I stop into some sort of high-end store on my way. I notice a large crystalline object. *(Guitar, I think)* As I reach to touch it, a woman's hand grabs my wrist. I notice a ""Do not touch!"" sign and apologize. I then left the store. On my way back, I see the young train woman from before. She greets me and we stop into a local shop for coffee. Soon enough, I am back on my way. 

Now back in Maywood, I actually see the siren I'd been hunting. It's an old Sterling Model M, atop a corner building. I go to take a photo, but it's now disappeared. To try and find it, I open the Google Street View timeline tool, but in real life. I figure it must have been removed after a building renovation. Indeed, I see the siren again and get screenshots. 

Instead of going North home after, I am forced to make my way South by Phineas and Ferb and their friends, somehow. *(I don't recall details, but it involved me scaling a house and jumping from a window)* After escaping their influence, I realize I'm in a sort of rich suburban neighbourhood in Maywood. I'm in someone's backyard. I'm beckoned over by the owner. She sits at the edge of a small pond. The sky is dark, but the pond glows blue. I sit next to her. She looks and speaks like actress Carol Kane. 

We spend the night chatting, bonding at the pond. It is meant to be the start of romance between us. As the morning rolls around, she asks me to help her with a task. We need to go into town to recover her parents' ashes. She wants to scatter them in her pond. I agree and we head out. She takes me to a resale shop. Kane approaches the owner, a man in his mid-30s who wears a mid-2000s douchey aesthetic. He seems annoyed with her, but tells us to follow him. He takes us to a back corner where a mysterious object is covered in black tarp. Kane asks if the item is what she's here for. He uncovers it, revealing a red lawnmower. I understand the lawnmower to actually be a large specially-made urn.

I lift the body of the machine, leaving behind the pusher and wheels. As I am leaving, the machine has now become the body of an electric guitar, with ashes spilling out. The owner is quick to put a bag under it to catch the ashes. As he wraps the bag around it, he scolds Carol Kane for picking a dumb object to use as an urn for her parents. 

Kane and I make our way back to her yard.

‚ÄúSo how does this metal basket work? You just open the lid?‚Äù

*\*Pause\**

*\*Annoyed\** ‚ÄúYes, I know what metal is. I‚Äôm wearing a helmet made of it.‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you...blind? *\*Pause\** No? Are you in a habit of saying whatever half formed thought cross your brain?

*\*Latch opening\**

‚ÄúHm. More metal and... some glass shards. How boring. I have a better collection than you.‚Äù

*\*Pause\**

‚ÄúThey were useful to me, so I kept them. And before you run your mouth again, yes, I know what glass it.‚Äù

‚ÄúA Siren tribe in the South Atlantic has a clan that forges weapons by tipping certain sands into those fissure volcanoes. It makes a material similar to this ‚Äòglass.‚Äô‚Äù

*\*Pause\**

‚ÄúThey use shaped rods of metal to make impressions is the glass while its hot. I assume humans do it the same.‚Äù

*\*Pause\**

‚ÄúI have a collection tucked away in some chests in grooves of the walls over there. All bottles, but the newer glass I‚Äôm seeing are chips from windows. This new glass is...different. Weirdly flexible.‚Äù

*\*Pause\**

*\*Genuine for a moment (however you want to play that\*)* ‚ÄúThe smoothed and foggy ones been underwater for a while. It‚Äôs fun to catalogue the steady degradation.‚Äù

[*\*Faint water splashing against the rock\**]()

‚ÄúThe black bottle is actually a hyper concentrated blue. Held to up to light to figure than one out. It‚Äôs marked as being from the 18^(th) century. The oldest one that I own.‚Äù

‚ÄúIce blue was for soda, and the Cornflower blue bottle was cast for holding Milk of Magnesia. *\*To yourself\** still not sure what ‚Äòmagnesia‚Äô is.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe Aqua is from the 19^(th) century and this bright blue Cobalt bottle is labelled as ‚Äòpoison.‚Äô Fortunately for you, it‚Äôs long since been empty.‚Äù

*\*Echoing water dripping from ceiling\**

¬†

‚ÄúBrown glass is from beer bottles, and amber are for spirits.‚Äù

*\*Pause\**

‚ÄúOf course I know what those are. I‚Äôve pinched drinks from human boats when they have a little party. I didn‚Äôt like them, but some of my clanmates loved them‚Äù

‚ÄúThis bright pale yellow, I believe the humans call ‚Äòcitron‚Äô like fruit. These were used for milk. Another practice long since out of use.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a whole second chest dedicated to greens. Humans seem to love this colour a lot. Olive green is from the 1930‚Äôs bottle and the soft green rectangular bottle is marked as ‚ÄòBaking Soda.‚Äô‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat is baking soda. I can tell it‚Äôs different than the drinking soda. What is it and where does it come from?‚Äù

*\*Long pause\**

‚ÄúHow do you not know where it comes from? *\*Pause\** What do you mean they just make it? From rocks? Also why is it powder and not liquid? That‚Äôs stupid. Anyway...‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôve found sooo many generic dark green bottles that are molded for ‚ÄòCoca-Cola‚Äô or ‚ÄòDr. Pepper.‚Äô I just kept the best quality ones. It got to the point where my collection was so big that I lined up a broad walk with just the green ones.‚Äù

‚ÄúDead of night when the lights on the poles went dim. Must‚Äôve been just shy of 100 bottles tossed away where no one could see it to be bothered by their presence. So I gave them all back!‚Äù

*\*Laugh\**

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a brighter lime green one. Another soda bottle but labelled from the 1960‚Äôs.‚Äù

*\*Pause\**

‚ÄúI tried lime once. Pinched one from a tall glass when someone finished their drink.‚Äù

‚ÄúAbsolutely vile. Makes sense why the portion was small. I imagine it‚Äôs a supporting or complimentary flavour.‚Äù

¬†

*\*Echoing water dripping form ceiling\**

‚ÄúIn a third smaller chest is a bunch of bottles marked a ‚Äòbeverage‚Äô. Red, another green called ‚ÄòKelly‚Äô, white and clear.‚Äù

‚ÄúEither they contained generic flavours or I‚Äôm missing information.‚Äù

*\*Pause\**

‚ÄúA sticky label made of paper. No, that wouldn‚Äôt survive the ocean... going to make a mental note of that.‚Äù

‚ÄúHmm, what are the ethics on intentional starvation. But you wouldn‚Äôt know that information if someone hadn‚Äôt already done it.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúRegardless, I‚Äôm not done with the basket.‚Äù

*\*Disappointed\** ‚ÄúOh, these are modern coins.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, no use for your money, I already have my fair share of these for study purposes. Perhaps these can be put back into the economy.‚Äù

‚ÄúOnly really care about the older and rarer ones for aesthetic reasons...Ooo, drinking cans. What have you got here?‚Äù

*\*Pause\**

‚ÄúI thought about collecting drinking cans, but quickly decided against it. There‚Äôs far too many and I don‚Äôt have the storage space. Human‚Äôs will put *anything* in a can.‚Äù

‚ÄúLager, lemonade, vodka, coffee and yogurt. Some have modified tops with the pull tags to squish fill-sized toys right in there.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd then, even after being buried by sand and knocked about by the waves, some still smell heavily of beer.‚Äù

‚ÄúA decent selection of rings. Mostly from engagements or weddings. Some humans toss these away when their relationships end. Most appear to be from bad decisions. Some folks seem genuinely sad though.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe way sirens marriages work is none of your business. Certainly not represented with something so replaceable, insignificant and disposable as a ring.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat else is in here...Necklaces. Well, a tangle of chains really. Some with pendants, some without. None of them interesting enough to snap off.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo bracelets or bangles. Plenty of single earrings, body jewelry and piercings. They slip out get lost in the ocean when they go swimming. Some celebrity lost her diamond earring in the tropics.‚Äù

1g6fpu9,https://www.reddit.com/r/step1/comments/1g6fpu9/some_suggestions_and_tips_for_exam_day_from_my/,Some suggestions and tips for exam day from my experience.,"1) Take proper sleep

First and foremost advice from my side is to take atleast 6-7 hrs of sleep before he test day. I cannot stress enough how important is that. Your mind will be Fatigued in those end blocks (6th, 7th) and in absence of that sleep the Fatigue will come at earlier blocks that can mess things up



2) Do breakfast before giving exam

Make sure it is not very heavy or high on fats. Make it light. Because giving exam on empty stomach is not good.



3) Refreshments for the break in between 

That totally depends on person to person. Make sure you carry things that are high on sugar. Many carry energy drinks or coffee along with something to eat. But just make sure you use them beforehand, while giving the practice tests itself, do not do experimentation on exam day itself. Because i had to remove some items from my list, which i thought i would use in real deal due to some or other issues. 



4) Block 1

It will take about 5-10 min to actually realise that yes i am now giving the actually exam. So some people get blank for few minutes or suddenly feel a little panic, that's totally normal. And sometimes it last a little longer but just keep moving forward, don't get stuck on same question for long, just flag it and move on.



5) Taking breaks in between

Time and frequency of break one need can vary from person to person. I took break after every block. But after completion of my 5th block i got little restless and wanted to just finish of the exam as soon as possible so just took 2- 3 min break. That decision i really regretted that entire block. So just don't take any decisions in haste and out of restlessness because in the later blocks you do need rest.
And read all the instructions and everything beforehand from free120. And during exam just take a glace at those instructions to make sure nothing new is added. This will add an extra 12-14 minute to your break time.



6) Micomanage your time at every block

Set a small targets on number of questions and the time you want to do them in.( For me it was 20qn in 26-27min and 10 qn in 13-14 min) and leave 5-7 min at end of every block to review the questions that you have flagged. Of course there is a good chance that you will miss the mark few times during the real deal because sometimes most of the long stem of that block will be clustered together( mine 6th block had 9 very long questions clustered together, similar thing happend in 2nd block as well). But nonetheless don't panic, hold your nerves and try your best not be stuck at one particular question.



7) Flagging the questions

I hear people worrying about getting a fail just because they flagged lot of questions. It doesn't work that way. Whenever feel stuck between 2 options, just eliminate others and mark one out of two you think is correct, flag it and move on. I have noticed that usually when you got back to those flagged question in the end, you can think about it more clearly. And truth be told, in every block you will be absolutely certain in only 21-23 question, 12-13question will be like i am not very sure but i think this could be the answer and in remaining , not a damn clue. So yes you have to flag quite a lot.




8) Post exam Anxiety

Aftet you are done with exam, don't try to recall anything, its done , let it go. Although the flashbacks of the silly mistakes you did will come and go for 2 weeks but don't try to go in that rabbit hole deliberately. Watch some series or movies or whatever you wanted to do when you were preparing. I know its easier said than done but just trust the process and your scores.

We were 6 adults (2 60YOs, 4 30-somethings) and we spent 9 days in Ubud and 5 days on Nusa Lembongan. End of September to mid October. Two of us (me and my husband) had been to Bali before, the other 4 had never been outside of Europe. It definitely was a 'core memory' type holiday :) 

**UBUD**  
- Stayed roughly 10 minute drive (without traffic) ;) outside Ubud centre in a private villa. Lovely and quiet, a really good base to explore.   
- 9 days was NOT too long at all, as you can get to many places from Ubud. My goal was to not have to switch accommodation often as I figured 4 of us were going to be dealing with quite the culture shock, and as the 'organiser/travel guide', it would save me babysitting the parents and overall stress :)   
- Other than our airport pick-up we didn't book anything ahead of time, just one day in advance, some restaurants 2 days as we were a group of 6.   
- Last time I was in Ubud was 6 years ago, this reddit had me really worried about crowds; it was MUCH more quiet than I anticipated (and can only imagine that's because it was shoulder season). Traffic into town come dinner time is bad, but other than that, even Ubud Market was quiet. Temples etc were quiet. Waterfall pictures with 5 or 10 other people in, not 50. The 'mass tourism' wasn't anywhere near as bad as I expected.  
- One of us got hit by Bali Belly (well, a parasite); health care was exceptional coming to the villa, giving him loads of medication, checking in with him the next day, writing down instructions clearly. We were very impressed and it helped him be on the mend after 2 days.  
*Specific things we did and I'd recommend*:  
- ATV/Quad drive with 'Kuber'. Absolutely brilliant, adapts to the group's level, lovely guides  
- Rafting (the men did this, whilst the girls had a spa day)  
- Grabbing a massage wherever you can, and going with reviews rather than prices. Best massage I had was a tiny place that cost basically nothing. The worst one was the more expensive one; figures.   
- Cooking lesson (including market visit and rice fields visit)  
- 8 hour private driver to visit Tegallalang rice terraces, Pura Gunung Kawi temples, Coffee Plantation etc  
- 8 hour private driver to visit Bindumale Twin Waterfalls, the water temple etc.  


**NUSA LEMBONGAN**  
- Only pre-booked the transfers which included pick-up from Ubud, boat from Sanur to Lembongan, drive to villa on Lembongan, and vice versa but with a return to the airport. Was very worried about this and again, went super smoothly with lovely drivers, clear check-in etc, all our luggages made it safely across, nothing to worry about.   
- Booked a private snorkeling tour with Aquaman (as someone recommended here, THANK YOU!). A vastly superior experience than 6 years ago. Went out at 11.30 after low tide, saw 1 (!!) other boat the manta spot (last time we had 30+ and it was chaos), really good instructions, very safe.   
- Loved it so much went back just for the 'coral snorkelling' piece for an hour the next day, also really recommend; you basically drift with the tide so you aren't even having to swim, the boat follows you, and the coral and fish was insane.   
- Hired scooters via our AirBnB, no hassle, drove around the island as well as Ceningan. Very quiet compared to Ubud as did not want to risk trying it there.   
  
Not too experienced with posting so not sure if I can share images, but just wanted to share our experience. We had an absolutely lovely time, Bali was as good as I remembered, it wasn't overcrowded when we went, and we could have easily spent more time in both Ubud and Lembongan. I can't wait to visit again.   
  
I'm a crazy planner so feel free to hit me up for more details. ",6,1729250649.0,bali,0,1.0,False

So I am probably one of the most oblivious people when it comes to flirting or dating and I have a crush on this girl at uni. 
I have talked to my friends about her and the dynamic of our friendship and they don‚Äôt fully know what to make of it and neither do I. 

But so here is why I‚Äôm unsure - 

We‚Äôre pretty touchy with each other, not in a weird way of course but if we‚Äôre studying together then one way or another we end up lightly punching one another randomly or high fives, and she‚Äôll even make fun of how my hand is smaller then hers and we compare them (happened a few times now). But it sort of feels like we don‚Äôt go 5 minutes without some sort of random touch when we‚Äôre sitting together to study but maybe that‚Äôs my imagination or reading too into it. 
I think we‚Äôre pretty comfortable with each other, I like to believe that at least. It feels nice being with her and like making fun of one another or yapping, and I‚Äôve leaned on her shoulder before and she on mine. The other day I can‚Äôt remember exactly what happened but she made a sad face and like leaned into me but then within a moment quickly sat back up and in my head I was like okay that was weird a little. 

She also seems to give me anything I ask, like once she had her jacket off and I was like can I use it as a pillow or something to hold while in the lecture and she just hands it to me, or the same with her scarf. Actually her bag as well, I ask her for it and she was like, for a pillow? 
So she sorta just knows me now. Her bag is comfy to lay on it‚Äôs great. 

For context we‚Äôve only known one another since July or August I think and we‚Äôre from different areas so we haven‚Äôt saw each other outside of uni but we have gone to buy coffee, or a sweet treat or sat in the park. I am hoping to try hang out though eventually outside of meeting at uni. 

Anyway onto my next thing as to my confusion- 

She is on dating apps, and to me it seems like a boredom pass time, like it‚Äôs just some fun and I‚Äôll see her x-ing or liking someone, but then she also doesn‚Äôt reply a lot to people. She was meant to go on a date and then she didn‚Äôt and I asked her about it and she was like, we pushed it back but I haven‚Äôt replied since but one day I might when I have the energy. She makes a good amount of jokes about the energy or effort to reply. 

She seems to want to date someone but she also talks to me about how she wouldn‚Äôt now. 

She also doesn‚Äôt talk to me a lot like outside of uni. Like we do talk, and it‚Äôs not all about our course, she‚Äôs sent me random photos before, or a random TikTok, and I‚Äôve sent her random messages, but it‚Äôs not like a consistent like  we haven‚Äôt sent at least one message a day, so it‚Äôs sort of like if she was interested would she want to talk more or maybe she‚Äôs more of a none texter I‚Äôm not really sure.

Actually one weird thing was she sent me a TikTok of a famous lesbian couple with no context and we‚Äôve next talked about them before but she sent it to me and said they‚Äôre her fav couple. 

She has actually also said how she met the love of her life on public transport from a distance and then about dating and then I was like maybe I need to get back into the dating scene and she just was like nah don‚Äôt do that too much effort. 

There is some other random things but It‚Äôs late at night at the moment so I can‚Äôt really think of all the instances they‚Äôve kind of disappeared, but to whoever is reading this, thank you! And if possible do you have any advice on signs to look out for or things I should do?

I do not smoke, drink alcohol and even energetic drinks. So I have yellowish teeth, but the truth is that only I brush my teeth most in my family; for a year or two, I never saw my family member's brushing their teeth, but their teeth are whiter than mine, especially my father. My father only uses Miswak; he has never been to the dentist only once in his life when he should take his hatching wisdom teeth (because it hurt so bad), but he has one of the most perfect natural teeth I have seen. I tried to brush my teeth with toothpaste, baking soda, and active coal (you know, circle pills; I crushed them and used them as sprinkling to my toothbrush), but I don't know if I am not being disciplined (yes, I can not do this or skip teeth brushing for a couple days) or not brushing enough. I brush my teeth for about not 2 minutes but 3. My mother tells me that my natural teeth color is like that, but I don't believe her because, as I remember when I was younger, my teeth were whiter than that. You may say it's because of diet, but my little brother has the worst diet in our family, and he never brushes his teeth but has whiter teeth than me. If there are dentists out here, can somebody help me teach me what to do to get actual natural white teeth? because I don't want chemical or glued plastic white teeth (I saw that many people glue special white teeth looking like plastic). And I can drink coffee everyday and sodas 2-3 times a week. Thank you for your help!",0,1729249550.0,AskDocs,5,0.5,False

In the calm of the moment, everything feels right.

But wrapped in your arms, I would linger, not fall.

Content in this quiet, the chaos can wait,
Each kiss a promise, no need to hesitate.
As the clock ticks onward, I hold onto you,
In the morning's embrace, my heart finds its due.

So let the world spin, let the minutes unfold,
With you by my side, the morning feels gold.
Though the day may demand, and the duties may rise,
I carry your warmth, a love that never dies.

They came to pick something up at mine. I made some coffee and the same dynamics just repeated.

First thing they asked 'Am I still using cannabis ' then the exact same questions they always ask that they should already know the answer to because I've been going through this for years with pretty fixed answers.

Either they don't remember or they are fishing or just don't really give a fuck to build on the layers of information I have given them over the years of insane repetition.

This was extra peculiar because I made a real effort decorating my living space over the summer and got some nice plants in. He never made any mention of it...... 


It's completely mental anyone else had any similar experiences? ",6,1729246920.0,recoverywithoutAA,3,0.88,False

We made it to Friday!  I hope you're still asleep and I wish you a fantastic and amazing day!  Here's a nice little something for you to wake up to!  I'm awake, I've got to exercise, read a little from the Bible, and shower before heading to work.  And coffee...it's DEFINITELY a coffee morning.   Your fiance turned into a coffee guy...didn't know that was possible lol!

I hope you have a beautiful morning, and remember, you can do ANYTHING!  The sky is the limit, and your incredible!
