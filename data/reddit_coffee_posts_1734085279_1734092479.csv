","Hi all,

I recently got myself a DeLonghi Eletta Cappuccino, excited to make barista-level cappuccinos at home. However, after several attempts, I‚Äôm starting to feel a bit defeated. The cappuccino I‚Äôm making isn‚Äôt as smooth as I‚Äôd like, and the coffee itself has a bit of a sour taste.

I‚Äôve tried tweaking the settings and have experimented with at least three different types of beans so far, but I haven‚Äôt landed on that ‚Äúmagic combination‚Äù that works. I‚Äôm wondering if it‚Äôs just me, or maybe the machine isn‚Äôt living up to the hype.

Does anyone have a tried-and-true setup (specific beans + machine settings) that works wonders with this model? I‚Äôd love to hear any tips or recommendations before I consider sending it back.

Thanks in advance for your help‚Äîmy caffeine fix depends on it! ",1,1734092102.0,DeLonghi,0,1.0,False

I spend somewhere 20 to 30 minutes sitting outside work until it‚Äôs time to clock in. during lunch I walk to the local coffee shop or I go there after work. After work I‚Äôll wander around to either the gym, coffee shop, or look at books at the small indie book store. 

My stepmother doesn‚Äôt really like it when others are in the kitchen. Either when they‚Äôre in there or when she‚Äôs in there she likes to be alone. She‚Äôll wait for them to come out.

At first I thought it was okay , that I don't mind just having casual acquaintances at work, but then we had a conversation once where I labelled us as ""great acquaintances"" and he got offended by it. He said that me saying we aren't friends offends him cause in his mind we are. Then I told him that if someone only talks to you at work, doesn't want to text or hangout then they aren't friends. It would all be okay, but he pressed on the issue and I don't know what to think of it. I would love to be friends and do stuff together but he doesnt.

Am I in the wrong? I don't know what to think of this situation. 

Btw, neither of us is into each other so that is out of question.",2,1734090812.0,socialskills,7,1.0,False
1hdakl1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1hdakl1/what_could_i_do_differently/,What could I do differently? ,"
So, I currently live with my father, stepmother, and little brother in their home. It‚Äôs a two bed one bath small house. My father and stepmother gave me their room while they sleep in the living room. The living situation isn‚Äôt terrible but it also isn‚Äôt great either. I mean nothing psychical. Just a lot of other things like controlling and narcism. 

I feel like my life is in limbo, like I‚Äôm just floating around or existing. I currently work in a small grocery store. I can‚Äôt help but notice the different uniform that me and the chef wear than the rest of the store. I can also see some of the signs. It seems that they don‚Äôt exactly want me there but they need me there. They hire a few new people but they don‚Äôt seem to stay long. 

My experience is only limited to a factory job and mostly retail. I currently work with food like making meals at my store. don‚Äôt exactly hate the job but I don‚Äôt really like it either. There are a few coworkers that I don‚Äôt really like all that much.  One of them is the chef who I can‚Äôt help but hope they‚Äôll find a replacement for. He seems to mess up the food, has an attitude and complains to the customers. 

This one other coworker micromanages, asks me personal questions. like when and what I‚Äôm having for lunch, who‚Äôs picking me up later, etc.. she can be overbearing at times, she‚Äôs been there over 6 years though she‚Äôs not the manager. The job is close by the house like walking distance. It also offers some good benefits, but they pay less than $16 an hour. 

I have a learners permit but I don‚Äôt have a car or a drivers license. I took the one drivers Ed near me and we practiced for 15 hours. They gave me a certificate for driving 15 hours. My father owns two cars in his name. He can‚Äôt exactly reach me he‚Äôs in his 70‚Äôs and retired. His health isn‚Äôt too good, he has bad eyesight and hardly ever drives anymore. My stepmother has a drivers license but doesn‚Äôt really want to teach me how to drive. 

I don‚Äôt really have any friends or family to teach me. There are other driving schools out in the suburbs but they only seem to offer Saturdays and I work Saturdays. 

I get dropped off at work by my stepmother then she comes back home to take my little brother to school. I spend somewhere 20 to 30 minutes sitting outside work until it‚Äôs time to clock in. during lunch I walk to the local coffee shop or I go there after work. After work I‚Äôll wander around to either the gym, coffee shop, or look at books at the small indie book store. 

My stepmother doesn‚Äôt really like it when others are in the kitchen. Either when they‚Äôre in there or when she‚Äôs in there she likes to be alone. She‚Äôll wait for them to come out. The kitchen is small, narrow and the fridge is small too. I‚Äôve been given rides to the store before and she‚Äôll literally cook me a meal the same night or the day after. Like I‚Äôd have food in the fridge and she‚Äôll cook the same very few meals. Ride, beans on the stove, and or this chicken soup with foods she finds around the kitchen.  

If I bring food then I‚Äôm expected to share. Or I‚Äôm asked if I brought some for others. If I put it in the fridge she‚Äôll throw it out in a few hours or so. I‚Äôve been trying to eat, drink water, use the bathroom before I get home. Or at least eat what I want to eat. They like to get fast foods like McDonald‚Äôs, Burger King, dollar tree etc..

I often times go out to eat. Either it be sushi, pizza, Spanish food, nothing too expensive just like what‚Äôs around me. Or smoothies, and a√ßa√≠ bowls at the gym. when I‚Äôm at home I fairly sit around, brush my teeth, scroll on my phone until like it‚Äôs time for bed. Then the day basically repeats itself.

A couple friends and I have a tradition of traveling to one road game a year, and Pittsburgh is our destination this time around. As an out-of-state moron who knows very little about Pittsburgh, I was hoping for some advice on:

* Best neighborhoods to stay in: Looking for a combination of good vibes, walkability, and easy access to the arena. Would love to know of any cool bars, coffee shops, or spots to explore nearby.
* Things to do in town: Any must-see attractions, unique shops, or local eats we shouldn't miss? Primanti's is the big one, but I‚Äôm open to any recommendations for food and drinks.
* Hidden gems or off-the-beaten-path activities: anything lesser known that might take a little digging to find. 

We will have plenty of time in the city outside of the game, so we want to make the most of our visit. Any and all tips would be super appreciated!

1hdaked,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1hdaked/be_careful_where_you_camp_out_in_australia/,Be careful where you camp out in Australia,"I‚Äôve been pretty much all around Australia. Take my word for it, the best way to see this country is by car. There‚Äôs just so many little hidden secrets and pockets of paradise you miss if you try to do it all by bus or train, or simply jetting between the major cities.

My memories of roadtripping Australia are for the most part positive. Sure there‚Äôs been some ups and downs along the way. But that‚Äôs life isn‚Äôt it? You just keep pushing forward. And that‚Äôs what I did.

There‚Äôs one notable stopover that still stands out though. An event which very nearly convinced me to pack in my adventurous spirit for good. I‚Äôll recount this as best I can.

It was sometime around late September, a few years ago now, and I was headed from Barrage Bay up to Narooma. It‚Äôs a gorgeous coastal drive for the most part, aside from a little detour inland as you pass Wallaga Lake.

The best part of roadtripping is the impulsivity, especially when you‚Äôre driving a fully equipped camper van like me. You can pull in just about anywhere for a break, as long as the area you‚Äôre pulling up at isn‚Äôt illegal for camping and what not‚Ä¶ and so I did, as I came around the bending roads of that beautiful lakeside drive.

I found a picture perfect spot to camp out for the night. Remote, peaceful‚Ä¶ just the way I liked it. I set up my camp, got a hot pot of coffee going, and kicked back in the deck chair soaking up the sun.

I got there right on sunset, so it was absolutely ideal. September can be a little warmer, but in the early mornings and creeping into the evenings that time of year, you won‚Äôt find better weather down under.

I was gazing out over those crystal clear blue waters, when I heard someone speak‚Ä¶

*‚Äúungwarr ananyi‚Äù...*

Needless to say, this startled me. There was no one around, well there certainly hadn't been a moment ago anyway.

*‚Äúungwarr ananyi‚Äù‚Ä¶* 

Again! That same voice. That‚Äôs when I realised, there **was** no one around. I was hearing the voice in my head. Bloody hell, I must be out of it, I thought. It had been a long drive.¬†

***ungwarr ananyi!!***

Louder this time. And sending shockwaves through my head. Every time it spoke out, it was like the kick of a bass drum reverberating from the inside out of my brain. It hurt...

And this is when shit got real bizarre. Three kids came tearing out from the bush, breaking the tree line right behind my camper. They were shouting at me and pointing to the road, screaming ‚ÄúGo! Go! Leave now!‚Äù.

These kids were clearly Indigenous. Don‚Äôt get the wrong idea I don‚Äôt mean some stereotypical image of Indigenous Australian tribes living deep in the bush. They were just some local kids from a nearby camp. They sure seemed to know something I didn‚Äôt though. And it didn‚Äôt sound good.

I decided I‚Äôd best heed their advice. This, coupled with that weird voice was giving me a bad feeling. I packed up my stuff and scrambled back inside my camper. I strapped into the drivers seat, turned the engine over and flicked on the high beams. As I did so, the yellow beams of light shot straight into the dark bushland ahead, and illuminated something massive. 

It was huge. I shit you not, 12 feet at the bare minimum. It had an almost spider like appearance, its arms and legs stuck straight out to the sides. Its face was pale white. I'm sure you're familiar with the Slenderman, right? The face on this thing was like him, but with a nasty scowl, his eyes beady and shimmering red. And its body... it was just like this shadowy, globby mass. In my head, the same voice from before, but it said nothing, just a low growl...

*‚Äúgrrrrrrrrrr‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..‚Äù*

The kids start bashing and kicking my camper now, but not like they meant me harm or anything, like they were urging me to leave. They screamed something out at me, a word I‚Äôll never forget. ‚ÄúDulagal! Dulagal!‚Äù, they shouted, over and over.

Again, that voice from before, but MUCH louder this time, echoed through my head.

*‚Äúungwarr ananyi!!‚Äù*

I watched, as this thing slowly, yet deliberately, pivoted on its right foot, and then began walking sideways towards my car. No, really, it just kind of toppled from one stumpy leg to the other, blundering sideways toward my van. All the while, that pale white face was fixed on me... its angry expression contorting further and further as it got closer. That was it. I was out. I stepped on the pedal and floored it off down the highway.

As I sped off down the road, I caught glimpses of this abomination in my rearview mirror, wobbling sideways, step by step down the highway, following my car. Thankfully, it did not appear capable of picking up the kind of speed necessary to close the gap, and I watched as it slowly disappeared into the darkness of the night.

That was my first and last time to have ever witnessed anything in my travels I would call otherworldly. I did not need to look very far for answers as to what I bore witness to that dark September night. A simple search for a single word those kids shouted at me would turn up everything I needed to know‚Ä¶

*‚ÄúDulagal‚Äù.*

Straight out of Wikipedia... 

*‚ÄúThe Dulagal is a large spider like creature of Aboriginal dreamings. It is said to have bright red eyes and it stalks Mount Gulaga. It is said that on dark nights, one might catch a glimpse of him, walking sideways across the planes‚Äù.*

Where I was camped was a straight shot south from Mount Gulaga. So, it fits. Why this thing was down by the lakeside when he‚Äôs said to stalk the mountain, I don‚Äôt know. Maybe he sees all this land surrounding the mountain as his territory. Maybe he was on the hunt. I don‚Äôt know.

This search did lead me to look into another phrase I heard that night. Those words which reverberated inside my mind over and over. This is of the Gooniyandi language, and it loosely translates into ‚Äúplease‚Ä¶ go‚Äù.

What I can‚Äôt figure out is whether this voice in my head was the Dulagal, or something else. A protector spirit perhaps. This‚Ä¶ Dulagal thing‚Ä¶ it did not appear to have my best interests in mind. No, more than that, everything about its demeanour that night, looked as though it meant me harm.

The actions of the kids, too. They were frantically urging me to get out. Like they knew if I stayed there, something bad was gonna happen. If it weren‚Äôt for them, maybe it would have. But nah, I don‚Äôt reckon it was that Dulagal talking to me that night. He woulda been quite happy to sneak right up on me. 

Still to this day I can‚Äôt shake the image of that awkward, sideways walk, as he lumbered out from those trees.",3,1734090738.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

Now, mind you, the doors were locked when I left it. Or at least I thought they were.

So, I knock on the window like, ‚ÄúExcuse me, this is my car.‚Äù And he casually rolls the window down and goes, ‚ÄúOh, hey! I was waiting for you. Want to grab breakfast?‚Äù

WAIT. WHAT?

At this point, I‚Äôm torn between calling the cops and asking him if he‚Äôs okay. Turns out, the dude thought my car was his friend's ride and just‚Ä¶ made himself comfortable. Apparently, he had been waiting there since 5 AM thinking his buddy was playing some kind of prank.

Here‚Äôs the kicker: I offered him a ride to his actual friend‚Äôs place (I know, questionable decision-making on my part), and now we chat every now and then. He even Venmo‚Äôd me $50 for gas, so I guess I can‚Äôt complain?

Moral of the story: Always double-check your locks, and maybe don‚Äôt let random strangers into your car. Or do. You might end up with a weird but wholesome story to tell.

Bible Verse
-----------

2 Timothy 2:11 (NIV): ‚ÄúHere is a trustworthy saying: If we died with him, we will also live with him.‚Äù

Meaning
-------

This verse is packed with profound truths about our relationship with Christ. Paul, the author of Timothy, refers to the deep spiritual truth of unity with Jesus. ‚ÄúIf we died with him,‚Äù signifies our participation in Christ‚Äôs suffering and death, symbolized through baptism, where we die to our old selves and are reborn into a new life in Christ.

The promise that ‚Äúwe will also live with him‚Äù assures us of our eternal inheritance, emphasizing that just as Jesus rose from the dead, we too will experience resurrection life. This isn‚Äôt only a future promise but a present reality‚Äîinviting us to live differently, with hope and courage, knowing our lives are united with Christ‚Äôs eternal life.

Moreover, this passage challenges us to live our lives fully surrendered to God‚Äôs purposes. This death to self means letting go of our desires, choosing to trust in God‚Äôs will and timing. It‚Äôs a call to deeper fellowship and commitment to Christ, inviting us to experience the abundant life He offers.

As followers of Christ, this verse encourages us to embrace our identity as God‚Äôs children and live with the assured hope that our eternal destiny is secure. It‚Äôs a reminder that in Christ, we find true life, purpose, and fulfillment.

Actions to Take
---------------

‚Äì Embrace daily surrender by beginning each day in prayer, asking God to guide your thoughts, words, and actions.

‚Äì Study the life of Jesus in the Gospels and meditate on His example of faithfulness and obedience.

‚Äì Practice gratitude, reflecting on the eternal life you‚Äôve been given and thanking God daily for this gift.

‚Äì Join a faith-based group or Bible study to strengthen your connection with others on a similar journey.

‚Äì Share the hope of eternal life with someone who may not know Christ, showing love and compassion in your relationships.

Journal Prompts

‚Äì How can embracing my new life in Christ impact my daily decisions?

‚Äì What does it mean to me personally to ‚Äúdie with Christ‚Äù and ‚Äúlive with Him‚Äù?

Prayer
------

Dear Heavenly Father,

Thank You for the incredible hope and promise found in You. Help me to embrace the truth that if I died with Christ, I will also live with Him. May this knowledge transform my daily life, giving me courage to live with purpose and intention. Teach me to surrender fully to Your will and trust in Your eternal promises. Guide my actions and heart so that I reflect Your love to others. Thank You for the gift of new life in Christ, and may I always seek to know You more. In Jesus‚Äô name, I pray. Amen.

1hda8xc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bakkt/comments/1hda8xc/interesting_things_about_bakkt/, interesting things about bakkt,"Well, as you know, Mr. President Trump rang the Opening Bell at NYSE today.  
  
There are a few interesting things here that I would like to share with everyone  
  
1. The men standing right next to him at the ceremony was Jeffrey Sprecher - the founder and CEO of global stock exchange operator Intercontinental Exchange, also known as ICE.  
  
2. ICE holds a 55% stake in BAKKT, President Trump also holds over 50% stake in Trump Media and coincidentally, Trump Media is rumored to be in ""advanced talks"" to buy BAKKT entirely with stock.  
  
3. Another interesting thing is that Jeffrey Sprecher's wife is Kelly Loeffler, they have been married for 15 years. On December 4, 2024, President Trump has tapped former Georgia Sen. Kelly Loeffler to lead the Small Business Administration. She is the current co-chair of Trump's second inaugural committee. She is also the former CEO of BAKKT, a commodity and cryptocurrency trading platform that Trump‚Äôs Truth Social media company has been in talks to purchase.  
  
4. Also during the ceremony, when interviewed by Jim Cramer, President Trump said that ""We are going to do something great with crypto"".  
  
5. Throughout today's trading session, BAKKT's stock continued to rise, clearly reflecting investors' expectations for the future of BAKKT as well as the success of the deal with Trump Media. Don't forget to look at BAKKT's stock chart in recent days, the numbers don't lie.  
  
There are too many coincidences here, what do you think?

Hey everyone,

I recently had a weird experience with my laptop, and I want to share it here to see if anyone can offer additional insights or has experienced something similar.


 I accidentally spilled coffee on my external mouse and its USB cable and a little bit in the bottom of my laptop but id didn't get inside or near the fans 

After cleaning the surface and thinking it was fine, I connected the mouse to my laptop. But the mouse get a huge amount of coffee 



What Happened:

I experienced the following issues shortly after connecting the mouse:

And when i connect the external mouse my laptop refused to take any input outside the game i opened but when i restarted the laptop and connected other mouse everything works fine

My laptop screen suddenly turned bright white with green lines it happens after an hour and after 3 force shutdowns After a few seconds, the screen went black
Then, everything returned to normal "" thats happens when i was connected the effected external mouse "" .




 I disconnected the mouse entirely.


After powering the laptop back on without the mouse connected, everything seemed to work fine.

"" The white screen wit green light or more like bright screen not white it happened only one times ""  and its been more than 24 hours. 


I tested the laptop thoroughly to ensure no recurring issues:

No more white screens or green lines.

GPU-intensive tasks (like games) ran smoothly.

No errors or crashes.




My Concerns:

Could the coffee-damaged mouse have caused a short circuit or signal interference through the USB port?

Is my GPU or any other internal component at risk due to this incident?

Are there any steps I should take to prevent future problems?


Current Situation:

Everything seems fine now‚Äîno glitches or performance issues. I‚Äôm avoiding using the damaged mouse and keeping a close eye on the laptop's behavior.

Has anyone faced something like this before? Could this incident have caused hidden damage I should worry about?

Thanks in advance for your advice!

At first she replied to my IG story and the ball started rolling there, we started chatting here and there and i feel it‚Äôs not me who just initiated stuff. So after a week, i don‚Äôt remember what‚Äôs the trigger but she‚Äôs started to promise me some ice cream and at first i thought she was just gonna buy me one, not asking me out to get some together. So we set up a plan, like a week after that.

We did went out in the end and it went pretty well, i just talk a lot about random stuff with her for 3 hours and i feel off we‚Äôre clicking off well with each other. Heck she even initiated more plans for me and her, we were supposed to go out again this weekend and she even asked if i have the time to spend new years together.

Now here‚Äôs where i thought it kinda fell apart, it was a few days after we went out. I was pretty low key about my interactions with her, i didn‚Äôt really tell anybody about it, until i tell my dorm mates(who‚Äôs also work in the same place as i am, which is mistake number 1 from me) that i was gonna go out and get some coffee together with her. Ofc they were surprised, and i thought nothing of it until during work day one of them tease me about it in front of my supervisor. This was my second mistake, sincei didn‚Äôt really do anything about it or deny anything, i know how nasty gossip can be in work place. She and i work in different units, so it‚Äôs pretty rare for me to interact with her on work hours. 

But lo and behold it spread, it was wednesday when she asked me whether or not i told anybody about how she ask me out, i told her i only told my dorm mates about it.  She told me about how it has spread, she thanks for knowing her. And i ask her, why is she saying this and she replied with how she didn‚Äôt like other co workers prying into her private life and how she didn‚Äôt want to dragged me in to this, now this is where we start talking less and she just avoid answering my questions about this incident.

So, i apologise to her, by saying i didn‚Äôt meant for any of this to happen and i don‚Äôt mean to make things awkward for her. And that I hope i could to still to get to know her better or if she didn‚Äôt want it that way i hope we could still be friends(since she started avoiding me).

She said it wasn‚Äôt my fault, and she hopes so too, and i feel like this was my 3rd mistake since i ask her which one is she hoping of, which she avoids answering about it by ghosting me.

I was pretty hurt about this whole situation, i feel like i fucked up a lot in this situation. Did i look at her advance in the wrong way? She also had an ex she dated there for 2 years(I didn‚Äôt know about this since i was only started working there for 2 months now) So i thought maybe she had a trauma from that.

So how do i approach this situation? She‚Äôs a fun person to talk to, i feel like she gives me a lot of chances on how to approach her unless i look at it the wrong way and she just wants to be friends, which makes me hurt a bit but im okay with it. I think the point is, i just want a closure or just put this behind me. That‚Äôs the kind of person i am.

So, should i ask her about it again or just left it here?",1,1734089177.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

It raises the question that nags at every pet lover's mind‚Äîwhy does dog smell bad? Is it something you've done‚Äîor haven‚Äôt done? Perhaps it‚Äôs simply a characteristic of your breed. In this article, we‚Äôll explore the various reasons why your pup might be emitting less-than-pleasant odors and how to tackle this issue head-on. So grab a cup of coffee, kick back, and let‚Äôs dive deep into the world of canine smells!

The Science of Smell: What‚Äôs Going On?
--------------------------------------

First off, let's get down to the nitty-gritty. Dogs have an extremely sensitive sense of smell, far surpassing our human capabilities. When we talk about why does dog smell bad, we need to understand that dogs perceive the world through their noses. For them, odors carry tons of information, like a complicated message relayed in scents and pheromones.

But what about that distinct odor that makes us wrinkle our noses? Often, the source of this smell is linked to the very nature of the dog‚Äôs biology. Here are some common offenders:

### 1. Skin Issues

One of the most prevalent reasons for a stinky dog is skin problems. Dogs can suffer from a variety of skin conditions, from allergies to infections, and these issues can lead to a foul smell.

- **Allergies**: Just like humans, dogs can have allergic reactions to food, pollen, or even dust mites. These allergies can cause itching and inflammation, leading to secondary infections that can smell terrible.
- **Infections**: Bacterial or fungal infections can develop on your dog's skin, especially if they are already scratching away due to allergies. These infections often produce a yeasty odor that's hard to ignore.

### 2. Dental Dilemmas

Ah, the mouth‚Äîthe gateway to both nutrition and‚Ä¶ odor. If your dog‚Äôs breath could knock you over, it‚Äôs likely due to dental problems.

- **Periodontal Disease**: This is one of the leading causes of bad breath in dogs. Plaque and tartar build-up can lead to gum infections and, in severe cases, even tooth loss.
- **Dietary Choices**: What your dog eats plays a considerable role as well. Some foods may contribute to smelly breath, just like certain human diets can leave us feeling rank.

### 3. Ear Trouble

Believe it or not, those floppy ears can harbor some serious stink! Dog breeds with long ears are particularly prone to ear infections, which can cause a foul smell.

- **Bacteria and Yeast**: An imbalance of bacteria and yeast in the ear canal can produce a musty odor. If your dog shakes their head frequently or scratches at their ears, it's worth investigating.

### 4. Anal Glands

Now, this is a topic that might make you cringe, but hey, it‚Äôs just part of being a dog owner! Anal gland issues are common and can lead to some serious olfactory distress.

- **Impaction**: If the anal glands don‚Äôt express naturally, they can become impacted and lead to a fishy odor.
- **Infection**: Just like other areas of your dog‚Äôs body, these glands can also become infected, contributing to that nasty smell.

### 5. Bath Time?

Let‚Äôs face it; some dogs just don‚Äôt really enjoy bath time. But neglecting this essential grooming practice can lead to some serious odor issues.

- **Natural Oils**: Dogs‚Äô skin produces natural oils that serve to protect them, but too much can trap dirt and bacteria, resulting in a pungent aroma.
- **Dirt and Debris**: If your dog loves to roll around in mud or get into trash, it‚Äôs no surprise they‚Äôll start to smell. A good wash can work wonders!

The Role of Diet in Your Dog‚Äôs Odor
-----------------------------------

Feeding your dog the right kind of food can significantly affect how they smell. You might be raising an eyebrow, thinking, ‚ÄúHow could kibble possibly lead to a nose-wrinkling odor?‚Äù Believe it or not, diet plays a crucial role in many aspects of a dog‚Äôs health, including scent.

### 1. Quality of Ingredients

Not all dog foods are created equal. Low-quality foods often contain fillers, preservatives, and artificial ingredients that can lead to digestive issues. And guess what that means? Yup, smelly gas and potentially foul breath!

### 2. Food Allergies

Sometimes, your dog can develop an aversion to certain ingredients‚Äîlike chicken or beef‚Äîleading to gastrointestinal upset. This can cause flatulence and a range of other odors. You might just find yourself frantically googling ‚Äúwhy does dog smell bad?‚Äù

### 3. Special Diets

Certain diets (like high-protein or raw) can also change your dog‚Äôs odor profile. If you're considering a dietary change, consult your vet first to avoid any unnecessary olfactory disasters!

Tackling the Stink: Practical Tips for Dog Owners
-------------------------------------------------

So now that we've broken down the causes of these funky smells, how do you rectify the situation? Luckily, you‚Äôve got a plethora of options at your fingertips.

### 1. Regular Grooming

Here‚Äôs a no-brainer: regular baths and grooming sessions can help keep odors at bay.

- **Frequency**: Most dogs should be bathed once a month, but it may vary based on your dog's breed and lifestyle. Use specialized dog shampoo to avoid drying out their skin.
- **Brushing**: Regular brushing helps remove loose hair, dirt, and dander while distributing natural oils to keep your dog‚Äôs coat healthy and fresh.

### 2. Vet Visits

When in doubt, consult the experts! If you notice persistent odors despite your best efforts, it could be time for a visit to the vet.

- **Dental Checks**: Make sure to schedule regular dental check-ups, as your vet can clean your dog‚Äôs teeth and catch any emerging issues.
- **Skin Assessment**: Keeping an eye on skin health can prevent further problems. Your vet can recommend suitable medications or treatments for allergies or infections.

### 3. Diet Adjustments

If you suspect that your dog‚Äôs diet could be contributing to the smell, it might be time for a change.

- **High-Quality Food**: Opt for premium dog foods with natural ingredients to support overall health and minimize bad odors.
- **Trial and Error**: Sometimes, it takes a bit of experimentation to find the right food that doesn‚Äôt upset their stomach.

### 4. Maintain Ear Hygiene

Regularly checking and cleaning your dog's ears can go a long way toward preventing infections and the odors that come along with them.

- **Cleaning Routine**: Depending on the breed, you might need to clean their ears weekly or monthly. Always consult your veterinarian about the best cleaning method.

### 5. Keep an Eye on Anal Gland Health

Monitoring your dog's anal glands can help avoid unpleasant surprises. Some breeds may require regular expressions while others can manage on their own.

- **Signs of Trouble**: Be vigilant for signs like scooting, excessive licking, or a strong odor. If things seem off, consulting your vet is a must.

Natural Remedies to Combat Dog Odor
-----------------------------------

Who said you need to rely solely on commercial products? Sometimes, natural remedies can give your dog that refreshing boost without the unwanted chemicals.

### 1. Apple Cider Vinegar

This pantry staple isn‚Äôt just for salads! Mixing equal parts apple cider vinegar and water can create an effective skin rinse that fights odor and balances pH.

### 2. Baking Soda

Familiar with the wonder that is baking soda? Sprinkling a little on your dog‚Äôs bed or area can help neutralize odors.

### 3. Essential Oils

Some pet owners swear by essential oils for a fresh scent. However, always consult your vet before using oils like lavender or chamomile, as some can be toxic to dogs.

### 4. Fresh Fruits and Veggies

Adding a few fresh fruits and vegetables to your dog's diet can help eliminate odors from within. Carrots, apples, and green beans make excellent snacks that can aid in maintaining a fresh breath.

Recognizing When It's More Than Just Smell
------------------------------------------

While many odors may stem from benign sources, some smells can indicate serious health issues. Here‚Äôs a quick reference to note when to seek immediate veterinary advice:

1. **Fishy Odor**: This could signal a potential anal gland issue.
2. **Sweet or Fruity Breath**: It may suggest diabetes and needs urgent medical attention.
3. **Rotten Smell**: Foul-smelling breath may occur alongside dental disease and requires a vet check.

Conclusion
----------

So there you have it! Answering the question of why does dog smell bad involves understanding various factors like skin health, dental hygiene, diet, and even ear care. By taking proactive steps‚Äîlike regular grooming, vet check-ups, and careful consideration of diet‚Äîyou can keep your canine companion smelling fresh and fabulous.

Remember, while every dog has its own unique scent (some more pleasant than others!), a strong odor shouldn‚Äôt be ignored. If in doubt, always consult your veterinarian to ensure your furry friend is happy and healthy.

Trust me, I was exactly where you are ‚Äì surviving on coffee and wondering if I'd ever sleep more than 2 hours straight again!

What actually worked for us:

* Starting with a solid bedtime routine (bath, lotion, book, sleep sack, white noise)
* Putting baby down drowsy but awake (took me forever to figure this out!)
* Checking in at 5, 10, then 15-minute intervals
* Being consistent (hardest part, especially at 3 AM üò©)

What totally failed:

* Cry it out method (my anxiety couldn't handle it)
* Trying to night wean at the same time (too much at once)
* Starting when we had family visiting (bad timing)

The game-changer? Accepting that some nights would be harder than others. We're now getting 6-hour stretches of sleep, which feels like HEAVEN.

She sits at the edge of her world, a chipped mug of coffee in her hand. The steam rises, curling like the stale gossip that sticks to her name in family WhatsApp groups. A divorcee. A failure. Another woman who couldn‚Äôt make it work. That‚Äôs what they say.

She wanted to be an IAS officer, once. Big dreams, sharp dreams. But her father was a doctor, her uncle too. Her kid sister? A gynecologist now. So, they shoved her into medicine like they were loading a truck. She was good at it, sure. Good enough to pass. Good enough to put up with the patients waiting outside while she sipped her coffee, slow. Good enough to feel like a fraud.

Then there was him. The writer with no money and big ideas. She met him at 22, fell hard, moved in. He quit his engineering job to chase words and blank pages. He said it was freedom. She called it unpaid labor. The money from her parents barely stretched. She cooked his meals, washed his clothes, swept his floors. She edited his sentences when they were weak, tightened his metaphors when they slumped. She carried the weight of him, and he let her.

When he conned his parents into paying for his journalism degree, nothing changed except that he spent less time with her. He said the coursework was brutal. She said nothing. When he finally landed a job, it paid him crumbs. But crumbs are better than nothing, and for once, she let herself believe this was the start of something.

It wasn‚Äôt.

He became the guy who worked 16-hour days. He became the guy who touched his laptop more than her. He became the guy she visited every two months after she took a government job back in her hometown. It was like visiting a stranger she used to know.

She stayed anyway. She thought she owed him that much. Years of her life poured into building him into someone the world respected. The guy who earned a six-figure salary. The guy who came from nothing but was now everything, except hers.

And then her father ended up in the ICU. She begged him to come. He didn‚Äôt. He had deadlines, he said. That‚Äôs when she knew. She packed up her hope, shoved it in a corner, and signed the damn divorce papers.

The aunties wagged their tongues, called it rebellion. She calls it survival. One life. That‚Äôs all she‚Äôs got.

Now she sits at her desk. Sometimes she cries. Mostly she works. The mornings are still gray, but at least they belong to her.

She rolls her sleeves, not for a man or for a meal, but for something better. Something she can‚Äôt see yet but feels deep in her gut, like the first throb of a new bruise.

When the world looks at her, it sees damage. A broken thing. She looks in the mirror and sees a crack.

üé¨ Two Buzzwords Walk into a Studio‚Ä¶ üé¨
So, you‚Äôre scrolling through LinkedIn, and BAM! Someone casually drops ‚Äúmotion graphics‚Äù and ‚Äúanimation‚Äù like they‚Äôre interchangeable. It‚Äôs like calling a cappuccino a latte‚Äîsure, they‚Äôre both coffee, but one‚Äôs frothier than your boss‚Äôs brainstorming sessions. Let‚Äôs settle this once and for all: motion graphics and animation may be cousins, but they‚Äôre definitely not twins.


---

üíÉ Motion Graphics: The Minimalist Dancer üíÉ
Motion graphics is like that friend who shows up to the party in a sleek black outfit and still steals the spotlight. It‚Äôs all about clean lines, elegant typography, and smooth transitions. Think of it as the Beyonc√© of the design world‚Äîit‚Äôs here to SLAY without breaking a sweat. From logos doing a cheeky spin to graphs coming to life like they‚Äôve had their morning coffee, motion graphics is the art of making simplicity look sexy.


---

üé≠ Animation: The Drama Queen of Visuals üé≠
And then there‚Äôs animation. Oh boy, animation doesn‚Äôt just walk into the room‚Äîit cartwheels, somersaults, and flips its way in with fireworks exploding behind it. Animation isn‚Äôt just moving shapes; it‚Äôs telling stories, evoking emotions, and sometimes making you cry over a lamp (thanks, Pixar). It‚Äôs the epic tale where every character has a backstory, every scene has drama, and every pixel has a purpose.


---

üìä Graphs vs. Giraffes: The Use Case Smackdown üìä
Here‚Äôs the thing: motion graphics shines when you need to explain something‚Äîquickly and beautifully. Business reports? Motion graphics. App demo? Motion graphics. Animation, on the other hand, steps in when you need to build a world or make people feel something. Explaining profit margins with motion graphics = cool. Explaining profit margins with a cartoon giraffe = questionable.


---

‚öîÔ∏è When the Two Join Forces‚Ä¶ ‚öîÔ∏è
Now, here‚Äôs where it gets juicy. Motion graphics and animation sometimes collaborate! Imagine a clean motion graphic morphing into an animated sequence‚Äîlike a pie chart coming alive and dancing off the screen. Together, they‚Äôre the peanut butter and jelly of video production: smooth, satisfying, and impossible to resist.


---

ü§î Wait, So Which Is Better? ü§î
That‚Äôs like asking, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs better: pizza or tacos?‚Äù The answer is: YES. It all depends on what you‚Äôre craving. Want to impress the boardroom? Go motion graphics. Want to create a short film about a lonely robot finding love in a post-apocalyptic world? Animation‚Äôs your jam.


---

üöÄ Takeaway Time: Let‚Äôs Get Moving! üöÄ
Whether it‚Äôs the sleek efficiency of motion graphics or the emotional depth of animation, both are tools that can bring your ideas to life. So, next time someone mixes them up, you can confidently say, ‚ÄúMotion graphics is the efficient, stylish power move. Animation is the cinematic, heartstring-pulling experience. And both? Total rockstars.‚Äù

I am a wanted man.



You see, I killed my Dad, and I plan to kill again.¬†



He was diagnosed with aggressive lymphoma in 2025. Chemo failed, stem-cell treatment too, but then there was something experimental called CAR-T.¬†



It was pricey- 500k, but then Dad had insurance‚Äì One Priority Health‚Äì but what do you think happened? They dragged their feet‚Äì Mr Melrose and his company tied us up in litigation, arguing it wasn‚Äôt a drug, but a gene therapy.¬†



So Dad‚Äôs cancer went terminal.¬†



A silver lining in this toxic cloud was the 2026 law on Assisted Dying. This his insurance covered because the death of sick people is good for business.¬†



The Sarco Pod sat like a torpedo in our house, and then Dad climbed in, wasted away like an Egyptian mummy.¬†



We said our goodbyes, the pod pumped in nitrogen, and then something went wrong.¬†



I was forced to crack open the sarcophagus as Dad frantically clutched his throat.¬†



According to the law, he had to die by his own hand, but when I looked into his eyes screaming ‚Äòkill me,‚Äô I did the machine‚Äôs job‚Äî squeezing his windpipe until the twitching stopped.¬†



One Priority Health was also deeply involved in Sarco Pods. Turns out, they made their machines with a backdoor built-in obsolescence.¬†



I fled my family home before the police arrived, and that is how I find myself here.¬†



‚Ä¶



A secretary brings me a coffee, and I look over the Manhattan skyline. In my bag, I have my fake credentials and a handgun.¬†



‚ÄòMr Melrose will see you now.‚Äô¬†



And I stand and think, Ah yes, the horse, the camel, the elephant, the donkey. It doesn‚Äôt matter your metaphor; the last straw has broken our collective backs, and we won‚Äôt take it anymore.

I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

1hd9bdb,https://www.reddit.com/r/hungryjacks/comments/1hd9bdb/how_many_shifts_can_i_expect_as_a_21m_casual/,How many shifts can I expect as a 21M casual worker?,"Hey guys and girls,

21M here. I recently started at Hungry Jacks in September, and due to some issues, didn't get rostered for a single shift for 2 months, which is fine. I was finishing some coursework for university at the time, which I understand, and therefore I get that the store may have been a bit slack, and I may have been a bit slack too.

However, now, because I have finally had 3 shifts - two training shifts and one cover shift. I feel that it is time to ask: **how many shifts will I get per week as a casual worker?**

I am available all 168 hours of the week at the moment due to taking a year off university. I am rostered for 28 hours next week which is sort of where I want to be, however I know this won't keep up for very long as it is holidays and people generally have time off.

And, true to that philosophy, the week after next I am rostered only once, on Friday 27th, and the week after only once on Monday 30th.

I know I am on the unfortunate end of the age bracket, being 21, so I can probably expect much less hours than the younger workers. **When can I expect the drop off, and what do you guys expect the drop off / weekly shift rate to be? I want to get at least 3-4 shifts per week, but even at a store where most workers are actually in the older demographic, I am scared of being only given one or even none per week.**

Any workers have any advice / tips? My manager and my district manager both work in the store that I work at, and both of them are very nice people who I seem to get along very well with. I try to not over-socialise which the other members are VERY prone to doing, and just do what is required of me being so old at a job where I am literally a trainee member.

***EDIT: Do you guys know when I will get to learn EVERYTHING in the store? Currently, I have been doing drinks / coffees / drive thru during my first three shifts, but I want to quickly master everything so that I can transfer stores as this store is not the closest to my house. My manager has said that after the 6 months probationary period I will have learnt, but this sounds like a really long and unnecessary time considering I really can't afford to keep working at this shop as I need to take either public transport or an uber to EVERY shift because I don't currently have a car.***",4,1734085349.0,hungryjacks,3,0.83,False

1hd9azi,https://v.redd.it/v40c7stvdl6e1,Massive improvement to my moka pot game,"This is 19.5g of medium roast coffee (80% arabica, 20% robusta) in a 4 cup Venus. I used room temp water on low heat. Grind was dead in-between espresso and pourover for fineness.

The gamechanger was using an Aeropress filter!! This is my first time getting foam like this. I had the same grind setting yesterday and didn't get this color and foaminess at all. It was still delicious, if a little bitter towards the end of the cup due to the fine sediment. Today, I also used 2.5g more coffee than before. Didn't tamp, but tapped a lot and left it very slightly mounded. Result was a beautifully dense, well-saturated puck that came out solid and not all sludgey like previous pucks. Thanks to the Aeropress filter, cleanup was also a breeze.

And the most important part--the taste! I divided into two cups and diluted with a good amount of water. A splash of heated milk, and... SO GOOD! The coffee is so delicious. I'm not getting any of that ""notes of cocoa and bark"" stuff that I hear about, but it was a very enjoyable cup and I'm looking forward to more of it in my future :)",10,1734085297.0,mokapot,5,0.92,False
