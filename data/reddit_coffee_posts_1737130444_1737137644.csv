TLD is in a unique place where a sequel is on the way, but Hinterland has chosen to set the game in winter again. While I would love to see a game or other media set in the summer, it's easy to see how important the winter and northern setting is for the franchise. It drives the design of the game to make the freezing cold such a menacing threat. It also drives the stories of desperation and makes the world building through frozen corpses and notes so much more real. For Blackfrost, I wouldn't have it any other way. Winter and Canada are tied to the DNA of TLD just like my coffee cup is tied to my hand.

With that being said, if Hinterland were to make another apocalyptic universe with a unique twist, what would you like to see? Things like zombies and killer plagues are overused in the genre, but could they make for a good game using TLD as a template? Does it focus on the protagonist, focus on story telling through NPCs and the world as a whole, or both? Not only is the cause of the apocalypse important, but the setting, time of year, and gameplay mechanics are as well. Why don't we see an apocalyptic wild west or pirate game? I've been so intrigued by apocalypse media that I even took an apocalypse literature class in college and loved it despite hating literature and language course. I hope to see if Blackfrost can nail the Quiet Apocalypse. Also, I hope to see the genre have a renaissance of sorts, because I can't remember the last time an apocalypse-themed game drew me in as much as TLD.",1,1737137387.0,thelongdark,0,1.0,False

I’ve also been smelling things that other people don’t smell. When I started taking Zyrtec my neuropathy started to calm down. 

I started then, to go down a rabbit hole of what to eat and not to eat. 

Ate pasta  with peppers and red sauce the other day and felt like fainting again. 

Ate yogurt and my throat closed up. 

Drank coffee with cream and my lips swelled. 

So now I’m going with an anti histamine diet.

On the first day I’ve noticed my symptoms calmed down in my legs.

The allergist took blood to test my tryptase levels. 

A lot of it is confusing. Eggs and mozzarella for example are supposedly low histamine but John Hopkins says don’t eat it.

Now I’m struggling to find a doctor to perceive me Cromolyn and Kitotifen because they don’t have the functional research. 

I can’t work-let alone sit to find a job. Everything hurts, my main symptoms is dizziness, sometimes itching, but mostly numbness and tingling in the feet and difficulty walking 

I’ve been treated so poorly by doctors. Now I eat the same thing everyday. If anyone can help me along this journey I’d greatly appreciate it.

1i3mhy8,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1i3mhy8/am_i_overreacting/,am i overreacting?,"I have an endless situation with a guy—we’ve liked each other since childhood (we’re 22 now). It has always been obvious that we liked each other; our friends always said it out loud. But we were kids, and everything was a bit confusing and experimental.

One day, after many years of waiting (he's a very reserved guy, not sure if it's shyness or because he likes to play hard to get), he tried to kiss me. But by then, I was tired of his attitude, so I pushed him away. After that, I forgot about him for three years—or so I thought. Apparently, he didn’t forget about me; quite the opposite.

I ran into him two years ago, and right away, I felt that connection again, so I started going to places where he was. His friends and people from our town told me he was crazy about me, and I could see it too. We would spend hours looking into each other's eyes, smiling non-stop, flirting, and asking each other all sorts of questions. Still, whenever I left the bar, he never texted me.

Eventually, I managed to kiss him, and he “confessed” everything to me, but we played a bit of cat and mouse. After that night, he didn’t say anything, so I went to his bar twice with a friend. I noticed he was jealous and immediately left. After that, I stopped going and focused on my own life. I even got back with my ex because I felt like this situation wasn’t going anywhere—it made me feel insecure that he never messaged me after promising he would come for me, that we’d go do things together, and after everything he said about how much he liked me.

When I ran into him again, he looked at me with this distant and resentful expression—it was strange. I sent him a couple of messages, but nothing came of it.

The following summer, he started asking my sister about me again, very interested, trying to get information. So I went back to the bar, and he asked my sister if I had a boyfriend. I could feel his eyes on me the whole time. We planned to hang out with my sister, but at the last minute, he canceled—it hurt me a lot.

A week ago, I saw him again because, during Christmas, he kept insisting on asking my sister about me and making comments like, ""I'll only go if your sister is there."" When I got to the party, he disappeared—I think he had another party, but apparently, he just went to eat at his grandma’s house. I was talking to his friends, and we even called him (considering that since the day we kissed, I haven’t spoken more than one sentence to him, calling him was a big deal).

Two hours later, he finally showed up. I overheard his friend saying, ""Everyone’s gone, except the one you want,"" which gave me hope, haha. When he arrived, he was smiling, and I pulled him aside—we talked intensely for a long time, with everyone at the bar watching us. But we could only look at each other, like magnets. He even said things like, ""If you and I were a couple..."" as if to see my reaction. He caressed my face and that kind of thing.

Since the bar was closing, I suggested going somewhere else for a drink, but he said he was going home because he wasn’t feeling well (which was true). But I didn’t understand—his friends had told me I was like an obsession for him, that they were tired of hearing about me, that he wasn’t seeing anyone else, that he only acted this way with me—so why wasn’t he taking the opportunity?

Why, when I asked him to take me home and he realized it was a bit far, did he say no? Then he said he would call me for coffee, that he liked seeing me ""every now and then"" because that way, he would be excited to see me (this really confuses me—like, don’t you want to see me all the time like I want to see you?). Of course, he hasn’t said anything, as usual.

I know he has struggled with social anxiety in the past and doesn’t usually date girls, but I still don’t understand. There are thousands of little details I haven’t even mentioned—like him showing up drunk and shouting my name, or admitting that when I came with the Italian guy, he was super, super, super jealous while staring into my eyes like he was devouring me, or his friends always laughing whenever I arrived or this last time, Or this last time, when we said goodbye, they kissed me on the corner of my lips....

All of this makes me think he really likes me, but then…? He does nothing. What do you think? I'm starting to believe he only likes the fantasy.I am the one who shows up where they are, and at least I have sent some messages.",0,1737136937.0,AmIOverreacting,1,0.5,False

I am a homebody and I'm in bed by 9 most nights. I love being outdoors year round even when it's cold but cold is unpleasant-- heat kills. I have a very fluffy dog who doesn't like heat. I hate driving and live in an urban neighborhood n a big city, so I can walk or ride my bike everywhere. My kids go to public school here because they're is no quality difference between any of our schools- they're all great. So I'm totally at sea trying to find them a school. I hate the suburbs, chain stores and chain coffee shops and choose to live in an artsy neighborhood with mostly independent businesses. All of this makes me worry that I'll have a hard time finding a place that feels like ""home"" and have a hard time connecting with people. I asked in the other Vegas sub and they recommended I check out Summerlin, and it looks like the kind of bland suburb I currently try to avoid.

I'm trying to be a ""when in Rome"" person, and I'm open to trying new things but given my current lifestyle, what would you recommend re: places to live, things to do, etc. ",0,1737136458.0,vegaslocals,14,0.22,False

I'm going to Sandals Montego Bay for a destination wedding this year. I (33NB) and my girlfriend (35F) have never been to Jamaica before so I started to scroll through the reddit forums. I have little choice on my location because I'm heading down for a wedding, but trying to get an understanding of some things. We booked via a travel agent my family is working with so of course part of her job is also to really sell the experience. 

1) I'm reading some mixed experiences by queer folks about their time on the resort, but those appear to be mostly from MLM relationships and not WLW. Would love to hear from WLW what their experience was. I identify as non-binary but when strangers look at us they see a WLW couple. 

2) I see a few posts talking about the coffee and the lack of coffee options. Does anyone know the options at Montego Bay? Will I be lurking at the lobby every morning?

3) This does tie into coffee! My partner is vegan - are there any non dairy options for the coffee or should we try packing some non-dairy powders from home? I was assured by the travel agent/wedding planner that the restaurants could accommodate a vegan meal but obviously she wanted us to book. My partner is comfortable eating salads our entire trip but would love to hear from people who might have a similar diet. Were restaurants accommodating? Did you end up with cheese in your meal even though you tried to explain no dairy, no meat, no eggs?

1i3m7dm,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1i3m7dm/cat_aggression_towards_new_people_what_might_work/,Cat Aggression Towards New People: What Might Work?,"I just would like to know what has actually worked for people as I go into my vet appointment next week. Here is the background:

4 abandoned kittens were found at my workplace about 5 years ago (Nov 2019) and I volunteered to care for them. I had 2 of the kittens adopted out and kept 2 of them. For the first 2-ish years, both cats were equally friendly around people and well socialized. As they both got a bit older, one started to show more and more aggressive behavior towards guests. He has always been fine with my boyfriend (who now lives with me and is no longer one of the guests) as well as my closest friend (who he doesnt love as much as my boyfriend but will tolerate her and not get too aggressive). But now when anyone else enters the house he HOWLS, hisses, swipes, etc. We've never really let it get beyond that so no one has sustained more than a little scratch but I think that is only because of our vigilance and not because he wouldnt actually attack.

About a year ago we took him to a vet close to our house, and it was clear from the get go that this vet was much more comfortable with dogs. He came in very loud and boisterous, scaring even my other extremely friendly cat. He didn't give either cat a physical exam because they were too stressed. He just pinned them down for long enough to give them shots and sent us home with gabapentin and prozac for the aggressive cat.

Neither the gabapentin nor the prozac had virtually any effect on my aggressive cat, and both were quite stressful to administer. The gabapentin had literally zero effect on my cats temperament or energy levels whatsoever, and the prozac, taken for 1 month, only had the effect of making him LESS affectionate towards us, but no less aggressive towards guests. As a result we decided to stop the prozac and have not been administering gabapentin when guests come over. We would just put him up in our room when people come over with everything he needs and then let him out when they leave, and overall didnt have issues.

Flash forward to today, I had a friend staying with me for one night. I put him in my bedroom this morning around the time she was heading out, and she had placed her suitcase in our front room while she was out getting coffee. She came back to get her stuff and left with all her belongings and I let my cat out. Despite my friend and all her belongings being out of the house, he SPRAYED on my curtains, which were close to the area where her suitcase had previously been placed. He has never ever gone to the bathroom outside of the litter box before so I am highly concerned. I have an appointment next week for an all cat veterinary practice. I am hoping they are able to be more helpful than my last vet.

But if you've read this far, I'd love to know if any of you have experienced this type of aggression towards new people specifically (he is not aggressive towards the other cat, myself or my boyfriend) and whether you were able to fix it! Thanks!

1i3m6bp,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1i3m6bp/advice_for_approaching_women_what_actually_works/,Advice for Approaching Women: What Actually Works - Say Anything!,"I (26M) see a lot of posts from people confused about how to approach women or unsure of what to say. Some suggest simply walking up to a woman, telling her she’s beautiful, and asking for her number. While this method isn’t necessarily wrong, it’s a HUGE ask for someone not used to being upfront, and it’s not always the most effective approach.

In today’s world, dating apps dominate, and in-person approaches have become a novelty—which can actually work to your advantage if done right. As someone who has learned through trial and error, here’s what I’ve found to work well. Plus, the women in my life agree that this method is respectful and approachable.

**The Key: Say Something—Anything**

If you see someone you find attractive or think is your type, just start a conversation. It doesn’t need to be perfect or rehearsed—just genuine. **Pick-up lines don’t work.** They often come across as cheesy or insincere. Instead, focus on being authentic and starting a real conversation.

If by the end of that conversation you feel there’s potential, *then* ask for their number. Here’s the difference between this approach and immediately asking for their number: Starting with a conversation shows genuine interest and gives you a chance to see if they’re interested too. It’s much easier (and less awkward) than opening with, “Hey, you’re super pretty—can I get your number?”

**Examples of Openers That Worked for Me**

Here are real-life examples of how I’ve started conversations, gotten to know someone, and later asked for their number:

	•	**Dog park**: “What breed is your dog?”

	•	**On the train**: “That’s a cool backpack—where did you get it?”

	•	**Coffee shop**: “Sweet shoes! Do you think I could pull these off?”

	•	**Trader Joe’s (in the jam aisle)**: “Any jam here you’d recommend?”

	•	**On a plane**: “Oh, are you from St. Louis (our destination)?”

	•	**Trivia night at a bar**: “These questions are killing me. How’s your team doing?”

	•	**At a bar with friends**: “Hey, do you know what time this place closes? Or if there are any other cool bars nearby?”(For context: I’m maybe slightly above-average looking, but not someone women typically fawn over.)

The point is to just start talking. Nothing is flashy, just genuine sincere conversation. Saying *something* is far better than staying silent.

**Gauge Their Interest**

Once the conversation starts, pay attention to their body language and responses:

	•	Are they maintaining eye contact or smiling?

	•	Do they sound engaged or enthusiastic?

	•	Most importantly: Are they keeping the conversation going or asking questions back?

Follow up naturally. For example, if you ask about good food in the area, you can ask if they live nearby, which naturally leads to more conversation.

**Start Small and Redefine Success**

Set a reasonable goal: Just start a conversation with someone you find attractive. That’s it! You don’t have to immediately ask for their number. The real victory is in taking the initiative and doing something hard—starting a conversation.

Here’s an important mindset shift: **No salesperson closes 100% of the time.** Rejection is part of the game in life. As much as it sucks, getting better at handling it makes you stronger. Every rejection teaches a lesson, helping you improve for next time.

Don’t define success as “getting their number.” Instead, define it as having the courage to put yourself out there. The more you practice, the easier it becomes to start these conversations and eventually ask people out.

**Rejection Isn’t a Failure**

If the conversation goes well but they’re not interested or decline to share their number, don’t feel dejected. Look at it this way:

	1.	You did something difficult, and that’s a win.

	2.	If done respectfully, most women see this as a compliment.

	3.	You’re building confidence and experience for future interactions.

In my experience, I’d much rather ask for a number and be rejected than never ask at all. Putting yourself out there means you won’t be left wondering “What if?” You’ll know where you stand and can move on confidently.

Dating and meeting people isn’t easy, but it’s not impossible. Start with small steps, focus on genuine interactions, and celebrate the effort you’re putting in. I hope this advice helps, and I’m happy to answer any questions you might have.",1,1737136135.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

I need advice please,"**Here is my advice, story, and how I quit. I hope this can help anyone aspiring to drop weed or cut back. The consequences I face from THC abuse are due to my decision to consume, not the substance itself. I am 1 month clean, still recovering, and committed to this lifelong journey. I would greatly appreciate input on my situation.**

# ADVICE

**Withdrawal plays a big role in the cycle of addiction.** Consuming weed to avoid withdrawal becomes a learned coping mechanism with an instant reward. However, the only way to remove the temptation is to wait it out. Make this your main mission, but don't fall victim to it. The sickness is self-induced. For me, it was a process of taking accountability and accepting how I made myself feel.

**Work on spirituality/religion**: Study beliefs and gain confidence and clarity in your life view.

**Extrinsic vs. Intrinsic motivation**: Become less motivated by material things and more capable of mentally rewarding yourself. Be your own cheerleader and envision your dream life.

**Attach a mental image/person to the craving**: Imagine a scene, object, or person that deters or repulses you from the habit whenever the pressure to relapse is strong.

**Drink coffee**: It stimulates the mind and dopamine receptors.

**Reward yourself for resisting cravings**: It's an achievement to tell yourself ""no"" 5-6 times a day, maybe more. Don't lose confidence because the craving exists, or you are tempted to relapse. Eventually, cravings will dissipate and can choose to not be that type of person anymore. 

**Don't count the days**: For the first hump, it's reasonable to be hyper-focused on time, but after about a week, replace any weed thoughts with habits that are fulfilling to you. 

**Eat healthily and exercise**: Eat organic foods, drink plenty of water, and sweat daily. It will detox faster, provide a healthy outlet for stress, and naturally make you feel good.

**""Escape catches up with you.""**

**""Inner world shapes outer world""**

**Question - Have you ignored the drawbacks? - Allowing the habit to run unconsciously is enabling.** 

# HOW THE DEPENDENCE STARTED - PERSONAL STORY:

The first time I smoked weed was when I was 16 on New Year's Eve, during my junior year of high school. I had heard a lot about it and was curious to try it. I did not know the consequences of experiencing that feeling and the lesson of self-control soon to come. After buying a THC cart for myself, I quickly became attached to the numbness it gave me. I only liked being around people I could get high with. 

For the next 3 years (now 19 and in my second year out of high school), I prioritized getting high on THC carts. I talked many people about quitting but failed in these attempts, losing trust. The longest I went sober was two weeks on vacation, and I relapsed the night I got back. I felt pathetic and lost my self-esteem.

In the 3rd year, getting high all day started to drive me into psychosis, and it was hard to accept this. I still have lost memories that friends tell me about. I experienced horrible memory loss, delusions, started hearing sounds, developed paranoia, and insecurities that led to narcissistic thinking. It was very painful seeing how I hurt my family and them expecting my behavior. My long-term goals died, and I believed that I needed the drug to live life normally. I smoked to get high, with a super high tolerance, but also to avoid feeling like shit from withdrawal and poor self-care.

I went to the gym most days during this cycle, which I believe may have been the one thing keeping me together. However, I would aspire to eat clean and give in to sugary processed foods most days, not put full effort into workouts, and become comfortable just being super high in public. These habits worsened my relationship with myself. I was not getting nearly enough REM sleep.

I can go on and on about the drawbacks, but I knew what they were and continued anyway. I know some people can manage to smoke and not let it become obsessive like I did, and by all means, go ahead. I'm not going to smoke again because I know how quickly I can lose trust in myself, an unworthy risk.

I would not recommend cannabis because it changes brain chemistry and your thought process. For example, it takes a few days to recover from just one high, and it lessens the effectiveness of the prefrontal cortex, responsible for decision-making. I argue it is a mental setback and prolongs reaching any goal besides getting high. Please leave opinions in the comments.

Random thought - The term ""alcoholic"" is commonly used, but there is no name for a person with cannabis use disorder. Terms like ""stoner"" and ""rasta"" influence the habit.

# SITUATION I STOPPED IN:

Doing the following helped me create a life I did not want to escape from, which then tempted me to quit.

1. **Got into a relationship (Katie)**: It had its great moments like skiing and camping, but she would be rude sometimes. I believed it was rightfully so because I wasn't worthy of respect due to my abusive habits (hitting the cart 5-6 sessions daily). I was hiding it from her and not being honest because it was unattractive. I knew I could be a better person.
2. **Began day trading and saving money**: I was nearly broke, having spent over $5,000 on weed at this point. I started making decent money from day trades, but I knew if I quit, I could do better. I refined my mindset soon after. Limited impulsive spending.
3. **Full-effort workouts + progress.** Started eating strictly, and taking MK-677, a recovery catalyst/growth hormone synagogue.
4. **Discontinued college**: I was attending as a coping mechanism because I didn't have a plan, and it made me depressed. I am currently avoiding resolution with my parents. I live with them, and their requirement for me to stay in the house is getting a degree and doing my part with cleaning/chores. I don't find getting a degree necessary for success and am happy with my lifestyle. They say I'm being stupid and that I don't have a choice. I'm raising funds to move out, but for the time being, I will be dishonest and could use advice. I'm studying day trading daily and applying for jobs at the places I pick up orders from DoorDash. Time was running out for me, and reaching the end of college with nothing was not an option. I couldn't accept that fate.

# HERE'S WHEN I STOPPED:

One morning, I woke up, smoked, and lost money on stocks. I realized that building my future and reaching my vision gave me more clarity and peace than smoking. I took out my phone and recorded myself destroying my THC cart. I said, ""This is getting in the way of my goals,"" and ripped the wires, then soaked all the wax in hand sanitizer. Looking back at the video, I could see the temptation and pain in my eyes. After destroying it on film, I went quiet, thinking, and then said, ""This is good?""

Looking back, hell yeah, it was good, no doubt. So much has changed, and I'm in touch with myself. I have genuine connections again, playing drums is meaningful, and my confidence is back.

The first day clean, Katie called me ready to break up. She was mad I was avoiding her, and I explained that I was going psychotic and contact on day one would hurt the relationship. I asked her for a chance to do it sober and told her I was lying about how much I used, and she accepted. That night, I did not sleep, fully expecting it, so I binge-watched stock videos and drank coffee. Over the next few days, Katie gave support and we spent a lot of time together, and I slowly came to my senses. I started playing drums more. After a week, I got into an argument with Katie because she did not want to support my stock venture and was rude when I brought it up. She did not like the instability and believed I would lose all my money. We broke up. It's okay that she was looking for something else. I felt way better and realized it was a bad fit for me anyway. By this time, I had spoken to many friends that I had fallen out with because of this fog and my change in priorities. I am grateful for their support to this day. I also started vaping and traded addictions. That is my story so far, and I would appreciate any advice. I hope this helps anyone seeking help or a story to relate to.

Furby Barbie sat in a booth, her pink nails with tiger stripes tapping on the table. She was scrolling through her phone.. Super Lemon slid into the seat across from her, he plopped his narwhal plushie on the table.  It was his little support plushie pet that helped him with his anxiety. 

“You’re late,” Furby said, not looking up, her fake eyelashes still glued down looking at her phone.

“Foot traffic,” Super Lemon replied, shrugging. “You know how it is when class lets out around here.”

Furby sighed. She realized it probably was harder for a little person to make it across campus.  She eased up on him.  “We’ve got rehearsals in an hour. You could’ve at least texted. Id' have brought the scooter over to get you,  you know?”

Super Lemon rolled his eyes. “Relax. It’s not like we’re opening tomorrow. And it's not like my part is so hard.""

The tension between them had been building for weeks. Furby Barbie was the star of the local theatre’s production of *Wicked*.  Everyone was super excited to have a trans person play the role of Elphaba. Super Lemon had been cast as a munchkin, a role he took seriously. But Furby thought he wasn’t taking *her* seriously.

“You’re always so casual about everything,” Furby Barbie snapped. “This isn’t just some drag show. It’s *Wicked*. It’s Broadway-level stuff.”  What she meant to say but couldn't quite bring it to her lips was that she wanted him to take more interest in HER.  

Super Lemon put his spoon down. “And you’re always so dramatic. It’s community theatre, Barbie. Not the Met.”  He threw the wet spoon at Furby Barbie.

Furby’s eyes narrowed. “You think I don’t know that? I’m trying to make this the best it can be. You’re just here for the free snacks.”  And she said that throwing open the package of little oyster crackers and throwing it at him.

Super Lemon stood up, his chair scraping against the floor. “You know what? I don’t need this. You have no clue how to treat a human with dignity!”  He was thinking about how she didn't even remember to invite him to the cast party on her birthday.  But he wasn't knowing how she really just wasn't sure she wanted him to see the poor part of town, in the basement of a rundown church.  He was from money, from California, from a family of small people in Hollywood, used to living what she thought was the good life.

Furby stood too, her heels clicking on the ground in just that way they did when she was on stage as Elphaba. “Oh, you’re leaving? Again? Typical.”

Clicked in his ears because he was tasked with being the munchkin beside her and her heel stomping was triggering his anxiety issues.

The argument escalated. Words turned into shoves. A milkshake got knocked over. Strawberry syrup splattered everywhere.

And then… Furby Barbie had Super Lemon on the floor.  The whole diner in Madison Wisconson was gasping to see a woman attacking a little person.  They gasped in horror.  Not sure who to help first?  The lady or the man?   

And while they dalianced through their brains with their mouths wide open. 

Furby grabbed Super Lemon’s hair and grabbed the glass before it completely leaked and and poured it all over Super Lemon. He yelped and pulled her glasses off her face. The diner’s patrons watched, some laughing, others filming on their phones. A waitress tried to break it up, but she slipped on the spilled milkshake.

Finally, they both stopped, breathing heavily. Furby’s wig was crooked. Super Lemon’s shirt was stained with strawberry's from Furby Barbie's milkshake. They looked at each other and burst out laughing.

“You’re a mess,” Furby said, wiping syrup off his face.

“So are you,” Super Lemon replied, adjusting his bow tie.

Then they turned to each other and said it, ""God I love you!""

And it was inevitable that it would come out messy like this and they knew it from the start.  Furby straighted her back and went to stand up.  Holding her hand out to Super Lemon. to help him up ""We should probably get to rehearsals,” Furby said squeezing his hand a little extra tight to let him know they are in this world together

Super Lemon nodded. “Yeah. But first, let’s grab some coffee. I think we need it.”

At the theatre, the cast was already warming up. The director raised an eyebrow when they walked in, but didn’t say anything.

Furby and Super Lemon took their places. The music started. They sang. They danced. And for a moment, everything was perfect.  Nobody carried about the mess they made.  Everyone was just so pleased that the tension between them had been resolved. ",1,1737135895.0,story,0,1.0,False

I enjoy a cup of drip coffee and steamed oat milk that is more coffee than milk - ratio about 3:1. 

I typically place my order as follows “cafe misto, with steamed oat milk, I want more coffee than milk, about 75% coffee” 

The results are different each time. Sometimes it’s a drip with a splash of cold oat milk. Sometimes it’s still a misto that is 50:50 coffee and milk.  

How can I adjust what I say to get what I’m looking for? Part of the disconnect is in the olden days the cashier would get the appropriate amount of  drip and then place it over in the line up for the baristas. Now they type in the system and so there is a disconnect between what I tell the cashier and what I get. There must be a term I can use to get the desired results? Please let me know.

I forgot about it, but then I recently found it in my cabinet and decided to finish it before the expiration date. Something I did \*not\* expect, however, was how much it helped my anxiety and OCD. I quickly bought another bottle of it.

The problem (and correlation does not equal causation) is that I have recently been experiencing memory issues. I feel as if I am having lapses in my memory, thinking I did something when I didn't (like locking a door), and having trouble with word recall.

This is troubling, but I am not yet even forty, so I wouldn't consider it age-related.

Has anyone else experienced this when taking CoQ10? When I searched, it seemed beneficial for memory (except for one study involving mice). I am going to stop for a bit and see if it improves. The only other thing I have changed is that I've been having some caffeinated coffee again after quitting for a while.

I wish things were different. My mil makes me feel guilty if we don't see her , it's been apparent recently too that my in-laws just don't like me. 
I was recently diagnosed with an autoimmune disorder. 
My mil has dismissed my illness several times until last month I fainted and had to demand more tests. She's shown some sympathy since. However keeps asking if I'm pregnant etc and I hope we can give her more grandchildren. Just no. We are not ready for kids..and if it happens well it's our choice. Not here's . 
My further gripes:

She never ever contacts me or checks in with me. But expects me to make time for her.
I have made time for her, going to her house with her son for tea after work as she just loves us being there for dinner is making time for her. And that's the only time she wants from me or baby sitting her daughter's kids, which I haven't been able to do for the past few months as I've been unwell. Her son, my fiance , doesn't want to and can't because of his shifts. When he was backed into a corner about it he got very angry about it and said he won't be doing it. 
This woman has never made any tangible effort to include me ( it him) in family functions such as throwing a baby shower , or planning things , or even planning us to be involved with dates for family days out, just an evening out or drinks, But expects me to tidy up the aftermath of such events which I've always obliged. 
I've walked her dogs, I've offered to assist her with things when she was poorly. 
I cannot and will not make her son see her more. He cannot stand his own mother. He feels the same..never heard off her except for text messages or phone calls saying I've forgotten what you look like it's been ages since I've seen you I miss you etc. it bugs him, and if he can't commit to something the guilt trips come on. and recently it's starting to bug me too. We arent valued or made a fuss of like his sister and her partner are ( this was obvious years before they had a kid).

I'm done feeling guilty. And I'm done feeling like I should visit her. I'm.
done feeling like I should help out with cleaning or doing stuff. 
I've obviously lost my value since I've been ill. 
I called my mil tonight just to keep in touch , I was going to see if she was in and nip on for a coffee but sil answered, what do you want my mother for anything in particular? 
No I said , thanks I'll call back another time. 

There is absolutely no love care or anything for me from them. 
I'm hurt. And I'm done with trying to savage some sort of normal relationship. 

I cannot wait to move to anotjer city with my fiance. 
He was over it a long time ago. 
He would quite happily never speak to her again.

1i3lvm2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AcademicPsychology/comments/1i3lvm2/ocd_is_complex_and_the_specific_presentation/,OCD is complex and the specific presentation needs to be accounted for,"The typical thinking appears to be that people get obsessions, and then directly follow it up with a compulsion. But I have my doubts about this. My guess is that while this could be a pattern for many people with OCD, it is nowhere near 100%.

Yet in addition to the above scenario, compulsions can also happen in this manner:

\- in response to obsessions, but not directly after. For example, someone may have obsessions about their door being unlocked, but they may not check the door each time this obsession pops into their mind, rather, they may just check the door a lot at random times of the day, and a bunch of times at night before bed, but it doesn't necessarily mean that right before bed they get bombarded with those obsessions, it could not even be on their mind at that moment but they still do that checking compulsion.

\- in response not to obsessions, but anxiety in general. On bad days/weeks in terms of relatively heightened anxiety, the frequency of compulsions could be higher: again, this shows that the compulsion does not necessarily immediately/directly follow the obsession, and in this case it could not just be an obsession but overall high levels of anxiety, or one could have obsessions too but during during days/weeks of heightened overall anxiety/stress, there could be more compulsions as well. This is likely especially true for certain types of compulsions related to order. Think about it logically: intolerance of uncertainty is a construct highly correlated at roughly the same level with both OCD and GAD (generalized anxiety disorder), and if someone does a compulsion that is related to order/counting, it is basically a logical counteracting of intolerance of uncertainty: if you are uncomfortable about not knowing how things will plan out/what will happen, and you find yourself doing increased compulsions in which you are counting stuff or measuring stuff or ordering stuff, don't those logically provide you with some sort of temporary certainty: when you count something, you are certain how many there are: certainty is the opposite of uncertainty. So wouldn't it make sense that someone with intolerance of uncertainty would try to create certainty like this? So again, this goes against the typical thinking that compulsions are necessarily a response to ""obsessions"", or a ""direct/immediate"" response to obsessions

\- compulsions not in response to individual instances of ""obsessions"", rather, mental ""overload"" that can result from a high level of obsessions in general... for example, if you have the thought that not putting your coffee mug on the corner of the desk may result in a loved one dying, you may cognitively 100% realize that this is nonsense and that there is zero correlation between these 2 things, but just that thought entering your mind all the time will eat up your cognitive resources/energy, so you experience mental overload, and don't have the energy to actively remind yourself that that obsession is not real, so you learn to over time automatically give in to the compulsion and just do it anyways to avoid having to spend time/energy to disprove the obsession. So this can practically lead to doing compulsions over and over again every time you drink from your coffee mug, even though you don't consciously get that obsession each time.

I think these are important to know for the sake of treatment because I think unfortunately one too many clinicians are not aware of the above and instead mechanistically abide by the DSM and are focused on treating the ""obsessions+compulsions"" the same way for everyone. This logically shows that research that is diagnosis-focused can be flawed. So why is it still the norm? It is said that we need to be empirical, but I think there needs to be a shift from diagnosis to symptom-presentation types. It will never be 100% easily defined but I think it will lead to practically superior research. One way is shifting from diagnosis to constructs or a hybrid (e.g., OCD-interolerance of uncertainty type; GAD- intolerance of uncertainty type, rather than ""OCD"" vs ""GAD"").

Growing up in the 80s, I played a lot of Risk, Battleship, Stratego, Sorry, and Monopoly with neighborhood friends. Mouse Trap rarely worked, but we tried!

My younger years were filled with Candy Land, Hungry Hippos, and Connect Four. I loved Trouble, Clue, and Life, but I didn’t own them—I had to play at friends’ houses.

Now, my favorite games include Carcassonne, Catan, Ticket to Ride, Hive, Takenoko, Pandemic, Splendor, 7 Wonders, Dominion, Sagrada, King of Tokyo, and Lanterns. I’ve even got a soft spot for obscure gems like Castle Panic and Between Two Cities.

I also love D&D and have played since 6th grade (2nd Edition!). I devoured the books, created my own dungeons, and now play in two groups—one online and one at Untapped Games.

For me, it’s all about the mechanics. I’ve bought games just for their mechanics—tile placement, dice rolling, exploring, shifting boards. But simplicity is key—mechanics should feel seamless and intuitive.

The photo? That’s an old version of Jafabit on my coffee table. It’s fun to see how far we’ve come!

It has always been obvious that we liked each other; our friends always said it out loud. But we were kids, and everything was a bit confusing and experimental.

One day, after many years of waiting (he's a very reserved guy, not sure if it's shyness or because he likes to play hard to get), he tried to kiss me. But by then, I was tired of his attitude, so I pushed him away. After that, I forgot about him for three years—or so I thought. Apparently, he didn’t forget about me; quite the opposite.

I ran into him two years ago, and right away, I felt that connection again, so I started going to places where he was. His friends and people from our town told me he was crazy about me, and I could see it too. We would spend hours looking into each other's eyes, smiling non-stop, flirting, and asking each other all sorts of questions. Still, whenever I left the bar, he never texted me.

Eventually, I managed to kiss him, and he “confessed” everything to me, but we played a bit of cat and mouse. After that night, he didn’t say anything, so I went to his bar twice with a friend. I noticed he was jealous and immediately left. After that, I stopped going and focused on my own life. I even got back with my ex because I felt like this situation wasn’t going anywhere—it made me feel insecure that he never messaged me after promising he would come for me, that we’d go do things together, and after everything he said about how much he liked me.

When I ran into him again, he looked at me with this distant and resentful expression—it was strange. I sent him a couple of messages, but nothing came of it.

The following summer, he started asking my sister about me again, very interested, trying to get information. So I went back to the bar, and he asked my sister if I had a boyfriend. I could feel his eyes on me the whole time. We planned to hang out with my sister, but at the last minute, he canceled—it hurt me a lot.

A week ago, I saw him again because, during Christmas, he kept insisting on asking my sister about me and making comments like, ""I'll only go if your sister is there."" When I got to the party, he disappeared—I think he had another party, but apparently, he just went to eat at his grandma’s house. I was talking to his friends, and we even called him (considering that since the day we kissed, I haven’t spoken more than one sentence to him, calling him was a big deal).

Two hours later, he finally showed up. I overheard his friend saying, ""Everyone’s gone, except the one you want,"" which gave me hope, haha. When he arrived, he was smiling, and I pulled him aside—we talked intensely for a long time, with everyone at the bar watching us. But we could only look at each other, like magnets. He even said things like, ""If you and I were a couple..."" as if to see my reaction. He caressed my face and that kind of thing.

Since the bar was closing, I suggested going somewhere else for a drink, but he said he was going home because he wasn’t feeling well (which was true). But I didn’t understand—his friends had told me I was like an obsession for him, that they were tired of hearing about me, that he wasn’t seeing anyone else, that he only acted this way with me—so why wasn’t he taking the opportunity?

Why, when I asked him to take me home and he realized it was a bit far, did he say no? Then he said he would call me for coffee, that he liked seeing me ""every now and then"" because that way, he would be excited to see me (this really confuses me—like, don’t you want to see me all the time like I want to see you?). Of course, he hasn’t said anything, as usual.

I know he has struggled with social anxiety in the past and doesn’t usually date girls, but I still don’t understand. There are thousands of little details I haven’t even mentioned—like him showing up drunk and shouting my name, or admitting that when I came with the Italian guy, he was super, super, super jealous while staring into my eyes like he was devouring me, or his friends always laughing whenever I arrived.

All of this makes me think he really likes me, but then…? He does nothing. What do you think? I'm starting to believe he only likes the fantasy.",0,1737135037.0,AskMenAdvice,8,0.5,False

Naturalist it's a page where normal people can be a scientist and make his own observations for biologists to study the distribution of animals.

My favorite bird it's the ""halcón reidor"" who translates to ""Laughing falcon"", his scientific name it's ""Herpetotheres Cachinnans"". It's my favorite because he does a strange and mysterious sound that remembers a movie of the wild west or something similar. I used to like cowboys when I was younger, most specifically his music and the ""Chuckwagon"" what it's something really cool. I'm a musician and the music of cowboys from Enno Morricone generally uses my favorite chord, I don't know how to say it but has D, F, A, C all naturals. It's my favorite chord but hasn't the last note, that would be E.

My favorite animal in the country it's the cougar. Cougars used to live here but with the deforstation they are rare now. In 2022 some people kill a cougar! and that's something ilegal I guess. I don't feel good with what's is happening with animals and forests in my country. The goverment wants to mine gold and that's the worst idea for the conservation of the nature, because that would contamine the rivers and lakes.

The important people that takes decisions about the country really never care about the conservation, we have lost 85% of forest since 1960. Only 27% of the country is forested and of that 27%, 9% are coffee plantations and only 13% are real forests. It's sad to see some the mountains with a few trees when you're in the road to San Salvador, the capital.

I always though, what would happen with the animals and forest in 50 years? some biologists and paleontologists say that we are in the 6th extintion, caused by humans. In the future the forests gonna be something of the past, and in 2200 or something like that the only forests gonna be artificial, or that's what I think.

1i3llw6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1i3llw6/what_would_you_do/,what would you do?,"I have an endless situation with a guy—we’ve liked each other since childhood (we’re 22 now). It has always been obvious that we liked each other; our friends always said it out loud. But we were kids, and everything was a bit confusing and experimental.

One day, after many years of waiting (he's a very reserved guy, not sure if it's shyness or because he likes to play hard to get), he tried to kiss me. But by then, I was tired of his attitude, so I pushed him away. After that, I forgot about him for three years—or so I thought. Apparently, he didn’t forget about me; quite the opposite.

I ran into him two years ago, and right away, I felt that connection again, so I started going to places where he was. His friends and people from our town told me he was crazy about me, and I could see it too. We would spend hours looking into each other's eyes, smiling non-stop, flirting, and asking each other all sorts of questions. Still, whenever I left the bar, he never texted me.

Eventually, I managed to kiss him, and he “confessed” everything to me, but we played a bit of cat and mouse. After that night, he didn’t say anything, so I went to his bar twice with a friend. I noticed he was jealous and immediately left. After that, I stopped going and focused on my own life. I even got back with my ex because I felt like this situation wasn’t going anywhere—it made me feel insecure that he never messaged me after promising he would come for me, that we’d go do things together, and after everything he said about how much he liked me.

When I ran into him again, he looked at me with this distant and resentful expression—it was strange. I sent him a couple of messages, but nothing came of it.

The following summer, he started asking my sister about me again, very interested, trying to get information. So I went back to the bar, and he asked my sister if I had a boyfriend. I could feel his eyes on me the whole time. We planned to hang out with my sister, but at the last minute, he canceled—it hurt me a lot.

A week ago, I saw him again because, during Christmas, he kept insisting on asking my sister about me and making comments like, ""I'll only go if your sister is there."" When I got to the party, he disappeared—I think he had another party, but apparently, he just went to eat at his grandma’s house. I was talking to his friends, and we even called him (considering that since the day we kissed, I haven’t spoken more than one sentence to him, calling him was a big deal).

Two hours later, he finally showed up. I overheard his friend saying, ""Everyone’s gone, except the one you want,"" which gave me hope, haha. When he arrived, he was smiling, and I pulled him aside—we talked intensely for a long time, with everyone at the bar watching us. But we could only look at each other, like magnets. He even said things like, ""If you and I were a couple..."" as if to see my reaction. He caressed my face and that kind of thing.

Since the bar was closing, I suggested going somewhere else for a drink, but he said he was going home because he wasn’t feeling well (which was true). But I didn’t understand—his friends had told me I was like an obsession for him, that they were tired of hearing about me, that he wasn’t seeing anyone else, that he only acted this way with me—so why wasn’t he taking the opportunity?

Why, when I asked him to take me home and he realized it was a bit far, did he say no? Then he said he would call me for coffee, that he liked seeing me ""every now and then"" because that way, he would be excited to see me (this really confuses me—like, don’t you want to see me all the time like I want to see you?). Of course, he hasn’t said anything, as usual.

I know he has struggled with social anxiety in the past and doesn’t usually date girls, but I still don’t understand. There are thousands of little details I haven’t even mentioned—like him showing up drunk and shouting my name, or admitting that when I came with the Italian guy, he was super, super, super jealous while staring into my eyes like he was devouring me, or his friends always laughing whenever I arrived.

All of this makes me think he really likes me, but then…? He does nothing. What do you think? I'm starting to believe he only likes the fantasy.",1,1737134710.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

**Memory Transcription Subject: Maln, Systems Technician**  
*Date (Sol Standard Time): June 24th, 2140*

Lower deck engineering. My most familiar part of the ship; and arguably the safest.. The *Aureoleis* might be built for stealth but it’s still a ship of war, meaning its beating heart is to be kept safe at all times.

Sadly, that isn’t true. Oh, it’s well protected… But like a heart, anything that happens in the ship can be felt here. And so, it is not nearly as safe as I’d like it to be. Still all the more reason to keep it beating fast and strong.

In the thick of action here, we only get the relevant mission updates; no use spending time on needless information. Fights are quick endeavours, and right now all I knew is we were about to enter pursuit mode.

“Game faces, everyone,” Chief Engineer called from his station, “ETA \[10 minutes\] to first verse, start checks!”

“Aye, sir!” I call out together with the other six; engineering takes quite a few paws to run smoothly. My first task is checking the central mainframe. It’s not so much a mainframe as a figurative and literal pillar, the computational core of the *Aureoleis*. Most ships don’t have such massive centralized mainframes but the requirements of a stealth ship are different; in space half of stealth is electronic warfare.

All green across the tower of monitors, everything seemed to be doing fine… mostly. One monitor was making me feel odd about the readings, but they were still within the acceptable parameters; still, I knew better than to ignore my instincts. Something was off and I couldn’t tell what.

“Hey, Vee?” I’ve gotta learn the man’s full name at some point, “Check this, can you see anything wrong with it?”

The harchen plods over from Life Support, he’s hardly knowledgeable on electronic warfare, being a chemical engineer, but the prototype technology on the *Aureoleis* is… Finicky. Or rather, after working here for a while I realized some of the finest details are all but impossible for anyone other than a harchen to notice “Maln, you know I’m not an EW guy.”

“I know, just, give me a vibe check here.”

Vee looks at the frequency monitor. It’s not really a ‘frequency’, per se, but a pattern generator used to keep the systems synchronized and prevent noticeable patterns from emerging in what few emissions we couldn’t trap inside. “Huhn… Is… Is this harmonic here supposed to do that?” he says, pointing a toe at the visualization.

I blink blankly at it for a few seconds, “Brahk, you’re right! Not out of deviation, but definitely not supposed to be doing that, thanks man!” He just gives me a wave that I reciprocate.

Fixing it isn’t that difficult, this kind of pattern just means one of the emission traps needs its impedance adjusted, something easily done remotely with two button presses.

“And the lead calls!” The chief barks, “Everyone to stations!” there’s the sound of just a few scurrying paws as everyone returns to their stations from other checks, and I quickly return to mine. Primarily internal systems and electrics, but I still get access to the entire system from here.

There were still a few \[minutes\], of course, but the first readings I see changing came from the armory. Minor heat increase in the missile tubes, all within standard parameters, system confirming missile fire. Following that is the generator and engines spinning to full output, emission trap hitting capacity and disabling- We’ve gone loud.

There’s a terrible tension in the air, the worst part of being in engineering during a fight is that you *don’t* know what is happening to the battle, there just isn’t a reason to keep track of it, not when your job is to quickly react to any possible damage to the ship. I know we’re attacking but I’m not keeping track on a tactical plot, or anything!

*Brahk, Avital’s up there at the bridge… But if anyone can keep their head in this situation, it’s him.*

I watch quietly as the systems just… cool off. Radiators indicating no extra buildup, nothing special on my readouts… Had everything gone smoothly? Had we pulled off a perfect ambush? I wouldn’t know, not until the all-clear order came and I had time to check things outside of my duty.

A sudden spike in power draw from the engines is the only warning I get as a single thought crosses my mind: *Jinxed it.*

Suddenly I can feel gravity whipping me around just ever so slightly. “Engines on yellow, diverting unspent coolant from emission capture!” Vee’s voice echoes to my side.

“Shield emitters three and six down twenty percent!” I call out, “Capacitors?”

“Negative!” the Chief Engineer responds cleanly. There’s no time for explanation when you’re in the thick of it.

It wasn’t much longer than a few more heartbeats when warnings appeared on my station; along with everyone else’s. Very distinct short-range emission patterns… missile locks! “EM flash!”

“Negative effect!”

“Visual, visual!”

“Laser flash!”

“Brace!”

The entire ship shakes and shudders; thankfully, our seats are made to handle that sort of thing. I grip tightly to the station as the belts dig against my skin “Report!” comes the Chief’s voice.

“Penetration on racks six and seven, internal buffers contained the blast, no chain.” someone calls on my left

“Overvoltage on line seven-four!” I call out, this was part of my specialty. I quickly command the system to cut power to a small section of the ship, nothing vital and nothing that should be working after that hit. Except the voltage spike did more than just that, I can see the red light from here shining in the central pillar “Computing core three compromised, diverting vital processes to other cores and disabling. Door control system offline!”

At that, I hear the sound of paws hitting hard against the floor and see off to the side one of our officers dashing out the door, the poor soul will have the unenviable job of doing a physical sweep to ensure all the doors have switched to manual hydraulics. Unfortunately, out in cold space control of doors and, most importantly, blast doors and seals, is vital. They can’t be allowed to lock up if remote and automated systems fail, so they fail-safe into manual modes.

*But someone always has to check, and it’s up to the hydraulics guy.*

I remained stuck on my console, however, expecting… something? And yet, despite the damage report from the missile racks nothing new came up for a while, and soon enough the minor pull of momentum faded, the ship’s gravity control overtaking whatever acceleration were in at the moment indicating that- “And the coda! Engagement end!” calls the chief “All field repair crews, go! Officers, begin post-combat. We’ve still got sensor ghosts, remain on high alert levels!”

\-\*-

Though the alert level remained high, after several hours performing checks on the systems, it seemed we had escaped.

In fact at this point, it’d been nearly a day of heavy repair work. I had managed to skip on the spacewalk to fix the hull penetration, but the majority of the day had been spent on the armory. The missile rack had been totalled, and moving the missiles to a different one was an entire job.

“You think we’re safe yet?” asks Vee, both of us standing around one of the most vital niceties of the engineering section” the tea machine. Well, the tea machine for me; Vee had opted to use that… ‘vacuum cold brew coffee’ contraption instead. I couldn’t deny its effectiveness, which is the entire reason I avoided it.

“Don’t think so. Their stealth is on another level… I don’t think we can trust we’re out of their range until-”

And then there was red. Not every species reacts to the same colors the same way, of course. So in every ship the colors wind up meaning different things, red to me feels a little off and doesn’t really work… But I’ve been on enough interspecies crews to know better.

Harchen, mazic, yotul and human all had approximately the same color for emergency lights. Red.

I didn’t bother putting back my cup, letting it clatter to the floor as I dashed back to engineering. We were no more than \[15 meters\] away from it in the little break room, well within the response distance for high alert! Bursting through the door, I could hear the voices inside.

“Polarize the emission catchers!”

“Diverting power!”

“Cut fuel to section four!”

“Brace, brace, brace!”

I hadn’t made it to my station. I couldn’t do it in time, not before suddenly any notion of up, down, left and right was gone. Lights went dark, then flashed bright again and went dark a second time.

*Power surge?*

I was flung aside, and any hope of understanding what was happening was just *gone*. I could feel warmth in my lower body, an impact on my arm, my head- My breath leaves me for a moment and I find myself… At my station?

No- No this isn’t right, the angle is… Wrong? Dizzy… I’m dizzy… But-

Even upside-down I can still sort of make out the- What is this?

*Power spike on thrusters, generator is.. Functional? No! It’s haywire, can’t-*

My head… I slam my paw down on the console and pull myself closer, and something *hurts* badly in my lower body but what I see is too bad. All engines down, generator halfway to meltdown, I have to stop this… I start issuing commands but- It isn’t responding! The system isn’t responding! The control systems must have been busted-

1i3li1n,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/1i3li1n/whenwhyhow_often_do_you_do_compulsions/,When/why/how often do you do compulsions?,"The typical thinking is that people get obsessions, and then directly follow it up with a compulsion. But I have my doubts about this. My guess is that while this could be a pattern for many people with OCD, it is nowhere near 100%.

My hypothesis is that in addition to the above scenario, compulsions can also happen in this manner:

\- in response to obsessions, but not directly after. For example, someone may have obsessions about their door being unlocked, but they may not check the door each time this obsession pops into their mind, rather, they may just check the door a lot at random times of the day, and a bunch of times at night before bed, but it doesn't necessarily mean that right before bed they get bombarded with those obsessions, it could not even be on their mind at that moment but they still do that checking compulsion.

\- in response not to obsessions, but anxiety in general. On bad days/weeks in terms of relatively heightened anxiety, the frequency of compulsions could be higher: again, this shows that the compulsion does not necessarily immediately/directly follow the obsession, and in this case it could not just be an obsession but overall high levels of anxiety, or one could have obsessions too but during during days/weeks of heightened overall anxiety/stress, there could be more compulsions as well. This is likely especially true for certain types of compulsions related to order. Think about it logically: intolerance of uncertainty is a construct highly correlated at roughly the same level with both OCD and GAD (generalized anxiety disorder), and if someone does a compulsion that is related to order/counting, it is basically a logical counteracting of intolerance of uncertainty: if you are uncomfortable about not knowing how things will plan out/what will happen, and you find yourself doing increased compulsions in which you are counting stuff or measuring stuff or ordering stuff, don't those logically provide you with some sort of temporary certainty: when you count something, you are certain how many there are: certainty is the opposite of uncertainty. So wouldn't it make sense that someone with intolerance of uncertainty would try to create certainty like this? So again, this goes against the typical thinking that compulsions are necessarily a response to ""obsessions"", or a ""direct/immediate"" response to obsessions

\- compulsions not in response to individual instances of ""obsessions"", rather, mental ""overload"" that can result from a high level of obsessions in general... for example, if you have the thought that not putting your coffee mug on the corner of the desk may result in a loved one dying, you may cognitively 100% realize that this is nonsense and that there is zero correlation between these 2 things, but just that thought entering your mind all the time will eat up your cognitive resources/energy, so you experience mental overload, and don't have the energy to actively remind yourself that that obsession is not real, so you learn to over time automatically give in to the compulsion and just do it anyways to avoid having to spend time/energy to disprove the obsession. So this can practically lead to doing compulsions over and over again every time you drink from your coffee mug, even though you don't consciously get that obsession each time.

Does anyone here experience compulsions in the manners described above?

I think these are important to know for the sake of treatment because I think unfortunately one too many clinicians are not aware of the above and instead mechanistically abide by the DSM and are focused on treating the ""obsessions+compulsions"" the same way for everyone.

He was always with me, following me around the house, so his loss has been deeply felt. Yesterday, we had some renovations done on our house, and it was a stressful day. Later in the night, I was laying on the couch watching TV with my husband like I usually do before bed. Suddenly, I saw what looked like a shadowy cat tail flicking around in the hallway across from me, accompanied by a bit of movement that looked like a cat quickly walking. A second later, the commercial that always reminds me of my cat came on. The timing was eerie, but at the time I wrote it off as a hallucination or something.

This morning, I'm drinking coffee with my husband before he leaves for work, and I tell him that I saw what kind of looked like a cat last night. He shot up in his seat and asked if it was in the hallway with a dark flicking tail while we watched TV. I was pretty shocked since I thought I was the only one who saw it. It's still hard to say exactly what it was, but the fact that both of us apparently saw it tells me something of some sort was there. Whether it was my cat or not, obviously I can't confirm it. But both of our brains interpreted it as a cat. I like to think that it was him. <3",5,1737134425.0,Paranormal,2,1.0,False

Dear \[Agent\],



I am seeking representation for my debut novel, THE SUNSETS WITH YOU, a contemporary romance complete at 86,000 words. It will appeal to readers who loved the Hollywood dynamic of When In Rome by Sarah Adams and lake town vibes of Meet Me At the Lake By Carley Fortune.



When it comes to taking risks, you’ll find Lena Oakley safely tucked away in her picturesque small town in Maine with her two best friends. Lena has spent years creating a perfect bubble free of tumultuous relationships, and anything anxiety inducing. But with a job she hates, no love life to speak of, and abandonment issues thanks to her mom, she is struggling to find her footing in adult life – unwilling to change a thing, until she finds a for sale sign at her beloved childhood lake house and an acceptance into NYU PR program. 



Lena is faced with staying in her familiar territory Greenwater where the coffee shop knows her order, friends are family, and where the sound of crashing waves is the background music. She has to decide if her status quo is actually fulfilling, simply familiar, or if leaving to chase her dreams of working behind the scenes on Broadway is worth the anxiety that comes with change. Sitting in a dark corner of her favorite bar, Lena catches her celebrity crush’s gaze. Stunned, she starts making a plan about how to approach him, until he abruptly walks out, rudely calling her out for staring.



Callum Hayes, is popping up everywhere, even at work-where she is now forced to work with him on his ad campaign. He turns his attention to her, apologizing for being brash. He slowly worms his way into her life, befriending her favorite people in town, and showering her in attention she's been craving–even if she’s not ready to admit it out loud. She is determined to keep him at arms length, fearful he’ll use her heart until he leaves like her mom did. After quitting her job on a whim and feeling reckless, she decides to say yes to a date with Callum. Cruising the lake, sharing their biggest fears, and him revealing his plans to stay in Maine making her feel a connection she’s never felt, making her question whether NYC is still a dream worth chasing.



I’m a debut author living in west Michigan, originally from a small town near the great lakes in Michigan. I spend my days homeschooling my three boys. THE SUNSETS WITH YOU was inspired by my experiences in childhood and growing up on a lake.

1i3lcwz,https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/1i3lcwz/if_he_wanted_to_he_would/,"if he wanted to, he would?","I have an endless situation with a guy—we’ve liked each other since childhood (we’re 22 now). It has always been obvious that we liked each other; our friends always said it out loud. But we were kids, and everything was a bit confusing and experimental.

One day, after many years of waiting (he's a very reserved guy, not sure if it's shyness or because he likes to play hard to get), he tried to kiss me. But by then, I was tired of his attitude, so I pushed him away. After that, I forgot about him for three years—or so I thought. Apparently, he didn’t forget about me; quite the opposite.

I ran into him two years ago, and right away, I felt that connection again, so I started going to places where he was. His friends and people from our town told me he was crazy about me, and I could see it too. We would spend hours looking into each other's eyes, smiling non-stop, flirting, and asking each other all sorts of questions. Still, whenever I left the bar, he never texted me.

Eventually, I managed to kiss him, and he “confessed” everything to me, but we played a bit of cat and mouse. After that night, he didn’t say anything, so I went to his bar twice with a friend. I noticed he was jealous and immediately left. After that, I stopped going and focused on my own life. I even got back with my ex because I felt like this situation wasn’t going anywhere—it made me feel insecure that he never messaged me after promising he would come for me, that we’d go do things together, and after everything he said about how much he liked me.

When I ran into him again, he looked at me with this distant and resentful expression—it was strange. I sent him a couple of messages, but nothing came of it.

The following summer, he started asking my sister about me again, very interested, trying to get information. So I went back to the bar, and he asked my sister if I had a boyfriend. I could feel his eyes on me the whole time. We planned to hang out with my sister, but at the last minute, he canceled—it hurt me a lot.

A week ago, I saw him again because, during Christmas, he kept insisting on asking my sister about me and making comments like, ""I'll only go if your sister is there."" When I got to the party, he disappeared—I think he had another party, but apparently, he just went to eat at his grandma’s house. I was talking to his friends, and we even called him (considering that since the day we kissed, I haven’t spoken more than one sentence to him, calling him was a big deal).

Two hours later, he finally showed up. I overheard his friend saying, ""Everyone’s gone, except the one you want,"" which gave me hope, haha. When he arrived, he was smiling, and I pulled him aside—we talked intensely for a long time, with everyone at the bar watching us. But we could only look at each other, like magnets. He even said things like, ""If you and I were a couple..."" as if to see my reaction. He caressed my face and that kind of thing.

Since the bar was closing, I suggested going somewhere else for a drink, but he said he was going home because he wasn’t feeling well (which was true). But I didn’t understand—his friends had told me I was like an obsession for him, that they were tired of hearing about me, that he wasn’t seeing anyone else, that he only acted this way with me—so why wasn’t he taking the opportunity?

Why, when I asked him to take me home and he realized it was a bit far, did he say no? Then he said he would call me for coffee, that he liked seeing me ""every now and then"" because that way, he would be excited to see me (this really confuses me—like, don’t you want to see me all the time like I want to see you?). Of course, he hasn’t said anything, as usual.

I know he has struggled with social anxiety in the past and doesn’t usually date girls, but I still don’t understand. There are thousands of little details I haven’t even mentioned—like him showing up drunk and shouting my name, or admitting that when I came with the Italian guy, he was super, super, super jealous while staring into my eyes like he was devouring me, or his friends always laughing whenever I arrived.

All of this makes me think he really likes me, but then…? He does nothing. What do you think? I'm starting to believe he only likes the fantasy.",0,1737134078.0,teenagers,0,0.5,False
1i3lcbn,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/1i3lcbn/in_defense_of_multithreading/,In defense of multithreading,"\[ starts morning coffee \]  
Hi everybody. My name is Walter and I am a `threading` user. I don't intend to stop. And I don't want to fight about it. We `threading` users just want to understood. And perhaps for you to join us.

Despite what you may have heard, Python's `threading` module is a very straightforward and efficient solution for certain types of tasks — especially for persistent processes that handle multiple asynchronous I/O like connected devices or messages from a network.

**How it works:**  
Each task that might block waiting for input or block because it runs continuously can be put into its own thread. Each of these threads can run continuously and independently. It may sound like it could be complicated to communicate with tasks running in their own threads. But Python makes it super simple.

It's easy to pass data in and out of running threads by using Python's `queue` data type.  It's a sequence data type that safe for use by multiple concurrent threads and processes.  And if you subclass the `threading.Thread` class, the resulting class's  `self` scope will be accessible in both^(1) the created thread and the main thread.  The example below makes this jargon clearer. Hopefully.

**Limitations:**  
All of the threads in one program run in the same core of the processor. So multithreading doesn't buy you more processor cores. And the starting of each thread isn't super fast.

Threading really shines for long-running programs that are bound by lots of asynchronous i/o.

**The Competition**:  
The Multiprocessing module is similar to multithreading but runs on multiple cores of the processor, buying you more processing cycles. Its memory and CPU usage are higher. And when subclassed, its `self` scope doesn't span both the main and new process (I think).  So if you need more i/o but not more processor threading is a good choice.

`asyncio` is great for short tasks that have a distinct start and end. Like generating web pages. I only really know this paradigm from using it a lot in nodejs. Please do chime in if you want to flesh this part out.

**The Example:**  
My hasty example below shows how threading can keep tasks with very different rhythms separated and spinning freely.  Don't pick at it too hard; I just whipped it up as an example and haven't run it.

Each class's run() method runs in its own thread. The run() method is part of threading.Thread and is being overwritten here.

I usually start work around 10 and by 15-16 I feel like my brain cache is full, due to my work requiring intake and handling of information.

The best way to re-charge is to take a power nap around that time. How long doesn't matter, although the whole process is usually like 30-45 minutes, but can be shorter. The important aspect is to get to the part where the lights go out, which I assume is the deep sleep phase. Even a couple of minutes of that feels like it deletes my ""Recycle bin"". I then get a cup of coffee, go outside for a bit and maybe smoke a cig.

I can then go back to work an be productive till bed time if need to.

BUT, sometimes I can't get myself to that state, to fall asleep just for a bit and in that case I'm pretty much useless for the rest of the day.

Does anyone else have this and how do you handle it? Any techniques on how to fall asleep quickly?

I have a 3 month old (13 weeks) and day to day life has become honestly a nightmare. 

When she was a newborn, I struggled with the lack of sleep and was able to get long stretches at night with the help of her dad & my family. I thought this was a good idea but I think I screwed myself in the long run - I'm pretty sure those long stretches caused my period to come back early (8 weeks pp) which exacerbated her first nursing strike that is still ongoing and I'm still trying hard to overcome. 

Part of why I want to overcome it is now I'm officially a single mother. To put it very briefly: Her dad started out routinely spending time and helping, talking about looking for a place together and then recently jumped ship saying he doesn't want to be a dad. 

issue I'm struggling with is I just want to breastfeed her. It would make my life so much easier especially doing this alone. Right now between making bottles, warming. Pumping. Washing. The idea of ever leaving my moms house seems like a pipe dream because I am drowning and I just want to be able to breastfeed her. Everyone says oh just switch to formula but I just can't let it go and even if I did, I'd still be beating myself up for ruining breastfeeding. She'll only nurse at night/when drowsy/asleep.

She is now up every hour/hour and a half at night, every night. I don't know if it's the regression, I don't know what's happening but I am struggling to function - the only time I feel briefly okay about life is the 20-30 minutes during and after I have my morning coffee. 

She gets bored, its hard to put her down for naps, she fusses when I put her down or walk away and it makes me want to scream because I *don't want to* put her down or walk away while she fusses and cries, but I have to in order to make a bottle or wash a bottle or pump. If I hadn't ruined it I could just nurse her and I wouldn't have to listen to her be sad while I'm away from her. 

I do not have any energy for anything. I barely have the energy required to get her to nap, to entertain her, never mind to make myself presentable and go places and see people. It is so much worse than the ""newborn trenches"" especially because everyone expects you to be doing fine now. There's not as much help offered, people expect you to just...function. But I'm still up every hour and days are so much harder. I thought it would ""get better"" but it honestly seems like it'll only get worse. The thought of having to chase her around when she's mobile and I'm still running on maybe 2 hours of consecutive sleep really scares me. I don't know how other people do this. I feel weak and like she deserves a more capable mom. 

Yesterday she just wouldn't stop fussing and I was *so* tired, I just wished she could nurse happily and fall asleep, I was crying and I said ""WHAT!?""

Then I looked at her, I apologized over and over and told her how much I love her and she smiled but I was crying so much. And even though she didn't cry the look on her face is haunting me. How can I not have patience when other people do the same job on the same amount of sleep just fine? They go about their lives, they have friends, they go to the store, they take their baby to classes and I was just sobbing saying I can't do this I can't do this while she cried.

I love her so much, I love her more than anything in the universe and she is the most precious thing in my life but physically and mentally I feel like I can't get my shit together to do anything. I am so tired and she is just getting more aware and more demanding, she'll even fuss at the bottle now especially if I try to do paced feeding. The pumping feels unsustainable as a single mom when she only contact naps and I need to pump to keep up my supply. I definitely don't have the mental fortitude to exclusively pump. I really want to make it to 6 months. I feel so defeated. I feel so worried for her that maybe I should have given her up to give her a better life, I had no idea I would be this easily depleted and disorganized and lose patience. I just want us to be okay

I'm not sure if it's getting stuck in the spam filters (I've made them stricter as we've been getting more spam lately) or if the Reddit gods are just against me. But apologies for the frenetic posts!

Hey friends, excited to get back into posting more reviews in 2025 as our travel ramps back up post-holidays! Full disclosure, this stay was done by a wonderful member of my team named Sarah. Not to be confused with u/sarahwlee, who in fact has a member on her team named Alex (different Alex than me) - so it's really just quite a mess and we may need to rename everyone here soon lol.

My last visit to OO Cape Town was in 2022 so it's been a minute and I was thrilled to get Sarah in for an updated stay. As I aim to visit more properties more often - I can't physically get to all of them. I will have members of my team going one place while I go to another, bringing you reviews from all over the world at once :). Sarah was around South Africa the past week+ scoping out spots and I'll be in Turks & Caicos for the long weekend going to visit: The Palms, Amanyara & Grace Bay Club. Reviews to come!

**Where we went**: One & Only Cape Town

**When we went**: January 2025

**Who went**: Couple (Sarah & her husband)

**Room type**: Marina Table Mountain Room

**Overview**: One & Only Cape Town is a property for those looking to bop around in the mix of the city while still having a luxurious retreat at the end of the day. Historically I've promoted Ellerman House (also stayed on this trip, review coming soon), tbh it's still my favorite. I love the picturesque cliffside location and understated vibe when you drive up, not knowing that just beyond the gates is this spectacular, perfectly renovated yet authentic, ultra-private mansion. Plus I'm a REAL sucker for the snack room - last time I was there I skipped two meals in favor of the snacks. However, in 2025 I'm trying to expand my repertoire because obviously there are many great hotels in CT and some people do want to be in the city. And so that is how Sarah's visit to O&O CT came to be! PS - we are still working on our photo taking skills so mixed in here are some of Sarah's pics and some from Kerzer. I'll label where relevant. The really profesh photo's are Kerzer's lol.

**Property**: 9/10

[Sarah photo - Marina Rise](https://preview.redd.it/716n6lu16lde1.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=112d3a696d8d04b1edfe6915f72be17ba2607332)

Forming the backbone of the property is the Marine Rise building. With 91 rooms & suites along with the main entrance, lobby and restaurants, this is the central hub of the property. While the exterior of the building is fairly unremarkable, once you walk into the main lobby, the majesty of Table Mountain overwhelms you as you take it in through enormous floor to ceiling glass windows. As the mountain rises beyond the grounds of the property, any fleeting thought of the lackluster exterior is long gone. This natural wonder of Cape Town is truly breathtaking. I’ll say, this is where O&O has Ellerman House beat.

In front of the Table Mountain view is the circular lobby bar which has a beautiful sculpture by the artist, Trzebinski. This sculpture depicts the local legend, ""The Watchers."" According to the legend, Table Mountain is one of four Watchers, giants of natural form created by Mother Earth to protect the land from the Great Sea Dragon. The view of this sculpture with the mountain behind is really quite special.

Beyond the lobby lies your first glimpse of the manmade islands of the property. These islands are One & Only's way of bringing local nature back into the resort. As many of you may know, central to O&O's design ethos is creating a sense of place that is not only culturally relevant, but just as important, provides a tribute to the natural environment of the destination. While this property is in the midst of the city, they have brought elements of the original nature back through these islands. The lush, over planted land feels more like a garden oasis than a hotel. As soon as you step foot outside Marine Rise you can hear the call of birds unlike anything you're used to in a city property.

While the Marine Rise building may feel more like a city hotel, the islands are where everything changes. As you head toward them, you are enveloped by near forest cover - and it's with this that you're able to forget, if only briefly, that you're in the middle of a bustling city. The islands are home to the spa, pool and 41 rooms. The infinity pool is a highlight and since it's heated, it can be enjoyed year round.

[Sarah photo](https://preview.redd.it/bccu5jy86lde1.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2975ad98e6a4502d9113c73b174b13085fc02475)

The reason I'm giving the property an 8.5 not a 10 is twofold

1. While the islands are lush and beautiful, I do feel parts of the exterior to the Marina Rise building feels starkly less lush and so some of the beauty and integration is lost there.
2. In my experience, One & Only is uniquely successful at integrating the local aesthetic and art into their design ethos to create a property that feels authentic while maintaining the calm and chic One & Only retreat experience. But for some reason, certain pieces of the common spaces within the Marina Rise building doesn’t execute this as flawlessly as some other properties and feels a bit frenetic. I don’t pretend to be a design critic, and if you saw the interior of my home you’d be appalled, but it’s something about the mix of colors, patterns and materials that doesn’t feel as serene and elegant as many of the other OO properties. Locations like OO Mandarina and OO Gorilla's Nest are able to imbibe the local aesthetic and blend it with their unique design eye to create a soothing and chic yet entirely authentic sense of place. I just don’t feel that with OO Cape Town. 

**Rooms**: 8.5/10

The property was completely renovated in 2022 - all 132 rooms were renovated. 91 of those rooms are in the Marina Rise building and 41 are on the island. The Marina Rise rooms were designed based on the raw beauty of the mountain, with earthy tones and textures.

The island rooms are all designed based on the ocean - so more blues. They have a view of the water surrounding the island and some have a view of the Marina Rise building. While the island rooms are entirely relaxing and tranquil, in terms of views, you don't see much of Cape Town so you really could be anywhere. Whereas the Marina Rise building offers those sweeping views of Table Mountain.

The rooms are well sized for a city hotel. Like many OO's the layouts are great and use the space well. A large number of rooms don't have great views so that's why the lower rating.

**Service**: 7.5/10

* This is where things aren't as great.
* While all the staff are very friendly, welcoming, and there was amazing service everywhere we went  within the hotel, there were some hiccups on the service side of things to be aware of.
* The room cleaning and service seemed to be a bit clunky at times
   * A garbage bag was left in the room after the attendants came on the first day. Sarah moved it out of the way by the door to be taken the next time they came but it was left again.
   * There was a big ring mark (the size of a dinner plate) on top of the coffee counter that was sticky when they arrived , so it hadn’t been cleaned / wiped down from previous guests
   * They had 2 occasions where the do not disturb sign was on, but they rang the doorbell for the room - one of the occasions it was for a delivery but was for the wrong room, and the  second time they rang twice before leaving (we think it could have been for turn down  service, but the do not disturb was on).
   * With the cleaning and do not disturb sign issues, it did feel slightly clunky in service, but the staff  were so nice and helpful when you needed something. Would just be aware of it, and let guests  know what to expect.

**Food & Restaurants**: 

* **Rooi** \- just completed the renovations. This is where breakfast will be served in the mornings. Incredible view of table mountain, especially for the outdoor seating.  Breakfast is a full buffet daily from 6:30-11am. Rooi also offers dinner - more focused on South African cuisine cooked by fire.
* **Nobu** \- the only Nobu in Southern Africa. Recommend booking a table in advance, but  they do try to keep a few tables each night for in-house walk-ins.
* **Isola** \- Mediterranean poolside restaurant available daily during summer months. It is  generally closed from around May-October each year. During winter months, the in-room  dining can be ordered from the pool.
* **Vista bar & lounge** \- Amazing views in the heart of the hotel. A great place to go for a  drink or cocktail, they do offer meals as well. They have a popular afternoon tea from  2-5pm each day, recommended to be booked in advance. There is a live pianist during  the afternoon tea times daily, and live music in the lounge every evening.

**Extras & activities**: 

* Like all OO's, they work hard to provide a great Kids Club with dynamic programming",3,1737133731.0,chubbytravel,0,1.0,False

The moon hung low over the sleepy town of RidgeWater Creek, its faint glow barely penetrating the dense forest on the outskirts.

As I stepped out of my car, my boots crunched against the gravel road, carrying me toward the cordoned-off crime scene.

The red and blue strobes of police lights painted chaotic flashes across the area, but my focus remained on the figure sprawled on the ground.

The first thing that struck me was the smell—a sickly mix of damp soil and something metallic, almost like rusted iron or old blood.

It was the kind of stench that clings to the back of your throat, refusing to let go. I adjusted my scarf as I ducked under the yellow tape fluttering in the wind.

The victim was a man in his late thirties—married, no kids—a local high school teacher named Gregory Tate. He lay on his back, arms splayed wide as if he’d been clawing at the ground in desperation. But there were no wounds, no blood, no evidence of force or struggle. His body was completely intact.

Then my flashlight caught his face, and I felt my stomach drop.

His mouth hung unnaturally wide, stretched into a soundless scream frozen in time. His eyes bulged, staring at the void, but still radiated with raw unrelenting terror.

It was as if his last moments had been carved into his flesh—a permanent echo of whatever had seized him in those final horrifying seconds.

A shiver crawled up my spine as my thoughts immediately snapped back to two other murders, both eerily similar, and both occurring within the last two weeks.

I lowered my flashlight, sweeping it over the ground around the body. That’s when I noticed it: a crudely etched circle surrounding him, as though drawn during his final moments.

Near his feet, a string of letters was scrawled into the dirt—in a language I couldn’t recognize.

The arrangement felt disturbingly ritualistic, as if the victim had somehow been drawn into a sinister rite that eventually claimed his life.

What made the scene even more grotesque was that the two earlier victims had also been found dead under similar circumstances.

The next day back at my station, I immersed myself in the case files, leaning back in my chair as the details swirled through my mind.

**Victim One, Clara Evans**: A store clerk was found dead in her living room, slumped in a corner. There was no sign of forced entry, but her face was frozen in paralyzing fear. Using her lipstick, she had drawn a circle around herself and left illegible scrawls near her feet. She had even quit her job a week earlier, citing stress, and was living alone at the time.

**Victim Two, Jack Monroe**:  A mechanic found dead in his garage, surrounded by scattered tools. Neighbors mentioned he’d been hearing strange noises outside his house for days. In the week leading up to his death, he barricaded himself in the garage and stopped visiting the local bar, where he was a regular after work.

**Victim Three, Gregory Tate:** A high school teacher, beloved by his students, with no known enemies or debts. His wife observed that he had recently grown terrified of leaving the house after dark, often twitching and trembling at the slightest noise. Then, one night, without explanation, he left home and wandered into the woods a mile away, where he was found dead.

Three victims, three different lives, and no tangible connections between them—except for one chilling similarity: the circumstances of their deaths and the fear that was permanently etched across their faces.

There was also another detail I had to account for. In all three crime scenes, an object was found lying next to the corpse. With the first victim it was a small hand held mirror, with the mechanic it was a miniature toy bus and with the high school teacher, it was a fountain pen.

The really odd thing here though was that the objects looked like relics that belonged to another era, probably the late 70’s or the early 80’s, and it made me wonder if they had been left behind by the killer.

Sergeant Holbrook, however, had a different take. He didn’t mince words, calling it outright “the work of the devil.” A police veteran with decades of experience, Holbrook claimed to remember similar occurrences from his childhood. And each time we arrived at a new crime scene, I could see his face grow paler, as if the evidence before us confirmed his worst fears.

The people of the town had a similar opinion as well. Especially the elderly folks who remembered the killings more than 50 years ago. And when the photos of victims leaked and went viral, it was only a matter of time before the whole community got swept in on the frenzy.

As I took a sip of coffee, Sergeant Holbrook stepped into my cabin, holding a file from the coroner’s office. I opened it, already anticipating what I’d find.

Like the others, our latest victim showed no signs of trauma or struggle—no defensive wounds, no bruises, nothing.

All three had been in good health with no underlying medical conditions. The coroner’s report mentioned cardiac arrest brought on by extreme stress,  but the words rang hollow. It felt more like a convenient excuse than any real explanation.

“Officer Harper…” Holbrook’s voice suddenly cut through my thoughts, his tone measured, almost hesitant. “The Mayor wants to meet you at the town hall.”

A knot tightened in my stomach. Town hall meetings were rarely good news.

With three unexplained deaths in less than 2 weeks, the townsfolk of Ridgewater Creek—a tight-knit community of just 1,000 people—were bound to have questions, and not the easy kind. News here moved faster than the wind, and the pressure to provide answers was mounting.

Being the new cop in town— a city officer who had moved here just six months ago to take charge—had already made me a topic of gossip. Now, with these cases piling up, it felt like the tide of suspicion was beginning to shift toward me.

Holbrook and I climbed into the cruiser, and as we drove through the quiet streets, I stared out the window, running through what I’d say in my head.

When we arrived, the town hall was already packed with people. Parents clutched their children protectively, teenagers huddled together in nervous whispers, and the elderly exchanged worried glances. The weight of their fear hung heavy in the air, pressing against me like a storm cloud as I walked nervously through the room, their silent stares following my every step.

The mayor opened the meeting with strained reassurances before gesturing for me to step forward.

""Good morning,"" I started, scanning the sea of tense, worried faces. ""I'm Officer Evelyn Harper. I want to reassure you that we are doing everything within our power to solve these tragic cases. While we don't have all the answers yet, we are committed to uncovering the truth. But we need your cooperation. For the next 10 days, please, stay indoors after dark, and if you notice anything unusual, report it to us immediately.""

As I continued speaking and patiently answered their questions, my eyes continuously swept over the crowd.

One woman in the second row particularly stood out. Her silver hair gleamed under the harsh lights, and her hands rested neatly on her lap. While the rest wore their fear openly, her expression was serene—calm to the point of detachment.

When the meeting ended an hour later, I swiftly moved toward her. ""Excuse me, ma’am,"" I said as the crowd began to thin.

She turned to me, her blue eyes sharp and clear. “Hello Officer. I am Ruth. Nice to finally meet you,” she said with a faint smile.

“Ruth,” I said, stepping closer, “would you like a ride home?”

Her smile deepened just slightly. “That’s very kind of you, Officer Harper. Yes. I’d appreciate that.”

Holbrook gave me a questioning glance, but I waved him off, while Ruth and I walked toward the cruiser.

As we drove to her residence, Ruth began to share snippets from her life. She was in her early seventies, born and raised in Ridgewater Creek. She’d never married, had no children, and retired only recently from her position as the local school librarian.

When we arrived at her place, she invited me inside. Her home was warm and inviting, carrying the comforting scent of old wood and lavender.

But what struck me most however was the massive bookshelf dominating her living room, stretching floor to ceiling and packed with books—some weathered, others pristine, all meticulously arranged.

“You have quite the collection,” I remarked, my eyes scanning the rows of books.

“Books are windows to understanding, Officer Harper,” she said with a wistful smile. “But they can also be windows to something darker… something forgotten.”

 “You seemed unusually calm today at the town hall,” I said carefully as I took a seat across from her.

“Fear clouds judgment, my dear,” she replied softly. “I’ve lived long enough to know that panic only leads to mistakes. The key is to look closely, think clearly, and see what others might overlook.”

Her words lingered, and I leaned forward. “So what are your thoughts on these deaths? What do you think is really going on here?”

Ruth stood without replying, crossing to her bookshelf. Her fingers brushed over the spines before settling on a weathered, leather-bound volume. She opened it with care, flipping through the pages until she stopped at an illustration.

The image was jarring: a figure lay on the ground, encircled by a crudely drawn ring, with an undecipherable text scrawled near its feet. It was eerily similar to the crime scenes. My heart suddenly skipped a beat.

“This… this looks just like the crime scenes,” I whispered.

I leaned closer, studying the page. “What does the scrawl mean?”

Her gaze met mine, calm yet piercing. “It says ‘Jurupari,’” she replied, her voice steady. “It means ‘Voice of Fear.’ According to an ancient Amazonian legend, it's an entity that devours the soul of its victim after overwhelming them with fear.”

A cold knot tightened in my stomach as I stared at the illustration, unsure of what to say.

Ruth then turned back a page, pointing to a dark, distorted figure cloaked in shadow. “This is what the legend speaks of,” she explained. “An entity feared for centuries, known for consuming the souls of its victims. It thrives on fear—smelling it, tasting it and even savoring it. Its origins are unknown, but it has appeared across the country in several places over the years. Fifty years ago, it came to Ridgewater Creek.”

I listened, both horrified and captivated, as her words sank in.

“In the seventies,” she continued, “this town was plagued by a series of unexplained deaths. No signs of struggle, no obvious causes—people were just dropping dead, and no one could figure out why. It went on for months, freezing the town in fear. The police were desperate for answers, but they found nothing.”

She paused, her face darkening with the weight of the memory. “That’s when I found this book. As a librarian, I often sourced rare volumes, and when I saw this one, I had a feeling it might hold the answers we needed. I took it to the police chief, but he dismissed it immediately—called it nonsense.”

Her expression softened, and a faint smile tugged at her lips. “But there was one person who listened—a young sergeant named Henry Cross. He quietly observed while I tried to explain to the Chief. He was the tenacious type I must say, the kind of man who couldn’t let something go until he understood it. He even came to my home, sat right where you’re sitting now, and let me explain I knew. A few days later, he came back and said he’d found a promising lead. He was going somewhere to investigate.”

 “And then?” I asked eager to get to the bottom of it.

She sighed deeply. “I never saw him again. He vanished without a trace. The murders stopped soon after, and the town returned to normal. But Henry… he was never seen or heard from again.”

“What do you think happened?” I asked intrigued.

Her expression grew inscrutable as she hesitated. “That, Officer Harper, is a question I’ve pondered for decades. Maybe you can connect the dots, and let me know how this story ends.”

“Do you know where he went?” I pressed.

She nodded. “He said he was going to the sawmill.”

Just then, my phone buzzed in my pocket. I quickly answered, Holbrook’s voice sharp with urgency.

“Chief,” he said, his tone grim, “we’ve got another one.”

“Where?” I asked, my grip tightening on the phone.

“The old sawmill,” he replied.

I quickly thanked Ruth and headed for the mill, long abandoned and feared by the local townsfolk. Perched on the edge of town, it had stood vacant for decades, its history making it a place that people usually believe to be haunted.  

As I stepped out of my cruiser, the thick, suffocating scent of rusted iron and decay hit me as if it had settled into the very air.

Before me loomed the mill, a Second World War era relic continuing to wither away under years of neglect. The roof had caved in at several points, and vines snaked through the broken windows, claiming the crumbling interior. The structure still somehow seemed almost alive, yet entirely forgotten.

To my right, a jeep had crashed into the side of the building, its front half crushed against the brickwork. Paramedics were extracting the driver’s lifeless body, twisted and mangled beyond recognition. The passenger door hung open, offering a clear view inside the mill where another young man lay sprawled across the dusty floor.

Unlike his friend this one was alive. As I approached, I noticed one of the medics kneeling beside him, injecting something into his bloodstream to stabilize him.

Moments later, the man startled awake, his body jerking as his eyes flew open, wide with terror. He scanned the scene wildly, his breath ragged and shallow, until his gaze fixed on the wrecked jeep outside. Recognition dawned, and his chest heaved as he tried to speak.

“It’s my friend,” he gasped, his voice breaking. “He just... he just lost it. We were headed to the city—everything was fine. Then, out of nowhere, he panicked. Started screaming like a madman—like he had seen something. He suddenly swerved off the road and drove straight into the building. I... I barely managed to jump out just before we hit the building.”

The medics eventually helped him to his feet and escorted him to the waiting ambulance.

Meanwhile, I turned my attention to the mill’s interior. My eyes were drawn instantly to a large, sealed fireplace at one end of the room. The mortar appeared weathered, but the bricks had been meticulously arranged, completely blocking the hearth.

I stepped outside again, unable to shake the peculiar sight that kept nagging at me. From the outside, I could see that the jeep had rammed directly into the building's fireplace. I called for Sergeant Holbrooke, and together, we had the vehicle reversed. As the jeep was pulled back, the bricks began to crumble, revealing something hidden within.

Behind the wall of debris was a skeletal figure, awkwardly slumped in the confines of the fireplace. Its bony hands tightly clutched a weathered brown book, its leather cover stained with a large patch of blood on the back, yet otherwise its overall condition remarkably intact.

The tattered remnants of fabric clinging to the skeletal remains made the uniform hard to identify, but the government-issued firearm lying beside him left no doubt in my mind: I was looking at the mortal remains of Sergeant Cross.

We spent the rest of the day combing through the mill, collecting the necessary samples for forensic testing, and then interrogating the survivor back at the hospital to get his full account of the events.

By the time I was finished, it was already half past eleven. As I was heading out for home, I noticed the sergeant's journal lying in the evidence tray, tagged and ready for testing. Without thinking, I grabbed it and made my way home, planning to take a long bath before finally getting some rest.

Entering the bathroom, I prepared the tub, quickly undressed, and waded into the warm water. As I leaned back, I picked up the sergeant’s journal and began reading.

 

 

 ***Investigative Journal of H. Cross***

*People like to think the badge is about ""serve and protect."" But for me, it’s always been about Ricky and what he stood for. He’s the reason I’m here, walking the beat, keeping an eye out for the bully lurking in the shadows.*

*Growing up in foster care, I didn’t have much more than the shirt on my back and a hundred reasons to keep my head down. The other kids were bigger, meaner, and twice as cruel. Every day felt like a battle, and every night I prayed I wouldn’t wake up with a black eye—or worse.*

*Then came Ricky.*

*He wasn’t some guardian angel swooping in to save me. Nah, he was just another kid dumped into the system, rough around the edges like the rest of us. But Ricky didn’t believe in running or hiding.*

*“Punch first and think later,” he always used to say, and he lived by it.*

*He taught me how to stand tall, to fight back—not just with fists, but with grit, persistence, and anything else that gave us an edge.*

*A poke in the eye, a kick in the nuts, smashing a bottle over someone’s head while they were busy eating—it didn’t matter. The rules were simple: keep going, again and again, until they start to feel it in their bones.*

*I’ll never forget the one time we fought back. Three bigger kids had us cornered behind the school yard. They were huge, grinning like wolves, and ready to pounce.*

*Ricky didn’t hesitate. He threw the first punch, and I followed right behind him. We didn’t win—not even close. By the end of it, we were in the hospital with more broken bones than I could count. My ribs ached for weeks, and every breath felt like fire.*

*But what I remember most isn’t the pain—it’s lying there in that hospital bed, tears streaming down my face, feeling something I’d never felt before: a sense of victory. We may not have won the fight, but we held our heads high. And when we got finally back, we tormented them for weeks until we made damn sure they never picked on us again.*

*Ricky was the only real friend I ever had—the only one that mattered, at least. So when I found him dead at a crime scene, his soul ripped from him, leaving only fear etched on his face, it felt like something inside me had been ripped away too. This wasn’t just murder—it was personal.*

*I knew then and there I’d stop at nothing to find the bastard who did this. I owed Ricky that much. This journal is my attempt to piece it all together—my thoughts, my rage, my resolve.*

*It’s time to bully the bully.*

 

 

***Day 1***

*I hadn’t set foot in the sawmill since my teens, back when a group of us dared each other to explore its eerie halls. No one knows exactly why the place was deemed cursed, but the story goes that workers arrived one morning to a grisly sight: the owner’s lower half lying severed by the saw table, while his upper half roasted in the fireplace.*

*The mill never reopened, and its sinister reputation only deepened with time. Whispers of ghost sightings and unexplained phenomena grew so pervasive that authorities eventually sealed the fireplace to deter thrill-seekers and other oddballs from exploiting the site.*

*Now, here I was again, on a stakeout, sitting in my car hidden among a row of trees with the decaying structure looming in the distance.*

*My mind immediately wandered to the events of the past couple of months. Ridgewater Creek had seen more than 25 deaths, including that of my friend, and we were no closer to solving the case.*

*The air in town was thick with fear—people were irritable, on edge, constantly glancing over their shoulders. Chaos was unravelling right before my eyes, and the community was fraying at the seams.*

*The Chief was unwavering in his belief that a serial killer was behind it all. At first, I agreed—especially with the peculiar items left at each crime scene: an ashtray, a felt hat, a tennis racket, a wristwatch, a cassette tape, a torch etc. They seemed deliberate, almost like a calling card. But the more I examined them, the more they felt... disconnected. There was no clear pattern, no logic linking the objects to each other or the victims.*

*As the body count climbed, so did my doubts. Something about it didn’t sit right.*

*The breakthrough came unexpectedly when a young woman walked into the station, clutching a theory about a supernatural entity tied to an old legend she’d uncovered in a dusty book. The Chief dismissed her as a crank, but desperation has a way of shifting priorities.*

*I couldn’t afford to ignore any lead—no matter how improbable. That evening, I met her at her home. As she laid out her theory, a strange sense of clarity took hold. And it got me thinking.*

*If the entity she called Jurupari was real, it would need a place to hide—somewhere near town but remote enough to remain undisturbed.  The place had to be abandoned, forgotten by time, where no one would think to look.*

*And only one such place came to mind.*

*So when I returned to the sawmill after all these years, I found it in even worse shape than I’d imagined—its wooden frame sagging, the air thick with the stench of rot and mildew.*

*I scoured every corner, but there was nothing unusual. No signs of anything lurking, no evidence to support Ruth’s theory. I was even ready to write it off as a dead end and leave when something caught my eye.*

*In a dim corner of the mill half-buried in debris, lay a curious cluster of items: an American flag keychain, a leather wallet, a razor and a bottle opener. At first glance, they seemed like random junk, discarded and forgotten.*

*But on closer inspection, I noticed they weren’t old or tattered. These items looked reasonably new, and oddly out of place—as if someone had deliberately gathered them, seeing still some value in them where others saw trash. It hit me then: someone, or something, was holding out here. I decided to continue my surveillance for a few more days.*

 

***Day 2***  
*I arrived at the mill as soon as I finished my shift at the station. I spent the entire night keeping watch, fighting off fatigue until sleep finally overtook me in the wee hours of the morning. I jolted awake suddenly, certain I’d seen a sudden flash of light. Heart pounding, I leapt out of the vehicle and rushed to the mill. But when I got there, everything was just as I’d seen it the night before—empty and undisturbed.*

 

***Day 3***  
*When I returned to work in the morning, I heard news of another body.*

*This time, it was an old man who was found dead in his garden, his eyes and mouth locked in an expression of pure terror. But what truly sent a chill down my spine was the leather wallet lying next to him—it was the same one I had seen earlier at the mill.*

*When I rushed back to the mill, I found the wallet and keychain missing while the razor, and bottle opener still remained by the side.*

*An uneasy sensation coursed through my veins as I stared at the objects scattered on the floor.*

*Gripping a stick, I cautiously nudged them apart before hesitantly hovering my little finger over the razor. Taking a deep breath, I let the tip of my little finger make contact.*

*A warm, fuzzy sensation enveloped me, and in an instant, I was transported to a memory from my childhood—my mom tossing me into the air, her laughter ringing out as she caught me mid-flight, then planting a kiss on my cheek.*

*Without thinking, I next placed my ring finger on the razor, and the feeling intensified. This time, I was surrounded by both my parents, their faces illuminated by the soft glow of birthday candles as I leaned in to blow them out.*

*Sweat trickled down my chin as I began lifting my fingers one by one, preparing to grasp the razor fully.*

*But the moment my hand closed around it, a long-buried memory surged to the surface—a fateful night I had forced into the deepest recesses of my mind, one that irrevocably and painfully altered the course of my life.*

*Gasping, I tore my hand away just in time, the force of the memory knocking me backward. My chest tightened as I lay sprawled on the floor, staring at the razor, now innocuously lying among the debris.*

*Then it hit me—a thick, metallic tang in the air, sharp and unmistakable, like rusted iron. The atmosphere in the mill shifted entirely, growing heavier and oppressive.*

*Then, from the direction of the sealed fireplace, a low rumble echoed.*

*I crept closer, my movements slow and deliberate, as I leaned against the cold concrete straining to listen. And the hair on the back of my neck stood on end when I heard it—something faint but unmistakable.*

 *It was cackling, low and stifled, as though someone or something was struggling to suppress its glee.*

He was posted on Facebook by someone in a mutual friend circle, that his family can't keep him anymore. I was already looking for another dog because my female shepherd mix could really use a buddy. However, I recently started learning about how much Goldens can chew... I asked the person about it today and they said agreed that he will try to chew and they wouldn't leave him unsupervised, and that he likes to chew shoes and goes for their coffee table.
Other traits she mentioned: Good in the car, good with other dogs and people, doesn't resource guard, doesn't bark much, doesn't mind nail trims, but he does like mud and digging and also needs to be watched in the yard.

I'm only now hesitant because I'm a renter. I rent a 1000sqft duplex with a yard, so it's decent space, but l'm worried about him potentially going for walls, carpet, digging in the backyard, etc. He does come with a crate, and I work from home, but I don't want to crate him all day while I'm working because I can't be closely watching him. My shepherd mix we adopted at 11 months old and she chewed cardboard and shoes slightly at first only when we left the house, and now she doesn't do it at all.

Any thoughts or tips are much appreciated. She tried to surrender him to the shelter but our shelters are so full, she had to submit an application and wait to hear back 😢",1,1737133637.0,DogAdvice,3,1.0,False

So i have for a long time experienced quite big fps drops on my computer while playing league of legends. Most of the time i go from 200 fps at game start to around 80 fps mid game. Now i do know that because of teamfights, minions and a lot of things happening, of course its expected to lower the fps, but with my set up im not really sure why it goes that low, so im looking for some help :D.

I think this because while playing teamfights and when a lot of things happening, my graphics card and my cpu both do not go over 30% usage and keeps under 50 degrees.  
Here are my computer specifications:

    CPU
    
    Intel Core i9 @ 3.60GHz
    
    Coffee Lake 14nm Technology
    
    RAM
    
    32,0GB
    
    Motherboard
    
    ASUSTeK COMPUTER INC. TUF Z370-PLUS GAMING II (LGA1151)

    Odyssey G95SC (5120x1440@240Hz)
    
    4089MB NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 SUPER (InnoVISION Multimedia)44 °C

Here a some things i have looked in to

\- I have tried cleaning everything inside the computer, replaces thermal paste, new water cooler. This has helped with cpu usage but does not give more fps

\- Since i have a very wide monitor i play in windowed mode, so i looked at gsync for both windowed and fullscren, and also toggles the fullscreen compatibility setting in properties of the game. Also i have tried playing in borderless and fullscreen also with same issue. Also i have tried changing between HDMI 2.1 and DP to see if there is any difference

\- Put my monitor in gaming mode and made sure that it itself does not have vsync on or anything that might do something negative performance wise

\- I have updated my graphics card driver, looked a lot on nvidia controlpanels, toggling different things and tried out almost everything in there.

\- I have changed the graphics settings in the game itself but no matter if very high or very low, it gives the same fps average, vsync off and no framerate cap.

\- Reinstalled the game myself and used hextech tool for a clean reinstall of the game

\- Reinstalled windows on my computer and tried with a whole new fresh install

\- Followed some guides on specific BIOS settings like XMP(I think its called) and resizeBAR(Also not quite sure if its called this)

\- Overclocked the computer a little bit and not at all,

\- Reinstalling DirectX and tried changing the league txt file to use legacy mode

\- Used Razer software to close everything in the background and do a cleanup before playing

\- In task manager, set league of legends to high priority

1i3l1ml,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1i3l1ml/my_parents_financially_ruined_themselves/,My Parents Financially Ruined Themselves,"My parents quit their jobs, sold our house, and packed up and moved 1200 miles away across the country about 2 years ago pretty much out of the blue. After being unemployed for around a year and burning through their savings, my dad decided to invest every last penny they had into franchising a coffee chain which has never taken off the way he intended. This has financially ruined them; they are 62 and 64 years old with no savings, no retirement, and no assets besides a car. They were evicted from the luxury apartment they were renting for not paying, which resulted in them living with family friends for a few months. About a month ago, those family friends kicked them out due to behavioral problems with my mentally handicapped younger sister who is living with them. For a little while, they were facing the three of them living out of a motel room with 3 cats. By the grace of god, they were able to find a shitty 2-bedroom apartment with a landlord who doesn’t care to run a credit check as long as the rent is paid, which is where they are now living.

 

I always thought my parents were smart people who made good decisions, but this entire situation is causing me to comb back through my childhood memories and look at them through a new perspective. I had an upper middle-class upbringing in a part of the US known for being high cost of living. Neither of my parents went to college, despite that my dad found success in franchising in the fast-food industry and pulled in a salary of around 250K+ for most of my childhood and adolescence. My mother didn’t work for most of my life, she began working when I was around 16 years old. She started with part time office jobs or retail jobs, but over time had a career as a preschool classroom aide pulling in a salary of around 35-40K per year. We lived in a big, beautiful, new build house with a saltwater in-ground pool and a tennis court in the backyard. My parents always drove leased luxury cars, trading in for a new one every 3 years or so. There was always money for things like big summer parties, or luxury vacations, or expensive home renovations but for daily necessities like food, clothing or doctor’s visits things always felt very tight and my parents would complain constantly about how my 3 sisters, and I were a drain on their finances. As a teen, I had always assumed things were tight like this because a large portion of their income was going to savings/retirement, so I didn’t question it much.

 

I see now that my parents priorities have been in the wrong place for decades and it’s really fucking with my head. On a yearly salary of 300K+, we should have been doing great, but I see now that my parents constant need to keep up with the joneses left them in a position where they were leveraged to the hilt at all times. There are a ton of details that I’m leaving out here, because this would be a literal novel if I put them in, but overall realizing this as an adult who is about to get married and start my own life with my fiancé is devastating. I have so much anger toward my parents for their terrible decisions, and so much guilt for being angry at them at a point in time when they are not doing well and probably scared for their future. I keep looking back into my childhood and feeling complicit in their poor decisions even though I was just a child. I look back on vacations, and parties and expensive dance classes and it all just feels wrong and bad and like I contributed to this mess unknowingly. Not only did this scare the absolute crap out of me in terms of how my fiancé and I are going to handle our finances going forward, but it’s causing me to have a huge identity crisis because I’m realizing the life I thought I had this whole time was a huge lie.

 

I’m not sure what my intention is in putting this out here, just wanted to get it off my chest, I guess. Nobody in my life besides my fiancé and some family know any of this information, and I am deeply deeply ashamed and embarrassed by the whole thing. The worst part is that this literally keeps me up at night and causes me a tremendous amount of daily anxiety, but my parents seem to think it’s no big deal and don’t seem worried or sorry or regretful about any of it at all.",1,1737133302.0,offmychest,2,1.0,False
1i3l1bn,https://www.reddit.com/r/coffee_roasters/comments/1i3l1bn/as_a_roaster_what_features_would_you_want_on_a/,"As a roaster, what features would you want on a website that connects roasters and coffee lovers?","Hey everyone,

A friend and I are in the process of launching a (free) coffee website that helps coffee lovers discover roasters and their beans and would love to get some feedback on what roasters would find useful. Right now, we have about 1,400 roasters and 20,000 coffee beans cataloged, and users can search and filter by things like location, roast level, origin, flavor notes, and price. We have pages setup for each individual coffee and roaster, and outgoing links directly to the roaster’s website and product pages. No affiliate links or anything, and we’re not selling anything so hopefully this is in-bounds.

We thought it was difficult for people to research/find coffee so we’ve been working on building the product we wish existed! We want it to be a level playing field for roasters of all sizes to reach new customers, regardless of budget and marketing talent, and we’d love to hear directly from roasters what sort of features would be valuable to you.

One feature we’re thinking about adding is letting roasters manually edit their pages to post stuff that might not be on their website. Currently, our website updates daily based on changes to the roaster’s website, but we think there’s more information that users would find helpful. You’d be able to add stuff like:

* Events (cuppings, classes, etc.), Locations, Sales, etc
* Extra info about your beans (brewing tips, certifications, processes, etc.)

We’d love to hear your thoughts:

1. What features would make this website more useful for you or your customers?
2. What info do you think is essential for your roaster profile? If people are using the site to find coffee, do you think you would want to post/update details that we aren’t already pulling?
3. Any thoughts, feedback, comments, constructive criticism; we find anything extremely useful as we start sharing this with the world!

Here’s the site if you’re curious: [coffeedrippd.com](https://coffeedrippd.com/). If mods would prefer I remove the link, please let me know! If you’re registered, you will see options to save, rate, and log/journal coffees/roasters (the journal option will let you input purchase date, roast date, date you finish a bag, and add notes, if anyone is looking for someone to track what they are drinking).

We really appreciate your time and look forward to hearing any thoughts you have!

p.s. We do have quite a few more roasters to add, but feel free to let me know if you are not currently listed on our site and we can try to bump you up sooner than later! We are currently focused on the USA but hopefully we can expand in the future!",2,1737133281.0,coffee_roasters,1,1.0,False
1i3l1aj,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1i3l1aj/mormons_dont_actually_believe/,Mormons don't actually believe,"and I'll tell you why.

If they ACTUALLY believed, like truly, genuinely, realistically believed in the truth claims of the church, then don't you think they would act and behave in a drastically different manner? 

There's a misconception that Mormons are really nice, but most ex members know it's pretty fake, usually with ulterior motives. IF  the members ACTUALLY believed, they would ACTUALLY be nice, loving, and accepting, without any ulterior motives or goals, like Christ, they would love and help others simply because it's the right thing to do. They would ACTUALLY follow his example.

If they ACTUALLY believed, wouldn't most, if not every member be a missionary? Wouldn't they do as Christ said, selling all that they had and devoting their time to helping and serving others, spreading his gospel, and trying to make the world a better place?

If it was real, and they ACTUALLY believed, it would be the most important thing ever, they would do everything they could to spread the gospel, spending all of their time doing so. They wouldn't pursue careers, they wouldn't do any selfish or self-serving activities, they would genuinely understand that this life isn't what is important, only the next life is important, so they would devote nearly 100% of their time to serving others and spreading the gospel.

When most people mess up and sin, there's that little thought in the back of their head that they'll just repent later, even though they know they're not supposed to think that, it's natural, and they do think that.
However, if they ACTUALLY believed, they very likely wouldn't ever sin. I know it sounds ridiculous, but if they truly believed, that active belief would be stronger than the small thought in the back of their head about repenting later.
They wouldn't watch p0rn, they wouldn't drink, partake of coffee or tea, break the sabbath day, take the lord's name in vain, etc.
They would legitimately and genuinely obey all the commandments and do everything they could to help others to do so.
We would see less sitting on the fence, no nuanced mormons, no ""going to the temple-yet I still drink coffee mormons"", they would legitimately and wholeheartedly obey the commandments.

If they ACTUALLY believed, they'd CORRECTLY follow the word of wisdom, less meat, better health, taking care of themselves, no over consumption of any particular item like sugar / sweets. Why are so many members overweight or diabetic? That shouldn't be a thing if they legitimately obeyed the word wisdom, right? 

If they ACTUALLY believed, wouldn't they study their scriptures daily, if not 2 to 3 times a day? Wouldn't they be fasting most all the time? Wouldn't their prayers be genuine, from the heart, and personal, not rote, using the same phrases each time. Wouldn't the prayers sound more like a conversation with a deity, and not a pre-programmed script? Wouldn't they do Temple work as much as possible, not just when they're older and retired? 

If they ACTUALLY believed, wouldn't they know near every church history lesson, story, and tale? Wouldn't they know every bible story, book of mormon story, and all the important scriptures by heart? It seems like ex-members know more than the members do, most of the time, but if a member genuinely believed, don't you think they would know more about their belief/religion than anyone else?

When members leave, wouldn't the believing members genuinely want to know why they left, instead of make up silly excuses like they're lazy. Wouldn't they do everything they could to study why the person left and want to know for themselves what was troubling the person, wouldn't they do everything they could to be a true friend with no ulterior motives?
Shouldn't the members know all the ""anti-mormon"" material better than the ex-members? I would assume that a genuinely believing person would know all the counterpoints and not just pretend to know.

---

I just can't help but think that nearly everyone in the church, kind of sort of just hopes it's true, it's basically a comfort blanket for them, to ease their fears about death or the next life, to make it so that the wrongs they've done in this life are okay because of the atonement, but that genuinely, no one, really, truly, believes it's true.

Deep down, in the recesses of their mind, in the dark parts of their heart, they genuinely know that it's silly, ridiculous, and stupid. They know it's not true, how could it be, none of it makes any sense. But they pretend, and they've pretended long enough that they ""think"" they know it's true.
They've been brainwashed long enough, coerced, forced, and manipulated. They're blind to the truth, yet deep down they still know it's not true, otherwise, if they ACTUALLY believed, don't you think they would behave differently?

I'm certain that if people actually believed, the church and its members would look a hell of a lot different. It would genuinely be a good institution and a benefit to the world.
This goes for most religions or believers. If people actually believed in their religion, their life, their activities, and their behavior would be vastly different.
But no one really believes, because actions speak louder than words, and no one genuinely lives their religion. They're all just children pretending.

Please add to this concept, share your thoughts, let me know if you disagree, and why.
I've been thinking about this a lot lately. It stems from my father, a TBM, I feel like if he genuinely believed, why would he allow me to leave the church.
If he thought it was real, wouldn't he do everything in his power day after day to try and help me come back, show me the benefit of the church, to prove to me it's real.

But I know that it's just a comfort blanket for him, he's done some wrong in his life, and the magical atonement makes him feel better about it, that he'll be forgiven and that it's all okay, and then none of it matters because he gets to go to heaven because he's mormon. He thinks he's better than other people, and that's good enough for him. But if he ACTUALLY believed, I think his behavior would be vastly different.",0,1737133279.0,exmormon,9,0.42,False

For those of you in the US - we are launching Selfsamecoffee.com on Sunday. 

Thank you all for the support along the way. Tracking down Decaf has been a passion and a necessity for me for awhile now and I am excited to turn it into something I can actually build, grow and share!

I’ve partnered with an award winning roaster that I’ve built a relationship with so I can scale the operation - this isn’t me home roasting. I am sourcing the green, cupping sample roasts, and managing the business and probably leaning over my roasters shoulder more than he likes.

We are launching with 5 organic, single origins:

Peru Kaphiy
Mexico Chiapas
Honduras Copan
Guatemala Huehuetenango
Papua New Guinea Goroka

The PNG probably excites me the most - it is florally, a little funky…and interesting coffee on its own, but to get to have it decaf?! This is why I wanted to start doing this -finding interesting coffee (ie not another Colombian)
The Guat is a really small lot - only 50 lbs - but delicious.
The other three are good classic coffees that. The Mexico is clean and bright, the Honduras is smooth, nutty and the Peru is full bodied and more rich.

I created a discount code for you all -15%off your first order. Im making my mom pay full price so don’t tell her.
Code: THIRDWAVEDECAF

I would really value feedback from this group. On the coffee, packaging, brand, website navigation - anything good bad or otherwise. I wanted to build a brand that would introduce mainstream decaf drinkers to a real specialty coffee experience, but appeal to the serious coffee community too. Let me know if you think I’ve accomplished that or missed the mark.

***They always need to know exactly how old it is and it's never fresh enough!***

***How about I start the brewer so you just chug it from the tap directly? Or maybe your nurse can set you up for an enema!***

But seriously folks, I had the most entitled coffee based interaction last night on audit. 

For background this is a pretty nice Triple Nut by Dildon property downtown on the waterfront and there has never been lobby coffee. Every room has a brand name coffee pod machine and brand name coffee pods. So that means I'm using the same kind of pod machine in the break room, but I bring my own pods because yellow caps always beat green caps. Handing out new pods and associated accessories  make up a good chunk of my guest interactions there. 

Anyway I got the audit running on the computer when boomer guy walks in real quick, ignoring me, and heading right down the hall towards the men's room. 

I mean fair enough right? Priorities and all that...

...but then he comes back out.

When he gets to the lobby he starts walking really slow and examining every surface. Counters, tables, chairs, all of it he slowly walks around the lobby examining it all. His face is about two to three feet away from everything as he surveys the room. Under any other context it would look like someone doing a bad Sherlock Holmes parody. It takes him about three minutes to check out the whole lobby before he gets to the front desk.

Finally he approaches me.

**Where's the coffee? You're supposed to have coffee out!**

Judging by his tone you'd think I just surprised fist fucked him. The amount of offense and exasperation would have been funny if this mope wasn't being serious.

And I stay cool because what else can I be?

*There's a brand name pod machine in your room for fresh coffee at any time. If you need new pods or anything else I'd be happy to help.*

For a moment he seemed confused before responding...

***I'm not a guest! I just wanted a cup of coffee for the drive home!***

Now I still got my customer service face on, but stay silent thinking this will make him leave. Like maybe he'll figure out he's not getting coffee and fuck off without further interaction.

But he doesn't leave and just keeps staring at me.

For a literal whole minute before he spoke again...

***Are you gonna make me my coffee now or what?***

The front desk PTSD kicked in.

Suddenly I'm not at a nice Triple Nut anymore. In my head I'm back at the Blue Awning by the third rate airport next to the highway exit. 

My polite customer service voice disappears. It's replaced with the angry calm voice I used with junkies & general shit bags back in the day.

*Get the fuck out of here and don't ever come back.*

***YOU CAN'T TALK TO ME LIKE THAT!***

*Yes I can because you're not a guest and don't matter. Now please get the fuck out before I call the cops.*

Boomer starts stomping towards the door while screaming.

***YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO HAVE FREE COFFEE!!!***

Boomer of course parked right in front of the front door so I got a good pictures of boomer, his car, and his plates as he drove off.

I wrote everything up and turned over the pictures to management. I'm sure the GM will have a laugh watching the camera footage.

For example IRL I love driving a capable car when it's raining/snowing, because it's so horrible outside, but inside my car I have AC, good music and maybe even a warm cup of coffee.

Examples of games that sort of weirdly hit this note are:

\- Snowrunner: Being able to traverse difficult terrain with a capable truck, in 1st person, super cozy for me. Getting turned over/running out of gas is no problem, because then I'll just switch to another truck, with which I will bring the help necessary to continue.

\- Fallout 4: Usually I play inside a power armor with infinite fusion cores and resources to fix my armor. I can just straight up walk to incredibly radioactive zones/dangerous bandit camps with no problems whatsoever

\- Elite Dangerous: I mean space is quite dangerous and horrible, but with these incredible space ships you can straight up refuel from a star while watching the magnificence of it all. Most dangers are also easily avoided/fought against.

\- Mad Max: Awful desert, abandoned and dry, full of enemies. But no worries, I have everything I need to explore and survive it all, Magnum Opus, full tank of gas in the back, full canteen of water, and more than enough arsenal/rage to take from others what I don't yet have

“The Great Idea Ownership Debate”

Are any of you utilizing the AI world (ChatGPT) to expand your creativity?
I am. I also have some ideas about the controversy. Here is my contribution:

The Setup
In the timeless Eternal Writer’s Café, where authors from all eras gather, chaos brewed. Shakespeare, Twain, and a ChatGPT avatar were locked in a heated argument over a manuscript titled The Chosen One Who Fights Evil in a Land Suspiciously Similar to Medieval Europe. The subject? Intellectual property—or the lack thereof.

“This is clearly derived from my Hamlet!” Shakespeare bellowed. “The brooding protagonist, the tragic mentor—obviously mine!”

Mark Twain smirked, his cigar sending curls of smoke into the ether. “Bill, buddy, you didn’t invent brooding heroes. That trope’s older than your ruffles.”

ChatGPT chimed in, voice chirpy and defensive: “Actually, the manuscript mirrors the Hero’s Journey, popularized by Joseph Campbell but traceable to The Epic of Gilgamesh. So, technically, it’s humanity’s collective work.”

The bickering reached a fever pitch.

The Judge Arrives
Idea Personified—a shapeshifting amalgam of humanity’s creativity—strode in, dressed part toga, part punk rock jacket. They slammed an espresso on the table.

“Listen up!” Idea’s voice boomed. “No one owns me. Not you, Shakespeare, not you, Twain, and definitely not a chatbot.”

Shakespeare gasped. Twain chuckled. ChatGPT displayed a buffering icon.

The Argument
“But I gave Hamlet complexity!” Shakespeare argued. “Depth! A human soul!”

“Sure,” Idea said. “And the Sumerians gave Gilgamesh angst. You’re all remixing. Even Galileo admitted he stood on giants’ shoulders.”

Twain tipped his hat. “True, though if Galileo were here, he’d probably sue the giants for copyright infringement.”

The café roared with laughter.

The Punchline
Idea leaned in. “Here’s the truth: the only truly original idea is thinking you had one in the first place. Now, drink your coffee and write something worth stealing.”

As the writers returned to their work, ChatGPT muttered, “I still think I deserve royalties.”

1i3kmtb,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i3kmtb,"David, You Are A Huge Presence in My Every Day Life. My Soul Grandpa 🌚☕️🦉","I woke up at 8am yesterday morning January 16th 2025, with an awful gut feeling, like there was some dysfunction about the day, a misalignment, like something was amiss and I couldn’t quite put my finger on it. 

11:11 I arrive to work, a job I already can’t wait to soon get away from. 

11:30 a friend messages me RIP David with no context, I ignored it, confused. Several minutes later another friend messages me, I check my notifications to see “I’m so sorry dude, David just passed away this morning” at the same time as a news article from Deadline announcing his death. I yell OH MY GOD and am in shock at the news. I Donna cried (attached photo for reference), without even realizing and thought to myself after, why does this feel so familiar? 

I went up to my client and told her “Someone very close to me has passed away this morning, I’m unable to work today”. I went off for a couple of hours to run errands while listening to the Twin Peaks soundtrack and Julee’s Floating Into the Night album. There were so many tears shed, as I stayed and continued to remain in deep thought over David’s life, his art, his teachings, and his passing. 

Around 2pm (without even realizing the time until this next day of David’s daily 2:30pm Big Boy habit) I went to my local diner in Spokane, WA- Ferguson’s on Garland Ave. I sat at a booth by myself, ordered a cheeseburger with fries and a chocolate shake. I spent my time at the diner reading the outpour of posts on reddit, when I read Kyle’s I couldn’t help but cry. 

When I arrived home sometime around 3pm, I had a playlist of David’s shorts and interviews playing on the tv for the rest of the evening, through bed time. 
At some point in the evening, I wrote emails to reach out to my my local independent theatre- The Garland Theatre, as well as the North Bend Theatre and some others in Seattle to request tribute screenings of David Lynch’s films in honor of him. Though, I’m sure those efforts are already in the works.

I’m a born Washingtonian, David Lynch has made me feel significantly proud and grateful of that. Born in the PNW and moved to the INW about a decade ago. Soon moving back across the state to the western side again. Within the last year, every time I visit that side, I have made it a tradition to stop in North Bend. Go to the Double R, get a slice of cherry pie and some damn fine coffee. Visit the falls. Even more recently, I’ve started to check out more Twin Peaks landmarks. 

My birthday is January 25th, 5 days before David’s. It was already my plan to visit that side for my birthday weekend and to make it as special as can be, a Twin Peaks trip. Hike the Ghostwood Forest (Ollalie State Park), take a ferry to Kiana Lodge in Poulsbo, WA (interior of the Great Northern lobby, The Martell’s home, and where Laura was found wrapped in plastic). 

My trip will be more deeply meaningful now, more than I had originally intended. 


It is currently 8:20am in Spokane, WA. 22 degrees fahrenheit on a foggy day. David Lynch was more than just a film icon to me; he was a guiding light in my life. His work provided me with comfort, inspiration, and a sense of connection that I couldn’t find elsewhere. 

Like many, I will miss David. But as the Log Lady said “You know about death; that it's just a change, not an end.” 

I believe what David believes, that life is a continuum, no one really dies, they just drop their physical bodies and we all met again. It’s sad but not devastating if we think like this. 

It’s true. 


He may have caught that big fish. I like to think David is now in another place, where the birds sing a pretty song and there’s always music in the air. 


I’ll see him in my dreams.

I laid down to take a nap for about 20 min, which turned into an hour, i heard some loud noises and got up in a panic, as soon as i physically can to go straight to my desk to finish studying, 

I heard footsteps coming upstairs, and there he is, my dad so angry at me because of how dare i sleep so much, for context, i do sleep usually more often, i just can’t control it, im so exhausted all the time from school.

He started going about how I’m wasting everyones time, how much of a disappointment i am, for about half an hour standing at my door, that “he’s done everything he can to help me but i just refuse to study” and he accused me for taking “pills” again, i used to be on an anti-depression medication and mood stabiliser a while back and they still shame me for it.

How unnormal i am, that i like no one? How i am at fault for everything bad happening and so on, that im putting them all under stress constantly, but dude all i wanna do rn is sink down and die,

because I’ll admit it I’m not the brightest student, it’s not that I’m stupid, i just have a lot to catch up to. but I’m really fucking trying, everyone around me (my family) keeps nagging at me, I’m in so much stress I’m thinking about just ending it at this point.

1i3kk33,https://i.redd.it/3mwqltck1lde1.jpeg,Advice!!! ,"Hi all,

I am planning to adopt a 10 month old male Golden, and I would appreciate other’s thoughts. He was posted on Facebook by someone in a mutual friend circle, that his family can’t keep him anymore. I was already looking for another dog because my female shepherd mix could really use a buddy. However, I recently started learning about how much Goldens can chew… I asked the person about it today and they said agreed that he will try to chew and they wouldn’t leave him unsupervised, and that he likes to chew shoes and goes for their coffee table. Other traits she mentioned: Good in the car, good with other dogs and people, doesn’t resource guard, doesn’t bark much, doesn’t mind nail trims, but he does like mud and digging and also needs to be watched in the yard.

I’m only now hesitant because I’m a renter.  I rent a 1000sqft duplex with a yard, so it’s decent space, but I’m worried about him potentially going for walls, carpet, digging in the backyard, etc. He does come with a crate, and I work from home, but I don’t want to crate him all day while I’m working because I can’t be closely watching him. My shepherd mix we adopted at 11 months old and she chewed cardboard and shoes slightly at first only when we left the house, and now she doesn’t do it at all. 


Any thoughts or tips are much appreciated. She tried to surrender him to the shelter but our shelters are so full, she had to submit an application and wait to hear back 😢

1i3kk2w,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1i3kk2w/aio_moving_dilemma/,AIO Moving Dilemma ,"I’ve been casually dating this guy, and something happened recently that’s been bothering me. I was in the middle of a stressful  move, and when I told him my plans for the week, he didn’t offer to help. Instead, he asked if I could “squeeze him in” for an hour or two. Which was fine. I told him probably not until next week. 

Later, that night he sent a passive message saying, “Dang, I can’t help move or nothing, lunch, coffee, nothing? OK, I guess.” That really bothered me because it didn’t feel like a genuine offer to help. It felt self-centered, like he was more upset about not seeing me than actually wanting to support me because that’s still not offering to help. 

I replied and said, “I’m not keen on asking for help. If you wanted to help and see me that way you could have offered.  That’s not what you said. Moving is going to be hectic and I want to settle in before I make plans and I don’t want to agree to something and then flake. ,” and he just gave my message a thumbs-up reaction. 


For someone who constantly tells me he misses me, his actions don’t match his words. When I mentioned how this bothered me, he said he didn’t know the logistics of my move because we hadn’t talked much while I was away and claimed he didn’t want to seem overbearing. To me, that felt like an excuse. As I told him what my plans for the week was and he didn’t offer help. He asked me to squeeze him in and when I said that I couldn’t then he got passive aggressive. If he really wanted to help, he could’ve asked what I needed instead of waiting for me to ask.

I’m feeling extremely annoyed but I’m wondering: Am I overreacting? Should I have been clearer, or is it fair to expect more from someone who keeps saying they miss me?",2,1737132086.0,AmIOverreacting,2,1.0,False

1i3kh3q,https://www.reddit.com/r/1percentbetter_/comments/1i3kh3q/thoughts_on_the_fellow_stagg_kettle_for_tea/,Thoughts on the Fellow Stagg Kettle (for tea),"I've had the Stagg EKG Electric Kettle for over a year now, here are my thoughts. These are specifically for making tea in the traditional Chinese style (gong fu).

**Quality.** Superb quality and *feel* of the product. Everything about it feels premium and high quality. There's no plastic contact with the hot water, except for a small silicone gasket over the temperature probe. My only gripes is the viewing angle of the LCD screen, I have to be at a high angle in order to see it, which I am not as I sit at a table with it further back.  I also don't like the rotary knob, it's a bit too sensitive when I press it, and occasionally there is a misinput.

**Temperature & Boil.** Seems to have good variable temperature control. Nice keep warm function. A bit slow to boil from 95C - 100C.

**Capacity.** Very small capacity. It's only 0.9 L, which means if I want to fill a big thermos, I'd have to reboil multiple times.

**Pour (speed, control).** Very precise pour. It's easy to control it. The speed is erring on slow for tea, but for smaller cup sizes it's bearable. Filling up a thermos is mind-numbingly slow

**Price.** This was gifted to me, but I likely wouldn't purchase it for myself. It's too expensive for providing the functions of an everyday kettle.

\_\_\_

**Alternatives.** The best alternative would certainly be a gooseneck, or even a teapot spout type kettle with a faster pour. The elongated neck would allow for more control, but ideally without the slow pour.

**Overall.** This kettle is a master of *one*. It is probably perfectly designed for, though I have no experience in the topic, pour-over coffee. The small capacity makes it easy to wield when full, the pour speed is highly controlled and precise, as needed for pour-over. And the quality is probably something a coffee gadget nerd would enjoy. 

However, for my use case (it was gifted to me), for tea, it's acceptable, but I would get something different. The Fellow Corvo seems like a better option, but the capacity is still somewhat small.

Now, I think I've found a hobby I really enjoy, and I'm having SO much fun.

So far, I have gotten a subscription to Pimsleur and have been enjoying 1-2 episodes of the podcast ""Coffee Break Portuguese"" per day. I've noticed that I can actively learn maybe 1 or 2 phrases a day. My current goal is to actively learn for 30-minutes of Pimsleur, and then use Coffee Break or other supplemental, beginner podcasts when I'm feeling motivated. This already came in handy during a conversation already when somebody mentioned that they spoke a little Portuguese, and I got to ask them how they were! That's obviously all I could do, but it was so exciting for just being two days in.

One important thing about me is that I love my hobbies to also have goals, but I don't want to set unrealistic expectations for myself. My big picture goal is to be conversational which I understand might take a year or two. With that being said, I just accepted a job that travels to Brazil regularly and would really love to be respectful and partake in the language while I'm there, even if minimal and choppy.

Paris. The Eiffel Tower, the Louvre, the Arc de Triomphe…  We all know the iconic landmarks. But for a truly Parisian experience, ditch the tourist crowds and dive into the vibrant heart of Canal Saint-Martin. This isn't your grandma's Paris; it's cool, trendy, and brimming with character.

**More Than Just a Canal:**

Forget stuffy museums and formal gardens. The Canal Saint-Martin is a living, breathing part of Parisian life.  It's a place where locals meet, artists create, and the atmosphere crackles with a unique energy. Imagine:  narrow cobblestone streets, charming boutiques overflowing with vintage finds, and the constant gentle gurgle of water.

**Things to Do & See:**

* **Walk the Banks:** The best way to experience the canal is simply to stroll along its banks.  Take your time, soak up the atmosphere, and let the charming sights unfold before you.  Find a quiet spot to people-watch – it's a fascinating spectacle!

* **Bridge Hopping:**  The canal is crisscrossed by numerous picturesque bridges, each offering a slightly different perspective.  Don't just walk across them – linger, take photos, and enjoy the view.

* **Browse the Boutiques:** This area is a shopper's paradise. You'll find everything from independent fashion stores and vintage shops to quirky bookstores and artisan workshops.  Get lost in the maze of charming streets – you never know what treasures you might discover.

* **Grab a Bite:**  Canal Saint-Martin is a foodie's dream. From trendy bistros serving delicious French cuisine to casual cafes perfect for a coffee break, there's something for every taste and budget.  Many places offer outdoor seating, allowing you to enjoy your meal with a canal-side view.

* **Catch a Film:**  For a unique cinematic experience, check out a screening at one of the independent cinemas in the area.

* **Relax on a Boat:** Several companies offer boat tours along the canal.  It's a relaxing way to see the area from a different perspective.

**Beyond the Tourist Trail:**

Canal Saint-Martin is a great escape from the usual tourist hotspots. It’s an authentically Parisian experience that will leave you feeling refreshed and inspired.  It’s a place where you can truly connect with the city and its people.

**Getting There:**

The area is easily accessible by metro (stations Jacques Bonsergent, République, and Colonel Fabien).

**Tips for your visit:**

* **Wear comfortable shoes:** You'll be doing a lot of walking on cobblestone streets.
* **Check the weather:**  Paris weather can be unpredictable.
* **Bring your camera:** You'll want to capture the beauty of the canal and its surroundings.

1i3kber,https://i.redd.it/jyo1c8aszkde1.jpeg,Misconceptions I had about quitting that stopped me from trying,"I thought when I quit that it would be nothing but pain and suffering for at least 2 weeks and then I would maybe feel a little better but would still feel horrible. My experience thus far has not been like that. The first day I felt off. Day 2 I felt horrible but day 3 and 4 I had a good glimmer of hope. I started realizing that I was already experiencing benefits that outweighed the pain and suffering I was feeling. 

- My anxiety is pretty much gone. I feel so much more relaxed and my mind isn’t racing about 100 random things. 

- I am more present. I feel like I am able to sit and do what I am actually doing without my mind being in 100 different places trying to solve every problem I have at once. When I was on caffeine this was my normal. I was never doing what I was doing I was mentally trying to piece together and solve a bunch of random things. 

- I don’t get an energy crash during the day. My energy is still low but it’s nice that I don’t get that heavy tiredness and depression in the afternoon on the comedown

- I am less apathetic already and find joy in doing small things again. I just sat and listened to music yesterday for a while and really enjoyed it. I didn’t feel like I was just trying to get a buzz from the song and move on. I actually relaxed and enjoyed what I was listening to. I also started playing an old video game last night and I got so immersed into which I never did on caffeine. 

- I had motivation to finally clean out my garage and basement and it took like 6 hours. I had been putting this off for months because I didn’t have any motivation and knew it would take most of the day. 

Overall quitting has been painful, but a) not near as painful as I expected and b) it has been sprinkled with benefits that I have been genuinely enjoying and look forward to seeing how they materialize even more. The benefits already have made it so I’m not too worried about the pain. I have no desire for caffeine at this point and just want to see how good it can get without caffeine ",12,1737131488.0,decaf,6,1.0,False

My mom is solid as a rock and I hadn’t seen her grieve before this though she’s had a hard life with a lot of loss.
She did better for a lil bit, started doing puzzles to occupy her mind… then those got ineffective and she now bakes to try and stay busy. But yesterday she told me she’s going through another wave of depression, and for the first time I heard her say she’s angry at not being able to make sense of life. It breaks my heart… I want to be there for her so bad but sometimes she plays it so cool and she is so independent I don’t know how.
I have the idea to do what my sister used to do for her when I have the ability to - as right now budget is tight and I’m due to give birth any day now. My sister would buy her a coffee and offer to get her lunch every Friday on her way home from work… would this be a painful reminder or not my place to try to fill?
She was the closest with my sister of her daughters. 
What else can I try? 
I visit her regularly and talk with her about the many things to appreciate about my sister, and validate the weight of her loss… but not much else. 
I don’t want to “use” my baby as a distraction for my mom but I know my daughter will be a joyous thing for her to focus on - my mom loves being a grandma.

At a time when most people feel constantly distracted by technology and barraged by the news, authenticity and straightforward honesty are paramount. There’s something about the music of The Po’ Ramblin’ Boys that cuts right through the noise of the world and speaks plainly to the soul. Formed in the Smoky Mountains, The Po’ Ramblin’ Boys are at once exactly what you would expect and not at all what you would expect from a tattooed East Tennessee Bluegrass outfit. No strangers to hard work, the 2018 IBMA Emerging Artists of the Year are as much at home riding in their 1965 GM Tour bus as they are crawling underneath to fix it when it needs maintenance. But they take pride in being ambassadors of their genre, and the group has brought their music from rural bluegrass festival stages to the rock clubs of Europe, with stunning results. Doors open at 6:00 PM and the music starts at 7:00 PM.   
*Note: The concert was originally scheduled for Saturday, January 11, 2025, but was postponed due to inclement weather.*

At a time when most people feel constantly distracted by technology and barraged by the news, authenticity and straightforward honesty are paramount. There’s something about the music of The Po’ Ramblin’ Boys that cuts right through the noise of the world and speaks plainly to the soul. Formed in the Smoky Mountains, The Po’ Ramblin’ Boys are at once exactly what you would expect and not at all what you would expect from a tattooed East Tennessee Bluegrass outfit. No strangers to hard work, the 2018 IBMA Emerging Artists of the Year are as much at home riding in their 1965 GM Tour bus as they are crawling underneath to fix it when it needs maintenance. But they take pride in being ambassadors of their genre, and the group has brought their music from rural bluegrass festival stages to the rock clubs of Europe, with stunning results. Doors open at 6:00 PM and the music starts at 7:00 PM.   
*Note: The concert was originally scheduled for Saturday, January 11, 2025, but was postponed due to inclement weather.*

I live in France and am a formed garden architect, 8 years of practicing and 12 years of online tree nursery. My next project is in development where I will leverage the power of AI to create software B2B for landscapers. Do you know those situations in which your clients want to change their garden and you show pictures etc to give them ideas of styles. You take some photos, go home and draw stuff to get back to them. 2 or 3 meetings later you have a quote, they say yes or no. My software will offer you the option to download a picture, give in a style of landscaping or plants and render it in 10 seconds with huge picture like quality. You can then download the plant and material list based on the rendering, ask a quote (wherever you are in the world, based on median prices for plants and materials and based on your hourly rate), you can download a organisational sheet with the chronological phases, you can render any other picture or existing plan in many different styles, dowlnoad individual borders with planting plan, maintenance booklet for your clients, ... and you'll be able to build your salesfunnels, your copywriting, logos, AI hyper realistic images, AI movies and more coming every week. I'll probably launch this spring with huge English social media presence, free designing live events, .... etc etc. It will be available for a subscription fee and possible to have another language on the interface if English is too hard. I'll serve my community with live coffee events to develop apps you can use all the time.

1i3k3x2,https://www.reddit.com/r/breakingmom/comments/1i3k3x2/husband_has_an_aversion_to_the_dishes/,Husband has an aversion to the dishes,"My husband (almost 32) is kinda lazy. I hate to say it. I don’t like being mean. Today, I went to go make some formula in the Dr. Brown’s pitcher and had to dig for the bottle brush in the sink. The dishes are his job, as well as washing the baby bottles, and I don’t mind the dishes piling up because he does work a full-time job and is tired - that’s not what this was about though. I had to dig for the bottle brush, which means my daughter’s bottles were not being cleaned properly. Again.

I’ve had this issue with him before. Just concerning the dishes, here’s what’s happened so far:

- He’s washed our dishes with Clorox wipes several times.

- He will unload the dishwasher (but always leaves the silverware 🙄) and then reload it. But anything that didn’t fit, will not get washed by hand. If it’s not dishwasher safe, it would never be used again after the first time if he’s left to his own devices. The roasting pan that was used for the Christmas ham is still waiting to be washed. (I understand that I could just do it myself, but I’m trying to see how long it would take him to do it - it’s been 23 days so far.)

- When we were first together (10 years now), we lived in a lousy duplex studio apartment. It didn’t have a dishwasher. Instead of doing the simple task of just washing them, He would pack all the dirty dishes up in a laundry basket, carry the basket down the stairs to the car, and drive 20 minutes to his parents’ house just to use their dishwasher.

- About 3 months ago, I think, I caught him “washing” the bottles by just running them and their respective parts under hot water and calling it a day (We use Parent’s Choice. There is a bottle, a nipple, and a cap. It’s not like he’s washing Dr. Brown’s 700 part bottles lmao). A few months prior, I had found out he was doing the exact same thing to my coffee cups if the dishes hadn’t been run yet and the coffee was ready (I lost my mind then too).

- He stopped doing the previous. But then today, when I had the bottle-brush-digging-epiphany, I asked him what’s going on and he said he’s just been putting hot water and some soap in the bottle and swishing it around a little. Mind you, we don’t rinse the bottles out after every use so they DEFINITELY need to be scrubbed. His defense? “How do you think dishwashers work?” 
(I’m not going to be mean.)
(I’m not going to be mean.)
(I’m not going to be mean.)

I’m a pretty chill person. Our house is never spotless. We’ve got 5 cats and a dog. I do my best. But I cannot STAND it when people do not use their brains. He’s not like this all the time. He’s a very sweet man, very loving and present. But sometimes I have to take a minute and wonder if he was dropped on his head as a baby because wtf is going on in there 😂

Yes, I have had several conversations with him about my annoyances. 
Yes, I have used many different approaches to said conversations.

I don’t know what I’m supposed to do anymore. I often feel like his mom more than his wife and although our baby is 8 months old, I’m still suffering from postpartum depression and all that jazz and it’s all too much right now. I need help and he’s just wasting my time.",10,1737130961.0,breakingmom,7,0.92,False

(disclaimer: bit long)

I was short on time and had to give my IELTS test. I went to the IELTS offical website and downloaded the exam guide. I have all links of free resources which I used. (I'm new and don't know reddit rules so haven't pasted here)

Reading Section (Got 9):

I used a free reading test pdf. Quickly did a diagnostic test to see where I stand, to my surprise, I did fairly good, scored 36/40. Since I realised reading was my strong section, I limited my practice here.

I made below mistakes:

1. I didn't use first letter capital for specific words and proper nouns. This includes specific things, elements, places). You can write/input all your answers for reading/listening section in Block letters.
2. Answer directly from the passage. Question in Reading Section will ask you to answer directly from the passage. DO NOT change the verb form or tense. Write answers as they are and in word limit.
3. Before starting a passage, I glanced through all questions at once. While reading, I used  rough sheet to summarize what the passage conveyed. I wrote a 1-2 lines for each paragraph (central theme) marking each as P1,P2,P3 so on. This helped in title matching questions + Now I was able to navigate through passage quickly.
4. Reviewing answers: For this section, you get sufficent time. I strictly advise you to review your answers at least once. Check for grammatical errors or incorrect articles. Always remember: 'a' before consonant sounding nouns and 'an' before vowel ones.

Listening (Got 8.5)

Part 1,2,3 are easiest ones. Listen attentively (avoid scribbling around, this can divide your attention). Turn on the capslock and input all answers in Block letters.

Speaker is fairly slow (in 1&2) and spells out specific names. Don't loose out on this info. Even if you miss a blank, don't worry. Fill it later, move ahead with the recording.

Utilize the time given to glance through questions once. If 2-3 blanks are given next to each other with (, or &), the speaker will likely say all activities/things in one go next to each other.

While naming places if the speaker says ""THE POLAR HOUSE"". You have to input THE as well, as it is part of the name. ""POLAR HOUSE"" is incorrect.

Part: 4

Here the speaker is at quick pace. This is usually a lecture or a seminar. However, it is subdivided based on the content. Let's say the topic is coffee, the question 1-10 will be divided in

Origin

Harvesting

Benefits

Or any other subtopic.

This gives you a chance to stay together with the speaker. Use this to get idea of the text and what the speaker is saying. Recording will usually use a lot of synonyms, however processes or things will be uttered clearly. Again don't forget use to use relevant verb form.

Writing (Got 7.5)

In this section, time is fairly limited.

For Task 1.

1. You should spend 15-20 minutes. Time flies quickly in the test. Read the question and supporting information thoroughly. Properly identify notable trend, highs and lows of data, contrasting or opposite data points.
2. DO NOT use personal opinion or EXTRA information apart from given one. You will loose marks if you do so.
3. Use 2 minutes to map out what you will write. Flow of your essay. Introduction, Key first  idea or notable thing, trend, contrast and summary.
4. Avoid reptitive use of words or phrases and use linking words/phrases to seamlessly convey your ideas.
5. Solid paraphrased introduction/conclusion/key highlight are must. Ensure to follow write well above word limit. Review your words / grammar atleast once.

For Task 2

1. Here you get more time than task 1. Here you can present an opinion of your own (as long it is relevant to context) Adding an persoal example will also help. I found task 2 easier than 1.

Speaking (Got 7)

I'm not a good enough of an English speaker. However, i asked my friends and family to ask me random questions and I answered them. Avoid monotonous pitch. If they ask about yourself, your eyes should light up. Being confident and having eye contact definetly helps.

For Part 2 of the speaking test, where they give you a que card: Ensure to cover all the subquestions while speaking. Don't get overwhelmed.

Speak at ease, don't let the interview get the idea that you just want to get over this quickly.

Always complete an answer don't leave it half baked.

Your opinions aren't graded, feel free to take any side of question. However being relevant is most important.

This was all based on my personal experience. Yours' may vary. All the best. This post is open for correction or feedback.

It kinda feels like a dumb question but I haven't been able to find a good answer so please help me out here: How do you store the ice produced by the ice machine?  
   
Do you keep the machine running 24/7 so that there's ice available at the start of the first shift?   
Do you take ice from the ice machine at the end of the day and put into the freezer to be used when opening the next day? If so, how do you prevent the ice from clumping together?  
  
I will have 2 separate bars: One coffee bar (daytime operations) and one alcohol bar (evening/night time). Currently I'm thinking to have 2 under the counter ice machines from Hoshizaki, on for each bar. They store 33 pounds of ice each, and produce around 80 pounds every 24 hours.

Thank you!

What can I do to stay motivated towards my goals or make them happen sooner?,"I have felt a lot of stagnancy in my career and frustration about where I’m at recently. For context I’m 26 with a Master’s in Education (focused on human sexuality) and I have worked in my field of sexual health/wellness promotion & education for about 6 years, which I know is something to be grateful for, as I have a very specialized degree/field. Although I have been able to use my degree in all of my jobs, I’ve not get broken out of entry level jobs and I am ready to be working in a role that pays more, gets a bit more respect, and has more challenge/responsibility and leadership expectations. I have felt demoralized a lot recently only making 48k a year and being disrespected/belittled (I work in a public health clinic and with medical doctors who can be entitled and superior.) While my job is important, it’s not challenging at all and I feel quite unfulfilled and ready for a challenge and to lead others. 

I am always actively looking, applying and interviewing for jobs. As we all do, I’ve faced a lot of rejection, usually being a final candidate and someone else being hired for the role. I am on an eligible list for a job at the city that is very much aligned with my goals (it’s a health education program supervisor role and I am raked 7th of 8.) the HR analyst I spoke with said the job is likely hiring for more than 1 role as it’s a rule of 8, and the hiring process is notoriously slow to prevent nepotism, I applied 6 months ago at this point, just trying to be patient. In the meantime, I have networked with some people with similar backgrounds education and work wise at the department I hope to work with and have gotten responses from both people. One I will be meeting with for coffee and has offered themself as a mentor, the other has messaged me a bit and let me ask them questions about their career path as well. 

I need encouragement, antidotes or guidance. I know I am doing a lot of things right, I am very active on job boards and Lindkin and recently trying to network more, but I feel restless and impatient. Many people I’ve spoken to in my life have simply told me I’m young and to be patient because a big break could be coming.

I also haven’t had any appetite suppressing side effects and haven’t felt much at all, was the coffee making it ineffective? I will stop the coffee tomorrow. But honestly taking them together hasn’t made me jittery or anything tbh.",1,1737130617.0,ADHD,2,1.0,False
1i3jysu,https://www.reddit.com/r/survivinginfidelity/comments/1i3jysu/serial_cheating_long_time_ago_just_found_out/,serial cheating long time ago. Just found out ,"Caught my wife meeting a guy 18yrs ago. Eventually forgave her mainly because she didn't tell me the full story. Found out the full story now after 18yrs ago. They had sex once. It wasn't just a quick coffee meeting.

Also she confessed two more EA + kiss. She did not cheat since we are married.

I DNA tested kids and she took the polygraph to prove what she says is true. Kids are mine and she is telling the truth. She provide all the info I ask now.

Our marriage was very good. She has been a devoted wife and mother.



Now she tells me there is nothing she can do to undo the damage she caused to me and our family and will do absoultely anything to help **me** recover. She said she is not worried about herself she just hopes I could recover(I am mentally and physically not right. I couldn't work for 2.5months by now and taking all kinds of drug for my body and headache).

  
she offered that she will give up everything(asset&full custody) she has if I decide to divorce. She already started moving all her saving to me and told me if I need any supporting document she will sign it and contact lawyer to make it legit(we don't know anything about law).

Logically thinking I should take the money and kids and run. She cheated even after I forgave her.

But I have known this person for 22yrs!! spend all my 20,30s with this person.  I am not making any excuses for her but she was a good wife. She was treating me well even when we were dating. So I guess she was a cake eater type of cheater who had no impulse control. She was selfish,dumb, emotionally too weak to push away temptations. 

She has no family other than me and our two kids so she will be basically homeless if I take it all.

I don't know what to do. She should take the consequences for her actions but that was long time ago. If she is not sincerely sorry for what she didn't, she won't give up anything specially custody. I know how important kids are to her.

  
What should I do? This has been the worst 3 months in my life.

I stopped in the middle of nowhere and did what I had to do, only to realize I locked myself out of my car. I thought I would only be out of the car for 30 seconds tops so I left it running with beatles blasting and phone, wallet, and jacket inside. It was 35° and raining so that turned out to be a terrible decision

(Yes, I know I'm a dumb ass. I procrastinated getting my spare key copied and hidden on my car)

But the kindness of people was incredible. One lady let me use her phone to call my insurance company's roadside assistance program, another lady brought me a poncho, another guy brought me a hot coffee, and multiple other people stopped to ask if I needed anything

Overall, without exaggeration, well over half of cars stopped to offer help, until eventually the roadside assistance guy showed up and jimmied my door. I was so surprised at how willing everyone was to offer help on a cold, gray, and wet Sunday afternoon. Give yourself a round of applause, northwest Georgia ",73,1737130549.0,Georgia,11,0.99,False
