I've had more than one person get frustrated with me and tell me long after the fact that they were interested, but I was too self conscious + oblivious to do anything about it

Recently bumped into someone I knew 10+ years ago at a book club and the tl;dr is that she asked for my number afterwards, I asked her out for coffee, and we made plans to hang out again this weekend.

I know it's still early on and I still have 0 clue if she is interested in anything non-platonic, but I don't want to potentially miss out on an opportunity by being too reserved and not ""making a move"" after the next few hangouts, assuming things go well. Esp. considering we are both very socially awkward and reserved, and she mentioned panicking after asking for my number lol.

Wondering if people had any tips on how to express interest in a non creepy way when getting to know someone, or particular things that have worked for them, be it subtle flirting, being direct and expressing explicit interest, etc. And similarly any advice on what not to do is always also appreciated, haha

I love consuming unhealthy amounts of coffee, energy drinks, sodas, and some teas!

I love breathing air, drinking fluids (especially if its caffeine), sleeping on beds, and eating foods!

1pv52kw,https://www.reddit.com/r/vancouverdating/comments/1pv52kw/vancouver_splitting_apart/,Vancouver splitting apart...,"About me: I came to Canada 10 years ago after growing up in \~10 countries. I was born in Nepal and then moved to Malaysia, Indonesia, Germany, Austria, Taiwan, Israel, S. Korea, Mexico, and Costa Rica, so I've been all over the globe. My parents are government workers, and I got the best of education, skills, culture and social group. I did a double master's, published research papers, scored 760 in GMAT (99th percentile), 110/120 on TOEFL, 139 on the IQ scale, to name a few feathers in my cap. I have worked extremely hard in my life and secured scholarships for most of my studies.



Situation back in 2015: When I moved to Vancouver in 2015, I could get dates on apps, in clubs, or through cold approaches. I found it easy to make friends from all nationalities. There was some racism, but it was hidden underneath. I could easily integrate with 98% of the society, and I've had coffees/lunches with 500+ people outside of work easily. I saw a lot of white couples breaking up, though, but the society was still intact. Occasionally, I heard racist comments, but I chose to ignore them. I paid 200k in taxes and regularly donated to the SPCA, Church, Gurdwara and online campaigns.



Situation now in 2025: Now the situation of this country is 10x more terrible. Men and women don't date (whites). On the bus, the seat beside me is often empty while others are fully taken. What's worse is that the people standing choose to sit when one of the seats gets vacant, while the one next to me still hasn't been taken. I have observed it for a couple of years, so these are not mistakes or overthinking. Today something broke my heart. I was at Loblaws and a white woman (in her 30's) was shopping in front of me on my right side, so we were facing each other. Then she came right in front, where brussels sprouts were kept, picked up a plastic bag, went to another location in the store to get brussels sprouts (yes, I checked as I've seen these things many times with other women as well). She couldn't even stand f2f with me with a gap of 2 meters!



Spiritually: I have been too deep into spirituality for the past 7 years. I've read countless books, attended meditation camps, donate regularly, and meditate for 2-3 hours daily. What I've learned is that our inner energy manifests outside. I didn't know the people who showed racism towards me; how they have been behaving is what they have on their inside. This inner energy has always manifested in Canada in the past as breakups, anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues. Now, it has become even more severe in the last couple of years. The society is splitting apart, whites aren't dating, people are having a hard time making friends, and there is a sharp increase in racism towards brown people, just to name a few issues here in Vancouver. What sort of society are we creating for us and our children? Thoughts?",1,1766636325.0,vancouverdating,0,1.0,False

Matched on Tinder. Conversation was normal. Light banter. No red flags. She suggests coffee. Perfect. Public. Low commitment. I think, “Great, worst case I drink caffeine and leave.”

I show up a few minutes early. She walks in, looks exactly like her photos. So far, so good.

We order. Sit down.

She says, “I’m really glad you agreed to meet. I don’t usually connect with people.”

That sentence should have warned me. It did not.

She asks what I am looking for. I say something safe. Casual, see where it goes, normal human response.

She nods and immediately says, “Okay, so my last relationship ended because he cheated with my cousin, and then my best friend stopped talking to me, and my therapist says I need to be more open.”

This is minute four.

I am holding my coffee like it is a stress ball. I say, “Oh wow, that’s rough.”

She takes this as permission.

I now know about her childhood, her parents’ divorce, her attachment style, and why men from southwestern Ontario cannot be trusted. She references astrology at least twice. I do not know my sign and at this point I am afraid to ask.

She asks me, “Do you believe people are inherently good?”

I say, “Depends on the person.”

She says, “That’s interesting,” and writes something in her phone. I do not know what that means.

At some point she asks if I want kids. I say maybe someday. She says she wants three but not with someone who has “avoidant tendencies.”

I have known her for twenty minutes.

The barista checks on us. She says, “We’re having a really deep conversation.”

The barista looks at me like I am being held hostage.

Finally, she says, “I feel like we have a connection.”

I panic and say, “I think we get along, but I’m not sure we’re on the same page.”

She nods, smiles, and says, “Yeah, I felt that too.”

She then asks if we can still follow each other on Instagram to “see where life takes us.”

I say sure because I am weak.

She hugs me. It is long. Too long. I leave.

An hour later she messages me, “I think you’re emotionally unavailable, but I wish you healing.”

I did not ask for healing.

1pv4sqo,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1pv4sqo/suggestion_for_keeping_myself_distracted_from/,"Suggestion for keeping myself distracted from drinking and still being ""myself""","Hello Everyone,

Sorry, I am new here, so not quite sure about all the rules and everything, but I was wondering if folk had suggestions about keeping myself distracted from drinking, and also still feeling myself.

I have attended a one-on-one alcohol help centre for about a year and half-ish, they were incredibly useful and I would highly recommend them to anyone; however I have been signed off by them and would like some suggestions.

My drinking amount has lowered from 20 bottles a day to 10 cans a day to now only 3 cans max on certain days from 2020-2025. It was a rough journey but I am quite happy with my progress (and the help centre was also very happy with my progress), but I often still feel a bit empty without it. I have currently been hammering back decaf coffee on my non drinking days, however even with this I often feel I am a very boring/empty without it.

The big fear of being boring/empty does bring a decent amount of anxiety and stress to the whole experience, however I am lucky to have a very supportive friend group. I would love to hear other people's experiences and how they have dealt with these feelings, plus any recommendations on what would be another good distraction for my mind from drinking.\*(I find it quite difficult to speak about me feeling like a bore, I also find myself a bore during these times)

I do find and appreciate drinking is a strong part of my culture, so it's not something I want to stop, however I want to have a control of ""when I want to drink"", instead of ""drink controlling when I do things"" (this was explained to my help centre when I originally started with them). I feel I have a decent control over it now, cravings are no longer animalistic, just more a ""it would be a nice end to the day if I finished it with a drink""

I apologise if this is a bit all over the place, it's just been a lot of mixed feelings and ideas about the whole thing for a long time. It is very likely I will add more, this just seemed the most concise description of it, I apologise if it ain't.

I would greatly appreciate any suggestion or recommendations or anything really.

My current drink schedule:

Mon: 0

Tue: 2-3 (cans/ bottles)\*

Wed: 0

Thu: 0

Fri: 3 (cans/bottles)\*

Sat: 3 (cans/bottles)\*

Sun: 3 (cans/bottles)\*

\*These are beer (this is the max I am allowed, not the stated amount I need to have), I have avoided anything stronger in 99% of cases, only really having wine on special occasions (birthdays etc)

  
edit- I do understand that this schedule might not be very impressive compared to most peoples' lack of drinking, but I promise this is something that took a long time to achieve and it is still a work in progress. 

I hope you all have an amazing Christmas and New year :)

1pv4raz,https://www.reddit.com/r/windowsapps/comments/1pv4raz/starter_application_launcher_tame_your_windows/,Starter Application Launcher – tame your Windows startup,"**The problem**  
As a freelancer juggling multiple projects, every boot meant re-remembering and launching a pile of apps/tasks. One day we had three power outages in 15 minutes and I had to reopen everything over and over—super annoying. Scripts weren’t user-friendly, so I built a small app to automate my Windows startup.

**The solution**  
Manage a personalized **startup pack**: list the apps/links you want to auto-launch at boot. Your routine becomes: power on → grab a coffee → come back to a ready-to-work desktop.

  


# Install & get started

**Download**

* Installer: `StarterAppLauncher-Setup-1.0.0-beta.exe`
* Release: [https://github.com/quanntdev/starter-application/releases/tag/v1.0.0-beta.3](https://github.com/quanntdev/starter-application/releases/tag/v1.0.0-beta.3)
* Source (public): [https://github.com/quanntdev/starter-application](https://github.com/quanntdev/starter-application)

**Install**

1. Run the installer (it creates a shortcut).
2. **Note**: This is a free Beta build and doesn’t include a code-signing certificate yet. Windows SmartScreen may show “Windows protected your PC.” If you **trust this installer**, choose **More info → Run anyway** to proceed. (The stable release will be fully signed.)

**First-time setup**

1. Launch the app → enter your **email** (this marks you as a beta tester; you’ll get priority access and lifetime free use for new features).
2. Open the **Application** tab → pick the apps you want at startup → **Add to Favorite**.
3. Go to **Favorite** to review your list.
   * Supports launching **apps** and **browser + links**.
   * For browsers, you can **add multiple URLs** (e.g., open Chrome with an extra [`facebook.com`](http://facebook.com) tab at boot).
4. Open **Settings** to configure **launch delays** between apps.
5. In **Admin Settings** (Menu), **enable the startup trigger** so launches run automatically after boot (important).

From now on, whenever you start your PC, everything in **Favorite** will auto-launch in the sequence you set.

  


# Roadmap & feedback

* I’m adding more **built-in tools** under the **Tools** section soon.
* Please **try it and share feedback**. If you have an idea for a new tool, drop a comment—I’ll explore and build it if it fits. Thanks!",1,1766635209.0,windowsapps,1,1.0,False

A couple of months ago, I was cleaning in one department where a clerk and a nurse were talking and joking around. Out of nowhere, the nurse pulled me into their conversation and made me agree to something without me even knowing what it was.

The clerk looked shocked, and the nurse leaned over and whispered in my ear, “Hey dude, she wants you. She has a crush grab her number.” The clerk overheard and asked what he said. I quickly brushed it off and told her, “Oh, don’t worry about it, he was just saying you’re a good worker,” kind of teasing her in a light, friendly way.
After that, she came up to me and we started talking just getting to know each other, what I do, things like that. She’s really sweet and has a really nice smile. We hit it off pretty well, and after that, I’d say hi to her whenever I passed her in the hallway.

A couple of weeks ago, I wasn’t feeling well and ended up being gone for about two weeks while I was assigned to her department. Then today, out of nowhere, I ran into her again.

A couple of months ago, I was cleaning in one department where a clerk and a nurse were talking and joking around. Out of nowhere, the nurse pulled me into their conversation and made me agree to something without me even knowing what it was.

The clerk looked shocked, and the nurse leaned over and whispered in my ear, “Hey dude, she wants you. She has a crush grab her number.” The clerk overheard and asked what he said. I quickly brushed it off and told her, “Oh, don’t worry about it, he was just saying you’re a good worker,” kind of teasing her in a light, friendly way.
After that, she came up to me and we started talking just getting to know each other, what I do, things like that. She’s really sweet and has a really nice smile. We hit it off pretty well, and after that, I’d say hi to her whenever I passed her in the hallway.

A couple of weeks ago, I wasn’t feeling well and ended up being gone for about two weeks while I was assigned to her department. Then today, out of nowhere, I ran into her again. At first, I didn’t even recognize her because she had different hair and was wearing glasses. She was just smiling at me without saying anything, and I remember thinking, Who is that?

1. He inherited his family home after his father died unexpectedly a little over a year ago. Unfortunately, due to his father’s physical and mental health the home is not in great shape. The whole place smells, the bathroom was partially renovated but never finished and so there is missing or peeling tile, unfinished walls etc. The floor in the main hallway was either torn up and not replaced, or so worn down and rotted that it is about 6in lower than it should be. Son wants to fix it up but struggles with motivation and direction.

2. He’s very outgoing but doesn’t have any super close friends. Just lots of acquaintances from work or his church. I think he would like something that forces him to get out of the house and socialize with people, especially if it is routinely with the same group of people where he could make some friends.

He’s physically pretty active, enjoys playing basketball during the warmer months and has some acquaintances he hangs out with through playing. Likes board games, coffee, and camping. He’s pretty open and willing to trying lots of different things, but struggles to stay committed to anything where he would have to leave the house on his own. 

I’m willing to go with him to some activity / experience gifts, but have an irregular schedule so wouldn’t be able to consistently accompany him to something with a set schedule, and like I said he doesn’t have other friends or family to reach out to to fill my place, and likely wouldn’t reliably go on his own. There aren’t any obvious ‘things’ that he needs, he’s slowly still trying to sort through his father’s things that came with the house.

I was debating about things like a cleaning service, but some areas of the house are in such disrepair that I’m not sure any reputable service would be willing to try to clean considering the existing damage or risk of further damage. A gift card to Lowe’s / Home Depot won’t do anything to help his motivation to take action. So I’m at a loss of anything meaningful or helpful that won’t feel like an insult, chore, or burden.

1pv4kt3,https://www.reddit.com/r/asianamerican/comments/1pv4kt3/asian_womens_rant_on_corporate/,Asian women's rant on corporate,"Originally posted on subreddit womenintech, was recommended to post here. Tried to once but it was auto removed due to including subreddit link. Trying again. 

I don't work in tech but I do work in a black and white, right or wrong, type job/industry and I need to pay attention to details. I can't find a better subreddit for my rants than this one and I think women who work in tech might relate.

I have a whole bunch of thoughts and frustrations with seeking a corporate career that's more based on logic and facts than humanities, and no idea where to even begin so in no particular order:

1. Does anyone notice there's a lot of scrutiny, nosiness, and shitty office politics on if women in corporate are in relationships or not? I've sensed it since elementary, but it really took of from high school and onwards. People (both genders) where I live snoop around on your social media for 5+ years to guess who your exes are, or how you feel about relationships, and they try to sneak into being your boyfriend. Like they'll try to get close to you, then kiss you or make out with you out of the blue, and then say you're officially dating now. Or they'll say when you went out for a coffee the other month was a date and you're officially dating now. Or they'll tell other people that you're officially dating even if you're not and get super angry at you if you disagree with it, and by that time everyone thinks you're in love so if you say you're not, people are angry at you instead of him and make you out to be the bad girl, the coldhearted bitch etc.

For some reason it feels like all the men in my area (regardless of race) are desperate and all want girlfriends. A lot of them are aggressive and manipulative about it.

I feel like a female student or worker is always hollowed out, has every sexual/romantic detail squeezed out of her and pried into, and has men running laps around her with tricking her into a relationship, not etc.

In my experience I've dealt with A LOT of office politics on this. I wasn't attracted to most of the men who gave me this bullshit but I have to use all sorts of office politics/tricks myself, to avoid being trapped in a relationship with them.

2) A fair amount of women in my area face this, regardless of if they're attractive or not. Although people assume it's more likely to happen if you're attractive. It's hard to talk about it bc ppl get jealous and say 'oh thats only an attractive womens problems' but I swear it's just my area.

3) I swear a lot of my female classmates and colleagues got into relationships due to this. I want to warn them about the aggressive nature of men but I couldn't. A lot of them don't see it and see men through rose tinted glasses. I feel like I'm going crazy because I'm the only one that sees just how aggressive, manipulative, awful etc, the men are about it. Whereas everyone else seems to think men are nice gentlemen or something. Maybe it's because I've had more experiences with men like this I've been able to spot the pattern.

4) A lot of interracial relationships happen this way. The non-asian men have 0 sense of boundaries or af wanting to date asian and go full in on the manipulation and stuff. I have lots of af classmates and colleagues who married super early (in university) and have had kids already, with various non-asian men.

I feel like they got trapped down wayy too quickly to even think or reflect on it.

I don't relate to them when we catch up, nor their divorces or single motherhood (I also know many in this position).

5) It feels like as a women, (especially an asian women) you NEED to have a boyfriend bare minimum in order to reflect all this bullshit you'll encounter from high school onwards. I have some asian female friends who felt the same way, and they sought out asian guys to be their bf just so the asian guy can help them fend of all these unwanted stuff or they can say ""sorry, I have a boyfriend"" and no, despite stereotypes us asian women don't all want to date non-asian men.

I don't feel like a relationship with an asian guy is 10/10 or solves all my life's problems or is the best thing on earth, cause relationships are work. It's not the best thing, but even this mid-ground thing, is far FAR preferable for me, than a relationship with a non-asian guy.

6) I know a lot of asian women who have survived studying or working in corporate but they always had string after string of boyfriends (usually asian if they were woke) to deflect against bullshit. It doesn't always help, but it does help a bit. I've fallen into doing this and have an asian boyfriend who I do use to avoid bullshit with the ""I have a boyfriend"" thing. But a part of me hates it because I just wanted to graduate, get a job, work for 2-3 years minimum, save money, have an emergency fund, work on myself etc, and didn't want to even think about dating until after that point. I would've been happy to do that. Except I dealt with non-stop bullshit so I had to get a boyfriend quickly and a part of me feels like what should've been my youth was robbed from me. What should've been a carefree time I could focus on myself and not worry about men was robbed from me and many other young asian girls.

I had to mature quickly, realize how aggressive men were, and put in effort (I do put in effort) to get a boyfriend myself to deflect against the other men.

At this point I feel like all women working in corporate must be prepared to hunt for a decent guy who will help you avoid all the BS from other men otherwise there's no real career bc its just getting tricked into abusive relationship after abusive relationship.

I (28F) have an aunt (45+) who is going through a tough time and I don’t know how to move forward. We have been close most of my life despite living states apart. In some regards she raised me, and gave me a lot of support over the years. However, this is not the first time something major has happened and I feel as though my actions are “not enough”/ I didn’t do things right. 


This all started back in June of this year. I am preparing to leave my country for new Zealand with my partner on a temporary visa. My aunt was told she had a *possibility* of having breast cancer due to a test result she received while at a checkup. She immediately called me and I answered (this happens literally 2 days before we fly out). I ended the goodbye with my mom early to take her call. We talk for a few minutes as I had a hair appointment to go to.  

Cancer *does* run in our family on both sides. This is a known fact. My father was diagnosed with prostate cancer just 2 years ago, and my grandmother died of breast/lung cancer when I was young. 

My partner and I stay in CA for a couple of days to spend time with my aunt a few days after this call. We booked our tickets so we would have a layover before our major NZ flight. Over the course of a few weeks I am trying to adapt to life in a new country. Trying to find a job, housing, you know life things. However, I answer every text and call from my aunt regarding any/all updates in regard to her medical situation. In mid July i receive a call from a family member. My father is still sick and I need to speak with his doctor (he was admitted to the ICU 3 days before our flight in June and was not released yet.) horrible news: he is about to be placed on life support- a situation he will never wake up from. I book a flight back home that day. I spend 3 weeks there with my family. I am his POA, handle his paperwork- something I’ve never had to do before. My father makes a semi full recovery- he is still healing. 

I fly back to NZ. Life continues on, and I’m still seeking out therapy to process everything that has happened. In November my partner and I fly out to the states again. Only for 6 days (not including fly time), to fully move out of our former apartment. We are running on 4-5 hours of sleep each night, plus getting government paperwork/appointments together for our visa extension. Before our flight I knew my aunt had a biopsy done to determine the results of her breast cancer- no news at that time. Again, we didn’t get into the full discussion of “if this happens what next”. During our trip she ends up calling me late in the evening. I answer. She has breast cancer. EARLY STAGES. So early that they were able to remove the 3 mm lump in the one breast. She already decided to get both breasts removed and have “cosmetic surgery” in December (I’m not sure the full medical terminology. I also want to add she went to med school for some time during her college years). I asked her if she had a therapy appointment scheduled, told her that I am so happy to know it’s early stages, that she doesn’t have to deal with radiation or it isn’t more serious. I asked her what support she needs, and what does support look like for her. Her response “I don’t know, I need time to process. It’s scary to think and talk about”. I respond “okay, I’ll give you some space, *you* let me know what you need. You let me know if you want to talk. I’ll just send some fully Instagram reels in the meantime, or cat pictures. I don’t know what to say to make it better. I’m not good at this stuff, but I love you. I care about you”. 

She explained how she felt like a burden, and didn’t even want to get me involved. I reassured her that she was family, that I don’t feel like that. 

We ended the call, I cried. But I felt relieved that she had a solid treatable *survivable* plan for the future. We set a plan to call in the morning for her to tell my brother what is going on (22m). 

I try to call her the next morning. No answer, she texts me that she wishes that I have a good/fun trip. I took my brother out, and we picked out a few things as a self care package. (I told him it was an early Christmas package), and I wrote a letter to her.

What it included: cozy socks, face masks, magnets, NZ coffee she has been wanting to try, and a ramen bowl. 

As the days go by, I am exhausted at this point, and mentally stretched thin.  I checked in on my aunt, “Meh” was her response. 

My partner and I fly back to NZ on Thanksgiving day. Multiple delays. It was hell. But we made it. We slept for 16+ hours when we landed. I let my aunt know we were safe. I sent her Instagram reels over the next few days- no response. I texted her telling her to look out for a care package, she just thumbed up the message. It felt wrong. But I took it as “I still need space”. So I kept sending her funny memes- like i said I would. Beginning of December my partners mother was admitted to the ICU. She was there a week. It was serious. It was scary. A lot of my emotional and mental focus was on that. I still haven’t processed it. She is healing! 

I reached out to my aunt again “hey did the package arrive”. “Yes! A care package?” I said yes and my brother helped out. No responses after that. (This was on 9th)

The 13th I ask if she tried the coffee- no response 

Finally she sent me a message. On the 16th of December. 

“Hey I am on day three post major surgery.  I got the coffee in the package you sent me. But I am more confused at the lack of concern about my diagnosis.  It’s truly disappointing. I am about to go to sleep but just thought I’d let you know.  I expected a lot more care and compassion from you and you’ve been more worried about the package than what I’m going through. I don’t care to know the why.  That’s for you to figure it out.  I just wanted to point out the obvious.” 

I had NO idea she already had the surgery, she never told me the exact date beforehand. I was speechless, hurt and angry. I still am as something could have happened during the surgery and I wouldn’t have known. I did respond in a respectful manner anyways. It’s Christmas, she hasn’t opened my message. I don’t know if I should reach out to say happy holidays. I feel trapped. If I do- it’s not giving her space. if I don’t- I’m an asshole. 

I am my aunts only family. She doesn’t speak with anyone else, nor does her family reach out to her. I feel like I tried my best with what I could mentally/emotionally manage. Which isn’t fair to my aunt. I know that :/

1pv4bxo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Newsletters/comments/1pv4bxo/how_to_create_a_newsletter_subscribe_page_that/,How to create a newsletter subscribe page that converts,"I have worked with 30+ newsletters. From early-stage ones with zero social capital to publications with a scale of 100k+ subscribers.

This post gives you the safest frameworks for building your newsletter’s subscribe page.

So... Early-stage newsletters make the mistake of not building a dedicated subscription page.

First, the landing and subscribe pages are not the same.

>The landing page provides context on everything your newsletter offers and directs visitors to solutions.

>Subscribe page shows why your newsletter is worth subscribing to and urges to subcribe asap.

  
While landing pages focus on branding, positioning, and providing context, subscribe pages focus on conversions.

\---

Now, 5 signs of a winning newsletter subscribe pages:

1. Non-Generic Benefit:

I am tired of vague, generic benefits that sound like “Your go-to place for NBA interviews.”

Rather have a 2-3 line copy (yes, longer) that clearly mentions who the newsletter is for, how it helps them, and why they should subscribe.

Add direct benefits.

Example: “We interview NBA athletes to show you their mental preparation before games”

2. Humanise CTA:

Simple ‘Subscribe’ CTA works.

But if you can get creative by mentioning the terms only your audience knows, why not? For creator-led newsletters, it could be phrases your audience associates with you.

My friend and I run a newsletter for coffee homebrewers obsessed with good coffee.

Our CTA = ""Yes, I hate instant coffee""

3. Add a nudge to the CTA

It’s no secret that a lead magnet improves conversions.

(called magnet for a reason)

Give instant access to resources in the welcome email. Make sure it’s mentioned on the landing page so your reader expects it.

This will encourage your readers to open, click, and spend time consuming your content.

I call this immediate value.

Example: “Sign up and we will immediately send you 10 resources every marketer must read”

4. Do not include the archive page

I had a moral dilemma for the longest time, telling myself, “It’s not right to ask people to subscribe without reading the content first.”

But my perspective changed when I understood what visitors were actually looking for.

It’s not really content, but an assurance that whatever they sign up for is worth their time/email.

So instead of adding an archive page that might disrupt the subscription flow, I’d add:

\- Social proof (testimonials, subscriber count, etc.)  
\- Leverage (show how you’re an expert)  
\- Immediate value (ebooks, checklists, links, etc.)  
\- Killer benefits, a call out to ICP, etc., to ensure visitors get the assurance they look for.

5. Image that adds value

Most operators treat images like visual assets. Just to add some colour.

Your Active Retirement starts now ✈️ (We planned a month in Italy & bundled flights/hotels for huge savings!),"**You Might Be Richer Than You Think—Here’s How to Unlock Your Hidden Wealth**

Ever feel like your savings are just… sitting there? Like a forgotten gym membership, collecting dust instead of gains? What if I told you that *right now*, your money could be working harder for you—without you lifting a finger?

Here’s the thing: **Most people underestimate their financial potential.** They see their bank balance and think, *""Eh, not bad… but not enough.""* But what if you could turn that *""not enough""* into *""more than I realized""*?

### **3 Ways Your Savings Are Secretly Richer Than You Think**
1. **The Power of Compound Interest (aka Free Money)**
   - You’ve heard it before, but let’s make it real: If you stash $500/month at 7% interest, in 20 years, you’d have **$260K+**—*without adding a dime extra.*
   - That’s like planting a money tree and forgetting about it… until one day, you’re swimming in cash. (Okay, maybe not swimming, but definitely floating.)

2. **Your ""Small"" Savings Add Up Faster Than You Think**
   - Skip one $10 coffee a week? That’s **$520/year**—enough for a mini-vacation or a chunk of your emergency fund.
   - Cut one unused subscription? Boom, another **$120+ back in your pocket.**
   - Small leaks sink big ships… but small wins build empires.

3. **You’re Probably Ignoring Your Biggest Asset: Time**
   - The earlier you start, the less you need to save. Wait 10 years? You’ll have to save **3x as much** to catch up.
   - Time is the ultimate hack—use it before it uses you.

### **The Real Question: What’s Your Money *Actually* Capable Of?**
Most people never crunch the numbers. They guess. They hope. But hope isn’t a strategy.

**Here’s your wake-up call:** [You might be richer than you think—find out how much your savings could really fund your retirement.](https://mavely.app.link/e/Jw8ypIghuYb)

I reached out to the mods and never received any feedback or answer whatsoever. I can’t believe the content it is filter out in such an object manner.

My library Coffee Beanery is a completely different approach to develop GraphQL server APIs. Out of the box provides multiple features that other libraries do not provide.

I hope I don’t get banned for trying to share a good library that can help the community. Would be good for the community to decide what it is a good content or not.

I understand the job of a mod but just having a brief look to a library can give you an overview of how much work and hours the community put together.

Most of the people do not even share good knowledge. Still can’t believe we (I) get punished just to be open with others code and concepts that help out open source to move forward",0,1766633534.0,dotnet,5,0.4,False

1pv44el,https://www.reddit.com/r/womenintech/comments/1pv44el/asian_womens_rant_on_corporate/,Asian women's rant on corporate,"I don't work in tech but I do work in a black and white, right or wrong, type job/industry and I need to pay attention to details. I can't find a better subreddit for my rants than this one and I think women who work in tech might relate. 

I have a whole bunch of thoughts and frustrations with seeking a corporate career that's more based on logic and facts than humanities, and no idea where to even begin so in no particular order: 

1) Does anyone notice there's a lot of scrutiny, nosiness, and shitty office politics on if women in corporate are in relationships or not? I've sensed it since elementary, but it really took of from high school and onwards. People (both genders) where I live snoop around on your social media for 5+ years to guess who your exes are, or how you feel about relationships, and they try to sneak into being your boyfriend. Like they'll try to get close to you, then kiss you or make out with you out of the blue, and then say you're officially dating now. Or they'll say when you went out for a coffee the other month was a date and you're officially dating now. Or they'll tell other people that you're officially dating even if you're not and get super angry at you if you disagree with it, and by that time everyone thinks you're in love so if you say you're not, people are angry at you instead of him and make you out to be the bad girl, the coldhearted bitch etc. 

For some reason it feels like all the men in my area (regardless of race) are desperate and all want girlfriends. A lot of them are aggressive and manipulative about it. 

I feel like a female student or worker is always hollowed out, has every sexual/romantic detail squeezed out of her and pried into, and has men running laps around her with tricking her into a relationship, not etc. 

In my experience I've dealt with A LOT of office politics on this. I wasn't attracted to most of the men who gave me this bullshit but I have to use all sorts of office politics/tricks myself, to avoid being trapped in a relationship with them. 

2) A fair amount of women in my area face this, regardless of if they're attractive or not. Although people assume it's more likely to happen if you're attractive. It's hard to talk about it bc ppl get jealous and say 'oh thats only an attractive womens problems' but I swear it's just my area. 

3) I swear a lot of my female classmates and colleagues got into relationships due to this. I want to warn them about the aggressive nature of men but I couldn't. A lot of them don't see it and see men through rose tinted glasses. I feel like I'm going crazy because I'm the only one that sees just how aggressive, manipulative, awful etc, the men are about it. Whereas everyone else seems to think men are nice gentlemen or something. Maybe it's because I've had more experiences with men like this I've been able to spot the pattern. 

4) A lot of interracial relationships happen this way. The non-asian men have 0 sense of boundaries or af wanting to date asian and go full in on the manipulation and stuff. I have lots of af classmates and colleagues who married super early (in university) and have had kids already, with various non-asian men. 

I feel like they got trapped down wayy too quickly to even think or reflect on it. 

I don't relate to them when we catch up, nor their divorces or single motherhood (I also know many in this position). 

5) It feels like as a women, (especially an asian women) you NEED to have a boyfriend bare minimum in order to reflect all this bullshit you'll encounter from high school onwards. I have some asian female friends who felt the same way, and they sought out asian guys to be their bf just so the asian guy can help them fend of all these unwanted stuff or they can say ""sorry, I have a boyfriend"" and no, despite stereotypes us asian women don't all want to date non-asian men. 

I don't feel like a relationship with an asian guy is 10/10 or solves all my life's problems or is the best thing on earth, cause relationships are work. It's not the best thing, but even this mid-ground thing, is far FAR preferable for me, than a relationship with a non-asian guy. 

6) I know a lot of asian women who have survived studying or working in corporate but they always had string after string of boyfriends (usually asian if they were woke) to deflect against bullshit. It doesn't always help, but it does help a bit. I've fallen into doing this and have an asian boyfriend who I do use to avoid bullshit with the ""I have a boyfriend"" thing. But a part of me hates it because I just wanted to graduate, get a job, work for 2-3 years minimum, save money, have an emergency fund, work on myself etc, and didn't want to even think about dating until after that point. I would've been happy to do that. Except I dealt with non-stop bullshit so I had to get a boyfriend quickly and a part of me feels like what should've been my youth was robbed from me. What should've been a carefree time I could focus on myself and not worry about men was robbed from me and many other young asian girls. 

I had to mature quickly, realize how aggressive men were, and put in effort (I do put in effort) to get a boyfriend myself to deflect against the other men. 

At this point I feel like all women working in corporate must be prepared to hunt for a decent guy who will help you avoid all the BS from other men otherwise there's no real career bc its just getting tricked into abusive relationship after abusive relationship. 

Can anyone else relate to this or am I going mad? ",0,1766632854.0,womenintech,16,0.39,False

In a competitive digital marketplace, brands can no longer afford to offer a purely transactional journey. By integrating game-like features into the shopping process, you can transform mundane interactions into interactive and rewarding adventures that capture customer attention and build lasting loyalty.

This article will explore what e-commerce gamification is, break down the most effective techniques, and showcase how leading brands are using these strategies to drive significant growth and achieve competitive differentiation.

# What is E-commerce Gamification?

E-commerce gamification is the art of incorporating game design elements and mechanics into non-game contexts, such as an online store. The goal is to make the shopping experience more engaging, enjoyable, and memorable. By tapping into fundamental human drivers for achievement, competition, and reward, gamification turns routine interactions like browsing products or making a purchase into exciting and satisfying experiences that build retention loops and increase customer lifetime value (CLV).

Effective e-commerce gamification relies on a set of proven techniques, each designed to tap into specific psychological triggers that motivate customer behavior and drive commercial goals.

# Popular gamification techniques for e-commerce apps include:

* Loyalty and Rewards Programs
* Spin-to-Win and Other Chance-Based Games
* Quizzes and Personalization
* Challenges and Competitions
* Progress Visualization

Loyalty programs are a cornerstone of gamification, rewarding customers for specific actions like making purchases, reviewing products, or referring new clients. Chance-based games offer shoppers the thrill of winning instant incentives. Quizzes provide a powerful way to deliver personalized product recommendations while collecting valuable customer data. Challenges and competitions are excellent tools for encouraging user participation and generating social proof. Progress visualizations motivate customers to complete a specific goal by showing them how close they are to achieving it.

# Real-World Examples of Gamification in e-commerce brands

Many of the world's most successful e-commerce brands are already leveraging gamification to create more compelling customer journeys. These examples show the versatility and strategic impact of a well-executed gamification strategy.

* **Starbucks:** The Starbucks Rewards program is a masterclass in using a points system to drive retention. Customers earn ""Stars"" on every purchase, which can be redeemed for free items. The app also features personalized challenges, creating a powerful sense of progression (see 2.1.1) that transforms transactional coffee buying into an engaging habit.
* **Farfetch:** The ""Access Rewards"" program is a premier example of a tiered loyalty system (see 2.1.1), motivating customers to climb five levels from bronze to private client. By tying escalating rewards like personal stylists to purchasing milestones, Farfetch gamifies luxury consumption and fosters long-term loyalty among high-value customers.
* **Sony PlayStation:** The ""PlayStation Stars"" program brilliantly merges a loyalty system with the core product experience. Users earn points and digital trophies not just for purchases but also for completing in-game challenges, creating a seamless retention loop that encourages both gameplay and spending.
* **KENZO:** To promote a limited-edition sneaker, the fashion brand launched the ""Shopping League,"" a multiplayer online game where users competed in one-on-one duels to win the right to purchase the exclusive product. This campaign masterfully used scarcity and competition (see 2.1.4) to generate immense desirability and organic PR, proving that gamification can be a powerful product launch strategy.
* **Shein:** The fast-fashion giant uses a comprehensive points system where users earn rewards for daily check-ins, product reviews, and outfit contests. These points translate into significant discounts, creating a powerful cycle of engagement and purchasing that has been instrumental to its rapid growth.
* **AliExpress:** The global marketplace has integrated mini-games directly into its platform, where users earn digital coins that function as in-app currency. This strategy increases time-in-app and keeps users engaged with the brand even when they aren't actively shopping.
* **Charlotte Tilbury:** The makeup brand uses a 3D avatar to guide users through immersive virtual worlds and shoppable 3D spaces. This innovative approach blurs the line between gaming and retail, creating a highly engaging and futuristic shopping experience that offers a distinct competitive advantage.
* **Studio Shed:** This company offers a virtual reality design tool that allows customers to build and customize their own shed models. By turning the design process into an interactive and personal game, Studio Shed reduces purchase uncertainty and empowers customers, streamlining the path to conversion for a high-consideration product.

# The Benefits of Gamifying Your E-commerce Experience

When implemented strategically, gamification provides tangible benefits and a strong return on investment for e-commerce brands.

# Increased Customer Engagement

Game-like elements and interactive experiences add value to the customer journey, keeping users on your website or app for longer periods and increasing the frequency of their interactions.

# Improved Customer Loyalty

By offering rewards, achievements, and a sense of progression, gamification makes customers feel more invested in the platform, creating emotional connections that encourage repeat purchases and increase CLV.

# Boosted Sales Revenue

Gamification has been shown to increase conversion rates, average order value, and customer lifetime value. For example, targeted game mechanics like spin-to-win widgets have been shown to increase conversions by up to 7x compared to standard pop-ups.

# Enhanced Brand Awareness

Shareable achievements, social media contests, and referral challenges encourage word-of-mouth marketing and can lead to powerful and cost-effective organic user acquisition.

# Valuable Data Collection

Interactive elements like quizzes and personalized challenges provide valuable insights into customer preferences and behaviors. This allows brands to move beyond broad demographic targeting and segment audiences based on nuanced psychographic profiles and stated preferences, leading to more resonant and effective marketing.

# Conclusion: The Future is Playful and Strategic

Gamification is far more than a passing trend; it is a powerful, long-term strategy for e-commerce platforms looking to deepen customer engagement and build unshakable loyalty. By transforming the shopping experience into something more interactive and rewarding, brands can differentiate themselves in a crowded market and create more meaningful connections with their audience.

Looking ahead, the future of gamification will be driven by emerging technologies like Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), and Artificial Intelligence (AI). These technologies will not just enhance existing strategies; they will enable hyper-personalized, dynamically adaptive gamified experiences, making a sophisticated approach to gamification an essential—not optional—component for any e-commerce business aiming to dominate the future of digital retail.

Implementing the strategies discussed in this article, particularly a robust loyalty and rewards program, is a critical step toward unlocking sustainable growth. For Shopify merchants ready to transform their customer experience, having the right tools is essential.

Example: 你可以喝咖啡，或者喝茶。

Nǐ kěyǐ hē kāfēi, huòzhě hē chá.

You can drink coffee, or drink tea.

2. 还是Háishì : It expresses selection, is mostly used in interrogative sentences (alternative questions), and can also be used in declarative sentences to show doubt or hesitation with a more active tone.

Example:你喝咖啡还是喝茶？

Nǐ hē kāfēi háishì hē chá?

Do you drink coffee or tea?

3.Sentence Pattern Differences:

Declarative sentences: We usually use ""或者huòzhě "" to objectively list options.

Example:周末我或者看书，或者看电影。

Zhōumò wǒ huòzhě kàn shū, huòzhě kàn diànyǐng.

On weekends, I either read books or watch movies.

Note: When ""还是háishì"" is used in declarative sentences, it often carries a tone of discussion or hesitation.

Example: 我不知道周末去公园还是去商场。

Wǒ bù zhīdào zhōumò qù gōngyuán háishì qù shāngchǎng.

I don't know whether to go to the park or the mall on weekends.

Interrogative sentences: We can only use ""还是háishì "" to form alternative questions.

Example: 你明天去北京还是上海？ 

Nǐ míngtiān qù Běijīng háishì Shànghǎi? 

Will you go to Beijing or Shanghai tomorrow?

1pv42cv,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Opening_Tomorrow_288/comments/1pv42cv/story/,Story,"My mother wanted me to go through confirmation when I was fifteen years old. Even as a high schooler, weighted by the dredges of a misdiagnosis, treated like an idiot for my entire life, knew that the psychological damage of religious confirmation would carve chasms in my developing cognitive landscape. When I thought about the finality of a chosen faith, the proclamation of an answer when I didn't even know the question--I couldn't stomach the process. 

My mother is a back pew Christian. She couldn't get my brother and I ready on time, even when we were scheduled to be the acolyte. She rushed into the sanctuary, a cloud of angrily chewed mint gum and expired lipstick--a storm of hushed vexation, regaling her woes to the other parents.

My mother is a protestant, a congregationalist, but the lack of central religious leadership always made the church feel hap-hazard. Authority was heavily associated with angry child-care providers and never attributable to a spiritual guide. Sunday school engaged children in whimsically strict busy work while parents temporarily hardened their moral compunctions in the sanctuary below. Everything smelt like stale coffee, old wood, and yellowing paper. Religious themed arts and crafts were executed with broken crayons, dollar store scissors and discolored construction paper. The bathrooms had pink Dial soap, an abundance of one-ply toilet paper, and a dead flower in a milk white vase. The smell of clean dust betrayed how rarely rooms were used---it was a once-a-week community center that was abandoned by 2:00pm on Sunday. During the week, AA and the girls scouts met in the social room (on different days, of course). The church administrators ensured that only the social room was used for any non church related function.

There was a chruchery-school in the basement where most members sent their toddlers. The alphabet was taught. Itsy-bitsy-spider was sung. Children tasted the beginning complexities of their own socialization. 

  
I hated church, but it was grounding. I hated church, but I loved the stained glass. I loved the massive painting of Jesus that dominated the narthex. I loved the feeling of bible paper, and the thickness of mid century carpet beneath my feet. I loved the idea of A for apple, B for boy, and G for God. I was afraid of the devil and Jesus fortified my child brain against dark rooms and unknown danger. 

But---when I was in high school, and I was told I would have to start confirmation class after church, I instinctively said ""no."" It felt like liquid metal poured into a mould---dangerous, angry, and prepared to harden. I realized that--no matter how much I valued its structure---I couldn't know. I couldn't accept faith as a conceptual anchor to guide me for the rest of my life. Appreciation never crossed the barrier to belief.

Unfortunately this is also at the same time in which I'm honing my skills as a tattoo artist AND becoming reaquiainted with Pro Tools- leaving me little spare brain and time to learn the intricacies of manual espresso machines. It looks like a refurbished or secondhand superauto setup would be my best ticket to the experience I want at home. 

I'm from Chicago- current favorite cups have been from Conscious Cup and Krema Coffee Roasters. They're not always amazing but they've impressed me the most. I drink about one latte a day- caffiene tolerance is low again so I'll probably return to 2 cups a day soon enough. 

Experience level on the brewing end is essentially 0, hence why I considered Nespresso after having a really nice cup from a friend. I have severe chronic fatigue, so this is my ticket to a more productive life.

I’m pretty new to the sub, but I’ve been pretty active in it over the past year. For context, in May 2025. Ended up saying screw this to my job and took a four months sabbatical. Traveled for three months in June across Thailand and Japan. Greatest experience I’ve ever had.

I had so many firsts, so much growth in terms of good emotions bad emotions. Learned a lot about myself and my strengths along with things I want to improve. I met a ton of people mainly through bar, crawls and tours. and overall just gained a bunch of confidence learned a lot about myself, and just lived at unconventional life compared to the Western world (I’m from Canada)

After I came back from my trip, I crashed hard. I always knew about post travel, depression, but didn’t realize how much it would actually hit me. Came back to the same toxic job. Somehow got even worse. Quit without anything lined up. Went through about two months of anxiety and borderline depression. But I ended up landing a fully remote job. They have a 1 to 2 month work abroad policy and I have five weeks of vacation (pretty solid from other companies in the west that I’ve heard of so can’t complain)

I want to make as much advantage of this newfound freedom that I have. Even though I won’t be taking a sabbatical anytime soon at least I can have more trips every couple of months.

I have quite a few questions. So firstly, I fell in love with Thailand and definitely make a plan to go back. But I don’t want to get stuck in that mode of only going to Thailand and not experiencing other countries.

Any recommendations of solo friendly, relatively cheaper and enjoyable/social countries with great nightlife? I want to maximize how many trips I can do a year. And the only way I can do it that is by budgeting so I’m not spending as much.

Any recommendations of how to meet people abroad? I’ve had a lot of success meeting people through a bar crawls and sometimes through tours. In Bangkok, I joined 2 Meetups on Meetup.com. But any more advice?

I love meeting people in fact that’s probably the reason why I crashed so hard is because I just fell in love with getting to know, locals and tourists.

Also, I realize that I’m more fond of traveling to take your time as opposed to feeling like a tourist and rushing to see everything. So if I do go back to any of these countries, my goal wouldn’t be to see as much of the country as I can, but to really immerse myself in the place that I’m in. For example, in Thailand, I would probably spend a week in Bangkok and another few days in Chiang Mai. If I plan to go to Portugal, I would probably mostly spend my time in Lisbon with a tour here and there, but I wouldn’t try to see the entire country. I love the feeling of actually living at a place like a local and having routine routines like jamming your coffee shop seeing things here and there having a nice meal connecting with locals and people that’s mostly what it is.

Matched on Tinder. Conversation was normal. Light banter. No red flags. She suggests coffee. Perfect. Public. Low commitment. I think, “Great, worst case I drink caffeine and leave.”

I show up a few minutes early. She walks in, looks exactly like her photos. So far, so good.

We order. Sit down.

She says, “I’m really glad you agreed to meet. I don’t usually connect with people.”

That sentence should have warned me. It did not.

She asks what I am looking for. I say something safe. Casual, see where it goes, normal human response.

She nods and immediately says, “Okay, so my last relationship ended because he cheated with my cousin, and then my best friend stopped talking to me, and my therapist says I need to be more open.”

This is minute four.

I am holding my coffee like it is a stress ball. I say, “Oh wow, that’s rough.”

She takes this as permission.

I now know about her childhood, her parents’ divorce, her attachment style, and why men from southwestern Ontario cannot be trusted. She references astrology at least twice. I do not know my sign and at this point I am afraid to ask.

She asks me, “Do you believe people are inherently good?”

I say, “Depends on the person.”

She says, “That’s interesting,” and writes something in her phone. I do not know what that means.

At some point she asks if I want kids. I say maybe someday. She says she wants three but not with someone who has “avoidant tendencies.”

I have known her for twenty minutes.

The barista checks on us. She says, “We’re having a really deep conversation.”

The barista looks at me like I am being held hostage.

Finally, she says, “I feel like we have a connection.”

I panic and say, “I think we get along, but I’m not sure we’re on the same page.”

She nods, smiles, and says, “Yeah, I felt that too.”

She then asks if we can still follow each other on Instagram to “see where life takes us.”

I say sure because I am weak.

She hugs me. It is long. Too long. I leave.

An hour later she messages me, “I think you’re emotionally unavailable, but I wish you healing.”

I did not ask for healing.

TL;DR: Went on a Tinder coffee date in St. Thomas, Ontario, expecting small talk and instead received a full emotional autobiography and a soft diagnosis.",14,1766632086.0,stories,14,0.89,False

1pv3vef,https://www.reddit.com/r/MarvelFanStory/comments/1pv3vef/strength_the_human_hulk/,Strength — The Human Hulk,"Far beyond the city lights of Rochester, New York—past the factories, past the river bends, and into a quiet stretch of land where the air still carried the memory of drums and stories—there lived a family who honored their past with dignity and care.

They were the **Adebayo family**, proud African Americans who traced their lineage back through generations of storytellers, steelworkers, builders, and singers. Around the dinner table, elders spoke of **John Henry**, the legendary man who challenged the machine with nothing but his hammer and his heart. The Adebayo family didn’t claim the legend lightly. They didn’t boast. They simply said:

“Strength is not just muscle. It is spirit.”

# The Family

* **Samuel Adebayo** – the father, broad-shouldered and calm, a construction foreman who believed leadership came from patience.
* **Ruth Adebayo** – the mother, strong in a quieter way, a community nurse whose hands healed more than bodies.
* **Malik Adebayo** – the eldest son, tall and powerful, a college athlete with natural strength.
* **Ayo Adebayo** – the middle child, disciplined and steady, already working with his father on construction sites.
* **Kehinde Adebayo** – the youngest son… and the one who worried the most.

Kehinde was kind, thoughtful, and observant—but he was not strong in the way his family was known for.

# The Boy Who Couldn’t Lift

At sixteen, **Kehinde** struggled with tasks his brothers handled easily.

He could sweep the porch, wash dishes, organize tools, tend the garden, and help his mother at the clinic—but when it came to heavy chores, he always had to step back.

He couldn’t:

* Carry sacks of cement from the truck
* Lift steel beams onto the foundation
* Chop thick logs for winter
* Push broken-down vehicles off the road

When he tried, his arms shook, his breath faltered, and sometimes the laughter of passing neighbors—unintended but painful—cut deeper than words.

One evening, as Malik hauled a refrigerator onto the porch by himself, Kehinde looked down at his hands.

“I’m sorry,” he said quietly.

Samuel placed a hand on his shoulder.  
“Son, you don’t owe strength to anyone.”

But Kehinde still felt the weight.

# A Prayer in Candlelight

That night, Kehinde knelt beside his bed. A single candle flickered, casting long shadows across the room. On his wall were drawings—not of superheroes, but of African symbols, drums, and a hammer resting against lightning.

He whispered softly, not demanding, not angry—just hopeful.

“God… ancestors… whoever listens… I don’t want to be better than anyone. I just want to be strong enough to help. Strong enough to protect.”

The candle flame grew taller.

The air rumbled—not violently, but like distant thunder rolling across the sky.

And then a voice—not loud, but powerful—spoke within him.

**“Strength is earned by the heart that seeks it.”**

# The Blessing of Shango

Lightning did not strike the house.  
The earth did not break.

Instead, energy flowed through Kehinde’s body like rhythm through a drum.

His muscles tightened—not grotesquely, but purposefully. His frame expanded, bones reinforcing, skin hardening like living stone. His heartbeat synced with thunder, steady and unstoppable.

This was not rage.

This was **balance**.

The presence of **Shango**, the Orisha of thunder, strength, and justice, did not command Kehinde.

It **recognized** him.

By dawn, the boy who had knelt in prayer stood as a man.

# Morning Shock

Ruth dropped her coffee cup.

Malik froze mid-step.

Ayo whispered, “No way…”

Kehinde stood in the doorway, now towering, broad, calm—his eyes still gentle, still kind.

“Mom,” he said carefully, “I think something happened.”

Samuel stared for a long moment… then nodded.

“Our stories are alive,” he said quietly. “And they chose you.”

# Strength Beyond Measure

Kehinde soon learned the truth of his transformation.

He lifted a broken car to free a trapped neighbor—effortlessly.  
He steadied a collapsing house during a storm—alone.  
Bullets bounced harmlessly from his skin during a robbery attempt.  
Explosions rattled him but never broke him.

He did not grow angry.

He grew **responsible**.

News traveled fast.

And soon, an opportunity came from **New York City**.

# The Job That Changed Everything

Kehinde was offered work as a **structural safety specialist**—someone who reinforced damaged buildings, rescued people during collapses, and assisted emergency crews in situations too dangerous for machines.

In Harlem, on his first night shift, a man stepped out of the shadows.

Luke Cage.

“You’re built different,” Luke said, arms crossed. “And not just physically.”

Kehinde smiled.  
“I was raised that way.”

They worked together—protecting neighborhoods, stopping gangs, lifting debris, shielding civilians.

“You don’t fight angry,” Luke said one night. “That’s rare.”

Kehinde replied, “Anger breaks things. Strength holds them together.”

# A New Name

The people noticed.

They didn’t see a monster.

They saw a protector.

A man who lifted buses.  
A man who stood against explosions.  
A man who carried buildings like burdens meant to be shared.

They gave him a name—not in fear, but in awe.

**Strength — The Human Hulk**

Not born of rage.  
Not driven by destruction.  
But forged by faith, ancestry, and respect.

# Legacy

Back home, a candle still burned by Kehinde’s bed.

Not as a wish anymore.

But as thanks.

And somewhere, in the echo of thunder, Shango smiled—not at power gained, but at power used wisely.",1,1766631966.0,MarvelFanStory,0,1.0,False

But still I have no one to listen, so I would really appreciate anyone bearing this.

 Today at dawn, we had worship service bc of you-know-who’s birthday. Parents, brother, grandma, and I went there and then when our way home we went to have some breakfast. On the way my father called my name out for something, so I peered at him from the backseat. I thought my dad saw me so I awaited his answer. And suddenly he got mad bc he felt disrespected of my lack of answer. And ofc I apologized myself, already sick of his crap first in the morning, on the very day of christmas. 

We got home around 7 or 8 and I slept until 11. Until my father woke me up for errands. Mind you, I was tired (obviously), I didn’t wanna get out in the cold to grab his coffee. Oh and just before this my brother attempted to wake me up and failed, then my mom which I replied “I want to sleep”, and then my dad waking me up. I knew this was a very unreasonable request so I thought I’d be fine with saying no. (Seriously waking up a person for errands when there are other people, even themself?) And the he threatened that he’ll have to ‘punish’ me real soon and will hit me. What a douche. 

Went cafe with brother, and while waiting, I was thinking about what I could’ve done or could've happened to make him that aggressive in the morning. Aside what happened at dawn, I couldn’t seem to find any reasonable evidence. Which led to only option, and that is, power play. 

My body is getting bigger and I am getting older day by day, and he is anxious he’ll lose control over me. So now even with the slightest trigger he reacts violently. 

But why. Why couldn’t he have picked another day for ts? Seriously, christmas? 

Another day, another stage of fucking yandere simulator. I’m sick of this meaningless and petty power play, and that I have to oblige. I am so sick of disrespect.

Sorry for coming up here for such a trivial matter, but I just can’t bear dealing with this every single holiday, without no support. Thanks for bearing this, and Happy Holidays :)",1,1766631844.0,CPTSD,1,1.0,False

I really gonna be honest with yall, i dont really have any bad side effect at all (well, in the first days), at the begining i was really sleepy, it was hard because i was too tired to do anything, but it wasnt that bad, I had some nausea, but it wasn't a big deal the first few days.

Especially the egregious claim that the vegan diet is EASY!  I just asked chat gpt because it's all over the place and so exhausting.

I'm so glad that vegans are able to do this - how lucky and privileged they must be, but I'm sorry, this is INSANE.  I could *never* do this.  Not in a million years.  I know many exvegans are able to do this because most people are generally healthy and active with massive guts and digestive systems with strong teeth like horses - unlike me who's like a moth in comparison, but that still didn't even work for them.

I'll just copy and paste if anyone is interested, it's AI, so take it with a grain of salt (please just ignore if you hate AI - I barely use it)  Does this sound right to you?

# What professionals actually mean by a “well-planned vegan diet”

When organizations like the **Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics** or **British Dietetic Association** say *“well-planned”*, they **do not** mean:

* “Eat vegetables and you’ll be fine”
* “Just listen to your body”
* “Whole foods automatically cover everything”
* “Eat until you’re full”

They mean something **much more structured and intentional**.

A *well-planned vegan diet* is essentially a diet that **consciously replaces every nutrient normally supplied by animal foods**, *on purpose*, *every day*, often with **supplements and fortified foods**.

This is not a moral judgment — just a biological reality.

# The non-negotiables (this is the core)

A vegan diet is considered “well-planned” **only if all of these are reliably covered**:

# 1. Vitamin B12 (mandatory)

* **There is no vegan diet that is adequate without B12 supplementation**
* Typical recommendation:
   * 25–100 mcg daily **or**
   * 1,000–2,000 mcg weekly

This alone disqualifies many “casual” vegan diets from being “well-planned”.

# 2. Adequate calories (this is where many people struggle)

Plant foods are **less calorie-dense** than animal foods.

A well-planned vegan diet assumes:

* You are **intentionally eating more volume**
* Or adding calorie-dense plant foods (nuts, seeds, oils, grains)

For many adults:

* **\~2,000–2,400 kcal/day** (varies by body size, sex, activity, illness)

This often means:

* 3 full meals **plus**
* 1–3 snacks
* Not skipping meals
* Not relying on salads, soups, or smoothies alone

Undereating is one of the *most common* failures of “unplanned” veganism.

# 3. Protein (not just “some”)

A well-planned vegan diet **targets protein intentionally**, not incidentally.

General target:

* **0.8–1.0 g protein per kg body weight**
* Often **more** if:
   * You’re ill
   * Under stress
   * Recovering from addiction
   * Underweight
   * Neurodivergent with higher metabolic demand
   * \[insert whatever health condition you have\]

That usually means **daily inclusion** of:

* Legumes (beans, lentils)
* Soy foods (tofu, tempeh, soy milk)
* Nuts/seeds
* Grains *combined* with legumes

Example:

* Beans alone are not enough
* Rice alone is not enough
* Variety matters daily

# 4. Iron (with absorption strategy)

Plant iron is **non-heme iron**, which is harder to absorb.

“Well-planned” means:

* Iron-rich foods **daily**
* Vitamin C **in the same meal**
* Awareness that tea/coffee block absorption

This is work — not passive eating.

# 5. Omega-3 fats (EPA & DHA)

This is a big one that’s often glossed over.

“Well-planned” usually assumes **one of these**:

* Regular algae-based DHA/EPA supplement
* Or high ALA intake (flax/chia/walnuts) *with the understanding that conversion is poor*

Many dietitians now quietly recommend **algae supplements**, especially for:

* Mental health
* Neurological vulnerability
* Pregnancy
* Long-term vegans

# 6. Calcium + Vitamin D

This is not automatic on a vegan diet.

“Well-planned” means:

* Fortified plant milks **daily**
* OR calcium-rich plant foods in sufficient quantity
* Vitamin D supplementation in low-sun climates (like Canada)

# 7. Iodine

This is one of the most commonly missed nutrients.

“Well-planned” often requires:

* Iodized salt **intentionally**
* Or seaweed in *controlled* amounts (not random)

# What “well-planned” looks like in real life (not theory)

A *real* well-planned vegan day might include:

* Fortified plant milk (multiple servings)
* Legumes **at least twice daily**
* Whole grains
* Nuts/seeds
* Added fats
* Fruit & vegetables
* B12 supplement
* Possibly vitamin D
* Possibly iodine
* Possibly omega-3 supplement

That’s… a lot to manage.

And that’s **before** factoring in:

* IBS
* Sensory aversions
* Appetite suppression
* Executive dysfunction
* Trauma
* Poverty
* Burnout
* Illness & Disease
* Addiction recovery
* Genetic variants

1pv3m0t,https://i.redd.it/2gegxpt0l99g1.jpeg,Fan Fic Wishlist: Odd Theory,"

I want to have a spinoff series with Jonathan, Murray, and Nancy. Perhaps 5-10 years pass after the finale of Stranger things, the three try and fail to settle down back to regular life. Nancy and Jonathan split apart. Murray continues his normal crazy conspiracy ways. The three come back to Hawkins after major failures in their personal life. Nancy gets fired due to becoming overzealous in tracking leads. She becomes almost paranoid, with the trauma of Hawkins haunts her. She comes back to Hawkins for a reset with her mother and dad. Mike and the kids are off to college at this point. Jonathan tries to become a famous photographer, but sadly he has only held a job as a retail employee in a major city. He comes home hoping his past will spark an artistic Renaissance in himself. He spends a couple days with his mother.  Murray feels like his life is empty after the excitement of the series. He's gone back to his normal everyday, but it feels pathetic years after the events of Hawkins. He comes to see Hopper every now and then to relive the glory days. 

The three cross paths at a memorial site for those lost. They decide to go out for breakfast. This serves as an homage to the above scene. They lament their lives and reminence on the past. A man in black walks into the diner, and gives the group a bit of the heebie jeebies. He sits down and drinks coffee in the background, as we gets a brief conversation recapping the end of the series and how it impacted their journeys. Then *pop pop* as the man in black is gunned down by a strange looking fellow. He steals the man's briefcase, and the group feel prone to action. Murray knocks the man down, Nancy grabs the gun and Jonathan grabs the briefcase. As the group is dragged into another conspiracy.... 

I thought the series could be a fun focus on 90s homages, like Stranger things is a focus on 80s. The briefcase and Pulp fiction is an obvious one. Just a fun thought I've been toying with today, as my excitement for tomorrow grows!

1pv3kx2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/comments/1pv3kx2/misfit_toys/,Misfit Toys,"Officer Marco walked through the alleyway, the reports were pretty clear. 



Someone was cutting down his network of informants, and it was targeted. 



The city’s politics had grown pretty hazy as the leadership finally woke up to the real problem.  Arrests had to be increased.



Cashless Bail? Prison Reform?  That bleeding heart shit wasn’t going to work, he knew that much.



He spun on his heel as he reacted to the sound of a trashbin rolling across the alleyway.  



His nerves were on a hair trigger, he was ready for anything.  



Whether it was a gang of thugs who had somehow gotten some rat inside his department or if this was just what these animals considered ‘Street justice’ he wasn’t sure.



All he knew was that the people who fed him all the information for his last bust were gone.  Each killed in their own homes, no less.



So here he was, at the burnt out apartment building that he had run a raid on not more than a month ago in November. 



The memories were still fresh in his mind.



…



“No Knock,” the radio called out, “Warrant’s issues, get in there.”



Officer Marco slipped the safety off on his rifle as he waited for the two armored officers with battering rams to crack the door off its hinges.



“Move move!” Marco shouted as his radio chimed in, several officers rushing into the apartment building.



“Egress into the lobby confirmed, all units, stay alert,” was the call on the radio.



 Marco kept his head on a swivel as he rushed up the stairs.  



The goal was very simple, the intel was clear, there was a terrorist cell in the building.



At least, that’s what the mayor had confirmed.  



It’s not the mayor’s fault if the next up and coming challenger to his campaign was in the same building.  Hell, who associates with terrorist cells?



The officer’s boots thumped up dusty stairs as the sound of gunfire echoed from down below.



“Shots fired!” the radio called out, “Primary target not down, keep up the pursuit!”



Marco kept going up the steps, stopping at a hallway.  He watched one door slam shut, and made his way directly towards it, motioning for his fellow officers to file behind him.



One officer slammed his fist on the door, “Police!  Open up!”



Marco rolled his eyes, “That ain’t protocol anymore, rookie!”



With a kick of his boot, he knocked the door in.



There he was, a man with dark skin in his pajama’s, a small pendant shaped like a moon hanging around his neck, resting on his bare chest.  His hands were up, but his eyes were steely and his expression grim.



This was their target.  Theodore Fadel, the up and coming alderman who was a threat to the mayor and police chief’s crackdown on crime in the city.



Marco smiled, “On the ground.”



Marco didn’t wait, and instead opened fire.  His other officers followed suit, blasting away at the man.



Theodore fell to his knees, blood spurting from his mouth as his once steely demeanor shook.



Marco grinned as he approached the man, pulling out his side arm as he pushed it to Theodore’s forehead, “Always so fucking cocky right up until a bullet flies through you, huh?” 



Without waiting for a reply, Marco fired his sidearm, blasting the back of Theodore’s head out, his gray matter painting the room behind him.



“Target down,” Marco said into his radio.



“Secure the area,” the radio echoed, “good work everyone.  Clean-up time.”



Marco heard something shift in the closet, and quickly motioned for his fellow officers to follow him.



He slowly approached the closet, making a nod to the rookie from earlier to open it.



As it opened, a huge green teddy bear with holes punctured through its downy fur fell forward.  Fluff and stuffing filled the air as it rolled harmlessly to his feet. 



It was about five feet tall, had beady blue and green eyes, and a stoic expression stitched onto its little bear snout. 



Rolling next to it was a blood covered toy, upon closer inspection, it was a small wind-up toy of some kind, seemingly a monkey.



Behind the bear in the closet was a little girl, no older than 8.



Marco looked at the back of the bear, seeing blood stains on the fur.



He kicked the bear out of the way, looking down at the small girl, her breaths coming quick and short as blood dripped from her wounds.  Her eyes were dilated, tears leaking down them.



“We need EMS-” the rookie started to call before Marco slapped his hand from the radio.



“This ain’t academy, kid,” Marco spat at his feet, “She’s a witness, and she’s already done for,"" Marco turned as the girl’s eyes dulled, and she slumped onto the bear.  “Terrorists,” Marco said with a grin, “Always using kids as shields.” 



…



Another clatter of trash bins and Marco was certain he had somehow either spooked a pack of rats or someone was fucking with him, “Show yourselves, you fucker!”



A raspy voice called out from down the alley, exactly from where Marco wasn’t sure.  “Rude, my man.”



This guy sounded like some common thug, “Okay buddy, you’re cornered.  There’s about ten guys outside here waiting to take you down.”



The raspy voice chuckled, “No there ain’t!” 



Marco flinched as his bluff didn’t hold up, “Okay prick, but you don’t have the drop on me.”



“Drop?” The raspy voice called from another position within the long alleyway.  There was a scurrying sound that Marco dismissed as rats, “Nah, ain’t no drops!  Not like that drop of a watch yah got! What’s that?  Rolex? Nice bit of kit on a cop salary, eh?”



Marco scoffed, his safety off as he held his flashlight up, “Uncultured thugs like you only know the big names.  It’s a Breguet, you fucking animal.”



The raspy voice laughed, “Animal?!” more scurrying rushed across the alleyway, “Oh brother! You don’t know what you don’t know!”



Marco lifted his lip in a sneer, “Listen asshole, I got better things to do than trash talk with some punk on Christmas Eve.”



“Me too,” a dark hiss now came from the voice, and Marco looked up, his eyes on the fire escape as a window closed, “But hey, you saw I didn’t have no more Merry Christmas’s, didn’t yah, *punk?*”



Marco growled and holstered his weapon as he jumped up and climbed the fire escape.  He moved to the window, his expression stoney and agitated.  “Keep this up, you’ll be in a pine box.”



“Dey make ‘em in pine anymore?  Thought they were metal ones…” the voice taunted from inside the building, “Or is it just that the poor folk get a pine box?  Po’ from cradle to grave, just how the system likes it, right,” the voice added a final word to agitate Marco, “*Punk?”*



Marco pulled his gun out again, his light searching into the apartment he had been inside once before.



He tapped his light on the sill, and checked on either side, right and left, for traps, even looking to the ceiling before he finally walked in.  



“Keep talking asshole,” Marco growled, “Those were good men that you killed.”



“No they ain’t,” the voice hissed from near the kitchen.



Marco spun around, eyes narrowing, still not seeing anyone, “You playing games, dick?” Marco pointed blindly into the kitchen, firing off a round, “Cause I got cheat codes for ‘Hide and Seek’.”



“I miss hide n’ seek,” the voice growled, “I miss a lot of games, this isn’t as fun.  Ain’t what I was made for, yah know?”



Marco stormed into the kitchen, looking around.



There was nothing but a fridge which stank of stale food and stagnant water in unwashed dishes.



He was as quiet as he could be, walking around the kitchen, checking cabinets.



As he opened one cabinet, something jumped out at him.



It was small, no bigger than a coffee mug, and gave him a start.



As it whipped past him, he thought he heard mechanical springs and clockwork gears shifting as it whizzed near his head.



Marco turned to where the thing ran off too, now startled as he heard scurrying moving towards the closet.



Marco turned to the opened cabinet, seeing nothing but pots and pans.



A rat, obviously.  What else could it be?  Marco told himself as he moved slowly through the apartment, his eyes shifting through the dark room, his flashlight illuminating small sections at a time as he searched.



“What were you made for, eh?” Marco asked, hoping to get information, if nothing else.



“I gots a better question: What were *you* made for?” the voice calls from near the closet.



Marco slowly made his way towards the closet, his light focused on the doorway which still had bullet holes and a few evidence markers strewn around.  “To serve and protect,” Marco said flatly as he slowly made his way to the closet.



The raspy voice echoed from the closet, “Oh, so we both ain’t going by our original designs!  Look at dat!  Peas in a pod, you ‘n me!”



Marco’s lip lifted in a sneer, “I’m doing what I’m supposed to do, prick!”



“Me too!  You workin’ for your boss as he lines ya pockets,” the voice called out.



Marco frowned, his stomach sinking.



“Oh,” the voice chuckled from the closet, “Yeah yeah, not the regular money. Nah, that dirty shit.  Corrupt as they come, the whole lot of yah!”



“They had families!” Marco snapped, rushing to the closet and opening it, seeing nothing there but coats, boots, and a shelf of board games.



“I had family too,” the voice hissed near Marco’s ear.



He spun on his heel, his eyes wide as he came face to face with the small toy monkey he had seen no more than a month ago.



Marco staggered back, confused as he lifted his pistol and light at it.



The toy’s vinyl face reflected back at Marco. Permanent marker was on its face, making its expression appear angry and happy.  A little ‘V’ on its forehead and a wide Cheshire grin on its face as its gears and mechanisms snapped and popped.  



“What the fuck…?” Marco asked no one in particular.



In a moment, the toy spoke, “I said: I had family too.” 



Marco snapped his gun up and fired, the small target scurrying up along the closet and dodging the next three shots before Marco could think.



“Itchy trigger,” the toy chuckled, “But that tracks.”



Marco narrowed his eyes, “What is this?  You some kind of remote drone or something?”



“Nah,” the toy said as it settled at the top of the closet, looking down at Marco, “I’m named Cornelius .  That’s what lil’ Tammy called me, anyway.”



Marco scoffed, “Okay, I’m either dreaming or this is some really sick joke.”



“Sick joke?” Cornelius said as his head tilted back and forth, plastic eyes shifting right and left mechanically before they settled on Marco, his gears all pausing as the voice echoed from within the plastic figure, “A sick joke is what you people did here.”



“It was an unfortunate accident,” Marco said with a grin.



Cornelius shook his head, “nah.  Wasn’t an accident.  It’s systemic,” the figure continued.



Marco laughed, “Got that revisionist history shit, puppet?”



“Look what kettle is callin’ the pot black, huh?” Cornelius began, “Youse the puppet.  Doin’ what ever dey tell yah. Long as yah get paid.  Honor and Ethics for sale, your people don’t care.”



Marco shook his head, moving closer to the closet door, “Oh?  That’s what your boss tells you?”



“Ain’t got a boss,” Cornelius explained, “Not no more.”



“What, was your boss the kid?” Marco mocked.



Cornelius’s head merely turned at an angle, adjusting while keeping Marco within his sight.



“You’re serious?” Marco laughed, “You took orders from an 8-year-old?”



Cornelius’s expression somehow seemed to sour, “I used to.  Den you showed up.  Yah know what my last orders were?”



Marco shook his head, “Tea party?”



“*Please protect us,*” Cornelius’s voice echoed in the tone of a little girl, “*Don’t let ‘em hurt us, please.”*



Marco’s expression fell, “Okay, this is a dream or a nightmare or something.”



“Nah,” Cornelius said flatly, “If it was a dream it’d be happy.  You don’t got nightmares.  You sleep like a baby,” he looks around the room, “But not the people here.  They gotta deal with the raids, and the gunshots.  No one shows up if a druggie drops someone, or there’s an OD, but the second the higher ups say that someone crossed a line? You fuckers are here, distubin’ what little peace there might be.”



“Peace?” Marco laughed, “Ain’t no peace here in the slums.”



“Cause you make it that way!” Cornelius growled, the sound of his voice surprising Marco.



Marco pointed his gun at the small toy, narrowing his eyes.



“You fucks, always making the laws work against these streets!  Keepin’ everyone here down while propping yourselves up!” Cornelius’s plastic eye lids drop slightly, gears shifting audibly, “And the second someone tries to make it better, there you fuckers are, guns blazing.”



Marco shook his head, “You’re a fucking toy,” he walked closerto the closet, “The fuck are you going to do about any of it?”



Marco felt the ground shift as he fell, something snagged his ankles and pulled them out from under him.



His head cracked on the floor as his flashlight clattered across the room, his gun a few inches from him.



His vision was hazy as he tried to get his wits about him, snapping himself out of his dazed state as he reached for his gun.



A large furry paw slapped down on the pistol, dragging it back into the closet.



Marco looked up, to his shock he saw the five foot tall teddy bear.  



Over its stomach and chest were small red X’s which sealed up the bullet holes that he had seen on it previously.  Its furry feet were stained brown, as were its hands.  There were bits of splattered brown marks across the teddy bear’s otherwise white furry chest.



“What toys do,” Cornelius said as his mechanical head twitched and snapped to the bear, “What the kids tell us to do.”



Marco groaned, trying to crawl to his gun, reaching for it with both hands.  



Just before he reached it, a cable was thrown over Marco’s wrists, pulling them up towards the closet door.  The bear had a small wench setup in the closet, which was tugging Marco up to a sitting position. 



Marco glared up at the teddy bear, tugging at the cable, shocked at how sturdy it was, “Yeah, well she’s dead!  So yah got no one to protect!”



The teddy bear leaned down, a voice echoing from inside of it.  The voice was deep, low, and menacing, “Tammy isn’t the only child here.”



“She said, protect *us*,” Cornelius’s voice echoed, as he looked at the teddy bear, “So that’s up to us,” Cornelius said.



“And what the fuck are you?!” Marco shouted.



“Misfit toys,” The teddy bear lifted up the pistol, its other furry paw moving to the trigger as he placed it to the side of Marco’s head.



Marco’s eyes went wide in fear.



“Always so fucking cocky right up until a bullet flies through you, huh?” The teddy bear’s gruff voice echoed before a gunshot rang out in the abandoned apartment.



…



Crackling through the radio in the apartment some days later is a news broadcast.



*Channel 5 news with an exclusive on the scandal that’s rocked the city!  Today, January 5th, an officer was discovered.  He had killed himself at the scene of what was once considered a raid gone wrong, but now has been revealed as a massive city-wide conspiracy.*  



*A note detailing the events and motives of all people named in the city was mailed in, and signed, by an officer who was part of the raid.  The note mailed were copies of an original suicide note that was found next to his body by federal investigators.*  



*The note detailed the guilt that the unnamed officer felt after a young girl, Tamala Fadel, was killed in the crossfire of the raid that we now know was specifically targeted to assassinate Alderman Theodore Fadel.  The young girl was Alderman Fadel’s daughter.  Federal investigators have made over thirty arrests, including the sitting mayor and several high ranking officers, in what many are calling the biggest corruption scandal in the country’s history.*  



“I got a question, Rux,” Cornelius' voice echoed as gears clicked and whirred as the toy stared at the radio, his attention turning to his partner, “Why’d yah call us misfit toys?”



Rux, the large teddy bear, turned to Cornelius, “Tammy loved those old Christmas shows,” he turned to the radio, “I thought it fit.”



“Think we’re gonna still be like this?  All movin’ and stuff?” Cornelius asked, looking at his hands, “We only woke up 12 days ago.”



Rux nodded, “Don’t worry, Cornelius, Next year,” he heaved as he slumped down on the ground, “Next year, we’ll be back.  There’s other kids that need us,” his eyes dulled as he stopped moving.



“Sounds good to me, Rux,” Cornelius said as his gears and joints slowed to a stop, “See you then, [old friend](http://www.reddit.com/r/The_Guardian_Temple).”",8,1766630903.0,Odd_directions,1,1.0,False

This is on 8 January in L.A.'s Griffith Park, where some of Lost Highway's exteriors and driving scenes are being shot. He is standing in the bristly underbrush off the dirt road between the base camp's trailers and the set, peeing on a stunted pine. Mr. David Lynch, a prodigious coffee drinker, apparently pees hard and often, and neither he nor the production can afford the time it'd take to run down the base camp's long line of trailers to the trailer where the bathrooms are every time he needs to pee. So my first (and generally representative) sight of Lynch is from the back, and (understandably) from a distance. Lost Highway's cast and crew pretty much ignore Lynch's urinating in public, (though I never did see anybody else relieving themselves on the set again, Lynch really was exponentially busier than everybody else.) and they ignore it in a relaxed rather than a tense or uncomfortable way, sort of the way you'd ignore a child's alfresco peeing.""",52,1766630657.0,davidlynch,6,0.98,False

Monday,  in Calgary Alberta,  I put my truck in thebl shop for a door repair.  I went across the street to the Pilot Flying J Travel center to wait it out.  A place to sit and relax, stress free.   So you would think. 

So the outside facilities are having major repairs done.  So the pumps are closed, the main store and showers.

The hair dresser, laundromat, audio store, chrome store and washrooms are open.

There are tables and chairs for people to sit around... and there is a driver's lounge with about 4 chairs and a TV.... which is hardly ever used.  When I first started driving 9  years ago, I noticed that.

Anyway.

So I enter the building, walk around to use the washroom and come out to sit I one of the armchairs.

There are 4 guys sitting in the plaza....very slow because they are doing renovations... I get that..

There are two Indian guys sitting in two of the armchairs soon as you walk in main entrance...  to the left there are two tables and chairs sets... there wasna white guy sitting at one of them.  Across, almost diagonally,  there are two tables with two arm chairs at both.  That is where I decided to sit.  I am a 58 year black man. 

So... I take my high vis jacket and toque off and put it on the arm of one chair, and sit in the other.  I had my black reusable bag with me.  I took out my tablet, phone and Dewalt jump starter that I just bought the day before so i could read the instructions. 

So, I got everything sorted on the table... oh yea, I had a Tim Hortons coffee with me.

So here I am reading the DeWalt manual. And looking around in the meantime.  I see 3 single people (guys) go to the, 1 pair (2 guys friends) and 1 single female.  I see an Asian go by 2 or 3 times.

Didn't have any interactions with anyone whatsoever.... I was reading my material...

So then,  all of a sudden,  I have this big tall Indian security gaurd come over very fast and, I say mildly aggressive saying in very broken English;

Are you construction?:

Me:. Sorry, I don't understand 

Him:  are worker?

are you truck driver?

Me:  yes

Him: let me see your driver's license

Me:  yea, that is not going to happen

Him:  you need to prove you are a tuck driver

Me:  lol, that's funny.

Him:  I have the legal authority to ask for your ID 

ME... I'm told he's not getting my ID... I am sitting minding my own business.... if, with your bullshit need to leave this stupid place because I am sitting here reading minding my own business,  then fine... but I sure as hell don't have anything to prove to you, or have to show you ID... and I left... felt like I was being walked out more like it. 

Anyway, I'm for anyone who doesn't get it... I am sitting there minding my own business.

There is a whole lot more to the story...

Ask as many questions as you like..

I can imagine the comments to come.

Edit.. it is funny that when it comes to subjects like this and folks that have a very legit concern that the post is down voted... and more than likely by white people. 

And gives a shit if it is a private or public place.  You offer someone a place to sit and relax, only to harass them for sitting and relaxing ... hmmmm... I am sure anyone making this a me thing are certainly white people....Jesus ",0,1766630501.0,Truckers,17,0.43,False

does anyone else feel this? any hacks to keep the drink cold for a while....do i need a double wall glass or does it not make a difference?

I’ve been reading some old  threads and watching a bunch of EDC YouTube videos, and honestly I can’t seem to find any true “must‑have” items that apply to me. It feels like a lot of EDC setups are either very situational, fashion- or hobby‑driven.

I’ve just started a digital nomad journey and this is basically all I carry every day:
1. An old Lenovo laptop, mouse, and headset for work and meetings  
2. A vest/tank top (I sneak out for runs or quick workouts)  
3. A T‑shirt, sneakers & hoodie
4. A multi‑country adapter for my iPhones (2 of them), AirPods, and work laptop  
5. YouTube premium for music

I run a small software company solo, so Wi‑Fi is really the only non‑negotiable. I work out of coffee shops for that and head home for dinner when the kids and family are back. I travel internationally to other asian countries once a month.

Looking at all the EDC threads, I keep thinking: am I missing something, or is minimal carry actually the point?

For those of you who swear by EDC, what’s the one thing you carry every day that actually earns its place? i don’t need any keychain or those matte black carabiners (sp)? And why?

Genuinely curious what problems people are solving with their everyday carry.",0,1766630280.0,digitalnomad,11,0.5,False

It’s basically a **real Kali Linux terminal**, but it *looks* like you’re just typing in a **Microsoft Word document**. The whole idea was: when I’m in public (coffee shop, airport, whatever) I don’t want a giant black terminal window yelling *“HEY LOOK I’M HACKING”* to everyone behind me.

**What it is / what works**

* It’s an actual terminal (you can really run commands — not a fake input box)
* Copy/paste works like you’d expect
* You can scroll back and select text normally
* Zoom in/out works (Ctrl+ / Ctrl- / Ctrl + mouse wheel)
* The “page” area is the terminal, and the ribbon stays in place like Word",3,1766630222.0,Hacking_Tutorials,1,1.0,False

(in no particular order) 

Bewitching Amber - PULP (my love): A darker take on classic amber with labdanum, an overdose of non-gourmand vanilla, woody vetiver, pine bark, cardamom and sandalwood musk.

Hippie Spirit - Alkemia: A bohemian love-fest of resinous head shop incenses, sexy skin musk, slightly dirty patchouli, groovy champa blossoms, and flowering cannabis.

2AM in Lafayette - Sorce: Rich vanilla, milky coffee, caramel, and beignets dusted with powdered sugar sound like the perfect comforts after experiencing a haunting.

Honored Ghosts - Alkemia: An offering of Earl Grey tea, black raspberry creams, rosewater-saffron syrup, cinnamon honey, white amber, and vanilla incense.

Hollywood Vamp - PULP: Myrrh resinoid, purple iris, opoponax, absinthe, musk, rosewood, vanilla, ebony, and black amber.
