1gk7io5,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1gk7io5/does_long_distance_driving_make_you_tired_as_well/,Does long distance driving make you tired as well?,"Just curious: I always become extremely tired when I have to drive for more than an hour. My eyes become heavy and it becomes nearly impossible to focus. Then I have to take a break, close my eyes for ten to twenty minutes before I am able to continue. Rinse and repeat. Coffee / energy drinks don't help; I feel zero effect of caffeine. It also doesn't depend on how much I've slept the night before or how much energy I feel. 

All this makes driving longer distances tedious. It takes longer, it is dangerous and it is so exhausting - I often have to take a day to recover from it. 

Now I am curious: is it me or can this be related to ADHD (or possibly to AuDHD)? Do you have the same problem? How do you deal with driving longer distances?",1,1730815741.0,adhdwomen,1,1.0,False
1gk7inr,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1gk7inr/aitah_for_breaking_up_with_my_bf_of_5years_and/,AITAH for breaking up with my bf of 5years and abandoning his entire family?,"I (29F) broke up with my bf (26M) a few months ago. This is going to be a long post but I feel very lost lately, and I think a lot of informations are needed to understand everyone’s point of view. 

First of all, my ex, let’s call him Frank, and I, are French and we were together for five years when I broke up. While we were together, we went through a lot of tough events. His family was a mess, respectfully. His mother was very depressed and living with an abuser. She was illegally living in her ex husbands ( ex’s dad ) apartment because she had nowhere to go, and was trying to end her life at least every month. His father tried to make her leave but since they couldn’t peacefully talk, it turned into arguments, and he decided to go through legal actions to get her out, because he was paying late fees every two months for ex’s mom and her abuser. Which had terrible repercussions on his own relationship to his gf. That was the situation when I met them. My ex was very confused and worried so I decided to step up. I took matter in hands and got his mother out of the cursed apartment, and found her a place to live. I got her a monthly income through state help, and helped to sell the apartment for the father. It helped me build an amazing relationship to them, and my bf was kind of grateful. Sadly, his mother got cancer and when it was his turn to be there for her, he just played dead. He waited for me to take it on me again… unluckily, my father had a bad heart attack and I was already burnt out. I’m the oldest of three, and I had to carry the situation for my family while my ex didn’t stepped up even once. He even blamed me once while I was at the hospital holding my father’s hand, because I didn’t do grocery shopping. I had to keep going for months, burnt out, basically not sleeping and barely eating. He lost his job at the beginning of next year, not so long later, and just fell appart. He cried for days, never did any research, played video games and complained. He never planed any visit to his sick mom, or to his sick grandmother, and even complained when I told him to go when I was at work so I wouldn’t have to drive him. It was honestly draining. I kept finding excuses for him but he was more and more aggressive and rude, and started to blame me for my sexual disinterest. It was like his whole attitude was legit in his mind because I couldn’t have sex with him. He did put a lot of pressure on me about it, was very hurtful and rude. That was last year. I helped him find another job, with his best friend help ( let’s call her Clara ). Clara is a good friend and she helped me a lot while he was horrible. She kept telling him he should treat me better but he never listened. Played victim because his life was miserable and he felt very depressed. Started to claim that he was autistic (I am AuDHD) too which made his life a lot harder. Clara went through a rough break up, and we planed holidays for and with her so she wouldn’t be too sad… except it was terrible. I love her, and I enjoyed time with her, but Frank was awful. He didn’t wanna listen to her “complaints” and ignored us and our desires for the program. He wanted to go drink with his cousin every night, and even had a very hard party the night before we were supposed to leave, forcing me to drive with his car ( I never drove it ) in unknown roads, after I had basically no sleep. He promised to be reliable but never held onto that. It was a turning point to me. He promised, it was supposed to be a moment for me too, to thank me for the efforts I did put in our relationship, and it turned out to be about him again and again. I considered leaving for a long time but decided to stay. We had arguments, very rough ones, because he always said he wanted to marry me, have a house, have children, but he never actually put effort in it. At the beginning of this year I got very sick and the doctors suspected I had brain damages. He still didn’t stepped up. Actually, he lost his job again and tried to leave it to me to find him another job. Once again, Clara stepped up because he couldn’t. He found a job at our local grocery store. We live in a village. Everyone knows everyone and it’s ok with me. However, he worked there for months and everything was ok. I was slowly loosing myself but I guess that wasn’t his problem. I had serious health problems and started to suspect it was due to high blood pressure, almost got in a car crash and realized, while my car was blocked and towed, that the only thing I was thinking when caught in the crash, was it wouldn’t be too bad if I died. Frank was rude to my mother not too long after and it got us in a huge argument… 

It’s useful to precise that I was having coffee at his dad’s, his mom’s, or his gran’s at least once a week, at this point. Spending my time between his family and mine, and the rest trying to take care of my apartment that he never felt the need to help with. I was tired all the time, sometimes so much I wouldn’t even find the energy to get up. My friends were very worried and Clara was driving often driving me to the hospital so I could take my exams. Frank was working a lot but he seemed to enjoy it. Despite my work being almost an hour away, and his five minutes away, he refused to move because he wanted to stay close. 

One day, he went to work and came back, almost three hours after. He was ashamed and crying and moaning, and after a lot of talking, he admitted he had been fired. Because he saw a beautiful customer in the shop, and took a picture under her skirt. He said he was fired, and that the girl was holding charges. I snapped. I didn’t yell nor hit, I just decided it was over. I took a bag and left, I told him we were done. The break up was awful, the apartment belongs to me and I told him to leave. I pushed him to join his cousin who’s living in Australia, and he did. He pressured me, harassed me, he was rude and tried to make everybody think I was cheating on him. He tried to negotiate over furnitures he wouldn’t even take on his trip and never paid for. He was awful and I was scared and shocked so I allowed it. I didn’t tell anyone about the real reasons of the break up and he painted me as the bad guy. I didn’t answer any of his family’s texts, even when his mother cried over the phone and threatened to end herself. Even when his gran cried that she lost her grandson because he was in another country. That’s where I might be the asshole. I abandoned them. I have all his mother’s accounts and I’m not sure she’d be able to actually keep her situation going without me. I took care of his brother and it’s the same for him. His gran never hurt me but I didn’t answer. I was just overwhelmed and exhausted. He called me and yelled at me because a few friends heard about why we broke up. Some of them from me, some of them from rumors because that’s how villages work. Clara heard about it and we became a lot closer. He got crazy about me getting closer to some of our friends he was always jealous about… 

His reasons aren’t unreasonable, I guess. He’s worried for his family and especially his mother. And he thinks I’m taking away his friends. I can understand. But from my point of view, he’s very obviously responsible for what happened to him and I won’t be blamed for bringing to him the consequences of his own actions. AITAH? 

- I’m sorry if things aren’t exactly clear and will answer questions. As said in the beginning, I’m French so I’m also sorry if there are some typos or weird sentences. 

Take care ~

I hope everyone is doing well. I’m currently navigating a bit of a challenge, and I find myself needing a bit of extra help with an upcoming visit/termin to the immigration office in Kalk (Dillenburger Str. 56-66, 51105) to pick up a document. My almost non-existent/limited language skills make it hard for me to fully understand and properly communicate.

I don’t know many people here, so I thought I'd reach out to this community in hopes of finding someone who might be kind and willing to accompany me for some language support. If anyone has some free time and would be open to coming along, I would be immensely grateful. It would really help relieve a lot of stress!

Of course, I’d be happy to offer a coffee, beer, or any small token of thanks in return for your kindness.

Thank you for reading. 

PD: The appointment/termin is flexible, so I can go either on a Wednesday or Friday, as long as it’s between 08:00-12:00. Tomorrow would be ideal, but of course, given the short notice, I'd completely understand if it´s done until Friday morning.

Flip side, he was firm about ONE cup of coffee a day, which seems excessively strict given that I drink about 4 cups/day now and it does not seem to be a trigger, and really… 1 cup a day is gonna hurt.

Can The King of Pop Shape Your Success as a Business Mom?,"https://preview.redd.it/nq3zu8qu8etd1.png?width=1784&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc5a7bd7df5051e732a073016b7e4fae0f50d25f

**Moms**, when you think of **Michael Jackson**, a lot of things come to mind: the ***Moonwalk***, iconic music videos, sequined gloves and of course his angelic voice.  But did you know that beneath the dazzling lights and high notes, **Michael Jackson** was secretly a ***business mastermind***?  That's right, and if you’re a **mom** looking to dominate the **entrepreneurial world**, there’s one book that may be able to teach you how to channel that **MJ magic** into **your empire**, ***”MomPreneurs”*** a very serious well thought out **business guide for moms**.  

Yes, you read that right.  Forget the ***’Thriller’*** album; the real thriller was how **MJ** ran his ***business empire*** from **Neverland**.  And what was **his greatest secret**?  Multitasking – something **moms** have been doing since the dawn of time.  He wrote songs while riding a Ferris Wheel, negotiated record deals while feeding llamas, and choreographed the greatest dance moves of all time during PTA meetings, *(probably)*.  

**Lesson 1: Master the Moonwalk of Business Planning**

While many think ***the Moonwalk*** is just a fancy dance move, it’s actually an ***elite business strategy***.  One step forward, two steps back – just like building a company!  You have to take a few risks, but if you’re slick enough, you can glide past the competition with ease.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn how to **Moonwalk** through your day – from diaper duty to client meetings – without breaking a sweat (or spilling that ever-important cup of coffee).  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 2: Be the Smooth Criminal of Your Niche**

**MJ** wasn’t just the ***King of Pop*** – he was the ***Smooth Criminal*** of branding.  Did you ever wonder how he always stood out in the music industry?  He wore ONE glove.  Genius.  Just like that, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to craft a business brand so memorable that it’ll leave your competition asking, ***“Annie, are you okay?”***  

**Moms,** you don’t need to be the best at ***everything***; you just need to be memorable ***in your business niche.***  And hey, who better to teach you that than **Michael**, the guy who turned a white glove into a legacy?  

**Lesson 3: Build Your Own Neverland (*****AKA*****, Your Dream Business)**

***Neverland*** wasn’t just a place for frolicking around with **Bubbles the chimpanzee**; it was **Michael’s** dream world.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn to create your own version of **Neverland** – a business where work feels like play, and you rule with benevolence (and maybe a couple of Ferris Wheels if that’s your thing).  **MJ** knew how to escape into his passion, and with this book, you’ll do the same – whether it’s running a cake shop, launching a boutique, or starting a ***mom-run empire*** from your kitchen table.  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 4: Harness the Power of** ***The Glove***

Remember how that sparkly glove wasn’t just an accessory but a statement?  Well, in ***MomPreneurs***, you’ll learn how to create your own “glove moment” in the **business world**.  Every **successful entrepreneur** has that one iconic thing that makes them stand out.  **Your business** needs a “glove” – and no, it doesn’t have to be an actual glove, but it does have to be ***fabulous***.  Whether it’s a signature service, product, or your personal flair, ***MomPreneurs*** will help you find it.  

**Final Lesson: Be the Queen (or King if you’re a man) of Your Business**

Much like **Michael Jackson** was crowned the ***King of Pop***, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to become **the Queen of your business.**  Don’t let juggling nap times and conference calls hold you back.  In fact, if ***Michael Jackson*** could write ***Billie Jean*** while building a theme park in his backyard, then surely you can **build a six-figure business** while managing playdates.  

So, do you want to learn ***MJ’s real secrets*** **to success** and apply them to your ***MomPreneur*** journey?  Then grab a copy of ***MomPreneurs*** today.  It might not teach you how to ***Moonwalk***, but it ***will*** teach you how to hustle like the ***King of Pop***. [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

***\*Disclaimer:*** *While this blog post is an absurd exaggeration for comedic purposes, Michael Jackson was indeed an entrepreneurial genius.  However, we cannot confirm that he negotiated business deals with llamas, moonwalked through corporate meetings, or attended PTA events.  But you, dear reader, may certainly be able to conquer the entrepreneurial world like the King of Pop.

Calle Ocho is the iconic street in Miami’s ""Little Havana,"" a neighborhood that truly captures the essence of Cuban culture. Established in the 1960s following the Cuban revolution, Calle Ocho is known as the cultural heartbeat of Miami’s Cuban community. Here are some must-try experiences:

1. Cuban Food If you’re craving authentic Cuban flavors, don’t miss the oxtail at Versailles, along with their famous Cuban sandwich and delicious guava and cream cheese pastries.

Cuban coffee is a must on Calle Ocho. For a strong, sweet espresso-like experience to share, order a colada. If you prefer something closer to a latte, go for a cortadito.

Azucar Ice Cream is also a favorite, featuring unique Cuban-inspired flavors like guava.

1. Cuban Music!

Cuban salsa and jazz are alive on Calle Ocho, with live music that invites people to dance in restaurants, bars, and even on the street! Ball & Chain, a legendary spot dating back to the 1930s, is a must-visit for its rich history and lively atmosphere.

1. Culture!

Domino Park gives you a glimpse into Cuban tradition, with vibrant art and locals gathering to play dominos—a cherished part of Cuban culture. It’s a great place to soak in the atmosphere and watch people bond over the game.

1. History!

Calle Ocho is rich with history. As you walk, you’ll see stars honoring famous Hispanic celebrities. There’s even a local legend that Al Capone served rum here during prohibition.

I had a couple of texts / calls within the next couple years. Randomly asking me when wed slept together. Gave the date. Was told (ok just checking). Then that was it. It happened a few times and Id had a few random drunken phone calls in the night before asking me what im up to. So at the time i told myself it was just drunken moments of reaching out to me.

Couple years ago i was talking with my partner. Im a father to another child now and we'd spoken about our fathers not being there and the worry that this thing from my past might come up and how even though the dates were off and whatever as it was still a worry.

I reached out to the mother, explained what we had been speaking about. And said while they have their family and i had mine. I didnt want to not help support if needed.

Response was its not me. Its (john smith from so and so). Was thanked for reaching out. Relief felt.

About a month or two after i get another message, saying that was a lie, it is me. The dates originally were wrong. But child is happy, has a father figure. Calls him dad etc. So no need to proceed. 

This week i got a message. Told child wants to meet his dad. Happy to do dna test before etc. 


Trying to get my head around everything. What i should do thats best for the child. how Ill deal with telling my child. How the dna test works, Etc. What legal obligations i will have (hence being here). Financial etc. 


Can someone help with any advice Of the legal side of responsibilities? 
Child is 18


Was thinking the best thing for all is to proceed with a dna test. If positive then arrange a coffee or something. Then take it from there.

1gk6z7o,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ghoststories/comments/1gk6z7o/the_ghost_of_a_woman_seen_multiple_times_after/,The ghost of a woman seen multiple times after she was murdered,"Hi everyone. I am starting to post about the paranormal things that I have encountered, as there have been a lot. My mom says that we are more open to the spiritual world, as she has experienced very weird and unexplained things the same way I have. 

This story is one told by my grandmother. I have not encountered it myself, but I would like to hear your thoughts on the story.

My grandmother lives in a small village in Serbia, and there are a lot of weird things happening there. I remember her first telling me this story when I was a bit younger, and we still talk about it. I get creeped out every time we talk about it. So here is goes..

About 30 years ago, when my grandmother first moved to this village, there was a murder that happened two streets from her. An elderly couple that had been married for 40 years got into a big argument. The wife turned away from the husband mid argument, to go outside. He took a heavy metal pan and hit her on the back of her head. She immediately fell down, and he said he couldn’t find her pulse. He claimed that he didn’t want to kill her, and that he just wanted to stop her from going away. He knew that if he called the police, there was no way he could get out of this.

He rolled her body in a carpet and burried her under cement in the basement of their house. Two months went by and his consciousness got the best of him. He went to the police and admitted what he had done. When the police asked him why he admitted to the crime now, he said that she was haunting him. He said every morning she would stand in the kitchen, as if she was alive and make him coffee and breakfast. He would try to close his eyes and open them again, but she wouldn’t go away. The police of course said this was his consciousness getting the best of him, but he claimed she was there and that he wasnt crazy.

He got arrested and the police of course didn’t pay any attention to what the man was saying about the wives ghost. When the police went to talk to neighbors to try and gather information and see if anybody heard or saw anything, they were left shocked. All of the neighbors swore that they have seen her the past two months. One of the neighbors said she came to buy eggs a couple days prior and she was last seen by another neighbor just two days prior going for a walk. They said hi to each other and the neighbor swore it was her.

The police immediately got a new theory, and it was that the man had just killed his wife and went into a shock or a denial and got the timing wrong or that he for some reason was lying. When the police finally got the body out of the cement, it was confirmed that the woman had died at least two months ago, confirming the husbands story.

Even after the date of her murder was released the neighbors still claimed that they had seen her and that that was not possible. After the womans burrial, her two sisters were coming to her house to retrieve some of the items and they claim that they saw her from outside, washing the dishes and smiling to them from the window.

This house is now abandoned and nobody had ever moved in after. I get creeps every time I have to go by that house, and avoid it at all times.",2,1730814247.0,Ghoststories,0,1.0,False

I i know very little about hermit crabs and they honestly scare me a little so I apologize if any of this comes across as dumb/clueless or even insensitive to the hermit crab lovers here.  

So my brother bought my niece a hermit crab at the beach (yeah... I know) back in August and for some reason he ended up keeping it at my dad's place because he's right down the street and comes over frequently. He had been regularly feeding and giving it water for a while and it seemed to be pretty active in the early morning and night until we noticed it had been about a week since we'd heard any activity and assumed it died. another 1-2 weeks passed where he hadn't gotten around to disposing of the crab and taking back the tank, but there hasn't been any kind of bad smell coming from the tank. This morning I was drinking coffee and I swear I briefly heard a sound coming from the tank that sounded like scratching/shifting. The thought occurred to me that the room his cage is in has been getting pretty chilly this past month with some nights dropping into the 30s outside. I looked up that hermit crabs can go into a dormant state if it's below 65, but I'm not sure how long that would realistically last or if he would be able to survive like 2+ weeks of neglect if we'd assumed he died? I wet his sponges and sprinkled some spring water in his tank and moved it to a higher spot away from drafts to see if I would hear any sound again.

I'm not sure how exactly my brother verified his death and I'm afraid to touch him myself. If I could confirm that he is miraculously still alive, I'd go to the pet store and buy him a proper 5gal with a thermometer and heater, but I could easily just be insane and thinking some random sound was the hermit crab LMFAO.

1gk6tgh,https://www.reddit.com/r/musicians/comments/1gk6tgh/the_dos_and_donts_of_auditions/,The do's and dont's of auditions,"So I've had online ads out seeking band members, on and off for about two years now. I wanna have a discussion about this with the musicians on reddit. This is specific to holding auditions in the online space, people you don't already know. Please chime in with your thoughts!

What are some dos and don'ts of auditioning musicians for a band? 
Conversely, what are the dos and don'ts of applying for a band? 

I have a few thoughts as the person running auditions and I welcome your critique. Let's have a conversation about this. Am I being too protective? Am I gatekeeping? Are my expectations too high? 

1. The band is NOT obligated to have you into their rehearsal space upon meeting you. Some folks have tens of thousands of dollars worth of music equipment in their jam spaces and opening these spaces up to a stranger can put that equipment at risk of theft or damage. It is not a waste of time to go for coffee with an interested party before going to a rehearsal space. (This sounds like dating advice...) Establishing rapport prior to a rehearsal is important. Alternatively, the band may choose to setup a temporary rehearsal space at another band members property.

2. Provide what the band your applying to wants upfront. Every band is going to ask to hear you play before they meet you. This doesn't have to be a professional level mixed and mastered recording. A cell phone video or recording of you playing a cover on your instrument is enough to get the point across. Be prepared to share that right away. This helps the band that you're applying to decide if your style and your skills suit their needs and you should be doing this in your opening message. 

3. The band you're applying to should not be expected to share unreleased music with you immediately. This is once again to protect against theft. You're not getting my DAW demos unless I think that auditioning you is worth my time. Which is why I want to hear you first. Once I've made a release under this current project, I'll be far more comfortable sharing my music with strangers, but until then, I don't want my work to be copied and I'm not sharing the music until you've shown me that you're worth my time.

4. If you're applying to someone you dont already know, a well written introduction goes a long way with any professional or artistic interaction. Who are your influences and heroes? When did you start? Why do you partake in this artform? What are your greatest accomplishments as an artist? The number of times I've gotten ""recordings?!"" as an introduction is baffling. I feel like a woman on tinder sometimes with these ads. 

5. Both parties can decide they're no longer interested at any given time. So you've sent me your recordings, I like them, I give you my DAW demos. You listen to them once and say ""yeah I wanna come try out"" a week goes by and you give the recordings a few more listens, now you're starting to jam with them on your instrument and nothing is really meshing. At this point it is totally OK to say you're no longer interested. I have a lot of respect for you for taking the time to try this on your own time and make the decision before our audition day. You haven't wasted anyone's time and you've made an adult decision. Good job!",1,1730813782.0,musicians,2,1.0,False

Kahit minsan ang random ng mga topic, parang ang saya lang ng vibe.

As days went by, naging routine na namin ang mag-usap. Lalo pa kami naging close, to the point na para kaming magkakilala na for years! May mga moments na aasarin niya ako, tapos syempre, ako mapipikon – pero sa totoo lang, natutuwa rin ako 😊 Gusto ko yung energy niya.

Isang araw, naisip namin na mag-meet na. Since busy kami pareho, sinabi ko na okay lang kahit night, basta magkita na kami. Sa SB ang napagkasunduan namin. Nauna siya, tapos nung pagdating ko, nakita ko agad siya at... napasmile lang ako. Ewan ko ba kung bakit ganun, pero parang ang saya ko lang makita siya in person. 

Tinawag ko siya sa pangalan niya, at nagbese-beso kami. Syempre, asar agad si loko dahil late ako. Natawa na lang ako kasi alam kong yun ang style niya – aasarin ako kahit simpleng bagay lang. 

Ang chill ng coffee date namin, walang dull moments. Kwentuhan, tawa, asaran. Alam mo yung pakiramdam na parang ang tagal niyo nang magkakilala? Ganun yung vibe habang kasama ko siya. Yung tipo na hindi mo mamamalayan na ang tagal na palang oras na magkasama kayo.

Dahil late na, kailangan na namin umuwi. Nag-offer siya na ihatid ako. Bago ako bumaba, kiniss ko siya bigla sa lips tapos sabi niya ""nakascore ka ah"" haha saka kami nagtawanan.  Hanggang ngayon, hindi naman nagbago yung pag-uusap namin. Andyan pa rin ang pang-aasar niya, at lagi akong napapatawa.

Which one are you?,"**Coffee Snob:** Oh, look who’s graced us with her presence—a “coffee enthusiast.” Tell me, is that a real title or did you just decide to start talking about beans on Instagram? I bet you measure your coffee “by eye,” don’t you? Very sophisticated.

**Coffee Enthusiast:** Ha-ha. No, I actually do know how to make a good cup. Maybe I don’t spend half an hour in a caffeine lab, but I get the job done. I bet your coffee’s as bitter as your personality.

**Coffee Snob:** Bitter? Only because I don’t pour a bucket of half-boiled water over my grounds and call it a day. Seriously, what’s your “recipe”? A handful of beans, pour water, hope for the best? I’d sooner trust a toddler to brew my coffee.

**Coffee Enthusiast:** Recipe? It’s coffee, not a chemistry experiment. I grind fresh beans, pour hot water, and voilà—coffee. Sorry if that’s too simple for your precious extraction ratios.

**Coffee Snob:** Oh, “simple,” yes, that’s your whole approach, isn’t it? You probably think blooming is what flowers do in spring. Do you even know what a TDS meter is, or is “strong coffee” your only metric?

**Coffee Enthusiast:** Oh, sorry, I must have left my TDS meter in my spaceship. For the record, I know how to balance strength and flavor without going full coffee nerd. Not everyone needs a temperature-controlled kettle to drink coffee, you know.

**Coffee Snob:** Temperature-controlled kettle—let me guess, you boil water in a saucepan and dump it straight on the grounds? Very refined. Look, some of us care about extraction temperature because we actually taste our coffee, not just guzzle it like motor oil.

**Coffee Enthusiast:** Motor oil? Wow, you sound very fun at parties. Do you hand out pH strips before anyone can touch a cup? I’m sorry if I drink my coffee while it’s still hot instead of babysitting it like a newborn.

**Coffee Snob:** Babysitting? Sweetheart, that’s called care. But I suppose care isn’t a priority for someone who thinks “French press” is the height of sophistication. Let me guess, you toss the grounds and water together and think you’ve “mastered the method,” don’t you?

**Coffee Enthusiast:** Well, actually, I do know how long to steep my coffee. But I don’t stand there with a timer, whispering sweet nothings to my beans. Some of us have lives outside of obsessing over a cup.

**Coffee Snob:** Yes, I’m sure your three-minute mud bath is very fulfilling. Meanwhile, I’m dialing in extraction ratios, maximizing flavor potential. But by all means, keep pretending you know coffee while you over-extract your beans into oblivion.

**Coffee Enthusiast:** “Maximizing flavor potential”—you realize you sound like a snobby robot, right? I’m sorry if I drink coffee for the taste and not to win some imaginary brewing award.

**Coffee Snob: Ah, yes, “taste.” Is that what you call that burnt sludge you brew? Let me guess:** you get “fruity notes” and “rich body,” because that’s what the bag says? Or do you just make it up as you go?

**Coffee Enthusiast:** Oh, right, because only you can taste flavors. I bet you taste “notes of bergamot” in dishwater. I don’t need a dictionary of tasting notes to know good coffee.

**Coffee Snob:** Bergamot? You wish! With your “methods,” all you’re tasting is astringency. But sure, keep sipping your… interpretation of coffee. Just try not to call it brewing, okay? That’s offensive to the rest of us.

**Coffee Enthusiast:** Brewing, interpretation, whatever. You’re one step away from inventing new rules just to make coffee sound harder. Go on, tell me how my “handful of beans” is the reason coffee culture’s in decline or something.

**Coffee Snob:** Oh, honey, you are the decline! I’m out here adjusting grind settings by microns while you throw “just enough” grounds in a grinder, as if “enough” even means anything. Might as well grind rocks while you’re at it.

**Coffee Enthusiast:** You know what, I think I will grind some rocks, just for you. Because clearly, coffee doesn’t matter to you unless it requires a PhD to enjoy it. Have fun with your… microns.",0,1730813190.0,IndiaCoffee,0,0.5,False

Visually, they're a match made in heaven. Sofia has this cute, petite look with a super small face, and Jarren has this masculine, edgy vibe. Their height difference and skin tones complement each other perfectly. They'  re giving me major teenage couple vibes, like straight out of a drama.  I mean, it makes sense, right? They'  re both teenagers, so it's totally natural for them to have that young, fresh energy. I remember seeing pictures of them at a coffee bar (you can see some below), and even though they weren'   t super touchy-feely, the tension and chemistry between them were undeniable.

And personality-wise, they'  re just a great match. Their styles of speaking, talents, and personalities are different, which creates a really interesting dynamic. They'   re not boring at all, it'  s like they bring out the best in each other.

I’m still a Kairen stan through and through, but Jarfyang’s definitely got me hooked. But then, I'  m really hoping they all focus on their solo careers for now.  You know how toxic love teams can be in showbiz, right? It's just not worth the drama.  I'  m just really appreciating their chemistry, and I think they'  re both amazing on their own.

I am a 22 year old female and I am really really tired of being sick. At this point I feel like it is better to just finish it all and not have to suffer like this anymore.

There was not a single day where I felt 100% good physically for the past 4 months. Everything feels like I am swimming through a current even simple tasks like getting a shower and making a coffee.
I had gastrointestinal issues for 3 months and I was in so much pain 24/7. It got better but now I had an ear infection and a viral cold recently and constantly feel extreme fatigued and dizzy. My brain fog is bad and I feel like a shell of my former self. I used to have so much energy and zest for life, but now I just feel like I bring the mood down and I am a burden to everyone in my life.

At this point I am so tired of endless doctor appointments and tests, I am just slowly giving up this fight.

I have loving friends, family and boyfriend, but I am so scared that everyone will leave me if I don't get better.I am on track to graduate from university with good grades next summer. I am finding it so difficult to get school work done when I am feeling like this. I have no energy to think about my future and apply for any postgraduate roles or grad schemes. I see my peers working towards their dreams and I feel sad that I am surviving on day to day basis. 
 
I know people have it much worse than me. I am incredibly grateful to have some finances, roof over my head and good people in my life. I just feel like I can't keep going like this for much longer.

I am not looking for anyone to feel sorry for me,just needed to let those thoughts out.

The green days are low-grade pain think 2-3/10, yellow is 4-6/10, 6+/10 is red. Blue is “pain free” but on these days i still have pressure in my head and occasional “surges” of pain that last a few minutes.

Ive been on botox since January and had a few months this year looking like
October, that is, a little better. Im also on Ajovy, which ive been on for 3 years. Before ajovy my months were maybe 15 red days each month and every other day yellow. So even that was an improvement.


🧠NAUSEA🧠

But im still suffering, everyday. Recently (past 2-3 months) i’ve started developing nausea with my migraines, and while
it’s relatively minor and i almost never actually throw up, its new to me and i HATE it. I used to feel so “lucky” that i “only” had bad pain and no nausea. Well now its like nausea even when the pain isnt bad and it makes me feel
so woozy.


🧠QUILIPTA SOON/ FEAR🧠

Im supposed to be quitting Ajovy this month and starting Quilipta. But im scared. I know that Ajovy works by slowly building up in your body with every injection. What is Quilipta doesnt work at all for me and i lose all these years of progress from ajovy and go back to being completely bedridden?


🧠CONSTIPATED/DIARRHEA EVERYDAY🧠

Another part of my fucking suffering is that i am ALWAYS constipated throughout the day. I wake up everyday and drink coffee and smoke cigarettes until im able to poop, and when it comes out its all diharrea. Ive had this problem for 3 years, but the past 6 months its getting intensely worse to the point where i cant leave the house for 3 hours after i wake up, because i feel sick until i can poop and i have to wait to poop. Im going to the doctor to finally talk about it this week.

I know ajovy can cause this (?). But i also have rectal prolapse now. I hope i get fucking help.


🧠EATING PROBLEMS🧠

Half the time i cant eat, i just cant stomach it. After i eat i feel more nauseous, while im
eating i feel nauseous. This leads me to wait until im dying of hunger and absolutely stuff my face. Sometimes eating improves my migraine, sometimes it makes it worse. I feel faint sometimes. I often have to lay down after eating, guaranteed have to if its a big meal.

Im going to ask my doctor to check me for insulin or blood sugar problems.

🧠DEPRESSION🧠

Im so fucking depressed about all of this. Im 24, im seeing my friends getting their education, jobs, socializing and being free while i feel stuck in the prison that is my
own body. While im stuck begging the government to recognise my disability (i did recently get approved though! Just need to ask them why im apprently paying a 50% tax rate on my disability income).

Why the fuck do i deserve to live in constant pain, discomfort in my body.

When I travel, I don’t take my medication, so I’m not very consistent with it.

During COVID, it felt like the medication completely stopped working. I lost all motivation to do chores or work and stopped working out. I tried increasing the dose to 15 mg, but that just made me jittery and disrupted my sleep without actually helping me get things done.

I wasn’t much of a coffee drinker, but one day, McDonald’s messed up my order and gave me a large iced coffee instead of a Coke Zero. That coffee had a “limitless drug” effect on me: I had a great workout, finished pending assignments, cleaned my room, and even started thinking up stand-up comedy bits. I voice-recorded my ideas, bought a domain name, applied for an ABN, opened a new bank account, went grocery shopping, cooked a healthy meal, and even went for an evening walk. However, I couldn’t sleep that night, and as a result, I lost all my momentum the next day. I don’t remember much about the following days, but I ended up in a rut.

This experience was about 3-4 years ago. Since then, I’ve started drinking coffee and energy drinks more regularly. I was also taking 20 mg of fluoxetine but quit it cold turkey in 2022 because I felt emotionally numb (anhedonia) and struggled to feel anything at all.

This year, I’ve been more consistent with my medication, taking it three days a week along with two medium cups of coffee to get through my tasks. Without Adderall or coffee, I find it nearly impossible to get anything done. My current job involves driving for long hours—about 10-12 hours a day, Wednesday through Saturday. On my days off (Sunday-Tuesday), I struggle to even go out for a coffee or take my meds.

A couple of months ago, after talking to my psychiatrist, I restarted fluoxetine at 20 mg, but it had the complete opposite effect on me this time. I felt demotivated and disconnected, spending entire days lying in bed, binge-watching TV shows, and ordering DoorDash. After seven weeks, I stopped taking it because it completely derailed the progress I’d made this year. Those six weeks were critical, and I’ve been trying to catch up ever since, but it’s been challenging.

Unfortunately due to changes in circumstances I can’t see the psychiatrist anymore, I have few repeats left and will try to get my permit transferred to a local gp. 

After skimming through this sub I’m really keen on trying vyanase and modafinil as I feel that might have positive effects on me but not very sure. I did try valdoxan at one point but was having nightmares and didn’t see any positive effects so stopped and continued with fluoxetine. 

I just read a post that coffee and adderall might not be a good idea. Can someone explain why?

-

I have Anorexia, Bulimia Nervosa, BED and Orthorexia diagnosed. 

A few years back i did a lot of laxatives (up to 40 pills a day, recommended dose is maximum 2) this gave me horrible stomach ache (of course) so i looked for an alternative option, that’s when i unfortunately stumbled across a documentary of a woman doing coffee enemas at home. 

But I didn’t want to go through all the trouble with hooking myself up and waiting for hours for it to flush out. 

So what I do is I screw off the shower head and use the shower cable directly in, fill with water (usually hotter than what I would shower with) and then relieve myself on the toilet, this goes on and on, sometimes for an hour. I’ve tried stopping as I’ve been doing this for years, but I think it gives me some kind of comfort and control when things around me are uncomfortable and uncontrollable. 

I was doing it the most and for hours when I was with my abusive ex, as the locked bathroom was the only place I could be alone and not be beaten. 

Sometimes I get horrible stomach pains and then I relieve myself and it gradually goes away, sometimes “mucus” comes out in strings - which must be a red flag of something now being right. 

I recently stopped for a weekend and I got really constipated, cold sweating on the toilet trying to get it out without doing the enemas, but I felt better overall (probably because of electrolytes not being flushed both with purging and enemas).

There’s also sometimes blood in my stool, and I’ve had moments where blood was dripping from my rectum, indicating a rift somewhere, obviously. It usually goes away within a few days. 

I feel tired, can get headaches and I’m in a lower mood and energy afterwards, but it’s like an addiction, if I feel too full in my stomach or I feel fat I will immediately go for the enema option instead of going for a walk because it gives me the instant satisfaction of getting rid of the heavy feeling. 

I would say I’ve been doing this on and off since 2019+- a few months. 

My questions is; 

what kind of long term effects will this have on me? 

Can you tell me something scary about this so I will stop once and for all? Why should I stop doing this?

Have I effed up my system permanently doing this? 

To some this may be the most bizarre thing you’ve ever heard, and to some you may understand the need of feeling in control (usually goes hand in hand with most EDs) but also because of CPTSD and severe childhood trauma. 

I want to stop doing this I just need someone to care enough to tell me why and how. 

Please, share your insight, preferably as a health care worker.

I haven’t looked up any spoilers so I know nothing about the other relationships but do they all really make you work for it too? From his responses to Rook’s flirting I would honestly have had no idea if he was into her or not if I didn’t know that you could romance anyone. Then there’s the scene where you almost kiss, which was such a tease! Like, I get it, you’re wrestling with an actual inner demon but you can still kiss her! 😫

I wasn’t a fan of Rook’s responses to him cooking (though maybe that was just the EN accent VO delivery?) and can’t remember if it’s at this point you commit to a romance with him, but if so, how are you commiting to a relationship without actually talking about it? Or is that decision hint just telling the player that this locks you in, but Rook & Lucanis still aren’t in an actual relationship?

If anyone has gotten past this, please don’t share specifics but is there a scene where they actually get together? & I assume there’s an “intimate” cutscene at some point?

1gk60h6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gk60h6,Is the white interior a bad idea…? What’s your experience?,"Hi guys, this is my first post on Reddit, so try not to rip me to shreds. 

Technically the interior I like is called light grey, but that’s a whole bunch of garbage, so I’ll be calling it white. 

I am looking to purchase a new 2025 Santa Fe AWF Hybrid Limited. Exterior colors are currently secondary to me, but I do love the white, blue, dark grey, and y’all have been really selling me on the green. I really REALLY love the white interior, but people, including some of the salesmen, have been recommending against it. 

Here are some things I need to consider. 

1. WORK 
I am a 28F in the sunbelt with a construction company. I do work a lot from my home office but also project manage and design custom homes and large scale renovations. Rarely am I loading 2x4s in my car, most of that is delivered now a days, but I will be getting a roof rack, so this should completely negate me throwing lumber or long materials in my car. All that being said, it’s possible I will be picking up grout from the tile store, loading chandeliers, toting around samples, etc. That will all live in my trunk. 

2. FAMILY
We plan to start a family sometime next year and I hope to have this car for 5-7 years

3. LOCATION
I live in Texas and I am super concerned about black getting HOT and baking in the sun

4. FEMININITY (hear me out)
This is maybe a personal problem, but do we think the pecan interior is more masculine? I want something to feel chic in, especially if I am having to drive clients around. Also, not a huge fan of the brown and black combo :( but will be open to it if it makes the most sense for my lifestyle. 

5. CLUMSINESS 
I do have a coffee addiction and I have in the past been guilty of spills and choking/ coughing it up (albeit that was once!!!)

6. PREFERENCES 
White is my favorite but I’m worried about stains and my hot yoga/ getting j. Sweaty several times a week
Brown is ok but I don’t like the dark headliner and the masculine feel
Black is ok but it looks like it would get hot. At least it has a light and bright headliner so I get a bit of the white feel. 

Thank you for getting this far if you have read up. I’m happy to keep wipes in my car to mop up inevitable coffee spills. Idk if I’m delulu go get white, but I really just love it. ",7,1730811341.0,HyundaiSantaFe,13,0.82,False

She came to my life around late 2016 or early 2017 … when I and my mother were asked to come with my aunt to give her the second opinion whether she should buy the dog… the seller lied about her age saying that she was around 1-2 years old and wasn’t opened to share much where she came from but we suspected she was illegally imported from China…. She had a terrible fur condition … we could tell that she wasn’t taken care properly …but she had such a fun and positive vibe which immediately gave me and my mother a strong impression … when I took her leash from the seller for a short walk, she was so happy, jumped and screamed with excitement … she kept holding eye contacts and jumped alongside with me … I felt in love and ended up buying her instead of my aunt …. We drove her to the pet hospitality in the next few days and they told me that she was actually quite mature and told us that she was probably around 5-8 years old given her teeth condition… my mother was quite upset at first as she felt being deceived but I just felt happy that she became a part of my family. Even though she was a very tiny poodle and the oldest of our pack, her spirit and personality are totally opposite… she liked to jump from high places and our heart jumped out of our chests few times worrying when we witnessed that… she loved to run in every directions when we were out for walks … she even somehow managed to climb on the rooftop of our house which we still figure out how she could do that…. She loved rubbing her back into the ground and let the sun shining straight to her belly… whenever we were out for coffee, she always made sure she was on our laps and our both hands had to be on her back. Otherwise, she turned around and scratched our hands gentler to signal as a friendly reminder… I just loved everything about her … she was very lovely dog … she grew old with us … I realized she started to lose some of her teeth and her eyes wasn’t as bright as before and in the recent months, she wasn’t active as before … she didn’t like to be hold or pet… she always returned to her cage immediately after eating … she didn’t like to be bother by other dogs of our packs… I told myself that oh well Anna wasn’t a baby anymore and it sadden my seeing her aging quickly and gradual loss of balance and sight… but still showed her spirit when she was hungry … I love her more for that…. I looked at her and told myself that we were getting old together and I have some medical issues myself too … I won’t never abandon her …. Then an incident happened two days ago and my mother suddenly locked her together with a different roommate of the pack …and when Anna was bitten so many that she needed the surgery right away … and she couldn’t make it due to her age and severe bites… my mother was so shocked and she couldn’t expect it to happen as both have been raised together for 7 or 8 years but I was so mad to find out her reckless attention … I told her that everyone always could tell Maia (the other dog) likes to play rough at other dogs … how could she locked these both together  … she indirectly murdered Anna … Anna‘s the last two days were painful … it broke my heart to holding her body and I cried so hard at the hospital … her body was so light and soft like a leather … her body was still warm and I wanted to hold her forever …. 
I kept telling her to stay strong for at least 3-5 days and if she could do that, she could recover but she couldn’t , she left us with such a damaged and painful body … I wanted us to grow old together … I wanted her to leave this world with a good quality of life … I wanted her to die due to her age not because of being tortured… I resent the other dog so much and I hate looking at her … 

I tried to go to some peaceful places to take some time away from the darkness at home but they are somehow closed today … it seems that Anna is telling me to stay at home …I miss her so much … I dont know … I wanted to hold her longer and longer …. ",67,1730811107.0,seniordogs,6,1.0,False

1gk5vz1,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1gk5vz1/rekindle_went_bad/,Rekindle went bad. ,"Well me and my now ex broke up probably 3 weeks ago after dating for 7 years. She decided to end things with me since I didn't do certain romantic things that she wanted in the relationship. I apologized for not doing said things like dancing in the kitchen with her, making coffee, going on big vacations to the beach and so on! I was really upset at the time of her breaking up with me of course, same goes for everyone. But I knew I could do these tasks or little wants she needed in the relationship. So we ended up talking it out and came to the conclusion that we would still work on things exclusively of course per my request but she still needed to move out of the apartment. We'll I ended up helping her move out since no one else was able to assist her which really sucked for me to help her move out, once again I voiced this opinion to her that I felt un-easy helping since I didn't really want her to move out in the first place.

Now 2 weeks pass with her being moved out we are going on little dinner dates and hanging out at my place watching movies and what not. She's telling me that she still lovess me and misses me, talking about our days at work and what we are doing at home. Sounds like it's going good right? Well 3rd week rolls around and I'm off work for a week. I mentioned this too her and told her I was willing to hangout anyway of the week. She later stated that we will see what I got going on. We ended up hanging out one day it was a Monday we got some dinner and ice cream. It was awesome we were all cuddly and it just felt like a normal relationship again really. Didn't hang out the rest of the week after this since I BELIEVED she worked. Well come to find out she was on a flight with another guy so that she could go on a vacation. This said guy has flirted with her in the past I remembered him from like a year ago or soo on. I sort of text her flipping out trying to figure out why she was hiding this from me.. I also stated that she really, really hurt my feelings by doing this. Wait for the kicker here..

She said it's okay he know we are working on things and isn't going to hit on me! 

I was still really upset about her even going on the vacation anyways with this said guy.. regardless if he's not hitting on her, like I thought we were working on things but seems like she's testing the waters you know. She also seemed angry after me telling her I was upset and that I was over reacting. Well it's been a few days now I was sort of waiting for an apology from her, but all I see is pictures of her just having a great time while I'm sitting at the house just crying.. lost.. and confused... part of me thinks she will try to contact me when she gets back from the vacation, so that she doesn't ruin her vacation chatting with me.. but i don't know if I should talk to her anymore after this.. 

I really could use some advice here, so I'm not dwelling in my thoughts.",1,1730810943.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

Downtown DC businesses board up windows, doors ahead of Election Day

WASHINGTON - As D.C. works to increase safety measures ahead of Election Day, people are also doing what they can to keep their businesses safe by boarding up their glass windows and doors.

Some of the business owners who spoke with FOX 5 said it’s something they have to do in case violence breaks out in the District. 

On 17th and Pennsylvania, a number of restaurants, coffee shops and even a McDonald's are boarded up from top to bottom. It’s expected that more places will do the same throughout the city — especially businesses near the White House.

""Because of protection and just to be prepared,"" said Marcus Donovan, who manages Pow Pow in Northeast.

Donovan says he has more than plywood protecting his restaurant located in Franklin Square. 

""It’s like a fortress,"" Donovan said. ""If we had a boat it would be even better.""

It’s a structure the building’s property manager built. Donovan says he wishes this wasn’t the reality but it has to be done and he can’t rely on the city right now.

""It would be nice if the city was more prepared for Jan. 6, although we understand the scenario and situation with Trump but it’s the whole thing of putting it together for ourselves,"" he said. 

Over on 13th and Pennsylvania, even more buildings are being boarded up.

""This was our first time and eating inside there is a very different feeling when all of the windows are boarded up,"" David Lauder told FOX 5. 

Lauder has called the city home for almost 30 years. He says it’s never felt like this during elections until recently.

""It saddens me that our elections are free, then we are locked up by boarded-up windows and our beautiful city is diminished,"" Lauder said. 

Others who live in the District say they think the boards are a bit much, and an inconvenience.

""I don’t think it’s necessary,"" DC resident Phillip White said. ""It shouldn’t happen.""

FOX 5 asked one business owner how long they plan to keep the boards up. He says at least for the next week, then they'll remove the boards and put them back up in early January.

1gk5vae,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1gk5vae/is_it_a_justifiable_path_to_work_as_a_chef_and/,Is it a justifiable path to work as a chef and barista with the end goal of owning my own cafe? Should I still apply to unis?,"Not sure which sub was right for this, there were a few about careers. Sorry if I got it wrong. The question is basically the title, but I'll elaborate a little. Reading back after writing, I'm sorry about how long it is. If you don't want to read it, my explanation of my main question is at the bottom. Thanks in advance.

Some context (can skip): I'm a 17 year old in Australia. For years I basically accepted that I would go into higher education at some famous uni and do a pretty standard job in some standard field. Most of last year, while I was studying year 11 legal studies a year early I was dead set on being a lawyer. Throughout this year though, of putting in hours of work and burning myself out for the little satisfaction that comes from good grades, I've gradually changed my tune. I don't really like sitting down for the entire day doing something I don't like as I procrastinate, and I especially don't like having to then bring that work home.

I currently work at a small, local cafe and I actually love it, most of the time. I love atmosphere, the feeling during a rush. I really love making coffee, and it became a hobby of mine outside of work. I think part of the reason I like working there is because I can just do long shifts where I can focus completely on the job and not think about what I have to do at school or what annoying thing happened beforehand or what I'm doing next week, it's all about there and then. There's instant feedback about how I'm doing from how the coffee looks and customer feedback, and I can adapt what I'm doing to respond to that.

Earlier this year, I watched The Bear (the tv series) and it became my entry point into an interest in being a chef as well. I started doing prep shifts in the cafe kitchen just to try, and while I don't enjoy it as much as making coffee, I don't mind it.

While it may sound like I prefer just working in these environments, I often find myself thinking about how I would improve things, how I would do things differently, drinks I would add to the menu etc. if I owned the place. I'm something of a perfectionist, and I like paying attention to the details and making minute changes to improve the overall experience.

Question explanation: My parents think I should still apply to unis, pick a course and all that. I haven't told them about how I want to own my own cafe. I have been on a tour of William Angliss (a culinary school) with my dad, but that's it. I don't even want to consider unis, and I don't really want to go through the whole exam process. As a really brief overview, I want to take a year/half a year to travel and work (I have family overseas so I don't think this wouldn't be super taxing financially) before going to William Angliss. After a year long commercial cookery course, with possible other courses such as kitchen management, I would work as a chef/barista for several years, trying to learn how different places do things, how different systems work etc.. Then, when I have the financial means and feel somewhat ready to make the leap, I would try to open my own place. If it failed and closed, then I would rinse and repeat. Maybe I'm romanticising the whole thing but I really love the idea of having my own cafe that I could make changes to and watch (hopefully) grow and flourish.

Is it a justifiable career path to seek out jobs that might not pay well at all simply out of wanting to learn about the industry? Should I still through the whole process of year 12 and do exams and apply to unis (I really hate school atm and am not really considering unis. If I change my mind, mature age is a pathway for people older then 21, and unis always want your money so I'm not completely closing that door)?

Again, I'm sorry for how long this turned out. Any advice is appreciated, I'll try to answer questions if I missed something. If it's the wrong sub just delete it or whatever and I'll post it somewhere else.",3,1730810880.0,careerguidance,1,0.8,False

You think I used you for your intellect, but I actually just felt safe with you. I wasn’t as scared about not knowing things while next to you. I believed you to be a soft place, for my insecurities and self doubt, to land. You made me want to do better, be better, because I thought you did mean those things you said to me.

You sounded so sincere with the caring things you had told me, just to turn around and speak so poorly of me. That hurt me so much. Those words you said to our friend, about who you believe I am, ring in my head all the time. I don’t think you understand how much you had meant to me. Your earnest words made me believe in myself. If you lived inside my mind, you would know what that meant to me.

For all your talk about always caring about those that you had fallen for, you sure turned me into a villain. I couldn’t meet you where you were, but that didn’t mean you weren’t special to me. I truly enjoyed you for the person you were, your interests, our interests. I admired your intellect and sense of humor. I valued your friendship and appreciated how you wanted to know my thoughts and perspectives on things. Things in which I didn’t even believe anyone would care for my thoughts on. I was depressed and was shutting the world out, but in general, you had a calm energy that I didn’t tire of.

You didn’t believe me when I told you that I didn’t know about your feelings. In retrospect, I guess I should have listened closer to the lyrics in those songs you sent me. I thought you were just sharing some of your favorites, but upon reflection, I don’t believe you would do so without careful consideration of my perception. Unfortunately for us both, I historically never think anyone has interest beyond friendship with me. This is something I should fix, since it keeps getting me into trouble.

You talked about me as if I was some siren, intent on manipulating in order to get things. I really don’t understand. I don’t understand how you could turn around and say that. I understand your pain, but I thought I showed you in my own ways that I cared. My love language (platonic and not) is being the giver in gift giving. I thought that was clear by me always getting you second coffees and such.

I do understand you put in a lot of effort in this regard, even if it didn’t always pan out. It’s funny that we both tried to surprise each other with tickets to the same ballet. You beat me, of course. Even though I got sick and ended up missing out, I still saw that effort and valued the thought you put into it.

This one you aren’t aware of, since I did it as a surprise for you, but I had gotten us tickets to watch that movie you always referenced. It was showing later in February, but things blew up before we could go. I considered trying to get them to you somehow, but with your level of analysis, you would have known it was from me. I didn’t think that kind of thing would be helpful for you to be aware of. I ended up giving the tickets away. It felt wrong, and honestly would have been really sad, to go with someone besides you.

I never replied to your final words. I was scared of making the situation worse and wanted to make sure I was navigating it with care. I asked our friend, with discretion, for help on navigating and formulating a response. However, they were gone for a while, and by the time they recovered, it had been weeks of not responding to you. You said you needed to heal. I wanted you to heal and it almost felt selfish to respond in the end. You said I wouldn’t miss you.

You were wrong.

1gk5moc,https://i.redd.it/1yxpxuk1v2zd1.png,Dragon Age Veilguard REVIEW,"I have played it for a while and I am a long standing Dragon Age fan but I wanna give my honest review. The good and the bad. Overall I think the game is mid.

Honestly I know how most people here and I am genuinely gonna start with the good. There is good.

The BEST: Character Creator - No I know you saw the game journalist qunari. If your character looks bad it's skill issue. Yeah the scar are a bit cringe. Honestly though it is one of the better character creators in a modern game. You can't get as derpy as Elden Ring but you CAN be derpy, or good looking and there are options. You can make cute women, or badass looking men, and while I am not THE BEST my Qunari is definitely better than what is shown in CC

(My rook pictured)

The good: 

The (Male) Companions - I have very little complaints about Lucanis Emmrich and Devin (I romanced one of them). They have decent dynamics, they have decent personalities and quests. They are competently acted and are allowed to have pitfalls and flaws and to be the underdog that prevails. Emmrich I expected the least out of but honestly his whole deal is quite well executed. For the women I must say Neve is a decent character but I wish her voice over was less flat. Bellara is a mixed bag. She has GOOD moments and terrible moments.

Adding the Bad of companions here - Taash and Harding are absolutely a net negative to this game. Almost all of the cringe clips are centered around them for a reason. Taash genuinely acts like a 14 year old while being a special Qunari while being a dragon expert. If they removed either the 14 year in old behaviour OR her being a young adult dragon expert I'd be more inclined to accept them - The game has to acknowledge they are immature and grating, but the current result is somehow an unholy fusion of the worst parts of Sera and Bull with none of the positives.

And Harding is so ""quirky"" she keeps hopping between extremes.

The level design and side quests - To be fair I barely care for the main plot - side quests have (mostly) stronger writing. I wish the main quests deemed less urgent so it doesn't look as detached. There was one VERY NICE natural pause from the main story. I wish there were more moments where your associates were looking for intel. Genuinely a good idea but inderused.

Combat - Combat feels nice. I know people say how telegraphed enemies are but honestly hordes of enemies can get challenging, and if you dont do certain side quests that give hp buffs you get 2-3 shot. Your and your team's build 

Spoiler zone below this line.

Act 2 I must praise this bit of the story. The start was pretty weak up until the dragon attacks. There is one bad element to act 2 genuinely. And it's Taash

However act 2 (Weisshaupt is the beginning point for this review) is a fight against an Arch Demon and a god, and unless you are very overleveled or playing low difficulty the section and the final boss battle are tests of sheer endurance. And at the end you don't win. In many ways you lose and barely escape. Its a good wake up call as the party has even in story, lucked their way this far but now the luck got them only so far. Issues must be resolved and you're given the pause for side quests. Then you sort of begin solving team issues and fight dragons again, but you are again not ready as you again get humbled and barely escape from the gods. A good detail is that after that your feats in the story suddenly shrink. You're no longer attempting to kill a god, you are avoiding them while freeing elves. You are using side routes to annoy them, you learn and you try to make them make a mistake.

Weisshaupt is also the only time the game dares to go a bit darker. 

This is the good section. This game is not a complete waste of time and for a few moments it's pretty good. Issue is the good often contrasts with the bad.

The BAD

I must reiterate - Taash. This game would have been 1-2 points higher out of 10 for me if Taash simply wasnt there (6/10). Why can't I do like Sera and just not recruit them. Taash is annoying but the cringe clips don't cut it. Her mother is once again airbrushing the Qun. With Iron Bull it made complete sense as he is a spy.

The Dragon Age IP. - If Veilguard was just the sequel to inquisition and nothing else? It would be an okay sequel. But compared to the older games? The tone is off, the retcons are so severe its dizzying, the ending tease? Terrible. New blight is a Warframe infestation rip off but not half as threatening. The lore retcons are terrible. This game would function as a decent franchise paired with inquisition... But the general vibe of the game is so far removed. The lack of choices from other games further solidifies that. Only Inquisition matters.

The Fade - They just decided not to make the fade scary and dangerous anymore. Don't get me wrong the Crossroads and Lighthouse are explicitly special safer pathways, but there are genuine hinest to god Fade sections that are not half as scary. Even inquisition managed to make staying in the fade seem like you will lose your mind if you stay a second too long and eacaping an urgent and hard goal. The fade here is the regular world with funky gravity and a color grading and vignette effect. 

Newspeak - This to be fair has ALWAYS ALWAYS BEEN AN ISSUE for Dragon Age sequels. I think Veilguard is the worst though. Why in the fade is my ally shouting ""SNIPER"" for a ranged enemy. Not threat at range, not spellcaster they say ""sniper"". Are gund canon to Dragon Age now? Fu mean sniper? 

Act 1 - My god up until the dragon attacks this game is a snore. Major quit moment for most is the Bellara intro quest. Honestly real. The game will NOT pick up until act 2.

Roleplay: This game is very very light on roleplay. You are the goody two shoes hero. Your only REAL choice is being the mom friend, the sarcastic rogue, or the rigid pragmatic friend. Even in Inquisition you can be an asshole and an eventual tyrant. Here the worst acts you can do is ""I am well meaning but my advice had bad consequences."" 

Telling not showing and overstating the quirks - the game definitely has amateurish execution on many things. I often have the ""okay I get it"" reaction to a Character quirk being emphasized 72 times (Lucanis and his coffee addiction for example). Jokes and serious moments are always a bit.... Overexplained and I think they would land with simpler dialogue. One example of a scene ruined by that is my choice to urge Harding in her side quest to embrace her anger, stop being a people pleaser and embrace the titan rage in her blood. It would have been a good moment and redeemed Harding partly, but my Rook when on a 30 second overly wordy tirade which cheapened the moment. There are A LOT of good moments that could be great if this issue was not persistent.

Overall a 6/10. Game can honestly be fun if you aren't a dragon age lore nerd and don't do Taash's quest.",13,1730810108.0,MauLer,7,0.89,False
1gk5ih3,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gk5ih3,Biochar for potting compost.,"Now that the cold weather is (almost) among us I have fired up the multi stove. I've been thinking for a while on how I could make biochar utilising the stove, well today I made a few batches. 

I got an old biscuit tin from a few Christmases ago and poked some holes in the lid, fill with woodchip and some bones from the compost, and popped it in the fire. 

How does this relate to gardening? The aim is to add this to my potting compost for next year, I make my own compost and sieve then bake for seedlings but I never have enough. I want to sieve enough soon to fill a whole compost bag which should last me the year. You're ""supposed"" to inoculate the biochar using compost tea of some sort, but I'm just going to pee on it and make it a coffee, let it soak and then add all of that to the potting compost. 

Pictures show before, during, and after. I'm on the third batch, hopefully if this trial goes well I can speed it up by having multiple tins ready to go, as at the minute I have to take it out, cool it, empty it, refill, etc. So with more tins I can have a few on the go and a few waiting to go in. I'll also be doing some painting soon, so I'll keep those cans and be able to do much more in a single can than two biscuit tins will. ",4,1730809723.0,GardeningUK,2,1.0,False

1gk58jr,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gk58jr/burger_king_parent_restaurant_brands_falls_short/,Burger King parent Restaurant Brands falls short of Q3 revenue expectations,"Restaurant Brands International on Tuesday reported quarterly earnings and revenue that missed analysts’ expectations as domestic same-store sales growth for all four of its chains fell short of Wall Street estimates.

Here’s what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: 93 cents adjusted vs. 95 cents expected

Revenue: $2.29 billion vs. $2.31 billion expected

Restaurant Brands reported third-quarter net income attributable to common shareholders of $252 million, or 79 cents per share, unchanged from a year earlier.

Excluding items, the company earned 93 cents per share.

Net sales climbed 24.7% to $2.29 billion, largely thanks to the company’s acquisitions of its largest U.S. Burger King franchisee and its Popeyes business in China earlier this year.

The company’s worldwide same-store sales grew just 0.3% in the quarter. Burger King, Firehouse Subs and Popeyes all reported same-store sales declines in their home markets.

Burger King’s same-store sales fell 0.7%. The chain is in the middle of a turnaround in the U.S., but consumers are also spending less at restaurants, reigniting the value wars between Burger King and its rivals.

Popeyes reported same-store sales declines of 4%. In June, the chain launched boneless wings as a permanent menu item for the first time in its history.

Firehouse Subs saw its same-store sales shrink 4.8% in the quarter. The sandwich chain is the latest addition to Restaurant Brands’ portfolio, as of 2021, and the smallest brand by footprint with just 1,300 locations as of the end of the third quarter.

Tim Hortons was the top performer, with domestic same-store sales growth of 2.3%. But the Canadian coffee chain still fell short of Wall Street’s same-store sales growth expectations of 4.1%, based on StreetAccount estimates.

Outside of the U.S. and Canada, Restaurant Brands’ international same-store sales rose 1.8% in the quarter, just shy of estimates of 2.2%.

1gk58f6,https://v.redd.it/95knouhjq2zd1,Baratza n Espresso,"Hi,
I’m a newbie on this amazing coffee community and I wish to share my experience with the new Baratza Esp Encore grinder which I bought few months back. 

Surely love the way my Espresso and French press tastes. I use a Morphy Richard’s coffee Machine, nothing fancy but as James Hoffman rightly said. The freshness of the beans and grind makes a huge difference irrespective of the machine you have. I also added an after market Bottomless Portafilter and the results are surely way better than the factory portafilter.

I dabble a lot with the grind settings and different roast needs different grind settings. Still lots to learn and discover. I use Blue Tokai coffee beans. 

This is one of my favourite espresso I pulled this weekend. Make sure you turn on the sound when you watch this video.

Have a lovely day!
