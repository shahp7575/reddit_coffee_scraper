1iti58i,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sunnyvale/comments/1iti58i/my_loss_your_gain/,"My loss, your gain...","Hello Sunnyvale Neighbors! 

The house we've rented for the past 7 years is being sold and we've got to be out by March 15th. 

I'm currently on the transplant list, doing dialysis as i wait for a kidney which means I don't have the strength or stamina to move a bunch of heavy furniture. That means I'm giving away a ton of stuff for the low low price of FREE. 

I'm really hoping this stuff can go to people who really need it so if there's anything listed here you need, please message me and I can send pics and arrange a time for you to come take it off my hands. 

Items available: 

* Brown Pub Style Dining Table w/ 4 chairs. Nothing special but the chairs are comfy. 
* Wood and glass coffee and end table from the 80s or 90s, belonged to my parents. Needs some TLC - always thought I'd sand and stain it. 
* HUGE area rug, takes up almost the entire living room. Cream colored with accents of green. 
* 55 gallon aquarium, empty, needs a thorough cleaning but holds water. Several accessories too including a really good filter. 
* 10 white folding Ikea chairs. 
* Big corner desk, espresso in color. Comes apart into two pieces for easier transport. 
* Brown bookshelf from Wayfair w/ doors at the bottom. 
* White ikea bookshelf. 
* Treadmill w/ incline. Works great though the display has a loose connection that you've gotta fiddle with to make it work. (Just wore my Smartwatch tbh.) 
* Rowing machine. 
* Wood (Teak?) patio table and 4 chairs. 
* Big Monstera indoor plant - needs to be repotted and some general TLC. 

Feel free to message me through Reddit though the fastest/best way to reach me is through email: mouserz @ gmail.com.

Please come take this stuff off my hands so i can stop feeling so overwhelmed. 🫶🏻

P.S. We are in the SNAIL neighborhood, right off 101 @ Fair Oaks. ",1,1740002936.0,Sunnyvale,0,1.0,False

I have a Barista Express and made the decision to get some coffee from a local roaster as my every day go to. I have been all over the place with settings trying to get something close to what I’m supposed to see and no matter what I do I’m way off. 

 I basically reset myself back to 6 on the internal burr so that I’m factory setting on that, and had a friend with the same machine and same roast of coffee tell me to set the external grinder to 6 as well, grind 18g and they had a 98% perfect shot. Well I tried that and it’s WAY off. I keep running into problems where I have issues that fall in the over extraction and under extraction categories. When I pull a shot it always takes longer than 7 seconds to begin flow, usually between 9 and 11 seconds no matter the grind size. The finer I go the closer I get to a 30-35 second pull and the coarser I go I’m usually 20-25 seconds, but again no matter what, I’m still way over on the start time. 

I also run into problems where I’ll have an over extraction but the puck comes out wet. The shots also pull SUPER heavy on crema and the crema is usually very light and takes a while before it settles into espresso, it’s very frothy and mousse like. Guess I’m just not sure if there’s something wrong with my machine, my equipment, I figure I can go back to the stock tamper stock portafilter and start from there but kinda sucks that I was gifted a lot of nice upgraded equipment that I hope isn’t the root of my problems ",2,1740002644.0,BrevilleCoffee,0,1.0,False

You turned my world upside down, from one day to another everything made sense. All my self doubts, fears and that deep feeling of being a lone wolf went out the window.
You way were so gracious, so loving , so full of life. You brought a light to my life i could never imagine to find, i couldnt even hoping to find.
Years passed by, we learned to life, learned to love and teached us both what trust really means. Everything became so easy, even the troubling and hard times. 

We grew up together and brought the two most beautiful people to this planet we could imagine, our two kids. My love for could not be put into words. You were my everything and brought a sense of luck and peace to my life i could have never dreamed of. There is nothing else on this world for me then to get old together with you and  take my last breath besides you. 

I'm 38 now and you are forever gone, we will never talk again about anything that comes to our mind. No more theatre with you. No new countries we explore together. We will never move to our dream house together. I will never comb your gray hair. I will never be able to kiss you again or even touch your soft skin. You will never again get scared because you didnt hear me walking into the room. 

No more ""when are you home"", no more coffee in the morning which you called your love language. 

There are no words that can describe what you meant to me. My grief will stay for the rest of my life and the only day i look forward to is the day i see you finaly again.

We are all grains of sand.,"The Shutdown315 Movement offers concrete - small and large things a person can actually do. I know many people keep asking ""what can we do"" - here are some ideas. No one can do them all, but we can each be a grain of sand in order to nail a dictator. (Take inspiration from When the Mountains Tremble, and Granito: How to Nail a Dictator) It suits what is happening here.

Shutdown315 has grown into a decentralized national movement across the US, with some people requesting for the movement to go global.

* It has no formal leadership structure. This movement solely relies on the direct action of all it’s participants.

Declaration: On March 15th, 2025, the working class of the United States will cease to serve the capitalist ruling class.

Action Steps...some drastic.

* Remove our money from all banks and corporate financial institutions. Cancel all unused accounts and lines of credit.
* Potential for some to stop paying rent.
* Cancel all subscription services, Amazon prime and other unnecessary premium services
* Stop working - except vital services.
   * Self employed people or business owners will use their business to help their community in any way possible, and ensure that wealth is not being distributed back into the hands of oligarchs or corporate giants.
* Stop shopping. No buying or ordering anything.
   * If something must be purchased, buy from a locally owned and operated business and preferably buying goods that are made/manufactured locally.
* Stop all unnecessary travel. No trips or vacations.
* Only buy gas from independently owned gas stations.
* Do not buy corporate goods and foods.
* Unionize our workplaces and go on an organized labor strike that is protected by law.

In the days approaching March 15th, starting now, we will:

* Delete and deactivate Meta and X apps.
   * Meta and X have actively worked against the American people to silence our voices and push far right wing narrative, silencing marginalized voices.
* Meta based businesses sites to other apps, like Bluesky
* Move bank accounts, lines of credit and all other financial business to a small, locally centered credit union.
* Stop dining at large chain restaurants and fast food.
* Do not use popular delivery services like doordash and grubhub, Uber eats etc. Gig economy companies such as those are predatory and exploitative. Very little of the cut goes to their delivery workers.
* Support local coffee shops rather than corporate stores like Starbucks or Dunkin
* Only shop locally. No giant corporations or franchise chains. (If your local businesses promoted Trump during the election, go elsewhere.
* Obtain needed items from second hand, friends, family, community members, thrift shops, junk yards, trading posts or transfer station swap shacks.
* Start a trading post in your community where people can bring their unwanted items to be given away to anyone who wants or needs something. Deconstruct broken and damaged items to salvage the hardware or materials.
* Keep your user information safe. Download and install a good VPN.
   * Use caution with ChatGPT and Deepseek\*
* Stop or decrease use of Microsoft, Apple or Google applications. A good alternative to Microsoft office is WPS Office. A good alternative to Google Maps is Magic Earth.
* Use end-to-end encrypted communication apps such as Signal, or Session. E2E email options are Proton Mail and Tutamail.
* Build strong community initiatives and organize mutual aid and community support for all our community members.
* Take nonviolent direct action to fulfill any movement or community need. Do not wait for someone else to do the work. Do it yourself.
* Spread information about the shutdown worldwide.
* Start a food security program, a seed exchange program, community gardens, reach out to farmers and landowners to see to court participation and possibly allow people to have gardens on their land.
   * Get involved with agricultural groups and gardening clubs.
   * Get connected with people to set up a centralized place where people can pick up and drop off food.
   * Get in touch with hunters, and fishermen to have them donate unused or unwanted game meat.
* Download and install the Nextdoor app. T
* Utilize your local library for meetups, attend school board meetings or town hall sessions
* Organize a food safety and cooking/baking class in your community
* Build a network of professionals such as mechanics, and other trades people that are willing to donate time, space and products to anyone in need in the community
* Organize a tenant's union with other tenants to fight against landlord corruption and tenant exploitation/extortion.
* Unionize your workplace and encourage friends and family to do so as well. Contact local labor unions.
* Reach out to the Amish or Mennonite community if nearby and enlist their expertise and skills (Keep in mind that at least in PA, many of the Amish were groomed by Trumper groups to convince them he would be their savior from alleged land grabs by Dems) - they may not be responsive to this plan, but could be from a community support aspect.

* Download and install the app Groupspot. It is a secure and privately owned app with privacy at the forefront of it's principals. Use it to organize community initiatives.
* If you are a member if an indigenous tribe, you likely have a lot of these supports in place. Indigenous culture is often centered around community. Find ways to reach out to tribal members who may be estranged or live outside the community and get them home.
* This movement will take a lot of initiative and leaving comfort zones. It will be risky for everyone, but with proper community support we can all do this.
   * Do the hard things.
   * Do the things you have the skill and ability to do.
   * Do something small every day and work your way up to something larger. (Granito de Arena)

How's it going? I'm Ron! That's not really my name, but my nickname i suppose? Or the nick i've chosen! anyways, i'm looking for my duo in fortnite because i'm so tired of playing it solo. I would call myself somewhat decent at the game, and mostly play it for fun! i would be down for ranked or non-ranked. Doesn't really matter, i just wanna have someone to hang out with while we play.

Outside of fortnite i enjoy other games and things like

* Apex Legends
* Modded minecraft
* Satisfactory
* Core Keeper
* Movies (i have letterboxd, we can be mutuals!)
* Music (https://last.fm/user/zauron)
* Being inside
* Drinking coffee
* Horror in general

I have a ton of games on steam and EGS. But mostly looking for fortnite i guess? Would be down for apex too, but less so. And if we hit it off i would be down to do a bunch of other games, and also watching movies/shows/anime

That's about it i guess? Take care!

I accepted because I've always been a night owl and the compensation was very hard to refuse. I thought ""it can't be that hard and naturally I'm someone who stays up late. Let's do it!"" Well here's how I feel after my first night:

- The nightshifts itself wasn't difficult until 4am when I started getting very sleepy but I powered through 
- came home at 8 am pretty hungry but also extremely tired. Showered then went to sleep 
- woke up at 2 pm and here's the emetophobic part. I woke up feeling as if I'm hungover. Headache, hungry, but with an upset stomach, and just feeling generally not great
- Now the emetophobe in me desperately wants to take the night off. But the rational in me says I'm feeling like this because I completely up ended my body's natural cycle. I decided to ignore my headache and upset stomach and remembered I was hungry when I went to sleep.
- I ate a big meal had a coffee. I devoured my meal but the headache still remains and the nausea is still present. It's pretty anxiety inducing but once again, I'm sure it's because my body didn't enjoy the nightshift. But I will still go to work and power through it!

(We’re already friends)","Hi guys, I (22M) am thinking of asking my friend (21F) out on a date soon. We’ve gotten lunch/dinner a few times, but it was always as friends. 

We both went to a party last weekend, however, and she was very, very more-than-normally touchy feely with me. And I think we even flirted a little? I had some to drink (she had some too) so my memory isn’t perfect. Anyway, I think there’s a good chance she’d say yes if I asked her out.

What I am not feeling so confident about, however, is what to do for a first date. My idea was to ask her to go see a movie with me and get something to eat before or after. It’s the new Gundam movie. I’ve never seen anything in the franchise before, but I think it looks really cool! Should also add I’m a big fan of anime in general.

She, however, is not as big of a fan. She loves movies, but I don’t think she watching much animation, let alone anime. She will, though, watch anime with me and her roommates whenever I hang out at their place and she always has a good time (she always chooses to, we never force her lol). I guess what I’m trying to say is she’s okay with it but it isn’t something she’d do on her own.

I was thinking it would be a good idea since I like anime, she loves movies, and it’s only an hour and 20 minutes long, so we could get food after. I was also thinking it would be a good idea bc this is something I genuinely want to do for fun and want to have someone join me. But I don’t want to seem like I’m selfish or oblivious either. I guess if I could always ask what she thinks. I’ve written the whole post out at this point however so I’m still asking it.

From an outsider perspective, is this a good idea? Or should I stick to something safe like just going to get coffee/food?",1,1740001303.0,dating,4,1.0,False

1ithdlf,https://www.reddit.com/r/dustythunder/comments/1ithdlf/aita_for_firing_my_boyfriend_twice/,aita for firing my boyfriend (twice),"this happened a while ago, but a friend recently brought it up saying it was wrong of me to do. 

in 2022, I was working as a manager at a popular coffee chain (the pink and orange one with the donuts). my now boyfriend (nothing more than employee at the time), was working there as a baker. we'll call him Steven (not his name, obvi). while he was good at his job, Steven had attendance issues. after calling off basically once a week, and then finally going AWOL (later found out he was on a bender three states over with his then girlfriend) I had to fire him. obviously I can't have someone on staff that isn't showing up when needed. 

we became friends after I terminated him. we found out I lived in the same neighborhood as his friend he was staying with. so we started hanging out. I was still managing the coffee chain, Steven was unemployed and homeless. his then girlfriend broke up with him and kicked him out for being unemployed (even though the bender she invited him was her original idea) so I felt bad for him. he had become a friend and I needed an opener. Steven and I talked about it and I offered to bring him back on a probationary period if he would show improvement on attendance. 

Steven became my top employee. always coming in early, staying late, picking up shifts from others, and never calling off or no call no showing. and still being great at his job. however, he couldn't seem to separate out new friendship from our working relationship. he would make jokes that he shouldn't be making to his boss. he would call me stupid (friendly banter) and undermine me. after a while, the other employees started to do the same. I started to lose control of my store. so I started giving him write ups. I thought just one would fix the problem, but Steven kept going. so I fired him (again) on his third write up. 

we were still friends, I regained control of my store, he found a new job and got his own apartment. all was well. A year later, we became more than friends. 

both times I fired Steven, I did it by the book. followed policy completely, had my district manager sit in, all that jazz. nothing happened between me and Steven until a year after both of us had left the company. 

last weekend, I had a friend over and she asked me to remind her how Steven and I met. I told her truthfully we became friends because I fired him and unfortunately ruined his life for a bit, then helped him rebuild. I went through all the details of how I hired and fired him. (Steven was sitting there, so he could have interjected, if he didnt want that information shared. instead he was adding his take on things) She asked me how I could fire him the first time, let alone the second. he was obviously struggling and firing him added more fuel to his fire. that we could have had the same outcome if I hadn't fired him. 

I try, but I can't see her point of view. can anyone offer insight? was there something I was supposed to do differently? am I the asconaut for firing my then regular employee/now boyfriend twice?",2,1740001049.0,dustythunder,3,1.0,False

1ithb1e,https://www.reddit.com/r/SeveranceAppleTVPlus/comments/1ithb1e/seth_milchick_actions_words/,SETH MILCHICK: Actions > Words,"TLDR: Milchick, a skilled liar, is actually working against Lumon and setting up MDR with the tools to fight back against their master plan to further tame the natural world in the name of business and progress, forcing order out of chaos, and ultimately enslaving the working class.


In his INTRODUCTORY scene, Milchick is presented as a liar, as someone whose words cannot be trusted. His very first words were a lie to Mark about what Cobel would want to hear.

He then goes on to lie a lot more… and that made me wonder where his truth really lives, because this man keeps SAYING one thing and ACHIEVING something entirely different.

Here are a few of his choices — and their subsequent consequences:

•The consequence of Milchick’s rogue choice to IMMEDIATELY retrieve the stolen O&D card was that I-Dylan was made aware of OTCs in the first place. 
“I really wouldnt mention this to your colleagues, Dylan”
AND he also made sure to tell I-Dylan than Cobel didn’t know about his OTC activation.

(Why was that even time sensitive to begin with? After what we learned in the Lexington Letters, the card likely couldn’t have passed the updated elevator sensors. Milchick doesn’t even bother to get it from the bathroom until the following morning.)

•The consequences of Milchick’s choice to physically antagonize I-Dylan during the Defiant Jazz party were  (1) I-Dylan’s public outburst, (2) the further bonding of the group; and (3) then the ultimate wide reveal of the OTC’s existence. 

•The consequences of Milchick leaving the inscribed book on the SVR’D floor, especially despite him having both read and checked it for messages to O-Mark, were (1) I-Mark’s newfound confidence in rule-breaking and (2) his being introduced to new ideas about, among other things, sex.

*NOTE* This plan only worked with Graner’s keycard. Dr. Reghabi was the one who gave O-Mark the card. Does this indicate that she’s working with Milchick from the outside?

*NOTE* It’s established via first unsanctioned OTC that Milchick watches all possible footage of MDR. It feels like he would know when they broke into the security room to check things out. 

•The immediate consequences of that second, unsanctioned OTC were Harmony Cobel’s removal as MDR manager and Milchick’s subsequent promotion. Did he feed the board intel on Helly’s suicide attempt? (Although let’s bffr, she went to the hospital — how did that evade them in the first place?)

•The consequences of Milchick’s “many mistakes” during the failed ORTBO include (1) Helena being outed as an Eagan, (2) I-Mark and Helena hooking up, (3) Irving being fired, (4) a return of Helly, and (5)a brief slow down in MDR while they held their funeral despite Miss Huang’s misgivings.

(Milchick watches EVERYTHING on the floor. O-Irving is clearly suspicious of  Lumon, and given what we know about how comprehensive his surveillance operation is, there is very little chance that Milchick didn’t know this, too. Did his firing help by giving Irving a nudge to keep at it?)

Other strange consequences Milchick’s recent choices have delivered:
- I-Dylan has met his O-wife.
- Milchick has once again told Dylan a work secret and asked him not to tell the others, but given his track record, he will not be keeping mum about this, either.
- Milchick tanked the re-staff with a bunch of “last minute” randos — this really slowed things down for a few days.


What else do we really know about Seth?
- He may have a relative who works as a newspaper editor.

- He rides a motorcycle.

- He knows how to smile both with and without his eyes.

- He is committed to sartorially blending in as much as possible. His white office shirts are the color of the corridors and he was basically wearing camo in the snowy woods. His choices as to when he wears MDR blue are notable.

- He has replaced Cobel’s oversized storm art with a small, framed iceberg. Icebergs only show you a tiny fraction of what’s lurking beneath. (Given the water motif everywhere, the coffee pods/  Tumwater/   “come drink of my water” of it all… if Milchick IS working against the Board, is there anything to storms producing water and iceberg’s freezing it up?)

…aaand that’s about it.

Anyway, maybe these ARE all just coincidences.
MAYBE Milchick’s just that bad at his job, …but also maybe it’s Maybelline, yk?

UPDATE
I hadn’t posted this yet, because I didn’t have the Why.

Here is one INCREDIBLY interesting theory: 

MDR are working to “taming the tempers” to create an enslaved working class, a machine-made human, and the battle of COLD HARBOR is actually just the confederacy rising again and MDR blue takes on new meaning! The reason Miss Casey is such a zombie of her former self is because they are working to essentially removing any emotion from her psyche:

I started to develop a crush on the maintenance guy that works at my bosses apartment (I just got this job). I’ve briefly met him 2 years ago with my dog. He suddenly asked me about him because my dog happens to have one eye. I’ve seen him around, especially because I live on the same block as my boss. He’s usually cleans outside the apartment & I used to walk there with my dog, but then stopped bc I got way too shy. Anyways I now get to see him a bit more often in the apartment because I dog sit and have to take the dog out to the patio. He’s usually cleaning and at times we have said hi to each other and had a small brief chat one time. I unfortunately am a nervous and shy person, so I sometimes walk past by him, which I hope doesn’t come off as rude (I know it does :/). Since he’s usually vacuuming and mopping, I don’t want to interrupt him. I would like to get to know him a bit better throughout my time there (I won’t be there too long as the puppy is scheduled to go to daycare when he’s ready). I really need help in gaining confidence to say hi to him more and even ask him how he is. I one time planned to kindly offer him coffee since he works so much (might seem too flirty too). I could really use some advice on how to approach him more and be confident. As of now, I practice starting a conversation, especially in Spanish since he doesn’t really speak English.

For the last 8 months I’ve (F23) been living with my dad helping him with his farm. He got divorced and I didn’t want to leave him alone since he was at a very bad place. 


During that time I did IF and generally eating better. Besides animals I haven’t really had human interaction, other than old folks and family members here and there. I lost about 15 kilos in the last 8 months. 

I moved back to the city 2 months ago and I feel like people are treating me different, veryyy different, I don’t know how to feel. 

In the past 2 months: 

-two guys paid for my coffee 


-I got stopped for speeding 
unintentionally and the police officer was so nice to me he didn’t fine me. 


-I got asked out 4 times 


-I went on a date and usually I always go 50-50 but my date was willing to pay for everything and was so gentlemanly. 


-strangers are eager to be friends with me at parties or get to know me 


-people are just nicer


-my mechanic was super nice to me and changed my tyres for free


-waiters give me random extras 


-my manager always favours me and let’s me get away with mistakes, also giving me opportunities to help me get promoted faster. 


-bar tenders give me free drinks. 


Usually these things don’t happen to me. I feel like just because I’m smaller people are treating me better. I didn’t think losing weight came with perks. 

I know I should be happy however I am a bit conflicted and feel sorry for the old me. 

I feel like people love and appreciate me more as if I’m special or treasured.  I don’t want to be ungrateful but it’s low-key depressing… why can’t everyone be treated nicer no matter your size?

I have two cats so I thought one of them had knocked over a half full cup of coffee or chewed on a cable since I stupidly left the office door open.

All the info at the bottom of the Lock Screen was gone like stock prices, weather, the usually junk that’s down there. I unlock the PC and every little bit of text and every word on screen is the same neon yellow and internet explorer has lost all color and gone completely black except for text and oddly formatted websites that used to look normal. I’m not sure what happened or even how to google the issue. I’ve tried adjusting the display saturation but settings says it’s normal. The colors aren’t inverted and all the PC apps and backround display in their normal colors. Any have any clue what happened? Everywhere you see yellow, the text should be white. Nothing is in dark mode either. The hotbar at the bottom of my PC seems to be effected as well. Has this happened to anyone before. I already tried restarting it and nothing. It only seems to affect apps and the Lock Screen. The backround display still has all of its color. Appreciate all the help in advance!

I’ve been incredibly blessed with minimal symptoms but this past week has been rough. I’ve been struggling to stay asleep at night and am constantly waking with anxiety. I probably wake up 10+ times every night with the number increasing as it gets closer to morning.
This is REALLY impacting my mental health. When I get up in the mornings, I don’t actually feel very tired, but I just feel so anxious and my heart is racing. It’s like I’ve been drinking a bunch of coffee.

Not getting sleep is really stressful but I just keep waking up. I am also the maid of honour to my friend who is getting married on Monday so this may be contributing to that anxiety. I’ve been putting a lot of pressure on myself preparing her bachelorette party and trying to do things for her to make the day less stressful for her. I also haven’t been well (aside from my pregnancy). I have some pretty major health issues that I haven’t been able to treat/investigate due to my pregnancy. Because of this, I have been missing out on a fair bit of work. And trying to schedule all of my prenatal and doctor’s appointment around work and the wedding has been a nightmare.

I think I’m really overwhelmed and trying to deal with all of this on top of not getting enough sleep is just too much for me.

Any tips for helping to improve sleep and manage stress? Did anyone else experience heightened levels of stress? Did it go away for you?

The boat itself was very clean. We stayed in a concierge class Infinite verandah room. The room was very spacious and so was the bathroom, water pressure was great in the shower and it was nice having a big window in our room, even though we couldn't open it most of the time due to the heat and steam from the tropics.  

We bought one Premium wifi for one device between us, but I had no trouble connecting my own WiFi network in the room, and using a firestick on the TV. We could stream at 720p nicely. Cheating the system a bit here, but it's 2025 wifi should be free.

The ship itself was very clean and the staff I could not fault, great across the board. Except for everyone constantly hounding you to purchase drinks packages and specialty restaurant dining  it did calm down after the first few days, but seriously it felt like being in Suva and getting hawked by tour operators. This pressure obviously comes from the company and not  the staff. Celebrity will unashamedly try to bleed you for every dollar they can, it's a bit gross.

There were enough bars and restaurants onboard so we were never bored and always able to change the vibe when required. I found the cocktails to be very weak, full of sugar and a waste of time, seriously better off with beer and wine. We bought a premium drinks package which I wouldn't do again. This is because, we didn't drink enough to warrant it over 12 days with 5 ports. We didn't want to be drunk and hungover the whole time. I'm sure we could have paid as we went and still come in way under.  

The food was great, but we're not fussy people. We ate at the buffet for breakfast and sometimes lunch. Good variety of options. The Spa cafe made yuck smoothies, be prepared to build your own if you think that orange juice and carrot should never be paired lol. The coffee from Bacio is flat out terrible.  I think this is an American problem. There is only one jumbo size cup, and the staff didn't seem to know what a long black was. 

The 4 main dining restaurants were great, food was always nice, and it amazed me at how well they run with a pretty constant high quality considering the amount of people they constantly were catering for. We ate here for lunch quite a few times to escape the feeding time at the zoo vibe of the buffet. Just don't expect a good steak.

Specialty restaurants.  We ate at Eden on a chic night. Was nice to dress up even tho most didn't.   Nice food great service, crab cake was the standout here. Our waiter ordered us dessert after we declined and we were so glad she did.   Everyone raved about Eden, but yeah not our vibe. Rooftop bar and grill didn't seem like it should have been a specialty restaurant, pretty basic food and this was the only place where the wait staff were a bit lacking, but this could have been sure to the large table of ships officers they were trying to please.  Fine Cut, we went twice, get the tomahawk, I ate it myself easily. Great steaks, awesome staff. Recommended. Raw on 5 went here twice also. We ate the towers of crab and shellfish. Very fresh, the sushi rolls were nice too. This is a restaurant where you don't have to spend a lot of money if you don't want to. Recommended. Le Petit Chef, great show, worth doing once, food was average at best.

The ports were bad, but we knew this was going to be the case. The ship docks in the ports, so there's not a beach for miles. You think Fiji and then tropical beaches? Well not in Suva and Lautoka. It's poverty and people desperate to sell you anything they can. Felt a bit gross waking around to be honest. Samoa was a bit better, but yeah best advice is fork out on an excursion, or pay a driver to take you out of town as fast as you can. 

The music could have been better on the club nights, seriously DJ tone deaf cleared the dance floor time after time, all the oldies were long in bed, we just wanted to dance so something with a beat and this was the feeling from others too. Terrible.

The last thing I will say it's a general observation on the passengers. My god some people need to make more of an effort and the staff need to enforce sloppy dressing. There was a man who insisted walking around in bare feet in the main dining room. I called him out on it too and he just looked at me like in confusion and walked off. There were people wearing beer singlets and thongs in the grand plaza on evening chic nights. People dining in shorts and t shirts in main dining.  On evening chic nights, people were staring at us like we were overdressed. For God sakes make an effort.

1ith2zo,https://www.reddit.com/r/cuttle/comments/1ith2zo/life_as_a_rube/,Life as a Rube,"In a world infatuated with optimization, sometimes we delight in inefficiency. A *Rube Goldberg machine* is an absurdly complicated contraption designed to perform a simple task in the most convoluted way possible. A rolling ball might trigger a lever, which releases a spring, which lights a fuse, which launches a rocket, which pops a balloon, which finally—after a dizzying chain of events—pours a cup of coffee. Rube Goldberg machines are ridiculous, over-the-top, and utterly delightful. But why do we love them so much?

Perhaps it’s because they remind us that the journey is often more interesting than the destination. A Rube Goldberg machine takes something mundane—like pouring coffee—and turns it into a spectacle of creativity, ingenuity, and unpredictability. It’s a celebration of process over product, of the winding path over the straight line. And in a way, it’s a metaphor for life itself.

Think about it: life is an elaborate, long-winded Rube Goldberg machine. We set goals, make plans, and take actions, but the path to achieving them is rarely straightforward. There are twists, turns, and unexpected detours. Sometimes the ball rolls the wrong way. Sometimes the rocket misfires. But somehow, through all the chaos, we end up where we’re meant to be—or at least somewhere interesting. And along the way, we create something worth celebrating.

But if all that is true, then what’s the punchline? Sure life is winding, complicated, and full of surprises? But what’s it all for? What proverbial cup of coffee could be the ultimate conclusion of the cacophony that is life itself?

Let me start from the beginning.  

That Monday started out like any other. I arrived at work, filled my coffee cup and stepped into my office. I'm a former Air Force Major, now in training with NASA for a spot on the ISS. If all went according to plan, I should have been heading up there within the next year or so. But you know what they say, “Man plans, and God laughs.”  

As I sat down to look over the files on my desk, my phone rang. I was informed that I had a meeting in the conference room down the hall. 

“A meeting? I don't have anything on my schedule, who is it with?” I asked. 

“He didn't give a name; just said it was urgent. You better hurry, he doesn't seem the patient type.” 

That didn't sound good. I hung up the phone and left my office, feeling anxious. What could this be about? I thought. 

I stepped into the conference room to see a man in a black suit seated at the oval shaped table. He was a small man, but seemed to have a commanding presence. He had sharp eyes behind round glasses, and held a yellow file folder trimmed with black and red.  

He stood as I entered, “Major Royce.” He said shaking my hand. 

“Sir.”  

“Have a seat.” He said motioning to the chair across from his, “We have some things to discuss.” 

I sat, and waited. But the man said nothing, he just sat across from me, studying me for a solid minute.  

I cleared my throat, “Uh, what's this about?” 

“You’re doing exceedingly well in your training.” He said, as he continued studying me, “I understand you will be going up to the ISS soon. Are you looking forward to taking your place among the stars?” 

I sat up a bit straighter, “Yes sir, I should be completing my training within the year. After that, it's just a matter of waiting for crew rotation.” 

The man nodded, “It's an amazing achievement, I'm sure your family is very proud.”  

I smiled, but my smile quickly faltered under the man's lizard like stare. I had yet to see him blink as he silently studied me. 

“How would you like to go sooner?” He said without breaking his gaze. 

“Sooner? I'm not sure I follow sir. Are you saying I could go up before crew rotation?” I asked 

“No, I mean much sooner... And, you wouldn't be going to the ISS.” 

I blinked in confusion, “Wait, are you saying there’s another mission planned? Since when? And to where?” 

“It's being planned as we speak.” He said as he placed his hand atop the seal on the file folder, “So I take it you’re interested?” 

I nodded, “Yes, I am.” 

“Good. But before I outline the mission, I need to know you're on board. The information in this file is... Sensitive.” He said cryptically. 

I hesitated; this situation seemed unusual. “I need to know some details before I make my decision.” 

The man drummed his fingers on the file, “No. I'm afraid this is a time sensitive issue. If you aren't up for the task, we will have to move on to the next candidate.” 

Now it was my turn to study him. He’d make one hell of a poker player. I thought. His cold calculating eyes gave nothing away. I didn't like him but dammit was I curious. After all, this was what I wanted wasn't it? I joined the military and then NASA in search of adventure. I'm sure there would still be a spot on me on the ISS in the future. 

“Okay.” I said. “I'm in.” 

There was the smallest of grins on the man's face as he broke the seal on the file. “Excellent.” 

He opened the folder and removed a few sheets of paper before handing them over. They were pretty standard government NDAs, nothing I hadn't seen before. 

“So, CIA?” I asked.  

“No.” he said. There wasn't quite a scoff, but I could imagine it. 

I signed the NDA paperwork and slid it across to him, “So, who are you?” 

“You can call me Neilan.” He said as he took the paperwork and looked it over. “I'm with an organization called the Bureau of Anomalous Research and Defense, or B.A.R.D. You won't have heard of us and don't bother trying to look us up, no one else has either.” 

“The B.A.R.D.?” I asked. “And what exactly do you research? Little green men?”  

He almost smiled, “We investigate various phenomena, both foreign and domestic. However, all you are privy to is what's in this file.” 

He removed more documents from the file and passed them over to me. There were schematics, mission statements and crew information. I scanned over the schematic, it was a massive research station, easily ten times the size of the ISS. From an engineering standpoint it was extremely impressive. Multiple labs, a common room and quarters for a dozen crew. It was designed to rotate on a central axis, using this rotational force or centrifugal force the station could simulate something close to earth gravity. It looked like something straight out of a sci fi movie. 

“This is an extremely ambitious project.” I said. 

“Yes. It was.” 

I looked up at him, “Was? You mean we have this?” 

Neilan nodded, “The Icarus 1 has been in orbit for the past five years.” 

“The Icarus 1?” I asked, “Didn't Icarus fly too close to the sun?” 

“Yes, well I didn't choose the name. Although there is something to be said about self-fulfilling prophesies.” He said leaning back in his chair. 

I squinted at him, “What’s that supposed to mean?” 

He sat there silently for a moment, then said. “19 hours ago, the Icarus was hit by a massive solar storm. It was completely unexpected and knocked out all communications with the station.” 

“Shit.” I said. 

“Indeed.” He said folding his hands on the table, “We don't know what other systems might have been affected by the storm. Our scientists may not even be alive or if they are how much longer they have, hence the urgency. We need you to get to the station as soon as possible and bring our people home. And in the event that the crew is lost to us, we need you to retrieve the research data and any viable test samples.” 

“What kind of test samples?” I asked as I looked over the crew files. The crew was consisted mostly of scientists, and a few engineers. 

Neilan drummed his fingers again. “It is our hope that the crew is still alive. In the event that they are not, you will be briefed on the samples and data we need retrieved.” 

I looked up at him, trying to read his expression. The man truly was unreadable. I looked back to the crew file, one in particular stood out. The man held multiple degrees across several fields including astro physics, molecular biology, and of all thing's zoology.  

“Who is this Dr. Stromm?” I asked. 

“He’s our lead scientist on the station. Anything beyond that is not covered under your current NDA.” Said Neilan. 

 

I nodded, “Okay, when do we launch?”  

“There is no we, Major Royce. You are going up alone, and you launch first thing tomorrow.”  

“What?” I exclaimed, standing up from my chair. “Are you insane? I need time to prepare, we need to run tests on the shuttle, you can't launch a mission on such short notice.” 

Neilan stayed sitting, “Major, we have taken all necessary precautions; we prepare for these eventualities. Normally we have a pilot on standby but unforeseen circumstances have rendered them currently unavailable.” 

I shook my head, “I don't know about this.” 

“This launch is happening tomorrow, if you’re not the man for the job...” 

I put up my hands, “No. No, I can do it.”  

Neilan stood and shook my hand, “Good, we’re counting on you, those people up there are counting on you. Don't let us down.” And with that, he left.   

What was I doing? These missions typically up to two years to prepare for, and I was expected to go in less than 24 hours. 

 

 Needless to say, I didn't sleep much that night. As I lay there in bed, thinking over the insanity of what I was about to do, I grabbed my phone and scrolled through my downloaded music. I smiled when I found what I was looking for and pushed play. As the strumming guitar began to flow from the speakers in my room, I felt my stress begin to melt away. My lips formed the words automatically along with the chorus, “Theres a Starman waiting in the sky, he’d like to come and meet us but he thinks he’d blow our minds.” I remember listening to it when I was a kid, staring up at the stars in night sky and thinking that someday, I'd get up there. That someday, I'd be a Starman. 

 

The shuttle they had prepared was like nothing I had ever seen before. It was smaller and sleeker than the typical shuttles that NASA uses. I found myself wondering, what else the B.A.R.D. had hidden away from the world.  

 Once I was suited up, Neilan met me before heading out to the launch pad. 

“Major Royce. I want to thank you for service to this great nation.” He said as he saluted. 

I returned the gesture. 

 “We will be with you on comms and your helmet is wired with a video feed. Again, if there are no survivors, we will give you further instructions.” 

I nodded, “You can count on me sir.” 

My heart was pounding as I made my way down the walkway to the shuttle hatch, I couldn't believe this was actually happening. This launch wasn't strictly official, it would never be in history books or documented in any way beyond a sealed file folder marked classified, but I didn't care. I was finally headed for the stars. 

I settled into my seat and strapped in, running my fingers over the control panels. I snapped my helmet into place, hearing the seals hiss as they pressurized. As I stared up into the cloudless blue of the morning sky, I swelled with pride, thinking of the heroes that have gone before me.  

“10, 9, 8,” The countdown sounded over the shuttle comms, “7,6,5,4,”, My heart pounded as adrenaline began to flow. “3,2,1,” The thrusters fired, the shuttle trembled as it began to lift and soar upwards. G forces pinned me to my seat as the rocket tore its way through the atmosphere, the blue of the sky turned darker and darker until it finally faded to black and the stars popped and shined with a clarity unlike anything I'd ever seen. As my shuttle left the grip of the earth's atmosphere, the rocket boosters detached and fell away.  

“How's it looking up there Major?” asked Harry, the comms officer. 

“Everything looks good from up here, command. How we looking on your end?”  

“Roger that. All systems show green down here. How's that view? 

I looked around in awe that I was finally here, “Its beautiful Harry, you gotta see it someday.” 

“Major.” Said Neilan, “Proceed on course to the Icarus.” 

“Copy. Proceeding on course.” 

 

The Icarus 1 loomed large and foreboding in the darkness of space. I had been concerned about attempting to dock onto the rotating station, but as I approached, I could see that more than just the comms systems had been knocked out. 

“Command. Looks like the station is completely dark. I'm seeing no signs of power from here.” I said. 

“Copy.” Came Harrys voice, “Continue to station and commence docking procedure.” 

“Copy, commencing docking.” 

I took a steading breath as I brought the shuttle into position. I had done this countless times in simulations with a 99.8% success rate. As the docking hatch came closer and closer, that .2% burned in my mind. Fortunately, the controls on the B.A.R.D. shuttle were smoother than I could have wished for. I sighed in relief as the docking hatch slid into place with a satisfying clank. 

“Shuttle docked. Preparing to enter station.”  

“Roger that Major, proceed with caution.” 

The airlocks hissed as I unlocked the hatch door to the Icarus. The entry into the station was like a dark portal into the abyss. I activated my helmets lamps as I floated through the passage.  

“Command. I'm inside, the station is completely dark.” I said. 

“Copy that. There should be an access terminal on the wall next to the hatch entry way.” Said Harry. 

I turned around until I found the terminal and floated over to it. Tapping the keyboard activated the system. I quickly found the lighting controls and switched them on. The lights in the corridor flickered to life, illuminating the white sterile hallway walls and floors. The readings on the terminal showed that the communication systems and the centrifugal engines were offline.  

“Royce, the offline systems can't be accessed from that computer. You'll need to get to the engine room and the communications deck to assess what damage has been done.” Said Harry. 

“Disregard that Major.” Interrupted Neilan. “Search the station for the crew. Their survival and the recovery of our data is the priority here.” 

“Copy that.” I said as I pushed off the wall and glided down the hallway. 

The station was eerily silent. After searching through the crew cabins and the botany lab, I made my way into the common area. There was no sign of the dozen crew members to be found. Where could they have gone? I exited the common area and was about to enter the neighboring room when I thought I heard a voice coming from down the hall. 

“Hello?” I called out. “Is someone there?” 

A man floated out of a room at the end of the hallway, “Hello.” He said as he began slowly gliding towards me.  

As he got closer, I recognized him, “Dr Stromm. I'm Major Royce. I was sent up here to bring you all home.” 

“Home? He questioned. “Back to earth?” 

As he approached, I realized he looked different from the photo in his file. His skin was gaunt and had almost a purplish tint to it and his proportions seemed just a bit off, not by a lot but just enough to look strange. His head seemed a bit more bulbous than in the picture and his extremities seemed a little too long for the jumpsuit he was wearing. 

“Um. Yes home.” I said, “Where are the others?” 

Stromm turned his head side to side, as if glancing around for his crew. “I'm... I'm not quite sure. They should be here, they were here.” 

As he turned, I could see a small bandage covering his right ear.  

“Dr. Stromm, are you hurt?"" I asked. 

He looked at me, his bloodshot eyes filled with confusion, “Hurt? Yes. Yes, I was hurt. But I'm alright now. I'd like to go home.” 

I nodded, “Of course. I'll get you home, we just have to find the others first.” 

“The others?” He asked cocking his head to the side, “Oh, they won't be joining us. No... No, they won't. Well, yes, they will, just not like they were.” He laughed. “Forgive me Major, I'm not quite sure what I'm saying.” 

“Thats fine. Let's just check that injury, then we’ll find the others and get you all home.” 

He nodded and moved into the common area. I floated over next to him and examined the bandage on his ear. Up close, I could see that the white fabric was darkened and crusted with blood. There were dark lines on his skin, spreading out from under the bandage. 

“When did this happen?” I asked. 

Dr. Stromm shrugged, “Yesterday? Last month? Eons ago? I can't really tell.” He turned to face me, “I'm not alone in here anymore.”   

I tried to give him a reassuring smile, but the way he was speaking was a little too unsettling.  

When I removed the bandage, I nearly gagged. If I hadn't been wearing my helmet, I'm sure I would have. Dr. Stromm’s right ear was swollen and discolored, a black viscous fluid oozed out from it and floated in the air between us. 

“Jesus.” I said under my breath before pushing the soiled bandage back into place. 

I moved back away from him as Neilan's voice came over my comms. 

“Major, you need to get the data and get off of that station now!” 

I had forgotten about the video feed. Command was seeing everything I was. 

“What the hell is wrong with him?” I asked. 

“All you need to know is that Dr. Stromm is now designated a biohazard and will not be coming back with you. Get away from him and retrieve my data.” 

“Copy that.” I said, never taking my eyes off of Stromm, “Where will I find the data?”' 

“Head to the biology lab, the files you need should be accessible from there.” Said Harry. 

“I'm on my way.” I said as I turned to head down the corridor. 

“Where are you going?” Asked Stromm from behind me. 

I turned back to face him, “I just need to go get some things and look for the other crew members. I need you to wait here until I come get you. Okay?""

Stromm smiled wide, his gums had turned the same oily black as the ooze that dripped from his head. “You’re not coming back for me, but that's okay.” 

I didn't know what to say so, I just turned and continued on to the biology lab. I searched every room on the way, but still there was no sign of the crew. 

“Command, I can't find the rest of the crew.” 

“Never mind the crew.” Said Neilan, “If they are there, they may be infected as well.” 

“Infected with what?” I asked.  

“Unknown.”  

“Bull shit.” I said losing my patience, “You know what this is Neilan, I want answers.” 

“Retrieve the data and samples, and I will tell you what you want to know.”  

I grunted in frustration as I pushed off another wall, “You fucking better.” 

This whole situation was fucked, I was up here on a top-secret research station with an unknown biohazard. If something went wrong, there was no help coming. They wouldn't risk another mission no matter how valuable the data was. 

I entered the lab and found a cold storage unit containing several vials of a purplish black liquid. 

“Are these the samples?” I asked. 

“Yes.” Said Neilan. 

“Remove them carefully and place them into the transportation cooler.” Said Harry, “And Major, move quickly. Do not let the samples get too warm.” 

I took a steadying breath and began removing the samples and placing them into the cooler as carefully and quickly as I could. With the samples stored, I glided over to the computer terminal, “Command, what do I need to do here? Do I download specific files or just rip out the hard drive?” 

“Better just remove the hard drive, Royce.” Said Harry. 

“Agreed, time is of the essence.” Added Neilan. 

I removed the tool bag from the pouch on my suit and prepared to start removing the computer housing, but then I paused. On the screen, I saw the station camera access point. Would Neilan really give me the answers I wanted? I didn't think so, maybe I could find some answers right here. 

I sat down the tool bag and selected the video files.  

“Major, we don't have time for this. Remove the hard drive and leave the station.” Demanded Neilan. 

I ignored him and scrolled through the camera files, looking for anything out of place.  

“Major Royce!”  

There, the time stamp showed just before the solar storm. The feed showed Dr. Stromm in the biology lab, he was dressed in a biohazard protection suit. On the lab table in front of him was a dark egg-shaped stone about the size of a football, he was attempting to drill into the stone. Suddenly the camera shook and the lights in the lab went out. Shortly after the storm hit, the emergency lighting came on, painting the lab in shades of red. Stromm had stepped away from the table, clearly distressed. But Stromm wasn't what I was focused on.  

The stone on the table had cracked open, a dark fluid leaking out from the cracks. After a moment Stromm noticed it too. He slowly approached the table, bending down and examining the substance. For some reason, perhaps a lapse in judgement, Stromm reached out and touched the slimy liquid. As he pulled back, the ooze stuck to his gloved hand. He tried flicking it off, but the ooze seemed to take on a life of its own, clinging to the suit and worming its way up his arm. Stromm panicked and flailed, trying to get the dark fluid off but nothing he did seemed to stop it. The ooze climbed to his head and melted through the hood of the suit, latching itself to the side of Stromm’s head. The feed ended. 

I scrolled through the video files, trying to find what happened to the rest of the crew. There had to be answers here. 

“Is it time to leave now?” Said Stromm. 

I turned to see him in the entry way to the biology lab. The black fluid seeped from his eyes and ran down his face like tears. As he pushed his way into the room, globs of the stuff trailed off of him and floated through the",1,1740000234.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

Been here since September and the only thing that doesn't seem to change is the weather. I appreciate being outside alot more. Fresh air is underrated. Sounds of multiple birds, grass trimmers and vehicles passing by. It's either raining or sunny and I find myself on the side of humanity that prefers the rain. Today? sunny but they say that sunshine is good for us who have a low chemical imbalance in our brains. 

I've tried many things in my 20s to fight against these feelings, emotions...whatever you want to call them. Nowadays, I try to stay optimistic. As someone who has dabbled in the dark arts of substance abuse, I knew where to go and where not to go. The move back to my home country keeps me humble in not knowing the ins and outs like I did in the East Coast. It certainly keeps me away from coppin' something I will regret. You see, that's my fear. Going against everything I have accomplished so far. I see my mom finally at peace and not worried about where her son is in the middle of the night. She would chainsmoke Newports by the kitchen vent, praying to the God she once turned away from to look after me. 

I'm not scared of dying. I'm actually scared of giving in and dying because of that. Thankfully, Jesus helped fill a void when doctors and therapist couldn't. And I don't claim to be all ""High and Mighty"" or religious. I know the church has hurt many people. I just know that when I was at my worst and in a psych unit, I called unto Jesus because like shit... I tried every other option. So I said  ""why not"" and I felt a peace I haven't felt in years in that hospital room. Before that I didn't believe and after that, well, I'm sure you could understand.

 ""It'll work out"" ""tomorrow will be better"". That's what my circle keeps explaining to me. Giving my life to Jesus, yea, I changed and I'm grateful for Him, my family, dammit, to be alive is beautiful! I'm still trying to figure out how this works. But the world hasn't changed. And I'm caught in the middle of it. The urge to dissociate and feel a ru- No, no I can't.. and since I can't, I have to bite the bullet and not take the easy way out of this problem. I wouldn't say it's  everyday because it's not. I go through moments, episodes or seasons where I'm enthusiastic about my life. Then, it's as if the floor caves in from right under me and I drop into the dark abyss. Freefalling. And looking in the internal mirror, I can sense it. It's still there, it seeks to destroy me. To destroy all who were born with this. To finish the job, one way or another. Through a substance, my own mind, isolating myself. I'm my own worst enemy. And eventually I see a light and I hold onto it for dear life. And out of nowhere, I'm back to where I was before the floor caved in. 

It really is beautiful here...Despite falling down a bunch of times in my life, I'm still standing. Bruised, I move forward. I read somewhere in that Good Book (The Bible, for those who didn't know its nickname) that one day, there is a place God is preparing,  for those who follow Him. They can live forever with Him, and diseases, disabilities won't exist. 

Where my depression can't flourish. Man, that does sound like paradise, doesn't it?

I can't explain everything what's happened to me that led up to this point on here. And when I say here, I mean this post, it's just too much. I'll leave that for a future posts. This just seemed like a new way to get my story out there. Because I haven't told too many people.. and frankly, I'm a bit embarrassed. But I think it can serve as aid to someone. The internet is vast like the deep ocean or space. So many of us in our own little world. I pray you find peace. 

It really is beautiful here.. My coffee is now lukewarm (sigh) alright, back inside I go.

1itgzif,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1itgzif,Okay I have this very good theory on why eunhyeok disappeared please hear me out once....,"So...I was talking with this girl on insta and I told her about my theory and she told me that she saw somewhere on tiktok that her friends might know something that she doesnt. As I don't have tiktok in my country so... I can't credit the creator so here it goes.

Look at 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th picture  he was contemplating a lot. A LOT. Like he wanted to tell soo ae everything but he couldn't bring himself to do that.

He himself called soo ae a sweet invasion. We can think that he wanted to tell soo ae about the deafness in his left ear but I am getting this hunch that cheolsu visited him to give him a warning about haru and mind you the whole fiasco where the whole school got to know about his father was around episode 100 or 102. And I think it wasn't ra im who exposed his father I think it was cheolsu or haru.

And in picture 6th and 7th why is cheolsu telling him to run away? For one moment we can think that he is just telling him to move on but was it too serious to go MIA on her? And for another moment we can think that the mold he is referring to is soo ae but what if it could be eunhyeok?

Haru was sad that nothing was going his way and I think he will have a lot of influence on dohwa's psyche. I think he offered  dohwa something.

And 8, 9, 10th, 11th and 12th picture  look at their body language why do they seem so tensed? And why do they force soo ae to date? Especially yeseo? Even soo ae notices that. There is one thing to note that they never asked soo ae to date in last 10 years but why now? 

And the 13thh picture just foreshadows his secrets. Like why does he seems sad for just spilling coffee on her. 

And also I think that eunhyeok's mother hates him secretly because look in the 14th and 15th picture how she got up once she got to know about his deaf ear. 


And I think his father cheolsu and haru are involved in his disappearance because as the scandal happens we can think that his father could have had gotten ransacked from his job and cheolsu or haru could have had offered him money.

The author is really about to cook something here.

Please let me know in the comments how you liked my theory.

Also it's a reposted I originally posted it on the r/operationtruelove platform too and wanted to know your opinion too.

I went on my usual hike to have a smoke on my day off.
On my way there it started sprinkling. I decided to stick it out, because I was really looking forward to trying this ""new to me"" stick. 
Luckily I had a light raincoat in the trunk.

My usual spot is wide open with no cover. 
I found a spot very nearby with a tree on a hillside, which provided meager, yet welcome protection from the ever increasing rain.

This Hefty 6x60 stick is nice. 
My first time trying a punch cut, which perfectly suited this large, rounded, box pressed cigar.

Construction is not overly firm and the draw was perfect.

Dry draw got me cacao, coffee, light barnyard and spice on the lips.

Upon lighting I was greeted with cacao, cherry wood, mineral, mild spice, with a smooth, mineral heavy retrohale. Just the smallest hint of bread and pepper. Smooth. 

Working through, the coffee is replaced with a bread note. Faint.
Medium body.
Cacao stayed the whole way to the nub, but was occasionaly replaced with either bread and or mild pepper. Possibly hints of anise here and there.
Stick finished medium/full.
Smoke output was huge from tip to nub.

I really enjoyed this stick, but was paying more attention to getting rained on, than I was smoking. 

I was smoking a little on the faster side, but the smoke held up to the nub, never getting too earthy or peppery as some smokes do when you are smoking too fast.

I'm really looking forward to trying another after a couple more weeks of sitting.
Hopefully under better weather conditions.

Will buy again.

names changed for reasons.

 my land lady's BFF, BRENDA just called to update us on a wild ridE shes been on for the last two-ish years.

Brenda used to 100% take care of her mom who was developing dementia or Alzheimers, however about two-three years ago she started going through a messy divorce SO the mom was entrusted to the sister Katelyn, for this period in time Brenda had fully paid for moms lodgings and care in TX. 

mid 2023

However once it was time to renew the lease for mom, Katelyn convinced Brenda, who was still going through a messy divorce proceedings and had no money, to let her relocate Mom to CA where Katelyn lived at the time, SPECIFICALLY SO MOM COULD LIVE WITH Katelyn in the guest house. Brenda had enough money to Pay for a Caretaker/nurse to help for an entire year.

at this point in time mom still had some sense of self and due to divorce proceedings it was decided to sign a power of attorney to Katelyn before she went off to California as moms mental situation was getting worse.

Brenda stayed in Texas to handle her business and mom went to cali.

somewhere around Jan 2024 Katelyn stops all communication to Brenda.

Brenda calls everyone she knows but nobody knows where Katelyn is, or mom.

Brenda finds the nurse she had hired and learns mom had a stroke(?) and the nurse had been let go. No one knows where mom is, Katelyn is not to be found. Her home was sold just weeks ago.

I think the cops did find Katelyn and mom, but could not tell Brenda where they were, that part is a little unclear to me. so the cops could do nothing else besides tell Brenda that are alive and in no danger.

Note: Brenda's mom has a very common first and last name apparently, so thats also why it took a while to find her.

Feb 2024 Brenda moves to Cali to find her mom, remember shes got almost no money, eventually three months ago a P.I. finds her mom who is 100% in the grasp of dementia/alz in one of the cheapest nursing homes ever, packed in like sardines or something.

Brenda cannot visit her mom because Katelyn told the home that mom is to have no visitors especially not Brenda. Brenda cant even find out how long her mom is going to stay there.

Last week, Brenda just decided to look up their childhood home in IL that mom had still owned but had been left vacant for a few years and the last thing anyone was worried about. 

and learned it was sold last month to a realtor and was up for sale again. All of the stuff is gone.

Nobody knows where Katelyn is.

Brenda just wants her mom back.

Brenda and Mom are in CA.

Katelyn who has power of attorney over mom is somewhere in the US.

I’m a very introverted and socially anxious person, because I feel so deeply, especially in groups, but last night, I decided to push myself and attend a talk by Dr. Gabor Maté. I knew the crowd would be made up of open, introspective people, and I really wanted to see him, so I tried to ignore the nerves.

When I got there, I felt the usual tight energy in my chest—more of a high-strung, buzzing sensation rather than outright panic. While waiting in line, I started spiraling a bit. People around me, some giving me looks, made me hyperaware of myself. I almost stepped out of line at one point, but I forced myself to slow my breathing.

I kept thinking, Just talk to someone, Cory. There was a mum and her daughter behind me, both chill, and after hesitating for a while, I finally turned around and asked the mum, “What brings you here tonight?” That one question changed everything. She opened up about her healing journey, her experiences with ayahuasca, and we had a really deep, interesting conversation. When the daughter came back, she told me about her struggles with ADD, and I shared that I’ve suspected I have it too but have been resistant to medication.

It felt amazing to connect with them. My anxiety didn’t fully disappear, but it eased up a lot. I still felt shaky, but I was trying to surrender to the moment. Being surrounded by so many different energies was overwhelming, but I adjusted.

When we went inside, I told them, “Nice to meet you, take care,” because I wasn’t sure if they’d want me to sit with them. Part of me worried I’d be intruding on their mother-daughter experience, even though the conversation had flowed so naturally. In hindsight, I wish I had asked, because I genuinely enjoyed their company. Even more than that, I regret not asking to exchange numbers. These were my type of people, and I would’ve loved to grab a coffee and keep the conversation going.

After the talk, I had the chance to approach them again but hesitated. The anxiety had settled a bit by then, and ironically, that made it harder to take the risk. When I was in fight-or-flight, it was easier to just say “fuck it” and go for it. But afterward, I overthought it and let the moment slip.

I’m feeling a bit down about that. I know I took a big step just by going and talking to them, but I still wish I had gone the extra mile. At the same time, I understand why I didn’t—I was already way outside my comfort zone, and pushing further would’ve been a lot. Still, it sucks knowing I’ll probably never see them again.

On the bright side, when I sat down, a guy who was also alone sat next to me, and we ended up having a great conversation, which helped me feel more comfortable. Even so, the anxiety never really went away. I got home, lay in bed, and still felt this buzzing energy in my chest. Not necessarily bad, but just there.

1itgte6,https://i.redd.it/ltdj5x3ew5ke1.jpeg,Tennessee Tree Huggers!! Is anyone interested?,"Like many other people, I’m heartbroken about recent political attacks on our environment. And I’ve seen it too many times, the question, “how can I help?” And not being given an apparent solution. 

I’ve signed every petition, I educate myself constantly on this topic (self educated, not a professional), I’ve donated any money I can, I’ve spread awareness. I do my own local trash clean ups once a week. I love nature and spend a lot of time hiking and exploring and appreciating the outdoors. But what’s next? I’ve asked it myself and I’ve seen it asked time and time again this year, what else can we do to help our planet and especially the national parks? 

Basically, I’m a huge Earth nerd and I know there’s more like me out there! 

I’ve been discussing this with people throughout the internet and it seems the best thing we can do right now is try and start local. 

So with that being said, I just started Tennessee Tree Huggers! An organized club of local Tennesseean environmentalists that want to meet up and connect with other likeminded Earth lovers in Middle Tennessee. 

Inspired by the unsettling current environmental news and recent political attacks on our planet (most recently the mass layoffs at NPS. I’m feeling especially compelled to try and do something to help our environment continue to thrive, even if that means starting extremely small and local. 

If I can get a few people interested, maybe we can meet up for coffee or a craft night to discuss what we can do together to help the planet and aid our local environment. I would love to hear other ideas. I am not an environmental scientist or professional in this field, but I would love to get together with likeminded people and discuss what we can do together to help the issue at hand. 

Ideally, I would love to organize local trash clean ups, hold nature walks, plant identification bird watching, wildlife related events, kayak trips, group hikes, book exchanges and hold semi-regular meetings to keep each other up to date on how best to navigate the recent political turmoil. Anything we can think of to help get people closer to nature and aid in conservation, wildlife, nature and the parks system in all levels.

Would anybody here be interested in joining me? Is there anyone here who *is* a professional and can contribute their ideas and education?

Please feel free to DM me here or find me on instagram @TennesseeTreeHuggers 

I haven’t made a website or email or anything yet, this is just a new concept. But I hope people will be interested enough to make this an actual club we can all enjoy and learn from.

The DF54 now has a new plasma ionizer design. The old design had two needles sticking into the chute coming in direct contact with the coffee grounds as they exit the Burr and fall down the chute. The new design puts the needles on the exterior edge of the exit of the chute...see pics. This new design does not make direct contact with the grounds. I assume this is an improvement from DF after the initial general disappointment with the effectiveness of the old ionizer design.

I have had the original design for a year and it definitely needs to be cleaned on the regular but that being said I am very pleased with its performance at its price point.

Before school started, we met some of the same people, a couple of whom became my best friends. Even though we were placed in different sections and had different classes, I always invited her to hang out with my friends from my section.

A few weeks into school, my friend Anna texted me to see if I was going to the beach with her and Kate. Kate never mentioned it to me, and when I asked if she had plans, she lied and said she was going on a solo walk—when in reality, Anna was picking her up. When I confronted her, she claimed she liked one-on-one time with friends, started crying, and canceled her plans. It was weird, but I tried to be understanding.

Then it became a pattern. She started inviting my other close friend, Natalie, on frequent runs, telling her she loved that they had “their own thing.” When intramurals started, I joined a softball team with Kate. She later excitedly told me she also joined an intramural soccer team—something we had both talked about wanting to do—but didn’t extend the invite. The next day, some guys at school asked if I wanted to play, so I joined. At every softball and soccer game, Kate basically ignored my existence.

She kept making new friends while still reaching out to my closest ones for coffee dates and hangouts—without me. I still never excluded her, but one day, after she told me she was getting coffee with a friend, I had also wanted to go study at a coffee shop so I invited my friend Anna and another girl to go study. We ended up at the same place. Later, Kate said she wanted to talk, started crying, and said she felt left out. I immediately flipped the conversation and pointed out that she was the one doing that to me. She admitted she had been doing that but said she didn’t know why. At one point, I asked “is the reason you’re inviting my friends to hang out without me because…” and she finished my sentence and said “to make up for the time you’re spending with them? No, I’m not doing that.” This all seemed like jealousy and insecurity at this point.

She then told me she was upset that I joined intramurals because she “wanted it to be her thing,” yet she had no problem copying things from my life—trying to be best friends with my closest friends, applying to a big law firm I liked (despite always wanting to be a public defender) and made sure to tell me about it, and now, signing up for the exact Madrid study abroad program I told her about a year ago. Only four students get to go, she had never expressed interest in Spain before, and there were 15 other cities to choose from.

Now, she’s reaching out to the other two girls in the program, trying to make plans. The last thing I wanted was to study abroad just to be stuck in classes with her. I assume she’ll live with the other girls while I live with my boyfriend, but I worry that if I want to be close to them, I’ll have to deal with her too. She was not a good friend to me, and I highly doubt she’s changed.

What do I do in this situation? Is there even anything I can do? Also, am I crazy for feeling like she’s copying my life or almost trying to be me…",5,1739999266.0,TwoHotTakes,16,0.86,False

I really hate the fact that basically all earbuds that are made today rely on sticking something in my ear canal to achieve fit and sound isolation. I find it uncomfortable to start and more and more painful the longer it is left in there.

I have tried a few different options so far:

* [Soundpeats Air4](https://soundpeats.com/products/air4-earbuds-deliver-wireless-lossless-audio): these have terrible manual controls, sometimes fall out of my ears, and have started to have serious pairing problems every time I use them
* [JBL tune flex](https://www.jbl.com/wireless-earbuds/TUNE-FLEX.html): ok manual controls, but can only connect to one device (I'd love to connect and switch between laptop and phone without having to re-pair); also fall out of my ears
* [Shokz open run pro](https://shokz.com/products/openrunpro2): I really love these. But I walk around my city and take the train, and anything louder than mild coffee shop noise is too loud for these to be usable in my experience. The other time when I don't like these is if I'm laying down or leaning against a headrest because the stiff band pushes the speakers out of place
* AirPods: these are ok, but have similar fit challenges + they're not better enough to make up for their cost
* AirPods Pro: good headphones, but I continue to not like having a seal in my ear
* [Edifier W320TN](https://www.edifier.com/global/p/true-wireless-earbuds/w320tn): similar problems: inconsistent pairing, fall out of ears

I'd really love something closer to the shokz in terms of shape, but that actually went in my ear (but not the canal). Something with ear hooks or a not stiff band that went around my neck would also be interesting to me.

G: what? Was that guy actually Conan? I knew he looked like Conan. Dammit!

E: no, this woman gave me a note with domestic violence information

G: why would - oh my God. That explains it! Why everyone has been so rude to me! The dirty looks, the shoulder checks - they think I'm an abusive boyfriend!

E: ....they think GEORGE COSTANZA is MY boyfriend?

G: Hey! 

It develops into an argument which makes George look even worse to the public.

Kramer and Newman have started a public hide and seek game that has thousands of New Yorkers join in. They take it extremely seriously but police officers catch them discussing tactics and suspect they're scoping out potential burglaries. 

Kramer convinces Jerry's GF to let him hide in her apartment and he gets access to the door. But he is sworn to secrecy and can't tell Jerry anything. But he seems shaken to the core. Jerry can't tell if it's a positive thing or a negative thing. ",13,1739999127.0,RedditWritesSeinfeld,0,1.0,False

I met her last year at a summer job. We had coffee a week later and then I had my suspicious, so I snooped at her facebook and I found out she's taken and engaged. Funny thing is we've talked and hung out since and she still hasnt directly told me about the guy. For all I know, i could think think he's a family member or...she knows that I know and is still welcoming me into her life.

we don't flirt, but we're pretty good friends. We have plans to hang out. Including a BIG PLAN tomorrow, to hang out at an amusement park. Just us.

To be honest, I've never done this before - been this close to someone who's taken. I always turn away from taken women. And also, I've never been this close to a woman and yet not tell her how I feel. So for all she knows, I could just be a really good platonic friend and so wouldnt that make me a bad friend if i suddenly say i have feelings?

I've been initiating for the most part, but just now she asked me if im free tomorrow to go to the park. im going. I just hope to have a good time with a good friend. Maybe we talk about some things we've been needing to discuss

other notes:

her relationship is currently long distance. 

I dont know if her guy knows about me just as how she hasnt told me about him...

I know opposite sex can still be friends and hang out 100% platonically. I've done it before. But this is different. She should tell me about her situation but she doesnt",0,1739998844.0,dating,15,0.5,False

What the main problem was she hated my partner for being too feminine and wearing some makeup, so she made up lies and tried to keep me away from him in our teens years. Well when I found out the truth, she got more abusive and I ran for my life. I don’t really feel like explaining it all but please know it was bad enough I felt like I could not live and I really wasn’t allowed to be an adult even the day before and of me turning 18. (No job, no friends, no going out alone or with people, no license, etc) Well I am much happier now, I live with my partner who takes care of me, works to help me get anything I need, and works with me daily to heal my trauma. Now I believe me and my mother can genuinely have a healthy relationship now that I don’t live with her. The only reason I gave her a chance though is she showed me a sign of growth after I spent my night praying for it. It was a package for me for Valentine’s Day with a letter that actually showed she reflected because when I left, I hadn’t told them exactly what they did wrong. I told them it was everyone and I needed to be left alone. Now that we are reconnected, she has brought me all the things I need, all of my clothes and belongings I left. She has acknowledged my partner. She brought him coffee when she got me my belongings. And next Saturday, I have to go to my parents to get some of my furniture because I need it. I’m just nervous because I told her we need to do it a day my partner’s off because I need his help and she accepted that, but I don’t know if she’s “allowing” him to come with to her home.(because my father is the one who has a truck so we need to be with him) I don’t feel comfortable going without him though. I have run all of this by him of course, I will not put him in a situation he feels unsafe or uncomfortable in. but the thing is that I keep praying they’ll accept him at least because he doesn’t deserve to be outcast just because he isn’t what they deem, manly enough. I don’t really know where else to go for advice on this with people who are gentle and understand a little bit of religious side of this because my family is used religion against me during this kind of stuff. I know I can’t stop them not liking him, but he really doesn’t deserve to be outcast when he’s been nothing but kind of them even after what they did to him.(trying to ruin his reputation and such.) does anyone have any advice that can help?

That's beyond the reach of most of us. But what we can do is reach our neighbors. Find common ground. Replace the government functions that took our tax dollars with a promise of service, but are now being taken from us.

Support or volunteer at food banks so the poor and homeless can cope with rising grocery prices.

Volunteer at street clinics that bridge the gaps in the care offered to the physically and mentally ill.

Work or volunteer at a thrift to help low income people replace goods that are skyrocketing in price.

Get to know your local cops. Figure out which ones still support American freedom. Work with them to make your area safe and secure. Give them what backup you can now that they're not getting it from above. Let them use your driveway as a safe spot to park and do reports or take a break. Buy them a coffee. Or just express your support. Wave when they're driving by with no lights or siren.

Support your local fire department.  They're going to be overloaded by people who can't afford their meds or are afraid to take them. Take the first aid classes offered so you can assist people before professional help arrives. Advocate for their budget. Check with your local station to see if they'll take snacks or freezer meals. Cheer if they're driving by with no lights or siren.

Plant a garden. Even a container garden on your balcony or porch. Plant some herbs or sprouts indoors. Plant flowers in red, white and blue. Plant flowers in other colors of the flags you support. Or put garden flags out in colors you support. I have a spring bird flag in colors that make it obvious it's in support of Ukraine without saying a word that can upset my Trump supporting neighbors.

The food supply will be impacted by the reduction in workers, fertilizers, tariffs. Be ready for that. Buy one extra can or box of food a week and either store or donate it. Figure out how to store and purify water in case the mains have a problem. Get a bottle of vitamins for each family member and start using them. Experiment with low cost foods like beans, rice, lentils, grain flours so you can make recipes your family likes.

I hope this is helpful for people who are homebound, can't get off work, or are at risk going out, so they can join us all in taking back our country.",3,1739998393.0,50501,0,1.0,False

His parents both have remarried to their current partners while he was in his 20s and we were dating (10 years together now). He doesn’t consider them his stepparents. I’ve gotta go into some background to hopefully make my confusion and question more understandable.

His mom is a wonderful human being who married a rat of a man. At this time, my husband “Charlie” and I were living at his mom’s house while she lived in another city. They had broken up at one point for the better part of a year. Let’s call him “Steve”. Steve and I never got along and I had no clue why. I know I got annoyed when he ate my things in the house during their visits, though he’d ask for specific things which we bought him and I’d never eat. He’d eat my things first. Steve had taken Charlie, his own daughter, and I out to dinner on his insistence to then tell the waiter separate checks when Charlie was in the bathroom. Charlie was unemployed during that time so I had to let him know. While it’s fine, I wish it was discussed where everyone was present and not the sneaky way he went about it. But whatever. 

Steve and my husband’s mom, “Nancy”, broke up that winter and she moved back into the house. Months went by and in the summer I learned why; Steve’s daughter, who is the same age as me (and an only child who used her parents divorce to cause chaos between the 2 of them to fight over her), was jealous Nancy was giving me attention over the Christmas holiday one night when she was drunk. I thought nothing of it, just my then-boyfriend’s mom being welcoming and honestly hilarious. I guess Steve and Nancy were arguing a LOT over it and she refused to apologize for being nice to me and liking other people. This resulted in them breaking up, I learned all of this from Nancy and Charlie.

They end up back together, fast forward 2 years to their wedding which I didn’t attend. I was at the rehearsal and he had bad mouthed me (or his daughter, I’m unsure) to his family and they were approaching me, asking me questions about things I didn’t know were spoken about me. “You’re the girl that got mad at him drinking your coffee creamer right?” Well yeah, I guess, I didn’t know I had made it obvious or that they knew my business. I ended up skipping the wedding as my anxiety got the better of me, and my husband understood. Nancy was sad but Charlie covered for me saying I felt sick.

Let’s fast forward to the present. Things with Steve and I have gotten better, I’ll admit. Mostly because our living circumstances have changed and I tend to just say whatever now, being comfortable in the family and having an amazingly supportive husband who doesn’t really like the guy either. Nancy’s aware of this, as most of her family doesn’t like him. 

With the first grandchild, he’s suddenly become extremely nice to me. He wants to kiss up on our baby (he hasn’t yet because we had a rule in place regarding vaccines), he wants pictures of her, he wanted input on her name (denied), he is smitten. He texted me throughout my pregnancy checking in on me and I found it to be the strangest thing.

So after all of that… I’m unsure how to handle him being a step-grandparent. I myself have a step-grandparent who I love. I keep trying to view it that way, but damn does he rub me the wrong way. And why the sudden liking me NOW because I have a kid? I’ve asked Charlie how he wants to proceed and he just shrugs, yet when I ask if I should send pictures of our daughter to Steve, he says no.

Do I just let things keep going the way they are and play it by ear? This is just unfamiliar territory to me and I’d like some insight from people who may be more familiar.",5,1739998077.0,stepkids,1,1.0,False

Only six years before 1836, South American statesman and general Simón Bolívar died in exile. As Gran Colombia collapsed around Bolívar and Francisco de Paula Santander, their political alliance dissolved, and they became estranged. By 1836, the situation in New Granada created a political moment that Santander saw as an opportunity to capitalize on Bolivarian idealism. He passed legislation rescinding New Granada's recognition of the sovereignty of Venezuela, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Argentina, and Chile. In 1837, Santander handed the reins to Francisco De Villamil, who led New Granada on a series of military campaigns over the next ten years, swiftly bringing much of South America under the control of the fledgling Gran Colombian state. However, Villamil became a political pariah due to his use of the military against indigenous protesters and partisans in the newly integrated territories. Notably, he lost the 1853 election to Antonio Leocadio Guzmán, an abolitionist intellectual and lawyer. Reforms were carried out under Guzmán, who also brought Chile into the federation through conquest.

Guzmán was unable to accomplish his goal of abolishing slavery due to pragmatic political alliances with the landowning elite. However, he is credited with reforming Gran Colombia into a constitutional republic with an elective system resembling that of the United States. Much of the landed aristocracy that characterized post-colonial society had been weakened by industrialization, concentrating land and capital into the hands of a burgeoning capitalist class. This, in turn, led to the rise of an Anglo-American-style yeomanry. Guzmán’s political alliances shifted to favor the urban middle class and industrialists. By 1860, Antonio de Herrera, a notable business magnate, was serving in an advisory role as limited deregulation and a shift away from mercantilism and government liquidity occurred. Some secularization was achieved through the efforts of the liberal government. That same year, Argentina was brought to unconditional surrender, but the overloaded state apparatus could only afford to offer it protectorate status. Before the 1865 election, Guzmán retired from political life as an honored statesman. Gustavo Manjarrés, another liberal abolitionist, won the presidency and finally began drafting legislation for the complete abolition of slavery, dealing the last blow to the old colonial elite. By 1869, emancipation had not been achieved, and Manjarrés lost the presidential election to Simão Arawak, a middle-class indigenous leader and Incan rights activist.

Arawak's presidency came as a shock to the conservative political order due to his syncretic faith. He represented a growing class of pan-indigenous, pan-Hispanic mestizo intellectuals and the urban middle class. His ideology was marked by classical Incan nostalgia—an increasingly popular concept in intellectual circles—and the idea of a federated Andes region. Arawak completed the process of abolishing slavery and won the 1873 election, extending voting rights to mulattoes. In 1875, he signed the Act of Federation, outlining a new constitution for Gran Colombia and officially changing its name to the Federation of the Andes. Once again, the United States served as inspiration for the framework of the constitution.

In 1877, Arawak won a third term and became regarded as the most beloved politician in the country’s history. His moderate-liberal populism appealed to the urban middle class and the rural yeomanry, the bulk of his supporters. Economist José Manuel Balmaceda was appointed to Arawak’s cabinet the same year and began overhauling the country’s financial systems. His policies included extensive deregulation and banking reforms that made private capital investment more viable. Arawak won the 1881 and 1885 elections as Andean GDP and population narrowly edged out Brazil’s after years of European immigration and local capitalists’ concentrated industrialization efforts. By 1889, Argentina had been reorganized into an autonomous province of the Federation, and compulsory primary education was introduced along with public schools, effectively ending child labor. Literacy surpassed that of Brazil, making the divergence between the two countries increasingly clear.

In 1893, Brazilian Emperor Dom Pedro II died in his sleep at the age of 68. A succession crisis in Brazil led to the rise of a military junta that was openly expansionist and hostile toward the Andean Federation. Arawak won another term as president, and the Federation’s GDP surged to 133% of Brazil’s. By 1897, Arawak’s role had become largely ceremonial while the liberal government carried out its agenda of market deregulation and maintaining the status quo. Still in office at age 66, he remained president simply because the Andean people refused to elect anyone else.

By 1925, the Federation remained stable and prosperous under the presidency of Bautista Saavedra, a lawyer and moderate liberal. Like his predecessor, he aimed to maintain the status quo. However, he struggled to manage a growing labor movement in the Federation’s cities, opting to ignore their demands and outright harass trade unions using the military. His re-election in 1929 triggered a massive general strike across the country. Faced with the prospect of class warfare, Saavedra and his industrialist backers were forced to negotiate. The federal government established regulatory boards overseeing occupational safety, public health insurance, worker protections, and old-age pensions.

By 1931, the so-called ""tripartism"" era—where the state acted as a mediator between labor and industry—had ended, with the government successfully brokering compromises that stabilized the economy. The strikes lifted, and the economy experienced a sharp rebound, causing a surge in national wealth after economic activity had been suppressed during the unrest. The resolution of the crisis dramatically boosted Saavedra’s popularity, allowing him to win a third term in 1933. Seeking to reconcile with business interests, he restructured the Andean occupation government in the Amazon basin, gradually allowing private capital into the region and dismantling state-owned enterprises. This led to a massive influx of investment in rubber plantations and oil fields, though with little oversight. The indigenous Amazonians and Lusophone mestizos made up the bulk of the exploited workforce.

By 1936, the Federation remains stable and prosperous under Saavedra’s leadership. Medellín’s financial centers handle 33% more daily capital flow than London. The Federation boasts one of the world's finest navies, a modern, well-trained military, and a powerful economy. It is the leading global producer of automobiles and exports vast quantities of oil, rubber, and coffee. Despite its prosperity and decades of reform, Andean women remain disenfranchised, illiterate men of no status still cannot vote, and tax reform is desperately needed. The lack of duties on dividends has led to increasing wealth concentration, deepening inequality.

The agricultural sector, still dominated by the Andean yeomanry, has only partially embraced mechanization, lagging behind other industrialized nations. Meanwhile, in Brazil, the collapse of the liberal government has led to another wave of anti-Andean revanchism, as nationalist and militarist factions call for the reclamation of the Amazon. The specter of war looms once more. Whether the Federation’s unprecedented economic and military dominance can sustain the ""Andean Century"" remains uncertain.",16,1739997720.0,victoria3,0,0.91,False

We have two nights on the Kona side for a work trip, then five nights in Hilo (I've been to the Big Island, but did not venture to the Hilo side, so thought this would be fun!)

I am working on planning our trip but struggling to prioritize what should be on what days! The things that are MUST DO for us: VNP, Mauna Kea at sunset, (the volcano winery!), and the waterfalls near Hilo..and my boyfriend wants to skydive (Lord help me) Open to all food recs, but our hotels do have breakfast!

Here's what I have so far:

Monday/Tuesday: Work conference

Wednesday: Check out of Kona hotel. Visit Makalawena Beach,  Ali'i Saltwater Swimming Pool and explore Kona. (**Any lunch recs around here?**) Drive to Hilo in time for a sunset at Honoli’i Beach Park (**what are the best beaches in Hilo for sunset :)??)**

Thursday: Sleep in recovering from work days and explore Hilo area waterfalls.  Hike Akaka Falls and Rainbow Falls. Relax in the late afternoon before visiting Mauna Kea for sunset & stargazing (about a 1 hour drive each way)

Friday: VNP day! Crater Hike and drive Chain of Craters Road. Spend a few hours in the park before driving down towards Punalu’u Black Sand Beach, and then back towards Hilo, stopping at the Volcano Winery :)

Saturday: **(This is where I'm like okay goodness this is a lot of driving**) Hoping to explore Hawi, hike down into Pololu Valley and drive towards Waipio Valley for the lookout. I'm thinking it'll be late in the day after all this and head back to Hilo for dinner... (I **hear great things about Hilo Bay Cafe, Hawaian Style Cafe?, but we must get some good poke while here!!)**

Sunday: Want to relax and explore Hilo. Maybe the farmers market by morning, **grab some amazing HI coffee,** explore Carlsbad Beach Park, and Coconut Island. Maybe paddleboard or kayak? I need some shaved ice too LOL. **What else is a must in Hilo?**

Monday: Our flight isn't until 9 PM, so if I get talked into skydiving (out of Kona), we will be checking out of our hotel, driving to Kona, and skydiving before a 9 PM departure. **If we don't, what have I missed??**

Got up yesterday. Packed gear. Tent dropped. Library to charge my stuff. Bus to right near marina. Pizza secured. Cup of coffee. To park.

I finally got Pandora to download my 20 year playlist for offline use yesterday. It's been refusing to do so for a while. I was surprised my subscription is still going. Tunes going. Gear down. Pizza. Coffee. Smoke.

'I should get a hold of Aaron.' Text, ""You got a guitar I can borrow tonight?"" ""Fuck yes I do"" He was the first person to hand me a guitar when I met the first few guitar players, the third night after I'd hitchhiked down to live on the boat. A tradition he's upheld every time I've played with those guys.

'Time to go get some beers...' Gear up. Gas station. Pack of Winston's and a twelve pack of Yuenglings. (I am celebrating.) To marina.

Guys walking up with guitars as I walk up. Into Captains Lounge. Gear down. Some, ""How's it going/Good to see you, etc."" Beer opened and tested for wetness. Guitars getting tuned. More guitar players coming in and tuning up. All guys I've spent many a night drunk, stoned as a creek rock, and playing guitar with.

""Yeah still got the boat. Just hitchhiking around looking for work. Dinghy took off a couple weeks ago. Gotta get a new one. I pulled the engine and tank and stuff before it disappeared. So at least I have that."" ""How'd you hold in the hurricanes?"" ""Didn't move an inch! That sticky anchor you gave me works like a champ!""

I'm drinking beers like I do so every day. I'm gonna blame the cottonmouth I had. We play some tunes, drink, Me and a friend step out to burn one. Back inside. Play more tunes. I'm trying to remember to record. I'm moving stuff to my sd card because I'm running out of room. More beer. Tunes. I start to realize that all the really good stuff from the night isn't getting recorded. Play more tunes. Beer. Weed. Cigarette. Tunes, beer, weed, cigarette. Tunes, beer, weed, cigarette. Tunes beer weed cigarette. Tunesbeerweedcigarette.  

'Fuck! I'm wasted!' Crack another beer. The night's pretty well done. There's three of us left. We're pretty well played out. It's been about seven hours of getting fucked up and playing guitar. We started with eight of us. At this point the three of us can play really well for about forty-five seconds of whatever song our alcohol addled brains can think up. And then... The train wreck happens. 😆

We shoot the shit for a few. Say our goodbyes. They bail to their boats. Gear up. Out. I talk to a guitar player I didn't know on my way out. The usual, ""You on the road?"", weather. ""You need an umbrella?"" ""I do."" ""Here. I've got two."" ""Awesome man! Thanks!"" 

A young homebum told me where there was good spots to camp when I went to get beer earlier. I'd also spied out an area before I got down here. I'm hammered. I hike up a small hill to take a piss. Set the umbrella down and completely forget it exists. Almost fall over three different ways with my pack on. Back down the hill. 

My spot is heavily blocked of with about three-quarters of on inch of water two feet wide, on some easy to walk on sand. Drunk as fuck I couldn't manage to ford that huge waterway. Ate shit with my pack on trying to get down a four foot hill that led to this mighty river. 😆

Got up. Decided to go on what my brain was serving up of dude's instructions from the before times... Where does a highly experienced hitchhiker setup his tent after nine beers?

Right on the rocks next to the railroad track. Can't stake it so my tent looks like some drunk guitar player set it up. Gear inside. Me inside. Pad off pack and unrolled. Coat and hoody set to pillow mode. Altoids tent ashtray out of pack. 'Might as well hit this dab pen.' (Like I needed that at this point.) Cigarette. Passed out in a drunken coma. Woken abruptly by trains going by throughout the night. Pass back out.

Got up this morning. 'Not too bad. A little rough, but nothing I can't deal with. Gear packed. A train goes by. Another one. I wave at the engineer. He waves back. And then the train stops. I'm about eight feet from this train with my gear ready to go. Dave Mathews is signing, ""Take these chances..."" in my ear. 'If there was ever an easy time to go train hopping...'

Gear up. Retraced my steps from last night having noted my new umbrella hadn't made it to camp. Found it on the hill. 'Nice!' Cumberland Farms for breakfast and coffee. Back to bus stop next to marina. Bus to spot I'd stayed at Monday night. Library next to Dollar General. Everything I need between those two.

In the first 3 months it’s was really just fun flirting and be both didn’t think it was anything serious, both getting out of recent relationships. It was all over the phone and nothing in person and he worked over night so sometimes I would stay up all night and talk to him. In return since he’s a lot more well off he would send me like 50$ for “coffee and gas” but I couldn’t drive… I never mentioned it. I would just use it for my Ubers and move along because I never took money from a man before and he would insist. Eventually we met in person and month started passing I didn’t let him continue sending me money but I never told him now after all this anytime things have come up he just thinks I don’t have a car … he asked to see my license once when I showed him my id and he said that was wrong if I had a license. I said that was old and my dog ate my license. It was kinda true he had just ate my wallet (he was fine). But I’ve tried really hard to get my license over all this time but my family is absolutely no help I have no friends and I’m broke so I’ve been hiding it from him until I’m assuming it all comes crashing down or doors open for me because he’s a really sweet amazing man and it’s been 2 years so I obviously am in love with him so if I tell him it will be like a betrayal I feel like he’ll think I’m lying about other stuff. It was only that I’m just embarrassed that’s why I didn’t correct it right away … and now it’s been way to long to just go back and tell the truth he’ll think I’m a monster … ",5,1739996887.0,TrueOffMyChest,6,0.69,False

1itfk52,https://www.reddit.com/r/AppliedImprov/comments/1itfk52/yes_and_style_games_to_energize_meetings/,"Yes, And Style Games to Energize Meetings","# 1. Yes, And…

💡 *Goal:* Foster a culture of collaboration, openness, and building on ideas.

# How to Play:

1. **Explain the concept:**
   * “This is a quick improv warm-up called **‘Yes, And…’** to help us get into a mindset of collaboration and positivity. Instead of shutting down ideas, we’ll practice building on them.”
2. **Choose a starting prompt** (or ask for one from the group).
   * Examples:
      * “Let’s design the world’s best office space.”
      * “We’re planning an over-the-top company retreat.”
      * “We’re launching a brand-new product that will change the world.”
3. **One person starts with a broad idea.**
   * *“I think our company retreat should be held in space!”*
4. **The next person affirms the idea with ‘Yes, and…’ while adding a new detail.**
   * *“Yes, and… we’ll have zero-gravity brainstorming sessions!”*
   * *“Yes, and… the food will all be freeze-dried astronaut ice cream.”*
5. **Keep going for a few rounds (2-3 minutes).**
   * Encourage **quick responses** and **build on details** instead of making big shifts.
6. **Wrap up with a quick reflection.**
   * “What did you notice? How did it feel to build instead of block? Let’s carry that energy into our meeting!”

# Sample Script for Facilitator:

*""Before we dive into today’s meeting, let’s start with a quick warm-up. This game is called ‘Yes, And…’ and it’s all about building ideas together. I’ll start with an idea, and the next person will say ‘Yes, and…’ to add something new. The goal is to support and expand, not to shut ideas down. Let’s try it out!""*

# 2. Yes, Let’s!

💡 *Goal:* Encourage enthusiasm, action-taking, and a supportive mindset.

# How to Play:

1. **Explain the concept:**
   * “This warm-up is called **‘Yes, Let’s!’** It helps us get into a mindset of saying yes to possibilities and working as a team.”
2. **One person suggests an action, and the group enthusiastically agrees.**
   * Example: *“Let’s all pretend we’re digging for treasure!”*
   * Everyone responds loudly: *“YES, LET’S!”* and **mimics the action.**
3. **Keep passing the turn to new people.**
   * Encourage them to **get creative**:
      * “Let’s all dance like penguins!” → *YES, LET’S!* (Everyone dances like penguins.)
      * “Let’s all pretend we just won the lottery!” → *YES, LET’S!* (Everyone cheers.)
4. **Play for 2-3 minutes and then wrap up.**
   * “Great job! We just embraced ideas fully and jumped into action. Let’s bring that same energy to today’s discussion.”

# Sample Script for Facilitator:

*""Let’s start today with a quick energy boost. This game is called ‘Yes, Let’s!’ Here’s how it works: One person suggests an action, and we all respond with ‘YES, LET’S!’ and do the action together. The goal is to embrace each idea with enthusiasm. I’ll start: ‘Let’s all stretch like we just woke up from the best nap ever!’ (YES, LET’S!) Great! Now someone else take a turn…”*

# 3. That’s Right, Bob

💡 *Goal:* Encourage supportive agreement and positive reinforcement in communication.

# How to Play:

1. **Explain the concept:**
   * “This game is called **‘That’s Right, Bob!’** It’s a playful way to practice agreement and affirmation.”
2. **The facilitator starts with a statement.**
   * *“I heard that today’s meeting is going to be the best one yet!”*
3. **The next person enthusiastically replies, ‘That’s right, Bob!’ and adds their own statement.**
   * *“That’s right, Bob! And I heard we’re all going to have the most amazing ideas!”*
   * *“That’s right, Bob! And I heard coffee has been magically refilled in the breakroom!”*
4. **Continue around the group.**
   * Encourage **fun, optimistic, or even slightly exaggerated statements** to keep the energy up.
5. **Wrap up with a positive statement.**
   * *“That’s right, Bob! And I know we’re all going to have a productive and fun meeting today!”*

# Sample Script for Facilitator:

*""To kick things off, we’re going to play a quick game called ‘That’s Right, Bob!’ It’s all about positive reinforcement and agreement. Here’s how it works: I’ll make a statement, and the next person will respond with ‘That’s right, Bob!’ before adding their own statement. Let’s get started! ‘I heard this is going to be the best meeting of the week!’ (Next person: ‘That’s right, Bob! And I heard we’re going to solve all our problems in record time!’) Keep it going!""*

# Final Tips for Your Friend:

✅ **Keep it light and fun.** These games work best when people don’t feel pressured to be “clever.”  
✅ **Model enthusiasm.** If the facilitator brings energy, the group will follow.  
✅ **Encourage quick responses.** Improv is about momentum, not perfection!  
✅ **Tie it back to the meeting.** After the game, make a connection to the meeting’s goals (e.g., “Just like in ‘Yes, And,’ let’s build on each other’s ideas today.”).",1,1739996593.0,AppliedImprov,0,1.0,False

I work as a barista at a small coffee place, and I greatly enjoy it, but I thought I'd meet more people and I feel like my bubble is calcifying. Anyway I'm very isolated and I think I need someone else to bounce off of. Preferably someone in a similar situation.

I am very much a liberal, very much an atheist. Though I don't mind spirituality.

Music-wise, I like Cake (favorite), System of a Down, Nine Inch Nails, David Bowie, Kansas, gorilaz, pink floyd Sugar Ray, and the like.

I like thrifting, art (wouldn't say I'm an artist but definitely steeped in artyness), reading, and things like King of the Hill, CDs, film photography, coffee, cats (I've got two), journaling, penpalling, weed, collecting (many different things), nature, and old shit (tech, clothes ECT)

I feel an increasing sense of surreality and disconnect, I often feel paralyzed in thought. I don't think I'm depressed so to say, but I feel like something is developing and i don't know what it is. Nothing feels real and my mental landscape is just strange.

1itfeev,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepsMcPasta/comments/1itfeev/i_work_at_a_gas_station_someone_keeps_buying_fuel/,"I Work at a Gas Station. Someone Keeps Buying Fuel, but They Never Have a Car.","I work the night shift at a small, rundown gas station on the edge of a highway that hardly sees any traffic past midnight. It’s a mediocre place at best, no security cameras, half the lights flickering like they’re dying, and a bathroom that no one in their right mind would use.

Most of the time, my shift is dead silent. Truckers stop by to grab coffee and stretch their legs, and locals come in every once in a while. But after 1 AM? The place becomes a ghost town.

It’s just me, the buzzing of the old fluorescent lights, and the occasional coyote howling in the distance.

That’s why it stood out immediately when someone walked in on foot at exactly 2 AM. I was leaned back in my chair, absently flipping through my phone, when the chime above the door rang.

I barely looked up at first, expecting the usual, a trucker grabbing coffee, some lost traveler asking for directions. But when I finally glanced toward the entrance, I saw him, for the first time.

No headlights in the lot. No car idling at the pumps. Just a man standing in the doorway, dripping in the station’s sickly fluorescent light.

He was thin, hunched slightly, like he’d been walking for miles. His clothes were ordinary enough, dark jeans stained with leaves and mud at the bottom, a gray hoodie pulled up over his head. He smelled faintly of gasoline.

He took slow, dragging steps toward the counter. I cleared my throat.

""Hey, man, how’s it going?""

No response.

""You need something?""

He didn’t blink. Just reached into his pocket, pulled out a crumpled twenty-dollar bill, and set it on the counter.

""One gallon,"" he muttered with a hoarse voice.

I waited for him to say something else, maybe explain why he was on foot, or where his car was. But he just stood there.

""You good, dude?"" I tried again, ringing up the sale.

Nothing.

I slid his change across the counter, and he picked it up without counting it.

Outside, through the station’s dirty front windows, I watched him take an old, battered jerry can from beside the pumps. The thing was weathered, sun-bleached, cracked in spots. I figured he probably had a car stranded nearby.

Maybe he was just pissed off. Or embarrassed.

Honestly? I didn’t care.

As long as he paid, whatever he did with the fuel wasn’t my problem.

The next night, at exactly 2 AM, the door chime rang again.

I looked up from where I was restocking cigarettes behind the counter, my stomach twisting before I even fully registered why.

It was him.

Same hunched posture.

I set the carton of smokes down and straightened up, watching him closely as he stepped forward and wordlessly slid a crumpled twenty-dollar bill across the counter.

""One gallon,"" he muttered.

I hesitated before punching in the sale. Something about him didn’t feel right.

""You got a car this time?"" I asked, keeping my tone light.

He didn’t respond.

His fingers twitched slightly where they rested on the counter.

I licked my lips and rang him up, keeping my eyes on his face as I slid his change across the counter. But he didn’t even glance down. He just grabbed the coins, and left.

Outside, I watched through the grimy front window as he made his way back toward the pumps.

He picked it up and filled it carefully, watching as the fuel poured into the old, cracked plastic. I noticed then how discolored his hands were, grimy, with dark stains under his nails, like he’d been working with oil.

I turned away as he capped the canister, telling myself, once again, that it wasn’t my problem.

The first time I hadn’t really paid attention to which direction he was headed in, but this time, curiosity got the better of me.

I expected him to head for the highway. Maybe there was a car waiting down the road, out of sight. Maybe someone was picking him up.  
  
But he didn’t go toward the road at all. Instead, he moved toward the woods.

The thick line of black trees beyond the gas station.

I just watched him go, not quite sure what to think. He stepped past the last pump, past the edge of the lot, and into the grass, moving at the pace of a snail.

I waited for him to hesitate. To glance over his shoulder. To acknowledge that he was leaving the only light for miles behind him.

But he never did. He just kept walking. Kept moving, deeper and deeper into the trees, until the darkness swallowed him whole.

And he never looked back.

He came back the next night.

And the night after that.

Every time, it was exactly the same. 2 AM. One gallon. Always cash. Always silent.

I honestly tried ignoring him. I get plenty of weird people here at times, and besides, people have routines, and maybe this was just his. But the longer it went on, the harder it was to shake the feeling that something was wrong.

I started paying closer attention.

I listened for a car engine approaching in the distance before he arrived. There never was one.

I glanced out toward the pumps after he left, expecting headlights flashing on the tree line. Nothing.

I even checked the back of the station once, just to see if maybe, somehow, he was parking in the darkness behind the building, but it was always empty.

All I knew for certain was that he came from somewhere, and when he left, he went back to it.

Most of my shifts from then on were focused on keeping track of him. As soon as he’d hit the treeline, he wouldn’t come back for the rest of my shift, until the following one. 

One night, around midnight, a regular trucker stopped in for coffee and smokes. His name was Frank, and he was the kind of guy who talked to fill the silence. Normally, I let him ramble while I half-listened.

That night, though, as he was stirring sugar into his coffee, he glanced out toward the empty parking lot and said, ""Hey, you still getting that weird guy at two?""

I blinked. “You’ve seen him?”

Frank shrugged, taking a sip. ""Couple nights back, yeah. I don’t think you were on shift, it was that weird kid that works on the weekends. I was parked outside taking a break when he showed up. No car, just walked right up and bought gas.""

He chuckled, shaking his head. ""Figured maybe his truck broke down somewhere, but I didn’t see one out on the road when I pulled in. He a local?""

""No idea,"" I admitted.

Frank took another long sip before muttering, ""Creepy guy, ain't he?""

I didn’t have an answer for that.

A few nights later, a man came in looking for a can of fix-a-flat. Older guy, probably mid-sixties, wearing a denim jacket that looked as worn-out as he did. He paid in crumpled bills, then lingered at the counter, watching as the man in the hoodie walked back out into the darkness with his filled jerry can.

The older guy squinted.

""Huh.""

""What?"" I asked.

He rubbed a hand over his jaw, his gaze still following the figure as he disappeared past the tree line. ""I've been in this area a long time now... still see him here frequently.""

That got my attention.

""How long is ‘a long time’?""

He glanced at me, a solemn expression adorning his face. Then he grabbed his bag and said, ""Long time, guy doesn’t seem to age, and if he does, boy does he age well.”

The door chime rang as he walked out.

I stood there, hands resting on the counter, my skin crawling.

Right after the man left, and the station had gone quiet again, I pulled the transaction records from the last few weeks and flipped through them.

Every night. One gallon. Always between 2:00 and 2:03 AM.

I kept going, flipping back through the old logbooks.

Same entry.

Every night.

Weeks. Months. Years.

I traced the records back as far as they went. The digital one only went as far back as 2013, so I had to dig up an actual physical one from the back. My fingers were stiff from gripping the old, yellowed pages. The earliest entry I found was dated October 19th, 1997.

One gallon. Cash.

And that was only as far as the logbooks went.

I stared at the numbers on the page, my mind racing.

I had only been working here a few months. Maybe the guy before me knew more.

I reached for my phone and pulled up Jerry’s number, the other night shift guy. He'd worked here for seven years. I had only ever spoken to him once, when he handed me the keys on my first night.

Still, I hesitated. How do you even ask someone about something like this?

It was nearly three in the morning, and I felt like an idiot for even thinking about making this call. But as much as I hated to admit, he was starting to get under my skin.

I took a breath and dialed.

The phone rang twice before a groggy voice answered.

""Hello?""

""Hey, Jerry. Sorry, I know it’s late.""

There was a pause. A sigh.

""Yeah, you don’t say. What’s up?""

""I just"" I hesitated, feeling even dumber now that I had him on the line. ""I had a question about the gas station. About someone who comes in at night.""

Another pause. I could hear him shifting, probably sitting up in bed.

""Which someone?""

""A guy. Shows up every night around two. Buys exactly one gallon. Walks off into the woods behind the station.”

""Ah,"" Jerry finally said. ""Yeah. That guy.""

""So you know who I’m talking about?""

""The manager mentioned him when I first started,"" he said. ""Figured I’d see him eventually. And yeah, sure enough, every night I worked, he showed up. Never missed a night. Never said more than a few words.""

I let out a breath I hadn’t realized I was holding. ""So... what’s his deal?""

Jerry let out a short laugh. ""Hell if I know. Nobody does. He’s just kind of an unspoken tradition for the night shift.""

""Unspoken tradition?""

""Yeah. I mean, at first it weirded me out. But after a while, he was just... part of the routine. Didn’t matter if it was raining, snowing, didn’t matter if the whole highway was shut down, that guy would still show up. Buy his gallon. Walk off.""

""Did you ever ask him anything?""

""Course I did,"" Jerry said. ""First time I saw him, I tried to be friendly. Asked if he needed a ride. Asked where his car was. Nothing. Just stared at me, paid for his gas, and left.""

""Not a word?""

""Not a damn thing. Eventually, I just stopped trying. It was like talking to a brick wall.""

I exhaled through my nose.

""You ever think about following him?"" I asked.

Jerry scoffed. ""Thought about it, sure. But I wasn’t that curious.""

His voice was light, but I could tell he was fully awake now. Probably sitting there, picturing the guy in his head just like I was.

""Listen, man,"" he continued, ""I don’t know what his story is, but whatever it is, it’s none of my business.”

""Yeah,"" I muttered. ""Yeah, I get that.""

Jerry yawned on the other end of the line. ""That all? Or you need me to tell you about all the weirdos that came in at three in the morning, too?""

""Nah, I think I got what I needed.""

""Good. Now let me sleep.""

He hung up before I could say anything else.

I thought about it.  
  
The “Tradition” as Jerry called it, kept going for the next few days. And in that time, the more I saw the man, the more I thought about it.  
  
About following him.  
  
It wasn’t until nearly a week later that I finally did.

The night was cold and windless. I stayed inside the station as long as I could, waiting until I saw him fade into the tree line like a shadow.

Then, I grabbed the cheap flashlight from under the counter and stepped out onto the lot.

For the first time, I realized how quiet the place really was.

Inside, I had the soft hum of the drink coolers, the buzzing overhead lights, the occasional crackle of the radio.

Out there? Nothing.

No cars, no wind through the trees, no chirping insects. Just my own footsteps against the pavement.

I hesitated at the edge of the lot, where the gravel thinned and the dirt path began. It wasn’t a proper trail, just a narrow gap between the trees where the brush had been trampled down over time.

I had no idea if I was actually making noise or if I just felt like I was. Every step seemed too loud, the sound of my breathing too obvious.

Ahead of me, the man moved at the same pace as always. I kept back just far enough that I wouldn’t risk him seeing me if he turned around.

But he never did. Never even paused. Just kept walking deeper.

The further we went, the stronger the smell of gasoline became.

At first, I thought maybe it was his clothes. A guy like that, hauling fuel around every night, of course, he’d smell like it.

But the air itself seemed thick with it. Not just fresh fuel, either, the stale, sour scent of old spills mixed with something burnt.

I could feel it coating the inside of my mouth.

The flashlight in my hand suddenly felt useless. I didn’t want to risk turning it on, not yet at least. Not while he was still moving ahead of me.

Instead, I relied on what little moonlight made it through the trees, barely enough to see the narrow path winding through the brush.

My legs ached from stepping carefully, placing my feet exactly where he had, hoping the ground wouldn’t betray me.

And then, just ahead, I saw the trees start to thin.

A clearing.

The smell of fuel was almost overpowering now, choking in my throat.

The man stepped into the open space, disappearing from view.

I stared at the darkened clearing beyond, my fingers tightening around the flashlight.

And then, slowly, I stepped forward. And finally saw what he was walking toward.  
  
The clearing was small, maybe thirty feet across, a break in the dense trees where the ground had turned to dry, cracked dirt.

And in the center of it sat a car.

Or, at least, what used to be one.

The body was completely burnt out, the frame rusted through, the metal twisted and warped from heat. Whatever color it had once been was long gone, the surface now just scorched black and crumbling.

I could see the remains of tires, but they were nothing more than charred rubber fused to the ground. The windows were blown out, melted along the edges.

The most recent fire couldn’t have been more than a few days old.

But the car itself looked like it had been rotting here for decades.

I barely noticed the old gas cans at first.

They were scattered around the car, some piled up near the driver’s side, others half-buried in the dirt. Some were so rusted they had collapsed inward, eaten away by time.

Others were newer.

Some were still full.

But my eyes weren’t drawn to the gas cans.

They were locked on what was inside the car.

I could see bones.

A skeleton, still strapped into the driver’s seat.

The seat belt had melted across the chest, and the remains of charred fingers were fused to the steering wheel. The skull had tilted slightly, as if watching me through the hollowed-out sockets.

The back of my throat burned.

I could see him, just a few feet away, pouring gasoline into the car’s open fuel tank.

The metal was melted through, split in rusted wounds.

Yet he was still trying.

I watched as the fuel spilled out the other side, pouring onto the dirt like water through a sieve.

He didn’t stop.

He just kept pouring desperately.

The smell was suffocating.

The puddle of fuel spread beneath him, soaking into his jeans, his boots, the sleeves of his hoodie as he dropped to his knees, shoveling at the dirt, trying to scoop the gasoline back into the tank with his hands.

He was muttering, shaking.

""It’s never enough.""

His voice was hoarse, almost pleading.

""It’s never enough to leave.""

His hands gripped the dirt, fingers curling, knuckles white.

""How much more fuel do I need to get out of here?!""

His voice rose, sharp and uneven.

""Why won’t it let me leave?!""

His breathing was ragged, wheezing.

I took a step back.

The snap of a twig beneath my boot sounded like a gunshot in the dead silence.

The man froze.

His hands hovered above the dirt, still trembling.

And then, slowly, he turned.  
  
His movements were stiff, like his body was just now realizing it had been noticed. The whites of his eyes were stained yellow, bloodshot and glassy, but locked onto me with startling focus.

For a long moment, neither of us spoke.

Then, in that same dry, rasping voice, he asked, ""Do you know why it won't start?""

I didn’t answer.

My heartbeat thudded in my throat, but I didn’t dare step back.

The man blinked once, as if waiting for something. Then he turned his head, staring down at the rusted-out wreck beside him.

""I put in the fuel,"" he muttered, fingers twitching at his sides. ""I keep putting in the fuel. But it won’t start. It never starts.""

I clenched my jaw, trying to keep my breathing even.

His head tilted slightly, his lips peeling back into a strained, almost confused expression.

""You know what I have to do, don’t you?"" His voice was barely a whisper now. ""To start the car? To go back to my family?""

I shook my head. ""I don’t know.""

His fingers twitched again, then curled into fists.

For the first time, he looked frustrated.

From the pocket of his hoodie, he pulled out a crumpled twenty-dollar bill and held it out toward me.

His hand was shaking.

""One gallon.""

I just stared.

His face twitched. His breath grew ragged.

""Give me the damned fuel!""

The words came out a snarl.

His hands lunged forward.

I staggered back, nearly slipping on the dirt. The twenty crumpled in his grip as he stumbled toward me, his movements now animalistic.

""One gallon!"" he shrieked. ""One gallon, and I can go home!""

His hands clawed at the air between us,  wheezing gasps came out of his throat. His eyes were wild, his body jittering like a puppet on broken strings.

And then he charged.

I didn’t wait.

I turned and ran.

The last thing I heard was his voice behind me, screaming. 

""I just need one more gallon!""

The trees blurred past me, shadows twisting and snapping under the flashlight’s weak beam. The smell of gasoline still burned in my nose, clinging to my clothes. I could hear something behind me, maybe it was him, maybe it was just the echo of my own footsteps, but I wasn’t stopping to find out.

I could see the glow of the station’s neon lights ahead, just beyond the trees.

I hit the gravel lot at full speed, stumbling, my knee nearly giving out. My chest was tight, my legs felt weak, but I didn’t stop until I was inside. I slammed the door shut behind me, locking it without thinking.

My hands were shaking.

The station was silent.

I stood there for what felt like hours, staring out at the empty lot, waiting.

But the man never came back.

I didn’t go back the next night.

Or the night after that.

I sent a text to my manager first thing in the morning. I quit. No notice.

Didn’t care if it burned a bridge. Didn’t care if I got my last paycheck or not.

I just knew I wasn’t stepping foot in that place again.

A week later, I was almost out of town.

I had packed up what little I had, ready to leave this place behind for good. But as I was driving past the station, something in my chest tightened.

I don’t know why I pulled in.

Maybe I wanted to convince myself it was all in my head. And that my morbid curiosity made me go through a fever dream.

The station looked the same as always.

Same flickering ""OPEN"" sign.

A new guy was working the counter.

He looked bored, scrolling through his phone, barely paying attention.

And standing in front of him, handing over a crumpled twenty-dollar bill, was the same man.

Still buying exactly one gallon.

I sat there, gripping the steering wheel tight, watching as he took the jerry can and walked out of the station.

He just turned and started walking, his feet crunching against the gravel.

Heading straight back into the woods.

And just like every other night, he never looked back.",0,1739996206.0,CreepsMcPasta,0,0.5,False

Costa signature blend - decent.
Starbucks dark blend - not bad.
Levazza Rossa - bit bland.
Slumber Jack - very bland.
Bear Market dark roast - probably my favourite one by far, but quite expensive. 

Any other home-brewers out there recommend what to try next? Hoping to find something similar to the bear mrkt blend but at a reasonable price. Based in Dublin. Thanks

Do I need to beat the boss again after doing it all? I don't mind, but don't want to and that's not it. Do the blessing tree things count? I never used those as I didn't need to.

Just For Pun -Use the Bamboo Bat to bat a bat in Ice Caverns.  
Weightless -Stay airborne for an entire boss battle.  
Beast Mode- Journey to Sencho Bridge without dying.  
More of a Coffee Person - Complete the game without using the Tea Kettle to heal.  
Particularly Unmanageable Pogo - Achieve a combo of 33 or higher on the Armakillo boss.  
Master of the Teal Lotus - Complete the game without dying.  
Adding Salt to the Wound - Defeat The Sakura Shogun twice.  

None of those seem to point to anything that should stop me getting 100%.  

I also have some left over resources (6 crystals, 5 silk, 8 root, 4 petal, & 12 bamboo). Despite buying everything I see and building everything.

I started thinking that my aeropress is lacking of what I really need.

I buyed this beautiful coffee from Congo, notes are strawberry, blackberry, and chocolate.  
I can't get out as much of strawberry notes, but blackberry and chocolate are very present.   
  
I buyed 1kg/2.2lbs, and I tryed out a lot of recipe in the last weeks, from 10 minutes brew to 1:30, coarser, finer, even finer almost for espresso, boiling water, 82°C water etc. everything I tried out didn't bring out the strawberry notes. (Except one time that I used the steam wand to heat up the coffee, tryed out the next day, didn't had the same result lol)  
But when I smell the bag, I can smell those notes of sweet strawberry, so it makes me really ossessive to brew this coffee right haha.

So I was wondering if investing in a pour over equipment would ""solve"" this problem.

I normally drink medium roast with aeropress, and I don't like coffee that is very acidic.  
I tend to go to with notes of red fruits or floral for the most.  
I like coffee with body or without, I care more about the notes and I enjoy both worlds.

Here are coming my questions;

Should I invest in a pourover equipments for my needs?  
If yes, what should I buy? The differents brands are very confusing to me.  
Dripper or gooseneck?

If you are wondering.  
I don't have this kind of problems with my aeropress often, but with some coffee (like this one) I can't get it right. I have a good grinder, the Mazzer Philos with I200D burrs.
