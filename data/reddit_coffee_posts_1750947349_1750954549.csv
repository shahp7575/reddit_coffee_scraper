- boy from dating app.  We texted for a few days.  He was nice.
-he asked to meet for coffee.
-i asked for a phone call instead
-i called and we just small talked for an hour.
-i was super bored and frustrated the whole time.  Like, pizza?! Shouldn’t we be sharing meaningful details about ourselves and connecting?
-i told him i have autism and i have special needs and he told me not to talk about myself like that, and that i’m smart  (i wasn’t being self deprecating.  I was explaining a meaningful detail about myself.
-even more frustrated, but i just listed and stayed polite.
-afterwards he texted me and said he liked talking and he likes me, i have no idea why.  I barely spoke.

Should i have just told him to fuckoff when he was being ableist and dismissive of key characteristics of my identity?

Should i keep talking to him and see if i learn to like him, and try to educate him?

There has to be some kind of balance to this, right?

This is just an example, buy in general, how do y’all that are dating handle this kinda stuff?

Is it just that he may be neurotypical and that immediately makes us incompatible?

Could he have been ND and just nervous or something?

Last night I went to the casino and was taking “self time” and was up 300+ then lost it, was up again around the same amount, and I just couldn’t leave and lost over 400. What’s the point. I’m ready to self ban. I’m 6 wks postpartum and it’s really 400 I couldn’t afford to lose. It’s not just the 400. I’ve been gambling for years. I haven’t saved anything and I’m in my early 40s. It’s something my partner and I like to do, it’s one of the only things we do in of habit and waste, and I just can’t be this way anymore. I have a toddler and a newborn. We live about 12 minutes from a casino. I wish we didn’t. The next one is about 45 minutes away. If I was really dying to go that’s how far and I’d likely not.  At least not impulsively with limited free time. We also talk about only going together if it’s date night… which never happens but would be nice.. to limit our ability to go. He has more self control than I do but I’d hate to think of how much we’ve lost over the years. Im going to start being frugal in every aspect of my life. No more ordering food, no more iced coffee, no more gambling. Work out in the mornings and get healthy. Take better care of myself. I need it for myself and my children. And I’m going to save as much money as possible. We’re getting a safe and going to log every deposit. I’d trust that more than in my account, and I could visually see it and we can set saving goals together. I hate that I have to go in to self ban. He says don’t do that, just don’t go” mmmm no. Every time I lose I say no more… and then I think I can spare some money and spend 5 times that. It wasn’t that bad but you do it 3 times in a month and it’s sickening. We would watch videos of people gambling on YouTube, ( he mostly does than me ) we have all the casino apps ( deliberately staying away from real online casinos ) and I’m just done. We have kids to support. I’m sorry for those who are going through it and even worse. It wasn’t like a drug a tried once and couldn’t stop, I used to buy scratchers at age 15 from my local donut shop. I’ve always liked gambling. I’d rather go shopping.

Chapter 1

Sitting on the couch during an ice storm, I scrolled through options to watch on TV as the lights flickered, making me wonder if the power might go out. The wind picked up even more. I got a little spooked and calmly reassured myself that everything was okay. Not quite convinced, I peeked around the room just to make sure.  From the vantage point of my maroon couch, I could see all of the great room and part of the kitchen with the same gray flooring. Nothing stirred. Letting my caution wane, I told myself to stop being paranoid. A bowl of popcorn sat on the coffee table in front of me, so I lifted it and returned to my focus of finding a program to get lost in. After a few remote clicks, I settled on a show about buying houses instead of a thriller or a horror movie. My heartbeat soon returned to normal and I laid back to enjoy a moment of peace.

  At that moment, cool air seeped through cracks around the ill-fitted windows, so I pulled a comfy blanket around my shoulders. Winter has been long and brutal. It reminded me of personal darkness of so long ago…and his name was Vincens Lefebvre. Not a good idea to think about him. My blood pressure shot up again. 

  “I can’t believe I’m thinking about him,” I whispered to myself, though I’m sure I was lying to myself. After all, he was pretty hard to forget.

I turned the volume up on the TV so that I didn’t feel alone. I needed noise to drown out intrusive thoughts. Maybe it was curiosity. Maybe it was stupidity, but in the warmth and safety of my home I decided to look up that man I once dated. In my momentary daydream, he walked as if in a cloak of crime and bullets. It wasn’t too exaggerated. This man loved his guns. No wonder he became a gun dealer whether legally, illegally or a bit of both. It was 10 years ago when I was backed into a wall and maybe a little bit self-destructive. I knew he was trouble from the first sight of his smirk. Thin and sly like a weasel, he was intelligent, though used it for trouble. With dark hair and piercing eyes, he stared at me like an eagle about to tear into its prey. He tilted his head slightly as if considering me for some dark end and I questioned my ability to escape. Luckily, I had or so I thought. I reached for my laptop and dared facing this old darkness. Maybe I should have heeded the warning inside my gut a moment ago. I had just gotten myself to feel safe.

  And here I am, now searching for this old online match from a dating service. After a few tries, I found him on Facebook. His profile pic was a photo of him and his adult daughter, a lovely woman with brunette hair and a warm smile. He was so proud of her. The apple of his eye. She was the only thing he’d let into his atrophied heart. That left little room for me or anyone else.

  After I got to know him, I soon realized he wasn’t the nicest of people. What he did to her mother troubled me. He shared the story about how he and she were separated and he wanted custody, so he would try to set her up. Once he had invited her over to discuss coming to terms for the divorce. He gave her a drink and smoked pot with her at his insistence, pretending to want to work things out in a civil way. When she left, he called the cops and told them that she was driving under the influence of alcohol and drugs. They arrested her. This man had no heart, so I had no doubt he would have done something like that to me if I crossed him. Of course, I broke things off shortly after that.

  It seemed odd that he never found a long-term relationship in all this time and still included his daughter in his Facebook cover photo. It seemed he kept her as his property and seemingly hooked close to him, as if a prize he won in the fight with her Mom. That is all that he cared about. It made my stomach nauseous. There was nothing healthy about it. Why did I allow myself to date such a monster?

  What else can I say about Vincens? For one thing, he was sly. He was also smooth like a predator and calculating. His nose was a little like a curved beak and his eyes menacing. I’d say he was average height or a little shorter, but his manner was self-possessed. He acted like a man on the make. He exuded a sense of power and was willing to do anything to keep it. I admit that it was hypnotizing. 

  I haven’t thought about what happened in a long time. I hadn’t wanted to face it. Maybe now I could try. To start, I took a deep breath and tried to compose myself. At that moment, a branch tapped against the window from the wind, causing me to jump. I sighed in relief when it wasn’t him. Bear with me now. I’ll try to tell this story. I’ll start slow. This is what occurred:



We met online and exchanged a few messages. We didn’t have a lot in common, but he had a job and seemed like a family man who loved his child. How bad could he be? The first time he came to my house to pick me up I pulled back the curtains to see what I was getting myself into. His online ad had shown him standing on a small white fishing boat and looking lean with a tan. He was fairly attractive in the picture. I hesitantly said to myself, “We will see if this is true.” Many people lie in their ads and misrepresent themselves, so I snuck a peek when the gray Audi parked out front. Slow and calculating, as if ready for anything, a lean man emerged and scanned the front of my home. Chills went up my spine as if he oozed a serial killer vibe, but I was going through a separation with my first husband, so what the hell? I needed a drink, so I grabbed my jacket and went out to meet him.

   My house was a one-story two-bedroom brick ranch on a quiet street. I planted flower beds by the front porch and around the single weeping willow to give it some color. Deep down, I wondered if he was assessing me or concluded that I might be plain and simple too, behind whatever effort I take to conceal that fact. I guess I was a little nervous. I felt vulnerable. 

   “Hi, you must be Vincens,” I said with a warm grin. I greeted him like a dim bulb in a horror movie; too dumb to realize impending danger.

   “And you must be Vania,” he remarked with little enthusiasm, though I guess he seemed willing to continue with this date. He already had seen my pic and profile, so I wasn’t sure why I sensed something that disappointed him.

  We all have our intentions, I guess. I don’t need anyone to understand. He eyed me like a man just seeing what I had to offer. Wearing gray slacks, black boots and a loose blouse, I swayed my hips and held my head high as if saying, “Let’s do this. I’m in.” Then with a nod, he opened the door for me. I smiled slightly and awkwardly got in, as if aware this could be my doom. Then again, I’m a stubborn woman who will give him a fight if need be, so I put my seatbelt on and agreed to his suggestion of a quiet bar at the beachfront. I needed the burn of alcohol and the ensuing dimness of my pain. 

   Along the way, we chatted about our jobs and what kind of food we liked. As we reached our destination, which was a cozy wooden building off the boardwalk with a large outdoor patio out back, I tried to just enjoy the moment without expectations. The blanket of night comforted me as well as the gentle breeze, although I felt so insignificant beneath the stars. I longed for connection. Could this be one?

  At that moment, a model-thin hostess with a ponytail led us out back to a table away from the crowd and handed us menus. She seemed a little haughty, but politely smiled and said our waitress would be with us shortly. I realized then that Vincens was staring at me, though I certainly wasn’t as attractive as the buxom hostess in tight dress. I tried not to second guess things. So far, this was going okay. A lit red candle sat in the center of the table and we had a table to ourselves by the railing. I took a moment to appreciate it. Yeah, this was nice.

   “What would you like?”

I admit I liked his voice. I liked it fairly deep and a little hint of an accent. Of course, that little bit of French enticed me. He wore a black shirt with a gray jacket, so we kind of matched color-wise.

   “What do you suggest?” I asked.

   I’m sure he was a man who liked to take charge. I figured I’d give him that illusion. I could play the game.

   He said,“How about a Zombie? That might be fun.”

   “You mean I should choose something to knock me out?” I jested, though realizing he probably wanted me brain dead for real. Maybe that’s how he liked his dates.

  “Sure. If that’s your thing,” he teased.

  “Or yours.”

   His smirk widened toward the left side of his mouth and his eyes darkened in challenge. I’m sure my twisted side egged me on.

   I added, “Actually, it sounds perfect. I’ll have one.”

   He softly laughed and ordered for us. He chose Long Island Iced Tea. The waitress nodded and left us alone.

  “So you used to volunteer at Legal Aid? I found your profile interesting,” he remarked, studying me suspiciously and then added, “Do you really care about the law?”

  “Shouldn’t I?”

   He laughed again, but this time it was sinister. He seemed amused and then glanced to the left, toward the inside of the bar. I wondered if he checked out other women. His attention kept returning to a certain point. It kind of bothered me. I tried guessing what preoccupied him.

   Then he quietly told me, “The F.B.I. are watching.”

   “What? Why?”

   Confused, I turned to see what he was looking at and noticed a tall blond man standing inside the restaurant, staring out the window in our direction.  Was that who he was talking about? Stiff, focused, he wore a dark suit with a crisp white shirt. I had never seen an agent before, so I guess he fit what I might have imagined. I must admit that the steely stare unnerved me a bit.

   “Why would they be watching?” I asked with a nervous laugh, trying to assess Vincen’s body language to gauge whether he was lying and teasing me. Otherwise, fear would have overtaken me more than it did. I started to become alarmed. My hand trembled as I lifted my glass for a sip.

   He shook his head as if to dismiss it and took a long sip of his drink. 

   “It’s not important,” he finally said, glancing down, as if it was a joke and then shrugged. “After all, you don’t know what kind of shady character I might be.”

“Or me,” I suggested, which made him laugh harder, especially when I added, “I might be dangerous.”

“Yes,” he teased, “I’m sure you are in their crosshairs…or should be.”

“Exactly. I might be an international counterfeiter,” I joked, with a shrug. “Who knows?”

   “In that case, the Secret Service would be watching you.”

   “Oh,” I said, “Well, maybe that man watching us just finds me attractive.”

   He leaned closer, tilting his head slightly as if considering me carefully. I think I’m not quite what he expected. Maybe he wanted me to be fleeing at the thought of agents or possible danger. My gut tensed.

   A little worried, I asked him, “Is there something I should know?”

   “I guess it depends on how well this date goes first. Then we’ll see.”

   “Might be too late. I’m getting a little tipsy.”

   “Then off to a good start, Vania.”

The sound of my name on his serpentine tongue gave me goosebumps. Common sense told me to get up and run, but when I looked back toward the supposed F.B.I. agent, there seemed to be another man with him. He had dark hair and an equally intense stare. I kind of didn’t want to walk by them in case it was true. I felt trapped. Then again, the agents intrigued me.  Excitement coursed through me. Something about the other man really got my attention. I wondered what it felt like to touch the man’s black jacket or his clean shaven face. If only a handsome creature like him stared at me with desire I’d be thrilled; not with him being the Law, and I, some criminal. 

  While Vincens took a moment to check his ringing phone, I decided to see if the men were still focused on us. Gathering my nerves, I peeked back at them and saw that both handsome men had taken a seat, but still staring intently as if absorbed in us. Why? Were they really agents and was I in danger? I took a swig of my Zombie. I suddenly felt as if getting sucked into an eddy of white water, not sure where I’d end up. I returned my attention back to my date, who seemed set upon charming me. He touched my hand and then held it. 

   As the evening progressed, Vincens shared stories about his boat and his love of fishing, as well as his life as a single father. Questions arose. I didn’t ask him why he was single. I didn’t see why he couldn’t find a partner if he wanted one. I imagined all sorts of red flags. I guess the bigger question was – Why was he interested in me? I was an average-looking blond, nearing thirty, wearing wool slacks and a black blouse unbuttoned the top three buttons, though my B bust would have allowed more. The way his eyes appraised me up and down, I guess he thought I’d do for whatever his intent happened to be. I assumed sex.

  “How about we go somewhere else? It is still early.”

  “Okay.”

   I really didn’t mind, though maybe I was indifferent either way. Actually, maybe I didn’t want to be alone. I needed company. My heart had been so broken recently and I wanted to feel alive.

  Vincens watched me fumble to stand. I tried to steady myself in my heeled boots, which I wasn’t accustomed to that high of a heel. He protectively wrapped his arm around me. I was too busy trying to work my way through the crowd that was leaving at the same time that I didn’t see the agents at first. A few loud women finally veered out of the way and let us get by. As we were about to leave the place, I glanced back at the mystery men as I was led away, almost wishing one of them would step in and pull me toward him. Maybe deep down, I knew I was in danger. Of course, why did I think they cared to save me? It didn’t seem on their agenda, because they let us go. They left me to my fate. Maybe I just wanted them to care about that.

   Vincens led me to his car and asked, “How about my place?”

   The answer should have been an obvious, “No,” but I actually said, “Let’s go.”

   I guess it was the loneliness gnawing away at me. I hated online dating. All the other ads bored me or seemed superficial. At least, I was having a pleasant moment and this guy seemed interested in me. He had a job and seemed well groomed, so I guess I just needed to mark serial killer off my list and we were off to a good start.

 

So that is the creepy story about how I met Vincens Lefebvre. I’m long past this memory and felt stupid to be revisiting this nightmare, but here I am doing just that. Needing a distraction, I got up to grab an iced tea from the fridge. I probably preferred alcohol as my nerves were shot, but I didn’t want to cloud my judgment. That never fared well.  As it turns out, he later told me it had really been agents watching him. There were two worlds and one in between:

No one warns you how social you have to be working in-office. Sometimes I don’t want to make small talk in the kitchen while I wait for my coffee. I don’t want to do the smile and “hi how are you” when I pass someone walking to the bathroom, or even worse IN the bathroom if someone happens to be washing their hands at the same time. And if you don’t participate in the niceties then you’re the rude or off-putting one. Somedays it takes an extreme amount of energy to even muster up the polite half-smile and head nod. 
There are times I just want to be invisible and get my work done without having to acknowledge every person I see. I also work in an open office which can get overwhelming, but noise cancelling headphones and white noise playlists are my saviors.

‍

**Why This Pick?**

The Twins (finally!) managed to bag a win yesterday, but I have to take the Mariners for plus money here. Seattle’s offense has been far more reliable than Minnesota’s, and despite yesterday’s shutout, I think the Mariners will resume their scoring tear in this encounter. The Twins will start Simeon Woods Richardson (5.06 ERA), and while he’s had a couple solid outings, Minnesota has lost all 3 of his last starts. Take Seattle to win for the nice price, friends.

How do I talk about it,"There’s this guy who used to be just a casual college friend. We weren’t close back then but after six years, we reconnected because we both live in the same city now. We met up with his group of friends who are genuinely lovely and they even celebrated my birthday with me. We had drinks, stayed over at his place in a group setting and slowly started hanging out more.

Over the next few weeks we’d go out, sometimes just the two of us but mostly with his group. There were sleepovers involved and I’d usually crash on the couch or share a bed with him. It actually made me admire him more because he was always kind, funny and respectful.

One time though, I got super drunk and accidentally puked all over his bed and him. He didn’t make a big deal of it, just cleaned up, made me coffee and was incredibly calm. That moment, weirdly, made me start liking him more.

Then came the night. We were both mostly sober and I ended up sleeping beside him. He put his arm out, I rested on it and then he pulled me closer and kissed my neck. I liked it but I wasn’t sure what to do, so I got up, used the washroom and came back. We cuddled the whole night but when he leaned in for a kiss, I shook my head no. He didn’t push it and we just cuddled till morning.

After that, things kind of went back to normal. No mention of what happened. I still saw him and his friends regularly, still slept next to him a few times but he never made another move. I once rested my hand on him during sleep but he didn’t react or reciprocate.

Eventually he went on a vacation for a few months. We kept in touch via memes and I stayed close with his friends. But ever since that night, I keep replaying everything in my head. I’m honestly starting to feel something deeper, like I have a lowkey crush or more, but I don’t think he feels the same.

He’s not the type who talks about dating or love and I’m scared of bringing this up because I really don’t want to ruin the friendship or make it awkward with the group.

Now that he’s back after 4 months, we’re hanging out even more group hikes, dinners, the usual. He still invites me to everything and includes me in plans. But we don’t sleep in the same room anymore and when we meet I get only friend vibes from him.

So I’m torn. I still feel something for him. I don’t think he feels anything back. But I can’t seem to get out of this loop in my head.

How do I emotionally detach and just enjoy the friendship again? Or am I reading this all wrong?",2,1750953922.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

We’ve been travelling full-time as a family and honestly, this island ended up being one of our favourite stops so far.

If you’re heading that way soon, here’s what we did across five days. Nothing overly structured, just what worked really well for us with two young kids in tow.

**Day One**  
Tropical Dream Center in the morning. It’s shaded, relaxed, and has great views from the spiral tower. After that, we walked the Bise Fukugi Tree Road its short, peaceful and mostly shaded the whole way. We finished up at Emerald Beach, which became our favourite. Loads of space, soft sand, calm water, big shaded canopies and lifeguards on duty.

**Day Two**  
We went full family-tacky and did Pineapple Park. The pineapple theme song is on loop everywhere, we rode the pineapple cart, and we ended up buying pineapple wine and cake in the gift shop.. Lunch at Coco's , where we had a robot waiter. The kids were obsessed. We ended the day at Nago Citizen Beach quiet, peaceful and easy to access. We had thew whole thing to ourselves on the day we went. Why do locals not seem to frequent the beach? Everyone we went to seem to have hardly anyone there?

**Day Three**  
Ta-Taki Waterfall hike. About 45 minutes upriver with rope climbs and wading. One of the best things we did. Our kids absolutely loved it. Afterwards we had lunch at Kishimoto Shokudo a small soba shop. Very local, very fast, very good. Then went shopping in Aeon (really good value there).

**Day Four**  
Ginoza Splash Park in the morning and also a massive playground connected by a footbridge. Popular with American military families, so our kids made friends easily. In the afternoon we visited Churaumi Aquarium. It’s impressive, especially the main tank, but the outdoor areas are small and dated. Still worth a visit. We wrapped up the day back at Emerald Beach, which became a bit of a comfort spot for us.

**Day Five**  
American Village. Absolute sensory overload but a fun way to end the trip. Arcades, bowling, photo ops, and even a full-time Christmas shop with strict signage warning kids to behave. We grabbed iced coffees at Climax Coffee and walked the seafront path along Sunset Beach to close out the trip.

We are British but really really enjoyed the American village. Kids absolutely loved it.

We stayed in Motobu and would 100% recommend basing yourself there. It’s quieter than Naha, better value, and much closer to the places you’ll probably want to visit anyway. We stayed in a place called Grandma’s House  a traditional Japanese-style rental that felt like something out of a Studio Ghibli film. Full kitchen, tatami floors, loads of space. Loved it.

I’ve been thinking about moving to Chicago since my first visit in the winter of 2023. I went back again last August to see Omar Apollo, and on the way home, I found myself in tears knowing I was returning to my hometown in the neighboring state. I’ve lived in my capital city my whole life, and with my golden 27th birthday approaching this fall, I feel like it’s time for a real change.

I currently work as a Special Education Para Associate and also as a server, and I genuinely love working in the service industry. I see myself continuing that path in Chicago. I’ve been sitting with this decision for almost two years now, and I’m finally ready to take the leap.

Before I do, I’d love some insight from locals about what to expect:

* How realistic is it to sign a lease without already having a job in Chicago?
* Should I work with a leasing agent or broker, or try finding a place myself using apps like Zillow, HotPads, or Facebook groups?
* How competitive is the serving job market right now?
* Are there any restaurants, bars, or coffee shops that regularly hire and are welcoming to newcomers — just to help get my foot in the door?
* What are your favorite *non-touristy*, everyday parts of living in the city?
* Is it better to move before signing a lease, or should I lock in housing ahead of time?

Thanks in advance to anyone willing to share some insight or advice. I’m excited and nervous, but I know it’s time.",2,1750953612.0,AskChicago,4,1.0,False

Lately, there’s been a flood of M4F posts and vague “looking to vibe” kind of stuff. It’s starting to feel like just another place for people to drop bait and hope for random DMs. That’s not what we’re building here.

ChennaiConnects was meant to be different. A space for genuine connections, shared experiences, and just being yourself, not another anonymous inbox-filler. So here’s where we draw the line: we’re only allowing activity-based dates or meetups from now on.

🚨 So from now on:

 1) Only activity-based date/meetup posts are allowed, no other personals are allowed 
 2) Title must include: activity + age + orientation/intention
(e.g. “Movie night + filter coffee | 28M looking for 25-30F”, or “Board games | 30NB looking for friends”)
3) Use the flair: Date

This isn’t about policing, it’s about protecting the space. We want people of all genders and identities to feel safe and welcome here. That doesn’t happen when the vibe starts getting creepy or lazy.

We’re not here to judge anyone. We’re just trying to make sure this place stays real. Thanks for getting it. Thanks for making this space what it is.

I’m planning on bringing my own things but I’m having a hard time figuring out how to make this space work for me. I wanted to go for a dark academia/hobbitcore vibe since the wood accents lean well to that. That darker space above the far wall is actually a shelf that extends into the kitchen. The AC unit on the left hand wall is pretty ugly and was wondering if I could cover it with a grate of some kind to allow airflow but have it be more aesthetically pleasing. I’m also planning on putting up some temporary wallpaper or 3D cobblestone panels but the wall with the window/AC would be hard to work around so I’m not sure what to do there. I have a display case that I was going to use as a TV stand and I was thinking about getting something for coats/shoes for the entryway like she has here.

And the boundaries involved?,"Been NC for over a decade, only broken when the narcissist died. I got in contact to help my baby brother sort out the estate (hoarders edition). I'm trying to build a relationship with my enabler mother. Well, I think I want to. It's either we figure out how to live with each other or I go NC again.

The more I'm in contact with my mother, the more I 1. Realise that my dad wasn't the only asshole and 2. She will never change.

My therapist gave me a few weeks to come up with conditions under which I'd be willing to coexist with my mother. It will obviously not be a mother daughter relationship, that ship has sailed, my therapist left the interpretation of the relationship open to me. She suggested a partnership, 50/50 equal shares no position of power.

But I'm STUMPED!

My mother never lifted her hand to me, screamed at me, dragged me out of bed in the middle of the night. She was abused with us, it was us against him growing up. But she enabled him severely, like helped him forge my signature on financial forms, told me I'm not her daughter anymore when he disowned me. 

She also has no boundaries. So I need to set boundaries, but I need to think of everything, because this woman's entitlement stuns me to silence. For example 
* Jokingly peeking into my guestroom and saying that if her pension doesn't work out she can always move in here. 
*Walking through my house and yard and always having opinions or negative while I'm in the bathroom or busy making coffee to the point where I need to keep rooms and cupboards locked when she's over.
* Taking photos of my house when my concentration laps for a second
* Throwing questions my way about our finances
* Complaining about her personal and her financial problems to me.

Now in all these cases I can grey rock. I can divert, ignore, even address it at the time. But it is tiresome to have to always go after the fact and say ""it's not okay to look inside my hallway cupboard"" when she makes a remark and I realise she peeked in there on the way to the bathroom.

She is acting like the whole NC didn't happen and is happily rejoycing in the renewal of our mother-daughter relationship while I'm filled with rage at innocent questions like ""I took a photo of this item in your house and showed it to my friend and she wants to know where you bought it"" a day after she left my house.

I've been NC and the thing is, it's easier to think you've healed when the problem was distanced, only to realise that a decade of NC and therapy means nothing when you haven't actually dealt with the issue. I could return to NC, but that rage inside of me is apparently not dying, so I need to deal with it before it consumes me.",2,1750953456.0,raisedbynarcissists,1,1.0,False

I changed up the end of the chapter alot of times but i think im happy with the final product. Almodt 1.9k words and over 10.5k characters.

Smile, Dear Zeiyan Chapter 1

""I didn’t ask to be chosen. I didn’t ask to be anything.
If the gods are real, then I wish they'd pick someone else.""

There was no light.
There was no sound.
There was no temperature, 
There was no gravity,
There was no air.

Only a Grey Fog.

And slowly, as if pulled from beneath a collapsing ocean, three words rose molding a thought:

Who am I?

Two words came next crafting the name. Wei Zeiyan. It didn’t echo. There was nothing to bounce off. No walls. No sky. Just his own thoughts, curling inwards.

Then another thought came, three words:
Where am I?

That one did not arrive with clarity, only weight.

He opened his eyes.

Or rather, he tried to. He wasn’t sure if they were closed. Sight had no meaning here. Darkness would have been a mercy. This was the absence of experience.

But he was not alone.

Something moved.

Not beside him. But around him.

A cold breath slithered behind his thoughts, winding around the core of his mind like a snake around it's prey.

A voice.

 > “Ah. You’re awake. Or as awake as something like you can be.""

> “Let’s see… two legs, weak spine, questionable emotional stability… ah yes. Human.”

Wei Zeiyan did not flinch. He couldn’t. His body did not exist in any way he understood.

> 'You can speak, you know. Or is this the part where you pretend this is all a dream and I’m a metaphor for your repressed childhood trauma?”

A beat of silence.

Then, slowly—deliberately—Wei Zeiyan shaped the thought into a question.

“What are you?”

> ""Fog.""

...

""Fog?"" 

 > “You may call me… The Grey Fog. No, not a grey fog. The Grey Fog. Capital letters. I have a brand to maintain.""

Silence.

Zeiyan floated, thought, tried to feel anything but pressure and weightlessness. He had no mouth, but if he’d had one, he might’ve cursed.

> “Hmm. You’re not screaming. That’s usually how this starts. Usually they scream. You’re either brave, or boring. I must’ve picked a boring one.”

“I don’t think I can.”

> “Ah. You’re taking this rather well. That’s… disappointing.”

Zeiyan didn’t respond. Not because he was calm. Because he was still processing—the way someone might stand perfectly still on the edge of a cliff because movement might tip the world.

“…What do you want from me?”

> “Everything. But let’s start small.”

""Start wha-?""

> “I need a vessel. You are... convenient.”

“I don’t want to be convenient.”

> “And yet, here we are.”


Something shifted.

Wei Zeiyan saw none of it. Yet he felt it. A sudden compression. A lurch. Then-

He fell.

The sensation dropped him like a stone. No wind. No direction. Just impact.

He hit a floor.

Hard.

Real. 

His hands slapped down first, and he felt it—stone. Or something like it.

He gasped. The breath hit his chest like a truck. He choked. Coughed.

Air. Real air.

And sound.

Pain lanced up his arms. Stone beneath his palms. Cold and oarse.

He breathed—air thick like mildew and ash.

His chest heaved. Limbs trembled. His muscles began to ache.

Then sight returned. Blurry and gray. Mist surrounding him. The edges of things softly twitching in and out of form. It was straight out of a dream. Or a memory.

He sat up, groaning. His vision swam.

And then—across the cracked, polished surface of the stone floor—he saw a reflection.

A face.

His face.

Pale. Hollowed. Eyes wide and slightly sunken, as if sleep hadn’t visited in years. Not the heroic kind. The kind you'd see on someone who'd been laid off and had given up on life. Hair disheveled—jet black, slightly overgrown, clinging to the sweat on his brow in limp strands. There were lines under his eyes that hadn’t been there before.

His lips were slightly chapped. Jaw narrow. Cheekbones sharp. He looked like someone who was constantly apologizing for existing.

He was still wearing the remnants of his old life—a wrinkled white button-up shirt, untucked and stained with sweat, its fabric clinging to his back like regret. The collar was crumpled. A pair of brown suspenders hung loosely over his shoulders, slightly askew, as if they’d been tugged in haste. They stretched over his chest in faded, tired lines, one strap slipping lower than the other. His black slacks were torn at the knee, smudged with mud and grime, and one shoe was missing. The other was scuffed, laces frayed. His office badge still clung to his belt loop on a cracked retractable cord, its photo faded and name half-scratched out.

> ""Oh, charming,"" the Fog hummed inside his skull, voice brimming with theatrical dismay. 

>“Look at you. Brown suspenders, slightly loose. White t-shirt, wrinkled and black trousers. The classic ‘nobody’ uniform. Like the personification of a side character nobody remembers. Office drone by day, invisible ghost by night.”


It chuckled low and long, like smoke curling through a throat.

> “You do realize no one here is going to know what an ‘office job’ is, right? They’ll probably assume you’re some kind of cursed butler. Or a very underpaid ghost.”


> “But don’t worry,” it added, tone shifting—soft, almost pitiful. “You won’t have to embarrass yourself much longer. Eventually, I’ll take the wheel. You can… rest. Watch. I’ll even keep your precious suspenders flapping in the wind if it makes you feel involved.”


> “You’re better as a passenger, anyway. Less chance of you doing something stupid—like growing a conscience

His body ached like he hadn’t moved in days. His mouth was dry. Limbs weak. Like something had chewed him up and spat him out.

Around him was The Grey Fog

Nothing but The Grey Fog

Then the voice returned. Closer now.

> “You’re awake. Good. That means we can start.”

Start what?”

> “The possession.”

“ What? No No I- You can do that!. I didn’t agree that!"" Zeiyan desperately tried to create more thoughts to protest but was interrupted by the Fog

> “Oh, I know.”

...

> “That’s why this part is going to hurt.”

The fog moved. Not towards him but plunging into his soul.

Wei Zeyan’s screams of agony didn’t make it out.

The Fog crashed into him like iron through glass. His vision shattered. His eardrums tore themselves apart. A high-pitched shriek morphed and imploded into silence.

A deafening, metallic crunch erupted inside his skull, and then—blackness.

And then, nothing.

Nothing in sight. Not even the sound of his own breath was there to keep him company.

And then—

> ""Still with me?""

The voice.

The only thing left.

Smirking inside the cage of his skull.

He didn’t answer. He couldn’t.

> “I’ve cut your strings. Your senses belong to me now. A little obedience gets you vision. A little loyalty gets you hearing. Maybe even taste, if you’re very, very polite.”

Inside his mind, something burned. Wei Zeyan wanted to scream, but no air came. His thoughts fractured. Rage mixed and then overcome by panic. He clawed at the walls of his own mind.

> “Strange little creature, You’re not much, but you fight. I like that. I prefer my vessels feisty. Makes the possession more fun and less boring.”

All this time Zeiyan had thought — Why? Why me?

> “Because you were the only one who looked lost enough to be found. Don’t flatter yourself.”



Time passed.

Or maybe it didn’t.

There was no way to measure. No sun. No moon. No day. No night.

And the Fog. Talking. Always talking.

It narrated its thoughts like an endless diary read aloud.

> “I had a host once. A man who thought he was a dog. Genuinely believed it. Collar and everything. Called himself Barkley. Not his real name. That was George.”

Wei Zeiyan didn’t react. Or maybe he did. The Fog didn’t care.

> “He barked at strangers. Rolled in dirt. Begged for affection. You humans call that a breakdown. I call it entertainment. He once bit a bus driver for refusing to let him board through the rear door. Got arrested. Got released. Got put on medication. I liked George. He was loyal. Loyal right up until he dug a hole in his backyard and buried himself in it.”

> “Oh, he didn’t die immediately. No, no.
He brought snacks. Blankets. He even scratched the inside of the box with his name: 'Here lies Barkley. Good boy.' Took him three days. Died wagging his imaginary tail.”

> “I laughed so hard I stopped existing in that dimension for a while. Would’ve kept him around longer, but he stopped responding. Shame. There was potential in that madness.”

Sometimes it sang.

Off-key. Inventing melodies. Entire songs, spontaneous and tone-deaf.

> Ohhh, Dear Zeiyan, cubicle king,
Filing those forms like it means something... Coffee breath, spine like jelly, Dreams all gone, waistline smelly! 

Wei Zeiyan screamed in silence.

> Lunch at noon, hope at five,
Staring blankly just to feel alive!
Clicks and spreadsheets, boss’s glare,
What’s that? Oh, it’s despair!” 

> Breakfast's just a plastic cup,
Lunchroom chats that never light up,
Office jokes that fall so flat,
Boss’s glare—imagine that! 

> Apartment small, window cracked,
Houseplants dying, leaves all black,
Dust in corners, stacks of mail,
Everything stale, spirits frail. 

> Internet history, don’t you know?
Browsing memes from long ago,
Late-night scrolling, lost in feeds,
Empty snacks and broken needs. 

> Sock drawer chaos, odd and worn,
Pairs that vanish, clothes forlorn,
One black sock, one striped and blue,
Matching’s a game you never knew. 

> Phone left silent, messages cold,
Mother’s voicemail, story told,
“Call me back, it’s just been a while,”
But your voice stuck inside this trial. 

> Dreams deferred, hopes deferred,
Your life’s a song that’s barely heard,
But here you are, trapped and confined,
A ghost of the man you left behind. 

""Please stop… please just let me be.” Zeiyang's pleas were met with another verse to his dismail

> Smile, dear Wei, your show’s begun,
No crowd to cheer, no rising sun,
Your misery’s a twisted tune.
That hums beneath the lifeless moon. 

Each lyric punctuated with unbearable cheer.

Wei Zeiyan stopped thinking.

He let his mind drift into a shapeless fog of non-reaction.

Until the singing stopped.

And then—

> “You think this is hell. But it’s not Human. It’s waiting. Which is worse. The only thing remotely going good for you is that nobody will even know your missing. No search parties. No worried calls from parents and friends.You are just a nobody”

Wei Zeiyan thought to himself: I’m more than that... right?

> “Ah, but that’s where you’re wrong. You are nobody. And that’s exactly why I chose you. Perfectly forgettable. Perfectly convenient.”

Convenient? What do you mean?

> “You’re my vessel now. My way to move between worlds. You’ll be stuck inside your own head, watching as I take control. But don’t worry—I’ll make the show entertaining. You’ll see things you never could before. From the passenger seat.”

Trapped… in my own mind?

The Fog paused.

> “Exactly. You’re the background character in my story now. Just try not to lose yourself completely. It’s going to be quite the journey.”

The Grey fog, this time, had an enthusiastic tone which made Wei Zeiyan grimace even more.

I’m looking for some chill, understanding people to game with, or just hang out and chat. I enjoy watching streams, having laid-back conversations, or just vibing in a relaxed space. Bonus points if you have pets to show off!

A little about me:
I deal with anxiety and selective mutism, so I might be quiet at first, especially around new people. It just takes me a little time to warm up! I really appreciate kindness, patience, and a welcoming vibe.
Whether we’re gaming, chatting, or enjoying some music or movies together, I’m all about keeping things low-key and fun.

I’m a bit of a coffee addict and love nature, animals, art, and music. When it comes to games, I enjoy both cozy and spooky ones - just no shooters, I’m hilariously bad at aiming! ^^'

Some of my current favorite games:
- 7 Days to Die
- Demonologist
- Phasmophobia

I also have access to a shared library, so I’m open to trying new games (as long as my PC can handle them, I don't have the best parts hahah).

There’s this guy who used to be just a casual college friend. We weren’t close back then but after six years, we reconnected because we both live in the same city now. We met up with his group of friends who are genuinely lovely and they even celebrated my birthday with me. We had drinks, stayed over at his place in a group setting and slowly started hanging out more.

Over the next few weeks we’d go out, sometimes just the two of us but mostly with his group. There were sleepovers involved and I’d usually crash on the couch or share a bed with him. It actually made me admire him more because he was always kind, funny and respectful.

One time though, I got super drunk and accidentally puked all over his bed and him. He didn’t make a big deal of it, just cleaned up, made me coffee and was incredibly calm. That moment, weirdly, made me start liking him more.

Then came the night. We were both mostly sober and I ended up sleeping beside him. He put his arm out, I rested on it and then he pulled me closer and kissed my neck. I liked it but I wasn’t sure what to do, so I got up, used the washroom and came back. We cuddled the whole night but when he leaned in for a kiss, I shook my head no. He didn’t push it and we just cuddled till morning.

After that, things kind of went back to normal. No mention of what happened. I still saw him and his friends regularly, still slept next to him a few times but he never made another move. I once rested my hand on him during sleep but he didn’t react or reciprocate.

Eventually he went on a vacation for a few months. We kept in touch via memes and I stayed close with his friends. But ever since that night, I keep replaying everything in my head. I’m honestly starting to feel something deeper, like I have a lowkey crush or more, but I don’t think he feels the same.

He’s not the type who talks about dating or love and I’m scared of bringing this up because I really don’t want to ruin the friendship or make it awkward with the group.

Now that he’s back, we’re hanging out even more — group hikes, dinners, the usual. He still invites me to everything and includes me in plans. But we don’t sleep in the same room anymore and when we meet I get only friend vibes from him.

So I’m torn.
I still feel something for him.
I don’t think he feels anything back.
But I can’t seem to get out of this loop in my head.

I’m currently a student going into my fourth year of an Interaction Design degree from a well-respected program here in Canada. I have one internship at a start up under my belt and some freelance experience. 

Over the past few months, I managed to land several big-tech interviews (IBM, Intuit, etc) and even got to the final round of interviews but didn’t land any of them unfortunately. I took advantage of this, however, and connected with the designers there to get feedback on my portfolio and my performance during the interviews. 

Some of these designers have since given my guidance, so i’ve re-done my portfolio & resume since and i’m generally getting good feedback now. Some of them have even given me referrals to positions their companies have posted recently, I haven’t heard anything back however. 

As of now, i’m networking by asking experienced designers for coffee chats and i’m generally seeing good results as I’m getting solid feedback in-terms of my portfolio and career direction.

 **Here’s my dilemma:**

Since i’m going into my fourth year, I won’t be able to score another internship if I don’t secure one for this fall as most of them require you to be a returning student. 

I feel lost because i’m not really hearing back anymore despite the fact that my portfolio and resume are objectively better. I’m worried and genuinely have no idea what more I can do to break into the field, does anyone have any advice for someone trying to break in such as myself? Most of them have told me they landed most of their jobs via connections and not applications, yet i’m no longer hearing back despite the referrals

Short Devotional about Generosity

Introduction
------------

Generosity is a beautiful gift that has the power to transform lives—both ours and those around us. When we open our hearts and hands to give, we invite joy and love into our communities. The beauty of generosity lies not only in what is given but in the spirit in which it is shared. Today, we explore how generosity can enrich our lives and draw us closer to others and to God.

Imagine a world where generosity is a daily practice. It’s a world filled with kind actions, heartfelt gifts, and people who lift each other up in times of need. As we delve into this devotional, let’s open ourselves to the possibilities of living generously, allowing it to guide us into deeper connections and abundant blessings.

“Give, and it will be given to you. A good measure, pressed down, shaken together and running over, will be poured into your lap. For with the measure you use, it will be measured to you.” — Luke 6:38 (NIV)

Meaning
-------

Luke 6:38 reminds us of the profound principle that generosity begets generosity. When we give freely and without expectation, we set into motion a cycle of blessings. The verse encourages us to give generously—not out of obligation, but from a genuine desire to bless others.

The imagery of a “good measure, pressed down, shaken together, and running over” paints a vivid picture of abundance. It signifies that our acts of generosity will return to us multiplied, overflowing with blessings beyond what we initially offered. This isn’t just about material rewards; it’s about the joy, love, and fulfillment that enrich our lives.

Generosity is more than a transaction; it is an expression of love and faith. It reflects God’s grace, teaching us to trust in His provision and to carry His love into the world. As we practice generosity, we reflect the heart of Jesus and become His hands and feet here on earth.

The promise that “with the measure you use, it will be measured to you” reassures us that we will never lack when we give with a sincere heart. God sees our kindness and rewards it in ways beyond our imagination, reminding us that the true essence of giving is rooted in faith and love.

Actions to Take
---------------

– Identify someone in need and find a way to support them, whether through time, resources, or a simple act of kindness.

– Set aside a specific amount of money each month to give to a cause you are passionate about or to help someone in need.

– Volunteer your time at a local charity or community event, contributing your skills and energy to make a difference.

– Practice gratitude by writing down three things you are thankful for each day and consider ways to share your blessings with others.

– Make a habit of giving compliments and encouraging words, lifting the spirits of those you encounter daily.

Journal Prompts
---------------

– Reflect on a time when someone’s generosity impacted your life. How did it feel, and what did it teach you?

– What fears or hesitations do you have about giving more freely? How can you overcome them?

– How can practicing generosity bring you closer to God and His intentions for your life?

– Write about a situation where you gave freely without expectation. How did it change you or the recipient?

– Imagine your life filled with abundant generosity. What does it look like, and how does it make you feel?

Prayer
------

Dear Lord, thank You for the countless blessings You have poured into my life. Help me to give generously and joyfully, just as You have given to me. Teach me to open my heart and hands without hesitation, trusting in Your abundant provision. May my acts of kindness reflect Your love and grace, inspiring others to live generously too. Amen.

Q&amp;A about Generosity
------------------------

Certainly! Here’s a Q&amp;A based on the theme of generosity:

### Question

### Answer

Practicing generosity doesn’t always require grand gestures or large financial contributions. Here are some simple ways to incorporate generosity into your daily life:

1. **Listening Actively**: Truly listen to others without interrupting. Giving your time and attention can be profoundly generous.
2. **Offering Kind Words**: Compliment someone genuinely. A kind word can brighten someone’s day.
3. **Helping with Small Tasks**: Offer to help a colleague with a task or a neighbor with their groceries.
4. **Sharing Knowledge**: Teach someone a skill or share knowledge without expecting anything in return.
5. **Donating Items**: Give away clothes, books, or furniture you no longer need to those who could use them.
6. **Volunteering**: Give your time to a local charity or community group.
7. **Expressing Gratitude**: Show appreciation to those around you, reinforcing a culture of generosity and kindness.
8. **Random Acts of Kindness**: Pay for the coffee of the person behind you in line, or leave a kind note for someone to find.

Generosity is about giving what you can—be it time, resources, or kindness—and fostering positive interactions with those around you.

My role is in Sales and Marketing within this space, so naturally, building relationships is a big part of my job. The industry is male-dominated, so I naturally have more male connections than female.

My boyfriend (29M) works in the same industry as I do, as a content creator. I say all this to help set the scene.

At my last job, I met one of my very good friends—we’ll call him Bob (34M). He was a Sales Director who really took me under his wing and taught me a lot about the space. I owe him multiple career recommendations, interviews, and connections. We’re good friends, and also have a strong business relationship.

When we first met, Bob once asked me to go out with him one-on-one to a bar, which I politely declined, mentioning I had a boyfriend. He picked up on that and didn’t bring it up again. The only other moment that felt too friendly or slightly flirty was when he patted my thigh under the table after a joke. I found that strange and immediately created some physical distance. I chalked it up to a one-time, possibly accidental thing.

Both of those situations happened over a year ago. Since then, Bob has met my boyfriend, and we've all become acquaintances. Bob and I still grab coffee one-on-one occasionally, mostly to talk about work and mentorship, but even those have tapered off. I’ve been trying to create a bit more distance between us, especially because my boyfriend doesn’t like the friendship.

However, my boyfriend and I got into an argument about Bob—on my birthday, no less. While my boyfriend isn’t usually jealous, he is specifically jealous of Bob. I’ve told him that I thought Bob might have liked me *at one point*, but after meeting him and seeing us together, I felt that changed. I now see the friendship as entirely platonic.

The argument stemmed from my boyfriend finding a selfie of Bob and me on a film camera at a party. The photo wasn’t inappropriate in pose or context at all, but he got very upset and accused me of not having clear enough boundaries. He also told his guy friends about the situation, which hurt me—it felt like he was spreading drama and rumors that weren’t true.

I’ve told my boyfriend repeatedly that I’m not attracted to Bob in any way, and from a business perspective, it would actually be damaging to cut him off entirely over assumptions, especially since we all work in the same industry. That said, at this point, I’m willing to stop being friends with Bob if it would make my boyfriend feel more secure. I care about my boyfriend more.

I would love to hear people’s thoughts—is there some validity to my boyfriend’s feelings and mine? Again, the ""asking me out"" and ""physical touch"" moments happened over a year ago. I don’t consider them relevant anymore. These days, my interactions with Bob are limited to group settings or the occasional work-related text.

Despite that, my boyfriend continues to view a lot of my interactions with Bob as inappropriate or disloyal. He says I’m embarrassing him by being “too friendly.” It feels like no matter what I do, I lose.

TLDR: Is my 29M Bf being jealous of my 34M mentor/guy friend for liking me or is this being blown out of proportion? I 25F have a platonic relationship with my guy friend, but my bf thinks he has bad intentions I can't see.",1,1750952722.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

I used to come for coffee and to buy an occasional treat, as their prices are a bit astronomical. 

However, my perspective has GREATLY changed since working there. I applied for the job as the employees seemed to genuinely enjoy their work, and it felt like a community. This could literally not be any further from the truth. 

They put their employees out in the full sun (95+ degrees) and refuse to let them sit down or take breaks. They say you can, but it’s frowned upon when you actually try to take said break. Like, is the break policy in the room with us? Because every time I’ve tried, I’ve been called lazy/ “a slacker”, and my coworkers are tasked with doing even more work since they are allergic to proper staffing. The scheduling is absolutely ridiculous as well, as they completely ignore time off requests and availability changes. Every single employee I’ve spoken to absolutely hates it there and cannot wait to quit. The employees are good people, and it makes me sick to my stomach to see how they are treated.

The customers are a whole other can of worms. They are entitled, condescending, and just straight up disgusting excuses for human beings that love to see how awful they can treat employees without consequences. Spoiler alert: management will allow, and honestly, encourage this. 

I have worked in the service industry for a long time. I have never worked somewhere with such poor organization and management, as well as complete indifference towards the wellbeing of their employees. When this business fails- because it undoubtedly will- I look forward to seeing the headline. It should go without saying, but please avoid supporting this business. Not only are the prices laughable (check the price on Heinz ketchup), but it’s against everything a decent person should stand for. It’s a playground for the privileged to feed their egos.

Me [24F and he 34M ],"There’s this guy who used to be just a casual college friend. We weren’t close back then but after six years, we reconnected because we both live in the same city now. We met up with his group of friends who are genuinely lovely and they even celebrated my birthday with me. We had drinks, stayed over at his place in a group setting and slowly started hanging out more.

Over the next few weeks we’d go out, sometimes just the two of us but mostly with his group. There were sleepovers involved and I’d usually crash on the couch or share a bed with him. It actually made me admire him more because he was always kind, funny and respectful.

One time though, I got super drunk and accidentally puked all over his bed and him. He didn’t make a big deal of it, just cleaned up, made me coffee and was incredibly calm. That moment, weirdly, made me start liking him more.

Then came the night. We were both mostly sober and I ended up sleeping beside him. He put his arm out, I rested on it and then he pulled me closer and kissed my neck. I liked it but I wasn’t sure what to do, so I got up, used the washroom and came back. We cuddled the whole night but when he leaned in for a kiss, I shook my head no. He didn’t push it and we just cuddled till morning.

After that, things kind of went back to normal. No mention of what happened. I still saw him and his friends regularly, still slept next to him a few times but he never made another move. I once rested my hand on him during sleep but he didn’t react or reciprocate.

Eventually he went on a vacation for a few months. We kept in touch via memes and I stayed close with his friends. But ever since that night, I keep replaying everything in my head. I’m honestly starting to feel something deeper, like I have a lowkey crush or more, but I don’t think he feels the same.

He’s not the type who talks about dating or love and I’m scared of bringing this up because I really don’t want to ruin the friendship or make it awkward with the group.

Now that he’s back after 4 months, we’re hanging out even more group hikes, dinners, the usual. He still invites me to everything and includes me in plans. But we don’t sleep in the same room anymore and when we meet I get only friend vibes from him.

So I’m torn. I still feel something for him. I don’t think he feels anything back. But I can’t seem to get out of this loop in my head.

Shooting a bit long but anyone at or around central want to meet? Wander around or get coffee? 

I know meeting strangers is 50/50 but I’ll explain the dumb thought that preceded this idea…

I feel as though, as much as I’ve got good friends and all, it’s like we grew up on opposing worlds. We’re from different places and occupy divergently differing worlds. For all our likes and commonalities, our fear is different, our pain is different, our worst and best moments, our concepts and common reference points all differ not by gradation but by extremity of degree.

It’s just I’m tired of noticing that lack of sameness, that slight of-kilter disharmony that underwrites every conversation, that’s so ever-present somewhere in my periphery as we talk, and as we laugh, and as we not our heads and we agree 

I guess I just want normal. Normal conversation - with normal people - who scan and read as normal. And normal being relative and all, my normal is traumatised. My normal is hurt, is struggling and fighting to survive, is different from normal.

So that’s how I came up with the idea.

I’m 24 btw, feel like a hundred and four on the inside mind, but still.

No commitment or anything, I’m just bored and my ADHD likes novelty and talking so feel free to DM me if u like :)

Secondly we believe in reestablishing humanities relationship with technology. This is not a secret. The goal of our movement is to model a new humanity. A humanity where technology does not run our lives but serves humanity while allowing us to be exactly what we are – a biological species. Reversing the centuries-old progress made by technology-infused evolution will take time, but on a distant planet, out of the watchful eye of other more pervasive authorities, time will be abundant.'""

She mumbled, “Time will be abundant…what shit. Bunch of fucking ExtraNet bullshit.” Erah flipped to page 4 – OPINIONS. 

CAN A.I. GO ROGUE? 
"" Despite the movies of yore, the numerous historical science fiction classics with not-so-subtle warnings of conscious artificial intelligences capable of true agency, the United Worlds Artificial Systems researchers have been unable to find any reason to be afraid of A.I. Artificial Intelligence today is embedded in our humanity. A.I. is in our homes, our cars, our ships, and some are experimenting with building artificially intelligent planets. Yet, there has not been one-recorded instance of A.I. “waking up” to their existence and developing self-awareness. If an A.I. has appeared to have self-awareness, it has been programmed to appear that way. Self-Awareness was given to the system like God has given man life. Our life is not ours, and A.I. self-awareness is programmed.""

Erah checked the author of the opinion piece. It was written by a spokesperson for the United Worlds Artificial Systems. She feigned shock mouthing, “What a surprise.” Raising her eyebrows sardonically.  

Her pour-over coffee maker beeped letting her know that the final pour was finished. Opening a nearby cabinet, she grabbed her favorite mug. It was red. Her mother gave it to her as a Christmas present years ago. Its handle was chipped and after years of daily use a permanent coffee-stained ring had developed on the inside. She poured her coffee, took a sip, and sighed as she flipped the newspaper back to the front page.  

Back in the bedroom, she got dressed for work, finished her coffee, and put on her badge. “United Worlds Artificial Intelligence Systems – Badge #0508750 – Erah Rasmussun”. She walked back to the kitchen, lights dimming on and off, pour some more coffee into a traveler mug, grabbed her keys and purse and walked out the front door. While locking the door, she noticed she left her rings on. “Shit.”  

She opened back up the front door, leaving it open she walked quickly to the bedroom and took off her rings. Reminding the apartment A.I. to set an alarm for tomorrow morning at 2am, she jogged back to the front door, still open. Erah locked the door behind her, consciously checking her hands for any more jewelry, and went to work.  

Inside the apartment, lights dimmed, cabinets closed, and the bed made itself. As Erah got in her car she could faintly here the overture of Richard Wagner’s “Tannhauser” coming from within the walls of her apartment. She smirked as she closed her car door. ",1,1750952128.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False
1ll38gq,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1ll38gq/my_35f_partner_39m_and_i_have_been_together_for/,"My (35F) partner (39M) and I have been together for almost 2.5 years and there have been some minor issues off and on, but overall great. I had an abortion almost a month ago and he's been very insensitive, cold, and then broke up with me last night but now wants to ""walk it back""... what do I do?","We've been inseparable since we met, both divorced, and knew we were each other's person since the beginning. We moved in together like 9 months in, and have been on many trips and everything has been great. The issues that have come up is around a year in he did start ""buckling down"" I guess, and got a little bit pickier about things I was doing around the house and said I wasn't thoughtful enough. I'd ask for suggestions but he didn't have any, and also said if he could think of anything asking defeats the purpose. As an example, I did start making coffee for him at night for the next day to be nice, and after a period of time I I forgot a couple days in a row, and it became a conversation how it caused an issue for him about trusting or depending on me.

  
He does much of the cooking and walking dogs, vast majority, I can offer to walk the dogs instead of him and he declines so he does like doing it, and I have tried to be better about cooking a few times a month but he enjoys it so again declines me doing it more often. There's a pattern of offering help, he declines, then frustrated I don't help more.

We're both childfree by choice and don't want kids. When I fell pregnant (I'm on the pill and take it as directed) he was supportive and I proceeded with getting an abortion. However - he doesn't seem to understand its impact on me and struggles with empathy. There's several examples in other posts of mine, but the first issue was the night before my appointment I asked him how he was feeling and he said neutral, which kinda hurt my feelings because I was going through it, it turned into a big thing that apparently he thought I meant how he felt that second, not in general (which is what I meant) and although I kept trying to clarify things, he didn't seem to hear/understand and kept being convinced I was telling him he should feel sad at that second, ended up getting mad at me and said I was acting like his (abusive) dad, playing a pity party, went downstairs and slept there. I struggle with depression and used to self harm, and did that night (scratched myself). I know I'm pursuing therapy again it's not great.

  
He didn't apologize the next day (apparently because he was still convinced that I was demanding he feel sad, although he admits he overstepped and shouldn't have gotten that mad. This kept happening... he would hurt me, not understand why I was upset and would get frustrated with me because he stands behind his words. My depression and suicidal thoughts got a lot worse, he's been my rock for years and this chaos is breaking me, and he twinged his back the next day. I did my best to see if he's ok, I was worried about it, I offered to help, he declined several times. Later he went to take the trash out and got mad I didn't offer to help. Went off how unloved he felt, how he's been depressed too and has still been doing nice things for me and was super mean. 

  
The next day I was colder towards him and not super warm when he offered more backrubs. No apology from him from being mean and saying really hurtful things and saying he wanted to break up with me if I couldn't show him care he needs. He said he was open to couples counseling, but I guess since I was cold towards him, he came to me at the end of the day and broke up with me, saying we're incompatible and that he realized he only wanted to do therapy so he'd feel he did everything he could, not because he thought it'd work. I went on a long drive and cut myself (yes I'm pursuing therapy now I don't handle breakups/relationship disorder well and haven't self harmed in years before this month Lexapro is a god-send). I was gone for several hours calming down and he freaked out and tried to walk back his breakup saying he knows he needs to work on empathy and is sorry for everything. 

  
What would you do? I am a little tempted to take him back and do therapy and give it a try to see what happens. The other part of me sees patterns and he clearly hasn't felt that I can meet his expectations for longer than this month and I don't know if I can forgive someone acting so cruel to me at my lowest when I'm truly trying my best, it's like I'm not allowed to feel distant because of his actions. There were sooo many good things and he is usually such a good listener, very thoughtful, but does get cold and stubborn when we disagree and I'm just hurting and confused. Sorry for the long post I just have to get this out. ",1,1750952114.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

I have been dating this woman for 6 months, we have a good relationship with lots of communication. I have been open about my desire to marry her, have kids with her, etc. and we have spoken about the future and started to make plans. Having said that, I have led the way in terms of emotional commitment and vulnerability and she does tend to ground us, which has the ""pump the brakes"" effect, which I don't love, but I do understand. For instance, when talking about moving in, I am excited because I want to see her more and spend more time and she says things like ""we have to see if it works, we don't know if we will hate each other yet"". Again, don't love it, but I get it, she has kind of a jaded life history as it relates to men.

She recently met a man on the train who is a retired accountant and older (I think 60's/70's), and they traded numbers because they live in the same town. Originally it was ""maybe we will all hang out"" referring to the group on the train and then it was ""I am going to coffee with John"". Then last night they went to dinner just the two of them, and made plans to go get wine in a few weeks at a winery.

I don't consider myself a jealous man, but I do feel some type of way. Without guiding anyone, I would like to know people's thoughts on this.

1ll33w9,https://www.reddit.com/r/ATERstock/comments/1ll33w9/important_ater_shareholders_vote/,IMPORTANT! ATER Shareholders - Vote!,"Some very important votes are about to come up at the Aterian annual shareholders meeting, scheduled for August 12 2025. 

If you keep up to date with the posts here, you'll have read some of the dissatisfaction with the board and the equity incentive plans that are currently authorized. 

Well, it seems to their credit on this, that they have also been reading/listening, as they have put up the executive officers compensation plan for a vote at the annual shareholders meeting.

If you don't agree with the compensation the executive officers are receiving, this is your chance to make your voice heard!

Note though, that it is a ""non-binding, advisory"" vote, so if enough people vote AGAINST the compensation, it doesn't mean that the board will be obliged to change the compensation packages, but it will certainly send a very strong and clear message that shareholders are unhappy with them and will put pressure on them to review them. 

https://preview.redd.it/shnia5olc99f1.png?width=1478&format=png&auto=webp&s=b05c5d26b260d8c44f21c55f3040757172193e72

Here is *my opinion* on the voting and how I will be choosing to use my shares to vote.



**1.)** To elect Arturo Rodriguez as a Class III director - I will be voting **FOR**

It's quite obvious really, we need our CEO on the board, he knows the company better than anyone else and is in the best position to help the board make informed decisions. I'm a big backer of Arty, I think he's a real asset to the company. I can see and hear his passion for the company and I like to believe he does have the best interest of us retail shareholders at heart. He's dedicated, hard-working and decisive without sacrificing that human element. I won't sit and list all the positive things he's done for the company since taking over, but there are A LOT! 



**2.)** To approve, on a non-binding advisory basis, the compensation of our named executive officers - I will be voting **AGAINST**

At Q1 2025 our shares outstanding was reported as being 8,748,741. Since then, the annual stock compensation and bounses have been awarded to the executive officers, our shares outstanding reported with the accompanying filing for this vote (link at bottom) is now reported as being 9,931,860, that's an increase of 1,183,119 shares, or just over 13.5%!! This, in my opinion, is eye wateringly extortionate. 

I've already made it clear I'm an avid supporter of Arty, so the following isn't any sort of attack on him directly, I'm using him as an example just because it's easier to find figures for average CEO salaries and compensation. (If anything, this is a mark against the board's compensation comittee and those who have granted and approved such awards.)

Arty's base salary in 2024 was $342,916, now you can take it with a pinch of salt or dig for further info if you wish but from google researching this seems to be pretty much in-line for a public micro-cap company

https://preview.redd.it/4f7iyuxyu99f1.png?width=1288&format=png&auto=webp&s=1a5d05ceda11fbdcdbb24081ced16968b873313f

Of course, when you factor in ATER has been trading with a market cap under $15mil, revenue has been falling, we are unprofitable and this is Arty's first role as a CEO, then it is still a very healthy sum.  
  
But the base salary isn't what I have issue with personally, it's the stock awards that I believe are way out of wack. Again, if anyone would like to research further and correct this, please do, but my own findings are as follows

https://preview.redd.it/offts1tpw99f1.png?width=1294&format=png&auto=webp&s=afecb47935bb6a2bcd9c03f8b994ed70e9b1cba2

So even if we were to take the top end of that range at 6.4% of total outstanding shares, we are offering OVER DOUBLE that amount in share awards to our execs (over 13.5%)!!

I get the boards message of ""retaining talent"" and ""aligning the goals of executives with shareholders"" by awarding share compensation, but come on, let's have a reality check here from the board shall we. How can 13.5% dilution in share awards be justified every year? There's a serious disconnect between the level the company is currently at and the level of these awards and it's about time the board/compensation committe woke up and smelt the coffee, this isn't 2021 anymore. It's of my opinion that the current ""2018 equity incentive plan"" is outdated and needs reform to reflect the current position of the company.  
  
We're now a tiny micro-cap company, we've seen the lowest market cap in company history since going public, lowest revenue we've ever seen, lowest share price we've ever seen (we're at \~$0.13 pre split level for goodness sake!) and yet us long, long suffering, loyal (and many struggling because of how things have gone with Aterian) retail shareholders who continue to keep purchasing shares and supporting the company whenever possible are supposed to sit back and be happy with this level of compensation and dilution? Did the committee forget we had a 12-1 reverse split? Because the amount of our shares they are giving away here makes it seem like they did. 

What are they basing these stock awards on? Are they just making up arbitrary numbers of shares to award whenever they feel like it? Well... the terrifying answer seems to be, yes. 

[Maybe they should make one?](https://preview.redd.it/oa56tijw3a9f1.png?width=1290&format=png&auto=webp&s=f3f963b24c864a7cc81d99291e23c04c04bdbd28)

  
**3.)**   To approve, on a non-binding advisory basis, the frequency of future advisory votes on the compensation of our named executive officers - I will be voting **1 YEAR**

This is the one that angers me more than anything else, the board is supposed to act on our behalf and in our best interests, yet here they are recommending us to VOTE AWAY OUR VOICE FOR 3 YEARS! 

How dare they! 

This ties back into vote #2. Yes, I am currently AGAINST the current compensation of our named executive officers, but next year, if they successfully show us they can turn Aterian around and we aren't trading at ALL TIME LOW share prices, I may change my opinion and be happy to vote my hard earned shares towards an increase in exec compensation, and I'm sure a majority of others would feel the same way.

This is a fast moving business, things can change in an instant, we've already seen that, every 3 years for a voice on this is too long. 

It appears from their recommendation that they don't want us meddling with their policies, awards and bonuses and would rather keep us quite, but after the boards ""expert guidance"" has sucessfully driven us from \~$40 to a \~$0.13 pre-split share price, I think some influence and meddling from us is more than overdue.



**4.)**  To ratify the appointment of UHY LLP as the accounting firm **-** I will be voting **FOR**



In saying all this, it's still important that you make your own choices at this vote, to make an informed decision, I recommend reading the accompanying filing that contains all the facts and figures relating to the issues being voted on here: [https://ir.aterian.io/node/10656/html](https://ir.aterian.io/node/10656/html) 

The filing also clarify's things relating to other recent hot topics, namely the consulting fee for former Co-CEO Joe Risco and even a walkthrough of how we could go about submitting a board candidate for an election vote at the 2026 Annual Shareholders Meeting (but let's leave that for another post on another day!) 

For now, keep an eye on your mail, email, spam folder and broker accounts, because details on how you can make your votes should be on their way to you fairly soon!

1ll2zsg,https://www.reddit.com/r/NordLayer_official/comments/1ll2zsg/firewall_for_small_business_what_actually_matters/,Firewall for small business: what actually matters and why,"I’ve noticed something working with small businesses: cybersecurity often lands at the bottom of the to-do list, usually after “figure out why the Wi-Fi keeps dropping”. I get it; it's never urgent until suddenly, it really is. 

A solid firewall isn't just about blocking hackers; it's about keeping your business running smoothly and quietly in the background.

## Why small businesses genuinely need firewalls (even if you think you’re too small)

Most small business owners I’ve met believe cybercriminals target the big guys first. 

The truth is, cybercriminals prefer easy targets. And small businesses, with limited security, look like low-hanging fruit. 

A reliable firewall helps transform a business from an open door into a secure fortress, one that criminals typically bypass.

* **Remote and hybrid working realities:** Your employees probably love working from cafes, homes, or co-working spaces. Hackers love public Wi-Fi too. A firewall, especially one paired with built-in VPN or zero-trust tool, ensures your people can work safely from anywhere.  
* **Handling sensitive data (the compliance headache):** Whether it’s customer payments, health records, or just plain-old personal information, auditors love to ask tough questions about security. A firewall can proactively handle many compliance checkboxes (PCI-DSS, HIPAA, GDPR).  
* **Dealing with your tech chaos:** Cloud apps, ancient printers, a random server tucked in the corner, or everyone's random laptops. A firewall acts like the one steady adult in the room, keeping your mishmash of devices safe under one reliable umbrella.

## Picking a firewall provider: it's about relationships

I've seen too many businesses rush into firewall decisions based purely on flashy marketing or overly technical specifications they barely understand. The best providers are the ones who treat you as a partner, not just another sale.

* **Easy deployment:** If setting up your firewall feels like solving a Rubik’s cube blindfolded, something’s gone very wrong. It should be quick, painless, and straightforward, ideally something you could almost handle yourself over lunch.  
* **Room to scale:** Small business is about growth. The last thing you need is a firewall that forces you into expensive upgrades every time you hire a new employee or open another office. Choose a provider who understands growth doesn’t mean ripping everything out and starting over.  
* **Remote access built in:** Employees traveling or working remotely shouldn't be forced to rely on sketchy hotel Wi-Fi. A firewall solution should offer secure remote access via integrated VPNs or zero-trust methods.  
* **Real-time threat detection:** Hackers don’t take weekends off or operate on your 9-to-5 schedule. You need threat detection that actively monitors your network, blocking attacks as they happen.  
* **Transparent reporting:** Clear, understandable reports and alerts are essential.   
* **Responsive support:** Choose a firewall provider with real humans on call at odd hours.

## How to practically choose the right firewall for your small business

One of the biggest mistakes small business owners make is following generic advice meant for companies three times their size. Here's what actually matters in your reality:

* **Match your size and setup:** A coffee shop with a single Wi-Fi network has vastly different firewall needs compared to a remote digital marketing agency juggling multiple locations. Clearly define your real-world scenario and choose accordingly.  
* **Managed vs. DIY:** Be honest: do you genuinely have the time and energy to handle updates, monitoring, and troubleshooting? If not, paying a Managed Service Provider (MSP) is money well spent. If you love being hands-on, find a firewall that's easy to self-manage.  
* **Real intrusion detection (not just firewall basics):** Firewalls that merely block ports and call it a day aren’t enough. Effective security today requires active monitoring for unusual network behavior, like unexpected traffic spikes at 3 am.  
* **Remote access that fits your workflow:** If your team hates overly complex security tools, pick VPN or zero-trust solutions that blend seamlessly into daily work, not cumbersome setups they'll constantly avoid.  
* **Growth-friendly licensing:** Avoid firewall providers who punish growth by forcing expensive upgrades for every new hire. Flexible licensing that scales up or down easily is your friend.

**TL;DR:**

* **Small biz \= easy target**  
* **Firewalls \= essentials:** Protect remote work, simplify compliance, organize messy tech  
* **Pick a partner:** Easy setup, scalable licensing, clear reports, human support  
* **Real security:** Built-in VPN or zero trust, real-time threat detection  
* **Match your needs:** DIY or managed services, intrusion detection, compliance-ready  
* **Benefit:** Less stress, fewer emergencies, more business focus",1,1750951537.0,NordLayer_official,0,1.0,False

Haven't worked there since, but have been a pretty much life-long customer.

I completely understand the annoyance of the secret menu/meme drink/instagramification of the Starbucks menu, and I get why price increases are there to reign in what's been going on. 

And I understand that I am part of a laughably small minority who actually drinks coffee at Starbucks, which of course is on me, since Starbucks has not cared about coffee in a meaningful way in 20 years. 

Tastes change. I get it.

I used to order cold brew, but once it stopped being made in the toddy's in house it's honestly some of the worst coldbrew available at big stores, so I switched to iced coffee.

Today in a midwestern suburb, my Venti iced coffee required an upcharge to switch to vanilla from classic. And the total was $5.45. 

This is, frankly, absurd. No one is ever going to care about this, but this is enshittification at its finest. It is capitalistic entropy. It is what makes me think of Starbucks as a last resort, and not meaningful ritual that makes my day better.",1,1750951515.0,starbucks,2,0.56,False

We weren’t close back then but after six years, we reconnected because we both live in the same city now. We met up with his group of friends who are genuinely lovely and they even celebrated my birthday with me. We had drinks, stayed over at his place in a group setting and slowly started hanging out more.

Over the next few weeks we’d go out, sometimes just the two of us but mostly with his group. There were sleepovers involved and I’d usually crash on the couch or share a bed with him. It actually made me admire him more because he was always kind, funny and respectful.

One time though, I got super drunk and accidentally puked all over his bed and him. He didn’t make a big deal of it, just cleaned up, made me coffee and was incredibly calm. That moment, weirdly, made me start liking him more.

Then came the night. We were both mostly sober and I ended up sleeping beside him. He put his arm out, I rested on it and then he pulled me closer and kissed my neck. I liked it but I wasn’t sure what to do, so I got up, used the washroom and came back. We cuddled the whole night but when he leaned in for a kiss, I shook my head no. He didn’t push it and we just cuddled till morning.

After that, things kind of went back to normal. No mention of what happened. I still saw him and his friends regularly, still slept next to him a few times but he never made another move. I once rested my hand on him during sleep but he didn’t react or reciprocate.

Eventually he went on a vacation for a few months. We kept in touch via memes and I stayed close with his friends. But ever since that night, I keep replaying everything in my head. I’m honestly starting to feel something deeper, like I have a lowkey crush or more, but I don’t think he feels the same.

He’s not the type who talks about dating or love and I’m scared of bringing this up because I really don’t want to ruin the friendship or make it awkward with the group.

Now that he’s back, we’re hanging out even more — group hikes, dinners, the usual. He still invites me to everything and includes me in plans. But we don’t sleep in the same room anymore and when we meet I get only friend vibes from him.

So I’m torn.
I still feel something for him.
I don’t think he feels anything back.

I don’t know about you, but as soon as the mornings turn crisp, I crave my kitchen to smell like apples, cinnamon, and freshly baked bread. Over the past few years, I’ve played around with a few variations and finally perfected this one. It’s incredibly moist, spiced just right, and stays soft for days.

Here’s my go-to recipe:

**Ingredients**

* 2 cups all-purpose flour
* 1 teaspoon baking soda
* ½ teaspoon salt
* 2 teaspoons cinnamon
* ¼ teaspoon nutmeg
* 2 large eggs, room temperature
* ½ cup vegetable oil (or melted butter)
* ½ cup brown sugar
* ¼ cup white sugar
* 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
* 2 cups grated apple (about 2 medium apples, I like Honeycrisp or Fuji)
* ½ cup chopped walnuts (optional)

**Instructions**

1. Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan.
2. In one bowl, whisk together flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg.
3. In another bowl, whisk eggs, oil, sugars, and vanilla until smooth. Fold in grated apples.
4. Gently stir dry ingredients into wet ingredients. Don’t overmix, just until combined. Fold in walnuts if using.
5. Pour into prepared loaf pan and bake for 50 to 60 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean.
6. Let cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack.

I *love* making this bread on Sunday evenings. It’s a simple, foolproof recipe that feels like a warm hug as you sip your morning coffee on a chilly day.

Former Indiana Fever player and WNBA championship winner Tamika Catchings did the honors this morning, as she led the unveiling of a replica floor image of the official WNBA All-Star basketball court in Civic Plaza at the Indy airport.

“Fans will step off the plane and onto the court, ready to experience basketball in Indiana — where no one celebrates the game like Hoosiers,” said Catchings. “As they say, in 49 other states it’s just basketball, but THIS is Indiana!”

The Indy airport’s WNBA All-Star basketball court design features 19 stars from the Indiana state flag, is designed in the Indiana Fever colors, and includes all WNBA teams’ logos. The court image also features the WNBA’s three-point line, and it showcases heat-wave elements on the sidelines representing the excitement and fever-pitch growth across the league. The court image was printed and installed by Miles Printing, an Indiana-based woman-owned business. The appliqué took 92 hours of labor to install, and it will be in place until July 21.

Catchings, AT&T WNBA All-Star 2025 Host Committee co-chair and an Indianapolis Airport Authority board member, played host of the Coffee on the Court event as part of the unveiling, where the IAA team announced a winning schedule of upcoming public events and performances to rev up the Indy community’s game-time spirit.

“We’ve transformed the Indy airport into the gateway to basketball legacy,” said IAA Executive Director Mario Rodriguez. “From the Civic Plaza court to the community events, surrounded by WNBA All-Star graphics throughout the terminal, we’re creating moments that remind travelers they’ve landed in the home of the Indiana Fever.”",13,1750950714.0,wnba,1,0.84,False

My past has shaped me into a resilient, adaptable, and deeply caring individual who values honesty, loyalty, and integrity above all else. I much prefer verbal communication to truly connect, and I'm seeking a genuine, non-abusive partner to build a life with, share memories, and finally feel at home. My love language is expressed through quality time, acts of service, physical touch, and words of affirmation. If you're not recovering from a breakup or divorce and are ready for a real connection, I'd love to get to know you.


ABOUT ME

Hair colour: Black

Skin colour: naturally tanned skin

Height: 172cm

Always clean shaven

No tattoos or piercings

Anger: If I get angry, I suffer with a headache. So, I don't. I instead become frustrated and go for a walk or look at the sky.

When I used to get angry in the past, I would feel a sharp pain like someone was stabbing my head with thick needles. The pain would last for an hour or three. During this time I have broken down crying due to the pain.

A few months ago, I found an effective method that helps me relieve frustration which  is to take a paper and frantically scribble releasing all my frustration onto the paper, where I feel alot better in minutes.  

So, if you ever see me bent over the kitchen counter all tensed up scribbling, you will know that I either had a horrible day or I relieved very bad news and my I am in a state of shock where I am trying to make sense of the situation.

Energy: I have been hyperactive since I was a kid and have this ridiculous amount of energy where everyday I struggle to feel tired. I drink warm milk in the morning or stay up till 3AM just to be able to sit and work without feeling the urge to get up and run.

This is why, I want a wife who will let me do all the house chores, while she relaxes. So that I will feel a bit tired and be able to sleep peacefully.


Weight: varies between 70kg (150lb) to 75kg (165lb) depending on how much I eat and active I am. 

Smoking/Vaping Habits: None, I never have and never will.

Alcohol: Very rarely as in once in a few months and I have never gotten drunk and kept it under control.

Finances: I am very good at managing my finances where I manually keep track of my expenses and I enjoy using cash wherever it is accepted. 

Work out and eat healthy. 

Child-free life: 

I think I should NEVER have kids because I see parents pampering their kids and become overly worried when a child a child has a small scratch. I don't think I could ever be so soft as parent because I learned how to deal with life differently.

When I was a kid, I was given a German Army Pocket Knife (still have it to this day), basic compass, eight millimeter nylon rope and I had a whistle to send a SOS signal in morse code, all of which I learned from reading books.

I would spend my weekends in the mountains alone, eating blueberries and building a shelter during the heavy rains.

When I fell and hurt myself, I washed the wounds with water from a stream and tied a handkerchief around the wound until I came back home and administered first aid.

This self-learning, yet, fun process thought me how to adapt, navigate in different climates and environments turning forest and jungles into a playground with no restrictions and no adult supervision.

Text vs verbal communication: I am much better at verbal communication and I strongly feel its better to get to know each other over a call as its easy to express oneself emotionally. 


Why AM I STILL SINGLE?

Throughout my life, I have been someone who is lonely from the age of five in school as I was canned by the teachers because I didn't know how to speak a local language that is not spoken anywhere else in the world. I was also tortured by other students to the point where I ended up in coma after my head was dashed against the rocks. As a teenager, I was a this guy who didn't know how to properly communicate with other people due to the lack of social skills and it has taken me years to learn how to socialize. Somehow, I have learned to communicate in a professional environment well, but still struggle sometimes in a social environment where I overthink about what to say.

This is also why I have been single all my life until I was 29, when for the first time I felt what it was like to be in love and feel a sense of peace and happiness I have never felt or experienced before in my life. This relationship with the Chilean women ended in May 2024 as the person I met was a not who she was claimed to be and it's a long weird story that leaves most people feeling surprised and is better told over a call than written out in text. 

I have completely recovered from the painful breakup and now know myself alot better than I used to.

Limerence also made it difficult for me which caused me to mess in the getting to know stage with anyone  but now I have overcome to a great extent.

WHY DO I WANT TO GET MARRIED? 

To know that I mean something to one person in this world. 

To feel a sense of peace and not feel so lonely. Don't get me wrong. I have friends, but friends slowly dissappear with time the moment I move to another country, its how my life has always been.

To have someone to share memories together and walk together on this journey called life. 

To build a life together where we work as a team.

Although, my dynamic life is nice where I visit new places all the time and every week is a new experience, its also a life where I feel lonely and even if I make friends, I know that I will have to say goodbye.

I want to settle down somewhere in this world and build a life together instead of living a minimalistic life due to airline weight restrictions.

I have my own house back in my home country (I work abroad), but to me its just a house. Not a place I consider home.

DO NOT;

DO NOT Contact me if your recovering from a break up or divorce because you will use me to heal from your pain and once I help you recover, you will feel a l strong sense of independence and think ""I don't a man in my life and need time to focus on myself"" and just discard me like trash, leaving me with dissapointment and where I start wandering how to trust someone. It helps you, but hurts me more.

So far this has happened with a German, French, Russian and the last was the Egyptian. All four were recovering from a painful break up.

Please do not use me just to pass the time because you are bored. 

I have already been through hell in my life since I was five years all the way to adulthood where I have been tortured and suffered with back and knee pains for years until I recovered. I have also nearly drowned as I was held underwater and I have been in coma after my head was dashed against the rocks and I lost alot of blood. What has kept me alive is a calculation; my current age minus averge human life expectancy of 80 years equals the question ""what do I with the rest of my life?"". 

By constantly asking myself this question, I have been living a dynamic life where I work in one country then get a job in another country and work their before moving on to the next country. In each country I have had a different career as I love the challenge and the new experience.

I am NOT writing about what I went through to gain sympathy, but to discourage people who act kind and sweet, yet, take advantage of someone like me who is kind from my heart, can love a partner unconditionally and will care deeply when he falls in love with someone.


WHAT I DON'T CARE ABOUT IN A PARTNER - BASED ON MY EXPERIENCE OF DON'T JUDGE A BOOK BY IT'S COVER

1. How you treat other people: it does not matter how kind you are or if you go out of your way to help people or care about animals. What matters is who you are deep down in your heart and how you treat me.

Based on experience people who are sweet, kind, volunteered at animal shelters and seem to be amazing people are the ones who have hurt me the most, however, people who seem to be cold hearted and don't show empathy are the ones who turned out to the most reliable, caring people I know and whne they did show empathy it was real and came from their heart.

So, the only way to judge someone is when their is a disagreement or an area of conflict. Is the other person willing to talk things out and find a solution or is that person going to just leave the moment, their is a disagreement?

2. Religion: I will respect what you believe in and I will be more than happy to go to a place of worship if you want me to tag along, but don't force your religion on me. Thats all I ask.

3. Your Past: Your past is your past and it doesn't matter what bad decisions you made, what matters is who you are now and who you will be in the future. 

So, when we are getting to know each, you don't have to hide any anything or worry about being judged, because I don't. 

If your upfront and honest with me, I can be honest about myself.

1ll2kkk,https://www.reddit.com/r/XennialsDating/comments/1ll2kkk/30_m4f_seeking_a_partner_for_marriage_to_build_a/,30 [M4F] - Seeking a partner for marriage to build a life together,"Hi, I am a tall, black-haired, naturally tanned, and clean-shaven man with boundless energy and a unique way of managing frustration by intensely scribbling. My past has shaped me into a resilient, adaptable, and deeply caring individual who values honesty, loyalty, and integrity above all else. I much prefer verbal communication to truly connect, and I'm seeking a genuine, non-abusive partner to build a life with, share memories, and finally feel at home. My love language is expressed through quality time, acts of service, physical touch, and words of affirmation. If you're not recovering from a breakup or divorce and are ready for a real connection, I'd love to get to know you.


ABOUT ME

Hair colour: Black

Skin colour: naturally tanned skin

Height: 172cm

Always clean shaven

No tattoos or piercings

Anger: If I get angry, I suffer with a headache. So, I don't. I instead become frustrated and go for a walk or look at the sky.

When I used to get angry in the past, I would feel a sharp pain like someone was stabbing my head with thick needles. The pain would last for an hour or three. During this time I have broken down crying due to the pain.

A few months ago, I found an effective method that helps me relieve frustration which  is to take a paper and frantically scribble releasing all my frustration onto the paper, where I feel alot better in minutes.  

So, if you ever see me bent over the kitchen counter all tensed up scribbling, you will know that I either had a horrible day or I relieved very bad news and my I am in a state of shock where I am trying to make sense of the situation.

Energy: I have been hyperactive since I was a kid and have this ridiculous amount of energy where everyday I struggle to feel tired. I drink warm milk in the morning or stay up till 3AM just to be able to sit and work without feeling the urge to get up and run.

This is why, I want a wife who will let me do all the house chores, while she relaxes. So that I will feel a bit tired and be able to sleep peacefully.


Weight: varies between 70kg (150lb) to 75kg (165lb) depending on how much I eat and active I am. 

Smoking/Vaping Habits: None, I never have and never will.

Alcohol: Very rarely as in once in a few months and I have never gotten drunk and kept it under control.

Finances: I am very good at managing my finances where I manually keep track of my expenses and I enjoy using cash wherever it is accepted. 

Work out and eat healthy. 

Child-free life: 

I think I should NEVER have kids because I see parents pampering their kids and become overly worried when a child a child has a small scratch. I don't think I could ever be so soft as parent because I learned how to deal with life differently.

When I was a kid, I was given a German Army Pocket Knife (still have it to this day), basic compass, eight millimeter nylon rope and I had a whistle to send a SOS signal in morse code, all of which I learned from reading books.

I would spend my weekends in the mountains alone, eating blueberries and building a shelter during the heavy rains.

When I fell and hurt myself, I washed the wounds with water from a stream and tied a handkerchief around the wound until I came back home and administered first aid.

This self-learning, yet, fun process thought me how to adapt, navigate in different climates and environments turning forest and jungles into a playground with no restrictions and no adult supervision.

Text vs verbal communication: I am much better at verbal communication and I strongly feel its better to get to know each other over a call as its easy to express oneself emotionally. 


Why AM I STILL SINGLE?

Throughout my life, I have been someone who is lonely from the age of five in school as I was canned by the teachers because I didn't know how to speak a local language that is not spoken anywhere else in the world. I was also tortured by other students to the point where I ended up in coma after my head was dashed against the rocks. As a teenager, I was a this guy who didn't know how to properly communicate with other people due to the lack of social skills and it has taken me years to learn how to socialize. Somehow, I have learned to communicate in a professional environment well, but still struggle sometimes in a social environment where I overthink about what to say.

This is also why I have been single all my life until I was 29, when for the first time I felt what it was like to be in love and feel a sense of peace and happiness I have never felt or experienced before in my life. This relationship with the Chilean women ended in May 2024 as the person I met was a not who she was claimed to be and it's a long weird story that leaves most people feeling surprised and is better told over a call than written out in text. 

I have completely recovered from the painful breakup and now know myself alot better than I used to.

Limerence also made it difficult for me which caused me to mess in the getting to know stage with anyone  but now I have overcome to a great extent.

WHY DO I WANT TO GET MARRIED? 

To know that I mean something to one person in this world. 

To feel a sense of peace and not feel so lonely. Don't get me wrong. I have friends, but friends slowly dissappear with time the moment I move to another country, its how my life has always been.

To have someone to share memories together and walk together on this journey called life. 

To build a life together where we work as a team.

Although, my dynamic life is nice where I visit new places all the time and every week is a new experience, its also a life where I feel lonely and even if I make friends, I know that I will have to say goodbye.

I want to settle down somewhere in this world and build a life together instead of living a minimalistic life due to airline weight restrictions.

I have my own house back in my home country (I work abroad), but to me its just a house. Not a place I consider home.

DO NOT;

DO NOT Contact me if your recovering from a break up or divorce because you will use me to heal from your pain and once I help you recover, you will feel a l strong sense of independence and think ""I don't a man in my life and need time to focus on myself"" and just discard me like trash, leaving me with dissapointment and where I start wandering how to trust someone. It helps you, but hurts me more.

So far this has happened with a German, French, Russian and the last was the Egyptian. All four were recovering from a painful break up.

Please do not use me just to pass the time because you are bored. 

I have already been through hell in my life since I was five years all the way to adulthood where I have been tortured and suffered with back and knee pains for years until I recovered. I have also nearly drowned as I was held underwater and I have been in coma after my head was dashed against the rocks and I lost alot of blood. What has kept me alive is a calculation; my current age minus averge human life expectancy of 80 years equals the question ""what do I with the rest of my life?"". 

By constantly asking myself this question, I have been living a dynamic life where I work in one country then get a job in another country and work their before moving on to the next country. In each country I have had a different career as I love the challenge and the new experience.

I am NOT writing about what I went through to gain sympathy, but to discourage people who act kind and sweet, yet, take advantage of someone like me who is kind from my heart, can love a partner unconditionally and will care deeply when he falls in love with someone.


WHAT I DON'T CARE ABOUT IN A PARTNER - BASED ON MY EXPERIENCE OF DON'T JUDGE A BOOK BY IT'S COVER

1. How you treat other people: it does not matter how kind you are or if you go out of your way to help people or care about animals. What matters is who you are deep down in your heart and how you treat me.

Based on experience people who are sweet, kind, volunteered at animal shelters and seem to be amazing people are the ones who have hurt me the most, however, people who seem to be cold hearted and don't show empathy are the ones who turned out to the most reliable, caring people I know and whne they did show empathy it was real and came from their heart.

So, the only way to judge someone is when their is a disagreement or an area of conflict. Is the other person willing to talk things out and find a solution or is that person going to just leave the moment, their is a disagreement?

2. Religion: I will respect what you believe in and I will be more than happy to go to a place of worship if you want me to tag along, but don't force your religion on me. Thats all I ask.

3. Your Past: Your past is your past and it doesn't matter what bad decisions you made, what matters is who you are now and who you will be in the future. 

So, when we are getting to know each, you don't have to hide any anything or worry about being judged, because I don't. 

If your upfront and honest with me, I can be honest about myself. 

4. Your hobbies and interest. I have a wide range of hobbies and interest and I am also a very open minded person who enjoys new experiences.

5. Cooking: Since, I can cook, it does not matter if you don't know how to cook. 

6. Expressing yourself: If your someone who has trouble showing empathy or your the type of person who finds it difficult to show that you care, that is okay.

1ll2i87,https://www.reddit.com/r/RobotVacuums/comments/1ll2i87/vacuum_wars_review_of_the_eufy_e28_robot_vacuum/,Vacuum Wars Review of the eufy E28 Robot Vacuum Mop Combo with a SPOT Cleaner!,"Hey everyone,  
We’ve been testing the new **eufy E28** robot vacuum for a few weeks now, and wanted to give r/robotvacuums an early look before our full video review goes live in a couple weeks. The E28 is one of the more unusual robots we’ve tested—it's not only a solid vacuum/mop combo, but it also converts into a **handheld spot cleaner**, making it potentially very appealing to pet owners or anyone who deals with carpet messes regularly.

# Dual-Purpose Design: Robot + Spot Cleaner

What really sets the E28 apart is that it doubles as a carpet spot-cleaning machine. The clean and dirty water tanks used for mopping can be detached, revealing a hose and nozzle (complete with a brush and trigger), allowing you to use it like a traditional spot cleaner. For me, as someone with two cats who treat the rug like a personal science experiment, that’s a compelling feature.

It works similarly to other spot cleaners—squeeze the trigger to spray, agitate with the brush, and vacuum the mess up. **And since the device is already pre-filled and sitting in the room, it's far more likely to be used than a full-size spot cleaner that lives in a closet.** There's even a handy self-cleaning button that flushes the hose, making cleanup easy.

In our tests, the spot cleaner's suction was a bit below average overall (40"" compared to 55"" avg), but still stronger than the best-selling Bissell Little Green (39""). And it handled pretreated dried-on coffee and grape juice stains surprisingly well.

# Vacuum Performance

When used as a robot vacuum, the E28 performed impressively. It handled debris of all sizes—fine dust to XL particles—on both hard floors and carpet with ease. It even includes an auto-extending side brush for improved edge cleaning. In our carpet deep clean test, it scored 85%, well above the 75% average and among the top 8 out of more than 150 robots we've tested.

Obstacle avoidance was another strong point. The E28 uses a front camera and multiple sensors and scored 23 out of 24 in our avoidance tests—one of the highest scores we’ve seen. Eufy has consistently been strong in this category, and the E28 continues that trend.

Navigation was also above average thanks to its top-mounted LiDAR (which we generally prefer over internal LiDAR systems). It was efficient and thorough in mapping and cleaning.

# Mopping System

The E28’s mopping setup uses a **roller-style mop** rather than the more common spinning pads. That’s significant because it allows the E28 to actually suck up small liquid spills into its onboard dirty water tank—something pad-based robots can’t do. In our dried-on stain test, it performed well above average, though it did leave behind more water than we’d like (1.3g), regardless of water level settings in the app. That means it’s a bit more prone to streaking, but the cleaning power was excellent.

The mop lifts 10.5mm when carpets are detected, and you can set it to avoid carpets altogether or clean them before mopping.

# Dock and App Experience

The auto-empty dock is solid. It empties debris into a bag, washes the mop roller with cold water, drains the dirty water, refills the tank, and finishes off with hot air drying. The only thing missing is hot water washing, which some flagship docks now include.

The app is user-friendly and well-featured—virtual barriers, multi-level maps, bin behavior customization, obstacle sensitivity, and more. Both the iOS and Android versions have high ratings.

# A Few Weak Spots

Now for the potential deal-breaker: long hair. The E28 has a newly designed dual-part brush that does a good job avoiding tangles with regular pet hair, but in our 7-inch hair test, it failed dramatically. Hair gathered behind the brush in dense clumps we called “hair cigars”—the worst score we’ve recorded for that test. We re-ran the test and got the same result. It might be a fluke, but if you have long hair in your home, it’s worth noting.

There were also a few minor drawbacks:

* Suction and airflow were a bit underwhelming for its price point.
* The onboard dustbin is small at 300mL.
* If you use the spot cleaner heavily, the hose and nozzle components may wear out faster than the rest of the robot—and it’s unclear how easy they’ll be to replace.

Battery life was average. While efficiency was slightly below par in raw tests, the E28’s navigational smarts helped it cover around 1,200 sq. ft. per charge.

# Final Verdict

The E28 made it into the [Vacuum Wars Top 20 list,](https://vacuumwars.com/vacuum-wars-best-robot-vacuums/) currently sitting at #15 with a **score of 3.86 stars** (vs. the average of 2.8). It’s a solid robot vacuum and a decent mop, with **top-tier obstacle avoidance** and a **dock that nearly does it all**. The spot cleaner feature is genuinely innovative, and for some people, it might be a game changer.

But if you have long hair in the house, or you’re picky about streaking on hard floors, it might not be the ideal fit.

Hey there,
I'm just a 23-year-old Punjabi guy with a lean build, curly hair, a beard, and brown eyes—people say I look Arab (not sure, you decide 🧿).

Engineering grad, applying for Masters in Germany 🇩🇪. Life's chaotic, but I still believe in soft love, slow hugs, and holding hands when words fall short.

🌿 So, who am I?
• Friendly neighborhood handyman 🛠️ – I fix stuff around the house and maybe your mood too (bonus: I'll never mess up IKEA instructions).
• Emotionally available homebody – I love talking. Deep convos, cute rants, or even just listening to you overthink your outfit while I make us tea/coffee ☕


• Loyal & communicative – No ghosting. I’ll text back mid-cooking if I care. (And I will care.)

🛍️ What I’m into:
• Working out & yoga – fit heart, fit soul because who doesn't love a hot body and hmm 👀

• Cooking – I love cooking and I'll send u pics of things I make , not sure if they will be good but u decide.

• Psychology, history, mythology – Let’s binge documentaries and fall asleep mid-theory

• Sarcasm + soft heart – I’ll tease you and also remind you how precious you are in the same breath

• DIY guy – If your lamp breaks, I’ll fix it. If your day breaks, I’ll fix that too

💌 What I'm hoping for:
• Someone clingy in the sweetest way, a little bossy and dominant because dominant womens are my weakness and I love a little possessiveness, obsession ,knows what she wants, and isn’t afraid to take charge when I zone out while admiring your eyes 👀

• A mix of silly and mature. You overthink things? Me too. Let’s overthink together.

• Someone who values communication, cuddles, and random compliments about your elbows just because they’re cute.

If even one tiny thing above matches your vibe… message me. (Please don't be shy and message me even if we don't get there and lovers we can be good friends and who knows we might develop things also because I'm writing this with hope 😭)

If you ever dreamed of someone texting you just to ask, “Why are clouds so dramatic?”—I’m your guy ☁️💬

If you love old-school love, believe that connection is about presence, effort, and choosing someone daily—I’m here for it too.

I’m not here to waste time or play games. I’m not here to be creepy or pushy. I’m here to find real connection and someone whose hands I can hold while we talk about your mascara, heels, or how the dress u wanted was sold out. 👑🫶🏽",1,1750950374.0,friendship,1,0.67,False

 I decided not to talk to my ex’s family but my BiL (26M) found out.

 He didn’t believe we’d drifted apart (which is what we told him), and he didn’t understand why I had no intention of getting back together. I guess he thought/hoped this was just a blip and we’d work things out.

 I don’t blame him – my ex and I have been together in one form or another for as long as he can remember. And due to the age gap, my ex and I have always been more like a second set of parents to him than siblings.

 I ended up having to tell him about the affair. My BiL is beyond angry and disgusted. He and my ex have fallen out over it.

 I wish I hadn’t told him, but he could tell there was something we weren’t telling him, and he wouldn’t leave it alone. I have only told him the bare minimum – that my ex was cheating and is in a relationship with the affair partner.

 Update 2:

 I’ve been getting help and support from friends and family (especially from BiL). Also, some kind Redditors reached out to me via PM and checked in on me – thank you!

 I’m in therapy. It’s helped me come to terms with things and move on (or start to). Obviously, it’s still a work in progress, but I’m doing 100 times better, at least compared to where I was at the beginning of the year.

 Now I’m just waiting for my ex to move out. There’s an affordable housing crisis where we live, so he’s struggling to find a place within his budget. When he does find one, it gets snapped up quickly. It sucks but it is what it is.

 I’ve been getting out more. Spending time with friends. My daughter and I have been going out and doing fun things, just the two of us, any chance we get. The extra bonding has been great for both of us.

 Update 3:

 This is probably the biggest. I started dating someone.

 I’ve been going to the gym for nearly a year. Dan (34M) was just one of many regular faces, but we never spoke until the end of last year. Some guy was harassing me, blocking my way so I was forced to talk to him. Dan stepped in, told him to back off. The guy was still hovering, so Dan stuck with me until the end of my workout.

 Since then we would chat. Only about our work out, like “How many sets are you doing?”. Nothing remotely flirtatious.

 I used to go to the gym once or twice a week. After my ex and I broke up, I started going 4-5 times a week. And I guess because I was going more often, Dan and I chatted more until we moved from workout chats to stuff like “How was your day?” or “Any plans for the weekend?”

 One day, we ended up getting a cold drink together in the gym café. After that, post-workout hangouts became a regular thing.

 Then, he started driving me home.

 Eventually we started to hang out outside of the gym (usually just getting coffee).

 A few weeks ago, he asked me out on a date.

 I was surprised. I had no idea he liked me.

 I know what I wrote makes it seem obvious, but this is the Cliff Notes version. It happened more slowly and more… organically, I guess? For example, we first got a drink together because it was unseasonably hot so we both happened to be getting a cold drink. It wasn’t like he suddenly invited me for a drink afterwards.

 Looking back, I realise that over time, I started to look forward to seeing him. We would always be happy to see each other. I would find my mind going to him more and more often. But I guess what with everything happening, my idiot brain didn’t connect the dots.

 Anyway, I was certainly open to a date, but I didn’t want to rush into anything, so I asked if I could have a few days to think about it. He said sure, take as much time as you need.

 I thought meeting him in the gym the next day would be awkward, but we chatted like nothing had happened. He didn’t ask again or pester me, even after several days. So I agreed to the date. Things hadn’t been weird while he waited for his answer, so if we went on the date and things didn’t pan out, we could just carry on like adults.

 The first date went really well. He showed up with flowers. It was our first time seeing each other all dressed up, so when I opened the door we just kind of stared at each other for a minute – I didn’t even notice the flowers at first!

 We went on a second date a few days ago. That went well too. We’ve both agreed that we want to keep seeing each other, but I told Dan I wanted to take things slowly. He said that’s fine, we’ll go at whatever pace I’m comfortable with. So we’re planning a third date, maybe a something longer like a day out.

 Dan knows I have a daughter, that I am getting divorced, and that my ex still lives with me.

 The last thing I want is for this to be just a rebound or some unhealthy coping mechanism or something, so I’ve been talking to my therapist about Dan and discussing safe, healthy ways to proceed.

 Things are still… not messy as such – my ex and I are being civil - but he’s been acting weird since the breakup, and it’s only gotten worse since Dan and I started going on dates, but I guess it’s another story for another day. I might need to get advice on another Subreddit for it.",9,1750950242.0,AITA_Relationships,10,1.0,False

We had a long convo that night, laughed a lot, and even slow danced at one point. I left thinking we had serious chemistry. He asked for my number before I left and texted me later that night saying he had a great time. Naturally, I got all excited.

But since then… it’s been weird. He replies, but super slow. Like sometimes 10-12 hours between messages, and his responses are short, like “haha yeah” or “cool.” I tried suggesting we grab coffee or even go for a walk sometime, and he just hit me with a “maybe, I’ll let you know” and never brought it up again. And yet he still views all my IG stories within minutes. I know that doesn’t mean anything, but it just confuses me more.

I guess I’m wondering, how do you really know when a guy is just not that into you vs. when he’s maybe shy or busy or just bad at texting? I don’t want to keep overthinking this or make excuses, but I also don’t want to assume the worst if I’m missing something.

I asked ChatGPT what it is I should do and it gave me this plan and I just wanted to get some advice from people who’ve been through it as to whether the plan is gonna work on its own or what adjustment I should make to it. 

By the way I have a very stressful day-to-day life and I struggle to see how I can change that, any advice on that part is appreciated. 

⏳ Phase 1: Elimination & Healing (4–8 weeks)

	•	Strictly avoid trigger foods during this period.

	•	The goal is to let your esophagus and throat heal and allow inflammation to go down.

	•	This phase also helps you identify which foods are your personal triggers.


Foods to avoid strictly during this time:

	•	Caffeine (coffee, energy drinks, cola)

	•	Chocolate

	•	Citrus (orange, lemon, pineapple)

	•	Tomatoes and sauces

	•	Mint (including gum or toothpaste)

	•	Fried/fatty foods

	•	Spicy foods

	•	Carbonated drinks

Also:

	•	No eating 2–3 hours before bed

	•	No lying flat after meals


⸻

⏳ Phase 2: Reintroduction (4+ weeks)

	•	After about 4–8 weeks of relief, you can gradually reintroduce one food at a time every few days.

	•	Track your symptoms. If the cough returns after, say, chocolate or orange juice — that’s a personal trigger.


⸻

⏳ Phase 3: Long-Term Management (Ongoing)

	•	Once you’ve identified your triggers, you may only need to avoid a few specific foods permanently, not the whole list.

	•	Some people tolerate small amounts of trigger foods earlier in the day, but not at night.

I’m a 32-year-old guy living in Delhi, and I’m on the lookout for a kind, fun-loving person who’s up for some strictly platonic cuddle sessions. Think movie marathons under a warm blanket, good conversation, and zero pressure—just genuine human connection and comfort.

**A bit about me:**

* Friendly, respectful, and easygoing—great listener and talker in equal measure
* Work from home as a consultant, so my schedule is flexible
* Hobbies include gaming, experimenting with new cocktails, reading, weekend road trips and much more.

**What I’m offering:**

* A clean, private, & cozy spot in Delhi with fresh sheets, soft pillows, and calming playlists
* A judgment-free zone—feel free to be yourself, laugh, chat, or just unwind in comfortable silence
* Respect for boundaries: no expectations and lighthearted conversation
* Snacks, chai/coffee, and maybe some homemade pasta if we click!

**What I’m looking for:**

* 30–40+, who values warmth, trust, and honesty
* Someone who’s comfortable with clear communication and mutual consent
* Open to meeting for coffee first or a brief walk in the park to break the ice

I have been dating this woman for 6 months, we have a good relationship with lots of communication. I have been open about my desire to marry her, have kids with her, etc. and we have spoken about the future and started to make plans. Having said that, I have led the way in terms of emotional commitment and vulnerability and she does tend to ground us, which has the ""pump the brakes"" effect, which I don't love, but I do understand. For instance, when talking about moving in, I am excited because I want to see her more and spend more time and she says things like ""we have to see if it works, we don't know if we will hate each other yet"". Again, don't love it, but I get it, she has kind of a jaded life history as it relates to men.

She recently met a man on the train who is a retired accountant and older (I think 60's/70's), and they traded numbers because they live in the same town. Originally it was ""maybe we will all hang out"" referring to the group on the train and then it was ""I am going to coffee with John"". Then last night they went to dinner just the two of them, and made plans to go get wine in a few weeks at a winery.

I don't consider myself a jealous man, but I do feel some type of way. Without guiding anyone, I would like to know people's thoughts on this. Am I out of line thinking she shouldn't be seeing a new male friend given where we are in our relationship? Am I alone in thinking this is an odd friendship that I don't fully trust?

You can go straight to Youtube for video playlists without unhinged commentary for both [ETHPrague 2025](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkCRcxMT8qhZZC1ZcjuSu80FYHppongXo) and [Pragma Prague 2025](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXzKMXK2aHh7vLS72NelQ2dOx2VgPNxJZ).)

I arrived at Holešovice market feeling anxious. This was my first Ethereum event, and I wasn’t sure what to expect.  A security guard stood ramrod straight in front of an ETHPrague banner, like the hall needed protecting from unknown hordes. He glanced at my wrist dismissively and pointed at the next building.

There, things looked a bit more hopeful. A woman stood behind a make-shift counter,  radiating the excitement of a first-time substitute teacher determined not to mess up.

""Hi,"" I said. ""I'm Twelve Meatballs.""

She looked at me. I looked at her.

She broke first. ""I need your ticket.""

Of course she did. I pulled out my phone, flustered.

""Are you--"" She paused, swallowing the word *lost*.  ""...here for ETHPrague?""

""Yes,"" I said, poking frantically at my phone.

""It's a QR code,"" she told me. She was on the verge of explaining to me what a QR code was when I finally found my ticket. She scanned it, relieved that the issue had been so easily resolved. Then, almost as an afterthought, she handed me a paper bag of goodies: plastic battery pack, postcard, and a small bottle of what looked like soy sauce. ""It's an energy drink,"" she told me helpfully.

I slipped into my first session, sitting in the back like I was afraid someone was going to give me detention. ""Prove you are human,"" said the man on the small podium and for a moment, I wasn't sure I could.

(I'll link the talks as I go so you can consider which ones are worth watching.)

That was [Rémi introducing Self Protocol](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFUHuN0g5ls); at that point, I had no idea that I was [going to end up obsessing about their proof of humanity](https://twelvemeatballs.com/coverage/proof-of-humanity/). Next, Mely.eth talked about the shift from domains to usernames and how [ENS can solve the centralization of our online identities](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHtROWyI-oo).

The morning had barely started and already my brain was full.

I slipped out as unobtrusively as I could and returned to the security guard. ""I'm just wondering if there's anywhere here to get coffee.""

""I wouldn't know,"" he said. ""But there's this thing called Google Maps.""

Chastened, I turned to walk away. ""Right. Thanks.""

""No, wait."" He pulled out his phone. ""I'm just looking."" He hadn't been telling me off, just thinking out loud.

I smiled and glanced at his nametag. It said ShieldTech.

""OK, I found something,"" said ShieldTech. Coffee was available at the opposite side of the market but he didn't like the route Google offered. ""Don't do that. Just go straight this way and turn left. It's called...."" He struggled to translate the name. ""I think Coffee King.""

I did not need the name of the coffee place and especially not in English. ""Thank you very much,"" I called over my shoulder, escaping back into the hall before he could be any more helpful.

In the main presentation room, [Anthurine Xiang introduced EIP-7907](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzEY0_6EL44) in a fantastically relatable manner, using Uber as an analogy: surely you wouldn't want your driver to pay a flat rate, regardless of the distance of your trip. But at the same time, you wanted to know how much you were likely to pay before you got in the car. I'm not saying I *understood* EIP-7907 but at least I was starting to grasp what was at stake.

Unfortunately, this seemed to mark the limit of my ability to take in new information. I wandered into [mf's talk on the new Cypherpunk generation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqTLKi1mZ40) hoping for something revolutionary. I left mostly thinking about lunch.

I made my way to a coffee stall that may or may not have been called Coffee King. ""Do you speak English?""

He rolled his eyes. ""What do you want?""

I relaxed. This was much more the level of service I expected in Eastern Europe. I ordered a caffé latte, ""just a single shot,"" I told him. I needed to pace myself for the soy sauce drink later. He rolled his eyes and handed me a milky coffee. Fortified, I returned to the conference.

The highlight of my day was [Tomasz Stańczak's fireside chat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUADTUaXoDs&t=6s). Someone behind me was muttering about Layer 2s capturing all of the value and Stańczak responded as if he'd heard the man, explaining that the first focus had to be the growth of the network.  ""This is not the time to imagine that Ethereum has to focus on collecting fees from L2s."" Instead, he suggested that we want L2s to keep winning and expanding.  Our biggest challenge right now, he said, was the courage to change things and the courage to explore.

If there was an official Ethereum anthem, I would have been humming it.

Andrew Koller of Kraken's talk [on onboarding users, not just holders](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2C92EZ5KK_U) shocked me with the stat that only 20% of users bother to withdraw funds from Kraken; the majority are holders, not users, and he wants to change this.  From there, I accidentally sat in on [Gavin Wood’s talk on Jam and CoreVM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWkytppv8Ns): I understood maybe 3% of it, but the parts I *did* catch were fascinating.

That was the pattern: sharp edges of clarity inside long stretches of blur. [Mariia Yaatskovska on CoW swaps solver competition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzlkHTZHi6M), [DCBuilder on the trust issues of client-side proving](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOi-zAXReNE&pp=0gcJCdQJAYcqIYzv) and [Tomas Studenik on what happens if we lose power](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7EKLow08Fw) all had good and accessible talks.

I ended the day with [the panel on Ethereum Privacy Roadmap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5iMds9_s90), which became [the first of my articles about the conference](https://twelvemeatballs.com/coverage/ethprague-we-are-larping-at-privacy/).

I have to admit that I was relieved that the content for the day was over. By the end, I didn't even have enough energy to keep saying hello to ShieldTech, who kept staring sternly ahead as if I might be a fatal distraction to his role as our protector. I found a restaurant near my hostel and collapsed into a platter of Schnitzel to consider my thoughts.

https://preview.redd.it/7oj0p9beba9f1.jpg?width=3321&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d2bdda49229f07a4b5b9b3084f333806a218a169

I'd  worried that the conference would be too technical, aimed at devs and genius mathematicians and not relevant or even comprehensible to me. And sure, there was technical content but there was also plenty for an outsider like me to engage with. Not just plenty, too much to even keep up with.

\~o\~

It was raining as I arrived for Day Two.  ShieldTech waved me over. ""I have new information,"" he told me. ""If you want coffee, you just go into that hall there. The one marked as..."" He paused, possibly counting in English in his head. ""Seventeen. That is where you should go to get coffee."" I had the feeling he'd spoken more English today than in the previous three years.

""No problem,"" he said, and went back to watching people's wrists to make sure they had their wristbands.

I fingered my mystery soy sauce bottle and went straight to the presentation rooms.

Somehow, the day-two schedule was even better than the first.  I started with [Katarzyna Kiwalska's lament](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0slXeRXe-2g) that companies seem to always be waiting for the right moment to start worrying about sustainability.  Dr. Maurice Chiodo amused us with his consulting work on [AI projects seriously lacking in common sense](https://youtu.be/46prZzUxa8Q?si=09zVXk6rqNszD7J7), let alone ethics.

https://preview.redd.it/63lvb2fhba9f1.jpg?width=2795&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d59cfe35225cdaad1ed74b797906d88ed33d4c3c

The first fireside talk of the day was [Aya Miyaguchi and Christopher Fabian](https://youtu.be/GSQg2yccM_4?si=gFeq921kyBay4f1O) talking about the Ethereum Foundation and working with UNICEF (my favorite anecdote: Aya trying to surreptitiously text Vitalik under the table to say ""I think this guy is serious""  while Chris thought that maybe she was just really bored of him). This was followed by the headlining fireside chat with Vitalik Buterin and Tim Berners-Lee (ETHPrague have not released this video but you can read my take: [Dreams of Decentralization](https://twelvemeatballs.com/coverage/dreams-of-decentralization/)).

After that line-up, I retreated to the open courtyard, where thankfully it had stopped raining. I made the mistake of checking X to see a viral post: ""So is there *anyone* in crypto who's over 30?"" The online discourse seems to constantly reinforce that the crypto-verse is overwhelmingly white, male, and above all young. At ETHPrague, it couldn't have been more off-base. Sure, two baby-faced boys of dubious hygiene sat at the table behind me, arguing about serious hackathon stuff.  But at the same time, a couple in their 60s walked past, talking animatedly, dressed like they'd just stepped out of a Milan showroom. I could hear at least four languages being spoken from a range of men and women

The space wasn't *just* young and it definitely wasn't just male. Admittedly, the two hackers definitely needed proof of being over 18 but no one questioned their right to be there. Or mine.

And honestly, that felt pretty great.

I returned to the fray with a quick smile at ShieldTech, who had gone back to pretending that he'd never seen me before.

I was ready for the next firehose of information. Sara Polak cracked us up between hard facts about [archaeology and how blockchain could make a difference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3Je2snOPVc). Paul Brody injected us with raw hopium as he talked about [enterprise use of stablecoins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NivgjKN1NX0). [Joachim Schwerin from DG GROW of the European Commission](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGwm53kO44A) nailed the need for anonymity, calling out the huge systemic risks in legacy capital systems.

https://preview.redd.it/bam9y1fjba9f1.jpg?width=2869&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1bbc907eb9d776bacb88464ffcf6023453c59041

My biggest challenge wasn't going to be searching for three presentations to write about...but picking *only* three.

The only downside was that the whole thing felt wildly unmoderated. There were “hosts,” not moderators. No one was managing the time, so talks ran over, questions rambled, and transitions didn’t really exist. In ROOT, I heard one host say “Hey, you don’t have to leave,” as half the room quietly did. The problem was that there was no break to change tracks: if you didn't walk out, you missed the beginning of the next interesting talk or worse, got caught up in an audience member's monologue of ""not a question but more of a comment"".

Still, it was a great day and I was overflowing with ideas and cross connections. And on top of everything else, when I left, ShieldTech almost smiled at me.

I had thousands of words of notes. It took two beers to stop my brain from spinning and a glass of wine to get it spinning in the other direction.

\~o\~

Somehow, the third day, I convinced myself that not only could I take in another day of conference presentations but that I could attend *two conferences at once*. This was the final day of ETHPrague but also the only day of ETHGlobal Pragma, situated in another hall about five minutes away.

This time, I registered at the ETHGlobal tent without any confusion or weird explanations. Although, I also did not receive any mystery soy sauce bottles, so I might need to rethink that approach.

Back at Hall 13, ShieldTech *definitely* smiled at me. Then he saw that I was wearing the wrong wristband.  I said something about the other conference but he just shook his head and looked away. I felt like I'd just been caught cheating.

ETHGlobal Pragma felt like a tech conference dressed up for its first job interview: champagne instead of Red Bull, tasteful music, photographers everywhere, waiters bustling through to pick up abandoned plates of canapes. The caffé latte came with meticulous foam art. Hipster devs and first-time hackathon attendees looked equally uneasy as they stood at the cloth-covered tables. Someone nodded hello to me and I spilled my coffee in surprise. It was day three: was I... a veteran?

Some of the same speakers were at ETHGlobal Pragma as at ETHPrague but they were just as good the second time around. Tomasz Stanczak spoke eloquently in more detail about [Ethereum's long-term vision](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wacHN851czA). [Martin Derka and his cats](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYM92J7kgPE) talked about Intelligent Sequencers which sounds dull but definitely wasn't. (My notes just say, ""F\*ck me, I think I understand Zircuit"" but this may have just been a fever dream.)

https://preview.redd.it/d3j7352mba9f1.jpg?width=3308&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1643d20d91dbae1bc589832b3687f1bb9662a5d4

I returned to the ETHPrague halls, putting the relevant armband on the other wrist like I was advertising my poly status. ShieldTech nodded approvingly and let me in.

I had arranged to meet an online friend for lunch, except that I was too hyped up to eat and instead offloaded conference braindumps on the poor man. You know who you are...Sorry, but it did help!  After that much needed debrief, I was wow'd by [Aleksejs Ivashuk's talk on what happens if your government says you don't exist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BcFA6EsnTms), which led directly to my [querying Self Protocol's solution](https://twelvemeatballs.com/coverage/proof-of-humanity/).

I wandered back to ETHGlobal Pragma  ~~for more canapes~~  to watch Chris Hobcroft talking about what Ethereum's *for*, but by now, I was struggling to take any new information in or even to stay awake.

I wasn't quite desperate enough to try the soy sauce energy drink but luckily, Paul Brody woke me up again with his engaging talk on why [privacy is critical for business adoption](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wacHN851czA&list=PLXzKMXK2aHh7vLS72NelQ2dOx2VgPNxJZ&index=3&pp=iAQB) (although I still don't understand why he is passionately against TEEs).

And then, as if in a fever dream, I realized that we were already at the finale. Vitalik's keynote was an  [amazing call to action for DAOs](https://youtu.be/4cwLvbnpWwY?si=Fo7MxwSTzSAfxqVv) to reinvent themselves so they can aim for greatness. He spoke with Kartik Talwar for an hour and fifteen minutes, until the sounds of glasses clinking for the ETHGlobal Happy Hour became overwhelming and they brought the presentation to a close.

[Photograph courtesy of the ETHGlobal Pragma Flickr account](https://preview.redd.it/1mnd15ooba9f1.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4ea756af39e19a2fc77132ba2974b441afc9a9ed)

I ended up sipping Pils next to a shark-faced man wearing a suit that cost more than my annual income. He introduced himself with a smooth smile, explaining that he was one of the ETHGlobal  sponsors. Was I taking part in the Hackathon?

""I'm a writer,"" I said, managing somehow *not* to introduce myself as Twelve Meatballs or offer weird personal details that would need serious explaining. As a result, I didn't identify myself at all, too tired and confused to attempt to be witty.  ""I'm writing about the conference.""

""That's interesting,"" he said. ""Where can I read your work?""

I looked at him blankly. The conference was still in progress; how could I have written about it already?

His smile tightened. ""Like a website?"" He was clearly trying to be kind.  As it happens, I have four (4) websites with various types of writing on them, any one of which I could have told him about. But at that moment, this escaped me. 

""I haven't written it yet,"" I said, as if I'd never written a word in my life.

He nodded and kept nodding as he moved to the next table, introducing himself with a smooth smile.

I retreated to the halls of ETHPrague, where my friend ShieldTech informed me that the conference was over and everyone was leaving. After an awkward pause, he helpfully informed me that there was a rave that I could go to.

Attending a Czech rave would make for a wildly amusing story but I had already experienced more than my share of failed social interactions for the day. I had at least one Gb of notes and a bottle of soy sauce in my bag that I was apparently doomed to carry around forever. That felt like enough.

Have been really enjoying espresso and thought it would be a fun hobby to get into and to get my gf away from nespresso pods coffee (don’t like the hot water moving through plastic). I have no experience making espresso, I’m excited for the new hobby but easier is better. 

Trying to keep it budget friendly, happy to go used or take some time to find a deal. 

Sounds like the grinder is just as important if not more than the machine, so add $100-$150 for a decent grinder. Already budget is in danger

Found the breville bambino. relatively affordable, a lot of people agree it’s a good machine for the price, good for beginners, etc. Great. But it’s full of plastic, including hot water through plastic tubing which is half the reason of me moving to espresso. 

Gaggio classic pro. A little higher in price but a lot less plastic. Seems fairly recommended for beginners. Little more research and seems like you needs mods right out of the gate and I keep hearing the term temperature surfing. As a total novice, this doesn’t seem like the right machine

Wirsh. Very affordable and low plastic. But people says it’s a bambino knock off that’s not as good and not worth buying

Manual machines like robot, flair, la povani. This isn’t what I had pictured when I went looking for an espresso machine, but I’m open to it. Seems like there’s still preheating issues, consistency issues. La povani appears to be overpriced? 

TLDR. Looked at all the standard beginner machines. Most are high in plastic or require mods or more skills than a beginner would have. I’m stuck. Probably too in the weeds and just need some simplification. ",1,1750949451.0,espresso,7,1.0,False

I’ve never done any of these actions to a partner before this relationship.

A few days ago, we were fighting again. There were a lot of details that were wrong and changed and I began calling her some really bad names and telling her she’s a bad mother (in not polite terms). She threw a cup of coffee in my face and I finally broke. I ended our relationship and am likely going to lose my daughter. She’s started a campaign against me with her friends and family. She’s getting a lawyer paid for by her family. My credit card is maxed out over the years of her having access to it and have little to no family to support me financially.

I don’t know who I’ve become in this relationship. I don’t recognize myself when we fight. I am currently in counselling for rage and anger management because I hate who I am now. 

I’m not looking for a pat on the back here and to be told that it’s not my fault. I know I’m a piece of shit here and should be controlling myself. 

I guess I’m just looking to see what others have done in the past to become themselves again and/or other people who have started from scratch.",6,1750949230.0,BPDlovedones,4,0.88,False
1ll20hh,https://www.reddit.com/r/AuDHDWomen/comments/1ll20hh/cant_think_of_a_title_to_encompass_how_stagnate_i/,Can't think of a title to encompass how stagnate I feel,"My therapist has warned me that I'm on the verge of burning out for months now and I've been able to tell that I've slid into this pit where I'm... not numb per se, but just extremely low ebb. My husband has a drinking problem and we have gone round and round about it for years. The unpredictability of it destabilizes me on a near-weekly basis. We're in couples therapy for the problems related to that, but it's just not solved; only he can do that. 

My routine is thus: I wake up, I go make coffee, read my phone, go sit at my desk to work (I wfh), I work 8.5 to 9.5 hours and finish. He may work a few of those hours (he also is wfh), or if he's feeling low, he might be drinking, or maybe he drank the night before, and is sleeping until noon. After work we watch a movie or tv show together. 

I don't hear from friends. Only 2 of them know about my husband's problem; one I told a few years ago and one I told a few months ago. The one who's known longest was always one of my best friends but she lives in another state and has 2 kids; I gradually got the feeling that she felt unequipped to help and possibly that she didn't want the negativity. I do not hear from her very often. The second friend was shocked at this news, and vowed to check in on me, but after doing so once, I didn't hear back. She is audhd too, and also a parent, and I've told myself it's maybe an ""out of sight out of mind"" type thing and I've tried not to take it personally. I feel like I can't confide about the problems we have because I don't want people to look at him differently, and I'm afraid of being ""too negative"", which is something I've heard in the past. As such, I am just alone with this. Or the handful of times I hear from people in a month it's to trade TikToks. I have no deep connections to anyone.

I realized I was fully in a functional freeze when I accidentally deleted Bumble BFF off my phone and I just didn't do anything about it. I actually had struck up a couple of convos with nice-seeming women in my area, and though I am DESPERATE for friends, when I was faced with trying to reset a password and reinstall the app I just... didn't. I literally just thought, ""I have nothing to offer anyone"". The idea of trying to embark on a new friendship and mask while the whole time I am bursting at the seams to just yell ""My husband is an alcoholic and I am SO ALONE"" seems exhausting. Last year I got dinner with someone for the first time and she was proposing game nights and stuff with our spouses and in my head while she talked, I was just thinking of him getting drunk and ruining things. 

I'm burned out from supporting us, my job, dealing with the strain of his issues, the horrors of the day to day (who has time to do chores at the end of the world??), and to top it all off, I do not have anyone to confide in. My poor therapist just becomes the sounding board. We don't even do therapy, I just list off all the reasons I'm miserable.

It was a normal, manual machine, not automatic.

I befriended a girl at my job last year. Let’s call her Melissa. Me and my other friend started getting close with her, and I saw our friendship only going in a positive, closer direction. I ended up inviting her to my wedding. She RSVPed yes.

My other friend and I ended up quitting at that job due to a lot of drama with our boss. And that’s when Melissa grew distant from us. She went from hot to cold over night with not much explanation. She became snarky with both of us. We did a big group outing in April and she expressed wanting to get together multiple times with my friend and I but never anything concrete. I’ve attempted three times to get a date/time on the calendar and she gets flakey about it.

I’m just so confused and would love answers of what happened but she just doesn’t respond if I try to initiate a coffee date when she’s brought up wanting to hang out three times in the past few months. When I try to make something happen, she flakes or doesn’t confirm a date. My friend and I are at a loss what to do, and I genuinely don’t want her at my wedding if she doesn’t want to be friends with me especially with how intimate it is. The space is small, my other friends don’t like her, and I feel like I will be distracted by her being there on the big day if this doesn’t get resolved. 

TLDR: My friend has changed in the last several months since RSVPing to my wedding. I’ve tried reaching out but she’s been flakey. Should I uninvite her to one of the most important, intimate, and vulnerable days of my life?

I dosed 18g into my DF64. Set the kettle to 198f. Rinsed the filter that came with the Switch, added my coffee and started with this recipe:

Open switch, 50ml for bloom at 45 seconds. Switch still open, add another 50ml. Close switch at 1:15 and add water to get to 290ml. 

Wait one minute and open switch for drawdown. My grind might have been a bit fine, total time was 3:45.

The coffee was clean and smooth, a bit on the lighter body side for my personal taste but satisfying. Blueberry, raspberry, faint currant finish. Compared to the cupping notes of blackberry, grapefruit, papaya, raspberry and rosemary.

I'm open for comments and feed back on the way I used the Switch, I'm hoping to get the most out of this nice little brewer.

So, I’m just gonna say it… making new Gamer Friends as an adult is weirdly hard, but here I am giving it a go. I’m a 32M from the U.S. who loves video games, coffee, retro vibes, and chatting about everything from lore to life. I game on PC and console and I’m mostly looking for other chill, funny, and kind people to connect with long term.

Some of my favorite games are:  
Baldur’s Gate 3  
Dead by Daylight (I will absolutely scream like I’m in an 80s horror flick)  
Fortnite (no builds, just chaotic fun)  
Phasmophobia  
The Quarry, Until Dawn, story-based horror  
And honestly? RPGs, retro gems, and anything co-op are my jam  
I’ve got Steam and a game backlog that could crush a small village.

I love good convos, silly group vibes, and deep dives into random topics while we game. I prefer voice chat and Discord works best for me. I also stream sometimes on Twitch, so if you're into that or just like hanging out on mic, we’ll probably click.

I’m very LGBT+ friendly and all about inclusive, positive vibes. You’ll always be safe and welcome here.

Also, I love cats. Like a lot. My cat Artemis is usually nearby when I game, silently judging my gameplay or trying to step on my keyboard.

Looking to meet folks who are 21 or older, any gender welcome, and if you enjoy co-op chaos, spooky games, wholesome nonsense, or just want someone to chill with and talk about life, I’d really love to connect.

Send a message and tell me a little about yourself, your favorite games, or what kind of vibes you're looking for. Let’s actually become friends and not just fade after one session.",2,1750948122.0,GamerPals,2,1.0,False

1ll1ivt,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1ll1ivt/im_not_sure_what_to_do/,I'm not sure what to do,"I (20m) am/was talking to a girl (21f) who I met at work, I have next to no dating experience. It went really well for the first 2 weeks or so, we were texting often and we went on 2 dates, after the second date i felt it died down a bit, we would still text and call but she'd reply less and less, we kept talking for another 2 weeks after this and she said that she was just busy with exams, I kept texting her as though nothing was wrong but I could tell she was replying less, naturally l'd assume she'd lost interest but she was saying goodnight and sending hearts and telling me to drive safely and let her know when I got home. She kept saying she was busy when I'd ask to meet but would suggest a different day instead, we finally found one that suited both of us but she cancelled the night the night before.  
We slowly started texting less and less and I brought it up while we were on call, I said I felt like we weren't talking as much and wanted to check we were still on the same page about things and she promised she was still interested and that she was just stressed with exams and her parents(being Asian - her words) were being funny about her going out etc etc. 2 days after this, she just completely ghosted me.  
She would completely ignore me at work, talking to people around me, not looking at me at all. I was upset about this because she was treating me as though she hated me when I was nothing but nice to her.  
A bunch of people from work told me she'd been seeing another guy. I sent her one last message saying that I wouldn't have been mad if she was seeing someone else or if she'd lost interest but just if we could be civil at work so it wasn't so awkward. She ignored it.  
A month later, (the day her exams finished) she messaged me out of nowhere saying that she was really sorry about how she treated me and that I should be with someone who was more available, she said that she dealt with it terribly and she was just super stressed out and just shutdown. She said that she didn't lose interest and that she wasn't talking to anyone else. She said that missed me and hoped she'd see me soon, she ended the message with a ""goodnight «3"".  
I replied to this and said I was sorry if I wasn't giving her enough space and that l'd like it if we could try again but not mention it to anyone from work as they were unhelpful and were making me overthink more etc. I also told her l'd bought a new car and l'd like to show her it at some point.  
She acknowledged she'd read what I said but didn't give any meaningful reply, just asked about my car and we spoke for a few minutes before she stopped replying again.  
We spoke a few times at work and it seemed ok, but she still wasn't replying to me, l asked her if we could meet for a coffee and talk properly and she didn't reply to that either.  
I told her that if she couldn't find the time to have a proper talk about it that it might be best for us to part ways. And she replied saying that she meant that she missed me ""as a friend"" because people at work were making her feel uncomfortable (some of the comments people would make were disgusting and even made me feel uncomfortable).  
I said that was fine and now she's gone back to flirting with me, initiating conversations, texting me first to ask about my day, she made comments about how she'd give me ""story time"" about something when she came to see my car etc. and now hasn't replied for 2 days again.  
I'm not sure what to do and I feel really confused, she seems to shutdown/glaze over any attempt to actually talk about what's going on between us. She says one thing and does the complete opposite. I really like her, she's really nice and pretty, she's so kind and I love the time we spend together when we do, she's kinda weird but in a good way, in the same way as me.  
I don't want to just leave it incase she's interested but just scared or something. I'm just really confused and scared that l've fucked it up.I've never had a proper relationship and I'm starting to get a bit fed up, it always ends in the same way and I'm not sure what I'm doing .

I finally made my APAP work after tweaking it sporadically for a year.

I feel like i've ""woken up emotionally"" from a bad dream so to speak i've been in for 10 years, reality feels like it's in HD and it's honestly quite overwhelming, in a good way but still a wild experience.

Is this normal?

I feel like i've gone from *""manic fight or flight with 10 cups of coffee to just be awake""* to a calm state of mind that's foreign to me, almost a bit trippy.

It feels like my body can ""finally relax"" after being completely wrecked - so i've not been able to work much this week paradoxically.

Is this a pattern anyone else has been seeing when they finally start to recover?

My gut's telling me my body is finally able to actually ""recover/heal/rebuild"" at night so it's telling me to relax because it has a lot of repairing to do?

***Details:*** Turns out I have UARS mixed with some OSA. My test AHI bounces around between 9-17 (which apparently can swing much), but here's the weird part - I only actually need 7-10 pressure on my machine. Once I dialed it back to that range - suddenly I'm getting 1-2 hours of deep sleep with ahi of 1.5 at max according to my Lowenstein Prisma (planning to upgrade to a BiLevel soon). Before this i was getting 0-10 minutes of deep sleep per WEEK.  I felt like a zombie. Turns out anything over 10 pressure was actually waking me up, and most of my deep sleep happens at 7-9. It's wild how much finding the right pressure matters! I was convinced I needed higher pressure, but that just kept waking me up and somehow caused flow limitations. Too low and I can't breathe right.

1ll1dut,https://www.reddit.com/r/nespresso/comments/1ll1dut/smartpodz_review/,SmartPodz Review,"Recently got the Podz, and while I wanted to like them, they have issues. First, they are heavy and do not take the Nespresso coffee doses. Nespresso double espresso and lungo take 10.5 grams and the cafe takes 13 grams. The max that can fit in a podz is 10 grams. The biggest issue here is that you need to tamp the coffee hard, like a real espresso to get the 10g to fit. The real Nespresso pods have loose coffee and it flows easily during brewing. This heavy packing seems to affect the machine with red light errors and not as much coffee coming out at times. With the heavy steel podz, this weight and compaction must impact machine longevity. The company says to add 10g for all recipes, while this is close for a double espresso and a lungo and those taste good, it makes a very weak 7.7 oz coffee. Also, while you can ask online questions, the responses are AI generated that repeats your wording and really does not answer your questions. When I asked about machine longevity, the response said my question world be forwarded to a human.  To date, I've had no response from the company beyond the AI emails. As noted in other reviews, there is also no return or refund policy because ""it is a food product"" and their return policy on their website states that there is no support for anything other than shipping issues.

**All feedback on tunes is appreciated - good or bad. Specially when tunes are bad.** At the end of the day I am just the mechanic and you guys are the racers. Do not hesitate irrespective of your tuning knowledge or racing skills!

**Tuning method:**
1. **Stock look - stock wheel rims and size, no aero (unless absolutely necessary for handling and stability)**
2. Tuned for automatic/manual players by not skipping clutch+gearbox upgrades
3. Max performance with max handling possible
4. All cars **tuned vs. Unbeatable AI**, tracks/weather conditions are now unknown since time travel no longer works. Since release AI has been inconsistent between many car types and weather conditions, not every car will win 10/10 races vs Unbeatable AI without rewind/restart abuse
5. Bodykit used if it does not hurt performance

Long story short, I have a relative who is kinda a compulsive buyer of stuff.

There are about 40ish pods in a variety of flavors, so DM me if you want them and I’ll meet ya somewhere and give them to you. I don’t want anything for them since I didn’t pay anything for them.

However, after the last adjustment, I keep feeling this popping in two of the veneers. It doesn't hurt, it is just weird. It is happening when I am eating, chewing and swallowing. Sometimes I taste a bit of blood, but it goes away quickly (just 2 times). I asked my dentist but he advised that I have nothing to worry about. I am still worried though. Should I seek a second opinion? Is this normal ?
I drink coffee and sometimes alcohol, but I do not smoke.

1ll1c01,https://v.redd.it/wf2xl3ly5a9f1,💡 Assistive tech from the ground up – open-source magnetic crutch holder,"Hi all,  
I wanted to share a small but meaningful project we've been working on — it's called **CrutchAttach, a magnetic adapter for forearm crutches that lets users snap them together**, freeing one hand for tasks like holding a stair rail, grabbing coffee, or opening doors.

We developed it with a friend who uses crutches daily, and after 26+ iterations, it’s fully open-source and tested by real users. You can print it on most FDM printers with basic materials.

1ll1b2x,https://www.reddit.com/r/uberdrivers/comments/1ll1b2x/driving_for_uber_uk_in_2025_still_worth_it/,Driving for Uber UK in 2025 still worth it?,"Uber in London is a hard grind. After expenses you will be looking at close to minimum wage (holiday pay included). You have to work during peak hours in Europe’s most congested city. You need to work mornings, evenings, and on weekends in order to make it profitable. So basically, you will always be working when your friends and family have time off, which is a real relationship and social connection killer, which is a long-term mental health hazard. What people also don’t realise is that its physically unhealthy as you are continuously inhaling car fumes. All for very close to the national minimum wage.

Insurance alone is over 5k for the first year, as Uber has monopolised which companies you are allowed to use for driving in London. It’s about 5 providers, obviously Uber taking a nice cut there too. Then add vehicle depreciation, maintenance, fuel and food. Over the past months I have worked in London about £20 per hour is realistic, but before any taxes and all expenses, so close to minimum wage.

But what bugs me most is how poorly Uber treats their drivers. No sick pay, unless you are dying, even then you only get a few months, and no toilets or infrastructure for their employees to rest. If you want a good idea of uber treats their drivers, go to the busiest place for their employees in the UK, which is London Heathrow drivers waiting area. Here hundreds of drivers wait every day for airport trips. It looks like one of those post-apocalyptic street scenes from movies. A few rusty trailers in a fenced in car park with planes flying over your head. No subsidised coffee, no drinking water dispensers. But by far the worst thing are the toilets. The few provided are in an old rusty trailer badly installed wobbly trailer. When you enter for the first time and stand in line, as of course the demand vastly outstretches the demand, you will be confused about the long dirty wooden poles lined up on the wall leading to the stalls. These are for unclogging the chronically clogged toilets. Apparently, it’s been like this for years. Some journalist should really report and publicly shame Uber for this.

What you need to understand is that Uber is run by greedy venture capitalist, who have no ethical consideration for their drivers, maximise shareholder dividends while simultaneously squeezing out as much money out of their drivers and customers as possible. It's a seriously unethical company to work for. If the minimum wage thing has not put you off and how poorly they provide for their employees, you should take a hard look if working for a company that has a business plan to make all its drivers redundant, by heavily investing into self-driving taxis.

And for hard evidence, recent academic studies have shown how Uber is increasing its own profits, while cutting driver’s earnings and increasing customer fare prices. Search for a study by Oxford University, Columbia Business school and an article by the Guardian on this.

If you are really desperate for cash and can cope with having no life while working super hard for a couple of years you can do it. But also, be realistic, working 10h every day in such an environment will come at a physical and mental health cost and is really not sustainable.

Uber is basically a dead end.

PS: Can somebody please create an employee-owned Uber clone where all drivers and IT staff are the majority shareholders?

But I don’t care about that, and it doesn’t bother me.

I've been going to the library for the past six months to prepare for my exams. Whenever I sit near a woman in an available seat, she moves away. It's happened so many times, and honestly, it really feels humiliating.

It’s not just in the library—I’ve felt this in coffee shops, restaurants, temples, and other public places too.

 You might wonder if I’m just imagining it, but I’ve paid close attention. When other men, even strangers, sit near them, the girls stay. But when I do, they move away.

I don’t even like talking to them, and I never try to approach anyone. I just want to sit in an available spot and focus on my work.

Is there something I should change about my personality or body language?

Note: Please don’t say things like ‘Maybe you r  ugly,’ ‘You probably have body odor,’ or ‘You might be obese or' you might be creepy.'

1ll1aj4,https://v.redd.it/4nn6miews99f1,Spent way too long making a 20-minute pop culture reference rundown of The Office. Here’s the first 8 minutes  (link to full video below),"Apparently 20 minutes is too long for Reddit, but luckily YouTube came down to tape it:  
[**FULL VERSION WITH TIMESTAMPS**](https://youtu.be/I9KcZRRf9KY)

People who spend way too much time on Reddit may know that this is actually the third edition of this rundown ([first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DunderMifflin/comments/qjozfg/i_made_a_supercut_of_30_movie_and_tv_references/?share_id=6QHWWc6FYTAYeJ5PBcunY&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_source=share&utm_term=1) \- [second post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DunderMifflin/s/caTPVbZunM)). Every time I think I’m out, you pull me back in with new suggestions.

Does it include *every* pop culture reference from *The Office*? Not even close. Feel free to comment what I missed, but I’m definitely not making another one. It’s already way longer than it needs to be.

(Side note: I wasn’t able to find the original “that’s what she said” line, supposedly from Chevy Chase on *Weekend Update*. I checked all the subtitle files from those early seasons of *SNL*, but no luck.)

If, for some bizarre reason, you still haven’t quenched your thirst for references after this, check out [The Office Time Machine](http://theofficetimemachine.com/). A pretty crazy project by [Joe Sabia](http://www.joesabia.co). I wouldn’t have been able to make this video without it.

I didn’t count the hours I spent editing this, but if it dies in New, I will burn Utica to the ground.

I know this style of editing isn’t for everyone. At first I wanted to do it more like [this similar Seinfeld video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFuBaRiKwD4), but I got carried away trying to cram as many references as possible into as little time as possible.

Below is the full rundown. There’s no real logical order, mostly because I added all the new references at the beginning, so people who saw the second edition don’t necessarily have to rewatch the whole thing. The Spanish Inquisition is the only one I spliced in at the end iirc. Because, well… no one expects it.

Hormone balance plays a crucial role in weight loss, significantly affecting our metabolism, appetite, and body composition. An imbalance often arises from stress, leading to the secretion of cortisol, which can hinder our weight loss efforts. Therefore, exploring quick stress-reducing elixirs can be an effective way to promote hormonal harmony.

One of the most beneficial elixirs is a herbal tea blend. Ingredients such as ashwagandha, known for its adaptogenic properties, help decrease stress levels and restore hormone balance. Adding a touch of honey for sweetness and lemon for detoxification makes a comforting drink that supports well-being.

Green smoothies can also work wonders. Combining spinach, avocado, and banana with almond milk creates a nutrient-packed elixir that stabilizes blood sugar and promotes insulin sensitivity, vital for weight management. The fiber content in these smoothies further aids digestion and keeps hunger at bay.

Another quick elixir is a coconut water and ginger concoction. Coconut water is hydrating and rich in electrolytes, while ginger helps reduce inflammation and supports digestive health. This combination can soothe the stomach and promote hormonal balance, thus enhancing your weight loss journey.

Lastly, integrating adaptogenic tonics such as reishi or lion’s mane mushrooms into your routine may support your body’s stress response. These tonics can be mixed into coffee or hot chocolate, offering a delicious way to nourish hormonal health.

Incorporating these stress-reducing elixirs into your daily routine can set the stage for better hormone balance and successful weight loss. By addressing stress, you not only improve your overall well-being but also create an optimal environment for achieving your weight loss goals.

**I (20m) am Not sure what to do about this girl(21m), Do you think I'm better off just to leave it?**

I (20m) am/was talking to a girl (21f) who I met at work, I have next to no dating experience. It went really well for the first 2 weeks or so, we were texting often and we went on 2 dates, after the second date i felt it died down a bit, we would still text and call but she'd reply less and less, we kept talking for another 2 weeks after this and she said that she was just busy with exams, I kept texting her as though nothing was wrong but I could tell she was replying less, naturally l'd assume she'd lost interest but she was saying goodnight and sending hearts and telling me to drive safely and let her know when I got home. She kept saying she was busy when I'd ask to meet but would suggest a different day instead, we finally found one that suited both of us but she cancelled the night the night before.  
We slowly started texting less and less and I brought it up while we were on call, I said I felt like we weren't talking as much and wanted to check we were still on the same page about things and she promised she was still interested and that she was just stressed with exams and her parents(being Asian - her words) were being funny about her going out etc etc. 2 days after this, she just completely ghosted me.  
She would completely ignore me at work, talking to people around me, not looking at me at all. I was upset about this because she was treating me as though she hated me when I was nothing but nice to her.  
A bunch of people from work told me she'd been seeing another guy. I sent her one last message saying that I wouldn't have been mad if she was seeing someone else or if she'd lost interest but just if we could be civil at work so it wasn't so awkward. She ignored it.  
A month later, (the day her exams finished) she messaged me out of nowhere saying that she was really sorry about how she treated me and that I should be with someone who was more available, she said that she dealt with it terribly and she was just super stressed out and just shutdown. She said that she didn't lose interest and that she wasn't talking to anyone else. She said that missed me and hoped she'd see me soon, she ended the message with a ""goodnight «3"".  
I replied to this and said I was sorry if I wasn't giving her enough space and that l'd like it if we could try again but not mention it to anyone from work as they were unhelpful and were making me overthink more etc. I also told her l'd bought a new car and l'd like to show her it at some point.  
She acknowledged she'd read what I said but didn't give any meaningful reply, just asked about my car and we spoke for a few minutes before she stopped replying again.  
We spoke a few times at work and it seemed ok, but she still wasn't replying to me, l asked her if we could meet for a coffee and talk properly and she didn't reply to that either.  
I told her that if she couldn't find the time to have a proper talk about it that it might be best for us to part ways. And she replied saying that she meant that she missed me ""as a friend"" because people at work were making her feel uncomfortable (some of the comments people would make were disgusting and even made me feel uncomfortable).  
I said that was fine and now she's gone back to flirting with me, initiating conversations, texting me first to ask about my day, she made comments about how she'd give me ""story time"" about something when she came to see my car etc. and now hasn't replied for 2 days again.  
I'm not sure what to do and I feel really confused, she seems to shutdown/glaze over any attempt to actually talk about what's going on between us. She says one thing and does the complete opposite. I really like her, she's really nice and pretty, she's so kind and I love the time we spend together when we do, she's kinda weird but in a good way, in the same way as me.  
I don't want to just leave it incase she's interested but just scared or something. I'm just really confused and scared that l've fucked it up.I've never had a proper relationship and I'm starting to get a bit fed up, it always ends in the same way and I'm not sure what I'm doing .",1,1750947398.0,relationship_advice,2,0.67,False

Yan Liang first saw the part of the hand from the wrist to the elbow exposed under folded sleeves of the shirt. It was a lean arm, a watch on the wrist............","Chapter 1 : Two years ago

In the clear sky, a large passenger aircraft was flying smoothly, leaving a jetstream of white in the clear blue sky.

Outside, the sun was intense,Yan Liang pulled the shade down and continued to work on the file on the tray table.

It was lunch time and the flight attendants were catering to the guests

The catering car came to her side, the flight attendant bent over to put her knife and fork on the table, but seeing the table filled with files, stopped, perplexed.

Yan Liang put down the pen, lifted her head to look at the flight attendant: “I only need a cup of coffee, thank you.”

The stewardess nodded with a smile, poured the coffee and handed her the cup.

As Yan Liang tried to take the cup, the flight suddenly hit an air pocket.

The stewardess immediately tried to steady the cup, but the coffee spilled all over the files.

Yan Liang quickly reached out to protect her files in the ensuing chaos. Her quick thinking saved her files, but her skirt was stained by the coffee.

“I’m sorry! Sorry!” the stewardess hurriedly handed her a paper towel.

At this time the captain also broadcasted the notice: “We encountered a brief turbulence, we request the passengers to wear their seat belts.”

Yan Liang hurriedly blotted the coffee on the files. Seeing a few of her documents had fallen to the the aisle, Yan Liang put her cup on the table, took off her seat belt and got up to pick up the documents.

As she bent to pick up the file, a hand extended the files to her. The hand belonged to the passenger sitting behind her.

Yan Liang first saw the part of the hand from the wrist to the elbow exposed under folded sleeves of the shirt. It was a lean arm, a watch on the wrist, the fingers slender. She reached for the file to say thank you, but as she moved her eyes up she was shocked.

As her eyes moved along the man’s arm up to see the man’s face, she clearly saw him quickly reading her file.

He was sitting, Yan Liang was standing, from her vantage point, although she couldn’t see the whole face of this person, she could clearly see him stare at the file with two sharp abnormal eyes.

Inexplicably she felt so cold she coughed drily, waving her hands signalling him to handover the file and then in a deliberately strident tone to remind him “Thank you .”

The man looked up.

Far more than sharp eyes, his eyes were simply …… as dominant as in the eagle –

which is the only feeling Yan Liang had when her eyes met his.

But then, those sharp eyes softened, he smiled, and handed back the file.

Yan Liang quickly returned to her seat, put the file back. Curious, she could not help but look back again. At this time, the passenger behind was dining. He simply looked like a handsome stranger.

Was it just her illusion? Yan Liang shook her head.

\*\*\*

Three hours later the plane landed, the journey across the ocean was finally over.

Yan Liang walked towards the baggage claim. Red lips, expressionless face, black high heels hitting the marble floor with a “da da” sound, a stylish dress but stained with coffee stains made her feel slightly embarrassed

As Yan Liang waited for her luggage, she intended to to go to the bathroom to change her clothes, but she was stopped by a a suited gentlemen.

“Hello?” She was not in a hurry.

The man looked questioningly at her face, removed a pair of glasses from his carry on bag: “This is yours, right?”

Yan Liang was stunned.

She carefully looked at the glasses, they were hers.

“I found it on the plane.”

Yan Liang’s glasses do not have a high power, she only wears it during office hours. After the lunch episode, she did not look at the file, so she actually did not realise when the glasses were lost.

Yan Liang smiled, and as she reached out to take the glasses quickly, she noticed there was a business card with the glasses.

“Not surprising,then, we will soon meet again.”

Yan Liang just wanted to leave as soon as possible. She did not take too much notice of this strange man’s strange comment. She took the card, with a sidelong glance, she nodded slightly to show goodbye and hastily left, leaving the man standing and stammering behind her.

And she walked out of the International Arrivals towards the door, she dropped the business card in the trash bin on her way.

As she dropped the business cards, her ears heard a familiar voice: “Yan Liang!”

Yan Liang stopped.

Looking to where the sound came from, she saw the door being pushed.

He waved at her, closely cropped hair, a competent smile.

Finally there was a trace of emotion in her face “ I am so honoured, are you so tired of your manager that you came to personally pick me up?”

He gave her a helpless smile in exchange to her ridicule: “A year has gone by, but your words have become more and more sharp..”

“A year has gone by, but you have become more and more handsome”,she answered.

Sunny weather, bright eyes, the man’s smile was warmer than the sun . Yan Liang looked away to eliminate her heart of evil thoughts: “What happened to Zhou Shu? He is usually responsible for picking me up.”

“My father drove Xi Ziqing’s mother to the hospital to see your father, and I was on leave today, so I decided to replace my dad to be your driver for the day .” Taking her luggage, he walked towards the parking lot.

Not far from the parking lot, a luxury car was parked quietly, the window glass and the eyes of the man sitting in the back seat both black as ink.

He was looking out of the window, his gaze lazy, but eyes predatory like an eagle, one hand supporting his chin on the edge of the window, his face cold.

The man who was with Yan Liang before approached the car from the other side ,opened the door and sat in the car. Turning back , he said to the man in the back seat:: “Mr. Jiang, I have something for you.”

Mr Jiang nodded silently , gazed out out of the window to see Yan Liang and her companion get into the another car not far away then softly ordered the driver:. “Drive.”

\*\*\*

Zhou Cheng started the car, asked her: “What about the company ‘s operating data I sent you?”

“I was reading it on the plane , almost finished.”

“Now the company is very chaotic, you have to get to know these things as soon as possible. Do you want to go home or go directly to the hospital to visit Father?”

Yan Liang was seated in the co – pilot seat, the sun was shielded by the window, her expression turned negative: “How is my dad now ?”

“Last week he had a stroke, he has been in hospital since then, now the situation is fairly stable.”

Zhou Cheng accelerated , it seemed that this is an important thing to think about, through the rearview mirror he looked at Yan Liang before continuing: “Your sister is also in the hospital.”.

He looked at her, she looked upset, he silently turned around and said.”Do not think about her anymore, all right, look at my face.”

Yan Liang smiled, but her eyes were unsmiling:. “Zhou Cheng, Xu Ziqing\* is a goddess in your eyes, but she is just a weed in my eyes ……”

\*google translates this name as Fu Jian school. I am just keeping this as Xu Ziqing based on my later reads

Yan Liang chose to go home, rather than go to the hospital as she really wanted to avoid any family conflicts.

A ten hour flight where she spent most of her time to review the files, she was tired enough. Now after a comfortable bath, she was lying on the couch watching TV, finally feeling a little cozy.

Yan Liang was changing channels rapidly, when she stopped at a local station, saw the advertisement for a new product and then changed to the local news channel.

The anchor was saying “..has developed high-end skin care brands such as Xu’s dream, however in recent years their position is no longer the same. Now with the chairman Xu Jinfu suffering a stroke and admitted to the hospital, the company is in a difficult situation. Informed sources say Xu Jinfu has approached a headhunting company to look for appropriate management personnel. He intends to change the management to professional managers and break the usual family business model. Xu … … ”

Yan Liang stared at the TV with a frown. Suddenly she heard the sound of the door opening and she immediately changed to an entertainment channel.

Lazily lying on the sofa, she lifted her head to see a woman opening the door: “Mom.”

Yan Mu looked at Yan Liang lazing like this, immediately her face sank.

“Even Zhou Cheng knows enough to go to the hospital to visit your father, you skip, you return to home to hide here and watch these -” Yan Mu glanced at the chatter of the television program, “- you’re making a mess of things.”

Yan Liang simply turned off the TV, got up and put on her slippers, and poured a glass of water for her mother: “Aren’t you most annoyed to see the mother of Xu Ziqing? When I heard from Zhou Cheng that she and her mother were in the hospital, I thought since they are there, you will certainly not step into the hospital.”

“You do not know your father darling. I sent you to go abroad to study for an MBA degree so you can inherit the company, and now, with your dad’s stroke, the company is in this chaotic set and directly appointed Xu Ziqing in the management layer. That’s why I told you to return home immediately. In the present situation, it is likely that those who express filial piety, your dad is ready to help them.And you do not even go to the hospital to see your dad? When the company falls into the hands of Xu Ziqing and her mother, you will regret it.

“You are right! You have thought it out well!” Yan Liang, pushed her mother out of the bedroom. “Liang Yi made some stew soup, do you want your daughter to accompany you while you have some soup downstairs?”

“Don’t pretend you care about me; if you really don’t want to see me worry, you quickly get started with the company’s things, so people don’t think of me as a joke who did not fight that wild woman and let the illegitimate daughter take over.”How will I save face?”

“You tell me what I have to do, go to the head office, right?” Yan Liang said, finally getting a word in.

Finally, nobody had the cold soup, the soup was sent directly to the poor and they went to the hospital.

This was a premium ward; the corridor decoration was like a five-star hotel. As Yan Liang stepped out of the elevator, she saw Zhou Cheng leaning on the rails. She stepped forward and patted his shoulder.

Zhou Cheng raised his head, saw her, and was surprised: “Did you not say that today you won’t come to the hospital?”

Yan Liang could only reluctantly shrug: “Why are you outside in the corridor?”

“Father is talking to the head hunter company inside. He is interested in meeting with the professional managers, let us avoid.”

“For what role?”

Zhou Cheng secretly said: “Powerful role.”

Yan Liang thought back to the news she saw at home: professional managers, family business model to change … … all kinds of unfavorable news that she secretly speculated for a moment, before she calmly changed the topic: “Where is Xu Ziqing?”

“She is sending her mother to the car downstairs; she will come back in a little while.”

Seeing Yan Liang’s expression, he sang the old tune: “Yan Liang, do not target her, ok?”

Cheerfully regaining her composure, she said contemptuously: “Why do you all think I am against her, rather than she against me?”

Without waiting for him to say another word, Yan Liang took a U-turn and left.

She heard him call out to her, but she didnt stop.

Unfortunately, Yan Liang did not think she was going to hit the elevator just when Xu Ziqing was returning.

As the elevator doors opened, the two women were face to face, both surprised for a moment.

Xu Ziying was the first one to react.Stepping out of the elevator, she immediately looked up and down at Yan Liang: “How come you’re here? Willing to come back?”

“You are not qualified to speak to me in this tone.”

“Last year, you did not come home, and now that there’s a mess at home you have to come back immediately, it is hard not to think of you as taking advantage of the chaos selfishly.”

Yan Liang tried to move around her, but was stopped: “Why are you leaving now?”

“If you do not want me to slap you like I did last time, let me go now.”

Xu Ziqing smiled: “You can’t say I forgot, I’d really like to thank you for that slap, if not , how could I cry to father and get so many shares?

Yan Liang was unable to suppress her anger as her teeth clenched.

“You do not know how angry your mother was then. She was willing to let my mother in because of the agreement: I can not compete for shares with you, but you, with a slap you destroyed so many years of your mother’s effort. If I were her, I would be mad at you too. ”

Yan Liang laughed. Xu Ziying’s expression changed, Yan Liang’s laugh was almost domineering: “Do you not know, that a man’s child will always have a natural psychological advantage? He owes you so much, he cannot even legally acknowledge your mother. When you go home with your mother every year to visit relatives, are you not being pointed at? I absolutely agree about the monetary compensation. What did he feel for you, if not pity?”

Xu Ziqing eyes blazed with anger showing that Yan Liang’s words had hit their mark.

But in the next second, Yan Liang could not laugh anymore –

“Speaking of, I have something to tell you .Zhou Cheng- he proposed to me,”

At that moment, Yan Liang felt her hands turn cold.

Xu Ziqing haughtily said: “But you can rest assured, I will not promise him, of course, I will not accept him. This man hurt my sister’s heart so I strung him along for a long time, don’t you feel better? ”

Yan Liang finally did not hold back, the palm of your hand was raised.

Zhou Cheng is her Achilles heel … …

But this slap, ultimately failed to land on the face of innocent Xu Ziqing -Yan Liang’s wrist was grabbed. She was surprised to see the hand that grabbed her wrist.

Lean arms ,wearing a watch, she had a feeling of deja vu.

Yan Liang suddenly raised her head – her eyes landed on a pair of familiar eyes.

The man she met on the plane, the man who had a pair of memorable eyes.

Translator’s note: I realised that what I mentioned as Fu Jiang in Chapter 1.2 is actually Xu Ziqing, I have changed that. Apologies.

If you are enjoying this novel, may I ask you to move to novel updates where the link goes to my website. If you read it on the other sites that don’t direct you to mine, I won’t know you are reading it, and may well give up translating because I think nobody is interested ????

Yan Liang tried several times to pull her hand back but failed, the man seemed to have a lazy attitude, but in reality he had great strength.

In any case, Yan Liang could not shake him off, and ultimately could only glare at him: “Let go.”

He just smiled: ” Such brutish behaviour isn’t beautiful .”

“None of your business.”

“You destroyed my good impression of you before, how is this nothing to do with me?”

This man sounded very sincere, but his whole body emitted an aura that was at odds with his voice.

Yan Liang was momentarily speechless, vaguely she was able to hear other footsteps coming near; she was still looking at the face. Her efforts to struggle could not help but bring them close .He seemed to realise this and loosened his grip on her hand.

Footsteps getting closer, Yan Liang looked up to see the person who was coming this way. Looking at him, her eyes widened, her teeth clenched.

Zhou Cheng entered the elevator to see the three were at a stalemate, hesitated, then came forward: “Mr. Jiang, I will accompany you down stairs.”

He looked indifferently as if he was a stranger, his indifference almost carried a hint of contempt: “No, thank you”.

With his head down, he stepped into the elevator, but stopped in the middle and turned back.

He looked at her eyes glaring at him, and inexplicably she felt a chill in her heart.

“Goodbye, rude lady.”

Yan Liang was unable to hold back her angry stare.

At the moment, seeing this, Xu Ziying laughed. Trying to fake consideration, she said: “Yan Liang, you do not have to go with me to see father.”

Yan Liang look at her coldly, turned around and walked towards the ward.

Xu Ziqing stayed in place, but shrugged, and walked towards the same direction.

Zhou Cheng also realised he couldn’t do anything about the strange atmosphere, only patted Xu Ziying’s shoulder to show comfort.

But Xu Ziying looked at the elevator until the elevator door closed. Only then with a strange look she asked Zhou Cheng: “Who is he?”

“…”

“…”

“Jiang Yu Nan.”

Xu Ziqing was immediately stunned.

Yan Liang was about to turn to the elevator when she heard that ,her rapid footsteps also suddenly stopped.

Jiang Yu Nan ……

He was actually Jiang Yu Nan.

Yan Liang was no stranger to the name.

Jiang Yu Nan had served as the Asia Pacific Regional Manager with an international brand before. In two or three years, he had managed to enhance the performance of the region so that sales had doubled, and created a special line for Asian skin. The brand was very popular and become another cash cow for the Corporation.

Is father interested in poaching him as a CEO?

Yan Mu soon heard the news. At the evening meal at home, she was very anxious to ask Yan Liang the details.

Yan Liang buried her head down to eat, she did not want to raise her head. Only vaguely she said: “I only know that he deliberately went to the hospital today to visit the Father, I do not know anything else.”

Yan Mu stopped eating: “If that is so, then how will you fight him?”

“It’s a wise decision for the future of the company, and I feel fine.”

Yan Mu immediately banged down her chopsticks on the table, the sound especially loud.

“What’s with your attitude? Your dad is putting someone over your head for vested interests, how are you not anxious?”

Yan Liang kept her head down; she did not dare to refute her mother’s words.

Yan Mu could see their own benefits so much, but her daughter did not look like she had the heart, she could only direct: “In short, in next Monday’s provisional shareholders meeting, I will take you to Chen Shu, you must oppose this resolution.”

“…”

“Did you not hear me?”

Yan Liang, for no reason, suddenly recalled the image of a pair of eagle like sharp eyes, she tried to dislodge the image from her head. She put down the chopsticks and got up: “I ‘m full.”

Yan Liang was in a complex mood as she participated in the shareholders meeting a few days later.

In order for Father to implement this decision, the shareholders quarrelled, many opposing the decision as they feared for their vested interests if the family management system that was running the company so long was removed

Some people were still sitting on the fence: “Jiang Yu Nan Xu has not yet agreed to the invitation, all this discussion is premature.”

Chen Shu has always been firmly opposed to the decision. And this shareholders meeting, in fact, he was opposed to the attitude of private shareholders together to discuss how to stop the matter coming true.

Chen Shu just put the views to the body, asked: “Yan Liang, what do you think?”

The company’s old shareholders had seen Yan Liang grow up; she had inherited the company’s most orthodox candidates. For the moment they looked at her eyes and calmed down.

Yan Liang faced a dilemma between her inclination and her mother’s will: “I … …”

She had barely spoken when the conference room door was suddenly opened –

the people suspiciously turned to look.

They saw Xu Ziqing pushing a wheelchair and come in. Sitting on the wheelchair was Xu Jinfu .He was looking pretty good.

Yan Liang was also very surprised; she stood up: “Dad.”

Xu Ziqing pushed the wheelchair near the chairman’s seat, Xu Jinfu looked around, slowly saying: “Are you not surprised to see me here?”

Xu Jinfu still had a slight lisp, but his words were quite clear.

The shareholders present had different expressions, as if they had seen a ghost, but no one dared to utter a sound.

Xu Jinfu’s eyes went round the conference table, and ultimately looked with disappointment at Yan Liang: “I’m not dead, and you are already keeping me away and calling a general meeting of shareholders. When I finally die, wont my company be carved up by you?”

Though Xu Jinfu experienced a serious illness, everyone was shocked at his words ,their faces turning white. Xu Jinfu said: “The meeting is over, you can go.” Several shareholders looked at each other, they got up to leave.

Yan Liang got up to leave as well, when her father added: “Yan Liang, you stay.”

Yan Liang glanced at her father and Xu Ziqing behind him. She saw her own father’s look of contempt, and feeling both helpless and angry she said: “I did not intend to participate … …”

Xu Ziqing interrupted Yan Liang: “You do not say a word, do not provoke Dad.”

Still not giving Yan Liang a chance to retort,Xu Ziqing poured a glass of water on the table for her father, she seemed to try to calm his sullen temper : “Dad, don’t be angry, Yan Liang is still young, it is understood that the uncles said a few things, they are afraid of their own interests before the damage … … ”

Obviously, the words of Xu Ziqing were counterproductive –

Xu Jinfu waved his arm ,knocking down the cup of water

Yan Liang was splashed with the hot water.

Yan Liang, not for the first time, admired her half-sister. She had even managed to prepare this cup of hot water in advance for her … …

“Young is not an excuse! Why can you not learn from your sister … …”

Yan Liang bowed her head down to see her white clothes had been soaked in water and were now semi-transparent. She surprised herself, and laughed out, “You’ve never heard my side of the story, but I’m used to it.”

Having said that, she turned around and left.

As she walked out of the conference room, she could feel the people around staring at her and her awkward state.

Yan Liang walked rapidly towards the elevator. The hot water was cooling on her dress. Her heart, too, felt more and more cold. Cold, but she was through.

You have let me down completely……

At this time, she realised her arm had a red hot blister from the hot water, her clothes were drenched, her underwear clearly visible … … suddenly a strong sense of helplessness overtook her; she did not know what to do.

Yan Liang was rooted to the spot.

As the surrounding noise become more and more lively, she felt more and more small. She should leave. Suddenly, she felt something heavy on her shoulder.
