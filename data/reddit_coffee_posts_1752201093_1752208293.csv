# Chapter 1

Rain smacked the windshield, like someone spilled a bucket of marbles.

The wipers struggled frantically, but couldn't make a dent in the crazy downpour.

I sat in the passenger seat, twisting my seatbelt around my finger. The rain turned the world outside into a blurry watercolor, but I couldn't stop staring.

""Liam, are you sure about this?"" My voice sounded tight in the closed space. ""If you pull out now, the company will immediately plunge into a liquidity crisis.""

Liam's face looked chiseled from ice in the dashboard's blue glow.

His slender fingers drummed an impatient rhythm on the steering wheel.

""Chloe, I told you, it's risk management,"" he said, his voice eerily calm. ""Market's tanked. We need to cut losses before it's too late.""

I turned to lock eyes with him. ""But this is our life's work! Five years, since college—we built this from scratch. How can you just throw it away?""

A lightning bolt sliced through the night, briefly highlighting Liam's clenched jaw. Just then, his phone rang.

The caller ID simply read: \[Margie\].

Instantly, Liam's expression changed. He snatched up the call, his voice going all soft. ""What's up?""

A woman's voice mumbled through the speaker—I couldn't make out words, but every second, Liam's frown got deeper.

""Alright, I'll be right there."" He hung up, hit the turn signal, and jerked the wheel sharply onto another road.

""Liam? Where are we heading? We didn't finish talking—""

""Margaret's in trouble,"" he said curtly and stomped on the gas.

My heart clenched as if an invisible hand was squeezing it.

Margaret Smith was Liam's college sweetheart, the eternally pure and perfect first love he could never forget.

Ever since she came back half a year ago, she'd been the trigger for endless arguments between Liam and me.

""What's so urgent?"" I struggled to keep my voice even. ""It's pouring outside, and we were in the middle of a major talk.""

Liam didn't even glance at me. ""She's home alone with a 102-degree fever. Chloe, stop being unreasonable.""

Unreasonable? My lips parted, but no sound escaped.

The company was on the brink of collapse, and he was rushing off to tend to his ex-girlfriend just because she had a damn fever?

The car screeched to a violent halt at a bus stop.

Liam finally turned to me, his gaze glacial. ""Get out.""

""What?"" I thought I must have misheard.

""Get out,"" he repeated coldly. ""It's close enough to your place. Hail a cab yourself.""

He unlocked the car door, adding, ""Margaret can't wait any longer.""

The rain lashed against the car window, matching the frantic pounding of my heart.

I stared at Liam, the man I'd loved for seven years, utterly stunned. ""Are you serious? There's a freaking storm out there!""

""So what?"" Liam retorted. ""You're a grown woman, Chloe.""

I stared straight into his eyes, hunting for any flicker of regret, but met only glacial indifference.

At that moment, something clicked inside me, but I couldn't quite put it into words.

""Fine,"" I heard myself say, my fingers trembling as they fumbled with the seatbelt. ""You'd do anything for Margaret, right?""

Liam didn't answer.

I pushed the car door open, and the storm slammed into me, soaking half my body in an instant.

Just as I stepped out, his icy voice cut through. ""Take your umbrella.""

He tossed my folding umbrella onto my lap, as if that was the last shred of mercy he could show me.

I stood in the downpour, watching his black Mercedes splash through the puddles and speed off. Its taillights blurred in the rain, then vanished completely.

Water streamed down my hair, mingling with my still-warm tears.

I unfolded the umbrella numbly, only to find myself at a pitch-black street corner.

My phone battery icon flashed red—5% left. I dialed Liam's number, my hands shaking.

""The number you have dialed is busy...""

I took a deep breath and turned toward the main road.

The rain was so heavy that my umbrella might as well have been tissue paper. My clothes clung to me, soaking wet and freezing me to the bone.

Just then, blinding highlights exploded from the corner.

Instinctively, I raised my hand to shield my eyes as the screech of skidding tires pierced the air.

Suddenly, time seemed to slow down. I watched in horror as the out-of-control truck careened toward me, the driver's panicked face clear through the windshield.

Then came the deafening crash of metal on flesh.

Weirdly, I felt no pain.

Instead, I felt weightless, like a feather caught in the wind.

I hovered above, staring down in bewilderment.

There lay a woman, her body contorted at an unnatural angle, crimson blood spreading through the rainwater.

That face...was mine.

Was I dead?

The thought hit me, but strangely, I wasn't panicking.

I watched calmly as the truck driver got out to check, his face deathly pale as he made a call. Then, he jumped back in and fled the scene.

The rain kept pouring, relentlessly washing away ""my"" blood from the pavement.

I floated above my body, feeling this weird sense of peace—at least, Liam would find out...

Just then, the familiar black Mercedes came sliding back.

Liam staggered out and dropped to his knees beside my body.

My chest tightened—he did come back for me.

But the next second, he pulled out his phone. Instead of calling 911, he dialed his lawyer, Henry Chester.

""Henry,"" Liam said, his voice eerily calm. ""Chloe got hit by a car. Yeah, died on the spot. No, I don't know the vehicle. Surveillance? I don't believe there are any cameras in this area.""

I hovered above, watching in horror as he methodically cleaned up the scene with practiced ease.

He even pried the phone from my dead hand and deleted our final call log.

The wail of sirens from police cars and ambulances grew louder as they drew near.

Liam instantly put on a mask of devastating grief, bursting into exaggerated sobs as he cradled my body.

Had I not seen the whole thing, I would never have believed anyone could fake grief so perfectly.

""Oh, Chloe!"" he wailed, his voice all cracked. I floated right in front of him and stared into his eyes—they were bone-dry, not a single tear to be found.

Finally, the rain ceased.

Cold moonlight shone down on my body, and on Liam's trembling back as he kept up the act.

I hovered above this surreal scene. For the first time, I realized I might have never truly known Liam, the guy I spent seven years loving.

# Chapter 2

The day of my funeral broke with a bright morning.

Sunlight streamed through the funeral home's stained-glass windows, dancing across the white roses.

My framed portrait dominated the memorial hall—front and center. It was taken at last year's company gala, where I wore a bright red dress and beamed at the camera.

Beneath it lay a glass casket, and inside rested my meticulously made-up corpse.

Floating above the hall in my ghostly form, I watched everything unfold below, struck by the sheer absurdity of it all.

""Chloe, my baby girl."" Mom collapsed beside the casket. Her gut-wrenching sobs pierced through me like shards of glass.

Dad, his eyes bloodshot, was supporting her. His once-straight back was now hunched, as if he had aged a decade overnight.

I drifted over, reaching out to hug them, but my arms went right through.

""Mom, Dad, I'm right here,"" I called out, but my voice just vanished.

The hall was packed with a steady stream of visitors—my colleagues, college classmates, and distant relatives.

Dressed in black, they walked up to my portrait with solemn faces, put down the white roses, and then offered their condolences to my parents.

Lily from the marketing department wept more bitterly than anyone else.

My best friend, Jessica Lynn, seven months pregnant, sobbed uncontrollably in her husband's arms.

Liam was the one who really stood out.

He stood at the entrance to the memorial hall in his impeccably tailored black suit, greeting each mourner with calculated grace.

His eyes were bloodshot, his face as white as a sheet. His tie hung loosely around his neck, as if grief had drained him of even the strength to straighten himself up.

He responded to each condolence with artfully trembling lips and tearful restraint—a masterclass in feigned grief.

""Mr. Goodman, I'm sorry for your loss.""

""Liam, Chloe wouldn't want to see you like this.""

""Mr. Goodman, the company needs you.""

Liam nodded faintly to each mourner, expressing his thanks in a carefully hoarse voice.

His performance was flawless, if only I didn't already know the monster beneath the mask.

I floated right before him, so close I could count each of his eyelashes.

His eyes were red and swollen, but I knew the truth—he'd been rubbing onions last night. I saw it with my own eyes.

Pretending to bow his head in grief, he quickly stole a glance at his phone's lock screen.

There was a text from Margaret: \[What do you want for dinner? I made you some soup\], with a heart emoji at the end.

The corner of Liam's lips twitched upward almost imperceptibly for a split second before snapping back into his mask of grief.

A bone-chilling terror shot through me, freezing me to the very core.

""Liam Goodman!"" I shrieked, throwing myself at him with all my strength. But I just went right through, almost falling over from the force.

Liam remained still, without so much as a flicker of his lashes.

Soon, the memorial service started.

As my ""fiancé,"" Liam was called upon to deliver the eulogy.

He trudged up to the podium and fished a crumpled piece of paper from his pocket.

He began, his voice trembling, ""Chloe was the most important person in my life.""

The audience erupted in muffled sobs.

I scoffed.

That paper was the business pitch I'd helped him rewrite last month. He'd just grabbed it the last second.

I couldn't know more about the handwriting there.

""We first met on campus in college, and she always had such a radiant smile.""

It was true that we met in college. But back then, he was the one with a bright smile.

That year, he was the student council president, while I headed the arts department.

He played and sang ""Long Live"" at the orientation party, having half the girls swooning—me most of all.

""She was kind-hearted, resilient, and radiated an undying zest for life.""

That part was painfully true.

How kind of me to believe his every word, how strong to endure his never-ending thing with Margaret all these years, and what a zest for life—I couldn't even let my afterlife self rest in peace.

As Liam's eulogy concluded, the entire hall dissolved into sobs.

He staggered off the stage, supported by several colleagues, and slumped into his seat. Bowing his head, he buried his face in his hands, his shoulders shaking.

No one noticed him secretly checking a selfie from Margaret between his fingers—she was wearing my nightgown, posing in our bedroom.

After the funeral, Liam made a show of escorting everyone out.

As soon as the hall cleared, he heaved a long sigh of relief, loosened his tie, and called Margaret.

""Yeah, it's finally over. I'm beat. Of course I miss you."" His voice was light and playful, a stark contrast to his earlier grief. ""I'll be home in twenty. Wear that black lace lingerie for me, okay?""

Numb, I drift after him out of the funeral home and slip into the black Mercedes-Benz.

There was still a faint metallic smell in the car—my blood.

Seemingly oblivious to it all, Liam turned on the stereo and played some upbeat jazz.

The black Mercedes glided into the underground garage of an apartment.

It had been the place we called home. But now, it was a love nest for him and Margaret.

As the elevator climbed, Liam checked his reflection in the mirror, smoothing his hair and even spritzing some breath freshener.

I stood aside, staring at him. Once, I loved him with all my heart, but now all I felt was pure disgust.

The moment the door opened, Margaret threw herself into his arms.

She wore a silk slip dress, her hair cascading in soft waves, looking every bit like a delicate doll.

""Liam."" She tilted her face up, her eyes shimmering with tears. ""Today must have been hard for you, right?""

Liam instantly went all weak and tired-looking. ""Mmm, at least I have you,"" he murmured before lowering his lips to hers.

I turned away sharply. But no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't block out the wet, intimate sounds of their kissing.

My gut twisted with a nausea that shouldn't even exist anymore. I floated to the bedroom to escape, but what I saw there just made my heart ache even more.

All my belongings were gone.

My skincare on the vanity, my favorite aromatherapy diffuser by the bed, and all my clothes in the wardrobe—every last trace of me had been wiped clean.

Instead, there were Margaret's dresses and designer handbags.

Among the paired toothbrushes and towels in the bathroom, none was mine.

Liam embraced Margaret from behind, his chin resting on her shoulder. ""You did a great job cleaning,"" he murmured.

""The cleaning service came today,"" Margaret said softly. ""I had all her belongings packed up and sent to her parents' place. You don't mind, do you?""

""Of course not. You did the right thing."" Liam brushed a kiss against her earlobe and added, ""Keeping her stuff around would only make it harder to move on.""

I floated right in their faces, glaring at Liam down. ""You're lying!"" I shrieked. ""You called the cleaning service yesterday, before my body was even cold!""

Of course, he couldn't hear me.

""Liam."" Margaret nestled against Liam's chest. ""Sometimes, I get scared thinking—what if you hadn't made her get out of the car that day because of me?""

""Shh."" Liam pressed a finger to her lips. ""This isn't your fault. Blame the truck driver, or maybe Chloe just wasn't careful enough.""

He cupped her face in his hands, whispering, ""We deserve happiness, Margie.""

I froze in mid-air.

They just brushed off my death like it was nothing? Just started a brand new life together, without a shred of guilt?

Rage poured through me.

I focused all my energy and charged at the glass on the coffee table—it didn't budge.

But Margaret suddenly screamed, her fingers digging into Liam's arm.

""What's wrong?"" Liam's eyes swept the room, instantly alert.

""J-Just now, it felt like someone sighed right in my ear."" Margaret's face went deathly pale.

Liam let out a sigh of relief and chuckled, rubbing her cheek. ""You're imagining things, darling. We're alone.""

I froze.

Margaret heard me?

With every ounce of my strength, I screamed at her, ""Get the hell out of my home!""

Margaret shivered violently. ""Liam, I'm freezing all of a sudden.""

Liam tightened his embrace. ""Maybe the air conditioning's just too cold."" He grabbed the remote and turned up the temperature. ""Don't overthink things, hmm?""

For days, I drifted through the apartment like a ghost struck in a loop, haunting the spaces that brimmed with memories.

I watched them having sex in my bed, cooking together in my kitchen, and watching the sunset on my balcony. Each scene tore me apart from inside.

I had tried every trick I could think of to get their attention.

I tried to make noise while they were being intimate, to create distractions while Margaret was looking in the mirror, and even to scream in their ears while they were asleep. But nothing worked.

The only time I succeeded was when I made the curtains sway slightly, but Liam dismissed it as ""the window not being shut right.""

On the evening of the seventh day, I hovered outside the balcony, watching the setting sun stain the clouds blood-red.

Liam and Margaret were discussing their wedding plans in the living room. They wanted to tie the knot within three months after my death. They said fate always changed, and they should seize the moment.

I stared at my see-through hands, finally realizing one truth.

I was dead, and to the living, I was fading away.

I'm 19, bi, and this girl  is 24 and technically a family friend. She used to babysit me when I was younger (we're only 5 years apart so it wasn't like she was a grown adult when I was a kid or anything) andb our moms have always were close so she was around me growing up a lot anyways.

She moved away for a few years and then came back earlier this year and started hanging out with me again. At first it was chill. She was super into feminist lit, talked about learning more about the queer community , gave me a bunch of books and zines and links to essays and stuff and I thought she was cool and smart.  

She always called herself a cis queer ally and used to be super insistent she was straight, but like in that ' i'm sick of this' way. She’d always joke about hating being attracted to men and say she wished she could opt out of heterosexuality. I kinda thought it was just her exaggerating for the jokes, but I never expected her to flip like this. 

We spent a lot of time together. Coffee shops, park walks, movie nights. It felt kind like we were growing to be besties at first but then she started getting really intense. She’d say I was the only person who got her and would get weird and moody if I couldn’t hang out. One time I was at my then-girlfriend’s place  and she texted me 13 times in a row asking if I was mad at her. Stuff started feeling kind of off.  She started calling me pet names and would touch my arm or knee when we talked. I chalked it up to her just being overly affectionate but it kept escalating. 

Last week she invited me over to talk and I thought maybe she was going through something serious so I went. She sat me down and told me she’s a lesbian now. Not like she realized she likes girls but that she decided she’s a lesbian as a political choice. She said she’s trying to unlearn attraction to men and that queer women need to build radical futures together and she sees me as her partner in that vision. It didn’t feel like someone telling me they liked me. It felt like I was being offered a job as her  girlfriend in some revolutionary manifesto.  

I told her I wasn’t comfortable with any of that and that I didn’t want to be someone’s political statement. I said I wanted to be wanted for me, not because she read some essay about toxic heterosexuality and decided I fit into her new ideology. She got really quiet and then said I was being cruel and judgemental and that bi girls always abandon queer women when it matters. I left right after that. 

Since then she’s been vague-posting on her insta story and texting me passive-aggressive stuff like ""thanks for proving my point"" and ""some of us are trying to build real connection and community.""

My mom says I should be nicer because she’s just going through a big transition period in her life and grieving straightness. I feel so uncomfortable. I feel like she tried to emotionally corner me and now I’m the bad guy for not wanting it. 


I’m not trying to say she’s not queer in some way or that she’s an awful person for this but it just didn’t feel right. AITA for rejecting her?

I don't have bloating or cramps.

I eat a somewhat balanced diet - not much fast food or eating out. I probably don't eat enough fruits and veg but I do get some in most meals. I snack on salty foods like chips. If I overindulge in them it seems like my stool is looser the next day.

It seems like it is getting worse - not full-blown diarrhea but stools seem to be getting looser. 

I tried taking Metamucil for a while - slowly increased to 4 tsp a day. It increased the amount of stool, but did nothing to solidify it.

I picked up stone fruit and a little apricot. The flavor notes are all on the mellower side. It was a pleasant experience for sure.

1lwxeex,https://www.reddit.com/r/QuitVaping/comments/1lwxeex/how_i_quit_vaping_without_looking_back_and_will/,How I quit vaping without looking back and will stay off whatever it takes - Until my last breath,"Discovered vapes in Sept 2019. 

It started with a few puffs from friend’s vapes socially, bought mine a month or 2 after and started the on-off game…

I first quit after my gf advised me to from summer 2020 to Fall 2021. At that time, I was fully withdrawn and functioning perfectly fine. Problem is, back then, I wasn’t even remotely aware of what was going to happen in the future if I relapse…

Broke up with the gf in Apr 2022, tricky moment in my life with work and so on, relapsed as a coping mechanism

Since that day, I couldn’t stop and was addicted. 

I was cruising at 8-10.000 puffs / week for the last 3 years. Sometimes buying 2 vapes in the same week. Disposable after disposable, always finding an excuse to keep using.

I fell sick more often in the last 3 years than my whole life. Memory started slipping, was feeling nauseous, had many gastrointestinal issues, my attention span and overall focus was highly diminished… 

I started to develop anedhonia and my safe place was the vape.

First thing I was doing in the morning, hit my vape

Spending 20min at the times in the toilets vaping
Driving and vaping
Couldn’t wait to have my morning coffee with my vape
Watching a movie and vaping
Scrolling and vaping
Working on my laptop and vaping
Studying and vaping

It was non stop. The only moment I wasn’t hitting my vape is during my workouts or when I was outside. 
My « rule » was no vape in the outside, only inside. I thought I was disciplined

First week of May this year, I fell playing soccer and injured my right arm badly. Had to stop exercising, lost some weight, energy, was a bit depressed and sick at the same time. What happened ? I started vaping even more

Less exercise means less time outside means more vaping

I went on a date towards the end of the month and I kid you not, during the whole interaction I was just thinking about how good it will feel to hit my vape after so many hours without it

That was my realization. That night, on my way back home I felt like something clicked. I was so angry at myself driving like a madman expressing my frustration 

I realized I was an addict and that vaping, nicotine was a drug. I was a drug addict. My brain, my immune system, my willpower, my drive, my endocrine system, everything was affected by this drug. I said to myself : never again, I’m not a drug addict and I will never be the slave of a substance 

The next day, on May 30th I quit. Took the 3 vapes I had at home and throwed them out the window. No hesitation.

I quit cold turkey, no patch, no tapering off, NOTHING just absorbing the shock 

First 2 weeks were hell on earth. I was extremely miserable, tired, brain fogged, ultra aggressive, confused, retarded and the list goes on…

Week 2 to 4 were bad but not to the same extent. I still wasn’t able to function normally and endure a full day. I had to lock myself in my room, in the dark in the middle of the day without any stimulation to not feel that my head was going to explode

Tomorrow will be the accomplishment of week 6. I feel noticeably better than the first weeks but I’m nowhere close to my normal abilities. Not even at 50%

- My problem solving skills are impacted
- My short term memory is almost innexistant 
- Brain fog is strong, I’m not able to argument orally, need to prepare everything in advance or just shut up
- Spatial awareness is highly impacted : driving is exhausting and extremely sloppy, can be dangerous at night, I can’t walk fast and dodge people in crowded areas, I lost my sense of direction
- Libido / hormonal system is down (bloodwork testifies) 
- I feel uncomfortable in my own body like if I’m out of place
- Focus is maybe at 20-30% to what I used to be


Yes it’s hard, yes it’s a tough experience but you can’t fix years of abuse and bad habits like nothing happened. 
You gotta be resilient and patient. Because at the end of the day, you still have your health, you still have the luxuries you had before quitting in your life and more than everything : you have your willpower, your inner strength. No one and nothing will take this from you

Quit now for a better future. Yes it’s hard, yes you will suffer but I know it’s worth it. Even if it takes me months or years to regain all my cognitive abilities I will never relapse. I play the long game and want to win badly. Don’t tell yourself you used to smoke / vape, tell yourself you don’t do these things

No one can fully rule it’s life if an addiction runs him.

I like to go there to work sometimes because it's quiet, has good coffee and usually no one bothers me, emphasis on usually.

I was sitting at a two seater table by myself (I had my laptop out, headphones on and was mid email) when this woman in her 30s sits down across from me without asking, just plops her purse on the table and starts talking. first thought maybe she mistook me for someone she knew but nope, she just starts asking me what I’m working on, if I come here often, what I think about the coffee blah blah.

I tried being polite at first and said ""hey, sorry, I’m kind of in the middle of something"" but she just laughed and said ""don’t worry, I won’t distract you too much.""

Okay???

So I tried to go back to my work but she kept going. At some point she said “I love making new friends randomly. it’s so rare these days, don’t you think?"" That’s when I got annoyed and said “I’m actually just waiting for my boyfriend, he’ll be here any minute”

She just said “oh I didn’t realize” and stood up and left without another word.

I don’t have a boyfriend, I just wanted to be left alone. and when I  told my roommate about it later , she said that I was kinda rude, that maybe the woman was just lonely or trying to be friendly.

Constantly striving for improvement, I've built a rather happy life for myself. Always looking for new goals, trying new ways of being healthier, and I LOVE learning and strive to always challenge my beliefs. I enjoy my career (I work as an operator in the chemical manufacturing industry), It provides a good living (which was lacking for most of my life lol) and it gives me an ample amount of time to stay in touch with you throughout the day if you're the type.  

Long distance relationships don't bother me too much (US only), ideally after a set amount of time we both feel like it's appropriate we would move in together and start that journey (relocation to me is ideal). 

I have a lot of interests ranging from gaming to binging watching some of my favorite shows; moral of the story is escapism is one of my favorite past times. I \*love\* running, go to the gym regularly, playing with my pit/lab mix dog named Strider (LOTR reference), a frequent flyer so i love to travel and reading (on a bit of a history theme lately). I love LOVE coffee, hanging with my friends, going to music festivals, and trying new restaurants. As you can tell, I'm a bit of a nerd so fantasy being a huge thing for me ranging from Lord of the Rings movies to the annual Harry Potter marathon around the holidays and everything in between. I do visit my local renaissance fair and try to plan a costume so it would be cool if we could bond that way!

I like small things in relationships that include weekend cuddles (obsessed), evening coffee shop reading dates, lazy mornings, random road trips and hitting the gym together! Maybe we're holding hands at the farmers market looking for dinner ingredients, snuggling in a hammock on a beautiful summer day, or riding bikes/running together. Putting on your playlist in the car cause chances are you're in charge of it xD, you sneaking kisses on my cheek while I'm playing games with my friends, dressing in our A+ outfits and getting lost in time on our date...I'm rambling too much but you get the gist.  

I think fundamentally, even if we don't share the same hobbies, having the same goals and future outlook is most important. I'm very inquisitive so I tend to ask a lot of questions, I don't mind calling whenever you're comfortable because conversations typically flow better that way for me.  

I'll probably only respond if your open to sharing a pic within the first message or two so we can see if the attraction is mutual, i do have preferences for partners who have a thin/petite build or lean towards the athletic/fit side!

Here's me, it's only fair :)

I didn't even like ham much before this day. Sitting around a table with 3 other friends at my friend Ash's house, she asked us if we wanted a ham sandwich. I have never been asked by another adult if they could make me sandwich. She was making one for her son and the offer was kind, but being the ham hater I was, I said no. I didn't think of it again as we all chatted and laughed, drinking coffee. Soon her son was in sight with that ham sandwich. He came over by me and suddenly his ham sandwich rested on my leg so he could use his chubby little hand to get into the chair next to me. He grabbed the sandwich and then offered me a bit! (adorable) I don't know what it was, the delicious looking sandwich, his chubby little hand, or the fact that it was 2pm and I haven't eaten yet, but I knew I needed a sandwich. I politely declined the toddler and left pretty soon after that.

I headed right to the store for ham sandwich ingredients. I chose Black Forest Ham and Sharp Cheddar. *Boyah! (W*ord count? 9 Hams) 

Seriously, that's the end of the story. LOL  I ate ham sandwiches almost everyday for lunch for nearly a year. One time Madison and I had a take out night planned and we couldn't think of anything that sounded good. We wanted ham sandwiches and chips for dinner.

Is there some amazing insightful thought in this story?   Maybe.

## Key Features Analysis

The best perspex coasters of 2025 boast several key features that set them apart from traditional alternatives, ensuring both functionality and aesthetic appeal.

**Material Durability:** Perspex, also known as acrylic, is a highly durable thermoplastic known for its impact resistance. These coasters are crafted from high-quality perspex sheets, typically ranging from 3mm to 5mm in thickness, providing excellent protection against heat, scratches, and spills. The material is also resistant to yellowing and discoloration, ensuring a long-lasting pristine appearance even with regular use.

**Design Versatility:** Perspex coasters offer unparalleled design flexibility, allowing for a wide range of shapes, sizes, and customization options. They can be laser-cut into intricate patterns, engraved with personalized messages or logos, and even printed with vibrant colors and images. This versatility makes them ideal for both personal use and promotional purposes. Popular shapes include squares, circles, hexagons, and custom designs tailored to specific needs and preferences.

**Transparency and Clarity:** One of the defining features of perspex is its exceptional transparency, allowing the natural beauty of the underlying surface to shine through. High-quality perspex coasters offer crystal-clear clarity, minimizing visual obstruction and seamlessly blending with any decor. This transparency also enhances the visibility of any custom designs or engravings, creating a sophisticated and visually appealing effect.

**Heat Resistance:** While not as heat-resistant as some specialized materials, perspex coasters offer adequate protection against moderate heat from hot beverages. The material can withstand temperatures up to approximately 80°C (176°F) without significant deformation or damage. This makes them suitable for use with most coffee mugs, tea cups, and other hot drinks commonly served in homes and offices. For extremely hot beverages, it's advisable to use additional insulation or opt for coasters made from more heat-resistant materials.

**Easy Maintenance:** Perspex coasters are incredibly easy to clean and maintain, requiring minimal effort to keep them looking their best. A simple wipe with a damp cloth or sponge is typically sufficient to remove spills, stains, and fingerprints. For more stubborn marks, a mild detergent can be used. Avoid using abrasive cleaners or scouring pads, as these can scratch the surface of the perspex. Regular cleaning will help maintain the coasters' clarity and prevent the buildup of grime and dirt.

**Non-Slip Base:** Many high-quality perspex coasters feature a non-slip base, typically made from rubber or silicone, to prevent them from sliding around on smooth surfaces. This added grip enhances stability and reduces the risk of accidental spills, particularly on glass or polished furniture. The non-slip base also protects the underlying surface from scratches and scuffs caused by the coaster's movement.

Key features of the best perspex coasters include:
    * High-quality perspex construction
    * Customizable designs and shapes
    * Crystal-clear transparency
    * Moderate heat resistance
    * Easy cleaning and maintenance
    * Non-slip base for added stability

## Core Benefits

Perspex coasters offer a range of practical benefits that make them a worthwhile investment for protecting your furniture and enhancing your living space.

**Surface Protection:** The primary benefit of perspex coasters is their ability to protect surfaces from unsightly rings, stains, and spills caused by beverages. The durable perspex material acts as a barrier, preventing moisture and heat from damaging delicate furniture finishes. This protection extends the lifespan of your tables, countertops, and other surfaces, saving you money on repairs and replacements in the long run.

**Enhanced Aesthetics:** Perspex coasters add a touch of modern elegance to any setting, complementing your existing decor with their sleek and transparent design. The ability to customize these coasters with personalized engravings, logos, or vibrant colors allows you to create a unique and visually appealing accessory that reflects your personal style. Whether you prefer a minimalist look or a bold statement, perspex coasters can be tailored to suit your individual taste.

**Improved Hygiene:** Perspex is a non-porous material that is resistant to the growth of bacteria and mold, making perspex coasters a hygienic choice for serving beverages. Unlike porous materials like wood or cork, perspex does not absorb liquids or harbor germs, reducing the risk of contamination and promoting a cleaner environment. This is particularly important in households with children or individuals with allergies.

**Reduced Noise:** Perspex coasters help reduce noise levels by cushioning the impact of glasses and mugs on hard surfaces. The smooth and solid surface of the perspex absorbs vibrations, minimizing the clinking and clattering sounds that can be disruptive in quiet environments. This is especially beneficial in offices, libraries, and other settings where noise reduction is a priority.

**Increased Stability:** The non-slip base of many perspex coasters provides added stability, preventing glasses and mugs from sliding around on smooth surfaces. This reduces the risk of accidental spills and protects both your furniture and your beverages. The added grip also makes it easier to handle drinks, particularly when carrying them across a room or serving them to guests.

## FAQs Section

Here are some frequently asked questions about perspex coasters to help you make an informed purchase decision.

**Are perspex coasters dishwasher safe?**
    No, perspex coasters are generally not dishwasher safe. The high temperatures and harsh detergents used in dishwashers can damage the perspex material, causing it to warp, crack, or lose its clarity. It is best to clean perspex coasters by hand using a damp cloth or sponge and a mild detergent.

**Can perspex coasters be used with very hot beverages?**
    While perspex coasters offer moderate heat resistance, they are not suitable for use with extremely hot beverages. Perspex can withstand temperatures up to approximately 80°C (176°F) without significant deformation or damage. For very hot drinks, it is advisable to use additional insulation or opt for coasters made from more heat-resistant materials such as cork or stone.

**How can I remove scratches from perspex coasters?**
    Minor scratches on perspex coasters can often be removed using a specialized acrylic polish. Apply a small amount of polish to a soft cloth and gently rub it onto the scratched area in a circular motion. Repeat as needed until the scratch is minimized or removed. For deeper scratches, it may be necessary to consult a professional for polishing or resurfacing.

**Are perspex coasters recyclable?**
    Yes, perspex coasters are recyclable, although the recycling process may vary depending on your local recycling facilities. Perspex is a type of acrylic plastic that can be broken down and reprocessed into new products. Check with your local recycling center to determine whether they accept perspex and what specific procedures are required for recycling it.

1lwwunz,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1lwwunz/i_witnessed_the_strangest_apocalypse_no_one_else/,I witnessed the strangest apocalypse. No one else seems to remember.,"I saw the end of the world, and its harbinger, from the top of a mountain. It’s possible that nobody else had as good a view as I did, but even if I wanted to find out, I can’t. Nobody I’ve asked has corroborated my story. Most just laugh and go along with my excuse that I’m writing a horror book and want to interview random people about the area. A rare two or three have gotten a far-away look in their eyes before shaking their head and refusing to talk about it further.

That look both scares and comforts me. After a few dozen interviews with an equal amount of coffee and beer to help bribe a story from the interviewee, I’m noticing that thousand-yard stare more and more often. A part of me had hoped that I’d gone through the most vivid nightmare ever experienced. That hope gets smaller and smaller the more often I ask someone about the black skies, the red rain, and the yellow eyes.

The last person I interviewed went pale and nauseous after I asked if she remembered anything about that week. Before I could make sure she was okay, she ran off into a nearby park sobbing and telling me to stay the hell away from her. It might have been creepy behavior, especially for a girl that had just been interviewing her, but I sat at the coffee shop for hours until I saw her come out of the park and drive away in her car. Her makeup had smeared all over her face; her jeans and jacket covered in dirt and grass stains.

That was a week ago. It was the last time I doubted that the apocalypse I’d witnessed had happened. The interviews stopped, but that burning desire to learn either if or what anyone else has seen led me here. I want to tell my story and see who else has remembered. Hopefully I can jog your memory. I’ll pray that the memories aren’t as horrifying as mine or that woman who ran off into a park for hours.

I was- *am* a security guard for a mining company that owns the mountains near my apartment complex. Like most security guards, I signed onto the job for the amazing work-to-pay ratio. Half of my shift was doing patrols while listening to audiobooks, the other half keeping half an eye on security cameras posted around the mountain while I played video games. Every now and then I’d have to turn away hikers and check the radio towers near my station, which was what the security company was really paying me for.

The first rumble came during lunchtime. I was in my building, a concrete little thing I called my “hut”, looking at the security cameras and eating an egg salad sandwich when my cup of coffee started to vibrate every few seconds. Nothing to worry about. Earthquakes happen around the valley pretty often, sometimes as often as six in one month. The worrying started when the shaking grew more intense yet happened at the same rate. Put another way, earthquakes usually didn’t have a pace like footsteps. It’s what makes that one scene from that dinosaur movie so memorable.

The shaking got more intense. Thick binders containing company S.O.P.’s started bouncing off of shelves. Monitors were shaken from their stands and crashed to the ground. My coffee cup *bounced* off of the table and spilled onto the ground. I didn’t even notice. I had my head in my hands, curled up into a corner and praying that whatever was happening would just *stop.*

Something screamed. I wish I could say it had been myself, but there was a distant, screeching trumpeting that overpowered any shouting I could have done. A switch flipped in my head, and I needed to see what the hell was happening outside of my building.

My balance was hard to maintain but I managed to time it well with the shakes that were now shaking *everything* so much that a view of the entire planet splitting and shaking open was what I’d assumed would be outside of my hut’s window. But I had to see. If the world was about to end in a fiery explosion, I wanted to see it go. Better that than crying in a cement corner and getting concussions from my head knocking against the walls.

Fumbling, but somewhat stable, I made it to the window that overlooked the north side of the mountains.

Something was crossing the sky. It was higher than the highest clouds, at *least* for or five miles in the air but probably much taller than that. A black, writhing thing that stretched from horizon to horizon, caging the entire sky and casting a pitch-black eclipse in a wave across the valley. There were only a few moments to take the sight in before a pillar, a *leg* rather, crashed into the middle of the valley.

The impact threw me around the room like a ragdoll. After landing, I stayed there on the floor and waited. My ability to think was gone at this point. There was only a raw fear while the shaking continued. 

One more shake that was as powerful as the last. Then another weaker one. They’d started to subside, continuing off towards the south until the room was shaking just enough to make tiny waves in the pool of coffee on the floor next to me. I don’t remember how long I laid there on the floor, only that I got up after the coffee started soaking into my clothes. At one point I thought I heard a low thrumming as the emergency generator below the station kicked into gear.

My body was sore, and it hurt to move, but nothing was broken. Or at least, when I finally sat up and looked at what was left of my hut, broken bones weren’t stabbing any of my innards.

A part of my psyche realized I was technically  still at work and took over. As far as that part of my brain was aware, the room was a mess and my lead would kill me when she got there for her shift. One of the radios on the charging dock was still in its socket. I took it out and thumbed the “talk” button on the side.

“Hey, Maze?”

Maze was short for Maisey, my supervisor that had a trailer-turned-office at the bottom of the mountain.

No response.

“Maze? Maze!? Please respond, I… I need help.”

I let go of the talk button for a response. None came.

“Maze!? *Maze!?* Please tell me you’re there, all of the monitors are broken on the floor, I feel like my whole body is bruised, and all of the paperwork is soaking in a puddle of coffee. 

What do I do!?”

No answer but a slight echo from my shouting off of the concrete walls. I was really starting to notice the silence when a few pitter-patters came from the roof.

*At least it’s not raining,* I cursed as I walked to the window, radio still in hand.

“Maze, can you…”

The window was dark. Pitch black. A short time ago I could see an entire valley below a bright blue summer sky. I imagined, just for a second, that my hut had been sunken into the ground or somehow put into some void that I’d never escape from.

A roar came from behind me and *far* overhead. The sound crested my mountain, and with it a green light that flowed along the sky the same direction as the sound, north to south. I could see the valley for a few seconds as the dim light crept south, a portion of it funneling into what I’d seen crash into the middle of the valley. I referred to it as a leg before, and even now I think that’s the most accurate term for it. The thing had bent and pushed into the ground while I saw it.

Chills went down my arms when I saw, in the brief seconds the light went through it, just how big the leg was. Not width wise, but *length.* It made my head spin even trying to judge the size. Even at the time I was certain that it was connected to whatever was in the sky. 

After the light went into the leg and beyond the southern horizon, the valley started to light up too. Not much of it, though. Whatever that pillar was, it must have knocked out all of the electricity in the valley.

I listened, terrified, while the rainfall got heavier and small blue lights began popping on all over the valley. A lot of electronics can survive an electromagnetic pulse if their circuitry and parts are simple enough, including a lot of flashlights and even some cars, which I just assumed the lights were. 

It might sound odd to bring it up right now, but I want you to consider something I heard referred to as the “terminal freak out point”.

At what point when shit starts to go down do *you* start to panic? Everyone has one, even the most carefully planned and prepared apocalypse preppers you’ve heard about online.

It took three things happening in quick succession for me to reach my own terminal freak out point. The first was realizing that the red haze in front of the lights down in the valley was the rain itself. The rain was thick and red. Mist formed along the bottom of the valley that made any attempts at clearly watching what was happening close to impossible.

Second was the things that came out of the sky.

Even now, sitting here in a library at a public computer, people are giving me looks as my teeth chatter and my legs start to shake. But I’ll push through.

They didn’t *fall* out of the sky, per se, rather they hung from it. That black sky which was so far above our own was partially illuminated by a litany of yellow orbs that descended from whatever had swallowed the valley, maybe even the *world,* up in darkness. Whatever encompassed us, the yellow lights illuminated a billowing, black cloud that seemed to undulate at a fixed height in the sky.

The closer the bright yellow lights got to the ground, the more their light refracted into the rain and mist dropping into the valley. It would have been an unfathomable mercy if this hadn’t been the case, but it illuminated whatever *they* were. I still don’t know, but whenever I bring this up to people I interview, this is always the part where they get uncomfortable. Their subconscious must remember what the things looked like, as I do, and very clearly at that.

Heads.

Huge, black heads with glowing yellow eyes that shone like spotlights. Most were human; some were animals like cats, dogs, or horses. At a few points, when I was still in enough shock to keep staring at them, I saw the heads of insects with dozens and dozens of glowing eyes. They all descended and screamed. The screams didn’t have any sound to them, but the expressions of agony on each of the faces were quite clear. When they were done screaming, they ascended back into the sky to be replaced by another.

The valley was awash in yellow lights, red rain, and red mist. I still wasn’t at my terminal freakout point. Hanging off of the edge, sure, but I was struck stupid with fear and confusion at what I was seeing. I wasn’t pushed off the edge until I *did* start to hear screaming.

All at once, I heard an entire valley of people scream. I’m actually not sure if this is real or not. It’s a real possibility that it was a nightmare that I had while I holed up in my hut for the next week, but I think it was real. I pray to God, literally, that my mind doesn’t have the imagination to think of a sound like what I heard. Millions of wails of despair from a valley of people reaching the terminal freakout point. It formed a choir that I’m sure mimicked the deepest bowels of torment in Hell. I screamed too. Screamed until I tasted blood.

After that point, my memory gets a bit fuzzy.

What I do remember is pulling my window curtains shut and never looking out of them again. My concrete hut became my home, which I left only when I needed to go to the bathroom outside under an umbrella. It was horribly uncomfortable, but I made it work. 

There were emergency rations and snacks, enough for three days. I dragged it out for a week. After five days my stomach was making weird gurgling noises while pain racked my entire body, like my insides were tearing themselves up. There’s not a doubt in my mind that if I hadn’t had the emergency lights, a few paperbacks in my bag, and a few cases of water, I would have gladly thrown myself off of one of the mountain’s steep cliffs. I’m actually not sure if that’s the truth or not. I hope it is.

Besides my books, all my existence really was for a week was the countdown. That initial wave of green that went across the sky and into the pillar repeated itself. Every time it did, I heard screams come from the skies that made my ears ring even when I stuck my fingers in them. The intervals between each of the waves got shorter and shorter over time. At one point I was bored enough to do the math with a pencil and notebook, or at least the best math I could, to see when there wouldn’t be any more breaks between the waves of green light and screams.

A week. Whatever else was going to happen in this nightmare, it would be in a week. I waited. Besides dying, which was still more scary to me than what was going on outside, there was nothing else to do.

At the end, I was so delirious from the constant screaming in the air (mostly from the sky, occasionally from the valley), the hunger, and the time that was impossible to keep track of in my hut, that I crawled out into the rain to see the end for myself. Even thinking about walking made me nauseous.

The final vivid memory I have of the apocalypse started with me dragging myself to the edge of the concrete platform my hut was on and looking out to a destroyed and emaciated valley. There wasn’t much time to get a good look, not that I could have gotten one through the red mist, but I *did* see that there were still some lights bouncing around the buildings. A few of the skyscrapers in the downtown area across from my mountain were burned to a crisp, and I swear I could see a party of some kind going on the rooftop of the tallest one. An insane sight, but I can’t throw any stones; I was there to watch too. And I did watch. The waves of green light and screaming heads in the obsidian sky increased to such a frequency that I’m pretty sure I *felt* my ears give out to a painful whining sound.

The last thing I saw was another head descending from the sky. At that point the heads and the black, inky ceiling were a constant green that exaggerated the glowing eyes. I’m not completely sure, but I think that last head I saw was mine. We matched perfectly, both screaming in a mix of defiance and subservience at whatever was coming.



Then there’s a flash. In my memory, it’s yellow.



My screams were echoing off of my apartment walls. I was in bed, just as I had been the day it had all started. It took some time for me to calm down and remember what a healthy body felt like to move around in while I ate so much that I puked.

Despite what I said earlier, I admit that I’ve never thought it was a dream. I wouldn’t have tried interviewing anyone if that were true. I’d guess that deep down I still hold some hope that what I saw didn’t happen, even though I know it did.

While I’ve taken breaks from writing this for you, I’ve noticed fewer people out on the streets. I’m downtown now, and even during times of low traffic you used to be able to see at least a dozen people walking wherever - plus the constant flow of public transport.  There were still plenty of people going about their business when I first woke up, much to my shock.

On my way around the block to stretch my legs just now, I saw one person on the street. It was a woman in a business suit, a laptop case hanging from one of her hands. She was in the middle of the sidewalk, looking up at the sky. I think she looked scared.

I think people are starting to remember. That scares me almost as much as the apocalypse did because, being as objective as I can about what I experienced, my situation was somewhat of a best-case-scenario. I had a building with lights, books, food, and water all to myself. What could it have been like on the ground level, with millions of people in a compact area? What about the rest of the world?

I hope other people reading this also remember what happened. If you do, let me know. I get the feeling that we’re going to reach a second terminal freakout point when everybody else starts to remember.

It might have been creepy behavior, especially for a girl that had just been interviewing her, but I sat at the coffee shop for hours until I saw her come out of the park and drive away in her car. Her makeup had smeared all over her face; her jeans and jacket covered in dirt and grass stains.

That was a week ago. It was the last time I doubted that the apocalypse I’d witnessed had happened. The interviews stopped, but that burning desire to learn either if or what anyone else has seen led me here. I want to tell my story and see who else has remembered. Hopefully I can jog your memory. I’ll pray that the memories aren’t as horrifying as mine or that woman who ran off into a park for hours.

I was- *am* a security guard for a mining company that owns the mountains near my apartment complex. Like most security guards, I signed onto the job for the amazing work-to-pay ratio. Half of my shift was doing patrols while listening to audiobooks, the other half keeping half an eye on security cameras posted around the mountain while I played video games. Every now and then I’d have to turn away hikers and check the radio towers near my station, which was what the security company was really paying me for.

The first rumble came during lunchtime. I was in my building, a concrete little thing I called my “hut”, looking at the security cameras and eating an egg salad sandwich when my cup of coffee started to vibrate every few seconds. Nothing to worry about. Earthquakes happen around the valley pretty often, sometimes as often as six in one month. The worrying started when the shaking grew more intense yet happened at the same rate. Put another way, earthquakes usually didn’t have a pace like footsteps. It’s what makes that one scene from that dinosaur movie so memorable.

The shaking got more intense. Thick binders containing company S.O.P.’s started bouncing off of shelves. Monitors were shaken from their stands and crashed to the ground. My coffee cup *bounced* off of the table and spilled onto the ground. I didn’t even notice. I had my head in my hands, curled up into a corner and praying that whatever was happening would just *stop.*

Something screamed. I wish I could say it had been myself, but there was a distant, screeching trumpeting that overpowered any shouting I could have done. A switch flipped in my head, and I needed to see what the hell was happening outside of my building.

My balance was hard to maintain but I managed to time it well with the shakes that were now shaking *everything* so much that a view of the entire planet splitting and shaking open was what I’d assumed would be outside of my hut’s window. But I had to see. If the world was about to end in a fiery explosion, I wanted to see it go. Better that than crying in a cement corner and getting concussions from my head knocking against the walls.

Fumbling, but somewhat stable, I made it to the window that overlooked the north side of the mountains.

Something was crossing the sky. It was higher than the highest clouds, at *least* for or five miles in the air but probably much taller than that. A black, writhing thing that stretched from horizon to horizon, caging the entire sky and casting a pitch-black eclipse in a wave across the valley. There were only a few moments to take the sight in before a pillar, a *leg* rather, crashed into the middle of the valley.

The impact threw me around the room like a ragdoll. After landing, I stayed there on the floor and waited. My ability to think was gone at this point. There was only a raw fear while the shaking continued. 

One more shake that was as powerful as the last. Then another weaker one. They’d started to subside, continuing off towards the south until the room was shaking just enough to make tiny waves in the pool of coffee on the floor next to me. I don’t remember how long I laid there on the floor, only that I got up after the coffee started soaking into my clothes. At one point I thought I heard a low thrumming as the emergency generator below the station kicked into gear.

My body was sore, and it hurt to move, but nothing was broken. Or at least, when I finally sat up and looked at what was left of my hut, broken bones weren’t stabbing any of my innards.

A part of my psyche realized I was technically  still at work and took over. As far as that part of my brain was aware, the room was a mess and my lead would kill me when she got there for her shift. One of the radios on the charging dock was still in its socket. I took it out and thumbed the “talk” button on the side.

“Hey, Maze?”

Maze was short for Maisey, my supervisor that had a trailer-turned-office at the bottom of the mountain.

No response.

“Maze? Maze!? Please respond, I… I need help.”

I let go of the talk button for a response. None came.

“Maze!? *Maze!?* Please tell me you’re there, all of the monitors are broken on the floor, I feel like my whole body is bruised, and all of the paperwork is soaking in a puddle of coffee. 

What do I do!?”

No answer but a slight echo from my shouting off of the concrete walls. I was really starting to notice the silence when a few pitter-patters came from the roof.

*At least it’s not raining,* I cursed as I walked to the window, radio still in hand.

“Maze, can you…”

The window was dark. Pitch black. A short time ago I could see an entire valley below a bright blue summer sky. I imagined, just for a second, that my hut had been sunken into the ground or somehow put into some void that I’d never escape from.

A roar came from behind me and *far* overhead. The sound crested my mountain, and with it a green light that flowed along the sky the same direction as the sound, north to south. I could see the valley for a few seconds as the dim light crept south, a portion of it funneling into what I’d seen crash into the middle of the valley. I referred to it as a leg before, and even now I think that’s the most accurate term for it. The thing had bent and pushed into the ground while I saw it.

Chills went down my arms when I saw, in the brief seconds the light went through it, just how big the leg was. Not width wise, but *length.* It made my head spin even trying to judge the size. Even at the time I was certain that it was connected to whatever was in the sky. 

After the light went into the leg and beyond the southern horizon, the valley started to light up too. Not much of it, though. Whatever that pillar was, it must have knocked out all of the electricity in the valley.

I listened, terrified, while the rainfall got heavier and small blue lights began popping on all over the valley. A lot of electronics can survive an electromagnetic pulse if their circuitry and parts are simple enough, including a lot of flashlights and even some cars, which I just assumed the lights were. 

It might sound odd to bring it up right now, but I want you to consider something I heard referred to as the “terminal freak out point”.

At what point when shit starts to go down do *you* start to panic? Everyone has one, even the most carefully planned and prepared apocalypse preppers you’ve heard about online.

It took three things happening in quick succession for me to reach my own terminal freak out point. The first was realizing that the red haze in front of the lights down in the valley was the rain itself. The rain was thick and red. Mist formed along the bottom of the valley that made any attempts at clearly watching what was happening close to impossible.

Second was the things that came out of the sky.

Even now, sitting here in a library at a public computer, people are giving me looks as my teeth chatter and my legs start to shake. But I’ll push through.

They didn’t *fall* out of the sky, per se, rather they hung from it. That black sky which was so far above our own was partially illuminated by a litany of yellow orbs that descended from whatever had swallowed the valley, maybe even the *world,* up in darkness. Whatever encompassed us, the yellow lights illuminated a billowing, black cloud that seemed to undulate at a fixed height in the sky.

The closer the bright yellow lights got to the ground, the more their light refracted into the rain and mist dropping into the valley. It would have been an unfathomable mercy if this hadn’t been the case, but it illuminated whatever *they* were. I still don’t know, but whenever I bring this up to people I interview, this is always the part where they get uncomfortable. Their subconscious must remember what the things looked like, as I do, and very clearly at that.

Heads.

Huge, black heads with glowing yellow eyes that shone like spotlights. Most were human; some were animals like cats, dogs, or horses. At a few points, when I was still in enough shock to keep staring at them, I saw the heads of insects with dozens and dozens of glowing eyes. They all descended and screamed. The screams didn’t have any sound to them, but the expressions of agony on each of the faces were quite clear. When they were done screaming, they ascended back into the sky to be replaced by another.

The valley was awash in yellow lights, red rain, and red mist. I still wasn’t at my terminal freakout point. Hanging off of the edge, sure, but I was struck stupid with fear and confusion at what I was seeing. I wasn’t pushed off the edge until I *did* start to hear screaming.

All at once, I heard an entire valley of people scream. I’m actually not sure if this is real or not. It’s a real possibility that it was a nightmare that I had while I holed up in my hut for the next week, but I think it was real. I pray to God, literally, that my mind doesn’t have the imagination to think of a sound like what I heard. Millions of wails of despair from a valley of people reaching the terminal freakout point. It formed a choir that I’m sure mimicked the deepest bowels of torment in Hell. I screamed too. Screamed until I tasted blood.

After that point, my memory gets a bit fuzzy.

What I do remember is pulling my window curtains shut and never looking out of them again. My concrete hut became my home, which I left only when I needed to go to the bathroom outside under an umbrella. It was horribly uncomfortable, but I made it work. 

There were emergency rations and snacks, enough for three days. I dragged it out for a week. After five days my stomach was making weird gurgling noises while pain racked my entire body, like my insides were tearing themselves up. There’s not a doubt in my mind that if I hadn’t had the emergency lights, a few paperbacks in my bag, and a few cases of water, I would have gladly thrown myself off of one of the mountain’s steep cliffs. I’m actually not sure if that’s the truth or not. I hope it is.

Besides my books, all my existence really was for a week was the countdown. That initial wave of green that went across the sky and into the pillar repeated itself. Every time it did, I heard screams come from the skies that made my ears ring even when I stuck my fingers in them. The intervals between each of the waves got shorter and shorter over time. At one point I was bored enough to do the math with a pencil and notebook, or at least the best math I could, to see when there wouldn’t be any more breaks between the waves of green light and screams.

A week. Whatever else was going to happen in this nightmare, it would be in a week. I waited. Besides dying, which was still more scary to me than what was going on outside, there was nothing else to do.

At the end, I was so delirious from the constant screaming in the air (mostly from the sky, occasionally from the valley), the hunger, and the time that was impossible to keep track of in my hut, that I crawled out into the rain to see the end for myself. Even thinking about walking made me nauseous.

The final vivid memory I have of the apocalypse started with me dragging myself to the edge of the concrete platform my hut was on and looking out to a destroyed and emaciated valley. There wasn’t much time to get a good look, not that I could have gotten one through the red mist, but I *did* see that there were still some lights bouncing around the buildings. A few of the skyscrapers in the downtown area across from my mountain were burned to a crisp, and I swear I could see a party of some kind going on the rooftop of the tallest one. An insane sight, but I can’t throw any stones; I was there to watch too. And I did watch. The waves of green light and screaming heads in the obsidian sky increased to such a frequency that I’m pretty sure I *felt* my ears give out to a painful whining sound.

The last thing I saw was another head descending from the sky. At that point the heads and the black, inky ceiling were a constant green that exaggerated the glowing eyes. I’m not completely sure, but I think that last head I saw was mine. We matched perfectly, both screaming in a mix of defiance and subservience at whatever was coming.



Then there’s a flash. In my memory, it’s yellow.



My screams were echoing off of my apartment walls. I was in bed, just as I had been the day it had all started. It took some time for me to calm down and remember what a healthy body felt like to move around in while I ate so much that I puked.

Despite what I said earlier, I admit that I’ve never thought it was a dream. I wouldn’t have tried interviewing anyone if that were true. I’d guess that deep down I still hold some hope that what I saw didn’t happen, even though I know it did.

While I’ve taken breaks from writing this for you, I’ve noticed fewer people out on the streets. I’m downtown now, and even during times of low traffic you used to be able to see at least a dozen people walking wherever - plus the constant flow of public transport.  There were still plenty of people going about their business when I first woke up, much to my shock.

On my way around the block to stretch my legs just now, I saw one person on the street. It was a woman in a business suit, a laptop case hanging from one of her hands. She was in the middle of the sidewalk, looking up at the sky. I think she looked scared.

I think people are starting to remember. That scares me almost as much as the apocalypse did because, being as objective as I can about what I experienced, my situation was somewhat of a best-case-scenario. I had a building with lights, books, food, and water all to myself. What could it have been like on the ground level, with millions of people in a compact area? What about the rest of the world?

I hope other people reading this also remember what happened. If you do, let me know. I get the feeling that we’re going to reach a second terminal freakout point when everybody else starts to remember.

1lwwsxp,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1lwwsxp/i_witnessed_the_strangest_apocalypse_nobody_else/,I witnessed the strangest apocalypse. Nobody else seems to remember.,"I saw the end of the world, and its harbinger, from the top of a mountain. It’s possible that nobody else had as good a view as I did, but even if I wanted to find out, I can’t. Nobody I’ve asked has corroborated my story. Most just laugh and go along with my excuse that I’m writing a horror book and want to interview random people about the area. A rare two or three have gotten a far-away look in their eyes before shaking their head and refusing to talk about it further.

That look both scares and comforts me. After a few dozen interviews with an equal amount of coffee and beer to help bribe a story from the interviewee, I’m noticing that thousand-yard stare more and more often. A part of me had hoped that I’d gone through the most vivid nightmare ever experienced. That hope gets smaller and smaller the more often I ask someone about the black skies, the red rain, and the yellow eyes.

It's no longer just about aesthetics; sustainability is now a basic component. Think about it - a few years ago, ""chic"" might have meant the latest fast fashion trends, regardless of their environmental impact. Now, there's a growing understanding that a truly chic outfit or home good is one that's ethically sourced, made from lasting materials, and built to last.

This shift is evident in the rise of pre-loved clothing and furniture. Finding a vintage dress or a repurposed coffee table is now seen as incredibly stylish as it demonstrates a commitment to reducing waste. The emphasis is on conscious consumption and knowing the story behind the products we buy.

What are some specific examples you've noticed where sustainability has really redefined what's considered ""chic""? Are there certain brands or materials that you think embody this changed definition perfectly? I'd be interested to hear your perspectives!",1,1752205118.0,EcoChicWomen,0,1.0,False

**“No roti? No rice? Good luck with that.”**  
They weren’t being mean — just real.  
In our house, carbs weren’t just food. They were culture. Comfort. Tradition.

# 🍚 But I Needed to Do This for Me

I was tired of feeling foggy.  
Of hiding behind oversized clothes.  
Of watching my energy crash every afternoon like clockwork.

So I didn’t try to convince them. I didn’t demand a keto kitchen.

I just quietly cooked **one extra dish** at every meal — for myself.

# 🍳 What That Looked Like Day by Day:

**Breakfast:**  
They had toast or paratha.  
I made myself a 3-egg spinach omelette in butter with black coffee.

**Lunch:**  
They had dal-chawal or sabzi-roti.  
I had grilled chicken or paneer with sautéed veggies in ghee.

**Dinner:**  
They ordered pizza or cooked aloo dishes.  
I made a cauliflower rice stir-fry with chili, garlic, and leftover meat.

**No drama. No pressure. Just quiet consistency.**

# 🥄 And Then Something Funny Happened…

They started **stealing bites** from my plate.

My dad was like:  
**“That smells good… what’s in that?”**

My sister asked:  
**“Wait — you’re losing weight and still eating cheese?”**

Bit by bit, they got curious.  
Not because I forced them.  
But because I stayed consistent.

# 🧠 Living With Others Doesn’t Mean You Have to Break Your Own Promises

Here’s what worked for me:

* I kept **simple ingredients** ready (eggs, butter, spinach, frozen chicken)
* I batch-cooked keto basics so I didn’t have to cook twice every time
* I never preached keto — I just **lived it**

And slowly, they stopped mocking.  
They started respecting.  
And in some cases… they even started *joining me.*

That’s my boyfriend and she was like yeah I know I know I was. I just wanted to let you know and I was like OK a little odd but whatever then me and him break up after I found out he was cheating on me I never figured out who but then a month later Mark and Mariah got together and at this point I was like what the fuck and this girl had the audacity to say oh I guess it was just fate and everything happens for a reason so I guess I me being the dumbass. I was just let it slide you know because new friend of this town so I was like oh my God this girl is my best friend. I mean I don’t really care. I guess I’ll give them my blessing first red flag I missed.
Then couple months later she was just kind of bullying me for some of the stuff I did and always trying to one of me which she failed miserably at like I joined volleyball she joined volleyball. I did basketball she did basketball and only after I told her about what I did then I did softball and I was like hey girl I’m doing softball. This girl joined softball and I was like okay she’s my friend. She’s just trying to spend more time with me But then she would get with the team and just talk shit behind my back and start rumours and gossip. I also ignored it because I was like no she wouldn’t do that even though everyone was telling me that she was I just didn’t wanna believe it. I know I know I’m stupid.
So yeah, I’m kind of realising this mistake I made by being her friend but anyway so now that we’re back in real time here’s what’s kind of been going on so her and Mark actually just broke up and I’ve been supporting her through this break up and honestly, she totally freaked out on me the other day And called me every name in the book and she’s been kind of stalking my house and so was Mark Mark’s been texting me trying to get back together but things have been going really crazy and I don’t really know if I want to get back with Mark because he cheated on me and I don’t wanna go through that again and then she after what she did and what she’s been doing I don’t know but they’ve both been stalking me and liking all of my post on Facebook commenting stupid stuff and there’s been a lot of rumours going on about me all the sudden but I don’t know.

La Cabra was fantastic. A little stressful sitting at the counter trying to enjoy coffee with my kids in tow but they were very accommodating and friendly. I wish I had more time to check out the Wurtz ceramic work. 

Special shout out to Cloud Picker. Friendly, knowledgeable staff with good roast variety and a great little tasting bar. Really good branding. It looked like they also offer some roasting classes for DIY roasters, which I thought was cool.

Here’s How to Get Rid of Your Singleness,"Let’s cut the fluff — if you don’t *want* to be single, but nothing’s changing, then something’s got to give. Singleness isn’t a curse, but **chronic unwanted singlehood** is often a *pattern*, not a mystery. Good news? Patterns can change.

Here’s how to start **actually getting out of singleness**, step by step — Aggie style:

# 🧼 1. Clean Up Your Internal Narratives

>

These thoughts don’t make you mysterious — they make you stuck. Flip them. Be someone *you* would want to date. Be curious. Be active.

# 🧍 2. Show Up Where People Are

It’s hard to date if no one can see you.

* Go to club events.
* Study somewhere social (hello Evans Library basement).
* Actually *look around* in class or at the gym.
* Say hi to the regular at that same coffee shop line.

Real life > apps. Proximity leads to connection.

# 📲 3. Take the First Step (Even If It’s Online)

You're not above putting yourself out there. Comment on a post. Start a conversation. Join our **Weekly Post Yourself Thread** (pinned!). DM someone respectfully.

The biggest flex? Effort.

# 🎯 4. Know What You Want (and What You're Settling For)

Want a girlfriend/boyfriend? Or just attention?  
Want a connection? Or afraid of rejection?

Reflect and move **intentionally** — not out of fear or loneliness, but out of genuine desire.

# 🧩 5. Stop Waiting for a Perfect Person

Your future partner isn’t going to slide into your life like a Netflix recommendation. Real people are imperfect. That’s what makes relationships fun.

You want to stop being single? Start by **showing up. Here. Now.**

There’s love in the morning, in coffee-less light,
In the hush before dawn, when the world feels just right.
In the rustle of blankets, in sighs soft and deep,
In the rhythm of breathing, the secrets we keep.

There’s warmth in the silence between every word,
In glances exchanged, and in feelings inferred.
No need for loud promises written in stone—
Just hands reaching out, saying, “You’re not alone.”

It lives in the laughter that bubbles with ease,
In the peace that arrives when we simply just be.
It hums in the kitchen with dishes and song,
In the quiet forgiveness when things go all wrong.

It’s found in the spaces we build side by side,
In the years that we weather, the tears that we hide.
And though life may stumble and seasons may shift,
The smallest of moments remain the true gift.

So give me the mornings, the nights, and the in-betweens—
The heartbeats unnoticed, the everyday scenes.
For love isn’t loud, and it rarely shows—
But it blooms in the quiet,
Where quiet love grows.

I’ll try to be brief. I’m not really sure what I want in response, I guess just to talk. 

*Background:*  
I do feel emotions very strongly, and I’ve been so into nearly every person I’ve ever dated, but my feelings towards this one guy, M23, who I had a week-long fling with in December 2023 are so extreme that they make me seriously question wtf is wrong with me.  
Our first date was like 8 hours long—we meant to just get coffee, but we sat in the car outside my house until it got dark, just talking. Tbh, I wasn’t physically attracted to him, but I thought he was so funny, I could tell he really liked me, and he was really wanting to go on a second date. I’m never attracted to people, so this was not abnormal for me. On the second date, it was like a switch had flipped, I thought he was beautiful, he looked like an angel and I immediately became crazy about him. We stopped “dating” a little over a week later but kept seeing eachother casually. We both said ‘I love you’ about a year in, and I meant it. Technically it was casual, but none of it ever felt casual. We completely stopped talking for three months before this, but the feelings never subsided for either of us.

I just feel very weird. We saw eachother a few days ago. For some reason, just kissing him and being around him makes me feel emotions I have never felt before in my life. I’ve seriously considered whether he has a bad nicotine addiction and the nicotine residue is making me addicted to kissing him. He’s always said he feels similarly about me, but I know this might be a lie. If he is lying, he is excellent at it and has been lying about being obsessed with me for two years straight. I see him in public sometimes, and it’s not that I get nervous, I just think he’s gorgeous and looking at him makes me feel so good that my heartrate goes up *quick,* and it’s made me almost pass out a couple of times. I very occasionally faint while fasting, so I know exactly what it feels like. 

I feel like I’m in hell. Am I being naïve ? This seems so abnormal to me. I’ve been in longterm relationships before, I’ve been super into other people before (even unhealthily so), but this feels a lot different than that. I’ve tried getting over it several times, but nothing has ever worked. ",1,1752204555.0,SeriousConversation,9,1.0,False
1lwwkos,https://v.redd.it/rxsgeywpq5cf1,Gaggia E24 solenoid/water discharge on new unit,"Hi,  
  
I need some advice. I have a Gaggia Classic E24 that’s coming to the end of the return period & I’m wondering if I may have an issue with it. First of all, I love the machine & it’s making amazing coffee.  
  
However, I’ve noticed that my drip tray never got full - after 3 weeks of use and at least 3 shots a day never once emptying it. In fact, the water barely covered the bottom of the drip tray when I did finally check it. I’ve been paying particular attention when I turn off the shot & I only a few drops of water comes out.  
  
When I first reached out to Whole Latte Love, they thought that perhaps it was the 3-way solenoid getting stuck. I had never tried removing the portafilter immediately after the shot so I couldn’t answer at that time if I was getting the portafilter stuck or had “portafilter sneeze” happening. I’ve tried this a few times since and I don’t have any issues with the portafilter getting stuck or portafilter sneeze. I do however have \*very\* soupy pucks - and have from day 1 with this Gaggia.   
  
So I’m still wondering about the lack of water coming out the down tube into the drip tray. It’s not like what I’ve seen in other people’s videos.   
  
I’m right at the end of my return policy. I don’t really want to return the unit but I’d just like some better idea whether it’s working correctly. WLL suggested I take everything apart and clean the solenoid but that was back when they thought I might be having the portafilter stuck/portafilter sneeze. Now that I know the portafilter isn’t having those issues, I don’t really want to take everything apart if cleaning the solenoid won’t actually make a difference in what’s going on. If it would help, I can try that but I was hoping for some more input from other Gaggia owners before proceeding.  
  
I’ve included a video I took this morning showing the water exiting from the down tube. What do you think? Does this look normal? Would you go ahead and pull everything apart to clean the solenoid? Do you think that won’t help anyway? Does this seem unusual? I’d love to hear your thoughts & experiences. Any advice would be super helpful.

In most markets, economics warrants that similar goods and services mostly converge in price if the consumers have (1) optionality (2) information about most of the market 

And yet the variance I see in both development cost and film rolls is huge. There’s no way that these labs that’s charge 2 or 3 times more have some magic scanner that’s amazing. I see many professionals come to the lab I go to which charges $6 for develop and scan per roll, and they post pictures from actually great photographers on instagram (even though I’m a very casual film person and an absolute beginner who’s only done maybe 1-2 rolls so far and has a point and shoot). Meanwhile labs that many people go to charge $15 or even $20+ a roll without prints. Why?

Same with film rolls. I just bought a bunch of rolls from B&H, gold and colorpluses for $8.5 each, portra is usually $80 for a 5 pack, and cinestill is between $14-18 each for example.
But I unexpectedly ran out of a roll today and went to Eliz in Chinatown to get a single roll to continue taking a few pictures, and they were selling colorplus/gold for $15 each and portra/cinestill 400 for $20 each (regardless of if you buy either in 3 or 5 packs respectively) (while being cash only?)
This is just insane when cheap Kodak stock is $8.49 at b&h or at some other places.

Many other similar goods/services like coffee or similar food are mostly similarly priced even if they are a bit more far from Manhattan, but the stuff with film probably means consumers are paying all these different prices everywhere? Even high quality scans at the $6/roll place are $9/roll, and there’s several labs who do $10/roll as well, then why would a $20/roll place even exist, or places that sell film for 1.5x-2x the cost?
I just bought film for the first time ever recently, after buying my first ever camera, is the market just flooded with price insensitive beginners who go to the nearest store and buy whatever is there for any price?",6,1752204410.0,AnalogCommunity,6,1.0,False

Chapter 6: The New Echo

Detective Samuel “Sam” Carter stood in front of the grimy window of the precinct’s break room, staring out at the city. His reflection barely visible in the cracked glass, he could almost taste the dust in the air. Dallas was a place of contradictions: bright lights, big cars, and ambition. But there was a darker side to it, one that seemed to swallow up the truth.

Sam had always been able to see things others couldn’t. From a young age, he could pick up on the threads of people’s lives—the way their stories didn’t quite add up, how details skipped past others unnoticed. It wasn’t always a gift, though. It was more like a curse. Growing up in the foster system, he had learned to read people quickly. You had to, to survive. But over the years, it had sharpened into something more. It was why he was here, assigned to one of the toughest and most thankless departments—cold cases.

Before he became a detective, Sam had spent years on the streets. His sharp eye for detail earned him a reputation, but it wasn’t always for the right reasons. Some people called him obsessive. Some called him a workaholic. But after seeing so many cases go cold, he became determined to fix what was broken. That’s how he ended up with this assignment—fresh out of a few rough years working narcotics and violent crimes. The brass saw something in him, something they thought could bring fresh blood to the department’s oldest, most unsolvable mysteries.

“Hey, Carter. The DA wants to see you in her office,” a voice said behind him.

Sam turned to see his new partner, Detective Mia Torres, standing in the doorway. Mia had been on the force longer than him, but they’d only just been paired up. She was quiet, focused, and had a reputation for solving cases that others had given up on. Her sharp mind and dry humor made her a good fit for a guy like Sam.

""Got it,"" he said, pushing off the counter and following her through the narrow hallway of the precinct. He hadn’t expected a warm welcome, cold cases weren’t sexy, after all—but he wasn’t here for applause. He was here to dig up the bones buried deep under the city’s surface.

They reached the DA’s office, and the door swung open before Sam could knock. Inside, District Attorney Veronica Palmer sat behind her desk, a sharp woman in her late forties with dark eyes that didn’t miss a thing. To her right stood Chief of Police Reginald Moore, a towering figure who had seen his share of battles in the city’s criminal underworld.

Sam greeted them with a curt nod.

“Carter,” Palmer said, her voice smooth but firm. “I hear you’ve been looking into some of our cold cases. We’ve got some files stacked up, and frankly, we need someone who can see things others miss.”

“I don’t miss much,” Sam replied, his tone just as serious. “I’ve been going through the oldest cases. There are patterns in these things—if you look closely.”

Chief Moore leaned forward, his deep voice rumbling. “We know. But these cases are dead in the water. If anyone could’ve solved them, they would have. You’re not here to waste your time on ghosts, Carter. We need answers. You’re not just chasing old leads. We need closure for these families.”

Sam paused, eyeing the two of them. He could tell that the DA wasn’t just talking about the victims, but about herself. Palmer had spent years trying to bring justice to families, but even she knew the cold case files were a black hole.

“I understand,” Sam said. “But sometimes the truth is hiding in plain sight. It’s just a matter of connecting the dots. Let me dig into the cold cases, and I’ll find something. I’ll find connections.”

Mia’s expression softened a fraction. She knew Sam’s reputation for seeing patterns when others couldn’t. He wasn’t like most detectives. He didn’t just see a string of disjointed incidents. He saw the flow, the way things bled together, connecting across time and space.

“Do what you need to do,” Palmer said. “But just know—no one here is holding their breath for a miracle. The mayor’s breathing down our necks to close some of these, and we don’t have time for wild goose chases.”

Sam nodded. He wasn’t after miracles. Just answers.

Hours later, Sam sat in his small office, the door cracked open to the bullpen beyond. His desk was piled high with files, photos, and handwritten notes. Cold cases. Files from the last five years. His fingers traced over the names—victims who had once been someone’s daughter, sister, friend. People who’d vanished without a trace, leaving behind nothing but an unsolved case number.

His eyes drifted to a file that had been sitting on the corner of his desk for days. It was marked with a single name: Madison Rios. He opened the file and scanned through the details—art major, college senior, found dead in a stairwell downtown. A case that had never been solved, and one of the more recent ones.

Then, as his eyes flicked over the crime scene photos, he noticed something strange. A torn page from a sketchbook, almost buried under a pile of forensic reports. The words written there caught his attention:

""Paint me in silence.""

He froze.

That wasn’t like any note a killer would leave.

Sam’s fingers moved swiftly as he flipped through the file, now hype focused. Another victim. Deborah Ann King, a warehouse worker found behind an old theater. A folded note in her jacket read:

""The Echo That Bled.""

He leaned back in his chair, feeling a stir of unease in his chest. The cases weren’t connected by just the method of killing—there was something else. A message.

He flipped to the next case in the pile: Jessica Nguyen. The receipt tucked into her boot said:

""Echoes don’t lie.""

And finally, Mia Bell—her case not even a year old. Her final note:

""Your voice woke me.""

His heart skipped a beat.

Sam knew a pattern when he saw one. These weren’t random. These weren’t just victim statements. These were messages. The same tone. The same rhythm.

He opened a new document on his laptop, typing the names, the phrases, and the dates.

Madison – 2019
Deborah – 2020
Jessica – 2021
Mia – 2022

The rhythm was undeniable. One each year, each with a message.

It was clear now—these cases were connected.

Sam stared at the screen, his mind racing. He wasn’t sure who had been behind the killings yet, but he was certain of one thing: these weren’t isolated incidents.

He reached for the phone, dialing the DA’s office. His gut was telling him something was about to break wide open. It was time to talk to the higher-ups.

“Carter,” Palmer answered, a hint of impatience in her tone.

“I think I’m onto something,” Sam said, his voice low but urgent. “There’s a pattern. It’s not just random. These cases are connected, and I need resources to track down whoever's behind them. We can’t let this slip through our fingers.”

There was a pause on the other end.

“Meet me in my office. Now,” Palmer said, her voice firm. “And bring your findings.”

Sam’s stomach tightened. He had no doubt that what he was about to present would change everything. He didn’t yet know who David was, or that his podcast had been following the same trail, but in this moment, the path he was following felt like it had just crossed into dangerous territory.

He grabbed the files and stood, the weight of what he was about to uncover settling over him like a heavy coat. It was time to connect the dots.

Chapter 7: The Echo's Keeper

on the other side of town

The night air was thick with the sounds of distant traffic, the hum of a city that never truly slept. 

Eric Lane.

He’d been watching him for weeks. The music producer with the warm smile and the easy laugh. Too loud for a man so ordinary, too quiet in all the wrong places.

The Keeper saw much of Eric he remember him, his voice once a child now a man. His eyes had already mapped out the contours of the man’s life, like an artist sketching the outline of a figure they would never paint. Eric was nothing more than a note in the melody, another victim, another piece of the puzzle.

The Keeper had always been a listener. He had to be. It was the only way to hear the truth. The unseen whispers, the forgotten cries, the voices that had no place in the world—those were the ones that mattered.

It had all begun with Regina. A ghost in a world that didn’t care to remember her. The Echo hadn’t meant to start with her again, but when he’d heard the name ""Cassandra"", a forgotten truth in David's voice, something had shifted. Someone had finally noticed.

It was the same with Eric. The man’s life was a record, playing in the background of the city’s noise. A life of quiet routine and saddened past. But it was the cracks in the surface that mattered. He was starting to fade, slipping through the cracks, unnoticed. And that was the moment the killer had chosen him. Not for what he was, but for what he could become.

Eric had a soft voice, melodic hum that carried under the surface. There was a song buried in him. The Echo had heard it the first time he’d walked past the music studio it remind him of child he knew talking to the TV news about his late mother, the faint echoes of sound slipping out into the night. Not much. But enough to know.

A victim is never just a victim. Not to the killer. They’re a bridge. A bridge to something greater. A message.

The night had come. The stars had watched as he followed Eric’s familiar path, his footsteps echoing softly against the cracked pavement. The killer was careful, patient. He knew the rhythm of the streets. He had learned it over the time, watching, waiting for the right moment. He wasn’t like the others. He didn’t rush. He didn’t force the world into his design.

Eric had stopped near a dark alley, and the Whisperer had seen his chance. He’d been prepared—he always was. The silent step, the quiet presence. A note, folded and waiting. One message.

And then, just like that, Eric had been taken. No violence, no unnecessary struggle. Just silence. The silence that had been written. The killer had left him there, alone, cold, with a message.

""The Voice That Died"".

But that wasn’t the end. The killer wasn’t finished yet. There was still more to do. He watched as the police arrived, the red and blue lights flashing in the distance. They were slow, taking their time, walking over the familiar ground that he knew better than anyone. They didn’t hear the voices.

But he did.

He stood at the edge of the crowd, distant, observing. The investigators were busy. The detective with the dark eyes—Sam Carter—was already there, examining the scene. The killer knew the man. He had heard his name in the news ""New detective assign to  cold cases in the Dallas area"". Sam Carter. Another listener, another seeker. They were alike, but not the same. The Whisperer smiled quietly to himself.

And then, in the midst of the chaos, the keeper slipped a pair of earbuds into his ears, the sounds of the night blending with the soft hum of the latest episode of David’s podcast.

The episode was nothing out of the ordinary, a typical dive into the unspoken stories of the city's darker corners. David’s voice, smooth and calculated, filled his mind as he stood there, blending with the crowd.

As Sam Carter crouched beside Eric’s lifeless body, the killer couldn’t help but hear the echo of the moment—the final note in the long, quiet composition.

The sirens faded into the night.

but the whispers continued.

Chapter 8: The Voice That Called Him

Moments before the attack

Sam stood before the DA’s desk, the file spread out in front of him like a collection of loose threads waiting to be woven together. Palmer’s sharp gaze never wavered as she scanned through the notes, while Chief Moore leaned against the wall, arms folded across his chest.

“This is what I’ve got,” Sam said, his voice steady despite the adrenaline that buzzed in his chest. “There are five cases. Four victims. All connected by a series of cryptic phrases—each one left behind by the killer in a way that can’t be coincidence.”

Palmer raised an eyebrow. “Cryptic phrases?”

“Messages,” Sam continued. “Regina McClain, Madison Rios, Deborah Ann King, Jessica Nguyen, and Mia Bell. Each case had a strange note. These weren’t just random, off-the-cuff statements. These were deliberate. They’re almost poetic.”

He flipped through the file, showing them the lines one by one.

“Paint me in silence” He paused, glancing at both of them. ""He hears you"" “The Echo That Bled"" ""Echoes don’t lie"" And ""Your voice woke me"".

Chief Moore frowned, pushing off from the wall. “So, we’ve got a Serial killer leaving cryptic messages, but Why?”

Sam’s eyes met his. “The pattern is clear. Each victim was chosen carefully, each method precise. No sign of forced entry, no sexual assault, no robbery. Just death. But it’s the rhythm that’s important—one victim a year, the notes each year building upon the last.”

“The first was in 2018,” Sam continued, pointing to the timeline on his digital map. “Then 2019, 2020, 2021, and now 2022. The killer’s following a schedule, and it’s methodical. The notes themselves have a consistent tone, almost like they’re speaking to someone... or something.”

“And you think all of this points to the same killer?” Palmer asked, her voice low, skeptical.

“I’m not just guessing,” Sam said, tapping the screen. “These phrases? They’re connected. They’re almost like parts of a riddle, a puzzle that only the killer understands. It’s not random. It’s deliberate. There’s someone out there sending a message, and if we don’t catch it now, the next victim could be right around the corner.”

There was a long pause as the DA and Chief Moore exchanged a look. Palmer finally broke the silence.

“Alright, Carter,” she said, leaning back in her chair. “We’ll give you the resources. But you better have something concrete. We’ve been chasing ghosts for too long, and the mayor wants results.”

Sam nodded, his jaw set. He’d seen how cold cases could drag on, how bureaucracy could grind down any hope of progress. But this wasn’t just another case. He could feel it in his bones. This was different.

Before he could say more, his phone buzzed on the table. he saw the caller ID—Detective Torres.

He picked up immediately.

“Carter,” Mia’s voice crackled through the receiver, sharp with urgency. “You need to get to the scene. Now.”

“What happened?” Sam asked, his pulse quickening.

“It’s... it’s a murder, Sam. A man was found dead in an alley, and there’s something... strange about it. The victim’s name is Eric Lane.”

Sam’s mind raced, but he kept his voice steady. “Eric Lane. What’s strange about it?”

“I don’t know yet, but the body’s—there’s something odd. A note was found with him. I need you here, Sam.”

Sam’s stomach twisted. He knew this could be nothing. But it also could be everything. He didn’t have time to waste.

“I’m on my way.”

an hour later...

The sun had barely begun to dip behind the skyline as Sam pulled up to the crime scene. The flashing blue and red lights bathed the alley in an eerie glow, casting shadows that stretched long across the pavement. A small crowd of onlookers was being held back by uniformed officers, and the air was thick with tension.

Mia stood near the edge of the scene, her expression grim.

“Where’s the body?” Sam asked, scanning the area.

“Over here,” Mia said, leading him to the far end of the alley. The victim was a man in his mid-thirties, his body slumped against the side of a dumpster, the life drained from him. His clothes were nondescript, nothing that stood out as unusual. But what caught Sam’s attention immediately was the note—this time, it was taped to the man’s chest.

He pulled the note free with gloved hands and held it up. The message was stark, clear, and chilling:

“The Voice That Died.”

Sam’s blood ran cold. The phrasing was even more direct than before—no metaphor, no ambiguity. This was a statement. A final word. And it felt more personal than the others.

“Who is he?” Sam asked, turning back to Mia.

Mia replied, her voice tight. “He's a local music producer. No criminal record, no ties to anything shady.”

Sam’s mind raced. Another victim. Another puzzle piece. But this time, there was something more—something different about the note. It wasn’t just a cryptic message. It was an accusation. A condemnation. The killer had left a deliberate mark, but the victim didn’t feel like an innocent bystander. It felt... deliberate.

Mia glanced at Sam, her eyes searching his face. “What do you think, Sam?”

He shook his head, still staring at the note. “I think... this is connected. This isn’t just some random act of violence. This is our guy.”

“What do you mean, ‘our guy’?” Mia asked, confused.

“The Speaker,” Sam said, the name suddenly slipping from his lips. The killer was now becoming something more an identity that was taking shape. “This is his work. The rhythm, the phrases, they’re all part of the same pattern. The Speaker doesn’t just kill. He sends messages.”

Mia blinked, processing. “The Speaker? Really that name?”

“Yes,” Sam replied, voice steady. “This Killer he's escalating. Each time, the phrases get bolder, more direct. ‘The Voice That Died.’ It’s not a coincidence.”

Mia stepped back, looking at the body again. “We need to notify the higher-ups. This changes everything.”

Sam nodded, but his mind was already far ahead. “I already took care of it.”

Meanwhile, miles away, David sat in front of his computer, his fingers moving quickly over the keys. He’d just seen the news about the latest murder—Eric Lane. He couldn’t explain why, but something clicked when he heard the victim’s name.

""Eric Lane,"" he whispered to himself. His heart raced as his fingers typed in the search bar.

The more he read about the man, the more certain he became: this wasn’t just another random victim. This was part of something bigger. Something he had been chasing for months.

David’s eyes flicked to the corkboard on his wall, still covered in case files, pins, and yarn connecting names and dates. And there it was: in a cut newspaper ""Orphan Child Eric Lane, Mother Natasha Lane murder in alley"". He stared at the name. Something in his gut told him this was the moment he’d been waiting for.

The note left with Eric Lane the one David would likely hear about soon—had sealed it for him. The phrase was personal. It wasn’t a message for the world. It was a message for him.

“The Voice That Died.”

The Whisperer talking to him.

For the first time in Years, David felt the pull of the case sharpen. The killer wasn’t just leaving cryptic notes. He was sending messages directly to someone. And David knew, instinctively, that he was the one being spoken to.

This wasn’t just about finding answers anymore. This was about understanding the message.

And David was starting to realize that The Whisperer wanted him to hear it.

Chapter 9: Through the Echoes

The alley was colder than it should’ve been.

Sam Carter stood at the scene long after the forensics team had packed up. The body was gone. The blood had been washed into the gutter. But the echo of it—that moment still lingered in the air.

He stared at the brick wall where Eric Lane’s body had slumped, the taped note now sitting in an evidence bag inside his coat pocket.

""The Voice That Died"".

A phrase that didn’t just sound poetic—it sounded intentional. Like the others.

He knew the other cases were connected. He was sure of it now. But this one? This one was louder, Bolder.

""Pull all security footage from within a three-block radius,"" Sam had told a patrol officer earlier that evening. ""I want everything. Street cams. Doorbell cams. I don’t care if it’s grainy—I want it.""

Hours later, inside the precinct’s cramped AV room, he sat in front of a bank of monitors as footage flickered past in silence.

He was on his third cup of coffee and his fifth hour of footage when he finally saw it.

At first, it looked like nothing. Just a crowd forming behind the police tape, faces turned to flashing lights, some filming on their phones. Normal.

But then there. In the corner of one camera’s wide lens.

A figure. Still. Watching.

Not reacting. Not recording. Just present.

The timestamp was 8:12 p.m.—minutes after the scene had been secured. The man was standing half in shadow, his face obscured beneath the hood of a black jacket, the light from the patrol car reflecting off his silhouette like a smear of ink.

Sam leaned in, heart quickening. He froze the frame and enhanced it as much as the ancient system allowed.

No clear face.

But the stance was… familiar. Controlled. Deliberate. Everyone else was moving. Talking. Taking photos. This man was still. Focused. Listening.

“Got you,” Sam muttered under his breath.

He printed the frame and pinned it to the corkboard in his office, right next to the notes from the other murders.

A new question took shape in his mind—not who is the killer. But how long has he been watching?

Because if he was bold enough to come back to the scene…

He might already know who’s following him.

David hadn’t slept.

The coffee had gone cold hours ago, abandoned beside his laptop as lines of text blinked back at him on the screen. He’d spent the last day spiraling down the dark well of his own archives. Old episodes. Listener tips. Interviews he hadn’t thought about in years.

But it had been the messages that cracked it open.

They had always haunted him, but now, they spoke.

He’d stumbled across a pattern buried in an old spreadsheet he used to track cold cases for a bonus series back in 2022. Back then, they’d seemed disconnected. But now…

and There were two more.

1995 Dallas. A waitress named Emily Monroe. Killed in a parking garage. Shot, execution-style. A note found in her apron pocket: “Whispers carry farther than screams.”

The city had forgotten.

But the killer hadn’t.

David sat back in his chair, staring at the web of cases pinned across his corkboard. He connected them one by one, the red yarn crossing years, lives, and neighborhoods like arteries. A timeline of silence: 1994-98

Then nothing. For two decades, the voices went quiet.

Until 2018.

He didn’t know what woke him back up. But he knew what had happened since. The voice had returned. Subtle at first. Unnoticed. Then louder. Sharper.

Eric Lane was the scream in a long line of whispers.

David’s fingers hovered over his keyboard as he opened a new project folder.

EPISODE 59 – THE WHISPERER

He’d never directly talk to the killer on the episodes. But this one is different.

This wasn’t just another story.

It was a revelation.

For the first time, the city would hear it. Every clue. Every name. Every echo left behind.

A serial killer was moving through their streets.

And David was about to say his name.

He reached for the mic.

Paused.

Took a breath.

And hit record.

Chapter 9: The Silence Breaks

David

The mic blinked red—recording.

David leaned forward, voice low, calm, but electric with tension.

“You’re about to hear something I’ve never done on this podcast before. Not just a case. Not just a story. But a pattern. A voice moving beneath the noise, between the lines of our lives. This isn’t just a killer. This is something else. Something… calculated. I call him The Whisperer.”

His fingers swept across the desk, papers fanned out in controlled chaos—autopsy reports, newspaper clippings, police transcripts, and faded photocopies. Names that had once been just cases were now connected like lines in a song. Regina McClain, Madison Rios, Deborah Ann King, Jessica Nguyen, Mia Bell, Eric Lane And before them Emily Monroe, Natasha Lane, Ashley...

“Every year since 2018, someone has died under nearly identical circumstances—public setting, single gunshot, minimal evidence, no motive, and always… always… a message.”

David reached for the printed notes, one by one, his voice steady as he read:
""He hears you""
“Paint me in silence""
""The Echo That Bled""
""Echoes don’t lie""
""Your voice woke me""
""The Voice That Died""
And from the past...
""Whispers carry farther than screams""


“These are not random words. They’re verses. And together, they build a voice—a voice trying to be heard.”

David paused the recording, hand frozen above a file he hadn’t touched in months: Cassandra Serna. His mother.

He hesitated, then opened it.

A chill ran through him.

He'd looked through the file a hundred times before, but something—something about the other notes—had reoriented his mind. He scanned her crime scene photos again. The autopsy report. The inventory list.

Then he saw it.

A battered hardback of her and his favorite BOOK strange ritual from childhood. It had been cataloged, but dismissed by police as unrelated. But now, David noticed something else. In the inside cover, written in delicate but deliberate hand:

“She recite to him. I listened, too.”

He blinked.

“No…”

It had never stood out before. It was too small, too vague. It hadn’t even made it into the official report summary. But now—it screamed.

It matched. Not just in tone. In style. In ritual.

His mother hadn’t been the first episode. She had been the origin.

He hit record again, voice low, shaking:

“My mother, Cassandra Serna, was killed in 1994. She is the reason I started this podcast. But maybe… maybe it’s the reason he did. Because she wasn’t just a victim. She might’ve been his first.”

His voice cracked but didn’t break.

“I’ve been chasing him without realizing he started with me.”

He finished the episode in one breathless hour, every word more urgent than the last. The story twisted together, and by the time he hit upload, the city outside his window was beginning to wake.

By noon, it was everywhere.

Local news latched on first. Headlines blinked across the web:

UNHEARD NO MORE: PODCASTER CLAIMS SERIAL KILLER ACTIVE FOR SIX YEARS

‘THE WHISPERER’: AUDIO JOURNALIST CONNECTS UNSOLVED MURDERS

IS THERE A SERIAL KILLER IN DALLAS?

David didn’t check his messages. His inbox was already swamped. Journalists, listeners, anonymous names with half-whispered tips.

The dam had broken.

At police station

Sam was in the evidence room when Torres found him.

""Hey,"" she said, stepping into the doorway. ""You need to hear something.""

Sam didn’t look up from the folder he was flipping through. “What is it?”

“You ever listen to Unheard Voices?”

He finally glanced at her. “The podcast? Yeah. Couple episodes.”

“Well, you’re gonna want to listen to the new one.” She slide her phone thru the table, the episode already queued. “It dropped a few hours ago. It’s… about our case.”

Sam raised an eyebrow. “What do you mean, our case?”

Torres nodded toward the phone. “Hit play.”

He did.

The first words froze him in place.

“I call him The Whisperer.”

Sam sat down, silent.

The voice was calm, practiced. But the content? Explosive. The episode covered everything—victim timelines, matching methods, the cryptic messages—and then it went deeper. Names, counties, years.

And then… Cassandra Serna.

His eyes narrowed.

“My mother…”

He rewound that part and listened again.

The podcaster wasn’t just a random conspiracy guy. He was personally connected.

Sam turned to Torres. “Who the hell is this guy?”

She shook her head. “We’re looking. Nothing public. Just a name. David Serna.”

“Get his file. Everything he’s posted. Every episode. I want a list of every case he’s touched.”

Torres nodded. “Already on it.”

Sam leaned back, the chill creeping up his spine. Whoever this guy was he had just done what the police hadn’t. He hadn’t solved it. But he’d lit a match.

And now the whole city was watching the flame.

The Echo

He was seated in the back of a corner café when he pressed play.

Headphones in. Hood up. A cup of coffee untouched.

He listened, expression still, eyes lowered to the tabletop.

The voice came through.

“I call him The Whisperer.”

A small smile formed.

“He’s left messages in every murder each one building on the last, like notes in a score…”

He tilted his head, listening not just to the words, but to the tone. To the fear beneath them. The awe.

But then the reveal.

“Cassandra Serna... my mother…”

The smile faded.

He remember her.

(Flashback)

Cassandra.

The last time he saw her.

It was late summer of '94.

They had met at a gallery. She was standing still in front of a Rothko paint and whispered, “This reminds me of insomnia.” Then turned to him, a smile curling at the edges of her voice. “Not deep. Just true.”

He asked her out. She agreed.

He’d picked her up for dinner, something casual. She opened the door wearing denim and soft laughter, the kind that settled into a room without asking permission.

He remembered the house modest, warm, humming with old music and the scent of lavender.

And the boy.

David.

Eight, maybe nine. Big eyes, dark hair, holding ""the book"" too large for his lap. the stereo behind him, something played a delicate orchestral swell, strings dancing just above a piano line. Not pop. Not jazz. Classical.

It surprised him.

“This is David,” she’d said with that quiet pride. “My son.”

The boy looked up at him, unreadable, curious—but cautious. He nodded, didn’t smile.

He knelt to meet him eye to eye.

“Hey there,” the Whisperer had said softly, something gentle in his voice he hadn’t known he could still find. “You like stories?”

David had nodded, then pointed toward the speakers without saying a word.

“And music,” Cassandra added, brushing a hand through her son’s hair. “Mostly classical. He’s obsessed with symphonies. Beethoven, Tchaikovsky, even Mahler. He says it helps him see the books in his head.”

""it's that right?"" The Whisperer replied looking to him.

The boy said. “Mama says symphonies are like stories without words.”

“And do you believe her?”

The boy nodded. “She doesn’t lie.”

The Whisperer hadn’t understood the weight of that moment until now.

He glanced at the stereo. The movement rising. A tension building, then breaking.

It wasn’t just music.

It was a narrative without words.

David looked back at the book, flipping a page with quiet purpose, the music swelling behind him.

The Echo remembered the way the two things sound and story folded into each other in that small room.

He hadn’t planned it back then. Not yet.

But something inside him had already started to shift.

the date itself was remarkable, until it wasn’t.

Wine, pasta, conversation that dipped and returned like waves under cloud lights. She spoke about poetry, myths, grief. She talked about silence as though it were a country she’d once lived in.

He didn’t feel love, not the way people imagined it. But interest. Curiosity. And Cassandra she had mystery. She wasn’t like the others. She didn’t fear silence. She moved inside it.

But as the night wore on, something in her changed.

Not suddenly. Gradually.

Her eyes grew quieter. Her body stiffer. Her laugh lost its echo.

It was during dessert, chocolate and strawberries and a shared glass of cabernet; when she looked at him as if something had peeled away.

A layer she hadn’t seen before. Or hadn’t wanted to.

She didn’t say anything in the moment. Not directly.

The night ended normally. A polite goodbye. No invitation inside. Just a hand on the doorknob and a long silence between them.

But in that silence, she looked him in the eye and said:

""You carry something within you""

He stare quietly.

She added, with a faint shake of her head, “But I don’t want it near my son and I think we’re too different. Thank you for the evening. Take care.”

And with that, she gently closed the door.

Remembered the echo of her words like they were meant for who he truly was.

Weeks passed.

And then he found her again.

Not at home. Not with her son nearby. Somewhere quieter. Somewhere no one would look.

She hadn’t screamed.

She just looked at him and said:

“I knew you’d come back.”

And when she fell, The something slipped from her bag.

A book she always carried.

He opened the cover and wrote inside it, not for her.

For the boy.

“She recite to him. I listened, too.”

He leaned back slowly as the episode continued, hearing the story of himself told by the boy.

Not The Whisperer. Not to him.

He didn’t call himself that.

No, he had always saw himself as…

Chapter 10: Echoes in the Blood

Sam

The Station was buzzing.

The murder of Eric Lane had already stirred tension. But now—with that podcast episode going viral—the pressure had turned suffocating. Calls were coming down from city officials, federal agencies were sniffing around, and the press circled like sharks. This wasn’t just a murder anymore.

It was a pattern. A voice. A myth in the making.

Sam stood in front of the case board, red string connecting six photos. Four recent victims. and the ones from the ‘90s. And in the center: a note card, pinned in thick black ink—

“The Whisperer?”

He muttered under his breath. “Still don’t like that name.”

Torres stepped in, holding fresh stills. “Got something. Surveillance footage from a liquor store across the street from the alley where Eric Lane died.”

She dropped them on the table.

A shape. No face. But a presence.

A tall figure. Long coat. Hood drawn. The silhouette hovered near the edge of the crowd. Never looked at the camera. Barely moved. Like a shadow waiting for its cue.

Sam exhaled slowly. “He was there.”

“We ran it through recognition software,” Torres said. “No matches. But the time stamp checks out. He was there before we arrived. He watched us.”

Sam stared at the blurry image longer than necessary.

Then: “He makes mistakes when he wants to be seen.”

Torres raised a brow. “What’s that supposed to mean?”

“He’s sending a message. Not just with the victims. With his presence. He doesn’t just kill. He performs. He wants an audience.”

Torres hesitated. “And David? The podcaster?”

Sam rubbed the back of his neck. “We’ve traced the podcast to an LLC registered out of state. Clean. Too clean. No socials. No address. He’s covering his tracks, but we’ll find him.”

“You think he’s involved?”

“No,” Sam said. Then, quieter: “But he’s inside this. Deep. If he’s right about his mother... this started long before we noticed. And he’s not just telling the story anymore—he’s part of it.”

David

The sun had set an hour ago, but David hadn’t noticed.

It hit him differently tonight. Not as evidence. But as memory.

It wasn’t just a cryptic phrase.

It was... personal.

The killer had written it for someone. Not the cops. Not the world.

For him.

He could see flashes now—his mother’s voice reading aloud, soft and low. His own head resting in her lap, a book open under the dim yellow lamp. And maybe—just maybe—a stranger once sitting too quietly nearby. Watching. Listening.

His stomach turned.

The killer wasn’t announcing himself back then.

He was... remembering.

David turned slowly to his mic. His hand hovered.

Then he pressed record.

His voice was quieter than usual. No introduction. No drama. Just truth.

“My mother wasn’t just the first victim. She was the first verse. The first name in a pattern I didn’t understand until now. And someone has been listening to me since before I ever spoke into this mic.”

He exhaled.

“He was there. Not just in the alley. Not just in the case files. In my life. I think I met him. Once. I just don’t remember well.”

The Whisperer

He stood in the alley where Eric Lane had died.

No one expected him to return. Not this soon. Not while the yellow tape still fluttered like dead ribbon. Not while the scent of bleach and blood clung to the bricks.

But this place—like so many before—was part of the performance.

A verse.

They called him many names now. The Whisperer. The Speaker. The Killer in Silence.

But none of them knew the truth.

He wasn’t telling a story.

He was finishing one.

He pulled a small slip of paper from his coat and unfolded it. A phrase already written. Measured. Clean. A whisper caught in ink:

“There a painless death awaits him who can no longer bear the sorrows of this life”

He left the paper where the body of Eric laid, then slipped on his headphones.

The podcast played again.

He wasn’t sure why he kept listening. Maybe to feel seen. Or maybe to see how much David had remembered.

And tonight… he had remembered too much.

The Keeper smiled faintly as the alley swallowed him again.

The echo was growing louder.

And the boy was finally listening.

Chapter 6: The New Echo

Detective Samuel “Sam” Carter stood in front of the grimy window of the precinct’s break room, staring out at the city. His reflection barely visible in the cracked glass, he could almost taste the dust in the air. Dallas was a place of contradictions: bright lights, big cars, and ambition. But there was a darker side to it, one that seemed to swallow up the truth.

Sam had always been able to see things others couldn’t. From a young age, he could pick up on the threads of people’s lives—the way their stories didn’t quite add up, how details skipped past others unnoticed. It wasn’t always a gift, though. It was more like a curse. Growing up in the foster system, he had learned to read people quickly. You had to, to survive. But over the years, it had sharpened into something more. It was why he was here, assigned to one of the toughest and most thankless departments—cold cases.

Before he became a detective, Sam had spent years on the streets. His sharp eye for detail earned him a reputation, but it wasn’t always for the right reasons. Some people called him obsessive. Some called him a workaholic. But after seeing so many cases go cold, he became determined to fix what was broken. That’s how he ended up with this assignment—fresh out of a few rough years working narcotics and violent crimes. The brass saw something in him, something they thought could bring fresh blood to the department’s oldest, most unsolvable mysteries.

“Hey, Carter. The DA wants to see you in her office,” a voice said behind him.

Sam turned to see his new partner, Detective Mia Torres, standing in the doorway. Mia had been on the force longer than him, but they’d only just been paired up. She was quiet, focused, and had a reputation for solving cases that others had given up on. Her sharp mind and dry humor made her a good fit for a guy like Sam.

""Got it,"" he said, pushing off the counter and following her through the narrow hallway of the precinct. He hadn’t expected a warm welcome, cold cases weren’t sexy, after all—but he wasn’t here for applause. He was here to dig up the bones buried deep under the city’s surface.

They reached the DA’s office, and the door swung open before Sam could knock. Inside, District Attorney Veronica Palmer sat behind her desk, a sharp woman in her late forties with dark eyes that didn’t miss a thing. To her right stood Chief of Police Reginald Moore, a towering figure who had seen his share of battles in the city’s criminal underworld.

Sam greeted them with a curt nod.

“Carter,” Palmer said, her voice smooth but firm. “I hear you’ve been looking into some of our cold cases. We’ve got some files stacked up, and frankly, we need someone who can see things others miss.”

“I don’t miss much,” Sam replied, his tone just as serious. “I’ve been going through the oldest cases. There are patterns in these things—if you look closely.”

Chief Moore leaned forward, his deep voice rumbling. “We know. But these cases are dead in the water. If anyone could’ve solved them, they would have. You’re not here to waste your time on ghosts, Carter. We need answers. You’re not just chasing old leads. We need closure for these families.”

Sam paused, eyeing the two of them. He could tell that the DA wasn’t just talking about the victims, but about herself. Palmer had spent years trying to bring justice to families, but even she knew the cold case files were a black hole.

“I understand,” Sam said. “But sometimes the truth is hiding in plain sight. It’s just a matter of connecting the dots. Let me dig into the cold cases, and I’ll find something. I’ll find connections.”

Mia’s expression softened a fraction. She knew Sam’s reputation for seeing patterns when others couldn’t. He wasn’t like most detectives. He didn’t just see a string of disjointed incidents. He saw the flow, the way things bled together, connecting across time and space.

“Do what you need to do,” Palmer said. “But just know—no one here is holding their breath for a miracle. The mayor’s breathing down our necks to close some of these, and we don’t have time for wild goose chases.”

Sam nodded. He wasn’t after miracles. Just answers.

Hours later, Sam sat in his small office, the door cracked open to the bullpen beyond. His desk was piled high with files, photos, and handwritten notes. Cold cases. Files from the last five years. His fingers traced over the names—victims who had once been someone’s daughter, sister, friend. People who’d vanished without a trace, leaving behind nothing but an unsolved case number.

His eyes drifted to a file that had been sitting on the corner of his desk for days. It was marked with a single name: Madison Rios. He opened the file and scanned through the details—art major, college senior, found dead in a stairwell downtown. A case that had never been solved, and one of the more recent ones.

Then, as his eyes flicked over the crime scene photos, he noticed something strange. A torn page from a sketchbook, almost buried under a pile of forensic reports. The words written there caught his attention:

""Paint me in silence.""

He froze.

That wasn’t like any note a killer would leave.

Sam’s fingers moved swiftly as he flipped through the file, now hype focused. Another victim. Deborah Ann King, a warehouse worker found behind an old theater. A folded note in her jacket read:

""The Echo That Bled.""

He leaned back in his chair, feeling a stir of unease in his chest. The cases weren’t connected by just the method of killing—there was something else. A message.

He flipped to the next case in the pile: Jessica Nguyen. The receipt tucked into her boot said:

""Echoes don’t lie.""

And finally, Mia Bell—her case not even a year old. Her final note:

""Your voice woke me.""

His heart skipped a beat.

Sam knew a pattern when he saw one. These weren’t random. These weren’t just victim statements. These were messages. The same tone. The same rhythm.

He opened a new document on his laptop, typing the names, the phrases, and the dates.

Madison – 2019
Deborah – 2020
Jessica – 2021
Mia – 2022

The rhythm was undeniable. One each year, each with a message.

It was clear now—these cases were connected.

Sam stared at the screen, his mind racing. He wasn’t sure who had been behind the killings yet, but he was certain of one thing: these weren’t isolated incidents.

He reached for the phone, dialing the DA’s office. His gut was telling him something was about to break wide open. It was time to talk to the higher-ups.

“Carter,” Palmer answered, a hint of impatience in her tone.

“I think I’m onto something,” Sam said, his voice low but urgent. “There’s a pattern. It’s not just random. These cases are connected, and I need resources to track down whoever's behind them. We can’t let this slip through our fingers.”

There was a pause on the other end.

“Meet me in my office. Now,” Palmer said, her voice firm. “And bring your findings.”

Sam’s stomach tightened. He had no doubt that what he was about to present would change everything. He didn’t yet know who David was, or that his podcast had been following the same trail, but in this moment, the path he was following felt like it had just crossed into dangerous territory.

He grabbed the files and stood, the weight of what he was about to uncover settling over him like a heavy coat. It was time to connect the dots.

Chapter 7: The Echo's Keeper

on the other side of town

The night air was thick with the sounds of distant traffic, the hum of a city that never truly slept. 

Eric Lane.

He’d been watching him for weeks. The music producer with the warm smile and the easy laugh. Too loud for a man so ordinary, too quiet in all the wrong places.

The Keeper saw much of Eric he remember him, his voice once a child now a man. His eyes had already mapped out the contours of the man’s life, like an artist sketching the outline of a figure they would never paint. Eric was nothing more than a note in the melody, another victim, another piece of the puzzle.

The Keeper had always been a listener. He had to be. It was the only way to hear the truth. The unseen whispers, the forgotten cries, the voices that had no place in the world—those were the ones that mattered.

It had all begun with Regina. A ghost in a world that didn’t care to remember her. The Echo hadn’t meant to start with her again, but when he’d heard the name ""Cassandra"", a forgotten truth in David's voice, something had shifted. Someone had finally noticed.

It was the same with Eric. The man’s life was a record, playing in the background of the city’s noise. A life of quiet routine and saddened past. But it was the cracks in the surface that mattered. He was starting to fade, slipping through the cracks, unnoticed. And that was the moment the killer had chosen him. Not for what he was, but for what he could become.

Eric had a soft voice, melodic hum that carried under the surface. There was a song buried in him. The Echo had heard it the first time he’d walked past the music studio it remind him of child he knew talking to the TV news about his late mother, the faint echoes of sound slipping out into the night. Not much. But enough to know.

A victim is never just a victim. Not to the killer. They’re a bridge. A bridge to something greater. A message.

The night had come. The stars had watched as he followed Eric’s familiar path, his footsteps echoing softly against the cracked pavement. The killer was careful, patient. He knew the rhythm of the streets. He had learned it over the time, watching, waiting for the right moment. He wasn’t like the others. He didn’t rush. He didn’t force the world into his design.

Eric had stopped near a dark alley, and the Whisperer had seen his chance. He’d been prepared—he always was. The silent step, the quiet presence. A note, folded and waiting. One message.

And then, just like that, Eric had been taken. No violence, no unnecessary struggle. Just silence. The silence that had been written. The killer had left him there, alone, cold, with a message.

""The Voice That Died"".

But that wasn’t the end. The killer wasn’t finished yet. There was still more to do. He watched as the police arrived, the red and blue lights flashing in the distance. They were slow, taking their time, walking over the familiar ground that he knew better than anyone. They didn’t hear the voices.

But he did.

He stood at the edge of the crowd, distant, observing. The investigators were busy. The detective with the dark eyes—Sam Carter—was already there, examining the scene. The killer knew the man. He had heard his name in the news ""New detective assign to  cold cases in the Dallas area"". Sam Carter. Another listener, another seeker. They were alike, but not the same. The Whisperer smiled quietly to himself.

And then, in the midst of the chaos, the keeper slipped a pair of earbuds into his ears, the sounds of the night blending with the soft hum of the latest episode of David’s podcast.

The episode was nothing out of the ordinary, a typical dive into the unspoken stories of the city's darker corners. David’s voice, smooth and calculated, filled his mind as he stood there, blending with the crowd.

As Sam Carter crouched beside Eric’s lifeless body, the killer couldn’t help but hear the echo of the moment—the final note in the long, quiet composition.

The sirens faded into the night.

but the whispers continued.

Chapter 8: The Voice That Called Him

Moments before the attack

Sam stood before the DA’s desk, the file spread out in front of him like a collection of loose threads waiting to be woven together. Palmer’s sharp gaze never wavered as she scanned through the notes, while Chief Moore leaned against the wall, arms folded across his chest.

“This is what I’ve got,” Sam said, his voice steady despite the adrenaline that buzzed in his chest. “There are five cases. Four victims. All connected by a series of cryptic phrases—each one left behind by the killer in a way that can’t be coincidence.”

Palmer raised an eyebrow. “Cryptic phrases?”

“Messages,” Sam continued. “Regina McClain, Madison Rios, Deborah Ann King, Jessica Nguyen, and Mia Bell. Each case had a strange note. These weren’t just random, off-the-cuff statements. These were deliberate. They’re almost poetic.”

He flipped through the file, showing them the lines one by one.

“Paint me in silence” He paused, glancing at both of them. ""He hears you"" “The Echo That Bled"" ""Echoes don’t lie"" And ""Your voice woke me"".

Chief Moore frowned, pushing off from the wall. “So, we’ve got a Serial killer leaving cryptic messages, but Why?”

Sam’s eyes met his. “The pattern is clear. Each victim was chosen carefully, each method precise. No sign of forced entry, no sexual assault, no robbery. Just death. But it’s the rhythm that’s important—one victim a year, the notes each year building upon the last.”

“The first was in 2018,” Sam continued, pointing to the timeline on his digital map. “Then 2019, 2020, 2021, and now 2022. The killer’s following a schedule, and it’s methodical. The notes themselves have a consistent tone, almost like they’re speaking to someone... or something.”

“And you think all of this points to the same killer?” Palmer asked, her voice low, skeptical.

“I’m not just guessing,” Sam said, tapping the screen. “These phrases? They’re connected. They’re almost like parts of a riddle, a puzzle that only the killer understands. It’s not random. It’s deliberate. There’s someone out there sending a message, and if we don’t catch it now, the next victim could be right around the corner.”

There was a long pause as the DA and Chief Moore exchanged a look. Palmer finally broke the silence.

“Alright, Carter,” she said, leaning back in her chair. “We’ll give you the resources. But you better have something concrete. We’ve been chasing ghosts for too long, and the mayor wants results.”

Sam nodded, his jaw set. He’d seen how cold cases could drag on, how bureaucracy could grind down any hope of progress. But this wasn’t just another case. He could feel it in his bones. This was different.

Before he could say more, his phone buzzed on the table. he saw the caller ID—Detective Torres.

He picked up immediately.

“Carter,” Mia’s voice crackled through the receiver, sharp with urgency. “You need to get to the scene. Now.”

“What happened?” Sam asked, his pulse quickening.

“It’s... it’s a murder, Sam. A man was found dead in an alley, and there’s something... strange about it. The victim’s name is Eric Lane.”

Sam’s mind raced, but he kept his voice steady. “Eric Lane. What’s strange about it?”

“I don’t know yet, but the body’s—there’s something odd. A note was found with him. I need you here, Sam.”

Sam’s stomach twisted. He knew this could be nothing. But it also could be everything. He didn’t have time to waste.

“I’m on my way.”

an hour later...

The sun had barely begun to dip behind the skyline as Sam pulled up to the crime scene. The flashing blue and red lights bathed the alley in an eerie glow, casting shadows that stretched long across the pavement. A small crowd of onlookers was being held back by uniformed officers, and the air was thick with tension.

Mia stood near the edge of the scene, her expression grim.

“Where’s the body?” Sam asked, scanning the area.

“Over here,” Mia said, leading him to the far end of the alley. The victim was a man in his mid-thirties, his body slumped against the side of a dumpster, the life drained from him. His clothes were nondescript, nothing that stood out as unusual. But what caught Sam’s attention immediately was the note—this time, it was taped to the man’s chest.

He pulled the note free with gloved hands and held it up. The message was stark, clear, and chilling:

“The Voice That Died.”

Sam’s blood ran cold. The phrasing was even more direct than before—no metaphor, no ambiguity. This was a statement. A final word. And it felt more personal than the others.

“Who is he?” Sam asked, turning back to Mia.

Mia replied, her voice tight. “He's a local music producer. No criminal record, no ties to anything shady.”

Sam’s mind raced. Another victim. Another puzzle piece. But this time, there was something more—something different about the note. It wasn’t just a cryptic message. It was an accusation. A condemnation. The killer had left a deliberate mark, but the victim didn’t feel like an innocent bystander. It felt... deliberate.

Mia glanced at Sam, her eyes searching his face. “What do you think, Sam?”

He shook his head, still staring at the note. “I think... this is connected. This isn’t just some random act of violence. This is our guy.”

“What do you mean, ‘our guy’?” Mia asked, confused.

“The Speaker,” Sam said, the name suddenly slipping from his lips. The killer was now becoming something more an identity that was taking shape. “This is his work. The rhythm, the phrases, they’re all part of the same pattern. The Speaker doesn’t just kill. He sends messages.”

Mia blinked, processing. “The Speaker? Really that name?”

“Yes,” Sam replied, voice steady. “This Killer he's escalating. Each time, the phrases get bolder, more direct. ‘The Voice That Died.’ It’s not a coincidence.”

Mia stepped back, looking at the body again. “We need to notify the higher-ups. This changes everything.”

Sam nodded, but his mind was already far ahead. “I already took care of it.”

Meanwhile, miles away, David sat in front of his computer, his fingers moving quickly over the keys. He’d just seen the news about the latest murder—Eric Lane. He couldn’t explain why, but something clicked when he heard the victim’s name.

""Eric Lane,"" he whispered to himself. His heart raced as his fingers typed in the search bar.

The more he read about the man, the more certain he became: this wasn’t just another random victim. This was part of something bigger. Something he had been chasing for months.

David’s eyes flicked to the corkboard on his wall, still covered in case files, pins, and yarn connecting names and dates. And there it was: in a cut newspaper ""Orphan Child Eric Lane, Mother Natasha Lane murder in alley"". He stared at the name. Something in his gut told him this was the moment he’d been waiting for.

The note left with Eric Lane the one David would likely hear about soon—had sealed it for him. The phrase was personal. It wasn’t a message for the world. It was a message for him.

“The Voice That Died.”

The Whisperer talking to him.

For the first time in Years, David felt the pull of the case sharpen. The killer wasn’t just leaving cryptic notes. He was sending messages directly to someone. And David knew, instinctively, that he was the one being spoken to.

This wasn’t just about finding answers anymore. This was about understanding the message.

And David was starting to realize that The Whisperer wanted him to hear it.

Chapter 9: Through the Echoes

The alley was colder than it should’ve been.

Sam Carter stood at the scene long after the forensics team had packed up. The body was gone. The blood had been washed into the gutter. But the echo of it—that moment still lingered in the air.

He stared at the brick wall where Eric Lane’s body had slumped, the taped note now sitting in an evidence bag inside his coat pocket.

""The Voice That Died"".

A phrase that didn’t just sound poetic—it sounded intentional. Like the others.

He knew the other cases were connected. He was sure of it now. But this one? This one was louder, Bolder.

""Pull all security footage from within a three-block radius,"" Sam had told a patrol officer earlier that evening. ""I want everything. Street cams. Doorbell cams. I don’t care if it’s grainy—I want it.""

Hours later, inside the precinct’s cramped AV room, he sat in front of a bank of monitors as footage flickered past in silence.

He was on his third cup of coffee and his fifth hour of footage when he finally saw it.

At first, it looked like nothing. Just a crowd forming behind the police tape, faces turned to flashing lights, some filming on their phones. Normal.

But then there. In the corner of one camera’s wide lens.

A figure. Still. Watching.

Not reacting. Not recording. Just present.

The timestamp was 8:12 p.m.—minutes after the scene had been secured. The man was standing half in shadow, his face obscured beneath the hood of a black jacket, the light from the patrol car reflecting off his silhouette like a smear of ink.

Sam leaned in, heart quickening. He froze the frame and enhanced it as much as the ancient system allowed.

No clear face.

But the stance was… familiar. Controlled. Deliberate. Everyone else was moving. Talking. Taking photos. This man was still. Focused. Listening.

“Got you,” Sam muttered under his breath.

He printed the frame and pinned it to the corkboard in his office, right next to the notes from the other murders.

A new question took shape in his mind—not who is the killer. But how long has he been watching?

Because if he was bold enough to come back to the scene…

He might already know who’s following him.

David hadn’t slept.

The coffee had gone cold hours ago, abandoned beside his laptop as lines of text blinked back at him on the screen. He’d spent the last day spiraling down the dark well of his own archives. Old episodes. Listener tips. Interviews he hadn’t thought about in years.

But it had been the messages that cracked it open.

They had always haunted him, but now, they spoke.

He’d stumbled across a pattern buried in an old spreadsheet he used to track cold cases for a bonus series back in 2022. Back then, they’d seemed disconnected. But now…

and There were two more.

1995 Dallas. A waitress named Emily Monroe. Killed in a parking garage. Shot, execution-style. A note found in her apron pocket: “Whispers carry farther than screams.”

The city had forgotten.

But the killer hadn’t.

David sat back in his chair, staring at the web of cases pinned across his corkboard. He connected them one by one, the red yarn crossing years, lives, and neighborhoods like arteries. A timeline of silence: 1994-98

Then nothing. For two decades, the voices went quiet.

Until 2018.

He didn’t know what woke him back up. But he knew what had happened since. The voice had returned. Subtle at first. Unnoticed. Then louder. Sharper.

Eric Lane was the scream in a long line of whispers.

David’s fingers hovered over his keyboard as he opened a new project folder.

EPISODE 59 – THE WHISPERER

He’d never directly talk to the killer on the episodes. But this one is different.

This wasn’t just another story.

It was a revelation.

For the first time, the city would hear it. Every clue. Every name. Every echo left behind.

A serial killer was moving through their streets.

And David was about to say his name.

He reached for the mic.

Paused.

Took a breath.

And hit record.

Chapter 9: The Silence Breaks

David

The mic blinked red—recording.

David leaned forward, voice low, calm, but electric with tension.

“You’re about to hear something I’ve never done on this podcast before. Not just a case. Not just a story. But a pattern. A voice moving beneath the noise, between the lines of our lives. This isn’t just a killer. This is something else. Something… calculated. I call him The Whisperer.”

His fingers swept across the desk, papers fanned out in controlled chaos—autopsy reports, newspaper clippings, police transcripts, and faded photocopies. Names that had once been just cases were now connected like lines in a song. Regina McClain, Madison Rios, Deborah Ann King, Jessica Nguyen, Mia Bell, Eric Lane And before them Emily Monroe, Natasha Lane, Ashley...

“Every year since 2018, someone has died under nearly identical circumstances—public setting, single gunshot, minimal evidence, no motive, and always… always… a message.”

David reached for the printed notes, one by one, his voice steady as he read:
""He hears you""
“Paint me in silence""
""The Echo That Bled""
""Echoes don’t lie""
""Your voice woke me""
""The Voice That Died""
And from the past...
""Whispers carry farther than screams""


“These are not random words. They’re verses. And together, they build a voice—a voice trying to be heard.”

David paused the recording, hand frozen above a file he hadn’t touched in months: Cassandra Serna. His mother.

He hesitated, then opened it.

A chill ran through him.

He'd looked through the file a hundred times before, but something—something about the other notes—had reoriented his mind. He scanned her crime scene photos again. The autopsy report. The inventory list.

Then he saw it.

A battered hardback of her and his favorite BOOK strange ritual from childhood. It had been cataloged, but dismissed by police as unrelated. But now, David noticed something else. In the inside cover, written in delicate but deliberate hand:

“She recite to him. I listened, too.”

He blinked.

“No…”

It had never stood out before. It was too small, too vague. It hadn’t even made it into the official report summary. But now—it screamed.

It matched. Not just in tone. In style. In ritual.

His mother hadn’t been the first episode. She had been the origin.

He hit record again, voice low, shaking:

“My mother, Cassandra Serna, was killed in 1994. She is the reason I started this podcast. But maybe… maybe it’s the reason he did. Because she wasn’t just a victim. She might’ve been his first.”

His voice cracked but didn’t break.

“I’ve been chasing him without realizing he started with me.”

He finished the episode in one breathless hour, every word more urgent than the last. The story twisted together, and by the time he hit upload, the city outside his window was beginning to wake.

By noon, it was everywhere.

Local news latched on first. Headlines blinked across the web:

UNHEARD NO MORE: PODCASTER CLAIMS SERIAL KILLER ACTIVE FOR SIX YEARS

‘THE WHISPERER’: AUDIO JOURNALIST CONNECTS UNSOLVED MURDERS

IS THERE A SERIAL KILLER IN DALLAS?

David didn’t check his messages. His inbox was already swamped. Journalists, listeners, anonymous names with half-whispered tips.

The dam had broken.

At police station

Sam was in the evidence room when Torres found him.

""Hey,"" she said, stepping into the doorway. ""You need to hear something.""

Sam didn’t look up from the folder he was flipping through. “What is it?”

“You ever listen to Unheard Voices?”

He finally glanced at her. “The podcast? Yeah. Couple episodes.”

“Well, you’re gonna want to listen to the new one.” She slide her phone thru the table, the episode already queued. “It dropped a few hours ago. It’s… about our case.”

Sam raised an eyebrow. “What do you mean, our case?”

Torres nodded toward the phone. “Hit play.”

He did.

The first words froze him in place.

“I call him The Whisperer.”

Sam sat down, silent.

The voice was calm, practiced. But the content? Explosive. The episode covered everything—victim timelines, matching methods, the cryptic messages—and then it went deeper. Names, counties, years.

And then… Cassandra Serna.

His eyes narrowed.

“My mother…”

He rewound that part and listened again.

The podcaster wasn’t just a random conspiracy guy. He was personally connected.

Sam turned to Torres. “Who the hell is this guy?”

She shook her head. “We’re looking. Nothing public. Just a name. David Serna.”

“Get his file. Everything he’s posted. Every episode. I want a list of every case he’s touched.”

Torres nodded. “Already on it.”

Sam leaned back, the chill creeping up his spine. Whoever this guy was he had just done what the police hadn’t. He hadn’t solved it. But he’d lit a match.

And now the whole city was watching the flame.

The Echo

He was seated in the back of a corner café when he pressed play.

Headphones in. Hood up. A cup of coffee untouched.

He listened, expression still, eyes lowered to the tabletop.

The voice came through.

“I call him The Whisperer.”

A small smile formed.

“He’s left messages in every murder each one building on the last, like notes in a score…”

He tilted his head, listening not just to the words, but to the tone. To the fear beneath them. The awe.

But then the reveal.

“Cassandra Serna... my mother…”

The smile faded.

He remember her.

(Flashback)

Cassandra.

The last time he saw her.

It was late summer of '94.

They had met at a gallery. She was standing still in front of a Rothko paint and whispered, “This reminds me of insomnia.” Then turned to him, a smile curling at the edges of her voice. “Not deep. Just true.”

He asked her out. She agreed.

He’d picked her up for dinner, something casual. She opened the door wearing denim and soft laughter, the kind that settled into a room without asking permission.

He remembered the house modest, warm, humming with old music and the scent of lavender.

And the boy.

David.

Eight, maybe nine. Big eyes, dark hair, holding ""the book"" too large for his lap. the stereo behind him, something played a delicate orchestral swell, strings dancing just above a piano line. Not pop. Not jazz. Classical.

It surprised him.

“This is David,” she’d said with that quiet pride. “My son.”

The boy looked up at him, unreadable, curious—but cautious. He nodded, didn’t smile.

He knelt to meet him eye to eye.

“Hey there,” the Whisperer had said softly, something gentle in his voice he hadn’t known he could still find. “You like stories?”

David had nodded, then pointed toward the speakers without saying a word.

“And music,” Cassandra added, brushing a hand through her son’s hair. “Mostly classical. He’s obsessed with symphonies. Beethoven, Tchaikovsky, even Mahler. He says it helps him see the books in his head.”

""it's that right?"" The Whisperer replied looking to him.

The boy said. “Mama says symphonies are like stories without words.”

“And do you believe her?”

The boy nodded. “She doesn’t lie.”

The Whisperer hadn’t understood the weight of that moment until now.

He glanced at the stereo. The movement rising. A tension building, then breaking.

It wasn’t just music.

It was a narrative without words.

David looked back at the book, flipping a page with quiet purpose, the music swelling behind him.

The Echo remembered the way the two things sound and story folded into each other in that small room.

He hadn’t planned it back then. Not yet.

But something inside him had already started to shift.

the date itself was remarkable, until it wasn’t.

Wine, pasta, conversation that dipped and returned like waves under cloud lights. She spoke about poetry, myths, grief. She talked about silence as though it were a country she’d once lived in.

He didn’t feel love, not the way people imagined it. But interest. Curiosity. And Cassandra she had mystery. She wasn’t like the others. She didn’t fear silence. She moved inside it.

But as the night wore on, something in her changed.

Not suddenly. Gradually.

Her eyes grew quieter. Her body stiffer. Her laugh lost its echo.

It was during dessert, chocolate and strawberries and a shared glass of cabernet; when she looked at him as if something had peeled away.

A layer she hadn’t seen before. Or hadn’t wanted to.

She didn’t say anything in the moment. Not directly.

The night ended normally. A polite goodbye. No invitation inside. Just a hand on the doorknob and a long silence between them.

But in that silence, she looked him in the eye and said:

""You carry something within you""

He stare quietly.

She added, with a faint shake of her head, “But I don’t want it near my son and I think we’re too different. Thank you for the evening. Take care.”

And with that, she gently closed the door.

Remembered the echo of her words like they were meant for who he truly was.

Weeks passed.

And then he found her again.

Not at home. Not with her son nearby. Somewhere quieter. Somewhere no one would look.

She hadn’t screamed.

She just looked at him and said:

“I knew you’d come back.”

And when she fell, The something slipped from her bag.

A book she always carried.

He opened the cover and wrote inside it, not for her.

For the boy.

“She recite to him. I listened, too.”

He leaned back slowly as the episode continued, hearing the story of himself told by the boy.

Not The Whisperer. Not to him.

He didn’t call himself that.

No, he had always saw himself as…

Chapter 10: Echoes in the Blood

Sam

The Station was buzzing.

The murder of Eric Lane had already stirred tension. But now—with that podcast episode going viral—the pressure had turned suffocating. Calls were coming down from city officials, federal agencies were sniffing around, and the press circled like sharks. This wasn’t just a murder anymore.

It was a pattern. A voice. A myth in the making.

Sam stood in front of the case board, red string connecting six photos. Four recent victims. and the ones from the ‘90s. And in the center: a note card, pinned in thick black ink—

“The Whisperer?”

He muttered under his breath. “Still don’t like that name.”

Torres stepped in, holding fresh stills. “Got something. Surveillance footage from a liquor store across the street from the alley where Eric Lane died.”

She dropped them on the table.

A shape. No face. But a presence.

A tall figure. Long coat. Hood drawn. The silhouette hovered near the edge of the crowd. Never looked at the camera. Barely moved. Like a shadow waiting for its cue.

Sam exhaled slowly. “He was there.”

“We ran it through recognition software,” Torres said. “No matches. But the time stamp checks out. He was there before we arrived. He watched us.”

Sam stared at the blurry image longer than necessary.

Then: “He makes mistakes when he wants to be seen.”

Torres raised a brow. “What’s that supposed to mean?”

“He’s sending a message. Not just with the victims. With his presence. He doesn’t just kill. He performs. He wants an audience.”

Torres hesitated. “And David? The podcaster?”

Sam rubbed the back of his neck. “We’ve traced the podcast to an LLC registered out of state. Clean. Too clean. No socials. No address. He’s covering his tracks, but we’ll find him.”

“You think he’s involved?”

“No,” Sam said. Then, quieter: “But he’s inside this. Deep. If he’s right about his mother... this started long before we noticed. And he’s not just telling the story anymore—he’s part of it.”

David

The sun had set an hour ago, but David hadn’t noticed.

It hit him differently tonight. Not as evidence. But as memory.

It wasn’t just a cryptic phrase.

It was... personal.

The killer had written it for someone. Not the cops. Not the world.

For him.

He could see flashes now—his mother’s voice reading aloud, soft and low. His own head resting in her lap, a book open under the dim yellow lamp. And maybe—just maybe—a stranger once sitting too quietly nearby. Watching. Listening.

His stomach turned.

The killer wasn’t announcing himself back then.

He was... remembering.

David turned slowly to his mic. His hand hovered.

Then he pressed record.

His voice was quieter than usual. No introduction. No drama. Just truth.

“My mother wasn’t just the first victim. She was the first verse. The first name in a pattern I didn’t understand until now. And someone has been listening to me since before I ever spoke into this mic.”

He exhaled.

“He was there. Not just in the alley. Not just in the case files. In my life. I think I met him. Once. I just don’t remember well.”

The Whisperer

He stood in the alley where Eric Lane had died.

No one expected him to return. Not this soon. Not while the yellow tape still fluttered like dead ribbon. Not while the scent of bleach and blood clung to the bricks.

But this place—like so many before—was part of the performance.

A verse.

They called him many names now. The Whisperer. The Speaker. The Killer in Silence.

But none of them knew the truth.

He wasn’t telling a story.

He was finishing one.

He pulled a small slip of paper from his coat and unfolded it. A phrase already written. Measured. Clean. A whisper caught in ink:

“There a painless death awaits him who can no longer bear the sorrows of this life”

He left the paper where the body of Eric laid, then slipped on his headphones.

The podcast played again.

He wasn’t sure why he kept listening. Maybe to feel seen. Or maybe to see how much David had remembered.

And tonight… he had remembered too much.

The Keeper smiled faintly as the alley swallowed him again.

The echo was growing louder.

And the boy was finally listening.

1lwwehp,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lwwehp,Excellence Resort PC,"Definitely great experience! We booked transportation through Season Tours and the email instruction is easy to follow. 

As soon as we landed, we went straight to a counter that says Season Tours. They verified our information and took us out and wait for a company vehicle which is a Chevrolet Suburban High Country that says Season Tours at the back so you don’t really have to worry. 

One thing I noticed is that there are a lot of people driving motor bikes on the road as their mode of transportation ( not the harley kind ) and we had an accident on the way where one of the motorcyclist hit the vehicle that we were on and motorcyclist just simply took off. So I’m glad that I did not make a decision to rent a car and drive on my own. 

As soon as we arrived, we were welcomed by a glass of champagne, escorted us to Excellence Club Receptionist (we signed up for Excellence Club Room), told us about the perks, and was escorted straight to the room. Once we entered the room, they showed us how to operate things and opened a bottle of Champagne for us.

Restaurants:
Lobster House and Las Olas are okay.

Magna and Chez Isabelle (French)👌 We kept on going back and forth between these two restaurants and we love Magna’s Tomahawk Steak and their Foie Gras. From Chez Isabelle, we are a fan of Tournedo Rossinni and their Lamb Rack!

By the way, if you plan to dine in Magna and Chez Isabelle, dress code is Casual Elegance. Women can wear dresses, capri pants, skirts with blouse but for men, make sure to pack at least a pair of long pants and closed shoes for these restaurants! If not, you can rent one but they may ran out of size. 

We also tried Oregano (Italian), it was okay. I got the Alfredo pasta and it’s kinda plain.

Entertainment: 
We played bingo on two different nights! We won a bag of ground coffee the first time we played which is a good experience. 

Tipping:
It is not required but I love to show appreciation to those who make us feel welcomed and made us laugh. We also just gave them USD and I’m sure they know a place where to exchange it and get the highest possible exchange for the their $$$

Tips:
Make sure to pack a bottle or two of sunscreen and don’t forget to bring medicine as well. They sell sun bum sunscreen on their gift shop area for $35 and 10pieces of naproxen cost about $8.

If there is one thing that we should have done on this trip, we should’ve booked a unit with a private pool instead since their pool closes at 7pm.

1lwwaoy,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1lwwaoy/aita_for_not_apologizing/,Aita for not apologizing?,"Hi Reddit idk how to start this at all but I’m f(24) and my ex-boyfriend who I’m still currently living with is m(26).
This is a very long story but am I wrong if I don’t apologize to him for our relationship being terrible?
To get a better idea we’ve been dating since 2019. We shortly moved in together because my grandma kicked me out for dating him.
His brother didn’t want me living with them so we moved into my mom’s house. At the time I was going to cosmetology school, but I dropped out due to lack of transportation. I was working at a small cafe but ultimately had to quit for the same reason I dropped out. 
We lived with my mom and we both worked odd jobs.y mother didn’t care about us paying bills she just wanted to help us get on our feet so we saved. Times got rough and Covid happened so I had a conversation with him a pretty long one about joking OF and making money there. He agreed and didn’t have a problem with it, I also asked if he was okay with it multiple times throughout the duration of it. He said he was fine with it, I made a lot of money from it. More than he made at his job at the time and more than I’ve ever made. I used the money to save up and pay for our lives while he worked at Amazon. I paid for our food, our hygiene products, even things we didn’t need like extra clothes for not only me but him too. I found out he was texting other women. I should’ve just ended it there but I gave it another chance because I was in love and young. It was stupid I know. 

Eventually we moved in with his mother. I was still doing OF and still making a lot of money from it. He would argue with his mother pretty bad and I would have to be the mediator most of the time. I got pretty depressed because I didn’t want to do OF anymore and I felt self conscious but I still did it because it was during Covid still and we needed money. A lot of jobs weren’t hiring at the time either. Then I found out he cheated on me again. It wasn’t physical but does that really matter? He was texting so many girls. One day we got into an argument and he pushed me so hard it broke our shoe rack. His mother scolded him and I went to another room to collect myself. At the time I didn’t have anyone to call or anywhere to go to. (Which is another story on its own) that was in 2020. 

In 2021 my grandmother passed and I became more depressed, then my cousin passed a few months after. I still made myself work on OF but most times I couldn’t get out of bed. I was just so defeated. We eventually moved out of his mother’s place and into our own apartment and everything got worse than I ever expected. I started working at Walmart and doing OF but we argued more and more. He got more physical, pushing me around, dragging me through the apartment, picking me up and not putting me down, hitting me, throwing things at me, destroying my belongings. I would fight back because what else could I do in the moment? My name was the only one on the lease and I had nowhere to go. (To clarify I was renting through my aunt but we aren’t close she keeps to her self and I did too) he got along well with my sibling and grandparents so I didn’t want to tell anyone what was going on because I loved him and I didn’t want anyone’s view and opinions of him to change. 

In 2022 we moved back in with my mom. Then my brother was shot and paralyzed. It took a big toll on my entire family so we all packed up and moved to a suburban area that was safer. We argued there but he didn’t touch me at all. But he just kept cheating on me (and my dumb ass kept forgiving him because I loved him and I wanted it to work so bad. I wanted him to love me enough to stop. That was very foolish.) I was making even more on OF because I had more time. He was the only one with a car and I couldn’t drive so moving to a suburban area that relied heavily on vehicles made it hard for me to find work. He got a job at a furniture store and I put more time into OF and this time we helped my mom with bills and with my brother. My self esteem was at an all time low. I felt worthless unless I was making money. I was so far from everything I’ve known and my boyfriend just wouldn’t stop cheating on me. 
Eventually he moved out and back with his brother. I had a terrible mental breakdown because I thought I lost the love of my life, I felt disgusting mentally and physically, and I was working dumb odd jobs so I could make up for his absence. We had two cats at the time and he just left them with me and didn’t care. I ended up having to rehome them because I wasn’t in the right headspace to care for them. I could barely care for myself. We eventually made up and had a long distance relationship. I worked myself sick. One day my mother was supposed to pick me up from work and she forgot about me and ignored my texts. I paid for an uber and went home but I didn’t have a key. My brother had to struggle to get to his wheelchair and open the door. I helped him back to bed and made sure he was okay but that was my breaking point and I couldn’t take it anymore. I was freezing because I was outside in the Midwest winter for a few hours while being sick then my mom yelled at me and would have rather spend time with her boyfriend than help me then got on me about dishes when I just wanted to take a nap because I was feeling like caca. So I called him and he picked me up and his brother allowed me to live with them. His brother helped me get a job and I was extremely grateful because I could stop doing OF. Then I found out while we were long distance he invited a girl to his place and she and I had a bad history so I was just crushed. He claimed they didn’t do anything together but I was just done. I hadn’t had time to process anything I was going through at all so I shut off my feeling and just went to work and went home and stayed in our room and slept the repeated this for over a year. He was occasionally physical but was mostly verbally abusive. His brother noticed and started calling him out and telling him it wasn’t right. His brother witnessed him smack my AirPods out of my ear and he talked to him again. At that point I did something I wasn’t proud of. After the many years of verbal, physical, and mental abuse I cheated on him. I feel terrible about it still. I met a guy and I explained to him my entire situation and he listened and talked to me and made me feel idk validated and heard? I feel more bad about sleeping with him than I do about cheating on my ex. I eventually broke it off and apologized and he understood. My ex found out about it and understandably went ballistic. He kicked me out and I packed a small bag and started walking to my nearest family members house which was my other grandmother. While I was doing that he followed me and got physical again by restraining me and when I didn’t reply to him he would shake me around. I couldn’t do anything but cry and try to get away. I broke down and explained to him how he treated me and how I just wanted to leave and that I was sorry. We eventually calmed down and went back to his place. 

In 2023 we got our own place together. Both of our names are on the lease and we still currently live here. I eventually had to quit my job because I drilled through my hand…..yeah ik that’s crazy and stupid. The abuse got worse. Then I found out he was cheating on me again with 2 different women. I had lost count of how many times that happened. But he just never stopped and he constantly threw my physical affair in my face whenever he got the chance. Then he started beating me and gaslighting me saying he wasn’t hitting me bc he wasn’t punching me. I worked for his mom for a bit got pregnant and miscarried. Which made me spiral and I stopped working. I lost all of my friends I had no one not even him, not that I ever had him in the first place. I stayed jobless and remain jobless because the longer I waited it got harder and harder to find a job which made me more depressed. He would get upset that I couldn’t pay for anything so I started doing OF again and using all of that money to help out. Until I just couldn’t anymore. It took a huge toll on me. I get that I was barely pulling my weight but I kept telling him I need help and he just refused to hear me or care. One of my customers who didn’t care about pictures or anything gives me money in exchange of having my private social media. He pays me every two weeks $400 which isn’t a lot but it’s enough to get by and I’m ever so grateful for him. My ex knew about it very well and didn’t care and was happy I was contributing again. But it wasn’t enough. The abuse went on and kept getting worse until a few months ago when he choked me, broke our door, slammed me on our coffee table, and choked me inside of our bathtub. But it wasn’t abuse because I deserved it because I was yelling and wouldn’t shut up. I ended up calling his brother in secret while he was still going on and his brother rushed over and helped me pack and made him leave. I called my mom and I begged her to pick me up. I explained everything I wrote here to her and she got a u-haul truck and since most of the apartment is my belongings I packed up and moved in with her. 
I was feeling better. Happier. I became a nurse to my living grandmother and I enjoyed our time. I started getting my life back together with help from my mom, I was just happier eventhough sometimes I would miss my ex because we had some good moments together. I started my journey of becoming a life insurance agent. It was great and I foolishly thought that hey since most of our problems stemmed from me not working maybe we can work it out and talk about things better now that I’m doing better. I would visit our apartment then it became longer and i eventually moved back. I felt as if I had broken out of my depression and I started doing more around our place, I was still taking care of my grandmother also. I noticed I was doing most of the work and instead of approaching it like I used to I would calmly ask him to help and it never came only when I would pester him. Then we would end up arguing no matter how much I tried to avoid it. We had a long conversation and I told him if he hurts me again we’re just done. Then we argued and he ended up grabbing my arm so hard it bruised. I realized nothing I did was enough for him. It doesn’t matter he just never cared and wants to hurt me. So I just slipped back into my old ways of just sleeping, not cleaning or cooking as often as I should’ve. And just sulking. I was the only one cleaning and cooking at all so if I didn’t do it, it wouldn’t get done. I felt like I had no say in my living arrangement or anything in my life. I became more depressed and had thoughts of not being here anymore than before and I think that was when I just turned everything off and I just didn’t care if we ended things or anything. Lately I just kept to myself and avoided him unless we were having a smoke sesh. Or unless his friends came over. Whenever we argued I just bluntly told him I just don’t care. I don’t have the energy to argue. He didn’t like that and the more I said it the worse it got. He tried to pick me up and throw me out of the house and I had to barricade myself in my room with a taser, knife, and the bed pushed against the door. I told him I didn’t feel safe while he was actively trying to break the door down. He said he didn’t care and kept telling me to move the bed and I kept saying no and hyperventilating and telling him he’s scaring me. He said I keep making his life hard. He said he didn’t care if he’s scaring me and I had to tell him I’m scared that he’s going to kill me and he said if I didn’t open the door and get out of the house I would be on a dead list. I ended up falling asleep on the floor and  a few hours later he talked to me more calmly through the door and I had to fake like I was okay to not upset him. I knew it was beyond over by then. That was on June 28th. We’ve been cold and distant since then and he’s upset that I just won’t talk to him about anything anymore. He promised he wouldn’t do it again but at this point I just know not to ever trust him. About two days ago we got into a petty argument and he said he wanted me out and nothing to do with me. I told him my name is on the lease so I’m not going anywhere until I can find another apartment for myself. I can’t go back to my moms or anyone else’s because it would be extremely hard to find work or commute anywhere. So staying here would financially benefit us both since he can’t afford groceries or toiletries. If I left all of his appliances would be gone and he would just have a couch, tv, bed, and video game. I haven’t contributed to the rent because I’m still not working and the money I do get goes to groceries, hygiene products, cleaning supplies, and basic necessities. We agreed that I could stay here for a few months but we aren’t together at all. I cook, I clean, and I’ll watch his nephew in the meantime. That’s what we agreed on. But now he wants to talk about how I’ve been treating him since we moved in and he wants me to apologize for using him. I don’t feel like apologizing. I’ve been pushed beyond my breaking point and I just can’t bring myself to do it anymore. He keeps telling me to say something or acknowledge how he feels and I just don’t care.

There's always been a reason not to.  Time, fear, doubt...they've all played an equal part in my decision to push the idea to the back of my mind. 
I'm now about to be 40 years old, and I just can't hold back any longer. 
But, where do I start?  The beginning, well that would just be expected, and (if I'm being honest here) who the Hell can remember all the details in chronological order?!?

So, I'll start from now.  
I (40F) write from the ""comfort"" of my bed.  Another day has gone.  I've spent my time focused on the wants and needs of everyone around me, and now I have but just a moment to think of myself. 

How did I get here?  Lost in the world of everyone else.  Invisible to all, even those who see me every day. 
Married to man (40) who's infidelity has crumbled every part of my soul, I struggle to find myself in a sea of demands.  For I am responsible for making this family work.  

Determined to give my children a family home to grow up in, I've stayed through the dishonesty, insults, and pain.  I've buried my own unhappiness to prevent theirs.  Because while he's a bad husband, he's an amazing father.

Still, I lay here, forgotten.

Twenty years we've been married.  Twenty years of birthdays overlooked.  Twenty years of anniversaries focused on him.  Twenty years of loving someone but never being loved back the same way. 

I wake each morning, make him coffee, lunch, and send him to work. I then work 8-10 hours at my own job while handling anything the kids need as well.  In the evenings we make dinner and are intimate almost daily.  I focus on his desires and  tend to him making sure he's satisfied. 

Still, I lay here, empty. 

Is it wrong to dream of one day meeting a man that asks me what it is I want, and actually listen to my response? To meet a man that pays just as much attention to me as I do him? Who would know my favorite color, activities I enjoy, and who can stimulate me not only physically but mentally as well? 

I'm sure plenty of people feel it is wrong of me, but I am just human.  I too want to be seen, heard, loved. I want to be desired. 

Still, I lay here surrounded and alone.

I just had one of those “aha!” moments, and I felt the need to share it with my favorite AI-loving crew. You ever find yourself stuck, just scrolling endlessly through content trying to figure out how to make something go viral? 😩 Trust me, you’re not alone! 

The good news? I’ve been digging into some seriously juicy content strategies, and I’m ready to spill the beans on what I’m calling my **Viral Blueprint Vault!** 🥳 If you want to tap into this AI content goldmine, you should jump on this fast because…well, it might not be around much longer. ⏳

Here’s the scoop on what makes this blueprint so special: 

1. **The Hook That Grabs:** You know how they say, “First impressions are everything?” Well, it’s true in content too! Find ways to hook your audience in those first few seconds. Ask a question, make them laugh, or throw in a surprising fact. Boom. You've got their attention! 

2. **Snappy Headlines Are Your BFF:** The title of your content can make or break it. Short, punchy, and sometimes even a bit cheeky works wonders. Think of something that piques curiosity—like *“Why Cats Are Actually the Real Masters of the Universe.”* Who wouldn’t click on that?

3. **Share Stories, Not Just Stats:** People connect with feelings, not facts! Paint a picture with your content. Use personal anecdotes or relatable experiences that resonate with your audience. 

4. **Embrace the Power of Lists:** Folks love lists! Seriously, it’s like candy for the brain. Quick and digestible information? Yes, please! Check this out:
   - What to do when you hit writer’s block
   - Tips for making your content visually appealing 
   - The secret sauce to making your audience *feel* something

And don’t forget to *sneak in a little humor!* 😄 Everyone loves a good laugh. Like, what’s the difference between a cat and a comma? One has claws at the end of its paws, and the other is a pause at the end of a clause. Okay, I’ll stop… 

But here’s the kicker: With AI tools at your fingertips, the sky's the limit! Just imagine: you can generate ideas faster than your morning coffee kicks in. 

So, do you want to keep struggling or start thriving? This blueprint isn’t just a “get-rich-quick” scheme; it’s about genuinely connecting with your audience and creating a community around your content. 

I mean, who doesn’t want that?

Venue doesn’t let vendors in until 4pm. Noise ordinance at 10pm, doing our exit soon after. Preferred vendors can enter at 3:30pm (caterer and rentals are preferred). 

When to start the ceremony? 5:30? 6?

Planning on: first look at venue, a short ceremony of 15-20min max, a cocktail “hour” of 45 min, first dance and parent dances (each <2 min), 3 speeches (will ask them to keep it to 2-3 min), small cake cutting. It’s a plated meal, salads will be on the plates as guests enter the reception.

Was thinking 6pm; now worrying that’s too short when people have traveled in? (Doing a welcome event and a casual coffee meetup the next morning) 

We’re not huge dancers, some might leave earlier due to kids, it’ll be ~70 guests is the most likely max but expecting a little less

What can I order that's not complicated but also tastes like a mildly sweet version of a dessert?

Some things I like:

- Pink drink: haven't had this in literal YEARS but I liked it as a teen! Plus it's pretty 

- Java Chip frappucino: too sweet, but nice as a special dessert-like treat. I'd appreciate something less...dense, perhaps?

- Bottled frappucino coffee drinks: is it possible to order something that tastes like this? 

- Peppermint mocha: apart from airports, this is pretty much the only reason I go to Starbucks...for my once a year peppermint mocha

Things I don't like:
- I tried something that had dragon fruit in it, the texture of those dried chunks is not ideal

- Cold brew with cream of some sort (the coffee just doesn't taste good)

- Starbucks matcha is inferior

- I have no interest in boba at Starbucks, or anything blue-colored

We are childfree and moved here from Michigan 3 years ago. Despite people being nice, it's extremely hard to make genuine connections other than a few aquaintances. I'm looking for people who want real friendships- spending quality time together, providing emotional support, taking road trips together, etc. on a regular basis. I have had a terrible time with dozens of people ghosting me in Chicago and I don't think it's very nice. There's nothing wrong with being too busy to hang out often or to make new friends, but I think it's cruel to get people's hopes up or leave them hanging for no reason. I'm looking for people who actually have time to commit to platonic friendships (grabbing coffee once every 3 months is an acquaintanceship). I generally prefer to hang out with 1 or 2 people at a time over a group unless I know everyone. So about me, I'm neurodivergent, queer, Indigenous, Jewish, a socialist and anti-zionist. Some of my hobbies include cooking and baking, going for nature walks, getting coffee, trying new restaurants, going to shows (a lot of emo, punk, metal, indie), seeing theatre performances, organizing, dancing, playing games, 420, really almost anything besides sports. I have social anxiety and it takes a minute for me to warm up to most people, but I think I'm fun and empathetic.

She keeps using the “you’re my Big” card like that justifies everything. No I’m not your Mom I’m your Big I am always here for her but it’s getting to the point where I feel more like her exhausted handler than her mentor.

Chapter 1

On our wedding anniversary, my husband insisted on inviting his entire crew of friends to celebrate with us. Among them was a female ""bro"" I'd never seen before.

The moment she walked in, she plopped down directly on my husband's lap and starting a video call: ""Mom, I made it! Your godson is sitting right next to me.""

Then she turned and pressed her face close to his, practically nuzzling him: ""Well, Knox, if you ever treat me badly, I'll have both our families beat you up!""

Crack!

The glass I was holding slipped from my fingers, shattering on the floor.

In an instant, everyone's eyes were on me.

His female ""bro"" just arched one eyebrow:

""Hey, I was just joking around. You're not bothered by that, are you?""

The private room fell silent instantly—you could hear a pin drop.

I instinctively looked at Knox.

He just smiled and playfully tapped Piper's head, his tone affectionate: ""Today's my wedding anniversary with my wife. Don't be so wild.""

She pouted flirtatiously, naturally wrapping her arms around his neck: ""Fine. Since you're throwing this welcome-home party for me, I'll give you that much.""

By then, a server came in to clean up the broken glass and handed me a new cup.

Someone took the opportunity to ease the tension: ""Don't mind her, Riley. Piper's always been carefree—she doesn't mean any harm.""

I remained silent.

Piper glanced at me dismissively: ""Don't tell me you're actually this petty?""

After that, she released her hold on Knox and hopped off his lap: ""Guess I better keep my distance from you, Knox. So wifey doesn't throw a fit when you get home.""

Then she shook her head with a dramatic sigh, teasing the group of guys: ""Now you see why I don't hang out with women?""

""So damn dramatic and sensitive. It's exhausting.""

Nobody picked up her comment, and the atmosphere turned awkward.

Someone hesitantly spoke up: ""Piper, it's their anniversary today, maybe tone it down a bit...""

Suddenly Piper covered her mouth in mock realization: ""Oh my god, I almost forgot! I brought a gift!""

Then she pulled out a velvet jewelry box from her purse and presented it to Knox like a prized treasure: ""Ta-da!""

When she opened the box, inside lay a pair of gleaming gemstone cufflinks—men's cufflinks.

Someone politely gasped in admiration.

Knox smiled. ""You came all the way back home—I should be the one giving you gifts.""

Hearing this, Piper gave him a coy look and reached over to fasten them on his wrists.

As she moved, matching cufflinks on her own sleeves caught the light brilliantly.

""Hmph, I picked these out especially for you. You better appreciate them.""

Some people had already begun secretly glancing at my expression, but I just took a deep breath, my clenched fingers leaving crescent-shaped marks on my palm.

Then I stood up.

Knox frowned. ""Where are you going?""

I forced a smile. ""To book you two a hotel room.""

""Otherwise I'm afraid you'll do it right here.""

The moment I finished speaking, Piper violently smashed the empty jewelry box in her hand onto the floor.

She cursed loudly: ""What's fucking wrong with this chick?""

""I told you guys we should've just hung out with the bros.""

""Now she's completely ruined the mood!""

Knox chased after me, his tone urgent: ""Babe, Piper doesn't mean anything by it.""

""They're just cufflinks. She's always been casual like this—don't take it personally.""

""And what you said back there was way out of line...""

I gave him a cold smile. ""So the real reason you invited all your friends today was to celebrate your childhood sweetheart coming home, right?""

Knox shifted uncomfortably, avoiding my eyes. ""Why are you making such a big deal out of this?""

""Besides, our anniversaries are always just the two of us—that gets a bit dull.""

""I thought inviting more people would make it more fun.""

Seeing my expression darken, Knox grabbed my hand, his tone softening unusually: ""Babe, don't overthink this. Piper and I have known each other for years—if something was going to happen between us, it would have already.""

""And look, I chose to be with you, didn't I?""

I nearly laughed from anger: ""I'm so sorry for taking your childhood sweetheart's place.""

""Fine, I'll step aside.""

Knox's face flushed red as he yanked his hand away, his tone hardening: ""What are you talking about? You know that's not what I meant.""

""Riley, you're being completely unreasonable!""

With that, he stormed off without looking back.

But his footsteps gradually slowed. I knew he was waiting for me to compromise and follow him, just like I always had before.

I frowned, turned around and walked away.

This man is truly disgusting!

Chapter 2

Knox came home at three in the morning.

He was completely wasted, clothes disheveled, reeking of alcohol, stumbling as he tried to embrace me.

I frowned and dodged him, but he caught my wrist.

Next second, his boozy breath hit my face: ""Happy anniversary, babe. Look what I got you.""

He pulled a jewelry box from his pocket and opened it in front of me—it was the Graff Diamonds jewelry set I'd been eyeing for months.

But my eyes quickly fell on the two empty spots in the box.

Knox scratched his head sheepishly: ""Piper accidentally saw it, and she really liked the bracelet and ring. She insisted on taking them.""

""I figured you already have plenty of bracelets and rings, so I let her have them...""

When I didn't take it, he tried to force the box into my hands, his tone reassuring: ""Babe, don't be mad. If you really want them, I'll buy you another set, okay?""

Yet I just stepped back, letting the jewelry box clatter to the floor.

Knox paused, pressed his lips together to control his temper, then forced a smile: ""Babe, I was wrong today. I'm sorry.""

""I shouldn't have invited so many people on our anniversary. But look what I got!""

With that, he pulled out a small cherry cake from behind his back.

I stared at the cake, memories flooding back...

The day we got together, he had given me a cherry cake too.

Since then, we'd promised to celebrate every important occasion with cherry cake.

In that moment, fragments of everything we'd experienced together over the years flashed before my eyes.

I sighed and finally accepted it.

Fine. I'll forgive him one last time.

Seeing me unwrap the cake, Knox's face lit up with a huge smile.

As he fed me a bite, he cautiously began: ""Babe, Piper just got back and hasn't found an apartment yet...""

""She wants to stay with us for a few days. Is that okay?""

""She promised she won't cause you any trouble!""

The sickly sweet taste in my mouth suddenly made me nauseous.

I rushed to the bathroom and couldn't help throwing up.

Knox followed anxiously, patting my back: ""What's wrong? Babe.""

I forcibly pushed his hand away, went to the table and smashed everything on it.

I looked at him, my eyes red: ""Yes, she can stay!

""I'll go!""

Knox's expression instantly changed, his voice rising: ""What are you making a scene about now? I told you it's temporary! You're walking out over something this trivial?""

His contorted face reflected in my eyes, but this time, the light in my eyes had completely extinguished.

I shook my head and forced a bleak smile: ""Let's get divorced.""

Knox clearly hadn't expected me to say that.

He exploded with rage, violently kicking over the coffee table:

""Riley, are you fucking mental? You're really pushing it!""

Chapter 3

I locked myself in the master bedroom.

When Knox finished his shower and found the door wouldn't open, he pounded on it furiously before slinking off to the guest room.

The next morning, he sat at the breakfast table with a cold expression. The table was set with an elaborate breakfast.

I snickered.

Playing the silent treatment card? How pathetic.

I just gave him a cold glance and walked expressionlessly toward the front door.

Knox couldn't take it anymore: ""Riley, don't be so goddamn ungrateful!""

""You were wrong yesterday too. You shouldn't throw around divorce as an empty threat.""

Without looking back, I replied flatly: ""I'm serious. Start preparing for it.""

After I closed the door, I heard dishes shattering inside.

...

By the time I reached the office, my emotions had completely settled.

My work efficiency remained as high as ever. Almost no one could tell I was having relationship troubles.

During a meeting, my boss announced: ""We have an international order that requires someone to travel to British for a month.""

""If anyone's interested, contact me. The company will cover all expenses, plus a travel allowance.""

At that moment, messages from Knox popped up one after another on my phone screen. I irritably turned off the phone and said loudly: ""I can go.""

After the meeting, a close colleague stopped me, sounding puzzled: ""Riley, what about your husband while you're gone for a month?""

I replied nonchalantly: ""Oh, he has his childhood sweetheart to keep him company. He won't be lonely.""

Hearing my words, my colleague realized they'd said something wrong and awkwardly shut up.

When I got home that evening, I found an unfamiliar suitcase in the entryway.

Bright pink, covered with random stickers.

I took off my heels only to discover someone had taken my house slippers.

My expression darkened immediately.

Walking barefoot a few steps forward, I heard flirtatious laughter: ""Wow, Knox! Your cooking has really improved since I last saw you!""

Piper was wearing my cherry slippers, eating with oil dripping down her chin.

In her hands were clearly my plate and fork.

Seeing me approach, Piper seemed startled: ""Oh! shit, how do you walk so silently? You could've said something—you just scared me!""

""Knox, you're even more jumpy than I am. Must be rough getting scared by your wife every day, huh?""

Without wasting a single word, I stepped forward and slapped her across the face twice, hard and loud.

Then I threw the dishes on the table to the floor.

Piper was stunned by the slaps at first, then immediately exploded: ""You fucking bitch! You dare hit me?!""

Knox heard the commotion and rushed out from the kitchen, grabbing the raging Piper.

She twisted in his arms: ""Knox, did you see that? Has your wife lost her mind? She hit me the second she walked in!""

""How can you stand this psycho? Why are you holding me back? Hit her back for me!""

Knox's face darkened as he yelled at me: ""Riley, what the hell is wrong with you? Apologize right now!""

I curled my lips into a smile: ""Oh, I'm so sorry. I couldn't see clearly.""

""I just saw some woman wearing my slippers, using my dishes—I thought she was a thief.""

Piper's face flushed red, looking somewhat guilty: ""I didn't know they were yours...""

But she was obviously lying.

I love cherries—almost everything of mine at home has a cherry symbol on it. If she accidentally wore my slippers, that would be understandable, but to also use my plates, my forks? Too many coincidences? Only a fool would believe she wasn't doing it deliberately.

Seeing that I'd apologized, her expression changed.

She nestled softly in Knox's arms, showing her reddened cheek and tearful eyes: ""I'm sorry, Riley. Even if it was an accident, I shouldn't have touched your things...""

I raised an eyebrow.

Well, well. A professional damsel in distress.

But Knox was clearly falling for it.

He soothingly patted Piper's shoulder, then frowned at me: ""Riley, you've really gone too far this time.""

Then he helped Piper to the guest room to treat her face.

1lww12f,https://www.reddit.com/r/saigon/comments/1lww12f/airport_bribery/,Airport bribery,"I’m sure we all know that bribery happens everywhere, but I never expected what happened to me.
Yesterday I (F20) went to sendoff my boyfriend (M22) who is going back to the U.S at Tan Son Nhat international airport. They didn’t let him through at immigration and made him wait on the side, then a lady came over to grab him and they walked back to where I was standing. I asked her what was wrong and she said that his check in luggage has a problem. She asked me if there’s any batteries in it in which I said no.

When we walked to the little room where the inspection was happening, me and my boyfriend went in. I explained to the inspector that I’m only here to help and translate for him, and that this luggage was his. The inspector was very young, she was about my age probably just a couple years older. The real problem was not because of batteries because he did not have any in his luggage, the real problem was the three sets of nail polishes that he is bringing back , each set contains about 25 to 30 bottles and each bottle is 12 mL. My mom and his mom are both nail shop owners so these sets of nail polishes are for them.

The inspector asked me why he is bringing so much. I told her that they don’t sell these nail polishes in the US and that he is bringing them home for his mom and me. She said that usually for personal use people only bring 5 to 7 bottles and that this is too much and that I would have to send these off separately in the cargo department. I asked her, “so I have to send the separately and pay a fee to the cargo department to send this?”. I was just ready to take them home at this point.

She said yes, this amount of nail polishes usually require you to send it through cargo but people like to bring it with them through checkin luggage. And I said “yes, I thought that he could bring this in his check-in luggage. That’s why it’s in here.” She proceeded to tell me that she usually won’t let this go, but if I would give a little “coffee money” then she’ll let it pass. 

I was in shock almost because I’ve never been blatantly asked for bribery before. Like the thought, didn’t even cross my mind until she said it.  Since she said it in Vietnamese, I was pretty confused on who to give the money to and literally asked her “who do I give the money to?”. Later in the day when I told my family what I said to her, they all started laughing.

Anyway, I didn’t know how much to give her because usually people give 500k vnd. But I felt that it was too wasteful so I pulled out a 200k😂😂. When I gave it to her, she started smiling and laughing like crazy. This was due to the fact that I gave her too little and she blatantly told me “ for products like this. I usually take 500k to 700k”. I just kept smiling at her exactly like how she smiled at me and then we closed up the luggage and my boyfriend was on his way. At end when she closed up the luggage she said “if anybody ask, tell them that this was a battery check.”

I don’t know if they ever do this to non vietnamese people, but I feel like there’s no rule indicating how much liquid(nail polish) you can bring if its a check in luggage right?? His airline was EVA air. Weird experience overall and I was glad to have saved 300k😂",1,1752202799.0,saigon,2,0.67,False
1lww0qa,https://www.reddit.com/r/GreekLife/comments/1lww0qa/i_feel_like_my_little_is_using_me/,I feel like my little is using me,"I’m at my breaking point. I got my little last semester and was genuinely excited. I made her a cute basket, did all the bonding stuff.

For a while, things were fine.

But now? We’re on summer break and I’m still dealing with her chaos like it’s rush week all over again.

She gets absolutely obliterated every weekend at God knows who’s house, and somehow I became her go to “come get me I’m not okay” contact. Like girl, I don’t even know where you are half the time. I’m not your Lyft driver. But I still go. And every time I do, I feel more used than respected. Plus, we’re also about 500 miles apart right now.

She’ll call me sobbing at 2AM about her long-distance boyfriend the one who cheats on her on what seems like a biweekly rotation. I try to be supportive, but when I gently suggest she let him go, she hits me with, “But you’re my Big You’re supposed to help me.”

I’ve told her not to call me in the middle of the night anymore. But if I don’t pick up, she’ll just keep calling. I’ve woken up to 20 missed calls before. It’s overwhelming and again, we are not even in school right now.

I’ve bought her coffee, food, even lied to exec once to cover for her being too hungover to show up. But now she just Venmo requests me like I’m her damn wallet $6.44 for sushi mood, and once $9 labeled “because you love me”

She keeps using the “you’re my Big” card like that justifies everything. No I’m not your Mom I’m your Big I am always here for her but it’s getting to the point where I feel more like her exhausted handler than her mentor.

I’ve talked to her. I’ve talked to other sisters I’ve gone to my big. Nothing’s changed. And now I’m the one losing sleep, peace, and sanity.

I love her. I really do. But I’m also this close to voting her out of the org myself. I love my Big we have boundaries. ",2,1752202773.0,GreekLife,1,1.0,False
1lww06i,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardwarehacking/comments/1lww06i/building_a_retro_gaming_spacesetup_but_have_the/,"Building a Retro Gaming Space/Setup, But Have the Wrong TV - HELP!","I recently picked up a working Panasonic TR-542A Solid State portable television. For reasons I can only assume are I was not paying attention or forgot how to read temporarily, I did not realize until I had already made the purchase and was at home playing with it that this television is black and white only. My original plan for this television was to use it with some retro gaming consoles (Nintendo, Atari, Sega Genesis) for me and my kids to play so they could get the full retro experience and I could have some nostalia moments from when I was younger. But I really wanted a color television, not black and white.



So I started researching different possibilities, including removing everything and using just the case with a different screen (CRT or LCD, which I know would ruin the retro feel). But as I was looking up info on this particular television it seems that it is worth much more than I paid for it, and it might be considered a tragedy or sin by some to take it apart and hack it, especially since it still works and doesn't seem to have any issues other than missing it's atenna which I think could be easily replaced.



So I am looking for some advice on what I should do. I hate the idea of removing a working piece of tech from the world just to fit some project idea I have, especially since my retro setup idea doesn't require this specific television. I just want something that looks ""retro"" from the 70s or 80s (even 90s if it has a fun unique look to it). So should I try to find a buyer who is looking for a working one of these and then use that money to find something else that fits what I am looking for? Or do I just hack this thing apart and don't look back?



I am not in any rush right now, so I can take my time. I just want to ""do right by"" this television and respect the technological history it carries, but I also want to eventually move forward on my plans for retro gaming with my kids. Sorry for the long post and thanks in advance for any thoughts, advice, etc.

1lwvxaz,https://www.reddit.com/r/SleepEssentialsIndia/comments/1lwvxaz/practical_tips_to_fall_asleep_faster/,Practical Tips to Fall Asleep Faster,"We’ve all been there: lying in bed, mind racing, eyes open at 2 AM. Most of us have heard the same tired advice (drink warm milk, count sheep, “just relax”) but what actually *works*?

Here’s a practical list of **science-backed tips** that go beyond folk remedies. Try combining a few that fit your life rather than relying on a single “magic trick.”

# Have a plan (not just hope)

A lot of us try random tricks we read online, but sleep problems often need a **systematic approach**. Build your own sleep routine: track what you try, keep what helps, drop what doesn’t. This helps you avoid long-term issues and keeps you from turning to sleeping pills that can dull memory and focus.

# Say goodbye to caffeine (really)

It sounds obvious, but most people underestimate how long caffeine sticks around. The half-life of caffeine can stretch longer as you age meaning your afternoon coffee might still be buzzing in your system at bedtime. Cut it completely (or at least stop by late morning).

# Exercise — but do it earlier

Exercise is great for sleep, but not if you squeeze it in at 9 PM. Aim for morning workouts: they boost energy, help set your body clock, and avoid that wired feeling at night.

# Morning sunlight matters

Get outside first thing in the morning, even for 10–15 minutes. Natural light helps your brain lock onto a healthy circadian rhythm so you get sleepy at the right time.

# Dim the lights before bed

Bright indoor lighting tells your brain it’s still daytime. Start dimming lamps 1–2 hours before bed. This small change can make a big difference over time.

# Reduce blue light

Phones, TVs, tablets, laptops they all emit blue light that blocks melatonin, your body’s sleep hormone. Either put them away an hour before bed or use night mode / warm filters.

# Keep your bedroom cool (but your feet warm)

Your core body temperature naturally drops before sleep. Keeping the room slightly cool helps, but warming your hands and feet (e.g., with socks) signals it’s safe to sleep.

# Melatonin (ask your doctor first)

Melatonin can help if you have trouble falling asleep, especially during schedule changes or travel. But it’s not for everyone, and dosage matters. Talk to a professional first and avoid driving after taking it.

# Manage stress (not just at night)

Stress and tension keep your brain alert. Find daily ways to decompress: mindfulness, breathing exercises, or try the ideas from *The Happiness Trap* (a practical guide to handling unhelpful thoughts without fighting them). Avoid leaning on alcohol, caffeine, or late-night snacks to cope.

# Try the cognitive shuffle

When your mind won’t stop spinning, use the “cognitive shuffle”: imagine random, unrelated objects (like an apple, a ladder, a pillow). This gentle mental wandering mimics the first stage of sleep and helps quiet rumination. 

# Bottom line

Better sleep usually comes from a mix of small changes, not one secret hack. Track what helps, keep your evenings calm and screen-light low, and keep caffeine out of your afternoons. Over time, these habits train your body and brain to wind down naturally.

If anyone else here has tried these (or has other evidence-based tips), I’d love to hear what worked for you.",1,1752202485.0,SleepEssentialsIndia,0,1.0,False

For context, we've been dating for almost a year. I recently moved into a new apartment and have been furnishing it all on my own
-bought the couch, TV, everything. My boyfriend surprised me by buying a coffee table, which I genuinely appreciated. Today I realized I needed a shower filter because l've started breaking out (the water here is really harsh), so I asked if I could use his Amazon Prime to order one for faster shipping.
Instead, he said "" Send me the one u want"" I was actually touched-until five minutes later he told me it was $98, and when I asked ""Should I Apple Pay you?"" he said ""Haha, yes."" | know it sounds small, but it crushed me because just today I was making plans and putting together stuff for his 30th birthday coming up in a couple of months. A trip abroad .l've done so much in this relationship-from taking him on dates to make me feel appreciated and loved, to planning a $4,000 birthday trip for him, to literally choosing an apartment with him in mind. yet here I am, always giving. And now, over $98, l've never felt the ick before but this one hit me hard. I almost cried. I'm kind of sick to my stomach.
The dynamic feels so uneven.
I never keep tabs of what I do for him etc but he I never keep tabs of what I do for him etc but he does. He's the kind of person to not offer help financially without specifically being asked. And I'm the type who thinks "" oh this person I care about needs help I'll help them as much as I can "". And even when asked he'll say he wasn't raised that way.
For example I was car shopping for a few month and has been getting month rentals and I got sick of it and wanted to find a car and stop burning through money. I was stressed he suggested I get another rental and I said it was expensive. And he didn't offer to help with even half of the cost. This is also a man who l've told multiple I like flowers. And I even asked why he doesn't buy me some. His response at first was ""I'll buy them"" then the last time I asked it was ""is it because TikTok told you to?"" And still hasn't bought any.
I've never been someone to keep tabs. When I take him out, I do it because I genuinely want him to feel appreciated. And today was so excited, when I started planning the surprise international trip for his 30th birthday. Like literally checking flights and Airbnbs. I wasn't even thinking about the cost because I just wanted to make it special.
. I know it sounds small, but this hit deep. It made me realize how one-sided things really are.
I would like your thoughts? Is communication the key? Or do people like this not change. And it doesn't help that he was raised in a ""feminist"" household. But things weren't split 50/50 between his mom and dad. And he likes to bring it up and say where he's from everyone holds their own and then they just come together to have a good time. And I'm like where l'm from if someone needs a hand we offer a hand.
TL;DR:
Boyfriend offered to buy me a shower filter, asked me to pick one and the color, ordered it, then told me it was $98 and confirmed he wanted me to pay him back-after making it seem like a gift.
Meanwhile, I've been planning a whole international trip for his 30th and regularly pay for things just to make him feel appreciated. The whole thing gave me the worst ick and I can't un-ick.",0,1752202462.0,dating_advice,9,0.25,False

I’ve been enjoying my single era so far, but now I feel like ready na ko mabulabog ulit. I’m looking for someone na I can be my companion for life, someone I can grow with- whether grow old man or as a person, or sa career. Someone that won’t get in the way of my dreams and other way around din, yung di ako makakasagabal sa kanya hahaha. Someone I can joke around, share my unhinged memes, work out together, and share a cup of coffee with while laughing and living in this silly little world we have. 

I’m in it for the long haul, so if you’re expecting na tayo na agad within weeks/months, I’m not for you. Like I said, this is a commitment. But first, let’s be friends muna and see where it goes. 


About me:
- 5 ft 9, and pretty confident naman with my looks. Nagkaka muscles na (ulit) after gym and running era ko na rin haha
- Licensed MD 🩺. Lives in Manila
- For hobbies and interests, I like watching true crime documentaries, horror, Philosophy, history, anime; tambay ako sa youtube. I write for fun. (Favorite authors: Charles Bukowski, Rick Riordan); also thinking of learning how to play the guitar or learn another language. 
- Top 3 fave anime: FMA B, Vinland Saga, Frieren; Top 3 fave shows: Breaking Bad, B99, Parks and Rec
- I didn’t come from a rich family, everything I have is gotten through hard work so I understand the value of it; currently making something out of myself professionally
- Masaya kausap and can carry a convo esp if I like you. Empathetic (my job requires me to be) and strives to be emotionally intelligent
- Nonsmoker, occasional alcoholic beverage drinker, doesn’t vape
- Family-oriented (as in), wants kids one day

About you:
- Age range: 24-28 but this is negotiable
- also lives in Manila or Metro Manila
- Must have at least some similar interests/hobbies as I do para di boring ang interactions natin
- Student or working are all welcome; like I said, let’s achieve our dreams sa buhay together!
- Let’s be real: I believe physical attractions matters in a relationship, so eto lang preference ko: I prefer someone na petite-average build, with a nice smile/pretty eyes. If confident ka sa looks mo, go for it!
- Above all, a kind person with nothing but good intentions
- Non-negotiables: non-Catholic, doesn’t want kids, from province na malayo sa NCR (ayoko na ng ldr pls haha)
- Bonus points if you have an unhinged sense of humor (tipong dark humor/racist reels ang algo or brainrot haha)

1lwvt5c,https://www.reddit.com/r/QuittingZyn/comments/1lwvt5c/30_days_free_of_zyn_my_saga/,30 days free of Zyn – my saga,"After three years taking Zyn, I finally hit the wall – the pouches completely ruled my life and I was sick of it. I had my last pouch on May 27, 2025.  
  
When I was using Zyn, I’d wake up in the morning and have a pouch within 2 minutes. Often I would wake in the middle of the night at 4am – I’d pull out the phone, pop in a Zyn and doom-scroll for 30 minutes while my wife slept next to me. I finally quit after a heavy weekend of usage while camping with family & friends. I went to bed on Monday night of Memorial Day weekend and told myself I would never buy another tin. I had Walgreens 21 mg nicotine patches ready to go, to help taper off.  
  
For me, nicotine is a strong stimulant and mild hallucinogen and the Zyn delivery system is by far the most sustained and powerful I’ve encountered. I’m 55 years old now and started smoking cigarettes when I was 17. I remember that day clearly – I was waiting for a pal to come pick me up, sitting at a bus stop with a liquor store on the corner and I made the decision right there – I’m going to be a smoker. I chain smoked 4 or 5 cigarettes within an hour and from that day on, I was hooked. I smoked a pack a day of Marlboro Reds for the next 15 years until I had kids. My son was born in 2011 and I was able to give it up, first by switching to Copenhagen Pouches then to nicotine patches. It was tough, but I was able to grind through it. I used toothpicks to mimic cigarettes for the mouth and finger feel – that really helped. Also, cigarettes don’t deliver nearly as much nicotine as a Zyn pouch.  
  
I was nicotine free for 8 years or so, figured I’d never go back. But then I started coaching baseball for my kids teams in Little League. It was super fun to get back on the diamond, I’d played a lot growing up. It was fun, but stressful. During one of the games, while coaching 3rd base it hit me – why not chew tobacco, just like the pros. The nicotine buzz works pretty well on the baseball field. The next game I bought a tin of Copenhagen Pouches and was instantly hooked again. I told myself I’d quit after baseball season was over, but I knew that was bullshit. I liked those Copenhagen Pouches – they pack a big nicotine punch, way more than 6mg I’d guess, but it’s such a nasty habit. You’ve got to have a spit cup and they turn your teeth brown and it just ain’t a good look for a middle-aged father of 3.   
  
One night I was talking with a pal and he told me about the Zyn pouches – you gotta switch, they’re great, you’ll love it. I ended up buying a tin and quickly made the transition. They definitely made the nicotine delivery much cleaner. I settled on the smooth version. I’d still spit – I didn’t like to swallow that stuff  and usually had a coffee cup to spit in while I had a pouch in.  
  
Now that I’ve quit, I’ve found that Zyn was far more controlling than I realized. You get owned by the dopamine reward cycle. For me I’d put a fresh pouch in about once an hour all day long. My day was divided up into these one hour nicotine rushes – my life was structured around it, although I didn’t realize it at the time. Time to wash the dishes? Fresh Zyn. Phone call with an old pal, pop one in. Just finished a meal, time to go sit and enjoy a post-dinner buzz.  
  
At first, Zyn seems to lower stress and at higher doses it can give a strong and satisfying physical buzz. I’m a drinker too and although I’ve battled with my alcohol intake for years, I find it way easier to control than nicotine. If I have a few cocktails and a Zyn, I’m in orbit – combined with alcohol it can really incapacitate you.  
  
Quitting was awful and I am still not feeling 100% normal, but the worst of it is over. The mental effects have been really hard. There has been anxiety, boredom and depression. Mild panic attacks. I’ve slept a lot – afternoon naps that I don’t want to get up from. I’m a pretty social person, but I didn’t want to talk to people and was avoiding friends. That’s letting up now and I’m starting to get my groove back at day 45.  
  
Overall it has been a terrible experience and I’m begging my kids to please, please never ever try any nicotine products. It just ain’t worth it. The long term effects of Zyn aren’t really known at this point – there need to be more studies done. I’m also curious what else may be in these products – I wouldn’t trust Big Tobacco for a second. They might be including chemicals that increase nicotine uptake or are adding other addictive agents.  
  
Anyhow, that’s my tale – sorry this got so long. I’m really glad I found this forum – it helped a lot and inspired me to finally quit. Just make the decision to quit and power through – you got this!

1lwvsyk,https://www.reddit.com/r/CuriousMindsLab/comments/1lwvsyk/the_most_unexpected_way_science_saved_my_day_it/,The Most Unexpected Way Science Saved My Day (It Involves a Leaky Faucet),"I’m not a scientist by any stretch—my last chemistry class was in high school, and I barely passed. But last month, a tiny scientific principle saved me from a flooded bathroom. Let me explain:

My kitchen faucet had been dripping for weeks. Slow, steady drops that kept me up at night, and no matter how tight I turned the handle, it wouldn’t stop. I assumed the washer was worn out, so I bought a replacement kit and watched a YouTube video on how to fix it. Easy enough, right? Wrong. When I took apart the faucet, the washer looked fine, and the valve seat wasn’t corroded. I put it back together, and the drip got worse.

Frustrated, I called my neighbor, who’s a retired plumber. He took one look and said, “It’s water pressure. Your house has high pressure, and the cartridge can’t seal properly when it’s that strong.” I stared at him blankly. He explained that water pressure is measured in psi, and if it’s too high, it can push past even new parts. “It’s like trying to hold a door shut while someone’s pushing from the other side,” he said.

That’s when I remembered something from that old chemistry class: pressure equals force over area. If the water’s force was too strong for the small surface area of the cartridge, it would leak. His solution? A pressure-reducing valve installed near the main water line. We picked one up, installed it in 20 minutes, and—poof—the drip stopped.

It blew my mind that a concept I’d dismissed as “school stuff” actually solved a real problem. Now I find myself noticing these little scientific moments everywhere: why my coffee maker’s heating element takes longer to boil water at high altitudes, or how my bike pump uses air pressure to fill tires. 

What’s a time when basic science—physics, chemistry, biology—snuck into your daily life and surprised you? I’d love to hear your stories. It might just make me pay more attention in those random科普 videos I keep scrolling past.",1,1752202123.0,CuriousMindsLab,0,1.0,False

Chapter 11: Gotta Get Away

[https://www.broadjam.com/songs/lynnanngate18/away](https://www.broadjam.com/songs/lynnanngate18/away)

There are those of us who, seemingly, have no problem living a lie. Then there are others who lie to themselves using intricate rationalizations, barely keeping their conscience at bay. Six years into my marriage to Shawn, my conscience is utterly drained and I am all but fresh out of phony rationale. One thing is for certain: A change is in the air. I am finally confronting the painful fact that things are never going to magically get better between us, in fact things are getting worse. Our waning mutual respect is simply not enough to constitute a marriage. We’re just not right for each other, and it ain’t just me. It’s more than apparent that Shawn is unhappy with our situation as well but his way of dealing with the whole mess is to shut down and go out drinking more often than usual.  
Coming home to this at the end of each day is getting harder and harder and I’m thinking it’s gonna be up to me to shit or get off the pot here. For sure I never want to hurt or humiliate Shawn by betraying him, but constantly being around all of these musician dudes has been giving me the itch. Somethin’s gotta give – and soon – but how to initiate? I find myself waiting for a sign. I’ve been thinking for some time now that it would be ideal if I could just take off on my own for awhile. Get away from our tense home environment and gain some perspective.  
Like an answered prayer, it is Janet who provides this opportunity.

She calls me at work one day. I am a project manager’s assistant at a huge contracting firm on the Brooklyn/Queens border. The pace of this job is constant frantic insanity – all day, every day. I’m coming off a gig from the night before, chugging on maybe 2 hours of sleep, and I feel like hell on the back fence. Janet sounds all keyed up.  
Janet: “Lena – are you sitting down?”  
Me (groan): “Listen, if I had it my way, I’d be LAYING down under my desk.”  
Janet: (guffaw) “Seriously – you won’t believe it. My firm is sending me to LONDON on a case. I’ll be LIVING there for 10 months, all expenses paid. ALL EXPENSES PAID, BABY!!”  
Me: “Oh my god – that is fantastic Janet. Congratulations!”  
Janet: “Why THANK you, my friend! And do you know what this means? This means that YOU will just have to COME and VISIT!”  
Me: “It does?! I do?!” I’ve always wanted to go to London. The Beatles. Those fabulous accents…  
Janet: (jumping thru the phone): “The firm is flying me over there this weekend to go apartment shopping! FLAT SHOPPING!! They told me to go ahead and pick out any TWO-BEDROOM flat in the heart of the city that strikes my fancy!! Can you imagine, Lena? Couldn’t you just SHIT?!”  
Me: “Oh my god. This really is amazing, Janet. London!”  
Janet: “MERRY OLE’ ENGLAND TOWN! You’ll come visit, won’t you? You’ll come stay with me?”  
Me: “Of course. It sounds incredible.” I’m grinning ear to ear. “I’m proud of you, Janet.”  
Janet: (pause) “You’re proud of me?”  
Me: “Sure I am. You worked hard for this.”  
Janet: (giggling ecstatically) “Me, too! I’m proud of me, too!”  
We plan and scheme excitedly until my boss summons me via intercom.  
I hang up, my mind racing with a rapidly forming ‘to-do’ list.  
This is it. The sign I’ve been waiting for.  
I’m going to London!

Chapter 12 : Ready For Take-Off

Early spring, 1994. The London Odyssey is upon us. Janet’s been there for a couple of months already – settling in, takin’ care of lawyerly business and whatnot. It turns out that I will be making the trip with one Peggy Larkin, another old school chum of ours. Peggy is a bright, well-liked little gal with a sardonic sense of humor. Just a good egg. She and I have long-standing joke based upon the fact that since we’re both Hungarians, we fancy ourselves to be awesome geniuses – “gravely feared, yet revered by all”. While not a regular in our crowd, whenever I have the opportunity to hang out with Peggy I enjoy her company very much. These days, she’s married with a couple of young kids, still living in Queens and also needing a break – if not from her marriage, then definitely from her dreary soccer-mom routine.  
It is Janet who suggests that me and Peggy come to London during the same week and, man, I am all for it. To be frank, the thought of spending an entire week in a foreign land with only Janet has had me slightly nervous from the get-go. My solitary concern lies in Janet’s propensity for those dreadful mood swings of hers. We’ve never actually roomed together for any amount of time apart from the sporadic over-nighters during our hardy-partyin’ marathons. The very real possibility of Janet tee-ing off and losing it over some stupid shit while I’m her houseguest overseas… well…that’s the substance of a solidly nightmarish situation as far as I’m concerned.  
So yes, I jump at the idea of traveling with Peggy. She would be an enchanting, familiar companion for the long flights. The supplemental stimulation of her company shall enhance the general dynamic of the whole experience, making it more like one grand slumber-party abroad! Yes, Peggy’s presence on this trip will be more integral than any type of traveler’s insurance: It will be the perfect in-house Janet-buffer.  
\* \* \* \* \* \*  
When I inform Shawn of my travel plans, he is mildly surprised but seems most concerned about who will take care of our dogs in my absence. When I assure him that I’ve already worked out the details, the whole deal seems to suit him just fine. As I figured it would.  
On the mild and sun-drenched morning of my departure Shawn drives me to the airport and carries my bags, like the gentleman he’s always been. We stand facing one another at the departing gate.  
Me: “So I’ll call you when I get to Janet’s.”  
Shawn: “Okay. Just leave a message if I don’t pick up.”  
Me: “Right. Hug my puppies every day, please.”  
Shawn: “I will. They’ll be fine.” He’s itchy to get going.  
Me: “Alright. So have a good week.  
Shawn: “You, too. Safe trip. Say hi to Janet.”  
A quick kiss and hug, as we simultaneously voice our standard farewell:  
“Love ya. See ya. ‘Bye.”  
And then he turns, briskly disappearing into the milling crowd. The breath hitches in my throat, jagged pangs of profound sadness catching me offguard. I stand perfectly still, absorbing the hectic vibrations that surround me. It’s all very dreamlike. I’m a fallen branch lodged between stones in the midst of a moving stream, about to disentangle and be swept along with the current…  
Moments later, I spot Peggy maneuvering toward me waving her boarding pass merrily.  
With a shaky smile, I wave mine back.  
Ready for take-off.

Chapter 13: London Calling

Let’s face it, it’s always a tremendously good feeling when – after a nearly 8-hour flight – you’re standing in the baggage claim area when you suddenly hear your so-called friend’s resounding voice (yes, that would be Janet) ricocheting off the airport terminal walls:  
“GOOD LORD, LENA! You look HORRIBLE!”  
Really, really uplifting stuff. Enhanced by the fact that I actually FEEL horrible. Me and Peggy, both smokers, ask for seats in the smoking section. Mistake. Colossal, revolting, putrid mistake. For the entire flight, everyone and their grandmother takes turns coming back to our section in order to huff away like fiends. I am talkin’ puffing like they are on death fucking row. After the first half hour of the flight, I can’t look at another cigarette much less smoke one. The 2nd-hand smoke from this flight alone probably did me more damage than 15 years of my habit. And THEN there’ s the extra-special TURBULENCE BONUS that caps off the final hour of the flight, delaying our landing and completing the repulsion factor. My complexion is milky chartreuse by the time I stagger offa that plane. I feel like I need an oxygen mask. So yeah, by the time Janet is shouting her obnoxious ‘greeting’, I just want to vomit and collapse somewhere.  
The time difference messes with me too, that first day. From Heathrow Airport, we go for a quick beer and a bite at a local pub before hitting Janet’s flat for a nap. A few hours rest, a shower later and – Voila! – we were ready to go pubbing, proper. The London holiday is ON.  
Janet is in top form for the first couple of days. Hilarious, gracious and full of stories about the court case she’s working on. Her London flat is pristine, modern and classy. So much so that it seems unlived in, reminding me of a model home. She escorts us all over town like a professional tour guide. She makes sure that we check out all the pertinent highlights: Piccadilly Circus, Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abby, The Changing of the Guard, London’s famed Theatre District, countless castles and charming pubs which range from the homey and quaint to the sophisticated and refined. And of course Abbey Road recording studio is also on our list, but we are waiting for the end of the week for that. As Janet lustily proclaims: “SAVING THE BEST FOR LAST!”  
Peggy’s companionship – as predicted – is an effortless joy. We three are having a swell time. All is very glam and extraordinary, free-flowing and fine. One really could not ask for more.

Pubs close early in London, usually by 10:00 or 11:00 p.m. It was perhaps our second or third full day of sight-seeing followed by pubbing. We brought some wine, beer and snacks back to Janet’s flat and hunkered down for an old-fashioned girl’s night of booze and gossip.  
The three of us were lounging on cushy floor pillows, situated around a granite coffee table in the middle of the cozy sunken living room.  
Me: “Ahhhh….. (taking a long sip of wine before lighting a cig) “The only thing missing right now is my dog’s head on my lap. Damn, I am missing my Girlie.”  
Peggy: (with a start) “Oh shit – that reminds me. I told my husband I’d call tonight. Can I use your phone, Janet? It won’t take a minute.”  
She makes the call, never leaving her cushioned seat on the floor and it doesn’t take  
much more than a minute. Just a casual ‘checking in’ kinda thing. Me and Janet remain courteously silent throughout.  
After she hangs up, Peggy tentatively offers me the phone: “Do you need to call Shawn…?”  
Me: “Oh, no – that’s okay. He’s probably not even home.”  
Janet: (sarcastic humor) “Well then, perhaps you’d like to call your DOG?”  
Me: (cracking up, along with Peggy) “Hey, if only I could! I love that dog.”  
Janet: “Yeah, I’d swear you miss that dog more than you miss Shawn.”  
I look at her, struck dumb for a moment. Suddenly I felt like unburdening.  
Me: “Now that you mention it, Janet – that’s probably the god’s-honest truth.”  
Janet: “What is?”  
Me: “I’d say I DEFINITELY miss my dog more than I miss my husband.”  
Janet: “Really!”  
Peggy: (laugh) “Quite the statement! But hey, I totally miss my dog, too.”  
Me: (haltingly): “Yeah, but I’ve been feeling like…I dunno.” They were both looking at me, waiting.  
“…it’s just…me and Shawn. The whole situation. I think … it may have run its course.”  
Janet: (stating in an ironic monotone): “ ‘Run it’s course.’ You think it’s ‘run it’s course’ ”.  
Me: “Yeah. I think so. I just don’t think we have much of anything in common anymore.”  
Janet: (with some alarm) “Hold on now, Lena. Shawn is a TERRIFIC guy…”  
Me: “Sure, I know he’s a good guy. Of course I know that. But that’s got nothing to do with what’s going on with us.”  
Janet: “But you guys always get along GREAT!”  
Me: “Ha – really? You KNOW this, huh? I guess you LIVE with us?”  
Janet: “No, I don’t LIVE with you, but…”  
Me: “Because people grow apart, Janet. Situations change.”  
Peggy pipes in: “That is true. Relationships change all the time…”  
Janet: “Look, Lena – if I were you, I’d give it a little time. You might just be going through a phase, because you’re so involved with your music right now and…”  
Me: “No, it’s not that. It’s not the music. Things just don’t feel right. They haven’t for awhile. And… oh, man, honestly…? Shawn was probably never the right one.”  
Silence. Clock ticking on the wall. Street noise down below.  
Peggy: “Wow.” (slugs back some beer) “Well, that’s heavy. That’s some heavy shit, alright.”  
I look at Janet. Her eyes are fixed on her beer bottle, lips pursed, shaking her head slightly.  
Then she just murmurs, to the bottle: “I don’t know. I don’t know what to tell you.”  
Then she gets up and puts on a record. Oasis, I think.  
We drink some more and talk about other things. Minor, trivial things. I couldn’t tell you what.  
After awhile, I go off to bed.

Honestly, I’m not sure if this will interest anyone, but let’s imagine this as my personal diary where I’ll share my thoughts and achievements. Seems I’ve gotten a bit sidetracked, so let’s start from the beginning.
My name is MrBurNik, or simply Mr. B. I’ve set myself a goal: I want to become the number one player in Minecraft. Yes, it sounds ambitious, but my main aim is to bring a bit more fun into the world. If my attempts to conquer Minecraft’s peak make you smile, I’ll be thrilled.
What am I doing to achieve this? Right now, I’m training with a PvP bot. Know the CombatWorld map? That’s where I’m practicing basic 1.9 PvP. My fingers are too slow for older PvP versions! I’m doing well at the first speed and trying to fight at the third. Occasionally, I join PvP Legacy to test myself against real players, but it’s tough — they often keep me out of striking range 😅. I haven’t tried Crystal PvP yet; first, I want to train my fingers so they don’t mix up block placements and order.
Also, I’m learning redstone and Minecraft commands. Commands aren’t super necessary, but redstone is a fascinating tool, useful in both survival and combat. Parkour… That’s still a tough challenge for me. Not much else to say… Oh wait! I’m also trying to master ninja bridging for Bedwars, though I’m not sure why, since Hypixel uses older PvP versions.

**The Teacher**

The coffee was too hot, and still I drank it like it owed me answers.

It scalded my tongue on the first sip. I didn’t care.

The windshield of my car reflected nothing but clouds—gray, low, indecisive. Like the sky was trying to make up its mind about whether to fall or just watch.

I leaned back in the seat, coffee steaming in one hand, guilt simmering in the other.

I’d told her off. Again.

Told her the world didn’t need more polished predators with god complexes. Told her saving lives didn’t mean choosing which ones were worth saving. Told her I was done burying students.

And still…

Why the hell did they send the Council?

Why push me?

They knew what I was. What I’d done.

Three years ago, I pushed a boy with seismic potential too far—trying to awaken him, trigger that “adaptive surge” the Association loves to whisper about behind bulletproof glass. He cracked the floor open under his own feet and didn’t come back up.

No plaque. No ceremony.

Just silence.

Another file closed.

And now they want me to do it again. To them.

I looked down at the clipboard on the passenger seat. Half a dozen names, half a dozen fractures barely held together. All staring at a cliff they didn’t even know was coming.

I finished the coffee. Tossed the cup onto the floor.

The echo of plastic hitting plastic sounded final.

⸻

I arrived ten minutes late.

They were already in the classroom.

Tasha had her feet on the desk like she owned the place. Danny was sketching blood patterns in the corner of a notebook. Livia and Sofia were whispering about something that made both of them smirk. Gabe was balancing a pen on one finger while the twins next to him tried to copy.

And Leo?

Leo sat in the same chair. Same spot.

But the air around him felt thin.

I stepped in.

Silence didn’t follow me. That was good. Normal.

I cleared my throat. “Alright. Field trip.”

Heads turned. Tasha perked up. Danny narrowed his eyes. Leo blinked slowly.

“A test?” Gabe asked.

“A surprise,” I replied. “Bring your boots. You’ll hate it.”

Mild groaning. No actual complaints.

They followed.

⸻

The training arena was already prepped.

No turrets today. No drones. No fake walls or automated hazards.

Just a wide, sunless dome with slick concrete floors and a few dim lights hanging from chains.

And Elis.

She stood at the center of the room like a statue that had been waiting too long to move.

Elis didn’t look like someone who belonged here. Too elegant. Too contained. Pale skin, black hair tied in a low braid, eyes blue enough to drown in. Her uniform was standard black—custom-fit, sleeveless, with the Association’s red insignia on one shoulder—but she wore it like it meant something ancient.

Some of the kids stiffened when they saw her. Others didn’t recognize her. Leo, of course, barely reacted.

“Elis,” I said, nodding once. “Thanks for doing this.”

“Anything to see your little disasters in action,” she replied, voice light and dark at the same time.

I turned to the students.

“Today’s test isn’t about reflexes. It’s about response under stress. You’ll be partnered up and given targets. Not machines. Not code. Something closer to the real thing.”

I let that hang.

Then Elis raised her left hand.

A short blade, elegant and silver, slid from a sheath at her hip.

She sliced a line across her palm. Blood welled—bright, clean, intentional.

She flicked it.

One drop.

It landed on the chest of the nearest corpse.

Yes. Corpse.

There were four. Laid out on stretchers. Clean. Preserved. Donated.

The Association called them “silent volunteers.”

The moment her blood touched it, the body shuddered.

Then sat up.

Its head lolled. Its fingers curled. Muscles flexed like someone was puppeteering them from the inside.

The kids backed up. Sofia let out a soft curse.

“These aren’t monsters,” Elis said calmly. “They’re tools. Empty. Programmed only to move on command. They can’t think. They can’t feel. They don’t remember who they were. They’re shells. Extensions of me.”

She snapped her fingers.

The second corpse sat up.

Then the third.

Danny stared.

Gabe looked nauseous.

Leo didn’t blink.

Perfect.

⸻

“Group one,” I called. “Danny and Bea. Front and center.”

Danny stepped forward with the weight of someone carrying more than just his own power. Bea bounced next to him, all nerves and sugar-induced adrenaline. She chewed a gummy as she walked. Probably raspberry. Her pupils dilated.

“Elis, corpse one. Advance at 30% speed.”

The first body moved with an eerie grace—head tilted, steps stiff but steady, eyes glassy.

Danny’s hands were already red. He didn’t need to cut anymore—just call.

The blood came to him like it wanted revenge.

Bea raised a hand. “It’s sour,” she muttered, blinking hard. “Left side.”

Danny pivoted.

The corpse twitched.

Bea’s eyes widened. “More sour. Definitely the liver.”

Danny exhaled, spread his fingers—and for a brief, brilliant second, the blood condensed like a bullet.

Then came the hit.

The corpse swung wide, fist cracking into Danny’s ribs. He staggered.

Bea yelped. “I said liver, not deliver!”

Danny clenched his jaw, caught his breath—and that’s when I saw it.

Control.

He gripped the air like reins, and the blood snapped inward. Tight. Pressurized.

He thrust forward, and the crimson shot like a spear straight through the corpse’s shoulder. It spun. Dropped.

Danny didn’t move.

He just breathed. Heavy. But steady.

Bea grinned. “That’s my boy.”

I scribbled a note: “Danny—starting to aim his blood. Finally.”

⸻

“Next. Gabe and Trent.”

Gabe walked like a guy who’d been preparing excuses all morning. Trent looked like a human stress ball wrapped in too much static.

“Corpse two. Moderate aggression,” I ordered.

The zombie charged.

Gabe reacted first—too fast. He launched a shockwave with both palms wide, but his aim was off. The blast clipped the corpse’s leg, spun it, and nearly took out Trent in the process.

“Dude!” Trent yelped.

“Move faster!” Gabe snapped.

Trent gritted his teeth, sparks forming under his soles.

And then… nothing.

Just static.

“Try again!” Gabe barked.

Trent yelled, lifted both arms—and accidentally discharged through his own boots, sending himself skidding across the floor like a sad electric surfboard.

The zombie advanced.

Gabe turned, this time more focused. He narrowed his stance, bent one knee, angled his arm—boom.

Clean hit.

The corpse jerked back, chest caved.

Trent groaned on the floor. “Did we win?”

“Technically,” I muttered.

Elis raised an eyebrow. I shrugged.

⸻

“Sofia and Mina.”

Sofia stepped up, calm and soft-spoken as always, but her fingers were already twitching. Her spiders, hidden in the sleeves, pulsed with anticipation. Mina sneezed twice on the way up. Vines curled around her ankles like loyal pets.

“Corpse three. Go.”

The body walked slow. But it was enough.

Sofia whispered. Two small spiders scurried down her arms and darted toward the corpse’s feet.

They didn’t attack—they tangled. Threads of silk looped around the ankles.

The zombie paused.

Mina sneezed again.

A patch of moss erupted across the floor, vines writhing like confused snakes.

The zombie kicked free. Sofia frowned, adjusted her stance, and whispered louder—this time, three spiders jumped.

One landed on the chest. Another on the face.

And the third?

Bit the exposed neck.

It didn’t bleed. But it staggered.

Mina coughed, and a cluster of roots burst up under the corpse, wrapping it like a mummy.

Sofia wiped her forehead. Mina sniffled. “We done?”

“Done,” I said.

They smiled. Together.

I made another note: “Sofia—beginning to direct. Mina—chaotic but useful.”

⸻

“Tasha. Clint. Let’s see what you’ve got.”

Tasha stormed forward like the corpse owed her money. Clint trailed behind, eyes half-closed, hands twitching as if reaching for seatbelts that weren’t there.

The fourth corpse, newly risen, looked more aggressive. Elis hadn’t even gestured—just thought it—and it moved.

Tasha flared both palms. Electricity danced like a living thing across her fingers.

Clint stood five meters away and muttered, “Target… locked.”

“What are you doing?” Tasha hissed.

“Unbuckling its kinetic field,” Clint said calmly, staring.

“Dude it doesn’t even have—”

The corpse lunged.

Tasha exploded—literally. A shockwave burst from her chest, sending the zombie flying.

And Clint?

He blinked. “You’re welcome.”

“I hate you,” Tasha said.

But she was smiling.

So was I.

⸻

Then came the last.

“Nico. Livia. Final round before review.”

Nico flickered before even stepping forward—his body glitching like old footage. Livia walked calmly, sketchpad in hand, already drawing what hadn’t happened yet.

“You sure he’s solid enough for this?” I asked.

“I exist,” Nico snapped, then immediately faded for half a second.

“Mostly,” I muttered.

Elis reset the first corpse.

“Same instructions. Go.”

Nico vanished—intentionally this time—and reappeared behind the zombie.

He punched.

His hand phased through.

“Oops.”

Livia didn’t blink. She flipped the sketchpad, showing a rough frame of the zombie’s next step.

Nico dodged before it happened.

Twice.

On the third try, he landed a half-kick that disrupted the zombie’s balance.

It fell.

Livia didn’t smile, but her pencil paused.

I made the note: “Livia—precog predictive. Nico—needs mass stabilization.”

Then I looked at Leo.

And the world got quiet again…

⸻

“Leo.”

The name echoed louder than it should have.

He looked up like it surprised him. Like he hadn’t realized he was in the room until I said it.

I pointed to the center of the arena. “You’re up.”

He didn’t move.

Just sat there. Frozen. Not stubborn—uncertain.

“Leo,” I repeated, softer this time.

His eyes locked onto mine.

“Are… are you seeing me?” he asked, voice thin, like it might disappear mid-sentence.

That hit something in my chest I didn’t expect.

The kids turned.

Some curious. Some confused.

And then, from the back—someone yelled it:

“Go, Leo!”

A simple cheer.

But it landed like a slap.

He flinched.

Literally flinched.

Like being seen hurt.

And then, slowly, hesitantly, he stood.

Each step toward the arena looked like it took negotiation. Not with me. Not with the corpse waiting. With reality itself.

Like he was stepping into a place he didn’t believe would hold him.

He reached the center.

I glanced at Elis.

“Target Four. Minimal resistance. Now.”

She nodded, one brow raised. A flick of her fingers sent the last corpse forward. The blood was already inside it. Already bound.

It jerked to life and stumbled toward him.

And Leo?

Didn’t move.

Didn’t breathe.

Just stood there.

Staring at the thing like it wasn’t real…

⸻

**Leo**

It saw me.

It actually saw me.

I don’t know what’s worse—being invisible, or suddenly not.

I looked up and the teacher—he saw me.

He said my name.

He pointed.

And then someone shouted it.

“Go, Leo!”

Like I was part of this.

Like I belonged here.

Like I… existed.

And that’s when it hit me.

They all see me now.

Every eye. Every breath. Every heartbeat in this room—it’s aimed at me.

And I don’t want it.

I don’t want to be known.

I don’t want to be.

But it’s too late.

The corpse is coming.

Staggering.

Eyes blank. Limbs crooked.

A puppet full of old rules and fresh blood.

It sees me too.

It’s going to touch me.

It’s going to hurt me.

I want it gone.

I want it gone more than anything I’ve ever wanted.

And suddenly—

I forget I’m not supposed to have power.

I forget I’m supposed to be nothing.

And I say it.

Not loud.

Not dramatic.

Just… true.

“Disappear.”

And it does.

No sound. No light. No crash.

Just—

Gone.

Like it never existed.

Silence floods in behind it.

Cold. Stunned. Real.

I blink.

Everyone’s still staring.

And this time… no one forgets.

Not even me…

1lwvpit,https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkshopWonders/comments/1lwvpit/my_first_attempt_at_building_a_diy/,My First Attempt at Building a DIY Workbench—Lessons Learned (and a Few Scratches),"I’ve been wanting a proper workbench in my garage for years, but store-bought options felt either too flimsy or way out of my budget. So last weekend, I decided to take the plunge and build one myself. I started by watching a few tutorials on basic carpentry, but nothing prepares you for the real thing—like realizing mid-project that my measurements were off by half an inch, or that the wood I picked was heavier than I anticipated.

First, I sketched out a simple design: a sturdy frame with a plywood top, storage shelves underneath, and a vice for holding projects. I gathered scrap wood from a friend’s construction site, bought a few brackets and screws, and cleared out a corner of the garage. Let me tell you, drilling straight holes is harder than it looks. I went through three drill bits because I kept angling them wrong, and by noon, my hands were covered in tiny splinters. 

But here’s the thing: when I finally got the frame standing, wobbly at first but fixable with a few adjustments, I felt this weird sense of pride. I added shims to level it, sanded the edges until they were smooth, and even stained it a dark brown to hide future mistakes. It’s not perfect—the shelves are a little uneven, and I definitely over-tightened a few screws—but it’s mine. 

Now, every time I walk into the garage, I smile. It’s become a spot where I fix my bike, tinker with old tools, and even set down my morning coffee while planning my next project. I’m already thinking about upgrades: maybe adding a pegboard for hanging tools, or a power strip built into the side. 

Has anyone else built something functional from scratch, only to learn more from the mistakes than the successes? What’s one tool or trick you wish you knew before starting your first big workshop project? I’m all ears—this is just the beginning of my DIY journey, and I need all the wisdom I can get.",1,1752201841.0,WorkshopWonders,0,1.0,False

Their eyes light up a shade brighter, and they tilt their heads so that they are making eye contact with me. This lasts maybe a quarter of a second, and then they are all back to what they were doing.



I’m not sure if it’s just in my head, but the kids playing soccer seem to be running a little slower. They seem to kick the ball a little more gently. After less than five minutes the game wraps up and they all walk inside. They’ve never walked inside during Sunny Day before. I wonder if they’re scared.



Over the next few days things seem better in the world. I watch a busy road for hours. I click the fast forward button and see that time speeds up tenfold, and yet there are no accidents. Even after five days of in-game time I see no signs of violence, crime, or tragedy.



The next day I’m so busy with school and homework that I don’t have a chance to get back on the game until late evening. I log on and see in my starter neighborhood that no one is outside. I click into the red house and see that the family is having dinner at a long, rectangular dining table.



The first thing I notice is that none of them are looking at each other. I’ve watched a few of these dinners before. It’s always quick movement of hands and constant eating, crumbs falling out of mouths as the family talks and jokes. It’s unnerving. My first instinct is to click out of the house to go check on the other families, but then I notice the second thing.



On each of their plates is a slab of something that looks like meatloaf. Only, it’s a shade of green that resembles cartoon puke. Worse still, each loaf is covered with bugs like roaches. No one dares take a bite. I fast forward. They all stay still for game-time 35 minutes before the dad gets up from the table.



I follow him as he walks upstairs to a bedroom. Then into a closet. I lose him in the darkness for a moment before he walks out holding an orange box. He places it down on the floor and looks up at me. His eyes are twitching. I think I see a hint of anger. Defiance?



In my mind I’m reaching for the power button on my computer, but in reality I’m stuck to my seat. Somehow I know what’s going to happen next.



“Don’t,” I say. “Please don’t.”



But he doesn’t listen. He reaches into the box and pulls out a small revolver. He loads it with a golden bullet and holds it to his temple, then pulls the trigger.



I’ve watched the goriest movies you can imagine. I’ve played every horror video game you can think of, and I’ve seen relatives die in front of me on 2 separate occasions, one of them from a gunshot. But nothing could have prepared me for the sheer terror I feel as I watch this stick figure fall slowly to the floor, blood trickling slowly out of his head until it puddles around his body.



Within a few seconds the mom and her son are over him. Neither of them seem to react other than by looking at him. 



He was depressed, I realize. My last message took danger out of the world, but it seemed that it also removed all happiness.



The last thing I do before I shut off my computer is click on the message bar and write, “I will be happy.”



I sleep fitfully, waking up from nightmares several times. Despite how tired I am, I force myself to go to school. Anything to get out of that room. 



Mr. Obeses, my religion teacher, talks about how everything happens in accordance with God’s will. He says that everything has a deeper meaning, even tragedy and suffering. “Nothing exists that God didn’t create,” he says.



 Immediately I’m reminded of when I was a little kid at Walmart and I asked my dad who invented video games. He paused for a second then replied, “God. God created everything.”



I remember asking him if God created bombs too, and when he said yes I asked if that meant God killed people.



He told me to stop asking questions.



But the memory makes me want to ask one more, this time to Mr. Obeses. I raise my hand.



“Yes?” He asks.



“Does that mean when people get cancer or die it’s because God wants them to? Could he stop all pain if he wanted to?” The girl in front of me gasps, and the whispers behind me stop as the class goes completely silent.



“Exactly!” Mr. Obeses says, as if it was the question he’d been waiting for since class started. “He could end it all if he wanted, but why doesn’t he?” He pauses and looks around the room, then turns his palms up and shrugs. “Why doesn’t God get rid of all suffering? Why doesn’t he make it so that we’re all happy all the time?”



A kid in the back of class raises his hand. “Because God gave us all free will. We have the ability to do bad things, but it’s up to us to choose not to. That’s how we prove that we’re good.”



“But what about earthquakes, hurricanes, or tornadoes?” Mr. Obeses asks. “Those cause suffering too, don’t they? Can you explain that?”



“People have to suffer to grow,” a girl to my right says. “And we need to grow in order to be ready for heaven.”



“But why so much suffering then?” Mr. Obeses continues. “Why do some people suffer more than others? Why isn’t it all equal?”



The class is silent for a long time as we all process these ideas. Sure, it’s not anything that most of us haven’t heard or thought of before, but to hear it come from a wise Christian teacher like Mr. Obeses was shocking. Normally teachers and pastors have all the answers. They never ask us questions or open up conversations to anything that might seem questioning of God.



Eventually, I speak up. “Maybe God isn’t perfect,” I say. 



There are gasps, murmurs of dissent, and one kid even lets out a shocked, “WHAT?!”



I continue. “Maybe God is growing along with us. Maybe he doesn’t know what to do any more than we do. Maybe… maybe the world is like a ship and God is the captain… he can steer us in the right direction, but… maybe he can’t control the waves?”  
  


People are laughing about how stupid I sound, but I look up at Mr. Obeses for approval, and see that he is nodding slowly. The bell rings and he finishes his thoughts as we all start heading for the door. “The only thing we know is that God is perfect in his wisdom and goodness. As long as we follow him, the rest will work out. Have a good day everyone.”



*What if he’s wrong?* I think as I walk out of the classroom. *What if God is just doing his best? What if he built something that he can’t control, and now he doesn’t know what to do?*



When I load up the game tonight, I look at the house where the dad killed himself. The houses all around his look normal. Lights are on, families are eating dinner. I go to the family's house and see that they too are eating. I fully expect to see that the dad is back, alive and well, as if the game resets itself every time I log off, but that isn’t the case. Not entirely.



The mom and her son turn to look at me as I enter the room. They are sitting across from each other and eating meatloaf that looks more or less normal. White jagged lines of smiles stretch almost from ear to ear as if it were cut into their faces. They don’t stop smiling even as they turn and lift food into their mouths.



What’s even more disturbing is that the dad is sitting where he always has. Only, he didn’t turn when I entered the room. He is slumped to one side, a hole in his head allowing me to see all the way through him between pieces of bone and pink and red muscle. His skin is peeled back in some places, revealing worms that are furiously burrowing into him. So quick and furious that red, pink, and grey specks are falling to the ground around his chair like debris from a rock.



Yet, the son and his mom continue to talk and eat, sometimes looking at the dad and laughing as if he said something funny. Eventually they throw their heads back and start laughing so hard that tiny blue tears stream down their faces and fall to the floor. I watch this for about half a minute before I hit the fast forward button.. They laugh for fifteen minutes straight before they each get up and kiss the dad on his cheek.



The boy goes outside and the mom starts cleaning up.



I exit the house and watch over the neighborhood as the boys play soccer. They’re having more fun than ever. They run faster, laugh louder. It seems like they’re trying harder than ever to win, yet even when the opponents score or make a nice block, the kids only high-five and hug.



I’m starting to think that the family situation is something that I should just forget about. A bug in the game or a weird way of coping with death. I’ve done right by this world.



But then the goalie makes a sliding play to stop a goal, but underestimates his speed and goes face first into the goalpost. His face is repelled backward so hard that it’s almost flat against his back. For a second his eyes are closed and everything is still. I’m afraid that he might be dead. *Brain damage? Broken neck?*



But when he shakes his head fiercely I sigh in relief. I’m about to shut down my computer when I see that he is now laughing. He turns to look at me with a wide smile on his face. Then, he turns back to the goalpost and starts slamming his head against it over and over. Blood is flying everywhere but the laughter doesn’t stop. Other boys surround him and start to join in until tears and blood fill the air like a soft, silent rain.



I’m crying and I can’t stop. I don’t know what to do. How can I save these people? I watch as they all laugh and try desperately to hurt themselves. Parents watching from windows run outside to the goalposts like little children hustling to an ice cream truck.When there is no more space on either goalpost they move to the sidewalks and slam their heads against the concrete. Their eyes bounce from side to side in their heads. Teeth fly from their mouths, but each second their smiles become wider and wider. 



I click onto the thought bar, but I realize that I don’t know what to say. How can I possibly say the right thing?



Is this how God feels? Does he try desperately to steer us, but all the while we’re surrounded by waves from a wild storm? 



Does God sit in front of a screen and watch as we kill each other and ourselves? Has he tried to stop car accidents, only to realize that the alternative is worse? Has he told us to be happy, only to realize that we find happiness in our own demise?



Our world is at least better than the one I’ve created here. What would our God do? I glance back at the screen and see that the violence hasn’t stopped. More people are joining. I don’t know where they’re coming from. Everyone is so happy, I’ve never seen so many people so fucking happy.



I’m sobbing and my mom is knocking on my door. “Gregory!” She yells. “Gregory what’s wrong?!”



*Go back to normal,* I write. *And everything will be okay.* I put my head in my hands and try to quiet my sobs.



“I was laughing!” I yell as I hit enter.



All of these dozens of people, they snap their heads to look at me, and then they’re all helping each other back to their feet and to their houses. Within a minute the street is clear.



My ears are so full of air that I don’t realize that my mom has entered the room until she puts a hand on my shoulder. I flinch backward so hard that my head connects with her chin and makes a loud *pop.*



As she’s looking down and holding her chin, I shut my PC off.



“What have you been doing?” She asks, her eyes narrow.



“I was watching a movie,” I say. “It got sad.”



“You realize how suspicious it is when you turn something off right when I enter the room, right? It makes me wonder what kind of movie you were watching.”



“I was just getting ready to go to bed.”



“Uh-huh. Well just remember, God’s always watching.”



I lay in bed for hours, but all I can think about is the people in my game. My mom’s words echo in my ears. *God is always watching.* She said it as if to imply she thought I was watching porn or something, but the reality is that if God exists, he should always be watching. He can see if you do bad things, but he can also see if bad things are going to happen to you. God isn’t supposed to abandon you. And how hurt are you when you feel like he does?



It’s 3:00 am when I get up from bed and turn my computer back on. I load up the game and check on my neighborhood. It’s night time. All traces of the violence from the day before are gone. I walk into the family’s house and see that they’re safe and sound, asleep. The dad is nowhere to be found. I guess they finally buried him.



I’m grateful that he’s finally been put to rest. I say a silent apology to his empty spot in the bed and head back outside.



I fast forward through the day and everything seems great. Kids go to school, parents go to work, and at the end of the day they all come home. They eat dinner together, they do homework, and they play games outside.



Once I’m sure that the neighborhood is back to normal, I go back to watching over the city. People move happily through downtown. They stop at candy shops, they buy clothes in the mall. At one point I even see a heart signifying that two people on a coffee date have fallen in love.



There are a few car accidents and a fight in a bar, but I’m starting to realize that these are small costs for the happiness that comes with free will. I’m pretty content. I feel like it might be time to let the game go. I’ve done all I can, and making any more changes just risks causing more issues. 



I’m scrolling over one town when I see a small red building roughly resembling a barn. I scroll completely past it before I realize that there is something different about the building. I go back and see that on the wall above the front door is an object resembling a cross, only, at each end there’s a twisted hook, a sharp point jutting out as if to catch prey by the flesh of a cheek. As I venture around the building I see that each side has this same symbol. 



The thought never crossed my mind until now, but it makes sense that some sort of religion would come eventually. They parallel us in every way, don’t they? They play sports, they have houses, they drive cars, they go to work.



They need something to believe in too, don’t they? 



There’s a burning numbness in my chest. It’s something between shame, anger, and fear. If they’re worshipping something, whether they know it or not, it has to be me. And how dare they worship me? And why do I deserve to be worshipped? I didn’t know that any of this was going to happen; I didn’t want any of this to happen. 



I didn’t know that this world was going to be so real. And it is so real. These people have families and feelings and emotions, they experience pain and happiness and love, and they *do* exist when I’m not watching. So who’s to say they’re any less real than us? And how could I, accepting that they’re real, not do my best to help them? How could I sit back and watch them die and not do anything? Whether I like it or not, I have become their God.



I’m crying and holding my head in my hands. I want to turn off my computer and never turn it back on again. I want to delete the game, but then, how would I feel if God abandoned me? And how can I leave without knowing the truth of this world? What is happening in that church?



I click to walk inside. To my left and right there is a group of five people each. They are all holding hands and nodding as they stare at a man who is waving his arms erratically. His mouth opens and closes at a constant pace, as if he is only letting out short bursts of syllables.



I want so badly to hear what he’s saying. Is it something about me? Do they know who I am?



Suddenly I’m having trouble catching my breath. I look over my shoulder at my open closet door. I can’t shake the feeling that I’m being watched, that someone wants to hurt me, and that, maybe, I deserve it. 



Back in the game I see a man sitting in the corner scribbling notes frantically. Sweat drips down the sides of his face. He flips page after page until he fills the book, then he reaches onto the floor and grabs a new one.



I move behind him and take a look at what he’s writing. It’s English, clear as day. 



If I could physically interact with this world I would reach over his shoulder and tear the book away, or better yet, grab for the one on the ground. I could read every word and understand what’s going on. I so desperately want to understand what’s going on.



If their religion is as developed as ours but wrong, does that serve to prove that our religion isn’t real? That anything with complex thought is simply destined to look for meaning where there isn’t any?



If their religion is the same as ours, aligning with Christianity, or Islam, or some other known religion, does that serve to prove that religion as an intrinsic truth? Somehow ingrained inside of anyone capable of meta thought? 



If their religion includes *me*, if they are right, does that mean they think that I can save them? Does it mean that they’ll ask me for help that I can’t provide?



I watch the notetaker for nearly an hour. He writes at an inhuman pace but never slows down. He writes faster than I can read, but here is the gist of what I can make out.



He seems to be writing a never ending list of proofs that a higher being exists. Some of them are trivial things such as the fact that this world came to exist in the first place. He references what must be other planets that don’t have life, he talks about how incredible the world is, about their wide array of experiences and emotions. He goes on and on for pages and pages.



Then, he circles in on more specific proofs. He writes about the world changing so suddenly and vastly in short periods of time. He references personal experiences from himself and his acquaintances suddenly feeling the urge to look at a specific point in the distance, how they each felt with surging confidence that they were so close to looking in on something that was looking back, like someone was staring at them from a curtain that was translucent on only one side. 



They’re talking about my commands—about when I put thoughts in their head. Somehow, they could feel that I was watching.



Now, I feel like I’m being watched provocatively through a hole in my wall that I wasn’t aware of until just now. As I read these words, I feel the urge to cover up, like I can hide from these realizations. 



He writes about how, at certain times, the world seems to have shifts in mindsets simultaneously, as if God were pulling a switch or pushing a button. *It’s as if this God is trying to fix our world’s problems,* he writes. *But is failing miserably.* 



The last words I read before the speech ends and the book closes is*, Our only solution is to ask him to kill us all. But how do we ask? That’s the question that we must answer.*



All I wanted to do was make a video game. All I wanted to do was play a game that was *different;* one where I had an illusion of control over something bigger than myself



But no, the illusion has turned into reality. I’m not playing Sims and controlling little make believe people with no feelings and emotions. These aren’t things that stop existing when I stop watching. I’ve brought people into the world against their will. I’m torturing them, and they want it to stop but they don’t know how to make it stop. 



The only thing they know for a fact is that *I* know how to make it stop. And yet, I don’t. I wish it could be so simple as deleting the game or even destroying my computer. But then, I have no way of knowing if the world would continue to exist in my absence. They’d become a world with a God who abandoned them.



I can try to kill them all. I can code nukes into the game and blow everything up, but then… will the world really cease to exist, or would a new species be born only to undergo the same fate? This reminds me of dinosaurs and a meteor. Maybe the same mistake has been made before.



I can simply ignore the game and try to forget it ever existed, but then, how could I live knowing that bad things will continue to happen? Every loss, every death, every pain as small as a stubbed toe or as painful as watching your son die in a car crash would be all thanks to me. 



In that sense, these people are right. The noblest thing I can do is destroy this world. Every happy memory and positive outcome nulled will pale in comparison to the infinite pain and suffering I will end.



But how do I do it?



To these people, the greatest problem is only how to ask to be killed, they believe it is up to them to find a way to ask and that once they do so, their problems will be solved. It never crossed their minds that God doesn’t have the power. It hasn’t crossed their minds that they’ve done everything right. It hasn’t crossed their minds that their creator is too weak and stupid to do the right thing, no matter how much he wants to.



I look all around the world I’ve created. I see happy families. I see cemeteries and hospitals. I see kids playing soccer, and as I fast forward through the weeks I see new churches popping up almost every day.



These people are starting to realize that something bigger is watching over them, and all they want is for me to show them mercy.



But I can’t.



All I can do is delete the game, turn off my computer, and try to forget this ever happened.



But I ask you this: What if our God has turned off his computer?

Their eyes light up a shade brighter, and they tilt their heads so that they are making eye contact with me. This lasts maybe a quarter of a second, and then they are all back to what they were doing.



I’m not sure if it’s just in my head, but the kids playing soccer seem to be running a little slower. They seem to kick the ball a little more gently. After less than five minutes the game wraps up and they all walk inside. They’ve never walked inside during Sunny Day before. I wonder if they’re scared.



Over the next few days things seem better in the world. I watch a busy road for hours. I click the fast forward button and see that time speeds up tenfold, and yet there are no accidents. Even after five days of in-game time I see no signs of violence, crime, or tragedy.



The next day I’m so busy with school and homework that I don’t have a chance to get back on the game until late evening. I log on and see in my starter neighborhood that no one is outside. I click into the red house and see that the family is having dinner at a long, rectangular dining table.



The first thing I notice is that none of them are looking at each other. I’ve watched a few of these dinners before. It’s always quick movement of hands and constant eating, crumbs falling out of mouths as the family talks and jokes. It’s unnerving. My first instinct is to click out of the house to go check on the other families, but then I notice the second thing.



On each of their plates is a slab of something that looks like meatloaf. Only, it’s a shade of green that resembles cartoon puke. Worse still, each loaf is covered with bugs like roaches. No one dares take a bite. I fast forward. They all stay still for game-time 35 minutes before the dad gets up from the table.



I follow him as he walks upstairs to a bedroom. Then into a closet. I lose him in the darkness for a moment before he walks out holding an orange box. He places it down on the floor and looks up at me. His eyes are twitching. I think I see a hint of anger. Defiance?



In my mind I’m reaching for the power button on my computer, but in reality I’m stuck to my seat. Somehow I know what’s going to happen next.



“Don’t,” I say. “Please don’t.”



But he doesn’t listen. He reaches into the box and pulls out a small revolver. He loads it with a golden bullet and holds it to his temple, then pulls the trigger.



I’ve watched the goriest movies you can imagine. I’ve played every horror video game you can think of, and I’ve seen relatives die in front of me on 2 separate occasions, one of them from a gunshot. But nothing could have prepared me for the sheer terror I feel as I watch this stick figure fall slowly to the floor, blood trickling slowly out of his head until it puddles around his body.



Within a few seconds the mom and her son are over him. Neither of them seem to react other than by looking at him. 



He was depressed, I realize. My last message took danger out of the world, but it seemed that it also removed all happiness.



The last thing I do before I shut off my computer is click on the message bar and write, “I will be happy.”



I sleep fitfully, waking up from nightmares several times. Despite how tired I am, I force myself to go to school. Anything to get out of that room. 



Mr. Obeses, my religion teacher, talks about how everything happens in accordance with God’s will. He says that everything has a deeper meaning, even tragedy and suffering. “Nothing exists that God didn’t create,” he says.



 Immediately I’m reminded of when I was a little kid at Walmart and I asked my dad who invented video games. He paused for a second then replied, “God. God created everything.”



I remember asking him if God created bombs too, and when he said yes I asked if that meant God killed people.



He told me to stop asking questions.



But the memory makes me want to ask one more, this time to Mr. Obeses. I raise my hand.



“Yes?” He asks.



“Does that mean when people get cancer or die it’s because God wants them to? Could he stop all pain if he wanted to?” The girl in front of me gasps, and the whispers behind me stop as the class goes completely silent.



“Exactly!” Mr. Obeses says, as if it was the question he’d been waiting for since class started. “He could end it all if he wanted, but why doesn’t he?” He pauses and looks around the room, then turns his palms up and shrugs. “Why doesn’t God get rid of all suffering? Why doesn’t he make it so that we’re all happy all the time?”



A kid in the back of class raises his hand. “Because God gave us all free will. We have the ability to do bad things, but it’s up to us to choose not to. That’s how we prove that we’re good.”



“But what about earthquakes, hurricanes, or tornadoes?” Mr. Obeses asks. “Those cause suffering too, don’t they? Can you explain that?”



“People have to suffer to grow,” a girl to my right says. “And we need to grow in order to be ready for heaven.”



“But why so much suffering then?” Mr. Obeses continues. “Why do some people suffer more than others? Why isn’t it all equal?”



The class is silent for a long time as we all process these ideas. Sure, it’s not anything that most of us haven’t heard or thought of before, but to hear it come from a wise Christian teacher like Mr. Obeses was shocking. Normally teachers and pastors have all the answers. They never ask us questions or open up conversations to anything that might seem questioning of God.



Eventually, I speak up. “Maybe God isn’t perfect,” I say. 



There are gasps, murmurs of dissent, and one kid even lets out a shocked, “WHAT?!”



I continue. “Maybe God is growing along with us. Maybe he doesn’t know what to do any more than we do. Maybe… maybe the world is like a ship and God is the captain… he can steer us in the right direction, but… maybe he can’t control the waves?”  
  


People are laughing about how stupid I sound, but I look up at Mr. Obeses for approval, and see that he is nodding slowly. The bell rings and he finishes his thoughts as we all start heading for the door. “The only thing we know is that God is perfect in his wisdom and goodness. As long as we follow him, the rest will work out. Have a good day everyone.”



*What if he’s wrong?* I think as I walk out of the classroom. *What if God is just doing his best? What if he built something that he can’t control, and now he doesn’t know what to do?*



When I load up the game tonight, I look at the house where the dad killed himself. The houses all around his look normal. Lights are on, families are eating dinner. I go to the family's house and see that they too are eating. I fully expect to see that the dad is back, alive and well, as if the game resets itself every time I log off, but that isn’t the case. Not entirely.



The mom and her son turn to look at me as I enter the room. They are sitting across from each other and eating meatloaf that looks more or less normal. White jagged lines of smiles stretch almost from ear to ear as if it were cut into their faces. They don’t stop smiling even as they turn and lift food into their mouths.



What’s even more disturbing is that the dad is sitting where he always has. Only, he didn’t turn when I entered the room. He is slumped to one side, a hole in his head allowing me to see all the way through him between pieces of bone and pink and red muscle. His skin is peeled back in some places, revealing worms that are furiously burrowing into him. So quick and furious that red, pink, and grey specks are falling to the ground around his chair like debris from a rock.



Yet, the son and his mom continue to talk and eat, sometimes looking at the dad and laughing as if he said something funny. Eventually they throw their heads back and start laughing so hard that tiny blue tears stream down their faces and fall to the floor. I watch this for about half a minute before I hit the fast forward button.. They laugh for fifteen minutes straight before they each get up and kiss the dad on his cheek.



The boy goes outside and the mom starts cleaning up.



I exit the house and watch over the neighborhood as the boys play soccer. They’re having more fun than ever. They run faster, laugh louder. It seems like they’re trying harder than ever to win, yet even when the opponents score or make a nice block, the kids only high-five and hug.



I’m starting to think that the family situation is something that I should just forget about. A bug in the game or a weird way of coping with death. I’ve done right by this world.



But then the goalie makes a sliding play to stop a goal, but underestimates his speed and goes face first into the goalpost. His face is repelled backward so hard that it’s almost flat against his back. For a second his eyes are closed and everything is still. I’m afraid that he might be dead. *Brain damage? Broken neck?*



But when he shakes his head fiercely I sigh in relief. I’m about to shut down my computer when I see that he is now laughing. He turns to look at me with a wide smile on his face. Then, he turns back to the goalpost and starts slamming his head against it over and over. Blood is flying everywhere but the laughter doesn’t stop. Other boys surround him and start to join in until tears and blood fill the air like a soft, silent rain.



I’m crying and I can’t stop. I don’t know what to do. How can I save these people? I watch as they all laugh and try desperately to hurt themselves. Parents watching from windows run outside to the goalposts like little children hustling to an ice cream truck.When there is no more space on either goalpost they move to the sidewalks and slam their heads against the concrete. Their eyes bounce from side to side in their heads. Teeth fly from their mouths, but each second their smiles become wider and wider. 



I click onto the thought bar, but I realize that I don’t know what to say. How can I possibly say the right thing?



Is this how God feels? Does he try desperately to steer us, but all the while we’re surrounded by waves from a wild storm? 



Does God sit in front of a screen and watch as we kill each other and ourselves? Has he tried to stop car accidents, only to realize that the alternative is worse? Has he told us to be happy, only to realize that we find happiness in our own demise?



Our world is at least better than the one I’ve created here. What would our God do? I glance back at the screen and see that the violence hasn’t stopped. More people are joining. I don’t know where they’re coming from. Everyone is so happy, I’ve never seen so many people so fucking happy.



I’m sobbing and my mom is knocking on my door. “Gregory!” She yells. “Gregory what’s wrong?!”



*Go back to normal,* I write. *And everything will be okay.* I put my head in my hands and try to quiet my sobs.



“I was laughing!” I yell as I hit enter.



All of these dozens of people, they snap their heads to look at me, and then they’re all helping each other back to their feet and to their houses. Within a minute the street is clear.



My ears are so full of air that I don’t realize that my mom has entered the room until she puts a hand on my shoulder. I flinch backward so hard that my head connects with her chin and makes a loud *pop.*



As she’s looking down and holding her chin, I shut my PC off.



“What have you been doing?” She asks, her eyes narrow.



“I was watching a movie,” I say. “It got sad.”



“You realize how suspicious it is when you turn something off right when I enter the room, right? It makes me wonder what kind of movie you were watching.”



“I was just getting ready to go to bed.”



“Uh-huh. Well just remember, God’s always watching.”



I lay in bed for hours, but all I can think about is the people in my game. My mom’s words echo in my ears. *God is always watching.* She said it as if to imply she thought I was watching porn or something, but the reality is that if God exists, he should always be watching. He can see if you do bad things, but he can also see if bad things are going to happen to you. God isn’t supposed to abandon you. And how hurt are you when you feel like he does?



It’s 3:00 am when I get up from bed and turn my computer back on. I load up the game and check on my neighborhood. It’s night time. All traces of the violence from the day before are gone. I walk into the family’s house and see that they’re safe and sound, asleep. The dad is nowhere to be found. I guess they finally buried him.



I’m grateful that he’s finally been put to rest. I say a silent apology to his empty spot in the bed and head back outside.



I fast forward through the day and everything seems great. Kids go to school, parents go to work, and at the end of the day they all come home. They eat dinner together, they do homework, and they play games outside.



Once I’m sure that the neighborhood is back to normal, I go back to watching over the city. People move happily through downtown. They stop at candy shops, they buy clothes in the mall. At one point I even see a heart signifying that two people on a coffee date have fallen in love.



There are a few car accidents and a fight in a bar, but I’m starting to realize that these are small costs for the happiness that comes with free will. I’m pretty content. I feel like it might be time to let the game go. I’ve done all I can, and making any more changes just risks causing more issues. 



I’m scrolling over one town when I see a small red building roughly resembling a barn. I scroll completely past it before I realize that there is something different about the building. I go back and see that on the wall above the front door is an object resembling a cross, only, at each end there’s a twisted hook, a sharp point jutting out as if to catch prey by the flesh of a cheek. As I venture around the building I see that each side has this same symbol. 



The thought never crossed my mind until now, but it makes sense that some sort of religion would come eventually. They parallel us in every way, don’t they? They play sports, they have houses, they drive cars, they go to work.



They need something to believe in too, don’t they? 



There’s a burning numbness in my chest. It’s something between shame, anger, and fear. If they’re worshipping something, whether they know it or not, it has to be me. And how dare they worship me? And why do I deserve to be worshipped? I didn’t know that any of this was going to happen; I didn’t want any of this to happen. 



I didn’t know that this world was going to be so real. And it is so real. These people have families and feelings and emotions, they experience pain and happiness and love, and they *do* exist when I’m not watching. So who’s to say they’re any less real than us? And how could I, accepting that they’re real, not do my best to help them? How could I sit back and watch them die and not do anything? Whether I like it or not, I have become their God.



I’m crying and holding my head in my hands. I want to turn off my computer and never turn it back on again. I want to delete the game, but then, how would I feel if God abandoned me? And how can I leave without knowing the truth of this world? What is happening in that church?



I click to walk inside. To my left and right there is a group of five people each. They are all holding hands and nodding as they stare at a man who is waving his arms erratically. His mouth opens and closes at a constant pace, as if he is only letting out short bursts of syllables.



I want so badly to hear what he’s saying. Is it something about me? Do they know who I am?



Suddenly I’m having trouble catching my breath. I look over my shoulder at my open closet door. I can’t shake the feeling that I’m being watched, that someone wants to hurt me, and that, maybe, I deserve it. 



Back in the game I see a man sitting in the corner scribbling notes frantically. Sweat drips down the sides of his face. He flips page after page until he fills the book, then he reaches onto the floor and grabs a new one.



I move behind him and take a look at what he’s writing. It’s English, clear as day. 



If I could physically interact with this world I would reach over his shoulder and tear the book away, or better yet, grab for the one on the ground. I could read every word and understand what’s going on. I so desperately want to understand what’s going on.



If their religion is as developed as ours but wrong, does that serve to prove that our religion isn’t real? That anything with complex thought is simply destined to look for meaning where there isn’t any?



If their religion is the same as ours, aligning with Christianity, or Islam, or some other known religion, does that serve to prove that religion as an intrinsic truth? Somehow ingrained inside of anyone capable of meta thought? 



If their religion includes *me*, if they are right, does that mean they think that I can save them? Does it mean that they’ll ask me for help that I can’t provide?



I watch the notetaker for nearly an hour. He writes at an inhuman pace but never slows down. He writes faster than I can read, but here is the gist of what I can make out.



He seems to be writing a never ending list of proofs that a higher being exists. Some of them are trivial things such as the fact that this world came to exist in the first place. He references what must be other planets that don’t have life, he talks about how incredible the world is, about their wide array of experiences and emotions. He goes on and on for pages and pages.



Then, he circles in on more specific proofs. He writes about the world changing so suddenly and vastly in short periods of time. He references personal experiences from himself and his acquaintances suddenly feeling the urge to look at a specific point in the distance, how they each felt with surging confidence that they were so close to looking in on something that was looking back, like someone was staring at them from a curtain that was translucent on only one side. 



They’re talking about my commands—about when I put thoughts in their head. Somehow, they could feel that I was watching.



Now, I feel like I’m being watched provocatively through a hole in my wall that I wasn’t aware of until just now. As I read these words, I feel the urge to cover up, like I can hide from these realizations. 



He writes about how, at certain times, the world seems to have shifts in mindsets simultaneously, as if God were pulling a switch or pushing a button. *It’s as if this God is trying to fix our world’s problems,* he writes. *But is failing miserably.* 



The last words I read before the speech ends and the book closes is*, Our only solution is to ask him to kill us all. But how do we ask? That’s the question that we must answer.*



All I wanted to do was make a video game. All I wanted to do was play a game that was *different;* one where I had an illusion of control over something bigger than myself



But no, the illusion has turned into reality. I’m not playing Sims and controlling little make believe people with no feelings and emotions. These aren’t things that stop existing when I stop watching. I’ve brought people into the world against their will. I’m torturing them, and they want it to stop but they don’t know how to make it stop. 



The only thing they know for a fact is that *I* know how to make it stop. And yet, I don’t. I wish it could be so simple as deleting the game or even destroying my computer. But then, I have no way of knowing if the world would continue to exist in my absence. They’d become a world with a God who abandoned them.



I can try to kill them all. I can code nukes into the game and blow everything up, but then… will the world really cease to exist, or would a new species be born only to undergo the same fate? This reminds me of dinosaurs and a meteor. Maybe the same mistake has been made before.



I can simply ignore the game and try to forget it ever existed, but then, how could I live knowing that bad things will continue to happen? Every loss, every death, every pain as small as a stubbed toe or as painful as watching your son die in a car crash would be all thanks to me. 



In that sense, these people are right. The noblest thing I can do is destroy this world. Every happy memory and positive outcome nulled will pale in comparison to the infinite pain and suffering I will end.



But how do I do it?



To these people, the greatest problem is only how to ask to be killed, they believe it is up to them to find a way to ask and that once they do so, their problems will be solved. It never crossed their minds that God doesn’t have the power. It hasn’t crossed their minds that they’ve done everything right. It hasn’t crossed their minds that their creator is too weak and stupid to do the right thing, no matter how much he wants to.



I look all around the world I’ve created. I see happy families. I see cemeteries and hospitals. I see kids playing soccer, and as I fast forward through the weeks I see new churches popping up almost every day.



These people are starting to realize that something bigger is watching over them, and all they want is for me to show them mercy.



But I can’t.



All I can do is delete the game, turn off my computer, and try to forget this ever happened.



But I ask you this: What if our God has turned off his computer?

“Yes?” He asks.



“Does that mean when people get cancer or die it’s because God wants them to? Could he stop all pain if he wanted to?” The girl in front of me gasps, and the whispers behind me stop as the class goes completely silent.



“Exactly!” Mr. Obeses says, as if it was the question he’d been waiting for since class started. “He could end it all if he wanted, but why doesn’t he?” He pauses and looks around the room, then turns his palms up and shrugs. “Why doesn’t God get rid of all suffering? Why doesn’t he make it so that we’re all happy all the time?”



A kid in the back of class raises his hand. “Because God gave us all free will. We have the ability to do bad things, but it’s up to us to choose not to. That’s how we prove that we’re good.”



“But what about earthquakes, hurricanes, or tornadoes?” Mr. Obeses asks. “Those cause suffering too, don’t they? Can you explain that?”



“People have to suffer to grow,” a girl to my right says. “And we need to grow in order to be ready for heaven.”



“But why so much suffering then?” Mr. Obeses continues. “Why do some people suffer more than others? Why isn’t it all equal?”



The class is silent for a long time as we all process these ideas. Sure, it’s not anything that most of us haven’t heard or thought of before, but to hear it come from a wise Christian teacher like Mr. Obeses was shocking. Normally teachers and pastors have all the answers. They never ask us questions or open up conversations to anything that might seem questioning of God.



Eventually, I speak up. “Maybe God isn’t perfect,” I say. 



There are gasps, murmurs of dissent, and one kid even lets out a shocked, “WHAT?!”



I continue. “Maybe God is growing along with us. Maybe he doesn’t know what to do any more than we do. Maybe… maybe the world is like a ship and God is the captain… he can steer us in the right direction, but… maybe he can’t control the waves?”  
  


People are laughing about how stupid I sound, but I look up at Mr. Obeses for approval, and see that he is nodding slowly. The bell rings and he finishes his thoughts as we all start heading for the door. “The only thing we know is that God is perfect in his wisdom and goodness. As long as we follow him, the rest will work out. Have a good day everyone.”



*What if he’s wrong?* I think as I walk out of the classroom. *What if God is just doing his best? What if he built something that he can’t control, and now he doesn’t know what to do?*



When I load up the game tonight, I look at the house where the dad killed himself. The houses all around his look normal. Lights are on, families are eating dinner. I go to the family's house and see that they too are eating. I fully expect to see that the dad is back, alive and well, as if the game resets itself every time I log off, but that isn’t the case. Not entirely.



The mom and her son turn to look at me as I enter the room. They are sitting across from each other and eating meatloaf that looks more or less normal. White jagged lines of smiles stretch almost from ear to ear as if it were cut into their faces. They don’t stop smiling even as they turn and lift food into their mouths.



What’s even more disturbing is that the dad is sitting where he always has. Only, he didn’t turn when I entered the room. He is slumped to one side, a hole in his head allowing me to see all the way through him between pieces of bone and pink and red muscle. His skin is peeled back in some places, revealing worms that are furiously burrowing into him. So quick and furious that red, pink, and grey specks are falling to the ground around his chair like debris from a rock.



Yet, the son and his mom continue to talk and eat, sometimes looking at the dad and laughing as if he said something funny. Eventually they throw their heads back and start laughing so hard that tiny blue tears stream down their faces and fall to the floor. I watch this for about half a minute before I hit the fast forward button.. They laugh for fifteen minutes straight before they each get up and kiss the dad on his cheek.



The boy goes outside and the mom starts cleaning up.



I exit the house and watch over the neighborhood as the boys play soccer. They’re having more fun than ever. They run faster, laugh louder. It seems like they’re trying harder than ever to win, yet even when the opponents score or make a nice block, the kids only high-five and hug.



I’m starting to think that the family situation is something that I should just forget about. A bug in the game or a weird way of coping with death. I’ve done right by this world.



But then the goalie makes a sliding play to stop a goal, but underestimates his speed and goes face first into the goalpost. His face is repelled backward so hard that it’s almost flat against his back. For a second his eyes are closed and everything is still. I’m afraid that he might be dead. *Brain damage? Broken neck?*



But when he shakes his head fiercely I sigh in relief. I’m about to shut down my computer when I see that he is now laughing. He turns to look at me with a wide smile on his face. Then, he turns back to the goalpost and starts slamming his head against it over and over. Blood is flying everywhere but the laughter doesn’t stop. Other boys surround him and start to join in until tears and blood fill the air like a soft, silent rain.



I’m crying and I can’t stop. I don’t know what to do. How can I save these people? I watch as they all laugh and try desperately to hurt themselves. Parents watching from windows run outside to the goalposts like little children hustling to an ice cream truck.When there is no more space on either goalpost they move to the sidewalks and slam their heads against the concrete. Their eyes bounce from side to side in their heads. Teeth fly from their mouths, but each second their smiles become wider and wider. 



I click onto the thought bar, but I realize that I don’t know what to say. How can I possibly say the right thing?



Is this how God feels? Does he try desperately to steer us, but all the while we’re surrounded by waves from a wild storm? 



Does God sit in front of a screen and watch as we kill each other and ourselves? Has he tried to stop car accidents, only to realize that the alternative is worse? Has he told us to be happy, only to realize that we find happiness in our own demise?



Our world is at least better than the one I’ve created here. What would our God do? I glance back at the screen and see that the violence hasn’t stopped. More people are joining. I don’t know where they’re coming from. Everyone is so happy, I’ve never seen so many people so fucking happy.



I’m sobbing and my mom is knocking on my door. “Gregory!” She yells. “Gregory what’s wrong?!”



*Go back to normal,* I write. *And everything will be okay.* I put my head in my hands and try to quiet my sobs.



“I was laughing!” I yell as I hit enter.



All of these dozens of people, they snap their heads to look at me, and then they’re all helping each other back to their feet and to their houses. Within a minute the street is clear.



My ears are so full of air that I don’t realize that my mom has entered the room until she puts a hand on my shoulder. I flinch backward so hard that my head connects with her chin and makes a loud *pop.*



As she’s looking down and holding her chin, I shut my PC off.



“What have you been doing?” She asks, her eyes narrow.



“I was watching a movie,” I say. “It got sad.”



“You realize how suspicious it is when you turn something off right when I enter the room, right? It makes me wonder what kind of movie you were watching.”



“I was just getting ready to go to bed.”



“Uh-huh. Well just remember, God’s always watching.”



I lay in bed for hours, but all I can think about is the people in my game. My mom’s words echo in my ears. *God is always watching.* She said it as if to imply she thought I was watching porn or something, but the reality is that if God exists, he should always be watching. He can see if you do bad things, but he can also see if bad things are going to happen to you. God isn’t supposed to abandon you. And how hurt are you when you feel like he does?



It’s 3:00 am when I get up from bed and turn my computer back on. I load up the game and check on my neighborhood. It’s night time. All traces of the violence from the day before are gone. I walk into the family’s house and see that they’re safe and sound, asleep. The dad is nowhere to be found. I guess they finally buried him.



I’m grateful that he’s finally been put to rest. I say a silent apology to his empty spot in the bed and head back outside.



I fast forward through the day and everything seems great. Kids go to school, parents go to work, and at the end of the day they all come home. They eat dinner together, they do homework, and they play games outside.



Once I’m sure that the neighborhood is back to normal, I go back to watching over the city. People move happily through downtown. They stop at candy shops, they buy clothes in the mall. At one point I even see a heart signifying that two people on a coffee date have fallen in love.



There are a few car accidents and a fight in a bar, but I’m starting to realize that these are small costs for the happiness that comes with free will. I’m pretty content. I feel like it might be time to let the game go. I’ve done all I can, and making any more changes just risks causing more issues. 



I’m scrolling over one town when I see a small red building roughly resembling a barn. I scroll completely past it before I realize that there is something different about the building. I go back and see that on the wall above the front door is an object resembling a cross, only, at each end there’s a twisted hook, a sharp point jutting out as if to catch prey by the flesh of a cheek. As I venture around the building I see that each side has this same symbol. 



The thought never crossed my mind until now, but it makes sense that some sort of religion would come eventually. They parallel us in every way, don’t they? They play sports, they have houses, they drive cars, they go to work.



They need something to believe in too, don’t they? 



There’s a burning numbness in my chest. It’s something between shame, anger, and fear. If they’re worshipping something, whether they know it or not, it has to be me. And how dare they worship me? And why do I deserve to be worshipped? I didn’t know that any of this was going to happen; I didn’t want any of this to happen. 



I didn’t know that this world was going to be so real. And it is so real. These people have families and feelings and emotions, they experience pain and happiness and love, and they *do* exist when I’m not watching. So who’s to say they’re any less real than us? And how could I, accepting that they’re real, not do my best to help them? How could I sit back and watch them die and not do anything? Whether I like it or not, I have become their God.



I’m crying and holding my head in my hands. I want to turn off my computer and never turn it back on again. I want to delete the game, but then, how would I feel if God abandoned me? And how can I leave without knowing the truth of this world? What is happening in that church?



I click to walk inside. To my left and right there is a group of five people each. They are all holding hands and nodding as they stare at a man who is waving his arms erratically. His mouth opens and closes at a constant pace, as if he is only letting out short bursts of syllables.



I want so badly to hear what he’s saying. Is it something about me? Do they know who I am?



Suddenly I’m having trouble catching my breath. I look over my shoulder at my open closet door. I can’t shake the feeling that I’m being watched, that someone wants to hurt me, and that, maybe, I deserve it. 



Back in the game I see a man sitting in the corner scribbling notes frantically. Sweat drips down the sides of his face. He flips page after page until he fills the book, then he reaches onto the floor and grabs a new one.



I move behind him and take a look at what he’s writing. It’s English, clear as day. 



If I could physically interact with this world I would reach over his shoulder and tear the book away, or better yet, grab for the one on the ground. I could read every word and understand what’s going on. I so desperately want to understand what’s going on.



If their religion is as developed as ours but wrong, does that serve to prove that our religion isn’t real? That anything with complex thought is simply destined to look for meaning where there isn’t any?



If their religion is the same as ours, aligning with Christianity, or Islam, or some other known religion, does that serve to prove that religion as an intrinsic truth? Somehow ingrained inside of anyone capable of meta thought? 



If their religion includes *me*, if they are right, does that mean they think that I can save them? Does it mean that they’ll ask me for help that I can’t provide?



I watch the notetaker for nearly an hour. He writes at an inhuman pace but never slows down. He writes faster than I can read, but here is the gist of what I can make out.



He seems to be writing a never ending list of proofs that a higher being exists. Some of them are trivial things such as the fact that this world came to exist in the first place. He references what must be other planets that don’t have life, he talks about how incredible the world is, about their wide array of experiences and emotions. He goes on and on for pages and pages.



Then, he circles in on more specific proofs. He writes about the world changing so suddenly and vastly in short periods of time. He references personal experiences from himself and his acquaintances suddenly feeling the urge to look at a specific point in the distance, how they each felt with surging confidence that they were so close to looking in on something that was looking back, like someone was staring at them from a curtain that was translucent on only one side. 



They’re talking about my commands—about when I put thoughts in their head. Somehow, they could feel that I was watching.



Now, I feel like I’m being watched provocatively through a hole in my wall that I wasn’t aware of until just now. As I read these words, I feel the urge to cover up, like I can hide from these realizations. 



He writes about how, at certain times, the world seems to have shifts in mindsets simultaneously, as if God were pulling a switch or pushing a button. *It’s as if this God is trying to fix our world’s problems,* he writes. *But is failing miserably.* 



The last words I read before the speech ends and the book closes is*, Our only solution is to ask him to kill us all. But how do we ask? That’s the question that we must answer.*



All I wanted to do was make a video game. All I wanted to do was play a game that was *different;* one where I had an illusion of control over something bigger than myself



But no, the illusion has turned into reality. I’m not playing Sims and controlling little make believe people with no feelings and emotions. These aren’t things that stop existing when I stop watching. I’ve brought people into the world against their will. I’m torturing them, and they want it to stop but they don’t know how to make it stop. 



The only thing they know for a fact is that *I* know how to make it stop. And yet, I don’t. I wish it could be so simple as deleting the game or even destroying my computer. But then, I have no way of knowing if the world would continue to exist in my absence. They’d become a world with a God who abandoned them.



I can try to kill them all. I can code nukes into the game and blow everything up, but then… will the world really cease to exist, or would a new species be born only to undergo the same fate? This reminds me of dinosaurs and a meteor. Maybe the same mistake has been made before.



I can simply ignore the game and try to forget it ever existed, but then, how could I live knowing that bad things will continue to happen? Every loss, every death, every pain as small as a stubbed toe or as painful as watching your son die in a car crash would be all thanks to me. 



In that sense, these people are right. The noblest thing I can do is destroy this world. Every happy memory and positive outcome nulled will pale in comparison to the infinite pain and suffering I will end.



But how do I do it?



To these people, the greatest problem is only how to ask to be killed, they believe it is up to them to find a way to ask and that once they do so, their problems will be solved. It never crossed their minds that God doesn’t have the power. It hasn’t crossed their minds that they’ve done everything right. It hasn’t crossed their minds that their creator is too weak and stupid to do the right thing, no matter how much he wants to.



I look all around the world I’ve created. I see happy families. I see cemeteries and hospitals. I see kids playing soccer, and as I fast forward through the weeks I see new churches popping up almost every day.



These people are starting to realize that something bigger is watching over them, and all they want is for me to show them mercy.



But I can’t.



All I can do is delete the game, turn off my computer, and try to forget this ever happened.



But I ask you this: What if our God has turned off his computer?

1lwvm7j,https://www.reddit.com/r/story/comments/1lwvm7j/my_boss_said_i_was_too_quiet_at_work_so_i/,"My boss said I was “too quiet” at work, so I accidentally started an office cult.","Not on purpose. I swear.

This all started because I’m an introvert. Like Olympic-level. I’m not shy, I just have a very limited social battery and I prefer to use it for things like petting my cat or ordering food without crying.

Anyway, I work at a mid-sized tech company. Good people, decent pay, free coffee that tastes like burnt hopes. At my 1-year review, my boss tells me, “You’re doing great work, but you’re a bit…quiet. You should try to engage more with the team.”

Cool. Fine. I can do that.

So the next Monday, I show up early with a plan: I bring donuts. Easy conversation starter, right?

Wrong.

Apparently, bringing donuts made me a **hero**. I didn’t know we were a snack-deprived office, but the reaction was like I’d delivered gold-plated crullers from the heavens.

People start stopping by my desk like I’m the snack shaman. “What’s the occasion?” “Are you celebrating something?” “This is so thoughtful!” I panic and blurt, “Just wanted to start the week with good vibes.”

Big mistake. HUGE.

Because now, every Monday, people expect “vibes.”

The next week, I bring muffins. Someone makes a joke: “Our silent leader brings gifts again.” I laugh awkwardly. I don’t know I’ve just started a **ritual**.

Week three: I forget to bring anything. By 9:03 AM, three people stop by looking disappointed. One guy (I think his name is Greg?) actually says, “No vibes today?” WITH SAD EYES.

So now I’m committed. I start rotating pastries. One week I bring match a cookies and get called “mysterious and generous.” Someone starts a group chat called “Monday Vibes.” I am added without my consent.

Then things get… weird.

One of the interns prints out a picture of me and puts it on the office fridge with the caption “Our Vibe bringer.” Someone else starts bowing whenever I pass by. I think they’re joking… until they’re not.

People start *leaving me offerings*. A stress ball. A soy candle. A handwritten haiku. Someone made a tiny shrine with a Post-It that said “May the vibes be ever in your flavor.”

At this point I’m like, “Guys. I am not your pastry prophet.” But it’s too late. I’ve accidentally created a snack-based following.

Finally, HR calls me in.

Apparently someone complained that “the Monday Vibes club excludes people with gluten intolerance.” I explain that I am just a quiet person who brought donuts one time and now I’m somehow a figurehead of an underground workplace movement. HR laughs. I cry a little inside.

Now, the Monday Vibes still happen. But we rotate the responsibility. There’s a spreadsheet. People sign up. Someone brought fruit last week and it almost caused a mutiny, but we’re managing.

As for me?

I still sit quietly at my desk. But now people nod at me like I’m some kind of ancient seer who once bestowed carbs upon the masses.

So yeah. Moral of the story?

If you’re quiet at work, beware. One kind gesture and you might end up the accidental founder of a pastry-based cult.

Also, never underestimate the power of donuts. They will change lives.",13,1752201578.0,story,3,1.0,False

For context, we’ve been dating for almost a year. I recently moved into a new apartment and have been furnishing it all on my own—bought the couch, TV, everything. My boyfriend surprised me by buying a coffee table, which I genuinely appreciated. Today I realized I needed a shower filter because I’ve started breaking out (the water here is really harsh), so I asked if I could use his Amazon Prime to order one for faster shipping. Instead, he said “ Send me the one u want” I was actually touched—until five minutes later he told me it was $98, and when I asked “Should I Apple Pay you?” he said “Haha, yes.” I know it sounds small, but it crushed me because just today I was making plans and putting together stuff for his 30th birthday coming up in a couple of months. A trip abroad .I’ve done so much in this relationship—from taking him on dates to make me feel appreciated and loved, to planning a $4,000 birthday trip for him, to literally choosing an apartment with him in mind.  yet here I am, always giving. And now, over $98, I’ve never felt the ick before but this one hit me hard. I almost cried . I’m kind of sick to my stomach. The dynamic feels so uneven. 

I never keep tabs of what I do for him etc but he does. He’s the kind of person to not offer help financially without specifically being asked . And I’m the type who thinks “ oh this person I care about needs help I’ll help them as much as I can “. And even when asked he’ll say he wasn’t raised that way. For example I was car shopping for a few month and has been getting month rentals and I got sick of it and wanted to find a car and stop burning through money. I was stressed he suggested I get another rental and I said it was expensive. And he didn’t offer to help with even half of the cost.  This is also a man who I’ve told multiple I like flowers . And I even asked why he doesn’t buy me some . His response at first was “I’ll buy them” then the last time I asked it was “is it because TikTok told you to?” And still hasn’t bought any. 

I’ve never been someone to keep tabs. When I take him out, I do it because I genuinely want him to feel appreciated. And today was so excited ,when I started planning the surprise international trip for his 30th birthday. Like literally checking flights and Airbnbs. I wasn’t even thinking about the cost because I just wanted to make it special.
. I know it sounds small, but this hit deep. It made me realize how one-sided things really are.  
I would like your thoughts? Is communication the key ? Or do people like this not change. And it doesn’t help that he was raised in a “feminist” household . But things weren’t split 50/50 between his mom and dad. And he likes to bring it up and say where he’s from everyone holds their own and then they just come together to have a good time . And I’m like where I’m from if someone needs a hand we offer a hand .
TL;DR:
Boyfriend offered to buy me a shower filter, asked me to pick one and the color, ordered it, then told me it was $98 and confirmed he wanted me to pay him back—after making it seem like a gift. Meanwhile, I’ve been planning a whole international trip for his 30th and regularly pay for things just to make him feel appreciated. The whole thing gave me the worst ick and I can’t un-ick",0,1752201529.0,AskWomenNoCensor,29,0.33,False
