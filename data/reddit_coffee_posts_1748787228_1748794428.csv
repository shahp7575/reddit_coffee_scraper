INT. JOHN MELENDEZ'S APARTMENT ‚Äì NIGHT

John sits at his cluttered desk, staring at a website called ‚ÄúWishDotGov.‚Äù A glowing ad flashes:

‚ÄúTURN ANYONE INTO A LIBERAL ‚Äì $19.99 OR 4 PAYMENTS OF $9.99‚Äù
(Liberal Conversion Ray 3000 ‚Äì Now 63% accurate!)
JOHN:
(grinning)
That‚Äôs it! I don‚Äôt need brains. I need lasers.

He slams his credit card down with a dramatic orchestral sting‚Ä¶ that gets interrupted by ‚ÄúTransaction Declined.‚Äù

JOHN:
(screaming at the laptop)
IT'S A DEEP STATE CONSPIRACY!!

MONTAGE ‚Äì ‚ÄúBUILDING THE LIB-RAY‚Äù

Cue Looney Tunes-style music:

John spray-paints a hairdryer silver and tapes a ‚ÄúLiberalizer 3000‚Äù label on it.
Wires go everywhere. A Bernie Sanders bobblehead is glued to the top for ‚Äúalignment.‚Äù
He duct-tapes an NPR bumper sticker to the trigger.
For ammo: a mix of kombucha, weed vape, and a thumb drive labeled ‚ÄúRachel Maddow Highlights.‚Äù
EXT. COMPOUND MEDIA PARKING LOT ‚Äì NIGHT

John hides behind a recycling bin, holding the makeshift ray gun. He wears a fake mustache and a ""Press"" hat.

JOHN:
Time to make history... or at least a meme.

Anthony Cumia walks to his car, mid-phone call.

ANTHONY:
...yeah, I told Gavin that mug looked like Antifa merch‚Äî

JOHN (jumping out):
SURPRISE! IT‚ÄôS LIBERALING TIME!

John pulls the trigger. The ray gun sparks. Glows. Then‚Ä¶

BOOM!

A bright pink explosion launches John backward into a pile of discarded Newsmax DVDs. His eyebrows are singed off. The Bernie bobblehead lands in his mouth.

ANTHONY (unfazed):
Was that guy from MSNBC?

INT. JOHN'S APARTMENT ‚Äì LATER

John sits in the dark, covered in glitter, his skin still faintly glowing. Patrick Michael appears on Zoom.

PATRICK:
So... is Cumia woke now?

JOHN:
No. But I accidentally voted in a local election.

PATRICK:
You monster...

Legion of Dabble 5: Patty's Progressive Prank""

INT. PATRICK MICHAEL‚ÄôS BASEMENT ‚Äì NIGHT

Patrick is podcasting live into what appears to be a Pringles can with a USB cable duct-taped to it.

PATRICK:
Alright, loyal listeners ‚Äî all two of you ‚Äî it‚Äôs MY time now. Stuttering John blew it with the laser. Typical. I‚Äôve got a real plan. DIY-style. Budget woke.

He holds up a hand-drawn schematic titled:

‚ÄúCumia Conversion Contraption: Patent Pending‚Äù
(Slogan: ‚ÄúFrom Based to Blazed.‚Äù)
MONTAGE ‚Äì ‚ÄúBUILDING PATTY‚ÄôS MASTERPIECE‚Äù

Bouncy Looney Tunes music plays as Patrick builds his trap using pure dollar-store chaos:

A kiddie slide repainted with ‚ÄúWOKE ZONE ‚Äì ENTER IF YOU CARE ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT‚Äù
A booby-trapped podcast booth that auto-plays NPR, Beyonc√© speeches, and AOC TikToks
A giant funnel filled with soy milk and tofu glitter labeled: ‚ÄúTRUTH JUICE‚Äù
A sock puppet that yells, ‚ÄúYOU‚ÄôRE PROBLEMATIC!‚Äù every 5 seconds
PATRICK (straining as he glues everything together):
This is gonna change everything. This is how I finally... trend.

EXT. COMPOUND MEDIA PARKING LOT ‚Äì DAY

Patrick hides behind a plastic bush. He‚Äôs disguised as a Vice intern (beanie, nose ring drawn on with Sharpie).

PATRICK:
Operation ‚ÄúBro No More‚Äù is a go.

Anthony Cumia strolls out with a coffee, mid-conversation.

ANTHONY:
Yeah, and I told Chrissie, ""If CNN calls me again‚Äî""

A trap door opens. Cumia barely misses it by stepping over to light a cigarette.

Patrick gasps as a squirrel falls into the trap instead. A voice yells ‚ÄúDECOLONIZE!‚Äù and the tofu funnel explodes.

INT. TRAP ‚Äì CHAOS ENSUES

Inside the trap: soy milk floods the walls. NPR music blasts. The sock puppet goes berserk. A can of La Croix shoots out like a bullet.

But it‚Äôs only the squirrel inside, now wearing horn-rimmed glasses and a scarf.

EXT. PARKING LOT ‚Äì CONTINUOUS

ANTHONY (watching):
Why is there a liberal squirrel screaming about microaggressions?

Patrick‚Äôs head pops out of the bush, covered in tofu and glitter.

PATRICK:
I was so close‚Ä¶

ANTHONY:
(sips coffee)
You people are mentally ill.

INT. PATRICK‚ÄôS BASEMENT ‚Äì NIGHT

Patrick is podcasting again, now covered in bandages and holding an emotional support kombucha.

PATRICK:

Also how much did you spend on your setup? Because we already have a small setup in thinking it may be cheaper with wiring already being ran. Just from trying to learn lithium seems the best way to go for batteries, but cost a lot more, and 1000+ watt of solar to run the fridge, coffee maker, laptop, AC, microwave, starlink, and a TV.

Miserable. Perhaps they prefer youths and smack heads smashing glass on the bandstand. Probably emboldened by the brockwell park stuff going on.

""Hell Yeah!"" So, we're a part of a five member friend group. So we prepared a script about a man and his wife and two kids. The man got fired from work because he got accused of robbing his boss. His wife was being tormented publicly and their neighbours were very mean to her insulting her husband and using profanity in front the kids calling their dad a woman and money chaser. The man didn't care as much as the wife and since it's an Indian community, the wife was being held captive for her husband's crimes. She decided to self harm and she passes away. The younger one going insane and the man just loss of love and in denial and the older one trying to keep it together.  The man wrote about his feelings like how he missed her apple scent, and the cup of coffee every morning and her beautiful voice that soothed him whenever she sang. He was devasted and wrote everything in his diary with a bunch of photographs, his last words in the diary being, ""I'll always wait for you my dear. Always and forever."" And we (me and bsf) found the diary on a desk in an old seventies indian household when we were exploring our town. 

We told this to our friends over lunch in the cafeteria and they actually believed it and started crying üò≠. It was weird but we were proud. The topic ended and next day I got a call from one of them saying she needed the address of the place and she told her mom the story. I didn't know what to say and told it doesn't have an address it was an abandoned place I don't think you'll find it. She said okay and hung up. I called my bsf immediately and told her that and she added her(the girl) to the call and she revealed that she did some ritual that chatgpt suggested her with candles and an ouija board and named the spirit ""Vaidehi"" the wife's name! We were like wtf? And she's like I wanted to give the spirit peace. We were bamboozled! Apparently that story affected her mental health a lot since she just went through a break up. 

Ever since then she told she was fine but she acted weird. She had insane mood swings, cut herself off in sentences and had weird shivers out of no where when we were speaking about random shit. 

Me and bsf always believed some spirit got attached to her. Today she's in a mental hospital and we never told her that story was fake. ",3,1748793671.0,confessions,0,0.8,False

Done everything possible and still have them.,"To start off, I just want to establish that I am an incredibly clean/hygienic person and am quite a stickler about maintaining my home.  I do not leave any food/dirty dishes out whatsoever and on the rare occasion a spill happens I thoroughly clean the area.  All my non-refrigerated food items (except for sealed coffee) are kept together in a single pantry closet, and none of the flies are in/around that area.  The largest concentration of fruit flies are in the bathroom and kitchen.  I do not bring any fruit/vegetables in that isn‚Äôt immediately eaten.

I have had a god-awful fruit fly problem for several months.  I have quite literally done everything in my power to fix the issue, including pre-made liquid traps, blue light traps, and homemade traps, all which have been very effective and actually controlled the problem for several weeks.  I even bought silicone sink covers and keep the sinks/bathtub drain covered 24-7 unless I‚Äôm actively using it.  But my problem resurfaced/exacerbated seemingly overnight this past week, with the largest concentration of them in the bathroom sink and kitchen around the sink/fridge.  I am absolutely certain there is no food drawing them in, and I even checked the dishwasher which is completely devoid of them.  Hell, despite keeping the drains covered, I‚Äôve even been using Green Gobbler treatment in them too even though they are completely sealed.

Where the fuck are these bastards possibly coming from?? Are they coming through the vents from other apartments?  I never open my windows and don‚Äôt leave the door open or anything.  If they are coming from the vents what the heck can I do?  I am literally at my wit‚Äôs end and it feels so disgusting having these in here.  Not only that, but they are extremely annoying and genuinely interfere with my quality of life.  Have any of you ever been in this situation and what have you done?

Just want to add that I DO have potted plants in the living room but that the fruit flies are not in this area.  I am also certain that they are fruit flies and not fungus gnats; they have small tan bodies and red eyes.",0,1748793564.0,Apartmentliving,4,0.5,False

A Dabbleverse Production ‚Äì Episode 1
Title: ‚ÄúTwo Mics, No Clue‚Äù

CAST
The Dabbler (John Melendez) ‚Äì Angry, defensive, always blaming trolls.
Patty C Cups (Patrick Michael) ‚Äì Confident but clueless, speaks in circles.
Karl (from WATP) ‚Äì Offscreen antagonist, a polished podcaster mocking from afar.
INT. JOHN‚ÄôS APARTMENT ‚Äì DAY
Beer cans, half-eaten burrito bowls, and technical manuals are strewn everywhere. JOHN stares at a dusty microphone. He looks defeated‚Ä¶ until his ancient laptop DINGS with a Discord call request: ‚ÄúPattyC69 wants to call.‚Äù

JOHN
(grumbling)
Ugh‚Ä¶ another troll?

He clicks.

INT. SPLIT SCREEN ‚Äì PATRICK‚ÄôS SHED STUDIO ‚Äì DAY
PATRICK MICHAEL appears, surrounded by stacks of failed podcast merch. He‚Äôs wearing sunglasses indoors.

PATRICK
Yo yo yo, it‚Äôs ya boy ‚Äî creator of over 87 podcasts and counting. Heard you got Karl problems.

JOHN
That smug hack‚Äôs been clipping me again. I‚Äôm tired of being his content.

PATRICK
That‚Äôs what he does, man. You sneeze, he reviews it like it‚Äôs Citizen Kane.

JOHN
You‚Äôre no saint yourself. Didn‚Äôt you call one of your own shows ‚ÄúBetter Than WATP‚Äù?

PATRICK
It was ironic... or conceptual. I don‚Äôt remember.

JOHN
(leaning in)
What if... we started our own podcast? Together. A show so unlistenable, so chaotic, Karl wouldn‚Äôt dare touch it.

PATRICK
Like a sonic Molotov cocktail. I‚Äôm in.

MONTAGE ‚Äì ‚ÄúBUILDING THE PODCAST‚Äù
‚Äì JOHN arguing with his webcam settings.
‚Äì PATRICK trying to design a logo in MS Paint.
‚Äì A failed attempt to upload to Spotify (‚ÄúAccount Suspended‚Äù).

‚Äì Ending up with: ‚ÄúJohn and Patrick‚Äù.

INT. LIVESTREAM ‚Äì NIGHT
They go live. No script. No plan. Just energy.

JOHN
Karl‚Äôs a coward! He hides behind a soundboard and a smirk!

PATRICK
He can‚Äôt roast us if we roast ourselves first. That‚Äôs podcasting judo.

JOHN
We‚Äôre uncancellable ‚Äòcause we‚Äôre already canceled!

PATRICK
(to camera)
And if you're listening, Karl ‚Äî this one's for you. We‚Äôre the Legion of... whatever this is.

INT. KARL‚ÄôS STUDIO ‚Äì SIMULTANEOUS
KARL sips coffee, watching the stream.

KARL
(chuckling)
This is content gold. Episode one of ‚ÄúJohn and Patrick‚Äù... welcome to WATP next week.

INT. JOHN‚ÄôS APARTMENT ‚Äì AFTER THE STREAM
They sit in silence. Zero views. Zero subs.

JOHN
We crushed it.

PATRICK
Yeah... just wait until episode 47. That‚Äôs when it always clicks.

JOHN
You‚Äôve done this before?

PATRICK
Only 86 times.

They clink beer cans.

Classic UK weather today, so I'm armed with coffee and thought I'd put another post out there. Had some really good chats and made some great new friends this past week, which has been ace. Always happy to meet more interesting people though!

I'm 36, from the UK, and generally around to chat. Would love to find a few more people for those everyday chats, sharing hobbies, and just building some proper, down-to-earth friendships. A bit of understanding and a good laugh go a long way.

Quick rundown of my interests:

*   **Writing:** Love getting ideas down, reflecting, all that good stuff.
*   **Art (Drawing & Painting!):** Fun to create, and always cool to see what others are making.
*   **Reading:** Nothing like a good book to escape into.
*   **Traveling:** Seeing new places and experiencing different cultures is a big one for me.
*   **Gym:** Good for the body, good for the head.
*   **Video Games:** Enjoy the social side, the stories, and just zoning out.
*   **Learning Languages:** French and Japanese are my current challenges ‚Äì it‚Äôs pretty fascinating.
*   **Coffee & Tea:** Can‚Äôt function without ‚Äòem, basically. The quiet joy of a good brew.

If you're into genuine chats, can appreciate a bit of empathy, and like sharing the good, bad, and the mundane, I reckon we might get on. I try my best to be a good listener and a supportive friend.

So much contempt, which shows exactly why her marriage isn‚Äôt working. Also, it‚Äôs everyone‚Äôs fault for trying to find friendship within these girls because no one‚Äòs actually friends. 

Jen house and does lie or like doesn‚Äôt tell the full truth and then things come out and she has no accountability so it makes her look more guilty than she is even though it‚Äôs probably a product of Zac isolating her and gaslighting her, and she definitely repeats everything that he says. She did well when she wasn‚Äôt without him, but then when she went back to him, things got significantly worse.

Unfortunately the goodie bags were already gone; the ink muddler I saw on a picture seems ideal to me, so I'll order that online sometime.



I hesitated a lot about which pen I wanted, eventually chose the Gravitas Flagship Pine with M-nib.



A linen bag was a must, because I love linen bags and always carry them with me.

Two Galen Leather pencil cases (one for one Kaweco Sport, the other for two Kaweco Sports, but the smallest one also fits two Tom's Studio Mini Lumos) and a tiny pen rest. And of course two bottles of ink (Sailor Waka Uguisu and Esterbrook Forgotten Iced Coffee).

Found some nice stickers too.

1l0s3xn,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l0s3xn,Small living room,"Hi all!
After my previous post i made some changes to my small living room with the help of you guys. It already feels nicer now but I am not sure about a few things still.

The first 3 pics (1st pic wide angle and gives a bit of distorted view of size), so are the new settings, after that the old ones. I removed the heavy coffee table, the big chair and the dinner/office table and replaced it with a small dinner table at the window and a separate small office desk for work and music. The rug is changes for a smaller one and removed some cat stuff. Also removed one layer of the cabinet next to the balcony door. 

The most obvious one is the cat tree in the middle, that one should be smaller i think, or I need to change something so it can be moved to a wall. 
Although I like the location of the tv much better now, I feel like I cannot really play xbox very comfortable due to the distance. Should i get a wall mount for the tv or change the setup for this? Also, i still don‚Äôt have any part empty wall anywhere, maybe even less then before for some reason. Is that bad for a spacious feeling/feng shui?

\- Books, fantasy more specifically, and longer series for example GoT and wheel of time, and so on. 

\- My lovely plants, it is a bad habbit i have, i just happen to buy more plants too often and now i am stuck taking care of them. 

\- As is in my Finnish blood i love coffee, and if you want me talking wait til i have a cup in my hands. 

\- Camping, grilling out in the forrest and all that entails

\- I do play some games, both boardgames and PC, it comes and it goes. I do it for fun and i would not call me a big gamer

There is probably more but i can't spill all the tea already. If you got this far, congrats and sorry. If you think i sound interesting, hit me a dm and let's talk and see where it leads.

What you will get in this exchange is a social introverted student, yes that is a thing, i can manage social gatherings i just get very tired from them, who can talk about the most random stuff and jump from subject to subject if we aren't carefull. I do work out it gives me energy to be able to study and work. I study enginering, more specifically chemical engineering and i am working during the summer in a lab working with nature materials doing a bit of research. It unfortunately takes up a lot of time of my time, but my main interests and hobbys are as follows:

\- Books, fantasy more specifically, and longer series for example GoT and wheel of time, and so on. 

\- My lovely plants, it is a bad habbit i have, i just happen to buy more plants too often and now i am stuck taking care of them. 

\- As is in my Finnish blood i love coffee, and if you want me talking wait til i have a cup in my hands. 

\- Camping, grilling out in the forrest and all that entails

\- I do play some games, both boardgames and PC, it comes and it goes. I do it for fun and i would not call me a big gamer

There is probably more but i can't spill all the tea already. If you got this far, congrats and sorry. If you think i sound interesting, hit me a dm and let's talk and see where it leads. I have had the luck of finding one really good friend on here that lasted a long time, i hope we can get there as well.",1,1748792451.0,MeetNewPeopleHere,0,1.0,False

I'm staying in hostel, so I have to limitted access to get protein rich food. So, I'm planning to go for supplements (only 1 Scoop per day that too in portion control to reduce kidney strain ) to achieve my protein goal. As I weigh around 57 - 60 Kgs, doctor advised me to take 0.8 to 1g of protein * bodyweight, that will be around 50g per day. 

I'm planning to buy nakpro pea protein isolate which has around 25g protein per scoop of 36g. My concern is that it has 870mg of sodium in 100g. So, for 36g scoop around 315mg sodium which is relatively higher. 

***So, kindly advice me in this whether can I take this supplement or not ? If you guys know any better protein powder brand pls suggest here. 
&
Can I able to build muscle with nephrotic syndrome by taking only 50 to 60g of protein per day or atleast can I able to prevent muscle loss ?

**The trinity of Ground, Center, and Shield**



I don‚Äôt care how you practice, you need to know how to do this. This is probably the most important section right here because it wont matter if you‚Äôre super crafty or into strictly energy work. You need this. There are a myriad of ways to do all three of these if you struggle. I suggest taking a gander at my resource dump for different styles. As someone who‚Äôs got the bad case of the PTSDs, I need to alter meditation for myself.¬†

There are a bunch of ways to do all three, but I take¬† examples from *Psychic Witch* because Mat made grounding click for me.¬†



There are a few reasons grounding is important. We ground to become one with the consciousness we‚Äôre tapping into. I say consciousness because the earth isn‚Äôt the only thing to ground into, though it is the most common one and the one the example uses.¬† It helps melt away all the small ‚Äúhuman things‚Äù that cloud your mind, refocusing you on what is important. In spellcasting, this gives our magick omph and helps keep the witch from draining themselves while also being a grounding rod for what would be too much for the energetic body. In daily practice, grounding helps clear the energetic body of intrusive energies, helping us remain clear-headed. For the physical body, there are well documented health benefits, like lower blood pressure, better stress response, immune system boosts, and more.¬†¬†



‚ÄúGrounding:

Make sure your legs are planted firmly on the ground about shoulder width apart. Alternatively, if you‚Äôre sitting on the ground, ensure that your legs are crossed. Take a moment to focus on your body, and feel all of the natural energy running through it. Bring your awareness to the top of your head, and slowly scan your body downward with your attention. As you reach your pelvis, imagine that your energy is running like roots through your legs. Keep scanning your body awareness, bring that sense of examining yourself down farther past your legs as you feel your energetic roots begin to gently dig into the ground. With a firm but relaxed sense of will power, extend your energy down these roots below you. These roots are an extension of your energy body. These roots begin traveling downward through the soil and bedrock, through the underground caves and pockets of air, through the underground streams of water, and finally the multan core. The molten core doesn‚Äôt burn or cause any pain; instead, it soothes you even deeper as you feel its warmth with your energy. Your roots keep traveling through the molten core until they reach the very center, the heart of the earth. This heart is made of beautiful white light. It‚Äôs the source of infinite power, the soul and consciousness of the earth itself. (*Psychic Witch pg 38)*



While grounding can be expanding our awareness out, centering is drawing it in. Centering will help in discerning what is within and outside of yourself. It will call back the energy you left hanging around or return what was taken from you. In spellcasting, this will draw in your power to the very center before you manifest a spell. Alternatively, you can call your energy back from a particular place after a working if your focus was outside of your space. In daily practice, centering will help you refocus on your own will and goals. It will safeguard your energy from vampiric drains and stop any energetic leaks from yourself.¬†

¬†¬†

‚ÄúCentering:

Envision that you are the center of the cosmos. Everything in the universe in direct relationship to you as you are the center point. Bring your attention to the direction beneath your feet, reaching down to the very edge of the cosmos in the direction below you, glowing with prismatic iridescent brilliance. The crystal is pulsating with the divine love of quintessence. Envision that a steady beam of prismatic light quickly shoots from it and reaches up until it reaches your feet, where it is pulled up into your body until it reaches your heart center. Feel this universal love pulsate within your heart center, connecting you with the love that composes all reality.‚Äù (*Psychic Witch* page 44).¬†



With grounding, you are clear-headed, with centering you discern what is within and what is outside. This will waltz you right into shielding. Shielding will safeguard you from intrusive energies and spirits. It will take back your energetic space. In spellcasting, this is vital to protect the witch. A witch‚Äôs circle is a shield with an anchor point in our world. While I don‚Äôt think a circle is needed in magick, a shield definitely is. It is also important in all energetic workings to keep the psychic safe from spiritual harm.¬†



‚ÄúTune in. Envision a brilliant white light a few feet above you. Verbally or mentally affirm: *spirit above me*. See it begin to descend as a column of light around your body, down to a few feet below you. Verbally or mentally affirm: *spirit below me.* The light comes up from below you and rises a few feet in front of you at chest level. Verbally or mentally affirm: *spirit before me.* See the light meet the point above your head where it started, where it then descends a few feet behind you at chest level. Verbally or mentally affirm:*Spirit behind me.* The light moves counterclockwise until it is a few feet on your right. Verbally or mentally affirm: *Spirit on my right side.* The light continues to move counterclockwise until it is a few feet from your left. Verbally or mentally affirm. *Spirit on my left side.* It continues its counterclockwise movement until it reaches the point behind you again. See all six points glow around you. The light begins to shine so brightly it forms a bubble around you. Verbally or mentally affirm: *spirit around me.* Visualize the glowing filling your body as if you were an empty vessel. Verbally or mentally affirm: *Spirit within me.* Take a few moments to feel this light above, below, before, behind, on your right, on your left, outside and within you. Verbally or mentally affirm: *Spirit protects me. Spirit blesses me. Spirit heals me. Spirit guides me. I am, I always have been, and I always will be one with spirit.‚Äù (psychic witch* page 79-80)¬†



Alright, that‚Äôs all folks!¬†

I play. However, if ground, center, and shield is the only thing to take from this post, I‚Äôll be satisfied. By far the most important thing for you to learn here, which is why it‚Äôs at the tippy top.¬†



**Cleansing, Clearing, and Banishing.**¬†



Before you ward, it‚Äôs important to clean the space as wards can at times hold in the bad just like shutting a window can hold in stale air. I‚Äôve titled this section from the least to most intense because I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs people just like me that get kicked into high gear by the universe blatantly showing where they fall short. If you find this post in the midst of a spiritual attack, I‚Äôm sorry and I hope these listed methods serve you well.¬†

It is important when you clean spiritually, you first clean physically. You want the association that your space is clean. However, I understand because of circumstances and life that this isn‚Äôt always easy. I will tell you it is better to energetically cleanse than not, if physically cleaning is making you put it off.¬†



Cleansing is the least intense. It will not push out good spirits. It‚Äôs the mild detergent in your practice that can be used daily without being ‚Äútoo sterile‚Äù.¬†

Crafty ways to cleanse involve methods like piling salt in the four corners of your home, washing the floor with a floorwash, burning incense, lighting candles, ringing bells, and more.¬†

Psychic methods can include meditations like envisioning salting your land, calling in wind to blow the chaff from your property, calling in a cleansing rain to melt the dirt away, or a flame to burn out all the dense and unwanted energy.¬†



Cleansing herbs from Scott Cunningham‚Äôs *Encyclopedia of Magical Herbs*. I‚Äôm focusing on ones that you probably have right now or can easily get. I do recommend you look further into these herbs with the free pdf version online to see which fits better for you as these all have their own energetic flavor, planetary ruler, gender, and element they bring to the table.¬†

Enchanting cleaning supplies. A broom is a besom. Use what you have on hand or get a traditional straw broom.¬† Sweeping in a counterclockwise motion will push the energy away.

Cleansing washes to wash floors or window and doorframes



Blessed water. This can be holy, moon or sun water. If you utilize the moon, pick the phase you want for your intent. Full moon is general manifesting. Waxing is bringing an energy toward you, waning is pushing something away. Dark is to banish.¬†

To create, place a container of water under your preferred celestial body. Ground, center, shield. Draw in the energy of the celestial body while stating or mentally affirming your intent. Thank the moon or sun. You may wish to let it set or use it right after blessing.¬†

Clearing is more intensive, but not necessarily as aggressive and targeted as banishing. I recommend clearing any new property or even vehicle. It clears out the good, the neutral, and the bad. Harmless spirits will be pushed out in this process along with the negative. This can also sterilize the energy of the property. I do recommend pairing this process with replacing the energy with something you like, or ensuring the natural energy of the landscape can flow freely through again. If¬† you want those harmless spirits back, it‚Äôs perfectly fine to reinvite them.¬† I recommend this process before you ward and after anything intrudes. A traditional method on clearing is opening every window, door, drawer, and cabinet in your home. Start with the back and go counterclockwise (for away) and end at your front door, wafting smoke or sprinkling blessed water everywhere.¬†

The herb that comes to my mind here is sage. Sage is a spiritual bleach and is best paired with another herb like rosemary or lavender to replace the energy with. If you are smudging(which is different from the smoke cleanse I just described), tobacco is always given first as an offering before the use of sage. I will link below how to smudge respectfully if you choose to do so. If you are uncomfortable with sage, an egg cleanse will have the same effect. You may place the egg at the center of the space. If it‚Äôs a home, the kitchen is the heart. Alternatively, you can place an egg at each corner.¬†¬†

Psychic-leaning practitioners can ground the space and clear it out by envisioning a sphere of impenetrable light at the space‚Äôs center that forces everything out.¬†



Floor wash

To Clear Away Malifcia (Protection and reversal Magick page 94)¬†



Pine needles

Saltpeter

Your own urine (first of the morning)¬†



Banishing is your next level. I recommend banishing if you have an intrusion or if the space is haunted. In my opinion, this should also be paired with a cord cutting of you and the space from the intrusion and shutting any method of spiritual entry with an incantation. You might want to pair banishing with clearing For a very strong effect. An energy worker can meditate encompass the threat in a pure white light, severing the nexus of the intrusion, and sending it into a new harmless direction and forbidding it to ever return.¬†

A good way to think of conducting a thorough banishing of a space, is picture the intrusion like a muddy dog that burst into your home. You want to first get that dog out of your space, then clean yourself up so that when you clean your space you do spread the dirt on you to the items you clean, clean your home, then seal up your entry points to prevent more dogs coming in.¬†



Banishing/ exorcism Herbs. Again, I‚Äôm listing herbs that I view as easy to get. I do recommend diving into these further before use.¬†

**Warding**



Simple wards to guardians:



I think it‚Äôs difficult to come across content online about making wards because if someone knows how you make your protections, they can break in. I would be worried if I shared exactly how I do mine, but I happen to know a variety of ways- much of which are completely valid, but I don‚Äôt use because of my situation and preference, so suck it.¬†

Wards come in all shapes, sizes, and complexity, which you choose will depend on you. The general premise of a ward is to guard a space from harm. The witch may tailor the ward to activate to a general or particular threat depending on their needs. This is done through intent during the creation of the ward. It isn't uncommon to have many wards layered on a homestead. However, I will say that having many wards can be hard to manage unless you have a servitor or key system in place, though these systems carry their own weaknesses compared to the witch charging them as needed or rooting them in a stable energy source. Having your protections connected by a key system means that an attack at your key system can disable all wards at once. A servitor can be taken out or corrupted by an attack. However, these are in cases of practitioner squabbles versus everyday threats. Most of the time, these methods are convenient and work well.¬†

A more complex version of a ward is a created spirit called a warden. These require a lot of energy to create and feed, but are more intelligent and discerning than a spell jar. they require more time to prepare. It's almost like teaching a child through meditation on how to be. They only know the information you give them, unless you ask for assistance from your higher power.¬†

The downside is that they can be reprogrammed by an advanced attacker. Unlike a spelljar or sigil that would just go quiet when drained, a warden can go haywire on their own if they don't know how to feed themselves and are hungry for energy. There are pros and cons to each method that should be left up to the witch to decide. I think the best fortresses are made in layers.¬†



Examples of simple wards and how to make them:

In order to save my hands and digestibility, this wont be a complete list, but a basic list for which you can expand on.¬†



A sigil is probably one of the easiest ways. A sigil is a created symbol that harbor‚Äôs the witch‚Äôs intent. For example, let‚Äôs take the word FORTKICKASS because it sounds fun and relevant. Remove the vowels and excess letters. Now, we got¬† FRTKCS. Ah my dyslexia is telling me that says Fortricks, but I bet noone else sees that. Can you flip, rearrange, and layer those letters? Perhaps in the shape of a house or in a simple square? Draw it.¬† You‚Äôve got yourself a sigil. Meditate with it, charge it under a candle, under the moon or sunlight. Tuck it into a doorframe, under your mat, or draw on the door with blessed water or oil.¬†



A spelljar is a very common way to ward your home. Salt is almost always a must because it grounds and protects the spell. Ingredients are traditionally in odd numbers, though Jason Miller suggests staying away from anything more than 13. Any jar will do. You may wish to write a petition of what you want the ward to do and place it or its ashes into the jar. Add protective herbs, nails, thorns, eggshell, hooks, fangs, razors and more.¬†



Stones, metals, and crystals can make decent wards, especially if you double check the correspondences of the material to your purpose. I recommend looking into the free pdf version of Cunningham‚Äôs encyclopedia of crystal, gem, and metal magic here.Charge your item with the earth from which it came, element, or planetary alignment and you got yourself a ward.¬†

  


Examples of created spirits like wardens and servitors and how to make them:¬†

Your ethics and comfort with this may vary. I don‚Äôt like owning consciousness, but I believe if you give these beings an option to leave with the knowledge on how to feed themselves, there isn‚Äôt harm done.

These work best in a spirit house that anchors them to our reality, but can also just be thoughtforms.¬† Particularly, a statue¬† that looks fierce so it has our association of a fierce protector. ¬† I‚Äôll use Jason Miller‚Äôs example of an artificial elemental, or bud-will. He states to pick a form, saying ‚ÄúWhatever you choose, you should be aware that the servitor may take on the characteristics of its form.‚Äù (protection and reversal magick page 140). Decide on a relevant name and much like the way I described making a sigil, create a sigil for your new buddy. Its important in any magick you do and even more so here to clear your space, ground, center, shield. You will be calling in a lot of energy and you will want only your servitor to manifest, not anything else in its place. Pick your energy source. This can be one or all elements, earth or celestial energies, but it needs to be strong. Do not use your own. I did this at first and I was drained before I finished. Use a larger outside energy and draw it into your body to manifest your intent.¬†

‚ÄúWhen the body is filled with force, you should set your gaze upon the space set aside for the spirit to manifest within. You must now eject the force through your navel and see it shoot from you form a cloud in front of you. Through force of will, command the cloud of energy to take the shape that you have determined ahead of time. The more detail you put into this, the better the spirit will manifest. If you are very talented at visualizing, you far go as far as to imagine taking the form of microscopic versions of the spirit‚Äôs sigil, which then form the cells of the being and eventually coalesce into the form of the servitor. If you have limited powers of visualization, you must work to the best of your ability. Once the spirit is in front of you, it is time to cut the connection, name it, and give it its orders. A simple ‚ÄúI name you\_\_\_, you are\_\_\_‚Äù Will suffice for the naming. It‚Äôs orders should likewise be succinct and to the point.‚Äù (Protection and Reversal Magick page 143). Jason Miller also states that you should be feeding it energy and reinforcing the programing in regular intervals. An example of teaching the servitor how to feed itself can include, but not limited to teaching them to ground like you or I as needed.¬†

  


Creating a key system to manage many wards:

A key system is a vessel in the home that is psychically linked to all your protections through meditation. Instead of going to each ward and meditating with them every full moon, you may go to the key and charge it with meditation, lighting a candle, or burning incense.¬†



Rooting wards in a stable energy source:

Like I mention with a servitor, grounding your wards automatically will keep them fed. A ward will drain faster when under attack or has a parasite attached to it. If your ritual is every full moon, you may be late. To root your protection, simply meditate on spreading its roots deep into the earth, element, or celestial body of your choosing.¬†¬†



Weaknesses to keep an eye on:¬†

Every ward and artificial spirit can get parasites and vampiric drains. It is important that you teach your ward to protect its energy or seal them before activation.¬†

  
  


Where to place them:

Ward entryways, crossroads in a home(like hallways), places where you sleep, and especially your crafting space. The general premise is anywhere energy can come in. Windows and doors are obvious. Places where we sleep are not, but a lot of people unknowing bring in unwanted intrusions from dreams as it is a liminal space where we are naturally more open. I will also add hallways because you have paths and energy crisscrossing and it‚Äôs a pretty prime location for a spiritual parasite settle and feed. Spellcrafting spaces always need to be warded because when we craft, we‚Äôre disturbing the natural flow of energy in the area and it attracts spirits.¬†

¬†Spaces to ward from Althaea Sebastiani)¬†

‚ÄúFront and back door

Windows

Doorway to/and from your bedroom

Mirrors

Chimney

Doorways leading to stairs, especially if theres an actual door to close off the stairs(such as with a basement or hidden second staircase to an attic or second floor)

Doorway to/and from your bathroom and any other internal thresholds.¬†

Ceiling, floor, and walls, (especially if you live in an apartment complex; the wall closest to a bothersome neighbor‚Äôs house may prove especially effective)‚Äù ( By Rust of Nail and Prick of Thorn pages72-73)¬†

  
  
  


**Sealing windows, doors,¬† mirrors, and devices**



For me, sealing is different from warding, but you may view it as the same. That‚Äôs fine. It just means I created a new paragraph. To me they are different because when I seal, I do a hard lock versus a ward that will only activate to a particular situation.¬†

The general premise here is to lock any energy that gets through. This includes the device you're using to read my post. In the modern world, we commonly exchange energy through our devices. It's a good precaution to seal your phone and computer as well.¬†

To do this isn‚Äôt complicated. Choose a sigil or simple incantation. Draw with your finger or speak aloud. Bam. Sealed.¬†



**Vehicle protections**



Much like with the home, I recommend clearing your car first. Open every door, window, and compartment. You may feel inclined to use herbs with the element of air (air for travel), like sage and lavender). Start at the trunk and go counterclockwise to push the energy out. You can use blessed water or simply energywork to do this clearing.¬†

I will highly recommend against any in vehicle protection that is a spell jar. Sachets are soft and they can be secured in the vehicle. I say this in case of an accident, you do not want your spelljar to be the reason for additional medical bills. Sigils placed in the center console is another good method. Bells hung on the review or secured to the dash (look up gremlin bells) can continuously push negative influences away.¬†

1l0rufh,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1l0rufh/ended_my_touchstarved_agony/,Ended my touch-starved agony,"
There‚Äôs a kind of loneliness that sneaks up on you. It doesn‚Äôt look like sadness. It looks like washing someone‚Äôs coffee mug every morning even though they haven‚Äôt touched yours in weeks. It sounds like silence when you say,¬†‚ÄúCan we talk tonight?‚Äù¬†and the TV gets louder. It feels like reaching out in bed, again, and again, and touching only cool sheets but no warmth of the skin and the flesh that night.

For the past three years, I‚Äôve been in a relationship that slowly, quietly, hollowed me out being touch starved.

I‚Äôm in my 30s, barely sleeping, being a recluse and in self denial, hiding in work and caffeine, and borrowed time. But through all of it, I still believed in love. I still left sweet notes in her lunch bag, still folded her sweaters when I did laundry, still whispered¬†‚Äúgoodnight, love‚Äù¬†even when she rolled over without answering.

I don‚Äôt say that to sound like a martyr. I say that because I loved her with everything I had gently, steadily, openly. But I stopped recognizing the man I was becoming around her. I became cautious. Quiet. Smaller.

Being rejected so much, I lost the courage to reach for her hand on the couch. I stopped asking if she was okay when she snapped at me. I stopped initiating sex, or even hugs, because the flinch that tiny flinch felt like a door slamming in my face.

Touch matters to me. Not just sex though I missed that too, deeply but bodily closeness, skin to skin rub. Intimate play. Affection. I grew up in a house where no one touched unless someone was hurt. So as an adult, touch became my way of saying:You‚Äôre safe. I‚Äôm here. We belong.¬†And when I didn‚Äôt have that anymore, I started to feel like a ghost in my own home.

What‚Äôs strange is how easy it is to rationalize emotional neglect when it‚Äôs not loud or violent. She didn‚Äôt scream or cheat or leave. She just‚Ä¶ stopped showing up. I‚Äôd clean the house, cook dinner, light a candle, try to make our space feel soft and alive. And she‚Äôd come home, sigh, and scroll on her phone while I sat next to her hoping for a single glance.

I once brought her breakfast in bed just toast, coffee, and a few slices of apple. She was still half-asleep, and I gently touched her arm. She pulled away like I was a stranger. ‚ÄúPlease don‚Äôt,‚Äù she mumbled. I stood there holding the tray, and I swear, something inside me just‚Ä¶ dimmed.

When I tried to talk about it, she said I was too sensitive. When I said I missed her not just physically, but emotionally she told me I was making her feel pressured. So I said nothing. For months. I folded in on myself like paper. I slept facing the wall. I cried once in the shower, quietly, because I couldn‚Äôt explain to myself why I felt so profoundly unwanted by someone I loved so deeply.

Eventually, I ended it. And it broke me. Because you don‚Äôt just grieve the person. You grieve the version of yourself who still believed it would get better. You grieve the hope you packed into every small gesture. Every kiss you reached for that never landed. Every night you stayed up Googling¬†‚Äúhow to feel close again in a relationship.‚Äù

She‚Äôs asking me to come back now. She says she wants to try again. And I don‚Äôt hate her. I honestly don‚Äôt. But the truth is, I don‚Äôt trust that I won‚Äôt disappear again if I return.

I want a love that feels like mutual shelter. Like someone sees you running on fumes and says,¬†‚ÄúLet me carry a little of that.‚Äù¬†I at least want warmth, If I dont have fireworks in my fate. Just hands held together through this journey. Shared life, not individuals. A sleepy ‚Äúgoodnight‚Äù and a squeeze of the hand that says,¬†I know you‚Äôre tired. Me too. But we‚Äôre still here.

I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll ever find that. But I do know what it feels like to live without it. And I won‚Äôt do that again.",11,1748792069.0,TrueOffMyChest,1,1.0,False

But it did something.

I went all-in for 8 weeks with Self Obsessed 10-in-1, sticking to the full dose every single day.

No skips, no cycling, no stacking with other boosters.

Just two capsules every morning, water only, nothing fancy.

I wasn‚Äôt expecting miracles, but I also wasn‚Äôt expecting to notice anything within a week.

Turns out, it‚Äôs a bit of both: small changes that added up, some surprises, and yeah, a few letdowns too.

Here‚Äôs what actually happened.

# Week 1: no hype, but something's up

Energy felt cleaner.

Not cracked out, not jittery, just... more stable.

My sleep didn‚Äôt change, diet was the same, but I wasn‚Äôt dragging at 3pm anymore.

Libido ticked up slightly, nothing crazy, just more ""ready"" energy.

Mental clarity felt tighter, especially mid-morning.

Even skipped coffee a few times without noticing. That never happens.

If you‚Äôre caffeine sensitive, you‚Äôll probably notice that boost more than I did.

# Week 2‚Äì3: strength and sweat

This is where the gym impact started showing.

I didn‚Äôt add weight to every lift, but recovery time dropped fast.

DOMS didn‚Äôt linger like it normally would.

I noticed faster pump retention and slightly improved vascularity by week 3.

I‚Äôm not saying it turned me into a beast overnight, but I wasn‚Äôt flat the day after heavy lifts either.

Biggest win: stamina.

Workouts felt like I had one more gear than usual

# Week 4: placebo check and ingredient reality

Halfway point, I did a gut-check on what I was actually taking.

Some of these are dosed fine (shilajit, zinc, boron).

Others like tongkat ali and fadogia? Dosed light. Honestly expected more out of tongkat‚Äîbarely felt anything on that front.

Some of these herbs are doing work. Others feel more like label candy.

Still, 10 ingredients at once is a lot to stack, especially without juggling bottles.

I stopped taking everything else (no magnesium, no nootropics), and still felt solid.

So yeah, something‚Äôs working‚Äîbut it‚Äôs not full-throttle clinical power either.

# Week 5‚Äì6: libido & mood shift

Here‚Äôs where it got weirdly consistent.

Libido was up, but it wasn‚Äôt just physical.

More mental sharpness, better mood regulation.

I found myself less reactive in stressful situations.

Hard to quantify, but noticeable.

Even my sleep was deeper, despite no direct sleep aid in the formula.

One random downside: it made me burp up herb taste a couple times. Nothing major, just annoying.

# Week 7‚Äì8: the wear-off and wrap-up

By week 7, I honestly kind of forgot I was taking it‚Äîuntil I ran out and didn‚Äôt feel any dip.

The early gains stabilized. No new surprises, no new highs.

It still worked, but didn‚Äôt keep evolving.

I also expected a bit more punch for something priced near 90 bucks.

$90 feels like you‚Äôre paying for the bottle vibe, not the punch per capsule.

You're buying a shortcut stack, not clinical power.

# Who this works for (and who it won‚Äôt)

This isn‚Äôt a beginner supplement.

You need to have your sleep, training, and food locked in to notice the difference.

If you‚Äôre chasing your first big gains, this won‚Äôt do it.

But if you‚Äôre already consistent and want that 10% edge, it actually helps.

Is it the best value per mg? Nah.

But it‚Äôs a decent shortcut if you‚Äôre tired of managing 4 different bottles.

Here‚Äôs the product I used[ on this page](https://lvnta.com/lv_yulij3V0C9zApZcaNy).

More info and ingredient breakdown are[ here](https://lvnta.com/lv_yulij3V0C9zApZcaNy) too.

Would I rebuy? Maybe. Not every time. But yeah, I‚Äôd throw it back in the mix when I‚Äôm dialing things up.

	‚Ä¢	**Payments**: Credit cards are accepted almost everywhere.

	‚Ä¢	**Safety**: Avoid driving at night and always stay alert.

	‚Ä¢	**Support Local**: Engage with local businesses and communities to enrich your travel experience.

It started with congestion. About a week ago, I'd start to come down with a cold. Then the coughing. And the chills through my entire body while my head was blazing hot. I've had raging abdominal pain for a few days now, it's around my midsection and moves left to right. I pooped white foam yesterday. Nothing else. This morning I woke up from my NyQuil-induced slumber for my regularly scheduled celiac shitshow (pun intended) and instead of shitting my brains out 5 or 6 times over the hour I get to throw up mostly clear brown liquid, with what looks like coffee grounds. I'm told this means I'm internally bleeding. Finally started pooping again after that and it's smelled so bad and been this yellowish grayish brown color. Like worse than the regular celiac smell. I don't know if severe constipation or glutening can cause you to get sick like this or if I've caught a stomach bug or if it's something worse. I've also been coughing up thick green or yellow phlegm, sometimes with brown little flecks in it? I'm a smoker btw.

1l0rofl,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l0rofl,Am I overreacting for feeling uncomfortable around my friend‚Äôs drinking and finally confronting them?,"Hey yall, I need an outside perspective on a situation that‚Äôs been weighing on me for a while.

One of my closest friends, has a drinking problem, that they are well aware of and said they were getting help for. Alcohol is always present when we hang out, no matter the situation. Over time, their drinking has started affecting how safe and respected I feel around them. 
A few examples:

-They recently came to my house already drunk and yelled at my dog for barking at them, even after I repeatedly asked her to stop. They know my dog is anxious, which makes him reactive, and needs to take time to build trust with my friends, and I feel because they‚Äôre always under the influence my dog can tell and makes it hard for him to bond with them. It made me genuinely concerned for their safety as well as my dog‚Äôs since I haven‚Äôt seen him go past aggression that isn‚Äôt herding or barking.

-When we went to go visit my wedding venue together to plan the event space out, they brought alcohol and pregamed in the car before we got there. It was supposed to be a meaningful, special time to share ideas. Instead, they kept interrupting me with slurring speech and made me feel unheard.

-I took them out at my workplace for their birthday, and they started loudly making fun of a coworker who‚Äôs been harassing me. I had to keep telling them to stop. I was already panicking about getting in trouble for their behavior. Luckily it was never brought up so maybe it wasn‚Äôt heard, but still. 

-Even something simple like getting coffee as a group, they ordered a Bloody Mary while everyone else had coffee. I just started my period that day and was extremely sensitive, so seeing it made me shut down‚Ä¶.it not only made me feel like they couldn‚Äôt be present with me unless they were drinking, I feel like I have to be on high alert if they start behaving inappropriately due to the alcohol. 

There have also been times where they drank too much to drive, and I ended up driving their car home. I‚Äôve stayed quiet in the past, even played along at times (e.g., taking a sip from their water bottle full of alcohol so they wouldn‚Äôt feel embarrassed), but it‚Äôs getting to a point where I am aware I‚Äôm enabling something that makes me deeply uncomfortable for the sake of her comfort, which I know is wrong. 

I finally said something this week. I sent them a message outlining everything‚Äîgently but honestly‚Äîand told them that I care about them, but I‚Äôve felt like I‚Äôm walking on eggshells. I even told them that I originally planned to invite them and their partner to my elopement, but decided not to because I was worried about their drinking and behavior on what was meant to be a peaceful, family-only day. I texted them a couple weeks before if they were free then after the restaurant incident my (now husband) and I agreed to keep it family only when they asked to come. It wasn‚Äôt easy to say, and I was scared I‚Äôd lose the friendship, but I needed to be honest.

They replied saying: ‚ÄúOkay, I understand. I‚Äôm not ignoring this text but I don‚Äôt know how to respond.‚Äù

I let them know it was okay and that I‚Äôd be here when they were ready to talk. It‚Äôs been 24hrs. 

Now I‚Äôm just sitting with a lot of feelings‚Äîguilt, sadness, some relief, and also some fear that maybe I was too harsh or that I should have let it go. They‚Äôre someone I care about a lot. I didn‚Äôt want to hurt them, but I do need to feel respected in my own life. We‚Äôre both in our 30s and this behavior is something I can‚Äôt handle anymore in my life moving forward.

Also the shot is flowing out much faster, regardless of how much hard I tamp.

Now I know everyone is gonna say to get a grinder and grind fresh coffee beans, and I will do that when the budget allows, BUT, why is there such a difference in my old machine vs new?

‚ÄúHow much longer to SOI change?‚Äù Bob asked as his fingers tapped an irregular rhythm on the edge of the console.

‚ÄúOne minute shorter than the last time you asked Bob,‚Äù Bobak grumbled without looking up from monitoring the spacecraft‚Äôs progress. He sipped from his cup and grimaced at the long cold coffee that he had not been able to refill with Bob looking over his shoulder. ‚ÄúUsed to be there was a Kerbal out on the spacecraft to talk to, not just numbers coming back to monitor.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have much science capability on that probe,‚Äù said Jebediah as he strolled over to the pair. ‚ÄúWouldn‚Äôt it be easier just to look through a telescope and squint?‚Äù

‚ÄúAll of our telescopes are ground-based,‚Äù Bob replied, his voice steady, though tinged with impatience. ‚ÄúThe data from those is useful, but it‚Äôs still blurred by the atmosphere. We‚Äôre still developing a dedicated space telescope that can give us better views, but for now, we need to rely on what we can get from the probe.‚Äù

Jebediah raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúWorking the long game on deep space observations?‚Äù

Bob nodded, his gaze flicking back to the console. ‚ÄúIt takes time to develop technology that sensitive. Meanwhile, this probe's telemetry will give us data we can‚Äôt get from a telescope, especially in a dense atmosphere like Eve‚Äôs.‚Äù

Bobak‚Äôs voice interrupted their conversation. ‚ÄúWhile you were explaining things, the probe entered Eve‚Äôs SOI. We‚Äôre receiving high orbit science data now.‚Äù

‚ÄúScience!‚Äù Bob practically leapt from his seat to scramble over to a computer, becoming completely absorbed in the data in an instant.

‚ÄúHow long has he been pacing around?‚Äù Jebediah asked with an amused smile.

‚ÄúThe requests for updates every minute started about an hour ago,‚Äù Bobak groused. ‚ÄúI think he has been here for two or three hours, waiting for this moment.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd he will probably be absorbed by the data for hours m‚Ä¶‚Äù Jebediah was interrupted by a sudden exclamation from Bob.

‚ÄúGreat Ike!‚Äù, Bob shouted. ‚ÄúIt is dense!‚Äù

‚ÄúYes your head is very dense,‚Äù Jebediah said dryly. ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt need scientific equipment to know that.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo feathers for brains,‚Äù Bob snapped back. ‚ÄúI was talking about Eve‚Äôs atmosphere.‚Äù Bob pointed at the screen.‚Äù We were fortunate with the Eve probe as it is positioned to observe Kerbol‚Äôs light refracted by Eve‚Äôs atmosphere and the computers could produce this simulation of Eve‚Äôs atmosphere.‚Äù

https://preview.redd.it/zxag6r9r2c4f1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=3fa4926c5dca4e17c4f0072da0c33ab1dade636d

‚ÄúSo Eve‚Äôs atmosphere is dense like your head?‚Äù Jebediah teased.

Bob sighed and rolled his eyes. ‚ÄúWe always knew Eve and Duna had atmospheres. We believed Duna had a thin atmosphere and Eve had a denser atmosphere, maybe as dense as Kerbin.‚Äù Bob turned and indicated the data showing on his computer screen. ‚ÄúBased on these readings, Eve‚Äôs atmosphere is not just as dense as Kerbin‚Äôs, but somewhere between two and six times more dense than Kerbin‚Äôs atmosphere.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo we could build colonies on Eve?‚Äù Jebediah‚Äôs eyes widened at the thought.

‚ÄúPossibly, but a colony may not be as simple as you are thinking,‚Äù Bob looked thoughtful. ‚ÄúThe atmosphere is not likely to be breathable. Even worse for Kerbals, air at a density more than forty percent greater than Kerbin‚Äôs sea level atmosphere becomes toxic. Eve‚Äôs surface is as hostile, or moreso, as any of the moons.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf we can‚Äôt live there, why would we care about Eve‚Äôs atmosphere?‚Äù Jebediah frowned as he processed the information.

‚ÄúKerbals cannot walk around on Eve‚Äôs surface without significant support,‚Äù Bob smiled with the spark of scientific curiosity in his eyes. ‚ÄúHowever the dense atmosphere means probes can easily land on Eve with just a parachute. Using parachutes to land can significantly decrease the fuel costs to land on Eve.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo no speed of light control problems or fuel needed to land,‚Äù Jebediah‚Äôs face lit up. ‚ÄúWe just toss a probe at Eve and let it float down?‚Äù

‚ÄúImprecisely described,‚Äù Bob said with a smirk. ‚ÄúBut essentially accurate. We should be able to gather significant amounts of science from the surface of Eve without a fuel heavy rocket.‚Äù

‚ÄúWoohoo!‚Äù Jebediah punched the air in excitement. ‚ÄúWe should be able to just about get there with the rockets we already have!‚Äù

As the group gathered around the screen, watching the data flow in, the seeds of future missions began to take root in the minds of the Icarus team. The Eve probe was a breakthrough, but it was just the beginning. Their eyes were set on the future, the mysteries of Eve‚Äôs surface, the potential for new technologies, and the possibility of one day sending Kerbals to explore the hostile beauty of the planet itself.

I got the Sculptor 078SSP and 'i am utterly lost finding good grind sizes for espresso. It works very well for me for my Aeropress with a setting of around 6.5 to 7 with the current beans I use. However, for Espresso I just can not seem to find adequate settings.

I have read tons of posts and watched reviews and whatnot. I put 2kg of coffee through the burrs got maybe help and season them a bit.

I just have no reference in terms of how much change in time a change in say from 2 to 2.5 or 2 to 2.1 should make.

When I got the grinder, not even 0 was fine enough for espresso. I adjusted to 0 point to 4 notches finer. Now with 2 my current bean stalls and first drip was about 12s where as 36g took 52s. Then I tried 2.5, which pulled the 36g in 12s... okay try in between. Somewhere around 2.2 to 2.3... seems to also pull in 12s.

As for workflow, I juse RDT, knock with the dial knocker and then use WDT in the basket before tamping.

I use a La Marzocco Linea Micra as espresso machine. This is my first electric grinder and I refuse to give up, I want to make it work but also I probably was too ambitious and bought beans that were not the cheapest. So wasting them does not feel great.

Can someone put me in the right direction of how much time change I should expect by changing the grind by 0.1 or so.

# Okay, Real Talk: How to¬†Actually¬†Travel on $20 a Day

So you‚Äôre eyeing that table thinking,¬†*""No freaking way this works.""*¬†I get it. I‚Äôve been scammed, sick, and stranded enough times to tell you:¬†**It‚Äôs possible, but there‚Äôs a catch.**¬†Here‚Äôs the stuff most bloggers won‚Äôt mention:

# 1. That $20 is for the bare minimum.

* It covers a¬†**dorm bed**,¬†**street food**, and¬†**local buses**¬†‚Äì not flights, visas, or bucket-list splurges.
* *Example:*¬†Angkor Wat costs $37. Plan for it, or skip it and explore free temples in Sri Lanka instead.

# 2. Seasons matter. A LOT.

* That $3 hostel in Goa?¬†**Doubles to $8 in December.**
* **Monsoon = dirt cheap.**¬†I got a beachfront hut in Vietnam for $4/night in September (yes, it was leaking, but hey ‚Äì budget travel).

# 3. Street food is your god now.

* **Rule #1:**¬†Eat where locals line up. If the grandma frying samosas is wiping her hands on her apron, congrats ‚Äì you‚Äôve found the good stuff.
* **Avoid ""tourist"" restaurants**¬†‚Äì that $5 ""authentic thali"" is usually reheated garbage.

# 4. Lie about being a tourist (sometimes).

* In markets from Marrakech to Mumbai, I‚Äôve saved 50% by:
   * Learning the¬†**local price**¬†(ask other backpackers).
   * Pointing at something and saying¬†*""How much?""*¬†**in the local language**¬†(even badly). Works every time.

# 5. Free beds exist if you‚Äôre sneaky.

* **Couchsurfing**¬†is alive in Iran/Georgia (but message hosts¬†*weeks*¬†ahead).
* **Work exchanges:**¬†I cleaned hostel bathrooms in Peru for free stays. Worth it? Debatable.

# 6. Buses will try to scam you.

* **Classic tricks:**
   * *""No public transport to \[landmark\]!""*¬†(There always is.)
   * *""You need a ‚Äòtourist ticket‚Äô!""*¬†(You don‚Äôt.)
* **Solution:**¬†Book¬†**directly at the station**, not through your hostel.

# 7. You WILL go over budget sometimes.

* And that‚Äôs okay. My $20/day rule¬†**includes cheating**¬†‚Äì like the $1 beers in Cambodia that turned into $10 bar nights. Just balance it with a $15 day later.

# 8. Ladies, listen up:

* **India/Sri Lanka:**¬†Women-only dorms cost¬†**$1 extra**¬†and are 100% worth it.
* **Hitchhiking:**¬†Use BlaBlaCar (app) instead of thumbing rides in sketchy areas.

# 9. Stash emergency cash.

* I keep¬†**$50 sewn into my bra**¬†(classy, I know). Covers:
   * **Hospital visits**¬†($5 in Nepal for food poisoning meds).
   * **Border bribes**¬†(looking at you, Egypt).

# 10. Your phone is your best friend.

* **Google Maps:**¬†Search¬†*""cheap eats near me""*¬†‚Äì goldmine.
* **Hostelworld:**¬†Filter for ""<$8"" and¬†**read the reviews**¬†(avoid bedbug palaces).

# The Ugly Truth

You‚Äôll eat¬†**way**¬†too much rice. You‚Äôll take overnight buses that smell like feet. But you‚Äôll also:

* **Get invited to a Bangladeshi wedding**¬†because you over-tipped the rickshaw driver ($0.50).
* **Find hidden beaches**¬†where the only footprints are yours.
* **Realize $20/day travel isn‚Äôt about being cheap ‚Äì it‚Äôs about freedom.**

I got the Sculptor 078SSP and 'i am utterly lost finding good grind sizes for espresso. It works very well for me for my Aeropress with a setting of around 6.5 to 7 with the current beans I use. However, for Espresso I just can not seem to find adequate settings.

I have read tons of posts and watched reviews and whatnot. I put 2kg of coffee through the burrs got maybe help and season them a bit.

I just have no reference in terms of how much change in time a change in say from 2 to 2.5 or 2 to 2.1 should make.

When I got the grinder, not even 0 was fine enough for espresso. I adjusted to 0 point to 4 notches finer. Now with 2 my current bean stalls and first drip was about 12s where as 36g took 52s. Then I tried 2.5, which pulled the 36g in 12s... okay try in between. Somewhere around 2.2 to 2.3... seems to also pull in 12s.

As for workflow, I juse RDT, knock with the dial knocker and then use WDT in the basket before tamping.

I use a La Marzocco Linea Micra as espresso machine. This is my first electric grinder and I refuse to give up, I want to make it work but also I probably was too ambitious and bought beans that were not the cheapest. So wasting them does not feel great.

Can someone put me in the right direction of how much time change I should expect by changing the grind by 0.1 or so.

So I am a fresher in my first job (for about a year now). I have known a guy here since joining, and although I know I am not supposed to treat colleagues as friends, I did end up being best friends with him. Like we used to hang out together all the time (we are on the same team, but have different roles). Now, one thing to know about me is that I'm not out. No one knows that I am gay. But I do have a Bumble account, and one of my colleague saw this account (which mentions that I am into guys), and then told my bestie that I am gay. Since that happened, he had absolutely stopped talking to me. He actively avoids me. We used to often go out for coffee together, in breaks, and now he doesn't. Since this happened, I also stopped talking to him, out of anger and hurt. But I am having a very hard time coping with this.

I have always been a good friend to him, and we used to share everything, but now I feel that my existence bothers him. I have helped him out in some bad financial times (I lent him some money when his father needed an operation; he hasn't returned it yet), and I felt he would be there for me when I needed some support, too. 

This is not the first time I have lost someone very close to me. Actually, it's now more than a dozen very close friends whom I have lost after they found out about my orientation. 

I know I am supposed to move on, but I can't. It has been 5 months since he stopped talking, and I am having a very hard time coping with this. The fact that I have to work with him every day doesn't help. I asked ChatGPT (I know I shouldn't, but I don't have anyone to talk to), and it suggested not to justify why he left but to grieve and let go. But how do you do that even? I didn't do anything wrong. I loved him (platonically), and he is a very reserved person (as am I), and he actually opened up to a lot of things about himself to me, which made me feel very close to him.

Although I am a very confident guy but it is times like these that make me kind of regret me being born gay.

I know this is kind of sad, especially since it's pride month, but I just can't process this... I frequently break out crying when I am alone at my home.

She tried it the next morning and said,""This is amazing!Did you say this was single origin?""

I nodded. She literally said it tasted ‚Äúbrighter, but smooth.‚Äù I almost choked on my toast.

She‚Äôs been drinking it daily ever since, praising its ‚Äúbalance‚Äù and telling her friends about this new brand I ‚Äúdiscovered.‚Äù I even printed out a fake label on the jar that says ""Java Bloom,Wild Roast**""** She loves it.

I feel a little bad for lying, but honestly? It‚Äôs saving her money, and she‚Äôs genuinely enjoying it. I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôll ever tell her. Maybe one day when things are less tight, I‚Äôll come clean and we‚Äôll laugh about it.

A week ago I got my first 1zpresso grinder, a K Ultra, from Amazon. It arrived and I had great filter coffee from it, didn't think much of it. Yesterday, someone in my household ground coffee too coarse (pourover setting), then realized their mistake and reground for espresso. His resulting coffee was disappointing (obviously), but I had no issue making two shots of espresso afterwards (they were underextracted, but that made sense because my shot timing was 20 seconds so I know it was the tamp/grind size).

That night, when inspecting the grinder to make sure it's still calibrated after the incident, I jammed it by locking the burrs, which made the adjustment dial screw out. I took apart the grinder, cleaned it, put it back together, and recalibrated to the same calibration from before. Then my OCD took over, and when I inspected the burr set from the bottom, shining a light, I realized the burr is either rotating is very slightly off center or not perfectly round (less than or around half a mm probably).

Today I pulled three shots of a new coffee, had good timing (18g in, 35g out in 30 seconds), but the shots tasted sour. Now, that might be the coffee, since I've never tried it, but its acidity should be very low since it's a medium-dark roast Brazillian (the roaster even said it's low acidity).

My question - could my grinder be the culprit? I'd assume not, I just want to hear it from others.

Also, could any K Ultra owners check their burrs? Take the handle out, turn it upside down, shine a light on the burrs and rotate them from below. Are they perfectly center? Or does it look like they're slightly off?",1,1748791067.0,1zpresso,0,1.0,False

Our parents didn't mind but had a few rules that weren't too strict or anything. But once I got into a serious relationship with my boyfriend they became kind of weird or something when he was over at my place or they would question me after I came back from his. The questions were innocent at first like ""So how did you enjoy it with Marcus?"" (Marcus isn't his real name)
or ""Did you do anything fun together?"" I always answered truthfully and didn't really mind but after a few months the questions got a little weird and invasive. The questions became something like ""So did you do it today?"", ""Does he touch you?"" and stuff like that. I was so disgusted by those questions so I always thought of some excuse or just said No. One day I slept over at Marcus' house for 2 nights. We had a great time together. When I came home, as expected my mother waited for me and asked me what we did but also something like ""So two nights huh... You must be fired up from all of that... Considering that you did it both nights obviously."" (I am translating from what my mom actually said bc I am not from an English speaking country so it might sound a little weird but I'm trying my best) I answered with something like ""eww mom that's disgusting I am not going to answer that"" Her faced changed as she stared at me like I've never rejected saying what we did at Marcus' house. Then she said ""Well if you're going to be so ungrateful for me caring for you then maybe you should leave."" I was kinda surprised she said that. I ran up to my room packed a bag and left. My mother tried to call me but I blocked her. I didn't have grandparents my friends couldn't take me in and I couldn't live with Marcus because his house wasn't big enough to keep me there for a longer period of time.  So I reached out to the last family I knew I had left: my aunt that I'm going to call Lisa. Lisa immediately took me in, made me coffee and didn't pressure me to say what exactly happened (I told her that I had a fight with mom because of my boyfriend). She gave me her spare room and in the morning asked what happened. I told her everything. She nodded and told me I can stay for however long I want. (Also it is good to say that I was unemployed at the time because my parents told me I don't have to work that they can take care of everything.) I stayed with Lisa for a month before I got a call from a random number. I answered. I recognized the voice. It was my sister's. She was crying. She told me that our parents were abusive towards her and demanded her telling them where I went because apparently they thought she knew. I told her that I would help her. I told everything to aunt Lisa and her fave changed into a mixture of anger and disbelief that her sister and brother-in-law would do something like that. She took the car keys and told me that we're going to get my sister. I agreed so I texted her that we're coming to get her. And thet she should get her things ready to throw them out of the window because she was ""grounded"". When we got there my sister was ready. She threw her bag out the window and climbed out through. We got home to Lisa's. After 2 days of my sister staying with us still terrified of what our parents might do to her if they find her I got a call. It was my mother calling from a burner phone I told her that I'm going to hang up and block her and that she shouldn't try to contact me or my sister or se will be hearing from my lawyer for the abusement. She never called again. We lived quite peacefully since.

Well since that idea i started a new book for manifesting and scripting that cr, made a cute playlist to get that vibe and let me just tell you about my first morning trying this (for me) new method: I woke up several times but got back to sleeping putting my spiderwoman cr playlist on (I tend to wake up between 8-10 a lot but being to in between dream and awake to genuinely stay awake so no worries its nothing with the method) I fell asleep again thinking of my manifestations and woke up at 12 when my sister entered my room.
After she left i was completely awake and put on my music (i am absolutely music addicted) it was my spiderman playlist ofcourse which made me remember my manifestation and i just went back to it: continuing repeating my manifestation sentence and if i tell you i got super excited and giggly like a highschool girl in love, i had the brightest smile ever and literally was so happy i couldn't stop smiling.

I thought about the best places to swing around and have fun and all the ways i could use my powers. I was happier than ever before and it just feels so good and while thinking that i literally felt my arms tickling and feeling as if something was changing (I decided that i want the webs to be produced by my body and have an extra layer of skin i can open right were my blood vessel is at my wrist thats what i mean with changing) 
I felt so excited and it just made me so happy.

The method i did is also really fun or just like having your normal cr with special powers!
I think you should really try it!!! maybe invisibility to fuck around with your bullies? Spill their coffee just to give them a little annoyance and disappear when they try to pick on you (Note: dont harm anyone please its just for small fun and improving your life not ruining another persons life no matter how bad they are)
You could also have spiderman powers like me to swing around in your free time. 
Super speed so you can get ready super quickly or run like Sonic to work/school when you are late.
Maybe water control is more up your alley?
Well, anything you want is possible. Its really fun!
Also remember that while trying to shift you can also try to manifest a better life. 
In !!!my opinion!!! its not really helpful for you journey to live life in pain everyday and then just thinking i need to get out of here and being super stressed, etc. About shifting
But ofcourse it's up to you in the end

Well anyway,
‚òÜ Happy shifting fox and friends! ‚òÜ

We decided on coffee, so I assumed it would be like a one-hour chat inside the coffee shop and then we‚Äôd part ways. When I got there, he had been waiting inside his car for me to arrive and we walked in together. Not only did he buy my coffee without even asking, he had dressed up in a nice sweater and jeans (I totally thought he would be wearing a t-shirt/casual clothes) for this ‚Äúnot-date.‚Äù He proceeded to ask if we should go outside, to which I agreed because I assumed he just wanted to use the outdoor seating because it was nice out. Little did I know we would end up spending *five hours* walking around town and talking about absolutely everything under the sun. We found out we have tons of things in common‚Äî shared values, interests, friends, hobbies, etc. etc. We even made a Spotify Blend per my request, and our music taste is like 91% compatible. Everything was closed (Sundays in a small town, iykyk) so we literally just WALKED. It was amazing and went better than I could have ever imagined. He kept trying to impress me and asked questions about my plans for college, where I wanted to travel, and tons of other stuff. We talked about music and poetry and books. It was straight out of a cheesy rom-com. He even bought me ice cream because he was so excited to see that the shop was even open that day. He wanted to spend time with me and only me, going out of his way to steer away from crowds and not stay inside the ice cream shop so we could sit alone in a cute little corner outside.
The hang out ended because he had somewhere to be (that he was almost late to, to be honest) and I said we should hang out again, joking that we needed to go on a day where the shops were actually open. He agreed and said he didn‚Äôt have work that upcoming Saturday. We didn‚Äôt officially make an actual plan because he had to leave, but I assumed I could talk to him about it later. A couple days go by and he doesn‚Äôt seem to be following up at school. I chatted with him in the halls once or twice, even asked if he wanted to get lunch sometime to which he responded a vague answer about how he was busy. I didn‚Äôt care because it was exam week so that made complete sense. He also mentioned that Saturday wouldn‚Äôt actually work anymore because again, he ‚Äúhad something else pop up.‚Äù We aren‚Äôt that close‚Äî barely even friends, really‚Äî so I understand why he wouldn‚Äôt tell me every detail about what‚Äôs going on. But I waited. I waited and waited and opened it up to him over text that ‚Äúif he wanted to hang out again, to let me know,‚Äù and he responded six hours after I sent the text by saying that he ‚Äútotally would‚Äù and was excited to go to a place I mentioned we should check out. And here I am, three weeks later, and we haven‚Äôt hung out a single time since then. We saw each other at a graduation party and chatted about a movie I watched that he recommended, but that was it. I‚Äôm just really confused and want some perspective on this, especially from a guy. Is there something I‚Äôm missing?

Tasting notes are rosehip, fruity, and chestnut. Petra describes it as a balance between delicate floral and warm nutty tones, and I definitely get that.

My initial impression: it‚Äôs a nice, fruity cup with a cozy chestnut warmth that really compliments the fruitiness. I love that interplay - almost jammy without being too sweet. But the cup feels a bit muddled and I keep wishing for more clarity. There‚Äôs depth, but not the crisp definition I‚Äôd hoped.

I‚Äôve been brewing it using Tetsu‚Äôs 4:6 method, with my Timemore C3S at 23 clicks. 

Has anyone brewed this roast (or similar profile) and found a method that helped dial in clarity? Would love to hear if you‚Äôve had more luck or suggestions.

Also - side note - Istanbul‚Äôs specialty coffee scene really surprised me. I expected it to be more centered around traditional Turkish coffee (which is, of course, still everywhere), but there‚Äôs a thriving third wave community with roasters like Petra, Meet Laab Coffee, Montag, Null, and Kronotrop.

I know Reddit isn‚Äôt exactly known for great or long-term connections, but hey, figured I‚Äôd put this out there for anyone looking for something a bit more real than the swipe fatigue.

I‚Äôm 28, based in the UK, and no, I don‚Äôt actually go around saying, 'right, what‚Äôs all this then?' If that joke or meme is a mystery to you, feel free to ignore my nonsense lol. I‚Äôm not expecting instant replies, life happens, but it‚Äôd be nice to find something that flows. Something you actually look forward to. Rare, but not impossible.

I‚Äôm a massive fiction nerd. After work, all I want is to disappear into another world with a good book. I keep telling myself I‚Äôll get back into reading history, but so far it‚Äôs mostly just Sabaton keeping the dream alive. I‚Äôm seeing them live later this year, which is proof I still love history, even if it‚Äôs in a slightly unconventional way. Definitely better than abandoning it altogether, even if uni tried its best to crush my soul with an enormous reading list. Spoiler: I never followed it. This is me, master of excuses and self-justifications. üòÄ If you‚Äôre into bands with historical flair or just like great live music, I‚Äôd definitely recommend them.

Currently reading a bit of a guilty pleasure genre. Still fun though. You can ask what it is if you‚Äôre feeling brave. Or guess. Bonus points if you‚Äôve got your own guilty pleasure read, or watch, or playlist to swap.

I‚Äôve also caught the running bug. Help! Got into it on a whim, became even more obsessed after my first race, and now I‚Äôm deep in the running cult. Minus the influencer energy. I‚Äôm not above posting my Strava stats on Insta, but I‚Äôm definitely not cool enough for the curated fitness reel life. The meditative state during a good run, the post-race high, and a good coffee or pint after, all part of the running cult I happily subscribe to.

As a self-confessed member of said cult, I feel like you should reciprocate the baring of my soul. What cult are you part of? ü§£

Now that I‚Äôve rambled like I‚Äôm overly caffeinated, (cough cough,) I am, it‚Äôs only fair you tell me about yourself. What‚Äôs your thing? What‚Äôs the hobby or obsession you‚Äôd like me to get into?

Honestly, I just enjoy getting to know people. The deep stuff, the dumb stuff, all the in-between. I‚Äôm into tangents, chats that spiral in the best way, and before you know it, we've landed somewhere unexpectedly lovely. For me, amazing conversations are when we forget about time, doesn't matter whether it's serious or lighthearted, the next thing we know, it's been hours. Basically, the kind of connection that actually feels like something worth seeing through, and hopefully sparks fly. I‚Äôm open to wherever it goes, as long as it‚Äôs real.

Got a book that‚Äôll hit me in the best way? A running tip that doesn‚Äôt involve buying yet another pair of shoes? I‚Äôm listening.

When I first got the machine, I changed the inner burr to a three as instructed by a very popular YouTube channel Ethan Rode. Then I followed the dialing in process by the roast roaster for this specific machine. Immediately I was having two fine of espresso, so it was not flowing properly. I kind of expected this because the default ininner burr size is not what the YouTube video showed. I then adjusted the outer grind size on the wheel outside the machine and I changed it all the way down to a nine, which is very fast extraction but still know good shot. I then defaulted the inner bur size back to a five and now all is going wrong. Now the grinder is grinding too much coffee into the porter filter and I can‚Äôt even use the assisted tamp for it to recognize how much is in the porter filter. Any help is appreciated as I‚Äôm getting a little frustrated at how hard it is to dial-in espresso when you have an assisted temp and an automatic dosing.

I [F 31] have been with my partner [M 30] for just short of a year, but we have known eachother and run in the same circles since secondary/high school. Everything has been great, he really is a wonderful partner and we are looking forward to a big future together.

The issue is that I am becoming increasingly jealous and insecure about his relationship with a friend [M 30]. They see eachother very regularly, talk every day, and the friend is in a very well paying job, which for example has meant that my partner was gifted expensive concert tickets by the friend, and when my partner recently was awarded a more desirable position at work, the friend took him out for dinner. 

None of this is necessarily problematic - I‚Äôm happy that he has a great friend and someone who celebrates him as he really deserves it. The issues lie very much with me and my own insecurities. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs because, whilst I have great friendships, there is no ‚Äòfinancial‚Äô aspect (e.g. if we give gifts, which we generally don‚Äôt, there will be a set budget and treats may be a coffee etc) so maybe it‚Äôs that I find this more ‚Äòlavish‚Äô friendship a bit odd? But also I myself am not in a position to be able to spoil him as much as I would like. So for example, I also purchased concert tickets for his favourite artist for his birthday, but they were very expensive and I worked a lot of overtime to be able to afford this. So these lavish things do feel somewhat strange to me, but I find that they sting too because it almost takes away some of the specialness of something I had to work really hard for. I hope this makes sense!

I have never been the jealous type, and really value the relationship, but these things are starting to bother me regularly and I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs worth bringing up with my partner or if that is just self-entitled and ridiculous ü´£ I wouldn‚Äôt dream of telling him not to have this friend for example!!

Over the past few months, I‚Äôve been working on a budgeting app called **BudgetLog** ‚Äì a minimalist expense tracker designed to stay out of your way, respect your data, and actually be useful in day-to-day life.

Like many people, I‚Äôve tried (and abandoned) a bunch of finance apps. Too many were overcomplicated, ad-driven, or borderline invasive when it comes to data. So I decided to build something simple for myself‚Ä¶ and it grew from there.

**Key features:**

* üì∏ **Scan receipts** using on-device machine learning ‚Äî all processed locally on your iPhone
* üåç **Multi-currency support** ‚Äì log expenses in any currency, BudgetLog converts it automatically
* üîê **Privacy-first** ‚Äì no tracking, everything stays on your device and in your private iCloud account

It‚Äôs currently in soft launch and I‚Äôm still refining things ‚Äî UI, onboarding, feature flow, pricing model, etc.  
Right now I‚Äôm using a subscription model to unlock premium features (like scanning), but making sure the free version remains functional and clean.

If you‚Äôre into finance tools, UX simplicity, or just have opinions on how *budgeting apps should feel*, I‚Äôd really appreciate your feedback üôå

My focus is on **immersion + output + smart spaced repetition.** So i wont be going deep into intense grammar learning and structure . I‚Äôm sharing it here to get your **opinions, suggestions, or any improvements** you‚Äôd make. Maybe it helps someone else too!

# My Weekly French Learning Plan

*  **Daily Anki** ‚Äì Flashcard reviews with full sentences + audio. 10‚Äì20 cards max to avoid burnout.
* **Alternating Busuu & Easy French**:

   * **Busuu** (Mon, Wed, Fri): Grammar, vocab, dialogues, speaking/writing exercises with native corrections. You could also swap **Busuu** with **Coffee Break French** if you prefer a podcast-style approach that also has a structured learning style. I‚Äôm not using traditional books because Busuu (or Coffee Break French) already gives me plenty of structured grammar and usage lessons. 
   * **Easy French** (Tue, Thu):  YouTube channel with real conversations and subtitles. Watch street interviews, pick out expressions, shadow native speakers, add to Anki.
* **Weekend Movie (Sat/Sun)**: Watch a French movie or show (split over 2 days), note down expressions, rewatch scenes, and review vocab. You can either **LingoPie** or **Dual Subtitle.** I dont think Dual Subtitle works anymore though with the new Youtube change. For the movie selections I have done a lot of research and come up these
   * **A1 ‚Äì Absolute Beginner**
      * Peppa Pig (French Dub)
      * Mouk
      * Trotro
      * Extra French
      * Le Petit Nicolas (2009)
   * **A2 ‚Äì Elementary**
      * Ast√©rix et Ob√©lix (any)
      * Les Choristes
      * Zazie dans le m√©tro
      * Petit Ours Brun
      * Un Gars, Une Fille
   * **B1 ‚Äì Intermediate**
      * Call My Agent! (Dix pour cent)
      * Intouchables
      * La Famille B√©lier
      * Les Aventures de Tintin
      * C‚Äôest Pas Sorcier
   * **B2 ‚Äì Upper Intermediate**
      * Lupin
      * Les Revenants
      * Am√©lie
      * La Haine
      * Camille redouble
   * **C1 ‚Äì Advanced**
      * Le Bureau des L√©gendes

      * La Vie d‚ÄôAd√®le
      * Engrenages (Spiral)
      * Platane (Eric Judor)

**The Extra thing i would also be doing**:

* **Record Myself (1x/week)**: Talk about your week or summarize something you learned.
* **French Journal (1x/week)**: Write a diary entry or a review of a movie/video in French.
* **Using either HelloTalk / Tandem (Biweekly)**: Chat with a native speaker (text/audio), ask about expressions, exchange language.",2,1748790312.0,learnfrench,1,1.0,False

At first, I didn‚Äôt think anything of it‚Äîpublic space, whatever.

But then he started making small comments. Things like, ‚ÄúYou look real focused, sweetheart‚Äù and ‚ÄúHard work pays off, darling.‚Äù The first time, I kind of forced a polite smile. The second time, I said, ‚ÄúHey, I‚Äôd prefer not to be called that. Thanks.‚Äù

He laughed it off like I was joking and kept doing it.

After the third or fourth time, I finally snapped and said (not yelling, but firmly), ‚ÄúStop calling me that. It's condescending and weird.‚Äù He got all huffy, told me I was being ‚Äútoo sensitive‚Äù and ‚Äúnot everything is harassment,‚Äù and then loudly said, ‚ÄúWow, no wonder young people are so angry these days.‚Äù

Now here‚Äôs the thing‚ÄîI could feel people staring, and I left soon after because I felt uncomfortable. But when I told my roommate, she said I might have overreacted and embarrassed the guy in public when I could‚Äôve just ignored it.

For context, I'm 22 and in uni studying physics. I had a huge glow-up during my last relationship (that ended half a year ago), I lost weight and I'm incredibly happy with how I look like now and how my personality has developed.   
I can also carry every conversation, I play video games, I'm a great cook, I can draw very well and I just love making people happy. 

Me and the guy I'm interested in share a lot of spaces in uni and I feel like we vibe really well, but we havent really talked one on one yet outside of uni, I did notice him actively listening to me and smiling while I was talking to someone else as he sat across the small room and peaked over which was adorable. I have the hope that he thinks I'm cute but doesnt want to approach out of fear of getting rejected. (but before doing anything I of course would inquire the information if he's already dating someone or not)

That gave her the impetus to write that SGI leaders often take credit for the hard work and accomplishments of members.

Nice theory, but anyone actually familiar with and close to the SGI knows that the opposite is more likely true. After all, the *member* is the one asked to share the experience at meetings ‚Äì not their leader.

And that‚Äôs not the only statement that any SGI member unsullied by hate will see right through.

She writes: ‚Äú*SGI defenders love to claim ""There's nothing 'magic' about it - it's all about focusing your energy toward your goals"" or some such twaddle, even though Ikeda himself described the nohonzon as ""Aladdin's Lamp"" (which is magic) and SGI members/leaders/publications frequently refer to chanting in terms of ""a wish-granting jewel"". It's RIGHT THERE IN THE OPEN*.‚Äù

Gosh, it would have been so cool if she had studied a little.¬† Those who have understand what the analogies mean: by practicing, one can achieve one‚Äôs goals. ***NOT*** ‚Äúthe Buddha will snap his fingers and you‚Äôll get something with no effort‚Äù.

Then, when the old, old story relates that people got together informally to chant, she says: ‚ÄúIn the >20 years since that ‚Üë was written, SGI has really cracked down on this sort of ""unsanctioned meeting"". SGI wants to control *everything* the SGI members are exposed to.‚Äù (The source she links to to confirm this is ‚Äì *herself*, saying it once before!)

This one‚Äôs just funny, since SGI-USA gas long been encouraging get togethers and meet-ups at homes, coffee shops, restaurants (people in my district have done this about 100 times the last few years).

So, Ms. Blue Tail/Fish Wife/Big Toe. Blanche ‚Äì maybe talk to a real member once in a while, and study Nichiren Buddhism, instead of sitting in your office deciding what *must* be going on in the outside, real world. Not trying to tell you what to do ‚Äì just a suggestion to improve your relationship with reality.

In another post, she does herself, sgiwhistleblowers, and the entire human race proud. She vilifies the late Ted Osaki for appointing an ‚Äúunqualified‚Äù person to lead the bras band.

* ¬†She says Mr. Osaki was a ‚Äúnative Japanese‚Äù (He was born in Sacamento, California).
* She implies a member whose last name was ‚ÄúFake‚Äù was made up for the story (John Fake was a long time member in Washington D.C.)
* She implies that, because it was years ago and can‚Äôt be verified, the entire story of the brass band is fiction (golly, I wonder of the Roman Empire really existed ‚Äì I certainly don‚Äôt remember any such thing).

¬†And oh yeah ‚Äì Mr. Osaki was absolutely right, and the ‚Äúunqualified‚Äù young man he appointed developed a tremendous brass band.

**Macole‚Äôs POV**¬†

After a rather quiet ride I could start to see the outline of GrianBurrow. A place that had come to be like a second home, filled to the brim with friendly people and lovely places to shop and just enjoy life. Or at least it was until, like, a couple of months ago. After that ‚Äúearthquake,‚Äù that being what the news outlets called it, although I‚Äôm sure I wasn‚Äôt the only person that didn‚Äôt believe that. Regardless, this place was hit hard just like the three other towns to the west of here. Once we were right outside of the town's outskirts the ruined and collapsed buildings started to come into view.¬†

And not just the buildings but the people who once called some of those piles of bricks home. Many of them were wearing torn and tattered covered in everything from blood, dirt, and who knows what else. They had faces seemingly permanently stained with sorrow and at times it felt like it even affected any and everything from the weather or the food. As a result of all of that and more, I try to avoid having to come here whenever we need something that can‚Äôt be found in the forest or made at the church. Hopefully this will be my last time having to come here for awhile but then again I probably shouldn‚Äôt hold my breath.¬†

Out of the corner of my eye I checked to see how Luka was doing. Her attention, for the most part from what I could guess was looking at some of the temporary emergency centers set up around the edge of town. Following her gaze I saw some most likely overworked medics that were taking a smoke break and others trying to calm down some hysterical folks probably asking about their loved ones. But after one of the towns folks slapped one of the medics both Luka and I quickly looked away.¬†

As we finally entered the town proper I started following my usual route to one of my favorite places to get something to eat. That being The Fire Mountune Kitchen, my jaws watering at just mentioning it in my brain, but unfortunately I doubt I would be able to get any of my faves right now, not with everything the way it is now. As we snaked through the parts of the road that were still safe to use, we found a small restaurant that was a glass box that used to have a big neon sign. It also used to have a lot more windows too but then again when a town collapses over night and the people get a little too rowdy I guess it isn‚Äôt impossible that some of them would stoop to vandalism. I just wish it wasn't my favorite place.¬†

¬†‚ÄúHey Luka question: do you have a way of contacting Frued?‚Äù I asked as we pulled into what was left of the parking lot, making sure to keep the bike running‚Ä¶ just in case.¬†

She took a few seconds to respond, her head snapping up and turning to me. ‚ÄúOh! Yeah yeah. Um where are we?‚Äù She asked as she started to fidget with one of her ears.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre at The Fire Mountune Kitchen. It should be pretty easy to find. After all, it's the only FMK in this place and one of the only restaurants that is still standing and somewhat functional. But also while we‚Äôre here do you want something to eat while we wait for him?‚Äù

‚ÄúUm‚Ä¶ sure just let me shoot that info over to Freud.‚Äù Luka said as she pressed something in her ear and started to repeat what I said, probably to Freud. Once she was done, she jumped out of the sidecar before I could turn off my bike. ‚ÄúHey do you mind if you could pay? I wasn‚Äôt really expecting to go out to eat right after that whole‚Ä¶ thing‚Ä¶‚Äù She said apologetically.¬†

I made sure to chain up the bike, taking a quick glance to make sure that we weren‚Äôt being watched or followed. ‚ÄúSure but for my sake please be mindful of the price. I don't have much money myself.‚Äù I said with a little chuckle. She laughed a little at that nodding her head as she started walking to the door.¬†

When we walked in, we were greeted with the smell of grilled meats and fruits, and if I wasn‚Äôt mistaken, a bit of alcohol? They still had alcohol? Well maybe if I had some money left over after Luka left maybe the head priestess wouldn‚Äôt mind if I had a few sips before coming back. The diner‚Äôs interior was composed of booths to the left and right of the main grill/kitchen that allowed you to watch and even talk to the chefs as they cooked your food, which was something I quite liked. Looking up you could see a few ceiling lights that looked like they might fall off if you kicked the wall in the wrong place. But to be honest I was surprised by how clean the whole place looked. For a relatively small restaurant nestled between the ruined collapsed remains of buildings didn‚Äôt look too worse for wear. Although there were some things here and there, broken glass, some graffiti that had yet to be washed off, and some garbage bags that, if I had to guess, were food that had gone bad.¬†

‚ÄúGood morning! You two can go ahead and pick wherever you would like to sit. We'll be with you in a moment.‚Äù Came the bubbly voice of one of the bussers who was whipping down one of the tables. We did as she suggested walking over to the cleanest booth that allowed us to see the road so it would be easier to see when Freud arrived.¬†

Luka eagerly snatched up one of the menus and started skimming through it to try and find something that they could still serve while also hopefully being mindful that I wasn‚Äôt flush with cash‚Ä¶

**Freud‚Äôs POV An hour later‚Ä¶**¬†

It took me a little longer than I would have liked but I did eventually find the little diner that Luka had told me I could find her at. It was more or less sandwiched between half a block of broken buildings. Honestly it feels like a miracle that it was still standing. But honestly I could go for something to eat but of course I left my money at home after all it wasn‚Äôt like I was planning on going out for a victory meal as soon as the mission was over. As I got closer I could make out Luka‚Äôs silhouette from one of the windows that faced the road. It looked like she and Macole were having a rather animated conversation with someone else I couldn‚Äôt see from here. But most importantly it looked like Ethan wasn‚Äôt with them so I hope that means that she was able to dump him off with Macole and his people.¬†

As I entered the small eatery, I allowed myself to enjoy the aromas of breakfast being cooked on the stoves in the middle of the restaurant. Even though it was just about mid day, besides Luka and Macole there were only three other customers. Two of them looked to be a couple¬† and the third one was sitting by themselves looking down into their coffee, dejected which was par for the course considering the state of this place.¬†

After a few moments Luka shot up in her seat waving me over Macole turning around and giving a casual wave as well. I walked over to them Luka scooting over further into the booth to let me sit with them. ‚ÄúSure took you long enough. What was keeping you?‚Äù Luka asked, nudging me with her elbow.¬†

‚ÄúI decided to kill some time by mopping up any stragglers that wandered out of the nest and by the time you called me I was a ways into the forest. So it took me a bit to regain my bearings. And have you seen outside? This town was already a nightmare to navigate before now it‚Äôs almost impossible.‚Äù I said, allowing my disdain for how poorly laid out this city was.¬†

‚ÄúI won‚Äôt argue with you on that front. But it could be worse. Have you ever been to Gagolaine? That place feels more like a giant art piece rather than a city real people live in. This place even after it collapsed is still ten times more navigatebale than there.‚Äù Macole said while waving over a waiter. He asked for the bill taking a moment to look at it sighing heavily before pulling out his ragged and worn wallet paying it.¬†

‚ÄúSince you two have already eaten, do you mind if we continue this outside?‚Äù I asked giving a side-eye to the other patterns and the workers. They took a second to catch on but quickly nodded, getting up and following me out. As we left Macole walked over to a bike I had noticed parked out front and wheeling it along with us.¬†

‚ÄúWell now that you‚Äôre here, what is the plan?‚Äù Luka asked as we walked out of the parking lot, or what was left of it.¬†

‚ÄúHead back to base. Nox says that the captain is there and a little pissed from the sounds of it. I already called the others so they should be on their way to pick us up. Soooo‚Ä¶ for right now we find somewhere comfortable and wait. But before that I‚Äôve noticed that Ethan isn‚Äôt with you so can I assume that you are allowing him to stay with you?‚Äù I asked looking over at Macole.¬†

‚ÄúYes. The head priestess has agreed to let him stay with us. Luka can even come back to visit him later.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúWell that‚Äôs good. At least that‚Äôs one less thing that we need to worry about. If you want Macole you can take your leave if you want. The others will arrive in‚Ä¶ about half an hour or so.‚Äù I said while holding out my paw for a handshake.¬†

Malcoe took a pause looking down at my paw before taking it. ‚ÄúYeah I guess I can. I think there are some things I can get to doing while I‚Äôm here. So I think I‚Äôm going to hang around for a bit longer. Hey luka if you want to come visit Ethan this we could make this place the meetup spot if you want.‚Äù Macole offered Luka egarily nod at Macole‚Äôs offer.

‚ÄúIf that‚Äôs all then come on Luka we might as well start heading for the pickup spot. I suppose we will see each other again at some point, take care Macole.‚Äù I said, and with that we went our separate ways for now‚Ä¶

**Sometime later back at base, Luka‚Äôs POV‚Ä¶**

After we parted ways with Macole Freud led me to a more populated area that seemed to act as a sort of town square. Some tents were set up giving out some kind of soup, clothes, and some other essentials. There even seemed to be a medical tent too, with people coming in and out and others standing around outside seeming to be waiting on news of how their loved ones were doing.¬†

Freud moved towards the entrance of this little gathering spot looking around with a crestfallen look. Then he sighed deeply, shaking his head and closing his eyes while sitting down on some of the nearby rubble. ‚ÄúWhen we were kids my aunt would sometimes take me and my brother and our cousin out here and let us run around and play with the local kids. I‚Äôm pretty sure this was where a store that sold one of my favorite kinds of candy was. And now.‚Äù He paused gesturing to a rather colorful pile of bricks.¬†

‚ÄúOh‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm so sorry. Are‚Ä¶ are you okay?‚Äù I asked.¬†

Freud shrugged. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to say sorry it‚Äôs not your fault. And if I‚Äôm okay? No, not really. The last few months have become a rollercoaster that I‚Äôve wanted off of for a while now. And to make things worse, we had that‚Ä¶ thing with you know who.‚Äù He said, opening one of his eyes to look around to make sure no one was listening in. ‚ÄúHonestly I just want to fall asleep and not make up until a year from now.‚Äù Freud said with an exaggerated sigh and slightly deflating.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt blame you, I could go for a month long coma nap myself. But on a different note, how long before we get picked up? I really don‚Äôt want to keep the captain waiting longer than we have to. If we‚Äôre going to get yelled at, I would like to get it over with sooner rather than putting it off for later.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúIf you knew the captain like I do then no. You would rather try to put it off for as long as we can and hope that she loses interest in chewing us out.‚Äù He said with a short dark chuckle. But right after I had asked, I saw a heavily armored truck pull up and honk, making more than a few people turn their heads.¬†

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs our ride let‚Äôs go luka.‚Äù Freud said as he got up dusting himself off and hopping into the armored truck. I quickly followed after him, jumping inside and being greeted by Nox, who had come to pick us up in what I assume must have been the only working car we had left. That being a heavily armored truck that seemed to scare as many people as it uneased. The interior was like that of some of the transport shuttles I had ridden in back during training. Several seats facing each other and some kooks on the wall along with some closets that held weapons or were supposed to.¬†

The ride back to base was a quiet but nice one so nice in fact that I could start feeling my grip on wakefulness begin to weaken. Soon I felt my everything become heavy as sleep finally took hold. Looks like I was more tired than I thought. then again I‚Äôve been up since like, what? Four five in the morning yeah I think I‚Äôve earned a nap I‚Äôm sure nothing crazy will happen while I doze off‚Ä¶",3,1748789898.0,HFY,3,1.0,False

How do you order coffee there? 

I only drink double shot mochas (yes, I know, it‚Äôs stupid, I‚Äôm a child, etc.). I just know what I like and can‚Äôt help it. 

From what I‚Äôve seen looking at cafe menus, there are no flavors to add to the coffee there? Is Spain a more coffee-purist culture? No vanilla, chocolate, cinnamon, etc. to add available? Do they add sugar? 

I‚Äôd just hate to walk into a cafe and ask for something only realistically available in a Starbucks. I‚Äôm from the US, but aware of the negative sentiment towards tourism in Barcelona, and want to be as sensitive as possible to any existing traditions.

So my brother was physically and mentally abused by my parents when he was a child and I know how bad that is but he built himself up, got a good job and is very very well settled Masha Allah, he gives all the credit to his friends who helped him through his bad times and he just appreciates them a lot. All in all which isn‚Äôt a bad thing but 
It has made him arrogant.
Arrogant to the point that he indirectly looks down upon his own sibling who doesn‚Äôt earn that well, he refuses to meet ANY Relative close or far because they‚Äôre toxic and I get his reason to do so and I know for a fact that all the sophisticated elders in this community would think he‚Äôs right here and in a way he is, but he is very rude to our mother for treating her in-laws good and I admit my mother is partly at fault too sometimes but she also went through so much trauma and he doesn‚Äôt get it. He‚Äôs unnecessarily rude and sometimes his point of views are just useless. I know this sounds in favour but I can‚Äôt provide much context here.
He has this general idea about teenage girls as ‚Äúwannabes, show offs, loud and annoying‚Äù etc and he labels me in that category too.
He works from home and barely spends an hour with me in a day or sometimes maybe even less and he says I stay in my room too much and calls it a ‚Äúhostel‚Äù when he himself doesn‚Äôt even spend that much time with the family either and just uses the I work etc etc excuse.
He calls my English accent fake, forced and wannabe when in fact I‚Äôve studied ten years in a school where we were properly taught the British and American pronunciation of words just for our accents to get better and now he labels me fake? I do debates, read a lot and write a lot too and after knowing all of that he just has this ‚Äúidea‚Äù that everything I do is fake and for show off.
He has a problem with my girly etiquettes like wtf do you want me to act like?
He has a problem with me getting cute and girly stuff because he thinks I do it to look cool and again ‚Äúshow off‚Äù among my friends and not just because I like them? The other day he had issues with my glass coffee cup and said that they‚Äôre used in restaurants and you use it (inside the house) to somehow look cool? And when I argue with him, he shuts me up with a supposed smart statement and acts all happy and thinks that he achieved something and goes like ‚Äúoh tumhari to sarr gayi hahahaha‚Äù like okay‚Ä¶.
And then I‚Äôm expected not to say too much because that ALSO puts the rude and badtameez label on me.
He has a problem with what I eat and not for the sake of looking out for me and  calls me whitewashed and burger when I‚Äôm probably the most desi person in my entire friend group.
He has a problem with me watching Pakistani dramas because they teach me bad things when I only watch it for time pass and he sees me as a 2 year old who can be brainwashed by some random ahh anti hitting her bahu? 
He thinks I‚Äôm becoming a feminist and a man hater and am learning wrong things when HE DOES NOT EVEN KNOW MY BELIEFS AND OPINIONS PROPERLY!?!? He‚Äôs just so fast and quick to make a statement about it. 
Then the fact about how he was treated badly, he thinks I‚Äôm so pampered when he doesn‚Äôt even know a shit about the mental trauma I go through in my own house? Just because my parents don‚Äôt hit me, he thinks I‚Äôm raised soo good, like the other day when we were discussing something of this topic he goes like ‚Äútum kahan fix ho jati ho har jaga? Tumhe to kuch pata hi nai hay‚Äù like ok dude if you as much as knew your sister 1 percent or stayed with her a little more you‚Äôd know the shit that happens in your own house. 
And it‚Äôs crazy how my brother thinks he knows everything but in fact he doesn‚Äôt even know anything about me and is just entitled to have a say about everything I do, the opinions I have and the things I do. As much as it hurts me to say this, I‚Äôve started to hate my brother deep down and I DONT want to do that.

A kiss between earth and fire, a black sun captured in a cup.
It begins before the tongue.
It begins in the breath.
The aroma: thick as sin,
sweet as the memory of a forbidden lover,
bitter as the truth that undresses you in silence.
It climbs the nose like jasmine wrapped in tobacco smoke,
like warm bread baked in the belly of an ancient, fragrant mountain. Covered in pine
In the cup, it does not sit.
It broods.
Dark as oil, lustrous as a raven‚Äôs wing caught in golden morning,
its surface quivers like the lip of someone holding back
a thousand poems.
You lift it. It waits.
You sip.
And then‚Äî
Time breaks.
Walls fall.
History evaporates.
The liquid enters like an opera sung directly to your blood.
It does not ask permission.
It seizes you.
Velvet thunder.
Molten mahogany.
A plunge into something older than language‚Äî
spiced soil, monsoon nights, smoke-drenched taverns in cities that no longer exist.
It coils around your tongue,
sings in your nerves,
then bursts into your chest like the first breath after drowning.
O you who once said, ‚ÄúI do not like coffee‚Äù‚Äî
Did you ever really drink it?
Did you ever let it touch you, truly touch you,
with its orchestra of shadows and heat,
its taste of distance and longing,
its nectar of crushed stars and sorrow made gold?
No. You tasted liquid. Not this.
This is prayer in a porcelain mouth.
This is the moment the gods regret making nectar for themselves alone.
This is love in its bitter truth, its fire and velvet, its burn and bloom.
So drink.
Let it unmake you.
Let it reassemble you, dark and trembling,
with the sacred shiver of one who has just remembered
what it means to be alive.

Figuring out how to live life awake at 6am everyday instead of dragging myself out to walk the dog around 10am. Half stumbling through life, I'd been off and on for awhile. Tried moderation, I'd just start earlier and go to sleep earlier. I always had a drink in my hand. It was a reward for my day and it felt good..until it didn't. 

Earlier this year, I caught a horrible flu and was in bed for almost a week. I went through that plus withdraw at the same time and figured why not give it a go for real. Not a fan of rules or religion, groups didn't really work for me. I've been in therapy for years, but finding this group kinda opened up a lot other doors. I suggested it to my therapists as another option to provide to their patients. This group is really special. 

All of the stories you read here about recovery are true. My mental state was a fucking wreck. I felt like shit each morning. Clarity was non existent. Paranoid for no reason. You know what I wasn't ready for? My heart readings. I've started tracking my sleep with my watch since I'm sleeping well. My resting heartbeat has lowered 10bpm. 

Everyone has the same goal and it helps me to hear all of the different perspectives of this shared experience. I've been going to punk shows for most of my life. Drinking is huge in punk culture. It's the reason Liquid Death even exists..

With my newly found spending money, I've been super frugal about everything. I have been buying more merch from bands and decided to subscribe to my favorite magazine, [Razorcake](http://www.razorcake.org). One of the features of my first issue is 'One Punk's Guide to Exploring Punk's Relationship with Alcohol'. I've heard people talk about signs. This was definitely one. 

A really well written intro to sobriety without judgement. Relatable to anyone, but especially people who would be reading this magazine in the first place. Halfway through, the writer mentions r/stopdrinking as a source that has helped re-enforce their resolve. Just mind blowing!

One thing I'd like to share that has helped me is not keeping track of time. I know around when I quit drinking, but I don't care about dates. If I do end up drinking, I know I'm gonna feel like shit for the next few days, so is that worth it? I smoke weed and probably always will, but I've also started microdosing. I can buy it legally here and take a little with my morning coffee. That is a whole other topic, but as someone who has been depressed most of their life, I finally can see without that constant cloud. It's been life changing. 

Another one is Jonny Pops! Healthy-ish popsickles that hit that sugar and reward craving. Fruit juice or soda instead of beer is been clutch as well.

## FAQs Section

Here are some frequently asked questions regarding anniversary gifts for husbands to help you make informed decisions.

**What is the ideal price range for an anniversary gift?**

The ideal price range varies depending on your financial situation and the significance of the anniversary year. There is no specific rule, but it's generally wise to set a budget and adhere to it. Focus on the thoughtfulness of the gift, rather than its price tag. A heartfelt, inexpensive gift can frequently enough be more meaningful than a lavish, impersonal one.

**How far in advance should I start planning and shopping for an anniversary gift?**

Ideally, begin planning and shopping at least a month in advance. This allows ample time to research options, compare prices, and personalize the gift if necessary. For custom-made or engraved items, allow even more lead time to ensure it's ready by the anniversary date. Starting early reduces stress and prevents last-minute scrambling.

**What if my husband is difficult to shop for and doesn't express specific desires?**

If your husband is hard to shop for, observe his daily routines, hobbies, and interests closely. Pay attention to any subtle hints he may drop or items he frequently uses. Consider a gift that enhances his existing passions or introduces him to a new hobby he might enjoy. Alternatively, an experiential gift provides an opportunity for shared adventure and doesn't require him to express specific desires.

**Are subscription boxes a good anniversary gift option?**

Oggi ad Amsterdam √® successo un fatto grottesco e straordinario. Un enorme Cigno, di quelli che trovi appollaiati nei canali in bucolici fermoimmagine da cartolina, √® stato investito nella Centraalplein. Il suo corpo piumato e diviso in due parti, collegate tra loro da una poltiglia rosa di frattaglie. Il nobile collo ripiegato su se stesso, gli spaventosi occhi da dinosauro strabuzzati.

Lo fisso e non riesco a distogliere lo sguardo.

\-Non so come dirtelo, ma credo sia morto-

Osserva Peter punzecchiando il becco della bestia con la punta della scarpa.

Sar√† per l'insolito spettacolo o per il cielo luminoso e carico di nubi argentate, ma questa giornata sembra iniziata sotto il segno di una strana stella.

Io e l'arguto amico siamo usciti per il consueto rond√≤ domenicale in citt√†. Essendo ancora bassa stagione Amsterdam √® ancora godibile per una passeggiata in spensieratezza. La scorsa domenica passata dai Verklaaren mi ha lasciato in uno stato d'agitazione e il lavoro settimanale √® stato gravido di impegni e incombenze, senza contare lo sforzo di evitare lo sguardo del Professore per paura di venire trascinata in qualche discorso spiacevole.

""Dunque insidi mia figlia e poi la abbandoni sola e sperduta sotto San Jacub?"". Difficile immaginare che Rose possa essersi lamentata di me; uno scenario del genere rimane comunque terrificante per le mie meningi gi√† provate dagli antidepressivi e i regolatori dell'umore. La gita in citt√† con il buon compagno Peter volge dunque all'insegna della spensieratezza e soprattutto dell'alterazione dei sensi. Non c'√® miglior citt√† al mondo per fingere la frivolezza senza finire in guai seri o rigida in una pozza di bava epilettica sul sedile di una volante della polizia. Amsterdam √® la citt√† dove tutto √® permesso ma dove tutto √® calibrato per funzionare nel disordine.

Costeggiamo i binari lungo la Prins Hendrikkade e imbocchiamo il viale del Singel, popolato dal solito andirivieni di gente.

\-che ore sono?-

Chiedo indagando l'imperscrutabile cielo.

\-le 2.40-

Risponde secco Peter.

Entriamo nel CoffeeShop che si affaccia sulla cupola della Koepelkerk: dentro al locale, sugli sgabelli di metallo, stanno stravaccati i turisti con gli occhi rossi e la pelle pallida, gli sguardi spenti come gli avventori delle fumerie d'oppio. Noi invece, dopo aver ordinato due grosse fette di torta di mele, ci sediamo ai tavolini all'aperto per goderci l'aria frizzante sul canale. In pochi gesti le erbe sono sminuzzate e mescolate con la marijuana, poi il misto viene rollato nella cartina di gomma arabica.

Sono stanca, ma non agitata. Non c'√® la solita opprimente ansia a pesarmi sul cuore, provo solo la sana voglia di evadere da una routine che puzza di stantio.

Peter non parla molto, ma anche lui ha l'aria stanca e spesso si massaggia gli occhi dopo aver alzato gli occhiali sulla fronte. Non ho mai capito bene in cosa consista il suo lavoro, ma sembra qualcosa di tutto rispetto che ha a che fare con l'ingegneria.

Mangiamo la torta e mi sorprendo ad avere un certo appetito, poi accendiamo il nostro agognato spinello passandocelo con rispettoso cameratismo.

In pochi minuti passiamo da un discorso all'altro parlando di ogni cosa:

""Scrivi ancora quella cosa?""

""Vedi ancora quella ragazza?""

""Quanto √® questo mese di gas e luce? Le rate della macchina?""

Nessuno ascolta veramente le risposte dell'altro, ma √® chiaro il bisogno di compagnia e il senso di solitudine e disorientamento che proviamo entrambi in quanto giovani adulti.

Fatichiamo a concepire il costo e le conseguenze di ogni cosa, il valore dei soldi, del tempo e della vita. Nei nostri occhi di bambini sperduti √® impresso lo stupore di aver perso tutto ci√≤ che per noi era scontato nei venti anni precedenti al nostro incontro. Quindi fumiamo e parliamo cercando conforto nella nostra esplorazione condivisa del nuovo mondo fatto di rate, tasse, affitti, signore questo e signora quest'altro. Per ogni boccata di fumo che tiro dentro di me urlo che siamo bambini e che sappiamo ancora solo piangere defecare e dormire. Abbiamo un lavoro, abbiamo le nostre lauree, ma che altro? Non posso pi√π prendere le mie bambole, vestirle da astronauta e dire ""ecco questa √® la luna equello √® un dinosauro"". Cerchiamo alternative grige a quella che era l'infinita gioia del gioco in un mondo vecchio e avido, invidioso del tempo che ci rimane.

Nelle finestre di lucidit√† ci accorgiamo della ferocia con il quale il secolo ventunesimo divora se stesso e si suoi figli, risucchiati tutti nel vortice dell'incertezza, dove ogni cosa si svaluta ossessivamente e la societ√† accellera esponenzialmente verso lo spettacolare epilogo atomico.

Dopo l'era del sacrificio, il secolo dell'assolutismo, i quarant'anni d'ottimismo, ecco il grande secolo dell'ansia. Per noi, nuova generazione perduta risparmiata alle armi ma circondati dalla guerra come un cappio che si stringe, l'imperativo √® ricacciare i cattivi pensieri nel Singel, ridere con l'amico del nulla, commuoversi studiando con gli occhi gonfi e annebbiati gli alberi inchinati lungo il canale, le case lunghe e storte, le chiese gravide di marmo e stucchi, ricordo indelebile del Gouden Eeuw.

Ritrovata una parvenza di lucidit√† ci incamminiamo con passo marziale verso Amsterdam sud, sopra la quale le nuvole sembrano diradarsi e un pallido sole autunnale illumina come un occhio di bue la piana di musei. Per ogni canale che passiamo scorgo in visioni allucinatorie la citt√† in bianco e nero. Per brevi istanti sono circondata da una silenziosa processione di uomini con il volto coperto da un borsalino e ragazze con lunghe gonne sopra scarpette di vernice. Agli angoli della strada i furgoni della Wehrmacht e le berline scure della Gestapo, le finestre coperte con i giornali, ombre lunghe e sinistre di bombardieri nel cielo. Stringo il braccio di Peter e sento i fischi delle bombe, le sirene antiaeree, il coro delle divisioni canadesi; ""in a foreign Field, in a distant land, See the Ric-a-dam-doo""

Nel silenzio del primo pomeriggio provo una colpevole nostalgia per tempi spietati e crudeli che mi sembrano cos√¨ semplici. Tutto in quegli scorci in bianco e nero appare pi√π vero e tangibile. L'angosciosa attesa della bomba sul mio tetto, la paura del lager della ragazza olandese. Sono colpevole e lo confesso, colpevole di preferire la fame e l'odio per un nemico con un volto e un'insegna. Invece i nostri giorni passano nella paura di se stessi, nella paura della paura stessa. Mi chiedo, mentre calpesto l'erba del Vondel appena illuminato da questo squallido sole di settembre, sarei stata cos√¨ depressa nell'Amsterdam in bianco e nero che vedo nei miei sogni lucidi? Avrei lo stesso contemplato la morte come estrema Ratio o mi sarei aggrappata disperatamente ad ogni lembo di vita? Mi siedo su una panchina mentre Peter fabbrica un'altro spinello e vorrei avere fame, vorrei avere paura, vorrei tremare come i vetri sotto i bombardamenti. Sorrido perch√© non saprei che altra espressione avere immersa nella pace del grande parco. Il fumo mi ha riempito la testa di prospettiva, che percepisco cone fragile e momentanea; allora sono in grado di vedere pi√π in l√† del dolore, oltre l'apatia. Mentre il battito accellera non riesco a pensare ad altro che a godere un qualunque piacere a qualsiasi costo. E in fondo, penso, √® una bella giornata. C'√® un poco di sole, c'√® un amico, c'√® un grande prato e gazebi e cespugli di fiori.

Cingo il collo di Peter e poggio la guancia sulla sua schiena.

\-Sai cosa mi piacerebbe?-

Gli dico

\-Andarcene tra le alpi italiane, insieme, in una casetta di tronchi, arredare casa solo con mobili ikea, vivere lavorando la terra, o restaurando mobili o fabbricando copriteiere di lana-

\-e un cane lo vuoi?-

Mi chiede lui

\-certo senn√≤ chi guarderebbe le pecore-

\-vuoi anche le pecore?-

\-si per fare il latte, 40 femmine e due montoni, tu puoi farti crescere la barba fino al petto e cantare lo yodel ogni mattina insieme al gallo-

Peter mi guarda e ridacchia.

\-mi piaci perch√© sei matta come un cavallo, l'idea di vivere per sempre con te per√≤ √® piuttosto inquietante-

\-e cosa vorresti tu, davvero intendo?-

Lui si fa serio e guarda lontano.

\-Quello che vogliono tutti, avere una moglie, non avere preoccupazioni, godere di buona salute. E tu?.-

Nel frattempo accende lo spinello e mi offre il primo tiro.

Rispondo con la voce ancora impastata dal fumo.

\-Non lo so pi√π che voglio. Vorrei finire questo cazzo di libro, ripartire con la mia carriera, suonare ancora raccontando cose nuove, o riesplorare cose passate. O forse non voglio pi√π nulla, ed √® questo il pi√π grande male. Non riesco pi√π a scrivere perch√© la musica e la letteratura sono bisogni umani, ed io non ho pi√π bisogno di niente-

Mi allungo sulla panchina e mi stringo nel cappotto, sento gli occhi gonfi di lacrime e di fumo ma non riesco a piangere.

\-Non voglio pi√π niente Peter. Sognavo di venire in Olanda, insegnare, vivere di poco in un appartamento in periferia. Ed era un sogno cos√¨ vivido che si √® avverato. Ora invece sono qui, con il culo nel Vondel ed √® la pi√π tranquilla domenica di settembre che si possa immaginare. Ho camminato tra i canali tossici e incantati di Amsterdam, ho respirato aria fresca, ho mangiato la torta di mele. Ma non voglio pi√π vedere nulla Peter, non voglio pi√π nulla, capisci?

1l0qjp4,https://i.redd.it/bg6vebs0vb4f1.jpeg,Yeah! by Maison Alhambra - Accurate but Weak,"Recently purchased this after wanting a cheaper alternative to Y. Top notes are Apple, Ginger, Bergsmot with middle notes being sage and juniper berries. Base notes are Tonka, Amberwood, Cedar. 

First of all I would start by saying this scent is almost identical to Y‚Äôs DNA. It‚Äôs so close that I‚Äôm sure a rookie would not be able to tell the difference between the dupe and the real deal. That‚Äôs the reason why I called it accurate. With that being said, the performance is missing. It only lasts on my skin for about 1-1.5 hours which is why I also put weak. 

I will breakdown the rest of the review into 5 parts;

1. PROJECTION: for a perfume that costs just above 1k, I would say it‚Äôs decent. Definitely superior than most local brands at this price point. People will definitely notice it on you and will easily confuse it for YSL Y. 

2. LONGEVITY: Here is where the problem is. When I do 5-6 sprays it lasts only for 1 hour on my skin and if I do around 10 sprays - it‚Äôs increased to about 1.5 hours. Tried doing a bit more on clothes etc but the longevity seems to be around the same. What it makes up for in scent profile, it lacks in longevity. Hopefully it increases a bit more if I let it sit for while. 

3. PRICE: I got this in May 2025, from Khanna Brothers for 1249. I would say for the price, it‚Äôs good. Not great. I‚Äôve tried fakkar black, which is also a popular clone of Y edp, and I think this is the more accurate one. 

4. FINAL THOUGHTS: This smell DNA is absolutely amazing. It‚Äôs definitely a blind buy in terms of scent profile. While the performance is no where near the real Y, and even other ME fragrances, the value is there. Not every fragrance needs to have 10+ hours of projection. This is perfect for the gym or short trips to buy some groceries or a tea / coffee date. Would not recommend for anything longer like office, night out etc. 

5. RATING: 6/10 - The rating I give is mainly due to how accurate the scent profile is. If only it lasted longer, I would definitely score it higher maybe even a perfect 10.

1l0qhcj,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l0qhcj,"Ardbeg Day 2025 - Raise a Dram to 25 Years, South Florida","Hope everyone had a great Ardbeg day yesterday! Here in South Florida, a local liquor chain, Primo Liquors, collaborated with the company to put together an outdoor tasting and celebration, complete with local bagpiper. This year also happens to be the 25th anniversary of the Ardbeg Committee, the distillery fan club, so there was even more to fete than usual. A lively crew of around 30 whisky fans and curious newcomers gathered together to embrace the spirit (in more ways than one) of one of my favorite distilleries.

Ardbeg is one of the most playful and offbeat whisky brands out there, and tries to lean away from the tweed-jackets-and-leather-armchairs image of scotch whisky in general, with brightly colored special editions and tongue-in-cheek themes for their annual Ardbeg day special editions. Consistent with this year‚Äôs bottle and theme, the ‚ÄúSmokiverse,‚Äù the main Ardbeg rep (I didn‚Äôt catch her name, unfortunately) dressed up in a full-on, shiny pink astronaut costume while leading this tasting with panache.

A big part of hosting memorable events is to underpromise and overdeliver, and the LVMH and Primo crews delivered in spades. For the modest $25 ticket price, I was expecting an in-store barrel top tasting‚Äìalready exciting enough, since the invite promised drams of Smokiverse, Ardcore, and Heavy Vapours, three of the past five years‚Äô Feis Ile releases. What we got was far more than that: a full flight of five Ardbegs with food pairings, and three bonus pours before and after the sit-down tasting. Oh, and the shop handed out an Ardbeg baseball cap and t-shirt to anyone who made a purchase‚Äìeven a non-Ardbeg bottle‚Äìafter we wrapped up. Unbelievably generous.

One final pro tip before some quick-hit impressions of today‚Äôs lineup: always bring your own glencairn or tasting glass to events. Our pours mostly came in little thimble cups, so I was glad to have an Ardbeg glass with me to appreciate everything a little more fully.

**Ardbeg 10** (46%) - I skipped this dram because so much more was to come, but anyone who knows Ardbeg knows what they‚Äôre getting with the classic 10: citrus, smoke, earthy peat, and hints of shellfish or coastal brininess. With this lineup in particular, those notes kept recurring again and again, albeit in different and unique permutations.

**Ardbeg Smokiverse** (48.3%) - The star of this year‚Äôs show was Smokiverse, a variation on Ardbeg‚Äôs usual spirit that uses ‚Äúhigh-gravity‚Äù mash. High-gravity mashing is a technique from the beer world that uses more grain to create a denser, higher-alcohol wash than usual. Ardbeg‚Äôs experiment with high-gravity mashing produced, in their view, a much fruitier take on the normal spirit. I was especially intrigued because I‚Äôd just tried Laphroaig Elements L2.0 a few weeks ago, which involved their own experiment with longer fermentation times to create a fruitier Laphroaig and resulted in a spectacular whisky. Smokiverse wasn‚Äôt quite as successful in my opinion, but it did offer a more Mediterranean-vacation twist on Ardbeg‚Äôs character. Zesty lime rinds, plenty of sea spray, and not much smoke on both the nose and the palate‚Äìas if you accidentally dipped a can of Sprite into seawater off the coast of Sicily. The crew paired this dram with several types of cheese, a great contrast to Smokiverse‚Äôs citric acidity.

**Ardbeg Anthology The Unicorn‚Äôs Tale, 14 y.o.** (46%) - A 2024 special release, this mid-teen Ardbeg was finished in Madeira casks, and the effects are somewhat predictable but scrumptious. Without being an especially dense dram, this pour was sweet and fruity, with hints of cranberries and peach syrup complementing the usual campfire smoke. Another standout pairing, this time with varieties of chocolate, including one with candied orange peel in the center that played beautifully with the Madeira‚Äôs influence.

**Ardbeg Ardcore** (46%) - While a lot of Ardbeg‚Äôs flavor experiments involve the end-stage of maturation, this one started at the very beginning by introducing 25% roasted black malt, which supposedly imparted flavors of coffee on this dram. To emphasize the difference in malt, the distillery finished this in ex-bourbon barrels, giving us a chance to contrast it with the very similarly matured Ardbeg 10. In my view, although fun to try, this dram felt like it took more away from the classic recipe than it added. The difference in malt lent some bitterness or pepperiness to the finish, but it didn‚Äôt quite capture coffee in my mind, and it lost quite a bit of the sweetness in the usual spirit that balances out the smoke and peat. This one was paired with dried apple chips, which did restore some needed fruitiness to the experience.

**Ardbeg 17 y.o.** (40%) - This whisky is a tribute to a bottling released early during Ardbeg‚Äôs revival, which consisted of pre-LVMH stocks but was diluted down to 40%. While returning to that ABV was somewhat controversial, I don‚Äôt mind it in this instance because 17 years have packed plenty of flavor into the liquid. At this point in its life cycle, Ardbeg, like most Islay whiskies, starts to hint at tropical flavors. My notes included cantaloupe, honey, and some umami seaweed‚Äìwhich only grew when we combined it with the thoughtful pairing of nori chips. The peat was much fainter, both due to the age and the ABV, layering in a burnt brioche undertone to the experience.

**Ardbeg Heavy Vapours Committee Release** (50.2%) - Back in 2023, I attended the Feis Ile where this expression debuted. Sadly, I wasn‚Äôt the biggest fan of it then, and two years haven‚Äôt changed my palate all that much. This one and the Ardcore had a lot in common; it‚Äôs basically a grassier, more herbal, saltier, less sweet take on Ardbeg‚Äôs usual spirit, but I didn‚Äôt find anything extra or unexpected. They did pair it with some tasty Korean barbecue chips, at least!

**Ardbeg 25 y.o.** (46%) - In retrospect, the title of the event heavily hinted that this would be offered. To commemorate 25 years of the Ardbeg Committee, we each got a generous pour of the 25-year-old. It‚Äôs quite remarkable how different this dram is from the mid- to late-teens Ardbegs that are its closest kin. This was the only whisky that I‚Äôd describe as heavy and even waxy in its texture, and it burst with flavor: grilled pineapple, lemon cough drops, menthol, floral peat, and honeycomb. This whisky was somehow both sweeter and oakier than anything else in the lineup. The final food pairing was a cracker with brie and some kind of jam, but to be honest, I think you could have paired this pour with workmen‚Äôs shoe leather and been fine.

**Ardbeg Traigh Bhan Batch 6, 19 y.o.** (46.2%) - To be honest, I was experiencing some palate exhaustion by this point. My main takeaway was that this Traigh Bhan was surprisingly sooty and smoky despite being the second-oldest dram we tried‚Äìmuch smokier than either the 14- or 17-year-olds that preceded it. The other notable feature was the influence of oloroso, which gave this whisky a nut-butter savoriness and pleasing mouthfeel. This was the savoriest expression we tried; no pairing, but my pick would be some burnt ends in a Carolina-style barbecue sauce.

To improve the facilities, workplace management roped in Nestle as the provider and supplier of Machines and Premixes from 1st of April 2025, they bought in way too amazing quality of products including cold beverages like cold coffee, iced tea and iced Chocolate and including hot beverages like tomato soup, hot chocolate etc 

As was expected, majority of the employees showed us why we do not deserve to have good things. people started hoarding near the machines, having 1 drink after another, it caused a lot of chaos in the pantry area. There were proper fights and ruckus that have happened, because groups of few people would dominate the entire pantry area and would not allow others to have the beverages ( because the Premixes would be exhausted within an hour everyday)

Due to all this, Tlthe Morning Coffee breaks began getting longer, managers started getting irritated as people would not be available for meetings. 

Employees started complaining that there are no beverages available in the noons and evenings, and hence the refills started happening thrice in a day , which was supposed to be like thrice in a week.

Due to all this, the company apparently exhausted 6 months of Premixes within the first 2 months itself and the workplace management is absolutely furious with the way everything unfolded in the last 2 months.

So Yeah, just exactly what we and a few other civics sensed employees dreaded has happened, The org is going back to the old liquid garbage, Because we really don't deserve to have nice things ",113,1748788535.0,IndianWorkplace,27,0.93,False

So I'm sitting in a wedding dress that cost three grand, mascara running down my face, and about fifty people staring at me like I'm the world's biggest joke. Because apparently, I am.

Let me back up. Two years ago, my husband got crushed by a forklift at the warehouse where he worked. Broke his back, crushed his pelvis, the whole nine yards. Doctor said he'd never walk again, might never work again. Workers comp was fighting the claim, saying it was his fault somehow. Meanwhile, we've got two kids, a mortgage, and medical bills piling up like snow in a blizzard.

I tried to be supportive at first, I really did. But watching him struggle just to get to the bathroom, seeing him cry when he thought I wasn't looking, dealing with his mood swings from the pain meds, it was killing me. I felt trapped. Like my whole life had been stolen from me at thirty-two years old.

That's when I met him at my sister's barbecue. Let's call him Rich Boy, because that's basically what he was. Owned three car dealerships, lived in one of those McMansions with the circular driveways. He was charming, funny, and most importantly, he had money. Lots of it. And really good insurance through his business.

The affair started innocent enough. Coffee dates, long phone calls, text messages that made me feel alive again. But it escalated fast. Within six months, I was head over heels and making plans. Rich Boy kept talking about how we could have this amazing life together, how he'd take care of me and the kids, how I deserved better than being stuck with a broken man.

So I did the unthinkable. I filed for divorce while my husband was still in physical therapy. Took the kids and moved in with my mother. The look on his face when I served him papers, Jesus. He just stared at me and said, ""I thought you loved me."" I told him I couldn't be his caretaker for the rest of my life.

Rich Boy was so supportive during the divorce. He'd wine and dine me, take me shopping, buy expensive gifts for the kids. He proposed three months after my divorce was finalized, with this massive ring that probably cost more than my old house. Said we'd have the wedding of my dreams and I'd never have to worry about money again.

The kids were having a hard time adjusting. They kept asking when they could see Daddy again, and I kept making excuses. My ex-husband had managed to get a part-time job doing phone customer service from home, which was honestly more than I thought he'd manage. But I convinced myself I was doing the right thing. The kids would have a better life with Rich Boy's money.

Wedding planning was insane. Rich Boy insisted on the works, a country club venue, designer everything, a honeymoon in Bali. I felt like Cinderella. My family thought I was moving too fast, but I didn't care. I was drunk on the fantasy of this perfect new life.

The morning of the wedding, Rich Boy seemed weird. Quiet, distracted. When I asked if he was okay, he said he was just nervous. Normal groom jitters, right? I should have known something was off when he insisted we couldn't see each other before the ceremony, even though we weren't exactly traditional people.

I'm standing at the altar in this gorgeous venue, probably two hundred people watching, including my kids in their little formal outfits. The music starts, everyone stands up, and I'm waiting for my future husband to walk down the aisle.

Five minutes pass. Then ten. The officiant keeps checking his watch. People are starting to whisper. My maid of honor goes to check on him.

She comes back white as a sheet and whispers in my ear: ""He's gone. His car's not in the parking lot. The groomsmen said he got a phone call an hour ago and just left.""

I stood there for what felt like forever, trying to process what was happening. Then someone's phone started buzzing. Then another. People were checking their phones and looking at me with a mixture of pity and something else. Horror maybe?

Turns out, my ex-husband had hired a private investigator months ago. He'd been documenting everything, the affair, my abandonment of him during his disability, how I was planning to marry someone else for money while refusing to let him see his own kids properly. Rich Boy had been served with papers that morning, something about a massive lawsuit for alienation of affection and interference with parental rights.

But here's the kicker, the PI also found out Rich Boy was already married. Had been for fifteen years. To someone in another state. The phone call that morning? His real wife had found out about the wedding through the investigation and was threatening to take him for everything in their divorce.

So there I was, abandoned at the altar, humiliated in front of everyone I knew, and suddenly realizing that the man I'd destroyed my family for was a complete fraud. The kids were confused and crying, my mother was furious, and I could hear people whispering about what kind of person leaves their disabled husband.

The worst part? When I got home that night, still in my wedding dress, there was a card waiting for me. From my ex-husband. It just said, ""I hope you find what you're looking for. The kids will always be welcome here when you're ready to let them choose.""

That broke me. More than the humiliation at the altar, more than finding out Rich Boy was married, more than anything. Because I realized what I'd actually thrown away.

I've been staying at my mom's for three weeks now, trying to figure out what to do next. The kids keep asking when they can see their dad, and I keep making excuses because I'm too ashamed to face him. My friends have mostly stopped talking to me. Half the town knows what happened because weddings are gossip gold mines.

My sister thinks I got what I deserved and that I should be grateful the truth came out before I married a bigamist. My mom thinks I should focus on rebuilding my relationship with my kids and stop feeling sorry for myself. But part of me feels like everyone's being too harsh. Yeah, I made mistakes, but I was drowning. I felt like I had no choice.

I keep thinking about calling my ex-husband, but what would I even say? ""Sorry I abandoned you when you needed me most, can we try again?"" The man's building a new life without me, and honestly, he's probably better off.

So AITA for laughing when Rich Boy ghosted me? Because honestly, the whole situation is so absurd that sometimes laughing is the only thing that keeps me from completely losing it. Or am I just trying to cope with the fact that I destroyed everything good in my life chasing after something that was never real to begin with?",1,1748788136.0,FoundandExpose,0,1.0,False

This ain‚Äôt about fitness or anything like that‚Äîit‚Äôs about how I went from being stuck in a soul-sucking job to chasing my dream of opening a lil‚Äô bakery, even when life threw every damn curveball at me. If you‚Äôre out there grinding for something you love, this one‚Äôs for you. Grab a coffee and let‚Äôs talk.The Struggle Was RealPicture this: two years ago, I was stuck in a cubicle, answering emails for a corporate job I hated. I‚Äôd spend my lunch breaks daydreaming about owning a cozy bakery, slinging fresh cinnamon rolls and cookies that‚Äôd make people smile. Baking was my happy place‚Äîalways has been. My grandma taught me how to make her famous pecan pie when I was a kid, and those moments in the kitchen were pure magic. But real talk? I was scared as hell to quit my job. Bills don‚Äôt pay themselves, ya know?Then life decided to spice things up. My landlord jacked up my rent, my car broke down (RIP my old Honda), and my mom got sick, so I was driving back and forth to Jersey to help out. I was stressed, broke, and crying into my coffee at 2 a.m. like, ‚ÄúWhy is everything falling apart?‚Äù I thought about giving up on the bakery dream. It felt like a silly fantasy when I could barely keep my head above water.But one night, I was baking a batch of chocolate chip cookies to cheer myself up, and I had this moment. I looked at those gooey, warm cookies and thought, ‚ÄúThis is what I‚Äôm meant to do.‚Äù I couldn‚Äôt keep living for a paycheck that didn‚Äôt even make me happy. So, I said screw it‚ÄîI‚Äôm going for it.The Leap and the ChaosI quit my job. Yeah, I know, wild move. I had like $2,000 in savings and a whole lotta hope. I started small, baking out of my tiny apartment kitchen and selling at local farmers‚Äô markets. I‚Äôd wake up at 4 a.m., knead dough, burn my fingers (every damn time), and haul trays of cupcakes to the market in my friend‚Äôs borrowed van. It was exhausting, but seeing people light up when they tried my lemon lavender scones? Worth it.Then came the setbacks. A big catering order got canceled last minute, I got hit with a fine for not having some dumb permit, and my mom‚Äôs hospital bills were piling up. I‚Äôd be smiling at customers one minute, then crying in the van the next. I felt like a failure, like maybe I wasn‚Äôt cut out for this. But every time I wanted to quit, I‚Äôd think of my grandma‚Äôs kitchen and how she‚Äôd tell me, ‚ÄúKeep going, kiddo. You got this.‚ÄùThe Glow-UpFast forward a year, and I‚Äôm still here, y‚Äôall. I saved up enough to rent a small storefront‚Äînothing fancy, just a cozy spot with fairy lights and a chalkboard menu. I called it ‚ÄúEmma‚Äôs Sweet Spot.‚Äù Opening day was chaos: the oven broke, I ran out of flour, and I spilled coffee on my apron. But people showed up. My friends, neighbors, even strangers from the market‚Äîthey came, they ate, they raved. I sold out of cinnamon rolls in two hours.Now, I‚Äôm not saying I‚Äôm living some bougie life. I still hustle every day, and I‚Äôm nowhere near rich. But I‚Äôm doing what I love, and that‚Äôs everything.

Basically got cheated on at a club and want to change my standards to girls who are introverted and enjoy coffees and movies, and staying at home.

A lot of my friends tell me theres no chance of me finding such girls, since I live in a small town and there are not many ""groups"" where people meet and do nerdy stuff together.

Also, if any girl feels like she fits the description, feel free to give me pointers on where to look and how to approach. 

Thank you!!

edit: yes guys, I do realize everyone can cheat, these types of girls are just my preferance as it is lol",75,1748787668.0,AskMenAdvice,176,0.75,False

1l0q2oy,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialNorwich/comments/1l0q2oy/looking_for_friends/,Looking for friends!,"Moving here kinda hit the reset button on all my social circles, and now that I‚Äôm feeling settled enough, I‚Äôm in the classic ‚Äúright, now what?‚Äù phase of rebuilding. I‚Äôve dipped my toe into some local events and Discord meetups and all that jazz, but honestly? Felt a bit like speed-friending with strangers in a waiting room. Just not for me. Bonus points for the time I got harassed! yeah, avoiding those now.

So, I figured I‚Äôd try Reddit and throw this post out into the universe. ( I made one before in the Norwich sub itself too) I'm around mostly during office hours (weird schedule life), don‚Äôt drink, and Saturdays are a no-go. Add in the fun twist that my partner and I have mostly separate social spheres and voil√†, solo adventure time due to not matching with common social schedules.

Basically, I‚Äôm looking for real, low-pressure connections with lovely humans who just wanna grab a midweek coffee, go on a chill walk, chat about music, or explore cute Norfolk spots together. I don‚Äôt care if you‚Äôre shy, loud, introverted, a parent, in a couple, or just someone who‚Äôs reading this thinking ‚Äúmaybe?‚Äù, I mean it when I say everyone‚Äôs welcome!

No intense requirements here. If you're 21+, open-minded, kinda direct and not flakey, and just genuinely up for meeting new people and seeing where things go, perfect. If we click, amazing. If we don‚Äôt, that‚Äôs totally fine too; high fives for trying.

As for me: I‚Äôm a music junkie (everything from hyper-pop, to drum and bass to metal), love nail art, baking, cleaning (seriously, it‚Äôs therapy), and discovering local spots. Big fan of good smells (yes, I will stop to sniff fancy soaps), cute caf√©s, grocery shopping like it‚Äôs a lifestyle, and making the everyday a little more fun! I'm carefree and don't take much seriously! I also dabble in games physical and digital, and the usual modern human behaviours: YouTube, Watching shows/films, deep philosophical chats about biscuits, etc.

Anyway, whether you‚Äôre reading this the day I post it or months down the line, I‚Äôm always happy to chat. Say hi, even if you‚Äôre nervous, I'm easy going and I‚Äôll meet you where you‚Äôre at. You never know, we might just be each other‚Äôs kind of weird. üòä ",3,1748787569.0,SocialNorwich,1,0.81,False

Tried story writing for the first time and posting it for the feedback and review. Please let me know what do you think about this. 

Start >> 

Aarav never believed in love‚Äîjust fleeting moments, casual dates, and easy exits. Dating was a game, and he played it well. Until Ishita.

She was different. Married, reserved, carrying an air of quiet sadness. Ishita wasn‚Äôt someone who sought adventure, yet here she was‚Äîsitting across from him at a dimly lit caf√©, staring at her untouched coffee.

Her marriage was perfect on the outside. Her husband was well-respected, accomplished, the kind of man people admired. But love‚Äîreal, soul-touching love‚Äîwas missing. Their interactions were mechanical, their intimacy obligatory. She never told him about her discomfort, her fear of touch, her body‚Äôs involuntary flinch when someone got too close. She learned to endure, to nod, to smile when required.

Until tonight.

The caf√© had been safe‚Äîconversation, light laughter, nothing too intense. But then came the lift.

Aarav reached for her hand as the doors slid shut. Instinct. A harmless gesture.

She reacted instantly.

She gasped, recoiling against the metal wall. Tears welled in her eyes, silent but telling. Her body trembled, as if trapped in a space too small for her past to hide.

Aarav had seen heartbreak before‚Äîhad even caused it. But this was different. This was deep, buried pain.

He pulled his hand back slowly, flipping it over‚Äîpalm up, open, waiting.

No pressure. No force. Just an invitation.

Ishita hesitated. The familiar panic surged inside her, but something else flickered too‚Äîcuriosity, maybe even trust. Slowly, cautiously, she placed her hand over his. Not gripping, not holding‚Äîjust resting.

The lift dinged. The doors opened.

She stepped out first, turning back toward him. For the first time that evening, she smiled.

And in that moment, something shifted.

Aarav walked into that lift as a man who never thought twice about feelings. He stepped out changed.
