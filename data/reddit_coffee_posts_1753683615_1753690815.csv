My Alpha husband, Ferris, handed me the cold contract, his voice devoid of any warmth:  
“I have a beloved partner who has temporarily left me. For the next three years, you will simply take her place as my Luna.”  
I accepted it all quietly and obediently—  
Three years were enough for me to plan a perfect exit.  
He sneered, “Boring Omega she-wolf.”  
When the contract finally expired, he thought I would remain his loyal shadow forever.  
But he was wrong—I never intended to stay.  
In the darkness of night, I dialed that long-forgotten number: “Dad, I’ve accepted the Black Mountain pack’s marriage proposal.”  
Later, at the solemn clan ceremony, Ferris watched helplessly as I linked arms with the Black Mountain Alpha, radiant with glory.  
In that moment, the world he had meticulously built crumbled to pieces.  
He finally understood that what he had let go of was not a temporary substitute—  
but the one and only true Luna destined by fate to resonate with his soul.

""I just sent you a divorce agreement. Alpha Ferris and I signed it on our wedding day three years ago. Could you check if there are any issues?""

I stood by the floor-to-ceiling window, my fingers unconsciously tracing the edge of my phone.

""Luna, I've reviewed the agreement. Everything looks fine.""

My lawyer's professional voice came through the speaker.

""There's one month left before the three-year term expires. Once it's up, the divorce will automatically take effect. You'll be free to leave the Silver Moon Pack and start fresh.""

""Thank you.""

I hung up and lifted my gaze to our wedding photo on the wall.

In the picture, I wore a pristine white gown, smiling so wide my eyes curved like crescent moons.

Beside me stood Alpha Ferris in his tailored suit—devastatingly hands0me, yet not even a hint of a smile graced his features.

Love versus indifference. Crystal clear.

""That day's finally coming. You must be thrilled,"" I whispered to myself, my fingertip gently tracing the cold, sharp lines of the man's face in the photo.

The sound of keys jingling at the front door made me quickly pull my hand back and turn around.

""I'm home.""

I took Ferris's suit jacket as he shrugged it off, then squatted down to help him into his slippers.

My movements flowed with practiced precision, like I'd rehearsed this routine a thousand times.

Ferris loosened his tie, his expression remaining distant.

""Next month's Moonlight Gala for the Silver Moon Pack—I need you there as Luna.""

Thinking about that divorce agreement set to activate in one month, my hands paused while folding his jacket.

I shook my head. ""I can't make it.""

""Why not?"" Ferris frowned.

I opened my mouth to explain, but suddenly something clicked in his mind. His eyes turned glacial.

""Is this because I've been spending time with Ashley? Are you jealous?""

""I told you on our wedding day—I'm in love with someone else. You said you wouldn't interfere.""

My heart clenched violently, like someone had torn it wide open.

Right. My mate, my Alpha, had told me on our wedding night that he already had a she-wolf he truly loved. He'd only married me to shut up the pack elders.

Not only that, but on our wedding night, he'd forced me to sign an agreement to divorce after three years.

Looking at Ferris's irritated expression, I managed a weak smile.

He thought I was jealous. Throwing a tantrum.

I am merely fulfilling his wish by leaving the Silver Moon Pack next month, so I will not be able to attend the banquet.

He must be ecstatic. Soon he'd be free to marry his true love.

With a bitter smile tugging at my lips, I reminded him, ""Ferris, do you remember the agreement we signed three years ago?""

Three years ago, the Silver Moon Pack and Stardust pack announced their upcoming alliance through marriage.

These were two of the wealthiest and most powerful packs in the werewolf world. With their heirs becoming mates, both packs would reach unprecedented heights of strength and prestige.

I'd harbored a secret crush on Ferris since childhood. Learning I'd become his Luna had sent me over the moon.

But on our wedding night, Ferris handed me divorce papers.

""I'm in love with someone else. Her name is Ashley Carter. Since she's an omega, my father refuses to let her become my Luna.""

His tone was cold, his words brutally direct. ""I need three years to become Silver Moon's true Alpha. After that, no one will dare oppose our union.""

""For these three years, we'll just play the role of husband and wife. Then we divorce.""

That night, I signed as he wished, then cried in the bathroom until dawn.

But less than three months after our wedding, Ashley vanished without a trace after a fight with Ferris.

Ferris went crazy searching for her. He pulled every string, used every connection, but found nothing.

During that period, he'd stay out all night, coming home reeking of alcohol with terrifyingly dark eyes.

Until one night, he stumbled home completely wasted and pinned me to the bed.

His kiss crashed down on me, heavy with alcohol, but he whispered, ""Ashley... why did you leave? Why are you with someone else? Don't you trust me?""

My entire body went rigid. My heart felt like someone was crushing it in their fist—the pain nearly suffocating.

So... he'd found her.

But Ashley was with someone else now.

That night was my first time, yet Ferris held me while calling another woman's name until sunrise.

The next morning, Ferris saw the blood on the sheets. His eyes flickered with something unreadable, but he said nothing.

I acted like nothing had happened, preparing his fresh clothes and even gently reminding him about his important meeting before he left.

I pretended everything was fine, but inside, I was bleeding out.

Married for three years, secretly married for three years. The Silver Moon wolves knew their Alpha had taken a Luna, but only a select few knew her name or what she looked like.

I didn't care about any of that. From then on, I became even more careful about taking care of Ferris.

Ferris was always buried in pack business, frequently skipping meals. At night, his stomach would cramp with excruciating pain.

So I'd wake before dawn every day, spending hours brewing medicinal herb soup.

When he was exhausted, I learned massage techniques to ease his tension.

He loved quiet, so I never made noise around him. I hid my naturally cheerful, sunny personality and even softened my footsteps.

Gradually, Ferris seemed to accept me as his mate.

He started giving me small gifts on holidays.

When I fell ill, he'd personally hunt down rare herbs based on the healer's prescriptions.

He'd even hold me close during the night, his palm pressed against my waist, his body heat scorching.

Ferris never mentioned divorce again, as if that agreement had never existed.

I was naive enough to believe that maybe, just maybe, he could learn to love me.

Until three months ago, when Ashley returned to the Silver Moon Pack after her breakup.

Ferris rushed back to her side almost instantly.

He'd take her to dinner, go shopping with her, even cancel crucial pack meetings because Ashley mentioned feeling ""a little down.""

Standing at the window, watching Ferris's car head toward Ashley's apartment yet again, I finally understood.

True love is true love. No matter how much I gave, it could never compete with a single glance from Ashley.

At least the three-year contract marriage was finally ending.

I told myself these three years had been nothing but a dream.

Now the dream was over. Time for me to leave.

""The agreement from three years ago?""

Ferris's voice snapped me out of my memories. I stared at him in shock, my throat tightening.

He... didn't remember the divorce agreement?  
These three years, I'd been counting down every single day, terrified that the moment our contract expired, he'd leave without hesitation.

Yet now, he seemed to have completely forgotten about it.

I opened my mouth to remind him when Ferris's phone suddenly rang.

The moment he answered, Ashley's tear-choked voice came through the speaker.

I couldn't make out her words, but I watched Ferris's expression shift dramatically.

""Don't be scared. I'm coming right now.""

He hung up, grabbed his car keys, and bolted for the door.

In his rush, his shoulder slammed hard into my body.

I stumbled backward, my spine hitting the doorframe with enough force to make me gasp in pain.

But Ferris never looked back. His figure had already vanished through the doorway.

I steadied myself against the wall and slowly made my way back to the bedroom. When I removed my jacket, a dark bruise was already blooming across my shoulder.

I retrieved the first aid kit and silently applied ointment to the injury, feeling like my heart was being carved open with a dull blade, slice by agonizing slice.

I sat on the bed's edge, staring blankly at the darkening sky outside until my phone rang.

Ferris.

""Come to Silver Pine General Medical Center.""

My heart lurched. ""What happened?""

""Just get here.""

When I arrived, I spotted Ferris standing outside the operating room from across the corridor. Ashley was nestled against his ch3st, crying pitifully.

My steps faltered. Something clamped around my ch3st, making each breath a struggle.

""What's going on?"" I approached them, keeping my voice soft.

Ferris looked up at me. ""Ashley's mother has acute leukemia. She needs an immediate bone marrow transplant.""

I blinked in confusion. ""And?""

""We've tested everyone in Silver Moon Pack, including myself. No matches."" Ferris's tone remained flat. ""You have a donation record on file at the medical center. You're compatible.""

My pupils contracted as disbelief washed over me. ""You want me to donate bone marrow?""

""It's your responsibility as Luna.""

Ferris closed his eyes. When he opened them again, only cold determination remained. ""Hold her down.""

At his command, several warriors stepped forward and gripped my shoulders. One pulled out a syringe.

""Ferris Vargan!"" I struggled desperately. ""I already donated years ago—I can't donate again! This will kill me! Let me go!""

""If you do this, my father and the entire Stardust pack will never forgive you!""

The warriors hesitated, their grip loosening as they looked to Ferris for guidance.

""You'd tell any lie to avoid donating."" Ferris's voice turned glacial. ""Hold her. I'll take full responsibility for any consequences.""

The warriors didn't dare defy their Alpha. They pinned me down as the needle pierced my skin.

The anesthetic worked quickly. My consciousness began to blur, my strength fading until I couldn't fight anymore.

A healer spoke quietly nearby: ""Alpha Ferris, this surgery requires a family member's signature.""

Ferris took the pen and paper. ""I can sign right now.""

Family member...

My heart clenched violently.

Right. Legally, I was still his Luna.

This was the first time he'd so readily acknowledged me as his Luna.

And it was only so I could donate bone marrow to Ashley's mother.

How fu/cking ironic.

The nurse handed over the surgical consent form. Ferris wrote his name with careful, deliberate strokes.

For some inexplicable reason, his pen hesitated mid-signature, and a sharp pain shot through his ch3st.

Ashley urged him gently, tears glistening in her eyes. ""Are you having second thoughts?""

Ferris's gaze flickered, but he said nothing. He finished signing and watched as I was wheeled into the operating room.

The moment those doors closed, my tears finally fell.

So this was how deeply Ferris loved Ashley—enough to sacrifice my life for her sake.

Ferris, I'm never going to love you again.

The surgical lights blazed on while the corridor fell silent except for the sound of breathing.

After I disappeared behind those doors, he stood at the corridor's end, staring at that cold, steel barrier for what felt like hours—like a caged wolf unable to catch his mate's scent.

He tried to sit but lasted only seconds before springing back up to pace restlessly.

Only when he saw me being wheeled out of surgery did he finally exhale.

""How is she?""

The doctor removed his mask, but his expression remained grave. ""The surgery went smoothly, but the Luna's body is... extremely weak. Recovery will be difficult. She'll need careful, constant care.""

Ferris nodded. ""I'll go see her.""

He'd barely taken a step toward the patient room when a hand caught his arm.

Ashley.

""Ferris,"" she said softly, ""the beta just came from the Werewolf Council. They need you back immediately to handle the border territory dispute. It can't wait any longer.""

""I know you're worried about her, but you're the Alpha. The pack has to come first.""

Ferris's throat worked as uncertainty flashed in his eyes.

Ashley stepped forward, blocking his path. ""Go handle pack business. I'll stay and take care of her. I promise, when she wakes up, I'll be the first thing she sees.""

Ferris nodded and left the hospital with his subordinates.

I don't know how much time passed before I slowly opened my eyes after surgery.

I turned my head with difficulty, my throat feeling like sandpaper. My first instinct was to search for—

Ferris.

But the person in my line of sight was Ashley.

She smiled at me. ""You're finally awake. Thank you, Aurora. You saved my mother.""

I looked up at her without speaking.

Ashley wiped away tears, her voice thick with emotion. ""I really never imagined... after all these years, Ferris would still love me this deeply.""

She paused, as if lost in memory.

""Do you know? Last year on my birthday, he flew all the way to Paris just to bring me a necklace... It was a design I'd mentioned liking once in passing, and he actually remembered all that time.""

""But I was still angry with him then. I threw the necklace right back at him and wouldn't even let him through the door.""

My fingers clenched violently, nails digging deep into my palms.

I remembered perfectly. Last year, Ferris had told me he was traveling to Mississippi for business negotiations with the Ghost Wolf Pack.

When he returned, he'd brought back a necklace and casually given it to me.

I'd been overjoyed, treasuring it in the bottom of my jewelry box—too precious to even wear.

But it turned out... that was Ashley's reject, something he'd carelessly passed along to me.

Ashley continued, ""And the Christmas before last, I had a huge fight with my boyfriend at the time and posted something really depressing on Instagram. When Ferris saw it, he flew over that same night and stood outside my apartment building all night long. It was snowing heavily, but he just stood there, never daring to come up and knock.""

My heart twisted painfully.

I remembered that Christmas night—Ferris had been unusually passionate, making love to me seven times straight until dawn.

That entire night, he'd been rough and relentless in bed. Even when his harsh movements hurt me, I'd gritted my teeth and endured it.

Because I thought he was finally starting to feel something for me.

When I woke up the next morning, the bed beside me was already cold. I assumed he'd left to handle urgent pack business.

It turned out... he'd rushed off to see Ashley.

""These past three years..."" Ashley's tears fell again. ""I've been stubborn, deliberately avoiding contact with him. But Ferris never forgot me for a single day. He wrote me a letter every day, even though I never once replied.""

I suddenly found it hard to breathe.

How many late nights had I seen the study light on, thinking he was handling pack affairs? I'd even brewed coffee specially to bring him.

It turned out... he was writing love letters to Ashley.

I'd always believed that at least during Ashley's absence, Ferris genuinely wanted us to become a real married couple.

Now I understood. From beginning to end, it had all been my own delusional fantasy.

The heart I thought I'd finally warmed belonged entirely to someone else.

Seeing Ashley about to continue, I abruptly stood up.

My face was pale as paper, but I forced my voice to remain calm. ""I'm not feeling well. I need to rest.""

A flash of triumph crossed Ashley's eyes. ""Of course, you just had surgery. You should rest more.""

Her footsteps finally faded outside the door.

I lay on the hospital bed with my eyes open, staring at the blank ceiling.

After discharge, I silently packed all my belongings, waiting only for the divorce agreement's expiration.

During this time, I could track Ferris's activities daily through Ashley's social media—

The surgery had been successful, but he never once came to check on me. Instead, he immediately arranged the finest private room for Ashley's mother, flew in top medical teams from abroad, and personally supervised every treatment plan.

Ashley's latest Instagram post was a photograph.

Ferris knelt on one knee, tying her shoelaces.

Her caption read: \[I'll never meet anyone who loves me this much again.\]

My heart clenched violently. Tears splashed onto my phone screen, blurring the image of Ferris's tender profile.

I remembered how I'd cared for him with the same devotion all these years.

When his stomach troubled him, I'd brew medicinal soups daily.

When work kept him busy, I'd leave the lights on waiting for his return.

Every piece of fruit I brought him was peeled, cored, and cut to perfect bite-sized pieces...

But now he was doing these things for someone else.

I took a deep breath, wiped away my tears, and mind-linked Ferris.

After a long pause, Ferris responded coldly, ""I should have told you not to interrupt when I'm working—""

For the first time, I cut him off:

""Ferris, let's break our bond.""",1,1753690771.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False
1mbajss,https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackNovel/comments/1mbajss/every_time_my_husband_filed_for_divorce/,Every time my husband filed for divorce,"Every time my husband filed for divorce, he had only one condition: I took all the property, and he only wanted our daughter.  
On my birthday, I flew across the ocean to surprise them… and found him having dinner with his true love—my stepsister.  
My daughter looked at her and said, “Mommy.”  
That day, I finally woke up.  
I drafted the divorce papers, gave up custody, and walked away from it all, building a billion-dollar empire from scratch.  
But when I returned home one night with a business partner, my ex husband cornered me against the wall.  
“Divorce?” he said, eyes dark. “Not a chance.”

After seven years of marriage, my husband, Trevor, fell for another woman—even our daughter wanted her as her new mom.  
I scoffed at the years I’d wasted and handed him the divorce papers. Yet he dropped his usual aloofness, slamming me against the wall,  
“Divorce? Not a chance.”  
\*\*\*  
When Celeste Rodriguez landed at the airport in Andostan, it was already past 9:00 pm.  
It was her birthday. Her phone buzzed with messages from colleagues and friends—but not a single one from her husband, Trevor Fleming.  
Celeste's smile faded.  
By the time she reached the villa, it was already past 10:00 pm.  
Hannah Lynd, the housekeeper looked startled. ""Mrs. Fleming... what a surprise.""  
""Where are Trevor and Jo?"" Celeste asked, handing over her luggage.  
""Mr. Fleming isn’t back yet. Miss Jordyn’s upstairs playing.""  
Celeste climbed the stairs. In her room, Jordyn sat in pajamas at her desk, completely absorbed.  
""Jo?"" Celeste called.  
Jordyn turned, her eyes lighting up. In a happy tone, she greeted, ""Mom!""  
But then she quickly got back to what she was doing earlier.  
Celeste walked over and hugged her tight, planting a kiss on her cheek. Yet the little one pushed her away and squirmed. ""Mom, I’m busy.""  
It had been two months since Celeste last saw Jordyn. She missed her so much that no amount of kisses felt enough. She wanted to talk to Jordyn.  
She noticed the necklace Jordyn was threading. ""Jo, are you making a seashell necklace?""  
""Mm-hm!"" Jordyn perked up visibly. ""Wynn's birthday is in a week. Dad and I picked and polished these ourselves. Pretty, right?""  
Celeste’s throat tightened. Jordyn didn’t look up, only added brightly, ""Dad even got her a custom gift, tomorrow—""  
Celeste felt a pang in her chest and couldn't hold back anymore. ""Jo… Do you remember it's my birthday today?""  
""Huh?"" Jordyn glanced up briefly, then quickly looked back down at the string of beads in her hands, She complained, ""Mom, don’t talk, Look, I messed up the bead order—""  
Celeste stood there in silence for a while, but Jordyn never looked back up. Finally, Celeste pursed her lips and left the room without another word.  
Downstairs, Hannah said, ""I called Mr. Fleming. He said he’s busy tonight and you should rest first.""  
""I see."" Celeste replied softly.  
She hesitated, then called Trevor. It rang for a while before he answered.  
his tone was indifferent as usual. ""I'm busy. Let's talk tomorrow—""  
A woman’s voice chimed in: ""Trevor, who is it?""  
Wynn.  
Celeste gripped the phone tighter.  
""No one important,"" Trevor answered her.  
Before Celeste could say anything, Trevor had already hung up.  
Celeste stared at the screen. Two or three months apart, and this was all he had for her.  
After so many years of marriage, he’d always been cold. Distant. Impatient.  
She had got used to chasing after him, calling again, begging for time. Yet tonight, she didn’t bother.  
Perhaps she was just too tired.

The next morning, Celeste thought it over and decided to call Trevor again.  
There was a time difference of about 17 or 18 hours between Andostan and their home country. In Andostan, today was her actual birthday.  
She didn’t just come here for Jordyn. She wanted one thing: a family meal. Her only birthday wish.  
Yet, Trevor didn’t answer.  
A long time later, he texted: What’s up?  
She replied: Lunch today? Just the three of us.  
Trevor answered: Okay. Send the address.  
Alright, she typed back.  
That was it. No acknowledgment. No “Happy birthday.” She wasn’t surprised. But it still stung.  
As she headed downstairs, she overheard Jordyn talking with Hannah.  
""Aren't you happy that Mrs. Fleming is here, sweetie?"" Hannah asked.  
""Dad and I promised to take Wynn to the beach tomorrow. If Mom comes, it'll be weird. She’s always mean to Wynn.""  
""Mrs. Fleming is still your mom, sweetie. That’s hurtful.""  
""I know, but Dad and I like Wynn more. Can't Wynn be my mom instead?""  
Celeste froze.  
She had raised Jordyn herself most of the time. But over the past two years, the more time Jordyn spent with Trevor, the more attached she became to him. When Trevor came to Andostan to expand his business last year, Jordyn had insisted on coming along.  
Celeste was reluctant and had hoped Jordyn would stay by her side. But she couldn't bear to see Jordyn upset, so she agreed.  
And now, Jordyn didn’t even want her as her mom anymore.  
Celeste stood frozen in place, her face pale. To think that she had pushed aside her work to come to Andostan with the intention of spending more time with Jordyn.  
Now, it seemed unnecessary.  
She walked back to her room, pale and quiet, then repacked the gifts she’d brought.  
Later, Hannah texted: Madame, I took Jordyn out. Let me know if you need anything.  
Celeste sat on the bed, feeling hollow and lost inside. She had abandoned her work and made this trip, only to find no one wanted her here.  
Her arrival was nothing but a joke.

After a long while, she left the villa. Aimlessly, she drove around in this foreign yet familiar country.  
By noon, she remembered she had planned to have lunch with Trevor and Jordyn. As she recalled what she had overheard in the morning, she hesitated about whether to go home and pick up Jordyn.  
Then, a text from Trevor came: Something came up. Lunch’s canceled.  
Celeste stared at it.  
She should’ve known. Trevor always canceled on her. His work, friends, and everything else always came before her, his wife.  
Once, she’d cry. Today, she just felt… empty.  
Celeste was at an utter loss. She had come all this way excitedly only to be met with indifference from both Trevor and Jordyn.  
Aimlessly, she drove around. Eventually, she found herself outside an old favorite restaurant which she and Trevor used to frequent.  
Just as she was about to walk in, she saw them.  
Trevor. Jordyn. Wynn.  
Wynn sat next to Jordyn, laughing, feeding the little one the pastries she had taken a bite out of. Jordyn giggled, with her legs swinging around happily. Trevor smiled as he served food to both of them, but his gaze never left Wynn.  
What a happy family of three!  
So this was his ""something came up.""  
And this was the daughter she had carried for ten long months and nearly lost her life to bring into this world.  
Celeste laughed humorlessly. She stood there watching for a long time. Finally, she turned and drove away.

Back at the villa, Celeste drafted the divorce agreement.  
Trevor had been her teenage dream—but he had never truly seen her. If not for that one night and his grandfather Arnold Fleming’s pressure, he never would’ve married her. She thought loving him hard enough would be enough, but seven years proved otherwise.  
For a long time, she felt lucky to have Jo—her only source of comfort. But now, even Jo didn’t seem to want her.  
That was it.  
She was done—with the marriage, the lies, the thankless role of wife and mother. It was time to leave all this behind—and reclaim the promising life she'd given up!  
She sealed the divorce papers, handed them to Hannah, then grabbed her suitcase and walked out, bound for the airport. On the way, she finally dialed the number she’d been avoiding for months.  
The line rang once. Twice. A click.  
“Hello?”  
She took a breath, steady and sharp.“That offer still stand?”“I’m in.”  
...  
At around 9:00 pm, Trevor and Jordyn returned home.  
Jordyn clung to the hem of Trevor's coat and got out of the car sluggishly. Because Celeste was at home, she was reluctant to return that night.  
But Wynn had said that Celeste came specifically to be with her and Trevor, and if they didn't return, she would be sad. Trevor also said that if they didn't go home that night, Celeste would definitely insist on joining them on their outing to the sea the next day.  
Reluctantly, Jordyn agreed to come home.  
Still worried, she muttered gloomily, ""Dad, what if Mom insists on tagging along with us tomorrow?""  
""She won't,"" Trevor replied confidently.  
In all the years they'd been married, Celeste had always tried to find ways to spend more time with him. But she was also sensible. As long as he made his stance clear, she wouldn't dare make him upset.  
In Jordyn's memory, Celeste always listened to Trevor. Since he said she wouldn't, she felt reassured. As a result, her mood lifted. She made her way into the villa cheerfully and told Hannah she wanted to take a bath.  
""Sure, sure,"" Hannah replied to Jordyn. Then, she remembered Celeste's instructions and handed an envelope to Trevor. ""Mr. Fleming, this is from Mrs. Fleming. She asked me to give it to you.""  
Trevor took the envelope and asked casually, ""Where is she?""  
""Mrs. Fleming packed up and went back to the country this afternoon. Didn't you know?"" Hannah responded.  
Trevor paused mid-step as he was heading upstairs. He turned back, feeling a little surprised. ""Has she gone back?""  
""Yes.""  
Why had Celeste suddenly come to Andostan? Trevor hadn't given her a chance to tell him about it. He hadn't cared to ask either. Upon learning she'd left, he didn't dwell on it.  
Jordyn was a little surprised too. When she heard the news, she felt a small twinge of disappointment. She'd been thinking that even if Celeste didn't join them for the outing tomorrow, it might be nice to have her around at home in the evening.  
Polishing the seashells made her hands hurt—she had been counting on Celeste's help in finishing the necklace.  
Though it had been months since Trevor and Celeste had seen each other, she had made the effort to visit but only to leave without seeing him in person. Hannah recalled Celeste's grim expression as she left and thought that things felt a little off.  
She couldn't help but say, ""Mr. Fleming, Mrs. Fleming looked upset when she left. She seemed angry.""  
Hannah had assumed Celeste's sudden departure was due to an urgent matter. Upon realizing Trevor hadn't known she'd left, she began to feel something was amiss.  
""Angry?"" Trevor repeated in his mind.  
In his presence, Celeste had always been patient and accommodating. So, she could get angry too? This was new.  
Trevor smiled faintly and responded to Hannah perfunctorily before heading upstairs.  
Back in the bedroom, he was about to open the envelope Celeste had left when Wynn called. After answering the call, he tossed the envelope aside and walked out the door.  
A short while later, the envelope slipped off the bed onto the floor.  
That night, Trevor didn't return home.  
The next day, Hannah noticed the envelope on the floor when she was cleaning. Recognizing it as the one Celeste had asked her to hand over, she assumed Trevor had already seen it and placed it in a nearby drawer.  
…  
Right after getting off the plane, Celeste went home and began packing her belongings. She had accumulated quite a few things in the house since she'd been living there for six years, after all. But she only took a few sets of clothes, two sets of daily necessities, and some books that were related to her field of study back in college.  
After their marriage, Trevor had been depositing money for her and Jordyn into two separate accounts every month. One account was hers, and the other was Jordyn's.  
However, Celeste was used to spending her own money only. She had never touched the money in Jordyn's account. Because she loved Trevor, whenever she went shopping and saw clothes, shoes, cufflinks, or ties that suited him, she couldn't help but buy them.  
In contrast, she didn't have many expenses on a daily basis because all she did was go to work. Her heart and mind were always focused on Trevor and Jordyn. She wanted to give them the best of everything.  
Most of the money Trevor deposited into her bank account was spent on him and Jordyn.  
Given this spending pattern, there shouldn't have been much money left in Celeste's account. But over the past year, her opportunities to buy things for Trevor and Jordyn had decreased significantly because they were in Andostan.  
Now, there were over three million dollars in her account. That amount might not matter to Trevor, but to her, it was no small sum. And since it was her money, Celeste didn't hesitate to transfer it out.  
She left both cards behind, dragged her suitcase out the door, and didn't look back.  
Celeste had an apartment near her workplace, which was a little over 1,100 square feet. She'd bought it four years ago to support a friend who had been struggling to meet their sales targets. She had never lived there before.  
Now, the apartment came in handy. She had it cleaned regularly, so it wasn't dirty. After a quick tidy-up, it was ready to move in.  
After a long day, Celeste washed up and went to bed around 10:00 pm.  
…  
The shrill sound of an alarm jolted Celeste awake. Startled, her mind went blank for a moment.  
When she came to her senses, she realized that while it was 1:00 am here, it was 7:00 am in Andostan, where Trevor and Jordyn were. This was their usual breakfast time.  
Ever since Jordyn had gone to live with Trevor in Andostan, Celeste had developed the habit of calling her at this time every day. As she was always exhausted from work and was used to going to bed early, she had set this alarm to ensure she wouldn't miss the call.  
At first, Jordyn hadn't adapted well to living in Andostan and had missed her terribly. She had called Celeste constantly. But as time went on, the calls that used to be full of yearning and dependence had grown perfunctory and impatient.  
The alarm was no longer necessary. She just hadn't been able to let go.  
Smiling bitterly, Celeste deleted the alarm and turned off her phone before going back to sleep.  
…  
Meanwhile, Trevor and Jordyn were nearly done with breakfast. Though he knew Celeste usually called Jordyn at this time, he wasn't always home and hadn't paid much attention to the routine.  
He noticed that Celeste hadn't called that day. The fact registered in his mind, but he didn't care. After finishing breakfast, he went upstairs to change.  
Jordyn, finding Celeste increasingly annoying, had grown less fond of their calls. Upon realizing that Celeste hadn't called yet, she figured something must have come up.  
She grabbed her backpack and bolted for the door.  
Hannah hurried after her. ""Ms. Fleming, it's still early. There's no rush!""  
Jordyn ignored her and ran to the car happily. She was thrilled that Celeste hadn't called on time that day. If she stayed home, she might still have to talk to Celeste later. Well, she didn't want that!  
…  
After getting married to Trevor, Celeste had joined Fleming Group for his sake. Now that she was planning to divorce him, she saw no reason to stay.  
The next morning, Celeste handed her resignation letter to Zeke Jackson after arriving at the office.  
Zeke was one of Trevor's personal secretaries. When he saw Celeste's resignation letter, he was extremely surprised.  
He was one of the few in the company who knew about the relationship between Celeste and Trevor.  
Anyone familiar with Trevor knew that he didn't love Celeste. So, he had been cold to her and rarely went home after their marriage.  
To get closer to and win over Trevor, Celeste had chosen to work at Fleming Group.  
Her initial goal was to become his personal secretary, but Trevor refused vehemently. Even when Arnold stepped in, he couldn't get Trevor to agree. In the end, Celeste had to settle for a position in the secretarial team, becoming one of Trevor's many ordinary secretaries.  
At first, Zeke had worried that Celeste's presence in the secretarial team would create chaos. But to his surprise, she didn't bring them any trouble. Although Celeste used her position to get closer to Trevor, she was mindful of her timing and never overstepped her boundaries.  
On the contrary, she worked diligently and performed exceptionally well, hoping to gain Trevor's respect. Whether during her pregnancy, childbirth, or any other time, she strictly adhered to company policies and never sought special treatment.  
Over the years, Celeste rose to become the head of the secretarial team. Zeke had observed her feelings for Trevor from the sidelines all the while. To be honest, he had never imagined she would resign one day. He felt skeptical about her willingly giving up her position.  
Something must have happened between Celeste and Trevor for her to resign now. Zeke understood that this was something he wasn't privy to—it must be something significant enough for Trevor to have ordered her to resign.  
While he found it a pity, Zeke maintained a professional tone. ""I acknowledge that I've received your resignation letter. I'll arrange for someone to take over your duties as soon as possible.""  
""Alright."" Celeste nodded and returned to her workstation.  
After working for a while, Zeke started an online meeting with Trevor to report on company matters. As the conversation neared its end, he suddenly remembered Celeste's resignation.  
""Oh, Mr. Fleming, there's one more thing—""  
Although Zeke had told Celeste he would quickly arrange for someone to take over her position, he wanted to gauge Trevor's thoughts on the matter first. If Trevor wanted Celeste out immediately, he would make the arrangements right away.  
But as the words left his mouth, he remembered that when Celeste first joined the company, Trevor had explicitly stated that all matters regarding her employment should be handled per company regulations. He made it clear that there was no need to report anything to him since he wouldn't concern himself with her.  
And indeed, over the years, Trevor had never actively inquired about Celeste's work at the company.  
Even when he encountered her at work, he treated her like she was a complete stranger.  
When Celeste was set to be promoted a couple of years ago, the team had hesitated. Everyone was aware of Trevor's dislike for her. They had even brought it up with him to gauge his opinion back then.  
Trevor had frowned in annoyance and reiterated that he wouldn't interfere and that they should handle it according to company policy. He had emphasized that they shouldn't bring up Celeste's matters with him again.  
Seeing Zeke's hesitation, Trevor frowned. ""What is it?""  
Zeke snapped out of his thoughts and quickly replied, ""Oh, it's nothing.""  
Since Trevor was already aware of Celeste's resignation but hadn't brought it up, it was clear that this matter wasn't important to him. So, Zeke decided to proceed as usual and handle the matter according to company regulations.  
With that resolved, Trevor ended the call.  
…  
""What are you thinking about?"" At noon, a colleague patted Celeste on the shoulder.  
Celeste came back to her senses and smiled, shaking her head. ""Nothing.""  
""Don't you need to call your daughter today?""  
""No, not today.""  
Typically, she called Jordyn twice a day—once at 1:00 am and once at around 12:00 pm.  
Her colleagues at work were aware of this habit. What they didn't know was her daughter was the child she had with the company's CEO.  
After work, Celeste went to the supermarket. She bought some groceries and a few potted plants before heading home.  
After dinner, she browsed online for information about the upcoming technology exhibition.  
After that, she made a call. ""Please reserve a ticket for next month's tech exhibition for me.""  
""Are you sure?"" the person on the other end replied coolly. ""The last two times you asked me to reserve tickets, you didn't show up. Do you know how many people's lifelong dream is to get one of those tickets? You wasted them thoughtlessly.""  
The annual tech exhibition was a major event in the industry, and tickets were not easily obtainable.  
Their company had a limited number of slots, and many IT elites working for them eagerly vied for the opportunity to attend it.  
""If I don't show up to the exhibition this time, I will never ask you to reserve a ticket for me ever again,"" Celeste promised.  
There was silence on the other end before the line disconnected.  
Celeste knew that he'd agreed. The corners of her mouth tugged upward into a smile. What she hadn't said was that she wanted to return to the company.  
Though she was one of the partners of her tech firm, she had stepped back during its early days to focus on marriage and family. Her decision had disrupted their development plans and cost them many opportunities.  
Her colleagues had been both angry and frustrated with her. Over the years, they had rarely been in contact.  
While Celeste was eager to return, she knew she had been out of the industry for too long. If she went back unprepared, she was worried she wouldn't be able to keep up with the company's current pace.  
So, she planned to spend some time familiarizing herself with the industry's latest developments before making a concrete decision.  
For the next few days, Celeste focused on her work during office hours and spent her evenings tending to her own matters. She didn't reach out to Jordyn or Trevor, and they didn't contact her either.  
Celeste wasn't surprised. For over half a year, her communication with them had been one-sided. They had only passively responded to her efforts.  
…  
Meanwhile, in Andostan, Jordyn had developed the habit of calling Wynn first thing every morning.  
That day, she called Wynn right after waking up as usual. However, the call didn't last long before she burst into tears.  
Wynn had told her some bad news. ""I'm going back to the country soon.""  
Devastated, Jordyn finished the call and immediately phoned Trevor. ""Dad, did you know about this?""  
At his office, Trevor flipped through some documents. ""Yes.""  
""When did you find out?""  
""It's been a while.""  
""Dad, you're so mean…"" Jordyn hugged her pink stuffed pig and cried loudly. ""I don't want Wynn to leave. If she's not here, I don't want to go to school here anymore. I want to go back too!""  
Trevor's tone remained even. ""It's already being arranged.""  
Jordyn didn't understand. ""W-What do you mean?""  
""We're going back next week.""  
Jordyn jumped out of bed in excitement. ""Really?""  
""Yes, really,"" Trevor replied.  
""Then why didn't Wynn tell me just now?""  
""It was just finalized. She doesn't know yet.""  
Jordyn was ecstatic. ""Dad, let's keep this a secret from Wynn. We'll surprise her when we go back to the country, okay?""  
""Alright.""  
""You're the best, Dad! I love you so much!""  
After hanging up, Jordyn was still overjoyed. She sang and danced on her bed.  
After a while, she suddenly thought of Celeste. For the past few days, she had been in a great mood because Celeste hadn't called her. In fact, to avoid talking to Celeste, she had deliberately left home early and even turned off her phone or kept it far away from her after school.  
But after two days, she was worried that Celeste might get angry if she found out. So, she stopped doing that. To her surprise, Celeste hadn't called at all in the days that followed.  
At first, she thought Celeste had discovered that she was deliberately avoiding her calls. But then she remembered that based on past experiences, that wasn't very likely. If Celeste knew she had done something wrong, she would immediately ask Jordyn to correct her wrongdoing instead of sulking and not calling.  
After all, she was the most important person to Celeste. Jordyn knew that Celeste loved her the most, so she didn't think that Celeste would purposely refrain from calling her simply because she was upset.  
As Jordyn thought about this, she suddenly missed Celeste. It was the first time in days she had thought about Celeste, and she couldn't resist dialing Celeste's number.  
But just as the call connected, she remembered that while she would get to see Wynn after returning to the country, Celeste would undoubtedly try every possible way to prevent her from meeting Wynn. She wouldn't be able to see Wynn whenever she wanted like she could now.  
This thought dampened Jordyn's mood.  
It was midnight in Celeste's time zone. She was already asleep when she was woken by the call. Upon seeing Jordyn's name on the screen, she was about to answer when the call abruptly disconnected.  
Although Celeste had written in her divorce agreement that she would relinquish custody of Jordyn, she still felt a sense of responsibility as her mother. Worried that something might have happened, Celeste immediately called back.  
When Jordyn saw the incoming call, she turned her head away and refused to answer.  
Celeste became more concerned and quickly called the landline at the villa.  
Hannah answered promptly. After hearing Celeste's concerns, she reassured her, ""Ms. Fleming should be fine. She went to bed late last night and woke up late today. When I checked earlier, she was still asleep. I'll go upstairs to take a look and call you back.""  
Feeling relieved, Celeste replied, ""Thank you.""  
When Hannah went upstairs, Jordyn was already in the bathroom brushing her teeth.  
After Hannah relayed Celeste being worried about her, Jordyn lowered her head and lied, ""I accidentally hit the call button.""  
Hannah believed her and didn't doubt what she said. Seeing that Jordyn was still brushing her teeth, she went back downstairs to update Celeste that Jordyn was fine.  
Jordyn watched as Hannah left. She huffed and finally felt a bit better.  
After hearing Hannah's reassurance, Celeste felt relieved too. Still, having been abruptly woken, she struggled to fall back asleep. She wasn't in great shape the next morning at work.  
The envelope containing the divorce agreement was completely forgotten by Trevor after the phone call with Wynn.  
On the day they returned to the country, Trevor packed the last document into his briefcase and ensured that nothing was left behind before heading downstairs.  
""All set. Let's go.""  
The Lincoln stretch limousine departed from the villa and headed to the airport.  
…  
That night, at around 10:00 pm, the plane carrying Trevor and Jordyn landed on time. By the time they got home, it was nearly midnight.  
Jordyn had fallen asleep before they arrived. When Trevor carried her upstairs, he passed the master bedroom and noticed the door was open, but the room was pitch black.  
After putting Jordyn on her bed and tucking her in, he returned to the master bedroom and turned on the light. Then, he glanced at the bed and found that it was empty—Celeste wasn't there.  
Just then, the butler, Peter Hawk, came upstairs with his luggage.  
Loosening his tie, Trevor asked, ""Where is she?""  
Peter replied, ""Mrs. Fleming is on a business trip.""  
Half a month ago, Peter hadn't been around when Celeste had left with her suitcase. The other maids told him that Celeste left with a suitcase, so he had assumed she was traveling for work.  
Now that he thought about it, this was unusual. Celeste rarely went on business trips. Even when she did, they typically lasted only two or three days.  
This time, she had been gone for over two weeks.  
""Alright,"" Trevor responded indifferently, asking no further questions.  
...  
The next day, Celeste unexpectedly ran into Trevor at the company. She hadn't known that Trevor and Jordyn had returned to the country. Caught off guard by their sudden encounter, Celeste froze mid-step.  
Trevor also seemed slightly surprised to see her, but he assumed she had just returned from the business trip and didn't think much of it.  
He passed by her coldly, his face expressionless. As usual, he treated her like she was a stranger and turned to enter the building.  
In the past, if Celeste had found out that he'd suddenly come back, she would have been overjoyed. Even if she couldn't throw herself into his arms in such a scenario, she would have been very happy and excited. Her eyes would light up as she greeted him.  
Even if Trevor remained indifferent, she would have smiled and wished him good morning enthusiastically.  
But now, Celeste merely glanced at his handsome face before lowering her eyes. There was no longer any trace of the joy and excitement she once felt.  
Trevor didn't notice any of this and was already walking away.  
Watching his tall and composed figure disappear into the building, Celeste wondered when he had returned. Since he was back, perhaps the matter of their divorce could soon be addressed.  
Having resolved to go through with the divorce, Celeste didn't dwell on him further. After she returned to her workstation, she quickly immersed herself in her work.  
Half an hour later, Zeke called her and instructed her to do something. ""Prepare two cups of coffee and take them to Mr. Fleming's office.""  
In the early days of her marriage, Celeste had learned that Trevor enjoyed coffee. In hopes of winning his favor, she had spent a great deal of effort studying how to brew it perfectly. Her efforts had paid off. After tasting her coffee, Trevor began to specifically request it, both at home and at the office.  
When she first realized he genuinely liked the coffee she made, Celeste had been thrilled. She naively believed it was the first step toward gaining his approval.  
But she had underestimated his dislike and wariness of her. While he liked her coffee, that was all he liked. His attitude toward her remained cold and distant.  
Even when he wanted her coffee, he would have Zeke reach out to her. Once the coffee was prepared, someone else would pick it up for him. He never gave her the opportunity to approach him herself.  
Only on rare occasions when no one else was available did she get the chance to deliver it to his office personally.  
This time, it seemed she was to take the coffee directly to Trevor herself from Zeke's tone. After brewing the coffee, Celeste placed the cups on a tray and carried them to his office.  
The door to his office was ajar.  
As she approached and was about to knock on the door politely, she saw Wynn sitting on Trevor's lap. The two of them seemed to be locked in a passionate kiss.  
Celeste stopped in her tracks, her face turning pale.  
Upon seeing her, Wynn shot up from Trevor's lap, looking flustered.  
Trevor's expression darkened, and he questioned in an icy tone, ""Who allowed you to come in?""",1,1753690745.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False
1mbajpk,https://i.redd.it/wzwg4qfxqkff1.jpeg,meet jonathyn,"this right here is my only OC, named after myself and modeled pretty much entirely after myself (i’m quite unimaginative) the only parts of her that are different from me irl are the lore and age (her being 23 me being 15 :P)

i’ll probably repost this with her redesign when i eventually draw the redesign just fyi

to sum her up she’s a judgmental, antisocial, socially anxious/awkward, tired, coffee addicted, lesbian bottom

her lore is that she’s a half succubus half angel raised in texas (she doesn’t know about the half angel part but has her suspicions) who was appointed the judge/high prosecutor of hell who is known as judgement by other demons (fun fact: i called her that before i got into the helltaker fandom, when i actually played helltaker i laughed my ass off because it also has a character named judgement who is the high prosecutor of hell). she doesn’t actually do a lot of, well *prosecuting* she may be judge, jury, and executioner of hell but satan was like “hey i know you’re the judge and all, but a lot of lesser demons have been getting to the mortal realm. and since you were raised up there you’re best suited for the job of rounding them up” so yeah, right now she’s border patrol for hell. she also suppresses her horns and tail currently (gonna change that in the redesign) she can’t suppress her wings though because they’re technically angelic in nature and the magic she’s using is demonic suppression

if you recognize her than it’s probably because i am quite active in r/OriginalCharacter_RP (i’m still debating whether or not to make her interactions with other characters there canon or not)

she is quite strong of course, i’m not getting into it because this is already really long, but anyway yeah that’s her. my only OC

feel free to ask questions about her or if you want i can answer questions *as* her, the answers won’t look very different though",1,1753690735.0,OriginalCharacter,0,1.0,False
1mbajj6,https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackNovel/comments/1mbajj6/his_celebrity_mistresss_downfall/,His Celebrity Mistress's Downfall,"I gave up my twenty-billion-dollar inheritance and cut ties with my family, all for my boyfriend of five years, Ignatz.

But just as I was about to tell him I was pr\*\*nant with our child, he dropped a bombshell.

He needed me to take the fall for his childhood sweetheart, Everleigh. She'd been in a hit-and-run, and her career couldn't handle the scandal.

When I refused and told him about our baby, his face went cold. He told me to terminate the pr\*\*nancy immediately.

""Everleigh is the woman I love,"" he said. ""Finding out you're pr\*\*nant with my child would destroy her.""

He had his assistant schedule the appointment and sent me to the clinic alone. There, the nurse told me the procedure carried a high risk of permanent infertility.

He knew. And he still sent me.

I walked out of that clinic, choosing to keep my child. At that exact moment, a news alert lit up my phone. It was a glowing article announcing that Ignatz and Everleigh were expecting their first child, complete with a photo of his hand resting protectively on her stomach.

My world shattered. Wiping away a tear, I found the number I hadn't called in five years.

""Dad,"" I whispered, my voice breaking. ""I'm ready to come home.""

Chapter 1  
""What did you just say?""

The question hung in the air of our minimalist apartment, the one I had designed. My voice was barely a wh\*\*per.

Ignatz Turner, my boyfriend of five years, didn't even look up from his phone. He just repeated it, calm and matter-of-fact.

""I said Everleigh needs you to take the blame. It was a hit-and-run, Gen. A minor one, nobody was seriously hurt, but her career can't handle a scandal right now.""

I stared at him, at the handsome face I had loved for so long. Now, it looked like a stranger's.

""You want me to say I was driving her car? That I hit someone and fled the scene?""

""It makes sense,"" he said, finally lifting his eyes. They were cool, rational. ""You're a private person, an architect. You don't have a public image to protect. You can handle the heat. Everleigh... she's fragile.""

My hands started to shake. ""Fragile? Ignatz, she broke the law. What about my record? My career?""

""It won't affect your career,"" he said, waving a dismissive hand. ""Our lawyers will handle it. A fine, maybe some community service. It's nothing.""

I felt a cold anger rise in my ch\*\*t. ""Nothing? Ignatz, do you have any idea what you're asking? I left my family for you. I gave up my name, my inheritance, everything, so we could have a normal life away from their influence. I did that for you.""

""And I appreciate that, Gen, I really do,"" he said, his voice softening. He stood up and came toward me, trying to take my hands. ""That's why I know you're strong enough to do this one more thing for us. For me.""

He was close now, his familiar scent filling my senses. It used to comfort me. Now it made me sick.

""There's something else,"" I said, my voice trembling as I backed away from his touch.

He stopped, a flicker of annoyance crossing his face. ""What now?""

""I'm pr\*\*nant.""

The words came out, quiet but heavy. I had just found out this morning. I had been planning a romantic dinner to tell him, to celebrate.

Ignatz froze. His charming expression vanished, replaced by a look I had never seen before-a cold, hard panic.

""No,"" he said.

""Yes. I took a test. I'm six weeks along.""

He ran a hand through his perfectly styled hair, pacing the room. ""This is a disaster. An absolute disaster.""

I laughed, a broken, hollow sound. Tears I didn't know were there started streaming down my face. ""A disaster? It's your baby, Ignatz.""

""Everleigh can't handle this right now!"" he snapped, turning on me. ""The stress of the accident, her anxiety... finding out you're pr\*\*nant with my child would destroy her. She's not strong like you, Gen. She needs my full support.""

""So I'm the one who gets sacrificed? Again?"" The words were squeezed out from between my teeth. ""My life, my reputation, and now... our baby?""

He stopped pacing and looked at me, his eyes now holding a chilling sort of pity. ""We can't have this baby. Not now.""

My world tilted. The floor felt like it was dropping out from under me. ""What are you saying?""

""I'm saying you need to terminate it,"" he said, his voice dropping to a low, persuasive tone. ""It's for the best. For everyone. Once this all blows over with Everleigh, we can try again. It's just... bad timing.""

The air left my lungs. He was talking about our child like it was an inconvenient appointment to be rescheduled.

""It's your child, Ignatz,"" I whispered, my voice hoarse. ""Your bl\*\*d.""

""And Everleigh is the woman I love!"" he yelled, his composure finally cracking. ""She's sensitive! This would break her! Can't you understand that?""

I just stared at him, my mind a blank wall of pain. After a long, silent moment, a sad, twisted smile formed on my lips.

""Okay,"" I said. ""Okay, Ignatz.""

Relief washed over his face. He didn't see the emptiness behind my eyes.

Just then, his phone rang, a cheerful pop song I recognized as one of Everleigh's hits. He answered it immediately.

""Leigh? Hey, baby, what's wrong? Don't cry, I'm on my way. I'm coming right now.""

His voice was a gentle, loving ca\*\*ss. A voice he hadn't used with me in years.

He hung up and grabbed his keys, not even glancing at me as he rushed to the door.

""I'll have my assistant schedule the appointment for you,"" he said over his shoulder. ""Just do it quickly.""

Then he was gone. The door clicked shut, leaving me in a silence that was louder than his shouting.

The next day, I was at the clinic. The air smelled of antiseptic and quiet despair. The nurse who took my information looked at me with pity in her eyes. It made my skin crawl.

She handed me a clipboard with a consent form. His signature was already there at the bottom: Ignatz Turner. He had signed it this morning, before he even knew if I'd agree. He was so sure of me.

""The doctor wants you to know,"" the nurse said softly, avoiding my gaze, ""that due to a minor complication, this procedure carries a high risk of future infertility. There's a chance you might not be able to conceive again.""

The clipboard slipped from my numb fingers and clattered to the floor.

He knew. He must have known. The doctor would have told his assistant, and his assistant would have told him. He knew this could leave me barren, and he still signed the form. He still sent me here to erase our child and my future.

I bit down on my lip, hard. The coppery taste of bl\*\*d filled my mouth, but I felt nothing. Just a vast, cold emptiness.

I was ready to go through with it. To just get it over with, to cut out the last piece of him inside me. I stood up to follow the nurse.

And then I felt it.

A tiny, unmistakable flutter deep in my womb. It was too early for a real kick, the doctor had said. But I felt it. A flicker of life, a silent protest.

Don't let me go.

""No,"" I said, my voice loud and clear in the quiet room.

The nurse turned, surprised.

""I'm not doing it,"" I said, pulling my arm away. ""I'm keeping my baby.""

I walked out of that clinic, leaving the consent form on the floor. The afternoon sun was blindingly bright, and for a moment, I felt a surge of strength. I had my baby. That's all that mattered.

Then I pulled out my phone. The screen lit up with a breaking news alert from a celebrity gossip site.

The headline was a punch to the gut: ""Everleigh Hooper and Boyfriend Ignatz Turner Expecting First Child! Sources say Hooper is overjoyed after a recent health scare.""

The article was filled with pictures of them from last night, leaving a fancy restaurant. Ignatz was holding her, his hand placed protectively on her flat stomach. They were both smiling, glowing for the cameras.

Below the article, the comments section was a sewer.

""Who is that Genevieve Ball person? The one who did the hit-and-run in Everleigh's car? Probably some obsessed fan Ignatz felt sorry for.""

""I heard she's been stalking him for years. Good thing he's finally with someone on his level.""

""She looks so plain. Of course he chose a star like Everleigh. And now they're starting a family! So happy for them!""

I bit my lip again, harder this time. I felt the skin break, the warm trickle of bl\*\*d down my chin. But I still couldn't feel the pain. I was completely numb.

I looked down at my own stomach, and a single tear rolled down my cheek and fell onto my hand.

""It's okay,"" I whispered to the tiny life inside me. ""I'll protect you. I promise.""

I wiped my face, my expression hardening. I opened my contacts and found my lawyer's number.

""I need you to draw up divorce papers,"" I said, my voice steady and cold. ""And I want everything I'm entitled to.""

Chapter 2  
When I got back to the apartment, the front door was slightly ajar. A knot of dread tightened in my stomach. I pushed it open slowly.

The sound of soft laughter drifted from the living room.

There, on the custom-made sofa I had picked out, sat Everleigh Hooper. Ignatz was sitting on the coffee table in front of her, feeding her a strawberry. She giggled and leaned forward to k\*\*s him.

It was a perfectly staged, in\*\*mate moment. And I had just walked in on it.

Ignatz saw me first. His smile faltered for a second, his eyes hardening. ""Gen.""

Everleigh looked over, her big, innocent eyes widening. She immediately shrank back against the cushions, making herself look small and scared.

""Gen, can you give us a minute?"" Ignatz said, keeping his voice low, as if I were an intruder. ""Everleigh isn't feeling well. I'll come to the guest room later.""

I let out a short, sharp laugh. ""The guest room? Ignatz, this is my apartment. My name is on the lease. If anyone should leave, it's her.""

He stood up, his expression turning pleading. ""Please, just for tonight. You know how she is. We grew up together, I've always taken care of her. She needs me right now.""

He was trying to appeal to the part of me that had always made excuses for him, for their ""special"" bond.

""I'll get her a hotel tomorrow, I promise,"" he said, his voice a low murmur. ""We'll sort this out.""

I didn't say another word. I just turned and walked to the spare bedroom, closing the door behind me.

I couldn't block out the sounds. A few minutes later, I heard their laughter again, louder this time, mixed with the sound of the TV. They were settling in for the night. In my home.

I curled up on the bed, not bothering to change. The tears I had held back all day finally came, soaking the pillow in the dark.

Much later, I heard the bedroom door creak open. A shadow fell across the bed.

""Gen? Are you awake?"" It was Ignatz, his voice a guilty wh\*\*per.

He sat on the edge of the bed, his weight making the mattress dip. He reached out and touched my hair.

""I'm sorry about today,"" he said, his voice thick. ""It's just a lot to deal with. The baby... we'll have another one, Gen. When the time is right, I swear.""

I lay perfectly still, my body rigid. He didn't know. He thought I had gone through with it. He was apologizing for the inconvenience, not the monstrous thing he had asked of me. The irony was a bitter pill in my throat.

Suddenly, a sharp scream came from the living room. ""Iggy! Iggy, where are you?""

Ignatz shot up from the bed as if he'd been electrocuted. ""Leigh?""

""I had a nightmare!"" she wailed. ""Come back!""

Without a second thought, without another glance at me, he bolted from the room. ""I'm coming, Leigh! I'm here!""

For the rest of the night, the sound of his low, soothing voice drifted down the hallway as he comforted her, leaving me alone in the dark.

The next morning, I dragged my exhausted body out of bed. The smell of coffee and bacon filled the air. For a delusional second, it felt like any other morning.

Then I walked into the kitchen.

Ignatz was at the stove, flipping pancakes. Everleigh was perched on a stool, wearing one of his expensive silk shirts, her bare legs dangling. She was laughing as he playfully dabbed a bit of whipped cream on her nose.

They looked like a happy couple in a coffee commercial. I was the ghost haunting the set.

Everleigh saw me and her bright smile vanished. She instantly adopted her frightened-doe look, clutching Ignatz's arm. ""Oh. Genevieve. You're up.""

""Iggy,"" she whispered, loud enough for me to hear. ""I want orange juice. Freshly squeezed.""

""Of course, Leigh. Anything you want,"" Ignatz said, turning to the fridge without a single glance in my direction.

The moment he was busy with the juicer, Everleigh's entire demeanor changed. The fear melted away, replaced by a smug, triumphant smirk. She looked directly at me.

""He was so disappointed when he thought you were pr\*\*nant,"" she said, her voice a syrupy poison. ""He told me he never wanted kids with you. He said the thought of it made his skin crawl.""

I froze, my hand on the counter. My head snapped up to look at her. My fingers trembled.

""You think you can win?"" she continued, her voice dripping with contempt. ""I'm Everleigh Hooper. My uncle is one of the most powerful producers in Hollywood. Who are you? A no-name architect he picked up out of pity.""

My bl\*\*d ran cold. I knew her uncle was influential. I hadn't realized how much. That's why Ignatz was so desperate to protect her. It wasn't just love; it was ambition. She was his ticket to a world he craved.

Suddenly, Everleigh let out a sharp cry and slid off the stool, collapsing onto the floor. ""Ahh! My ankle!"" she shrieked, clutching it. ""Genevieve, why did you push me?""

Ignatz spun around, his face a mask of fury. He saw me standing near her, saw her on the floor, and didn't hesitate. He lunged forward and shoved me, hard.

""What the h\*\*l is wrong with you?"" he roared.

I stumbled backward, my hip slamming into the corner of the kitchen island. A sharp, searing pain shot through my side. I gasped, clutching the spot.

He didn't even notice. He was already on the floor, cradling Everleigh in his arms. ""Are you okay, Leigh? Did she hurt you?""

He looked up at me, his eyes filled with a cold, terrifying hatred. ""She's fragile, you id\*\*t! I told you that!""

""I... I didn't touch her,"" I stammered, the pain making my voice shake.

""Get out of my sight,"" he snarled, his voice low and dangerous. ""Don't you ever touch her again. I'm warning you, Genevieve.""

He scooped Everleigh up into his arms and carried her out of the kitchen, leaving me standing there, trembling with pain and shock.

My hand went instinctively to my stomach, a silent prayer that the baby was okay.

This was my home. And I had just been declared the enemy.

Chapter 3  
Ignatz didn't come back for two days. I spent the time in a daze, moving through the silent apartment like a zombie. I took down our pictures, packing his clothes into boxes. I even took off my wedding ring. It slid off my finger with no resistance. I had lost so much weight, I hadn't even noticed.

I dropped it into the tr\*\*h can. It made a dull, final thud.

Then, a text message from him lit up my phone.

Can you do me a favor? There's a blue velvet box in my top drawer. A courier is coming to pick it up in an hour. Have it ready for him.

I went to his drawer. Inside was a small, elegant box from a famous jewelry designer. I opened it. Nestled on the black velvet was a diamond necklace, the kind of ostentatious piece I would never wear. I remembered him showing it to me online months ago.

""Isn't it beautiful?"" he'd said. ""I'm going to buy it for the most important person in my life.""

I had thought he meant me.

Staring at the necklace, a bitter laugh escaped my lips. I closed the box.

When the courier arrived, a young man in a crisp uniform, I handed him the package without a word.

""Ma'am, the destination is the St. Regis Hotel,"" he said, confirming the details.

""I know,"" I said, pulling my purse from the hook by the door. I took out the folded divorce agreement. ""I'm going with you.""

The car ride was silent. The St. Regis was hosting a massive press conference for Everleigh's new movie. As we pulled up, I could hear the roar of the crowd and the frantic clicking of cameras.

I walked into the ballroom. The noise died down instantly. Every head turned. Every camera swiveled to face me. I was wearing a simple dress and no makeup. My hair was pulled back in a messy bun.

Whispers erupted around me.

""Is that her? The stalker?""

""What is she doing here? Look at how she's dressed. No class.""

I ignored them all. My eyes were fixed on the stage at the front of the room, where Ignatz and Everleigh were standing, holding hands.

Ignatz saw me, and his face tightened into a knot of anger. ""Genevieve? What the h\*\*l are you doing here?"" he hissed as I approached.

I didn't answer. I just held out the blue velvet box.

""You forgot this,"" I said, my voice surprisingly steady.

Everleigh snatched the box from my hand and opened it with a g\*\*p of delight. ""Oh, Iggy! It's beautiful!""

She turned to him, pouting. ""Put it on me. Right now.""

Ignatz hesitated for a fraction of a second, his eyes darting between me and her. Then, his face hardened, and he took the necklace. His fingers brushed against her skin as he fastened the clasp.

Everleigh leaned in and ki\*\*ed him full on the lips, her eyes locked on me the entire time. It was a declaration of victory.

I stood there, silent.

Then, she did it again. She let out a tiny g\*\*p and staggered, pretending to lose her balance. ""Oh!""

""Gen, I warned you!"" Ignatz roared, lunging forward to steady Everleigh. He glared at me, his face contorted with rage. ""Are you trying to hurt her?""

I said nothing. I just held out the divorce agreement I had been clutching in my hand.

He barely glanced at it. Everleigh suddenly clutched her stomach. ""Iggy, I don't feel well. My stomach hurts.""

""What?"" His attention snapped back to her, all thoughts of me and the papers gone. ""Okay, baby, okay. Let's get you to the hospital.""

""The papers, Iggy,"" I said, holding them out again. ""Sign them.""

""Just sign it so she'll leave!"" Everleigh mo\*\*ed, pressing herself against him.

Without even reading it, he snatched a pen from a nearby table, scribbled his name on the line, and shoved the document back at me.

Then he swept Everleigh into his arms and started pushing his way through the crowd of reporters. ""Let us through! It's an emergency!""

I clutched the signed papers to my ch\*\*t and turned to leave. As I walked away, someone deliberately stuck out a foot.

I went down, hard.

My head hit the marble floor with a sickening crack. The world exploded in a flash of white-hot pain.

I heard gasps from the crowd. Through a haze of pain, I saw Ignatz stop and look back. He took a half-step toward me, his face a mess of confusion.

""Iggy, let's go!"" Everleigh whined, tugging on his arm. ""She's just faking it for attention.""

He looked from me, lying on the floor with bl\*\*d starting to pool around my head, to her. He hesitated for one more second.

Then he turned and left, disappearing into the flashing lights of the paparazzi.

I lay there, the polished floor cold against my cheek. My vision was blurring. People were staring, whispering, pointing. No one moved to help.

With a gr\*\*n, I pushed myself up. My head was spinning. I realized my wedding ring was gone. It must have flown off when I fell. The ring that had been so loose on my finger. A symbol of a marriage that had been hollow for a long, long time.

I didn't even look for it.

Ignoring the stares and the cameras, I stumbled to my feet, my legs shaking. I walked, one foot in front of the other, out of the ballroom and into the street.

I flagged down a taxi. The driver's eyes went wide when he saw the bl\*\*d on my face.

""Hospital?"" he asked, his voice full of alarm.

I wiped a smear of bl\*\*d from my cheek with the back of my hand.

""Yeah,"" I said, a grim smile touching my lips. ""But I'm not gonna die.""

Chapter 4  
The emergency room doctor was gentle as she stitched the gash on my forehead. ""You need to be more careful,"" she said, her brow furrowed with concern. ""A fall like that could have been much worse, especially..."" She trailed off, glancing at my chart.

Before she could finish, the TV in the corner of the waiting area, which had been murmuring quietly, suddenly blared to life with a ""Breaking News"" graphic.

My face filled the screen. It was a grainy cell phone video of me on the floor of the ballroom.

""Sources inside the St. Regis claim Genevieve Ball, ex-girlfriend of mogul Ignatz Turner, staged a dramatic fall today in an attempt to win him back,"" the anchor said in a grave voice. ""This comes on the heels of new reports alleging Ms. Ball has a history of erratic behavior and infidelity.""

The world went dark at the edges. I gripped the side of the hospital bed to keep from fainting.

Before I could even process the slander, the door to my curtained-off cubicle was thrown open with a deafening bang.

Meredith Turner, Ignatz's mother, stood there, her face a mask of pure fury.

""You little wh\*\*e!"" she screamed, lunging at me. Her hand connected with my cheek in a vicious slap that sent my head ringing.

Before I could react, two large men, bodyguards I recognized, grabbed my arms. They hauled me off the bed, ignoring the doctor's protests.

""What are you doing? She's my patient!""

""Get out of the way,"" Meredith snarled at her, and they dragged me out of the hospital, my bare feet scraping against the pavement.

They threw me into the back of a black SUV and drove to an old, abandoned warehouse on the industrial outskirts of the city. They dragged me inside and threw me onto the filthy concrete floor.

""Kneel,"" Meredith commanded, her voice echoing in the cavernous space.

I tried to scramble away, but the bodyguards forced me down. My knees hit the cold, hard ground with a painful crack.

Meredith pulled out her phone and dialed. ""Ignatz,"" she said, her voice dripping with venom. ""Your pathetic wife is here, making a scene. She's brought shame on our entire family.""

I could hear Ignatz's panicked voice on the other end of the line. ""Mom, what did you do? Where are you?""

""Don't you worry about it,"" she sneered. ""I'm just teaching this little tramp the lesson you've been too soft to teach her. You can't be this soft, son. She's been cheating on you, playing you for a fool!""

""Ignatz!"" I screamed, desperate for him to hear me. ""It's not true! I'm pr\*\*nant! She's lying!""

There was a pause on the other end. Then, Ignatz's voice came through, low and defeated. ""Gen... just do what she says. I'll make it up to you later. I promise.""

The line went dead.

Hope died with it.

They left me there, kneeling in the stifling heat of the unventilated warehouse. Sweat and bl\*\*d trickled down my face, dripping onto the dusty floor. Hours passed.

Then, a sudden, sharp cramp seized my abdomen. It was a pain so intense it stole my breath. I looked down. A dark, wet patch was spreading on the thin fabric of my dress.

No. No, no, no.

Panic, raw and primal, clawed at my throat. I scrambled to the massive steel door and banged on it with my fists.

""Help! Please, somebody help me! My baby!""

I could hear Meredith's voice from the other side, cold and dismissive. ""What baby? That little ba\*\*ard? Let it die. It was never welcome in the Turner family anyway.""

""It's Ignatz's baby!"" I shrieked, my voice cracking with desperation. ""It's your grandchild!""

The only answer was the sound of her footsteps walking away, fading into silence.

I was alone.

I spent the night on that cold floor, bleeding in the dark, the pain in my belly a relentless, tearing agony.

When the sun came up, the door finally opened. One of the bodyguards looked down at me, his face impassive. ""Mrs. Turner said we can take you to a hospital now.""

The next thing I knew, I was on an operating table. The lights were too bright, the voices around me were muffled. I felt a profound coldness spreading through me, a sense of something precious being irrevocably lost.

As they wheeled me into a recovery room, my phone, which had been in my purse, buzzed on the bedside table. It was a text from Ignatz.

I'm so sorry, Gen. Mom went too far. But you have to understand her position. This has been so hard on all of us.

A single, hot tear slid from the corner of my eye and traced a path through the grime on my face. My fingers trembled as I picked up the phone.

A few hours later, a lawyer I didn't recognize delivered a crisp, white envelope. Inside was my divorce certificate, officially stamped. It was over.

I scrolled through my contacts, my thumb hovering over a name I hadn't called in five years. A name that represented a life I had thrown away.

I pressed the call button.

It rang twice.

""Well, look who it is,"" a deep, male voice said, laced with a familiar, teasing smile. ""I was beginning to think you'd forgotten all about me.""

""Kaleb,"" I whispered, my voice breaking. ""I need help.""

""I know,"" he said, his tone instantly serious. ""I'm already on my way. Dad's with me. Just hang on, Gen. We're coming to bring you home.""

I'm a 35-year-old man, based in India, and until very recently, I was in a serious, long-term relationship with my 33-year-old girlfriend. We'd been together for over three years, and while we had our ups and downs like most couples, I genuinely thought we were headed towards something lasting maybe even marriage.

A few months ago, my girlfriend joined a local gym to focus more on her health something I completely supported. She seemed happier, more active, and energetic. I even encouraged her to chase her fitness goals, and I'm proud of how far she came physically. But over time, I began noticing changes.

She became more distant, spent a lot more time glued to her phone, and was often ""too tired"" to meet or talk like before. Initially, I chalked it up to the pressure of her new routine and work. But the emotional distance kept growing. My gut started picking up on something being ""off.""

Eventually, a mutual acquaintance who also goes to that gym casually mentioned seeing her out with her trainer outside of gym hours grabbing coffee, sometimes sharing rides. That got me curious. I didn’t want to jump to conclusions, but I couldn’t ignore the red flags anymore.

Long story short, after confronting her and pressing for the truth (with some evidence I gathered), she admitted to having developed feelings for her trainer and that the emotional boundary had long been crossed. She tried to spin it as a “spur-of-the-moment” weakness, but this wasn’t a one-time thing. It had been going on for over two months.

To say I was shattered would be putting it mildly. I ended the relationship immediately. This isn't the kind of trust you can rebuild, especially when it was broken so carelessly.

Now, it’s been a few weeks since the breakup. Some days I feel okay. Other days, I feel this hollow ache that I can’t quite describe. I keep replaying moments in my head, wondering where I might have failed was I not good enough? Did I miss signs too early?

If any of you have been through something similar how did you cope? How do you rebuild after something like this? Friends say time heals everything, but right now, even getting through a week feels like a challenge.

We cry in drafts.  
We hint at emotional collapse via font choices and cold coffee aesthetics.

No dramatic announcement.  
Just subtle signs:

* Posting “need a reset” over a sunset reel.
* Reposting that tweet: “Normalize not being okay.”
* Sharing an article about burnout like it’s not screaming your name in every paragraph.

People reply with

But we don’t.  
Because talking means unpacking.  
And unpacking feels like another to-do list we’ll never finish.

So we pretend we’re fine.  
We show up to Zoom calls with camera off and voice on 20%.  
We reply to “How are you?” with “Haha tired lol” — the international language of spiraling.

I miss when being tired just meant “I didn’t sleep.”  
Now it means:  
I’m disillusioned.  
Overstimulated.  
Emotionally dehydrated.  
But still expected to answer emails with smiley faces.

And the worst part?  
I don’t even want to quit.  
I just want someone to say:

1mbaeq2,https://i.redd.it/jcr01xz7pkff1.jpeg,Writing a story.,"Hi redditors, well I'm new to reddit so I don't really know how to make these posts.

I'm making a book to pay my stepdad back alot of money I owe him. I'm quite young for a author, but I think me making money from writing, which I love alot, would help with my family.

The book I'm writing is about a girl named Celina, she's the main protagonist, she's in a small town called Ash Wood, she works in a small coffee shop and is really just a simple girl.

But one day after a long shift at the coffee shop her parents die in a freak accident at work. But Celina thinks this makes no sense, so she investigates the scene for herself and tried to solve how her parents died!

The book is called Autumn Ashes, The Night My Parents Died. On Wattpad. 

(If it doesn't come up then just search 'Autumn Ashes')

If you like Nancy Drew like books, then this might be the book for you! The chapters are mid-length, and builds up to the climax of the story. 

If there's any mistakes or suggestions, I will gladly take them to mind. Thanks for your time if anyone reads this!

1mbacie,https://www.reddit.com/r/Novelnews/comments/1mbacie/please_help_me_find_this_one/,Please help me find this one 🙏,"Five years into their marriage, Aurelia finally discovered a secret.
Caleb, the little boy she'd been raising as her own, wasn't hers at all!
She accidentally overhears her husband Cassian, talking with the doctor.
""Mr. Thornwell, the kid's got a really rare blood type. His biological mother must come here ASAP.""
Cassian pinched the bridge of his nose, looking exhausted. 
""Yeah, okay,I know. I'll... I'll figure something out.""
The words hit Aurelia like a bolt of lightning, her mind going completely blank.
Biological mother? But she was his biological mother... wasn't she?

Standing there in the hallway, she slowly pieced together what they were really talking about. 

The man who'd promised to love her forever had been cheating even before their wedding—and had switched their babies!

But why would he do this to her? They'd known each other since they were kids, grew up together in the same neighborhood.

She'd given up everything for him—her job at the marketing firm, her dreams of starting her own business—just to be his wife and stay home with Caleb. 

When she told him, Cassian had actually gotten down on one knee right there in their kitchen, tears streaming down his face.

""Baby, you're giving up so much for us. I swear to God, I'll never let you down. Never.""

Those words were still ringing in her ears, but reality had just bit//ch-slapped her across the face.

She stumbled back toward Caleb's room, feeling like someone was squeezing her heart with a vise grip. 

She couldn't even look at him now—terrified she might drag him off for a DNA test,afraid she'd lose it completely and make a scene.

She turned and bolted from the hospital.

Outside in the parking lot, her brother Silas was just getting out of his car. Seeing her rushing past, he quickly caught her arm.

""Whoa, Aurelia! Where are you going? You look like you've seen a ghost.""

""How's Caleb? I came to check on him.""

Ever since Caleb got sick, their whole family had been freaking out. Silas had even blown off a board meeting in Tokyo and flown back on the private jet...

Aurelia's eyes were red and puffy, tears already spilling over. ""Silas, I need you to look into something for me.""

""Sure, what's up?""

""Caleb..."" Her voice cracked. ""I don't think... I don't think he's actually mine.""

...

""Hey baby, where'd you disappear to? Caleb woke up asking for his mommy.""

Staring at Cassian's text, Aurelia read her tears hit the phone screen.

Every December, he'd take Caleb up to their cabin in Aspen for a week. ""Guy time,"" he'd call it. ""Father-son bonding.""

Four years of this nonsense, and she'd never questioned it once.

Now she felt like the world's biggest fool. It wasn't father-son bonding—he was taking Caleb to see his biological mom!

If she hadn't overheard that conversation today, she'd probably still be living this lie.

Aurelia frantically scrolled through her camera roll—hundreds of happy family photos flashing by. The California sun was blazing outside, but she felt freezing cold, shaking like a leaf.

Maybe she should've seen this coming. Men's promises weren't worth the breath they wasted making them.

Being a selfish asshole was just in their DNA, especially guys like Cassian. CEO of a Fortune 500 company, movie-star looks, family money going back generations—he could have anyone woman.

So he'd thrown her away like yesterday's garbage. Her and her baby.

But he'd sworn he'd never hurt her...

It felt like someone was taking a rusty knife to her heart, carving her up piece by piece.

They'd been together since high school. Everyone in their social circle knew how obsessed he was with her.

When she was fourteen and some creeps from the school were hassling her outside the mall, Cassian had taken on all six of them by himself. 

He'd ended up in the ER with a broken nose and three cracked ribs, but the first thing he asked was, ""Good job?""

At eighteen, when she forgot to text him back during a sorority mixer, he'd called campus security, her friends, even her parents. 

When he finally found her, he'd been crying harder than she'd ever seen.

At twenty-two, he'd gotten his grandmother's engagement ring from the family safe—a five-carat diamond that had been in the Thornwell family for generations.

""Marry me, Aurelia. I'll never hurt you, I promise.""

The way he'd looked at her that day, like she was his entire world—so she'd said ‘yes’ without hesitation.

She got pregnant six months after the wedding.

Cassian had completely lost it with happiness, calling everyone they knew. He'd even taken a leave of absence from Thornwell Industries.

""I want to be there for every second of this,"" he'd told her. ""Every prenatal appointment, every craving, everything.""

His dad had threatened to kick him off the Thornwell family. 

The board members thought he'd lost his mind. 

But Cassian had stood his ground, even when his father called him a ""playbpy embarrassment to the family name.""

Now she realized the truth—he wasn't trying to take care of her. He was making sure nothing happened to her pregnancy so he could pull off his sick little baby swap.

Her phone buzzed with an incoming FaceTime call. ""Hubby"" flashed on the screen, and she wanted to throw up.

She answered with a dead expression.

Cassian's face filled the screen, still as gorgeous as ever, which somehow made this worse.

""There you are! Jesus, baby, you look awful. Are you okay?""

Before all this, she would've told him everything. Every bad day, every worry, every time someone looked at her wrong—she'd run straight to Cassian to fix it.

Now she couldn't stand any sight of him.

""Aurelia? Have you been crying? Where are you? I'm coming to pick you right now.""

Cassian was already reaching for his keys, looking genuinely panicked.

""It's ok. Just grabbing coffee."" She was too emotionally drained to even pretend anymore. ""I'll be back in a few.""

He relaxed a little, but his eyes kept darting off-camera. After a weird pause, he said, ""Okay, but don't take too long. Caleb keeps asking when Mommy's coming back.""

""Yeah, okay.""

Just as she was about to hang up, a hot woman walked into frame and casually settled onto Cassian's lap like she belonged there.

Aurelia's blood turned to ice. Before she could even process what she was seeing, the call went dead.

She sat there staring at the blank screen. Then she started hitting herself in the ch//est with her fists, trying to make the pain stop, but it just kept getting worse.

He was with that woman. Right there in their son's hospital room.

She buried her face in her hands, trying not to completely break down in public, but the sobs came anyway.

This was what rock bottom felt like. This was what happened when your entire life turned out to be a lie.

For about two seconds, she'd tried to convince herself that maybe Cassian was the victim here. Maybe some bit//ch was obsessing over him, manipulating him somehow.

But he'd looked pretty comfortable with her on his lap.

Silas noticed her breakdown and rushed over, his iced latte forgotten on the counter.

""Hey, hey... Aurelia, look at me."" He crouched down next to her chair, his voice gentle but furious. ""That asshole doesn't deserve your tears.""

The tears just kept coming, leaving dark spots all over her white sundress.

Silas looked like he wanted to murder someone. He rubbed her back awkwardly—he'd never been good with crying women, even his own sister.

""Listen to me, okay? We're gonna get your real baby back. I don't care what it takes, how much it costs, or who I have to destroy to make it happen.""

His voice got harder. ""And Cassian? He's gonna pay for what he did to you. But right now, I need to know—what do you want to do? Because whatever you decide, I've got your back.""

Aurelia looked up at him through her tears and nodded. The moment she'd learned of Cassian's betrayal, she'd already made up her mind...

Aurelia spent the entire night in that 24-hour Starbucks, just sitting there thinking.

She'd given up everything for Cassian—her job at Marc Jacobs, her own fashion line that was about to launch, her whole identity. All to play games with him.

But she was still Aurelia Westvale. 

Her family owned half of Manhattan's real estate, and she'd graduated top of her class from Parsons. 

Even Vogue had been courting her before she threw it all away to be a wife and mom.

So yeah, she was destroyed right now. But she wasn't done.

She scrolled through her contacts and called her best friend in Zurich.

""Elena? Remember how you said your company was looking for a new creative director? Is that still open?""

There was a pause. ""Wait, are you serious? What about Mr. Perfect? Cassian would lose his mind if you moved to Europe.""

""Well, that's not really his call anymore."" Aurelia's voice was flat. ""We're getting divorced.""

""What?! Did he cheat? I swear to God, if that asshole—""

""I'll explain everything when I get there. Can you send me the job application? I want to get my visa sorted ASAP.""

After they hung up, Aurelia splashed cold water on her face in the bathroom and got to work.

First stop: the NYPD. She filed a missing persons report for her real child, practically begging the detective to put it at the top of his list. Then she hired the most expensive private investigator in the city.

Next: her family's law firm. She had them draft divorce papers that would absolutely demolish Cassian if he tried to fight her on custody or assets.

With all that handled, she touched up her makeup and headed back to Mount Sinai.

She had to play it cool for now. 

If Cassian suspected anything, he'd try to stop her from leaving America. And he'd definitely make sure she never found her own baby.

Plus, even knowing the truth, walking away from Caleb was going to destroy her. She'd been his mom for four years.

But when she got to his room, she realized she'd been worried about nothing...

Before she even reached the door, she could hear a little kid giggling inside.

Through the window, she saw some woman spoon-feeding Caleb applesauce, both of them laughing like they were having the best time ever.

Aurelia's stomach dropped. The woman was wearing a black wrap dress—the same one from yesterday's FaceTime call.

Everything suddenly made perfect sense, and she felt like she might throw up right there in the hallway.

She was about to turn around and leave when she spotted Cassian practically sprinting down the corridor toward her.

He looked like absolute he//ll—wrinkled clothes, bloodshot eyes, stubble. Like he'd been up all night.

Which was weird, because she'd been gone all night. Shouldn't he have been busy with his sexy side piece?

Before she could figure that out, he was pulling her into his arms.

He still used the same Tom Ford cologne. Well,it used to make her feel safe and loved.

Now it just made her sick!

""Thank God! Baby, where were you? I've been calling you all night—your phone kept going straight to voicemail!""

His arms were shaking as he held her. ""I know you're freaking out about Caleb, but he's okay now. They got him the transfusion he needed. He's gonna be fine.""

Cassian's panic seemed genuine, but at this point, she didn't trust anything about him.

The thing that was killing her was that she still didn't understand why. Why cheat on her? Why switch their babies? He'd promised her forever.

She bit her lip hard enough to taste blood, swallowing down all the accusations she wanted to scream at him.

But what was the point? She'd find her own baby, and this asshole?Get lost!

""I'm fine’’ my phone died. I fell asleep at Starbucks and didn't wake up till like an hour ago.""

The relief on his face was almost convincing. ""Jesus, you can't just disappear like that!""

His voice was so gentle, so loving. The same voice that used to whisper sweet things to her in the dark.

But she caught him glancing toward the hospital room, where Miss Cocktail Dress was still sitting by Caleb's bed, staring them.

The next second, Cassian was gently pushing her away.

""Look,you're exhausted. Why don't you go home and rest? Caleb's being taken care of, so don't worry about anything.""

Aurelia almost laughed. She wasn't stupid—he was trying to get rid of her.

Whatever. Her heart was already broken anyway.

She nodded coldly and turned to leave, but the hospital room door opened and the woman came out.

""Mrs. Thornwell? Hi, I'm Verena Dorne. Cassian...Mr. Thornwell helped pay for my nursing school a few years back. We've actually met before.""

The girl was young and hot, with the kind of fresh-faced beauty Aurelia remembered having at that age.

Aurelia didn't say a word. She just gave Verena one ice-cold look and walked away.

But as soon as she reached the parking garage, her phone buzzed with a text from an unknown number.

(PART 1)
  -ALL UNITS, POSSIBLE HOMICIDE NEAR THE CLOVE HOOF FOREST…BE ADVISED-
K-9 units swarmed an old patch of thick forest sitting just outside of the main road. It was dark, maybe around nine or ten in the evening with a dark cloud of rain spreading through the already dim sky. 
I got out of my car, pulling out a pair of gloves and my camera before stepping into the open scene. 
“What’s the situation?” I asked. A sheriff deputy joined me, walking alongside me wordlessly. 
“Male, twenty-two years old presumably, found dead in the forest here with ligature marks around his neck and wrists. Coroners are ruling it out as a suicide right now, but they’re finding more evidence to suggest otherwise,” he told me. 
I wandered around the site, pulling gloves onto my cold hands as I looked around to figure out where to start. I settled on a back site near an old oak tree. It was strange to me, seeing one single oak tree in a sea of redwoods, so I walked toward it. I took the camera hanging from my neck, snapping a photo of the tree before walking the base of it. I wandered around, only stopping when I saw a noose dangling from a tall branch. 
“Clancy! Come here a minute!” I hollered to one of the coroners. He jogged over as I stared at the noose. I wanted to touch it, some child-like wonder made me want to grab it and hold on. 
I waited for Clancy to meet me at the tree, he walked over, evidence bag in hand, staring at the noose. 
“I’m not fucking touching it,” he told me, staring at the branch. I rolled my eyes, pulling a second pair of gloves on just in case. 
He held the bag open, letting me reach up to grab it. I reached up, grabbing it off of the branch when everything turned black. 
I woke up on the wet, cold ground with multiple coroners and sheriff deputies standing over me like I was the vic. I was still holding the noose in my hands, fingers wrapped tightly around it.
“What-what the fuck? What happened?” I asked, confused. 
“You had a seizure or something. You grabbed the noose and you locked up and fell to the ground,” Clancy told me. I sat up slowly, still holding the stupid noose. I handed it to Clancy, the bag held out awkwardly in front of him. 
I stood up on shaky legs as I started to walk back to my car. I sat in the driver’s seat for a minute, watching the scene illuminated by flood lights set up on the spongy forest floor. 
Clancy walked over to me, leaning on the car door without saying a word. 
“Are you on drugs, mark?” He asked me. I stared at him for a minute, bursting out laughing soon after. I looked back up to him, seeing his face stone cold, serious. 
“Uh-no, no I’m not,” I told him sincerely. 
“Go to the hospital, get checked out, figure out what the hell happened to you,” he told me, patting the car door before walking away. I sighed, turning my car over to leave the site. 
I spent the next few hours in the hospital, getting checked out to see what actually happened. I sat in an overly white room, monitors beeping in other rooms around me. 
A doctor stepped into the room, looking me up and down before sitting down in front of a computer. 
“Hello, I’m dr. Carter, you’re Mark Byrne, I presume?” He introduced himself. I nodded. 
“Well, the EEG showed no signs of a seizure, no abnormal brain functions or anything. It’s strange, to be honest with you, are there any pre-existing conditions you or anyone in your family has?” He asked, leaning to rest his elbows on his knees.
“Not that I know of, no,” I responded. He nodded, looking back down to his notes. 
“Well, I think the only solution is to kill yourself,” He told me, his voice deeper, less his own. his head shot back up. 
“W-what?” I asked, confused.
“You need to kill youself, Mark. You touched the noose, you need to…” He told me. I got up, scared. I backed against the wall, staring at Dr. Carter as he got up.
“Hey, Mark, what’s happening? Are you okay?” He asked. I cleared my throat, sitting back down as I tried to calm myself. 
“Y-Yeah, I’m okay,” I told him, voice shaking. 
“Okay then, do you understand what you need to do?” 	He asked me. 
“Yeah,” I lied, getting up once again. I left the room, heading for the exit. I looked around at the people sitting in the waiting room, some people crying, others coughing into rags and hands. I saw a man by the exit, picking at his hands before he looked up to me. He stared, cocking his head slightly. I put my head down, hands in my pockets as I tried to speed out of the door. 
Out of nowhere, I was tackled to the ground as a man yelled in my face.
“MARK FUCKING BYRNE, YOU SHOULDN’T HAVE WOKEN IT UP!” The man yelled, punching me and choking me out. 
“YOU’RE GONNA DIE, BYRNE…WHY DID YOU START WHAT YOU CAN’T FINISH?” He snarled, holding my throat tightly in his feral hands. I coughed, gagging as I tried to get him to let go. I kept thinking to myself, where were the nurses, where was any help? I kept fighting against him, throwing him off with one final push. I jumped up, staring at the waiting room as I panted. Everyone was staring, faces blank as people started moving towards me. 
I backed away, still panting as I stared at the people walking towards me. Someone grabbed my shoulders, I jumped, spinning around as a man stood in the doorway. His look was vacant, empty as he held his hands out for me. 
“Why would you touch the noose, Mark?” He asked, his voice low and monotone. I panicked, pushing the man over, sprinting to my car as people followed behind me. I locked my door, having a full blown panic-attack in the hospital parking lot. People started leaving the waiting room, moving towards my car. I raced home, watching every person on the road, trying to avoid any eyes on the way.
 I pulled into my driveway, jumping out of my car and running inside before anyone could lay eyes on me. I slammed the door shut, back to the door as I slid down to the floor. I tried to reason with what  was happening to me. 
Maybe it was a concussion? 
Maybe I was just fucking crazy? 
I spent the rest of the night sitting at my door, spiraling over and over again as I tried to figure out what the hell was happening. I eventually fell asleep, waking up with my head falling in between my knees. 
I felt my phone vibrating in my pocket, with half asleep hands, I fumbled for it in my pocket. 
“This is Detective Mark Byrne, who is this?” I asked, eyes closed as I tried to wake up. 
“Mark, this is Clancy, I need you down at the precinct to quesiton someone,” He tod me, his voice tense, almost nervous. 
“Yeah-yeah, I got it. I’ll be there in ten, alright?” I answered, getting up to change. 
Clancy sent over the file for the man I was questioning. 

Thirty-six  year-old male, Cian Allen, was found wnadering near the site from a day prior. He has some dried substnace on his left jacket sleeve and seems to be talking to himself about ‘The Noose.’ Proceed with caution and stay calm. 

I left the house, somehow complelety forgetting the night before. I headed to the precinct rather quickly, speeding past people in their cars as I focued on the road ahead. 
I pulled into a parking spot, getting out before heading inside. I walked in as multiple sheriff deputies stood around a room. 
“What’s the problem?” I asked, peeking in around people. 
“There’s a fucking loon in that room. He’s talking to himself and shit.” One responded, eyes still trained on the window. 
“Well, stop fucking gawking at him,” I barked. I pushed past them, heading into the room. 
“Hello, I am detective Byrne, you can call me Mark, if you’d like,” I entered the room, my demeanor changing. 
“Fuck you,” The man responded harshly as I sat down. I stared at him, expressionless as I made eye contact with him for a moment. 
“Now, you’re Cian, correct?” I asked. He nodded, looking down to the handcuffs. 
“Do you know why you’re here, Cian?” I asked, pulling out a notepad and pen. He stared up at me, looking at me with an animalistic interest. 
“No, no I don’t,” he responded, leaning back in his chair. 
“You were found wandering around an open crime scene. Why were you there, Cian?” I asked, taking a deep breath as I waited for his answer. He closed his eyes, sighing deeply as he crossed his arms over his chest. 
I waited another minute of two, getting more impatient. Finally, he responded. 
“You touched the noose, Byrne,”  He barked out in a deep, broken voice, “why’d you do it?” 
I stared at him, chest caving as I fell into a trance. He got up slowly, looming over my terrified form. 
“You have started something you have no idea how to finish,”  he spoke, stepping over me. I  tried to back away, pushing myself out of the seat as I fell in my ass. I pushed myself away to the wall, Cian still walked toward me. He grabbed the pen off the desk, holding it out in front of him. 
“You’re going to die, Mark. No one can save you, and the longer you wait, the more people will get hurt.” He told me before jabbing the pen repeatedly into his neck. I shrank back into myself as Cian fell forward in front of me. He gurgled, taking the blood from his neck to write something out on the whitewashed floor. 

Mark Byrne will die by the Noose. 

I couldn’t move, terrified but what I had just witnessed. Sheriff deputies flooded the room, two of them grabbing me off of the ground. 
They took me out, sitting me down on one of the chairs outside of the room. 
“Byrne, what the fuck happened?” One asked. I didn’t answer, only stared off into space.
“Byrne, Byrne!” He called, waving a hand in front of my face. I looked up, staring at him without saying a word. 
“Byrne. What happened?” He asked again. 
“I-I don’t know,” I told him honestly. Another sheriff  Walked over robotically. He stared over at me, saying nothing as he peeked over. I panicked. 
“What the fuck are you looking at?” I asked, getting up. The sheriff looked confused. I was terrified, waiting for the voice to tell me off once again. 
“You think you can get in my fucking head, huh?” I seethed as I stormed over to him. I grabbed him by his collar, panting with fear and anger. 
“You think you can fucking torment me because I touched a damn noose? I was just doing my fucking job!” I yelled into the man’s face. He stared at me, fearful to speak. 
“I’m not telling you anything, Byrne. Just, calm down, okay?” He asked, putting his hands up. I held onto his collar, pulling tighter as I couldn’t let him go. Another sheriff touched my shoulder, lightly taking me off of the other deputy. 
“Byrne, he didn’t do anything. It’s okay,” he told me, turning me around to face him. 
“Byrne, it’s your fault he’s dead,” one of the deputies spoke out from behind the other. 
“W-what?” I asked. 
 “It’s your fault he’s dead. You shouldn’t have touched the noose.” He said. The other deputies turned to face me, staring blankly at my face as I started to back away. I turned to run, seeing a wall of deputies pacing towards me. 
“Mark, you’re going to die.” One of them uttered as he kept pacing towards me. They all circled me, getting closer as they mumbled in unison. I punched one of them, trying to get away before any of them could grab me. I ran to my car, jumping in before speeding off. 
For the next few hours, I sat in my house, freaking out over what had happened. I wanted to know why this was happening to me. I grabbed my computer, setting it up on my kitchen counter. I searched up 
‘Clove Hoof Forest Oak Tree.’
One result, a murder from ninety years prior. A man was seen with the noose days prior, he touched it, falling into spasms before losing full consciousness. He was seen days later with scratches and cuts all over his body, bleeding heavily as someone walked with him into the forest. He was found hanging from the noose days later. 
And the oak tree; it wasn’t just there, it was waiting. The noose hung like an invitation. Below it, a man stood. Cian, still bleeding from the neck. He looked up at me slowly, eyes hollow and white. He said nothing. Behind him, more people stood, shoulder to shoulder, faceless in the dark like shadows carved out of the trees themselves. Their bodies shifted, twitched, waiting for something. Then Cian opened his mouth, but it wasn’t his voice.
“You’re next, Mark,” it said, “You touched it. You woke it.”


(PART 2)
I snapped awake, gasping. The morning sun burned through the blinds. I was drenched in sweat, the taste of copper thick in my mouth. I wiped my lips and stared at the red stain on my palm. Nosebleed. I staggered to the bathroom and turned on the light. My face looked like I hadn’t slept in days; dark bags, blood crusted to my upper lip, skin pale. My shirt was sticking to me like I’d been rained on. I pulled it off, eyes closed as my eyes burned with exhaustion. I looked up to the mirror, stopping in my tracks. 
Across my chest; scratches. Long, red, fresh. I hadn’t had them when I went to bed. The phone rang suddenly. I jumped, staring at it for a moment before walking over. I picked it up slowly, as if it might explode in my hand.
“Byrne?” Clancy’s voice came through, low, uneasy.
“Yeah… yeah, I’m here,”
“There’s something you need to see. It’s about the kid. The one we found in the woods.”
I swallowed, my throat dry.
“What is it?”
“They finished the toxicology. No drugs, no alcohol. But there were marks... strange symbols carved into his back. Looked like rope burns at first but... these weren’t random.”
“What kind of symbols?” I asked.
“I don’t know. Some kind of runes, maybe. Not anything I’ve seen before. You need to come down here,” He finished, sighing over the phone. 
I didn’t answer right away. I looked over my shoulder, half-expecting the noose to be hanging in my hallway.
“I’ll be there in twenty,” I told him as I cleared my throat. 
I didn’t even change clothes. I threw on a jacket, grabbed my badge, and got in the car. The whole way to the station I kept checking my rearview mirror. Every time I did, it felt like someone would be sitting in the backseat, watching.
Nothing was there. But it felt like something was. When I got to the precinct, Clancy was already waiting for me in the back hallway, a folder clutched to his chest.
“You look like shit,” he said, flatly.
“I feel worse,” I grunted. He handed me the folder with a worried expression. 
“Tell me if I’m losing it,” he said, watching me as I opened it.
Photos; close-ups of the victim’s back. Long, jagged marks, like rope, had been wrapped tight and then seared into the skin. But some of the marks were... deliberate. Etched. I traced one of them with my finger over the plastic sleeve.
“I’ve seen this before,” I whispered.
Clancy looked up. “Where?”
“In my dream. Last night.” He stared at me.
“You remember that guy you questioned, CCian?” he asked slowly.
“Yeah,” I responded. 
“He was talking about the marks before he bled out. Said they were ‘part of the pact.’ Whatever that means,” He shrugged. I closed the folder, heart pounding.
“He said I started something. Something I don’t understand,” I told him. 
Clancy nodded.
“Well, maybe you should try,”
“What do you mean?”
He glanced around the hallway, then leaned in close.
“You ever heard of the Black Knot?” He asked quietly, almost whispering. 
“No,” I replied, confused. 
“It’s folklore. Real obscure shit. Came up in some files I pulled after the first incident. Some old Celtic ritual about binding souls. Hanging trees. Spirits trapped in the noose. People who touch it become... marked,”
I blinked. “Marked how?”
Clancy took a step back.
“They belong to it now,”
Silence filled the hallway. Then a deputy came running up, face pale.
“Clancy. Byrne. We’ve got another one,” We both turned.
“Where?” Clancy asked. The deputy swallowed, glancing at me before answering.
“Outside Byrne’s house.”
Clancy didn’t say much on the drive over. The cruiser hummed beneath us, tires slicing through wet asphalt as we moved past rows of quiet houses. I sat stiffly, head leaning against the passenger window, trying to focus on the rain as it painted lines across the glass. My stomach twisted with something deep, something sour and heavy.
“You good?” Clancy asked, eyes still on the road.
“I’m fine,” I lied, voice low. He looked over, making a double-take as he furrowed his brow. 
“Your nose is bleeding,” He uttered. 
I wiped it with the back of my hand, blinking at the smear of red across my skin. I didn’t respond.
Clancy turned into my street, slowing to a crawl as the yellow tape came into view. A couple of cruisers were already parked in front of my house, red and blue lights quietly rotating in the misty gray of the morning.
He parked behind one of them, and I opened the door slowly, my legs stiff as I stepped out. The second I stood up, my stomach lurched. I doubled over and threw up in the gutter; thick, wet heaves that burned my throat. It wasn’t food. It was dark. Too dark. It tasted of metal and dirt. 
Clancy came around to my side of the car, watching me.
“You sure this is just stress?” he asked.
“I said I’m fine,” I snapped, wiping my mouth with my sleeve.
We crossed the lawn. It felt wrong, like stepping into someone else’s home. Deputies were gathered near the tree in my backyard. One of them looked over at me and immediately looked away. Clancy pushed ahead, motioning for me to follow.
“You’re not gonna like this,” one of the officers mumbled to Clancy as we passed. We stepped into the backyard. That damn oak tree stood tall in the mist, its limbs stretched wide like arms waiting for something. Hanging from one of the thicker branches was a body. The noose creaked with every soft breeze.
I froze.
At first glance, it looked like me. Same build. Same height. Same slumped posture, head tilted slightly to the side. My heart stopped for a second. But as we got closer, I realized it wasn’t me. Younger, maybe early twenties. Messy brown hair matted with blood. Wearing a torn gray hoodie, soaked and stained. One sneaker missing. Wrists wrapped in old, deep ligature marks like he’d been tied up before the end.
“Do we have an ID?” Clancy asked, stepping toward the body.
“Not yet,” one of the deputies said. “Neighbor called it in about an hour ago. Said he thought he saw Mark walking into the yard sometime around four. Then I saw the body hanging around six.” Clancy glanced at me.
I couldn’t move. My hands were shaking, my stomach turning again. My head pulsed like something inside was knocking to get out.
“Why does he look like me?” I asked quietly. Clancy didn’t answer. The body hung still now, like the wind had gone dead. Something on the ground caught Clancy’s eye. He crouched down, motioning for a flashlight. One of the deputies handed it over, and he clicked it on, sweeping the beam across the damp dirt.
Symbols. Carved crudely into the mud. Long spirals. Crossed lines. Circles with small hooks like teeth curling out from their edges.
“Same markings from the crime scene in the woods,” Clancy muttered.
I stumbled forward, nausea rising again. I dropped to my knees, coughing into my hands. This time, when I looked down, I saw more than just blood; thick, black threads swimming in my spit like oil in water.
I sat back on my heels, trying to breathe. The body was still swinging gently above us. I looked up. Something was carved into the branch, Just above where the noose was tied.
BYRNE
I stared.
“I didn’t do that,” I said.
“I know,” Clancy responded, but he didn’t sound convinced.
And for a second, I wasn’t either. 
I didn’t say much after that.
Clancy talked with the forensics guy, muttered something about getting someone from State to look at the symbols. I just stood there, swaying slightly, trying not to vomit again. My stomach was cramping hard now, like something inside was twisting tighter with every breath I took.
We left after an hour. Clancy drove this time too. Said I was in no shape to be behind the wheel, not that I argued. I leaned against the window, eyes half-lidded, watching the world bleed past. Everything looked distant. Too slow. Like I was watching it all through a thick layer of glass.
We didn’t speak until we got back to the station. I sat on the edge of Clancy’s desk while he typed into the system, pulling up old case files and cross-referencing the symbols. I took off my jacket, my arms were burning under the sleeves. Like sunburn, but worse. Like fire just beneath the skin.
I rolled up my sleeves, stopped breathing. There were lines on my arms. Thin, red scratches. Some shallow, some deeper. Fresh. Like they’d been carved while I was asleep. I touched one and flinched. It stung.
“Clancy,” I said, voice low.
He didn’t look up. “Yeah?”
“Clancy,” I repeated sternly. 
He turned and saw my arms.
“Jesus, Mark. When did that happen?”
“I don’t know,” I whispered.
He stepped closer, inspecting the marks like he wasn’t sure if they were real.
“They’re… they’re the same shapes. Same as in the dirt,” he said slowly. “Look.”
He reached into his desk drawer and pulled out one of the printed photos from earlier that morning. He held it next to my arm. The curve of the spiral. The hooked teeth. The slash marks. All of it; identical.
“Mark, what the hell is happening to you?”
“I don’t know,” I said again, shaking my head.
He stared at me, searching my face for something, some clue, maybe some lie. But there wasn’t anything left to hide. I was falling apart right in front of him.
I rolled the sleeve back down and leaned forward, elbows on my knees, pressing my palms against my eyes until everything turned white.
“I think it’s the noose,” I said finally.
Clancy sat back down in his chair. “What do you mean?”
“I mean, it did something. I touched it, and it… took something from me. Or gave something. I don’t know. But ever since then… the dreams, the guy at the hospital, the attack… this thing on my skin. It’s all tied to that moment.”
He was quiet for a long time.
Then he stood up, grabbed his coat, and tossed mine at me.
“Let’s go,” he said.
“Go where?”
“To the forest,”
We parked at the edge of the Clove Hoof trailhead. The sky had darkened again, gray clouds rolling in like a slow bruise. Wind whipped through the trees, cold and sharp. I stepped out of the car, legs unsteady, every movement feeling like it was being resisted, like something didn’t want me back here.
We walked the trail in silence, Clancy holding a flashlight, even though it was still early afternoon. The trees bent in above us, forming a loose canopy that darkened everything underneath.
I started sweating. Hard. My breath came short. My legs dragged.
Clancy looked over, concern flashing in his eyes. “You’re white as hell, man.”
I didn’t answer.
We reached the tree again.
The oak in the middle of all those redwoods. The only one of its kind.
The branch the noose had hung from was still there, bare, scarred with old rope burns. The grass beneath it had been trampled, muddy and dark. Clancy stepped forward, sweeping the flashlight around the base of the tree.
“There,” he pointed. “Markings. Again.” More symbols. More spirals. Fresh, still wet.
“I think it’s a language,” he said softly. “Or a warning.”
“Or a curse,” I muttered. He turned to look at me.
I was gripping my stomach. Blood was coming from my nose again, faster now, and the back of my throat tasted like pennies and rust.
I pulled up my sleeve. The markings were spreading. Now across my shoulder, down to my wrist. And they were moving.
Clancy backed up a step. “Okay. Okay. We need help. Like real help.” I sank to my knees.
I was freezing and sweating at the same time. My vision blurred. I could feel something crawling just beneath my skin. I looked up at Clancy, eyes wide.
“I think it wants me dead, Clance.” He stepped toward me, gripping my shoulders tightly.
“No. Fuck that. We’re going to figure this out, alright? We’ll find out what this is. We’ll find who started it. We’re not letting you die like this.” I looked past him. Just behind the tree. There was someone standing there. Tall. Thin. Barefoot. Soaked in mud and shadow. Head tilted too far to the left. Watching us.
Not moving.I opened my mouth to speak, but my throat locked up. My hands trembled.
Clancy turned to see what I was staring at, but the figure was already gone.
He didn’t say anything right away, just stared at the empty space behind the tree, flashlight beam trembling slightly in his hand.
“You saw something,” he said finally.
I nodded, slow. “It was watching us.” I choked out. 
“Was it… human?”
I hesitated. “Mostly.”
Clancy cursed under his breath and turned back to me. 
“Alright, we’re done out here. I don’t care if we have to call in every spook from Langley to fucking Vatican City. You’re not dying in this goddamn forest.”
He hauled me up, my legs barely cooperating. My vision swam, but I followed him as best I could. The woods felt alive now, pressing closer, the trees leaning in, the wind whispering in a voice that wasn’t quite wind. I could hear something. Not words. More like humming. Low. Wrong. Like the world itself was remembering something it wanted to forget.
We were almost to the car when I collapsed again. My knees buckled and I hit the dirt hard, coughing violently. I doubled over and vomited something thick and black, steaming in the cold air. Clancy was shouting, but it sounded far away.
Then;
Everything went quiet.
Not silent. Quiet. The kind that feels like the air has been sucked out of the world. Like something’s holding its breath.I looked up. The trees were still. The clouds above had frozen mid-drift.
And in front of me, kneeling now in the dirt, was the figure. Closer. Clearer. Its eyes were hollow, dark pits, but I felt it looking at me.
It reached out a hand, long-fingered, the nails black and cracked like old bark. It touched my chest. And I remembered something that wasn’t mine.
A rope. A fire. A name screamed into the woods until the voice gave out. Pain. So much pain.
I gasped, sucking in breath like I’d been underwater for days. The figure was gone again. Vanished without sound or trace. But the symbols on my skin? They were glowing now. Faint red light, pulsing like a heartbeat.
Clancy hauled me up, panicked now. “Mark, Jesus, we’re going now.”
I didn’t argue. My head lolled as he half carried me back to the car. 
Back at the station, I sat wrapped in a blanket, a cup of coffee going cold in my hands. Clancy was pacing, phone to his ear, shouting into it. He’d called in favors. Old friends. Experts. Anyone who might know what the hell we were dealing with.
I stared at my reflection in the darkened window. My eyes looked wrong. Too wide. Too still.
The thing in the forest had left something in me.
And I wasn’t sure it ever meant to leave.


(PART 3)
The next two days passed in fragments.
Sleep came in gasps. Moments of black punctuated by flashes of her. The woman in the woods. Sometimes she was young. Sometimes bone-thin, with empty eye sockets. Sometimes just rope and blood and teeth.
I stopped eating. Couldn’t keep anything down. My skin had gone pale, veined with purpling streaks. The symbols crawled higher now—across my chest, neck, jaw. Clancy tried to hide it, but I saw the fear in his eyes every time he looked at me. Like he wasn’t sure how much of me was left.
On the third morning, I collapsed in the station bathroom. Hit the tile so hard I cracked a molar. Woke up to Clancy slapping my face, shouting my name like he could call me back from wherever I was slipping.
“I called her,” he said, breath ragged. “The professor from Dunridge. Folklore and dead languages. You remember the file? Case #7883?”
I nodded weakly. “The Gravesend woman.”
“Yeah. The one who burned the runes into her own walls. Same spiral. Same damn teeth marks.” He paused. “She survived.” paper and eyes that missed nothing. She didn’t blink when she saw me.
She pulled a black leather book from her bag, worn soft with use. Opened it to a page near the center. A sketch of the noose. The tree. Symbols running down the margin.
“I’ve seen this before,” she said. “Three times, in fact. Always the same configuration. Always found after a death that shouldn’t have happened. A child hanged in Prentiss County, 1924. A soldier in Alabama, ’68. And the Gravesend woman.”
“What does it mean?” Clancy asked. Elaine looked at me, not him.
“It’s a binding mark. Ancient. Pre-language. Something older than prayer.” She reached toward my arm but didn’t touch. “It’s not a curse. It’s a claim.”
My throat went dry. “Claim?”
She nodded. “A soul-debt. Blood for knowledge. You touched the noose. That makes you the conduit.”
I laughed—dry, cracked. “A conduit for what?”
Elaine’s expression tightened. “It doesn’t want to kill you. Not at first. It wants you hollow. Empty enough to carry it forward.”
Clancy swore and slammed his fist against the desk.
Elaine opened her book again and showed me the spiral. “This? It’s not just a symbol. It’s a map. An invocation. It marks the passage from flesh to… whatever’s beyond.”
I shook my head, dizzy. “Can you stop it?”
“I can slow it. But the noose needs to be severed. Burned and buried in salt. And not here. At the place of its origin.”
Clancy leaned forward. “Which is where?”
She hesitated. “You’re not going to like it.”
We returned to the forest that night.
Not the tree this time. Deeper. Elaine led the way, holding something in her hands—twigs bound in red thread, a charm of some kind. The path grew stranger the farther we went. Trees grew twisted. Bent back on themselves. The wind didn’t move the branches. The air got thick. Still.
Mark’s body was giving out.
I couldn’t feel my fingers anymore. The blood in my nose wouldn’t stop. The symbols were brighter now, glowing faint red even through my clothes. My breath rattled like there was gravel in my lungs.
We came to a clearing, a hollow in the ground, ringed with blackened stones.
In the center was another noose. Older. Woven with hair and bone.
Elaine dropped to her knees, muttering in a language that didn’t belong in this world. The symbols on my skin pulsed in answer. They recognized her words.
The air began to move. The shadows thickened. The thing came back.
Not as a figure now. As a presence. A crushing weight behind my eyes, forcing me down. My vision flickered. My skin burned. It spoke.
“You took it. You carry it. You are mine.”
I screamed. My voice cracked like old glass. Clancy held me up, shouting at Elaine to hurry the hell up.
She poured the salt. Lit the fire. The noose shrieked, no sound, just a feeling, like a thousand nails down a chalkboard in my brain.
The light from the fire flared, blinding.
Then…silence.
When I woke, I was on the ground.
Elaine knelt beside me, checking my pulse. Her face was pale. Tired.
“The burning broke the bond,” she said quietly. “But it’s not gone. Not completely. It left… residue. Echoes.” I looked down. The symbols were still there. Faded, but still there.
“You’re not dying,” she added. “But you’re not the same.” I knew what she meant.
I could still hear it, faintly. Like something behind a door. Waiting.
Clancy helped me up. “So what now?” Elaine looked at both of us, and then toward the dark woods behind her.
“Now? We make sure no one ever finds another noose like that again.”
Elaine spread a dozen old books across the table, her fingers smudged with soot and ink. She hadn’t slept in two days. The station’s overhead lights buzzed faintly above us, flickering like they were about to burn out. Outside, a storm brewed low over the town, gray and heavy.
“This noose,” she said finally, tapping one of the open pages, “the one you touched—it’s not the original.”
I looked up, swallowing the bile in my throat. “What do you mean? The one from the forest nearly killed me.”
Elaine nodded grimly. “Because it was made to. But it wasn’t born there.”
She pulled a thin volume toward her—handwritten, the spine held together with twine. “In 1846, a traveling merchant named Elias Croft came into possession of a rope. Supposedly found hanging in a stone crypt beneath a monastery ruin in northern France. It was already old then. Local folklore called it La Corde de l’Oubli; ‘The Rope of Forgetting.’ Anyone who touched it either died... or claimed they saw beyond the veil.”
Clancy leaned over her shoulder. “So how the hell did it end up in our woods?”
Elaine turned another page. “Croft brought it back to the States. It passed through collectors, smugglers. In 1887, a preacher named Wallace Arlen stole it from an auction and brought it to a chapel in Harrow’s Field. Said it was a relic of divine judgment.”
“Let me guess,” I said. “It wasn’t.”
“No. It was a seal. Something meant to be hidden, not worshipped. Wallace used it in sermons, even hanged stray animals from it during revival ‘cleansings.’ Then, in 1939, the chapel caught fire during a storm. Burned to the ground. All that was left was scorched stone.”
Clancy crossed his arms. “And no one ever rebuilt it?”
Elaine shook her head. “Locals said the land was cursed. The noose was never recovered—until someone unearthed it twenty years ago. And they buried it in the forest, maybe thinking the trees would keep it quiet.”
She looked at me then.
“But the one you touched was only a conduit. A copy. A tuned object. The real noose... it’s still buried beneath that chapel’s ruins.”
I felt the weight settle in my stomach like cold iron. “Then we dig,”

We arrived at Harrow’s Field under heavy cloud cover. The chapel had been reduced to a jagged ring of mossy stone, half-swallowed by vines and time. Charred wood jutted from the earth like broken teeth. The surrounding trees were dead, stripped to bone-white trunks, bark blackened as if scorched long ago but never regrown.
It was like the land had stopped trying to live.
Elaine lit a bundle of sage, muttering under her breath in the old language. She scattered iron filings in a circle, then gestured to Clancy. “Start digging. Right beneath the altar stone.”
He didn’t ask questions.
Thirty minutes later, we found it. Wrapped in damp linen. Buried in a lead box etched with spirals and lines, those same symbols still tattooed along my arms. The air grew colder the moment we opened it.
And there it was. The original noose.
Twisted, blackened, stiffer than rope should ever be. It stank of wet ash and copper. My vision blurred the moment I looked at it too long. The pulse in my wrist throbbed hard against the scars.
“We destroy it now,” Elaine said. “This is the heart of it. Sever this, and the rest dies with it,” 
She laid it gently inside the ritual circle, adding black salt, grave dust, and a vial of her own blood. She handed me a small obsidian dagger. “Mark. This part has to be you. You’re bonded to it. Only you can make it vulnerable.”
I took the blade. Everything inside me screamed to drop it and run.
Instead, I stepped forward, placed my other hand just above the noose, and the world exploded. I wasn’t in the ruins anymore.
I was beneath them. In some shadow of the place. Walls that bled. Pews that screamed. A ceiling that breathed like lungs. And at the far end, where the altar should’ve been, stood a massive figure.
Taller than anything human. Robed in ropes. Its face was dozens of nooses braided together, dripping ash.
“You’ve come to finish what you began.”
Its voice wasn’t sound. It was pressure. It pushed thoughts into my skull until I bled from my eyes.
“You were the vessel. You carried me. You gave me breath. And now you would silence me?”
I lifted the knife. The thing laughed, a noise that cracked stone and split my mind down the center. My body began to seize again, spine locking up, blood pouring from my mouth, from the marks on my arms. I fell forward. The dagger skittered across the stone.
In the real world, I could hear them screaming my name. Clancy holding me down. Elaine chanted louder, her voice cracking.
“Finish it, Mark!”
I crawled. Every inch forward was a war. Every breath pulled knives through my ribs. The thing lunged. And in that instant, I drove the dagger straight into the noose.
The dagger dropped from my hand.
I collapsed.
The firestorm howled up from the circle, searing the night sky with a column of blinding white light. The noose writhed, then cracked, splitting in two with a sound like a tree snapping in slow motion. The earth buckled beneath us, groaning like something ancient was finally, finally giving way.
And then; 
Silence.
For a moment, it was done.
But I didn’t move.
“Mark?” Clancy's voice was barely audible, like he was underwater.
“Mark!” He was already beside me, rolling me over, hands pressed to my chest. My body was cold. Limp. Blood poured from my nose, eyes, and mouth, soaking into the soil like an offering.
Elaine scrambled forward, grabbed my wrist. “His pulse is weak. Faint. He’s not going to make it unless we finish the rite now.”
“But we broke the noose,” Clancy stammered. “It’s over!”
“No,” she said sharply. “We destroyed the object. But Mark opened the gate to sever it. He’s the anchor now. If we don’t close the ritual correctly, the backlash will eat him alive, and maybe us with it.”
Clancy went pale. “What do I do?”
“Take this.” She handed him a small silver bowl and a taper of white chalk. “Draw the closing symbol, quickly. Around the blood. Around him. I’ll invoke the seal.”
She began chanting.
My body wasn’t mine anymore.
I was floating above it—disconnected. I could see the three of us: my broken body in the dirt, Clancy on his knees frantically drawing symbols, Elaine rocking forward and back, blood pouring from her ears as she chanted.
But deeper still, beneath that; something waited.
The shattered thing.
It wasn’t alive, not anymore.
But it wasn’t dead either.
It was hungry. And it was using me to crawl back in. A thousand tendrils of smoke reached up through the split between worlds. They slipped into my mouth. My ears. My scars. I could feel it rebuilding its nest inside me.
A new noose. Flesh instead of rope.
Clancy finished the symbol and shouted, “Now!”
Elaine drove her hand into the flame and screamed the final word of the ritual. The bowl shattered in her hand. The light exploded outward, flattening the grass in every direction. The tendrils of smoke shrieked, actually shrieked, audibly, a keening sound that made the air ripple and the trees moan.
And then: 
They snapped. Like a million rubber bands recoiling into nothing.
I gasped. Air rushed into my lungs like drowning reversed.
I convulsed once, twice, then coughed up black ash. The last of it. The residue. It steamed where it hit the dirt, then dissolved into dust.
Clancy caught me in his arms.
“Jesus,” he said, holding me upright. “You came back.”
I couldn’t answer. Couldn’t even nod. My skin was gray. My veins blackened. I was barely clinging to this world.
Elaine, shaking, crawled closer, blood crusting on her temple. “He’ll live… but he won’t be the same.”
“What the hell does that mean?”
She looked down at me, sorrow in her eyes.
“He was touched by what lies beyond the veil. And he touched it back. That kind of exchange leaves a mark. Even if it doesn’t show.”
Clancy held my hand.
“Then we help him carry it.”
They got me to a hospital before sunrise. I spent three days in a coma, drifting in and out of half-dreams filled with smoke and rope and bone.
When I woke up, Elaine was gone.
Left a note.
It’s over. The door is closed. If anything ever opens it again… I pray you’re already dead by then. You wouldn’t survive a second passage. — E.
The doctors said I was lucky to be alive. But they didn’t see the dreams. Didn’t feel the air go still when I walked into a room. Sometimes, lights still flicker near me. Dogs bark when I pass. Clocks tick slower. Clancy checks in on me every day. He says the forest is quiet now. The tree’s branch finally snapped. But I can still feel something under my skin when the nights get cold.  Like rope.

Like it’s still waiting.

1mba8ll,https://www.reddit.com/r/Allthingsnaija/comments/1mba8ll/relocating_to_nigeria_business_and_investment_for/,"Relocating to Nigeria? - Business and investment for Diaspora, Digital nomads and new investors.","*Savvy investor Monday*

I'm here to share business you can start today without breaking the bank. With emphasis on business you can do without physically being in Nigeria. 

**Disclaimer**

Business is not a get rich quick scheme especially in Nigeria so any business suggested will require patience and further research. I am not a financial expert I am speaking from experience as a brand strategist.


**1. Content creation**

There is interest in diaspora returnee, Nigerians japa and japada content. People are curious about what it takes to live in Nigeria some for nostalgia and others as inspiration.

*What you need starting?*

Basic editing skills,
Phone camera,
Internet connection,
Find your niche.

*Earnings*

Paid ads , Sponsorship, consultancy, Merch
Expect steady earnings within the first few years of consistent posting.

**2. Interest accured on Naira investment portfolio**

Certain financial apps offer Naira investments where you get variable interest based on the amount invested. Some of these investment portfolio give up to 22% yearly return on your money. As usual there's a small management fee to consider.

This option is good for people with bulk funds that want to earn without the stress of running a business. It's also a good way to save capital.

*What you need?*

Phone to download the App,
Bulk Money to invest,
Patience.

*Earnings*

Expect 11% to 23% yearly on monies invested

*Note- I'm not mentioning any apps by name as i am not being paid too and i want you to find them on your own. However if you're struggling to find an app i can share the app i use with you privately, send me a message*

*Any comments promoting specific apps will be blocked*

**3. Rental services business**

Some examples incude:

Construction equipment and tools, 
Camera equipment,
Private car, commercial vans and trucks,
Salon tools and equipment,
Chairs, tables, canopy and decorations for events,
Office and shop rentals to freelancer/artisans

*What you need?*

Storage,
Manager/coordinator/Admin,
A way of recording transactions(booking system),
Business name,
Bank account.

*Earnings*

The good thing with rental services is return on investment (ROI) is based largely on the price set by the owner. If you want to make 30% you simply adjust your pricing to reflect this.

**4. Service and consultancy based business**

Some examples include freelancing, co working spaces , coffee shops with libraries, training center, NIMC registration, Jamb center, print services.

*What you need?*

Brand page,
Portfolio,
Office space,
Manager/coordinator/Admin,
Links and connections in the community.

You might have noticed in these examples no specific amount is mentioned that's because there is no minimum or maximum amount to invest. It depends on your budget.

**Tips**

Start with option 2 on the list and save minimum of N500,000 Naira. Let the money acure interest while you figure out which business to start.

If you want less headache and increased flexibility install CCTV cameras. This allows you monitor your business anywhere in the world.

Two heads are better than one. Grab your brother , sister , cousin, Uncle, friend anyone who also wants to invest in Nigeria to join you. If they don't someone convince at least one person. Don't go it alone it's a hard and lonely road. Share the risks , share the reward.

Research, research, research. Read as much as you can on any business you're interested in. Consult with business experts and strategists. I'm one myself yes shameless plug reach out to me privately for consultation. Don't invest blindly.

Stay away from capital intensive projects ie agro farming, real estate business , any business heavily dependant on electricity ie factory business. It is a money pit especially in 2025.

There is no rush, please don't let anyone pressure you into starting a business. Take your time, visit the location if you can seek advice and get a good nights rest before taking any decision.

Business is fun and the investment opportunities in Nigeria are vast. If you want niche business suggestions or have a higher budget ie N100,000,000 million then send me a message, let's talk.

*Peace and Love.*

we've recently purchased some ground coffee that has cinnamon powder mixed to it. The cinnamon powder is fine (imagine the one used for cinnamon buns). The amount is about 5% of the total product, I think (it's a bit unclear).

1mba3wh,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mba3wh,Paros & Antiparos,"We spent 4 days on Paros in early July to celebrate a friend’s milestone birthday — and it turned out to be the perfect start to our Cycladic island trip. The island gave us a great mix of laid-back beach vibes, charming villages, delicious food, and just enough adventure.

We were a group of three and rented a car via Sunny Cars with full insurance. The local partner AutoUnion handed it over directly at Paros Airport, and the whole process was smooth and easy. If we had been just two, we probably would’ve rented scooters — definitely more fun and ideal for Paros — but with three people, the car made more sense.

We stayed at a beautiful little hotel with a pool, peaceful and stylish — the kind of place where you immediately feel at home. We honestly would’ve loved to stay longer, but we had Naxos waiting on the other side. (We’re not sharing the name — some places are too special to spoil 😉)

Day 1 – Aliki & Balcony by the Sea

After checking in, we headed to Aliki for dinner at To Balcony tou Aki. It was super windy, but the seafood was excellent, the staff warm and welcoming, and the view over the bay was picture-perfect. A relaxed start that got us right into island mode.


---

Day 2 – Mountain Villages, Monastery & Our Favorite Meal

Saturday was our village and landscape day. We started in Marpissa, which ended up being our personal favorite. It felt authentic, calm, and full of quiet beauty — whitewashed alleyways, sleepy corners, and lots of little details to discover if you take your time.

From there, we walked up to the Monastery of St. Antonios, a short 10-minute climb with absolutely stunning views over the east coast of Paros. Totally worth the effort — and very few people around.

Next stop: Lefkes, the best-known mountain village on the island. It’s undeniably beautiful — postcard-perfect with flowers and narrow lanes — but it felt a bit overrun by day-trippers when we were there. Still worth a stop, but we didn’t stay long.

Then we visited Prodromos, and it couldn’t have been a bigger contrast. The village was so quiet, it felt like time had stopped — almost no one around, just the sound of the breeze and our own footsteps on the old stone paths. A real “Sleeping Beauty” kind of place.

By lunchtime, we reached Piso Livadi, where we had the best meal of our Paros stay at Ouzeri Halaris. Fresh fish, meze, local wine, and a table right by the sea. The atmosphere was unpretentious and perfect.

Just a few minutes from the restaurant, we discovered a tiny hidden bay called La Cric de Bahi (Παραλία Αγίου Νικολάου) — ideal for a quick, peaceful swim in clear turquoise water. No crowds, no fuss.

In the evening, we headed to Naoussa for dinner at Sigi Ikthios. The food was good and the service professional, but Naoussa itself felt a bit like a high-end amusement park — very pretty, but overly polished and a little too crowded for our taste. One drink, and we were ready to head back to our peaceful hotel.


---

Day 3 – Antiparos Day Trip & Zazala DJ Sundowner

Sunday started with a relaxed breakfast, then we drove to Pounta and took the 15-minute car ferry to Antiparos (cheap, cash only — you can check the current timetable here).

We parked in Antiparos town and strolled through the narrow alleys, soaking in the chill island atmosphere. One highlight was our stop at Café Bougainvilles — probably the most beautiful café we’ve ever seen, completely covered in fuchsia bougainvillea and full of charm. Iced coffee, sea breeze, perfect moment.

We explored a few beaches by car and eventually settled at Faneromeni Beach in the south — and it blew us away. Remote, peaceful, crystal-clear water, and almost empty. The only catch: the road there is bumpy and unpaved, so drive slowly and be patient. Totally worth it.

Later we had lunch at Mpakas Fish Tavern. The setting was nice and relaxed, right on the water — the food was okay, nothing memorable but it did the job.

We took the 5 p.m. ferry back to Paros, had a quick refresh, and met up with friends at Zazala Beach Bar around 7 p.m. for their Sunday DJ Sundowner. The vibe was great — chill music, stylish crowd, loungers in the sand — but the food was really disappointing. Would go again for the party and drinks, but not for dinner.


---

Day 4 – Slow Morning & Farewell Swim

On our last day, we kept it low-key. We stayed by the pool, packed slowly, had one last freddo espresso in the sun and soaked in the calm before heading to the port. Paros had given us exactly what we needed — a gentle start, some very real moments, and a great appetite for what was still to come on Naxos.


---

Summary
Paros is beautiful, but not always as serene as the photos suggest. If you want classic Cycladic charm, it’s there — especially in places like Marpissa or Piso Livadi. If you’re after nightlife and buzz, Naoussa will deliver. And if you want untouched beauty, you’ll find it in the corners — like Faneromeni Beach or sleepy Prodromos.

We were so glad we had a car, and even gladder we didn’t try to squeeze everything in. Four days felt just right. Paros gave us sunsets, swims, white alleys, fuchsia flowers, and one unforgettable lunch by the sea.

Next stop: Naxos — wilder, greener, and possibly even tastier. But more on that in the next post 😉

She also heard that decaf is made with all kinds of nasty stuff to extract the caffeine. I’ve been down the rabbit hole trying to find a bean which has been treated with the Swiss water method or other more friendly treatments and is still budget friendly. I found beans from Cafe du Jour which were called “Decaf Espresso 100% arabica” and were treated with CO2. They were nicely priced (26,95 EU/kg! At 12-04) and the wife was happy with the taste. 

Unfortunately Cafe du jour does not have the beans anymore. It does expect to have alternatives anytime time soon, but I’m hoping to find something in the meantime, the wife wants coffee! 

Any suggestions? Which is;

* in the same price range 
* a (more or less) natural treatment 
* deliverable in The Netherlands

Renting a Uhaul truck and there's going to be a couch and coffee table in there, and then the Embody.

The side walls aren't that stable yet, but I reinforced the spine side with a little extra where the folds are so it doesn't fold out.

Should the tension be adjusted to be more loose? Afraid it might hit something while inside the truck and break the spine if it's too tense. Also thinking of letting the arms be a few levels out in width if the box allows in case they hit anything on the sides so the arms will go in instead of possible breaking off.

## FAQs section

Here are some frequently asked questions about swear bear cups to help you make an informed purchase.

**Are swear bear cups safe to use in the microwave and dishwasher?**

Yes, most high-quality swear bear cups made from ceramic or stoneware are microwave and dishwasher safe. However, it's always best to check the manufacturer's instructions to be sure. Some cups may have delicate designs or metallic accents that are not suitable for these appliances. Using a dishwasher may cause the design to fade or chip over time, so hand washing is frequently enough recommended to prolong the cup's lifespan.**What sizes do swear bear cups typically come in?**

Swear bear cups are commonly available in 11-ounce, 12-ounce, and 15-ounce sizes. The standard 11-ounce size is ideal for a single cup of coffee or tea. The larger 15-ounce size is perfect for those who prefer a more generous serving or want to use the cup for soups or other beverages. Travel mugs usually come in 16-ounce sizes.The best size will depend on your individual drinking habits and preferences.**How durable are the designs on swear bear cups?**

The durability of the design depends on the printing method and materials used. High-resolution printing with UV-resistant inks is generally more durable and resistant to fading and peeling.Some cups use a process called sublimation, which infuses the design directly into the ceramic, creating a more permanent bond. While dishwasher use can cause the design to fade over time on some cups, hand washing is often sufficient to preserve the design. Look for cups with positive reviews regarding design durability.

Tried sneaking spinach into banana puree, thinking, “They’ll never notice!”—and then watched them squint, point, and somehow telepathically yell, “WHERE’S THE SPINACH HIDING, ADULT?” Welcome to r/BabyFoodRecipesInfo, where the real recipe is equal parts mashed veggies and messy triumphs.​This isn’t a community for parents who make baby food that looks like it belongs on a Michelin menu (though if you’ve mastered the art of making peas not look like green goop? Teach us your ways). It’s for the exhausted human who blended a “superfood smoothie” for their little one, only to realize they’d accidentally added coffee instead of almond milk (oops, but baby stayed awake for 7 hours—silver linings?). The parent who bought a $50 baby food maker and now uses it mostly to puree leftover rice because “multitasking, duh.” The brave soul who tried to introduce quinoa and learned that babies can spit with the precision of a pressure washer.​Share your “win” (and by “win,” we mean “they ate three bites without gagging”): “My 8-month-old loves roasted carrot cubes! They’re lumpy, a little charred, and 90% end up on the floor, but I’ll take it.” Beg for help with the head-scratchers: “Why does my baby act like avocado is poison? I’ve tried it mashed, sliced, mixed with yogurt—do I need to sing to it first? What’s the avocado love language?” Laugh at the chaos: “Tried making homemade applesauce. It’s more like apple soup. Baby drank it from a sippy cup. Is that… acceptable? Please say yes.”​We get it. Baby food is a minefield of confusion. Like when you followed a “simple” recipe for pear puree and ended up with a texture that could double as wallpaper paste. Or when you spent $12 on organic blueberries, pureed them with care, and your baby decided today is the day they hate all purple foods. But those are the moments that bond us—spoonfuls of rejected puree, high chairs caked in oatmeal, and the silent high-five you give yourself when they finally, finally swallow something new.​Grab your blender (and a bib for yourself—trust us). Let’s swap stories about the time you tried to make “baby-led weaning meatballs” and they turned into a mushy, unrecognizable blob. Or how you discovered that frozen mango chunks are 100% a valid “meal” when you’re out of fresh veggies. Here, the messier the kitchen, the better the story. Because when it comes to feeding tiny humans, success isn’t a perfect puree—it’s getting them to open their mouth again (even if it’s just to yell “NO!”).",1,1753687546.0,BabyFoodRecipesInfo,0,1.0,False

Especially for my BDD ppl, i dont consider myself a bdd person nor do i associate with it but i have it. Sad. 
Anyways, idk much about bdd but i inow its HEL*. i went thru multiple addictions, sui**** ideation, depression that whole thing blah blah. Living in survival mode all my life. 

Anywho, after trying everything i settled on trying to regulate my nervous system and searching for videos to do that. After hours of research, i found an amazing guy from tiktok named Star taylor jesse. His technique is so powerful and easy. 

I always told myself if i ever find a “cure” for bdd i will fully trust whatever process gets me there.  It isnt a cure but offers 99% relief. EASILY. Ive been applying it for 13 days now and i completely feel i dont have bdd even though theres split seconds where i want to “check” the mirror over and over. 

My bdd consisted of checking my feet, my forehead, my ass and touching and squeezing and obsessiong over loose skin, its hands down the WORST disorder i have. I can spend 4 hrs obsessing pulling tugging for relief. Every few months it changes locations which is so weird. I also feel weird sensations in those body parts as well, and like a heart sinking feeling everytime i think of them.

But The technique is all about how you respond to your thoughts. Most of us are struggling to shut those urges or thiughts up which invoke anxiety and anxiety causes you to check to find relief and youre in this horrible cycle. Well long story short, is stop fighting those thoughts and feelings and tell yourself, they can be there but you’re not “responding” to them, meaning when they come up dont engage. So you cant control the thoughts of feelings that come up but you can control if you talk back to those thoughrts and thats where the magic lies. 
So sometimes my mind will give me such horrible intrusive thoughts about my body parts i cant ignore it and i didnt know how to stop, all i knew was i wanted to get rid of it, the more i tried to the stronger they became. So applying this technique of not reacting to those images or thoughts and allowing them to be there but not engaging with them then focus on something else is so awesome. And its EASY

If a compulsion to check comes up i say it can be there but im not engaging. The anxiety levels stay low and they fade, but if i start to engage with it and overthink it turns into a shitshow that i cant stop. Anywho, this has been working so well for me and i said if it keeps working this well for 10 days ill share it to others who need this help.

Of course, im not sitting here just using this tool as an aid, but im also doing joe dispenza meditations to heal my body fully and this technique works really well for keeping my mind and body out of survival and negative thinking. I quit coffee 6 days ago and its been easy, minus the physical withdrawal. I also used it on chronic nail biting and its been 2 days and working really well.

I looked it up and apparently is ACT therapy, but i found out about it from stat’s tiktok. I hope this helps everyone who reads this. I swear its not BS

EDIT: listen it wont change your body or your appearance, but it has allowed to truly not give a **** anymore and find tremendous relief. Also living according to my values and goals regardless of how i feel is also another benefit, i also started working out 12 days ago and been at it since, so im moving forward in my life with far less effort than trying or forcing to move forward ever could",2,1753687522.0,BodyDysmorphia,0,0.75,False
1mb9pcr,https://www.reddit.com/r/CandyMafia/comments/1mb9pcr/why_canadian_candy_is_gaining_global_recognition/,Why Canadian Candy Is Gaining Global Recognition,"From the sugar-dusted shores of maple leaf country to shelves in candy aisles around the world, [**Canadian candy**](https://candyville.ca) is experiencing a sweet surge of global recognition. Once an underrated niche in the international sweets market, Canadian confections are now creating a buzz in both nostalgic circles and gourmet candy communities. What’s behind this growing appreciation for treats from the Great White North?

In this blog, we’ll unwrap the reasons why **Canadian candy** is captivating international taste buds—and how **Candyville**, your go-to [**candy store in Toronto**](https://candyville.ca) and **online candy store**, is helping fuel this movement.

https://preview.redd.it/8ww40kvzgkff1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=49ed635c889adbe918ac3a0226f3debce34f6b39

**1. Distinctly Canadian Flavours**

One of the most enticing aspects of Canadian candy is its unique flavour profile. While American or European treats might lean toward sour extremes or ultra-sweet finishes, Canadian confections strike a satisfying balance, often incorporating homegrown ingredients like maple syrup, wild berries, and locally sourced chocolate.

Take for example the iconic Maple Candy—a melt-in-your-mouth treat made from 100% pure maple syrup, boiled down to perfection. Or the classic Coffee Crisp, with its light wafer and rich coffee notes, beloved by both locals and tourists. These flavours aren’t just candy—they’re a cultural snapshot.

**2. Global Shoppers Are Going Local—Virtually**

As eCommerce bridges borders, international consumers are now exploring local flavours without leaving home. And that’s where [**Candyville** ](https://candyville.ca)shines.

Whether you're in Vancouver or Vienna, you can shop Canadian favourites via Candyville’s [**online candy store**](https://candyville.ca). This ease of access has made it simpler than ever for global candy lovers to discover Canadian classics and stock up on hard-to-find sweets from Canada.

Through curated selections and exclusive imports, Candyville makes sure that every package tells a story, delivering a piece of Canadian culture in every bite.

**3. Iconic Brands with Cult Followings**

Canada is home to brands that have developed cult-like fanbases both at home and abroad. Treats like:

* Smarties (Canada’s version) – With a smoother chocolate center and vibrant candy shell, these are not your average Smarties.
* Big Turk – A combination of Turkish delight and chocolate that’s refreshingly different.
* Thrills Gum – Infamous for tasting like soap (yes, really!), this nostalgic treat remains a conversation starter.
* Aero Bars – With their bubbly, aerated texture, Aero bars have fascinated candy fans across continents.

These unique offerings have been praised on candy blogs, YouTube snack reviews, and foodie TikTok accounts around the globe—further propelling Canadian candy into the spotlight.

**4. Innovation Meets Nostalgia**

The Canadian candy scene is a delightful mix of old-school nostalgia and modern innovation. While long-standing favourites like Maynards Wine Gums or Eat-More bars still dominate the market, newer brands are reimagining classics with gourmet twists, exotic ingredients, and sustainable packaging.

This balance appeals to two kinds of global consumers:

* The nostalgic snacker looking to relive a childhood treat.
* The adventurous foodie craving something new, unique, and Instagram-worthy.

Candyville caters to both. Whether you're craving a vintage candy from your youth or hunting for the latest limited-edition sweet, our **candy store in Toronto** and digital shelves have something for every kind of sweet tooth.

**5. Canada’s Multicultural Influence on Candy**

Canada’s rich cultural mosaic contributes to a diverse and flavourful confectionery scene. From imported European sweets to Asian and Middle Eastern treats stocked in Canadian stores, the blend of influences creates a vibrant candy landscape.

This multiculturalism encourages local candy makers to experiment with bold flavour fusions—think matcha white chocolate bars, tamarind gummies, or sour lychee chews.

At **Candyville**, this diversity is not just reflected—it’s celebrated. Our inventory is a love letter to global flavours with a Canadian heart, showcasing a world of candy under one roof.

**6. Support for Ethical and Artisanal Candy**

As the global candy consumer becomes more conscious about ingredient sourcing, labor ethics, and sustainability, Canadian candy makers have stepped up. Many local brands focus on:

* Fair trade cocoa
* Eco-friendly packaging
* Organic ingredients
* Small-batch production

This commitment to quality and ethics has helped Canadian candy gain respect among international gourmet markets, where consumers are willing to pay more for a responsible indulgence.

**7. Candyville: Canada’s Gateway to Sweet Global Fame**

As a leading **candy store in Toronto** and trusted online candy store, Candyville plays a key role in connecting the world to the best of Canadian confections. Whether you're a local looking to rediscover your favourite childhood snack or an international shopper eager to taste what the buzz is all about, Candyville is your direct line to authentic Canadian candy culture.

With nationwide shipping, curated bundles, and an ever-growing catalog, we make exploring Canadian candy simple, fun, and incredibly delicious.

1mb9ny5,https://www.reddit.com/r/romancenovels/comments/1mb9ny5/the_wedding_theyll_never_forget/,The Wedding They'll Never Forget,"Chapter 1  
  
Paul and I had spent over a decade building a life together—growing our business, mapping out our future, and counting down to the wedding we'd always dreamed of. Then, with one accidental click, it all shattered.  
  
I found a shared document in his Cloud Drive—one I was never supposed to see. Inside were secret meet-up plans, steamy love notes, and hotel receipts. The gut punch? He was cheating with Claire Winslow, my most trusted employee. In that moment, something inside me snapped.  
  
Our perfect life? A sham. Our business? Soon to be mine alone. And the wedding? Oh, it wasn't getting canceled. It was going to be the beginning of their nightmare.  
  
I wasn't some weepy fiancée who'd slink away quietly. No, I'd take everything from them—piece by piece, until there was nothing left. They thought they could betray me and walk off unscathed. They had no idea who they were dealing with.  
  
Wedding planning had me swamped—juggling work while prepping for what was supposed to be the happiest day of my life. One night, as I finalized our guest list, I shared it with Paul via Cloud Drive. He was away at a conference, so this was how we stayed organized. Everything seemed flawless… until I noticed something odd.  
  
A few days earlier, he'd logged into his email on my laptop, so when I opened the drive that night, it defaulted to his account. Scrolling through folders, one document stood out: \[Business Projections Q3\]. Dry title, standard stuff—except I hadn't created it, and it wasn't tied to any active project.  
  
Curiosity got the best of me.  
  
I clicked, expecting spreadsheets. Instead, the first line hit like a sucker punch: \[Can't stop thinking about that night at the hotel… next time I'll wear red.\] My stomach lurched. This wasn't a work file. It was shared exclusively between Paul and an unfamiliar email: \[email protected\].  
  
Hands shaking, I checked the edit history. The full story unfolded—coded talk of post-meeting hookups, fake ""work dinners,"" even plans to keep their affair going after our wedding like it was just a minor inconvenience.  
  
I sat there, numb. They'd used our business as cover, plotting romantic escapes while I'd poured my soul into building our future. The document wasn't even hidden. He'd gotten so bold, so sloppy, he didn't bother deleting the evidence. Now it glared at me from his shared folder, a cruel cosmic joke.  
  
""Hey, Ruby—sorry, I can't make the tasting today. Can your mom go with you?"" Paul's voice was all fake regret when I called to remind him. Same excuse, different day. I forced a breezy tone. ""No problem. Just don't overdo it at work, okay?""  
  
The second I hung up, my fists clenched. His reckoning was coming. And I'd make sure it hurt.  
  
After days of ugly crying and rage-spiraling, I pulled myself together. Step one of my ten-part revenge plan? Gather proof.  
  
Thanks to our shared WeCloud account—meant for syncing calendars and photos—I dug through his phone, emails, and bank records without tipping him off. Scrolling my photo gallery, I spotted new uploads from his device. Mostly boring work shots… until I landed on a lingerie selfie of Claire in a hotel mirror.  
  
My chest caved. Swiping frantically, the next photo sealed it: Paul, shirtless in the same room, smirking at the camera.  
  
Then, while working from home (as he ""stayed late at a meeting""), I opened our Streamify app and spotted a private playlist called \[Late Nights\]. Not our music. Not public. Clicking it revealed a soundtrack to their affair—songs like ""Secret Love Song"" and ""Dirty Little Secret,"" peppered with Claire's notes: \[For our weekend getaway\], \[That night.\]  
  
It took weeks, sneaking around wedding prep and work, but soon I had it all—messages, receipts, photos. Filed away, ready for the perfect moment. I'd strike when it destroyed them most.  
  
  
  
Chapter 2  
  
The second step was cutting him off from our social circle—but I had to be smart about it. Too fast, and he'd notice. Too obvious, and I'd look suspicious. So I started small, planting seeds in casual conversations.  
  
Over brunch with friends, I'd sigh and say, ""He's been so busy lately—always out of town for work. I get it, but with the wedding coming up… I just wish he were around more.""  
  
The perfect balance of understanding and subtle concern. Just enough to make them sympathetic—but also suspicious. I'd brush it off with a smile, like it was no big deal, but I could see the doubt flicker in their eyes.  
  
Over time, I painted him as distracted, distant—unreliable. When his friends (who conveniently worked with me) asked about wedding plans, I'd say, ""Oh, I've been handling most of it. He's swamped with work, flying out every other week. But it's fine—he's stressed.""  
  
The more I played the patient fiancée, the more people questioned him. They'd whisper behind his back—Why isn't he helping? Doesn't he care? Friends texted to ""check in,"" some outright saying, ""It's weird he's not more involved, don't you think?""  
  
I'd laugh it off, playing supportive, but the damage was done. His friends stopped inviting him out—""Didn't want to bother him."" Others made excuses when he reached out. ""Too busy.""  
  
I never accused him outright—that would've been too obvious. Instead, I let them believe he was the problem. And slowly, they all drifted to my side.  
  
By the time he noticed, he was already isolated.  
  
While he was distracted with her, I moved to step three: taking control of our assets.  
  
This wasn't something I could rush—he was too involved in the business. So I worked quietly, under the radar.  
  
I started small. During meetings with our accountant, I'd ""double-check"" paperwork he'd already signed. He'd wave me off—""You handle it."" Perfect.  
  
Soon, I was the one managing everything—contracts, investments, property. I slipped in clauses, transferred assets to my name, rewrote documents. All while he was too preoccupied to notice.  
  
I even hired my own lawyer—someone he didn't know—specializing in hostile takeovers. We built an airtight case. If he ever fought back, I'd win.  
  
By the time he glanced at a bank statement or questioned a decision, I had an answer ready. ""It's all under control."" And he'd relax, trusting me.  
  
He had no idea I was stealing everything from him.  
  
Soon, the business he thought we shared would be mine—every asset, every dollar, every property.  
  
And he'd have nothing.  
  
  
  
Chapter 3  
  
Claire Winslow wasn't just his secret lover—she was one of our longest-standing employees, practically there since day one. She held a key role in the company, which made things complicated, but also gave me the perfect opportunity to ruin them both. If I played my cards right, I wouldn't just expose their affair—I'd destroy their careers in the process.  
  
I knew I couldn't just blow the whistle without consequences, so instead, I took my time dismantling her position, piece by piece. This was step four.  
  
First, I needed to plant the seeds of doubt. Whenever Claire and I discussed potential business leads, I'd ""accidentally"" slip her bad intel.  
  
""Hey, Claire,"" I'd say casually over coffee, ""I heard from a contact there's a big investor eyeing our market. Might be worth looking into.""  
  
Of course, the deals always fell through. The investors I sent her to were either uninterested or notoriously difficult to work with.  
  
Before long, Claire started fumbling in meetings, looking more and more incompetent in front of the board. Rumors about her failures spread fast, and she had no idea I was the one pulling the strings.  
  
Nobody called her out directly, but the writing was on the wall—she was being phased out. Fewer meetings, fewer requests for her input. It was only a matter of time.  
  
But I didn't stop there. While she was busy chasing dead-end leads, I worked behind the scenes to rally the team around me. I positioned myself as the indispensable leader—the one who got things done.  
  
Every time Claire messed up, I was there to clean up the mess, making sure the team saw me as the steady hand they could trust.  
  
In meetings, I'd drop subtle hints about her poor judgment. ""I know Claire thought this deal was promising, but it seems like things didn't pan out… again. Maybe we should rethink our approach.""  
  
I never outright blamed her—just enough to make everyone question if she was cut out for leadership.  
  
Behind closed doors, I worked key team members, taking them out for drinks, planting doubts. ""Look, I know Claire means well, but she's been making some risky calls lately. We can't afford to keep losing investors.""  
  
Slowly, they started seeing me as the real leader. Every mistake she made pushed them further into my corner.  
  
By the time board meetings rolled around, I was the problem solver while Claire struggled to explain why her deals kept collapsing. Her confidence crumbled—she grew defensive, desperate, which only made her mistakes more obvious.  
  
When the moment was right, I struck.  
  
In a critical meeting, I laid out her string of failures, letting the investors and board members grill her with questions she couldn't answer. Then, I made my move—suggesting a vote of no confidence, proposing I take over her responsibilities to ""stabilize"" the company.  
  
With the groundwork I'd laid, it was effortless. The board voted in my favor, and just like that, Claire was out.  
  
A classic quiet firing—we shuffled her into a dead-end department, making her miserable until she'd have no choice but to quit on her own.  
  
She never saw it coming. Too wrapped up in her affair with my fiancé to realize I'd been orchestrating her downfall from the start.  
  
The best part? She couldn't even blame me without looking like a sore loser.

[Budget 1k€],"So right now I'm rocking a DF64 gen 1 with SSP MP burrs paired with a Linea Micra. Working mostly with medium roast / omni-light (which isn't really that  light) roasts. 

I'm going through about 2.5kg of coffee per month - basically 4 coffees per day. Combination of espresso and milk based drinks. Maybe sometimes I'll grind for a cold brew.

I'm gonna get some bonus in about two months so I started researching a treat for myself 😅. Ideally I wouldn't want to get over 1k€, but I have the mazzer philos on my shortlist as a stretch - just because its so highly regarded.

 I want something that will last - same as with my Micra. I also want to maybe be able to experiment with different burrs and coffee properties.

My shortlist is:
- Varia VS6 (this started the whole upgraditis thing) with a couple of burrs to get to that 1k budget 
- Timemore 078s
- Mazzer Philos with the 200D burrs, though I'm not feeling it as much. The dial at the back seems clunky to use and it's big AF
- Mahlkönig x64sd - though this seems a bit of a let down
- Df83v ( the horizontal one). Though I would stay away from the df grinder for now. 

I'm not really considering the niche just because...well I don't like it as much 🤷 something bugs me about it. But if this subreddit can agree that it's that good, I'll take it. Functionality is key! 

Now one thing that confuses me. For most of these grinders, you have the ability to upgrade to ssp burrs. But isn't that just gonna give me the same-ish profile as my df64?

The other is, which one of these grinders is going to give me a sweeter profile? I like a decent amount of acidity, but I don't want it to be a dominating flavor. I like fruity coffees more.

## Key Features Analysis

The Cirkul water bottle boasts several unique features designed to enhance the drinking experience.

**Flavor Customization:**

The core appeal of Cirkul lies in its ability to customize the intensity of flavoring. Users can adjust a dial on the Sip cartridge to control the amount of flavor released into their water. This allows for everything from a subtle hint of flavor to a more pronounced taste, catering to individual preferences. This degree of control is what separates it from other flavored water products.

**Variety of Sip Flavors:**

Cirkul offers an extensive range of Sip flavors, encompassing everything from fruit flavors and teas to coffee and energy blends. The sheer variety ensures that there's likely a flavor to suit almost anyone's palate. They regularly introduce new and limited-edition flavors, maintaining user engagement and providing ongoing incentive to remain within the Cirkul ecosystem.

**reusable and BPA-Free Bottle:**

The Cirkul water bottle itself is designed to be reusable, contributing to a reduction in single-use plastic waste. Made from BPA-free materials, it ensures that no harmful chemicals leach into the water, providing a safe and environmentally conscious hydration option. The bottles are available in various sizes and materials, including stainless steel and plastic options, to meet different needs and preferences.

**Adjustable Flow Rate:**

The Cirkul bottle features an adjustable flow rate, allowing users to control the speed at which water is dispensed. This can be notably useful during physical activities where a higher flow rate is desired, or when simply wanting a more controlled and slower sipping experience. This level of customization adds to the overall user experience.**Sip Subscription Service:**

Cirkul operates on a subscription model,offering users the convenience of having their favorite Sips delivered regularly to their doorstep. This ensures they never run out of their preferred flavors and allows them to explore new options with ease. The subscription is flexible and can be adjusted or paused as needed, providing a convenient and customizable experience.

Key features of the Cirkul water bottle include:

## Core Benefits

Cirkul water bottles offer several compelling benefits for users seeking a more enjoyable and sustainable hydration experience.

**Increased Water Consumption:** For many people, the primary benefit of Cirkul is its ability to increase water consumption. The variety of flavors and the ability to customize the intensity make drinking water more appealing, leading to better hydration habits. Individuals who struggle to drink plain water may find Cirkul a helpful tool for staying hydrated throughout the day.

**Reduced Sugar Intake:** Compared to many flavored beverages, Cirkul offers a lower sugar alternative. The Sips are designed to provide flavor without excessive sugar, helping users reduce their overall sugar intake while still enjoying a flavorful drink. This makes it a healthier option for quenching thirst without the guilt associated with sugary sodas or juices.

**Environmentally Amiable:** By encouraging the use of reusable water bottles and reducing reliance on pre-packaged flavored drinks, Cirkul contributes to a more sustainable lifestyle. The reusable bottle reduces plastic waste, and the Sip cartridges are designed with recyclability in mind. This makes it a more environmentally responsible choice compared to purchasing single-use bottled beverages.

**cost Savings:** While the initial investment in a Cirkul bottle and Sips may seem higher than purchasing plain water, the long-term cost savings can be significant. By eliminating the need to buy bottled flavored drinks, users can save money over time. The subscription service also offers potential discounts and deals on Sip refills, further enhancing the cost-effectiveness of the system.

**Enhanced Flavor Experience:** The adjustable flavor dial and wide variety of Sip flavors provide a level of control. The ability to experiment with different flavor combinations and create personalized hydration blends makes drinking water a more enjoyable and engaging experience.

## FAQs Section

**Are Cirkul Sips healthy?**
Cirkul Sips are formulated to be low in calories and sugar. However, the nutritional content varies by flavor. It's recommended to review the specific nutritional facts for each Sip before consumption. Some Sips contain added vitamins and electrolytes, while others are solely focused on providing flavor.

**How long does a Cirkul Sip last?**
The lifespan of a Cirkul Sip depends on individual usage and the flavor intensity selected.Generally, one Sip cartridge is designed to flavor approximately six 20-ounce bottles of water when used at a medium flavor intensity. Frequent use at high intensity will deplete the Sip more quickly.**Can I use Cirkul with other beverages besides water?**
Cirkul is designed to be used with water. Using it with other beverages may affect the performance and flavor of the Sips. It is not recommended to use it with carbonated beverages, as this may cause leaks or damage to the bottle.

**what materials are used in the Cirkul bottle?**
The Cirkul bottle is typically made from BPA-free plastic or stainless steel, depending on the model.Both materials are food-grade and safe for consumption. Be sure to check the product specifications for the exact materials used in a particular bottle model.

1mb9kbz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianmarriage/comments/1mb9kbz/respecting_husbands/,Respecting Husbands,"I am confused about how to make my husband feel respected. Overall I feel like our marriage is pretty good and we usually get along well. We have three kids (8, 6, 4). We are intimate a few times a week. I try to thank him for everything he does for us, but I could probably do it more often. But things will happen that my husband says make him feel disrespected and he gets pretty offended. Tonight he told me that I really need to be more self-aware. I feel like I try to be, but I can’t always anticipate what will offend him and make him feel disrespected. The last four examples I can think of that happened in the past month or so have been the causes of our main conflicts:



-The four year old was rolling on the floor with a cup of cheezits and spilled while hubby and I were both in the room (but I had a clearer line of sight) - he said he felt disrespected because he made the money to buy the snacks that got wasted and I should have had a talk with her about respecting Daddy by not wasting food, or better yet told her to not roll around and sit nice in the first place (I agree that we shouldn’t let her do this and said I was sorry, I was a little tired and zoned out and didn’t register what she was doing until it was too late). He still wanted her to eat them mixed with dog hair while I wanted to throw the handful of cheezits away.



-He was laying on the couch in the living room. The kids and I were planning to play a board game and asked if he wanted to play while we were setting it up on the coffee table. He said he wanted to try to take a nap. We tried to play quietly as he dozed. I showed the kids how to roll the dice low and on the game board to reduce noise from the dice, but honestly, I figured if I was napping on the couch I would assume the rest of the house would go about their normal day. After getting woken up by the 4 year old talking he went to lay in our bed but had trouble falling back asleep and stayed there for almost 2 hours. I still tried to keep everyone quiet for the afternoon because I thought he was sleeping. We read books, played games, and went outside. He told me later that our room was too hot to sleep in (it does get hot, we have a supplemental AC that hadn’t cooled it yet) and that’s why he was trying to nap on the couch. He said that I really should have taken the kids to the other room and put on a movie so he could sleep in the living room and that I should have known he wouldn’t be able to nap with us in the room without him having to say anything. 



-He asked me for help getting things out while grilling. I said “yes” but I did another task for the kids first because I figured the grill had to heat up and I had plenty of time to get the things out. He started the grill and immediately got the things out he asked me to get out. He said I should have helped right away or at least said “I’ll help after I do this other task” and that saying yes but not acting right away was disrespectful.



-He asked if I would harvest the lettuce. I said I’d be harvesting the lettuce that day (it was on my mental checklist for the day), but the kids and I started on some other tasks that lasted until dinner, so I grabbed enough lettuce for my husband in case he wanted some for lunch the next day and decided I would harvest the full beds the next day (and did). He said if I told him something and my plans changed I should have texted him an update. He gave the example that if someone at work says they will do something they either do it or let him know when they will be doing it if it gets delayed. I just didn’t think harvesting the lettuce a day later could be such a big deal, especially since he isn’t all that involved with planting/harvesting the garden. He said it shows that I don’t respect the time he took to till and build the wooden frames.



Are these examples of disrespect? I realize hindsight is 20/20 for these specific cases, but I often have a hard time anticipating the things that communicate disrespect to him and preventing them. I have shared with him that other people making mistakes is not the same as intentional disrespect, but that doesn’t seem to change the way he perceives it. I don’t know, it all seems so silly typed out. I feel like I give him a lot of grace and don’t read too much into small mistakes or normal changes/things that happen. I am working on just keeping my mouth shut when he shares his frustration and just apologizing even though I’d really just appreciate some grace. Maybe I’m being disrespectful and not realizing it? Would the average Christian man find these mistakes/choices disrespectful? 

Sorry for the long post. I am trying to include enough details and paint a clear picture while also not writing a book.

1mb9k08,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1mb9k08/i_feel_like_my_friends_love_me_but_they_dont_like/,I feel like my friends love me but they don't like me. How do I fix the situation?,"It is absolutely possible that I've been an ass recently and I apologize if that's the situation. I'm currently going into my senior year of high school and I feel like I don't have any friends. Sure, I have people who would call me a friend but nobody asks me to go out with them anymore. There's a good reason for this and it all kinda started my junior year. I know I've just lost people by turning this into a story you have to keep track of but whatever. My theater friend group consisted of two then seniors (whom I'll call Ezra and Sarah), another then junior (whom I'll call Betty) and a then sophomore (who I'll call Jaina). This all took place this summer. Betty and I have been best friends for years and she had been doing some things that annoyed me. I had been venting about her to my friends Ezra and Jaina. Jaina especially. I had been getting a lot closer to Jaina and we eventually both realized we had feelings for each other. She and I begun seeing each other to test how something between us would go. Eventually, me and Jaina were out at the mall and we ran into Betty, Sarah, and another mutual friend. We talked for a bit and said goodbye. Eventually Sarah texted me saying that Betty was really upset that me and Jaina were hanging out together without her. At the time, I was pissed because she hadn't reached out to hang out with me all summer. Now, I realize that I also never reached out to her because I was still figuring out exactly what about her had been annoying me. Either way, neither of us had hung out one on one once and seeing me with Jaina was upsetting for Betty. Sarah told me that I NEEDED to talk to Betty about everything and so I did. I called Betty and we talked in a remote part of the mall together about what had been bothering me recently. This, looking back, was not the time nor the place. In my defense, this is the first time that I've ever had to talk to someone like this before and I had no idea what I was doing. I'm just some punk kid, really. On the other hand, this probably disturbed Betty so I feel bad. She didn't say much during the conversation, just looked scared and upset. I almost started crying but I stayed put together. She wished I had told her sooner and I do too. I just didn't know how to tell her until recently. After that, me and Jaina continued hanging out. That night we had a sleepover at her house and we were flirting and kissing. I realized while kissing her that I wasn't feeling anything*.* Shit. A few days ago, my birthday party required the whole gang to get together again. Impeccable timing, really. I really hope you can read my sarcasm through a computer because this party genuinely could not have come at a worse time. I offer the guests to stay the night and Jaina's the only one who can stay. I avoid kissing her the whole night, still deluding myself into believing that this is what romance feels like! In my defense, it was hard to know whether or not I had a crush on her because she's pretty and smart and funny. In the end, I just didn't feel anything beyond really high respect and admiration for my friend. I told her yesterday and she took it as well as she could. She was hurt, of course, but she didn't get mad at me. I'm sure she is mad but she handled everything well. Her and Betty have been talking about me together (Betty posted on her story that Jaina and her were talking about being upset by a ""situation"" and it's no coincidence that I rejected Jaina hours prior). I can't talk to Ezra or Sarah because before the ""breakup,"" Ezra, Sarah, and Betty were all hanging out together without me. Now Ezra, Sarah, Betty, AND Jaina are all hanging out without me! This has been going on for weeks, too. This isn't just a rejection or impromptu-mall-conversation thing, this has been happening all summer! They all go to the beach or go grab coffee or hang out at each other's houses all the time. I don't understand. We were all so close last school year and now I feel like none of them like me. I mean, I get that some things have changed but I didn't expect to feel this alone. What do I do? Am I completely in the wrong here? Did I post this in the completely wrong subreddit?

""Sweetheart, please... just do this one thing for me. If you give in to Mr. Lowell, I'll finally get that Director promotion...""  
  
Tears blurred my vision as I stood outside the hotel, wiping them away with trembling fingers. My husband's desperate plea echoed in my ears. Then, steeling myself, I walked toward that room.  
  
What I didn't know—what I couldn't have known—was that Mr. Lowell wasn't alone.  
  
Inside, several middle-aged men waited, all with thick necks and greedy eyes.  
  
Because the ""Mr. Lowell"" my husband had mentioned wasn't just one man.  
  
My stomach twisted. I wanted to run, but my legs wouldn't obey.  
  
The juice Daniel had given me earlier… something was off.  
  
My name is Emily Laurent. I've been married for just a year.  
  
Life with Daniel had been perfect—until it wasn't.  
  
For the past month, he'd been drowning under work pressure, obsessed with landing a promotion.  
  
Tonight, he invited his boss, Richard Lowell, to our home for dinner—a last-ditch effort to secure his future.  
  
I left work early, bought fresh ingredients, and cooked my best dishes—roast chicken, garlic mashed potatoes, glazed carrots—paired with two bottles of expensive Cabernet.  
  
When Daniel arrived with Mr. Lowell, I forced a polite smile.  
  
First impression? Greasy. Overweight. Balding. The kind of man who made your skin crawl.  
  
No wonder Daniel joked privately that people called him ""Fat Richard.""  
  
The moment he stepped inside, his beady eyes locked onto me.  
  
""Emily, what a lovely wife you have,"" he said, gripping my hand too tightly, his thumb brushing my knuckles. ""Beautiful and talented, I bet.""  
  
I yanked my hand back, mumbling an excuse to wash up in the kitchen. Only then could I steady my breathing before bringing out the rice.  
  
Dinner was a performance. Mr. Lowell raved about my cooking while Daniel nudged me under the table—Keep drinking with him. Smile more.  
  
I wasn't a drinker. One glass left me dizzy.  
  
Daniel, though, downed most of the wine, laughing too loud, steering every conversation back to the promotion—only for Mr. Lowell to smirk and change the subject.  
  
After dessert, they lounged on the sofa while I cleaned up.  
  
Then—hands. Thick, clammy hands snaking around my waist from behind.  
  
I spun around.  
  
Not Daniel.  
  
Mr. Lowell loomed over me, his breath reeking of wine.  
  
""Mr. Lowell—you're drunk. Let me pass—""  
  
He blocked the doorway, arms spread. ""Emily... your husband's passed out cold. You do want that promotion for him, don't you?""  
  
His grin widened as he reached out, his fingers grazing my cheek.  
  
  
  
Chapter 2  
  
My body locked up for a heartbeat, my mind blank with shock.  
  
But when Richard Lowell's fingers grazed toward me, my reflexes kicked in—I swatted his arm away and bolted from the kitchen like my life depended on it.  
  
The living room revealed Daniel sprawled on the couch, snoring lightly like nothing was wrong.  
  
Richard materialized in the doorway moments later, his expression sour. ""Well, Emily,"" he said, adjusting his tie, ""since you're... indisposed, we'll continue this conversation at the office tomorrow. About your husband's promotion, of course.""  
  
He paused at the door, flashing teeth that didn't reach his eyes. ""Oh, and compliments to the chef. That pot roast was divine.""  
  
I managed a stiff nod, my goodbye wave trembling. The second the door clicked shut, I exhaled like I'd been punched.  
  
Daniel groaned awake almost immediately. ""Where's Richard?"" he mumbled, rubbing his face.  
  
My throat tightened. ""Honey, that man—he's not who you think. His hands were all over—""  
  
""Come on,"" Daniel scoffed, suddenly alert. ""Every woman at the firm worships him. They have lunch dates, for Christ's sake.""  
  
The words shriveled in my mouth. I'd expected concern, maybe anger—not this blind defense.  
  
Weeks passed with Daniel's promotion dangling like a carrot. Then came the confession over takeout: ""It's Sophia Roland now,"" he admitted, pushing lo mein around his plate. ""Rumor is she showed up at Richard's place with 'gifts' last night. Babe, if you just—""  
  
""Absolutely not."" My chopsticks clattered onto the table. That slimy smirk of Richard's haunted me.  
  
Daniel caught my wrist. ""This is our future. Double salary. Annual bonuses. Maybe even Bali?"" His thumbs traced circles on my skin—the way he'd done during our courthouse wedding. ""One dinner. One gift. That's all.""  
  
I should've held firm. But the bags under his eyes, the way his dress shirts hung looser these days...  
  
""Fine,"" I whispered.  
  
Two hours later, I stood shivering in the driveway—black miniskirt riding up, stockings snagging on my own doubts—wondering how delivering a bottle of Scotch turned into this.  
  
  
  
Chapter 3  
  
My husband drove me to Mr. Lowell's apartment building, his knuckles white on the steering wheel. He thrust the carefully wrapped gifts into my hands. ""You should go up alone,"" he said, avoiding my eyes.  
  
The elevator ride felt endless. When I reached the penthouse, I barely had time to ring the bell before the door flew open—revealing Sophia Roland, our office manager, draped over Mr. Lowell like a human necklace, her lips planted on his neck.  
  
My breath caught. For a heartbeat, I thought I'd interrupted a marital moment—until recognition hit. Sophia recovered first, flashing a Cheshire cat smile as she sauntered past me. Her blouse buttons were mismatched, and when our eyes met, hers burned with pure venom.  
  
""Here about Daniel's promotion?"" she purred, leaning close enough for me to smell her Chanel No. 5. ""Good luck with that."" Her mocking laughter trailed behind her like toxic perfume.  
  
""Emily! What a surprise!"" Mr. Lowell boomed, acting like we'd just bumped into each other at a coffee shop. The apartment was conspicuously empty—no wife, no kids, just an uncomfortable silence and my pounding heart.  
  
I extended the gifts with both hands, my smile straining. His fingers lingered too long against mine, the contact making my skin crawl after what I'd just witnessed.  
  
He poured water I didn't want. ""Your husband's talented, no question,"" he began, circling like a shark. ""But the board favors Sophia for this promotion..."" His eyes dropped to my wedding ring. ""Unless you're willing to... negotiate.""  
  
The implication hung between us, thick as cigar smoke. When I didn't respond, he waved at the untouched gifts. ""Take these back. Meet me tomorrow at The Ritz-Carlton—Suite 808. Show up, and Daniel gets promoted the next morning."" His smile turned wolfish. ""Sleep on it.""  
  
Daniel's face darkened when he saw the rejected gifts. He slammed the steering wheel so hard the horn blared. ""Goddammit! I knew Sophia would pull this shit!""  
  
""You sent me in there knowing?"" My voice cracked. ""Were you offering me as bait?""  
  
His anger crumpled. ""Never! But Emily... this promotion..."" His phone rang—his mother asking about the raise we'd promised would let us start a family. Watching him lie to her broke something in me.  
  
That night, Daniel unraveled in our bed, painting dreams of me quitting my job, of nursery walls and college funds. His desperation wore me down until I whispered, ""I'll go.""  
  
The next evening, he handed me juice outside The Ritz-Carlton. ""For courage,"" he said, avoiding my eyes as the elevator doors closed between us.  
  
Suite 808's door swung open to reveal Richard in a robe that barely covered his smug grin. But when I stepped inside, my blood turned to ice—five more men in identical robes stood waiting, their hungry smiles mirroring Richard's.

Having an opinion like this of course means that regular coffee drinkers feel the need to defend their favorite drink whenever its taste is mentioned. The defences are immediately up and they go pretty much the same route: ""you have taste buds of a kid"", ""you just didn't drink well made coffee"", ""you need more milk/sweetener/whatever"" etc...

I can drink alcohol and think that beer generally tastes good, so not like I can't drink ""grown up"" drinks lol. I also tried various types of coffee and when other people made it. I never made it myself so it's not like I don't know how to make it good or whatever. I also tried some types of coffee that coffee drinkers swear up and down is delicious and to me, it just tastes like liquid mud with some bitterness.

I also think that a lot of people drink coffee just because it's fitting. I can't imagine anyone really liking this drink.",3,1753686504.0,unpopularopinion,26,0.53,False

I woke up to a second life—this time determined to avoid every single run-in with Ethan.  
  
When he said he wasn't going home for break, I packed my bags and left for the village alone.  
  
He helped Linda rent the house next door, so I moved out.  
  
He chose to stay at the school for work, so I applied to Northwest Industrial University instead.  
  
In my past life, even our own children had begged me to divorce him when we were old—just so that after death, he and Linda, that ill-fated pair, could be buried together.  
  
Staring at my acceptance letter, I nearly broke down.  
  
No one knew I'd been given a second chance.  
  
At the last possible moment, I switched my college application to Northwest Industrial.  
  
Even my teacher was stunned. ""Didn't you say your fiancé was staying here? Going so far away—do you really think he'll wait for you?""  
  
At the mention of Ethan, his younger self flashed in my mind—tall, handsome, the golden boy everyone admired.  
  
Truth was, people always thought I'd lucked out. He was ambitious, striking, now a military officer—while I was just the girl who'd stumbled into his life through an outdated betrothal.  
  
I smiled and answered loud enough for the whole room to hear: ""Teacher, we live in the age of free love now.""  
  
""That engagement? A relic of feudal society. Unacceptable!""  
  
She blinked, then grinned and patted my shoulder, eyes shining with approval.  
  
School was over. I stepped outside, melting into the crowd, finally free.  
  
  
  
Chapter 2  
  
In my past life, I never made it to college.  
  
Ethan and I were set to marry in just a few days, and soon after, I became a mother—so my education ended there. Ethan stayed in school a little longer before enlisting in the army.  
  
Then, the distance between us grew.  
  
He climbed the ranks, and wherever he was stationed, Linda and her daughter followed.  
  
Meanwhile, I was trapped in a small world—serving his parents, raising our children, watching them grow from clingy toddlers into adults who slowly drifted toward Ethan's new life.  
  
By the time I found out about his wedding to Linda's daughter, it was already over. An old friend's photo showed them glowing, serving tea to their parents, looking every bit the happy family.  
  
Later, my own son begged me to divorce.  
  
""Mom,"" he said, ""Dad's suffered his whole life. If it weren't for you, he would've been with my mother-in-law years ago.""  
  
""Mom, you two were never right for each other. Why can't you just let go?""  
  
Even my daughter-in-law couldn't stand the sight of me.  
  
But how could I give up?  
  
I couldn't accept that I'd spent years nursing his parents when they were bedridden, while he was off with someone else.  
  
I couldn't accept that when our son spiked a fever in the middle of the night, I ran barefoot for miles to get help—while he was playing house, tutoring another woman's child.  
  
And I especially couldn't accept that after sacrificing everything for this family…  
  
He said it.  
  
They said it.  
  
Everyone said it.  
  
That we were never meant to be.  
  
That I was the one who refused to move on.  
  
But I held on.  
  
Years of hardship carved themselves into my face, leaving me worn and weary.  
  
Even in death, I swore I'd drag them down with me.  
  
As for whether they'd end up together after I was gone—I didn't care anymore.  
  
I was too tired to care.  
  
In the end, I died the day my son came to plead for the divorce one last time.  
  
He ranted, he begged, and when I stayed silent, he stormed out in anger.  
  
He never heard me call after him.  
  
He never saw me collapse the moment the door slammed.  
  
And in that final second, I regretted everything.  
  
Why had I clung to him?  
  
Why had I wasted my entire life on him?  
  
But then—  
  
I woke up.  
  
Back before I married Ethan.  
  
Back when everything could still be different.  
  
  
  
Chapter 3  
  
Back home, I tucked my acceptance letter away and got to work in the kitchen.  
  
The two-bedroom apartment was courtesy of Ethan's unit—a small perk that barely made up for everything else. As I chopped vegetables, my eyes drifted to the calendar hanging in the living room. There it was: the date for college orientation next month. I grabbed a red marker and circled it, my heart pounding.  
  
I stared at that bold red circle, a flicker of hope burning inside me.  
  
Soon.  
  
Soon, I'd be free.  
  
Ethan walked in just as dinner hit the table.  
  
Of course, Linda and her daughter trailed right behind him. ""Sis, sorry to drop by again,"" Linda said with that practiced smile of hers.  
  
She had that porcelain complexion, an oval face, and that bright red coat of hers—always dressed to impress.  
  
Her daughter, already treating the place like her second home, squealed at the sight of food and immediately helped herself—one bowl for her, one for Ethan, one for Linda.  
  
None for me.  
  
By the time I stepped out of the kitchen, the three of them were already cozied up at the table, laughing like some picture-perfect family.  
  
Then—spit.  
  
All three of them choked at the exact same second.  
  
""Mommy, it's like eating a salt lick!"" the kid whined.  
  
I just leaned against the kitchen doorway, arms crossed, watching Ethan scramble to pour them soup—as if that would help.  
  
Spoiler: It didn't. The soup was worse.  
  
Linda left in tears, of course. Right before storming out, she sniffled at Ethan, ""Your wife clearly hates me. I won't impose again.""  
  
Ethan walked her out like some dutiful knight, then came back scowling.  
  
I didn't bother waiting for the lecture. Just turned back to the stove and started chopping.  
  
""You did that on purpose?"" He sounded genuinely confused.  
  
Then came the sob story. ""Her husband died in the line of duty. Made me promise to look after them. And you—you cook so well. The kid loves your food.""  
  
I stayed quiet.  
  
Ethan sighed, shoulders slumping. ""Fine. If it bothers you that much, we won't invite them over anymore.""  
  
  
  
Chapter 4  
  
The morning after Ethan left, I pulled out my suitcase and started packing—I'd be heading back to the village in a few days.  
  
Sure, we'd been promised to each other since childhood, with all the formal exchanges of tokens and birthdates. But to truly cut ties, I needed to officially call off the engagement in front of the village elders. No loose ends.  
  
As I folded my clothes, I spotted the quilt covers and pillowcases I'd spent years secretly embroidering—tiny stitches, late nights, all for nothing. Without hesitation, I stuffed them into a bag, along with the new shoes I'd made, and marched down to the pawn shop at the end of the street.  
  
Thirty bucks. That's what years of careful needlework got me. Not much, but enough to cover meals and coffee at college for a while. Every penny counted.  
  
Back home, I grabbed a marker and slashed a thick X over today's date on the calendar.  
  
Twenty more days.  
  
Twenty days, and I'd be free.  
  
Ethan returned well past midnight.  
  
The dinner I'd made sat cold and untouched on the table.  
  
""I already ate at school,"" he said offhandedly.  
  
But the faint trace of white tea perfume clinging to him told me the truth—he'd been with Linda and her daughter. He must have gone out to avoid an awkward meal at home.  
  
I didn't press him. Silently, I cleared the dishes and retreated to my room.  
  
My high school textbooks and test papers were everywhere—piled on the desk, spilling onto the floor, even creeping into the living room. I started bundling up the ones in my bedroom, planning to tackle the rest tomorrow after Ethan left.  
  
Since I was moving out, none of my things had any right to stay.  
  
A soft knock interrupted me.  
  
Ethan. He always respected my space, never barging in without permission.  
  
""What is it?"" I asked, blocking his view of the half-packed boxes.  
  
A pause. Then, his voice, measured and calm: ""I'm filling out the marriage report. Can we set the date for the ninth of next month?""  
  
The ninth. The same day we'd married in my past life.  
  
My gaze flicked to the bags by the door. ""Marriage is a serious thing,"" I said evenly. ""I'll need to ask my family first.""  
  
Silence stretched between us before his footsteps finally faded down the hall.  
  
I exhaled, sinking back against the headboard.  
  
The truth was, with his status, he didn't need my family's approval to file the paperwork. And it wasn't like I had much family left—my parents had died young, and his parents had taken me in because of the betrothal.  
  
To everyone else, I was already one of them. The marriage report was just a formality.",1,1753686429.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

Can this family be saved?","**What to do about Eve?**  To keep it simple I'll just focus on her inappropriate family flirtations and romance.   She is 3rd of 4 siblings, had great childhood.  Happily married.   Living with parents, married brother and 2 nieces - max 8 household.  No Mods.  ok... 

Daddy's Girl: first shock was a flirtation with her father, Leo.  Broke my heart.  Immediately had her father tell her ""let's just be friends"".  When it happened she is happily married with no children.  Setting disabled for attraction outside of relationship - both father and Eve.  Father's marriage satisfied and happy.  Parent couple would get the ""you're so cute together"" messages from other sims.

I moved her parents out of the house.  Anything to change the dynamic and keep it from happening again.  Now she and her husband can get pregnant since there's space in the house.  Trying to pick up and move forward, I think it will be fun for the cousins to grow up together and easier for me to manage all the kids in one household.  

Eve gets pregnant and has twins - boy and girl.  Her husband is a great dad.  She's a good mom.  Then...  
SHE FLIRTS WITH HER BROTHER.

Nooooo!!  I stepped away to get a cup of coffee. Came back to Eve and was like, who is she flirting with?  What, your brother???  Went looking for her brother and he's stuck on a second floor LEDGE.   

Outside the modern house.. no doors around.  I guess he walked thru the wall to get there?  I had to put in a door to get him off the ledge.  (very cool house from gallery called 'modern castle' btw)

* teenage flirting with Grim
* Marco is her Great Grandfather
* Leo is her Father
* Eamon is her Brother
* Marcus - Husband

No jealousy triggered in Marcus in all of this family flirting.  None.  Which I think is crazy.  

But, her brother walked in on her kissing her husband, got jealous, slapped her in front of her husband.  Now brother has the Fear of Being Cheated On from Eve BUT, it affects his relationship with his wife.   Previously he was super satisfied with his wife.

In all my hours of playing I've never seen anything like this.  What to do about Eve?  

Have Husband divorce her and raise the twins alone?   Move her out of the house & abandon?   Kill her off as a bad seed?  What is going on with her algorithm??  I've checked her settings, nothing unusual - full boundaries, jealousy ON.  I think I have 'Taken' set as a turnoff because I do that to reduce cheating when I want to play Happy Family.

What about the guys?  They participated.  Can't be sure who started the romancing but Eve is at the center of this and other dramas.   Ultimately, EA's settings allowed romance between close family members.  So much for Big Happy Family.  ",2,1753686036.0,Sims4,2,1.0,False

Ancient Greeks, as an example, valued virtue (arete) and flourishing (eudaimonia). Now, everyday chic emphasizes curated simplicity, natural materials, and experiences over blatant consumerism, seemingly echoing a desire for a more meaningful existence beyond just acquiring things.

But is it truly a search for eudaimonia, or just a elegant form of conspicuous consumption? A perfectly minimalist apartment, ethically sourced linen clothing, and artisanal coffee can *look* like a path to the good life, but are they genuinely fostering inner peace and virtue? It seems like the modern pursuit of ""the good life,"" as expressed through everyday chic, often focuses on external markers of well-being, rather than the internal development that philosophers like Aristotle emphasized.

what do you guys think? Is everyday chic a genuine attempt to live a more meaningful life, or just another way to chase happiness through aesthetically pleasing possessions and experiences? Does the emphasis on outward appearances undermine the very principles it claims to embody?",1,1753685471.0,EverydayChicLife,0,1.0,False

His name was Andrew. He wasn’t loud like Leo. He didn’t flirt across the room or steal kisses in elevators. Andrew was quiet — almost too quiet — the kind of person you lean toward just to hear what he’s thinking, and still leave guessing.

We met in a queer theory seminar. He wore oversized sweaters even in spring, drank iced coffee like it was medicine, and always sat by the window, sketching with a shaky hand. I liked that about him. The fragility. The mystery.

At first, he felt like a break from chaos — soft lips, soft voice, soft touch. He didn’t chase; he clung. Whispered compliments that sounded more like confessions. Told me he’d never met someone who made him feel safe. And I believed him.

But safety turned sticky.

He’d cry when I left for class. Ask me if I still liked him whenever I didn’t text back within the hour. Once, I came home late from studio, and he was curled up on the floor outside my door, shaking. He said, “I thought you changed your mind.”

And that’s when I realized — I wasn’t dating Andrew. I was managing him.

He made me feel needed, in a way Jackson never did. But it wasn’t real love. It was… obligation wrapped in affection. A quiet panic that disguised itself as intimacy. And the more he leaned in, the more I leaned away.

Sex was gentle, always. He’d ask “Is this okay?” a dozen times before we even started. And I’d nod, even when I didn’t feel anything. Because how do you say no to someone who’s always afraid you’ll leave?

I remember one night, he traced a finger down my chest and whispered, “You don’t look at me like you used to.”

I almost said, “Because I never looked at you the way you think I did.”

But I didn’t. I just kissed his forehead and pretended to sleep.

That week, I added the calming lube to the “Ex Files” kit. Chamomile-infused. Smooth, neutral scent. Meant for people like Andrew — anxious lovers who needed reassurance more than they needed release.

I broke up with him in a text. Cowardly, maybe. But any other way, and he’d cry until I changed my mind.

**And still — still — I thought of Jackson.**

Because even when Jackson said nothing, he never made me feel guilty for breathing. He just was. And I just… loved him.

Even across countries, across bodies, across all this fog —

Jackson remained the only name I couldn’t put in the Ex Files.

1mb8z0x,https://www.reddit.com/r/NPD_Gaslighting/comments/1mb8z0x/the_tale_of_the_free_cafe_marketing_gaslighting/,The Tale of the “Free” Cafe - Marketing + Gaslighting,"In a small town, there was a cozy little cafe called “The Free Spot.” Every day, people passed by the big, colorful sign that proudly proclaimed: “Free Coffee Today!” Excited and curious, they stepped inside.

The baristas smiled warmly and handed out little cups of coffee. “It’s free!” they said cheerfully. But as the customers looked closer, they noticed the catch: the coffee was tiny, the seating was limited, and to get even the smallest treat, you had to sign up for their monthly newsletter, which was full of ads and sales pitches.

Most people didn’t really mind. The word “free” made them feel like something special was happening. They told their friends about the “free coffee,” not mentioning the fine print.

Over time, the word “free” in the town started to lose some of its magic. People subconsciously understood it wasn’t truly free. Deep down, they expected some strings attached. Yet, they still responded to it every time.

This little dance between promise and reality was harmless by design — an “innocent” gaslighting where the truth was bent but never shattered. No one felt outright deceived, just gently nudged into believing they were getting something valuable without cost.

But beneath the surface, this quiet dissonance accumulated. People started to doubt other “free” offers. They grew wary and even a bit cynical. Businesses, on the other hand, kept cycling the pattern, knowing everyone played along—it was just how marketing worked.

In this town, as in many others, the word “free” became both a lure and a lie. Innocent gaslighting, wrapped in marketing smiles, shaping minds one tiny “free” cup at a time.

The story shows how subtle manipulations in marketing can create a reality where the truth is soft-pedaled, yet no one usually calls it out — because it’s so normalized. It’s a reminder to look beneath “free” offers and see what’s really there, even when everything seems “free” on the surface.

https://preview.redd.it/3d86bifs8kff1.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&s=3603fbe54c1a3df9044b9de3989126af25c880a2

  


When marketing and everyday interactions constantly use tactics like “innocent gaslighting”—for example, calling something “free” when it’s really not—it gradually desensitizes people in several important ways:

1. **Erosion of Trust:** When people repeatedly encounter messages that bend the truth, even gently, their natural instinct to trust those messages starts to fade. They become skeptical and start questioning offers, advertisements, and even personal interactions. This skepticism, while sometimes healthy, can cause a general decline in trust toward businesses and even between individuals.
2. **Normalization of Deception:** When misleading tactics become the norm and are widely accepted as “just how business works,” people begin to expect deceit as standard. This expectation lowers the bar for honesty and transparency. Over time, this normalization makes bigger deceptions easier to accept or ignore because everyday small lies have desensitized people to dishonesty.
3. **Cynicism and Disengagement:** Constant exposure to subtle lies can cultivate cynicism—not just in business but in society at large. People may conclude that “everyone lies” and that it’s pointless to look for truth or authenticity. This can lead to disengagement, where people stop paying attention or stop caring about ethical issues, simply assuming that deception is inevitable.
4. **Poor Decision-Making:** When distrust is widespread, people may struggle to discern credible information from misleading claims. This confusion can lead to poor choices, missed opportunities, or even withdrawal from participation in markets or civic life due to a lack of confidence in the information available.
5. **Social Implications:** On a broader scale, when distrust permeates society, it can weaken social bonds. Relationships, communities, and institutions that rely on mutual trust may fray. The pervasive sense that “lying is just how it goes” undermines collaboration and increases conflict.

In summary, innocent gaslighting in marketing may seem like harmless manipulation, but its cumulative effect is to desensitize people to lying and erode the essential trust that holds personal relationships, businesses, and societies together. It’s a subtle but serious challenge—one that encourages mindfulness about how words like “free” and other promises are used and received.",1,1753684639.0,NPD_Gaslighting,0,1.0,False
1mb8ynz,https://www.reddit.com/r/SCT/comments/1mb8ynz/i_cured_my_sctcds_my_experience/,I cured my SCT/CDS - My experience,"**Personal Background:** I am 22M with ADHD, OCD and what i believed was SCT/CDS till now. I had a pretty traumatic childhood and was bullied in school from the age of 6 till 18, and had a severely tragic relationship fallout that resulted in me losing all my social life. Sophomore year of college, i crashed out and had to get SSRIs just to pass my classes. After 4 months of SSRIs, i started atomoxetine 40 mg twice a day which helped a lot with ADHD and 1 year later i am still on it. 

  
**SCT/CDS personal experience:** Here are the symptoms that I experienced with what i thought was SCT/CDS:

Slow processing, detachment from emotions, brain not registering when feeling texture (keyboard keys, surfaces etc.), monotone voice, perverse sexual urges, detached from surroundings not being able to process details like how chubby or slim someone is, couldn't process my own face in the mirror. Couldn't comprehend numbers and their inherent meaning (adding random 2 digit numbers as a test exercise - significant difference in speed before and after the ""cure""), couldnt process speech very fast and therefore had delayed responses while in conversations. Coffee used to trigger these symptoms even on atomoxetine so I had to avoid caffeine.

**The cure/what i discovered -** Dr Russell Barkley talked about the possibility of CDS/SCT onset occurring due to trauma which was exactly the case here. I realised that i might be struggling with C-PTSD because of the bad relationships. **A lot of people here have talked about DBT/other therapies not helping and from my personal experience, its because as long as you are detached from your emotions, you can't process them, which is something that i struggled with as well which is why therapy didnt work for me either.**  


From my experience, it is highly likely that your brain is enabling CDS/SCT symptoms because its protecting you from something that it thinks is a threat because of past experiences. What i did to resolve this was figure out the source of my anxiety and realise that my brain is responding to a situation that doesnt exist anymore. 

**Very Important:** try your best to get out of the dissociated state that your brain is putting itself in by grounding yourself, use NRIs if possible as they are the best for resolving anxiety, personally speaking. Once you are grounded, start therapy on yourself. 

This worked for me and now i can process my surroundings, conversations etc.,  feel emotions and touch, talk properly in a non - monotone manner and can behave like any other person. 

  
**Also very important: MANAGE YOUR OCD :**  understand  how it works, how it gets triggered and how to resolve it so as to keep it under check.

She initially told me one availability for the week from which I chose Thursday, then she changed it and she proposed the one day of the week I was unavailable (Wednesday  I had already said middle of the week was harder).  I countered with Friday, she said she had all kinds of whatever going on.  

I was annoyed by this point she can't find 30 minutes in an entire week and by the change in her availability she told me just the day before. 

I decided instead of being overly accomodating like I usually am, I got to brass tacks - ""ok, forgive me for being blunt but can I ask you a question?  Do you have the time and energy to date?  Because I am wanting to build a connection and have the time to invest.""

She replied with a pretty legnthy monologue about how she had been single and dating for 8 years, was ready to date, but made it clear that in the early stages she doesn't reserve much time for dates and would build up to more time and attention. She made a lot of comments about *""if""* she ever finds a person for that and comments about her many obligations.

My impression was that her process sounded like it would take months before I graduated to being worthy of even being invited over for dinner.  I got the feeling if she can't make 30 minutes in a week for me now, she'll never be there for me later.

My response was, ""I sense that availability in both a logistical and emotional sense may be a concern here.""  

I then said I would still like to have a date but it would be up to her to suggest a time for the following week.  

She unmatched.

1mb8vja,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1mb8vja/am_i_being_unreasonable_for_asking_my_boyfriend/,Am I being unreasonable for asking my boyfriend to pay for my nails?,"My boyfriend (19M) and I (18F) have been together for three years. He took a gap year to work full-time while I was still in school working only 2 days a week, so he has a lot more saved than I do.

During the school year, we had an agreement: I’d drive to see him on weekdays, he’d drive on weekends. It ended up with me spending most of my money on gas while he saved. I’d also sometimes buy him lunch when visiting him on his breaks. He would pay for our dates once a month, nothing extravagant.

This summer we planned two trips:
A road trip to a bigger city (he’s covering gas and a couple small things like zoo tickets since that was his idea).
A Disney trip with his family (they’re covering his costs).

I’ve been saving since the start of the year and have saved about $3000 to cover both trips for spending money and the necessities. I had no fun money this year since everything else I made went towards gas and food. 

One thing I’ve started to notice is when he does buy me things, they’re usually things he also enjoys or benefits him in some way, like video games so I can play with him, small collectibles from shows he loves or panties and bras. For example, today we were in a game store and he offered to buy me a $30 anime figurine from a series we watched together. I said sure because it was a sweet gesture, but honestly, I wouldn’t have bought it for myself and I told him that I didn’t want it that bad but it was up to him. Meanwhile, things I actually enjoy like cosmetics and self care, he never offers to help with, even occasionally. (I only do my nails maybe once a month if I can handle the up keep, however, it’d be a one time thing for him this year.)

We were out shopping today for the road trip as I briefly mentioned before. I got my eyebrows done and bought some small things with tip money from work. I mentioned wanting to get my nails done (about $50) because it makes me feel put together, and I haven’t had them done in months other than for my graduation, which he mentioned was a good idea. I asked him (lightheartedly, hugging him) if he’d be willing to cover them this once since money is tight, it wasn’t anything serious just an innocent question.

He immediately said no. When I asked why, he paused and said, “No, I’m not paying for your nails. Don’t ask again.” His tone was cold, which honestly hurt and put a lump in my throat. He later added, “I’m already paying for gas and other stuff, so pay for them yourself.”

I didn’t argue, but I went quiet. He noticed and asked why I was distant, but I didn’t want any arguments so I said everything was okay. Shortly after he acted completely normal like nothing happened, while I’m still sitting with this feeling.

To be clear, I never expect him to pay for everything. I rarely ask him for things, if I do it’s small, like a 2 dollar coffee. I just thought maybe he’d want to treat me, especially since it’s something that would make me feel good for our trip. 

Am I being unreasonable for being upset despite masking how I feel?

TL;DR: My boyfriend (19M) and I (18F) have been together 3 years. I’ve spent most of my money on gas visiting him and saving for two upcoming trips, while he’s saved a lot more. When he buys me things, it’s usually stuff he also likes (video games, anime merch, lingerie), never things I personally want. I lightheartedly asked if he’d cover my nails ($50) for our trip since money is tight, and he coldly said no and told me not to ask again. I’m not upset about the “no” itself, but I feel hurt by how dismissive he was. Am I being unreasonable?",0,1753684263.0,relationships,42,0.27,False

Why do they have a god complex and bad attitude? 

Zealously enforcing poorly planned and minor/inconsequential 'regulations' or simply making up the rules as they go along. Verbally shouting and harassing people (I've seen physical before too) for trivial shit. The tiny bit of 'power' or authority they have has totally gone to their heads.  

And it seems like along with their usual bullying targets of young kids and Grab drivers, foreigners (and especially foreign women) are the trophy prizes. I (male) been routinely and arbitrarily harassed by them for all kinds of reasons. I've been told off like a naughty kid for eating a chocolate bar on a public bench, been scolded for not wearing a shirt while sunbathing at a deserted poolside (wtf). At the same poolside I've been scolded for drinking a can of Pepsi (despite absolutely nothing being stated in the rules about it and locals bringing everything from plastic bags of coffee to bowls of pho). My female friend had it worse, she was scolded for moving a sunbed 90 degrees to the right, meanwhile local kids were climbing on the trees (with signs that specifically say no climbing) and splashing everyone without a peep from the staff. 

At the (non-AC'd) gym in my apartment building, groups of local men will routinely train shirtless and barefoot without a peep but the moment I take my vest off, the security are onto me like flies to turd within less than 2 minutes. Other foreign friends in my apartment complex have also complained of being singled out.

Don't even get me started on the dollar-store SWAT at my old place in Masteri.

It is less busy, the cases were more straightforward and less complicated. I'm not bored, but I feel lonely... :(

3. Travellers became my friends, because they know how it feels like working somewhere else. But most of them leave after a contract, one and done.
