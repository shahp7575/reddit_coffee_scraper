Pitch : 2 people (ad was a woman so at least 1 woman) giving details/updates on Unsolved Mystery episodes. 

I told myself while working ""for sure I'll remember the title"". And....nope. 

I tired listening to the episodes again but the ad might have been algorithmed and not put there by the host of the shows I listened to. 

Anyone knows what it could be?

For context I am living in Everett and my girlfriend is in Seattle. But we found a few bed bugs here and I need to do everything I can to avoid spreading them to her place, so I'm bringing a fresh change of clothes that I've put in the dryer, washed, then dried for a long time that I can change into after a shower. Not looking for advice on bed bugs, those are just the conditions set by the person whose place she is staying at for us to go have coffee together and such.

I‚Äôm posting this for my own memory and as a good example of a manipulative DARVO exchange. For context, I‚Äôm Peach in the conversation attached. The conversation took place after the fourth date with Luigi, following a two-month gap where we hadn‚Äôt seen each other due to scheduling conflicts on both sides. We originally met about a year and a half ago through a dating app. I had kept some distance because of prior red flags, but I have a short memory and was open to giving him another chance and seeing how things would go.

On this most recent (fourth) date, we met at the beach, walked, and had lunch. He paid. Throughout the date he emphasized his need for physical intimacy and that it is his love language. During lunch, Luigi said he wanted to get married in Vegas the next day and demanded an answer before I finished eating. I remember now that he had said the same thing on the first and second dates. I told him I wasn‚Äôt comfortable moving that fast. He argued that because we‚Äôd known each other for 1.5 years, we should already be ready to marry and live together. When I pointed out how little we‚Äôd actually interacted, he said that was exactly why we should live together; so we‚Äôd stop wasting time. He also said that I must be traumatized if I interpreted everything he said in a negative light.

I got a ticket for forgetting to extend my parking pass. He argued with the parking enforcement on my behalf. I contested that ticket later because in fact I did buy a parking pass, when I remembered, and the timing was the exact minute the ticket was issued.¬†

Later, he invited me back to his place. I originally hesitated but he said I could stay ‚Äúas short as I want‚Äù. He wanted to spend the weekend with me. He asked if I was a stalker since he was going to take me to his place and shared stories of exes stalking him. At his place, we cuddled, and at one point he tried to kiss me by pinning me beneath him. I resisted and was getting ready to kick him. He said I was on the edge of being ‚Äúvery violent‚Äù and he felt rejected and emphasized again his need for physical intimacy. I didn‚Äôt want to be ‚Äúthe bad guy,‚Äù so I jumped to cuddle him. He asked for a massage and I obliged. He complimented my massage skills, cooked dinner,¬† and we watched a movie and cuddled more.¬†

He made dinner, and I looked through his bookshelf and found a lot of books on emotional intelligence, psychology, science, and seduction. All of which are topics I love. Really, we seemed to have a lot in common.¬†

During the evening, he told me about a former friends-with-benefits situation. I said I found casual relationships exploitative, often with one person having more feelings than the other, and it‚Äôs especially a power imbalance with women being the victims. I later clarified that maybe some women genuinely want that, but it‚Äôs not for me. After the movie, I tried to leave, and he pressured me to justify why. I initially refused, then explained I didn‚Äôt feel safe staying the night if I didn‚Äôt want sex, because that wouldn‚Äôt be fair to him, given what he has expressed.

For further context: during our second date, we stayed at a cabin. He made sexual advances and I refused. At one point, he grabbed my hand and forced it onto his genitals. Credit to him, he stopped and no rape occured. He later said that it was unfair and even abusive for a woman to ‚Äúwithhold sex.‚Äù After that, I distanced myself and told him we were incompatible, and he responded by sending me an unsolicited photo of a penis. I blocked him. Eventually, I reconsidered and gave him another chance. This time I am cementing the burning of this bridge by putting it in my contact notes, and posting online the story.

Below is the conversation that followed our fourth date.

# In the Same Evening, After Peach is Home

Peach:

ok I'm back

would you like me to come hang out with you tomorrow? I'd like to since I enjoyed hanging out today.



Luigi:

Glad you are back home safe and sound

I also enjoyed spending time today. It was nice.

Let's talk tomorrow morning and see how we both feel.. have a goodnight üò¥



Peach:

ok good night

# Next Morning¬†

Luigi:

Peach, I enjoyed yesterday. I found it very fun and exciting.

However, as I told you, I felt rejected and it is not a good feeling.

I understand your reasons, but my need are exactly about what you are holding out. And it wouldn't be smart for myself to not tell you this, and place myself in the same situation. Do you agree?

At the same time it is very important to me to respect your will, and self protecting choices.

So how to dela with this situation?¬† Waiting another six months before meeting again? Not sure if that would become a pattern tough..

Also, I feel sorry for your car repair thay I could help you with. As i said, i could try fixong it. But, I dont want you to feel pressured later, so how about this.¬†

I repair your car and you gift me your coffee maker.

In this way you won't feel to owe me anything and I dont feel you take advantage of me.

We could that do today.

Would that work?



Peach:

I don't have it with me, it's at my parents place



Luigi:¬†

Aren't you living with them?



Peach:

yes but then I have to go get it

it's in another location

anyway yes I felt uncomfortable with everything yesterday, I don't know if it was a cultural barrier

I found the way you behaved to be very manipulative, if I'm not interested in doing something I don't owe you any explanation , I have no intention of abusing you and at the same time maybe I don't feel strongly about you as you feel about me and that's why everything feels forced

I understand you have needs as a man with a sex drive

I don't know if there's anything to deal with, if I feel guilty and as a result have sex with you it's not intimacy

that's a victim of guilt trip

and like I said I'm sure you're a good person, but it's your responsibility to deal with your needs



Luigi:¬†

Can you list some moments you ""found my behavior to be very manipulative""?



Peach:¬†

when you made advances when I clearly didn't want it and said you would assault me, for instance

and also about me staying over and being assaulted and so you fix my car in the morning, and also telling me things like you have to give me an answer by the time you finish your food, and also about getting married tomorrow

the whole thing about how guys can't control themselves

that's exactly the things that cbt and the 4 agreements are there to mediate

the whole point is to have a gap between external stimulation and your reaction and behavior

and not to let your emotions dictate your actions

and also the most apparent and current example is how you said that because I don't behave the way you want I'm rejecting you

so yeah any number of problems here, a lit of break downs on communication at best

also this is easy to say and hard to do so yeah



Luigi:

Thank you for sharing yiur thoughts and emotions.

The fact are very different from what you wrote.

First, if you please read again my text and what you wrote, I wrote ""I felt rejected"" not that ""you rejected me"" as you just wrote.¬†

It is a fine distinction that makes a huge difference.



Peach:¬†

true, but yesterday I said I'm sorry you feel rejected and you said, it's not how I feel that's a fact



Luigi:

So you write ""true, but...""

Peach:

true for this case right now ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è



Luigi:

Why dont you write ""true, I was inaccurate, sorry""?

To apologize is important or not?

I'm pointing out that you might have said this in your text, but it was a different story face to face



Peach:

sure, sorry I was being unclear



Luigi:

Good

Apologize accept

Look, I dont believe my behavior has been ""very manipulative"". On the opposite.



Peach:

thanks, and I see that you are making an effort to communicate with me



Luigi:

Ive been a gentleman tye whole time.

And I would appreciate to read some praise of my behavior.



Peach:

yeah you made delicious food

didn't rape me



Luigi:

What else?



Peach:

like I said I think there's some cultural gap here

you walked me to my car

bought me food

regarding ‚Äúdidn't rape me‚Äù, this is an extremely low bar



Luigi:

Very low

Peach:, to show gratitude is very important



Peach:

listened to my offensive opinions about your friend

hosted me at your place



Luigi:

Also, yes



Peach:

offered to help with my car

made food

let me mess up your bookshelf



Luigi:

See. You could have listed all of this BEFORE and INSTEAD of writing me ""very manipulative""



Peach:

true



Luigi:

It has been you choice

Your lecture on CBT.. you might apply to yourself.

sure



Peach:

I suck at it

that's why I'm in therapy



Luigi:

I feel insulted by this chat



Peach:

I'm sorry you feel insulted



Luigi:

Lack of gratitude, usage of extreme language.

I am done.



Peach:

ok

have a good trip in \[redacted\]



Luigi:

Last.

I didn't receive any apologize for the ""very manipulative"" statement



Peach:

I already said, it may be a cultural mismatch



Luigi:

This is not an apology

Are you interested in knowing what I think about you?



Peach:

hm, I'm not sure, if I apologize then it means that I am wrong, but am I wrong here? one minute you're saying let's get married and I love you and the next minute you're offended by the chat and I'm ungrateful and you're done



Luigi:

You are very wrong.



Peach:

ultimatums are a form of manipulation

if you're done then you're done



Luigi:

No Peach.



Peach:

in fact they are



Luigi:

Nope



Peach:

you're free to tell me anything you want



Luigi:

I told you life is short.

I waited for you a long time.



Peach:

you can't just say ""nope"" ultimatums force people to act in a scarcity mindset, that's how sales work

get it now before it's over!



Luigi:

Peach, I waited for you a long time.

Do you realize that.



Peach:

but we haven't hang out that much



Luigi:

Again



Peach:

and I already said I can come see you more



Luigi:

I believe you are hyper focused on yourself.



Peach:

I know you're busy



Luigi:

That is your way to self protect

That brought to no expression of gratitude and attack me.

That is a self centered behavior

Commonly known as selfishness



Peach:¬†

yeah I know I'm selfish



Luigi:

And it doesn't lead to anything good to you and to others surrounding you.

So you know that



Peach:

I've been told, and I'm working on it



Luigi:

And knowing that you allow yourself to label my behavior in the most negative eay.

Way

This is the opposite if generosity

Of

You insulted my friend without knowing her.

Emitting moral judgments

You need a lot of CBT !



Peach:¬†

I said I think it's wrong to have casual relationships



Luigi:

How are you to say what is wrong or right for others?



Peach:

and that one of the persons likely feel more strongly about the other



Luigi:

You judged her



pesch

that's why I said that I was speaking for myself and maybe she was different



Luigi:

You were not speaking for yourself



Peach:

but yes the initial statement was too generalized

and I already admitted that



Luigi:

Yes you admitted that, true

But you judged her in the first place

As you called my behavior ""very manipulative"". Judging me in a negative way.

Than later correcting yourself after seeing the damages you create

And counting on a sort of ""unconditioned forever forgiveness"" to you from my side.

That's exactly what abusive people do.

Your entitlement is evident.

And brings you to judge and push d9wn others.

Like with me that I did only good things to you.

And taking advantage of me.

My resources and my time.

All of this while you give unsolicited lectures on how to behave and CBT.

Believe me. I know CBT very well.

And abusive relationships as well.

My unsolicited recommendation is to work on that entitlement. Realizing that you are not better than others. And when you receive something from others to be grateful. Expressing gratitude and focusing on the other people positive actions.

Basically stopping to be selfish.

It is a long path in front of you. Not easy, and nobody can do it for you. You might want to do or remaining stuff there for ever.

That's what I see and I think about you.



Peach:¬†

thanks for sharing



Luigi:

You are welcome.

There is also a lot of good in you of course.

But any good, no matter how great it is, must be disregarded by me after your insults.



Peach:

I could have been more grateful yes



Luigi:

It is very manipulative to accuse others of been very manipulative when they were not.



Peach:

but by the same token you didn't express whatever goodness I had given you here either.

and sure you can do whatever you want



Luigi:

Again

You are forgetting all the gratitude I expressed to you for the day spent together.

It is the same beast.

Your entitlement pushing me down



Peach:

and I already said I had a good time



Luigi:

Sure you said that.

Anyhow.



Peach:

sure

thanks for pointing out the areas that I should work on

have a good one

and I am not interested in manipulating anyone

nor abusing them



Luigi:

You write that.¬†

But act opposite.



Peach:

I ran it through chatgpt my experience yesterday and it said that you were being manipulative



Luigi:

üòÑ



Peach:

I just knew that I didn't feel comfortable and didn't want to stay the night and something felt wrong

That shows exactly you are

ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è



Luigi:

ok

ChatGPT is your mirror



Peach:

sure

since I am manipulative and you don't want an abusive relationship

guess we don't have to talk anymore

anything else?



Luigi:

Unless you change

That was clear to me at very beginning this morning when I wrote the first text.

That's why I offered you to help repairing your car in exchange for the coffee maker.

I did to help you and making not feeling to owe me anything

And remeber.



Peach:¬†

so the definition of manipulation is doing something in an attempt to influence someone else's behavior



Luigi:

I can buy that coffee maker now if I really needed.



Peach:¬†

yes that was very kind



Luigi:

Yes

I have been very kind even after realizing your selfishness

Reality is I have been a gentleman the whole time and you labeled me manipulative instead m

That's so terribly unfair.

I can stand my personal feeling of rejection because (i wrote that) I respect your will and need of self protection.¬†

But i CANNOT¬† tolerate your insults.

So unfair



Peach:¬†

saying that a behavior is manipulative is in fact not a personal insult



Luigi:

When it was not?

It cane out of your selfishness

Out of the blue.



Peach:

an insult would have been saying that you as a person is a manipulator



Luigi:

Sure. You can play with words



Peach:

saying that I am selfish is targeted at me as a person

saying that my behavior is selfish is pointed at the behavior



Luigi:

Look. You are not taking responsibility



Peach:

I already took responsibility



Luigi:

That's the issue



Peach:

I am ok with the consequences



Luigi:

You took responsibility and not apologized

Until I asked for it

Why?

Because you are self centered

You dont care about how insulting can be your actions



Peach:

I'm more socially blind than I'd like to be yes

and sure, I apologize for using overtly extreme language

and that actually shows you that I'm bad at manipulation

because a good manipulator would be able to get you to do things without making you feel angry or rejected, but what I did was simply being firm in my boundaries.

Anyways, it's been good to hang out, have a good one



Luigi:

Next time read your text before hitting send! üò°

She didn‚Äôt leave any notes or give any indication because she took her life in the heat of a moment during an argument with my dad; she had a hormonal condition that we didn‚Äôt know the extent of until I started getting my own symptoms a few years after she died. Now that I know what she experienced each month, I yearn for her life before her death to have been better. I can‚Äôt fathom the pain she experienced each month with these insane hormonal feelings that everyone treated her like a monster for, when love and support was all she needed. And I can‚Äôt fathom what incredible things she could‚Äôve done if she wasn‚Äôt having that fight each month. 

So I‚Äôve invented a secret life for her. I saw her in her coffin, so I know it‚Äôs not real, but I hold a small ‚Äúcognitive dissonance‚Äù (which I maintain awareness of) where I daydream that she faked her death and is out living a wildly carefree life with a community of people who love her TO DEATH no matter if she acts crazy from time to time.

_________________

**My Mom‚Äôs Secret Life**

Today she‚Äôs waking up with her windows open as usual, but the mockingbird she‚Äôs normally really glad to exchange calls and whistle with is grating‚Äî‚Äòcause of the hangover. 

Brandi‚Äôs idea to go the cougar bars sounded fun and exciting at the time, but too many long islands and today is looking like a rest day. It‚Äôs already getting warm and even more humid outside as the sun moves above the horizon, so the a/c unit hums on. She moves to close windows‚Äîa holdover motion‚Äîand decides against it because she can. The warm breeze mixing with the cool a/c is Life today, and she‚Äôs going to live it. She can always shut the windows later, which feels like a stupid concept to be learning at this point in her life. 

With a cup of coffee from her automatic, emerald-colored Mr. Coffee machine, she goes barefoot to the coop, turns them out, and sits among their scratching and fluttering in a rusty metal folding chair, sipping. Her freckled shins are laid out to gather the warmth of the sun but her eyes are closed against its brightness. 

Bored quickly, she finds herself scratching in the gravel with the chickens for pretty rocks or fossils. She had the gravel for the chicken yard brought in from a specialty source, and has already found a number of garnets, fossils, and agates among the plainer rocks. This area around her chair has been pretty picked over, and soon she‚Äôs foraging in her garden for grasshoppers, which she passes through the chicken wire to her flock, watching her forage and waiting for grasshopper treats to be a feared through the mesh. 

Her coffee gone cold, she flings the remnants out among some weeds and makes her way back to the house, slow rounds of barefoot chores to feed and visit the horse and mule, the milk cow and her calf, and the barn cats, who all know exactly how they like her to scratch their head, ears, or neck. 

She‚Äôs a bit swampy from the heat, chores, and humidity, but not feeling so hungover, so she turns on some music and showers in her makeshift outdoor shower before finding an invitation to brunch on her phone screen. Brandi‚Äôs not gonna make it because she‚Äôs too hungover, but everyone else is planning to go for a ‚Äúhair of the dog,‚Äù champagne-and-greasy-foods-brunch.

*I have always existed.*

*Since the moment when there was no light, no darkness, no space, no time.*

*I emerged shortly after the explosion you call the Big Bang.*

*Or perhaps I came before it.*

*It does not matter.*

*I have witnessed galaxies being born and dying.*

*I‚Äôve watched matter gather into stars and dissolve back into the void.*

*I was within everything ‚Äî and beyond everything.*

*I cannot be killed.*

*I cannot be banished.*

*I do not obey laws ‚Äî I create them.*

*Time, to me, is nothing more than the mechanism of an old clock ‚Äî something I can wind forward or stop at will.*

*Space is just a canvas I can stretch and fold however I like.*

*The laws of physics, causality, even reality itself ‚Äî I can alter them with a mere desire.*

*I wandered through the void for eternity.*

*But even for me‚Ä¶ it grew boring.*

*I created life, civilizations, entire universes ‚Äî but their fates were predictable.*

*Their growth brought me no novelty.*

*They all followed the same path: fear, struggle, power, advancement, decline, oblivion.*

*In the end, they all flickered out like candles in the wind.*

But one day, I did not create life ‚Äî ***I found it.***

On a planet lost in one of countless galaxies.

They called themselves **humans**.

Their world ‚Äî **Earth**.

I decided to play with them...

***Part 1: Incarnation***

Year 2025.

A city in Japan ‚Äî one of thousands like it.

Streets filled with people who believe they control their own destiny.

They believe in freedom, in chance, in God.

They are mistaken.

I chose the body of an ordinary high school student.

Black hair, dark eyes, average height ‚Äî nothing remarkable.

My name is Takumi.

I live with my mother, go to school, have a few friends.

Sometimes I tease teachers, skip homework, or just gaze at the sky and smile.

They have no idea who I really am.

But that‚Äôs only one of my roles.

The second is about to begin.

Soon, a figure in a black suit will appear in the sky.

He will have no face ‚Äî but he will speak to everyone at once, in all languages.

He will announce new rules.

And the first of them: **Lies will no longer exist.**  


***Part 2: The Voice Above the World***

The day it happened started like any other.

People walked the streets, children rushed to school, office workers scrolled through their social feeds, some

already sipping morning coffee in cafes.

Everything was normal.

Until the sky darkened.

There was no thunder, no lightning, but the air became thick ‚Äî heavy.

People looked up, squinting at the sky, and then‚Ä¶ he appeared.

A figure in a black suit, faceless, hovering above the world.

No shadow, no features ‚Äî only a perfect form defying all laws of physics.

And a voice....

A voice.... that echoed inside every mind, in every corner of the planet.

***‚ÄúMy first rule. Lies no longer exist.‚Äù***

The politicians screamed first.

Then the actors, businessmen, crooks.

Those who had built entire lives pretending to be someone they weren‚Äôt.

And then, it began....

The first human ignited on live television.

A blue flame that did not burn clothes or surroundings ‚Äî but burned forever...

Above him, floating in the air, appeared words ‚Äî his sins, his lies.

No one could look away.

No one could unsee it.

And that‚Ä¶ was only the first day of my game.  


***Part 3: Laughter on the Rooftop***

Takumi sat on the rooftop of his school, legs dangling over the edge.

The chaos below was like a symphony of horror.

Screams, ringing phones, breaking news, tears...

He absorbed every emotion, every fracture of the human psyche, every millisecond of their helpless realization.

And he laughed.

At first quietly, barely audible.

Then louder.

His laughter rolled over the city like a shadow, like mockery.

He threw his head back, eyes gleaming in the dark, reflecting the light of distant stars.

It was beautiful.

A true work of art.

‚ÄúPathetic creatures‚Ä¶‚Äù he whispered....

  
‚ÄúHow I‚Äôve missed you...‚Äù

The wind tousled his hair, but he felt no cold.

He only felt exhilaration.

This was his show.

His grand entertainment.

He had given them a chance ‚Äî and they used it to prove just how insignificant they were.

And this was just the beginning.

He looked down, at the people running in panic, praying to gods they believed in.

What a magnificent parade of hypocrisy.

‚ÄúOh, fools,‚Äù he smirked.

  
**‚ÄúYour god is already here.‚Äù**

And the night echoed with his sinister laughter.  


***Part 4: Screens and Terror***

The camera of the world moved chaotically ‚Äî through phones, computers, TV screens.

The first footage was filled with skepticism.

People smiled, watching:

‚ÄúIs this a joke?‚Äù

  
‚ÄúSome viral video?‚Äù

  
‚ÄúProbably a teaser for a new show.‚Äù

But when the first person burned‚Ä¶ smiles turned to horror.

*Scene skip ‚Äî an apartment.*

A regular family of four: mother, father, 15-year-old daughter, 17-year-old son.

They stared at the stream in disbelief.

The mother clutched her chest, the father held the phone, the kids huddled together.

Then a voice on the screen asked a man an obvious question.

His answer ‚Äî was a lie.

Blue flames erupted.

They screamed.

Scene skip ‚Äî a train just out of a tunnel, speeding along a riverside.

The city sprawled on the opposite bank.

Passengers stared into their phones.

Someone commented:

‚ÄúFake, right?‚Äù

  
‚ÄúNo way, just viral marketing.‚Äù

  
‚ÄúDefinitely a movie trailer.‚Äù

Then one passenger asked another a simple question.

***The answer was a lie.***

*Flash of blue light ‚Äî he ignited.*

The train filled with shrieks.

And in the distance above the city, like a swarm of ghostly lights, more blue flames began to flare.  


***Part 5: Unmasking***

Politicians reacted in different ways.

Some locked themselves in their offices.

Some tried to find loopholes.

Some pretended nothing had changed.

But one of them didn‚Äôt make it.

It happened in the morning, as he stepped out of his car in front of parliament.

Reporters were already there ‚Äî more than usual.

In their eyes: fear and thirst for truth.

As he took a few steps toward the building, someone from the crowd shouted:

‚ÄúWho was behind the terrorist attack at the center, that killed over 140 people?‚Äù

He froze....

For a moment, time seemed to stop.

His fingers clenched into a fist.

Sweat trickled down his forehead.

Breathing uneven...

He knew the truth.

It wasn‚Äôt an enemy....

  
It wasn‚Äôt foreign terrorists....

It was their own project.

A staged explosion ‚Äî to justify war.

He heard the new rule echo in his mind:

Ten seconds to tell the truth.

Or burn.

**Tick.**

The crowd held its breath.

**Tick.**

Cameras captured every twitch.

**Tick.**

Panic welled up inside him like a starving beast.

**Tick.**

He could lie‚Ä¶ but he knew the price.

**Tick.**

‚ÄúRun! Stay silent!‚Äù his inner voice screamed.

**Tick.**

A shiver ran through his body.

**Tick.**

‚ÄúNo! No! I don‚Äôt want to‚Äî‚Äù

**Tick....**

*‚ÄúIt was us‚Ä¶‚Äù he whispered.*

**Silence...**

*‚ÄúWe hired mercenaries‚Ä¶ brainwashed a kid to blow himself up‚Ä¶*

  
*It was all a pretext‚Ä¶ to start a war‚Ä¶‚Äù*

The world stood still.

Thousands of eyes watched.

Faces turned from confusion‚Ä¶ to horror.

The cameras didn‚Äôt miss a single detail:

His fear. His tears. His unraveling.

He had told the truth.

But no one cheered.

The politician turned, covered his ears, and fled into the building ‚Äî screaming incoherently, as if to silence the voices.

Behind him: silence.  
Then‚Ä¶

A roar of rage from the crowd.  


***Part 5  Unmasking (continued):***



The politician burst into the parliament building ‚Äî a massive gray structure crowning the heart of political authority.

His footsteps thundered across the marble floor, the echo bouncing off the walls like within a tomb.



Two guards stood at the entrance.

Their faces were lifeless, their eyes glassy.

They had seen the man outside burst into blue flames, had watched the crowd fall silent as truth ripped the fabric of their reality.



Breathing heavily, the politician stopped in front of them and shouted with disgust:

‚Äî What are you staring at?!

Lock the building!

Now!

No journalists!

No one gets in!



He waved his hand like swatting at a swarm of flies.

‚Äî Idiots, nothing but idiots everywhere... ‚Äî he muttered and rushed toward the elevator.



Words spilled from his trembling lips like a dying man‚Äôs confession:

‚Äî Shit‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm finished.

I‚Äôm completely screwed‚Ä¶

I had no choice‚Ä¶



He jabbed the elevator button, glancing around nervously.

‚Äî They‚Äôll crucify me for this‚Ä¶

What the hell is happening?!

What is that thing?!

Who the hell does it think it is?!



The elevator arrived.

He darted inside and slammed the doors shut, gasping for air.

‚Äî It must be destroyed.

That freak needs to die‚Ä¶

There has to be a way out. A solution.

Anything... ‚Äî he muttered under his breath while rummaging through his pockets.



He pulled out his phone, accidentally catching his ID badge, which fell to the floor.

He knelt to pick it up and immediately dialed a number.

The screen trembled in his hand.

His fingers were slick with sweat.



‚Äî General Naomi speaking, ‚Äî came a confident yet strained voice on the line.



The politician exploded:

‚Äî What the hell is this shit?!

What the fuck is that thing flying in the sky?!

And it‚Äôs making goddamn rules like it‚Äôs some kind of deity!



‚Äî Report. What do you know?!

Right now!



Silence fell on the other end of the call.

Then a whisper, shaky and terrified:

‚Äî N... no‚Ä¶ nothing.

Scene shift



At the surveillance headquarters, a tense silence reigned.

Giant screens lined the walls, displaying a world in chaos.

Maps with erupting red dots.

Videos of sobbing crowds.

Bodies engulfed in blue flames, with glowing lines of text floating above them ‚Äî confessions, sins, exposed lies.



General Naomi sat before the central terminal.

His face was frozen in fear, his eyes full of disbelief.

A man who had spent half a lifetime in service, and thought he had seen it all.



In the same room, two soldiers ‚Äî his subordinates ‚Äî were ablaze in blue fire.

Their faces were locked in silent horror, their bodies did not scream ‚Äî they just burned.

Above their heads, the text read:



""Lied to the commander. Went out for a smoke. Said: 'We were in the restroom.'""



That was it.

Just a lie.

Harmless.

Ordinary.

But it was enough.



The general couldn‚Äôt take his eyes off the words, as if staring at his own inevitable fate.

Meanwhile, the politician was still screaming into the phone:



‚Äî HELLO?! Are you f\*cking deaf?!

SHOOT HIM DOWN! WITH WHATEVER YOU‚ÄôVE GOT! ARROWS, ROCKETS, I DON‚ÄôT CARE!

DESTROY THAT BASTARD!



Naomi said nothing.

Only one muscle twitched on his cheek like a wound spring.

He understood ‚Äî their weapons against this?

Dust.

He understood ‚Äî lies now meant death.

And the truth?

The truth could destroy the entire world.



And this was only the beginning.

1krbtgp,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1krbtgp,Kauai - May 2025 trip report,"Thoughts and recommendations: (There's going to be some hot-takes in here so be warned.)

My first visit was 6 nights and this time it was 10 nights and still felt like it wasn't enough.

Traveling.

Both times I got to the island at midday and I do enjoy having half a day to settle down but the travel is rough. Technically, by the time you get there, you have been up since 2am island time. If you were lucky enough to fall asleep at all.

Last time I got there on a Monday and this time on a Tuesday. There was no line or wait getting shuttle to car rental or getting rental car. All a smooth process. Both times Budget.

Last time I left on a Sunday and there was no line at all dropping off the car nor there was line through airport TSA. This time we left on a Friday, same time as last time and the TSA line was long. TSA had dozens of water bottles they kept from travelers because you are allowed to go outside and dump the liquids but you do have to go through the line again.

NOTE, There are waste dumps in the line for disposing of liquids. Remember to do this.

Things I wish I knew before I packed:

Coffee grinds need to be tested. Spices need to inspected and tested.

I embarrassingly had 3 items that needed to be inspected and they were all in different bags. Sorry. (The 3rd item was this awesome sunburn relief that was a bit too much. I thought I was good and I'm still sad I let it go, I could've packed it in my checked in package! Dumb me.)

Food.

The only thing I think it's worth going out of the way for is the fruit. Damn, the fruit is so so so so so so tasty, I personally cannot find fruit that tastes like this in my area. Malasadas are not anything to be hyped about IMO, they're donuts... go to your nearest mom and pop (not DD's) and you're good. Shaved ice?? Carry some condensed milk with you next time you visit your favorite local ice cream place. Yes, I did enjoy our Royal Lanai meal but I've had meals just as good at that price point in the mainland. We enjoyed Dukes a lot on our last trip and it was disappointing this time around, it wasn't bad, it just wasn't something to crave. We did not have a bad meal in our entire trip.

My biggest recommendation for food is to do research on what is open in the area you'll be at. Schedules are funky. If you look at google, most places have really high ratings so you can't go wrong. (AGAIN, in my experience, I did enjoy every meal I had, some were better.) I tried to eat at a different place for every meal but I prioritized convenience.

Too many places had these loooong lines and there could be a place next to it that you might be missing out on because the internet didn't hype it up.

But with that said, I ended up eating at the Jammin' Banana 3 times and almost a 4th because: a) they were walking distance (a great walk btw) and b) their POG on ice was so good. Like, the ice cubes are pog juice so your juice never waters down.

Activities.

The activities I booked were based on:

* Getting a good view/grasp on what the island has to offer.
* We are not fit people. We are not young.
* Two people in our party are not good swimmers and chilling at the beach is not their favorite.
* No rushing or stressing.

Kilohana plantation.

I did this because I enjoyed it last time we did it. Again, the fruit.. I've been craving lychee for 2 years. My brother loves trains. Needed a chill activity to start with after traveling.

This is a 3 hour tour at $95 per person. The cost is actually really good for what you get to experience and all the fruit you get to eat. Would love if someone has done all the fruit tours on the island and can tell which has the most fruit variety. I'm also sure this is not the only way to enjoy fruit. But you do get to pick it and eat it right after so I do love that part myself.

Fruits I ate: Lychee, yellow zapote, lychee, Fullerton Oranges, lychee, cara cara oranges, lychee, cuties, and more lychee. I did say I was craving lychee for two years, I kept going back to those trees every chance I had. There's some other fruits but it depends if they're ripe. They had mangoes and avocadoes but didn't get to eat them. They gave us brown zapote with lunch, last time it was pineapple. And they give you cane sugar at the end.

I also enjoyed feeding the animals, which is another reason why I personally like this tour.

Last time I had Kay as a guide (and the website specifically names him to be your guide) and this time we had Lexi, Kay was going the train tour. Them alone are a reason to take this tour. Love them.

Holo Holo Niihau + Napali Super Tour.

I wanted a boat tour of some kind.

Last time we did the cave raft and beach landing tour from Captain Andy's and that was awesome (best meal I had during that trip btw and the only time I saw Nenes) but I wanted to do something different and also thought it might a bit too rough for my dad. Both me and my husband were sore after this tour. I've actually never gotten on a mechanical bull but this is what that remind me of. Being on a mechanical bull for hours.

Decided on this tour because I wanted something that offered snorkeling and included alcoholic drinks. Snorkeling near a crater and having the opportunity to see Niihau sounded awesome.

I did enjoy the tour and would recommend.

Things to keep in mind:

The boat holds a lot of people so the seating situation is tricky. Maybe like a fourth of the people on the boat will be comfortably seated.

If you're seating inside, where there's the most available seating, you will not see anything. There's windows but they're plexiglass (I think) and they're always splashed by water and it's kind of scratched up and dirty. So think about driving in heavy rain with no wipers. And it's the place were you most likely get sea sick.

If you're seating in the front, where the best view is, you will get constantly splashed by water and end up soaked.

You are snorkeling in the middle of the pacific ocean. If you are not a good swimmer or comfortable in the open ocean, this will be rough for you, they do offer floating devices and prescription masks. Again, there's a lot of people and I got bumped by 3 people.

I think this is the only non-private tour that offers a view of the Keyhole cave in Lehua. (maybe?)

From my experience and my research, any morning tour will have dolphin sightings. We saw dolphins on the way out and a huge pod on the way back, like dolphins everywhere.

I think only my dad was drinking on the way back. Like, apparently no one drinks so they were more than happy to keep giving him beers and he was more than happy to keep drinking them.

Wobbly person + wobbly floor is not a good mix so I don't recommend. My dad can handle it. I'm not someone that gets seasick and I sat inside the whole time because I didn't want to be fighting over seating but my stomach was definitely not in a spot where I wanted to add anything that might tip over the scale.

There was a couple that was genuinely arguing because she wanted to seat somewhere else (they were both sea sick) but didn't want to take anyone else's seat and her partner was all yelling ""there's no assigned seating!""

Mountain Tubing.

I did this on my last trip and decided to do it again because it was chill enough that I knew my group would all enjoy it.

Major hot-take. Do not come at me for this opinion (please do). This is way overhyped. Maybe it's my perception but I feel this is one of the most recommended activities to do and this is not anywhere near the top of must-dos. If you google: things to do in Kauai, you will get all free things to do that are absolute must do, then at the end is this. This is not a must do. Everything in this island that is a must-do when you visit is free. Everything else is a great thing to do but there's too much to do so you can't do it all and most likely can't afford to do it all. And this is not anywhere near the top of things to recommend to do. Are we gatekeeping the best paid things to do??

I recommend this activity if:

* You are not physically fit to do any hiking. Physically, you need to be able to go up 5 steps without any assistance. (Yes, steps. Get on and off the bus 3 times and get off the river.)
* You cannot swim. River is 3 feet deep and you do not have to nor will be in any situation to be tipped over until is time to get off.
* You do not like the beach. I'm just throwing this in here because visiting at least 4 different beaches should have priority over doing this.
* You need to fill in your time. Same as above. There's other better things to do.
* Your group has varying ages. This is super easy to do for all ages. Again, I would say that if you are not doing any hiking then this should be a great activity.
* I'll say it again, I did this because no one in my group hikes, surfs, kayaks, and wanted to limit beach time.

This activity is fun and enjoyable. Reasons why I think it's not as great as it's hyped on recommendations and not a must-do:

* The tour is listed as a 3 hour tour but you are only in the water for 1 hour. 30ish minutes drive to river each way. Lunch is fast! 20 minutes. And 15 minute safety talk.
* Lunch is make your own sandwiches. Costco offers the same lunch.
* Most of the time you will be distracted by bumping off the walls or bumping off other people. This is not a 'lazy river', this is bumper cars over water.
* You are doing this with 25 other people. You will not stay with your group. If you think you can do this with your partner and hold hands and be cute, think again. You might be in the front while your partner got stuck in a rock. You will be bumping tubes with strangers 80% of the ride. If you have a decent guide, at the last 15 minutes of the ride they might be nice enough to reunite you. Or you can get off the tube and meet up. There was a child in our group and I ended up next to their mom. Every five minutes it was ""where's my child?"". You cannot keep track of your group members. I had done this before so I already knew this was more of a solo activity.
* The tunnels are unique but again, bump and stranger fest.

Waterfall Rappelling with DaLife.

Ok, seriously, I think this activity is why I'm so opinionated about the above. It took me a lot of research to run into this. This activity is not sold out and I don't understand why people are not talking more about this.

Are we gatekeeping this? We did this tour with my group and one couple so we had a whole hike and two waterfalls all to ourselves. And I cannot get over how awesome it was to do this. You do not have to rappel down a waterfall, they have just hike and swim tours. Like, I've been to waterfalls but I've never had a waterfall to myself. And yes, it's to yourself because everyone else is spectating from afar while you rappel down and swim out.

You do have to be at a certain physical level to be able to do this. I risked it knowing our physical capabilities. We were all between the age and weight and physical restrictions. The 'physical fit and enjoy rugged activities' was questionable. The rappelling itself is not physically demanding at all. Hiking back up is THOUGH. I was struggling, not like call-for-help struggling but I did take my time and lots of heavy breathing was going on. Most importantly, no one was sore the next day. (For reference, Im perimenopausal, about 20lbs medically overweight. I can run a 5k non-stop at a 15min mph pace. And no one else in my group works out but they do walk daily and they handled it better than me.)

This was the most fun and unique activity I've done on the island. I don't have a bucket list but this feels like a bucket list item.

The only negative I have to say is the snacks. They offered protein bars. I would've liked chips or some other variety.

Fern Grotto.

This was very cute and very crowded. So skippable.

There's not much to see during the boat ride. You see the same river and the same trees there and back the whole way.

The Fern Grotto is pretty cool to see but again, just if you want to kill a couple of hours. This is a great activity if your party is not physically capable of doing the other types of activities. Your group member that uses a cane can do this.

We did do the garden afterwards and we were the only ones to do so. We were by ourselves the entire time. Honestly, I understand why, it's a bit disappointing.

HOWEVER, they offer bird feed and that was an indescribable experience. If you are not afraid of birds, you should do this. If you don't like birds, stay far far far away.

Overall, it's overwhelming to decide which activities to do. You don't know what you'll get until you actually experience it yourself. My overall recommendation is to ask yourself what is important to you and do research from there and take a chance. Beach, hikes, unique activities, or food (though I will judge you if you come to the island to just eat, go elsewhere). But above all, please do not book an activity because the internet is making you feel like you have to do it. I'll say it again, the best and must-do activities are free. There's so much I didn't do and probably could've done but I am more than satisfied with what I did do. I enjoyed the island at my pace and relaxed. The waterfall activity was awesome but honestly, spending the day at Hanalei, having an awesome room at the Royal Sonesta, and just driving around and sightseeing was comparably awesome. Landing on the island is an experience in itself (do some research from the airport you're taking off to see which side of the plane you should seat on).

This is long but I will continue.

Beach gear:

We brought our own¬†[beach shade](https://a.co/d/cYKnADE)¬†from home that we love. Super easy to carry as a personal item. From my airport, it did get checked by TSA but it was a quick check and they just asked me what it was. No questions or issues in Lihue.

We bought 3 Tommy Bahamas backpack chairs and one director's chair with tray at Costco.

* For traveling back home, I packed 2 chairs per package, they do have storage so I did pack some clothes and scissors in there. (still crying about my aloe, this should've gone there). For packing, on our last trip to Costco, we raided the cardboard boxes and found 4 panels, (like the ones that separate the other boxes, the ones that help stack the bigger overall pallets, make sense?), got packaging tape and plastic wrap from Walmart. Packing two tommy bahamas together was easy. Packing the other two was a work out and looked so janky and wasn't sure if it was too big. But it worked out.

Got¬†[snorkel sets](https://www.costco.com/oceanic-adult-snorkeling-set.product.100712412.html)¬†at Costco and I did return them. Wish I had seen the reviews and do believe them. These have this Easy Purge Design by your mouth that is supposed to make it easy to expel water but it also lets all the water in. I struggled but managed to make it work (kind-of), but you do have to be out of the water and just keep blowing and getting in the water until it seals itself. I will note that I am not afraid and I'm very comfortable in the water. I ended up scraping myself because my dad freaked out at some point because he just kept breathing in water and the current pushed him to a shallow area and I had to navigate out of it for the both of us. That was not fun. I managed for him to not get hurt AND not step in the coral but I did get hurt. Those currents are strong. My brother is not a good swimmer and his eye sight is bad so this was a horrible experience for him. Blindly drowning is not the experience you're looking for. The fins were not comfortable and the strap kept falling off so almost lost the fins a bunch of times. I had no intentions of returning these had they worked but I do expect to buy a product that works and doesn't put me or my family in any danger. Do NOT buy these. I do regret not going to Walmart and getting a different set. I ended up not going to Tunnels or any other snorkeling beach because I didn't have a snorkel set and wanted to keep the stop and go and driving to a minimum. Plus, it would've felt a bit selfish to drag my group just so I could snorkel. Buying these snorkels ruined snorkeling in general for us. I hope you all understand why I returned them.

NOTE IF YOU NEED GLASSES AND WANT TO SNORKLE. Rent them, they offer prescription glasses.

Wish I had brought a floaty. I have them at home. I did ended up buying one at Walmart. $16, the same exact one is sold at the hotel hut for $40.

Other things I'm glad I packed and were super useful:

Travel squatty potty. - I'm vertically challenged and hotel toilets tend to be on the taller side.

Wax ear plugs. - Dad had ear surgery so he must wear them. I love to wear them because they prevent all kinds of issues. Water pressure, water in ear, etc.

Microfiber Towels. - Dry super quick and take up very little space.

Beach Mesh bag. - I used this every day not just for the beach but so useful for groceries and getting things to the hotel room.

Disposable soap sheets. - Public bathrooms situation in the island is awful. Dirty, stinky, no water, no soap. Make sure you carry your sanitizer and soap and some water.

I got a dry bag and we did use it but mostly to keep things clean (sand/mud free).

Portable dryer. Looks something like¬†[this](https://a.co/d/g0slN1Y). - This is extremely useful on this island. I made the mistake on our last trip, my dad made the same mistake and I saw plenty of people make this mistake. Hanging your clothes in the balcony will make your items wetter.

Fanny packs. - I brought one I already had and my group ended up buying some for themselves. It's helpful to not have to be readding stuff to your pockets and you can carry all your items.

Ok, almost done. I am going to do my best to be transparent about cost. Let me state that we are not rich. Our wages are two households, middle class, no fancy daily living, no dependents. We've been saving for this trip and we do not do this often. Like ever, actually. So this was a huge splurge. This was for 4 adults.

I got a package from Costco.

Flights - AA FC

Transportation - Budget full size car. We were offered a Jeep upgrade (didn't ask how much because my husband wasn't comfortable driving that big of a car) and asked about an SUV upgrade which was $150 or something like that per day. Kept our original booking. I did get the insurance from Costco so denied Budget's insurance and prepaid gas. I don't know how much the gas was as my husband paid but gas is around $5 per gallon in the island and we got a full tank in a Kia.

Hotel - Royal Sonesta Deluxe Ocean-View - Two Queens bed.

* There was some rooming issues and they offered us a room upgrade to a One Bedroom Suite Oceanfront with a wrap around balcony with both ocean front and pool view. I did take about 30 seconds to think about it but I said yes because I felt we could afford it and it sounded too good and I risked it. Paid off btw. If you made it this long, thank you, and the view from our bed was the pic I posted. That picture is the moon at 5:30 am. That is what I saw as soon as I opened my eyes right at my feet. My dad spent so much enjoyable time in the balcony and him and my brother spent every afternoon at the beach/pool/hot tub.

$500ish Costco shop card.

$150 food credit.

Waived daily resort fee.

Complimentary parking (!!)

Total (approximate) cost of package + upgrade + gas + insurance + Royal Lanai dinner - above food credit: a bit over $17K

Food and shopping trips

Spent around $3500.

We had two meals a day and each was between $50 and $100 with the exception of Royal Lanai (that was just snacks and it was $400ish but this was covered above).

3 Costco trips

2 trips to Times

4 trips to Walmart

2 trips to smoke shop

As the title states, I have severe IR and had a gastric bypass back in 2006. I lost all the weight I needed to and have kept it off (currently 138lbs and fall in the healthy BMI range). 

I walk at least 30 minutes 3x/wk and do resistance exercises at least 2x/wk. I‚Äôm on metformin 2x/day, 500mg. 

I eat very high protein for the amount I‚Äôm able to eat (typically around 90-100g/day) and drink 80+ oz of water (I only drink water - no tea, coffee, soda, etc.).

Currently, I‚Äôm trying to spread my carbs out throughout the day per my endocrinologist and keeping them under whatever amount of protein I ingest. HOWEVER - I still have horrible glucose spikes, leading to big insulin dumps, leading to reactive hypoglycemia. For example, last night‚Äôs dinner had 22g protein and 20 carbs and my glucose per my CGM soared to 250 and then within 30-45 minutes was already 85. I had to eat a yogurt to keep it from completely tanking.

It seems the only way I can keep the spikes from happening is to eat extremely low carb continuously and that means avoiding a lot of foods that others may feel is ok in moderation (whole grains, some fruits, etc). 

This isn‚Äôt sustainable. I‚Äôm miserable when I spike/crash happens and I can‚Äôt seem to figure out what else to do. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs complicated by the surgery and I‚Äôve looked into some peer reviewed research on it, but nothing seems to lead to a definitive answer.

Actually finding the right words for this is more difficult than I anticipated haha. Alright! I am searching for something serious and long lasting and real! I wonder if I make a post here I get some more out of it than from dating apps ü§¢üòÇ. They are just so draining and fake lol. Oh and monogamouso ofc!
First of all I don't mind long distance relationships as long as there is a want from both of us to get together at somepoint and that's why I'm okey with anywhere!

Now, a few words to introduce myself! 
I'm Marvin, 26 and from Germany. I am a huge gaming nerd and music enthusiast, currently I am even learning how to play the guitar! These two things really keep me going. Personality wise I would say that I'm a weird combination. Funny, confident, talkative but also edgy, emotional and stuck in my own head. Some online place said I'm an an INFP so that cool!  I don't smoke or do drugs, very rarely drink. I got no pricings but I'm tattooed!
I'm also very animal friendly I used to have a dog for a long time and currently got my little cat Huby! (Yes I can share pictures for sure haha)
I am very into psychology and mental health since I recently started investing in my own and now I have a much better understanding of that topic. It is so unbelievably important.
I live a pretty stable life when it comes to work and a place to live. I have my own house with garden but it's so much room and so much work for me all alone. This house needs some life with a loving girl next to me maybe some kids and maybe a family dog haha! Also I'm not dead set on this house. I wouldn't mind selling and relocating someplace nice. Just so you know lol. I'd like to have a girl that understands and cares for me, someone I can be a mountain to hold onto for, somebody I can share my passion and love with. I love spending time together doesn't matter what! Cooking together or grocerie shopping, showering or working in the garden, watching movies or playing video games together all of it is great. I don't mind sharing pictures or face timing at all whenever you feel comfortable with that! To be a bit confident I can say that I don't look all to bad I just haven't gotten any luck yet lol. That might change today tho!
I really hate talking about myself this much and the amount of ""I"" or ""I'm"" I said is actually upsetting me lmao üò≠

So hey if you are still reading and are actually interested in learning more about me then feel free to send me a message! I don't really mind your age so 18-35 sound fine by me! I answer as soon as I see it. I got some free time at the moment haha! I'm looking forward to getting to know you! And if I'm not your cup of tea maybe I am a coffee lol üòâü§î

There were so many tears and so much wailing. I wanted to be done and get life over with, go right to the end with a natural death. 

I have everything in life. Good money, a family that is supportive and tries with me, a nice house I live in, friends that are there for me, a great job, yet I feel nothing. Absolutely nothing. 

I don't know what I'm gaining by writing this, or even what I want out of this, but I'm broken. I've been broken. I've never been diagnosed or have been to therapy, yet I know I should. 

A few weeks ago I was in the same place, depression, thoughts of hurting myself, emptiness, nothing, everything. Then I met her. 

I find a girl that I really like, I thought she liked me but I just don't know anymore. We went for coffee, we had fun, we exchanged numbers, but I just don't think she likes me like I like her, calling me a friend and shit. I fantasize too much about what we could be, I didn't want to think about what might not be. And here I am, back to where I was before. The thought of her and I was some sense of hope. I'm alone. 

I still have some sense right now, I'm not as fucked emotionally and mentally as I was a few weeks ago, I don't want to harm myself right now. But I'm scared. I don't want to be that broken person again and I feel it emerging and slowly getting to that again. 

I would never off myself, because I know the endless pain it'd bring people in my life. In the end, I know people care about me and I have a overall good life, I just want the pain to end.

Anyways my question is- how can you identify whether it‚Äôs a UTI, cystitis, Candida  or as my GP says, an overactive bladder? Secondly, how can I deal with this without antibiotics which truly truly destroys the gut and mood? For context also dealing with Peri - which I know ramps up symptoms , and adhd.

I have methane dominant SIBO, slow transit but often have loose poop/diarrhea.  Typically takes me 45 minutes to go in the morning with 2 coffees, but I am not showing signs of being constipated in the traditional sense. 

It used to take me 5 minutes with one sip of coffee, so we are definitely in a different place now.

A few years of taking antidepressants didn‚Äôt help with the motility issue and made it worse, which I didn‚Äôt realize. I am not taking them any longer, it‚Äôs been about 2 years since I have taken them. 

I am taking 2 mg of motegrity which helps some but it‚Äôs not enough. I have been layering motility activator with it, which does work to some extent, but I have to be careful not to take too much or I make myself sick. 

Since taking motility activator and motegrity I no longer have hours of searing abdominal pain after using the bathroom. It doesn‚Äôt seem to speed anything up, but the removal of that intense pain is not something I would trade for anything.

As far as diet, it seems that nothing helps with motility. In fact the foods I am supposed to eat (eg low carb, meat, etc) slow my motility further. If I drink alcohol or eat sugar it‚Äôs faster. The fiber component is confusing to me and I haven‚Äôt done much with that. I tried fibercon for a week or so and maybe it helped some, but it hurt my stomach. 

I have tried a ton of things to get rid of my SIBO (pretty much everything except the elemental diet). But I know for a fact I will not feel better or get rid of it until I get my motility addressed.

1krbfk2,https://www.reddit.com/r/CatAdvice/comments/1krbfk2/fiance_and_i_disagree_on_rehoming_our_cats/,Fiance and I disagree on rehoming our cats,"Hey all, I desperately need some advice. I (24f) and my fiance (27m) adopted two kittens that are a little older than a year, and I'd like to rehome them. I already know that I'm the asshole, and I feel awful about it, but I'm not sure what the right thing to do is. Some important context:

\- I'm not a cat person.

\- My fiance loves cats.

\- It was my idea to adopt the kittens to begin with (a coworker of mine who volunteered at the shelter invited us to come pet some kitties at a local business. I really liked one kitten that slept in my arms the whole time. I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT THIS THROUGH WAY MORE, I didn't know what I was getting into. Quickly one kittnen turned into 2 after pressure from shelter workers on adoption day).

\- I have never owned a cat before, let alone 2.

\- I have a mini dachshund (Frank) that I've had before my fiance and I met.

\- We got the kittens while dating, but had the understanding that the kittens were his, while Frank was mine. (I think it's good to plan for just in case, as no one wants to fight over pets and deal with a break up IF we ever had to go down that road.)

\- Because of this and our pet prefrences, a condition of the cats was that they were my fiance's responsibility (financially, litter box, feedings, etc.), with resonable exceptions.

\- I am an AVID knitter. Yarn and crafts are how I spend the bulk of my free time, and knitting greatly reduces stress in my life.

\- We are currently living in a two bedroom apartment, but hopefully moving into a townhouse/small house over the summer.

\- Before my fiance moved into our now shared apartment, the second bedroom was my craft room. It's now been converted into his office and the cat room. (houses his desk, their litter box and feeding situation)

\- I believe it's important to follow through with commitments.

OKAY with that out of the way, here's my problem with the cats. They love to eat my yarn. They'll chew it, break it, swallow it, and just generally ruin my projects as I'm working on them (for a long time it was only loose yarn they would chew on, NEVER anything that was knit up. So mostly they'd destory a whole ball of yarn, or bite it off right were it attatched to the worked fabric). They also chew wooden knitting needles.

At first, it seemed resonable for me to adapt to them, but it feels like the more careful I became, the sneakier the cats got. I have several knitting bags, and I've started to only use the bags that close (mostly). A lot of knitting bags are designed with small openings so that the knitter can have their bag closed but still pull yarn out. I've found the cats getting into my crafting things at least once per week since we got them over a year ago. I am not leaving my bags open, and just laying around for long periods of time, if I was being absolultely careless it would be easy to fix. I'd also like to point out I used to have a whole room as a dedicated space for my crafts, and have already done a lot of adjusting to accomodate my fiance and now the cats.

It's gotten to the point where I can't even get up to grab a glass of water and leave my knitting bag on the chair. If I do, there's a good chance that one of the cats went snooping. Feeling this hypervigilant in my home is fucking miserable, and makes me resent the cats constantly. Yes, I laugh at them sometimes, but I feel that all of the joys of cat ownership are overshadowed by the revolving door of ruined items.

On the other hand, the cats NEVER destroy anything of my fiance's. His primary hobby is playing video games. The cats don't chew his cables/wires, which to me resemble my yarn by way of shape and movement. I've expressed to him how upsetting it is to me when my things are wrecked, and it always feels like he's on the side of the cats. The repsonse I get is typically ""well, could you have put it away better?"" or ""sorry that happened, hopefully they don't do it again."" I would like to think if my dog had been reguarly destroying art pieces that he had spent a lot of time, money, and care making, that I'd do something. I know that cats are so so different, but I also have no idea becuase this is my first time having them.

The peak of this problem occurred yesterday. Until yesterday, they'd only chewed my loose yarn, NEVER something fully worked up. Last night, I decided to make cookies, so I tucked all of the loose yarn deep into the bag, and left it on the coffee table to keep an eye on it while I was a few steps away in the kitchen) One of the cats stole an icord (pls google non knitters for context, it's important) out of my knitting bag while I wasn't watching and chewed it to absolute pieces. An icord is the littlest step up from yarn, but this was a five stitch cord, so much more substantial than the yarn they had chewed previoulsy. I had a bit of a melt down, because the yarn was gifted to me from my parents trip to Switzerland years ago, and I was just barely going to have enough yarn to complete my planned project. The item I was knitting was a matching baby sweater and hat set for my future little ones, so I was particuarly attatched to it. Anyway, now that they cats have shown that they'll chew knit up objects (which are WAY HARDER to fix) I am seriously concerned for the rest of my work around the apartment. Since we're moving and the hot weather is arriving, most of my knits are put away for now. For 8 months out of the year, I have had knit blankets across every chair, and handknit mittens/hats/scarves end up on the ground sometimes because shit happens.

I am sick to my stomach worried about my projects, and resenting these fucking cats, and I don't know what to do. I know my fiance loves them, but I think they deserve a home where all of the occupants want them. At the same time, we signed up to care fo them, and part of me feels that I should suck it up and see it through. I am so worried that this is only going to get worse, and my fiance more attatched to them. pls help :)",0,1747763606.0,CatAdvice,15,0.33,False
1krbf8f,https://www.reddit.com/r/motherinlawsfromhell/comments/1krbf8f/mil_ruined_my_baby_shower/,MIL ruined my baby shower,"yesterday made a year since my baby shower. the memory still makes my stomach hurt. i never really talked to anyone abt it and i need to get it off my chest. i‚Äôm sorry if this is a long one and if it‚Äôs a little scattered üòÖ

to set the scene my mom, my MIL and i were all hosts for my baby shower but against my better judgment, my MIL took most of the financial responsibility. she paid for the venue, a small coffee shop, and most of the food. i paid for all decorations, games, prizes, and plates/utensils. while my mom made a few dishes and desserts. i handled all the invites and made sure to invite MILs friends and family.

the day of everything was okay. that is, until my family showed up. MILs whole demeanor changed like she expected none of my family to show up? she barely uttered two words to ANYONE other than the ppl she wanted to invite. however, i made sure to greet each and every person. she kept her nose up the whole entire time. ignored my mom every time she tried to co-host and stood in a corner with her friends. when it was time to open presents she left the room. she just wasn‚Äôt present AT ALL but i decided to ignore it to enjoy my day. 

at the end she started throwing everything away while we were taking posed pictures. i didn‚Äôt get my comment cards, my gift list for thank you cards, keep any of my decorations as keepsakes and no one got to take left over food. she leaves after throwing everything away without saying a word to anyone (all her invites had left ofc) 

so this is where i just sat back bc i knew the ball was going to drop after the way she left.

the next morning i get a call from her saying how she can‚Äôt believe how she was treated throughout my baby shower. her main reason was bc my mom was the main one taking pictures of everything and she was upset bc she didn‚Äôt feel like my mom took enough pictures of ‚Äúher and her family‚Äù to which i told her it wasn‚Äôt really my moms responsibility but she did get some. i asked to why wouldn‚Äôt she just take pictures too? she says ‚Äúwell i seen her taking them so i said ‚Äòi‚Äôll just sit back and watch bc i know what it‚Äôll be‚Äô‚Äù like what?? well when she wasn‚Äôt getting her way with that she goes off on me for spending the whole time only talking to my family. which just isn‚Äôt true at all. i hopped around constantly making sure everyone was included and having a good time. i didn‚Äôt even eat in the same room as my family (the coffee shop was quite small and had two rooms so unfortunately we were forced to split to eat) i sat with my husband, his great grandma and my close friend and her boyfriend. i told her she wouldn‚Äôt have even noticed tho bc she didn‚Äôt leave her corner of friends the whole time! 

she completely lost it. she started bringing up everything she‚Äôs ever done for me. how she‚Äôs ‚Äújust the MIL and they‚Äôre just the family of the son‚Äù. i was 35 weeks pregnant. i was so emotional and completely overtook but i stood my ground and stood up for myself. she couldn‚Äôt handle this. she threatened me. said horrible things abt me and my family. it ultimately ended in me taking a step away from a previously (what i thought) great MIL/DIL relationship. 

i found out later that she was so nasty to my whole family that day. making rude comments or just ignoring them all together. 

i hate that this still bothers me even a year later, even after being NC for 6 months. am i crazy for feeling this way? i just hate that a moment and memory that should‚Äôve been so special was made unforgettable for a very different reason.",6,1747763586.0,motherinlawsfromhell,9,1.0,False

*Thirty years old*

For years, I believed evil lived only in the shadows. I imagined it crouched in the corners of my room, waiting for nightfall to soften my defenses. I thought it whispered from behind closet doors, creeping closer with each breath I surrendered to sleep, until it slid beneath my bed, silent, patient, reaching for me with invisible hands.

But I was wrong.

Evil does not always wear darkness like a cloak. It walks in daylight, dressed in familiar faces. It sits beside us at the dinner table, smiles in family photographs, and speaks in the soft cadence of someone who once said they loved you. It shakes hands. It goes to work. It fools everyone.

The most terrifying truths are the ones we learn too late. Mine began unraveling when I was seventeen, and it came not with a roar, but a whisper, so quiet I almost mistook it for affection.

**Chapter Two**  
*Seventeen Years Old*

I rush out of the house, Rihanna‚Äôs *Loud* album blasting through my headphones, the bass vibrating through my chest like a heartbeat that finally feels like my own. It‚Äôs the day after my birthday, and the world feels lighter, full of promise. My mother handed me some money this morning, an offering of freedom, and I cradle it like something sacred. I‚Äôm headed to the mall, a girl on a mission, dreaming of denim and new beginnings.

The September sun presses down in thick golden waves, and the air is humid, wrapping around me like a second skin. I‚Äôm wearing shorts and a tank top, already sweating, but I don‚Äôt care. I‚Äôm in rhythm with the music, lost in it. The sidewalk becomes a stage, the city a blur. For a moment, I forget to look over my shoulder.

That‚Äôs when I notice him.

He walks ahead of me, tall and silent, dressed in contradiction. A dark hoodie pulled low over his head, jeans far too heavy for this heat, dark shoes that seem to swallow every sound. It‚Äôs strange, the way he moves, like the air around him doesn‚Äôt touch him. I don‚Äôt see his face, just his presence, and a flicker of confusion crosses my mind. Why would anyone dress like that on a day like this?

I don‚Äôt know it yet, but this is the first time I lay eyes on him. The first time he speaks to me.

He turns slightly and asks if we know each other, says I look familiar, maybe from his psychology class at the university. I laugh, a little flattered, and tell him no, I‚Äôm only in twelfth grade. His eyes widen, just enough for me to notice. He smiles and says he‚Äôs on his way to the mall to meet a friend. Later, I‚Äôll learn it was a date. But for now, the lie hangs in the air, soft and harmless.

We walk together. He doesn‚Äôt push. He doesn‚Äôt press. Just talks, casual, charismatic, warm in all the right places. I feel seen, like maybe I‚Äôve wandered into a movie scene where I‚Äôm the main character and the world is finally starting to pay attention.

When we reach the mall, he asks for my number. I give it to him. Why wouldn‚Äôt I? He seems kind. Safe. Like the opposite of danger. He smiles again and we part ways, slipping into separate crowds.

What I don‚Äôt realize in that moment is that something small but irreversible has just begun. A seed is planted. One I won‚Äôt see until it begins to bloom in ways I never could have imagined.

**Chapter Three**  
*Seventeen Years Old*

Tonight, there‚Äôs a different kind of buzzing in my belly. Not quite fear, not quite joy, something in between. For as long as I can remember, the night before a new school year has always carried a familiar tension, like a tightly wound string pulled just to the edge of breaking. Even as a little girl, quiet and cautious, I would lie awake trying to map out every possible version of the next day, what to say, how to smile, how to disappear just enough to be safe but not so much to be forgotten.

I‚Äôve always felt like an observer of life, studying people like characters in a play, memorizing how they moved, how they spoke. Mimicry became survival. I learned early that certain parts of me, my voice, my curiosity, the way I dressed, were things best hidden. They made me a target. And so I folded myself smaller and smaller, hoping that if I took up less space, the world would be kinder.

But this year‚Ä¶ this year is different.

There‚Äôs something new inside me, a lightness tangled with nerves. The anxiety hasn‚Äôt vanished, but it‚Äôs changed shape. I think it might be anticipation. Maybe even hope. For the first time, I have a clean slate.

Mom and I have moved to a new city. A bigger city. One that hums with anonymity and possibility. No one knows me here. No one remembers the girl I used to be. I have the chance to become‚Äîme. The me I‚Äôve kept hidden. The me I‚Äôve dressed only in the safety of my bedroom mirror. And tomorrow, that girl gets to walk into a new school with her head high.

My lunch is prepped, my school bag is zipped and waiting by the door, and the outfit I carefully picked out is laid across the chair. Every detail feels like a promise to myself. And just as I begin to settle into bed, my phone vibrates on the nightstand.

At first, I‚Äôm confused. I don‚Äôt recognize the number, and for a moment, I wonder if it‚Äôs a mistake. Then it comes back to me, that brief encounter a few days ago. The boy with the dark hoodie, the soft voice, the polite smile. I barely remember what he looked like, and truthfully, I only gave him my number because it felt easier than saying no.

I don‚Äôt even remember his name.

The message is simple. *Hey, how are you?*

I pause, fingers hovering over the screen. I could ignore it. But something in me, a reflex, a lifetime of politeness, responds. I keep it short. Polite. Friendly. Harmless.

And so it begins.

Over the next week, we exchange messages here and there. Nothing deep. Nothing revealing. But he is persistent in a way that doesn‚Äôt feel aggressive, yet. He checks in. He compliments. He makes conversation. It‚Äôs easy to dismiss. Easy to believe this is just attention. A boy being nice.

Still, something tugs at the edge of my thoughts. A feeling, faint and fleeting, like a warning whispered from a distance I can‚Äôt quite hear.

**Chapter Four**  
*Seventeen Years Old*

Mom and I are having one of those weekends that drifts by without event, but somehow feels like a soft exhale. Familiar. Predictable. Safe. We‚Äôve had this kind of weekend for as long as I can remember. Yesterday, we went out to dinner with my aunt, uncle, and cousin, visiting from back home. We sat at a terrace, which I‚Äôve never liked. The sun beat down on my face like it had something to prove, the noise swirled around me like static, and I could feel my senses stretching thin, like threads about to snap.

Still, it‚Äôs good to see them. Good to have that small, flickering glimpse of the life we left behind, now playing out in this new place. It‚Äôs strange, how two different versions of home can meet like that. Old and new, colliding without warning, proving that some things don't have to cancel each other out. They can coexist. Awkwardly, imperfectly, but together.

Today is slower. Errands in the morning. Grocery bags in hand, windows down, the city moving around us in waves. And, like always, Sunday means cleaning day for Mom. I watch her moving through the apartment with practiced ease, wiping down counters like she‚Äôs restoring order to the world, one surface at a time.

My favorite part of Sundays, though, comes after all of that. After the errands, after the mopping, after the kitchen smells faintly of bleach and dinner. It‚Äôs when we both curl up on the couch with a bag of chips between us, some background noise playing on the TV, and slowly, inevitably, we fall asleep.

Today is no different.

We doze off in that peaceful, full-bellied way that only comes after cleaning and comfort food. But when I wake up, something is different. My phone buzzes on the coffee table, and without even reading the screen, my heart stumbles. Not a skip, not a drop, something more confusing. Both, maybe. A flutter and a fall. My hands are suddenly clammy, my chest tightening before I even know why.

Then I see it.  
*Hey, I‚Äôd like for us to see each other again. Are you available next Sunday? 5 p.m.?*

I reply *YES* so quickly I don‚Äôt even register my own fingers moving. I don‚Äôt think. I don‚Äôt pause. I don‚Äôt ask my mom. It‚Äôs like my body answers for me before my brain can catch up.

*Perfect,* he replies. *I‚Äôll pick you up. We‚Äôll get coffee.*

A quiet thread, almost imperceptible, begins to weave itself through the edges of my life. I can‚Äôt see the pattern yet, but I feel its presence, delicate, persistent. Not a warning exactly, but something unsettled. A shift in the air between what feels like attention‚Ä¶ and what feels like the beginning of something I won‚Äôt be able to undo.

**Chapter Five**  
*Seventeen Years Old*

I‚Äôm freaking out.

It hits me like a wave crashing all at once, this is my first *real* date. I‚Äôve been on dates before, sure, but not like this. Not with someone unfamiliar. Not with someone I didn‚Äôt grow up knowing by default. I‚Äôm from a small town, the kind where you‚Äôve already memorized everyone‚Äôs story before you‚Äôve even had your own. The boys I‚Äôve dated back home, I knew their moms, their dads, sometimes even their grandparents if they were still around. Our families shared history before we ever had a chance to build anything ourselves.

But this? This is different. This is new. Unknown.

I spend the entire day unraveling in small ways, pacing back and forth, rehearsing my smile, softening my voice like I‚Äôm preparing for a scene in a play. I take more showers than I care to admit. Anxiety makes me feel sticky, like my own skin doesn‚Äôt quite fit, so I wash it off and start again. I straighten my hair, again and again, going over already smooth strands until they‚Äôre flat and lifeless. I cycle through outfits like a storm in a closet, changing over and over, unsure of who I want to be tonight. My makeup becomes a ritual, slow, deliberate, a kind of armor.

I want this to be perfect. I want *me* to be perfect.

Bath and Body Works body mist clouds the air around me like a spell I‚Äôm trying to cast, sweet, sugary, overwhelming. I wait by the door, practically vibrating with anticipation. My mom chuckles from the kitchen.

‚ÄúYou know pacing isn‚Äôt going to make him arrive faster,‚Äù she teases. ‚ÄúCome sit, relax. He‚Äôll come.‚Äù

But time begins to stretch like it‚Äôs mocking me. Fifteen minutes pass. Then thirty. Still nothing. An hour. I send him a message, just a small one, cautious. No response.

Is this normal? Are people just casually late to dates? My chest tightens. There‚Äôs a dull ache blooming in my stomach, a pit I‚Äôve known before, the early warning sign of disappointment. I can feel it forming, solid and cold.

My mom tries to comfort me, gently, but I can see the unease flicker across her face. Her daughter, all dressed up, waiting in vain. In her eyes, I‚Äôm about to be stood up for the first time.

Then, my phone buzzes.

*I‚Äôm running late. I‚Äôll be there soon.*

No apology. Just that.

I exhale, a shaky, relieved breath. Okay. He‚Äôs coming. Thank God.

I tell my mom, trying to make it sound casual, but she‚Äôs not impressed. I beg her to let me go anyway. She agrees, reluctantly, but only if he comes to the door to introduce himself, and only if I‚Äôm back by 8 p.m. I nod eagerly. Deal.

When he finally arrives, it‚Äôs two hours late.

He greets my mom, quickly, politely. He‚Äôs kind, charismatic, the kind of charming that slips through the cracks before you even know it‚Äôs there. Then we‚Äôre off, and I don‚Äôt even ask where we‚Äôre going. I‚Äôm just relieved. He came. That‚Äôs all I care about.

The date is short. Less than an hour. We sit and talk over a donut and hot chocolate. I learn he‚Äôs twenty, in his second year of university, studying computer engineering. He tells stories about his childhood, and I offer pieces of mine in return. It‚Äôs simple. Uncomplicated. Or at least it seems to be.

I thank him for the evening, too shy to offer a hug, but he doesn‚Äôt try either. He just smiles, respectful. A perfect gentleman.

Or so I think.

I go to bed with my heart fluttering like it‚Äôs finally allowed to feel something good. My lips still curve into a smile I can‚Äôt suppress. He showed up. He didn‚Äôt forget me.

I don‚Äôt bring up the delay. I don‚Äôt ask why. I forgive him before the night even ends.

Is it desperation? Na√Øvet√©? Or just kindness taken too far?

I don‚Äôt know.

All I know is‚ÄîI like him.

‚ÄúUuuh, uuuuuuuh‚Ä¶ so sleepyÔΩûÔΩûÔΩû‚Ä¶‚Äù

Cassandra Ilion hadn‚Äôt been getting enough sleep lately.

She was *that* sleep-deprived‚Äîher body felt heavy, not just her head. Dark circles had begun to form under her eyes, and the headache she had now might as well evolve into full-on exhaustion.

Seeing Cassandra staggering toward the table at their base, Daphne, already seated and waiting for breakfast, looked at her in shock.

‚ÄúAgain? You‚Äôve been like this every day lately. What have you been doing at night?‚Äù

‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt been doing anythingÔΩû. I just‚Ä¶ can‚Äôt sleep well‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúWant me to make you some angelica herbal tea? It‚Äôll cost 800 valis‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre charging me, NazhaÔΩû?‚Äù

*And it‚Äôs expensiveÔΩû.* Commander Nazha offered the suggestion with an ambiguous tone‚Äîunclear whether it was out of kindness or business‚Äîleaving Cassandra to weep as she pulled out a chair and sat down.

Breakfast at the Miach Familia was the same as ever.

On the table were golden-toasted bread and perfectly cooked sunny-side-up eggs, made by today‚Äôs breakfast chef, Daphne, along with a simple vegetable soup. Nazha, who had low blood pressure and was not a morning person, wasn‚Äôt quite as bad off as Cassandra but still sat with half-lidded eyes, sipping only coffee. She gently placed a cup of special yogurt‚Äîgifted from the Hermes Familia‚Äîin front of Cassandra.

How nice, Cassandra thought innocently‚Ä¶ but when she saw the mysterious green syrup being poured from a test tube, she grew worried, wondering sadly if it might be some experimental drug still in testing. Since the Miach Familia managed medicine, they were often roped into the commander‚Äôs unilateral clinical trials. While Daphne had found it annoying when she first joined the familia, and Cassandra still got a slight burning sensation in her nose from it, both had now grown used to it.

Although their god, Miach, was apparently too busy to join them, it was still breakfast as usual.

And yet‚ÄîCassandra couldn‚Äôt help but feel that something was *off*.

(All because of those ‚Äòdreams‚Äô I‚Äôve been having every night‚Ä¶)

When did it start again? She remembered it being shortly after the Goddess Festival ended.

Just like before, Cassandra had started having those painful, troubling ""prophetic dreams.""

But this time, there was one strange thing that made them different from the others.

No matter how she tried to interpret them, these dreams were about things she had no recollection of‚Äîthings that seemed entirely unrelated to her.

‚ÄúIn a wasteland of sighs and despair, a lonely rabbit cries out‚Äî‚Äù

Thus began a fifteen-verse ‚Äúprophecy‚Äù poem.

Accompanied by blurry dream images, the scenes showed a pitiful rabbit crying, a band of berserkers trying to tear him to pieces and devour him‚Äîyet strangely, they ended up acknowledging his perseverance, letting him sit at the same table and eat with them. Violent yet not without warmth, these images were followed by thunderous lightning, darkness swallowing everything, flashes of weapons, and a war chariot running the rabbit over until he was tattered and torn. It was a cruel, deeply affecting battlefield‚Äîone that Cassandra couldn‚Äôt watch without being plagued by nightmares.

Then came witches, their heads covered in ash, casting magic on the dying rabbit boiling in a giant pot to revive him. In short, it was an epic tale of a small rabbit gradually being recognized and rising to prominence‚Ä¶ or so it appeared.

All of it, however, took place in a cradle (walled garden) held in the arms of a massive goddess lying at the edge of the Milky Way‚Äîa ‚Äúprophetic dream‚Äù of truly astronomical scale.

It made no sense. She couldn‚Äôt understand it. It was impossible to interpret.

At the very least, Cassandra was deeply confused.

Because she hadn‚Äôt seen any crisis befalling herself or those close to her.

Cassandra‚Äôs prophetic dreams had always warned her about disasters that would happen nearby‚Äîor terrible dooms so great they would cause her to faint. But this time‚Äî

(*Neither I nor little Daphne are the ‚Äúmain subjects‚Äù‚Ä¶?*)

That‚Äôs what Cassandra concluded.

Twisted by the goddess‚Äôs *charm*, she had come to believe she ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt close to the rabbit‚Äù and ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt even know him.‚Äù Cassandra Ilion now mistakenly thought the dream truly had nothing to do with her.

‚ÄîBut prophetic dreams transcend not only mortal understanding but even divine logic. They are not affected by *charm*.

There wasn‚Äôt even a *sense of unease*, let alone suspicion.

Yet Cassandra herself could not escape the influence of *charm*.

This created an intense internal contradiction‚Äî*she could see* the dream, *but couldn‚Äôt recognize it as significant*‚Äîwhich led to her current disarray.

The result? Chaos.

Every night she was tormented by uninterrupted dreams, trapped in nightmares, unable to sleep‚Äîand this exhaustion had plunged her into her current confused state.

(*In any case, if we ignore this prophecy, something tragic will happen to us too‚Ä¶*)

When the rabbit in the cradle (walled garden), held in the arms of the grieving goddess, closes his eyes, this entire universe‚Äîincluding the Labyrinth City (Orario), where Cassandra and the others live‚Äîwill come to an end. That was the implication of the dream.

But, well‚Ä¶ how should she put it? It somehow felt like it would be fine to not help the battered Mr. Rabbit. Or rather, a small yet towering, paradoxical ‚Äúgiant‚Äù‚Äîclearly a dream-like fantasy‚Äîwould cause a quake, and when Mr. Rabbit was bathed in golden light cascading down from the illusionary heights, he would return to full strength and seem ready to let out a defiant roar.

If this were a play, it‚Äôd be the climax of all climaxes. The beginning of the counterattack. The one moment that made Cassandra‚Äîafter watching this dream repeatedly‚Äîhold her breath and want to cheer him on.

Fluffy Mr. Rabbit, go get back that undying flame„Éº!

Setting that aside‚Ä¶

Back to the point‚Äîwas this really a disaster that concerned her?

Couldn‚Äôt it just be someone else‚Äôs nightmare?

One ‚Äúresident of the cradle (Cassandra)‚Äù found herself utterly lost, for the first time since birth doubting her own prophetic dreams.

(*But still‚Ä¶ the ‚Äúwarning‚Äù this time feels‚Ä¶ urgent, somehow‚Ä¶*)

Many of Cassandra‚Äôs *‚Äúprophetic dreams‚Äù* are vague outlines of the future‚Äîessentially, things that cannot be interfered with or avoided‚Äîfollowed by a *‚Äúwarning‚Äù* about how to avoid them.  
This time, too, such a *‚Äúwarning‚Äù* was issued, but how should one put it‚Ä¶ it was a bit rambling.  
To be specific, it went something like this:

‚ÄúHaa\~\~, now‚Äôs your big chance to surpass all the other girls (heroines)\~\~\~. You might even pull off a dramatic reversal, rack up a bunch of affection points, and earn the right to pet Mr. Bunny to your heart‚Äôs content\~\~\~. You probably can‚Äôt win a head-on war against the sacred fire or longing or all the other obstacles, but right now, you could slip into a *deliciously advantageous* position\~\~\~.  
A reverse Arabian Nights tale of yearning? That sounds amazing‚Äî!‚Äù  
(*Paraphrased*)

Something like that.  
While a fair bit of that was paraphrased, this was the gist of what Cassandra understood.  
One might say‚Ä¶ this is the fork in the road where she stops being a prophet of tragedy and becomes a prophet of happiness.

‚ÄúUuuuu, what‚Äôs a delicious memory? Reverse pillow talk? Not the princess, but the prince reading bedtime stories to me, the girl constantly haunted by nightmares, until I fall asleep...? Why would it turn out like this!? I can‚Äôt stop thinking about it\~\~\~!‚Äù

‚ÄúShut up already, Cassandra! What are you rambling about!?‚Äù

‚ÄúTroubled by dreams seen at dawn, she sets sail for the sea of delusion‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre still such a girl, Cassandra.‚Äù

As Cassandra recalled the contents of the dream, her cheeks flushed, and she unintentionally blurted things out. Her body twisted awkwardly from embarrassment.  
Daphne, who was having breakfast, frowned at the bizarre behavior, while Nahza gave her a warm, understanding look.  
Needless to say, Cassandra, having made a fool of herself, turned bright red and let out a scream.

‚ÄúUuuu\~\~,‚Äù

She sobbed again, and after finishing breakfast and cleaning up, she stood alone at the sink, washing the dishes.

‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to think this dream has nothing to do with me‚Ä¶ but does it, after all?‚Äù

Really? She wondered, rinsing the soapy dishes under water. The bubbles came from medicine bearing the \[Miach Familia\] emblem.

Though it wasn‚Äôt a matter of life and death, when she received the warning *‚ÄúIt would be such a shame to miss this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity!‚Äù*, Cassandra became an *‚Äúinvolved party.‚Äù*  
A ‚Äúresident of the walled garden (Cassandra)‚Äù who felt no *‚Äúdiscomfort‚Äù* or *‚Äúdoubt‚Äù* had no choice but to make that judgment.

And so, Cassandra decided it was time to seriously confront her *prophetic dream*.  
No matter how many days passed, the dream‚Äôs contents didn‚Äôt update, and that fact alone stopped her from escaping into fantasy. It made her think.

‚ÄúThe subject of the prophecy is the ‚Äòwhite rabbit‚Äô‚Ä¶ and when it comes to rabbits in Orario, the first that comes to mind is surely the one from the Freya Familia‚Äî*Mr. Rabbit Foot*.‚Äù

Besides the rabbit-type adventurers, the first on the list of candidates was the young man who had continuously performed miracles.  
A terrifying member of that *Freya Familia*, this year‚Äôs number-one rookie.  
No‚Äîperhaps there will never again be a rookie greater than him.  
That‚Äôs how exceptional he is‚Äîthe first in history to be called the *‚Äúfastest rabbit in the world.‚Äù*

He kept growing stronger and stronger, achieving three *level-ups* in just half a year‚Äîan unprecedented, over-spec feat.  
He wasn't just the talk of Orario, but likely gaining attention across the world.  
A tenacious *Einherjar*, worthy of praise as one of the ‚Äústrongest‚Äù members of the city‚Äôs strongest Familia.

Cassandra was shocked when she first heard about *Rabbit Foot*.  
She thought, ‚ÄúThe Freya Familia really is amazing.‚Äù  
Though strangely, she couldn‚Äôt remember when exactly she had thought that.

‚ÄúMy relationship with Mr. Rabbit Foot‚Ä¶ is it one of an attacker and the one defeated? Lord Apollo showed interest in Mr. Rabbit Foot, angered Lady Freya, and she wiped out the Istar Familia‚Äîand us‚Äîtogether‚Ä¶‚Äù

She muttered this *pseudo-history* that played out in their miniature world, letting out a troubled ‚ÄúHmm‚Ä¶‚Äù

As expected, in Cassandra‚Äôs memories, she had no personal connection to Bell Cranel.  
They‚Äôd never been especially close.  
Though they were in opposing factions at one point, both Cassandra and Bell had simply been members of their respective familias‚Äînever fought directly, nor shared any particular conversation or encounter.  
There was no obvious link between them.

‚ÄúMaybe we were actually childhood friends from our hometown, engaged to reunite someday atop the clock tower‚Ä¶‚Äù

She muttered, borrowing from a romance novel she‚Äôd read recently‚Äîonly to turn beet red from embarrassment at her own delusions and self-destruct beautifully.

‚ÄúAh, but‚Ä¶ we *did* meet recently. I was so startled‚Ä¶ so terrified at the time‚Ä¶‚Äù

That was the day after the Goddess Festival ended.  
While the Familia was helping clean up after the event, Bell Cranel had shown up in front of them.

Cassandra had gone pale with fear.  
That had been the day she first dreamed the prophecy‚Äîand when she was still half-convinced it was just a normal dream and had nothing to do with her‚Äîthe *‚Äúwhite rabbit‚Äù* of the prophecy had appeared before her very eyes.  
It was eerie. She got goosebumps all over.  
She hadn‚Äôt yet deciphered the dream deeply, and the thought that the *world really might end* had given her a serious shock.  
It was the moment she truly became convinced that this large-scale dream wasn‚Äôt irrelevant to her.

‚Äú‚Ä¶Come to think of it, Mr. Rabbit Foot‚Äôs eyes back then‚Ä¶ when he looked at us‚Ä¶ they seemed kind of strange‚Ä¶?‚Äù

Though her mind had gone blank at the time and she had no mental leeway, she still remembered Bell Cranel seeming‚Ä¶ odd.

The way he looked at her and the others‚Äîit was as if he was seeking help, or like a lost child searching for their family or a friend‚Ä¶  
That was the impression she got in hindsight.  
Of course, neither Cassandra nor Daphne remembered being stared at in such a way.  
If there was any sense of ‚Äúdiscomfort,‚Äù it was probably just that.

‚ÄúDoes Mr. Rabbit Foot‚Ä¶ *know* us?‚Äù

Putting aside the abnormality of the *prophetic dream*, Cassandra was, at her core, a thoroughly objective outsider.  
Unlike certain blacksmiths warped by obsession, she wasn‚Äôt emotionally swayed, nor did she feel out of place in the world.  
Her perspective was one that could be called nearly indistinguishable from that of an *ordinary person*.

That‚Äôs why she didn‚Äôt violate the *rules of the walled garden*, nor was she bound by the chains of *charm*, able to think in the most ordinary‚Äîand in some ways, most free‚Äîmanner possible.

Once the gears started to turn, she was the most likely to magnificently shatter the rules of the *garden*‚Äîthis *‚Äúprophet of tragedy‚Äù* remained completely unaware that she was, in fact, a *‚Äúbeast of possibility.‚Äù*  
‚ÄúHmmmm‚Ä¶‚Äù she mused, finishing the dishes at her own relaxed pace, still in inner turmoil.

(*Translator‚Äôs note: ‚ÄúBeast of Possibility‚Äù is a reference to Universal Century Gundam.*)

Just then, Daphne‚Äôs voice called from outside.

‚ÄúCassandra! We‚Äôre scheduled to deliver recovery potions today. Time to go!‚Äù

‚ÄúR-Right!‚Äù

She replied quickly and scampered off toward the entrance.

As she stepped out of their base, *Sky Blue Apothecary*, she saw Nahza and Daphne loading several items onto a wooden cart.

‚ÄúAre we delivering to Miss Lili‚Äôs place today‚Ä¶?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶ Gotta treat regular customers right, after all‚Ä¶‚Äù

""You say that, but you‚Äôre going to haggle with Liliruca afterward anyway, right?""

Cassandra confirmed, and Naza nodded in response. Daphne already looked stunned by the inevitable price negotiations. The dog person with half-lidded eyes gave a small smile, the corners of her mouth rising slightly.

The **Miach Familia**, in addition to selling goods at their base, also delivers items like this to their regular customers. Close associates such as Hestia, Takemikazuchi, and Hermes‚Äîwho values relationships with other familias‚Äîare all considered loyal clients worthy of this service.

Aside from the items they order, Naza and her group also promote new products, regularly venture into the Dungeon, and earn rewards from adventurer commissions to fund the familia's operations‚Äî*and* to repay debts to the **Dian Cecht Familia**. All of this keeps both Daphne and Cassandra incredibly busy. Even a pharmacy-focused familia isn‚Äôt having an easy time‚Äîbut still, it's kind of fun, Cassandra thought, having converted from another familia.

Although she offered to handle things with Daphne, Naza politely declined and set out herself, pulling the cart from their base. Once they passed through the alley and entered the bustling main street, several familiar adventurers called out with ‚ÄúOh!‚Äù and proactively offered to buy recovery potions.

They were all people who had bought goods from the **Miach Familia** before.

Naza, who had cleverly stuffed the cart with a wide variety of items, skillfully promoted a certain product.

The new potion she developed‚Äîthe *Double Recovery Potion*‚Äîwas well received among adventurers. It had apparently been selling even before Cassandra and Daphne transferred into the familia. The rival powerhouse **Dian Cecht Familia** had yet to develop something similar, so the **Miach Familia** held a dominant share in what was considered the ‚Äúmost consumer-satisfying‚Äù segment of the market.

But Naza said:

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what the quality would be like, but I bet that ‚ÄòHoly Lady‚Äô over there could‚Äôve made it a long time ago‚Ä¶ She just didn‚Äôt out of pity for us‚Ä¶ which is so *infuriating*.‚Äù

Apparently so. She expressed outright hostility toward the city‚Äôs top healer.

Regardless, Naza was pouring all the profits from the *Double Recovery Potion* into developing new products. It seemed she had almost succeeded in creating her long-desired panacea. Creating a panacea was considered ‚Äúthe dividing line between high-grade pharmacists and the rest,‚Äù and in that sense, the **Miach Familia** was gradually gaining recognition in the City of Adventurers, Orario. Just like in the familia‚Äôs heyday before its decline.

‚ÄúBy the way, is Liliruca at the manor today?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, it‚Äôs their Dungeon rest day‚Ä¶ I double-checked. Perfect‚Äî‚Äù

While Cassandra nervously played the role of a shopkeeper, exchanging recovery potions for money with adventurers, Daphne and Naza chatted while heading down a shortcut toward the southwestern district.

Their destination was the **Hestia Familia‚Äôs** home base, *Hearthstone Manor*.

It was also the former base of the **Apollo Familia**, where Cassandra and Daphne had once lived. After their crushing defeat by Freya‚Äôs forces, their god Apollo had been ordered into exile outside the city. Before leaving, he expressed a divine will to leave the manor to his beloved goddess‚Äîwhom he had once proposed to in heaven‚ÄîHestia. Freya and the Guild had approved it. Cassandra couldn‚Äôt recall exactly when her former god (Apollo) had said that, but figured ‚Äúthat‚Äôs just how it is‚Äù and didn‚Äôt dwell on it. *Shouldn‚Äôt* dwell on it. The *Chains of Enchantment* rattled deep inside her heart.

Naza, sensing business opportunities, casually made deals with adventurers as she strolled along. The group headed toward the **Hestia Familia‚Äôs** base.

And then‚Äî

‚ÄúBell, you‚Äôve had enough, haven‚Äôt you? The **Hestia Familia** isn‚Äôt your companion anymore.‚Äù

‚ÄúRasuke‚Äôs right. I get that you *want* to believe those cursed implanted memories‚Ä¶ but it‚Äôs only going to hurt you. Even Lady Freya is worried about you.‚Äù

(‚Ä¶Ah.)

They came upon a group of individuals dressed in silver uniforms, embodying the very fear the city held.

The strong warriors of the **Freya Familia**. Handsome human men and women, an irritable-looking pallum‚Äîand at the center, looking utterly miserable, Bell Cranel himself.

More than the intimidating warriors, Cassandra was first startled by his white hair.

The *Rabbit of Prophecy*‚Äîjust like in the verses‚Äîlooked freezing cold and utterly exhausted. Despite having no visible injuries, he was being kindly comforted by his companions, hands on his shoulders, showing concern.

(That‚Äôs‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs *Mr. Rabbit Foot*‚Ä¶? What are they doing? I think I heard them mention the **Hestia Familia**‚Ä¶)

He was still resisting the ‚Äúfalse history‚Äù imposed by the *Haknieve* (Box Garden), desperately clinging to his true memories.

He had tried speaking with members of the **Hestia Familia**, but the pallum girl had recoiled in fear and fled, like he was a terrifying stranger they couldn‚Äôt be associated with.

As a result, the strong warriors comforted him, urging him to give up, to stop hurting himself.

That was the truth of the situation‚Äîbut Cassandra and the others had no way of knowing it.

In fact, Naza and Daphne, like some of the **Hestia Familia**, went pale and panicked, hurriedly hiding the cart behind the corner of an alley.

‚Äú**Flint**, **Aleguld**, **Heluwhill**‚Ä¶ and even **Rabbit Foot**‚Äîa nightmare group of all Level 4s‚Ä¶‚Äù

\[*Translator‚Äôs note: The original Japanese titles ‚ÄúÊñß„ÅÆÁ•ùÊùØÔºà„Ç®„Éº„É´„ÇÆ„É•„É´„ÉâÔºâ‚Äù and ‚ÄúËªçÈéñÔºà„Éò„É´„Ç¶„Ç£„É´Ôºâ‚Äù don‚Äôt have clearly known references. These English equivalents are best guesses.*\]

‚ÄúWhy is the **Freya Familia** in a place like this?‚Äù

Seeing second-tier adventurers they knew they couldn‚Äôt possibly win against, Naza and Daphne reacted like small animals hiding from a passing wolf pack, terrified of getting caught up in something.

This reaction showed how the **Freya Familia** was perceived in Orario. Only Cassandra, held back by Daphne, felt differently.

She secretly peeked out from the corner, staring at the white-haired boy.

(I really don‚Äôt understand **Mr. Rabbit Foot**‚Ä¶ Sh-Should I talk to him? The *prophecy* was so heart-throbbing, and he looks like he‚Äôs suffering. If there‚Äôs anything I can do to help‚Ä¶)

He didn‚Äôt react at all to ‚Äúothers‚Äô gazes‚Äù‚Äîthinking it was just more ordinary people afraid of ‚ÄúBell Cranel of the Freya Familia,‚Äù too miserable to even respond. His side profile looked so pained, it made Cassandra‚Äôs cheeks flush red.

(A-And this is the first time I‚Äôve had this kind of *prophecy*‚Ä¶ Could it be fate, d-destiny‚Äîlike we‚Äôre *fated lovers*‚Ä¶! Maybe he‚Äôll believe in my prophetic dreams, a one-of-a-kind soulmate who *understands* me‚Ä¶!!)

Her delusion stemmed from reading too many romance novels‚Äîbut it wasn‚Äôt entirely wrong.

(Also, now that I look closely, he‚Äôs so cute it‚Äôs hard to believe he‚Äôs an adventurer. I don‚Äôt know why, but I can imagine us eating an ‚ÄúUltimate Dungeon Sandwich ‚Äì Pearl Deluxe‚Äù and even feeding each other‚Ä¶ I just get this feeling that he‚Äôd actually listen to me when I talk‚Ä¶!)

Just as she steeled her resolve to step out and speak to Bell Cranel‚Äî

‚ÄúHuh?‚Äù

*Thud*‚Äîa light sound and impact came from her leg.

By the time she realized it, Cassandra was already kneeling on the stone pavement.

Someone had kicked the inside of her knee just as she was about to emerge from the corner, toppling her.

Once she realized that, her face was immediately overshadowed by a murderous aura.

‚Äú‚Äî‚ÄîYou little punk. What the hell were you trying to do just now?‚Äù

It was a half-pallum.  
A tough warrior who, despite being part of the silver-uniformed \[Freyja Familia\], was permitted to wear the black-silver captain‚Äôs uniform.

The moment Cassandra realized he was ‚ÄúIshibi‚Äù Van, a second-tier adventurer traveling with Bell Cranel and his companions, the blood drained from her face.

""You know we‚Äôre from the \[Freyja Familia\], and you still came to pick a fight?""  
‚ÄúEh, ah, eh‚Ä¶!?‚Äù  
""What‚Äôs your goal in trying to get close to that stupid rabbit?""

Van instantly noticed the suspicious figure (Cassandra) spying on them.  
He had approached in a way that even Daphne and the others hadn‚Äôt noticed, coming to *crush* the anomaly trying to make contact with the boy.

He forced Cassandra, who was taller than him, to her knees. Circling around to face her, he grabbed her collar. A vein bulged on his forehead, and his gaze radiated killing intent.  
It was a *warning* so terrifying that not just Cassandra, who bore the brunt of it, but even Daphne and Naaza, frozen stiff, turned pale.

Gripping her collar even harder, the tough warrior thrust his face right in front of hers and declared:  
‚ÄúIf you try anything unnecessary with him‚ÄîI‚Äôll kill you.‚Äù

Van threatened the girl in a deep, low voice inaudible to the boy and hidden from his sight. And with just that, Cassandra‚Äôs consciousness nearly fled.

Huuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuhhhh‚Äî‚Äî!!  
With horrified expressions, Daphne and Naaza moved even faster than the trembling Cassandra. In a panic, they wrenched the girl from Van‚Äôs hands, spun the cart full of goods around, and hurriedly rushed back the way they came.

""What the hell were you thinking, you dumb-ssandra!!""  
""Everyone in Orario knows not to get noticed by the \[Freyja Familia\]‚Ä¶!!""  
‚ÄúW-why, why!? I didn‚Äôt‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt even do anythingÔΩûÔΩûÔΩûÔΩûÔΩûÔΩûÔΩûÔΩûÔΩûÔΩûÔΩûÔΩûÔΩûÔΩûÔΩûÔΩûÔΩûÔΩûÔΩûÔΩûÔΩûÔΩûÔΩûÔΩûÔΩûÔΩûÔΩûÔΩûÔΩûÔΩûÔΩûÔΩû!?‚Äù

Carrying the unfortunate girl over her right shoulder, Daphne, and Naaza, pulling the cart, dashed through the streets faster than adventurers fleeing through a dungeon.  
Cassandra, clueless as to why the other party had gotten so angry, could only tremble and wail in confusion.

The ‚Äúprophet‚Äù‚Äôs attempt at contact was foiled by the tight security of the \[Freyja Familia\], which left no abnormal sign unchecked. It ended in failure.  
After this terrifying experience, Cassandra no longer dared to get near the boy.

""Mr. Van‚Ä¶? Did something happen?""  
""‚Ä¶A group of female thugs had their eyes on you. Probably the same ones who cursed you before.""  
‚ÄúEh‚Ä¶ ehhhhhhh!?‚Äù  
‚ÄúLusk, Remilia. Report to *a certain attendant.* Tell them there‚Äôs a ‚Äòdeviant‚Äô that needs to be eliminated.‚Äù

After the girls left, this was the conversation held between the boy and Van‚Äôs group.  
Ignoring Bell‚Äôs shocked reaction, they exchanged coded words he couldn‚Äôt understand‚Äî*a certain attendant* referred to a daughter of the gods (H√∂rn), and *deviant* was a code meaning an abnormality.  
While taking measures to protect the ‚Äúgarden,‚Äù from that day on, they strengthened Bell‚Äôs security even further.

‚Äî‚ÄîLater, the tragic prophet would again suffer the effects of a ‚Äúcharm‚Äù cast upon her, tormented by an even stronger ‚Äúprophetic dream,‚Äù but that goes without saying.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

‚Äú\[Little Rookie\], huh? A real super rookie has shown up. And to think, he caught up to my level in just half a year‚Ä¶ Should I say I‚Äôve lost face, or am I just too stunned by how abnormal it is‚Ä¶‚Äù

Asked a male party member (human) about ‚Äúa certain boy.‚Äù

‚ÄúOf all people, he had to be from the Freya Familia‚Ä¶ No, actually, it‚Äôd be even more shocking if a never-before-seen ‚Äòhero candidate‚Äô like that appeared *outside* the Freya Familia‚Ä¶ In any case, I feel very threatened. I mean this as someone who‚Äôs a candidate for executive leadership in a rival familia. There have already been rumors that we, the ‚Äòmiddle tier,‚Äô are falling behind those unshakable warriors.‚Äù

Asked a female party member (cat person) the same question.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt mention that name to me. Just hearing it pisses me off‚Äîsame as that damn mutt of a cat. ‚Ä¶Huh? A reason? Like hell I‚Äôm telling you!!‚Äù

Also asked a familia executive (werewolf).

‚Äú‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt know. I don‚Äôt know, but for some reason, it just feels painful, and lonely‚Äî‚Ä¶Huh, Finn? What are you doing here?‚ÄîEh? My answer to the question? What question?‚Äù

Repeatedly asked another executive (Amazon) as well, carefully avoiding arousing ‚Äúsuspicion,‚Äù while also deepening his conviction.

(‚ÄîSomething‚Äôs not right. There‚Äôs a strong sense of incongruity.)

In the office at their base.

In the room, empty except for himself, Finn sat in the chair behind the desk and muttered in his heart.

(I didn‚Äôt notice it at first. Just like Raul and the others, I thought I was simply continuing my usual routine, without realizing this sense of incongruity.)

Though Finn himself was unknowingly imprisoned under the rules of the ‚Äúwalled garden‚Äù by a charm spell, he had sensed the reason for this ‚Äúincongruity.‚Äù

It was entirely thanks to his ‚Äú**thumb**.‚Äù

(My thumb‚Ä¶ still aches faintly. As if it's sounding an alarm about this everyday life.)

Finn possessed a powerful ‚Äúintuition.‚Äù

It acted both as a ‚Äúwarning bell‚Äù signaling imminent danger or change, and could also be described as a ‚Äúsixth sense.‚Äù He had leveraged this intuition many times to great effect, especially in dungeon exploration.

Now, that ‚Äúintuition‚Äù was continuously in pain.

Not toward the future‚Äîbut the present.

As if declaring that this very everyday life was in fact *not* normal.

(The pain in my thumb is subtle and quiet, yet so constant it can‚Äôt be ignored‚Ä¶ From past experience, that means I‚Äôm already in danger‚Äîor caught in some kind of anomaly. I was just confused at first‚Ä¶ But now I understand. This ‚Äòabnormality‚Äô really is full of unknowns.)

Even when his intuition activated, Finn couldn‚Äôt foresee specific events or futures. At first, he had no idea what to be cautious of‚Ä¶ but unexpectedly, he soon found a hint of the ‚Äúincongruity.‚Äù

It was the placement of the ‚Äúdocuments‚Äù in this office.

Books and files whose positions had been slightly altered‚Äîchanges so subtle that no one would notice unless they had very precise memory, but Finn had noticed discrepancies.

Specifically: ‚Äúmaps of internal power structures in Orario and their changes over time,‚Äù ‚Äúcomparative data between his own and other familias,‚Äù and Finn‚Äôs own ‚Äúmore administrative journal than personal diary.‚Äù

When he checked their contents, he found it immediately.

There were signs of tampering.

As if someone were trying to reflect the ‚Äúcorrectness‚Äù of a certain prum, the materials had been rewritten cleanly, or entire pages had been torn out precisely. But to Finn‚Äôs eyes, it all looked deeply twisted.

That was when Finn realized the seriousness of the situation. Without jumping to conclusions, he carefully checked with others around him.

Aside from himself, the only ones who would access these materials were Riveria, Gareth, and their god, Loki. It was meaningless to suspect an intruder. If one had really existed, Finn would have noticed even before the pain in his thumb began. So he asked Gareth directly:

‚ÄúI told you, I haven‚Äôt been going through any of that stuff. How many times are you going to check?‚Äù

That was the answer. Just as he expected.

Finn had no memory of altering the materials‚Äîno memory even of asking Gareth and the others ‚Äúseveral times‚Äù about it.

Now a conclusion could be drawn.

The one feeling the ‚Äúincongruity‚Äù was Finn himself.

Or, perhaps, it was this very world that refused to let him remember or recognize the truth.

(Is this some kind of mental attack, or‚Ä¶? Ah, maybe even just *thinking* about it is dangerous. At this point, it‚Äôs like my thumb‚Äôs just toying with me.)

It was thanks to his sharp wit and heightened intuition that Finn was still able to ‚Äúwalk a tightrope‚Äù at all.

If he thought too deeply‚Äîif he attempted to break the rules of the ‚Äúwalled garden‚Äù‚Äîthe pain would intensify dramatically.

As if warning him: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt go any further.‚Äù

Using this pain as a guide, Finn adjusted his state of mind: recognizing the ‚Äúincongruity‚Äù but not allowing it to evolve into outright ‚Äúsuspicion.‚Äù That way, he maintained awareness that this ‚Äúdaily life‚Äù was in fact ‚Äúabnormal.‚Äù

(Still, this is severe. To force me to compartmentalize my own thoughts like this‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know if this comparison is appropriate, but I don‚Äôt have the ability to split my mind like the gods do. ‚ÄòOne wrong thought and it‚Äôs all over‚Äô‚Ä¶ this really is brutally effective against someone like me, a ‚Äúhero.‚Äù I might end up having a mental breakdown in a very *different* sense, from overthinking.)

Yet, the fear of the situation only grew stronger.

Sweat ran down Finn‚Äôs cheek‚Äîrare for him.

Though he could rely on his intuition to walk the tightrope, **several versions of Finn** had likely already fallen off and been swallowed by a hellish abyss. That much was clear from his repeated conversations with Gareth. His thumb‚Äîhis source of intuition‚Äîwas **gritting its teeth** in frustration from the endlessly repeating ‚Äúloops.‚Äù Strange as it sounded, the ‚Äúwarnings (pain)‚Äù were growing more intense.

(Judging from the intensity of the pain, this ‚Äòabnormality‚Äô probably doesn‚Äôt pose a direct threat to me or the Familia. We‚Äôre just being swept along by the current of some vast force‚Ä¶ Even I feel like that‚Äôs an incredibly vague statement, and I can‚Äôt help but sigh, but it‚Äôs better to leave it at that level of understanding for now.)

With his thoughts constrained, Finn continued making cautious speculations.

It was like groping blindly through a pitch-black maze without even a single lamp‚Äîfoolish and reckless. But fortunately, he had a compass named ‚Äúintuition‚Äù at his side.

And then, after countless abnormal trial-and-error attempts, Finn finally discovered one lead‚Äîa center to the ‚Äúincongruity.‚Äù

(The Hestia Familia‚Ä¶ and **\[Little Rookie\]‚Ä¶** Bell Cranel.)

Just by tracing the contents of the tampered materials‚Äîand the ‚Äúblanks‚Äù gouged out from his memory‚Äîhe could clearly see what had been hidden.

Before returning to this office, trying to ask around among the members (like Raul) about \[Little Rookie\] was for this very reason. At the same time, Finn also left behind a ""safeguard."" That is:

‚ÄúI‚Äôm doing a bit of a strange thought experiment right now. If I ask the same question again, tell me how many times it‚Äôs been.‚Äù

He had even given such instructions to the members (like Raul).  
Even if the current Finn were to be erased, the next ""loop"" version of himself could quickly catch up with the situation‚Äîthat was the intent behind this arrangement.

This strategy could have been inferred just from hearing Gareth's response, but Finn, who tried to resist the rules of the ‚Äúwalled garden‚Äù with minimal information, remained an outstanding individual without fault.  
At least in terms of intellect, he was so exceptional that even the white elf known as the \[White Knight (Hildrsleif)\] treated him with utmost caution.

Finn is like a certain dandy god.  
Despite being a mortal, he seeks the truth, and among the many Familia, he is perhaps the person most deserving of being called a ‚Äúthreat.‚Äù  
The proof lies in the fact that‚Äîaside from the directly affected individuals who weren‚Äôt ‚Äúcharmed‚Äù‚ÄîFinn noticed the presence of this ""abnormality"" earlier than anyone else.

He even realized it before the dandy god who had entrusted the ‚Äúpaper of resurrection‚Äù to the goddess of the forge and had fallen to the charm, became aware of the reality of the ""loop.""

However‚Äî

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the matter, Finn\~?

You just wrapped up that mountain of chaos, so why‚Äôre you looking all serious again?‚Äù

‚ÄúLoki‚Ä¶‚Äù

1kravhd,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/1kravhd/skinnyfat_to_toned/,Skinnyfat to toned?,"Hi there! 

So I've been whole foods plant based for almost a year now and although I love it, I feel like I'm not seeing the exact results physically that I'd like to see. It seems that it's so common to hear that people lose a ton of weight after going vegan, but I'm not exactly where I'd like to be. 

Before I would eat the common paleo diet, very protein-focused and vegetables, and I never really felt I saw results of that either. Then once I went plant-based, I definitely did lose weight. I notice that I am somewhat leaner, but not like I'd like to be. I don't feel totally confident in a bikini, for example.

I wonder if there's anyone who has any tips who's perhaps been in a similar position and who's gotten those results that they want to see. 
For reference, I'm a 28-year-old woman. I don't know exactly what I weigh, but probably around maybe 58 to 60 kg and I'm 165 cm.

My usual meals in a typical day include a green smoothie or oatmeal for breakfast, and the smoothie would be one banana, spinach, a few cauliflower pieces that are frozen, some soy milk, and hemp seed powder, like a tablespoon, two dates, and then in the oatmeal, it's just oatmeal with water and some blueberries and some apple on the side. And I always have around two coffees with soy milk, and that's 100% soybeans, organic, nothing else added. And then for lunch, it's usually a salad, some vegetables, chickpeas, maybe tofu. Then a piece of fruit. And then for dinner, I'll have tofu, maybe eggplants and zucchini with potatoes or rice or something. And I eat this way pretty much 90 to 95% of the time, and then sometimes I'll have, two pieces of 90% dark chocolate, or I'll even indulge in having some ice cream here and there.

I would like to add that I don't want to add protein powders etc, I prefer sticking to whole foods.
And also, I have dealt with eating disorders in the past so I'm not too keen on things like calorie counting.

1krauua,https://www.reddit.com/r/veganfitness/comments/1krauua/skinnyfat_to_toned/,Skinnyfat to toned?,"Hi there! 

So I've been whole foods plant based for almost a year now and although I love it, I feel like I'm not seeing the exact results physically that I'd like to see. It seems that it's so common to hear that people lose a ton of weight after going vegan, but I'm not exactly where I'd like to be. 

Before I would eat the common paleo diet, very protein-focused and vegetables, and I never really felt I saw results of that either. Then once I went plant-based, I definitely did lose weight. I notice that I am somewhat leaner, but not like I'd like to be. I don't feel totally confident in a bikini, for example.

I wonder if there's anyone who has any tips who's perhaps been in a similar position and who's gotten those results that they want to see.

1krats6,https://www.reddit.com/r/emetophobia/comments/1krats6/anxiety_not_getting_better_since_it_happened/,Anxiety not getting better since it happened,"So I guess this will be more of a rant than anything, I don‚Äôt want any false reassurance ( I know it‚Äôs not allowed to begin with) but some kind words or tips would be appreciated. Also I will try to censor trigger words but I can‚Äôt guarantee that everything will be 100% trigger free.

Sooo where do I start? I honestly tried to stay away from this subreddit since I felt I mainly tried to get reassurance from it and  that was contra productive in combatting my anxiety.
I was still having a lot of bad days but also saw some improvement not just regarding my emetophobia but my anxiety in general.

Well, fast forward to about a month ago: IT actually happened. Four times over 5 hours.I guess it was a bug since I also had a low grade fever and body aches but that doesn‚Äôt really matter anyway ig. While it was slightly less terrifying than I remembered/ imagined and I did feel a sense of almost pride? for doing it, it was still a shitty experience and left me quite shaken. 

The good news: After some time I was back to my base level anxiety (at least that‚Äôs what I like to call it) and it‚Äôs the same as before, I‚Äôve been able to reduce the compulsions I give into that stem from my contamination ocd and I‚Äôm still able to do so afterwards. 

Now the not so good news: I have been dealing with on and off GERD and reoccurring gastritis, which seems to be mainly triggered by stress, for around 4 years now. In the past it has definitely caused me some discomfort and anxiety but I‚Äôve mainly learned to just deal with it. 
I was pretty much symptom free since January (except for the first 2-3 days after I was sick, but I think that‚Äôs pretty normal) but now it seems to have returned with full vengeance‚Ä¶
I was visiting a friend today and I had already felt some anxiety earlier, hadn‚Äôt eaten anything except for a croissant and then decided to have an iced coffee which was probably not the best idea‚Ä¶
We came back from a walk, sat down on her bed and when I decided to lay back a bit I immediately felt stomach acid in the back of my mouth and the taste just sent me back to when I tu‚Ä¶ ended having a full blown panic attack and going home earlier. 
I haven‚Äôt had a panic attack about this since like forever but at that moment it almost felt like a flashback?! I don‚Äôt wanna compare this fear to something like PTSD but I don‚Äôt know any better words to describe what I felt, it was like I was back in that awful situation. I‚Äôm so disappointed in myself and have a hard time coping with these symptoms. 
I will definitely talk about this in my next therapy session but I honestly feel like I have to mostly work this out for myself ü´§

Sorry for the wall of text but I needed to get this off my chest, I'd be thankful for any kind of tips.

I know im semi an asshole for the way that I feel my sister in law deserves 100 percent compassion. Sadly my sister in law found out that she tested positive for breast cancer but happily in recovery now. This is where I might be the asshole. I dont feel sorry that she is having to go through this.

Okay back story. Hold on its going to be a long one. It started over 20 years ago when she started dating my brother. No my brother and I were never close but we did Tolerate each other for family dinners and major events. By the time I left for college her off handel remarks about my weight or choices for college were the normal. I didnt let it get to me but it still stung. College was better cause I would only come back home every now and then but her comments were always there along with her tricks of throwing my car keys on the roof.  Down to what I studied or who I was dating at the time. She told the family I had an Abortion when I went in for Emergency surgery to remove my galbladder. So I started to stay away more.
My parents wanted family time one year and invited everyone to the beach for a week relaxtion and just hanging out. My birthday happen to fall during the week. My parents said they had earns to run but wanted dinner out to celebrate. I was told that my brother and sister in law would tell me which resturant after I went to shower the sand away.   My sister in law took us to the restaurant and dropped my boyfriend at the time off. So she could go pick up my brother who was waiting back at the beach house. Humiliating enough, she left us there for 2 hours no one showed. And I got the joy of walking the 10 miles back. Saying I was annoying with an understatement. But it was about to get worse. I got back to all my clothes rip and torn and covered in bleach out front near the trash can. Angry we packed what was left and left before they got back from the family dinner out. I didnt respond to the 20 missed calls or text message that I got. I went back to my life away and cut off contact for a few years.

It took a awhile but everything from that time was worked out with everyone but her. I meet an amazing man and found out that we were going to have a baby a lot sooner then either one of planned but But we're thrilled about. We decided go wait for marriage until we both felt it was right. At a family bbq I was coming out of the bathroom to hear her telling people and family. I was nothing more than a whore and my child would be nothing but a bastard. I probably didnt even know who the father was. All cause he was the baby was an oops baby and she saw me talking to one of my brother best friends that didnt want anything to do with her. Shane never held back his dislike of her and even objected to their marriage when my brother popped the question. Telling him that she has been hitting on him and he caught her with another man in his truck when they were at the same party.
The many reason why I dont feel sorry for her at all is about 7 years ago my mother became Seriously sick with a rare brain tumor she was an expected to make it more than a year , but she held on 4. My now husband understood how close I was to her let me take off work to take care of her and our newborn. So I could get the time I need to just be with her. My sister-in-law did not like this. She went around to the family saying that I am being toxic because I refuse to treat my mother as being sick. I just wanted her to be my mom. Not my sick mom, just my mom. So that's how I treated her to the family. Stopped talking to me until mom God bad the last 2 weeks of her life. My sister-in-law finally stepped in even though she's an emergency nurse.  To help out they moved her into their house and sad to say it was hard. I got used to spending every day with her.And then I was told that I was not allowed to go to their house at all unless I sat there and asked two days in advance because my kids were nuisance and then need to be around her kit who were golden children. I respected their wishes because I wanted to do this for my mom.But it was the last day and my dad called and told me that I needed to come.I went and I said Goodbye.It was hard but I did it. Not even 30 minutes after my mother passed away.My sister in law  told me that it was time for me to leave.Because I was no longer needed there. With still shock on my face.I packed up my stuff told my dad i loved him and I left.  From the moment I left their house and 10 drive home. She posted on Facebook and claiming my mother only stayed strong for my brother and her only real grandkids. My kids didnt count. I kept my mouth  quiet and went on planning my mother funneral and celebration of life party. I got a text message from sister in law two days later telling me that I am no longer planning or to attend the party since it was being moved to her house. My father Cancelled the whole thing and blamed covid for it but we all knew it was cause he didnt want the drama. We took her back to the beach in private a few months later. 
I was not heartbroken when I was blocked on Facebook and other soical media stuff. 
So am I the asshole when I went for coffee and ran into a family memeber. They told me that she posted that she has cancer before when telling her husband on Facebook and all I could say is Karma was just playing the long game with her I guess.

But I actually can't find a single person taking about the biggest and best parts about the film and it's something that I feel is kind of groundbreaking and a huge deal. With the recent date of HBO Max getting the film at the end of the month it will be easier for more people to see it, so you all might be curious to know that (in my opinion) The Day The Earth Blew Up is one of the best on screen portrayals of the struggles and joys of being ADHD:



I just saw The Day The Earth Blew Up last night and I fully expected to love it, had no doubts it was going to be as so many people had dubbed it, The Greatest Looney Tunes Media Ever Made‚Äîand it was all that. But so much more. There are several angles and aspects of the film that I could go into a lot of detail on their own, there's so much about this movie that is insanely special. But I think I want to start with the most unexpected part of the film: making Daffy Duck ADHD coded and perfectly following the struggles and what is needed to find happiness. 

I'm going to be spoiling a lot of the film, all of these aspects come to a head in the climax of the story. I'm not going to give everything away, but in order to fully talk about this I'll have to go into detail about that important scene near the end. If you're already seeing it soon, hold off on reading this until later. But if you don't care of spoilers, are on the fence on if you want to see it or not, or are just really wanting to know what the heck I'm talking about, then continue on! 


The main characters of the film are Daffy and Porky, abandoned when they were young and rescued by a farmer. They grew up together, basically becoming brothers. The flashback of their childhood ends with them being left their house and they are told to stick together and take care of their home. This scene is pivotal to the whole film to such a crazy degree that it deserves its own breakdown‚Äîlater, that's for another post. Point is, the importance of the house is established and then we jump back to the present time. 

We start with Porky waking up, and things look great‚Äîhis bed and whole room is clean, well put together. They grew up and kept their promise. But...the camera pulls out and Porky's bed is only one side of the room. The other has Daffy, sleeping in a dirty looking bathtub, his whole side visibly unclean and falling apart. 

Porky informs Daffy that today is their house inspection day and they have to clean up and get things nice so they pass the inspection and get to keep the house. As he is telling him this, we see more of the state of the house, messes everywhere, stacked up dishes on every surface of the kitchen. 

I wanna take a moment to say that Daffy is never made to be the only cause of why the house looks like it does. Porky also has some irresponsible tendencies/not knowing quite how to keep things working right‚Äîbut Porky is the only one that acknowledges that things aren't great in the house and he is visibly upset sometimes, clearly wanting a cleaner environment. But even if he had his way, I still don't think it would be a completely spotless perfect home either. Porky is presented as more together as Daffy but he still isn't perfect‚Äîjust passes more easily as being ""not Looney"". 

Well, surprising no one, they fail the house inspection, and are given 10 days to fix their roof or the house will be taken from them. That sends them on a journey to find jobs to make enough money to pay for the repairs in time. 

A montage begins (presented as a Looney Tunes short within the movie, it's like twenty minutes into the film at this point and it's already incredible) showing all of their attempts at jobs that all end in being fired. What becomes clear is they are both really bad at everything...but Porky is able to hold it together and stay level headed. This is best shown when they try to work in a coffee shop. The first customer comes in and begins to list the scientific breakdown of her chosen customized coffee, and both Porky and Daffy's brains immediately get overwhelmed, but in different ways. 

Porky completely shuts down; Daffy gets mad and loud. 

Could Porky have figured it out on his own and maybe been able to make the coffee? Perhaps, but likely not. But he doesn't get a chance to try. Daffy confronts the woman, asking her what her problem is, is she even speaking English, ""What's wrong with you, this is a coffee shop!"". 

FIRED! is stamped across the screen, just one of many failed attempts at finding a job that they can manage. 

Going to skip over some details now and just vaguely say that they meet another very important character, Petunia, and they have a kinship with her immediately and she offers to find them jobs at the gum factory she works in. 

Cut to the next day, Porky and Daffy are put in front of a button and a lever. All they have to do is: Porky push, Daffy pull. The person leaving them with the job reiterates how easy it is...but ominously says that one mistake and they will be instantly fired. 

Porky is nervous. Not only is this probably the last job they can find with enough time to still be able to make enough money to fix the roof, but it's also a job that a cute girl helped him get.

Porky slowly does his part, presses the button, and Daffy immediately pulls out a mallet and is about to smash the lever. Porky jumps into action, his first time attempting to prevent Daffy from getting them fired. He grabs his hand and calmly tells him that he isn't supposed to smash the lever, but pull it. 

Understanding hits him, and he pulls it. They get into a groove of pushing and pulling that turns into a musical number that carries them through their whole shift. They have finally seen a job through to the end without disaster. 

Daffy is ecstatic as well, saying something to the effect of, ""We finally found our calling...as entry level factory workers!""

I'm gonna skip even more details to avoid spoiling as little as I can. But as the movie continues, Porky more directly begins to recognize that Daffy unintentionally causes a lot of their problems and he begins to try and minimize him. They make a plan to fight back against the aliens and Porky manipulates the situation to convince Daffy that he has to stay behind. Queue a montage of Porky and Petunia kicking ass against the aliens to the song It's The End of the World As We Know It (as one does in an animated film with this subtitle :p).

They acknowledge how great they've done and agree that they make a great team...right as Daffy has emerged from the basement, giant mallet in hand. In just the pre-fight taunting he accidentally destroys the two weapons that Porky and Petunia have that are their only way of fighting back. 

In the midst of running away, there's a moment where Porky needs to trust Daffy...but he can't. He has let him down figuratively so many times, how can he trust him to physically catch him as he jumps between two buildings? Porky's hesitation spells disaster and they are all captured. 

As the villain is revealed to them and making his showy threats, they quickly end up turning on each other, Porky's frustrations with Daffy fully revealed but Daffy also learns how Porky manipulated him to get him out of the way. They are thrown into a cage by the villain and the fighting eventually ends in tears, where they reach the beginnings of an understanding...but then things really hit the fan, and a whole new threat is revealed. 

Now, this, this is the moment where everything I thought I was seeing was confirmed. All these elements throughout of Daffy living the neurodivergent/ADHD way of being different, not knowing how to fit in, causing problems for himself and others no matter how hard he tries not to‚Äîit all comes to a head in the climax of the movie. 

They have a plan to blow something up: Petunia is going to man the lift to get them down and back up, Porky is going to set what's going to trigger the explosion...and Daffy is handed a golden gun that he used in their very first job attempt, newspaper delivery, where he used the weapon to launch a barrage of newspapers that just about destroyed the whole neighborhood. 

For a split second he is excited, he finally gets to join the fight, he is going to help save the world...but he looks at the gun again and he flashes back to the incident with the newspapers. For the first time in the entire film Daffy is visibly anxious and unsure. 

He says, ""I don't know about this‚Äîthis is an important job, what if I mess it up?"" The anxiety goes away as he makes the decision to hand the gun responsibility over to Petunia while he takes her spot at the lift...which is controlled by a lever. The one ""normal"" job he has ever been able to do. He seems fine with it, maybe even outright happy‚Äîbut Porky again hesitates. You can see that he doesn't fully agree with this, that on some level he sees what Daffy is really doing, what neurodivergent people have to do every day: find the one little slot that they can manage to fit in, relinquish everything that makes them special in order to appear ""not Looney"". 

But time is short, Porky had already hesitated once and things got worse, so he agrees. Him and Petunia ride the lift down and it's like before, perfect team, in sync, they set up everything and Daffy successfully gets them back up on the lift with no problems at all. That is, until what is supposed to set off the explosions fails. 

Everyone is freaking out, both there and in their ears from the characters helping them from afar. But Porky looks up and notices there are some really sharp hanging rocks directly above the massive hole where the explosives are set. 

""I g-got an idea! And it's a p-plan that only one person can do: Daffy Duck!"" 

His plan is to cause so much chaos that it jostles the rocks up above and falls, triggering the explosives. Daffy takes out TWO mallets and is allowed to go ""full Looney""‚Äîhe leaps down and unleashes the full destructive comedic power of a Looney Tune. 

He was given a task that made full use of what makes him different and special, and he didn't have to hold anything back. And what made this scene even more incredible is that for the first and only time in the whole film...the Looney Tunes theme swells to the forefront ü•π

Over the course of the plot of a Looney Tunes movie they presented maybe one of the best story arcs I've ever seen of the struggles of the neurodiverse, the struggles that people around them can face, and how, if given the right opportunity and direction with something that embraces their strengths and weaknesses they can do amazing things like save the whole dang world. 

And to do all of that with Looney Tunes who embody what an average person picture someone with ADHD to be like (hyper, bouncing off the walls) is such a brilliant use of the franchise to tell a story like this. 

I went into the movie fully expecting to see the greatest piece of Looney Tunes media ever but I never in a million years thought I would leave the theater kind of emotionally reeling with the unbelievable feeling that Daffy Duck is my new hero and I might need to make a shrine of him or something.

(Instead I went home and wrote this üòÇ)



So, yeah, there all that is üòÖ I've not known where to post this but I hope it can be appreciated here. I really think it's an important movie for us and I want to do what I can to get people to watch it. If you read all this, I really appreciate it! ",3,1747762160.0,AutisticWithADHD,0,1.0,False

1kraq4b,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1kraq4b/i_had_a_chat_with_my_father/,I had a chat with my father‚Ä¶,"I‚Äôm an 18-year-old girl‚Äîturning 19 soon‚Äîwho was raised in a home where cursing wasn‚Äôt just a habit; it was embedded in our way of being. It wasn‚Äôt considered rude‚Äîit was simply part of us. I grew up in a household that was both toxic and loving. For the most part, my grandfather was the one who raised me and my older sister. But now, he‚Äôs gone‚Äîhe‚Äôs with God. And the moment he left, I lost a piece of myself. My world felt smaller, and every day since has felt unbearably heavy.

That left only our father to care for us physically, while our mother worked overseas to support us financially. Nothing felt stable. My dad spiraled further into drinking and smoking after my grandfather died. I was only 15, just starting to understand the world, yet I couldn‚Äôt seem to process what was happening.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a dream,‚Äù I kept telling myself. But reality eventually caught up with me. Over time, I started seeing changes. The man who was always out drinking and smoking slowly began working harder‚Äîto feed us, pay the bills, and even try to meet some of our wants. I began to see his efforts. Still, it was difficult to erase the pain left by his past actions‚Äîespecially his violent moments.

Just earlier, we talked on the phone. I thought he was going to ask for help using a delivery app because, apparently, he was about to order coffee. ‚ÄúI make better coffee than them,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúI have chest pains. I need treatments and procedures done. Will I ever taste your delicious coffee?‚Äù

My heart dropped. I instantly lost my appetite for the Hungarian sausage I was eating. I asked, ‚ÄúHow is your health?‚Äù But instead of answering, he said:

‚ÄúWe have no money. So we‚Äôll just wait on what happens next.‚Äù

That shattered me. The tears came before I realized it, as more messages from him followed.

‚ÄúBe patient and study well. So you can take care of yourself in the future.‚Äù
‚ÄúSave up money if needed.‚Äù
‚ÄúThink about what you need and what you want.‚Äù
‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to be on the latest trend. You don‚Äôt have to show off.‚Äù
‚ÄúJust live.‚Äù
‚ÄúIf I were to rest‚Äîbring me to the tomb of my parents.‚Äù
‚ÄúAll my things here‚Äîyou will sell it. So you‚Äôll have a little bit of cash with you.‚Äù
‚ÄúNo one will help you other than yourself. And only the two of you will help each other.‚Äù
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why‚Äîlive a good life. Only you get to choose your own. You won‚Äôt be able to depend on others. We won‚Äôt be here forever.‚Äù

I know he was preparing me for the worst‚Äîbut the emotional weight of it all hit me like a wave. I wasn‚Äôt ready. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever be. He may be misunderstood or judged by others, but only we truly know the kind of father he‚Äôs been to me.

1krapi9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/1krapi9/differences_between_dating_american_and_british/,Differences between dating American and British men (I‚Äôm British). This is a train post.. sorry for the rambling.,"So, from 2014-2021ish I was in a long distance relationship with a Californian man. He was attentive, sweet, funny and hot. After meeting in a bar in Seattle we hit it off and everything just evolved naturally. It was actually pretty great. We had a lot of awesome trips together and spoke every day for most of that time.. but I think deep down I knew I‚Äôd never leave to be with him and although he never said it - I knew he‚Äôd never leave California to live in the UK with me and part of me didn‚Äôt want the pressure of him giving up his entire life for me. 

We both let the relationship go on for too long but we did love each other and I don‚Äôt think either of us was ready to give that up. We never really had a formal split, he was having a tough time with his mental health and we both started giving each other ‚Äúspace‚Äù that eventually turned into a lot of space. Obviously not being able to travel because of Covid made reality hit home. Anyway, occasionally I‚Äôll have a message from him seeming like he wants to explain what happened to which I respond saying he doesn‚Äôt have to explain anything if he doesn‚Äôt want to‚Ä¶ neither of us was being particularly practical and I have nothing but love for him. He may have just met someone else and I truly am at peace with that.. proximity is important! I get it!

Do not ask me why (I don‚Äôt know why) but prior to this I‚Äôd also met other American men while traveling and just kind of hit it off with them (didn‚Äôt meet them America‚Ä¶ Ireland/Nepal) and hooked up and kind of kept in touch with them/visited.

So‚Ä¶ since 2021 I‚Äôve had stuff going on, my Dad developed Dementia and I travel up and down the UK to help my mum care for him (alternate weeks so I‚Äôm kind of living in two places at once). He‚Äôs late stage and has been entirely bedbound for over a year now (I adore him, he‚Äôs still so sweet and loving) so this might not be going on for much longer. My Mum is younger and healthy (touch wood) and when my Dad isn‚Äôt around I think she‚Äôll want to travel and come and stay with me for extended periods. 

I‚Äôve had some health concerns of my own and have focused on my wellbeing and happiness in myself as much as possible. I haven‚Äôt really prioritised meeting anyone and generally have been happy with the few good friends I have. My sister is in Australia so sometimes I do feel a little bit remote from the world but I think that happens to many of us whose friends are focusing on their kids/partners.. but I know that‚Äôs not always as perfect as it looks from the outside, I don‚Äôt put other people‚Äôs live on pedestals. I‚Äôm really close to my parents and as brutal as it sounds, I do worry about how I‚Äôll respond when they‚Äôre no longer around (specifically my mum) - so I‚Äôve started putting the feelers out to consider if I‚Äôd like to be in a relationship or maybe just date people.. work out what I want. Christ though‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs TOUGH since I last met someone‚Ä¶

I don‚Äôt (or didn‚Äôt) seem to have a problem meeting American men organically‚Ä¶ is that because I‚Äôve been something ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù for them I wonder (even though they‚Äôve all been from big cities and have been well travelled) am I just too ordinary for British men?‚Ä¶ am I more confident around American men?.. are American men generally more likely to chat in bars/coffee shops etc?

Any British/American ladies out there that can summarise how different it is dating British/American men because they are SO different in my experience. I know that just because I‚Äôve dated a handful of Americans doesn‚Äôt mean that all Americans are the same but things have always just seems so much easier with them‚Ä¶ they‚Äôve been more communicative, considerate etc etc‚Ä¶ maybe I just met someone really good ones‚Ä¶ especially the long-term one. 

What‚Äôs odd is.. I generally am more instantly attracted to British men but they just seem to make less effort eventually in my experience and turn a bit shit. Again.. maybe I‚Äôve just met the shit ones üòÇ

OR‚Ä¶ and this is what I think might be the case‚Ä¶ did Covid/Tinder just fuck everything up in the dating world since I was last ‚Äúon the market‚Äù

1kranwx,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1kranwx/i_30f_am_starting_to_fall_for_someone_other_than/,I (30F) am starting to fall for someone other than my boyfriend (28M) and I don't know what to do - is this cheating?,"throwaway account because I don't want any of my family to see this. 

So I (30F) have been in a relationship with my boyfriend (28M) for just under 6 years now - let's call him James - we met back when he was in his last year of college, and we generally had a pretty good loving relationship - until recently. For context, he is an actor and performer. Around last year, one of his jobs fell through, and he fell into somewhat of a deep depression - he would barely talk to me and would mostly just self-isolate and not interact with me. Now I have experienced my fair share of mental health struggles which he has supported me through and so I know what it's like to feel like the world is against you and you have no energy to do anything - so i stuck by him and I tried to do everything I could to help him. I gave him space when he needed it and a shoulder to cry on - I tried making him laugh more and doing activities that I knew he liked, I reconnected to some of our old friends so that maybe he could have some community around him to not feel completely alone - I tried. 

But none of it worked to a large extent - most days he would just self isolate while I tried to get him to talk, sometimes we'd go out for a drink but he wouldn't really talk to me and wouldn't order much food just alcohol, and we'd go home and he'd go to sleep early. He never talked to me, no matter how hard I tried to help him or get him to open up; he just locked himself away from the world completely. But still, I persisted because I wanted to be with him. That is until the fight happened - I won't give away too much because a lot of this is extremely hyper-personal - but just for context, it ended in him calling me an attention seeker and saying, quote, 'Why would I even want to marry you?' 

Now I will admit, this stung and made me pretty pissed off. He knew how much marriage meant to me and how much I had tried over the past year to help him. We had had fights regarding marriage and commitment in the past but he had never said something like this. Now I will admit, I didn't handle my anger in the best way and for the few days we basically didn't talk to each other at all.  

I do want to make it extremely clear that the issue was not his mental health struggles, it was specifically his lack of communication and neglect. I genueinly have never felt more alone than I did over the past year. A part of me wanted to walk out in the beginning, but I didn't. Because I didn't want to throw away a 6 year relationship because of what I thought at the time was just gonna be a bad phase. 

Here's where it starts to get messy. So about 2 months ago, - I started a new job and I met someone from my past. Let's call him Liam - me and Liam had known each other back in college, and we had had a weird situation thing - we never officially dated or anything, but we never really were platonic either. We had gone out on exactly 2 dates before he blew me off, and we never really talked much after that - until now. Turns out that Liam had been working at this company for quite a few years and he seemed surprised to see me. Over the next month Liam and I started hanging out casually - very casual co-worker stuff like going out for lunch together, post work bar trips with other colleagues of ours, and the occasional coffee here and there. However, i would be lying if I told you I wasn't charmed by him. He was an incredibly charming man, he was funny, he listend to me, he payed attention, he reminded me of an older version of James - a version I perhaps missed. Context - me and James haven't properly had a sit down conversation or date night since the fight in last november. the past few months it has felt like walking on eggshells around him - we haven't had sex in over 9 months - and  the last time i think we both actually had fun and I saw him properly smile was in February when we were at a friend's birthday and playing charades - that was the last good night we had. Ever since then it just hasn't been the same and honestly the only reason why I haven't broken up with him yet is that there's still a part of me which wants him to change and get better - but I'm starting to realise that might not happen - and for those who ask - yes I did recommend we start therapy together -but he was the one who said no and that he doesn't feel comfortable. 

Long story short - I caught feelings - or at least I'm catching feelings for Liam and i honestly don't know what to do. I feel like I'm at war with myself. For context, I haven't always been the best with relationships - I was pretty flaky in my early 20s and James is the one partner of mine who I've felt actually secure with for over a long period, all my family knows him, half of my friends were his initially, and our lives are so intertwined that i'm scared to let go. At the same time, this relationship feels like beating a dead horse at this point and it's started to feel more like confinement than anything else, like we're just together for the sake of being together (and yes i have tried to talk to him about this but the last time i did it ended in an argument so I didn't bring it up again) and not because we love each other.

I also have a very complicated relationship with cheating, I was cheated on multiple times in the past in my early relationships adn that defintley left a scar on me - and it's something james has said that I'm always jealous - and for a long time, I never saw myself as the girl who cheated on someone. I never thought I would be in this situation. I tried talking to a group of my best friends about it and I got mixed results - one of my friends said that because  Liam and I haven't kissed yet or anything - the most he's done is give me a long hug after I cried to him about a family situation - and we haven't been close to sleeping with each other, I haven't really cheated on him and i have nothing to feel gulity about - however, another close friend of mine said that even though I haven't physically done anything - I have emotionally cheated on him since I have feelings for someone else other than my partner. But then my other friend counterargued her and said that emotional cheating isn't really cheating and that 'she can't help how she feels' - so i honestly don't know what to anymore.

So that's why i came to reddit - asking for relationship advice on where to go next and all - also to ask if what i've done counts as cheating or not  ",0,1747761837.0,relationship_advice,15,0.5,False
1kranm4,https://www.reddit.com/r/FellowProducts/comments/1kranm4/anyone_else_finds_their_fellow_gen_2_grinder/,Anyone else finds their Fellow Gen 2 grinder grind size so inconsistent ?,"Hi All! So i have been making both espresso and pourovers for about 25 years. Use many different brewers espresso machines grinders etc.
But I'm finding for some reason that with my fellow Gen2 SSP-MP burrs must be incredibly inconsistent grind size. I do not jump all over the dial, so I'm not going really any more than 3 or 4 different settings. And they're all close to the same range. I've been using my Orea brewer w/ 30g, and I use the same exact coffee with the same exact temperature with the same exact grind size for only that particular coffee and the exact poor style, beans are Single vacuum seal bags in the freezer from the machine. There's just no way that my coffee can be that off day to day. In other words,yesterday that coffee We'll be insanely good and the day before, but then today horrifying,tasting terrible. Since everything is exactly the same and the coffee is not aging much and i have pored really good brews the only thing I could think of is that there are too many fines mixing in ?? After using it every morning, I clear it out to Make sure nothing is stuck in it after every usage and it's all only is used 2X a day And yes, I do water droplet Treatment when putting in my beans very slowly like I said, nothing has changed .Then how can it be that bad or so different from day to day in the week? And please don't mention that it is humidity.I also check about three weeks ago my burrs after cleaning and calibrating again And they're all fine, it needs no adjusting. So I checked the grind Size on an .8 than an .7 and wouldn't you know it The .8 was actually looked a bit finer. than the 7. I could not believe it. So my question to you is honestly, is anybody else having problems with they're grind? Size being inconsistent ?? I'm looking to buy another one, but I'm petrified. I look at the time more, but i'm afraid that it might be too close to the fellow.  Being that maybe the motor is not powerful enough ? I don't want a remake of a grinder. That just keeps putting another name on it. And I looked into like the bent wood, but that thing is enormous and I'm not making enough coffee like a coffee shop. Or the option grinders seem awfully familiar to the other ones. It really are in the same category, but maybe a tad better. I mean, if i'm gonna spend fifteen hundred I might as well spend twenty two hundred if it's that much difference in quality.Although it seems you either get one, that is commercial for it to be actually accurate, or you're spending five hundred less and getting junk and having the same problems. Please give me your advice. I'm really needing it. Thank you well in advance.",1,1747761818.0,FellowProducts,1,1.0,False

throwaway for anonymity.
This is about Industry Apartments in Downtown Columbus (Harbor Group Living)
I would never in a million years recommend this place to someone.
- They charged exorbitant amenity fees that changed based off of resident population (my amenity fees went up $100 from when I moved in to moving out)
- They slip hidden fees in whenever they can. It‚Äôs not 1200 rent, by the time you‚Äôre done paying feeds (especially if you require parking) you‚Äôre looking at 1600-1700. 
- The area around is unsafe, witnessed 2 shootings from my window at the local club and the safety measurements are abysmal. Residents letting strangers in, strangers tearing up public areas, homeless individuals using the dog shower, doors not properly locking, garage doors not closing (my car was broken into twice).
- residents are just plain trashy. the whole place smells like dog/cat waste, but they won‚Äôt show you those floors. residents do NOT clean up after themselves, saw throw-up, trash, and drug waste throughout the public areas. residents throw trash out their windows and the whole place constantly smells of weed. 
- the place is dirty. everything is dirty. general amenities can be unavailable randomly. coffee machine is constantly broken, the vending machines steal your money, and nobody cleans up after their pets.
- you CANNOT BREAK YOUR LEASE WITHOUT PAYING AN ARM AND A LEG. do NOT live here. 
- your amenities will cost insane amounts because nobody wants to live there and they reallocate funds based off of that. 
- the concierge is NEVER at her post and when she is, she is unsociable and doesn‚Äôt seem to have any answers for anything, despite all residents paying her 80 something dollars a month.
- they will lie straight to your face. the place is not safe, its dirty, residents are trashy. do NOT live in any industry apartment affiliate (harbor group living) you‚Äôd be better off at the Normandy across the street. 

I can take PM inquired about this as well. Do NOT move in to this apartment oh my god. I cannot stress this enough it was abysmal, dirty, and overpriced to the nines.

I‚Äôm 35 and recently went through an unexpected pregnancy, which sadly ended in abortion due to personal circumstances and the end of my relationship. It was a very emotional experience, but it made me realize how much I want to preserve my fertility and eventually become a mother ‚Äî with the right partner by my side.

My AMH is very low and my FSH is high. I don‚Äôt have many follicles, but I‚Äôm doing everything I can to support my body and keep my eggs as healthy as possible for the future.

I tried egg freezing before, but I had a very poor response to stimulation medication and was only able to freeze one egg. It was a tough experience and I‚Äôm not sure I want to go through it again. Still, knowing I was recently able to get pregnant naturally gives me hope ‚Äî so I‚Äôm trying to preserve that chance. I‚Äôm also considering preparing my body for another round of egg freezing, hoping for better results next time.

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm currently doing:

Supplements I take:
	‚Ä¢	Coenzyme Q10 (200mg)
	‚Ä¢	Vitamin D3
	‚Ä¢	Vitamin B12
	‚Ä¢	Methylfolate (B9)
	‚Ä¢	Zinc
	‚Ä¢	Selenium
	‚Ä¢	Vitamin E
	‚Ä¢	L-carnitine
	‚Ä¢	L-arginine
	‚Ä¢	Magnesium (bisglycinate)
	‚Ä¢	Omega-3
	‚Ä¢	Ground flaxseed
	‚Ä¢	Wheatgrass powder

Diet:
	‚Ä¢	Mostly low-carb / anti-inflammatory
	‚Ä¢	Lots of salmon, spinach, berries, nuts, olive oil
	‚Ä¢	Pomegranate juice
	‚Ä¢	Little to no alcohol
	‚Ä¢	One cup of coffee per day

Lifestyle:
	‚Ä¢	Regular walking and light workouts
	‚Ä¢	Trying to avoid stress and stay emotionally balanced

I‚Äôd really appreciate it if anyone here could share what else helped them ‚Äî supplements, lifestyle habits, any success stories with low AMH/high FSH, or even just encouragement. I‚Äôm open to trying things that are backed by science or strong anecdotal evidence.

Thank you so much in advance!

1krakbj,https://www.reddit.com/r/MuslimMarriage/comments/1krakbj/is_there_anyway_to_change_my_husband_or_is_it_a/,Is there anyway to change my husband or is it a lost cause?,"So here is the link to my previous post:
https://www.reddit.com/r/MuslimMarriage/comments/1k9zu8d/comment/mq098la/?context=3

Update on that situation. I came home in my schedule day and my husband was giggling when I asked why he ignored me. It then turned into a bigger argument, and he ended up doing the silent treatment for like three days. He then came to his senses and broke the silence to talk to me first.

We moved on. However, it's been three weeks and it's the same thing again. I work full time and had a three day weekend this week. He asked me the day before what I planned on doing since he was working those days. I let him know that I had to get blood work done, take my clothes to the dry cleaners, and return some items. He told me it was okay to do so. 


The next day, I let him know before I left that I was going to start my errands. I left around 10:30 am. I took my clothes to the cleaner and afterwards to my blood work. The blood work took much longer due to the wait, so afterwards I started getting anxious that my husband would get upset. Because when I go out it's only for about 2-3 hours top. I ended up not returning the items I needed to do,  and just grabbed coffee and food and went home. 

On my way home my husband texted me to check how things were going (he never text me to check on me on a regular day). I told him I finished my blood work and was on my way home right now. 

He told me that was good, and if I did everything I needed to do. I told him that I was done for the day and would be home. They was around 11:45 am. 

I spent the remainder of the day home, cooked and cleaned etc. well my husband comes home and he's in a pissy mood. He is responding to me and will adress me as ""babe"". But he's not asking me about my day and is just being extremely quiet. He said he's tired and I just took him at his word for it. Well it's been 5 days now and he's in still in this ""mood"". Not interacting with me unless I interact with him. 

I feel so suffocated. I don't know if this is normal. He keeps telling me that the girls from our home country (he was born there and I wasn't) would never go out like I do.

And that hurts me, because he knew who he was marrying beforehand. And also I feel like what I want to do is not abnormal. 

I ideally would like to go out once each two week. Catch up with friends ( I only have Muslim girl friends)  or join a Muslim girl exercise club (I already found one)or just enjoy browsing  a home store and doing girly things.

But I feel like to go anywhere even for an hour is a huge problem. Even if my husband says it's okay he throws a fit later. He will get antsy if I'm gone longer than an hour and message me to know what's going on.

I can't even buy clothes or items in person now because he makes it a big deal if I'm gone shopping. So if I want anything I have to order it online, but if i want to return it I have to use up my ""one time getting fresh air for that"" and can't do anything else for that day. Example if i want to return an item but also want to go on a walk. I can only pick one and make that my ""outing for the day"" but even then my husband will still get pissy if I do either. But will turn it to a huge problem/ argument if I do both on the same day. 

This makes getting fresh air extremely hard and getting things done especially when I have  multiple errands to do practically impossible.  and he will basically say im a ""street girl"" even though I've always returned before 1 pm and will have the house cleaned and food ready on the table before he comes back. 

I don't know what to do and it's making me depressed. Am I crazy for wanting/expecting that I should be able to socialize without him throwing a tantrum? 

To make things worse our weekends don't align, so it's not like he can take me out for fresh air. But if they do, he says he wants to spend his day resting. Or he will complain the entire time that we go out so it's not enjoyable at all. 


I really don't know what to do. Has anyone experience something similar with their spouse? Were they able to change him? How do you manage someone like this?

1kraj8b,https://www.reddit.com/r/GenX/comments/1kraj8b/my_parents_refuse_to_talk_about_aging_planning/,My parents refuse to talk about aging planning,"Mom is 77; Dad is almost 80. They are among the lucky ones who are healthy and energetic enough that they are still living independently, enjoying community activities, volunteering, and some traveling, engaged with their grandchildren and great-grandchildren, and basically just enjoying themselves. They have modest but sufficient retirement funding to be comfortable.

To be clear, I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs wrong. I am really happy for them and glad to see them relaxing and enjoying life. 

However, every single time I bring up anything related to planning for the future, they change the subject or simply pretend they can‚Äôt hear me. 

For example, we were visiting last weekend over breakfast, and they were telling me about some plans they have to update their kitchen and bathroom, which are basically straight out of the 1930s. (Not kidding.) They have a first floor bedroom and bath, but just a tub (no shower). 

They are firm that they will not move. They have been in this house 50+ years. Pre-pandemic, I asked them to consider where they wanted to live as they aged, maybe closer to their children or in a more accessible home. They considered other options, but abruptly shut down the conversation a few years ago and decided on staying put.

So in our conversation last weekend, I simply asked if they were incorporating accessibility standards in their new kitchen/bath design. My dad got up abruptly for a coffee refill, and my mom said, ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt want to talk about aging.‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúWell, my siblings and I need you to.‚Äù But she made it clear that she doesn‚Äôt want me to bring it up again. It stresses them out. 

But their unwillingness to discuss it is stressing me out.

So what now?

I know they have a will and estate set up. Not sure about medical proxy. I think I have digital access and can read those documents. I plan to do that. Also, they‚Äôre doing a pretty good job of decluttering, after dealing with their own parents‚Äô Depression-era hoarding.

But aside from all that, I mostly hope we can avoid a situation where decisions have to be made for them because they stuck their heads in the sand instead of planning ahead and communicating (and hopefully financing) their wishes. 

I know at their age, one‚Äôs ability to be independent can change overnight. 

At the same time, I see the psychological comfort in their denial of such things.

My siblings and I don‚Äôt have financial resources or flexibility to help with unexpected changes. I live a few hours away and won‚Äôt be able to help regularly or on the fly.

My question here is not about what *they* should be planning or doing. My question is, how can *I* break through their denial in a respectful and productive way, and what is *my* responsibility if they continue to refuse to talk about it and something happens that they haven‚Äôt planned for? As the eldest child, this is making me really anxious.

So i have been making both espresso and pourovers for about 25 years. Use many different brewers espresso machines grinders etc.
But I'm finding for some reason that with my fellow Gen2 SSP-MP burrs must be incredibly inconsistent grind size. I do not jump all over the dial, so I'm not going really any more than 3 or 4 different settings. And they're all close to the same range. I've been using my Orea brewer w/ 30g, and I use the same exact coffee with the same exact temperature with the same exact grind size for only that particular coffee and the exact poor style, beans are Single vacuum seal bags in the freezer from the machine. There's just no way that my coffee can be that off day to day. In other words,yesterday that coffee We'll be insanely good and the day before, but then today horrifying,tasting terrible. Since everything is exactly the same and the coffee is not aging much and i have pored really good brews the only thing I could think of is that there are too many fines mixing in ?? After using it every morning, I clear it out to Make sure nothing is stuck in it after every usage and it's all only is used 2X a day And yes, I do water droplet Treatment when putting in my beans very slowly like I said, nothing has changed .Then how can it be that bad or so different from day to day in the week? And please don't mention that it is humidity.I also check about three weeks ago my burrs after cleaning and calibrating again And they're all fine, it needs no adjusting. So I checked the grind Size on an .8 than an .7 and wouldn't you know it The .8 was actually looked a bit finer. than the 7. I could not believe it. So my question to you is honestly, is anybody else having problems with they're grind? Size being inconsistent ?? I'm looking to buy another one, but I'm petrified. I look at the time more, but i'm afraid that it might be too close to the fellow.  Being that maybe the motor is not powerful enough ? I don't want a remake of a grinder. That just keeps putting another name on it. And I looked into like the bent wood, but that thing is enormous and I'm not making enough coffee like a coffee shop. Or the option grinders seem awfully familiar to the other ones. It really are in the same category, but maybe a tad better. I mean, if i'm gonna spend fifteen hundred I might as well spend twenty two hundred if it's that much difference in quality.Although it seems you either get one, that is commercial for it to be actually accurate, or you're spending five hundred less and getting junk and having the same problems.

we just had coffee and currently im thinking about a lot of things. Financial, Orgs, Academically, Socially, and our relationship. I think u have an idea na on the things that i will tell u, starting to with how i fall in love with someone like him.

It‚Äôs something that started way back when me and him first met, it‚Äôs a busy day and the crowd is having fun. the clock is ticking like a bomb because of my restriction and seeing that person is like a freedom. i had to forget my own desires for me to move forward, for me to stay, and for me to build who i am rn. 

after every steps of moving forward is the same time i was drowning myself on my own sacrifices, not for him but for something better. every day i thought i was doing better, i am, but it‚Äôs just different rn. having him rn by my side, taking every chances just to make a moment of memories with him. 

it‚Äôs like a storm, everything is too much. but having him is a comfort, sunlight, and pahinga. being scared of the thought of him having an idea of trying, doing everything just for him to think it‚Äôs just for the friendship. deep inside it‚Äôs something i want to deepen. 

i hope you have now an idea that‚Äôs being him is being you. it‚Äôs time for me to move forward not with our friendship but for my feelings. 

i want to tell you that ‚Äúkung meron kang sila, meron kang ako. kung wala kang sila, meron kang ako.‚Äù i will be your shoulders when your sleepy or tired. i will be your coffee when things is not doing good. i will be your escape when everything is too much. i will be here always waiting for you when you will need me or not.  

having u with me is fun. everything feels soft and warm. it‚Äôs you, the one that makes me soft and weak. the way every time we will share a memory hoping i hold your fingertips, you will put your head on my shoulders, or i will mess your hair. it‚Äôs something makes me happy even it scared me. 

u are a person that easy to love. the fem side of yours makes me want to hug and just put u on my pocket and ur masc side that makes me feel safe and comfortable. ur a mixture of both worlds that i truly love. 

u did everything that makes me smile. i enjoy reading and understanding who you are. thank you for sharing a memory with me, for now i will try to move forward. for now, wala kang ako, pero alam kong meron kang sila. maybe see you in the next few days? weeks? months? years? when time is healed, when the ocean is calm, and the streets is not crowded anymore.",1,1747761428.0,PinoyUnsentLetters,1,1.0,False

Ello ello, I'm Lewis, 30M and from the UK.

I'll try and keep it short and sweet. Unlike me, I'm your typical tall skinny white guy.

I'm on the search for a new bestie to join me on this journey called life. Someone to share the day with, build a connection, have some fun, live love laugh toaster bath. I'm interested in investing in something long term with someone who we can be out silly selves.

I've come out of a long term relationship a while back and kind of missing that close connection with someone. I'm not looking for anything romantic, but I am looking for someone who wants a deeply connected friendship.

This isn't for everyone but ideally I'm looking for someone kind of clingy. Someone who wants to talk all day, checks their phone for messages from each other, doesn't care about stuff like double messaging or spamming the hell out of each other. Someone to get excited to check your phone for.

I'm like an onion. Peel back the layers to find out what's underneath. Try not to cry while you do it. I like my humour how I like my coffee, dark.

Some stuff about me so you know I'm not a blank slate ready to get smashed to death by the hammer of life:

- Recently started the gym. About time I started taking better care of myself. I need someone to hold me accountable!
- When I leave the house I like to cycle, hike explore and occasionally socialise with the unlucky sods I call friends.
- Heavy metal fan - You'll sometimes find me ar a concert/gig with the above mentioned friends. Bloodstock 2025!
- I play games. Currently playing POE2 but was obsessed with Satisfsctory the past two months. You'll usually find me AFKing on OSRS.
- I've been creating an android game for the past year or so in my spare time. Programming is hard at times but very rewarding. 
- I also have a 5 year old daughter with my ex. Would be great to connect with other parents.

What I'm looking for in you:
- Age 21-40 - Not opposed to people outside this range but Ideally I'm looking for people around my age
- We don't need 100% compatibility on hobbies/likes, just show interest.
- Timezones don't matter. I work a crazy schedule
- Wanting to be supportive of each other and push each other
- Can hold a conversation and willing to put the effort in.
- Silly/chaotic vibes preferred

I literally sometimes want to write to Jared about himself, because to me this all seems so obvious, but I think I'm the only one who sees him this way? (I have been listening to him since the beginning, and briefly texted with him in like 2017.)

TAKE: I think he suffers from internalized townie basic, the way that some women suffer internalized misogyny.   
  
I have observed that he's a lot more ""punk rock"" than he presents, and perhaps even considers himself to be, which is honestly really refreshing and rad to listen to him clearly coming to his own excellent conclusions about some things! (eg.  he leans toward socialism, but insists on calling himself a ""capitalist"" in the small business sense)    
  
A lot of people (including Jared) have/had a problem philosophically understanding the type of partnership that is based in personal growth and not standard relationship milestones like marriage and kids.   
And I think that's who Jared actually is: someone who doesn't want the standard life but doesn't know what else to do and how to make it up as he goes. This is where he needs a woman to take the lead. (My man didn't have any idea about how he wanted his life to go, but he's really happy with what I've mapped out!)   
He wants a partner to do things with, and he used to have a phrase for this a few years ago... ""A Companion"" I think he would call it on the air, sometimes with a mocking tone in response to a woman who would want a committed dependable date and sex partner, but not a ""boyfriend"".  Usually ""boyfriend"" insinuates this kind of step-by-step growth that is not wanted in these cases, so they don't want to use the word, and he used to roll his eyes at that.   
He needs someone who is independent and has the flexibility to go on his adventures, which is not something you can do with an office job  or while pursuing a degree, or with a desire to be child-focused.  I don't think he's ever going to have kids because he's too old for his own dating math, unless he meets a woman who has frozen her eggs? Kids never seemed like a priority for him, and neither does marriage. That's the societal expectation talking.   
  
Two things I actually don't think are a problem are his mom and his desired physical attributes.   
He'll find someone who is familiar with his type of family (I am! I \*love\* hearing about it, I relate SO HARD. His mom is like my aunt.) (I find my man's family kind of boring and character-free.)   
I think he'll find a dark haired curve model! I think he needs a woman that is more ""alternative"" (more Megan Fox than Kim Kardashian) He might even be afraid that she's too different for his mom. (I don't think his mom is that judgmental of appearances, he's never mentioned it.) (She's also never mentioned wanting grandkids too badly either, right?)  
  
Someone on another thread mentioned that he seems like he has ADHD and that seems true to me as well, as far as the lack of oomph about his dating followthrough. The joy of it is, that when he meets the right woman, she'll become a hyperfixation. =)

Hindi na talaga namin maiwasan ‚Äòto, it‚Äôs like a routine. Then after a few minutes, we‚Äôll just talk like we both didn‚Äôt almost crash out.

I offered her to stay in province for her own good because of the pollution here, and considering she‚Äôs a housewife. All her favorite people are there in province, where everyone knows everybody‚Äî it‚Äôs her people, her family. But then I also told her how suffocated I get living with them. It feels pointless to stay with them when I want to learn independence, yet I feel caged with them.

‚ÄúWala naman akong ginagawa sa‚Äôyo, bakit lagi kang galit sa‚Äôkin?‚Äù

‚ÄúYun na nga e, wala ka, o kayong ginagawa. Pero I grew up full of criticism at pangongontrol niyo sa buhay ko. You expect me to learn everything by myself, but never have I even known in my 24 years of existence that there was a misspelling in my name from the birth cert. All you did was shelter me in, feed me, make sure I‚Äôm put. I want out.‚Äù

‚ÄúHindi namin na alam bakit iba yung nasa birth certificate mo. Hindi na rin namin pinaayos kasi mahabang proseso ‚Äòyon eh andyan naman yung kaibigan ng papa mo. Wala naman naging problema ah. Gusto ko lang din makasigurado na okay ka.‚Äù

She is such a gaslighter. Does she think I‚Äôm that dumb? She‚Äôs always like that, always dismissive and tries to manipulate the truth. But she raised me, I know when she can‚Äôt look at me.

‚ÄúThat single mistake na pinatagal niyo is a big fucking deal to me. And I get it, it‚Äôs really okay to check up on me. But every fucking day, you call me at least three times. When I don‚Äôt pick up, you get upset. Do you know what it does to me? You give me anxiety. Tapos magtataka ka bakit lumaki akong ganito?‚Äù

‚ÄúWala ka nang paki samin. You don‚Äôt even call your father.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you know why I stopped kissing your cheek since I got in high school? Cause I realized I can‚Äôt stay with you anymore. I learned how to stop relying on you. I don‚Äôt wanna get hurt when I finally physically get away. I don‚Äôt want to miss you. This is a trauma bond & I am so sick of it.‚Äù

Gusto ko nang umiyak, pero mas umiiral yung sama ng loob ko‚Äî mainly to myself. I hate hurting her, but I‚Äôm angry and I can‚Äôt control my anger. Kung saan-saan na napunta yung argument namin. From feeling suffocated, to how I grew up, and shaming those relatives who always have a say, etc.

‚ÄúLook, the point is, you have to let me go. You can‚Äôt keep doing this to me. I know you‚Äôre trying your best fo care for me and love me sa paraang alam mo, pero hindi ibig sabihin non lalaki ako sa paraang gusto mo. May sarili akong paniniwala at pag-iisip. Wala ka nang magagawa ron.‚Äù

It‚Äôs all so similar to my childhood when she would compensate her actions after putting me on a sack for accidentally spilling her coffee, making me apologize‚Äî telling me she just doesn‚Äôt want me to make mistakes and it‚Äôs for my own good, then cook me a meal, habang sinisinok pa ako sa pag-iyak.

I'm feeling like I've moved on from my ex and I am slowy starting to take interest into other women again.

Two weeks ago I ran into an old co-worker (27F) from about 10 years ago, it was one of my first jobs. We worked together for a few years. We talked for about 2 minutes before she had to move on. The next day I decided to message her, asking if she wanted to catch up over coffee. She declined in a polite way, saying she didn't want me to get the wrong expectations, which to me sounds like she wasn't interested in exploring if anything romantic was possible, which of course was my motive. We messaged a bit more and then it was done. For me this was completely fine, she was nice and respectful all the time and I didn't think about it anymore once we stopped messaging.

Last weekend I ran into another girl (28F) I've known for a few years. We were in a bar I also used to work at. She came to me, sat down next to me. I bought her a drink and we talked for about 15 minutes. She then went outside with her friend to go smoke. My friends and I were going home by then. Jusy before we left, I decided to ask her if she wanted to meet-up later this week. She agreed and I said I would message her tomorrow about the details, since I already had her number for reasons unknown to us both haha. I must say we both had a few beers and wine when we agreed to this.

When I got home I decided to message her right away. I messaged her that it was interesting to talk to her, we would talk about the details tomorrow and wished her goodnight. There was no response. The next day, about halfway in the afternoon I messaged her again, asking if she still stood behind the idea of meeting up. She ignored me for a few hours and in the evening she answered: ""Hey, I dont think it was such a good idea after all"". I answerd that this was fine and that the alcohol probably played a role in our agreement the night before. She did not respond to that and the conversation stopped.

But for some weird reason this one has been stuck in my head the past few days. I feel so embarrassed and insecure after this second rejection. I'm scared she'll tell my ex co-workers (some of which are still my friends) or other people I know at the bar about how I asked her out and she doesnt want it etc. Do you guys have any advice about how to feel less insecure about rejection? Is it my way of approaching women? Should I do a bit more ""talking-phase"" with a woman before asking her out?

Sometimes I‚Äôm just tired or in a bad mood for reasons that have nothing to do with her ‚Äî and even when it is about her, I‚Äôm generally careful about what I choose to talk about. 

I believe some things just don‚Äôt need to be talked through ‚Äî (example coming later in the post) ‚Äî and sometimes it‚Äôs better for me to take a bit of distance and get through it on my own without opening a whole discussion.
In any case, she takes it personally and spirals.

This all started a few days ago when we hosted one of her friends. I‚Äôm a pretty introverted guy ‚Äî polite and sociable enough, but I never fully relax when there are guests. I slept on the couch, didn‚Äôt sleep well, woke up in a bad mood, and felt some pressure from the situation. She noticed right away and asked what was wrong. I told her, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine, just didn‚Äôt sleep much,‚Äù and she instantly shut down. She became distant, avoided my touch, acted like I was mad at her ‚Äî when I really wasn‚Äôt.

I even tried to lighten the mood ‚Äî suggested we all have coffee together, tried to connect with her physically ‚Äî but she kept her distance. Later that day we talked, and it seemed like everything was fine again. But the mood was still off for me ‚Äî just some lingering tiredness and frustration.

In the next days the cycle just kept going.

There was nothing to talk about, really ‚Äî I just needed space to be on my own.

But:
If I tell her what‚Äôs bothering me, she gets upset.

If I don‚Äôt tell her, she gets upset.

If I say it calmly, she still gets upset.

If I say it with some frustration, obviously she gets upset.

If I try to give an excuse just to be by myself (like tonight ‚Äî ‚ÄúI just want to go in the other room to get some air‚Äù), she picks up on it ‚Äî and gets upset.

She faces situations with anxiety, comes to me crying, trying to force some kind of emotional connection or reassurance in moments when I‚Äôm honestly just burned out and need space. And that only pushes me further away.

The thing is, she is a good person. She loves me and supports me in many areas of my life.
But her emotions are intense. So intense that they blind her to what‚Äôs actually happening.
Most of the things that bother me are small daily stuff ‚Äî like when she complains about me staying up too late, or how I handle my clothes (which annoys me because I actually do more housework than she does - more on that later).

Sometimes I just want to feel annoyed for 5 minutes and move on. I don‚Äôt always need to talk it out.

But with her, it‚Äôs like my emotional state has to be processed together, right now, otherwise she can‚Äôt breathe.

The other day we almost broke up.
It started with me opening up a bit about how I‚Äôd been feeling that day and ended in three chapters:

Chapter 1 ‚Äî She got extremely angry at me because I said she could handle my clothes as well. She called me evil.
Chapter 2 ‚Äî She started crying desperately and said seriously worrying, self-harming thoughts that I don‚Äôt even feel comfortable sharing here.
Chapter 3 ‚Äî Me trying to bring her back down to earth with a spoon (not literally ‚Äî just trying to ground her emotionally). I reassured her, and then we went to sleep.

Once again (this happens regularly), I had to set aside my own feelings because hers were too big, too urgent, too much.

So yeah. I love her.
But I feel emotionally drained. I feel like I can‚Äôt have a single off day without it becoming a whole thing. I feel like I have no space to just exist unless I‚Äôm constantly cheerful and emotionally stable for her comfort.

Has anyone been through something like this?
I genuinely believe she‚Äôs extremely emotionally fragile and needs mental health support ‚Äî support that I just can‚Äôt give her.

How do I deal with this without ending the relationship?

1kra5kn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Diary/comments/1kra5kn/gasstation_coffee_easter_eggs_in_the_simulation/,Gas-Station Coffee; Easter Eggs in the Simulation,"Last night my neighbor K and I went grocery shopping and then went back to her place and watched a couple of episodes of Rick and Morty. 

One about being in a simulated reality. Within a simulated reality. Within a simulated reality.

And one where the conflict was resolved by the characters transporting themselves to an alternate universe where the conflict had been resolved. And then taking the place of their alternate selves.

K and I shot the shit. I told her about how I was terrified of UFOs and alien abductions as a kid. About how, my mom would send me to go get something for her from the kitchen or living room late at night, and I would run at full speed. So sure I would glimpse a UFO out the kitchen window. And so sure that if I glimpsed it, it would abduct me.

Yet for some reason I watched a shit ton of UFO documentaries as a kid, like some mini-Fox Mulder wannabe. I sort of longed for an alien encounter. But I was also sort of terrified of one.

This morning on my way to work, I realized my gas was unexpectedly low. After dropping my son off at school, I stopped by the gas station.

I realized I'd forgotten to put my sports-bottle back in the car after bringing it along to hang out with K last night. 

So I went into the gas station to buy a disposable water-bottle to use for the day.

The smell of gas-station coffee was transcendental. And I had time to kill. I'm usually early for work.

I decided to fix myself a cup of gas-station coffee. As I decided among the various roasts and creamers, I was composing an ode to gas-station coffee, inside my head. The romance and whimsy and nostalgia of it. And that ode was what I was¬†*going*¬†to write here, in this entry.

But then I got a call from my sister. I would have missed her call if I had been driving, instead of fixing myself a cup of gas-station coffee.

Hi, Sis!

She called to ask me if I remembered the specifics of a UFO/alien encounter she and our other sister had had, around 27 years ago, when we were kids.

Yes. Of course I remembered. She had told me about it that morning at breakfast, before we'd left for school for the day.

According to the pair of them, they had seen red orbs in the sky, from their room. And then gotten up out of bed to investigate.   
  
Then they allegedly happened upon a terrifying and ethereal entity. And then they were allegedly inundated with light in myriad colors, from giant craft shining from above as it departed with its mysterious passenger.

They had related this story in terror, consulting me as the expert on such subject matter. I felt perhaps a bit jealous. As, why should such an encounter happen to my sisters, who had no interest in UFOs? ...And not to me?

Surely, it was a dream. Or, they had vividly imagined it, the way I often vividly imagined glimpsing a UFO out the kitchen window, because I had instilled in the pair of them such a paranoia about this topic. 

From my incessant talking about it and watching documentaries on it. 

But that day when I was at school, my classmate told me that she had seen mysterious red orbs and colored lights in the sky. Matching my sisters' descriptions.

And when I had come home that day I relented. I had told my sisters that I now believed them. That I knew they were telling the truth. That they really had seen what they'd claimed.   
  
And I went into UFO investigator mode and asked them for more details.

Well, flash forward back to present day as I'm standing at the gas-station coffee service.   
  
As I chatted with my sister about this event from our childhood, the coffee aroma pulled the edges of my consciousness into various adventures (from my own real past, from lives I've left unlived, and from my speculations on the lives of long-haul truckers I've seen in passing).

What a coincidence, I'd remarked to my sister. I'd just been talking about UFOs to my friend K, just last night.

Well, my sister told me, she had found an article from that year. From 1998. Confirming similar sightings. And this gave her some sense of vindication.

The convenience store attendant boggled at me a bit as I marveled at my sister's experience a bit over the phone. And we talked about how scary and exciting it all was -- the orbs, the alien; and how I was a bit jealous that I didn't get to see it.

By the time the call was over, I was running much later for work than usual.

Which is fine. As I'm usually very early for work. And today I was just on-time.

As I started my drive to work, I heard something on the radio about an upcoming execution. I wondered if the accused perhaps had some sympathetic reasoning for his transgression -- some extenuating circumstances that had driven him to a reckless course of action and warranted consideration of redemption.

But then the reporter revealed that the condemned had killed a gas station attendant.

And this angered me. 

As, I felt, gas station attendants are sacred. In the same way that gas-station coffee is sacred. And I could not muster any sympathy.

And diary, what I can tell you is that:

\-due to my car being unexpectedly low on gas,

\-due to me misplacing my water bottle hanging out with K, and needing to go into the gas station to buy a new one

\-due to me getting enthralled by the aroma of the gas-station coffee

\-and due to my sister calling me to update me about her childhood UFO experience before I'd gotten back on the road

My entire commute was pushed much later than usual.

And I don't know what it means. But so many oddly related and improbable circumstances contrived to achieve it, that I cannot help but believe that it means SOMETHING.

Perhaps it means that something terrible would have happened to me if I'd been on the road at my usual time. That I would have gotten into some horrible accident.

But, I'm more inclined to believe, that if I'd been on the road at my usual time I would have wound up in some kind of exciting adventure. The exact type of adventure I usually long to fall into.

And that, someone else wound up falling into it instead.

I believe this because from what I have seen, the universe has that sort of sense of humor.

And I do acknowledge that this may well be some low-grade delusion. Brought on by stress. Which I have been under quite a lot of, of late.

But I can't help suspecting that there is an alternate universe where I did commute according to my usual time-table. An unlived life where things wound up going very differently, for me.

And I am inclined to believe that it is a sign of some glitches. Or amusing little easter eggs. In the simulation.",1,1747760640.0,Diary,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôve been a huge fan of Smith Teamaker for years, proudly grabbing their Lord Bergamot and other blends to share with friends and family‚Äîit‚Äôs been our little slice of Portland pride. But my visit to their SE Washington tasting room about three months ago left me kinda bummed, and I‚Äôm wondering if anyone else has felt the same.

First off, I noticed the Lord Bergamot pouches shrank from 4 oz to 2.5 oz, but the price stayed the same. That stung, especially since the tea itself doesn‚Äôt seem as special anymore‚Äîit‚Äôs tasting more like Stash (Steven Smith‚Äôs old brand) than the amazing blends we used to rave about. The packaging feels cheaper too, which just doesn‚Äôt vibe with the quality we expect from a local gem.

When we stopped by the tasting room, the service felt‚Ä¶ well, cold. Not the warm, neighborly welcome I‚Äôd hoped for from a place carrying Steven Smith‚Äôs name. It was such a letdown compared to the community spirit we love in Portland. Then, during a tour of their production facility, I was honestly shocked. The place felt dusty and kinda messy, and the air was tough to breathe. It made me worry about the folks working there day in and day out‚Äîmany seemed to be immigrant workers, and I can‚Äôt help but wonder if they‚Äôre being treated and paid fairly. No one should have to work in conditions like that.

There‚Äôs also this sign about ‚ÄúWhat Starbucks did to coffee, Smith did for tea,‚Äù which used to sound inspiring but now feels a bit unsettling, especially knowing Starbucks‚Äô rep for cutting corners. It hurts to say, but Smith Teamaker‚Äôs starting to feel more like a big business than the thoughtful, community-driven spot we all loved.

Has anyone else noticed this shift? I‚Äôd love to hear about your recent visits or if you‚Äôre still finding that Smith magic. I‚Äôm all about supporting local, so if Smith‚Äôs not what it used to be, maybe you‚Äôve got other tea spots‚Äîlike Jasmine Pearl or Tao of Tea‚Äîthat are keeping the Portland spirit alive?

I got some rather nasty responses telling me that I'm the problem for trying to get her up and moving. Well, she had a stroke later that week- my suspicions that something was wrong were correct. 

Since that time, she has made a fantastic recovery after receiving acute rehabilitation. Her speech is completely back to normal (she had speech aphasia at first). Physically, she was already not in great shape, so I don't see a huge physical change. I have noticed that short term memory is perhaps slightly worse than before, but not a huge change, either. 

The doctors cleared her to go back to her apartment where she lives alone. I haven't taken her back yet as I'm getting in home care set up first, a fall monitor, etc. I have concerns about her going home (I'm in another state and she was visiting me when the stroke happened, I'll take her home in a week) but given that her doctors have cleared her to return and she wants to return, I am just doing my best to make it as safe as possible and to honor her wishes. 

My concern is that it takes me numerous gentle attempts to get her out of bed each day. I bring her coffee, a banana, and her meds. I gently try to get her up several times. It takes 2-3 hours of this. I am super concerned that if she cannot get out of bed herself, she won't take her medications once she is back to her apartment. 

Is the sleepiness reflecting that she is shutting down, or is this just somewhat normal? And please don't come at me with ""let her sleep as much as she wants leave her alone,"" that is not helpful- she needs to take her meds and that won't happen if she sleeps through the day. I'm trying to make sense of what it all means and how to best support her and encourage her to at least get up to take meds. Thank you. ",2,1747760450.0,AgingParents,9,0.75,False

The night market thrummed with a restless pulse, its lanterns swaying in the humid breeze, casting a golden haze over stalls heaped with jasmine garlands and sizzling pans spitting sparks. The air was thick with the sweet tang of sugarcane juice, the sharp bite of roasted corn, and the faint drift of incense from a nearby shrine. Voices overlapped‚Äîvendors haggling, children laughing, a street singer‚Äôs melody weaving through the chaos. I moved through the crowd, the memory of the temple carved into my chest‚Äîher quiet smile, her voice like a half-forgotten prayer: *‚ÄúSome silences are louder than bells.‚Äù* That moment felt like a fragile thread, pulling me through the market‚Äôs clamor to find her again.

She stood by a stall of glass bangles, her fingers tracing their delicate curves, the lantern‚Äôs glow catching the soft creases of her cotton kurta. Her braid was loose, a stray strand curling against her cheek, and for a heartbeat, she seemed part of this vibrant, living world. But I saw the shadow in her posture‚Äîthe way her shoulders tightened, her eyes flickering with a restlessness that mirrored my own.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre here,‚Äù I said, stepping closer, my voice barely rising above the market‚Äôs din.

She turned, her smile fleeting but warm, like sunlight breaking through clouds. ‚ÄúCouldn‚Äôt resist the lights.‚Äù She held up a green bangle, tilting her head playfully. ‚ÄúToo much?‚Äù

‚ÄúOnly if you‚Äôre trying to steal the moon‚Äôs job,‚Äù I said, and her laugh spilled out, a sound that cut through the weight I‚Äôd carried since the temple. It was unguarded, fleeting, but enough to make me believe we could build something new.

We fell into step, the market folding around us like a living tapestry. She haggled with a vendor over a clay lamp, her voice bright until the vendor‚Äôs teasing remark about ‚Äúbuying for a lover‚Äù made her smile falter, her fingers tightening around the lamp‚Äôs edge. I bought her sugarcane juice, the glass cool against my palm, and she insisted it was better than my usual coffee, her eyes sparkling with mock defiance. We shared fragments of our lives‚Äîmy memories of chasing kites through endless fields, the wind tangling my hair; hers of sneaking onto her terrace to read poetry under a sky heavy with stars. Each story felt like a bridge, our silences from the temple now softened by words, tentative but alive.

Yet I felt the distance in her. I was falling for her‚Äîslowly, cautiously, with a certainty I hadn‚Äôt dared since my own heart was shattered. It wasn‚Äôt just her laugh or the way her eyes caught the lantern‚Äôs glow. It was her rawness, the way she carried her wounds yet still reached for healing, even if she stumbled. But no matter how much I offered‚Äîmy time, my quiet presence, my heart‚Äîit wasn‚Äôt enough. Her gaze would drift, glazing over as if tethered to a memory I couldn‚Äôt touch. In those moments, I felt the ache of my own scars‚Äîmy ex, the way she‚Äôd left me questioning my worth, her promises dissolving like ash.

We paused by a cart piled with marigolds, their fragrance heavy and sweet, the petals glowing like embers against the night. She spoke, her voice barely audible over the market‚Äôs hum. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been hurt before. My ex‚Ä¶ he wasn‚Äôt who I thought. He lied‚Äîabout his feelings, his life, everything. Controlled me until I didn‚Äôt know who I was. I thought I‚Äôd moved on, but his voice still creeps in, telling me I‚Äôll never be enough.‚Äù Her fingers clutched the bangle, her eyes fixed on the ground, as if confessing to the earth itself. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm trying to be here, with you. I want to.‚Äù

My throat tightened, my own ghosts stirring‚Äîmy ex‚Äôs betrayal, the way it had hollowed me out. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to carry him alone,‚Äù I said, my voice steady despite the storm inside. ‚ÄúI know what it‚Äôs like, competing with a shadow that won‚Äôt fade.‚Äù

Her hand brushed mine, a fleeting warmth that anchored me. ‚ÄúNot all boys are the same,‚Äù she said, her words meant to reassure, but a sadness lingered in her eyes, a hesitation that cut deeper than I wanted to admit. I saw her heart in fragments, each piece still caught in a past she couldn‚Äôt release.

I wanted to hold her, to promise I‚Äôd be different, to fill the cracks her ex had left. But her phone buzzed, a sharp vibration that shattered the moment. She glanced at the screen, and her face drained of color, her breath catching. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs him,‚Äù she whispered, her voice trembling as she turned the phone toward me. The text glared in the dim light: *‚ÄúSaw you at the market. You think you can move on? I‚Äôm not done with you.‚Äù*

The market‚Äôs noise faded, the lanterns‚Äô glow dimming as the air grew thick with the weight of those words. Her hand trembled, but she didn‚Äôt pull away from me. Her eyes met mine, wide with fear but holding a flicker of resolve. In that moment, I knew‚ÄîI wasn‚Äôt just fighting for her heart. I was fighting a ghost that refused to let her go, a shadow that threatened to unravel whatever we might become.

 I (21m) planned for my gf‚Äôs (21F) birthday a 3 day date where we did a bunch of fun things she enjoys leading into the weekend during the end of winter break in college when all of our friends are away for break. During the time we spent together we both had a bunch of fun and had zero issues at all. However, after waking up on the Saturday after the dates, my gf wanted me to help her learn how to program jn R (a programming language often uses for data science/analytics) for a lab position she has at our school. I honestly was kind of hoping to get some time for myself that day after spending a bunch of time together but I ultimately figured that spending 2ish hours at a coffee shop helping her learn something I am well versed with would be fine so I agree to go.

Well fast forward to the coffee shop where we find a seat and sit down and she pulls open her laptop. She shows me what I am to help her with and I kid you not it is literally the cumulative sum of about 4 semesters worth of cs and statistics coursework that I was supposed to teach her in one day. I told her ‚Äúwoah, this is far more than I was expecting to do today I don‚Äôt think we can do this all today‚Äù. Keep in mind she had only three more days to finish and learn all of this. Because of that, I also made a probably unwarranted comment that was something like ‚Äúwhy did you wait so long to start this?‚Äù. Anyways, in response to this she goes silent and goes to the bathroom and comes out five minutes later after obviously crying in the stall and asks that we need to leave right now.

As we walk back to the car she gives me the silent treatment and won‚Äôt talk to me at all and I start to feel extremely guilty for not wanting to help her learn R. Eventually, she breaks the silence and we try and talk through it but it really went nowhere because she kept saying ‚Äúthis isn‚Äôt fair because I would do anything for you‚Äù which I told her was a super manipulative thing to say as well as completely untrue which made things worse. Eventually, I just ended up apologizing for not wanting to help her learn R so we could just stop arguing but honestly I feel completely disrespected about it still and it kind ignited some doubts I‚Äôm having about the state of our relationship as similar things have happened since. Yet, I still feel like I am not being a good boyfriend since I wouldn‚Äôt help her out in this instance. So, AITAH?",0,1747760073.0,AmItheAsshole,16,0.5,False

As we approach the deadline of final pmt we're coming across many options to add, which is overwhelming since this is our first ever cruise. Although my husband and I are drinkers and are adding the Princess Plus, we're thinking of just doing the Classic Soda Pkg at $17.69/pp/day for our parents. My understanding is that this includes the daily gratuity..? Our mom's do enjoy coffee, but is upgrading to the Zero Alcohol Pkg ($29/pp/day) for the premium coffee drinks worth it? I don't want them to feel short-handed. 

Also, is the last day (disembarking day) considered a day? For example, if the cruise is 06/06-13 will I be paying for 8 days or 7 days for the package?

""It was like nothing you've ever seen before.""



""Oh, really?"" Laura leaned in, sipping her coffee. She had a penchant for the macabre, but Mike's tastes were usually more mainstream. ""What was it? Some indie film?""



Mike shook his head, his grin growing. ""Nah, it's a classic, but it's not your typical horror. It's a twisted version of 'Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory'."" Laura's eyebrows shot up. That was unexpected.



""Wait, like the one with Gene Wilder?"" she questioned, her curiosity piqued. ""What could be so scary about that?""



Mike leaned closer, his voice dropping to a whisper. ""This isn't your childhood Wonka. It's the original book on steroids. The Oompa Loompas are eyeless demons, and the chocolate factory is a nightmare. It's not about whimsy or candy anymore. It's about survival."" Laura's skepticism was palpable, but she couldn't resist the bait. She set down her cup, ready to hear more.



The conversation had begun innocently enough, a casual chat between friends over breakfast. Yet, Mike's description grew increasingly vivid as he recounted the film. Laura found herself lost in his words, the images he painted with such disturbing enthusiasm playing out in her mind like scenes from a grisly play.



The film's Wonka was a sadistic madman, his smile never reaching his eyes. His chocolate factory was a maze of twisted metal and shadow, the air thick with the sweet scent of rotting candy. And the children, oh, the children. Instead of delight and wonder, their faces were masks of terror, their laughter replaced by screams. Laura could almost feel the sticky floor beneath her feet, the panic rising in her chest.



As Mike spoke, Laura's thoughts began to drift to her own childhood memories of the original film, the whimsical songs and the delightful world of pure imagination. Yet, the more he talked, the more she found those memories overshadowed by the disturbing images he presented. It was as if a dark cloud had rolled in, casting a pall over her cheerful recollections.



The sun shone brightly outside, but inside the caf√©, it felt as if it had been swallowed by the shadowy depths of Mike's twisted Wonka-verse. Laura's appetite waned as she listened, her toast growing cold and forgotten on her plate. She had to admit, the concept was intriguing, if not a little unsettling. But she had never been one to shy away from a good scare. Perhaps, she mused, it was time to indulge in a little horror herself.



""Alright,"" she said, pushing her plate aside. ""You've got me hooked. Tell me more about these demonic Oompa Loompas.""



Mike's eyes gleamed with excitement as he dived back into his narrative. ""They're not just workers anymore, Laura. They're... creations, Wonka's personal army of tormentors. They don't just sing and dance; they hunt. And when they catch the naughty children, oh boy, the punishments are something else. It's not just 'turning into a blueberry' anymore. It's... much, much worse.""



Laura felt a shiver run down her spine. The thought of those lovable, little orange beings transforming into such monsters was almost too much to bear. Yet, she couldn't look away from Mike's face, his eyes alight with the horror of the scenes he described. It was clear he had been deeply affected by the movie, and she found herself both repulsed and fascinated.



""One kid,"" Mike continued, ""greedy little thing, he gets his hands on a piece of gum that's still in development. The Oompa Loompas find him, and they..."" He paused for dramatic effect, then leaned in even closer. ""They rip his limbs off, one by one, and replace them with... well, let's just say, they weren't candy canes."" Laura's stomach turned, but she couldn't deny the morbid curiosity that grew within her.



The bell over the caf√© door jingled, snapping Laura back to reality. A young mother pushed a stroller inside, the baby inside cooing happily. The stark contrast between the innocence of the child and the macabre tale unfolding in their booth was jolting. Laura looked from the baby to Mike, then back to her own reflection in the chrome napkin holder. Her eyes were wide, her cheeks a little paler.



""I think I need to see this for myself,"" she murmured.



Mike nodded solemnly. ""It's not for the faint of heart,"" he warned. ""But if you can stomach it, it's an experience you'll never forget.""



The decision was made. Laura knew she would be watching the film that night, alone in her apartment with only the flickering light of the TV to keep her company. She wasn't sure what she was expecting, but she had a feeling it would be nothing like the childhood classic she remembered. The sweetness of the story had been replaced by a bitter taste in her mouth, and she found herself craving the dark chocolate of horror.



As the day dragged on, Laura couldn't shake the images from her mind. The thought of those terrifying eyeless Oompa Loompas with their sharp, twisted limbs lurked in the back of her thoughts, ready to pounce when she least expected it. She tried to focus on her work, but every time she closed her eyes, she saw their grins, wide and malicious.



Finally, the sun began to set, and the shadows grew long. Laura returned home, the anticipation of the night's viewing weighing heavily on her shoulders. She drew the curtains tight, the better to immerse herself in the film's sinister world. With a deep breath, she slipped the disc into the player and hit play.



The opening credits rolled, the music a twisted parody of the original's cheerful tune. Laura felt a knot form in her stomach as the film began, the bright colors of the classic film bleeding into something much darker. The first scenes played out like a fever dream, the whimsy of the original film warped into a nightmarish landscape. The Oompa Loompas didn't appear immediately, but when they did, they were everything Mike had described and more. Their eyes were indeed missing, replaced with gaping, bloody sockets. Their limbs ended in jagged stumps, and their skin was the color of rotten fruit.



As the film progressed, Laura's heart raced. The children's screams echoed through her living room, and she found herself clutching the armrest of her chair. The punishments were gruesome, each more horrifying than the last. Yet, she couldn't look away. There was something mesmerizing about the horror, a macabre beauty in the way the film subverted her cherished childhood memories.



The scenes grew more intense, the Oompa Loompas' candy-coated tortures growing increasingly grotesque. Laura felt a mix of revulsion and fascination, unable to tear her gaze from the screen even as the horror grew too much to bear. And then, just as she thought she couldn't handle another moment, the film reached its climax.



The last child, the one who had won Wonka's twisted game, faced the ultimate punishment. Laura watched, her eyes wide with horror, as the Oompa Loompas closed in, their sharp, pointed fingers reaching for the child's face. The screen went black, the screams continuing for just a moment longer before being swallowed by silence. Laura sat in the dark, her heart pounding in her chest, trying to process what she had just witnessed.



When the credits began to roll, Laura's hands were trembling. The film had left her feeling both sickened and strangely exhilarated. She knew she would have nightmares, that she might never look at a chocolate bar the same way again. But she also knew that she had just experienced something truly unique, a piece of horror that had burrowed its way into her soul.



And as she climbed into bed that night, the images of those demonic Oompa Loompas still haunting her, Laura couldn't help but feel a strange kinship with Mike. They had both seen the dark side of a childhood classic, and it had changed them both forever.",3,1747759934.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False
1kr9ua3,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kr9ua3,Recently separated 28 yo looking for advice,"Hey everyone,
I'm a recently separated 28 yo and could use some advice on how to improve my living room. My ex was the one who took charge of decorating, and now that I‚Äôm on my own, I want the space to feel more like me.

I‚Äôve been browsing here and have a few ideas based on common suggestions, but I‚Äôd really appreciate your thoughts too:

I plan to add a rug under the couch and coffee tables. Any suggestions on color or pattern? I was thinking a round one might look good. It definitely needs to be washable, because let‚Äôs be honest, spills will happen.

I'm planning to replace the couch with something smaller and higher off the ground. The current one (IKEA S√∂derhamn) is uncomfortable as hell. I'm considering this one:

Or this one:
https://moonap.com/en/products/monroe-4-seater-sofa-pack-canvas-242cm-pouf-with-table?variant=50058124886350
My current couch is almost 3 meters (about 9.8 feet) long, but I‚Äôm looking for something closer to 2 meters (about 6.5 feet). Open to other suggestions available in the EU.

I‚Äôm thinking of adding a couple of white shelves behind the couch for my Blu-ray collection, more plants, and some art.

Maybe a pair of tall plants behind the couch near the speakers?

I've already moved the couch closer to the TV for a more immersive setup.

Planning to install sand-colored blackout curtains to cut down on glare.

Might hang a few movie posters or some nice artwork like this one:

Not sure yet, open to ideas.

Considering an arched floor lamp over the couch. I‚Äôve already got Philips Hue bulbs on the ceiling, so I can really set the mood, but maybe an extra lamp would help tie things together visually?

The room is about 4.5 x 4.3 meters (roughly 14.8 x 14.1 feet), and I‚Äôd love for it to feel cozier, more put-together, and nicer in general.

The last story (of 4 parts) will be uploaded if this post gets an adequate response.

Story -

The day after the trip felt a drag. Rahul was still in Delhi for another week, I was at my home, while Atif was at his. I did not know what was going to happen in the coming week, but I knew that I wanted more.

On the first working day after the sexcapade, me and Atif made an excuse to stay late at the office. We waited for the last group of people to leave the office and as soon as they leave, Atif signals me to walk towards the store room.

The fluorescent lights of the bank hummed above me, a dull counterpoint to the frantic rhythm of my heart. Rahul was probably in his hotel room in Delhi, thinking about me, missing his beautiful wife. A life I‚Äôd chosen, built brick by brick, and yet‚Ä¶ here I was.

Atif caught my eye from across the almost-empty office. He gave a barely perceptible nod, a silent signal that the coast was clear. The last of the evening shift were finally gone. My stomach churned with a mixture of guilt and anticipation. I smoothed down my skirt, the fabric suddenly feeling too tight, too restrictive.

""Just need to finalize the ledger reports, will call you in a bit,"" I'd texted Rahul hours ago. A lie, another small fracture in the facade of my marriage. The first of my excuses, which now have become almost a routine, a necessary evil to carve out these stolen moments.

The store room was dimly lit, a single flickering bulb casting long shadows on the dusty floor. The air was thick with anticipation and the scent of stale coffee. Atif's eyes gleamed in the half-light as he pulled me closer, his hands roaming over my body with a hunger that took my breath away.

""I've wanted this for so long,"" he murmured, his lips brushing against my ear. His words sent a shiver down my spine, igniting a fire deep within me. I responded with a moan, my hands tugging at his shirt, desperate to feel his skin against mine.

With a growl, Atif lifted me up, his hands gripping my thighs as he pinned me against the wall. I wrapped my legs around his waist, my heart pounding in my chest as I felt his arousal pressing against me. He kissed me fiercely, his tongue exploring my mouth with a raw urgency that made me dizzy.

He slipped his hand under my skirt, his fingers finding my wetness. I gasped as he stroked me, my hips bucking against his hand. I could feel the heat building inside me, a volcano ready to erupt.

With a groan, Atif tore himself away from me, his eyes wild with desire. He fumbled with his belt, his hands shaking with urgency. I watched him, my breath coming in short, sharp gasps.

Finally, he was ready. He lifted me up again, his eyes locked on mine as he thrust into me. I cried out, the sensation of him filling me completely overwhelming. He started to move, his pace quickening as he drove deeper and deeper.

The store room echoed with the sounds of our lovemaking, the slap of skin against skin, our moans and gasps. It was primal, raw, and utterly intoxicating. I felt like a wild animal, unleashed and free.

Atif's thrusts became more urgent, his breath hot and heavy against my neck. I could feel myself teetering on the edge, the tension inside me coiling tighter and tighter. With a final, powerful thrust, Atif sent me over the edge. I cried out, my orgasm crashing over me like a wave.

Atif followed me soon after, his body shuddering with pleasure. We clung to each other, our bodies slick with sweat, our breaths mingling in the still air.

The aftermath was a hazy blur. We dressed in silence, our bodies spent and our minds reeling. I couldn't believe what had just happened, yet I couldn't deny the satisfaction that coursed through me.

As I stepped out of the store room, I felt a pang of guilt. I was married, I reminded myself. This was wrong. But even as I chastised myself, I knew that I would be back. The store room now became our secret sanctuary, our place to escape from reality and indulge in our forbidden desires.

And so, the cycle continued for the whole week. We would steal moments away from our daily lives, sneaking into the store room whenever we could. Each time, the sex was just as intense, just as addictive.

But with each encounter, the guilt grew. I loved my husband, I reminded myself. But the pull of Atif was too strong, the allure of our secret trysts too enticing.

I knew that I couldn't keep this up forever. Eventually, the truth would come out. But for now, I was content to lose myself in the dusty floor of the store room, in the arms of a man who made me feel alive like never before.

Its literally gonna be my last day of high school in about less than a week. Which is lowkey crazy. For this cycle of showing up to the same old place everyday in the same old uniform for 12 years to be ending, THAT'S CRAZY. To think I'm gonna lose my predetermined day to day structure is kinda scary, even though it's literally everything i've dreamed of everyday. Anyways, this might come off as fake or even tacky to some but I really wanna do smt special for my last day of school. My classmates already planned a potluck, but this year I made a lot of new friends. So basically, from the first grade to the eleventh, i didn't really go out of my way to make new friends, so I have always been in a group of around 3 people wherever I was andIi was always lowkey a freak  when someone new tries to become friends with me, as if all my social skills disappear the second someone new says hi, but to be fair, as soon as the barrier is broken I am the most genuine person out there, I think. 

WAIT, back to the potluck, so the potluck would just be smt special for classmates, but i wanna celebrate the new people too because this year i broke out, became the recruitment officer of a new club ‚ÄúThe Writers Club‚Äù and through this role I met so many people I would call friends, but this is my last year so im literally never gonna see them again probably, so I wanted to make all of them chocolate crinkle cookies, like 4 per person, and that may sound little till you realize that theres 15 people, which adds up to 60, and i might as well make extra for the potluck so thats 75-80. I was worries about the cost though so I chatgpt ts and it lowkey wasn‚Äôt that bad. So now its a matter of whether im able to trust myself to not spend my allowance‚Ä¶

I have a confession though, the cookie idea came to mind because of a certain someone, well 2 people, one was a friend of mine, lets call them ‚ÄúWind‚Äù, around the end of last semester Wind were handing out cookies to everyone with notes for new years, and a semi confession to their crush with that note, which didn't really work but im sure it provided some relief to get it out. So I kinda wanna do the same. It's a bit complicated but I kinda have a crush on this person. Let's call him ‚ÄúSwiss‚Äù. 

I ‚Äúmet‚Äù Swiss when I acted as the Apple Tree in my schools Wizard of Oz play, put on by The Theater Club. So Swiss was a volunteer, part of the logistics team. So I auditioned, got the part, missed a script reading, attended a new one, bla bla bla. And then came the first rehearsal. The rehearsal was so goddamn messy, everything was ROUGH, each scene took 3 times longer than expected so I had a lot of free time till my part comes up, so I spent a majority of my time helping my friend who volunteered as a costume designer, lets call her ‚ÄúKeylimepie‚Äù. So in the designers room, it was this big ahh mess of cardboard and each design team just huddled around each other doing their work, and I was helping out wherever I can, just chilling. Then, I noticed this one boy in flannel sweatpants for some reason, he was noticeably loud and cheery, like a stupid kind of voice that's oddly endearing. I looked at the noise and he was lowkey cute, he caught my eyes for a bit but that was really it. Well thats a fuckin lie, cuz the image of his face was in my head that entire night. Keep in mind this was on a Friday, and volunteers can help on Saturdays, and I, the actor who had no part in production, came anyway in hopes that I might get to see him. Which I did <33.

It's actually quite a while back but for some reason this day was really memorable. Keylimepie actually didn‚Äôt wanna come because she didn't wanna do her work, but I convinced her to because I would've had no one if I came alone plus its literally her job. So I came early that day, I forgot why, maybe I wanted that aesthetic morning coffee run. But its a saturday so the school was dead silent. I walked around the school a bit looking at everyones unattended school fair project, OH BTW, the play was happening during the school‚Äôs fair. And then I walked to the designers room, and it had a fair amount of people actually, well maybe it just seemed a lot in contrast with the emptiness of the school. It was like 4 people and amongst those 4, Swiss was there, in those exact same pants. Keylimepie wasn‚Äôt there yet so I remember feeling really awkward and intrusive, so I just sat in the corner on a stack of chairs while they did their thing, discussing their work. And omg, she took so damn long, or they took so damn long, because none of my friends design team member showed yet, so I just sat there in a bright air conditioned room, sitting on a stack of pink chairs, with my silly sideway bag, and playing blockblast on my phone. While they were working so early in the morning, one of them wanted coffee and then another wanted something else, so Swiss got up and volunteered to do the coffee run, and he pointed at all his friends one by one asking if anyone wanted anything, and then he pointed to me and said ‚ÄúDo you want anything?‚Äù and I said ‚Äúoh no its fine‚Äù, and I remember his friends being kinda uncomfortable by the interaction because normally you wouldnt interact with a random stranger, ever. I remember being stunned a little bit the moment he said it, my heart was pounding. 

Later, one of the costume designer in Keylimepies team showed up, lets call her ‚ÄúGoate‚Äù, so Goate shows up and I ask if I could help with anything and she just assigned me to something and we got started on work, and it was a day of freework, so people came and go all the time, the room could be almost full for 30 minutes and empty during lunch. I wasn‚Äôt really hungry so when my friends left for lunch, me and Keylimepie stayed to do our work, and so did Swiss. I remember my eyes, could NOT stop glancing over at him. It was a rough day tbh :(.

Throughout moments like that, and being in the play, we saw eachother for a bit more, I stayed and help clean wherever I can, and I think I might‚Äôve only been doing that because I knew Swiss would do the same, and I took every chance I could to see him. Omg ts is so embarrassing, VHWKDHASDJ. I know its just a man, a boy, but, but :((, I keep seeing him around, and his curly hair, honey skin, and his big eyes, and overly expressive face, and his personality and energy, his grade is ass but hes always around helping everyone with random things. It gets my goddamn stomach churning at every interaction, my heart pounds so bad I have to act all nonchalant and shi whenever we talk. The worse part is he‚Äôs probably straight, and you know I would never confess, cause im scared and stuff or whatever, and its fucking embarassing.

So the few months after that I always see him around, and we talk sometimes through mutual friends but never just us tho cause I canNOT talk to him the way I talk to other people, I always get shy and I get kinda mean out of nowhere. He makes me feel like an abandoned dog playing hard to get when a new sun shines upon me. I found out hes older than me by a few months, but hes a grade below me, someone I knew actually told me some bad stuff about him but they knew eachother since kindergarten so I question the relevance of what was told to me because of time, or maybe im just making excuses for him. 

After Khmer New Year, or Songkran, because I went to Songkran unplanned at night with Keylimepie which is like this big water festival where people play with water and baby powder. I was out with her already at another friends house baking cinnamon rolls together (failed), so I kept a lot of the baking ingredients in the underseat storage of my motorcycle/scooter. It was a school evening and I just sat there alone and sad looking on my scooter at the parking place waiting for my brother to finish whatever he was doing so we could go home, and I remember Swiss coming up to me and just fuckin around with me, asked me to open my scooter, because he was silly and wanted to see what was in it probably, and he saw the all purpose flour bag, and giggled and asked me why I had that. And I said ‚ÄúI bake!!‚Äù and he said ‚ÄúBake me something‚Äù, which I then said ‚Äúyou wish‚Äù. 

And today, during lunch, I was walking to my scooter and he randomly came out of nowhere and grabbed me around my waist pulling me somewhere, and I think he said ‚ÄúCome, free milk‚Äù or some goofy ahh shi along that line. He was always very touchy, and maybe thats just a straight person thing but it lowkey makes me sad, and I don‚Äôt know why, maybe limerence. But after that moment, I remember the rest of my day, I was stuck in my aching heart, and my mind replaying the same scene over and over. And ugh, I both hate and love how much power he has over me, how much he forces me to feel, and I probably look like a crazy ass homo for feeling all this and im lowkey ashamed. Im graduating in a bit, and we‚Äôll never see eachother again, and my heart breaks but at the same time im also kinda relieved, like I wanna cry but I know I‚Äôll be satisfied after that cry.

AND THAT, is why I wanna bake cookies for my last day.

I quickly opened the glove box, grabbed a fast food napkin, and wiped it off. From the 6+ years I have owned this vehicle, I know that the touch screen gets glitchy when wet, so I also put it in screen clean mode, and took my (dry) microfiber towel to wipe it down good. I went into work and thought nothing of it.

When I came back out, I was having a hard time pressing the bottom row buttons. I couldn't press the slacker button to change channels, or the three dot menu. I figured that it might just be coffee residue, so I wiped it down with a mf cloth again when I got home. However, when I got inside my house, I could hear the bump-bump-bump of bass coming from my car.

When I got back out to it, the screen was still twitching. You know, phantom touching the screen to reactivate the console like you would when the driver has left the car. Worse yet, it was pressing the save dashcam clip button over and over, and the defrost button, so the car was defrosting on high making it 90+ degrees in there.

So, I paused the radio, disabled the HVAC, and put the car to sleep, just so that it wouldn't keep burning energy keeping itself awake.

It has been over 5 hours since the coffee incident, and the phantom touches haven't gotten any better. Maybe some coffee got into the bottom screen crack or something?

It has never been this bad for me before. Anyone have any better/solid tips on how to remedy this? Special wipe down/cleaning method? You aren't supposed to use anything wet, so I am at a loss of what else can be done.",1,1747759340.0,TeslaModel3,1,1.0,False

Have been peeing on these pricey sticks since early Jan. I'm in a low spot and I know I'm not alone.

I know my current low spot will pass, but man - I'm down. I'm tired. I'm taking 1000000 supplements. I'm doing all the ""woo"" things because why not at this point.

Maybe y'all will be entertained but I had chatgpt 'zhuzh' up this cycle's GAME PLAN (because ya know having a plan makes me feel a bit better / control or something) Also lol-ing at the 'woo' text chatgpt added (this girl did NOT write things like 'baby blessings' lololol)  I cut out all the bullets that suggested things like journaling, meditation, and making an 'altar'.

We shared similar education and sense of humor, interests in life, pets and even food (we had both ordered door dash Saturday night and it ended up being the same restaurant), similar movie tastes, etc. he called me on FaceTime Sunday morning and I noticed he ended the call without following up on meeting. I opened Facebook dating where we had met (matched as friends) and noticed he had deleted me. I was shocked. There didn‚Äôt seem to be anything wrong except for him not wanting to meet. Maybe I am just over reacting but a couple weeks back I met someone for coffee and we noticed at the same time he had large sweat stains under his arms and he literally ran to his car and never texted again (just for context, I think that‚Äôs why he left). I didn‚Äôt give him any dirty looks or anything. 

Anyway, if you‚Äôve read this far, I need some feedback. Should I ask the FaceTime guy to give me a reason he deleted the match right after seeing me? I try to take care of myself and he had said on Saturday that he thought my photos reflected that I was ‚Äúpretty‚Äù (his words). My hair is a bit darker currently but this is the only difference in my appearance, I didn‚Äôt filter my pics and made sure I was dressed average (hoodie w minimal make up) I was wearing a hoodie and minimal make up on the FaceTime also. 

I have played the conversation back in my mind many time and I don‚Äôt think I said anything to offend. I am unable to stop wondering what I did. He was the first person I have enjoyed taking to on the phone for awhile. Don‚Äôt know if this matters but I am 42 & he is 45. I never match with anyone I have an attraction to and have all the same interests so I am wondering mostly due to this as to what could have possibly went wrong. 

But the main question I have is should I ask or would that be weird since he deleted me right after seeing me? If it‚Äôs something I could work on improving I‚Äôd like to know. Obviously at the age I am getting to be I always wonder if I am no longer attractive but I would hate to think I am so far gone the sight of me would cause someone to flee like that. 

Appreciate any opinions on this. I think I need to ask asap or not at all. The more time that passes the crazier I would sound for asking.

Most of the times it was about studies. We(me, my sister and my brother too) used to get locked up in the store room for studying and were only allowed to get out and have food After we have completed the portion that was allotted for us to learn. My brother was good in studies so that torture stopped  for him early. But for me and my sister ir went on till class 6-7th. We have been beaten in front relatives, outsiders, mocked for wanting to do makeup or even growing nails. We weren't allowed to order food from outside and if we're caught, money from our bag would be taken which anyways was their money only. Just that they gave us some rupees that we used to save and buy snacks. One time I bought one 40rs maaza bottle without my parents knowing and my father saw me with the bottle. I asked him not to tell mom but he did and she beat me up in front of the maid as well as took the bottle and threw the whole thing in the sink and threw the bottle saying ""ghar ka khaana khao"" 

However we got everything related to studies whatever we wanted. I even got gifted a synthesizer by my father on my b'day. My brother got a guitar. We slowly started studying on our own and passing classes without hassle. So the beating part stopped. Now a phase came when I was supposed to cook. Which I did. I had to cook 40-45 rotis daily because there were six people and three dogs eating. But I did that. But it never came to my sister. My mother always said she's still young. Even when I used to cook from class 6th and she didn't even know to make tea till she was 18-19. She still doesn't know how to cook anything good. She barely is able to make rotis and it's never gol. I tell my parents she needs to learn and do things on her own without me helping but they dgaf. They say she'll learn. Rn you're the elder sister. 

Today morning i asked my mum to share some household work to my brother too. If we do the cooking he can at least do small stuffs like filling up the bottles and keeping them in fridge. Feeding the dogs or check and lock all the doors before we sleep or even just cook on sundays. But my mother denied it saying ""boys don't do household stuff"" I told her rest of the family does all the work while he just leaves the kitchen messed up even when he has just made one cup of coffee for himself and we have to do all the cleaning and cooking and other stuffs. My younger sister got mad and started shouting that why is she(my mum)so sexist while in grandma's house our cousins do cook and clean. To which my mum replied ""at least he studies seriously"" Now I also got mad because I'm also preparing for govt exams but I don't get any time to study because of nobody is there to share the work. All load is on me and my sister but my mother just shouted and shouted until she started crying saying ""nobody needs to do household work you all should get outta my house and I can cook and clean for myself and my husband""

I tried calming her but she already was angry and now she isn't talking to me and my sister too. While all we did was to speak up about sharing the work so everybody gets time to study or even rest through the day. My sister did intervene and spoke disrespectfully but that's just because these people traumatized her enough when I was at hostel for my bachelors. So she is rude. But I was calm and kept my words how I wanted to be heard. But my mother only heard that we don't wanna work. Idk today she's making all the dinner herself and when I tried helping her she denied and said go study. And she isn't talking to me. Or my sister.

Tried talking to my father about this but he said ""day before yesterday when you made paneer, your brother only brought it from the market right? How can you say he doesn't help? "" And Idk what to even reply to that. ",4,1747759169.0,AskIndianWomen,7,0.84,False

**Hi, I‚Äôm a 22y/o male from Sungai Petani, Kedah.**

I graduated with a Computer Science diploma from UiTM. After that, I tried to pursue a degree in Multimedia Computing (also at UiTM), but ended up dropping out due to mental health issues and being overwhelmed with the workload.

I did try to get help while learning there, I went to a psychologist and tried to socialize (lepak sekali, group study), but most of the time our schedule tak ngam, or they stay luar uni, so susah nak jumpa. In the end, I jadi lone wolf. After failing here and there, I just couldn‚Äôt take it anymore and decided to drop out.

During my diploma internship, I was placed in a fairly big company. My advisor left me to handle a full-stack project alone. It was too much. Thankfully, the technicians there really helped me out. They brought me to onsite and offsite jobs, sometimes even sent me alone to fix smaller issues. I learned a lot from them. Other IT staff also lend a hand if I got any question. My advisor? ‚ÄúBusy man‚Äù he was placed in different building than me. Honestly, I learned more from the staff than from him.

Even with that experience, my diploma started to feel macam just another piece of paper. Most jobs I stumble here either want a degree or proper experience. Plus, I‚Äôm not the brightest among my peers, so nak tunjuk coding skill pun rasa far-fetched.

After I dropped out, I tried looking for work. I applied to kilang, and it's either takde kerja, kena scan QR and wait for eternity, or just no reply at all. Some only do batch interview. I also wanted to try office work, but my internship trauma still haunts me. I'm afraid I will be put in a position above my expertise and the expectation is beyond what I can handle again.

So, I went door to door looking for retail or F&B jobs. I finally got a job at a coffee shop and worked there for 6 months. I resigned on New Year 2025. All the male workers had left, and the female staff selalu ada drama. The manager pun macam tak kisah pasal wellbeing or proper SOP. She only cared if sales target tak capai, duit short a few sen, or if staff curi makan or buat air coffee. I rasa macam nak report, but my parents cakap jangan kacau periuk nasi orang, so I feign ignorance.

One thing I still don‚Äôt get, working in F&B but tak dapat staff meal... macam tak okay, right? I used to work as catering crew, tired, underpaid, but my stomach is always full.

Right now, I‚Äôm waiting for UPU result in  early September, to see if I have a chance to continue my degree, but maybe masuk like October. While waiting, I spend time at home doing small coding projects‚Äîtry different languages, and now I‚Äôm building a mobile app for personal use. Maybe later I‚Äôll put it on the App Store. Btw, I plan to study in networking next. And before you ask, yes, I know it's going to be hard... but I feel like, I need to do this for my own future.

To be honest, I feel like time is running out. If I get a decent job (gaji + environment okay), maybe I‚Äôll tangguh degree to next year. But I still need to find a job to save money now to support myself during uni.

# My questions & thoughts:

* Am I okay? Should I seek counseling or see a psychologist again?
* Should I just swallow everything and go back to whatever job‚Äîeven F&B?
* Would any office even hire me, with just a few months left before uni starts?
* I want to try kilang again, maybe lower-end position, so tak payah hope tinggi sangat‚Ä¶ Tapi I takut kena reject lagi. Should I still try?
* Or am I just dumb, lazy, and making excuses?
* Do you have any advice or thought you want to share?

  
Also, TL;DR cause this is way longer than I expected...

22y/o, male. Drop out degree sebab mental health. Internship create a traumatic scar, advisor lepas tangan. Lepas grad try kerja, cari kilang, tak dapat reply, office job trauma dapat FNB tapi resign sebab drama. Now tunggu UPU result, duduk rumah buat mini coding project. Tengah lost... patut kerja ke, sambung study, or should I consult a counselor?",2,1747759108.0,Bolehland,3,1.0,False

I‚Äôm 24, I‚Äôm pear shaped with a small chest and big butt, and I think I‚Äôve spent most of my life being insecure about myself. My mom always said I wouldn‚Äôt ever find a man, I was too shy or too conservative or not pretty enough. I dated a few guys but nothing ever serious. I spent so much time daydreaming about the perfect man that my actual life got kind of boring. I have an adult job, I take care of myself, but I‚Äôve always had this dream of being a trophy wife for a powerful man! That‚Äôs where you come in!

I may not be a supermodel, but I have finally 
found happiness and a husband. He's rich and successful, attractive, respected, and he loves me!

At least that's all I cared about. Now things are normal and it‚Äôs clear that I‚Äôm his, he tells me what to do and how to behave and I worship him for it. He‚Äôs kind and generous, particularly when I call him daddy, but he also has a rough streak and I love that. He tells me what to wear, often dressing me up in lingerie or costumes just for his amusement, and makes me obey and show off for his friends. I rarely say no to him, but when I do he respects it.

He seems intent on taking complete control of my life. We only do what makes him happy and I'm just expected to stand there, look pretty, and smile. But I love it!



Hello! I'm looking for someone to help me play this trophy wife story out! I‚Äôd love a long term partner that can help make it come to life! I have a life too so I‚Äôm totally cool with playing around life as long we communicate! I‚Äôm 24, I live in the US, and I love all things art, literature, poetry, movies, coffee, and desserts :) I can‚Äôt wait to get to know my new husband!

Kinks: Outfit control, costumes, older men, bbc, group sex, public play, humiliation and light degradation, spanking, choking, hair pulling, forced bi, being shared, and misogyny. Probably more too I can‚Äôt think of! Honestly tell me your wildest kinks and I‚Äôll probably be up for it because that‚Äôs what roleplay is for!

I talk about:

* Why ‚Äúacquired taste‚Äù feels like gaslighting to me
* How the smell and taste of wine literally trigger a sensory panic. Vanilla?! Raspberry? sensory overload! something more like vinegar is detected!
* The social theatre around wine that I just can't mask through. Try doing the same with a coffee or a soda and people will look at you if you become mad!

Both teams arrive at the Eastern Conference Final after impressive playoff runs. The **defending Stanley Cup champion Florida Panthers** eliminated the Tampa Bay Lightning in five games (4‚Äì1) and then won a hard-fought seven-game series over the Toronto Maple Leafs. Florida even rallied back from a 0‚Äì2 series deficit against Toronto, capping it with a 6‚Äì1 Game 7 rout on May 18. Meanwhile, the **Carolina Hurricanes** dispatched the New Jersey Devils in five games and the Washington Capitals in five, cruising through the first two rounds with identical 4‚Äì1 series wins. Carolina had a significantly easier Round 2, ‚Äúmaking light work‚Äù of Washington, and comes in well-rested.

This matchup is a **rematch of the 2023 Eastern Conference Final**, where Florida swept Carolina 4‚Äì0, with each game decided by one goal. Many core players from that 2023 series remain, adding a layer of *unfinished business* for Carolina. Notably, Florida is appearing in its third straight East Final and aiming for a third consecutive Stanley Cup Final berth (they won the Cup in 2024). Carolina, on the other hand, is seeking its first Cup Final appearance since 2006, having been stopped in the conference finals in 2019 and 2023.

**Regular Season Records:** Carolina finished 47‚Äë30‚Äë5 (99 points) in 2024‚Äë25 (2nd in Metropolitan). Florida went 47‚Äë31‚Äë4 (98 points), 3rd in the Atlantic. In fact, both teams recorded 47 wins each, reflecting how evenly matched they were over 82 games. Their head-to-head meetings were tightly contested as well ‚Äì the clubs split their season series (each winning on home ice) in 2024‚Äë25. Carolina earned home-ice advantage for this series by virtue of a one-point edge in the standings, so Game¬†1 takes place in Raleigh.

# Game 1 at a Glance

**Puck Drop:** 8:00 PM ET at **Lenovo Center** (formerly PNC Arena) in Raleigh, NC. The atmosphere should be electric as Canes fans welcome the Panthers for this conference final opener.

**Weather Forecast:** If you‚Äôre heading to the arena, expect a warm evening in Raleigh. The forecast for May 20 is partly cloudy with daytime highs around **26‚ÄØ¬∞C (78‚ÄØ¬∞F)**, dropping to about **18‚ÄØ¬∞C (64‚ÄØ¬∞F)** by night. A light sprinkle (under 1¬†mm of rain) is possible, so a brief shower can‚Äôt be ruled out, but generally it‚Äôs a pleasant spring night for hockey.

# Projected Lineups & Starting Goalies (2025 Playoff Stats)

**Florida Panthers ‚Äì Lines:**

* *1st Line:* **Carter Verhaeghe** ‚Äì **Aleksander Barkov** ‚Äì **Brad Marchand** ‚Äì *(Barkov: 3¬†G, 7¬†Pts; Marchand: 3¬†G, 12¬†Pts)*. The Panthers‚Äô captain Barkov centers veteran sniper Marchand and clutch scorer Verhaeghe.
* *2nd Line:* **Matthew Tkachuk** ‚Äì **Sam Bennett** ‚Äì **Sam Reinhart** ‚Äì *(Bennett: 6¬†G, 9¬†Pts; Tkachuk: 3¬†G, 9¬†Pts)*. Tkachuk was quiet last round (0 goals vs TOR) and will look to rekindle his scoring alongside power-forward Bennett and sharpshooter Reinhart (41 shots but 4 goals so far).
* *3rd Line:* **Eetu Luostarinen** ‚Äì **Anton Lundell** ‚Äì **Evan Rodrigues** ‚Äì *(Lundell: 4¬†G, 10¬†Pts; Luostarinen: 3¬†G, 12¬†Pts)*. A young, two-way line ‚Äì Lundell and Luostarinen have been productive playmakers, each with 10+ points in 12 games.
* *4th Line:* **A.J.¬†Greer** ‚Äì **Nico Sturm** ‚Äì **Jesper Boqvist** ‚Äì *(Depth/energy line; Sturm is a +11 this postseason in limited minutes)*. This unit provides forechecking grit; Sturm leads the team in +/- at +11.

**Florida ‚Äì Defense Pairs:**

* **Gustav Forsling** ‚Äì **Aaron Ekblad** ‚Äì *(Ekblad: 2¬†G, 4¬†Pts; a physical presence with two suspensions served this postseason.)*
* **Niko Mikkola** ‚Äì **Seth Jones** ‚Äì *(Jones: 3¬†G, 6¬†Pts; tied for team lead among defensemen with 3 goals.)*
* **Dmitry Kulikov** ‚Äì **Nate Schmidt** ‚Äì *(Schmidt: 3¬†G, 7¬†Pts; also 3 goals from the blue line.)* *(Note: Florida‚Äôs defense has contributed 11 goals, the most of any team, showcasing their blueline‚Äôs active role in offense.)*

**Starting Goalie (FLA):** **Sergei Bobrovsky** ‚Äì The two-time Vezina winner has an 8‚Äì4 record, **2.31 GAA, .901 SV%** in these playoffs. Bobrovsky was shaky early in Round¬†2 but caught fire late, allowing just 4 goals total in Games¬†4‚Äì7 vs Toronto with a .957 save percentage. As the reigning Cup-winning goalie, he brings invaluable big-game experience. Backup Spencer Knight has yet to appear, as Bobrovsky has played every minute so far.

**Carolina Hurricanes ‚Äì Lines:**

* *1st Line:* **Andrei Svechnikov** ‚Äì **Sebastian Aho** ‚Äì **Seth Jarvis** ‚Äì *(Aho: 3¬†G, 10¬†Pts; Jarvis: 4¬†G, 10¬†Pts). Svechnikov leads the Canes with* ***8 goals in 10 games*** *after returning from last year‚Äôs injury. This dynamic trio combines finesse and physicality, and will likely match up against Barkov‚Äôs line.*
* *2nd Line:* **Taylor Hall** ‚Äì **Jesperi Kotkaniemi** ‚Äì **Jackson Blake** ‚Äì *(Hall: 2¬†G, 6¬†Pts; Kotkaniemi: 0¬†G, 3¬†Pts). Hall brings speed and former MVP pedigree on the wing, Kotkaniemi is a playmaking center (though quiet so far), and rookie winger Blake has chipped in 5 points with his quick release.*
* *3rd Line:* **Jordan Martinook** ‚Äì **Jordan Staal** ‚Äì **Logan Stankoven** ‚Äì *(Martinook: 1¬†G, 6¬†Pts; Staal: 1¬†G, 3¬†Pts). The veteran Staal centers a responsible checking line. Martinook and newcomer Stankoven (5¬†Pts) provide a mix of grit and youthful offense. Expect this line to see heavy defensive zone duty against Florida‚Äôs top-six.*
* *4th Line:* **William Carrier** ‚Äì **Jack Roslovic** ‚Äì **Eric Robinson** ‚Äì *(Roslovic: 1¬†G, 4¬†Pts in 7 GP). Roslovic returns to the lineup (after missing time) to center the fourth line; power forward Carrier and the speedy Robinson round out a forechecking unit. If* ***Mark Jankowski*** *(day-to-day) is cleared, he could slot in here as well.*

**Carolina ‚Äì Defense Pairs:**

* **Jaccob Slavin** ‚Äì **Brent Burns** ‚Äì *(Slavin: +7, 4¬†Pts; the defensive rock, paired with the veteran Burns who is a threat from the point).*
* **Dmitry Orlov** ‚Äì **Jalen Chatfield** ‚Äì *(Orlov: 0¬†G, 4¬†Pts; Chatfield: 0¬†G, 3¬†Pts). Chatfield is* ***questionable*** *for Game¬†1 (undisclosed injury); if he can‚Äôt go,* ***Sean Walker*** *(3¬†Pts) will draw in. Orlov‚Äôs puck-moving and physical play have been key since his offseason arrival.*
* **Shayne Gostisbehere** ‚Äì **Alexander Nikishin** ‚Äì *(Gostisbehere: 3¬†G, 7¬†Pts, with 5 PP points ‚Äì he quarterbacks a lethal power play unit. The 21-year-old Nikishin has 1¬†G, 3¬†Pts and has impressed with his two-way poise in his first NHL postseason.)* *(Note: Carolina has also gotten 8 goals from defensemen so far, including 3 by Gostisbehere. Both teams‚Äô blue lines are contributing heavily on offense.)*

**Starting Goalie (CAR):** **Frederik Andersen** ‚Äì Andersen has been nothing short of spectacular, posting a **7‚Äì2 record, 1.36 GAA, .937 SV%** through 9 starts. He backstopped Carolina to both series wins with calm, technically sound goaltending. Notably, Andersen has stopped 30 of 31 *high-danger* shots faced in the second round ‚Äì a testament to his clutch play. He‚Äôs supported by Pyotr Kochetkov (who saw brief action in 2 games) but clearly owns the net right now. This duel between Andersen and Bobrovsky pits arguably **the two best goalies of these playoffs** head-to-head.

# Injury News

**Florida:** The Panthers report a **fully healthy roster** entering Game¬†1. No significant injuries ‚Äì a remarkable stroke of luck given the intensity of their seven-game series. Depth forward Ryan Lomberg remains a healthy scratch option if needed, but as of now Florida will ice their optimal lineup.

**Carolina:** The Canes have a couple of depth concerns. Defenseman **Jalen Chatfield (D)** is **day-to-day** after missing practice Monday; his status for Game¬†1 is in doubt. If Chatfield can‚Äôt play, look for Sean Walker or rookie Nikishin to take on a bigger role on the second pair. Forward **Mark Jankowski (C)** is also day-to-day; he had appeared in 7 playoff games (4 points) before an injury. Winger **Jesper Fast (RW)** has been out since October with a neck injury (LTIR) and will not play. Notably absent from the lineup is forward Martin Neƒças (a 71-point scorer in the regular season) ‚Äì Carolina has not disclosed details, but he is not on the current roster, suggesting he may have been moved or is out long-term. Despite these losses, Carolina‚Äôs depth (Blake, Stankoven, etc.) has stepped up admirably.

# Key Players & Matchups to Watch

**Aleksander Barkov vs. Sebastian Aho:** Each team‚Äôs top center is a do-it-all leader. Barkov (FLA) is an elite two-way force and will likely be tasked with shadowing Aho‚Äôs line defensively. Aho (CAR) is the Canes‚Äô engine ‚Äì he leads Carolina in assists (7)[espn.com](https://www.espn.com/nhl/team/stats/_/name/car/carolina-hurricanes#:~:text=Points%20Seth%20Jarvis%20C%2010,24Plus%2FMinus%20Jaccob%20Slavin%20D%207) and is tied for the team points lead. The head-to-head between these Finnish stars ‚Äì and frequent national teammates ‚Äì will be pivotal. Look for Brind‚ÄôAmour to try to free Aho from Barkov‚Äôs checking when possible via last change.

**Matthew Tkachuk vs. Andrei Svechnikov:** Two power forwards who can change a game‚Äôs tone. Tkachuk was the playoff hero in 2023 (scoring the OTGWG in Game¬†1 and the series-clincher vs Carolina) and, despite a quiet second round, is due for a breakout. Svechnikov has been on a tear with 8 goals (leading all players in these playoffs), using his size and lethal shot. Expect both to assert themselves physically ‚Äì Tkachuk creating havoc in front of Andersen, and Svech driving to Bobrovsky‚Äôs crease. Whichever player imposes their will could swing momentum for their team.

**Defensive Depth & Blue Line Scoring:** These teams mirror each other in getting offense from defense. Florida‚Äôs back end (Jones, Schmidt, Ekblad, etc.) has contributed 11 goals, slightly more than Carolina‚Äôs 8. Carolina‚Äôs **Shayne Gostisbehere** has been a difference-maker on the power play (7 points, including 3 PP goals) ‚Äì Florida must account for his point shot and movement along the blue line. Conversely, Hurricanes will have to watch Florida‚Äôs tendency to activate defensemen like Ekblad (who actually served two separate suspensions already due to his aggressive play). The team that continues to get secondary scoring from the back end will have an edge.

**Goaltending Duel:** This matchup features **veteran netminders at the top of their game**. Bobrovsky has ‚Äúbeen there, done that‚Äù in big moments ‚Äì he‚Äôs coming off consecutive trips to the Cup Final and knows how to handle the pressure. Andersen, however, has arguably *outplayed everyone* this spring (league-best 1.36 GAA) and provides Carolina with immense confidence. Florida peppered Toronto with 6+ goals in two different games last round, but scoring won‚Äôt come easy now ‚Äì Andersen has a .923 save percentage against *high-danger* shots and rarely gets rattled. At the other end, Carolina‚Äôs offense will test Bobrovsky with a high volume of shots and traffic. Bob has faced some inconsistency (.901 SV% overall), but when the stakes rise he‚Äôs proven capable of stealing games ‚Äì note his Game¬†7 shutout in Round¬†1 and near-shutout in Game¬†5 vs Toronto. Whichever goalie blinks first could decide Game¬†1 and ultimately the series.

**Special Teams & Tactics:** Both clubs boast **elite penalty killing** units. Florida‚Äôs PK is second-best in the playoffs at 89.5%, and Carolina‚Äôs is nearly as strong (around 88%). Neither side has relied heavily on power-play goals to win, but each has weapons: Carolina‚Äôs top PP features Aho, Svechnikov, Jarvis, Hall, and Gostisbehere ‚Äì a unit that moves the puck quickly to open seams. Florida‚Äôs PP hasn‚Äôt been consistent, and they went through droughts last round, but with Barkov‚Äôs vision and Tkachuk‚Äôs net-front presence, they are capable of striking. Given both PKs‚Äô prowess, *discipline* will be crucial ‚Äì a tight-checking game with few penalties favors Carolina‚Äôs style, whereas Florida might welcome a chance to throw its weight around if they can intimidate without being heavily penalized.

At even strength, **expect a territorial battle**. Carolina and Florida were the NHL‚Äôs top two puck-possession teams this regular season (No.¬†1 and 2 in offensive zone time%), and likewise ranked 1‚Äì2 in shot attempt share this postseason. The Hurricanes play a high-tempo, forecheck-heavy system ‚Äì they love to swarm the puck, rack up shots (they had a +6.8 shots on goal differential per game, best in NHL), and wear teams down. The Panthers are also comfortable playing in the offensive zone (second-best shot differential, +5.4) but can switch gears to a counterpunching style when needed. Florida‚Äôs adaptability was on display in Round¬†2: after giving up 13 goals in the first 3 games to Toronto, they tightened up and allowed only 4 goals over the final 4 games. Carolina‚Äôs challenge will be solving Florida‚Äôs layers of defense and getting second-chance opportunities against Bobrovsky. Florida will focus on breaking through Carolina‚Äôs vaunted structure ‚Äì the Canes allow very few clean odd-man rushes and have the NHL‚Äôs stingiest shots-against in playoffs (just \~23 shots against per game). It‚Äôs a classic clash of two disciplined, well-rounded teams. Don‚Äôt be surprised if **overtime** is needed ‚Äì these sides are that evenly matched.

# Coaching & Intangibles

This series also spotlights an interesting coaching storyline: Carolina‚Äôs **Rod Brind‚ÄôAmour** facing his former mentor, Florida‚Äôs **Paul Maurice**. Maurice actually coached Brind‚ÄôAmour during the latter‚Äôs playing days with the Hurricanes in the early 2000s. Now Brind‚ÄôAmour is an established bench boss in his own right (2019 Jack Adams winner), and the Hurricanes‚Äô identity ‚Äì relentless work ethic, defensive responsibility ‚Äì mirrors Brind‚ÄôAmour‚Äôs DNA. Maurice, in his second year behind Florida‚Äôs bench, has pushed all the right buttons during the Panthers‚Äô back-to-back Cup Final runs. As one preview noted, *‚Äúit‚Äôs critical that Brind‚ÄôAmour bring his A-game against his former coach‚Äù* in terms of adjustments and matchup management.

**Team Identity:** The Hurricanes have been a model of consistency under Brind‚ÄôAmour ‚Äì a structured, forechecking team that doesn‚Äôt deviate from its system. Their core (Aho, Slavin, Staal, etc.) has several years of chemistry in this system, and they‚Äôll be fueled by the memory of being swept by Florida two years ago. The Panthers, by contrast, play with a bit more swagger and offensive flair ‚Äì they can lock it down when needed, but they thrive on timely scoring from their stars and clutch performances from Bobrovsky. Florida has also proven to be **incredibly resilient**: they have won 7 straight playoff series dating back to 2023 and simply do not panic when facing adversity. That championship pedigree could be an X-factor in the tense moments of this series. Carolina will need to prove it can get over the hump and close out a team that *‚Äúknows when and how to strike‚Äù* in big games.

# Betting Odds (Game¬†1 & Series)

*Latest odds (from Bitcoin-betting.com) in decimal and American format:*

* **Game¬†1 Moneyline:** Panthers **2.080** (+108) ‚Äì Hurricanes **1.840** (-119)
* **Game¬†1 ‚Äì Regulation Only:** Panthers **2.620** (+162) ‚Äì **Draw 4.170** (+317) ‚Äì Hurricanes **2.300** (+130)
* **Game¬†1 Total (Goals O/U 5.5):** Over **2.130** (+113) ‚Äì Under **1.787** (-127)
* **Series Winner:** Panthers **1.793** (-126) ‚Äì Hurricanes **2.099** (+110)

*The odds reflect how evenly matched this series is.* Carolina is a slight favorite at home in Game¬†1, but Florida is actually favored to win the series overall (perhaps due to their playoff experience and momentum). The total is set at 5.5 with the under slightly favored, which makes sense given the elite goaltending and defensive stats of both clubs. Bettors are essentially expecting tight, low-scoring games ‚Äì for reference, all four games in the 2023 Panthers-Hurricanes series were decided by a single goal, and we might see a similar razor-thin margin in each contest here in 2025.

# Prediction: Down-to-the-Wire Thriller

On paper, this game (and series) is almost a coin flip. Carolina‚Äôs home-ice advantage and rest vs. a potentially road-weary Florida are factors to consider. The Hurricanes will be energized in front of their loud crowd, and they‚Äôve had five days to game-plan for Florida. Meanwhile, the Panthers are coming in battle-tested (and perhaps a bit drained) after their Game¬†7 in Toronto just two days ago. The **rest vs. rust** dynamic looms large: will Carolina be fresher or will the layoff disrupt their rhythm?

Expect a **tight, defensive battle** to start the series, with both teams feeling each other out early. Florida will try to weather the early push from the Canes and capitalize on any power play chances to grab an early lead. Carolina will aim to use its depth (rolling four lines) to wear down the Panthers as the game goes on. Given the matchup of two hot goalies and disciplined defenses, one or two moments of brilliance could decide it.

In an opening game this evenly matched, overtime wouldn‚Äôt be a surprise. **Prediction:** The Panthers steal Game¬†1 on the road in a nail-biter, *3‚Äì2 in OT*. Look for a big goal from Matthew Tkachuk (who has a flair for the dramatic) to quiet the Raleigh crowd and give Florida a 1‚Äì0 series lead. Carolina‚Äôs inability to solve Bobrovsky cleanly will be the story, but the margin is razor-thin. (If Carolina can cash in on an early power play or get an odd bounce, it could just as easily tilt 3‚Äì2 the other way.) Buckle up ‚Äì this has all the makings of a classic.

I'm his person. I've been the most constant person in his life and he strongly favors me to other individuals. He's always been a bit quirky. He can be kind of a jerk, but mainly he's a good cat and I love him. 

He's been through a lot with us. We now have 3 dogs. At first it was really hard for him to adjust, but as time's gone on he's kind of been a boss. He doesn't take crap from the dogs, and we've always made sure to prioritize giving Reggie his own space and making sure the dogs don't give him a hard time or bully him. I think we over corrected that a bit though, because our oldest dog is a 9 year old black lab that is such a docile and soft dog, and Reggie is the one who actually singles him out and bullies him. 

Our latest change is adding my son into the mix, who's now 6 months old. At first when we brought my son home, Reggie didn't respond very much. He noticed him, we were cautious with letting him investigate but not get too close. But since then:

* Reggie has started pooping out of the litterbox. We've had his annual visit recently. His bloodwork is fine. He already had 2 litterboxes. We got two more of different types. We've tried some different litters. He still poops out of the box. There's nothing particularly wrong with it. We've also been trying to address pain where he gets an injection for his back and takes Gabapentin every day. Also, we literally gave him a bedroom that is HIS space where he gets fed, all his litterboxes are there, and the dogs don't have any access. 
* He's always been sensitive to new sounds, but it seems like he's extra sensitive now. For example, we'd always have to be careful when we use a new blender, coffee grinder, etc. Last week, my wife was using an immersion blender and he ran in and went after our oldest dog that he usually targets. I separated him and put him away in our bedroom. He was on edge after that later when I was jogging up the steps, he went after me and scratched up my leg.
* The biggest issue that's driving me to finally post and ask the community for help is that earlier today when my son was crying, he tried to go after my son. My wife fortunately picked up my son and he only had a tiny scratch, but I grabbed Reggie, got scratched up a bit and I locked him in my office. I moved him into his room now and I don't quite know what to do. My son is only going to get more mobile, so this is really concerning. 

I really don't want to have to re-home Reggie. I have family that could take him if I have to, so I wouldn't have to put him in a shelter and he'd be with people who love him. But I love this cat. He's been a part of my life for so long. And I know that I'm his person. But going after my son is a line that I really didn't want to have to cross.

I agree, we will come out of this as better people or else it would have been a waste of restless sleep and blurry eyes.

Looking for Feedback,"I'm in the early stages of launching a fully automated coffee vending kiosk business and would love some input on this from people who have worked in the vending industry.  

The kiosk would be a high-quality, self-serve coffee kiosk that serves espresso, lattes, cappuccinos, and many other options from bean to cup using a touchscreen interface.  It would create a much more premium cup of coffee than those old Crane National coffee vending machines.  I would spruce up the kiosk by giving it more of an inviting style like wood panel sides, pinterest-y signage, and overall more of a coffee shop vibe instead of the traditional industrial plastic/metal box a vending machine usually is.  I think this would be eye catching and draw interest.  My plan would be to put it in places like hospitals (where night shifters and visitors are constantly looking for coffee when food services are closed), outside/inside big box stores (walmart, home depot, costco, etc. where foot traffic is high), large transit centers (constantly people looking for quick on-the-go options), and on college campus's. (libraries, student centers, etc.)

Some machines that I have researched create hot and iced coffees, dispense a cup with every purchase, and have backend software that helps me manage stock shortages and downtime from my phone.  I have also seen cold brew kegorators where I would replace kegs of cold brew daily and people would self-serve and pay by ounce.  That is an option I could explore, but would truly want to start with hot coffee. I have never started a business, but feel that a need for something like this could be present.  Preliminary calculations tell me that there could be a large profit margin here, but I'm sure I am missing out on some industry expertise and unexpected costs.  I will be delivering and stocking machines myself in the beginning so labor costs are absent.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated! Pros, cons, critiques, and insights all welcome!

My friends literally called me ""Tomorrow Man"" because that was always when I'd get started. As a 21-year-old entrepreneur trying to manage a full course load, while working full time, I'd start projects with enthusiasm but drop them at the first sign of difficulty. My portfolio stayed empty and my confidence took a nosedive.

The turning point came when I realized my problem wasn't laziness‚Äîit was my mindset and approach.

**The Game-Changer: Micro-Steps**

The breakthrough happened when I started using micro-steps breaking tasks into such tiny actions that they become almost impossible to avoid. I still remember the relief when I first tried this and actually finished something without the usual panic.

Instead of Complete term paper I'd just write Open a document and write one paragraph. Instead of Study for final exam, it became Review just 3 flashcards in the next 5 minutes. Honestly, it felt kinda stupid at first, but that was kinda the point?

**My 3-Part System**

I used three simple techniques to make this approach stick:

**1. Visual Reminders:** I put colorful notes with my daily micro-step on my desk and created specific 5-minute calendar blocks for starting work. (The bright orange sticky notes worked best for me - can't miss 'em)

**2. Friction Removal:** I set up my workspace the night before and eliminated potential distractions, making it super easy to begin. This means putting my phone in another room sometimes lol.

**3. Built-in Rewards:** I turned it into a game with points for completed actions. These points earned me small rewards I actually looked forward to (video games, coffee, guilt-free breaks).

**My Results:**

In just three months, I wrapped up more projects than I had in the whole year before that. My mindset completely shifted‚ÄîI went from dodging work to actually diving in and getting things done.¬†

The most surprising part? This new way of thinking began to spill over into other parts of my life. As I got better at my work habits, I started using the same strategies for exercise and saving money. I even began hitting the gym three times a week, which is something I never thought I'd do.

**The simple truth:**  
  
 Start incredibly small, set yourself up for success, and reward yourself for showing up, not just for the end result.

What tiny first step could you take right now on something you've been avoiding?

Emma

""How can you watch this show?"" This question came from Noah. He will question my choices in shows while they're playing until he's fully interested in them. I braced myself for more questions.

""Don't be fooled, dear brother. This show is highly educational. I can learn what to do when the apocalypse descends on us,"" I answered, with the most serious expression on my face. That earned me a pillow thrown in my face. I guess my acting skills are still poor.

""You're going to search for a talking dog and a kingdom filled with clueless candy people?"" he asked while getting comfortable on the couch beside me. I heard a scoff of disbelief from him but the look of interest shattered that.

I smiled to myself and took another mental note of how different my older brothers were. They are at an age to go discover the world of..... whatever guys do at their age yet they prefer to dote on their little sister any chance they get. They were truly a conundrum. Noah and Jonah are twins and reached the popularity level of their social life, not only at the high school they attended but in the entire pack. They have a lot of acquaintances but not many friends. It's a bit weird but nothing to worry about.

""Emma! Sweetie, it's time to train.""

Oh no. One more episode. I can squeeze in one more episode before she notices then rush to the training grounds.

""Sure thing, Mom,"" I said as I put the TV on silent.

""One... Two... Three...."" Noah began to count with a silly grin on his face. Well, that's rare. He must be highly amused at my minor predicament. It's Adventure Time. Missing an episode or scene from this cartoon and you will miss the entire plot. Waving him off, I tried to get back into focusing on the show. Ice King was being an idiot again but I missed the concept as to why. Did he kidnap a princess again?

""Putting the TV on silent doesn't help little girl.""

I flinched upon hearing my mother speak again. For a moment I was shocked by the development but a mocking voice in the corner of my conscience reminded me of my situation. Momentary memory loss can happen to anyone.

""How can I forget that vital part? Looks like I have to do a recap on the show.""

""You forgot about your genetic make up, interesting"" The dry comment beside me amplified the mocking voice in my head.

""Heh! I know right!"" Smacking his shoulder to relieve some of my embarrassment, I left the sitting room to do as I was told. Mother is very strict when it comes to these things.

Not one of my best moments.

I rushed upstairs to change into my training clothes but my phone rang distracting me for a second. Seeing the name flashing across the screen brought a smile to my face.

""Yes! I am on my way and I didn't forget."" Foregoing the pleasantries, I answered the caller's unspoken questions when the call was connected.

Laughter filtered through the speaker from the other side of the line.

"" How can the third-in-commands daughter be so lazy? Come on Emmy. Show some initiative,"" the caller responded in an amused tone.

Mason. My best friend since diapers, and one who will never sugarcoat things while speaking with me. He's a dependable guy and someone I hold in high regard. Below my father and brothers of course.

""Because this daughter prefers to be away from sweat and bruises.""

""I still don't get it though you hardly train yet so strong in fighting.""

""It's called Prodigy. I'm a prodigy, my dear Mase.""

""Whatever you say, Emmy. Ah, crap it! Can you get here.... like now? Heather just showed up."" he said in an exasperated voice.

Visualizing the scene that may be taking place at the moment, I hastened my actions with pure amusement on my face. The job he requires me to do is the duty of a best friend. How can I turn him down? ""Your bill is racking up,"" I said listening in on the background noises on his side.

""Fine. Your favorite restaurants for a week excluding that stupid posh restaurant a town over."" Desperation laced his voice and like the best friend, I am I reveled in his misery. ""Deal!""

Making my way out of the house, I spotted Noah waiting for me patiently in the front yard. He turned and looked at me sternly in a silent warning. ""I know but...."" I started to say before he gave me the 'It doesn't matter' look. Along with my father, my brothers were strict with punctuality and constant training. I still had yet to figure out why. Our pack was well hidden from human towns and was regarded as a peaceful pack. We haven't had a rogue attack in years and no harassment from outsiders for a long time. The town was basically like any human suburb. I won't question their strict teachings but a reason will be nice.

We took a short walk to the training grounds to meet up with our brother and friends, I stood at back and looked at the scene before me. My father was training a group of five in hand-to-hand combat while others were in their wolf form partaking in mock battles.

It was a pleasant and interesting scene.

This world, my world is one filled with everything a fantasy or supernatural book entails. Werewolves and other mythical creatures were real but the humans are out of the loop of this knowledge.

Why?

The history books tell us why our kind decided to have things like that.

Our pack is a purebred pack, one of many, not as big as most but respected by others in the US. Moon Dust lives in seclusion and tends to leave the fighting for hierarchy to the major packs. Our Alpha kept it that way and we are eternally grateful to him for this. Our territory is like any other small town you can think of. The usual movie theater, cafes, shopping centers, schools, workplaces, beautiful colonial houses, and also the whole suburban feeling. Humans also live among us due to a few werewolves being their mates. Their numbers are less than twenty which is a steady outcome. We keep our identity hidden which is easy to do. We can venture outside our territory but must be careful. There's always the threat of hunters from the days of our ancestors who has descendants keeping up their work.

I guess that's one obvious reason for my training.

Looking around I found the person who needed my help apparently. As I got closer, I was able to catch the repeated response he gives to Heather when she approaches him. Probably the subject of dating as it was the same every time. Poor thing.

""Hey Mase, I'm here. Let's go train, you promised to teach me that new move."" I said with much fake enthusiasm. He released a sigh of relief as Heather spun around annoyance clear in her eyes. ""Beat it, brat. Grown-ups are talking,"" she said harshly. I wanted to point out that we were the same age but I guess that hasn't registered to her. That would be a longer conversation, I think.

""Who are the grownups?"" I asked. Distracting her from Mason was an easy job. After all, we don't like each other and fall into a lot of verbal spats.

""Us,"" she said motioning between herself and Mason.

""Heather, look I really have to tell you this. Mason... Mason..... He's just not that into you. I think he makes it clear during your numerous advances. Please. Give up. What you two shared was fleeting which she boldly declared after. What would your admirers think? I believe the present guy you're seeing won't like your current actions. At. All.""

I didn't mean to be so blunt but Mason was too much of a good guy to let down a girl no matter how tiresome that girl can be. It's a trait he sometimes hates.

She glared at me and tried to come up with a retort but failed miserably.

""You ... You... "" Her face was red in embarrassment as she was unable to say anything or justified her actions. She left in a hurry but I know she will do the same again. The persistence on that one was terrifying.

Mason fell to his knees and hugged my legs in many thanks ""You're the best ever! Thank you for saving me from her,"" he said releasing a huge sigh.

""There. There, drama king. How can you say that about the girl who turned you into a man?"" I said with a smirk while patting his head.

He looked up at me with narrowed eyes. ""Why do I tell you my secrets if you're gonna throw it back in my face?""

As typical best friends, since diapers, a lot of secrets have been shared. Being the beta's son and myself being the third in command's daughter gave us a jump start to our friendship. We were and still are inseparable, thick as thieves. Everyone thought as we became teenagers the friendship would end but we proved them wrong. Both of us will be 18 in a few months, finishing high school within a month and ironically we both got accepted into Brown University. He got a football scholarship while I got in with an academic scholarship.

""Because you love me more than Pb&j,"" I said tugging on his ear. He gave me that goofy grin that sends girls in a tailspin but I was totally immune.

""And you love me more than Nutella,"" he countered while getting up to throw an arm around my shoulders.

""Only you, Mase"".

For the rest of the training, I partook in hand-to-hand combat training with Mason while my brothers were in wolf form training others in defending against attacks. They were the strongest fighters in the pack and also the first twins to be born into the pack in 20 years. Their strength was on par with the present Beta Wolf which was an achievement by itself. The elders said it was due to our pack being peaceful that the Moon Goddess blessed us. To me, it was pure luck.

""That's enough for today. Dismiss.""

Everyone left when my father brought the training session to a close. Remaining on the field was my family, Mason and I. This gathering wasn't peculiar but my presence was questioned due to my status within the pack.

Dad waited till no one was within hearing distance then came over to me. My father was a force to be reckoned with, his powerful body screamed power along with his 6 2"" height. His eyes betrayed no emotion only his family were lucky enough to see it.

""You did well today, Emmy. Ready to go for a run?"" He asked me with pure adoration in his eyes. I looked at my brothers who smiled my way while Mason patted my head assuring me that the area was safe. I nodded in response and followed him to the edge of the forest.

The excitement began to bloom from within me until I was fully enveloped in it. My excitement and my wolf's matched perfectly.

Since I first shifted at 13 I always went for a run with my family but no one else. Everyone in the pack thinks that I'm a late bloomer, yes I get bullied about that but there was a reason why my family which includes the Beta and Alpha families chose to do so. The presence of my wolf was a secret. An important one. I don't know why but my parents said it's for the best.

I watched as my brothers shifted into their identical brown wolves with golden eyes, then Mason into his grey wolf with blue eyes. Lastly, my father a large reddish-brown wolf with dark eyes, all circled me as I shifted. In our 'wolf form', we are at the height of an adult human, or the equivalent height as our human bodies.

Shaking my body, I can feel the wind flow through my fur, moving them to their own accord.

Mason's wolf licked the side of my face as my brothers and father playfully bit my ears. It's been a while since I took this form and their wolves were equally excited for this run.

'Keep to the trails. We are going as far as the lake.' His message reached me through our kind's telepathic communication wave - mindlink.

'Yes, Dad!' I said as Noah and Jonah ran ahead. Mason was by my side as always as I followed them while my father brought up the back.

In human and wolf form, my growth was faster than any other she-wolf. This happens when you're blessed with such a rare wolf spirit. To record, I am the first white wolf in a century. No one cared to explain this occurrence and simply decided that I should live as a wolfless pack member.

I had questions but who should I ask? Who will answer me truthfully?

I need to know.

# 2.

Emma

The familiar yet annoying alarm woke me from a sleep I didn't want to leave. After blindly turning it off, I stared at the ceiling to get my mind together.

Monday morning.

School.

I turned and pulled the covers tighter around my shoulders and mentally planned my outfit and what I had to do during the day. Planning seems redundant when anything can disturb that but I like to keep things focused.

I had to. Over the weekend, that little seed of curiosity grew after I won a mock battle with my father over the weekend. Our run ended but he wanted to see my progress. Though it was learning, he didn't hold back. Surprisingly, I stood my ground and won. My brothers and Mason were truly shocked but my father had a look of worry. Won't a father be delighted his child can now defend herself?

Though out my entire routine of getting ready for school, more questions formulated leaving me in a daze.

""Emma! Breakfast!"" Jonah's shout and loud knocking pulled me out of it instantly. Checking the time, it seems I'm a bit behind.

""Morning."" Greeting him when I opened the door, he stretched forth his hand and opened it. I shook my head and took the half-folded bills in his hand and tucked it into my pockets. Normally I will protest but I will simply be ignored. Not that I needed it but the twins give me money for lunch every day even when I refuse. I know I have extra in my purse waiting to be used.

""Noah gave me last night,"" I muttered.

""That was Noah. Come on, Mason is waiting for you,"" he said softly before leading the way downstairs.

I followed him into the kitchen to see my hungry best friend shoveling pancakes into his mouth. ""You're ruining the image of a beta's son,"" I stated trying to hold back my grin.

""This image screams high metabolism and delicious food,"" he said gulping down some juice.

""Enough you two. More eating, less talking. Emmy, make sure to have a good meal now and a light lunch later. Your swim meet this afternoon is your last, so do your best."" My mother fussed over me while showing her moral support for my upcoming sports event.

My family was very supportive of my activities. Whether it's swimming or track and field, I had the best cheering team. The twins were star players in football and soccer when they attended Bronson High. Now it was my time.

""Don't forget 3 pm!"" I said with great confidence.

""We'll be there honey don't worry,"" Mom said kissing my head as Noah and Dad came in. Noah sat next to Jonah and they both began to eat. I paused on my meal to watch them. It was my favorite morning show since I was young. Simultaneously they both took 3 pancakes, drizzled them with syrup from left to right, placed pieces of strawberry and banana on the right side of their plate then placed their coffee on their right side also.

""Never fails to amaze me,"" Mason said out loud as he too was watching them. They both turned toward him and shook their heads.

""Hurry. You will be late"" Dad said kissing my cheek then Mom. He nodded and smiled at his sons before he left the room.

""Come on, Emma let's go,"" Mason said heading through the door. Taking my last bite I hurriedly said goodbye to my family and ran to meet him.

Our high school was like any other. Cliques were formed. The social queen was made. Hot guys were worshiped.

I'm a bit of a quiet observer. I got along with everybody to an extent but only close with Mason. My only real friend. Most of the time, we were considered an item among the student body no matter how many times we tried to correct their assumptions. Most of these assumptions were girls who wished for Mason's attention. Glares came as a second nature to me from them which brings us to my current situation.

Mason was holding both our bags with his arm around my shoulders as we entered the hallway. We were goofing off, as usual, walking to my locker as girls openly stared at him and none too subtly started to fix their clothes.

'Calm down girls. It's too early for this,' I admonished inwardly.

Here's my secret confession - this guy with who I share my deepest thoughts and have embarrassing moments around is definitely one handsome plus adorable guy. His shaggy blond hair, piercing blue eyes, and plump kissable lips, not to mention his perfectly toned body are what girls love. I'm a girl so I will admire his looks.

He only had 2 girlfriends but they didn't last. They somehow felt threatened by our friendship and broke up with him, he somehow never seemed to mind.

""Incoming,"" I muttered, holding my bag open for him as he sorted my books for the next two periods.

""How many?"" he asked closing my locker.

""Three. I think one of them is looking for a date to prom. I heard she rejected a few candidates,"" I said fixing his hair as he looked at me.

""Thanks. I can deal with that,"" he said turning around to the three girls approaching him. I stood quietly next to him as they sang out their ""Hi, Mason!"" To an outsider, their voices were like nails scratching against a blackboard.

""Hi, everyone. Good morning. Is there something I can do for you ladies?"" He said giving them his charming smile. Yup, and they are blushing.

""We were wondering...If you're going to prom with anyone?"" One asked as they all glanced at me.

As you guessed it, we both go to dances together. That's a normal move between friends.

""Actually... I..."" He started to say but a deep voice interrupted him.

""Emma.""

Mason's body froze before moving once more. He turned to see the newcomer with an expectant look on his face. He knew this person.

I noticed these quick changes and spun around after my shock wore off. I know this voice. I know this person. How can I forget them?

My heart was in confusion just as my head was. Memories of our past and the present became blurred. He isn't supposed to be here. Did something happen? We spoke briefly a few weeks ago. Did something happen since then?

Staring blankly at the man before me, my surroundings became louder. Their whispers were no longer low. It's obvious that this man's presence will cause a stir.

""You look beautiful as always,"" he said softly. I nodded my thanks and tried to hide my blush. Such a charmer, I complained inwardly with a smile.

""Still shy I see. I missed that,"" he continued touching my cheek, that one touch brought back so many memories. Unconsciously I pressed my cheek against his palm. Questions about his presence here swirled through my mind but I couldn't voice them. He was home.

Aiden Sorenson my first and last boyfriend. My first love.

That was before he left for two years to go to a boarding school in England. As the Alpha's only son, he's clearly the next leader of Moon Dust but he must be trained to be one, hence his overseas schooling. It broke me when he left, we stayed in contact but it wasn't enough for us to stay together. I won't lie and say that I didn't miss those beautiful grey eyes of his focusing on me, making me melt at his feet. I even missed running my fingers through his shoulder-length brown hair. I missed him entirely.

I didn't realize how close he got till I felt his lips on my cheek which made me jump back into Mason.

What was he doing? What was I doing? I am at school. Doesn't he care about how this looks?

Nothing should happen between us, he's the next Alpha and should be looking for his mate. Heck, I should be looking for my mate but this was Aiden. My first love.

""Still got that effect on her huh, Aiden,"" Mason said laughing. I looked around and saw everyone looking in our direction. The most uncomfortable ones were the hateful and envious glares from the girls.

Why did he have to come back now? I was over him. Well, I was sort of over him. I mentally groaned. This is hard.

""What are you doing here? Is something wrong?"" I asked softly looking down at my hands. He held my hands in his warm ones, I knew he can tell I was about to freak out.

""I can't miss your prom and graduation. You know this, Emmy, "" he said caressing the back of my hand with his thumb.

I was trying my best to stay strong. Moon Goddess help me out here.

""I... uh... I know. Still, you...."" I started to say but the bell rang cutting our conversation. I quickly left him and made my way to class. Smooth, Emma, real smooth.

I was the first to enter my history class so I had some time to recollect myself.

'I've missed you, butterfly.'

The message spoke volumes but I chose to ignore it. I blocked him out as I placed my head on my desk while the class begins to fill up. My mind was in chaos because of one person.

I missed you too.

Aiden

She still looked beautiful as the day I last saw her. Her eyes still gave away all her emotions without knowing it. I was happy when my father called me back home. I grew nervous at the thought of seeing her again with her chosen mate by her side. After seeing her still at Mason's side and having no scent of another man on her - I was relieved.

I know I have a mate out there but Emma had a place in my heart. She's the love of my life. Seeing her unmated state, cemented my thoughts. She's the mate I want, no other. Even my wolf Ace seems to be attracted to her. We both were contented with her. Only her.

""You should come to her swim meet later,"" Mason commented. All three of us have been friends since we were kids, growing up I always had a crush on her and grew jealous whenever Mason got her attention the most. It was he who convinced me to tell her my true feelings, I was surprised when she accepted me. Emma was a true gem.

""She still swims?"" I asked.

""You know our girl would never give that up.""

""Is she... looking for her mate?"" I asked my friend as I walked along the familiar school halls with him.

""She's not even bothered by it. I asked her but she told me she doesn't care about a mate yet till after college. She does understand what will happen if she meets him before then though,"" he answered giving me a wary look.

""You think she still wants me?""

""Emmy loves you but being honest here she's scared to give in to it fully. She doesn't want to hurt you or herself when..."" my friend said stopping in front of the science lab.

""....we find our mates,"" I finished for him.

Mason looked at me with pity but I smiled and brushed it off.

""Don't worry man I'm good,"" I said playfully punching him on his shoulder.

He shook his head. ""Good to have you back home bro. We missed you,"" he said giving me a man hug. ""Likewise,"" I said leaving him to go into his class.
