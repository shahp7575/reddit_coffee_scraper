1kkr3qb,https://www.reddit.com/r/GigilAko/comments/1kkr3qb/gigil_ako_seing_the_current_senatorial_results/,Gigil ako seing the current senatorial results,"I am really sick of how Filipino treats elections. 

First of all, hearing from a close relative, ""Bat ka pa boboto, 'di ka naman bibigyan ng pera ng mga yan."" Election is not about money. Maybe they cannot give me money because they was supposed to give us more than just money. I believe that a right candidates can do many things, not for me personally, but for our country.

Secondly I think we really should not look at candidates as a rooster in a cockfighting match. They are not contestant that we vote to make bets on, we should not support them as if they were gods or as if we are allied of those who we vote for. We are not their allies, we are Filipinos, we must not let any political party or any candidate take over our citizenship. Who we vote for or support is not a flag that we should wave in pride; instead why don't we try acting as is we are a hiring manager looking for the 'best' person for the job? Some voters do not even know the duty and responsibilities of senators, how can they even be able to pick the best fit for the position. We are not a fan or a supporter we are Filipino citizen who must be a critical voter.

And lastly, I stand firm on this. To vote is a responsibility, and it is not optional. Why do some treat voting as if it was a creamer for a coffee---optional. As a citizen of this nation, you have a right to vote and it is your responsibility to excercise that right. Your vote matters! One vote matter! It same as the saying ""hindi mabubuo ang isang libo kung walang piso,"" so please do vote, even if it is hard, even it seems like there was no good fit for the postion, make some effort to put yourself out there, do some research and vote for the right person.

As a qoute from director Kip Oebanda says: Election is a one big joke which we must take seriously. 

Maraming bumoboto nang walang pake, maraming bumoboto para sa manok nila, pero¬†¬† sana marami ring bumoto nang marunong at may baong talino, sana marami pa ring bumoto para sa Pilipinas at hindi para sa kandidato.¬†¬†

When he heard the news, he ran to stop the wedding without hesitation.  
With swollen eyes, I sat alone in the living room all night.  
By morning, I received a call from an unfamiliar number.  
""Isabella Bennett, marry me.""  
Hearing that nonchalant tone, I instantly pictured the man.  
The very Playboy my boyfriend's precious was supposed to marry.  
""Your fianc√© stole my bride,"" he laughed with mischief.  
""So I'm here to steal his. So fair, right?""  
I finally received the long-awaited proposal.  
But not from the man I‚Äôd been waiting seven years for.  
I wiped away the last tear and said calmly, ""I am willing to marry you.""

Isabella had known Dominic for ten years. And she had fallen hard for him at first sight.

It was at the opening ceremony of their first year of high school. Dominic stood at the podium as the student representative.

Sunlight filtered through the hall's floor-to-ceiling windows, casting a golden halo around his sharply defined profile.

Girls throughout the auditorium whispered excitedly as they snuck photos.

But Isabella just stood in the shadows at the back of the hall.

Back then, Dominic was the golden boy of the high school.

Always top of his class, winning gold medals in competitions, even the way he rolled up his sleeves playing basketball exuded that subtle hint of cedar cologne‚Äîevery gesture screaming old money and privilege.

She was different worlds apart from him, just an ordinary scholarship student.

And this boy that every girl in school worshipped? His eyes only ever followed one person.

Chloe Winslow, his childhood sweetheart.

Isabella had witnessed him organizing Chloe's notes in the library, seen him drape his jacket over Chloe when she got caught in the rain, watched him search the entire city for a limited-edition CD Chloe had casually mentioned.

Later, she heard their families were old friends with an arranged marriage in the works.

Then came the summer after graduation, news broke that the Hinton Group had collapsed overnight.

The same Mr. Hinton who once drove a Rolls-Royce to parent-teacher conferences had jumped from the Hinton tower.

The next day, Chloe flew off to France.

Dominic was left alone to shoulder the immense debt, working tirelessly every day to repay it. His life became a blur of exhaustion and despair.

That night, Isabella found Dominic passed out drunk in an alley behind a bar.

His expensive shirt was wrinkled and his eyes bloodshot‚Äîlike an abandoned dog.

She crouched down to help him. But he grabbed her wrist, the stench of alcohol and blood hitting her face.

""Who are you?""

""Isabella Bennett,"" she whispered. ""We go to the same school. You probably don't remember...""

He didn't remember at all.

But he let her take him home anyway.

That night, Dominic was like a feral animal. He pinned her to the narrow bed in her tiny studio apartment and kissed her until her lips went numb.

Later, she knew that just thirty minutes before she found him, Chloe had updated her Instagram‚Äî

A photo showing her kissing her new boyfriend beneath the Eiffel Tower.

The next morning, Dominic offered to take responsibility for her.

Eventually, he moved into her cramped 200-square-foot studio. They held each other for warmth, surviving the toughest days together.

But Isabella knew, even though she'd rescued this fallen prince, his heart was never truly hers.

He never forgot Chloe.

She'd caught him staring at Chloe's photos in the middle of the night, watched him eat nothing but sandwich for three straight months to save for a plane ticket to Paris, seen him rush out the door on her birthday after receiving a text from Chloe.

Yet she remained hopelessly devoted.

She stayed up with him revising his resume, accompanied him as he dropped off job applications door-to-door, faced off with debt collectors.

During their toughest times, she secretly sold the only gold ring her mother had left her, just to buy him a decent suit for interviews.

Eventually, he started remembering she liked sugar in her coffee. He would text her to remind her to eat dinner while she worked late and gently drape a coat over her when she fell asleep.

She thought she'd finally thawed his frozen heart.

Meanwhile, he rose from the ashes, becoming once again the darling prince of high society.

Just when everything seemed to be heading in the right direction, Chloe returned from France.

And everything went back to square one.

He'd race his car to the airport at midnight to pick her up.

He‚Äôd throw a welcome-back party for her like nothing ever happened.

And the moment he heard she was getting married? He dropped everything to crash it without hesitation.

Seven years Isabella had given him everything, and still it couldn't compete with Chloe's simple ""I'm back.""

Finally, she was exhausted. Her love had run dry.

Isabella stood up and started packing.

One by one, everything went into garbage bags.

The garbage truck happened to pull up just then. She watched as workers tossed her bags onto the truck‚Äîalong with seven years of foolish dreams.

""What are you throwing away?""

The front door suddenly swung open, and Dominic's voice came from behind her.

Isabella didn't turn around, her voice eerily calm. ""Just some useless stuff.‚Äù

Then she looked up at him. ""Just cleaning the house. Got rid of things that didn‚Äôt matter anymore.‚Äù

Those few simple words made Dominic's expression change instantly. He shoved her aside and charged into the house.

""Who gave you permission to touch my things?!""

He ransacked the place, his face growing darker by the second.

After tearing apart the entire study without finding what he was looking for, he bolted outside.

As they passed each other, Dominic accidentally knocked Isabella down.

She stumbled, smashing her forehead against the doorframe. Blood immediately streamed down her face.

Worried he'd lost something important, she didn't even stop to treat her wound before rushing after him.

Then she witnessed the most absurd scene of her life‚Äî

Dominic Hinton, the same man with severe germaphobia‚Äîwas on his knees in a pile of garbage, frantically digging through garbage.

Seeing his desperation, guilt welled up inside her.

‚ÄúThe garbage truck already took everything. It‚Äôs at the dump by now. I swear, it was all mine‚ÄîI probably mixed in some of your stuff by accident. I‚Äôm... I‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù

Only then did Dominic notice her injury.

He froze and reached toward her face, then pulled back. ""I was in a hurry. I didn‚Äôt mean to.""

Once they were both in the car, Isabella finally asked. ""What did you lose? Was it important?""

Dominic gripped the steering wheel tightly. He was quiet for a long time.

‚ÄúIt was a necklace. I used to send it out for cleaning every month.‚Äù

Isabella‚Äôs breath caught, tears welling in her eyes.

That necklace was the token Dominic and Chloe had exchanged when they got engaged.

No wonder he was so desperate.

The tension inside the car thickened into silence.

Dominic noticed her shift in mood. He knewthere was no hiding the wedding incident from her, so he offered a half-hearted explanation.

""Before Chloe's grandfather died, I promised him I'd look after her. You know Lucas Montgomery. If Chloe married him, her life would be ruined. That's why I had to stop the wedding.""

These were just empty excuses to pacify Isabella.

The real reason he crashed the wedding was because he still had feelings for Chloe and couldn't stand watching her marry someone else.

And his desperate search for that necklace, a token that hadn‚Äôt meant anything legally for years‚Äîwas because deep down, he believed he should be the one marrying Chloe.

The thought twisted something sharp inside Isabella.

She turned her face toward the window, letting the tears fall silently.

""Well, Lucas has found someone new. He won't be bothering Chloe anymore. You can relax.""

Hearing her confident tone, Dominic's brow furrowed. ‚ÄúLucas found someone new? Who told you that?‚Äù

Isabella was about to tell him that she was the bride.

But just then, his jarring ringtone cut through the car.

The moment he answered, Chloe's sob came through the line.

""Dominic, my parents are furious I ran off. They're making me kneel and threatening corporal punishment. I‚Äôm gonna die in there! What should I do?""

""I'm coming right now!"" he barked.

He hung up quickly and turned to Isabella. ""Isabella, something's come up. Can you go look for the necklace first?""

Isabella opened her mouth, but no sound came out.

She nodded silently. Then she opened the car door and stepped out alone.

After watching his car disappear into the darkness, she hailed a Uber to the dump.

The garbage truck had already emptied its load. Looking at mountains of garbage under the dim lights, she rolled up her sleeves.

Fighting through the stench, she spent five grueling hours before finding her discarded things.

After turning every box upside down, she still couldn't find the necklace.

Then the housekeeper called.

""Miss Bennett, we found the necklace. It was under Mr. Hinton's pillow. Must‚Äôve slipped there while he was sleeping.‚Äù

Isabella let out a bitter laugh.

How deep must his love be to sleep with that necklace, holding onto memories even in his dreams?

And they'd shared that same bed every night, yet she'd never noticed.

Night had fallen completely. With no taxis in the remote area, she had to walk home.

Dawn was breaking, her feet bloodied and legs swollen, when she finally reached the house.

She'd left in such a hurry she'd forgotten her keys. Too tired to even knock, she leaned against the door and passed out.

Some time later, Isabella was awakened by someone.

Still groggy, she opened her eyes to see Dominic's assistant standing over her. He was clearly anxious.

""Miss Bennett, Mr. Hinton is in trouble. Please come to the hospital right away!""

Isabella's mind was foggy, unable to process what was happening before being pulled into a car.

The cold autumn wind brought her back to her senses, and she finally thought to ask what had happened.

The assistant looked uneasy, hesitating before pulling out his phone to show her a video.

""Mr. Hinton went to the Winslow estate yesterday. He offered to take Miss Winslow's punishment. They gave him one hundred lashes. He passed out afterward and was taken to the hospital.""

In the video, Isabella watched as the man who once would rather lose a hand to loan sharks than drop to his knees‚Äîwas now on his knees before Chloe's parents, taking the punishment meant for her.

Blood soaked through his shirt, wounds crisscrossed and torn open.

Each strike of the whip seemed to land on Isabella‚Äôs , leaving her gasping for air.

The assistant parked the car and escorted her to the hospital room.",1,1747052359.0,Contemporary_Romance,0,1.0,False

1kkr1ia,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1kkr1ia/what_makes_the_blackdecker_cm618_the_ultimate/,What makes the BLACK+DECKER CM618 the ultimate single-serve coffee maker review?,"Testing out kitchen gadgets, especially coffee makers, is practically second nature to me, and I had the opportunity to put the BLACK+DECKER CM618 Single Serve Coffee Maker through its paces. Since mornings aren‚Äôt complete without a cup of coffee, I decided to see if this compact coffeemaker could keep up with my caffeine habit‚Äîor if it would fizzle out under the pressure. It holds promise with features like a compact design, reusable filter, and travel mug compatibility, but as always, there are small details worth discussing.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing that struck me about this coffee maker was its size. It‚Äôs small‚Äîmeasuring just 5.47""D x 6.14""W x 9.41""H‚Äîwhich means it fits practically anywhere. My apartment kitchen is already tight on counter space, yet this little machine slid right in next to my toaster without any fuss. Its black plastic finish looks modern enough, though it‚Äôs not going to scream ‚Äúluxury.‚Äù For a utilitarian appliance, it does its job without being gaudy. The included 16-ounce travel mug is a nice addition and fits most car cup holders snugly. My morning commute is just a little easier when I can brew straight into the mug and hit the road without transferring coffee or risking spills mid-pour.  

[Ready for BLACK+DECKER CM618? Amazon might have a deal.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b008ys1wxe/)  

**Ease of Use**  
What really sold me initially was how simple it is to operate. There‚Äôs no tricky interface‚Äîjust a single button. You hit it, and the coffee brews. It‚Äôs as straightforward as it gets, perfect for groggy early mornings when my brain is still rebooting. The permanent grounds filter meant I didn‚Äôt need to stock up on disposable filters, which is both economical and environmentally friendly. Cleaning is a breeze too. The filter basket is removable, and a quick rinse in the sink is usually all it takes to have it fresh and ready for the next use.  

**Performance and Coffee Quality**  
This coffee maker gets points for heating water to an optimal brewing temperature, ensuring the coffee doesn‚Äôt come out tasting like dishwater. It brews directly into the included travel mug, which I‚Äôve found keeps my coffee warm for a decent amount of time. Flavor-wise, it‚Äôs surprisingly good for something so compact. Of course, it doesn‚Äôt compare to a high-end espresso machine or a pour-over setup, but for a single-serve, drip-style cup of coffee, it punches above its weight. Even pre-ground coffee comes out tasting fresh and balanced.  

**Who Is This For?**  
I‚Äôd say this coffeemaker is designed with students, busy professionals, or anyone who lives alone in mind. Its one-mug philosophy works perfectly for people who don‚Äôt need or want a full pot of coffee and prefer a quick, no-nonsense brew. This machine is also great for travelers or those living in dorms, as its lightweight build and compact design make it portable and unobtrusive.  

**Highlights**  
- Compact design perfect for small spaces like dorms or tiny kitchens.  
- Includes a convenient 16-ounce travel mug, ideal for commuters.  
- Comes with a reusable filter, reducing waste and saving money over time.  
- Hassle-free, one-touch operation makes it beginner-friendly.  

**Shortcomings**  
While this coffeemaker has a lot to love, it does come with a few quirks worth mentioning:  
- The build, although compact, feels a bit lightweight and less sturdy compared to higher-end models.  
- The 16-ounce capacity might not suit heavy coffee drinkers who want multiple cups at once.  
- The black plastic finish, while sleek, isn‚Äôt the most durable long-term.

**Competitive Options**  
In the crowded world of compact coffee makers, there are a few rivals worth considering. For instance, the Keurig K-Mini offers similar portability but relies on K-cups instead of reusable filters, making it slightly less eco-friendly (though arguably more convenient for some users). The Hamilton Beach FlexBrew also competes well, as it allows greater flexibility between pods and grounds, but it‚Äôs bulkier in design. The BLACK+DECKER CM618, however, excels in simplicity and affordability, particularly for budget-conscious buyers willing to sacrifice a bit of aesthetic appeal for practicality.  

**Bang for the Buck**  
When you compare this model to others in its price range, it‚Äôs an impressive contender. Sure, it skips out on fancy features like digital displays or preset brew strengths, but that simplicity keeps costs low while still delivering a functional, reliable product. If the goal is to have a compact, single-serve coffee maker without breaking the bank, this fits the bill perfectly. While it doesn‚Äôt cater to coffee snobs looking for artisanal brewing methods, it‚Äôs an excellent option for people looking for convenience and usability.

1kkr0pr,https://www.reddit.com/r/appliances101/comments/1kkr0pr/does_elite_gourmet_egc115b_egg_cooker_deliver/,Does Elite Gourmet EGC115B Egg Cooker Deliver Perfect Results? Comprehensive Review Inside!,"**Elite Gourmet EGC115B: My Personal Experience with the Easy Egg Cooker**

Using the Elite Gourmet EGC115B Easy Egg Cooker has become a consistent part of my morning routine. From the first use, the convenience and simplicity of this egg cooker stood out to me, and I‚Äôve enjoyed testing its features. Though small in size, it delivers on its promise, preparing eggs quickly and effortlessly. I'll break down my experiences to help anyone curious about adding this kitchen gadget to their lineup.

**Design and Build: Compact and Practical**

The first thing that struck me about the Easy Egg Cooker was its compact size. The lightweight plastic body with its sleek black finish fits perfectly into my small kitchen without taking up too much counter space. For someone who doesn‚Äôt like clutter, this was a big win. Its dimensions, just 6.25"" x 6.25"" x 5.75"", make it super easy to slide into a drawer or display on the counter without being obtrusive. The transparent lid adds a stylish touch while allowing you to watch your eggs cook, even if it feels a bit thin. Overall, it‚Äôs both functional and aesthetically pleasing.

**Ease of Use: Straightforward and Family-Friendly**

I‚Äôll admit I was a little hesitant when I first unpacked it. Would it really be as simple as advertised? Spoiler alert: it is. Using the pre-marked measuring cup, I just fill it with the right amount of water depending on if I want soft, medium, or hard-boiled eggs, pour it onto the heating plate, add eggs, and press a button. That‚Äôs it! The auto shut-off function is genius; it makes cooking foolproof, even if you‚Äôre distracted by other kitchen tasks (or in my case, a barking dog).

[Check Elite Gourmet EGC115B price on Amazon.](https://applianceheaven.com/link/b0c5hrjhgl/)

**Cooking Results: Perfect Eggs Every Time**

This egg cooker can handle up to seven eggs at once. I tested all levels of doneness, and I‚Äôm happy to report that soft, medium, and hard-boiled eggs all turned out perfectly consistent. The shells peeled off effortlessly, which is always a struggle for me with stovetop boiling. The included piercing pin works to ensure no cracked eggs and vibrant yolks. I also tested the steaming function for vegetables‚Äîit works decently but isn‚Äôt as quick as other dedicated steamers I‚Äôve used. That said, it‚Äôs valuable having that versatility.

**Positives**

- Convenience for busy mornings  
- Compact and lightweight design  
- Cooks seven eggs at a time  
- Simple and foolproof operation with a measuring cup  
- Auto shut-off prevents overcooking  

**Flaws**

- Lid feels a little fragile  
- Steaming performance for veggies could be improved  
- Limited capacity for larger households  

**Performance and Time-Saving:**  

Compared to boiling eggs on the stovetop, this product is a lifesaver. I timed how long it took to make hard-boiled eggs: around 10 minutes. At the same time, I could get my morning coffee ready without worrying about overcooking. The measuring cup is precise, so there‚Äôs no guesswork involved. However, this isn‚Äôt the most silent appliance I‚Äôve used‚Äîit emits a slight whistling sound when heating, which might bother light sleepers.

**Maintenance and Cleaning**  

Cleanup is quick and hassle-free. Since the parts that come in contact with food‚Äîlike the tray and lid‚Äîare dishwasher safe, I usually toss them into the dishwasher. For the heating plate, a simple wipe with a damp cloth is sufficient if residue appears. It‚Äôs less effort than scrubbing a big saucepan after boiling eggs, that‚Äôs for sure.

**Use Cases and Who It's Perfect For**

If you‚Äôre someone juggling busy mornings, this product was practically designed for you. College students, single folks, or families who enjoy boiled eggs will appreciate how much simpler this makes breakfast prep. Given its small size, I can see it being ideal for apartments or dorm rooms where counter space is premium. However, families of four or more might find the seven-egg capacity limiting‚Äîthough you can always cook in batches.

**Competitive Options**

I've used other egg cookers before, such as the Dash Rapid Egg Cooker, which offers similar features. The Dash model has an edge in terms of color variety and a slightly faster cook time, but I found its build quality less durable than this one. Another competitor, the Cuisinart Egg Central, offers larger capacity but takes up considerably more counter space. For its balance of size, features, and effectiveness, the Elite Gourmet product holds its ground well.

**Quality for Price**

Given the product‚Äôs usefulness and time-saving potential, this egg cooker feels worth the price. You‚Äôre investing in simplicity, especially when comparing it to stovetop egg boiling or pricier competing models. It‚Äôs not a gadget for advanced chefs, but it brings value to daily life. Spending a few bucks to save time and ensure consistently good eggs feels like a smart buy in my book.

Just comment and I‚Äôll provide the link.","Ten years ago, he put a knife to his neck and announced to his parents that he would marry only me.  
Ten years later, he took up the knife again just to force me to apologize to his mistress.  
The boy who had sworn never to betray was now protecting another woman.  
It wasn't until then that I realized ten years of marriage had come to an end.  
‚ÄúLet's end this.‚Äù

""I don‚Äôt agree with the divorce!""

Thane rejected my request without a second thought.

He frowned slightly, glancing down at Lily, who he still held protectively in his arms. Seeming to realize something, he slowly released her. But he kept her safely behind him, guarding her as if I might hurt her.

The knife he gripped in his hand‚Äîits tip remained pointed at me, cold and cutting.

""Sophie, I promise you, Lily won't affect your standing at all.""

After a pause, he continued: ""But you must promise me you won't cause any more trouble for her.""

The ""trouble"" Thane referred to?

Just like‚Äîthe clear, humiliating handprint now visible on Lily's face.

If Thane had arrived any later, I might have grabbed Lily's hair and smashed her face against the coffee table, using the shattered glass from the broken water cup to cut up her face and hands, ensuring she'd never show herself to me again.

Insane and vicious thoughts.

But I used to be a person with stable emotions. For years, I rarely argued with anyone, let alone fought physically.

Acting so recklessly, lashing out like this‚Äîwas unprecedented for me.

I looked back at my two children, hiding in the bedroom but stubbornly peeking through a crack in the door‚Äîmy Emma and Noah.

Their faces still showed visible pinch marks, all thanks to Lily. So I couldn't control myself to hit her.

Thane was clearly shocked by my behavior. The young woman he'd been spoiling for over a year now covered her swollen face, crying to him about my cruelty.

And that boy who once promised never to let me down?

With fury in his eyes, ignoring our children's cries, he grabbed the knife from the counter when I tried to lunge at her again. He pressed it against my throat, demanding I calm down.

Yet once before, he had pressed that same knife to his own throat, telling his parents he would marry no one but me. That's how we got married, had our lovely children, and completed our family.

Unfortunately, both things and people have all changed.

""Sophie, we've been married for ten years. Our lives are too intertwined. Even if we die, we must die together, understand?""

Thane's eyes were determined as he spoke, completely missing Lily's resentful gaze.

She wanted my place‚Äîotherwise, this year-long affair, hidden so carefully by Thane, protected by my absolute trust in him, I should never have discovered it.

But Lily deliberately sought me out.

This girl whom Thane and I had jointly supported through school showed up boldly at my door with photo after photo of herself with Thane.

""Sophie, I'm grateful to you and Thane for supporting my education.""

""But let's be clear: gratitude is one thing, love is another.""

""So this doesn't mean I have to give Thane back to you.""

""I know you and Thane have been married for years, but you're older now, no longer fresh.""

""I'm just twenty‚Äîyoung and beautiful. What do you have to compete with me?""

""You guys probably don't even do it more than once a month, right?""

""But do you know what?""

""When Thane's with me, we do it every night.""

""He says he can't resist me.""

""Sophie, does Thane still feel that way about you?""

‚Ä¶

Every word cut through me like a knife.

That day was the most devastating of my entire life that I can't bear to remember it anymore.

So I just looked at Thane and repeated my earlier words.

""Thane, let's set each other free, okay?""

At that moment‚Äîoutside, ice cream truck is blaring its jingle in the sweltering heat.

In a daze, I remembered that summer when I was sixteen with the same suffocating heat and the same ice cream truck.

That day, Thane Cole, a transfer student, caught my attention when our teacher introduced him to the class.

Sunlight streamed through the windows, a gentle breeze lifted the edges of his crisp white shirt‚Äîit's a heart-pounding moment at first sight.

As class pre//sident, it was my responsibility to help new students get familiar with our class. So we had a reason to interact.

Back then, I only knew he was Thane Cole and came from New York City, with his family probably well-off. Maybe he was too rebellious, or maybe he'd done something wrong, and that's why he'd been sent to our small town.

But I didn't care about any of that. I just knew I needed to follow the teacher's instructions and help him integrate into our class.

Of course, I had my own little secret thoughts too‚Äîhe was simply too charming.

I've never claimed to be particularly deep. I've always paid extra attention to beautiful people and things.

Maybe it's just fate? Thane and I sat next to each other for three years, gradually evolving from slightly awkward classmates to best friends who shared everything. And then those occasional moments when our eyes met‚Äî

I felt my heart race, saw the tips of his ears turn red, and something unspoken grew between us.

A tacitly understanding, you could say.

After graduation, he presented me with my favorite lilies and asked if I dared to be his classmate for another four years.

I, Sophie Sutton, had never been afraid of anything. Four more years as classmates? Why would I be afraid of that?

So that summer, we applied to the same college and moved to the same unfamiliar city.

I think‚Ä¶ I have found love.

Those four college years were peaceful and happy. We never let go of each other's hands.

Until graduation day, a wealthy, bejeweled woman approached me. She introduced herself as Thane's mother, making it clear she looked down on me, explaining how the Cole family was enormously wealthy and influential. So when selecting a daughter-in-law, they had to be extremely careful.

Social compatibility was paramount. A plain girl from a small town like me shouldn't try to change her social status through marriage, dreaming of an overnight ascension.

Just like in the TV dramas, she pushed a blank check toward me, grandly telling me to fill in any amount I wanted.

But unlike the TV dramas, I didn't even have time to react. Thane, having heard about the meeting, rushed over.

That check I hadn't even properly seen?

It scattered into the air like confetti before my eyes.

That day, Thane held my hand so tightly, as if afraid I might waver, repeatedly telling me:

""Sophie, a check doesn't amount to much. As long as you don't let go of my hand, I'll give you anything you want.""

At that time, all I could think was‚Äî

Thane, I don't want your money. I only want your wholehearted love.

We were young and passionate then, believing love was everything and Thane was my everything.

It wasn't until years later that I realized just how wrong I'd been.

Later, all I remember from that afternoon was Thane arguing furiously with his mother, his face flushed red. In the end, he grabbed a knife from the bar counter and pressed it against his own throat.

Leaving a clear and long blood mark, he said resolutely and firmly: ""I'm not like my father. I'm not full of tricks. In this life, I only want to be with Sophie. Mom, I hope you can accept us.""

Perhaps Thane was too resolute or perhaps that streak of red was too shocking. In the end, Mrs. Cole compromised.

But as she left that day, there was something in her gaze I couldn't quite understand.

But I didn't understand then, I just thought every family had their issues.

My parents loved each other, but they were still traditional at heart, favoring my brother over me.

And Thane's parents were once a loving couple too. But the Cole family had a tradition of sponsoring underprivileged children's education.

That young, timid, yet charming girl caught Mr. Cole's eye, he finally fell for her.

Affairs, mistresses, more affairs, more mistresses.

After tasting the sweetness of indulgence, he couldn't stop. Women came and went, each more numerous than before.

A life of luxury and excess is always full of temptations. Mr. Cole, in his position of power, began to enjoy this decadence, growing more distant from Mrs. Cole.

Arguments? Crying? Threats? None of it worked. They fought year after year, until one of his mistresses showed up at their door with a barely visible pregnancy bump, begging Mrs. Cole to spare her life.

Thane watched his mother's tears, then looked at that woman who seemed pitiful but truly hateful. He reached out and pushed the woman down the stairs, blood staining the doorstep.

Mr. Cole was furious and sent him away to attend school in his hometown.

Then that's how Thane and I met, connected, and fell in love.

But ultimately?

Thane, who once despised homewreckers, fell in love with Lily, the scholarship student we sponsored, even buying her a million-dollar home.

So it wasn't until many years later that I understood‚Äîthat day, the look in Mrs. Cole's eyes wasn't born from being moved by our love or from compromise, but a pure pity.

It's a family curse‚Äîlike father, like son‚Äîit's a never-ending loop. She had always been warning me not to repeat her mistakes.

But unfortunately‚Äî

By the time I understood, it was too late.

As expected, Thane didn't agree to my request for divorce.

We met when we were sixteen, started dating at nineteen, married at twenty-five, had our first child at twenty-six and our second child at twenty-nine. Now at thirty-six, we were deeply intertwined, both emotionally and financially. So he refused to divorce me.

A wife and children at home, a fragile lover outside‚ÄîThane wanted to maintain this arrangement.

I mean, just think about it. If we divorced, those shares he gave me when he loved me most? They'd really mess him up financially and would severely weaken his position.

The Cole family had ambitious illegitimate sons and Thane wasn't the only heir.

But I couldn't give up everything and just leave with the children either. I must take what belongs to me.

So we reached an impasse.

Just like now, Thane again suggested I calm down while he took Lily away.

Lily had several bloody marks on her arm. One was deep enough to expose bone‚ÄîI'd cut her with the glass.

Thane sighed and said: ""Sophie, stay home and calm down. We can talk about anything later.""

Then he left with Lily.",1,1747052074.0,Contemporary_Romance,0,1.0,False

# Training

2024 was my most consistent running year ever, until I got Covid in September. I struggled since then to get back to consistently running 5-6 days a week. 

I began training for a June 22 half marathon with a 15 week 80/20 Endurance plan (level 1) with this 10k race falling in week 9. I aim for strength training twice a week but usually only get one session in. 

While I missed a workout here and there, I mostly managed to stay on schedule. The final two weeks before the race are longer mileage (I hit 41km two weeks out) but I ended up sick the week before the race, which acted like a taper. I hadn‚Äôt planned to taper, just run the race as a tune up, but when I got sick I decided I might as well ‚Äúrace‚Äù the race not just run it. I figured there was a good chance I‚Äôd run out of gas before the end of the race if I was running under 6 min pace, but decided to try anyway.

# Pre-race

I was travelling for work four days before the race and spent 7+hours on my feet on a concrete floor. I wanted to do a short shake out run the day before the race, but it poured rain-torrential buckets of rain-so I settled for a few walking laps of the mall. I napped for an hour in the afternoon at the hotel, ate a lovely Mac and cheese for supper. Drank lots of water along with an electrolyte drink before bed, and a banana. 

Slept quite well. Woke up 1.5 hours before the race and ate granola, yogurt, berries, and half a bagel with PB. Ate a banana just before leaving for the race. More water and an electrolyte drink too, and two cups of coffee, which is my norm. 

# Race
This is a small race, generally speaking, with a course mostly on narrow trails. Around 3000 people signed up this year, so instead of a single start for marathon, half marathon, and 10k, they started the longer distances first, then the 10k 15 minutes later, to avoid congestion. I jogged, did some plyo and dynamic stretches, hit the Porta potty and lined up between the 55 minute and 1 hr pacers. 

The rain had thankfully stopped,but there was a strong strong wind. I knew it was going to be a factor in the open areas of trail and on the two bridge crossings. 

The first km is always congested as the race heads for the first bridge crossing. Staying at a conservative pace, I hit the wind and the ‚Äúuphill‚Äù on ramp and kept going. I had to remove my hat until we were back on the trails, the wind was determined to tear it off. It was a cross wind in the bridges.

I slowly accelerated through the next 8km on the trails. Several times I got ‚Äústuck‚Äù and wasn‚Äôt able to pass folks, though it wasn‚Äôt ever for very long. There is a turn around Km 7 where the course travels down a section of trail, does a u turn, and comes back. The half marathoners are also on this section of trail. The last two years this wasn‚Äôt a problem but it was really crowded this year.

The congestion got me in km 9 - I got stuck and couldn‚Äôt pass folks. The combination of coming back into the wind and the end of the race had lots of people dropping off and there wasn‚Äôt room.  My 9k split was frustrating. 

The last km travels back across the river on a walking bridge, then to the finish line- but the final 200m was straight into that headwind! I was sucking air at this point, even though the legs felt ok, and powered through for a PR. I‚Äôd set the PR on this same course in 2024 in perfect conditions (1:00:25) so I was pretty pleased with the results 


# Post-race

Picked up my medal, took the obligatory selfie, congratulated the premier (I had passed her on KM 8) and headed back to the hotel for a shower and change. Had a lovely full English second breakfast, then drove 1.5 hours home for a nap.  A bit of fatigue in the legs but nothing major. ",1,1747051922.0,XXRunning,0,1.0,False

I told her once that i am afraid that her extreme sociality can expose our relationship to unnecessary risks and i told her what if she loses herself around with some guys when she is traveling and she sleeps with him or something like that.

She brusted into tears and told me how can you possibly imagine that i might sleep with someone else. This is something not acceptable for me and i will never do that.

I (early 20s F) just recently started a new service industry job about 2 months ago. My assistant manager (early 40s M), who is also married, has always been very flirtatious. At the beginning this didn‚Äôt bother me, I figured it was probably just his personality but stayed on alert for anything that seemed odd. One morning when it was maybe my 2nd week at the new job, I asked my manager if he wanted a coffee. I wasn‚Äôt trying to make any advances by doing this if anything I was just maybe thinking id get some brownie points at the most. I see now where I should not have done this. A few weeks later he brings me coffee into work as well, starts giving me a perfect schedule, tells me I can have free food whenever I want as long as I don‚Äôt tell anyone, started telling me I was beautiful everyday. He ended up touching my butt twice one day in the office when no one else was watching. I didn‚Äôt know what to do. I froze and walked out. When I went to head home he followed me out and asked if I had a second. He pulled me back into the office and basically said something along the lines of ‚ÄúI just realized I touched your butt and I don‚Äôt want you to be uncomfortable I‚Äôm sorry‚Äù I again froze. It did make me uncomfortable but I just brushed it off and said ‚ÄúI just assumed it was an accident‚Äù.  He did not agree that it was an accident. I had no idea what to do. Beyond this uncomfortable situation, I really like my new job and didn‚Äôt want to mess that up. Hes been giving me a perfect schedule and being nice and whatever (I understand now that this is grooming) and I didn‚Äôt want to ruin his life or my new job and I also thought I was the only one. A few weeks later, (now) I finally got closer with some of the other young women at my job and finally felt like I could say something to them about it. Two of them said he‚Äôs been doing the exact same thing to them. One of them even said he would touch her boobs or butt every single day for a month until something happened and he just stopped. This girl and I ended up having at least an hour long conversation about it and trying to figure out what we should do. Go to management, sue, do nothing. I said I wanted to go to upper management. Meaning skipping the GM and going straight to the big guys. The issue now is that I have no physical proof of what he‚Äôs done. No text messages or anything he‚Äôs smart and only does stuff in person. The other girls fear losing their jobs and ruining his life and therefore don‚Äôt want to speak up against him. After she and I had this long conversation that did not come to a conclusion, my manager follows me out to my car when I‚Äôm leaving again and asks if he can take me out sometime.  I respond ‚Äúno, you‚Äôre married‚Äù and gave him a dirty look. He rambled a bit and then left me alone and I went home. I need this to stop. My main motivating factor is that these other girls not speaking up is why it happened to me. Over my dead body is he gonna get away with doing it to me and then do it to another girl. However, I also really like my new job and so that makes it difficult for me as well. Plus, not having the other girls to back me up could just make it look like I‚Äôm lying. What is my best course of action in getting him to stop and never touch another one of his employees again? Is it worth just sitting down with him? Or do I have to go to upper management?

Every morning when I wake up I have a coffee on the balcony and they will make a cup of tea/coffee and come sit with me, proceeding to freaking INHALE their tea combined with the classic slurp and ""AAaaaahh"" exhale. I understand they just want to spent time with me but this is kicking off my day with lots of stress. Then there's eating, snacking (crunchy things like chips or nuts), exhaling after drinking but also continuously during the day when not even eating, my dad scraping his plates, breathing loudly, mom loves to lick her fingers after every bite, it's trigger upon trigger and I'm struggling to spend time with them without having an angry outburst.

I've resorted to eating in a separate spot when I can sneak off casually and they seem to think I'm antisocial for that, I have had miso since I was about 10 years old but even when I figured out it is an actual disorder later on and tried explaining it to them they always trivialized it (i.e.""you're too sensitive""/""you chew too""/""just stop being annoyed""/etc.). I can feel my tolerance battery is already nearly drained and I still need to last for about a tenday. Thinking of using earphones and trying to hide them discreetly under my hair or something. I really don't want to have this conversation again where I try to explain this is a neurological thing and I can't help it, only for them to tell me I am being dramatic - turning on the radio extra loudly, moving to the opposite corner of the table, or running to the bathroom, nothing helps. When my mom goes to the kitchen I get instant anxiety, seeing what food or drink she gets and bracing myself for the oncoming assault on my senses. 

I wish I was deaf or could just ask people to not eat, chew and breathe so loudly (or plainly unnecessarily!) but I suppose there's nothing I can do besides grin and bear it... This is making me rethink visiting my fam again (they live in another country) which is sad, I wanna spend time with them but I am struggling to be a pleasant person now. I can't wait to be back in my own space again so I can actually enjoy eating and feel relaxed, rather than so wound up!

 I guess this is more of a vent but if you can relate or have tips any comments are welcome..

Like the kitchen clutter they released, putting the cereal box on a counter in the corner, makes that counter unusable to cook, and you either remove the cereal box, or add another counter, which for very small house lots, makes you consider space even more.

I (35M) started running late 2023 for the health benefits and to lose some weight ( at the time i was 98 kg ), got hooked and ran a total of 2600km's in 2024 ending the year with my first marathon on 15th of December with a time of 3 hours and 31 minutes. After the marathon I stopped training almost entirely because it was Christmas break. 2 days after Christmas my mom suffered a heart attack and almost died, that was a big stressor. I also work a sitting job and had more work then usual so in January 2025 i basically worked 10+ hours, drinking too much coffee and not enough water probably, with only about 3k steps a day taken ( 5k at most ). Around 12th of January started feeling a bit under the weather but nothing worth going to the doctor, really light fever ( 37.2 C ) that wasn't even present that often, just feeling generally low energy and fatigued. That feeling kind of went away but not fully. Then from 24th of January i started feeling worse and worse. Decided to go to doctors and long story short my d-dimmer was 5.6k and i got a CT confirming a PE. They initially didn't think it was PE because i didn't have any trouble breathing, just general fatigue. But my elevated HR and my RVSP of 35 prompted them to do a CT. Was in the hospital for 7 days. After which i started digging around to find out why i got it. Did a ultrasound of the abdomen and it turns out my spleen is slightly enlarged and i have a thyroid nodule that might be cancerous ( something I am supposed to do a biopsy for in the following days ). I was also confirmed to have Hashimoto ( autoimmune thyroid issue ), and on top of that looks like i had Cytomegalo virus as well. I did the genetics tests for clotting disorders and they came back negative.

I asked my doctor if the thyroid nodule is cancerous could that be the reason for the clot and he said it's highly unlikely. He said that cancers can cause clots but for thyroid cancers specifically he said it's highly unlikely.

And here I am today trying to piece everything together to try and have less anxiety about it because I think my doctor will say to stop taking Xarellto at 3 months after being discharged. So my anxiety is creeping a bit in because I'm going to stop taking them. I upped my fluid intake and started jogging again since my clot is no longer in my leg and my pulmologist said my lungs sound clear and we did a X-ray of my lungs and she said it looks clean even though she told me to totally be sure it's clean i should do a CT but she is against unnecessary CT scans ( because of the radiation ).

That's the story in a nutshell. I think it's probably a perfect storm of things and not moving and not upping my water intake after the marathon was the first mistake which then probably lead to the cytomegalo virus and overall reduced immunity and increased inflammation. I also had the pfizer covid vaccine ( 2 shots in total ) back in 2021. I heard that covid and the vaccines as well can cause clotting but that was almost 4 years ago, so I don't think it's due to that but I also have no idea.

Does anyone have any recommendations?

1kkqrg9,https://www.reddit.com/r/MTFButch/comments/1kkqrg9/reflections_of_a_trans_dyke/,Reflections of a trans dyke,"I'm transfeminine. When I was born a doctor saw a penis and called me a boy. Everyone in my life thereafter followed that doctor's assertion. It took most of my life to realize, accept, and eventually to correct their mistake. Rejecting masculinity after very intentionally cloaking myself with it was a difficult process, to reduce it to gross understatement. But femininity, as it was presented to me, was nearly as ill-fitting.

I knew I was feminine, I knew I was not a man, but wrapping myself in the trappings of what I had been led to believe encompassed femininity felt just as performative and hollow as masculinity had. It took more work still to uncover what femininity looked like when it grew out of me, exclusively rooted in the essence of who I am. I found it in cooking, nourishing and comforting the people I cared about. I also found it in woodworking, replacing the serpentine belt in my car, black coffee, push ups, the sound of a ratchet strap being tightened.

I was terrified of the word ""butch."" It belonged to other people, whose struggles and work I should never attempt to find camaraderie in. I disallowed myself comparison and floundered. My transition stuttered, stalled, and stagnated. I had no direction but ""away"" from male, nothing to move towards, no expression that allowed me a greater feeling of completion.

But, having since found myself embraced by the queer community, having interacted with lesbians, sapphics, and dykes who worked to learn me and found my femininity emanating from the same places, who celebrated and supported those expressions, I am no longer so restricted. I am not masculine. I am butch. Soft butch, I may insist from time to time, pointing to the lengthening half of my side shave haircut or the mascara by my bathroom sink dutifully awaiting a formal occasion. But I am butch. My femininity is in creating with my hands. Fixing, repairing, supporting, making better, that's how I give, how I nurture.

When one of my girlfriends called me, stranded with a flat tire, there was no masculinity in my 3am appearance, impact wrench in hand. I was a woman bringing safety and recovery to another woman. When my friend asked if I could help, showed me her broken dresser drawer slide, I was not revealing or reverting to some hidden male-ness in bringing some tools and wood filler with me to her dinner party. Nor was there any manliness in showing another girlfriend how to use a wood lathe, repairing my mother's kitchen cabinets, or showing another friend how to aim and fire a gun. It has all been what my feminine side really looks like, how I show care.

And when earlier today a woman evaluated my worn jeans, blue flannel, beaten and revived work boots, and non-made-up face, when she dismissed my breasts and carefully feminized voice in the tenth of a second we spend gendering someone before addressing them, when she called me ""sir,"" I could feel in her voice that it wasn't because she didn't recognize my transition. It was because she couldn't comprehend my femininity.",6,1747051377.0,MTFButch,0,1.0,False
1kkqrf2,https://www.reddit.com/r/mrballen/comments/1kkqrf2/summer_2009_in_rural_mn/,Summer 2009 in rural MN,"I wrote this out in an email draft and I'll copy it here. I'm not a writer and this experience is very hard for me to articulate because none of it makes sense and it's hard to convey what we felt. But I did my best to write it out.

I'll give some back story to help explain the amount of time I've spent around animals and in the outdoors. It helps to understand how unnatural the experience was. My name is Annie and I'm now 40 years old. I was born in Montana and when my father left the Air Force (I was 4) we moved to an old farm house on 80 acres of land that was surrounded by state forest in a small town of MN. Our nearest neighbor was over a mile away and I spent my childhood climbing trees, riding horses (I barrel raced and did miles long charity rides through all kinds of back country), fishing and camping out as far as my parents would let me roam. Minnesota is home to a few large predators and seeing black bears, coyotes and red fox were common enough. Less seen but often heard were bobcats and the occasional mountain lion. 

When I was 22 I moved into a home in a near by small town with my boyfriend at the time, Adam. It was fairly secluded. I'll explain the layout of the home as it's important to the story. When you reached the end of the driveway you stopped in the front side of the house. Opening the front door you came into a landing of a stairwell. To the left the stairs went up to the main floor which was open plan kitchen, living room and dining room and one bedroom belonging to Adam's father at the front of the house. To the right the stairs descended to the finished basement level where our bedroom was straight in front of the stairs with a small bathroom to the left of that. There was a bedroom to the right of the landing at the bottom of the stairs as well which was shared by Adam's son, and my son. There was a door on the main upper level that opened out onto the back deck. Looking straight out from the deck you'd see a large field surrounded by dense forest on three sides. If you looked to the right there was an old abandoned barn (I have a picture somewhere of it) about 150 yards out with the forest creeping in around it and the yard between that and the side of the house. To the left the forest butted right up to the property maybe 20 or 30 yards. 

I spent most of my free time outdoors. I love hiking. I'd sit with my coffee and a smoke in the morning on the deck and watch the sun burn the mist off the field. There was a family of huge sandhill cranes that would walk through almost every morning with their chick in tow and you'd see deer very often. I'd walk the dirt roads on my own and honestly the only thing that ever worried me were other people. Obviously I was wary of wildlife and understood the dangers of our large predators but having grown up in the middle of the woods it's just where I was comfortable. I've always been anxious when it comes to people but the outdoors and the wildlife it comes with have just felt like home.

Until the summer I lived with Adam. I just don't go near the woods anymore except inside very, very well groomed park trails with plenty of people around and never, ever after dark. I don't even like driving through wooded areas at night.

So if my memory serves me correctly the night this happened would have been in the summer of 2009. My son was with his father for the night and Adam's father was off doing whatever  he was doing and wouldn't be back for a few days. We had dinner on the main floor and put Adam's son to sleep in his room downstairs. (Another note about downstairs is that as a finished basement the walls were thick and the floor was concrete with carpeting over it. So the floor did not creak when you walked across it. So movement in the basement was basically silent once you left the stairs.) So we put his son to sleep in his bedroom and went back up to the main floor. We cleaned up and stepped out the door on the back of the house and walked out onto the deck. 

It was totally dark by then but with the outside deck light you could see up on the deck just fine. Looking out all you could see in front was the clothes line (two metal T's with twine string between) slightly down below us in the short grass of the mowed lawn and a small bit of the long grass of the field behind it. To the left you could see nothing but the very front on the line of trees and the same to the right. You could see a bit of the barn behind the strip of lawn with the tree line creeping up asking either side and just the very front of the trees. Past that is the pitch black forest.

Fuck. So we get outside and I light a smoke and for the first few minutes it was normal. Normal sounds in the background (crickets and peeper frogs) and Adam and I are just chit chatting about our separate days and winding down before heading inside to get ready for bed. As we were talking we both just kind of got quiet and started to listen because something had changed and at first we didn't know what it was. But as we stopped taking and listened we could hear something in the trees toward the back right corner of the tree line. So  across the strip of the lawn and to the left and back side of the abandoned barn. Whatever it is, it's large and making enough noise through the underbrush that is unconcerned with being heard. At this point I noticed everything else is quiet too. No frogs, no crickets, no anything else except the sounds of whatever's moving through the trees just out of sight. As it moved up along the left side of the barn I could hear the strangest sounds I've ever heard. Like a grumbling sort of speech. In all my years being in the forest I've never heard anything like it except that night. It made my blood run cold.

At this point I turned back to Adam to see if he's hearing this too and I can tell by the look on his face he does. So I turn back toward the sounds half expecting to see a black bear come bumbling into the light. The sounds didn't add up with a bear but it had to be. But whatever it was just kept crunching around just out of sight back in the tree line. At this point I was concerned a bit. Black bears have been known to break into cabins and campsites looking for food, so I wanted to watch and try to catch a glimpse of what was hanging around as our kids do play in the yard. I'm not seeing anything and as I turn my attention back and start to say something to Adam I heard HUGE wings as something took off right from behind the trees where the sounds had been coming from. Each flap sounded like the crack of a whip and just fuckin echoed off the trees and the side of the house. The size of the wings had to be massive to produce such a shocking sound. As I'm hearing this I have this terror wash over me and I have this feeling that something very unnatural and very intelligent is aware that I'm aware of it. It's now focused on me/us, and we are NOT safe. Even though we are a bit elevated from the ground on the deck and there is a rail that runs around the edge I've never had such a sudden feeling of I'm in danger, and I'm about to die. Adam is not a small guy by any means. He's over 6 foot tall and can carry himself just fine. But regardless, there was no thought of being protected. Only get back inside the house. 

So we flew though the door and back into the house. I don't remember if we stopped to lock the door (I have to think we did right?) but I know we left the outside light on. This bit is a little embarrassing but I can't finish the story without telling it... So we ran through the living and practically threw ourselves down the stairs into the finished basement. We ran across the hall and into our bedroom and jumped into our bed like little kids and pulled the covers over our heads. We were in our 20's with children of our own but I'm that moment we were reduced to nothing but the feeling of absolute terror. So our heads are pointed toward the front of the house and our feet point toward the back of the house into the room.

None of that made me feel safe in the slightest but it was just the reaction I had. The second I got the covers over my head I remembered that there's a window in that room that looks right out into the backyard from the side of the deck. The same side we heard whatever the fuck we heard out there. It's a basement window so standing in the room looking out it is at head height, but from outside it's right at ground level by your feet. As soon as I thought of that window I did the dumb girl in the scary movie idiot move, and I pulled the covers back down and I fucking looked at the window. I wish I could go back and shove the blanket back over my face. Until this point I probably could have rationalized the whole experience away. Maybe. 

So from the time I turned to speak to Adam and heard the thing in woods take off to the time we were cowering under the covers like a couple kids after a scary movie only a few seconds had passed. The house wasn't large and I've never moved so fast in my life before or since. So when I peaked from under the covers and looked up at this window by our feet my heart fucking stopped when I saw that whatever we heard in the trees was already in the window looking in frantically to the room. That means it covered all of the ground between where it was n the woods to the back of the house in a matter of seconds. I'm not good with distance but I'd say 100 yards or so. It just wasn't physically possible even with wings. But what I was looking at didn't compute with something that had wings on it's back. So I'll do my best to describe what I saw in the window, but keep in mind that I was losing my mind in fear at this point. Nothing I had ever experienced prepared me for what was happening and I know I'm partially blocking out what I saw because I cannot describe a face to you. 

So I look up into the window and it's already there. I fucking can't be but it is. It's crouched down and window is so small that I can't really say how big it was, just that it filled the window and was blocking the majority of the light coming from the deck above. It was covered in greasy, stringy looking dark red fur. Not like a red fox but darker than that. Almost like an orangutan, but there are no great apes in Minnesota. It's hunched down pressing it's face into the window and moving in a jerking, jarring way like it's trying to see into the room we were in. I couldn't make out a face, or my memory refuses to bring back that part but I only peeked it for a second or two before yanking the blanket back over my face and trying to process what was going on.  I ran through all the animals it could be but it didn't make any sense and I'd never felt like this before. I'm not ""Can I pet that dog?"" stupid, but animals fascinated me and in normal circumstances I'd be looking out the windows to see what wildlife had wandered into the yard. But in that moment I felt like it's lose my sanity if I were to be able to see it in detail.

At this point I realized not only had it covered an impossible distance in seconds, but it immediately went to the window of the room that we had run to hide. We were not stopping to throw on lights on the way so we were in complete darkness with only the light was coming through the window this thing was looking through. I suppose it's possible it heard our flight through the house but once you hit that basement sound just didn't carry. Yet it seemed to know exactly where we had gone to inside the house and it was actively looking for us. I couldn't do anything except hide under these covers and listen, hoping I didn't hear anything breaking the window. Adam and I never spoke out loud for the rest of the entire night. At some point the fright must have turned to pure exhaustion because we fell asleep and in the morning there was just no sign that anything had happened. No animal prints or tracks, scrapes, hair or any other sign that something had been outside that window. 
I don't know how long it was there looking in but every time I got the courage to look it was there making that same jerking, spastic, scanning movement across the window. It just was not natural movement and didn't feel like normal predatory behavior.

Adam and I broke up not long after and I moved away. We never spoke about that night to each other until a few years ago we reconnected on social media and talked about what happened that night. A few years later my husband saw something in the road on the way home from work and I'm positive it was the same species or the exact same thing, but that's his story to tell.",1,1747051374.0,mrballen,0,1.0,False

A Detailed Review Awaits You,"Testing the Jura 15466 Coffee Machine over an extended period has been a rewarding journey for me. This sleek and modern machine boasts features like an integrated grinder, 3D brewing process, and an intuitive symbol interface, making it a state-of-the-art option for coffee enthusiasts. The piano black exterior gives it a premium look that fits neatly into my kitchen decor. Whether brewing a robust espresso or a refreshing cup of black coffee, this machine demonstrates incredible versatility. However, my experience revealed both highlights and hurdles that potential buyers should consider before making a decision.

**Ease of Use and Design**  
The intuitive display with symbol-based buttons was something I appreciated after getting the hang of it. At first, the learning curve was a bit steep, as I needed the manual nearby to decipher the indicators for cleaning cycles, rinse functions, and filter changes. Once I mastered these controls, preparing my morning coffee became second nature. The machine‚Äôs dimensions (11""D x 17.6""W x 13.8""H) fit comfortably on my countertop without dominating the kitchen space. However, the glossy finish, while elegant, does attract fingerprints, so I found myself wiping it down frequently to maintain its chic appearance.

**Integrated Grinder Performance**  
One of the standout features is its conical burr grinder, which delivers consistently ground coffee beans. Jura‚Äôs Professional Aroma Grinder lived up to its promise, ensuring each cup was infused with rich flavor. I did notice, however, that the grinder sometimes struggled with oilier beans, which led me to carefully choose my coffee bean selection. I leaned towards Lavazza Super Crema after hearing similar advice from other Jura owners. This decision has kept clogging issues at bay, ensuring smooth operation.

Check [Jura 15466 Coffee Machine] price on Amazon.

**Brewing Quality**  
Exploring various beverages, the Jura machine maintained its reputation for producing barista-level espresso, Americano, and plain black coffee. Thanks to features like the Pulse Extraction Process, every shot of espresso came out smooth, with a delightful crema. On certain mornings, when my husband needed his coffee strong, I played around with the strength levels indicated by the bean symbols, and they worked as advertised. Tea drinkers like me, however, might notice the hot water for tea isn‚Äôt exceptionally hot, which might be a mild deterrent for those accustomed to piping-hot servings.

**Favorable Attributes**  
- Produces exceptional barista-quality coffee and espresso.  
- Professional Aroma Grinder ensures consistency over time.  
- Fully automatic operation simplifies coffee-making.  

**Pitfalls to Consider**  
- The hot water dispenser doesn‚Äôt deliver tea-suitable temperatures.  
- Glossy exterior is prone to fingerprints.  
- Grinder may face difficulties with oilier beans.  

**Another Perspective: Product Contenders**  
Comparing this machine with the Breville Barista Express, I found both have unique advantages. The Jura scores high on fully automated convenience‚Äîit practically does everything with minimal intervention. In contrast, the Breville offers more manual customization, which might appeal to those who relish tweaking extraction times and grind sizes. However, Jura‚Äôs lack of cappuccino or latte options due to the absence of a milk frother might lose points for those who enjoy creamier drinks. For me, though, the focus on black coffee specialties was a perfect match for my preferences.

**Cost Efficiency**  
Looking at everything this machine brings to the table‚Äîan integrated grinder, smart automation, and premium build quality‚Äîit does offer notable value for its features. While its standout capabilities justify a higher cost compared to basic coffee makers, it won‚Äôt satisfy those who expect frothy lattes in the mix. This is truly a machine for purists who appreciate black coffee and espresso.

1kkqlc2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wednesday/comments/1kkqlc2/is_anyone_else_confused_by_the_romance_writing_in/,is anyone else confused by the romance writing in this series?,"hi everyone i'm newbie here and i know i'm late on watching wednesday. but i am currently watching it and almost finish, and while i enjoy the show for what it is, especially the aesthetics, the boarding school mystery vibe, the overall atmosphere, and the friendship dynamics, i can‚Äôt help but feel completely lost and frustrated when it comes to the romance arcs, especially involving wednesday.

let me start by saying i‚Äôm not criticizing this from a place of jealousy or bitterness. i‚Äôm neurodivergent (adhd), and have spent my whole life as an outcast, from school to university. i actually relate to wednesday in many ways. that‚Äôs exactly why the way these boys are written to fall in love with her just feels‚Ä¶ off. like really off.

take tyler, for example, the coffee shop guy. they‚Äôve only met, what, maybe twice or three times before he suddenly claims that he thought wednesday was ‚Äúhinting‚Äù that she liked him more than just as a friend? when did that even happen?? i don‚Äôt remember any moment where she flirted or showed romantic interest. she barely emotes around him, barely lets her guard down, and speaks to him with the same flat tone she uses with everyone. but somehow he already has a crush on her from the very first meeting and escalates it like they‚Äôve been sharing some deep connection? it honestly feels more like projection than romance. like the writers wanted a hetero romantic interest no matter how little buildup or logic there was.

and it‚Äôs not just tyler. xavier, too. there‚Äôs this pattern of boys becoming fixated on wednesday after just one or two brief interactions, despite the fact that she‚Äôs not particularly warm, affectionate, or even receptive in return. she‚Äôs stoic, emotionally closed-off, and rarely lets people in. i‚Äôm not saying that makes her unworthy of love or romance (not at all), but the show doesn‚Äôt give us enough on-screen development for these connections to make sense. there‚Äôs no slow burn, no meaningful shared experiences, just instant obsession.

meanwhile, the most emotionally rich and believable relationship in the series is the one between wednesday and enid. they bicker, they bond, they challenge and support each other, they grow closer through actual time spent together and shared vulnerability. that relationship has layers. you can see the development. whether it‚Äôs romantic or platonic, it feels earned. i‚Äôve seen so many people say that wednesday and enid have more chemistry than any of wednesday‚Äôs male love interests, and honestly, i agree.

i understand it‚Äôs fiction. i‚Äôm not expecting gritty realism. but even in stylized or supernatural shows, emotional logic still matters. character bonds still need to feel grounded. right now, it just feels like the male characters are being written to fall for wednesday because she‚Äôs ‚Äúnot like other girls‚Äù and has a mysterious aura, not because of anything real between them.

is it just me? am i missing something? or do others also feel like the romance in wednesday is forced and lacks emotional buildup? i would honestly rather the show focus on the friendships and mysteries, because those are the parts that feel more genuine and engaging.

1kkqiwq,https://www.reddit.com/r/AquaGearLab/comments/1kkqiwq/should_you_consider_waterspecialist_ws708a/,Should you consider Waterspecialist WS708A replacement faucet water filter review before buying?,"The **Waterspecialist WS708A Replacement Faucet Water Filter** caught my attention because I‚Äôve been on a quest to get my water filtered efficiently without breaking the bank. My tap water doesn‚Äôt exactly scream ‚Äúrefreshing,‚Äù especially with its slight chlorine aftertaste and funky odor, so I decided to put this filter to the test. After weeks of daily use, here‚Äôs how it performed in various facets, as well as a few quirks I came across.

**Design and Build Quality**  
This water filter doesn‚Äôt just work; it fits into your kitchen aesthetic without screaming for attention. With its clean, unobtrusive design and compact size (5.12""D x 7.68""W x 4.92""H), it blends seamlessly with my kitchen faucet setup. The material is resin and polypropylene, which feels durable while being lightweight at just under 1.74 pounds. Pairing it with my existing water filtration system was a breeze, as it easily snapped into place, feeling secure yet easy to remove when needed. While the finish may not scream high-end, it‚Äôs functional, and more importantly, it promises lead-free material backed by NSF/ANSI certifications.  

**Installation and Compatibility**  
Setting this up was way simpler than I anticipated. The Waterspecialist guarantees compatibility with a staggering number of PUR models such as FM-3700B, FM-4100B, and FM-3333B. I had a PUR FM-3700 sitting around, and the filter slid in as if they were meant to be soulmates. The manual reset process for the indicator, though, required a bit of patience. It‚Äôs a small white button hidden underneath where the filter goes‚Äîa clever design but slightly challenging to find if you don‚Äôt read the instructions thoroughly. Nonetheless, once you reset it, it‚Äôs good to go.

[Check **Waterspecialist WS708A** price on Amazon.](https://aquagroove.com/p/b07q4sdp6y/)

**Water Filtration Performance**  
One significant standout feature is how effectively it reduces chlorine and takes care of that unpleasant taste and odor in tap water. My first trial was simply filling a glass and taking a sip, and the difference was night and day. The filtered water tastes clean and refreshing, perfect for drinking or even using in my coffee and tea. While it‚Äôs great for improving taste and smell, note that it doesn‚Äôt reduce Total Dissolved Solids (TDS), so don‚Äôt expect minerals to disappear magically. That‚Äôs one limitation that more advanced filtration systems might address. The NSF certifications lend credibility, ensuring the product delivers on its promises.

**Filter Lifespan and Maintenance**  
The brand recommends changing the filter every three months or sooner, depending on your water quality. Personally, I found this interval reasonable, as filters that push longer tend to sacrifice effectiveness. Resetting the automatic indicator was straightforward once I got the hang of it, though skipping this step doesn‚Äôt impact the filter's function directly. The quick soak-in process (just let it sit in clean water for 3 minutes!) ensures it‚Äôs primed and ready without hassle. 

**Strengths**  
- Certified NSF/ANSI filtration for chlorine reduction.  
- Easy installation and compatibility with numerous faucet models.  
- Speedy water flow without compromising filtration quality.  
- Compact, durable, and aesthetic design.  

**Disadvantages**  
- Doesn‚Äôt filter Total Dissolved Solids (TDS), which could be a dealbreaker for some.  
- The manual indicator reset can be tricky for first-time users.  
- Requires filter changes relatively frequently, which may add up over time.  

**Market Rivals**  
It‚Äôs hard not to compare this product with other leading faucet water filters. Brands like Brita and PUR tend to dominate this market, and I‚Äôve tried Brita‚Äôs faucet filters in the past. Brita does receive points for TDS removal in some models, but they often lag behind in maintaining a fast water flow, especially when the filters start aging. PUR‚Äôs official replacements give tougher competition due to their ease of replacement and reliability, though they come at a steeper price. The Waterspecialist WS708A finds a sweet spot by balancing affordability with solid NSF-certified performance, making it stand out if you‚Äôre not hung up on TDS removal.

**Smart Spending**  
In the grand scheme of water filters, this one sits comfortably in a category I‚Äôd call ‚Äúaffordable quality.‚Äù Considering its effectiveness at dealing with chlorine, its wide compatibility range, and overall ease of use, you get plenty of value for what you‚Äôre paying. If you‚Äôre on a budget but still demand clean water for drinking or cooking, it‚Äôs worth every penny. However, the extra maintenance steps, like frequent filter changes, might not make it the absolute lowest-cost option in the long run.

I am a really introverted person and I only hangout with my group of friends (they are far away kung san ako nag wo-work ngayon). So yung bf ko lang talaga ang lagi kong kasama but sometimes, pag may mga occasions yung friends nya (birthday celebs, etc.), I get invited and sumasama ako. 

I work in the medical field where I have to talk to people all day. Kaya as an introvert, dead batt na talaga social battery ko by the end of the day.

That is why yung weekends ko are very precious for me because that is the only time I recharge and my boyfriend is the only person I don‚Äôt need a social battery for. Plus, if my bf goes out, I really don‚Äôt mind being in my room the whole day because that is how I recharge.

Yung bf ko naman, is kind of extroverted. He goes out almost twice or thrice a week with his friends. Mabarkada talaga sya and he also likes to drink.
Di ko naman sya pinipigilang lumabas. I get happy for him every time he hangs out with his friends because I know that makes him happy.


Anyway, back to kanina:

This morning, my bf told me na gusto nyang mag skate and he invited me to come with him ang watch him play. I got excited because I love seeing him skate plus we also talked about grabbing some coffee and pumunta don sa cafe na gusto kong puntahan.

After cooking lunch, we decided to have a little nap. At 3 pm, he woke up first and then at around 4 he decided to wake me up and tell me na mag bibilliard daw sila ng friend nya ngayon and asked me if gusto ko ba daw sumama. The tone of asking was like out of respect nalang lol.
It‚Äôs like he completely forgot yung plans namin kanina. 
This was not the first time it happened. There were times also na nag dedate kami or lumalabas then out of nowhere may mga barkada syang makikita namin and somehow they end up joining us. Turns out, nag cha-chat na pala sila sa messenger kung nasaan sya ngayon, etc. 
I don‚Äôt hate his friends naman. They are very chill but I just feel really uncomfortable hanging out wih them lalo na during quality time namin. May mga oras naman for that diba? 

I also communicated this matter to him a lot of times already. I told him that it makes me really uncomfortable na may taong bigla na lang sumusulpot sa gala namin without him asking me first if it‚Äôs okay. Yung inbox nya lagi nalang mga barkadang always nagtatanong kung saan or anong trip gagawin. I know di nya responsibility yung social anxiety ko pero at least naman try not to make me feel uncomfortable naman.

Idk. I feel like an asshole because di ko napigilang umiyak kanina when he asked me what‚Äôs wrong before he left the house. He tried to make things right by telling me na di nalang sya lalabas and will take me out for coffee pero it felt awkward already and di ako pumayag.",1,1747050379.0,OALangBaAko,2,1.0,False
1kkqfuh,https://www.reddit.com/r/OsakaWorldExpo/comments/1kkqfuh/512_trip_report/,5/12 Trip Report,"Thanks to so many people who I've interacted with on this sub. Without you, today would've been more of a disaster than it was. Despite expecting lines, I did not expect to see THIS many people. Entire schools of children, thousands of families. I've been to CES and many Disney parks including Tokyo ones, and I always thought I was fine with crowds and lines. Today reminded me that everyone has a limit, and mine was reached sooner than the majority of the Japanese population, it seems. In a nutshell, my husband and I did not find today enjoyable 99% of the time. I cannot even imagine what the weekends and Golden Week were like if you guys are saying weekdays aren't bad.

Pre-Expo:

* I wasn't prepared for the 2 month lottery (I have trouble planning that early!) so nothing there
* In the 7 day lottery, we won nothing (I think I put down the Japan Pavilion 5 times)
* In the 3 day free-for-all, we managed to snag Gas Pavilion

Entry:

* Used West Gate. Arrived at JR Sakurajima and took the shuttle (pre-booked for 9 am, but got on around 8:45 and they were ok with that).
* Got to the venue around 9.
* Waited at least 30 min for security.
* Barely made it in time for 9:50 am Gas Pavilion reservation, but still had to wait about 10 min to get in.

Same-day reservations:

* HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
* More seriously, the website kept kicking me out of the list and making me start over to re-select my tickets a million times. When it did show the list, I'd get excited when I saw the orange triangle, but then click in and it says it can't get anything. It's probably easier if you're solo, but we were 2 people.
* Managed to book Blue Ocean Dome for 2:20 pm. Which meant we couldn't get any other RSVPs for many hours. After Blue Ocean, I was never able to get anything else.
* Kiosk lines for on-site registrations were always too long I didn't want to wait just to get more of nothing. I did try the kiosk once when the line was about 12-15 min long but I wasn't eligible for anything until after 2:20 pm and the system knew that. If you use the kiosk, again, probably better if you're solo.

Pavilions (all walk-ins except Gas and Blue Ocean Dome since we couldn't reserve anything):

* We look for high production value that grabs your attention right away. We don't particularly like sitting around watching videos. I was looking for things that are more interactive. But that ended up being very difficult to experience when there are always 50 heads crowded in front of you and you can barely peek through them to see what they're looking at. Most of the time, we tried to look for a few seconds and then just walked past everyone. As a result, we probably never spent more than 5-10 min inside a pavilion, depending how big it was.
* Gas Pavilion 4/5 - the VR part was cute, reminiscent of a Disney experience, but the second explanation part felt too long. Husband was not impressed at all, however ratings will be my own opinions only.
* Australia Pavilion 1/5 - cool pavilion design but nothing interesting, too crowded, just walked through.
* Thailand Pavilion 2/5 - a bit of an awkward pre-show making us sing along, exhibits were ok (again too crowded to really see them), walked through them quickly, the food smelled good.
* Saudi Arabia Pavilion 3/5 - awesome architecture but each room packed with heads, couldn't really see/read anything. Just peeked around and walked on by.
* Indonesia Pavilion 4/5 - drew us in with the free coffee lol. Nice rainforest, but second floor was way too crowded and not worth it.
* India Pavilion 1/5 - too crowded to see anything.
* Uzbekistan Pavilion 3/5 - appreciate the tour guide doing her own translations (Japanese/English) but was a bit hard to understand what was happening.
* China Pavilon 5/5 - best one so far, great architecture and pavilion design and big enough to spread people out a little more to actually see a couple things sorta better.
* Blue Ocean Dome 2.5/5 - I thought I had read good reviews of this one but it wasn't really worth it, like I wouldn't feel like you're missing anything if you didn't see it. Very psychedelic though.
* ORA Gaishoku Pavilion UTAGE 5/5 - Had a sushi making class here which was awesome, and the pavilion itself had some beautiful impressive confectionary displays. Plus Cremia is here! If you've never tasted Cremia Hokkaido soft-serve...that's a line worth getting in.
* Pasona Natureverse 2/5 - Not worth the wait at all, too crowded to see anything, didn't know what was happening most of the time, but I guess the IPS heart and tissue was cool.
* Future of Life 3/5 - Despite being in a remote area and 5 pm, it was still quite crowded and not worth the wait. This was more reminiscent of the CES convention showcasing technology and there was some cool stuff, but nothing I wanted to spend much time on or wait in more mini-lines for.
* Future Life Village 1/5 - Wasn't really anything eyecatching IMO.
* Attempted to see Ukraine but walked by and it didn't really seem that interesting so didn't get in line for it.

Leaving:

* Left at 5:45 pm (we couldn't bring ourselves to stay longer, partly out of disappointment, and mostly because we are very jetlagged as we just got to Osaka at midnight after nearly 20 hours of traveling from SFO). Didn't want to transfer multiple times again so booked last minute direct shuttle back to Namba and that was totally worth it. FWIW, the MaaS app only had 6 pm, but we were allowed on the 5:45 pm shuttle since there was space.

Other things:

* Even the top of the ring was pretty crowded but at least it was constantly moving.
* I didn't feel like an umbrella was necessary as long as you have a good wide-brimmed hat. IMO the less things taking up a hand, the better lol.
* The bathrooms outside the ring never had a line, so those are probably a better bet.
* The bathrooms indeed do not have any hand dryers (??!!) or paper towels. Someone suggested bringing a towel, and I did, but I never used it. I wore quick-dry pants and decided to just wipe on my pants so I wouldn't have to carry around a wet towel lol.
* I brought a hoodie plus a windbreaker because I heard it could get chilly. I ended up carrying them both the whole day and never needed them. Sometimes under the ring, with the wind, it felt a tad colder, but I guess I was walking around so much I didn't really mind. If I stayed longer into the evening though, I think I would need them.
* I brought 2 \~8000 mah battery packs for my iPhone 16 Pro Max because I expected to drain my battery multiple times due to all the stuff you need to do on your phone, but I only needed to charge once. 

Tomorrow's game plan:

* Booked direct shuttle from Namba again to avoid the transfers.
* Had RSVP for Electric Power Pavilion at 11:30 am, but shuttles are sold out that would get us there in time, so we are going to skip the RSVP and arrive around 3 pm instead, hoping to stay into the evening when the crowds thin out (according to this sub...and hopefully that's still true this week).
* Don't have high hopes for getting anything on same-day reservations with such a late arrival time. :( I would love Earth Mart at least if I could get it.
* Going to try to get into some of the more highly rated walk-in country pavilions I've read in this sub that I didn't get to go to today because the waits were ridiculous.
* Try to get into null\^2 with their separate walk-in ticketing system.
* I have 1 RSVP for Osaka Healthcare but husband doesn't, not sure how that happened, but will try to show up together anyways.
* Try to get into Japan Pavilion during the evening walk-in opening.

I'm always impressed when I read how many of you have gotten into like nearly all of the signature pavilions and many rsvp-only pavilions. I wonder if it's a function of you guys having gone to the expo earlier, whereas it's just getting more and more crowded now as the event picks up steam? I wonder if it'll ebb and flow as people say it's not worth going and then it becomes worth going again. This was my first World Expo...have all past Expos been this insanely crowded with 1+ hour lines for everything??",1,1747050352.0,OsakaWorldExpo,2,1.0,False
1kkqfn0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1kkqfn0/wibtah_i_want_to_give_the_priest_a_taste_of_his/,WIBTAH: I want to give the priest a taste of his own medicine.,"Hey everyone. So a bit of context: I (26M) am from a very small village in Europe, but I have been living in my country‚Äôs capital city for the past 3 years. Oh, and I‚Äôm gay and an atheist.

Sadly, we lost my grandmother one year ago. I wasn‚Äôt able to attend the funeral because I was abroad working (actually she died the exact day I landed there and I got the phone call the moment I stepped out of the buss that dropped me to my new workplace). So it‚Äôs safe to say that I could not get back in time. For this reason, being there for the one year memorial of her death meant a lot to me.

Naturally, I‚Äôm not the typical manly guy you find in the village. I always help set the table and clean it, I help make coffee for everyone in family gatherings and overall I help the women in the family, doing more ‚Äúwomanly‚Äù chores and stuff while the rest of the men sit in the living room or the balcony waiting to be served. I actually had some little fights with them over the years, advocating about showing respect and gratitude towards women specifically.

This past Saturday was the ritual (I‚Äôm calling it ritual, I don‚Äôt know if that is the English word for it) in the cemetery and after that we served coffee and some traditional finger food at home for close friends, family and the neighbourhood. Very typical for our culture (Orthodox Christians). My aunt was a bit sick and resting so I made coffee for everyone while my sister and cousin plated the food and served it outside. When it was time to serve coffee, I went outside and started to ask people if they would prefer sweetened or unsweetened and giving them what they wanted. The priest then heard me and started repeating what I was saying in an exaggerated high pitched voice, clearly making fun of me. Now, I am proudly, unapologetically and openly gay and it shows. I also have a high pitched voice (not too much, not that it matters though). So this felt very intentional and I considered it rude. He then continued by asking a middle aged neighbour of mine (let‚Äôs call him Mark): ‚ÄúDo you take your coffee unsweetened Mark?‚Äù in the same high pitched voice. It was very uncomfortable and I kinda felt like there was a sexual undertone to it all. He was openly making fun of my sexuality. (Just to be clear, Mark is straight and has a family, he was just the person the priest used to make his joke).

I am a very ‚Äúno bullshit‚Äù person and I will call it what it is all the time, but there were many people around and for the sake of family and saving face, I kept quiet. Nobody addressed it, nobody from my family was close enough to hear when it happened but I don‚Äôt think they would have said something either way.

Next day, Sunday, we were serving the same things for the whole village after church in an event space next to it. Again, very typical for my country and the religion. I was again asked to help with the coffee and I agreed, but this type of event has also volunteers (women) from the church that helped with the serving. I was again serving coffee and my dad, who was sitting next to the priest, told me to bring forks to the tables. Mind you, everything was finger food and there was no point for forks. I said I have no idea where the forks are or even if there were forks in the event space. The priest then asked me what I was talking about (in the same high pitched voice) and I turned to him and said ‚ÄúI am talking with my father‚Äù. He then proceeded to tell me that he could listen to what we were talking about and that ‚ÄúEven the village‚Äôs dogs can pick up and carry forks‚Äù.

I went all Chanel Oberlin bitch face mode, I tried really hard to not say anything. And didn‚Äôt. Although I had the comeback ready in a nanosecond: ‚ÄúWell in your memorial I will bring the forks out first thing‚Äù. But I just walked away and of course didn‚Äôt bring him any forks, just sat down and enjoyed some food and coffee with my extended family.

I don‚Äôt know, I just felt targeted for no reason. This priest is know for being ironic and sarcastic but I‚Äôm not a kid anymore. Next time I will respond accordingly, especially because I am not a believer and in my opinion when I look at him I see someone that is my equal. My elder, yes, but nothing more. I will speak to him the way he deserves.

Some of my family members told me that I should respect his position but I told them ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to do that when he himself doesn‚Äôt respect it‚Äù. I don‚Äôt think his behaviour is very godly or representative of how a good person should act like, regardless of position or religion. My sister and cousin laughed so hard when I told them what I wanted to answer to the priest and told me I should have said it.

So: AITAH for wanting to be ‚Äúrude‚Äù to a priest? I won‚Äôt go out of my way to interact with him (especially because I will leave my village shortly) but next time he is disrespectful to me I will let him have it.",2,1747050334.0,AITAH,3,0.75,False

He, on the other hand, decided to get baptised just this Easter Vigil. I started getting attracted to him when he talked about reading the Bible during Lent, and his general curiosity on theology. I don‚Äôt know his faith story yet, but I‚Äôm curious to know.

To some of you when i outline my story it might be obvious why i got the clot, which I'm hoping will give me valuable insight, so any feedback is appreciated.

I started running late 2023 for the health benefits, got hooked and ran a total of 2600km's in 2024 ending the year with my first marathon on 15th of December. After the marathon I stopped training almost entirely because it was Christmas break. 2 days after Christmas my mom suffered a heart attack and almost died, that was a big stressor. I also work a sitting job and had more work then usual so in January 2025 i basically worked 10+ hours, drinking too much coffee and not enough water probably, with only about 3k steps a day taken ( 5k at most ). Around 12th of January started feeling a bit under the weather but nothing worth going to the doctor, really light fever ( 37.2 C ) that wasn't even present that often, just feeling generally low energy and fatigued. That feeling kind of went away but not fully. Then from 24th of January i started feeling worse and worse. Decided to go to doctors and long story short my d-dimmer was 5.6k and i got a CT confirming a PE. They initially didn't think it was PE because i didn't have any trouble breathing, just general fatigue. But my elevated HR and my RVSP of 35 prompted them to do a CT. Was in the hospital for 7 days. After which i started digging around to find out why i got it. Did a ultrasound of the abdomen and it turns out my spleen is slightly enlarged and i have a thyroid nodule that might be cancerous ( something I am supposed to do a biopsy for in the following days ). I was also confirmed to have Hashimoto ( autoimmune thyroid issue ), and on top of that looks like i had Cytomegalo virus as well. I did the genetics tests for clotting disorders and they came back negative.

I asked my doctor if the thyroid nodule is cancerous could that be the reason for the clot and he said it's highly unlikely. He said that cancers can cause clots but for thyroid cancers specifically he said it's highly unlikely.

And here I am today trying to piece everything together to try and have less anxiety about it because I think my doctor will say to stop taking Xarellto at 3 months after being discharged. So my anxiety is creeping a bit in because I'm going to stop taking them. I upped my fluid intake and started jogging again since my clot is no longer in my leg and my pulmologist said my lungs sound clear and we did a X-ray of my lungs and she said it looks clean even though she told me to totally be sure it's clean i should do a CT but she is against unnecessary CT scans ( because of the radiation ).

That's the story in a nutshell. I think it's probably a perfect storm of things and not moving and not upping my water intake after the marathon was the first mistake which then probably lead to the cytomegalo virus and overall reduced immunity and increased inflammation.

What are your guys thoughts? And feedback or similar stories?

EDIT: I also had the pfizer covid vaccine ( 2 shots in total ) back in 2021. I heard that covid and the vaccines as well can cause clotting but that was almost 4 years ago, so I don't think it's likely due to that but I also have no idea.",1,1747050148.0,ClotSurvivors,0,1.0,False

An hour after our date ended, the guy sent me an unexpected message - ‚ÄúWhy did you ask so many questions about my work, when ex(name) should have explained in detail‚Äù ‚ÄúThe introverted ex you referred to is my best friend/colleague.‚Äù I was completely blindsided. Because I never met this guy before. The ex he referred to, we dated briefly for 3 months - 2.5 years ago and we ended on civil terms. We did speak briefly about our respective ex on the date, but it was nothing negative. I had only good things to say about the guy.

This followed up with ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt date my best friend‚Äôs ex girlfriend. As a man this is against our principle‚Äù and unmatched me. Never-mind with the fact that said ex and I never labelled anything, and it fizzled out within 3 months.

I think he asked his friend and clocked out the details based on my ethnicity and work profile. Anyway, it would be great if women are not reduced to a title/label based on what we were at one point of time in a man‚Äôs life. I feel pretty shitty with the way he cut the cords.

It's your fellow rainy-day dreamer here, and I need your help to bring a new project to our caffeine-afficianado/obsessed city. I'm toying with opening a coffee shop/snack (maybe a juice bar) lounge with a twist, a cozy escape where you can get work done, recharge, and forget the world's chaos. Bring back coffee from the '90s. Picture a place that's part library (book shelves, people can donate books), part coffee shop, with a Zen garden, basically, the SPOT to channel your inner Portland introvert/seclusion, good if you are a night owl, a student cramming for finals, overstimulated by work and people, family and need to hide, or just someone who needs a break from the WiFi-hogging laptop warriors at Stumptown.

Comfy couches, low tea tables, bean bags, a mix of vintage Powell's-reading-nook chairs, and sleek modern seats to match your vibe, and silent capsules.

No blaring pop remixes (sorry, Swift fans, no Swift on repeat). Instead, think soothing nature sounds, fake waterfalls, chirping birds, maybe a gentle rain loop, and an aquarium. I promise, no midnight seagull screeches! ( Rain in the summer, and the beach and sunshine in the winter)

A projector playing calming visuals: ocean waves, forest walks, or maybe an Animal Planet reel of baby sloths to slow down the time.

Warm, dim lighting, the kind that makes you want to live there. Kidding.

It will be open late, maybe even 24/7, if Portland's nocturnal creatives (looking at you, Alberta Arts night owls) show up for it. 

The Menu:

* High-quality coffee (think local roasts), loose-leaf teas for the tea nerds, and comfort snacks
* Maybe some international treats (Moroccan sweets? Japanese mochi? French madeleines, mille-feuille?), local pastries from local Bakers (no donuts, I promise) or maybe donuts too, seasonal specials, pumpkin spice for fall, marionberry tarts in summer, or pies √† la 90s diners.
* Affordable prices, because we've all felt the sting of a $7 oat milk latte. What's your go-to coffee shop order, PDX? I want to make sure we've got it!

  
I'm still hunting for the perfect spot. Where do you think this vibe would thrive? I'm picturing a mix of students, remote workers, freelancers, tourists, parents, artists, first dates, and introverts who occasionally leave their caves. Maybe somewhere near PSU for the college crowd or Alberta for the artsy late-nighters? I would love to hear your suggestions. Where do you go when you need to focus but also want a cozy vibe?

The Big Challenge is   
How do we keep the space chill without it turning into a crash pad for Portland's extended-stay campsite enthusiasts? (We're aiming for cozy, not that cozy.) I'm thinking a strict ""no sleeping bags"" policy and passing out in the bathroom, but I'm open to your clever ideas. 

One thought: an army of judgmental cats patrolling the space. That may be too much.

What would make this your go-to spot? A specific tea/coffee on the menu? A corner with extra outlets for your laptop? I want this to be a Portland vibe space, PDX, so hit me with your wildest ideas, nothing's too out there for this city!

Thanks for any thoughts, advice, or random inspo!

1kkqb47,https://www.reddit.com/r/ThailandTourism/comments/1kkqb47/a_guide_to_the_mae_hong_son_loop/,A guide to the Mae Hong Son Loop,"The Mae Hong Son Loop is an epic adventure through northern Thailand. Famous for its stunning mountains, charming villages, breathtaking viewpoints, and best of all, it takes you off the beaten path and into the heart of authentic Thailand.  
  
This incredible 700KM journey kicks off in Chiang Mai and winds through Doi Inthanon, Mae Sariang, Mae Hong Son, and Pai, before looping back to Chiang Mai. Many travelers love this route because it just keeps getting better with every twist and turn! Or flip it and go the other way! There‚Äôs no wrong or right.  
  
A few things to keep in mind when planning your trip to Chiang Mai!  
From February to May, it's burning season, this happens when farmers prepare their land, which can lead to hazy skies and a bit of difficulty breathing due to smoke.  
Then from June to October, the rainy season rolls in, bringing wet roads and occasional downpours.  
The absolute best time to explore this stunning route is from November to February, when the weather is cool and clear. But neither season makes the Mae Hong Son Loop off-limits.  
¬†  
Before hitting the road on the Mae Hong Son Loop, take some time to explore Chiang Mai, it's part of the journey too. Explore markets, temples, the historic city walls and gates, the Old City and even visit an elephant sanctuary. From shoppingmalls to hidden gems, Chiang Mai is bursting with things to see and do.  
You want to take your time and not rush through it!  
  
One of Chiang Mai‚Äôs absolute must-see highlights is the stunning Wat Phra That Doi Suthep.  
Located on the mountain of Doi Suthep, this temple not only has its golden beauty but also rewards you with breathtaking views over the city. But first, you‚Äôve got to conquer the 309-step staircase (or hop on the cart). You could also hike the Monk‚Äôs Trail from the city, it‚Äôs around 7KM long and takes about 3.5 hours.

After diving into Chiang Mai, you'll quickly realize, this city is an absolute gem!  
It‚Äôs got a chilled-out vibe, has stunning nature and is blessed with a cool and comfortable climate.   
  
To enjoy the twists, turns, and steep climbs of the Mae Hong Son Loop, you‚Äôll want a bike with at least 150CC. Trust me, you‚Äôll need that power, to carry you, your luggage, and possibly a travel buddy.  
My favourite ride is the Yamaha Aerox 155CC, a cool, comfortable, automatic bike with enough power.  
Never leave your passport at a rental shop! Instead, leave a cash deposit and let them take a copy. Reputable shops like Mango Bike Rental and Pop Big Bike Rental are great choices, just make sure to contact them ahead of time to reserve your bike, especially in high season!  
  
Do not forget your helmet! Most rental places provide one, but they‚Äôre often worn out and not the freshest. A tip is to pick your own helmet while exploring Chiang Mai. It also makes an awesome souvenir. You can even find helmets in big supermarkets like Big C.  
  
Here‚Äôs the deal with licenses: while rental shops won‚Äôt ask for one, you legally need a license to ride, and without it, your travel insurance likely won‚Äôt cover you if something goes wrong. If you already have a motorcycle license back home, go ahead and grab an International Driver‚Äôs Permit before your trip. Just double-check that your insurance covers international coverage.  
  
Many people rent without a license, and yes, you can get away with it‚Ä¶ sometimes. In Chiang Mai City, police checks are common, and if you‚Äôre caught without a license, you‚Äôll likely get a 500 Baht fine (around $14.55 or ‚Ç¨13.30). After that, you‚Äôre usually free to continue riding.  
During the actual loop, I personally haven‚Äôt ran into any police stops.  
  
Wondering if you should book your hotels in advance?  
If you're on a schedule and like to having everything sorted, book ahead!  
  
(You could) Book a hotel close to your rental shop.  
It makes picking up and dropping off your bike much easier. Since I rent my bikes from Mango Bike Rental, I chose to stay at The Hive Chiang Mai Hotel,  
it's just around the corner from the rental! You‚Äôll be there in just two minutes.  
The Hive is a budget-friendly hotel in a quiet area, perfect for a good night‚Äôs rest before hitting the road.  
Now, when you're ready to head to Mango, skip Google Maps for directions, it‚Äôll send you on an unnecessary detour. Instead, just exit the hotel, turn right, walk through the condominium parking lot, and you‚Äôll spot Mango Bike Rental right ahead. Easy and quick!  
  
Before you hit the road, pack a few essentials:  
Water: Stay hydrated and again, stay hydrated.  
Raincoat: Grab a cheap one at any 7-Eleven.  
Sweater: It can get cold up in the mountains.  
Cash: You‚Äôll need it for fuel, groceries on the way or when there are no ATM‚Äôs around.  
Google Maps: This app is an absolute must. It‚Äôs handy for directions, but just a heads-up:  
don‚Äôt fully trust the estimated arrival time, it‚Äôs often way off. Expect it to take about twice as long!  
  
**Day 1:**  
Your first day on the loop kicks off bright and early, there‚Äôs a lot of ground to cover and much to see. Grab some breakfast at your hotel if you can, or pick up something along the way.  
Fuel stops at the PTT Stations are more than just gas breaks. You can stretch your legs, grab a coffee at Cafe Amazon or do some shopping at 7-11.  
My shoppingcart for 7-11 on the way: An iced coffee or a Red Bull, paired with a grilled cheese sandwich.  
  
Start on Route 109 for 40KM, then turn right onto Route 108 for 25KM, and once more right onto Route 1009 for 9KM, which will lead you straight to the entrance of Doi Inthanon National Park. Entrance fee: 300 Baht for adults, 150 Baht for kids, and 20 Baht for your bike.  
Doi Inthanon National Park is has Thailand‚Äôs highest peak at 2,565 meters, forests, waterfalls and the stunning twin pagodas. From the park entrance, it‚Äôs about 40KM to the summit, this park is massive.  
  
First stop and not far from the entrance: the Wachirathan Waterfall. This 80-meter-tall beauty is the most visited in the park and the moment you lay eyes on it, you‚Äôll know why.  
  
Next up: the twin pagodas, built to honor the King and Queen on their 60th birthdays. The entrance is easy to miss, so keep an eye out. Just before you reach them,  
you‚Äôll find a curve with a viewpoint called Viewpoint KM.41, this is where some like to catch the sunrise.  
A little further up the road, there‚Äôs a steep path between parking spots, that‚Äôs the actual entrance of the twin pagoda‚Äôs. Entry here costs 100 Baht for adults and 50 Baht for kids, and trust me, it‚Äôs worth every baht. The gardens, the views, the architecture, it‚Äôs beautiful.  
After you have visited this beautiful spot, it‚Äôs time to move on.  
Back on the road you‚Äôll find a parking lot with a ranger station, this is where you can hop on a guided tour called the Kew Mae Pan Nature Trail.  
  
Keep driving and you‚Äôll soon reach the highest point in Thailand! While there‚Äôs no view from the summit itself, just being there is something special.  
  
On your way back, be sure to stop by the stunning Mae Ya Waterfall, just 16KM from the entrance. You can park your bike right at the entrance of the waterfall, where you‚Äôll also find a few stalls selling snacks and drinks. From there, it‚Äôs just a short walk to the falls. At an impressive 280 meters high, Mae Ya waterfall is an absolute showstopper, easily one of the most beautiful waterfalls in all of Thailand!  
  
Some love to spend the night in or around Doi Inthanon National Park, and for good reason! Catching the sunrise from the mountains is an unforgettable experience.  
There are enough places to stay, such as homestays or even renting a tent on campingground is an option.  
  
Time to say goodbye to the park and hit road 108 again. About 75KM from the entrance of Doi Inthanon National Park, you‚Äôll come across Bo Kaeo Pine Tree Garden. This man-made forest is filled with pine trees, and it‚Äôs absolutely worth a quick stop. Take a moment and enjoy the peaceful atmosphere and quiet beauty of this unique spot.  
  
On the road for the final 70KM as you cruise toward your first overnight stop: Mae Sariang. This charming little town in Mae Hong Son province, is about 50KM from the Myanmar border and offers a peaceful place to unwind after a big day on the road.  
  
You‚Äôll know you‚Äôve arrived when you spot the town‚Äôs landmark, the Mae Sariang Museum. While it‚Äôs a quiet place with not a ton of sights, it‚Äôs the perfect spot to rest and recharge. You‚Äôve been on the move since early morning, and you‚Äôve already clocked nearly 300KM.  
  
Accommodation options are limited here, but Above the Sea Boutique Hotel is a good choice. The loft-style rooms are cozy, with soft beds and blankets, just what you need after a long ride. They‚Äôve also got a swimming pool if you feel to take a dip!  
  
After a shower and a little freshening up, head out for some local food, treat yourself to a comforting bowl of Khao Soi, a rich and flavorful egg noodle soup that‚Äôs a northern Thai specialty. Once you‚Äôre done, it‚Äôs time to enjoy a well-deserved night of rest.  
Tomorrow‚Äôs another day of adventure waiting.  
  
**Day 2:**  
The next morning, it‚Äôs another early start, because today‚Äôs ride is an exciting one.  
Grab a hearty breakfast at your hotel, you‚Äôll need the energy. Before hitting the road, make a quick stop at the PTT Station, just 3 minutes away, to fill up your tank. There‚Äôs a 7-Eleven there too if you need to stock up on drinks or snacks.  
  
Today‚Äôs journey takes you on a 165KM ride to the lovely town of Mae Hong Son. At first glance, the road might seem pretty straight, but don‚Äôt be fooled, this is where the curves begin and the landscape starts to change dramatically. As you climb into the mountains, the views get better and better.  
  
Take your time and enjoy the ride, this stretch is about the journey just as much as the destination.  
A great place to stop and soak it all in is Lan View Coffee. Grab an ice cold drink, breathe in the fresh mountain air, and admire the scenery. A little further along, you‚Äôll come across Dad‚Äôs Garden, another peaceful coffee stop with great views and tasty food. Perfect for a quick refuel.  
  
You‚Äôll also come across several viewpoints along the way, don‚Äôt skip them! These stops are part of what makes the Mae Hong Son Loop so special. Your first one, Mae La Luang Viewpoint, offers an incredible view over rounded green hills. Later, Pha Bong Viewpoint gives you a look at the towering mountain ranges. At some of these spots, you‚Äôll find small stalls selling drinks and snacks, great for a quick break and a reminder to stay hydrated.  
  
After about 165KM of winding roads and unforgettable views, you‚Äôll arrive in the peaceful and beautiful town of Mae Hong Son, in the province of the same name.  
You‚Äôll know you‚Äôve arrived when you see the Mae Hong Son Gate.  
This city is the perfect place to slow down and explore, and staying for two nights is definitely recommended. For a comfortable place to stay just outside the center, check out the B2 Mae Hong Son Premier Resort. It‚Äôs a great base for relaxing and getting ready for your next adventure on the loop! Fresh up and explore the city!  
  
**Day 3:**  
The next morning, it‚Äôs once again a great idea to rise early, this day is packed with beautiful sights and moments! Start your morning by catching the mist floating over the waters of Pang Oung Lake,  
just 43KM from B2 Mae Hong Son Premier Resort. This serene lake is part of a royal project by the late King of Thailand, focused on forest and ecosystem restoration, and it truly feels like a hidden gem.  
To get there, follow Road 108, which turns into 1095, and after about 16KM, take a left turn.  
Before you head up, make a quick stop at the 7-Eleven for some snacks, you‚Äôll love enjoying them lakeside while taking in the calm, misty views. It‚Äôs the perfect way to start the day.  
  
Just 13KM from Pang Oung is the charming Ban Rak Thai, a Yunnanese-style village nestled in the hills.   
With cozy teahouses, lakeside restaurants, and gorgeous scenery, it‚Äôs another amazing place to enjoy the morning fog. Whether you choose Pang Oung or Ban Rak Thai as your first stop, be sure to go early, because the magical mist doesn‚Äôt last forever.  
  
Just a heads up, the roads leading to the lake and village are quite steep and full of curves! Make sure to drive carefully and take your time. The views along the way are amazing, so enjoy the ride and stay safe!  
  
Once you've soaked in the peaceful vibes, head back to Mae Hong Son City. On the way back, about 32KM away from Ban Rak Thai you can visit the Su Tong Pae Bamboo Bridge. This is the longest bamboo bridge in Thailand, and serves as a connection between the temple monks and local villagers.  
  
After another 14KM make your way up to Wat Phra That Doi Kong Mu, a hilltop temple sitting 1,300 meters above sea level. The views from up here are incredible, offering a panoramic look at Mae Hong Son City surrounded by green mountains. Right at the temple, there‚Äôs a coffeeshop where you can sit and enjoy the atmosphere while gazing out over the city.  
  
Before heading back to your hotel, it‚Äôs very much recommended to get yourself a certificate for doing the Mae Hong Son Loop. You can get a certificate at the MHS Chamber of Commerce. It‚Äôs a very nice souvenir for home!  
  
After a full day of sightseeing, head back to your hotel to freshen up, you‚Äôve earned a little rest after about a 100KM drive. But don‚Äôt call it a night just yet. Just 5 minutes from your hotel is Chong Kham Lake, surrounded by Wat Chong Kham temple and the Chong Kham Night Market.  
Grab a tasty local meal at the market, relax by the lake, and take in the view of the temple glowing in the evening light. It‚Äôs the perfect ending to another amazing day on the loop!  
  
**Day 4:**  
The next morning, it‚Äôs time to hit the road early again! Grab a quick bite in Mae Hong Son City or swing by a 7-Eleven for some snacks, and don‚Äôt forget to top up your bike with gas, because today, you're off to Pai!  
This leg of the trip is about 111 km along road 108, which becomes the famous, twisty road 1095. Get ready, there are a lot of curves ahead.  
  
Pai is a charming little town in Mae Hong Son province, not far from the Myanmar border, and it sits right on the banks of the peaceful Pai River.  
  
16KM away from the B2 Mae Hong Son Premier Resort you will spot a coffeeshop called Thai Elephant Coffee. In case you didn‚Äôt have your coffee yet, this is the place to do so. Enjoy a nice hot, or cold, cup of coffee while overlooking the valley.  
  
5KM furter on the road after your coffeebreak, you‚Äôll reach Tham Pla, also known as the Fish Cave. For just 100 Baht, you can wander around and feed the fish. Just 4 km further down the road, you‚Äôll come across the Thung Masan Checkpoint. Don‚Äôt worry‚Äîno checks here, but from this point on, the real fun begins: the curvy roads are calling!  
  
Enjoy the ride as the road winds through the hills, offering some truly beautiful views along the way.  
After about 30 km, you‚Äôll arrive at Ban Luk Khao Lam Viewpoint, a perfect place to take a break. Grab a drink or a snack from one of the local stalls and take in the sweeping scenery. If you‚Äôve held off on food so far, just 10 km further is Bar 124 Cafe, a cozy little spot where you can relax and enjoy some tasty food and drinks. And yes, the view from here doesn‚Äôt disappoint either.  
  
Trust me, you‚Äôll appreciate these breaks. Riding in the heat and tackling all those curves can really wear you out. These stops give you a chance to rest, recharge, and get ready to keep going strong.  
  
Almost 25 km after Bar 124, another scenic treat is waiting: Doi Kiew Lom Viewpoint. Take your time here, check out the views from both sides of the road, browse the nearby stalls, and if you‚Äôre feeling playful, try out the old swing.  
  
From here, it‚Äôs just 24 km to Pai! After a ride like that, you‚Äôve definitely earned a bit of comfort.  
The Ai Pai Hotel is the best hotel of Pai. This 4-star hotel has cozy rooms, a restaurant, and even a swimming pool. Best of all, it‚Äôs right around the corner from Pai‚Äôs walking street. Kick back, relax, and get ready to head out in the evening to explore Pai‚Äôs walking street and taste some incredible local food.  
  
**Day 5**  
After a well-earned night of rest, it‚Äôs time to head out and explore Pai! Hop on road 1095 and after just 5KM, you‚Äôll find yourself at the stunning Great White Buddha. Make sure to bring a bottle of water, there‚Äôs a bit of a climb up the stairs, but it‚Äôs totally worth it. Not only do you get a great little morning workout, but the panoramic view of the city from up there is amazing!  
  
Back on the 1095, just another 4KM down the road, you‚Äôll arrive at the iconic Pai Canyon.  
Shaped over the years by wind and water, this spot is a natural wonder. The views over the valley are beautiful, and while many people love catching the sunset here, a morning visit is just as magical, and much cooler! Don‚Äôt forget that water bottle, you‚Äôll need it here too.  
  
Pai is a vegetarian food lover‚Äôs dream! Even if you‚Äôre not vegetarian,I highly recommend trying it out, you‚Äôll taste the care and creativity in every bite. Ganita Cafe, just 500 meters from the Ai Pai Hotel, is a fantastic place to start. Their meals are next level.  
  
Looking for the perfect sunset spot? You‚Äôve got to check out Two Huts Pai. It‚Äôs only 6KM from the hotel and offers the perfect setting to unwind with a drink in hand.  
The vibe is chill, the view is unreal, and when the sun dips below the horizon, you can head back into town and stroll through Pai Walking Street, filled with great food, fun shops, and all the evening magic you could want.  
  
**Day 6:**  
The next day marks the final stretch of the incredible Mae Hong Son Loop, 130KM back to Chiang Mai! But don‚Äôt worry, the adventure‚Äôs not over yet. There‚Äôs still plenty to see and experience along the way, so make sure to hit the road early, this one‚Äôs a long ride! Hop back on your bike and head out on road 1095.  
Before leaving town, you can fill up your tank and grab a quick bite or drink at the local 7-11, always handy for a last-minute fuel-up (for you and your bike).  
  
Just 3KM from your hotel, you‚Äôll spot a cozy little coffeeshop called Coffee in Love. This charming place was actually featured in the 2009 Thai movie Pai in Love, and it‚Äôs got a big ‚ÄúI am Pai‚Äù sign that‚Äôs perfect for a picture to remember your visit to Pai.  
  
Back on the road, you‚Äôll soon pass Pai Canyon, yep, the one you explored yesterday. And just 2KM later, you‚Äôll come across the historic Ta-Pai Memorial Bridge. Originally built by the Japanese army during World War II using logs dragged in by elephants, it was burned down after the war and later rebuilt by the local villagers.  
  
Another 2KM down the road brings you to the serene Sunset at Bamboo Bridge. It‚Äôs a peaceful spot to stretch your legs, snap a few photos, and take a walk across the iconic bamboo walkway.  
  
As you ride on, the familiar curves begin to return. After 26KM of winding roads, you‚Äôll arrive at Rak Chang Viewpoint. It might only be 38KM from your hotel, but a break here will is well deserved. Right at the viewpoint, there‚Äôs also a cozy little coffeeshop called Lisu Cafe, grab a drink and sit back.  
  
After 10KM you‚Äôll see the Kong Gnam Viewpoint. It‚Äôs worth a brief stop to take in the view of the road and the mountains.  
  
Then it‚Äôs back to the curves! Enjoy every twist and turn, and after 3KM, you‚Äôll find The Coffee Witch House, another stop for a refreshment.  
  
Another 28KM down the road and you‚Äôll reach Mok Fa Waterfall, a beautiful 60-meter-high waterfall that‚Äôs well worth the visit. The entrance fee is 100 Baht per person and 20 Baht for your motorbike. Take your time here and enjoy the cool mist and jungle vibes.  
  
After visiting the waterfall, it‚Äôs just 20KM before you‚Äôll make a right onto road 107. From there, it‚Äôs a straight 34KM stretch back to Chiang Mai. As you ride, you‚Äôll start to feel the shift, leaving the calm of nature behind and entering the buzz of the city. The traffic, the sounds‚Ä¶ yep, you‚Äôre back.  
  
This was just one way to experience the magical Mae Hong Son Loop. You can always add more nights, take extra detours, slow down the pace, it‚Äôs totally up to you. In this example, we did 1 night in Mae Sariang, 2 in Mae Hong Son, and 2 in Pai. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend doing it in fewer days, it would feel rushed, and that‚Äôs not what this journey is about. The heart of the loop is all about the ride, the moments, and the memories, so take your time, and enjoy every single kilometer.  
  
Congratulations on completing the incredible Mae Hong Son Loop, an unforgettable achievement! You‚Äôve tackled 1864 curves and 700KM of pure magic, surrounded by mountains, rivers, waterfalls, and breathtaking views. Along the way, you connected with local villages, experienced the genuine warmth of Thai hospitality, and indulged in some amazing Thai food. Every twist and turn brought new adventures, new faces, and memories that will last a lifetime.

Along with weightlifting and running, I've lost so much weight and put on muscle. I'm in the best shape of my life and feel great! I eat lots of protein/fats and keep my carbs down to a minimum. No sugar, starch, grains, corn, fast food, UPF, and other garbage. I start my day off with a tablespoon of butter and coconut oil in my coffee. I have about four eggs, bacon, sausages, and an avocado at breakfast. I make sure to get plenty of fats and protein throughout the day, which are the only essential macronutrients. I aim for at least 50 grams of saturated fat. I will usually have a bacon chicken salad with plenty of mayo and whole milk cottage cheese for lunch. For dinner, I'll have 70/30 hamburger/sausage with cheese and avocado mayo. I will eat until I feel full. For snack, I will eat plenty of nuts/avocado. I've lost 70 lbs, my triglycerides and LDL has never been lower. My HDL has never been higher. No insulin resistance for me! You can do a lot with exercise and a proper human diet!

# Welcome to the Age of AI-Powered Ideas

Ever feel like you have the drive to start something new, something yours, but the ""what"" remains elusive? You're not alone. Coming up with a solid business idea ‚Äì one that excites you and has real potential ‚Äì can feel like searching for a needle in a haystack. Sometimes the ideas flow too freely, becoming overwhelming. Other times, the well feels completely dry. It's a common hurdle for aspiring entrepreneurs everywhere.

But what if you had a brainstorming partner? Not just any partner, but one with access to vast amounts of data, market trends, and insights into what's working right now? That's where artificial intelligence steps onto the scene. We're not talking about robots taking over (far from it!), but about smart tools designed specifically to help spark creativity and refine those initial glimmers of inspiration into viable business concepts.

Think of these AI business idea generators as creative collaborators. They crunch the numbers, spot patterns, and present possibilities you might never have considered. They can help break through creative blocks and provide a data-informed starting point for your entrepreneurial journey. This article is your friendly guide to some of the most interesting AI tools available today, designed to help you find and shape that next great idea. We‚Äôll explore 15 different generators, each with its own unique flavor, to help you discover which might be the perfect fit for your aspirations.

# Why Bother with AI for Business Ideas?

It's a fair question. Brainstorming has traditionally been a very human activity, often involving whiteboards, sticky notes, and lots of coffee. So why bring artificial intelligence into the mix? Well, these tools offer some distinct advantages, especially in today's fast-moving world.

# Cutting Through the Noise

The internet is overflowing with business advice, trend reports, and ""get rich quick"" schemes. It's easy to get lost or sidetracked. AI idea generators are programmed to sift through this vast ocean of information, identifying patterns and opportunities that align with specific criteria or your stated interests. They can filter out the irrelevant chatter and present you with more focused possibilities, saving you precious time and mental energy.

# Finding Hidden Opportunities

Humans tend to think based on their own experiences and biases. We often gravitate towards ideas in fields we already know. AI, on the other hand, isn't limited by personal history. It can analyze data across countless industries and markets, potentially uncovering niche opportunities or underserved customer groups that wouldn't normally appear on your radar. It might connect seemingly unrelated trends to suggest innovative concepts you hadn't imagined.

# Speeding Up Your Startup Journey

Researching market viability, analyzing competitors, and even just brainstorming different angles for an idea takes time ‚Äì lots of it. AI tools can significantly accelerate this initial phase. They can generate lists of potential ideas quickly, offer preliminary market insights, and sometimes even help outline initial steps or potential challenges. This doesn't replace deep research, but it gives you a much faster starting point, allowing you to move towards validation and action more swiftly. Think of it as getting a curated list of possibilities instead of starting with a completely blank page.

# Meet Your AI Brainstorming Partners: 15 Tools to Explore

# Beyond Just Ideas: What Else Can These AI Tools Do?

While the primary function is sparking that initial concept, many of these AI tools are evolving to offer more. Think of them as moving from just being brainstormers to becoming early-stage strategic assistants.

# Validation and Market Fit Checks

Some generators are starting to incorporate basic market validation features. They might cross-reference an idea against existing market data, search volume trends, or demographic information to give you an early indication of potential interest or competition. This isn't a substitute for talking to real customers, but it can provide a helpful first filter.

# Crafting Your Initial Pitch

A few tools, like FoundrBot, are dipping their toes into helping you articulate your idea. They might generate outlines for a business plan, suggest key points for a pitch deck, or even draft introductory paragraphs explaining the concept and its value. This can be a great way to overcome writer's block when trying to describe your nascent venture.

# Connecting the Dots (Networking, Domains)

As seen with VenturePrompt, some AI platforms are looking beyond the idea itself to the resources needed to bring it to life. Checking for domain name availability might seem small, but it's a practical early step. Suggestions for potential collaborators or advisors based on the idea's field can also point you in useful directions for building a team or network.

# Looking Ahead: The Future of AI in Starting Businesses

The role of AI in entrepreneurship is only set to grow. What we're seeing now with these idea generators is likely just the beginning.

# From Idea Generator to Strategic Partner

In the future, these tools will probably become even more integrated into the entire startup lifecycle. Imagine an AI assistant that not only suggests an idea but also helps you refine the business model, identifies target customer segments with greater accuracy, predicts potential revenue streams, and even flags potential regulatory hurdles. They could evolve from simple suggestion engines into dynamic strategic advisors, offering ongoing guidance based on real-time data.

# Making Entrepreneurship More Accessible

One of the most exciting prospects is AI's potential to lower the barrier to entry for starting a business. By automating parts of the research and planning process, providing data-driven insights, and offering structured guidance, these tools could make entrepreneurship feel less intimidating and more achievable for a wider range of people, regardless of their background or prior business experience. They could help level the playing field, offering sophisticated analysis that was once only available to large corporations or well-funded startups.

# Getting Started with an AI Idea Generator

Feeling intrigued? Ready to give one of these AI tools a try? Here are a few simple tips to get the most out of the experience:

# Define Your Interests (Loosely)

While AI can surprise you, it often works best with some direction. Think about general areas you're passionate about, problems you've noticed, skills you possess, or industries that pique your curiosity. Having even a loose starting point can help the AI provide more relevant suggestions. Don't be too narrow, though ‚Äì let the tool surprise you!

# Experiment with Different Tools

As you've seen, different generators have different strengths and focuses. Don't be afraid to try out a few. One might resonate more with your thinking style than another. See which interface feels intuitive and which type of output sparks the most inspiration for you. Many offer free trials or basic free versions to get started.

# Remember the Human Element

AI generators are powerful tools, but they are just that ‚Äì tools. They provide suggestions, data points, and inspiration. They don't replace your intuition, your passion, or the hard work required to build a real business. Use the AI output as a starting point, a catalyst for your own thinking. Validate the ideas through real-world research, talking to potential customers, and using your own judgment. The best results come from combining the analytical power of AI with human creativity, insight, and determination.

Starting a new venture is an exciting journey, and the idea phase is where it all begins. These AI business idea generators offer a fascinating new way to kickstart that process, providing data-informed sparks to ignite your entrepreneurial spirit. Whether you use LaunchScope for its structured approach, IdeaPulse for its trend-spotting ability, or CreativeMuse AI for its artistic focus, these tools can be valuable partners in exploring the vast landscape of possibilities. As AI continues to develop, its role in helping shape the businesses of tomorrow will undoubtedly grow, making this an incredibly interesting space to watch ‚Äì and participate in. So go ahead, explore some of these tools, and see what future venture you might spark!

1kkq56i,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreditCardsIndia/comments/1kkq56i/au_ixigo_in_europe/,AU Ixigo in Europe,"So I just did a Berlin - Amsterdam trip and I had just carried about ‚Ç¨300 for a 10 day trip. Had put all my faith on AU Ixigo and here is an honest review.

1. The card worked flawlessly everywhere. No forex markup and it used the current day's exchange rate for conversion. Make sure to always pay in local currency and not INR.

2. I had not informed AU that I am travelling and will be spending in Europe, so on day 2 they blocked my card. I had read lot of reddit posts which said they block your card and there's no way to get it unblocked since you don't get OTP, etc etc. All I had to do was drop a mail to the credit card helpdesk, CCing PNO. Within 2 hours it was unblocked.

3. I literally used it everywhere from small street food spots to shopping in the mall. I just came across 1 instance in a small coffee shop in Utrecht where it wasn't accepted as they did not accepted ANY credit cards period. Only cash and debit cards were accepted.

4. There is a bike/scooter rental app called DOTT, where i added the card but it was not going through because I needed OTP to authorize the transaction. But there was a way around it, I added my PayPal and used AU ixigo to top up PayPal wallet. This charged a little fees, for example if our ride cost was ‚Ç¨2, which was roughly Rs. 195, PayPal charged around 10% for each transaction. Its a bit steep but it was only for bike rides and it was the only way, we had bought the monthly pass so each ride of 30 minutes was just ‚Ç¨2 so maybe overall i would've paid Rs. 200-250 extra throughout my stay for the bikes.

Overall, it's one of the best cards to use outside India with no hidden fees whatsoever. I suggest anyone who wants a 0 forex credit card for Europe, I can vouch that AU Ixigo works very well.

**Memory transcript: Sol-Vah, Exhausted Gojid Volunteer Disaster Respondent. Date: \[Standardized human time\] October 31st, 2136.**

My breathing was heavy as I helped to lead yet more displaced refugees from the smoldering apartment building, the remaining smoke in the hallways thankfully blocked by my returned helmet‚Äôs ventilation system. Noise surrounded me on all sides: fervent and disorganized chatter from the group I was leading outside, sirens blaring both from the raid response vehicles and from emergency towers around the city‚Äîa sure sign that the magistratta was well aware of the current situation‚Äîand worst of all, the nearly inaudible sobs of those who‚Äôd lost someone in the violence. It was a thought I didn‚Äôt like thinking about, but I knew that it was something I couldn‚Äôt afford to not consider. The pain I felt at their cries was a constant reminder that what remained of the person I was, before this all broke out, was still kicking somewhere inside me, and I wasn‚Äôt going to let her go without a fight.

*I‚Äôve still got a job to do, predation be damned.*

I threw open the doors, moving to hold one of them open as I gestured for the herd to keep moving. ‚ÄúTHIS WAY! COME ON, THERE‚ÄôS MEDICAL AID FOR ANYONE INJURED! KEEP MOVING!‚Äù I was grateful they heeded my instructions, piling out of the building in an amorphous mass of people. Despite the limited impact of the fires, some were marred with burns, the similar injury along my cheek flaring up in sympathy. I could see a few had children in their arms, some crying, some not moving at all.¬†

I felt my spines flex beneath my suit as the last of the herd filtered out, and I quickly moved to try and swim through the center of the mass so I could return to lead them towards the nearest response vehicle. However, as I approached the front, I saw a familiar face: the same Venlil who‚Äôd brandished the taser at me previously. He obviously noticed the herd of new refugees approaching, but once his eye locked onto me, his tail stood straight out and he once more held out his defensive instrument towards me, and by extension, the rest of the herd. ‚ÄúB-back! You- I won't let you hurt them more!‚Äù

*Is he being serious right now?!*

‚ÄúI‚Äôve already told you, I‚Äôm not with them!!‚Äù I called back out, an exasperated tone in my voice despite my best efforts to the contrary. I knew that this situation was stressful, but we couldn‚Äôt have had that conversation more than \[25 minutes\] ago! As I moved, I saw that the Gojid directly to my left had serious burns across their body; this wasn‚Äôt the time to be held up, people were injured for the Protector‚Äôs sake! ‚ÄúPlease, help! This one got burned badly!‚Äù

The responder continued to hold his taser out towards us, right up until a familiar, bark-like call cut across the commotion. *‚ÄúAYE!!‚Äù* When I looked over in the direction of the sound, I saw Jacob‚Äôs helmetless form pushing past what looked to be a couple more Venlil, seemingly with something in tow. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs good! She helped people, ain‚Äôt with the jackasses!‚Äù

Despite his assurances, they *still* didn‚Äôt lower their weapon; the stubborn puddle of spehk! However, one of the Venlil that Jacob had pushed past burst out in front of him and started speaking to them, followed by the other one. While I didn‚Äôt recognize the gray one, the one actively engaging the respondent triggered something in my memory. Where had I seen those white spots before? Were they another officer, or‚Äî

*Wait, is that‚Ä¶ Is that the woman I‚Äôve seen hanging around Tarlim? Is that the ‚ÄúSharnet‚Äù who Jacob called? Why would she of all people be arguing for my trustworthiness after everything I‚Äôve done to Tarlim? Jacob I could at least rationalize as a predator working towards a common end we share, but* her\*?\*

I wasn‚Äôt given much time to ponder on that, as the Gray one quickly pulled her away towards the vehicle I knew to have Tarlim on it, with Jacob not far behind once he realized where they were going. The package he had in tow turned out to be a Gojid bound to a wheelchair, a stark reminder of the [refugee sponsor event](https://www.reddit.com/r/NatureofPredators/comments/14cjg2k/the_nature_of_a_giant_54/) where I‚Äôd finally come to terms with how horribly I‚Äôd treated Tarlim‚Äîat the moment, at least‚Äî and yet another event I‚Äôd much rather blot from my mind. I couldn‚Äôt quite make out what they were saying due to the even-further elevated noise levels out there, but if that was indeed the Sharnet that Jacob had been talking about, I could easily discern what it was they were doing.

*I wish them luck, but my job isn‚Äôt done yet.*

With the responder more or less neutralized from his jumpy state, I approached the front of the herd with the injured man. The brown Venlil still eyed me with suspicion, but that much I could handle; he wasn‚Äôt the only one suspicious of my seemingly altruistic tendencies, after all. ‚ÄúThis one‚Äôs going to need a *lot* of burn salve. I also saw a few broken legs and some unresponsive children in the herd, so I‚Äôd recommend you act fast. I‚Äôve got more to lead back out, so be ready.‚Äù

The respondent, to his credit, simply flicked his ears and tail at me and stepped to the side, guiding the herd into the massive vehicle to be properly sorted and treated. Satisfied that my role there had been played, I pathed my way around the herd I‚Äôd just delivered to return back to the burning building, but to my surprise, both Kaeden and the metal Venlil were outside discussing something. Last I knew, they were both hard at work guiding those deep inside the structure towards the exits to be retrieved and guided out: to see them here either meant good news or very, *very* bad news. Regardless, I wasn‚Äôt going to learn of it by standing off, so with a small breath, I continued forwards toward the small congregation to receive updates on the situation.

The first to notice me was the metal Venlil, who turned his bulky helmet towards me and placed a paw on his hip, or as I quickly saw, the hilt of some sort of melee weapon. However, the human quickly placed a hand on their shoulder, which got them to back down. I‚Äôd already proven myself a non-threat to them, so the gesture on behalf of Kaeden was appreciated, if not somewhat disconcerting that I was now allied with not one, but *two* predators. ‚ÄúAh, Silver, you‚Äôre alive as well.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going on?‚Äù I asked, taking a quick moment to catch my breath. ‚ÄúWhat are you two doing outside? I thought you were guiding people out.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe were, we just ran out,‚Äù Kaeden said, wiping what looked to be water from his furless forehead behind his mask. ‚ÄúWe got everyone we could out, from the top floors to the bottom. But‚Ä¶ we couldn‚Äôt get everyone.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat? What do you mean ‚Äòyou couldn‚Äôt get everyone?‚Äô‚Äù I asked, desperately hoping that didn‚Äôt mean what I thought it did.

‚ÄúThere was a conference room that the people had gathered in, that was keeping some of the more injured people in,‚Äù the metal Venlil took over, their voice distorted slightly from the hard casing that surrounded his head. ‚ÄúWe sent out the healthy ones, we thought they could get to safety with who they could take and we would handle the rest. But we weren‚Äôt aware that there was a fire in the ceiling grid. We got everyone out that we could, but as we came for the last dozen, part of the grid fell down at the door. I tried to move it, but that just made the whole grid collapse‚Ä¶ collapse right on top of them.‚Äù

*‚ÄúNo‚Ä¶‚Äù* I whispered, the words like a bullet to the chest. I knew that death was more than certainly a possibility, but to hear that so many had perished all at once‚Ä¶ and‚Ä¶ *And it‚Äôs their fault.* ‚ÄúWhy the *Brahk* would you try it on your own?! You saw something collapse and then immediately tried to move it? You *knew* that there was still a fire risk, what‚Äôs wrong with you?!‚Äù

‚ÄúWe had no other choice!‚Äù The metal Venlil retorted, tilting his head down as if to threaten a headbutt. ‚ÄúThe healthy ones didn‚Äôt have *any* protection! You wouldn‚Äôt know anything about that, though, would you? You and your fire-retardant suit were content with just leading people outside instead of helping where you would be *actually useful!*‚Äù

I recoiled from the venom in his words, but my shock quickly melted into something else. *Blue-hot Rage.* My spines flared behind me, struggling against the tear-resistant confines of my suit, and before I could stop myself, I had already poked a claw into the Venlil‚Äôs chestplate. ‚ÄúOh no, you do *not* get to criticize me for ‚Äònot helping!‚Äô I‚Äôve had to fight against people I‚Äôve considered friends, I‚Äôve had to team up with *literal predators,* I almost *Killed* someone else to protect the innocent! I‚Äôve lost *EVERYTHING* I ever had to an extent you couldn‚Äôt even *begin* to imagine, so I‚Äôm *not* about to let *you* tell *me* that I‚Äôm. Not. HELPING!!‚Äù

The metal Venlil growled at me, and I growled back, but before things could progress any further, I felt a hard force against my chest and the two of us were suddenly separated, the masked visage of Kaeden stepping in between us. ‚ÄúEnough, both of you! You two fighting isn‚Äôt going to help *anyone,* what‚Äôs done is done! The last thing we need right now is more *fucking violence!*‚Äù

His words, as hard as they were to hear, were right. Despite the blood rushing in my ears, I could still see the carnage and destruction wrought by the ‚ÄòTrue Exterminators‚Äô around me. I didn‚Äôt want to aid in their mission‚Äîto *any* capacity‚Äîso with a huff, I stepped back of my own volition, forcing my spines down as I fought back tears. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre‚Ä¶ right. I‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm going to see if I can do anything more to help.‚Äù

The metal Venlil didn‚Äôt return the gesture, but at that point, I really didn‚Äôt care. I was already stressed and overwhelmed beyond my limits, and Kaeden was right: the last thing this district needed was any more senseless violence. I shuffled back to where the herds had been directed to, only to find the last of the injured being loaded onto the second transport. The one that contained Tarlim had already left, and in its wake, I could see Jacob watching the remnants of the herd being loaded in. Once he saw me, he bared his teeth at me and started approaching. If I was in any reasonable state, that would‚Äôve scared me spehkless, but now?

*I‚Äôm just tired.*

‚ÄúSol-Vah!‚Äù He called, approaching my position as I was further drained of my energy by the ebbing of anger from my mind. ‚ÄúGood news! Sharnet got here nice an‚Äô quick, they‚Äôre gonna make sure Tarlim‚Äôs doin‚Äô ahlraht! Thank Gawd fer that, I thought I‚Äôd haf‚Äôta‚Ä¶‚Äù His speech trailed off as he continued to stare at me with his uncovered eyes, and his expression changed. ‚ÄúHey, are *you* feelin‚Äô ahlraht? Yer‚Ä¶ uh, standin‚Äô atta bit of an angle there.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I answered candidly before collapsing onto the curb, barely managing to keep myself upright. Every muscle in my body ached from the nonstop action for what felt like *claws* at this point, but I knew I couldn‚Äôt give up. There were still people in danger, and every \[second\] I spent resting was a \[second\] less someone else might have to be saved. To my surprise, the blue-suited human sat alongside me, and in the interest of not showing weakness, I managed to sputter out a reply. ‚ÄúWhat‚Ä¶ what about you?‚Äù

‚ÄúBetter now that Ah know someone‚Äôs gonna be watchin‚Äô over Tarlim,‚Äù Jacob responded before closing his binocular eyes and leaning back, a groan coming from what sounded like his chest. ‚ÄúAh fuck, if Ah‚Äôd known things would be this bad, Ah‚Äôd have gotten mahself a *coffee* or sumthin‚Äô.‚Äù

That was a sentiment I could agree upon‚Äîwith tea, but that notwithstanding‚Äîand I mustered enough energy for a half-hearted chuckle. ‚ÄúCheh, yeah‚Ä¶ *huhn.*‚Äù I hadn‚Äôt quite considered that the energy I expended on that comment would constitute the *last* of my reserves, but as soon as the words had left my mouth, I found myself lying side-on on the pavement, unable to get up. Sleep pulled at my eyes despite my still heavy breathing, but I knew that I couldn‚Äôt surrender myself to its influence yet. The True Exterminators were still at large, and who knew who they could threaten next? *More refugees‚Ä¶ regular civilians‚Ä¶ Kalek‚Ä¶*

*Kalek‚Ä¶ Dad. DAD!!*

For the‚Äîhonestly, I‚Äôd lost count by that point‚Äîtime that paw, I shot directly up and a single word left my maw. ‚ÄúDAD!!‚Äù Jacob was utterly shocked by my sudden resurgence of strength, and even more so by my haste to pull him to his feet. He wasn‚Äôt even able to manage a proper word before I cut him off to explain. ‚ÄúJacob, my dad‚Äôs a Krakotl! He‚Äôs in the same shuttle as I am, that all these people are! What if they go after him, too?!‚Äù

Despite my worries that Jacob would be unwilling to aid me in this endeavor for one reason or another, as soon as the words had registered for him, his eyebrows furrowed and he curtly nodded his head. I wasn‚Äôt exactly sure what that meant, so after a brief moment of confusion, he finally vocalized his intent. ‚ÄúAhlraht, then. You know where to go?‚Äù

‚ÄúSort of: all I have is an address but, unless the navigation system is down, I should be able to route us there,‚Äù I replied as we both made our way towards the still-running hotwired van. However, as I attempted to open the handle, I found something blocking my paw. Looking down, I found I was holding an ornate knife of some kind, the markings similar to‚Ä¶ to‚Ä¶ *Oh, Protector Damn me, I stole this off the Metal Venlil!* I let out a frustrated bark and threw the piece to the ground for the unrepentant brahkass to find later, entering the van and fastening myself in. Jacob followed suit, and before a \[minute\] had passed, we were already on our way towards my father‚Äôs new place.

The trip felt‚Ä¶ strange. My lack of rest was likely starting to affect my cognition, but I couldn‚Äôt afford even a moment of that while Dad‚Äôs life was still in danger from those murderous, flamer-wielding lunatics. The streets were more or less abandoned, with the occasional raid response vehicle being visible on adjacent streets, but the closest we came to running into one was zooming down a street that had obviously been cleared by one previously. I didn‚Äôt mind, it made the trip easier for us, and moreover, it allowed us to go faster much to Jacob‚Äôs dismay. ‚ÄúJaysus, Sol-Vah, yer gonna crash! Slow down a lil‚Äô!‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll slow down once I‚Äôm sure Dad‚Äôs okay!‚Äù I swiftly replied, applying the accelerator more as we entered onto a stretch of roadway meant for high-speed travel. I knew I was well-exceeding the speed where most autodrivers would apply the brakes on, but that was a perk of Office equipment: safety features were oft optional, which I was greatly thankful for in our current situation. I followed the route that had been generated for us, watching the sky for any smoke clouds that might indicate the True Exterminators had continued their rampage out this far. Fortunately, there were none in sight, but once we arrived at our destination, the sight I witnessed made my heart drop more than any smoke cloud ever could.

‚Äú*Mah Gawd,‚Äù* I heard Jacob mutter under his breath, but I didn‚Äôt care. At the top of the building was what looked to be a partially-plucked Krakotl, both their wings stripped bare and clearly broken from the looks of things. I recognized the greenish tint well enough to recognize my father, and the clearly battered state he was in filled me with fury. If I found the predatory *bastard* that mutilated my father like that, I‚Äôd‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd‚Ä¶!

*SHIT! NOT THE TIME FOR PREDATOR THOUGHTS! FOCUS, PROTECTOR DAMN IT!*

I slammed on the brakes, barely remembering to set the van to park before jumping out. Jacob, ready for my sudden stop this time, followed in kind, and the two of us made our way towards the building. Surprisingly, there was a Venlil at the base of the building, looking up towards Dad and calling out to him. At first, I assumed they were one of the assailants and began to see blue, but their words quickly quelled that notion. ‚ÄúDON‚ÄôT JUMP! YOU KNOW YOUR WINGS WON‚ÄôT HOLD YOU LIKE THAT!! I- uh- I WILL CATCH YOU IF YOU TRY!!‚Äù‚Äù

Dad was planning to jump off the roof?? That could only mean that those who‚Äôd hurt him were still inside somewhere! As we approached, the Venlil yelped and cowered away. ‚ÄúExterminator!! P-Please, don‚Äôt hurt me! I-I‚Äôm prey, see?? Prey!‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not going to hurt you!‚Äù I provided the Venlil a quick assurance, slamming through the double-doors of the complex to‚Ä¶ an untouched reception area? If the True Exterminators were still inside, they hadn‚Äôt done much to the lobby: the receptionist‚Äôs desk was untouched and a Holovision was playing a still image of the district‚Äôs interrupted connection signal. But I‚Äôd seen Dad beaten and battered on the roof! That meant they were likely going from top to bottom! He‚Äôd probably trapped them in his apartment to contain their destruction!

*That‚Äôs where we need to go!*

Jacob entered the building after me just as I began climbing the stairway towards the top floor. The complex was about \[9 stories\] tall, and as soon as the third floor, my leg began to burn once again, but I didn‚Äôt care. My father was in danger, and I wasn‚Äôt about to let them take *anything else* from me! By the time I reached the top floor, I was panting hard and my legs felt like liquid, but I pushed myself past the pain and ran down the hallway towards Dad‚Äôs unit. *922, 924, 926! Here!*

‚ÄúSol-Vah, wait!‚Äù I heard Jacob‚Äôs voice from down the hall, his tone as breathy as my own, but I didn‚Äôt pay him any mind. I banged against the door repeatedly as the blue-clad human approached, but it remained steadfast in its blockage. It was only when I put all my strength behind it did it finally give in, the lock breaking loose and allowing me entry into what I could only assume was the den of True Exterminator activity. My shoulder screamed out in pain, one that worsened to nearly unbearable levels when I moved to right myself, but I couldn‚Äôt afford to worry about that when I had a fight ahead of me! However, what I found wasn‚Äôt a waiting ambush, but rather an‚Ä¶ empty apartment?

I scanned the area, looking for anything that might suggest a struggle, and a struggle I did find. Greenish feathers littered the ground, and purple blood splattered the countertops and the sides of furniture, but none of any other color. Had the True Exterminators simply gone after him and left? I-I‚Ä¶ I needed to find out!

‚ÄúSol-Vah!‚Äù Jacob‚Äôs voice called out from the doorway, the human panting almost as hard as I was. ‚ÄúWe need to get to the roof! Why are-‚Äú

‚ÄúHE HAS ACCESS IN HERE!‚Äù I bellowed, making my way to the back of the apartment. My arm continued to keep me in agony, my logical mind quickly coming to the conclusion that I‚Äôd broken my shoulder in the process of my forced entry. But I didn‚Äôt have time for that, I needed to make sure Dad was okay! ‚ÄúOver here!!‚Äù

I opened the door with my good arm and raced up one final flight of stairs towards my father. Jacob looked to want to say something else in my periphery, but he didn‚Äôt get the chance before I was out of sight. With hope that the door to the roof wasn‚Äôt locked as well‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt think I could withstand another broken shoulder‚ÄîI placed my paw on the manual handle and pushed. Thankfully, it swung right open, and I burst out onto the windy rooftop area reserved for Kalek‚Äôs unit, and-

*Dad. Dad is in pain.*

I hadn‚Äôt been able to understand the extent of Dad‚Äôs injuries from the ground, but now that I was standing right beside him, they were clear as day. His wings were mangled, twisted and broken to the point where I could see bumps in his bare wings where I knew there shouldn‚Äôt be any. His cool-colored skin was cut and torn, something I shouldn‚Äôt have been able to see at all, with a great many feathers missing from his body and especially his battered wings. His beak looked almost bent, as it‚Äôd been slammed against something with incredible force. When he finally noticed me, he turned to face me and I saw that on top of everything else, one of his eyes was swollen shut. With a weak voice, he croaked out something that made my heart burn. ‚ÄúA-Ah, here to finish the job officially?‚Äù

*He thinks I‚Äôm one of them.*

I quickly undid my helmet, throwing the mirrored visage as far away as I could. It clattered to the ground in the corner of the plot, and once he recognized my face, I saw him tense up. ‚ÄúS-Sol-Vah? What‚Ä¶ what are you doing here?‚Äù

‚ÄúDad, Dad I‚Äôm here!!‚Äù I pleaded with him, stepping closer towards him in an attempt to approach him for an embrace, but I froze in my tracks when I saw his talons shift closer to the edge. My eyes darted between them and his face, my mind struggling to put the pieces together. ‚ÄúW-What are you doing? What is- I-I don‚Äôt understand. I‚Äôm here, t-the True Exterminators are gone! T-There‚Äôs so much going on, but we can- we can‚Äî!‚Äù

‚ÄúWh- why are you here?‚Äù He repeated, his chirp wavering in a way I hadn‚Äôt heard from him‚Ä¶ *ever.* ‚ÄúYou must have seen the truth, right? You‚Ä¶ You know what I am, what *we* are?‚Äù

*Predators.*

Before I could react, I heard the sound of the door opening once more behind me, and Jacob‚Äôs uncovered visage burst out. ‚ÄúSol-Vah, You gotta‚Äî!‚Äù

He was cut off by Kalek squawking and getting even closer to the edge. ‚ÄúNO!!‚Äù I screamed, reaching out towards both Dad and Jacob to stop. My shoulder burned with agony rivaling my flamer scar, but I maintained my stance. They both halted immedaitely, and what was left was a scene with so much tension I felt as though my mind itself would break under the pressure. Once I was certain that things were at least *somewhat stable,* I turned my attention back to the human. ‚ÄúJacob, you need to leave! You‚Äôre going to scare him!‚Äù

‚ÄúYou *know him??*‚Äù Kalek asked, confusion and betrayal in his voice, but Jacob quickly spoke afterwards.

‚ÄúAh can‚Äôt do that, Sol-Vah!‚Äù He said, taking a slow, careful step to the side. ‚ÄúAh ain‚Äôt aboutta let yer daddy throw himself off the edge!‚Äù

*‚Ä¶What?*

I carefully turned my attention towards my defeathered father, and suddenly so many things clicked into place. His injured state, the lack of any signs of a struggle that didn‚Äôt relate to him, the Venlil at the bottom telling him not to jump. *Had‚Ä¶ had he done this to himself.* ‚ÄúK-Kalek, did you‚Ä¶were you‚Ä¶?‚Äù

‚ÄúW-We‚Äôre‚Ä¶ *I‚Äôm* tainted, Sol-Vah,‚Äù he argued, turning his good eye to face me. ‚ÄúI-I don‚Äôt want to hurt anyone. The only way a predator doesn‚Äôt hurt anyone‚Ä¶ is for a predator to be dead.‚ÄùI watched as Jacob slowly shuffled around towards the side where Kalek‚Äôs eye was swollen shut, and I realized what he was trying to do. I began moving toward the other side, keeping his good eye on me so that the more experienced predator could get the jump on him. To describe what I felt at being complicit in such a scheme‚Äîthe willing ambush of my own father‚Äî‚Äòguilt‚Äô would be an absolute understatement, but the alternative would be letting Dad die. I‚Äôd be willing to feed myself to an *Arxur* to circumvent that outcome.

‚ÄúNo, *No!* Dad, y-you don‚Äôt have to die!‚Äù I tried to reason, keeping Jacob in my periphery all the while as the human snuck up on Kalek. ‚ÄúDad, please, I-I know it‚Äôs hard, b-but‚Ä¶ but we help people! That‚Äôs what we do! W-Who *cares* what Nikonus or- or what *anyone else* says?? Please, I‚Ä¶‚Äù My voice caught in my throat and mucus started to pool in my nostrils. Jacob was almost within range, but‚Ä¶ I couldn‚Äôt take this, I couldn‚Äôt take the thought of losing Dad, not after everything else had already been ripped so callously from me. ‚ÄúI-I‚Äôve already lost s-so much. *I can‚Äôt lose you t-too!*‚Äù

I watched as Kalek‚Äôs good eye softened‚Ä¶ just in time for his injured form to be tackled by the blue mass that was Jacob. I looked away and suppressed a sob, halfway convinced that the predator was finally going to drop the facade and devour my father in front of me, but the sound of flesh being rended from bone never hit my ears. Rather, squawks of pain and struggled grunts could be heard, and when I looked back, I saw Jacob restraining Dad as he tried to claw at him. ‚ÄúDamnit, birdy! Ya ain‚Äôt gonna toss yerself overboard while yer daughter‚Äôs right there; I ain‚Äôt gonna let‚Äôcha!!‚Äù

Dad continued to struggle for a moment more, but his squawks quickly devolved into a sound I knew all too well: *crying.* He stopped struggling, and as soon as that happened, Jacob released him to the ground and fell back. I didn‚Äôt waste a \[millisecond\] more, rushing over and collapsing Dad in as strong a hug as I could muster. Pain flared‚Äîboth in my arm and my face‚Äî but I didn‚Äôt care, I *couldn‚Äôt* care. I felt the tears finally start to run from my eyes as anything I could‚Äôve said was consumed entirely by desperate, wracking sobs. So much had happened, but Dad was safe, he was safe, *I‚Äôm safe, he‚Äôs safe‚Ä¶*

*He‚Äôs‚Ä¶ safe‚Ä¶*

I'm looking for a suitable girl partner for at least 8 years already. I've been married (for 2 years, divorced after that), had several other partners, but none of them is suitable for me. I'm 32M, 185/80, slim, hair style like Jason Statham, IT-specialist. I have a car and recently moved to an own flat. So my income and living standards are above the ones of most people in my place. Seems like my girlfriend should be like me.

One of main difficulties in dating for me are my views on life. It's unacceptable for me to pay for someone I don't know very well, except small sums like a public transport ticket or a cup of tea/coffee. And many women in my place want men to pay for them. Besides, I don't mind having a baby (so, a woman should have such wish). This narrows down an already small circle of potential candidates. I think I'm not the only person having difficulties with dating. So the standard of living and population growth are suffering.

While walking around the city with a friend, I had the following thought. What if we had an automatic way of choosing a suitable partner? So, for a certain search:

1. Find all people of suitable for both persons age (intersection) and sex in his/her city, for whom a partner search is relevant.
2. Take all having data (for example, replies to the questionnaire, visual preferences, social rating - if we have an access to government systems).
3. Build an output, ranged by replies to the questionnaire, social rating, visual preferences.

So as a result - an exact offer of a suitable partner, like you choosing him/her in a shop =)

How do you think - may this be real and bring the desired result (a certain person is able to find a suitable partner without spending a lot of time on wrong people)? Or this will result in another useless dating app?",1,1747049142.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

Here's something ironic, I've struggled my entire life with staying on track. Executive function? It's usually out grabbing coffee while I'm wondering what day it is. Yet, somehow, I've built a successful professional career managing projects, teams, and complex logistics. Funny, isn't it? I could lead a team across three states, but couldn't keep track of my own wallet.

Recently it hit me (two decades late, but who's counting?). Why not manage my life with the same compassion, intentionality, and clear processes I've successfully used in my career? Turns out, it works.

I won't pretend I've figured everything out. My journey isn't about perfection, it's about iteration. ""Progress over validation,"" as I always remind myself. It‚Äôs about showing up every day, even when it's messy (especially when it's messy). And I can sincerely say, at nearly 40, this is the most sustained, fulfilling, and tangible growth I've ever experienced.

I've even quit smoking after 24 years, a milestone I honestly wasn't sure I'd ever achieve (haven't had one in over 7 months). It's incredible how changing my approach, embracing structure without rigidity, practicing self-compassion, and prioritizing small, consistent steps, has made such a difference.

Yes, even my tracker has trackers. But jokes aside, this isn't about the tools. It's about finally acknowledging that my brain isn‚Äôt broken; it just thrives with intentional structure and compassionate accountability. It took me decades to accept that. I'm hoping this might help someone else reach that realization sooner.

If you've felt stuck, overwhelmed, or like you're constantly running two steps behind, I get it. I'd love to hear your experiences, your wins (big or small), or how you're learning to work with your brain, not against it.

Here's to embracing our beautifully complicated brains and building a life that feels authentic, intentional, and full of purpose.",5,1747049021.0,AdultADHDSupportGroup,2,0.86,False

We met at a young age, you were wild, kind at heart and a free spirit, while I was focused, goal driven and determind to find my meaning in life.

At your 20th, our paths crossed, and our chapter began. We have been just about everywhere, experienced everything and seen every corner with stoties to tell and share, miles long.

Fast forward 8 years, we got engadged, got a place of our own and began to plan and settle down.

We were happy, I was happy, everyting fell in place, then, something started to rumble. Your attention diverted, your focus had a shift, your were mentally drawn away from our goals. This left me feeling more and more alone, pushed aside and wanting to find what we had lost and forgotten. I felt like at times I was to blame for your shift, maybe I could have done more to catch and hold your attention.

I started to seek attention I could not find from you anymore, I wanted to find you in places where I use to be with you.

During this time, I admit I went down a rabit hole I didn't have enough strength to claw from. I began to pull my attention and effort from you and this lead to me distancing myself, more and more each day as time passed.

Our journey came to an screeching hold, I made choices I am not proud of, and you made some I am sure you regret as well. This went side-ways, the one thing lead to another, and before I could realise, we were no more. A chapter of life lessons, choices and consequences beyond my logical perspective at the time.

3 years later, I still find myself, wondering where we went wrong, had I fought harder would we have been able to save us, and where would have been today. My mind plays over and over again searching for those times I could have turned it around, saved us, saved you, and maybe saved you from all the pain I had rain on you.

I saw you a few times in the last 3 years, maybe one of those were meant for me to grab onto, say ""Hi, how are you?"", but I couldn't force myself. You promised me, the day we parted, we'd stay in touch, in 5 years time we would meet up and check in with each other, over a cup of our favorite coffee. 

I still hope we do. I still hope fate has this planned out in our cards. 

Life has made some major detours with me, I have been in some deep depths, but I made it, I am here, alive and grinding along. I truly hope you are well, I hope you are happy and I hope with all of me you have reached the goals you set yourself out to achieve.

I miss you, you'll always have a special place in my heart.

Untill we meet again, untill our paths cross again, I hope and pray you stay safe, you are happy and you become the person you deserve to be.

1kkpyqe,https://www.reddit.com/r/teachinginprague/comments/1kkpyqe/what_surprised_you_most_about_teaching_in_prague/,What surprised you most about teaching in Prague compared to your expectations? üá®üáø‚ú®,"When I first boarded a plane to Prague with all my belongings, having made the leap from Sydney to teach English and live abroad, I had a lot of expectations. So now that I‚Äôve been here a while, I thought I‚Äôd break down what I thought this experience would be like vs. how things turned out in real life. Hopefully, it helps someone who's dreaming about making the leap!

**Expectation #1: ‚ÄúFinding work will be hard, and I‚Äôll probably be broke for a while.‚Äù**

Reality: I had a job within two weeks of finishing my course (and honestly could have gotten one earlier if I‚Äôd tried). Actually, I had options! Prague has so many teaching opportunities, from primary and high schools, to business English company classes, language schools, and private one-on-one lessons. I started by creating a Teacher Creature account and also used the connections I made through The Language House, and said yes to everything (which, I wouldn‚Äôt recommend long-term üòÖ). Within a month, I had a full schedule. I‚Äôm not a millionaire, obviously, but I can pay my rent, grab a pint at Letn√°, and even afford the occasional spontaneous Europe trip!

**Expectation #2: ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be standing in front of a whiteboard with 30 students every day.‚Äù**

Reality: I‚Äôve taught in caf√©s, offices, international schools, online, and I even have a student who enjoys grabbing coffee and walking along the river during our lessons. Most of my teaching is one-on-one or in small groups, and every student is different. Flexibility is key.

**Expectation #3: ‚ÄúTeaching will be easy. I speak English!‚Äù**

Reality: Speaking English ‚â† teaching English. There‚Äôs a lot of prep, quick thinking, and realising how weird English can be. The good news is, you get better fast. You find your rhythm, learn to plan smarter, and figure out how to explain confusing grammar rules without going crazy.

**Expectation #4: ‚ÄúI‚Äôll magically learn Czech just by living in Prague.‚Äù**

Reality: Czech is a beautiful language, but it‚Äôs very difficult. I know the basics, but fluency? Still a work in progress. Most Czechs speak decent English (especially in Prague), so it‚Äôs easy to coast. If you really want to learn, you‚Äôve got to be intentional. I‚Äôve started taking Czech lessons recently and highly recommend starting early!

**Expectation #5: ‚ÄúI‚Äôll feel like an outsider.‚Äù**

Reality: Prague has a huge expat community. Between The Language House alums, language schools, meetup groups, I especially love Girl Gone International - Prague (everyone‚Äôs so lovely!), trivia nights, Bumble BFF, and just randomly meeting people, I‚Äôve made some amazing and supportive connections. That‚Äôs not to say there aren‚Äôt hard days, but I‚Äôve never once regretted the move.

**Teaching in Prague isn‚Äôt without its challenges, but if you‚Äôre even considering it, take the leap. It‚Äôs not always what you expect, but that‚Äôs what makes it such an incredible adventure!**

1kkpwk7,https://www.reddit.com/r/transplant/comments/1kkpwk7/life_after_kidney_transplant_fit_24m_non_alcoholic/,Life after Kidney transplant fit 24M non alcoholic,"I‚Äôm a 24‚Äëyear‚Äëold Indian male, non‚Äëalcoholic (I‚Äôve had a drink only once or twice), and I had a kidney transplant on 21‚ÄØMarch‚ÄØ2024.

**Me before the transplant**  
I work in computer science, have a stable remote job, and I used to lift heavy weights. I took one scoop of protein a day and sometimes creatine. I‚Äôd drink black coffee or a pre‚Äëworkout before training. My big mistake was never checking my blood pressure or getting regular full body check‚Äëups.

One random day I had a full body check‚Äëup and found my creatinine was 5, which felt off. A week later, it was 7.

I went to the doctor with my mom, and my BP was 180/100. The doctor sent me straight to a nephrologist; they scared the hell out of me and said I needed a transplant ASAP.

For a random, healthy‚Äëfeeling guy, that was life‚Äëchanging and terrifying. I resisted, but a week later my creatinine hit 13. I rushed to the hospital, had a biopsy (ATG or something), and they said less than 20‚ÄØ% of my kidneys were working and the only option was a transplant.

They made a fistula and put me on dialysis for a few months while my family coped. After 2‚Äë3 months of dialysis, we decided on a transplant. My mom gave me her kidney‚Äîthanks to her.

**After the transplant**  
The day before surgery, right after my last dialysis, my creatinine was 18. After the transplant it dropped to 1.6.

I got a urinary infection, and it climbed to 3. The doctors did a biopsy and thankfully no rejection.

I was put on tacrolimus, and my creatinine slowly came down, but after a few weeks, it spiked again to 3. Another biopsy‚Äîstill no rejection.

My doctors switched me to cyclosporine; it didn‚Äôt work. Eventually they tried everolimus, and my creatinine dropped to 1.9. It‚Äôs been 3‚Äë4 months on everolimus (1.75‚ÄØmg BD) and I‚Äôm hovering around 2.0‚Äì2.3.

**Life now**  
I work out using my fistula arm, lift weights, run on the treadmill, and play badminton.

Mentally, I‚Äôm not that strong, but I can‚Äôt let my family see me fragile.

I can‚Äôt eat outside food, so it hurts to watch my family avoid restaurants when they‚Äôre with me. I try to convince them I‚Äôll take a small portion, but it‚Äôs still not the same.

I built my diet with ChatGPT, low‚Äëprotein and kidney‚Äëfriendly.

I‚Äôm grateful to be alive; I‚Äôm just sad my family had to see this. It‚Äôs hard living like this in your 20s. I miss the clubs, the parties, and traveling without worrying about food. I wonder how my 20s would have been if I were okay.

**Questions**

1. Everolimus is costly. Does anyone know a distributor in India? Does insurance cover it?
2. My creatinine is still high what can I do to make it better?
3. How can I remove mouth ulcers (side effect of everolimus)
4. I am a software engineer and I have developed a website to track my meds, reports etc, What do you guys use to track everything?
5. Can I drink now? I don't wanna be the lame guy at parties, and I wanna enjoy beer with my gf. 

If you‚Äôre surviving kidney‚Äîor any‚Äîtransplant issues, keep a strong, positive mindset. I think it‚Äôs going to be fine.",5,1747048532.0,transplant,1,1.0,False

Fanfic: The Great Shift

The scene takes place at Jim Beckett's country house while Kate is convalescing.

Kate is in a deckchair on the terrace, relaxing after having breakfast and enjoying the rays of the sun. Her father arrives with a coffee in hand and sits down next to her.



(Jim): hello Kate, I see you've decided to head outside today. It has to get better.

(Kate): Yes, Dad. My wound still pulls but I have less difficulty breathing and bending over. I managed to slip into this deckchair all by myself and I hope that I will be able to get out of it when the time comes but, for now, I am savoring the feat.

Perfect ! And I see that even your humor is coming back a little. That‚Äôs a good sign!



Kate then tries a rueful smile but suddenly begins to burst into tears.



(Jim): What's going on, Kate? Are you in pain?

(Kate): Yes, but not the way you want it.

That's to say ?

Dad, I'm psychologically at rock bottom and I don't know how I'm going to get out of this situation that's tearing my brain and heart apart. I have once again entered a destructive spiral to achieve a vital objective for me but which has caused so much damage in me and around me that I don't know if I will ever be able to remedy it. I miss mom so much...

I understand. I miss her too, you know. I know that there are subjects that a girl can only discuss with her mother, but you supported me so much when I was sinking into alcohol that I want to give you my support today, and advise you as best I can. First of all, your health is essential and do not do anything that could jeopardize your complete recovery. This is what should concern you first and foremost. Then, we have to start from the essential: You! Before even thinking about others, what do you want, deep down? What are your life priorities? And finally, who to support you, who to help you, who to support you? If you can answer these questions, then the path forward will become clear and what is currently clouding your vision will eventually fade away. Things won't necessarily happen by themselves, but a good psychoanalyst will be able to help you. I think you've already had to do therapy, you know what it is and Doctor BEURK is still practicing. You will probably have to make another appointment with him.

No doubt... Dad, I don't think I'll ever be able to live without solving Mom's murder. This is why I joined the police and, as long as I am a police officer, this investigation will be a priority. But today I know that this investigation puts me in danger personally and I fear that it will also end up endangering those close to me. On the other hand, this investigation requires total commitment from me and leaves no room for a serious relationship with a man. Now I also want to build something solid on that side but it's as if something deep down told me: you can't do both at the same time. And then there is something else... Something else that could have been simple, that should have been simple but that never was.

I think I know what you're thinking.

Oh yes ?

It's Castle.

Yes.

Do you want to talk about it?

I don't know if I want to talk about it with you, it's so personal and intimate.

I understand and I won't force you. But promise me you'll go see this psychoanalyst. He can help you with that. So, I will not ask you to speak but, on the other hand, I will ask you to listen to me. Earlier, I told you: who will support you, who will help you, who will support you? Well know that I have never seen anyone near you who is so ready to support you, help you and support you. Certainly, his reputation as Don Juan precedes him but when he is with you, he is respectful, considerate, understanding. He is your faithful friend and I also know that he is the only one you listen to, even if it is sometimes reluctantly, because you know that behind his vague theories hide the laws of common sense. You have often described him to me as immature, egocentric and even like a moron at times, but you know as well as I that this is only the character's cover and that he is in fact sensible, generous and far from stupid. You just have to see him act with his mother and daughter to realize it. And you didn't devour his books all these years thinking they were bad literature. You found pleasure, comfort and sometimes even ideas to solve your investigations. Destiny brought you together and you were smart enough to let it take a place in your life. This is no coincidence. It might take you a little while to admit it, but I'm confident in what I'm saying. Think about it.

Yes but Josh?

Obviously you'll have to break up with him but it shouldn't be that difficult. This relationship only stands on one leg and your life plans cannot agree.

Dad, you're so hard sometimes.

I'm realistic. And probably a little too cash this time but I think so. No doubt, your mother would have found better words. Sorry.

It's nothing, Dad. Thank you for telling me all this.

As long as I'm alive, I'll be there for you. Always.



This word ‚Äúalways‚Äù resonated so loudly in his chest that tears came back to his cheeks.



(Jim) Oh I'm sorry, I made you cry again...

1kkpqyg,https://www.reddit.com/r/BestWirelessProducts/comments/1kkpqyg/could_ekvanbel_a6l_bluetooth_headset_be_your_best/,Could EKVANBEL A6L Bluetooth Headset Be Your Best Noise-Cancelling Choice? Review Inside!,"The **EKVANBEL A6L Bluetooth Headset** piqued my interest given its impressive features and specifications. Over the past month, I've put it to the test during work calls, long gaming sessions, and even while out running errands. It's been a solid performer, though there are certainly some quirks that buyers should keep in mind.

**Ergonomic and Modern Design**  
The first thing that stood out to me was its sleek, modern style and lightweight build (4.6 ounces). As someone who wears headsets continuously for hours, I appreciated the ergonomic in-ear design. The addition of six ear tips in three different sizes made it easy to find the perfect fit, ensuring comfort throughout the day. Wearing the earpiece even during extended video calls or long hours of gaming didn‚Äôt result in discomfort or fatigue. However, I did notice that users with larger ear canals might need some time adjusting to the snug fit provided by the smaller earbud sizes.  

**Performance and Noise Cancellation**  
Working from home often means dealing with background noise, but this headset‚Äôs environmental noise cancellation truly impressed me. EKVANBEL equipped the A6L with Qualcomm‚Äôs QCC3040 chip and dual AI microphones, which effectively reduced ambient sounds, even during particularly noisy situations. I tested it during a call while standing in a bustling coffee shop, and my colleague remarked that my voice came through crystal clear. The dedicated mute button was another thoughtful feature, allowing me to have private moments without fumbling with settings mid-call‚Äîa godsend during remote work meetings.

[Snag EKVANBEL A6L Bluetooth Headset deals on Amazon now.](https://wirelessemporium.com/check/b0chvwjp7n/)

**Battery Life and Charging Case**  
Battery life is where this product really shines. On a single charge, the earpiece offers up to 25 hours of playtime (at 50% volume), which was more than enough to get through full days of back-to-back calls. What sweetens the deal is the 1000mAh charging case, extending its total operating time to an insane 96 hours! The LED display on the case was a welcome addition, offering a clear indication of the remaining charge. However, I did find that it takes three hours for a full recharge of the case, which is slightly on the longer side compared to other fast-charging models.

**User-Friendly Operations**  
The EKVANBEL A6L features intuitive buttons, making it easy to use. For instance, double-tapping the silver button above the earpiece activates your voice assistant, while the side mute button is handy for quick privacy during calls. It‚Äôs a robust device for multitasking‚Äîyou can even connect it to two Bluetooth devices simultaneously. Switching between my phone and laptop was seamless, thanks to its latest Bluetooth 5.3 technology. As a neat bonus, the headset includes a USB dongle for desktops without Bluetooth capability. Simply plug it in, and the connection establishes itself‚Äîno manual pairing necessary. 

**Highlights**  
- Effective noise cancellation with dual AI mics.  
- Multi-device connectivity via Bluetooth 5.3.  
- Long battery life with a 1000mAh charging case.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- Recharging time for the case could be faster.  
- Limited compatibility with traditional landline phones.  
- Fit may require adjustment for users with larger ears.  

**Rival Brands and Competitors**  
I‚Äôve also tried headsets from brands like Plantronics and Jabra, and each has its own flair. For example, Jabra's models often come with a more robust build and advanced app integration, allowing users to customize their listening experience more extensively. Plantronics excels in delivering a wider Bluetooth range for users who prioritize mobility while on calls. However, the EKVANBEL A6L stands out for its affordability and noise-canceling capabilities. While Jabra‚Äôs headsets tend to have more polished finishes, they come at nearly twice the price, making the EKVANBEL A6L a better value proposition for budget-conscious users who still want premium features.

**Price Performance**  
Looking at what it offers‚Äîenvironmental noise cancellation, 96 hours of extended playtime, Bluetooth 5.3 connectivity, and ergonomic customization‚Äîthe EKVANBEL A6L provides great **bang for the buck**. While it has a couple of rough edges, like the lengthy charging cycle for the case, it punches well above its weight considering its cost. Whether you're a remote worker, a gamer, or just someone who needs excellent audio quality on calls, this could easily meet your expectations without burning a hole in your pocket.

1kkpque,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1kkpque/explore_if_the_ovalware_rj3_cold_brew_coffee/,Explore if the Ovalware RJ3 Cold Brew Coffee Maker lives up to the hype!,"Testing the Ovalware RJ3-06 Cold Brew Coffee Maker has been an interesting journey, as it has become a staple in my kitchen for various tasks. This product has been heavily hyped for its multipurpose functionality and ease of use, so I decided to see if it lived up to the expectations. As a coffee enthusiast, I was eager to get my hands on this coffee maker to spice up my daily brewing routine.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing that caught my attention was the sleek, modern design of this cold brew maker. Built with thick borosilicate glass and stainless steel accents, it feels sturdy without looking out of place on the countertop. It has a 1.5-liter capacity, which is noticeably larger than many other cold brew pitchers I‚Äôve tried. The airtight silicone lid and non-slip rubber base were thoughtful touches, ensuring both freshness and stability. However, I did find the glass a bit heavy when fully filled‚Äîdefinitely not a dealbreaker but worth mentioning if you prioritize lightweight products.

**Ease of Use**  
After unboxing the cold brew maker, I appreciated how simple it was to start brewing. The included stainless steel filter is superfine, meaning no gritty coffee sediments end up in your drink‚Äîa problem I‚Äôve experienced with cheaper alternatives. All I needed to do was add coarse coffee grounds, pour in filtered water, give it a good stir, and pop it into the fridge. No extra steps, no mess. I was pleasantly surprised by how effortlessly this fit inside my undersized fridge shelves. The handle, though functional for most people, felt slightly awkward when grabbing with wet hands, which is something I‚Äôd keep in mind.

Check [Ovalware RJ3-06 Cold Brew Coffee Maker](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b06y27w76b/) price on Amazon.

**Performance and Coffee Quality**  
The biggest question: does it make good coffee? The answer is a resounding yes! The cold brew it produces is smooth, less acidic than hot-brewed coffee, and packs a rich flavor profile. After letting it steep for 12‚Äì18 hours (I tested both times), I was thrilled with the consistency and depth of the concentrate. It‚Äôs also perfect for tea lovers, as it works equally well with loose-leaf tea, providing versatility during family gatherings where we have both coffee and tea drinkers. What's more, the coffee concentrate stayed fresh for over a week thanks to the airtight seal.

**Advantages**  
Any product has strengths, and this one has quite a few:  
- 70% less acidic cold brew compared to traditional methods.  
- Durable borosilicate glass with BPA-free materials for safety.  
- Dishwasher-safe components for hassle-free cleanup.  
- Excellent for both coffee and tea, adding value for households.  

**Negatives**  
Of course, it's not perfect, and I did encounter some minor flaws:  
- The glass body, although durable, feels heavy when full.  
- The handle grip could be improved for better ergonomics.  
- It might not suit someone short on fridge space in compact kitchens.

**Product Alternatives**  
For comparison, I also tried the Takeya Cold Brew Coffee Maker. While it‚Äôs more lightweight and compact, it lacks the premium feel of the RJ3-06 and didn‚Äôt keep coffee fresh as long. Likewise, the Hario Mizudashi offers great flavor but has a smaller capacity and feels less sturdy. If quality and durability are priorities, the Ovalware edges out its competition.

**Cost Efficiency**  
In terms of value for money, the Ovalware RJ3-06 is a strong contender. Considering its robust build, multipurpose functionality, and the long-lasting freshness of the coffee, I‚Äôd say this maker offers great bang for the buck. It‚Äôs an investment piece that could save you trips to your local caf√©, making it a cost-efficient option for serious coffee and tea aficionados.

We've known each other for four years, and since 16 he's been a weed addict, and the most intimate and longest relationship he had was with me, especially because he's known me longer than any other woman he has met. and I think he's not used to a real woman because he often dated girls younger than him.

Anyways, after seven months no contact, we met up again last week, he asked me to be his girlfriend and I said yes. He reached out earlier than that, but I was dating another guy then. At home he was gaming while talking with me the whole time. I just think he's afraid of real ‚Äúin the moment‚Äù- type of intimacy. He also told me I should tell him when it bothers me, and the next day I asked if we can watch a movie together he said ‚Äúit‚Äôs not the right time for watching one‚Äù, and continued gaming. 

Every evening, he is on a team call with his brother and his friends after work. I mean, I also do participate in that, but I also have goals and stuff that I have to work on so I can't be on the team call every day like them like literally every every day in the evening they are gaming together. And he is smoking around 7-8 joints per day. When he doesn't smoke joints, he smokes cigarettes at work. I don't know if that‚Äôs normal weed addiction behaviour, and I wonder how I can help him with that because I don't want to put all my energy into this. He also said that he needs someone by his side (me) for him to be able to stop smoking and it helps him not smoke so many joints. That's what he said.

He's a sweet, sensitive boy in his core, but outwards he wants to be the hood gangster lol. When we cuddle and I take his hand, I can feel that he's not used to this type of intimacy. I can just feel his energy getting shy, although in general he's a lot more affectionate than me.
I know he has ADHD and he even started gaming on his computer while we were watching anime for 20 minutes, after that we continued watching anime, where he always shows huge reactions/intense responses to the plot happening.

His money is also short because usually he spent 400‚Ç¨ on just buying weed for a month. and i don't know what to do or if i should just raise my boundaries and tell him what i expect? He even said he doesn‚Äôt want to spend money on useless coffee if we would go to a nice coffee shop. I just told him i want to do something, since he asked me to come over again. 

I feel like I have to talk to him as if he's a young boy and I'm his mother, trying to teach him how to communicate and also how to not be passive-aggressive or stressed when I just want to talk with him about things. And the version of him that I see is him being a boy, which is okay for me, but I don't know how can I help him, because he also hasn't had a strong physical connection to his mother. His father died when he was super young. 

I feel like he wants to be loved only, I can‚Äôt figure out what he really needs or wants. Should I talk to him?

1kkpowb,https://www.reddit.com/r/PreserveThatFood/comments/1kkpowb/mesliese_vs6685j_vacuum_sealer_review/,Mesliese VS6685J Vacuum Sealer Review,"# Chef's Review: The Mesliese Vacuum Sealer - Is It Worth Your Counter Space?

Hey r/Cooking friends! I recently got my hands on the [Mesliese Vacuum Sealer](https://vacuumsealercenter.com/mesliese-vs6685j-vacuum-sealer-review/) after my old faithful finally gave up the ghost. After putting it through its paces with everything from cheese to marinated chicken, I thought I'd share my honest thoughts.

## The Sleek Stats

|Feature|Specification|
|:--|:--|
|Model|VS6612|
|Suction Power|85kPa|
|Power|120W|
|Vacuum Speed|6-18 seconds|
|Operating Modes|Dry, Moist, Seal Only, Pulse, Extra-Vac/Marinate|
|Sealing Width|11.8 inches|
|Built-in Features|Bag Cutter, Bag Storage Roll Holder|
|Included Accessories|2 bag rolls (8""x6.6""), 5 pre-cut bags (11""x16""), Air suction hose|
|Warranty|5 years|

## The Good Stuff

* **Serious Suction Power**: This thing pulls a proper vacuum - actually does what it claims with that 85kPa
* **Smart Moisture Handling**: The moist mode genuinely works without making a mess (a rarity in my experience)
* **Built-in Conveniences**: The cutter and storage compartment are surprisingly useful and make the workflow smoother
* **Touch Controls**: Intuitive interface that lights up - fancy but functional
* **Multiple Modes**: From basic sealing to marinating, it's versatile enough for various kitchen tasks
* **Value Package**: Comes with enough bags and rolls to get started immediately

## The Not-So-Great

* **Placement Learning Curve**: Like most vacuum sealers, getting the bag edge positioned perfectly takes some practice
* **Noise Level**: Not earsplitting, but definitely not silent - about average for vacuum sealers
* **Long-term Durability**: Feels solid enough for home use, but not industrial-grade construction

## Real-World Testing

I've tested this on various foods and can confirm it handles both dry goods (coffee, cheese blocks) and moist foods (marinated meats) impressively well. The seal is consistently tight, and the different modes actually make a noticeable difference.

What surprised me most was how the ""Moist"" setting actually prevents liquid from being pulled up into the machine - a common failure point with other sealers I've used. The external vacuum port works great with canisters, and the ""Pulse"" feature gives you manual control when sealing delicate items.

The built-in cutter makes creating custom-sized bags from rolls super simple, and the storage area keeps everything neat and accessible.

## Who Should Buy This?

This sealer hits a sweet spot for several users:

* **Beginners**: User-friendly with included starter materials
* **Meal Preppers**: Efficient and versatile enough for weekly batch cooking
* **Sous Vide Enthusiasts**: Creates reliable seals for water bath cooking
* **Bulk Shoppers**: Perfect for dividing and preserving larger purchases

If you're doing industrial-level sealing, you might eventually want something beefier, but for enthusiastic home cooks (even those who seal frequently), this is more than capable.

## Verdict

For around $100, the Mesliese delivers impressive performance and useful features that make it a strong contender in the home vacuum sealer market. After several weeks of regular use, I'm genuinely impressed by how it balances functionality, convenience, and value.

If you're looking to reduce food waste, extend shelf life, or up your sous vide game without breaking the bank, this machine deserves serious consideration.

Here's something ironic, I've struggled my entire life with staying on track. Executive function? It's usually out grabbing coffee while I'm wondering what day it is. Yet, somehow, I've built a successful professional career managing projects, teams, and complex logistics. Funny, isn't it? I could lead a team across three states, but couldn't keep track of my own wallet.

Recently it hit me (two decades late, but who's counting?). Why not manage my life with the same compassion, intentionality, and clear processes I've successfully used in my career? Turns out, it works.

I won't pretend I've figured everything out. My journey isn't about perfection, it's about iteration. ""Progress over validation,"" as I always remind myself. It‚Äôs about showing up every day, even when it's messy (especially when it's messy). And I can sincerely say, at nearly 40, this is the most sustained, fulfilling, and tangible growth I've ever experienced.

I've even quit smoking after 24 years, a milestone I honestly wasn't sure I'd ever achieve (haven't had one in over 7 months). It's incredible how changing my approach, embracing structure without rigidity, practicing self-compassion, and prioritizing small, consistent steps, has made such a difference.

Yes, even my tracker has trackers. But jokes aside, this isn't about the tools. It's about finally acknowledging that my brain isn‚Äôt broken; it just thrives with intentional structure and compassionate accountability. It took me decades to accept that. I'm hoping this might help someone else reach that realization sooner.

If you've felt stuck, overwhelmed, or like you're constantly running two steps behind, I get it. I'd love to hear your experiences, your wins (big or small), or how you're learning to work with your brain, not against it.

Here's to embracing our beautifully complicated brains and building a life that feels authentic, intentional, and full of purpose.",4,1747047564.0,getdisciplined,1,0.7,False

#Picks Of The Week (by u/lefuniname)


####**1. Degs - If We Left This Earth [Hospital Records]**  
*Recommended if you like: Fats, DRS, (D)Eksman*  

Remember how, when talking about his collaborative project Hologram's latest release last week, I said Degs deserved a deep dive of his own soon? Well, what better opportunity am I gonna get than his most marvellous second album, **If We Left This Earth**? Let's get into it! 

**1.1. Degsground (1989 - 2007)**  

Born and raised in the at first glance unassuming, but on second look actually bustling DnB talent haven that is Horsham, Kenyan-British musician Andrew Ndegwa Davies, nowadays known as **Degs**, has been surrounded by music and a healthy community of drum and bass fanatics from quite early on. Massively influenced by both the Soul and Motown collection of his Kenyan mum, originally from the humble village of Ngriambu, and the deep love for Led Zeppelin and Rock in general shared by his British dad, the young lad already had quite the musical cocktail a-brewing, but thanks to said mum, he also took up piano lessons at a mere 5 years of age. Eventually, he ditched the lessons and devoted his time to the guitar, drums and even bass guitar instead, but it was 90s Hip-Hop that _truly_ made him fall in love. Spurred on by his - to this day - biggest fan, his mum, he not only _inhaled_ everything from the likes of Nate Dog, G-Funk, Slum Village and A Tribe Called Quest, he also wrote and, in a way, _exhaled_ his very own bars into the mic himself. 

What about the drums and the basses, though? It might have taken a little longer than usual, considering where he grew up, but when he was first shown Bad Company UK's _Inside The Machine_, he instantly fell in love with the rebellious spirit of it all. Well, he also says he was a little confused about the rhythms and all that at first, but he _did_ like it right away. One of the earliest memories of him combining these two passions goes back to 2007, during his studies at the Birmingham City University, when his flat mate and him were regularly freestyling over not just Hip-Hop, but also DnB beats. 

**1.2. Master of Dangerously Eloquent, Genius Sprayouts (2007-2017)**  

As **D.E.G.S**, and later on **MC Degs**, both derived from his Kikuyu Kenyan name _Ndegwa_, Andrew kept on grinding out bars left right and centre, until his graft eventually lead to him becoming resident MC at the Brighton-based _Frequency_ sessions in 2011. This was not just a breakthrough on its own, it also opened various doors with other promoters in the scene, and before long, he was regularly traveling over to Belgium to host _Invaderz_ and _Skank & Bass_ events. While the life as ""jump up's best kept secret"" was fun, it was also highly competitive and laser-focused on hyping up the crowd, leaving his ever-growing desire for more songwriting-based lyricism unsatisfied. 

On the side, he had tried out various other avenues to quench this thirst, including but not limited to his, from what I can tell, massively Fats-inspired debut EP _Real Life_ on _Venemous_ in 2012 (!), Kenyan Kung Fu lessons, and a slow jam cover of Big Shaq's saucy anthem _Man's Not Hot_. Fun fact, the proficient mathematician was actually shown Degs' rework, but ended up being distracted by the man's uneven afro. While none of these stuck, there was one that did: In 2016, his mate Daniel Gergel, who produced Jump Up as _Danger_, and recently decided to pursue some more mellow beats with his liquid project _Vision_, sent Andrew his first full-on liquid mix, and, having had a similar stylistic trajectory, he jumped at the opportunity to spray out some bars on top of it. Daniel loved it, so they released it as _Eurosoul Sessions Vol. 1_, garnering quite the attention all across the scene. 

While slaving away at his unfulfilling day job in sales, he kept trying to get this soulful-filthy singing-rapping hybrid, inspired by legends on both sides of the energy spectrum like _Eksman_ and _Fats_, off the ground, participating in _Random Concept_'s MCing competition, producing and writing straight-up Hip-Hop with his brother _MURIUKI_ as **Kikuyu Soul**, and, perhaps most importantly, started uploading freestyles over various liquid tunes he liked, from _Game Of Clones_ on _FD_'s _Butterflies_ to his life-changing _Fine Arts_ spray-out on _Lenzman_ and _Redeyes_' _We Were Kings_. 

Why life-changing? Well... 

**1.3. A Whole Different Clinicalibre Of Success (2018 - 2025)**  

One of the people who saw this spray-out in particular was none other than Chris Blu Mar Ten, head of _Clinical Talent_, _Hospital Records_' booking agency! The next few days saw Degs' inbox get swarmed by him, Chris Goss and Tony ""London Elektricity"" Coleman - they all wanted to meet up with him at the upcoming Hospitality In The Woods. Next thing he knows, he's standing on stage for one of the legendary label's events, taking over mic duties from _GQ_, who tells him how much of a breath of fresh air his hybrid style is. After showing off his talents, and pushing through the bouts of understandable nervousness at both Hospitality Bristol and their New Year's show at Printworks, they finally offer him a full-on contract to become one of Hospital's core artists, as the second-ever MC, after _Inja_. In just a year, he went from losing his job and not knowing where to go, to experiencing a whole boatload of people singing along to his label debut single **Poveglia**, with Hor-shaman _De:Tune_, at Hospitality At The Beach. 

Next, he reworked all of the spray-out videos from 2017 into fully official remix versions, with all-Hospital originals, for his biggest project as of yet: the 2018 _Mixtape Sprayout_ EP! Aside from a couple of single one-offs and features on other artist's projects, it was now time to work on the Hospital Staple‚Ñ¢: an actual album! Never content with just one creative avenue though, Degs sought, and was thoroughly encouraged by the label, to deepen his production skills, which, combined with his usual vocal prowess and lyrical themes ranging from his Kenyan heritage to all sorts of relationship troubles and even mental health, resulted in the wonderful **Letters From Ndegwa** LP. Launched virtually at the height of lockdown in 2020, and celebrated with remixes by the likes of _AC13_, _Bladerunner_ and even his fraternal side project _Kikuyu Soul_, it was perhaps not the release he envisioned, but it was a smashing success nonetheless. 

Of course, this time also brought us his **Hologram** side project with _De:Tune_ and _Citrusfly_, but this week we're only talking Degs, so the next big thing on the horizon was the advent of Volume 2 of his **Mixtape Sprayout** in 2021. This time a collection of fully original tunes, the mix tape saw him touch on even more personal topics like his experiences moving away from family and the trauma that came with the passing of a close friend of his. However, outside of all these wonderful, big projects, and even outside his Hospital Records affiliation, which has grown further and further as he's (temporarily) become the faces of the official _Hospital Podcast_ and even acted as a host for the label's radio on _Forza Horizon 5_ alongside Chris Goss, he's been blessing us with releases on _(inhales)_ Shogun, Overview, UKF, Invicta, Monstercat, RAM, Terra Firma, and Soulvent, collaborating with GLXY, Bop & Subwave, Grafix, Operate, Makoto, BCee, Hugh Hardie, Heist, Lee Mvtthews, Bensley, Whiney, Askel & Elere, and even Duskee and Harry Shotta. Man's everywhere! 

Now, Andrew has once again channelled some of his best songwriting into the long-awaited sophomore album, **If We Left This Earth** - so let's talk about it! 

**1.4. If We Left This Earth**  

One thing he has promised for his second album during the interview cycle for Letters From Ndegwa, is _""more wubs""_, and boy did he keep that promise, especially with the opening few tunes. For instance, opener **Smokescreen Sprayout**, with Hospital young'un **Hoax** providing a perfectly calibrated, darkly wobbling and aggressively rolling playground for Degs to dish out some  tightly-flowed, out-right hostile bars against the ones who dare disrespect him. In a way continuing to channel his early days of hype battle rap, **Antics**, with the one and only **Hugh Hardie** taking us down the wildly danceable streets of Breakbeat rhythmics, is Andrew's ode to the kind of night outs that leave you a sweaty mess. We stay on the attack, as Degs not only brings out the **Hologram** bois, but also enlists the legendary **Ragga Twins**, on the even more directly antagonistic **Hang Up The Mic**. This friendly suggestion to the envious wack MCs of our scene comes with _incredibly_ heavy, dubby, whompy basslines, snappy drums and all sorts of fun Raggae-influenced samples. 

Mirroring his own musical journey, the album then takes us in a deeper, calmer, more introspective direction, starting with the moody Spanish guitar flanging **Conversation** with fellow Hospital vocalist **Doktor** exploring how the deep connection he shares with his partner calmed him down in the face of the mad world we're living in. Similarly focused on kinship, **Rafiki** (Swahili for _""friend""_) with **Kimyan Law** sees them celebrate the positive impact friend- and relationships can have while simultaneously honouring their shared African heritage with this catchy, Swahili-English lyrical fusion, on top of wonderfully weird, fluttery whompy production. On **If We Left This Earth** with (semi-uncredited?) **Shapes**, the brass-infused instrumental built on rolling drums and ominously rumbling basses gives space (get it) for Degs to work through his daydream of leaving the grind behind and exploring this vast universe of ours. Speaking of space, the lovely **Spacesuit** with the up-and-coming producer **Gabrielle Bongo** on the dreamy guitar riffs and lightly syncopated rhythmics, takes his date another few million miles further away from the stress of it all, where no bad vibes can catch us. Lovely!

On the opposite end of the sadness spectrum, we got the all too real aftermath of a relationship breaking apart, on **Last Orders**. With **NCT** supplying the melancholic, piano-driven foundation, Degs and **Maisy Grace** paint a vivid picture of a deeply broken man drowning his sorrows in one too many Gin & Tonics, after his partner could not bear it anymore. Absolutely heartbreaking and perhaps one of my favourite Degs tunes ever - I just love duets like this, man! To wipe away the tears with rave-induced sweat, Degs amps up the **Pressure** with the **Hologram** g√§ng and bad boi **4K**, who provide a deeply face-scrunching, dubby-whompy, classic rave sound laden framework for Andy's realisation of purpose, with 4K's personal rinse-out moment alone probably violating a couple Geneva conventions. Now that he's warmed up, Degs takes shots at all the things wrong in modern society - the 1%, culture wars, fear mongering, you name it - on **Hive Mind**, which sees returning champions **NCT** and new addition **Dux n Bass** giving Andy's expos√© the appropriately dubby, jumpy, filthy instrumentalisation. Especially that whole sequence when both the tune and Andy switch gears into this rapid-fire assault is simply perfect!

We keep the emotional honesty going, with the lo-fi confessional type vibe that is the semi-official **Kikuyu Soul** collab **West & Central** with his younger bother **MURIUKI**. While the previous stops already saw him share some rather personal stuff, this brotherly joint sees Andy opening up like never before - about his struggles coming up in the scene, about addiction, about creative blockades. We wallow in this deeply melancholic vibe for a bit longer, with the sneaky, i.e. uncredited, _Pola & Bryson_ collab **Still Messed Up**. Soft yet relentlessly break-heavy drums representing the overwhelming anxiety of life, while brooding, moody synths and basslines fill up the lower frequencies, perfectly mirror the paralysing state of affairs Andrew describes with his poignant lyricism - another favourite of mine. For Degs, the way out of this overwhelming information overload comes in the connections he makes, as explored on **Healing**. With _Nu:Tone_ and _Son_ uncreditedly whipping up some rather lovely piano chords and guitar riffs in this little liquid roller, Andrew lays out just how much he appreciates his partner, how much they helped him grow and how they helped heal all of his soul's scars. 

Penultimate stop **Don't Be Gone Too Long**, on the other hand, explores the beautiful mess his partner's relationship with the constantly touring artist that he is. Sometimes even weeks at a time, they have to spend away from another, but they make it work, picking up the scattered pieces each and every time, and growing stronger by the minute. To capture this lovely yet melancholic sentiment, Degs recruited man like **Hoax** one more time, who delivers the soft, piano-driven atmosphere on top of only the smoothest rolling drums, and **Amira Salah El-Shafie**, to speak for the other side of the equation, and deliver duet harmonies that are simply out of this world. One last time, Degs brings back **Hoax** on album closer **Ngoma** - a Bantu term describing a night of music, dance, and drama. On top of an even more stripped-back piano-led roller, Andy wades through feelings of regret, haunted by the mistakes of his youth and unable to escape the never-ending loop of sorrow. It all becomes so much he even relapses into old patterns, backsliding into drowning his grief in alcohol, as the instrumental becomes more aggressive for one last time, before fading out on us.

**1.4. Conclusion**

While starting off in a more aggressive battle-rap fashion to expertly deliver the long-promised wubs and straight-up fire bars, Degs is also able to once again channel the incredibly personal, emotionally honest and simply heart-breaking storytelling we have come to love from him. A Degsxcellent album all-around.

I've been with my bf for a year now, and he usually invites me to hangout with his friends whether for coffee, lunch or to drink. lately, i've noticed how one of his friends (24F) that i also considered to be a friend is acting pretty distant, I'll call her Mattie . I tried to reconnect but she's still not meeting me halfway and is ignoring me most of the time. when i walk to her as she hangout on campus, she just ignores me while i chat with the other people around. eventually, I took the hint and i stopped showing up to the hangout place on campus and would just come to say hi and see my bf and then walk away. i understand that she doesn't have to like me, even tho i don't really understand why she suddenly stopped liking me as im sure i didn't do anything, but i get it. she treats me a little better when my bf is around but if not, then i don't exist. I told him about it, and he told me that im probably imagining and that his friends like me. I tried to believe him and blamed it on my low self esteem and that i find it hard to believe people actually like me. but recently, he told me he's going out. I don't usually ask a lot so i told him to have fun, but another friend asked him with who and what are they doing. he said he's going out with Mattie and her boyfriend for drinks. he seemed pretty hesitant to say that in front of me. I felt pretty hurt that none of them invited me this time, and i thought this must have happened multiple times because it has been so long since our last hangout so maybe they are in fact hanging out? but just without me. later that week i brought it up infront of my bf and Mattie, in a light matter, when they brought up the hangout. I told them that i felt a little left out, and that i miss hanging out with them. it felt pretty desperate and tbh im not used to being like that but i really love our hangouts and i didn't want the relationship to die out, that was my last attempt at reaching out. Mattie looked at my bf and went ""oh, why didn't we invite her? what did you say.. that we shouldn't enable (my name) to drink ?"" my bf was silent, and that sentence broke me. I only started drinking very recently, my first time was with them. and i had a  hard time at the beginning when it comes to knowing how much is enough to drink, my bf was the one more experienced so he would usually tell me when but i didn't always listen when i felt i could take more. but ive learned now and i don't even have more than one drink even tho it barely gets me tipsy, and he himself saw that i got better on a couple occasions. so the fact that not inviting me was his idea and that he didn't trust me with alcohol broke me. he brought it up later and said that when he goes out to hangout with his friends he'd rather chill and relax, and when i'm around, he tends to focus on me and if im having a good time which doesnt let him ""let go"" . and I understood that, it made me feel terrible but i understood it. but right now i don't feel safe drinking with him knowing im being judged and feeling like an unwanted responsibility. I'm avoiding the hangout place and all his friends (that i thought were mine as well, pathetically enough) and it's making me feel extra lonely. i'd like to hear some opinions, and some suggestions on what to do.",1,1747047393.0,relationship_advice,3,1.0,False

The second morning I‚Äôm with my boyfriend and the girl at the pool and we were topless. Because that was just the vibe. 

His friend joined us a bit later and immediately asked his girlfriend to put a shirt on. I usually have a bit of banter with this guy, so I said something about how he should run for local council with his leadership skills. It just slipped out of my mouth. 

Nothing I‚Äôve ever said has gone down that badly, just seconds of silence, looked right past me to my boyfriend. 

Who then suddenly has a problem with me being topless. Not once has he ever cared about modesty, especially his own. And he framed it with ‚Äúyou heard him‚Äù. 

At this point I‚Äôm just smiling and looking at both of them because it‚Äôs just so fucking bizarre. But I put my top on to keep the peace. 

The whole interaction lasted less than 30 seconds. Then they left to get coffees. 

I droppede it for the trip but I‚Äôve been thinking about it since. Was I sorted into a pecking order? Have I never noticed because I always go with the flow?

\-

*The Crown Road,*  
*100 miles from the Triangle,*  
*Central province.*  
*-*

The road ahead stank of blood and burnt canvas. Splintered wood, overturned carriages, and bodies‚Äîhuman, *Drakken*, *Snatcher*‚Äîlittered the path.

Soldiers moved through the wreckage, collecting scraps, muttering over blood trails, pointing out claw marks in the dirt.

Arthur reined his drake steed to a crawl alongside Tenha, eyes fixed on the wreckage. Without a word, his second-in-command dismounted, tied off his horse, and crouched beside a *Drakken‚Äôs* corpse.

The skull was split wide. The muzzle hung open. He ran a thumb along the curve of a bone horn jutting from its cheek.

Arthur dismounted as well. The moment his boots hit the ground, the drake shimmered and vanished.

‚ÄúWhat do you think?‚Äù Tenha asked, still focused on the body.

Arthur didn‚Äôt answer. He walked past, boots avoiding the drying blood of a nearby *snatcher's* corpse, and stepped into the wreck of the main carriage.

One door hung by a hinge. Inside, barrels, crates, food, and clothes were sealed and untouched.

‚ÄúYou want the easy answer?‚Äù Arthur‚Äôs voice came from inside. ‚Äú*Drakken and Snatchers* hit a merchant train, got interrupted, lost too many, and fled.‚Äù

He stepped back out, wiping his gloves. Tenha examined another body.

‚ÄúBut these people...‚Äù Tenha gestured to the nearest human body. ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt look like they owned this.‚Äù¬†

Arthur came over. The corpse wore a fine coat‚Äîvelvet. Gold embroidery traced the cuffs. But the skin beneath the collar was sunburnt. The face was unshaven, nails chipped and blackened.

One of the soldiers knelt and stripped back the coat. Underneath: a linen shirt, torn at the armpit, patched twice at the belly.

The trousers were worse‚Äîthreadbare, stiff with dirt, crusted at the hem. A rusted blade lay in the grass nearby.¬†

‚ÄúRaiders?‚Äù the soldier muttered.

Arthur crouched, eyes on the man‚Äôs boots. One sole had come off, stitched back with copper wire. He grabbed a stick and tapped the man‚Äôs cheek with it.

‚ÄúLook at that,‚Äù he muttered. ‚ÄúYou robbed someone‚Äôs clothes just to die in them.‚Äù¬†

He stood. *But the bodies don't add up. Drakkens. Snatchers. Were they working together against raiders? Why bother? They didn‚Äôt even touch the supplies.*

>*‚ÄúHey there, wanna get to know each other?‚Äù*

Arthur flinched, hearing a voice‚Äîyoung, female, and playful.

He turned, but there was nothing but wreckage. Soldiers still worked, heads down.¬†

He stepped further and scanned the trees, listening to anything or anyone that might be there.

But again, there was nothing.

‚ÄúCaptain Arthur.‚Äù A voice from the other carriage. He moved over. Tenha was speaking with an *Ursaborn* soldier.

‚ÄúLook at this sigil,‚Äù Tenha said, tapping a panel. ‚ÄúThis carriage belongs to one of the trade guilds, doesn‚Äôt it? Think any of them are still alive?‚Äù

*Not likely, but worth a try.*¬†

He gave the soldier a nod. ‚ÄúGood work. Pass it on‚Äîeveryone, gather up.‚Äù

He broke the platoon into search parties‚Äîeight smaller units, each with a mix of humans and lupins.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt stray too far,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIf there‚Äôs danger, pull back and alert the rest. This isn‚Äôt even our mission.‚Äù

Several *Ursaborn* soldiers had already begun hauling carriages with their broad shoulders and arms, twice the size of any man and a special horse breed to match their size.¬†

Tenha came up beside him, brushing dust from his hair. ‚ÄúNow,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúwhere do we camp?‚Äù

Arthur didn‚Äôt answer right away. He was still watching the tree line.

A shiver passed through the brush. He clicked his tongue once and turned back to the men. ‚ÄúWe go off the road, to the north.‚Äù

\-

*The hill,*  
*North of Crown Road.*

Arthur sat by the fire, a skewer of meat in one hand and a tin of hot water in the other. The flame burned low and orange, fed not by wood but a single nightflame rune etched into a stone at the center.

He waited. The last search party hadn‚Äôt returned yet.

‚ÄúRelax a little, would you?‚Äù Tenha said, walking up from the carriage. ‚ÄúStill one more group out there. Maybe they found the missing people.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnything you found?‚Äù Arthur asked, not looking up.

‚ÄúNo. Thought we might get lucky with a stash of coffee or something, but‚Äî‚Äù Tenha made a noise of disappointment and plopped down beside him, patting the log. ‚ÄúMove over.‚Äù

Arthur sighed but moved anyway.

‚ÄúShit, my back‚Äôs killing me. Twenty-four hours riding, then this mess? I‚Äôd sell a toe for a massage right now.‚Äù Tenha leaned forward, unlatching part of his breastplate. It hissed softly from trapped sweat and heat.

Arthur took a bite from the skewer. ‚ÄúTake it easy. We hit *the Triangle* tomorrow.‚Äù¬†

A shout rose from the slope. The last party was back.

Arthur stood. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll get a proper treatment once we hit the first village. Maybe even coffee, if we're lucky.‚Äù

But the hope didn‚Äôt last long. The returning party shook their heads. No survivors. No guards. No trace of the merchants. Just more questions.

‚ÄúAlright, move along, soldier. Take your rest and get to your post with the others,‚Äù Tenha ordered, giving a tired wave.

Then came the scream.

A crash, loud and sharp, echoed from the center of camp. Shouts followed‚Äîconfused, panicked. Soldiers scrambled toward the noise.

An *Ursaborn* soldier was thrashing, eyes bloodshot, mouth foaming. He‚Äôd gone feral.

He grabbed one soldier by the throat and hurled him like a rag. Another tried to restrain him‚Äîonly to be flung into the side of a cart.

Two more Ursaborn rushed in, locking arms around their kin, trying to pin his massive limbs.

But it wasn‚Äôt enough.

Arthur was already moving. He dropped his tin cup, tore off his sidearms, and ran.

The *Ursaborn* let out a roar just as Arthur closed in. He leapt and drove a fist straight into his jaw. The impact jolted his whole arm‚Äîbut it staggered the gigantic soldier.

The camp froze. Eyes widened. A human, hurting an *Ursaborn*? That wasn‚Äôt supposed to happen.

He snapped toward Arthur, wild and seeing nothing but red. He ripped free from the two holding him, throwing one into the bonfire. The other crashed into a crate with a splintering crack.¬†

He charged.

Arthur braced‚Äîthen, from the side, a blur of black fur slammed into the *Ursaborn‚Äôs* ribs. A *Lupin* crawled low to the ground and sank its claw deep into the Ursaborn‚Äôs side.

The two wrestled, power against power.

The *Lupin* soldier tried to force the larger fighter to the dirt, teeth bared. But the *Ursaborn* was stronger‚Äîhe stayed upright, feet digging in, trying to twist free.¬†

Arthur didn‚Äôt wait.¬†

He moved behind them, fast and low, ducking under a swinging arm. He jumped, wrapped both arms around the Ursaborn‚Äôs thick neck, and locked in a choke.¬†

*The Ursaborn* thrashed. Arthur clenched tighter, legs wrapped around the torso, all his weight pulling down.¬†

The Lupin held on from the front. Together they brought him down‚Äîfirst to a knee, then face-first into the dirt.

Arthur held the choke until *the Ursaborn* stopped moving.

Heavy breaths.

Silence.

Then, slowly, soldiers gathered again.¬†

The *Lupin* coughed. ‚Äú...What the hell just happened?‚Äù

‚ÄúI was hoping one of you could tell me.‚Äù Arthur stood, spitting blood, ‚ÄúYou, boy, what‚Äôs your name?‚Äù

‚ÄúVorkin, captain.‚Äù

He wasn‚Äôt as tall as other lupins, only slightly taller than Arthur himself.¬†

Arthur extended a hand, ‚ÄúWell done, Vorkin.‚Äù

‚ÄúThanks.‚Äù he accepted it and got up.

\---

The Ursaborn soldier was tied. Wrists shackled behind his back, pulled down, and chained to his ankles. His legs were bent, knees forced out to the sides, heels drawn tight against his back.

Another chain ran from his neck to his knees, locking his torso forward‚Äîface nearly to the dirt.

He stirred and groaned as he woke up.

His eyes darted, pupils wide. ‚ÄúWhat... What are you doing? Guys? Why am I tied like this? This isn‚Äôt funny‚Äîrelease me.‚Äù¬†

*He doesn‚Äôt remember anything, typical.*

‚ÄúCalm down, soldier,‚Äù Arthur said.

He stepped forward, drawing his greatsword with one arm‚Äîa six-foot slab of metal, blackened steel with a faint blue pulse down the fuller. ‚ÄúJust tell me what you remember. Start from the top.‚Äù

*The Ursaborn* strained against the chain, wincing. ‚ÄúYes, Captain. I... I was talking. I think. I don‚Äôt know. I heard something... a voice?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúEase up the chain,‚Äù Arthur said over his shoulder. ‚ÄúHe's hurting.‚Äù He lowered the blade and sat in front of the soldier, legs folded. ‚ÄúSorry, soldier. Can‚Äôt let you go fully. Not yet.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, sir. Thank you. I‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs wrong with me.‚Äù He straightened as much as the bindings allowed. ‚ÄúWhat did I do, sir?‚Äù

Arthur met his eyes.

‚ÄúYou tried to crush one of your squadmate‚Äôs throats. Would‚Äôve snapped it too, if your kin didn‚Äôt hold you down in time.‚Äù

The Ursaborn‚Äôs face fell. ‚ÄúTh-thank you, everyone. I‚Äôm... I‚Äôm sorry. Deeply sorry.‚Äù

‚ÄúReport everything you remember. Leave nothing out.‚Äù Arthur motioned for the stationed soldiers to take over.

He turned back to Tenha.

‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt tell him it was you who stopped him?‚Äù Tenha asked.

*I need them to bond over something.*

‚ÄúWhat difference would it make?‚Äù¬†

Tenha shrugged, rocking his head side to side. ‚ÄúEh. Fair enough.‚Äù

>

That laugh again. Like a child's giggle wrapped in barbed wire.

1kkphyv,https://www.reddit.com/r/exchristian/comments/1kkphyv/getting_sober/,Getting sober,"So forwarning this is a vent post so I apologize for the lengthy message. But anyways, here I go. So I am facing a DUI trial soon and my lawyer is working on a solid defense for me. Part of that defense though is having me attend AA twice a week. I've been in the rooms for a few years now in different 12 step programs. But now, I must do AA.

I have a home group and I love them all. They're mostly young people. Not your typical White grandpa dudes smoking cigarettes and drinking coffee. This is a group of folks like 18-40 max. They make the meetings fun and they shout all kinds of funny things throughout the meeting. They care and love on me so much and as a Trans girl, they always validate me and affirm me. 

I'm convinced enough to admit that I'm an alcoholic. It's quite clear how badly I struggle when instead of arresting me, I'm just sent straight to a hospital because I can't even sit up on my own. My rock bottom had me at a BAC of .19. Now I've seen so much growth and progress in my home group of AA that I certainly do want what they have. There's only one problem... It's God. 

Despite this group being young people and very liberal and progressive, they still won't drop the ""God"" word and remove the ""He/Him"" pronoun for the supposed ""higher power"". I have a sponsor who dislikes religion and doesn't believe or respect the G word either but she still asks me to pray on my knees daily like a lot of other sponsors do. 

I don't understand. If you dislike God and religion, why do you ask me to pray on my knees daily? I tried to talk to her about my discomfort with the G word and explained to her why. She was understanding but ultimately told me to do a ""resentment inventory"" on it. Wow. Thanks I guess?

I hate how AA says their a ""secular program of recovery"" and yet they mention the he/him ""God"" over and over again. Look, I understand the program was created in the 1930s by two white men. Tolerances of women, LGBTQIA+, other religions and scientific viewpoints were non existent at that time. But after 4 editions, you'd think they'd finally change it.

I asked my sponsor why I couldn't just do the steps without any ""spiritual solution"" whatsoever and she said that I can't handle this on my own. I can't restore myself to sanity. It kinda reminds me of the dumb Bible where it says ""this battle is not yours"" like what? How is a man in the stars somewhere who in my opinion only cares about a select few people if He exists at all, gonna take the alcoholism for me? The only one who can absolutely stop me from drinking is me. Plain and simple.

If I choose to drink, it's on me. It's not that I wasn't ""close enough to God"" or I wasn't ""keeping in conscious contact"" I simply wasn't doing my part. I wasn't calling other recovering alcoholics, I wasn't being rigorously honest, I wasn't taking full responsibility for stuff and so on and so on. 

I do really love a lot about AA though. I love the wisdom, the hope it offers and the solution. I love the parts that involve me and my sponsor only. Basically the human work side of it. I just don't want to have to do anything spiritual. God alone isn't gonna get me sober but no one, not even in the most liberal of meetings and fellowships agrees with me 100%. I want to keep working the program and I love the friends I've made. But I'm just not ready to hear about ""God"" and what ""He"" can do for me right now. Frankly, I'm not sure if I ever will be. And to me, that's ok. 

The ""Big Book"" as they call it, (although it's really not that big. I've seen wayyy bigger) has a chapter to the agnostic. But all it's about is basically calling me a dumb fuck for lack of a better word and a stuck up human being for saying ""there is no God"". ""Who are you to say there is no God?"" - ""The Big Book"" like excuse me? That's rude.

If I'm to start believing in God again I think I'd like to convert to either Islam or Judaism  because they are so much more open and tolerant than Christians who believe in ""Jesus"" and ""God"". No thanks. I'd like to call God (if there really is such a person) by it's true name i.e Hashem or Allah. I've honestly found it disrespectful that Americans call the Tsar of the heavens ""God"" it's like me calling my friend best human. Like come on man, she's got a name. She's not ""Human"" lol. 

If you read this far, thank you so much. Anyone else have experience with trying to get sober through AA but not being able to get past the God thing? Any advice for how I can move forward with some boundaries perhaps on my sponsor with the spiritual shit? Or more like bullshit if you ask me lol üòÜ",2,1747047092.0,exchristian,0,1.0,False

1kkphc9,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1kkphc9/i_still_miss_him_after_4_years_now_started/,"I still miss him after 4 years, now started dreaming of him again","We broke up in 2021 after 9 months together, and honestly it was never a matter of incompatibility. I was undiagnosed (bpd) and for the first time I was actively trying to 'behave' to not lose him, which made me go even more crazy. He struggled with being vulnerable and communicating. After yet another fight he blocked me because of a stupid sarcastic comment I made, to later unblock me. We both came to the conclusion that we really loved each other, but it was making our lives worse. 

He texted me saying he was in my town for the weekend in 2023, we met for coffee and I thought finally I'd get closure, but truth is I never stopped missing him. We never talked again after that day. I dated a lot in this years (mostly because I started going out more and initially went back on dating apps), even got with someone for 6 months. I still never *truly* felt anything for this new person. It's like I'm damned to not be able to feel the yearning for someone who isn't him. Religiously I've been browsing reddit threads and articles about it, about ""shadow work"" which should help making you realise that you miss the idea/role, not the person. But no I miss him. I want him, and accepting that he's probably a different person now doesn't help. Because I changed too, but I'm still that same girl. When I can't refrain and I search him up I only think about how handsome he is, how far he's gone and how happy he looks. How he's literally the only boyfriend I ever *truly* hugged, not because I felt forced to or I was kinda pulled in the hug, but because I really wanted it despite my trauma with physical touch.

Now I'm on a 3 weeks streak of dreaming of us living together and spending the day feeling empty.

And I can't help but feel delusional for thinking he might miss me too, feeling so silly and stupid for even considering texting him even if just in a friendly ""hey, how's life going"" way. At some point I thought he was in a relationship because of some photos he was tagged in, and wheter that's true or not, I didn't feel jealousy, I felt happy for him but there was still this voice in the back of my head telling me that he's trying to move on and failing like me

I don't know what to do anymore, I'm feeling miserable ",3,1747047031.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

Coffee made me a bad parent.

I drank coffee daily throughout my pregnancy, and after my baby was born, I started drinking even more. I would go through cycles of anxiety, thinking that coffee would be the thing to calm me down. But the spikes would always come back. After a long time of observing my behavior - and with my baby now a toddler - I came to a few eye-opening conclusions:

1. Coffee affected my behavior around my child. While drinking it, I felt calm and happy, but when the effects wore off, I became grumpy and easily irritated. This definitely impacted my child's expectations. If I hadn‚Äôt stopped, I think my child would have grown up seeing coffee as a vital part of a parent‚Äôs love. Isn‚Äôt that a bit scary?

2. Unregulated coffee consumption made me disoriented. There was one occasion when my child fell while running. I could have prevented it, but my reaction was slow after the coffee effect wore off - I just wasn‚Äôt fully present. Other times I was forcing myself out of the fog just to secure the safety of a child.

3. I became emotionally numb at times. Sometimes, my child would do something incredibly funny or sweet, and I‚Äôd just feel... nothing. It‚Äôs the kind of numbness I used to crave before becoming a parent to cope with stress. But now, it‚Äôs interfering with how I want to respond to my child‚Äôs joy.

My experience is 100% my own and I think with the proper routine and limited coffein consumption most of the parents won't have similar stories. But for me it just doesn't work anymore. I'd rather look for healthy alternatives and press on to overcome the withdrawal symptoms.

Here's something ironic, I've struggled my entire life with staying on track. Executive function? It's usually out grabbing coffee while I'm wondering what day it is. Yet, somehow, I've built a successful professional career managing projects, teams, and complex logistics. Funny, isn't it? I could lead a team across three states, but couldn't keep track of my own wallet.

Recently it hit me (two decades late, but who's counting?). Why not manage my life with the same compassion, intentionality, and clear processes I've successfully used in my career? Turns out, it works.

I won't pretend I've figured everything out. My journey isn't about perfection, it's about iteration. ""Progress over validation,"" as I always remind myself. It‚Äôs about showing up every day, even when it's messy (especially when it's messy). And I can sincerely say, at nearly 40, this is the most sustained, fulfilling, and tangible growth I've ever experienced.

I've even quit smoking after 24 years, a milestone I honestly wasn't sure I'd ever achieve (haven't had one in over 7 months). It's incredible how changing my approach, embracing structure without rigidity, practicing self-compassion, and prioritizing small, consistent steps, has made such a difference.

Yes, even my tracker has trackers. But jokes aside, this isn't about the tools. It's about finally acknowledging that my brain isn‚Äôt broken; it just thrives with intentional structure and compassionate accountability. It took me decades to accept that. I'm hoping this might help someone else reach that realization sooner.

If you've felt stuck, overwhelmed, or like you're constantly running two steps behind, I get it. I'd love to hear your experiences, your wins (big or small), or how you're learning to work with your brain, not against it.

If you always write grocery lists with bullet points and capital letters, tell ChatGPT ‚ÄúUse bullet points and capitals.‚Äù It beats ‚Äúsurprise me‚Äù every time‚Äîand saves you from formatting headaches.

4. Anchor with an Opening Note

Start with ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre my go-to helper who explains things like you would to your favorite neighbor.‚Äù It‚Äôs like giving ChatGPT a friendly role‚Äîno more stiff, robotic replies.

5. Build a Prompt ‚ÄúCheat Sheet‚Äù

Save your favorite recipes: ‚ÄúEmail greeting + call to action,‚Äù ‚ÄúShopping list layout,‚Äù ‚ÄúTravel plan outline.‚Äù Copy, paste, tweak, and celebrate when it works first try.

6. Break Big Tasks into Snack-Sized Bites

Instead of ‚ÄúPlan the whole road trip,‚Äù try:

1. ‚ÄúPick the route.‚Äù
2. ‚ÄúFind rest stops.‚Äù
3. ‚ÄúList local attractions.‚Äù

Little wins keep you motivated and avoid overwhelm.

7. Keep Chats Fresh‚ÄîDon‚Äôt Let Them Get Cluttered

When your chat stretches out like a long group text, start a new one. Paste over just your opening note and the part you‚Äôre working on. A fresh start = clearer focus.

8. Polish Like a Diamond Cutter

If the first answer is off, ask ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs missing?‚Äù or ‚ÄúCan you give me an example?‚Äù One clear ask is better than ten half-baked ones.

9. Use ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Touch‚Äù to Guard Against Wandering Edits

Add ‚ÄúPlease don‚Äôt change anything else‚Äù at the end of your request. It might sound bossy, but it keeps things tight and saves you from chasing phantom changes.

10. Talk Like a Human‚ÄîDrop the Fancy Words

Chat naturally: ‚ÄúThis feels wordy‚Äîcan you make it snappier?‚Äù A casual nudge often yields friendlier prose than stiff ‚Äúoptimize this‚Äù commands.¬†

11. Celebrate the Little Wins

When ChatGPT nails your tone on the first try, give yourself a high-five. Maybe even share it on social media.¬†

12. Let ChatGPT Double-Check for Mistakes

After drafting something, ask ‚ÄúDoes this have any spelling or grammar slips?‚Äù You‚Äôll catch the little typos before they become silly mistakes.

13. Keep a ‚ÄúCommon Oops‚Äù List

Track the quirks‚Äîfunny phrases, odd word choices, formatting slips‚Äîand remind ChatGPT: ‚ÄúAvoid these goof-ups‚Äù next time.

14. Embrace Humor‚ÄîWhen It Fits

Dropping a well-timed ‚ÄúLOL‚Äù or ‚Äúyikes‚Äù can make your request feel more like talking to a friend: ‚ÄúYikes, this paragraph is dragging‚Äîhelp!‚Äù Humor keeps it fun.

15. Lean on Community Tips

Check out¬†[r/PromptEngineering](/r/PromptEngineering/)¬†for fresh ideas. Sometimes someone‚Äôs already figured out the perfect way to ask.

16. Keep Your Stuff Secure Like You Mean It

Always double-check sensitive info‚Äîlike passwords or personal details‚Äîdoesn‚Äôt slip into your prompts. Treat AI chats like your private diary.

17. Keep It Conversational

Imagine you‚Äôre texting a buddy. A friendly tone beats robotic bullet points‚Äîproof that even ‚Äúserious‚Äù work can feel like a chat with a pal.

Armed with these tweaks, you‚Äôll breeze through ChatGPT sessions like a pro‚Äîand avoid those ‚Äúoops‚Äù moments that make you groan.

i‚Äôm 20 and i‚Äôm a sophomore in college. i go to school in chicago and it‚Äôs in the literal middle of the city so of course, people have to go through it to get to other places in chicago. our campus is an open one and people who don‚Äôt go to the school are also allowed to use the space, utilize the green spaces and walk around on it. a lot of parents bring their children to the campus which i honestly do not have a problem with. i mean, it‚Äôs a little annoying when there‚Äôs a child screaming while you‚Äôre trying to study lol but for the most part, it‚Äôs not that bad. 

this week is finals week and i‚Äôm a psychology major with a really important final coming up. if i get an A on it, i‚Äôll be able to get an internship that i really want that basically guarantees me a job immediately after grad school if i complete it but i need to get an A on my final to be given the opportunity to do it. i‚Äôve been studying for hours literally every single day. the test is tomorrow and yesterday i decided to go outside to study since i had been holed up inside of my dorm for some days and wanted to get some fresh air. i got some coffee from an on campus cafe and went to sit at one of the tables outside and started to study. 

two women and a toddler were walking down the sidewalk and one of the women, the toddler‚Äôs aunt went inside the cafe to get something and the mom and the toddler were waiting outside for her by me. of course, the toddler wanted to play on the tables and the mom let her. there‚Äôs two tables and the toddler started to climb on the table that i was on while her mom literally was on her phone the entire time. then the toddler started to climb on the table i wasn‚Äôt on but i didn‚Äôt say anything because i don‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôs my responsibility to parent someone else‚Äôs child. then the toddler knocks over my coffee (and almost gets it all over my laptop btw) and the mom suddenly remembered she had a child with her and started rushing over and asking her if she was okay. then she apologized to me and told me she‚Äôd get me another coffee. i was a little annoyed because this wouldn‚Äôt have happened if she had just been watching her kid but she seemed genuinely apologetic and i just wanted to go back to studying so i just told her it was alright and that she didn‚Äôt need to buy me another. 

she apologizes and she walks away with her child to wait for her sister again. 30 seconds later they come back over to me and the mom said that her daughter felt so bad for spilling my coffee and that she wanted to make it up to me by playing with me‚Ä¶i was genuinely so confused üò≠. 1, why are you allowing your toddler to play with random people you know nothing about and 2, why would i want that? that‚Äôs not an apology, that‚Äôs a punishment like haven‚Äôt i been through enough. i didn‚Äôt wanna be rude though so i smiled at the little girl and told her that that was sweet but i‚Äôm really busy and then i look at the mom and tell her that i appreciate the gesture but i‚Äôm studying for an important final. she just smiled at me and told me that she was. sure i could take a break for a second and that it would only be until her sister came back‚Ä¶i already knew the battle i was going to face after she said that üíî

i told her once again that i was sorry (i shouldn‚Äôt have said sorry looking back, i just wanted her to shut the hell up) but i couldn‚Äôt stop studying just to play because i needed to prepare for my test. i don‚Äôt know if i was the first person she ever encountered who didn‚Äôt put their lives on hold to obsess over her daughter because guess what this lady does‚Ä¶she bent down to her daughter and was like ‚Äúit‚Äôs okay sweetie, she doesn‚Äôt want to play with you. i don‚Äôt know why she doesn‚Äôt want to play with you but everyone else wants to play with you so it‚Äôs okay.‚Äù naturally, the child starts crying because what child likes to be told nobody wants to play with them? it just felt so vindictive like she made her child cry to try and get under MY skin. 

so her sister comes out of the cafe and asks why the toddler is crying and the mom explains the situation (still interrupting my studying btw.) i was hoping the sister was a little sane and would tell the mom she was being irrational but i don‚Äôt know why i thought that because she looked at me and she asked me once again if i would play with her niece because she really wants to play with me. I DON‚ÄôT EVEN KNOW THIS CHILD HELLO?? why do y‚Äôall want me to play with her so bad? where are the survival skills? 

i was getting annoyed so i finally just told them that i needed to study because i need to pass my final to get an internship i want. then, the sister says ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt need a job anyway, you‚Äôre going to grow up and your husband will take care of you.‚Äù then she looked at my face and saw i didn‚Äôt laugh and she was like ‚Äúi‚Äôm kidding, i‚Äôm just kidding!‚Äù 

that part of the story was funny to tell my girlfriend 

anyway, once they both saw i was actually getting pissed off, the sister apologized to me and said it wasn‚Äôt my fault that her niece was crying, like yeah i know that, it‚Äôs her mom‚Äôs fault. after that, they left and i heard the mom promising her daughter that she‚Äôd find someone to play with her. EYEROLL. here‚Äôs an idea‚Ä¶maybe you could play with her!

who comes to a college campus during FINALS week and expects students to drop everything and pay all of their attention to a child they don‚Äôt even know? 

parents‚Ä¶that‚Äôs who.

1kkp30p,https://www.reddit.com/r/canoecamping/comments/1kkp30p/best_feeling_in_the_world/,Best feeling in the world,"Just wanted to share a thought. 

Every time another trip or overnight comes along there's a little window of time that might even be better than the trip itself. 

It's that time around 4am when you're doing the final checks on your boat loaded on the roof. You grab your gear back that's been carefully and meticulously packed since two nights before. You start pulling out of your driveway thinking about the delicious sip of gas station coffee and maybe a cigarette on the way up north. You start seeing the sun come up and have a sneaky delicious feeling of getting away with something. You imagine what everyone else's day might be like- looking from outside the rat race even for a brief time,  their commutes, bullshit meetings,  parking spaces and office pizza parties. 

None of that shit has anything to do with you. You made it. You are on the last chopper out of 'nam, the last boat leaving the island, the last plane out of Casablanca. Most days you drove past the guy with a boat on his roof rack and thought,  ugh that lucky dog, I wish I was headed out with my boat. Not this day. This day,  you're the one headed the opposite way of work on the morning with your boat on your truck at 5am. Everyone is driving past you thinking,  UGH the lucky son of a gun. 

That's the best feeling",16,1747045531.0,canoecamping,0,0.95,False
1kkp2yr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1kkp2yr/wife_giving_me_silent_treatment_today_i_genuinely/,"Wife giving me silent treatment today, I genuinely don't get it.","So this morning I woke up at 6am, did my workout (I'm trying to better myself and get fit), did the dishes from last night's dinner, ironed the 3 kids clothes for school. She got up at 07:30 and I asked if she slept well, she said ""yes"", asked if she wanted a coffee, she said ""no"". So I go wake my youngest up, make her breakfast, asked wife something menial like if her parcel is turning up today or something, she says ""don't know"". I ask if everything is ok, she says ""yes"", but seemingly to me it's not ok. 

Anyway, I wash my youngest ready for her to get dressed, wife dresses her, I take her to school. Come back, say hello to wife, she grunts, maybe she's just tired, I have a shower, ask if she's alright as she's just sat in bed watching YouTube, she says ""yep"" kinda curt like, I have to sort some packages out from sales and stuff, go into her a bit later to see if she wants a cup of tea, coffee, whatever, she says ""nope"" again quite curt. 

So I thought I'd see what's up again, asked if there was anything on her mind, ""nope"" I said ""I kinda of get the impression you're not doing to well, is there anything I can do?"" She says ""nope"", I asked if it was anything I'd done ""nope"", anything I haven't done? ""Nope, I'm simply in a bad mood"", ok so I asked if she wanted me to leave her alone, she said ""yep"". 

So I did. 

2 hours later she's now accusing me of not giving a fuck about her and that I'm selfish for occupying myself. I've been here before, if I now say I'll spend time with her she will say it's too late and that she doesn't want ""pity"" time, and if I don't she will say ""that's right, you just keep being you then"" in some ridiculing way. If I say ""well you asked me to leave you alone"" she will get angry that I'm ""making her out to be the bad guy"". 

I'm at my wits end here, this is the closest I've come to leaving but I know that once the kids come home she will be all happy and things are ok again. It's like she seriously resents me but I can't figure out why. I WANT to spend time with her, I've told her this, she says ""no you don't"". I WANT to give her the space she asks for sometimes, but then she accuses me of not caring. I do a lot of housework, she does laundry and hoovering, I do dishes, rubbish, draining the sewer (we have a problem with the sewer pipe), putting clothes out, tidying the kids rooms, ironing, some cooking, but she's always finding fault in what I do, I can't make her happy no matter what. I've expressed all this to her, and while she asks many things of me that I should change, when I ask her something in the same vein she says ""I am who I am, you knew this when we got together"", when I say well why can't you accept who I am, you knew who I was when we got together, she says life's not fair and it ""doesn't work like that"". 

I'm so fed up, but if I leave we will both be financially screwed, the rental market in the UK is a joke, and we live in a unique situation anyway, the bungalow we live in used to be my nans, she left it to my mum, mum had to buyout her brother, so they had to get an interest only mortgage to do that, so REALLY we need to stay here for the next 14 years otherwise I will be really screwing my mum over (she has many health problems, and wouldn't be able to deal with renting to people she doesn't know).

The second morning I‚Äôm with my boyfriend and the girl at the pool and we were topless. Because that was just the vibe. 

His friend joined us a bit later and immediately asked his girlfriend to put a shirt on. I usually have a bit of banter with this guy, so I said something about how he should run for local council with his leadership skills. It just slipped out of my mouth. 

Nothing I‚Äôve ever said has gone down that badly, just seconds of silence, looked right past me to my boyfriend. 

Who then suddenly has a problem with me being topless. Not once has he ever cared about modesty, especially his own. And he framed it with ‚Äúyou heard him‚Äù. 

At this point I‚Äôm just smiling and looking at both of them because it‚Äôs just so fucking bizarre. But I put my top on to keep the peace. 

The whole interaction lasted less than 30 seconds. Then they left to get coffees.
