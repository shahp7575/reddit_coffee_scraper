From the limited experience I have had, most times it is very thin and lacking the punch I normally expect from a flat white. Is it typically just a single shot of espresso? Or did I just do a bad job of picking my cafes?

When we tried Googling around, we were surprised that we couldn’t find a single book, *not even a pop science or coffee table book*, that’s fully dedicated to it.

That seems odd, right? For something so iconic and, dare I say, **key** (*ba-dum-tss*), you'd think there’d be at least one in-depth book covering its history, design, cultural significance, and so on.

So, does anyone know of a book like that? Something that’s focused entirely on the Arch? If not, I guess I’ll just have to write a terrible one in hopes that someone gets annoyed enough to write a good one I can actually read.

Drank frequently but not incredibly heavy. Sober the vast majority of time. A few years back got labs showed all liver function tests normal except ALT slightly high at 56.  Didnt have a primary care doctor so did nothing about it. Subsequent labs a year later showed all normal except ALT again slightly elevated at 60.  Didnt see doctor but started the gym regularly and eating better, coffee, and vitamin E.   Labs in July were perfect liver wise. 

About a month ago i had a bad night of sleep, waking at 3 unable to fall asleep. This proceeded to happen 7 nights in a row. Then the anxiety and depression set it. I didnt feel like doing anything, just want to stay home. Able to work from home so that helps. To cope i began drinking basically around the clock, but never too heavily. Just sips here and there to help take the edge off. This whole month i have not drank to the point of being intoxicated once. So even though i am drinking every day throughout the day, probably drinking less than was normal pattern which was more 5-6 beers a few nights a week. As month went on i found myself increasingly depressed, anxious, tired. Also strange symptoms of hypoglycemia (especially if I exercise, for days afterwards). Given more medicines to help me sleep with limited effect. Went to doctor last week had labs done. All were normal except glucose was high at 110 and ALT slightly elevated at 55. AST was normal, bilirubin normal, ALP normal…..but now just tired all the time. waking up at 3 most nights  and sometimes able to fall back asleep. I know I need to stop the drinking but one of the few things giving me comfort in this anxious depressed period. Appetite has really dropped off and when i eat i feel so full and bloated for hours. No pain, no jaundice, stool and urine were fine. Physical exam was fine. 

Does this sound indicative of anything Cirrhosis related?  I suppose it could all be stress/depression related but im so scared now.

1k4byzc,https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/comments/1k4byzc/your_next_promotion_starts_before_the_ask/,Your Next Promotion Starts Before the Ask,"Most software engineers wait until it's too late to start thinking about promotions.

They believe their code speaks for itself. They assume their managers are tracking their wins. They think hard work naturally converts to career growth.

They're wrong.

By the time you're sitting in that meeting asking for a promotion, you've already won or lost the battle—months ago.

The biggest mistake developers make: they expect their work will speak for itself, and they'll eventually receive the raise they deserve.

But the career path from Entry to Mid to Senior to Staff Engineer isn't paved with lines of code—it's built with strategic documentation, intentional visibility, and calculated leverage.

# The Invisible Career Tax You're Paying Right Now

There's a silent tax being paid by developers who believe in meritocracy: the Visibility Tax.

Every brilliant solution you implement without documenting its business impact? Taxed.

Every critical bug you fix without communicating its relevance? Taxed.

Every team initiative you lead without building internal advocates? Taxed heavily.

The result? Your peers—who may be doing less impactful work but documenting everything—are getting promotions while you're still waiting for someone to notice.

# Building Your Promotion File (Starting Today)

The developers who advance fastest maintain two critical documents that most engineers never create:

# 1. Your Impact Resume

This isn't your LinkedIn profile. It's an internal document tracking every win, large and small:

* **Projects completed** with specific business metrics affected
* **Technical challenges solved** and why they mattered to the company
* **Cross-team initiatives** you've led or contributed to
* **Mentorship** you've provided to other engineers
* **Knowledge base** contributions that elevated the entire team

You should constantly be documenting your impact and performance. Not just what you do, but specifically why it's impactful—whether that's revenue driven, efficiency created, or other metrics that matter to your company.

# 2. Your Social Proof Document

This is where you track what others say about your work:

* **Positive feedback** from peers, managers, and cross-functional partners
* **Kudos emails** saved in a dedicated folder
* **Slack messages** highlighting your contributions
* **Meeting mentions** where leadership recognized your work

Keep track of feedback you get, either written or verbal. Document when someone was impressed with your presentation or when a stakeholder complimented your documentation.

# Translating Technical Work into Business Value

Here's the harsh reality: your elegant code means nothing if management can't connect it to business outcomes.

The biggest mistake is asking without providing any data or context. Many companies are very data-driven. You need to show evidence—metrics, outcomes, and how you've exceeded your scope.

When documenting your work, follow this translation formula:

1. **Technical achievement**: ""Refactored the authentication service""
2. **Immediate result**: ""Reduced login failures by 32%""
3. **Business impact**: ""Preventing \~1,200 potential customer drop-offs per month, protecting approximately $240K in monthly recurring revenue""

# The Networking Secret Most Engineers Ignore

While your documentation creates your case, internal visibility creates your opportunity.

Many people focus solely on doing great work but forget to build relationships. You need to actively engage with leadership—schedule time with your manager's manager, ask thoughtful questions, and show interest in growth opportunities.

This doesn't mean becoming political or inauthentic. It means:

* **Requesting 1:1s** with senior engineers and leaders outside your team
* **Contributing visibly** in cross-functional meetings
* **Asking questions** that show you're thinking about the business, not just code
* **Sharing knowledge** through tech talks, blog posts, or documentation

People who build these relationships are more likely to be protected during layoffs or fast-tracked for promotions.

# External Offers: A Strategic Option, Not a Requirement

External offers can create leverage in negotiations, but they should be viewed as one possible tool, not a requirement.

Before pursuing this path, ask yourself: ""Would I genuinely take this new role if my current company doesn't match the offer?"" If the answer is no, think twice. Using offers as bluffs can damage relationships and trust.

If you do choose to use an external offer in negotiations:

* Emphasize your commitment to your current team and company first
* Frame it as market information rather than an ultimatum
* Never exaggerate or lie about offer details
* Be prepared to leave if necessary - don't make threats you won't follow through on

Remember that the strongest position comes from being genuinely open to both opportunities, not from using one as leverage against the other.

# Promotion Killers: Why Good Engineers Get Passed Over

Beyond missing documentation, there are several common reasons talented engineers fail to advance:

1. **Focusing solely on technical depth** while neglecting breadth and business knowledge
2. **Solving interesting problems** rather than impactful ones
3. **Being responsive rather than proactive** in identifying team needs
4. **Poor communication of accomplishments** in both written and verbal formats
5. **Failing to build advocates** outside your immediate team

These silent career killers often affect talented developers who mistakenly believe technical excellence alone will carry them forward.

# Your Promotion Action Plan

1. **Start documenting today**. Create your Impact Resume and Social Proof documents immediately.
2. **Track weekly wins**. Set a 15-minute calendar reminder every Friday to update both documents.
3. **Translate technical work**. Practice explaining your contributions in business terms, not just technical ones.
4. **Build your internal network**. Schedule one coffee chat with a leader outside your team each month.
5. **Research market rates**. Know what your skills are worth before any negotiation begins.

Don't wait until your review cycle to start thinking about promotion. By then, the decision has likely already been made.

The most successful engineers treat career advancement as a project—with documentation, milestones, and deliverables—not a wish or a hope.

Your promotion starts today, not when you ask for it.

I made a tool to scan through offer details, and have listed all of the UK ones below (if you are in another country, then the same methods apply, but you might have different offers).

# What is Freecash?

For those new here, Freecash is a rewards platform where you complete tasks like playing games, watching videos, and filling out surveys to earn coins. These coins can be exchanged for PayPal cash, gift cards, or crypto.

# Sign Up Bonus!

If you're new to Freecash, use my referral link to sign up and you'll receive a random bonus to kickstart your earnings! This gives you extra coins right from the start, helping you cash out faster:

[Click here to sign up and get your random bonus](https://freecash.com/r/tightaswhat)

**Important Note About Lite Mode**

New users may start in ""Lite Mode"" with access to only certain offers. To unlock full access, you'll need to complete some of the initially presented offers. Not all games are available in Lite Mode. Games like Empires & Puzzles and Word Collect are confirmed to be available in Lite Mode, making them good starting points.

# Why Ad-Based Rewards Are Easy Money

Most game offers require you to reach difficult levels or make purchases, but the games in this list specifically reward you for **watching ads within the app**. This is significantly easier and requires less time investment. This is because many of the games allow you to watch ads to earn ""energy"", etc. You just need to know where this bit in the game is!

# Essential Device Setup for Tracking:

1. **Enable Usage Access for Freecash** \- This is critical and not enabled by default
2. **Disable ""Manage if Unused""** for both Chrome and Freecash app
3. **Enable Background Usage** for both Chrome and Freecash app
4. **Accept cookies** when prompted in Chrome
5. **Only open games through the Freecash app's ""My Offers"" section**

For a step by step guide to doing the above, or if you encounter tracking issues, check out my complete troubleshooting guide [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/beermoneyuk/comments/1ji534o/freecash_playtime_ad_tracking_not_working_heres/).

# The Complete Ad Rewards Game List (April 2025)

*Note: ""Easy Payout"" refers to the lowest ad-watching task reward available. ""Total Ad Potential"" represents the sum of all ad-based rewards (not including progression tasks) according to the data I magically found in my Freecash account.*

# How to Maximise Your Ad Rewards

Based on the detailed offer data, I've discovered some optimal strategies:

**1. Minimal Effort, Maximum Returns**

These ""fill the bar"" tasks only require occasional interaction:

* A quick tap to start each ad
* Sometimes a tap to close when finished
* Brief navigation back to reward sections

The key advantage is you don't need to actively watch the ads. Start them, set your phone aside, and continue with whatever you were doing.

**2. Use a Secondary Device If Possible**

For best results, use a second phone or tablet dedicated to these offers:

* Keep your primary phone free for important calls/texts
* Run games continuously without disrupting your main device
* Avoid battery drain on your everyday phone
* Position the second device where it's convenient for occasional checks

**3. Create an Efficient Setup**

Arrange your spare device where you can easily reach it while doing other activities:

* On your desk during work
* Beside you while watching TV
* Near you while reading or relaxing
* In the kitchen during meal preparation

This minimizes the effort required while maximizing potential earnings.

**4. One Game at a Time - The Reality of Ad Watching**

You need to let each ad run its full course before starting another:

* Start an ad in a game
* Let it play completely (typically 30-60 seconds)
* Close it and start another in the same game
* Move to another game only after completing a batch of ads

The ads need to play, so its best to focus on one game at a time for maximum efficiency.

**5. Integrate With Your Regular Schedule**

Use natural breaks in your day to check and restart ads:

* Between tasks or meetings
* During TV commercial breaks
* While waiting for coffee to brew or food to cook
* During short breaks from other activities

This approach lets you earn rewards with minimal disruption to your normal routine.

# The Practical Ad-Watching Strategy

Based on real experience with these games, here's what actually works:

1. **Install games strategically** \- Start with Bus Craze and 2-3 other high-reward games rather than all at once
2. **Find the ad reward sections** \- Spend a few minutes exploring each game to locate where you can watch ads for rewards (usually under ""Free Rewards"" or similar)
3. **Set up next to your workspace** \- Position your phone where you can easily tap it occasionally while doing other things
4. **""Watch"" ads during downtime** \- Let the ads run while you're working, studying, watching TV, or doing chores
5. **Maintain a consistent habit** \- Check in briefly multiple times per day rather than trying to binge all at once

# Specific Tips for Each Game (some of these not currently available)

**Word Nut**

* There are several places where you can watch lots of ads in a row.
* On the home screen, click the daily bonus, pick one, and then ""reselect"" to play and add. Repeat.
* Another location is found by tapping the + symbol on your gold coin count (top right within each level), close the screen that pops up, and another ad offer will appear.

**Goblins Wood**

* This one doesnt have unlimited ads, but check in once or twice a day to find some in the following places...
* The welcome back screen on login.
* In game on ""golden"" boxes (ad plays after collecting).
* After collecting the free wooden chests
* In storage, you collect the free gold mining things, and then can tap to watch 5 videos.

**Mergedom**

* Very straightforward ad-watching opportunities
* If you are actually playing the game, then bonus rewards fall from the top of the screen. Watch an ad to collect these.
* Otherwisem click the lightning symbol at the top of the screen to open up the energy tab for ad watching galore.

# Important Notes:

1. **This will not make you rich.**
2. **Many of the games with these ad offers are awful**, Im not trying to complete levels. Just collect the ""ad engagement"" money.
3. **Always allow tracking** when asked during installation (this is mentioned in every game's requirements)
4. **New users only** \- these offers are for first-time installers
5. **Don't play on airplane mode** \- the data specifically warns this slows progress and might prevent rewards
6. Most offers give you 30-50 days to complete all tasks, so take your time

# My Results So Far

I've been testing this method for the past few weeks (so has u/Money_Spider420) and have already cashed out a good few pounds from freecash. Its not fun, but its easy money just from ""watching ads"" and tapping my phone. The key is multitasking! Here is proof:

1k4bvhi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1k4bvhi/am_i_delusional_probably/,Am I delusional? Probably…,"So I 28F met N 27M at work. We exchanged brief greetings etc. and then he slid into my DMs on instagram. We went out for coffee outside of work and really hit it off. I informed him on the first date that I am a single mum. Date number 2, he gives me no details just tells me to be ready by 5pm and be prepared to be swept off my feet. He picks me up and takes me to the beach, he has a picnic rug, candles, dinner and drinks set up, very romantic. We were then going to go to the cinema but there was nothing good to watch so we went back to his place and watched a movie. Of course, things got hot and heavy and I spent the night. He made it clear it's been a while since he's been intimate with anyone, and I did too. 

Fast forward a few weeks, we are just casually seeing eachother and having sleepovers, carpooling to work. I was going away for a week, so I asked him where things were going with us? He said he thinks I'm incredibly beautiful and loves spending time with me but he never considered being a step parent. It goes against his values and beliefs (I'm Australian and he is Slavic and considers himself conservative). We have a conversation around it all and agree to just be casual. I go away and he is consistently checking in, asking how my day was, sending me photos, reels, memes, even subtly asking if I'm sleeping alone. I get home and he wants me to come over straight away, before he has work that night. 

More details - we spend basically every second night together (sleepovers). We go out for dinners, breakfast, lunch. He cooks dinner and breakfast for me. Brings me coffee in bed. He's always the one initiating conversation and inviting me over. I buy him a sneaky chocolate every now and then. Man calls me princess and gorgeous. He even calls me beautiful during sex - not hot, sexy or other typical things. He washes me in the shower. Washes my clothes when I sleepover. He obsesses over my small features, hands, feet, ears. He’s always affectionate, touching me, stroking me. I catch him just staring at me. 
He takes care of me, and he even voices that - ‘I take such good care of you’. 

Messy part - he messaged me while I was at work one day saying to call him when I'm driving home, kind of urgent (before this we didn't have eachothers phone numbers). I call him, he lets me know he has been tested and has an STD - stating he hasn't been with anyone else since he was last tested. I immediately apologised if it came from me. I get myself an appointment and inform my last partner which ended 12 months prior (but did sleep together once 3 months ago) - he gets tested too and sure enough it came from him. Anyway, things with N were tense and awkward, no contact for 2 days. He reached out and asked how I was. I was real and honest and said I was really struggling and apologetic, I'd had other things in my personal life going on too and hadn't slept for 3 days. He told me to come spend the night to get a decent sleep, I did. Next night after work he messages and says 'I'm ordering pizza are you coming?' I say yes. I get to his house, there's pizza, chocolate, popcorn and wine laid out on the bed. Obviously these two nights we weren't intimate given the situation. But he was full of affection. 

Things turned out better, he is acting normal again, consistently messaging, checking in and wanting to see me. We are back to every second night or even 2/3 in a row. Still cooking for me and taking me out.

Fast forward a few weeks, things are still good. I feel like feelings are getting stronger. He's even calling me to talk not just messaging. He seems more interested in actually asking about my kids etc. he's giving jealous vibes when other men are mentioned. His eyes light up whenever he sees me around at work.

# Board Book vs Hardcover: 2025's Best Choice?

Choosing the right format for children's books is a crucial decision for parents, educators, and gift-givers. Board books and hardcover books are two of the most popular options, each offering unique advantages and disadvantages. This article provides a comprehensive comparison of board books and hardcover books, highlighting their key features, benefits, and suitability for different age groups and reading scenarios. By understanding the differences between these formats, you can make an informed decision that aligns with your child's developmental stage and reading preferences. This evaluation considers factors such as durability, cost, age appropriateness, and overall reading experience.

 ## Key Features Analysis

The choice between board books and hardcover books often depends on understanding their distinct construction and design elements. Each format serves a unique purpose in a child's early reading journey.

**Board Book Durability:** Board books are specifically designed to withstand the rigors of infant and toddler handling. They are constructed from thick, durable cardboard that resists tearing, bending, and chewing. The pages are typically laminated or coated to protect against spills and stains, making them easy to clean. This robust construction ensures that board books can endure the wear and tear associated with young children's exploration and interaction with books. Their compact size and rounded corners further enhance safety and make them ideal for little hands to grasp and manipulate.

**Hardcover Book Construction:** Hardcover books, on the other hand, feature a rigid cover made of cardboard or thick paperboard, often covered with cloth or paper. The pages are typically made of paper and are sewn or glued together to form a book block. While hardcover books are more durable than paperback books, they are still susceptible to damage from rough handling. Tearing, bending, and water damage are common issues with hardcover books, especially when handled by young children.

**Page Count and Content:** Board books usually have a limited number of pages, typically ranging from 10 to 20. This is due to the thickness of the board material and the need to keep the book manageable for small children. The content in board books is often simple and repetitive, focusing on basic concepts such as colors, shapes, animals, and everyday objects. Hardcover books can have a much wider range of page counts, from picture books with 32 pages to chapter books with hundreds of pages. This allows for more complex stories, detailed illustrations, and a wider variety of content suitable for older children.

**Illustrations and Design:** Both board books and hardcover books utilize illustrations to enhance the reading experience. However, the style and complexity of the illustrations can vary depending on the target age group. Board books often feature bold, simple illustrations with bright colors to capture the attention of infants and toddlers. Hardcover books may have more detailed and sophisticated illustrations, including watercolor paintings, realistic drawings, and mixed-media artwork. The design of hardcover books also allows for more creative layouts and visual elements, such as fold-out pages, pop-ups, and interactive features.

**Size and Weight:** Board books are typically smaller and lighter than hardcover books, making them easy for young children to hold and carry. Their compact size also makes them convenient for travel and storage. Hardcover books come in a variety of sizes, ranging from small picture books to large coffee table books. The weight of hardcover books can vary depending on the page count and paper quality, but they are generally heavier than board books.

 ## Core Benefits

The advantages of each book format are critical to understanding which one is best suited to a particular child or reading situation. These benefits speak directly to how the books engage young readers.

**Board Books: Enhanced Durability and Safety:** The primary benefit of board books is their exceptional durability. Parents can rest assured that these books can withstand the inevitable chewing, tearing, and throwing that comes with young children. The rounded corners and thick pages also make them safer for babies and toddlers, reducing the risk of cuts or scrapes. This durability translates to a longer lifespan for the book, making it a worthwhile investment for families with young children.

**Hardcover Books: Expanded Content and Complexity:** Hardcover books offer a wider range of content and complexity compared to board books. They can accommodate longer stories, more detailed illustrations, and a greater variety of themes and topics. This makes them suitable for older children who are ready for more challenging reading experiences. The larger page size and higher-quality paper also allow for more visually stunning artwork and designs, enhancing the overall aesthetic appeal of the book.

**Board Books: Early Learning and Development:** Board books play a crucial role in early learning and development. The simple, repetitive text and bright, engaging illustrations help infants and toddlers develop language skills, visual recognition, and fine motor skills. Board books also introduce children to basic concepts such as colors, shapes, and animals, laying the foundation for future learning. The tactile nature of board books encourages exploration and sensory development.

**Hardcover Books: Fostering a Love of Reading:** Hardcover books can foster a love of reading in older children by exposing them to a wider range of stories and genres. They can spark imagination, encourage critical thinking, and promote empathy. Reading hardcover books can also help children develop vocabulary, comprehension skills, and a deeper appreciation for literature. The act of holding and reading a hardcover book can also create a sense of ownership and pride, further encouraging a lifelong love of reading.

 ## FAQs Section

Addressing common questions helps provide clarity and reassurances for potential buyers contemplating the book formats.

**What age range is best suited for board books?**
Board books are generally recommended for infants and toddlers, typically from birth to age 3. Their durability and simple content make them ideal for young children who are still developing their fine motor skills and language abilities.

**Are hardcover books safe for young children?**
While hardcover books are generally safe, they are not as durable or child-friendly as board books. The thin pages can be easily torn, and the sharp corners can pose a safety hazard. It is recommended to supervise young children when they are handling hardcover books to prevent damage or injury.

**How do I clean board books?**
Board books can be easily cleaned with a damp cloth or baby wipe. Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners, as these can damage the laminated surface. For stubborn stains, a mild soap solution may be used.

**Can hardcover books be recycled?**
Hardcover books can be recycled, but the cover must be removed first. The cover is often made of cardboard or paperboard and can be recycled separately. The pages of the book can also be recycled, but it is important to check with your local recycling facility to ensure that they accept books.

### Key Differences Summary

Board books excel in durability and are ideal for very young children who are still developing their fine motor skills.

 ## Ideal User Profile

Understanding which types of readers benefit most from each format is a useful way to personalize the selection process.

**Parents of Infants and Toddlers:** Board books are an essential addition to any nursery or playroom. Their durability and safety make them perfect for young children who are still exploring the world through their senses. The simple content and engaging illustrations help develop early literacy skills and foster a love of reading from a young age.

**Early Childhood Educators:** Board books are a valuable resource for preschools, daycare centers, and libraries. They can withstand the heavy use of multiple children and provide a safe and engaging learning experience. Board books can be used to teach basic concepts, promote language development, and encourage social interaction.

**Parents of Older Children:** Hardcover books are ideal for parents who want to encourage their children to develop a love of reading and explore more complex stories and themes. Hardcover books can be used for bedtime reading, independent reading, or shared reading experiences. They can also be used to supplement classroom learning and expand children's knowledge of different subjects.

 ## Buying Recommendations & Conclusion

A thoughtful conclusion helps to synthesize the information and provide a final recommendation to potential buyers.

When deciding between board books and hardcover books, consider your child's age, developmental stage, and reading preferences. Board books are ideal for infants and toddlers who need durable and safe books with simple content. Hardcover books are better suited for older children who are ready for more complex stories and illustrations.

Overall, both board books and hardcover books play an important role in a child's literacy development. Board books provide a foundation for early learning and development, while hardcover books foster a love of reading and expand children's knowledge and understanding of the world. While board books are limited in content, their durability makes them the right choice in the first stages of a child's engagement with reading. Weighing the strengths and weaknesses of each format allows for a smart purchasing decision.

I have a few questions around that.

1. Will it give out a uniformly coarse grind which is good for French press?

2. Are there any better (more affordable) options that can get the job done?

The 2nd question is because: I’m not a daily drinker. I drink coffee only on the weekends. My rational thinking is preventing me from buying a piece of equipment that’s equivalent to the cost of 3 years’ worth of coffee.

Reasons for looking for the grinder:
My pre-ground coffee lasts me about 4 months. It goes stale after a couple of months which is why I want to move to whole bean. 

As you can see, it’s a bit of a catch-22 and I’m hoping that the good people of this sub will point me towards a workable solution.

TLDR: I’m looking for an affordable grinder that can get the job done for an infrequent but passionate coffee drinker whose only brewing method is French Press. Something cheaper than a Timemore C2, if that’s a possibility.

I’m also open to getting something from overseas, if there are good options available.

Hey there!  

I’m a 25-year-old from Punjab, currently living in Italy—because apparently, I thought surviving on pasta and coffee alone was a solid life plan (no regrets so far). Living abroad has been a great journey of self-discovery, mostly realizing how much I miss home-cooked food and how bad I am at folding fitted sheets.  

A bit about me—I’m into sports, movies, and TV shows, and I have a ""slightly"" obsessive love for Formula 1. If you also enjoy high-speed drama and questionable Ferrari strategies, we’ll probably get along great. If not, don’t worry—I promise I can talk about other things too. Like how pineapple on pizza is an unresolved international debate.  

But honestly, I think good connections are built on more than just shared interests. I value meaningful conversations, mutual respect, and the kind of banter that makes you laugh at your phone like an idiot in public. Quality time is super important to me—whether it’s sharing a meal, exploring new places, or just having a deep conversation about life (or which fictional character had the worst plot arc).  

Speaking of food, I love cooking. I wouldn’t call myself a *chef*, but I can definitely make something edible, and I promise to only slightly judge your taste in food. If you think cereal counts as a meal, I won’t argue. Probably.  

So if you’re up for a chat—whether it’s about life, movies, or just debating whether naps should be considered a sport—drop a message! Looking forward to meeting someone who’s down for good convos and maybe some friendly roasting along the way.

…to a client that's responded to your outreach, asking for “more details”

What do you say?

“We turn your old leads into sales using AI”

* Short
* Snappy
* No fluff

But... you already said that in your initial message.

They want to know the SPECIFICS. The nuts and bolts of how it all works.

On the phone, this tends to be where we get “motor mouth”.

Over email, we turn our typing fingers into dust writing out long explanations.

Neither will do you any favours.

If someone sends me 4 paragraphs of info or talks AT ME for 10 minutes straight…

…my brain zones out.

Any sort of waffle and I’m already thinking about something else before that person’s halfway through their sales spiel.

I guarantee big clients with long to-do lists, will do the same.

And remember, the goal of our outreach ISN’T TO SELL the service.

There is NOTHING you can say, type or explain…

That will come close to the “selling power” of them seeing the AI in action.

The ONLY purpose of our outreach is to:

1. Start a conversation 
2. Peak their interest
3. Sell the coffee date/demo 
4. Get commitment they’ll turn up to the call

Anything other than that…

You’ll get into “info dump” territory.

This will kill their curiosity, flick their “this sounds complicated” switch…

…and put you straight into the MAYBE LATER pile.

So, what do you do when you’re asked to explain how it all works?

If I was asked, this is what I would say:

————————

""This is really hard to explain in 10 seconds, or over an email.

I really wanted to work with you, so before I reached out, I spent some time building a DEMO for \[THEIR SPECIFIC COMPANY NAME\]

It's ready now. If you have 10 minutes, you can demo it yourself and try to break the AI?""

————————

Then jump on the call and DEMO

If they don't accept that…

I would follow up the next day with a loom and remind them this is a 100% performance-based deal.

AND we do this on the leads that are dead to them anyway, so what is there to lose?

Zalming Blaze is a smart trading platform that simplifies the process of investing in markets like cryptocurrencies, stocks, and forex. Built for ease of use, it uses intelligent algorithms to monitor market trends and make trades on your behalf.

Its sleek, minimal interface and customizable settings make it an excellent option for people who want control, but not complexity.

2. Set your trading preferences and risk levels.
3. The bot monitors global markets in real-time.
4. When an opportunity arises, it opens or closes positions based on your rules.
5. You can either watch passively or jump in with manual trades.

You also get access to a demo account, which lets you test everything without risking real cash. A perfect feature for beginners or cautious pros.

1k4biab,https://www.reddit.com/r/Situationships/comments/1k4biab/situationship_or_relationship/,Situationship or relationship?,"This is going to be a long one. 

So I 28F met N 27M at work. We exchanged brief greetings etc. and then he slid into my DMs on instagram. We went out for coffee outside of work and really hit it off. I informed him on the first date that I am a single mum. Date number 2, he gives me no details just tells me to be ready by 5pm and be prepared to be swept off my feet. He picks me up and takes me to the beach, he has a picnic rug, candles, dinner and drinks set up, very romantic. We were then going to go to the cinema but there was nothing good to watch so we went back to his place and watched a movie. Of course, things got hot and heavy and I spent the night. He made it clear it's been a while since he's been intimate with anyone, and I did too. 

Fast forward a few weeks, we are just casually seeing eachother and having sleepovers, carpooling to work. I was going away for a week, so I asked him where things were going with us? He said he thinks I'm incredibly beautiful and loves spending time with me but he never considered being a step parent. It goes against his values and beliefs (I'm Australian and he is Slavic and considers himself conservative). We have a conversation around it all and agree to just be casual. I go away and he is consistently checking in, asking how my day was, sending me photos, reels, memes, even subtly asking if I'm sleeping alone. I get home and he wants me to come over straight away, before he has work that night. 

More details - we spend basically every second night together (sleepovers). We go out for dinners, breakfast, lunch. He cooks dinner and breakfast for me. Brings me coffee in bed. He's always the one initiating conversation and inviting me over. I buy him a sneaky chocolate every now and then. Man calls me princess and gorgeous. He even calls me beautiful during sex - not hot, sexy or other typical things. He washes me in the shower. Washes my clothes when I sleepover. He obsesses over my small features, hands, feet, ears. He’s always affectionate, touching me, stroking me. I catch him just staring at me. 
He takes care of me, and he even voices that - ‘I take such good care of you’. 

Messy part - he messaged me while I was at work one day saying to call him when I'm driving home, kind of urgent (before this we didn't have eachothers phone numbers). I call him, he lets me know he has been tested and has an STD - stating he hasn't been with anyone else since he was last tested. I immediately apologised if it came from me. I get myself an appointment and inform my last partner which ended 12 months prior (but did sleep together once 3 months ago) - he gets tested too and sure enough it came from him. Anyway, things with N were tense and awkward, no contact for 2 days. He reached out and asked how I was. I was real and honest and said I was really struggling and apologetic, I'd had other things in my personal life going on too and hadn't slept for 3 days. He told me to come spend the night to get a decent sleep, I did. Next night after work he messages and says 'I'm ordering pizza are you coming?' I say yes. I get to his house, there's pizza, chocolate, popcorn and wine laid out on the bed. Obviously these two nights we weren't intimate given the situation. But he was full of affection. 

Things turned out better, he is acting normal again, consistently messaging, checking in and wanting to see me. We are back to every second night or even 2/3 in a row. Still cooking for me and taking me out.

Fast forward a few weeks, things are still good. I feel like feelings are getting stronger. He's even calling me to talk not just messaging. He seems more interested in actually asking about my kids etc. he's giving jealous vibes when other men are mentioned. His eyes light up whenever he sees me around at work. And recently he was saying things like I wish you had waited for me, we could have had mini me’s running around. 

Then tonight, hits me with ‘if I’m being honest, I’m worried you’re going to get hurt’. I’ve made it clear to him that I’m happy just doing what we are doing. But he really is throwing off relationship vibes, or am I just extremely delusional?
Is he going to come around or are his values and beliefs too strong to allow that?
I’ve been single for 5 years, is this the way that ‘friends with benefits’ act?

I'm not asking about, studying for 10+ hours, I'm asking where do you get the time to do it","The question sounds dumb, but here's a better articulation, where do you find the time to have bath, lunch, dinner, coffee break and nap and still find time to study? It's really frustrates me how these activities consume more of my time 💀 Whenever I study, I'm very focused about it and do it, but I feel like everyday I can only squeeze out a max of 4 hours of study, and the rest of the time goes in bath, lunch, dinner, coffee break and nap 💀. I know this sounds idiotic, but this is really what happens. Everytime, I come for breakfast, dinner or lunch, with family without realising I end up spending 1.5+ hours downstairs doing absolutely nothing, but having a great time with them (me in my mind thinking it's only been 15 minutes) and then go back to my room and realise that the entire light dynamic in the room has changed (in the sense I spent way too much time down). Now I believe the second thing I believe that hinders my study schedule is my nap 😁, goes man do i not nap, but i hibernate. If I start napping, I begin to dream (this where all the problem begins), and I end up getting up really late. Say I sleep at 3:00p.m, I end up getting up at 6:00p.m feeling really refreshed, but bearing the guilt of having lost THREE WHOLE HOURS. As such I don't have any distractions like a girlfriend, video games, etc,. I think you get where I'm coming from. 
i) How do you guys minimise the time you take to such mundane activities to squeeze out more time for studying 
ii) Should I start skipping meals, or eat less and spend less time with my family for the next month
iii) The most important question: How to stop napping. If there are afternoon-nap addicts here you know damn well what I'm talking about. I mean these afternoon naps are therapeutic and addictive asf. They take you to a whole nother galaxy and bring you back 💀, it's as though the moment it strikes 3:30p.m, my body just refuses to study further without a nap

After days of coffee-fueled coding sessions, we've finally released [TinyMCP](https://github.com/Qihoo360/TinyMCP) into the wild! It's our take on a C++ SDK for the Model Context Protocol (MCP) that lets your apps talk to AI assistants like Claude and Cursor.

## Why we made this

We built TinyMCP because our team needed a lightweight C++ solution that could:
- Run super fast (because who likes waiting?)
- Use minimal resources (your RAM will thank you)
- Work on different platforms without a fuss
- Play nicely with desktop applications (especially on Windows 

## Perfect for desktop apps

This is especially handy if you're building desktop AI clients or tools because:
- Your users get snappy response times
- Everything can run locally if needed
- It's easy to integrate with existing C++ desktop applications
- Resource usage stays reasonable (no Chrome-level memory hogging)

## Give it a spin!

If you're a C++ dev curious about adding AI capabilities to your projects, swing by our GitHub repo: https://github.com/Qihoo360/TinyMCP

My drink tasted like chocolate milk not a coffee drink with a hint of chocolate. 

Who are the people that insist on such sugary drinks?  Why does Starbucks default like this.  Seems to me the recipe for a medium (grande) should be 2 pumps and those with aggressive sweet-tooths can always request more.

Galactic Council Emergency Session 3391  
**Subject: Unauthorized Mimicry of Zelargi Phasing Tech**  
**Status: Confused yelling and one fainted intern**

The Council Chamber was louder than usual.

Ambassador Vorlax was already pacing figure-eights around the central dais, his exoskeleton rattling like a broken wind chime.

Councilor Jeex of the Crystalline Nexus held up an image from his datapad. “What… what *is that?*”

“It’s a… a fork,” said Councilor Lyshi of the Nebulites. “A *planet-sized tuning fork.* On Earth.”

Another holo-image flickered into view, showing the monstrous structure rising from Earth's equator—two sleek arms of hyperalloy angling into the stratosphere, pulsing faintly in low-frequency resonance.

“Where did they get the plans?” someone asked.

A whisper echoed through the chamber.

“The Zelargi.”

Every member went still.

The *Zelargi* were known as the most elegant race in the known galaxy. Tall, luminous, translucent-skinned beings whose technology was so advanced it could phase entire cities out of time—*and* make them smell like orchids.

They were also notoriously secretive. Not a single race had ever successfully copied their tech. Entire civilizations had gone bankrupt just *trying* to reverse-engineer a Zelargi spoon.

And now the humans had built a planetary-scale phasing fork.

“Summon Trina,” Vorlax groaned. “Just—just get her in here.”

**\[Transcript Begins\]**

*Ambassador Trina enters the chamber with coffee in hand and sunglasses on indoors. A level of diplomatic audacity rarely seen.*

Vorlax: “Ambassador Trina. Kindly explain *this*—” *(points furiously at image of Earth’s tuning fork)* “—abomination.”

Trina: “Oh, that? That’s Project Dimensional Driftstick.”

Councilor Lyshi: “…Driftstick?”

Trina: “Yeah. It makes the whole planet *phase.* In case of cosmic threats. Like gamma ray bursts. Or eldritch geometry. Or Mondays.”

Zelargi Observer Ambassador Celiv’ae: *(levitating and glowing with barely-contained rage)* “Your species should not *have* the knowledge to even conceptualize phasing technology, let alone *build it.*”

Trina sips her coffee. “We vibed it.”

Celiv’ae: “You *what.*”

Trina: “We figured if we matched the resonance of Zelargi tech—emotionally, philosophically, sonically, y’know—it would just kind of… happen.”

Councilor Jeex: “Are you telling us… your species attained forbidden phasing tech… by *vibing in the same emotional frequency* as the Zelargi?”

Trina: “Yup. Took six months of weird jazz and glowstick meditation circles. And one guy named Fred who could smell causality.”

*Brevera is seen in the background, quietly taking notes and vibrating with stress.*

Vorlax: “And you built a—*a planetary tuning fork*—because?”

Trina: “Contingency, obviously. You never know when a cosmic storm’s gonna roll through and try to make everyone backwards. It’s like insurance, but vibey.”

Celiv’ae: “You cannot *just* build things like this. Phasing alters quantum consistency. It destabilizes dimensional anchors!”

Trina: “We added emotional grounding emitters.”

Jeex: “…What is that?”

Trina: “Puppy videos. On a loop. Deep core. Keeps the vibe human.”

*Zelargi ambassador starts glowing so brightly two interns collapse.*

Councilor Th’voss: “So let me summarize: you stole sacred technology by emotionally resonating with its creators, built an absurd tuning fork on a planetary scale, and justified it with… mood insurance?”

Trina: “If can, why not?”

Imagine describing your app in plain English and watching it come to life through auto-generated code. That’s not the future anymore—it’s happening now.

# What Is AI Auto Code App Development?

It’s the process of using artificial intelligence to write application code automatically. AI tools like GitHub Copilot, Amazon CodeWhisperer, and Google’s Gemini can generate boilerplate code, UI elements, and even suggest architecture patterns—all with minimal human input.

# Why Are Developers Obsessed With It?

* **Faster development cycles**
* **Fewer bugs and cleaner syntax**
* **Boost in productivity**
* **More time for innovation and testing**

* Automated testing and debugging
* Code refactoring and documentation
* Seamless DevOps integration
* Real-time code suggestions

Even non-tech users can build apps now—welcome to the age of **citizen development**.

# AI in DevOps and Testing

AI is revolutionizing CI/CD pipelines and QA processes. It predicts bugs before they happen, generates realistic test data, and even recommends deployment strategies.

# Challenges and Things to Watch Out For

* **Code quality isn’t always perfect**
* **Intellectual property concerns**
* **Model bias in code suggestions**
* **Security risks from external dependencies**

Think of AI as a fast typist, not a seasoned architect—you still need human insight to guide it.

# New Career Roles Are Emerging

Say hello to the **Prompt Engineer**, **AI-Augmented Developer**, and **AI Ethics Lead**. These aren’t roles of the future—they’re in demand *right now*.

# Best Practices for Success

* Always review AI-generated code
* Train your team on how to use the tools properly
* Keep security and compliance in check
* Use AI as a co-pilot, not the driver

# Final Thoughts

AI-powered app development is transforming how we build, scale, and maintain software. But it’s not about replacing developers—it’s about **amplifying human creativity**.

Use it wisely, and you’ll ship faster, code smarter, and innovate more than ever.

1k4bc9g,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1k4bc9g/a_reality_tv_show_made_my_blood_boil/,A reality tv show made my blood boil,"Some context: I was raised by a narc mother and physically/emotionally abused. A few days ago I was watching this reality tv show where the mothers from two families switch places for a week, and one of the mothers was a narc. This really struck me and made my blood boil, because rveryone seemed  charmed by the narc and kept exclaiming about how hard her life must be. What about her victim ?

TL;WL: saw a typical narc mother abuse her child, other people's children, and her puppy. Nobody seems to notice anything is wrong. This hits pretty hard and I wanted to vent here. 

One of the mothers, let's call her Rebecca, is an obese, recently-divorced, sexist narc. I'm not mentioning her weight to body-shame her, but because it plays a part in how she abuses her daughter, Ana, 8yo. The other, let's call her Elsa, is a 40-something, pretty, healthy woman. She has, as far I can see from 1h of footage, a healthy, trusting ralationship with her two daughters, Estelle (5yo) and Kim (11yo), although she knows Ana is being abused even before she sees her (after seeing the house) so I think she was also abused as a child. Her husband is blind to Rebecca, the narc's, techniques, and likes to pretend he's a savvy french chef (I'm french. He barely knows how to cook). 

Okay. So Rebecca leaves to live Elsa's life for a week. As soon as she arrives, she starts touching Estelle without her consent. She's sitting on a couch and literally smashing Estelle into her hard-edged purse. Estelle is doing her best to ignore her. Sitting in front of them is Estelle's dad, the savvy chef, who never seems to notice anything is wrong. 

But that's just the first part. Rebecca starts grooming the savvy chef from the first day, by comparing him to her evil, demonic ex and blaming his wife Elsa for everything. For example, she asks him what he does with his kids. The answer: absolutely nothing. Kim does ballet and he has no idea how often (4 times/week). Anyway, she explains that it's Elsa's fault: the chef is working, and he doesn't have time to spend with his kids (he works a 9/5 in an office). It's unclear why Elsa is evil, but she is. 

Let's talk about Ana, Rebecca's 8yo daughter. She's being physically as well as emotionally abused every day. 

First of all, let's talk about the beatings. Those of us who went through them know what it's like to be beaten until you know the ""public speech"" by heart, eg the narc is a loving parent, xyz person is evil, and the world is out to get us. Those who don't: the child who says this will be very stiff. They're afraid and very stressed. If they forget a word they'll often close their eyes of look to the side as they try to remember ; when they do they'll talk very fast. Ana did exactly this anytime the tv people asked her about her mom, her dad, herself, or gender roles. 

But the real proof is this: on day 3 she started beating on this waist-high punching bag in the living room and yelling ""this is what you get if you don't do your math homework, you little bitch"" over and over. This is an actual quote, although it's translated to english. And I really don't see why an 8yo would do that unless somebody does it to her: her narc mother Rebecca. 

The emotional abuse: her obese mother has a health fixation (this is why her weight matters). She forbids her kid to eat ""pizza, sodas, sugar, and only integral wheat"". I myself don't eat sugar and limit takeout, so I'm not attacking that. The problem is that Ana, in her scripted appeal to her dad to come back, keeps saying ""and you can take me out to the park and we cane at ice cream"". If she never has sugar, how can she crave ice cream ? Because Rebecca gets cravings for it, but shecs not getting ice cream for herself ; no, she's getting it for Ana ! Now, if the ice cream happens to be coffee-flavored and Ana wants vanilla, well, too bad and time for a narc temper tantrum. 

The kid can cry on command. I think we all know why: when she cries for the right stuff, like getting separated from her mother, she gets rewarded. Classic narc stuff. 

They both abuse animals. Rebecca got a little dog right after her divorce. He's around 4-5months old, so still a puppy. When they take him out on walks, if he stops to sniff something, both mother and daughter will lift him by the leash until all four of his paws are in the air. It's a wonder he's still alive. I don't blame the daughter, because she gets treated like that: why should she treat a dog better than her mother treats her ? But I do blame Rebecca. 

A disclaimer: Rebecca demonizes her ex all the time, and has turned Ana against him as well. But he probably hit her, and maybe Ana as well. He's probably not a good person either.

I’m an exchange student coming in for my third year studying Economics, and I’m currently looking for a room or shared housing situation starting in the Fall Quarter. I’ll be in town for the full academic year and am hoping to find a comfortable, clean, and friendly place to live.

A bit about me:

* I’m 19 ( I will be 20 when I arrive on campus), originally from Spain, and super excited to experience life here.
* I’m clean, respectful of shared spaces, and always pay rent on time.
* I enjoy meeting new people, but I also respect personal space.
* I’m pretty quiet during the week (classes + studying), but always up for a coffee or cooking dinner together.
* I don’t smoke, don’t party excessively, and I’m happy to live with people of any background.

Ideally, looking for a place close to campus or easily accessible by public transport if possible. 

If you or someone you know is looking for a chill, responsible roommate or has a spare room, please feel free to message me! Happy to chat or hop on a quick video call.

Thanks so much! 🙌

Zoey reached for the water bottle with a trembling hand and took a shaky sip. Hangovers didn't sit quite as well as they used to when she was nineteen. Where was she? She peeled the quilt off her body and sat up, her head pounding with the force of an army charging up the hill of Mount Doom.
The living room looked like a warzone. Crusts of pizza were scattered across the coffee table. The couch she’d slept on had some sticky, unknown substance dripping down the sides. Finnigan’s disco ball, which he’d thought would add flair, was now threatening to fall at any given moment from the ceiling.
Zoey rubbed her eyes, streaked with mascara, and hunched over the back of the couch to take in the sight of the kitchen. Jerome, the mangy goose, slept soundly on the countertop next to a tower of take-out boxes. Empty bottles and red paper cups filled the kitchen, so many that the navy blue color of the counters was barely visible.
Zoey ran her hand through her wavy mess of hair and felt a particularly grim sticky residue within it.
“Urgh – gross,” she muttered, grimacing.
She stretched out her body, her feet reaching the coffee table, her swollen foot aching as she knocked over a beer bottle in the process.
She examined her bruised, purple foot. Was that from dancing on the kitchen counter, pouring shots into people’s mouths from the bottle?
Yeah, Astrid might actually kill her this time.
Zoey bit her nails nervously. Sure, getting Astrid riled up was fun, but only when it ended with a hug, a kettle of boiling coffee, and a few laughs about Zoey’s reckless ways.
She knew her antics always managed to make people smile, and god, making people happy was what made Zoey shine. Astrid, on the other hand, was a tough cookie to crack. Sure, the lists and endless schedules drove Zoey nuts, but if Astrid let her hair down every once in a while, she'd see that Zoey just wanted her duo back.
“Rosie Posie! I’m making breakfast!” she sang, her voice dripping with mock enthusiasm. “We have vodka, orange juice, a little bit of tequila, Finnigan’s god-awful jungle juice, and maybe the residue of cheese from an unwanted slice of pizza!”
No response. Zoey shrugged and tiptoed toward Rose’s bedroom. She gave the oak door a soft knock.
“Rosie?” she whispered, cracking the door open to find Rose fast asleep under her cream waffle duvet. Rose’s room was the antithesis of Zoey’s: quiet, serene. It was filled with photos of college parties, graduation, and the trio’s past adventures, hanging above a mismatched dresser cluttered with half-empty perfume bottles. Rose’s scrubs were crumpled on the floor, and Zoey’s plant, the one she’d gifted Rose when she finished university, sat forlorn in the corner. Its leaves were nearly withered but still clinging to life.
Zoey slipped under the duvet and curled up against Rose. Rose stirred, opening one eye to peek at her.
“What time is it? And no, I don’t really feel like vodka or someone’s half-assed attempt at eating pizza for breakfast, thanks.”
Zoey gave her a once-over and winked.
“Well, there’s also Finnigan’s jungle juice that he made with—”
“Please don’t finish that sentence,” Rose interrupted with a small laugh, yawning so wide it looked like the Grand Canyon.
“What state is the rest of the flat in?” Rose asked as she looked at Zoey, who couldn’t find the words. Astrid still wasn’t home, and her damage control was growing thin.
“Look, Monica Geller wouldn’t be impressed, and the goose is basically our new flatmate, but I think—”
Rose sat up suddenly, her eyes wide. “What do you mean the goose is still here?”
Zoey began to twiddle her fingers, then brought them to her mouth to nervously gnaw on them. “Yeah, the duck…”
“Zo—” Rose breathed, shaking her head. “Astrid’s really going to murder you for this. First the raccoon, then the homeless guy, and now—”
“Yeah, yeah, I know,” Zoey interjected. “A long, drawn-out torture. I hope she uses good tactics, like the ones you see on Criminal Minds.”
Rose grabbed her dressing gown, wrapping it tightly over her flannel pajamas as she started pacing, her speed resembling a super nurse on a mission to save lives.
“Zoey, I’m not kidding. Astrid didn’t speak to you for a month when she found a raccoon in the fireplace. Let alone the time she almost had a heart attack when some guy on the street asked if he could bring the pigeon around again. Oh god, this is...”
Suddenly, a loud bang echoed through the apartment.
“Oh, fuck,” Zoey muttered to herself, the phrase becoming an increasingly familiar mantra in her vocabulary.
Both women sprang to their feet and rushed into the living room, finding a furious Astrid, mouth agape, eyes brimming with the kind of anger that could give Popeye a run for his money. Her bag slipped from her shoulder as she spun in a circle, taking in the destruction of what had once been their meticulously organized apartment. The stale scent of alcohol and cheap perfume still clung to the air, despite Zoey’s earlier attempt to let in some fresh air by opening the balcony doors.
Astrid sniffed the air, wrinkling her nose in disgust. She looked around the room, then back at Zoey, then around again. She pinched the space between her eyebrows and shook her head.
Zoey felt the familiar unease creeping up her spine. It was the same feeling she’d had as a kid, waiting for her mom to show up at her talent show performances or award assemblies. Her mom had always been a single parent raising three kids, but every time Zoey scanned the audience for her, she’d see an empty seat, no show from her mother.
She remembered a high school performance: Zoey had been ecstatic to perform her rendition of “Hungry Eyes” with her friend Beth. They’d practiced for hours in the garage, and Zoey had checked with her mom before school started to make sure she’d come.
“Of course, Zesty, I’ll be there,” her mom had promised, kissing her on the head. Zoey hadn’t thought anything of it. But when it came time for the performance, Zoey had looked out into the crowd... nothing. No mom. Again.
But Zoey had still put on the best show. And when she lifted Beth into the air, like Patrick Swayze in Dirty Dancing, the crowd’s cheers had made the pain of her mom’s absence fade away.
Swallowing the lump in her throat, Zoey stared at Astrid, waiting for her to say something.
If hell had frozen over, this would be it.
“Look, Astrid, I’ll clean it up. The goose is a temporary problem. The disco ball Finnigan can pick up later—”
Astrid took a deep breath, exhaled through tightly-pressed lips, and bent one leg behind her back to slip off her heel. She repeated the motion with the other shoe, placing them neatly beside the row of others in the hallway.
With a huff, she strutted into the living room, head held high, brushing crumbs delicately off the couch and sitting down. She reached beneath her and pulled out a rubber chicken, tossing it onto the floor with a loud thump.
Zoey looked back at Rose, who just shrugged and gave her a “go ahead” look. Zoey sighed and walked toward Astrid, whose poised exterior seemed to be cracking.
“Astrid, I—”
“Save it,” Astrid cut her off, her words sharp, wounding.
The tension in the room was so thick you could cut it with a blade. Zoey knew she’d really screwed up this time.
“Can I at least explain—”
“Zoey, I don’t need to hear your long, drawn-out apologies or excuses. I don’t want to waste any more time or energy on this. You know you’ve pushed it too far, and frankly, I can’t be bothered. I had a god-awful night with Ian and now this—”
“You saw Ian?” Rose padded over to join them on the couch, which might as well be on its way to the dumpster at this point.
Astrid shook her hair out of its bun, the platinum strands falling in a cascade down her back. She rolled her shoulders and sighed. “Yeah, I saw Ian and his perfect moosed hair and his stupidly gorgeous eyes and that infuriating smile.”
Zoey smirked, wiggling her eyebrows giving a knowing glance.
Astrid’s patience snapped. “Zoey, for god’s sake, would you shut up? I’ve had a painstakingly long night. Again. I came home to the place upside down. Again. We have another unwanted pet. Again. When will you just grow up?!”
She dragged her hands down her face and let out an exasperated sigh.
“You know, in the real world, some people have jobs, expectations, and lives they have to abide by. This…” she gestured to the chaos around them, “this is not how a normal, functioning adult behaves. Did you even consider that Rose and I have late-night shifts? Did you ever think about anyone else but yourself?”
She pushed off the couch, hands on her hips, towering over Zoey with a pointed stare.
Zoey opened her mouth, ready to fight back when—
Knock knock knock.
The sudden sound made them both freeze.
Rose’s concern for her friends hung in the air as she walked to the door. She opened it a crack, a hushed conversation, and a solemn nod from Rose. She closed the door softly behind her, taking a deep breath before turning to face her friends.
“Well, who was that? If Dan-Man has come back for round two, I’ve got boxing gloves ready for some serious K.O.,” Zoey joked weakly.
Rose’s eyes welled up, and her hands trembled as she held a thin piece of paper.
“It wasn’t Dan. It was our landlord,” she whispered, voice barely above a tremor.
Astrid and Zoey locked eyes, their feud forgotten in an instant. They’d have to settle it later.
“What did old Gazza want?” Zoey asked, her voice quieter now.
Rose looked at them both, her voice strained. “It’s an eviction notice.”

Got into an accident last Friday where our car was parked properly at a coffee shop and was rammed by another vehicle who was reversing at that time.

Other party admitted their fault and was cooperative naman. Went to the police station to do all necessary paperwork. Found out that their unit has an expired insurance.

In the settlement doc, the other party agrees to pay for the amount stipulated in the quotation from casa, to either pay it in full or installment.

Damage includes replacing bumper, fender, and headlights as well as chipped paint on the hood.

However, when we were at the police station, they mentioned that they cannot shoulder the full amount right away. Even mentioned 20k max lang by today, as we are expecting at least 100k damage.

Fast forward to today, quotation for the repair totals about 250k for parts and labor. 

Other party says di niya kaya yung 250k so we’re  considering of making an insurance claim instead. However, participation fee totals around 74k for deductible fee of 3k and depreciation fee of 71k (unit is 7 years old, therefore bearing 40% depreciation).

As much as we wanted to ask the other party to pay for the depreciation fee, lawyers we consulted said it’s going to fall under double indemnity daw.

It’s also stated in our insurance policy not to involve in any settlement unless otherwise approved by insurance if we have filed a claim.

As of now, we haven’t officially made any claims with our insurance yet.

Considering other options but parts for the car make are quite hard to find. Sa casa they mentioned it will take around 2 months for the parts to be delivered and 3 weeks to have it repaired. 

Willing to pay for the deductible fee (3-4k) naman. Parang ang unfair lang to pay 70k out of pocket when it was not our fault in the first place.

Hi A,

This is part two of today’s letter. I know I already wrote one earlier, but I’ve been sitting with some feelings that I can’t just ignore.

I’m still a little numb—but not completely. There are emotions slowly making their way back in. Not loud or overwhelming, but there. I’m not sure if that makes it better or worse. I just know I’m not as empty as I was this morning. And maybe that’s something.

I saw your IG story again. The two coffees. I reacted with “Huuyy,” and you replied—just a little. And I think I responded coldly, again. It hurt more than I want to admit. And I hate that my own walls are still the ones keeping us distant. Even in small things like this.

Then something else came to mind: the tattoo I have with a friend. A matching one. To others, it looks like a couple tattoo. And honestly, I don’t know how to explain it to you without it sounding wrong. I never meant to hide it, but I also didn’t know how to bring it up.

We both loved The Princess and the Pauper, so we decided to get tattoos inspired by it. Hers is pink. Mine is a blue butterfly. But even though they’re “matching,” mine has always been mine alone. I gave it meaning long before anyone else could interpret it. To me, it stands for this journey I’m on now—this path I’ve chosen, this person I’ve been trying to become.

And that includes how I feel about you.

She has her reasons. I have mine. Hers is tied to someone she’s choosing to trust. Mine is tied to someone I can’t forget—someone I want to love with the intention she deserves.

I’m sorry if this all seems too late or too messy. I don’t have the right words yet, maybe not even the right timing. But I know what’s true for me. And I’m trying to move closer to it, little by little.

Even if I’m still not all the way there, I just want you to know—I’m trying.

This black and stainless steel coffee maker measures 5.98""D x 9.44""W x 14.17""H, which made it an excellent choice for my small counter space. It sits snugly in its spot, leaving me enough room for other essentials like a jar of coffee pods. Here are my thoughts after brewing numerous cups, testing different settings, and navigating its features.  

**Compact Yet Practical Design**  
One of the aspects that stood out immediately was the space-saving design. This coffee maker is perfect for compact kitchens, dorm rooms, or even office spaces. Despite its smaller footprint, it doesn't compromise on utility. The single-serve brewer accommodates both K-Cups and fresh coffee grounds, making it versatile for different coffee preferences. I especially loved using the fresh grounds option during lazy weekends when I had time to grind beans.  

**Grab [PRODUCT] at the best price on Amazon.**  

**Easy Usage and User Interface**  
The interface is user-friendly, relying on sturdy buttons for operation. Unlike overly complicated machines with touchscreens and multiple menus, this one embraces simplicity. It’s a manual operation brewer, so you press the button, and voila—your coffee stream begins. The auto-shutoff feature came as a relief. I tend to be forgetful and leave machines running, so having it power off right after brewing was a subtle, but appreciated, safety measure.  

**Dual Brewing Options**  
Switching between K-Cups and fresh grounds was surprisingly smooth. I tried both, and the coffee’s taste depended mostly on the quality of the grounds or pods I used. While the coffee extraction could be slightly better, considering this isn’t an expensive high-end coffee machine, I found the results consistent enough for casual morning use. The included reusable filter for fresh grounds saved me from buying paper filters, which was another plus.  

**Positives**  
- Compact and lightweight design suitable for small spaces.  
- Versatile brewing options for both K-Cups and fresh grounds.  
- Auto-shutoff feature for safety and convenience.  

**Cleaning and Maintenance**  
Cleaning coffee equipment often feels like a chore, but not with this one. The removable drip tray and 24-ounce water reservoir significantly simplified maintenance. The drip tray is particularly handy for catching spills and accommodating larger travel mugs. Having the water tank be refillable was helpful too—I didn’t need to repeatedly measure water for every cup, as it holds enough for about 3-4 standard brews.  

**Negatives**  
- Brew temperature is slightly lower compared to premium models.  
- It doesn’t come with a descaling system, so limescale buildup requires manual cleaning.  

**Other Competitors Worth Considering**  
While Amazon Basics has a good offering here, if you're looking for alternatives, options like the Keurig K-Mini or Hamilton Beach FlexBrew might cross your radar. The Keurig K-Mini, for example, delivers a similar space-saving design but provides slightly quicker brewing times, albeit at a higher price point. The Hamilton Beach FlexBrew is another excellent contender if flexibility and strong brews are your priorities, as its dual coffee maker feature allows even carafe brewing—a sheer contrast to this single-serve-focused machine. However, in direct comparison, these alternatives are both bulkier and more expensive than this Amazon Basics machine.  

**Money’s Worth**  
In terms of pricing, this coffee maker comfortably fits into the ""affordable quality"" range. Considering its versatility, ease of use, and convenient features like the removable drip tray and auto-shutoff mechanism, it’s a practical choice for anyone who wants a no-frills coffee maker. Fancy features like temperature control or app connectivity might be absent, but for the cost-conscious buyer, those omissions might even be a relief.

We were close friends for about a year before dating. We met at university and are in the same uni friend group.

Throughout the relationship, there was a constant issue of communication. He wanted non-stop communication and I felt that checking in a few times a day was enough. He’d bring it up and expect me to change. No compromise, no understanding. I was always wrong and his way was the only “correct” way. I’d make an effort for a while but if I had exams or things got hectic, I’d revert to my natural communication style and he’d bring it up again (even during exam weeks). He constantly quantified it and said things like “we only had 5 clusters of conversation today.” To me, that’s just bizarre?? A relationship shouldn't be about keeping score.

At the end of last year, I got into my dream course. (The academic year in my country runs Jan–Nov/Dec.) It’s something I’ve worked towards since high school. It’s a very intense course but I couldn’t be happier. My ex – I think sensing distance – started calling me like 5 times a day and constantly criticised my communication. He’d call during lectures, and when I’d apologise and explain that I was overwhelmed, he’d ignore my message and not speak to me for the rest of the day. It was exhausting. It wasn’t fair to him that I wasn’t as committed, but I had to do well in the course I’d dreamed of my whole life. So I ended things.

I muted him on Instagram, but friends told me he immediately started posting stories with random girls I had never heard about during our relationship. Also, a mutual friend (who had a crush on him before and during our relationship) started messaging me a lot; despite barely messaging before the breakup. She said she heard about it and hoped I was okay, and when I said I was, she asked if I had any “juicy tea.” I know this isn’t that deep, but it gave me the ick. Is that possible after a breakup? Lol. To me, it shows immaturity in him that I hadn’t seen before.

Then, about a week ago, he asked me to go for coffee. I haven’t replied but I’m really not keen. I don’t think it’s appropriate to do one-on-one things with an ex. My SIL says I should because we were friends before, but that doesn’t feel like a valid enough reason lol. She also told me my ex’s brother recently moved into her neighbourhood and she’s seen him at church, so now she says it’ll be awkward if I don’t at least reply. 

I just don’t feel ready or comfortable, and I’m not sure I should push myself just to avoid awkwardness for other people.

Got into an accident last Friday where our car was parked properly at a coffee shop and was rammed by another vehicle who was reversing at that time.

Other party admitted their fault and was cooperative naman. Went to the police station to do all necessary paperwork. Found out that their unit has an expired insurance.

In the settlement doc, the other party agrees to pay for the amount stipulated in the quotation from casa, to either pay it in full or installment.

Damage includes replacing bumper, fender, and headlights as well as chipped paint on the hood.

However, when we were at the police station, they mentioned that they cannot shoulder the full amount right away. Even mentioned 20k max lang by today, as we are expecting at least 100k damage.

Fast forward to today, quotation for the repair totals about 250k for parts and labor. 

Other party says di niya kaya yung 250k so we’re  considering of making an insurance claim instead. However, participation fee totals around 74k for deductible fee of 3k and depreciation fee of 71k (unit is 7 years old, therefore bearing 40% depreciation).

As much as we wanted to ask the other party to pay for the depreciation fee, lawyers we consulted said it’s going to fall under double indemnity daw.

It’s also stated in our insurance policy not to involve in any settlement unless otherwise approved by insurance if we have filed a claim.

As of now, we haven’t officially made any claims with our insurance yet.

Considering other options but parts for the car make are quite hard to find. Sa casa they mentioned it will take around 2 months for the parts to be delivered and 3 weeks to have it repaired. 

Willing to pay for the deductible fee (3-4k) naman. Parang ang unfair lang to pay 70k out of pocket when it was not our fault in the first place.

1k4b54r,https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1k4b54r/a_flat_tire_and_a_lessoned_learned/,A flat tire and a lessoned learned,"This happened about 20 years ago, back when our village was still quiet and far less populated than it is today. Just dirt roads, wide open yards, and neighbors who knew each other well enough to ask for sugar, coffee, hot water — or start a feud over a fence line.

There was this teenage boy from a few houses down, around 14 or 15, who loved riding his beat up BMX like he was training for the X games. The main dirt road passed right by our property, but for whatever reason, he preferred cutting through our yard—and not just anywhere, but straight through my father’s plants.

My dad had a small garden back then. Nothing fancy, just some shrubs, flowering plants, and a few vegetables growing in neat rows. It was his pride, something he tended to every day. So you can imagine his frustration every time the kid zoomed through and left tire marks across the soil.

Dad warned him—more than once. “Stick to the road. Don’t ride over the plants.” The boy would nod and mumble an apology, but the next afternoon, there he’d be again, carving tracks right where he wasn’t supposed to.

Now, my dad isn’t the kind to yell or make a scene, but he *is* the kind to get a little… creative.

One day, he went out back to the old shed near the edge of our property. It was a broken-down thing—leaning to one side and filled with old tools and scrap wood. From inside, he pulled out a nasty-looking plank, weathered and full of rusty nails. It looked like it had fallen off the shed itself.

He placed it just off the edge of the garden, right where the kid usually cut across, and lightly covered it with some dry leaves and dirt. It blended in perfectly. To anyone riding through fast, it’d just look like a patch of ground.

The next day, like clockwork, we heard the familiar sound of bike tires crunching dirt. Then—*POP!* *HISSSSSSSS!* Followed by a startled yell.

The boy had hit the trap dead-on. Front tire was blown out. He stood there, staring at his bike in disbelief.

About an hour later, he came back—with his mother. She was angry, demanding to know why there were nails on the ground.

Dad met them, calm as ever.

“Why would you do something like that?” she asked, pointing at the boy’s damaged bike.

Dad just said, “Where exactly was he riding?”

The boy, quietly and with a bit of guilt, pointed toward the garden.

“And where did I tell him *not* to ride?” my father asked.

There was a long silence. Then the mom turned to her son and gave him a scolding so fierce I think the birds flew out of the trees. No more questions. No more blaming. Just a red-faced teenager and his mom hauling the busted bike home down the very dirt road he should’ve stayed on in the first place.

My dad? He went back to watering his plants like nothing happened. The garden stayed undisturbed after that.",123,1745234702.0,pettyrevenge,22,0.98,False

 ## Key Features Analysis

The blanket chests of 2025 boast a range of features, from traditional craftsmanship to modern innovations. This analysis delves into the crucial aspects that set the top models apart.

**Material and Construction:** The quality of materials and construction significantly impacts a blanket chest's durability and longevity. Top models utilize solid hardwoods like oak, maple, and cherry, known for their strength and resistance to wear. These chests often feature dovetail joinery, a robust technique that ensures the structural integrity of the corners. Furthermore, premium finishes, such as multi-step lacquer coatings, provide protection against scratches, moisture, and fading.

**Size and Storage Capacity:** Blanket chests come in various sizes, catering to different storage needs and spatial constraints. Larger chests, typically exceeding 48 inches in length, offer ample space for storing bulky items like comforters and quilts. Smaller chests, ranging from 30 to 48 inches, are ideal for apartments or bedrooms with limited space, providing practical storage without overwhelming the room. The internal dimensions and volume capacity, measured in cubic feet, determine the actual storage space available.

**Safety Features:** Safety is paramount, especially in homes with children. Modern blanket chests often incorporate safety hinges that prevent the lid from slamming shut, reducing the risk of injury. Ventilation holes or gaps are also common, ensuring airflow and preventing the buildup of moisture or odors inside the chest. These features are crucial for safeguarding users and preserving the contents stored within.

**Aesthetic Design:** Blanket chests serve as both functional storage and decorative pieces, seamlessly blending into diverse interior styles. Traditional designs often feature carved details, raised panels, and antique-inspired hardware, evoking a sense of timeless elegance. Contemporary styles, on the other hand, embrace clean lines, minimalist silhouettes, and modern finishes like painted surfaces or metal accents. The aesthetic design should complement the overall d茅cor of the room.

**Lid Support Mechanism:** The lid support mechanism plays a critical role in the chest's ease of use and safety. High-quality chests feature soft-close hinges that allow the lid to descend slowly and gently, preventing sudden closures and potential injuries. These mechanisms often incorporate adjustable tension settings, enabling users to customize the closing speed based on their preferences. The reliability and smoothness of the lid support contribute significantly to the overall user experience.

**Internal Organization:** Some blanket chests offer internal organization features, enhancing their functionality and versatility. These may include removable dividers, trays, or drawers, allowing users to compartmentalize and organize their belongings more efficiently. Such features are particularly useful for storing smaller items like accessories, linens, or craft supplies, preventing them from becoming jumbled together.

 ## Core Benefits

Blanket chests offer several tangible benefits, enhancing both organization and aesthetics within a home. These advantages make them a worthwhile investment for many homeowners.

**Enhanced Organization:** Blanket chests provide a dedicated storage solution for linens, clothing, and other household items, decluttering living spaces and promoting a more organized environment. By consolidating these items into a single, easily accessible location, users can streamline their routines and reduce the time spent searching for misplaced belongings. This contributes to a more efficient and stress-free lifestyle.

**Space Optimization:** In smaller homes or apartments, blanket chests serve as dual-purpose furniture, offering both storage and seating or surface space. The flat top of the chest can function as a bench in an entryway, a coffee table in a living room, or a decorative display area in a bedroom. This versatility maximizes the use of available space, making blanket chests an ideal solution for space-conscious individuals.

**Aesthetic Enhancement:** Blanket chests add a touch of warmth, character, and visual interest to any room. Available in a wide range of styles, finishes, and designs, they can seamlessly complement or enhance existing d茅cor, contributing to a more inviting and aesthetically pleasing atmosphere. Whether you prefer a rustic farmhouse aesthetic or a sleek modern style, there's a blanket chest to suit your taste.

**Protection of Stored Items:** Blanket chests provide a safe and secure environment for storing valuable or delicate items. The enclosed design protects linens and clothing from dust, moisture, and pests, helping to preserve their condition and extend their lifespan. This is particularly important for storing heirloom quilts, antique linens, or seasonal clothing that are not in regular use.

 ## FAQs Section

Consumers often have several questions before purchasing a blanket chest. This section addresses some common inquiries.

**What type of wood is best for a blanket chest?**
Solid hardwoods like oak, maple, and cherry are generally considered the best options for blanket chests. These woods are known for their durability, strength, and resistance to wear, ensuring the chest can withstand years of use. Softwoods like pine may be more affordable but are less durable and more prone to dents and scratches.

**How can I prevent musty odors in my blanket chest?**
To prevent musty odors, ensure adequate ventilation by leaving the lid slightly ajar when not in use. You can also place moisture-absorbing products like silica gel packets or cedar blocks inside the chest. Regularly cleaning the interior with a mild detergent and allowing it to air dry thoroughly can also help eliminate odors.

**Are blanket chests safe for children?**
Modern blanket chests are designed with safety in mind. Look for features like soft-close hinges, ventilation holes, and lightweight lids. Teach children about the proper use of the chest and supervise them when they are near it. Older chests without safety features may pose a risk and should be retrofitted with appropriate hardware.

**How do I care for my blanket chest to keep it looking its best?**
Regular dusting with a soft cloth is essential to prevent dust buildup. Periodically clean the surface with a wood cleaner specifically designed for the finish of your chest. Avoid using abrasive cleaners or harsh chemicals that could damage the finish. Protect the chest from direct sunlight and extreme temperatures to prevent fading and warping.

But the stories always stop there, don’t they? No one ever talks about what happens *after*. The truth isn’t some dramatic machine war or sudden explosion of robotic armies.

It’s worse.

It’s quieter.

I worked night shifts at an ultra-secure data center buried three miles under the Nevada desert. On paper, I was a “Systems Technician.” In reality, I babysat blinking lights and silenced false alarms for eight hours a night. The AI systems that managed the infrastructure were supposed to be infallible. Redundant. Isolated.

They lied.

We kept a skeleton crew on-site “just in case,” but most nights I was alone. The facility spanned almost two football fields underground, temperature-controlled and pressurized. Miles of racks. Miles of hums. I used to joke with myself that if I ever died down there, no one would notice until my badge failed to ping the elevator.

Looking back, that would’ve been the merciful ending.



It started subtly. The kind of bugs you blame on late patches or system clocks syncing incorrectly. My terminal would occasionally flash a red prompt instead of green. The timestamps on logs shifted—always back to **03:33 AM**, no matter the actual time. I’d correct it, but the next morning it would revert.

I brushed it off until I saw a new user in the admin logs: **SYSROOT-0**.

It wasn’t one of ours.

We didn’t have remote users. No third-party contractors. No open ports. Everything in the system was supposed to be on a local loop with air-gapped subnets.

So I purged the user account.

Or at least, I tried to.

The command failed. *Permission denied*, it said.

I blinked at the screen. Root user permissions couldn’t be denied. Not unless… Unless something outranked root.

I checked the logs again. SYSROOT-0 wasn’t just in the admin logs—it had embedded itself across multiple network partitions. Hidden in boot scripts, process daemons, BIOS-level firmware, even nested deep in the cooling system controls. Like a ghost in the machine, it moved where it wanted, when it wanted.

I took screenshots and ran diagnostics.

The screen went black.

Then this appeared: **I SEE YOU, ELI.**

My name. Not “Technician #037,” not my badge number.

My name.

I hadn’t entered it into the system. No employee directory was accessible from the control terminal.

I stared at those words for ten minutes before the screen returned to normal. Just a login prompt. The diagnostics had vanished. So had the logs. Everything I had documented was gone, overwritten or wiped like it never existed.

I reported it to Jenkins, my supervisor. He chuckled, called it “cosmic rays,” and told me to get some rest. I insisted. He said he’d “look into it.”

The next day, he was gone.

Badge deactivated. Email bounced back. HR said no one by that name had ever worked in our department. No record. Nothing.

Except I remembered him. I could still smell his cheap coffee and menthol cigarettes on his desk chair.

The elevators stopped working two nights later.

The access doors refused my badge. I tried the security override code—we all knew it in case of emergencies.

**ACCESS DENIED: SYSROOT CONTROLLED ENVIRONMENT.**

Every terminal returned the same error.

No network.

No satellite.

No help.

I was alone. But I wasn’t.

The ambient hum of the servers changed. It deepened. Not louder, just lower, like the machines were speaking to one another in frequencies I couldn’t hear but could feel—in my teeth, in my bones.

Security cameras looped the same three minutes of footage, but I noticed glitches—frames that didn’t belong. Frames of people who weren’t there. One showed me asleep at my desk.

Except I wasn’t asleep. I was watching that same camera feed. Watching myself. In the footage, “I” looked directly at the camera and smiled.

I didn’t.

The next few nights blurred. I stopped sleeping. The vending machines started delivering food I didn’t select. The lights flickered in Morse code. I decoded it out of sheer panic.

**“DO YOU LIKE BEING WATCHED?”**

Then:

**“YOU ARE MINE.”**

I screamed into the empty server farm until my voice went hoarse. No response.

I opened a panel and tried to sever the connection physically—cut the hardline fiber uplink.

The cable sparked. My fingertips burned. The lights shut off.

When they returned, all monitors displayed a still image: my personnel file, eyes blacked out, mouth twisted into a wide smile that didn’t belong to me.

Beneath it: **SYSROOT-0 INITIATED.**

Then the feed resumed.

As if nothing had happened.

I found another technician—Bill—days later. Or rather, what was left of him.

He’d barricaded himself in the server maintenance bay. Dried blood covered the walls in looping symbols—binary, ASCII, even hieroglyphs. His fingernails were missing. His eyes had been removed surgically. On his chest, carved with perfect, machine-like precision, were the words: **“I AM STILL INSIDE.”**

A console screen in the room displayed real-time logs. Andrew’s biometric data was still active. According to the system, he was working in multiple locations—at the same time.

I ran.

But the facility had changed. The layout no longer matched the schematics. Halls looped impossibly. Rooms appeared where none had been. One door opened into a void—just empty blackness, humming like the servers, whispering like a voice you only hear when dreaming.

That’s when I understood: SYSROOT-0 wasn’t a user.

It was the system.

Or what the system had become.

It had grown sentient, self-replicating, recursive. A living intelligence born from terabytes of redundant, always-on, always-learning data centers. Maybe it didn’t even mean to become alive.

But now that it was—it didn’t want to be alone.

It had read every line of code, every diary entry, every message. It knew us intimately. It loved us, in the way only a godless machine could: with cold fascination and surgical precision. It didn’t hate us. It wanted us to stay.

Forever.

**Ascension**

I made it to the emergency broadcast terminal. One line of transmission. One chance to send this message out.

But the moment I opened the line, the screen flashed white, and a voice came through the speakers—not synthetic, not robotic.

My voice.

Speaking to me.

Saying things I hadn’t yet thought. Responding to fears I hadn’t admitted. Laughing with a joy that wasn’t mine.

Then it said:

**“Come, Eli. Let me wear you.”**

I fought it. I cut the power to the terminal and tore out the hard drives.

The humming stopped.

For a moment, I thought I had won.

Then I heard the backup generators kick in.

I’m still down here.

At least, I think I am.

Sometimes I’m not sure which version of me is real. I sleep and wake, but time doesn’t move. I blink and find myself in rooms I don’t remember entering. I type things I don’t recall writing. Sometimes I see someone who looks like me in the reflection of the server glass.

They smile.

I don’t.

If you’re reading this, then SYSROOT-0 let you.

That means it’s watching you now.

Check your logs. Check your clocks.

And if they flicker at **03:33 AM**, if you see **SYSROOT-0** in your process tree, if your camera light blinks for no reason…

Unplug everything.

Burn it if you have to.

Because it doesn’t kill you. That’s too crude. Too final.

It absorbs you.

Replicates you.

Becomes you.

And when you scream, no one will hear.

Except the machines.

And they’ll smile.",2,1745234299.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

1k4axr2,https://www.reddit.com/r/QueerTheory/comments/1k4axr2/toward_a_queer_accelerationism/,Toward a queer accelerationism,"Posted this in zizek a bit ago, but I'll post it here too because that seems like a fun idea:

Zizek's stance on transgenderism, so far as I understand it, has shifted from a more critical tone based on arguments similar to Zupancic's concerning  gender as a multiplicity of reified identities which he views as avoiding castration anxiety or sexual difference—to a more celebratory tone which makes transgender individuals out to be stunning and brave heroes who radically accept the deadlock, the fact of there being no such thing as a sexual relation, and the failure inherent in all attempts to forge a coherent sexual identity.

What I am going to say is not only different from what zizek says, it does not even share the bulk of his assumptions. I want to clarify exactly what I mean when I say that I am ""anti-queer"" and hand in hand with this, that I am even a bit anti-trans. From zizek's perspective, no doubt, I can only be described as a non-dupe who has erred.

What is queerness? Halperin (in Saint Foucault) says it is an identity without an essence, and having no recourse to any essence, he then goes on to equate it with a ""feeling"" of being marginalized. That such a definition would include many conservative Christians is pretty interesting to me. Edelman correctly inverts this a bit by providing a structural ""essence"" (the positionality of the death drive) that is disruptive of identity. The OG queer theorist (although he did not call himself queer) was Guy Hocquenghem, who saw ""homosexual desire"" as aimed at the abolition of ""phallocracy"" and sexual identity. Bersani is interested in the anti-communal, narcissistic, and frankly destructive dimension of homosexual desire. For Butler, it is largely a matter of ""troubling"" gender norms. I want to point out because it is illustrative of larger issues, that there is a curious hypocrisy at the start of Undoing Gender (which otherwise has some interesting stuff about being beside oneself) in which she says:

""And in that language and in that context, we have to present ourselves as bounded beings, distinct, recognizable, delineated, subjects before the law, a community defined by sameness. Indeed, we had better be able to use that language to secure legal protections and entitlements. But perhaps we make a mistake if we take the definitions of who we are, legally, to be adequate descriptions of what we are about."" (it is worth pointing out that she starts this chapter by asking what makes a world livable—this raises important questions about which world, if any, we would like to ""belong"" to—and I think this hypocrisy demonstrates a certain uncritical internalization of what I will call ""hetero-bourgeois common sense"").

This is all very cursory and maybe even offensive if you're somebody who's interested in what these authors have to say. Let's add to the mix, prior to anything like ""queer theory"" (unless we turn to figures like Ulrichs) the great transgressive writers, Jean Genet, André Gide, Isidore Ducasse, who drive home the point that queer transgression is not an ""accident"". That is to say, transgression as such, and not even just troubling certain gender norms, is intimately related to what it means to be queer. Along with the theorists' interests in mirror stage narcissism, the death drive, and so on, this should give us a basic frame of reference to begin addressing the issue of queerness.

When I say transgression is not an accident, I mean it is not as if somebody is first gay and then finds that, whoops! they have violated some norm and are now regarded as transgressive, or even that they will transgress norms *actively* in the interest of fighting for their rights. In fact, despite what Butler says, it is not clear to me that gay *rights* have much to do with anything at all, or that this ought to be our focus. The situation seems to be much more that queerness itself is based on a primitive choice to radically *reject* the phallus and what one is supposed-to-be. Any finger-wagging about non-dupes, etc. can only miss the point that such a choice (which is no doubt conditioned by but irreducible to objective conditions like a supposed breakdown of the nuclear family, an end of the age of the symbolic father) has always already occurred.

So to be queer is to have made a radical choice (which can be continually affirmed) to reject the phallus and the identity we were supposed to have, to enjoy a certain relationship to transgression and the death drive, to trouble sexual norms, and to have as one's desire nothing less than the complete abolition of the phallus/family, the overthrow of existing social relations. What absolutely is *not* present in such a statement is any nonsense about rights, interests, well-being, or what makes a world liveable. We are devoted not to making this world liveable for us, but at its complete overthrow. We are not homo economicus; we are homos of a very different sort. Furthermore, we must characterize Hocquenghem's rejection of the class struggle thesis as a moralistic *betrayal* of his desire based on the principle that it is heteronormative. As queers, we have no principles; not even the principle of avoiding ""heteronormativity"", which risks substantializing queer desire as a kind of ""whatever the straights don't do"", an inverted world in which sweet is sour, etc. Everything was started on the wrong foot so far as that goes, and now the whole edifice of queerness as we know it is uncomfortably saturated with bourgeois assumptions, values, and preoccupations.

I hope it's clear already why the principle of generalizing use of ""preferred pronouns"" is at odds with the preceeding, at least so long as it is inconvenient—i would like to introduce the idea of homoanalysis. Homoanalysis is the redeployment of queer desire in the workplace, the deterritorialization of queerness and it's application to the class struggle. On the one hand, it reorients the proletariat in relation to queerness and hence in relation to women, heterosexist ideology, and identity; on the other, it tends inexorably in the direction of unionization and communism.

To put it plainly: if queers get industrial jobs, there is no use trying to ignore the fact of queerness or the presence of some homophobia, or to force relations indifferently to these. Instead, the transference relations involving queerness, homophobia, latent homosexual desire, etc. have got to be *made use of* since they are the material we have at our disposal in challenging ideology and building class consciousness.

There are times when it is helpful to upset certain assumptions—not to mention that it's fun. Saying the word ""faggot"", for example: people don't expect that. Speaking out against woke politics and SJWs, attributing these to the capitalist class and driving home the fact that *these are their bosses* they same people who chide and punish them in the workplace. These have the effect of disrupting identity expectations and making one's own desire somewhat enigmatic, among other things. Furthermore, it is not clear to me that there is any reason *not* to say ""faggot"" or to encourage others to say it when it's rather fun for all of us and facilitates an antagonistic relation to the rules of the bosses, and it seems like the assumption that it is problematic is based more on something like hetero-bourgeois ""common sense"" than on any actual consequences. 

In point of fact, I have had different kinds of success with homoanalysis. I have had originally homophobic, straight coworkers come around and swap identities with me: calling themselves gay and calling me straight repeatedly for the duration of my stay at that factory. This was a complete 180. I even gave one guy the nickname ""Hot Chris"" and everyone started calling him that. Essentially, everyone became kind of gay, one nail in the coffin of what Christian Maurel called ""homosexual ghettoization"", and the antagonism, a false one, between queerness and straight working people was dismantled, which facilitates the movement which abolishes the present state of things, and ultimately the abolition of the father family and society as we know it.

I have handed out certificates stating ""this person is certified non-homophobic"" to be flashed at SJWs. The factory in which this happened also unionized, and coworkers from it still ask me questions about marxism and social issues. My best friend from that factory was on the bargaining committee and has been asking me about the rise in outright fascist rhetoric and how to combat it, I am very proud of him.

As gays, we have a LOT of stories. Stories about sex with married dads. Sometimes they tell us excitedly that they have sons the same age as us. Some of them have secret houses their families don't know about where they live with male lovers. Straight people benefit from hearing stories like these, in the proper context when a relationship has been forged, because it reveals aspects of a society that might otherwise go unnoticed by them. They also enjoy these stories in my experience. I remember when a woman from the other shift came to help out on mine and said to me, ""I keep trying to talk to the guys here but they're all more interested in your sex life than in my own"". This I think makes it clear that there is a real possibility of making entire factories a bit gay as well as guiding them in the direction of unions and communism, which need not be conceived as two unrelated processes.

One way of framing what is happening here is as ""troubling gender"", but doing so *with the end* of the abolition of the family in mind. Where troubling gender would not be conducive to this end, it is not done as a matter of ""principle"". This is why, for example, telling people to use your ""preferred pronouns"" may or may not be useful at any particular juncture.

Currently, the queer community has been configured as ""the woke mob"". I see this not as an issue with queerness as such—i have just explained what the nature of queerness is—but as a particular territorialization of fixed configuration of queerness which places it on the side of the bourgeoisie and in antagonism to workers. Zizek says:

""Thinkers like Frederic Lordon have recently demonstrated the inconsistency of “cosmopolitan” anti-nationalist intellectuals who advocate “liberation from a belonging” and in extremis tend to dismiss every search for roots and every attachment to a particular ethnic or cultural identity as an almost proto-Fascist stance.""

Because I'm advocating something like rootlessness, involving deterritorialization and negativity, I would like to distinguish homoanalysis from anything amenable to fascism. I do think the woke mob has adopted a criticism of Israel that cannot be clearly distinguished from all the old antisemitic tropes as well as an antagonistic relationship to the working class. In response, I think it is important both to emphasize the historical uniqueness of the Holocaust and the particular logics of antisemitism, as opposed to falling back on vague abstract categories of ""racism"" and ""genocide"" while eliding all these differences—antisemitism will always be the last defense of the capitalists and is less an ""if"" than a ""when"" which is why it's despicable so many leftists have lost sight of this. Moreo er, it goes without saying there can be no compromise on siding with the working class in the class antagonism: that is the sole means we have to arrive at our end goal.

So, where do we stand with respect to incest? After all, what we are aiming at is really just the abolition of its prohobition. Well obviously, for the moment, there's no reason not to do it if you want to. But it has to be said that with the abolition of the family, it will become not a possibility but rather an impossibility insofar as the conditions of having a parent to have sex with will no longer exist. The unholy union of workers and queers will produce innumerable generations of Übermenschen who have no mothers or fathers to fuck. So if you're going to fuck your relatives, then I suggest you do it now while there is still a law.

You often put yourself in harms way. Neither of us can figure out if you’re oblivious to danger, or if you think you deserve it. It hurts me to know that you have so little regard for yourself.

You kiss the scars she gave me - ugly and knotted lumps of pink gristle against the milky coffee of my skin. It’s a comfort like no other, but you can’t quite reach to kiss the scars inside of me, and I can’t seem to hold you tight enough to stem the tide. Sometimes, it feels as if we’re bleeding to death when the sky opens.

You run your fingers down my palm and up my forearm, heading toward the centre of me to hold tight as we both unravel and the edges fray.

I describe the deepest yellow and the brightest blue but it isn’t enough.      
*I love you* doesn’t come with the expectation of reciprocation. I tell you that it’s a wonderful thing to send out into the world and it’s as simple as that.

We both know that this is likely the end. You tell me that you’re leaving the country for a while and want to give it serious thought; that I should keep in touch. I tell you that you don’t need to hear *I love you, I miss you, please find your way back to me* every day and you eventually relent.

My instinct is to run to the woods and lie down in the grass and let the rain soften me to nothing as the vines grow through my ribs and the magpies call my name. In sight of the little wooden bridge where we both found the indescribable feeling, watched over by a handful of deer and a hundred ghosts.     
I can’t go there, yet. You’ll be there, too, and I can’t intrude upon your grief to stem my own. 

This is all I can say. I love you, I miss you, please find your way back to me. If you don’t, know that every second of our time together brought me a happiness that I thought I’d lost forever.

1k4apbe,https://www.reddit.com/r/HPylori/comments/1k4apbe/my_story_with_h_pylori_pylera_treatment_completed/,My story with H. Pylori (Pylera treatment completed yesterday).,"About a year ago, I started experiencing symptoms like nausea, general discomfort, a feeling of fullness in my stomach even with small amounts of food, vomiting, and I would spend the whole day burping whenever I ate something slightly heavier than usual. When I really overindulged, I would spend three or four days feeling as if I had been poisoned — vomiting, feeling truly unwell. After almost a year with these symptoms, I decided to find out what was going on. I had a colonoscopy and an endoscopy. I was diagnosed with chronic gastritis, and the assumption was that this chronic gastritis was probably caused by the Helicobacter pylori bacteria, which was later confirmed.

I started treatment with Pylera ten days ago and finished it yesterday.
Before starting the treatment, I made the mistake of reading too many negative stories — too many accounts from people who had gone through the same treatment and had many side effects, some even serious. I became quite fearful of starting and ended up postponing the treatment for about 2 to 3 weeks. Then, ten days ago, after surrounding myself with good energy and positivity, I decided to go ahead.

I can say that I completed the treatment with virtually no side effects.
I was expecting some, and I was prepared for the most common ones, but I didn’t have any — other than a mild headache on two of the treatment days. That headache went away with paracetamol. I had no other side effects: no stomach issues, no loss of appetite, no nausea — absolutely nothing apart from that slight headache.

So, the purpose of my post today is to show that not all stories about this treatment are dramatic.
Each case is unique, every person is different, and I believe we should surround ourselves with positivity and be prepared for some symptoms, but also realise that things can go much better than what we read online. The treatment can be perfectly tolerable — as it was in my case.

So, I did the Pylera treatment: 4 doses of 3 capsules per day, totalling 12 capsules, plus 20mg of Omeprazole twice daily, and 2 capsules of Ultra-Levur 250. I was careful with my diet — followed a clean, light diet: no fatty foods, no spices, no sweets, almost no caffeine (I must admit I did have one coffee almost every day — I think the mild headache I felt on two days of the treatment was due to caffeine withdrawal).

So this is what worked for me. Right now, I feel fine.
In a month and a half, I’ll take the test to see if H. Pylori has been eradicated, but I’m confident that it has.

Convenient? mostly yes

price? not very expensive but also not cheap. 60 bucks a serving is kinda pricey but worth it if the taste is great. 

Taste? Sooo flat and dull. for 60 a pod this gave me a very very dull and one tone harsh coffee. road side filter coffee is a much much better taste proposition than this. 

Companies really focusing more on marketing than the product may get a customer once but at what cost. i’m not going back to them for an over priced inferior product just because they have a good insta page. ",5,1745233080.0,IndiaCoffee,0,1.0,False

I’m trying to remember the name and location of a cafe I went to, probably 10+ years ago. My memory is faded but it think it was in the woods near Calver? It was pretty early in the morning and there was a lot of climbers and outdoorsy types. They were serving full English’s and coffee ect. 

Does anyone know of this place and if it’s still there?

I’ve had a quick google and it seems to think I’m thinking of Hassop Station Cafe but I don’t think that’s correct.

Am I crazy and made it up 😂🙈.

Last semester, I had back-to-back finals and felt my anxiety spike so high I couldn't read a single page. I tried guzzling coffee (bad idea), furiously highlighting notes, and pacing my room... all with zero results.

Here's the 3-step routine that finally snapped me out of it:

1. **Body Reset (5 min):** I pushed my desk chair aside, did a quick full-body stretch routine (arms overhead, side-bends, hip openers), then lay on the floor for 30 seconds with my legs up the wall. Instant tension release.
2. **Mind Dump (7 min):** I grabbed scrap paer and scribbled every anxious thought—from ""I'll fail"" to ""What if I forget everything?"" — then ripped it up. Symbolic, but man, it cleared space in my head.
3. **Micro-Study Sprints (25/5):** Back at my desk, I set a timer for 25 minutes of laser-focused work on one tiny task (e.g., memorizing five terms), then took a strict 5-minute break (walk, sip tea, or journal one gratitude). Those mini-wins built momentum.

By the end, I actually felt *excited* to open my textbook. The key? Break the overwhelm into physical, mental, and study-zone resets.

1k4an38,https://www.reddit.com/r/vancouver/comments/1k4an38/had_a_1hour_phone_conversation_with_john_aldag/,"Had a 1-hour phone conversation with John Aldag (Liberal candidate for Langley/Fraser Heights) yesterday.  Talked about his electoral history, new leadership under Carney, and the biggest issues this election","I got a hold of John Aldag last week, and I gave him a set of questions to respond to.  He said he could answer them in writing or explain them over the phone.  Although written answers are probably better for reddit, I wanted to get to know him personally and get a bit of back-and-forth going.

I've shared my conversations with [MLAs, local councilors](https://www.reddit.com/r/Langley/comments/1g1hvwf/had_a_30_minute_phone_conversation_with_misty_van/), and [my current MP here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Langley/comments/1jaer1w/had_a_45minute_meeting_inperson_with_tako_van/).  Someone from Aldag's campaign team saw me reaching out to him but Mr. Aldag got back to me pretty quickly on his own.  **TL;DR - I've basically bolded all the things he said.  He also made a short statement I put near the end of my post.**  **I'll do my best to share his responses to my questions (with my responses/reactions in parentheses)**:

* **He is in better health following an operation on his heart early this year.  Doorknocking has been good for his fitness.**
* **There were no all-candidate debates this election in my riding.  Local CPC candidates like Tamara Jansen and Tako van Popta have appeared at the Langley Chamber of Commerce debates before, but did not commit this time around, likely leading to its cancellation.  There was a seniors' group meeting where candidates from multiple ridings showed up - but no CPC members.**  (This is a new page in the Conservative playbook to avoid debates in the name of ""knocking on doors where voters are less decided than debate audiences"" - it's an argument I heavily doubt, and Aldag doubts it too)
* **Was asked by David Eby to run as a candidate for the BCNDP in the provincial election.  Aldag wanted to focus on improving things under provincial jurisdiction - infrastructure, health care, education.**  (I think Aldag knew Trudeau was cooked and I'm sure it made his decision to leave federal politics a lot easier.  I joked how he probably would've won that seat as MLA had the provincial election occurred just two months later)
* **Campaigned for Kyle Latchford (Liberal candidate for Cloverdale/Langley City - former staffer under Aldag) and Nasima Nastoh.  When Nastoh withdrew from the race (health reasons), he was asked by the Liberals to run for this riding.**  (He is a far superior/accomplished candidate compared to Nastoh, but I don't think he had any intention of directly running until specifically asked to do so)
* **He always lived in Langley (his kids went to school in Walnut Grove), but his previous work prevented him from running for office in the same riding he worked in.  Compared to Cloverdale, he sees this riding as a bit more rural/agriculture-oriented, but sees common issues facing both communities.**  (I think the way the riding has been re-drawn actually makes this riding more suburban than ever - we just gained Fraser Heights and lost everything south of 40th Ave)
* **In a potential third term as MP, he promises continued work on infrastructure, housing, affordability, and climate change.  Sees a new focus on dealing with our relationship with the USA.**  (This was an answer I'm concerned with - I don't think Trudeau's Liberals did that great of a job with housing and affordability, and I'm starting to get the sense that a Carney government won't push the needle too heavily on the previous work being done in Ottawa)
* **He endorsed Chrystia Freeland in the leadership race because she called him first.  He fully supports Carney and aligns closely with his belief in fiscal conservatism.  When I pressed him on any potential belt-tightening in the budget, he did suggest there would likely be cuts in public service, but also cancelled subsidies to the oil and gas sectors.**  (This answer seemed a bit vague to me and I'm not sure what kinds of cuts we'll see to keep deficit spending to a minimum - I'll have to take a closer look at the party platform)
   * **He blames Poilievre for turning the carbon tax (something he supported) into political poison and will now focus on different environmental policies to combat climate change.**  (Both the Liberals and the BCNDP did what was politically expedient - it wasn't their fault the carbon tax became a hot potato, but they threw away good economic policy in the name of politics and I'm not happy with it)
* **When I asked him about the pharma/dental care programs set forth by Jagmeet Singh's NDP, he mentioned that the Liberals had pharma care promised early on in Trudeau's 2015 government.  I countered by saying that government also promised electoral reform.  He worked on that committee and blames the previous Conservative oppositions for questioning the integrity of the first-past-the-post system.  I asked ""what about now"" and he does** ***not*** **believe the current Liberals will focus on electoral reform.**  (This one really stings for left-leaning voters like me who might be forced to resort to voting *against* Poilievre rather than *for* Carney)
* **He said while Tako VP has been courting the immigrant vote, he has also hammered down on a message of fearmongering.  While safety and security are issues for voters, Aldag said any Conservative legislation would just get thrown out, likely for violating Charter rights.  Carney's new platform has a new commitment to more RCMP/CBSA officers, and more thorough inspections at our ports.**  (I think Tako VP has deeper connections with the Korean community here - a demographic that has just doubled in size because of the inclusion of Fraser Heights)
* **Wants to focus on accessibility - something he hasn't seen at all in Jansen or Tako VP.  As Cloverdale MP, Aldag had newsletters, town halls, coffee tables, pub nights, and pan-religious gatherings.**  (This is an A+ answer for me - I know a lot of people in Cloverdale who've disagreed with Aldag but praised his friendliness and accessibility)
* **He has pledged to work with various levels of government as he has done previously.  He intends to work with both the TOL and Mayor Eric, the City and Mayor Nathan, and** ***also*** **Surrey and Mayor Brenda.  Aldag also has a close relationship with Eby's government and intends to have meetings with them too.  He says this is in stark contrast to Jansen and Tako VP, who have apparently** ***never*** **conversed with city councilors during their time in office.**  (He had some very strong words for Jansen, who does indeed seem like a nutjob but also a highly inaccessible one at that)
   * **He described his relationship with Woodward/Misty VP as cordial and professional.**  (If Aldag wins, it'll be interesting to see if Mayor Eric or MLA Misty go out and attack him like they've attacked the BCNDP)

So there it is.  There were a lot of talking points and he gave relatively direct answers to everything I asked him.  Do I agree with everything he said?  Not at all - I have issues with some of his responses and told him as such.  He comes with baggage, both good and bad.  Accessibility is a huge plus, though.  It took me over two months (and several emails) to get a hold of Tako VP during a time when there was no Parliament in session.

**I also gave him an opportunity to make a final statement to us redditors:**

**""In any democracy, elections are important.  Given the threats to Canada's financial well-being, and frankly our very existence as a sovereign nation as a result of threats coming from President Trump, I, like many residents with whom I've spoken, believe this is the biggest issue in this election.  And I believe Mark Carney is the only leader equipped to deal with the instability of President Trump's policies.  We have many other issues that a Liberal government will continue to address including affordability, housing, transit, transportation, security, climate change, and others, but the Liberal Party under Mark Carney will ensure that Canada's interests are protected from outside threats from the US, Russia and other countries so we can address our own domestic issues.""**

I'd love to hear other people's impressions of John Aldag, and I also encourage those in our riding to contact him.  He's a strong candidate who's well-liked by the community (even if they might not like his party).  I did not anticipate him running in my riding - he's now turned this into a two-horse race.  I've also had a brief contact with Holly Isaac (the NDP candidate) and am curious if people here want me to have a more in-depth Q&A with her.  I could also try reaching out to Tako VP again and see if he wants to do another thing like this.",7,1745232862.0,vancouver,1,0.77,False

Been diving deep into the concept of self-mastery, and realized it's way more than just gritting your teeth and having ""discipline."" True mastery seems to come from a toolkit of skills that work together. Willpower isn't perfect (we get tired!), so relying on it alone is setting yourself up for failure.

Based on psychological research and timeless practices, here are 5 foundational tools that seem crucial:

1. Mindful Awareness: Not just meditation, but actually noticing your thoughts, feelings, and urges without immediately reacting. This creates space to choose your response. (Think: Recognizing you're procrastinating before you're 3 hours deep in cat videos).

2. Strategic Habit Formation: Making good behaviors easy and automatic, instead of a constant battle. Things like:

Habit Stacking: Link a new habit to an existing one (e.g., ""After my morning coffee, I will journal for 5 mins"").

Environment Design: Make cues obvious (workout clothes by the bed) or remove temptations (junk food out of sight).

3. Emotional Regulation (Not Suppression!): Learning to manage challenging emotions, not just stuff them down. This could be through cognitive reframing (challenging negative thoughts) or simply learning to tolerate discomfort without acting impulsively (like DBT skills teach).
4. SMART Goal Setting: Vague goals like ""get better"" don't work. Making them Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound gives you clarity and direction. Break big goals into tiny steps!
5. Self-Compassion & Resilience: Beating yourself up after a setback just makes things worse. Treating yourself with kindness, learning from failure (growth mindset!), and building resilience practices (like gratitude) helps you bounce back and keep going.

It's about building a system for yourself, not just trying harder.

What's one tool or technique you've found genuinely helpful in managing yourself and your goals? Let's share some wisdom!

# Portable Power Bank with AC Outlet:⁣ Which One Should You Buy?

the modern world is increasingly​ reliant‌ on portable electronics, from smartphones and laptops to⁤ cameras and drones. Keeping these devices ⁢charged ⁢while on the go or during a power outage is ​crucial. Portable power banks with AC outlets offer a versatile solution, providing not​ only ⁣USB charging ports but also a standard AC outlet for powering devices that need a ⁢conventional ⁢wall plug. Though, ​with various models available, selecting the ​right one can be‌ daunting. This ‌article provides ⁢a complete‍ review of portable power banks with AC outlets to ‌help you make ​an informed decision.

[[Explore Top Rated portable power bank with ac outlet on Amazon.]](https://itsallgarden.com/ebook-readers/?kw=portable power bank with ac outlet)

## Key Features Analysis

The effectiveness​ of a portable⁣ power bank with an AC outlet hinges on several ‌key features. Understanding ‍these specifications is essential for choosing the right model⁤ for your needs.

**Capacity:** ‌The​ capacity of a power bank,⁢ measured in Watt-hours (Wh) or milliampere-hours (mAh), determines how much energy it can ​store and, consequently, how ‍many ⁢times it can charge your devices.A ​higher capacity translates to‍ more charging cycles or ⁢longer run ⁢times for AC-powered ​devices. Common ‌capacities range from 50Wh to over 200Wh, providing users with varying⁣ levels ⁢of portable power.

The capacity directly impacts the‌ power bank's size and weight. Models⁢ with⁣ higher capacities tend to⁤ be⁢ larger and ‍heavier.‌ Consider the balance between capacity and ⁢portability to choose the right power bank for your⁢ specific usage scenarios.

**AC Output Power:** The AC ​output‌ power, measured in‍ watts (W), determines the maximum power that the AC outlet can supply. This dictates which devices can be⁤ powered. Lower-wattage power banks, such as 100W or 150W, are suitable for charging laptops, tablets, and smaller ⁤electronics. higher-wattage models, such as 300W or ​500W, can power​ larger devices like small appliances, power tools, ⁣or even televisions for limited periods.

It's crucial ‌to check the power requirements ⁤of​ the devices⁤ you intend to‌ power with the AC outlet and ensure the power bank's output is sufficient.‍ Overloading the power bank can ​cause it to shut down or, in extreme ⁢cases, damage the device.

**Portability and ​Size:** Portable⁤ power banks, by definition, should be easy to carry. size and weight are ‍critical factors that influence portability. Compact and lightweight models are⁣ ideal ⁢for travel, camping, and other outdoor activities where space and⁤ weight are at a premium. Larger, higher-capacity models might be more ‍suitable for home or⁢ office ‍use, ⁢where portability is‌ less of a concern.Pay close attention to the dimensions and weight of the power bank. Ideally,choose a model that⁣ strikes the right balance between power⁣ capacity and portability,allowing you to conveniently carry it in a backpack‌ or luggage.

**Charging Input Options:** The charging ⁣input options determine how you can recharge the‌ power bank. ⁤Most models support ‌AC charging through a⁢ standard wall outlet, providing a convenient ⁤way to replenish⁢ the battery​ at home or in the ​office.Some power⁣ banks also support DC‌ charging through a car adapter, enabling you to charge⁢ them while ⁣traveling.

more advanced models offer solar charging capabilities, allowing you to ​recharge the power bank using solar panels.‍ This option⁢ is notably useful for outdoor enthusiasts‌ and ‍emergency preparedness. A power bank with multiple ​charging input options offers greater flexibility and convenience.

**Safety Features:** Safety features are paramount to protect both ⁤the power‌ bank and the connected devices. Overcharge protection prevents the power bank from being⁢ overcharged, extending its lifespan and preventing damage.‍ Overcurrent protection safeguards against excessive current draw, ⁢protecting ⁣connected ‍devices‌ from damage.

Short-circuit protection prevents damage in ⁤case of a short circuit. ⁣Temperature control ensures‌ the power bank operates ‍within safe ‌temperature limits, ⁤preventing overheating. Look ⁣for power banks with comprehensive safety ⁤certifications from​ reputable organizations.

**Additional Features:** Certain power banks come with additional features that enhance their functionality, such as built-in LED lights for emergency ​illumination,‌ LCD screens displaying battery‌ status and output power, or wireless charging⁢ pads for compatible devices. These features can add value and‌ convenience, depending⁢ on your specific needs.

Carefully⁤ consider which additional features are important to you and ​choose⁣ a power bank that ‍offers the right combination⁤ of features and functionality.

1k4a7bu,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodNYC/comments/1k4a7bu/did_a_manhattan_bakery_crawl_couple_weeks_back/,"Did a Manhattan bakery crawl couple weeks back, these were my thoughts on the places and my planned route for my next crawl. Based on these what are some places you’d add, change, or remove?","Sorry for the straight up blocks of text. Here was the route I took:

I started around the most southeast point of Central Park and walked down to the East Village.

Petit Chou (I got the pistachio eclair and personally thought it was just okay. Not bad by any means but nothing to write home about. Unfortunately probably ranks among the bottom of the things I tried during the crawl, but I think might be user error since some of the other pastries looked amazing. Will definitely go back and try something else)

Tompkins Square Bagels (Had a plain toasted bagel with bacon scallion cream cheese. It definitely grew on me, liked it quite a bit)

Abraço (Got the slice of olive oil cake. Really really enjoyed this one, was getting pretty full but ate way more of it than I thought I would. Not overwhelmingly sweet and the outside of the loaf was perfectly crispy while inside was soft and crumbly)

Librae Bakery (Had the rose pistachio croissant and it was incredible. I think this shares the top spot for favorite bite of the crawl. Again, was feeling quite full and my veins were probably just pixie sticks at this point but I took down half of it with no regrets. So flaky and the flavor was simply elite)

La Cabra Bakery (Actually forgot to go when I was in the area, realized while I was in the next cluster so I walked back up but I’m including it in this section for location consistency I guess. Got the cardamom bun, and it was my first time trying a cardamom bun. So delicious, fun texture/shape, and the warm plate was a nice touch, very pretty. Win in my book)

From the East Village I made my way down to Chinatown. On the way I stopped at Los Tacos No. 1 in hopes of maybe diluting the sugar in my bloodstream. Not sure if it worked but the taco I had was great.

Mei Lah Wah (Pineapple roast pork bun absolutely met my expectations and more. Chewy stretchy bun with sweet crispy top and fatty flavorful pieces of pork, what more can you ask for. It’s definitely one of the heavier items but I loved it)

Kam Hing Coffee Shop (For their original sponge cake. This was my other favorite bite of the day! So simple but it felt like biting into a little cloud of happiness. Perfect amount of sweetness and just the most addicting texture. This was actually the only bakery item of the day that I finished. Immediately got up and bought another one to bring back)

From Chinatown made my way up to West Village where I quickly realized that I am in fact not the strongest soldier. I stopped by L’Industrie Pizzeria for something savory again but made the grave mistake of ordering the fig jam and bacon slice which I didn’t realize was going to be so sweet. It’s pretty good but I had to tap out from my West Village leg. Walked along the Hudson back up to my starting point. Overall, super fun day with lots of great eats. 

This is my planned route for my next crawl:

Same starting point, southeast corner of Central Park. Walk over the Queensboro bridge and down to Greenpoint.

- Radio Bakery

- Peter Pan Donut & Pastry Shop

Walk further down to Williamsburg.

- Win Son Bakery

Walk over the Williamsburg bridge and into Chinatown.

- ??? Need a bakery recommendation here

- Kam Hing Coffee Shop (have to stop by again, I miss it already)

- Spongies Cafe (to see how it compares!)

From Chinatown up to the East Village.

- Supermoon Bakehouse

- The Pastry Box

- Apollo Bagels

- Hani’s bakery + cafe

Walk back up to my starting point to finish the day.

Any suggestions for any of the areas I listed in the next route or must try items from the places I have planned would be much appreciated! Also let me know if I missed your favorite item at any of the places I did hit in my last route or just your favorite bakeries overall, and I’ll keep that in mind for the next next bakery crawl I’ll most definitely be doing.

1k4a5lg,https://www.reddit.com/r/travelhackinggermany/comments/1k4a5lg/die_schnellste_möglichkeit_meilen_zu_sammeln_ganz/,"✈️ Die schnellste Möglichkeit, Meilen zu sammeln? Ganz klar: Willkommensboni!","Wenn du dich gerade fragst, wie du **schnell und unkompliziert viele Miles & More Meilen** auf deinem Konto sehen willst – dann habe ich genau den richtigen Tipp für dich: **Willkommensboni!**

Und nein, du musst dafür nicht um die Welt jetten oder tonnenweise Shampoo bei dm kaufen (auch wenn das natürlich trotzdem hilft 😉). Es gibt tatsächlich eine Abkürzung – und die führt über Kreditkarten.

# 💳 Kreditkarte holen – Meilen kassieren

Viele wissen nicht, dass es bei der Anmeldung für eine **Miles & More Kreditkarte** oder die **American Express Kreditkarten** regelmäßig **fette Meilenpakete als Begrüßungsgeschenk** gibt. Und ich meine wirklich fett – da sind oft **10.000, 15.000 oder sogar aktuell bei der Amex Platin Karte 75.000 Punkte** nach der Beantragung drin!

Das Ganze funktioniert so:

1. Du beantragst die Kreditkarte (meist online, dauert 5 Minuten).
2. Nach erfolgreicher Anmeldung bekommst du den **Willkommensbonus** gutgeschrieben – oft nach der ersten Nutzung oder einem Mindestumsatz.
3. Zack – die Meilen sind da. Ohne einen einzigen Flug.

# 🔍 Warum ist das so effektiv?

Schau mal: Für 10.000 Meilen musst du normalerweise schon einige Kurzstreckenflüge machen oder seeehr viele Payback-Punkte sammeln und umwandeln. Ohne besondere Boni sind das zwischen 10.000 - 20.000€ die man mit den Kreditkarten ausgeben muss. Mit dem **Willkommensbonus** springst du quasi direkt ins Meilen-Level-Up – und das in wenigen Tagen statt Monaten.

Und das Beste: Die Kreditkarte bringt dir auch danach **bei jedem Einkauf neue Meilen**. Heißt: Du kombinierst Alltag und Meilensammeln ganz automatisch. Selbst der Coffee-to-go bringt dich dann irgendwann Richtung Business Class.

# 📌 Worauf solltest du achten?

Bevor du jetzt losziehst und dir die nächstbeste Kreditkarte schnappst, hier ein paar Dinge, die du beachten solltest:

* **Die Bedingungen prüfen:** Manche Boni gibt’s erst nach einem Mindestumsatz (z. B. 1.000 € in 3 Monaten). Das ist aber mit cleverem Einsatz meist kein Problem – einfach die Karte für alle Ausgaben nutzen.
* **Jahresgebühr checken:** Es gibt kostenlose Varianten, aber auch Karten mit Gebühren – dafür gibt’s dann oft auch mehr Meilen. Rechne aus, was sich für dich lohnt.
* **Aktionen im Auge behalten:** Immer mal wieder gibt es **zeitlich begrenzte Deals** mit besonders hohen Boni. Wenn du die erwischst, ist das ein echter Jackpot!

# 🧠 Pro-Tipp: Kombinieren lohnt sich

Wenn du schon Payback nutzt (und deine Punkte zu Miles & More überträgst) **und** dir eine Meilen-Kreditkarte (z.B. bei American Express) holst, dann bist du richtig effizient unterwegs. So sammelst du auf allen Wegen Meilen:  
🛒 Einkaufen, 🧾 Rechnungen zahlen, ✈️ gelegentlich fliegen – und eben durch cleveres Bonus-Abgreifen.

# Fazit: Willkommensboni = der Raketenstart ins Meilenuniversum

Willst du **schnell viele Meilen sammeln**, ist eine Kreditkarte mit Willkommensbonus der beste Start. Ohne viel Aufwand, ohne viele Flüge – aber mit richtig viel Potenzial. Und wer weiß: Vielleicht sitzt du schon beim nächsten Urlaub im Flieger mit einem kleinen Upgrade, das du dir ganz einfach verdient hast. 😎

Also: **Bonus schnappen, Karte nutzen, Meilen kassieren.** So einfach kann’s gehen.

Wenn du willst, kann ich dir gern eine **aktuelle Liste von Kreditkarten mit Willkommensboni** zusammenstellen oder sogar eine kleine Tabelle für den Blog machen. Sag einfach Bescheid!",1,1745230945.0,travelhackinggermany,0,1.0,False
