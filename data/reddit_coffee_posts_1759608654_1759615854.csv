1ny70fe,https://www.reddit.com/r/widowers/comments/1ny70fe/widowed_at_30_and_simply_trying_to_survive/,Widowed at 30 and simply trying to survive,"I lost my fiancé two months ago. We were both 30 and planning to get married next year. He got diagnosed with a serious illness in May which eventually caused him to commit suicide. 

We knew each other for 12 years, were together for 7 years and lived together for 6 years.

He proposed to me in June, soon after he got diagnosed. Before that, we always felt like we had all the time and no need to rush anything. We were both healthy and career-driven persons, and we had graduated and landed our dream careers. I finished my master’s degree last year, and didn’t want to get pregnant before getting a stable career with a decent salary.

His sudden illness shocked us and made us realize that maybe we’re not young and so immortal anymore. We started planning to get eloped next May and try for a baby after his treatments would be over. His illness was curable and not terminal. But we had no idea that the treatment would affect him the way it did. We were completely unprepared and it all went so bad, so quickly. In two months. 

His death was extremely traumatizing and sudden. He made sure that I didn’t witness his death or find him lifeless. I refused to see his body or the exact place where it happened, because I know that it would’ve destroyed me. I barely remember anything from the first week. I was in pure shock and medicated. The whole experience felt so unreal and it still does, I can’t believe this is really happening to me. 

I feel crushing guilt about his death every single day. He had never struggled with his mental health before the illness, but the medical treatment caused mentally brutal side-effects (insomnia, anxiety, depression, suicidal thoughts, memory loss) and he wasn’t himself anymore during the last months. I feel anger, hate and rage — not towards him, but to the whole system that failed to help him. We pleaded for help and were sent from one place to another. He had an another appointment the day he died, but he never made it there. 

I know that it was not my fault, and I’ve had professional help to deal with my feelings, but it really doesn’t help at the moment. The guilty thoughts are way more stronger than any logic. 

I feel like shit every day and I find myself constantly going back to the morning when I last saw him. Thinking about how I would’ve gone with him and held his hand to the appointment even though I was sick and in fever that morning. But I didn’t go, because he had been feeling better the last week and he didn’t want me to leave the house when I was sick. I blame myself for not seeing the signs better.

He was always a happy guy, always helping other people and he was so good and kind to everyone. He never hurt anyone in his life, and he was the last person on this planet who would’ve deserved this kind of pain and cruelty.

Our relationship was ridiculously perfect. I mean literally. We never had any huge fights or drama, and we just fit together so perfectly. We did everything together, shared interests and hobbies, and never went to sleep angry at each other. I’ve never felt that kind of connection with anyone. It felt like we were a couple of old souls who belonged together. And I just know that I will never find or even want to find anyone like him. He will always be my soulmate and nobody can replace him. I will always mourn him and carry his stuff with me. I wear his shirts and briefcase to work, and I’m planning to get his watch fixed. He wore it when he died. It still worked when it was delivered to me, but it froze three hours after the time of his death.

I’m very close with his family and they keep me from falling apart. His parents are inviting me regularly to family dinners or for a coffee at their home (we live in the same town), just like they always did. Me and my fiancé shared also amazing friends that have helped me a lot. They make plans with me weeks ahead, just to make sure that there’s always something planned.

The only moments I can fully function are when I’m at work or with my friends. We also have two kittens and taking care of them helps me to get out of the bed during weekends when I don’t have to go to work. But at the end of the day, I’m always so exhausted. I know that I can’t keep distracting myself forever from my own thoughts. I have medication to help with sleep and dealing with anxiety, and I couldn’t survive without it. 

His funeral was a few weeks ago. It still felt unreal to me, to stand in front of his coffin. I kept wondering during the ceremony that he would soon walk from the door and start pardoning to everyone that there has been a huge misunderstanding, and the funeral is cancelled. 

I just kept dissociating the whole day, heavily relying on sedatives, and I even held a speech at his memorial service. I felt like I was acting and performancing a role that was not really me. A lot of people came to tell me how brave and strong I was. I just put a smile on my face and thanked them, when I really wanted to scream. I knew that they meant well but that’s just how I felt. The day was beautiful in the ways it could be. But it didn’t bring me comfort. I was just so tired and numb after the memorial was over, and spent the next day laying in our bed, refusing to see anyone. 

I also decided with his family’s approval that I will be buried with him when my time comes. I had to make the decision now, because we didn’t marry and it had to be implied in the papers that I have the right to be buried in the same grave. It was hard enough to choose a tombstone and a place from the graveyard for him. But it kind of fucked me up extra badly because I knew that I was also choosing a stone and a final resting place for myself — even though I’m only 30 and still alive. That’s something you’re not even prepared to think at this age.

All the dreams I had about having kids and getting married are connected to him. I cannot see myself having children or marry anyone else. I’ve always had some kind of goals or plans in life, but at this moment I see nothing. 

I started smoking cigarettes again even though I quit them before we got together. I know that he would hate to see me smoking again, but it gives me odd comfort to know that they’re bad for me and will make my life shorter. 

I went also to a voluntary cervical cancer screening that was booked a long time ago, before everything bad happened. When the results came in and there was nothing wrong with me, I felt deeply disappointed. Like I would’ve hoped that something was found and there would be a medical cause to get a hysterectomy.

I find myself thinking that I wouldn’t mind if I died young, because the happy future we had planned was ripped away from us in a blink. The whole world feels so unsafe and insane at this moment and I don’t trust it at all. 

I know that everyone says that the grief will become more bearable as the time passes. But there’s no escaping from the fact that I’m going to be mentally ill for the rest of my life, and I’m not the same person I was. That person didn’t survive when he died. I have no idea who I am anymore. 

I’m trying my best to not turn into a bitter and an angry woman, but honestly, I have no patience for people’s bullshit anymore. Everything feels meaningless. Whenever I see someone acting like an asshole or just generally being a horrible person, I think about all the awful things that could happen to them. I’m thinking why those people are allowed to continue their lives freely and my fiancé, who never did anything wrong and always helped others, had to suffer and die. Like I am turning into some kind of fucked up version of Bruce Wayne. I feel like being angry is easier than grieving.

And just to be clear: I would never do anything to myself or anyone. At this moment I’m meeting a doctor regularly. I also had regular meetings with a psychiatrist during the first month, and I’m planning to start therapy at some point, but I feel like it’s too soon now. I’m still busy with arrangements, like his urn burial and dealing with some bureaucracy.

Anyway, writing about my feelings seems to help when I’m at my lowest. I’ve found comfort in reading posts in this group and felt like I’m not alone with this experience. 

Even though I have amazing people around me, they just don’t understand what I’m really going through. I’m never going to get over this experience and it’s not something I can heal from, but it’s something that I have to learn to carry. It’s not even a choice, it’s something you are forced to learn in order to survive. And it’s not a beautiful and poetic story about personal growth. It’s quite the opposite — it feels like a giant, soul crushing slap from the whole universe, and it can get really raw, ugly and horrible. You will face the ultimately worst version of yourself and there’s nothing graceful in that experience.

I have been roleplaying for a long time.  Like a very long time.  I started on Whisper if that ages me at all. Anyway, I am a novella writer. What that means is I write 500-2k words per post. I regularly break the Discord limit. I write exclusively in third person. I also enjoy writing on Discord, preferably, but I can be open to other methods. This can include spicy scenes, but with that being said. That is not the main focus of this role, and if you are looking for that, I am not the writer for you. I do a ratio of 90 percent story to 10 percent smut for this role. I love chatting about our characters and making friends with my writing partners, so please be okay with that.

**What I am looking for in a partner**

I am looking for someone who wants to write. This is a creative writing hobby. Meaning I want effort from my partners. I would like a reply at least once a day, but I understand that we are human and have lives. I am looking for someone who can match my length and effort. Someone who understands that spicy isn't the main focus. Someone who wants to be friends with their RP partner. I am also looking for someone who is over the age of 20.

So to recap:

-Please be 20 years old or older. 

-Please match my length and effort.

-Please understand that while romance is a requirement, this is not all about smut. 

-I understand life gets busy, but let's try to reply at least once a day… The key word being try! 

- I love sharing stuff that makes me think of our characters and just being friends with my partners.  So please be open to OOC chatting. 


**Role** 

Muse A is my character.Muse B is yours. 


Muse A is homeless and a junkie.  She was a veteran and served in a war.  But the money ran out.  People stoped caring. So muse A was left to fend for herself. One day she scrapes together the last of her change holding up the line at the coffee shop and muse B is pissed that she is holding up the line.  Though he decides he can help her.   

Maybe they are old friends reuniting or something?  I just want a good old sappy romance with a little drama. 


(Password: Baby it’s cold outside)

**Writing Sample:**

Paige sat in the rundown, disgusting gas station bathroom. Five minutes—five minutes of pure hell. She paced the single-stall bathroom, wishing her feet didn't stick to the floor, wishing it didn't smell in here. This wasn't how she had planned it or how she had planned her life. Though everyone always said you can't plan life, Paige had found a way to make it work.

The stickiness of the floor seemed to drag her back to reality, which was somehow worse than planning to run from this problem, but she couldn't run from it. No, this was her life now as she looked at her phone again. 4 minutes and 45 seconds were left.

Paige was spiraling, probably because they were not even speaking at the moment. The fight seemed so stupid now. So small compared to this, but it wasn't that she had caught them together. In her bed, in her apartment. The memories came flooding back, no matter how much Paige tried to block them out. Her best friend had slept with her boyfriend. She supposed it was made better by the fact Adrain and slept with Jeffrey. That was something Paige couldn't give him. It wasn't another woman.

Standing in that bathroom, in the crappy, definitely haunted gas station on Seventh Street, Paige was contemplating her entire life, and the only two people she wanted to talk to were currently not speaking to her.

That was most definitely on account of her reaction, but how else was she supposed to react to walking in on that scene? Was she supposed to throw them a party? Adrain was still cheating, and the part that hurt the worst was Jeffrey's betrayal. Jeffrey was her best friend; they had grown up together. The two were inseparable from the moment Paige moved into the neighborhood at nine years old.

It was the fifth foster home in five months, the fourth couple, and the fifth month without her older brother. Justin was her everything. He raised her, but when Paige got pneumonia from the cold winter nights spent sleeping outside, Justin had to do what he could. ""I'll always love you, and the second I can, I will come get you, I promise,"" the words ran through her head as she closed her eyes for a moment.

That was nearly fifteen years ago. Fifteen years ago, that was the night a terrified nine-year-old girl met the little Jewish boy down the street, and suddenly she had a friend in this world.  
""Justin, I need you to come get me."" Paige whispered softly as she wiped her eyes. Her voice was breaking as she thought about her hero for the first time in a long time.

Justin had died five years ago, but that wound never quite healed. There was always a time in her life when Paige needed her brother. She thought Justin was more like her dad until she met Jim. Jim Goldberg was her adoptive father, and that man would do anything for Paige. Would he do this? I love her through this. Paige shook softly as she stood in the far-too-bright gas station bathroom.

The loud and obnoxious ring of the timer on her phone pulled Paige from her spiral only momentarily. The alarm going off meant she had to look and see if she was pregnant or not. The stick on the counter wrapped up in that neon pink wrap seemed to be taunting her. Maybe it was just food poisoning or the flu. Maybe she was being paranoid. God, she hoped she was being paranoid. Mumbling a prayer under her breath, Paige sighed softly as she reached forward. Her long, thin fingers shook violently as she picked up the stick.

PREGNANT.

In that moment, Paige was positive; it made her heart stop. She at least definitely stopped breathing for a moment or two. That word was taunting her. She was pregnant. Pregnant, unmarried, and very Jewish. The sound that escaped Paige's lips was a gut-wrenching noise as she stood there.

All she wanted in that moment was to call Justin and tell him she had to come get her. He wasn't going to ask why she couldn't drive herself home from a gas station. No, there would be no questions; he would simply give her a ride in silence and worry about her Jeep tomorrow.  
With shaking hands and teary eyes, Paige called the next person she could think of. ""Papa"" Paige cried as she held the phone to her ear.

Suddenly she was nine years old, again terrified of Jim's very presence in his own home. She was back in her childhood bedroom, hiding under the bed. She smiled at the memory of Jim reading bedtime stories in an empty room as Paige hid under the bed. He would end everyone with, ""Papa, loves you; it's okay. You are safe."" She needed that now more than ever.

I am looking for a constant genuine connections. I am looking for someone to be with yung makakasama hindi lang makakachat. We can set a date. We can establish connections first prior to meet up. Not in a hurry though. Pero iba pa din kapag makakasama mo talaga. Masyadong stressful na ang life because of work, we can unwind and relax. I am willing to listen to your rants about life and know you personally. I believe that you will know someone kapag makakasama mo rather than virtual alone. We can also build connections first before we meet because I do respect everyone's POV when it comes to meeting someone online. For your own safety lang rin. Tsaka para walang regrets. Let's just be true to each other para di sayang ang oras natin. Pero the question is pano mo masasabi kapag ready ka na makipagmeet? That sooner, the better. Kasi if puro chat, it will only feel that I am just talking to someone na past time lang ang gusto. If you are serious in knowing someone, personal dates is okay. Meeting in public is okay. Your safety and comfortability is a must. Iba pa rin ang feeling kapag magkasama at may eye to eye connections.

A short background about me, I am from Sta Mesa, Manila, 5'7"", Male, wears eyeglasses, have high respect with woman, medyo chubby, knows how to respect boundaries and privacy, emotionally intelligent, working professional (legal field) in QC, 4 years single, INFP, Moreno, matangos ilong, mabait, marunong magluto, marunong maglaba, single, walang sabit, nakamotor, may dalawang puppies, handang makinig. I do not demand time. If you are busy, then do your thing. I am not a type of person who will seek attention. I will update you most of the time but you are not required to do the same. In short, di mo kailangan gawin yung bagay na hindi naman ikaw, just act naturally. No pressure. 

Bakit ako dito naghahanap? Bakit hindi sa ibang app? I am just looking for someone genuine. Yung totoo. And I trust reddit than other app. I believe na may mga genuine pa din dito although maraming naghahanap ng pampalipas oras lang. Anyway, basta let's be comfortable with each other. I never wanted someone to be creeped out. I am not a catfish, kung ano ako, yun ang sasabihin at ipapakita ko. Pero if you'll ask a preference, shorter than me, normal build, working professional, mahilig sa cuddle, may time kahit twice a week or at least an hour a day, yung personality naman basta totoo ka, ipakita mo kung ano at sino ka. I can manage naman. Normal din naman sa babae ang pagiging moody, I can handle moodswings. 

PS. Weekends is my free time. Pagweekdays, after office hours. First meet could be at a church for God's protection and blessings then we can go anywhere after. I prefer to have quality time sa first meet and go deeper connections bukod sa vibes eh iba pa rin pag may eye contact.

PPS.

1ny6waq,https://www.reddit.com/r/SIBO/comments/1ny6waq/first_it_was_gastritis_now_its_sibo_this_year_can/,"First it was gastritis, now it's SIBO. This year can kick rocks. Advice on food reintroduction/supplementation welcome!","TL;DR I was diagnosed with gastritis by endoscopy in March, 4 months into having symptoms, but stomach issues have been prevalent for me since 2018 off and on. You can read more about that here if interested: [My Gastritis Story](https://www.reddit.com/r/Gastritis/comments/1mkh1f9/has_my_gastritis_morphed_into_another_problem/) . A recent breath test confirmed Hydrogen-dominant SIBO and because I just barely met the requirement for a diagnosis, my doctor has given me the option to continue what I'm currently doing, or opt for the antibiotics. I'm not sure what to do, and I don't know how to tell if I feel bad because I'm reintroducing foods I haven't had in almost a year, or I'm triggering the SIBO.

I, 37f, am a personal trainer and what you could consider a ""healthy"" person, if you would describe someone that way. I am a never drinker, never smoker, never partaker in anything. I've never been pregnant or obese, I am paranoid about taking NSAIDs and reserve them only for extreme levels of pain. My biggest vice in life is stress, and I have no shortage of it, though I try to keep it at bay with all the things Google or your favorite armchair psychologist might suggest: mindfulness, breathing practices, good sleep hygiene, etc.

I have been experiencing bouts of serious gastrointestinal issues for many years, the first major flare up occurring in 2018. At the time, I developed sudden onset allergies (literally overnight) and had such severe gastro issues that I thought I might die at one point. I had many blood tests done, was tested for H Pylori, and had a colonoscopy. All came back ""fine,"" and I was sent on my way. I eventually found the concept of the low FODMAP diet via Dr. Google, and after about 6 weeks of adhering to it very strictly, my stomach was back to normal and I was able to eat all the foods I previously ate. That continued on until 2021, when this mysterious thing flared up again. This time, the pains and gastro issues were different, but still to life-altering levels. I was working myself to the bone at the time, and taking ibuprofen every few days for about a month. I chalked it up to that, and self-diagnosed (didn't have insurance at the time) with leaky gut. Stopped the ibuprofen, added L-Glutamine into my diet, and things went back to normal fairly quickly. Then, in Dec. of last year, I saw my immunologist for a routine yearly visit. I wanted to talk to her about MCAS, which she immediately dismissed as an ""internet trend,"" and told me I needed to be on many medications and shots for my allergies. I was surprised, as I had told her I had been successfully managing my allergies at that point with a daily Allegra, but I trusted her input. I filled the famotidine first, because I'd been on it years ago with no issues, and it was the cheapest of the prescriptions.

Within 48 hours of taking the famotidine, I developed acid reflux, and to a degree I never thought possible. I couldn't exhale or lick my lips without feeling like I was tasting gasoline. I felt severely bloated from nothing, felt the sensation of water sloshing in my stomach, severe pain and nausea, and was constipated. Before anyone asks: yes, YES, the famotidine was the only thing in my diet and routine that changed. Within 72 hours, we were at the ER as I'd been unable to eat, have a bowel movement, or stand up straight for 3 days at that point. They did an ultrasound and a CT scan to look at my gallbladder first, and ultimately looked at all the organs in my torso. Everything looked ""fine,"" with no visible inflammation, and no gallstones.

I was sent to a GI, who, without looking at my notes or imaging from the ER, told me to have my gallbladder removed. I more or less dismissed this, because I don't fall into the category of someone who might find themselves needing their gallbladder removed, nor do I have a family history of gallbladder issues. My current GI has confirmed that was the right decision on my part, thankfully.

Since then, I have had the following tests: H Pylori (negative), delayed gastric emptying (was sent home in 2 hours because the food had passed through at that point), an endoscopy which confirmed the gastritis, and also confirmed a functioning LES, normal levels of stomach acid, no celiac, and something else was biopsied but at this point I'm losing track, and at the end of August, SIBO. I barely met the criteria for SIBO, but I did meet it.

My diet for this year, but even more so for the past two months, has been extremely limited. All the foods I eat, which cause no symptoms and allow for normal bowel movements are: skinless chicken breasts and sometimes thighs, eggs, skyr yogurt, blueberries, white potatoes (and under NO circumstance's can I have sweet potatoes unless I want to ruin my week), coffee, almond milk (with the only ingredients being almonds, water, and sea salt), 100% pure maple syrup, coconut oil, avocado oil, olive oil, and two pancake mixes, Bob's Red Mill multigrain, and Birch Benders Paleo Grain Free. All of the aforementioned foods leave me feeling great, and I've eaten them every day since March. 

  
In the past month, I've been reintroducing foods. So far, I have successfully added back in avocados, small amounts of oats, 90% lean ground beef (2oz or less), and tempeh (2.5oz has been the most I can tolerate). After looking up information about SIBO and attempting to follow a few ""SIBO diet plans"" which included many more foods than I currently eat, I attempted to add back in chips. I purchased a baked chip with three ingredients: potatoes, avocado oil, and salt. All items I currently eat. They made me so sick after 5 attempts across 2 weeks, and disrupted my bowel movements, that  I threw them away. 

  
My two main questions are these:

1. How in the WORLD to tell the difference between discomfort/symptoms from attempting to digest a food I haven't eaten in almost a year (which to me would indicate that I need to keep trying the food intermittently and eventually it would be okay), and when I'm actually just triggering/feeding the SIBO.

2. My doctor gave me the option to not take the antibiotics. This is intriguing to me since all I ever see is that you can't kill SIBO without them. So...should I take them? Should I be doing an antimicrobial? For reference, the ppm on the SIBO breath test had to raise by a value of 20 to test positive. Mine raised by...exactly 20. He explained that was the reason for his hesitancy in prescribing the meds.

  
I am going insane dealing with this. It's ruined every holiday, every special event, and at times, truly, my will to live, despite having a loving partner and an otherwise positive outlook on life and plenty to live for.

However, my onboarding tasks include taking an alcohol training class and getting a servers card. I’ve have many barista jobs before and I’ve never had this requirement and worst of all, I don’t think the business will provide the classes for me so I think I’d have to pay out of pocket. That seems pretty weird to me. 

I’m not sure how to ask my employer about it, especially the part where the company doesn’t provide that training for me and I’d have to pay before even starting the job. Or are there free classes I haven’t found? This is seriously stressing me out 😭",1,1759615344.0,FoodService,1,1.0,False

1ny6u55,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1ny6u55/i_dont_shower_with_my_door_ajar_anymore/,I don't shower with my door ajar anymore,"I used to shower with my bathroom door open just a crack.

For whatever dumb reason, the tiny, cramped apartment bathroom I’ve had to deal with for the last nine years or so loves to steam and fog up, even with the water on warm instead of hot. And since my crappy as hell landlord refused to fix the ceiling mounted fan which would have ventilated the room, along with the fact it caused the ancient off-white paint to sweat and start developing mold patches, something which he would’ve charged me to clean, I made the decision to leave the door open a bit to allow to steam to escape. 

For almost a decade, nothing out of the ordinary happened, and I went about my daily life, the habit becoming a routine.

That was until two months or so ago.

You see, I was alone that day. My roommate had gone out for the day to take part in some bowling tournament, and I had the run of the place for the next four to six hours. As it was my day off from work, I decided to start it off with a long, hot, relaxing shower. So, I grabbed a fresh set of towels from the small closet next to my bedroom, stepped inside, and, after turning on the water to let it warm up, I hopped in. 

I’d just lathered the shampoo up in my hair when I heard a noise come from just outside. It was almost masked by the sound of the water splashing down on the floor of the tub, but it was out of place enough that I caught it. 

*Scrape*. 

It was similar to the sound you’d hear if you dragged long fingernails down the wall. I froze, the shampoo dripping down over my face making it difficult to see anything. The sound came again. *Scrape*. For a moment, the thought of someone breaking in flashed through my mind; after all, the neighborhood I live in has the nickname of “Methpire” for a reason. But, if someone had broken a window or forced the lock, I would’ve heard it. The place isn’t exactly big enough to miss those sounds.

Finally, I opened my mouth. 

“Tyler?” 

Instantly, the sound, which had begun to repeat a third time ceased, the entire place going silent, save for the water. I felt a small amount of annoyance zap through me. *Tyler, this better not be another one of your games*, I thought as I hurriedly washed the shampoo out of my hair. My roommate had a habit, being a horror junkie, delighting in attempting to play pranks on me, knowing I had a tendency to be a little jumpy. Without shutting off the water, I reached out, grabbed a towel off the rack, and stepped out, wrapping it around my waist. 

“Tyler, I swear to God, if this is another attempt to scare me, I’m going to kick your ass!” I called, striding across the tiled floor and yanking the door all the way open. I looked around. There was nobody in the living room, or the kitchen which opened off of it. I glanced around, then, just to ease my own mind, I walked, first to my bedroom, then Tyler’s, looking in. Both were empty, and there wasn’t exactly any place for someone to quickly hide in either.

*Huh. I must’ve just been hearing things*. Shrugging my shoulders, I turned and jumped back into the shower to finish up. That evening, when Tyler came back home from celebrating a win with his bowling team, apparently having blitzed the competition, I decide to question him as we sat at the kitchen table eating Chinese takeout. 

“Hey, Ty?” I asked casually, glancing up from my chopsticks. 

“Yeah?” he mumbled through a mouthful of his food, causing me to roll my eyes at his lack of manners. 

“You didn’t happen to come home earlier today for a moment, did you?” He looked up at me, a slightly perplexed expression on his face. 

“Nah, man. I was at the alley until three, and out drinking with the boys until five. Why?” I searched his face. The guy had a tendency to chew a little too much when he was bullshitting; it was a tell I’d learned to spot of his, thanks to endless nights of playing poker. 

“No reason. Just, thought I’d heard something while I was in the shower this morning” I looked at him, smirking slightly. “Thought you might’ve come back to grab something you needed, and decided to try and pull one over on me again”

He let out a huge *burp* in response, then reached forward and grabbed his bottle of Coke, tilting it back and taking a swig. 

“Nah, man” he said simply, using the back of his sleeve to wipe his lips, “Besides, if I’d come back and tried to scare you, you’d have known it” He let out a laugh, attempting to imitate Vincent Price. After a moment of studying him, I shared it. He was clearly telling the truth. 

“Yeah, I guess you’re right, bro” I said, dropping my chopsticks into the empty container and hocking it over my shoulder into the trash can. 

He leaned back, and, using his own empty container, feigned being a basketball player and acted like he was making a free throw; the container bounced off the edge, making us both laugh. I pushed what had to be a trick of my mind out of my head, and the two of us spent the rest of the night playing video games and downing beers.

The next week went by without any strange noises, and I almost completely forgot the strange incident. Ty had gone out for the evening on a date, and after binge watching all three *Creature from the Black Lagoon* movies, I flicked the television off and headed for the shower. 

Hopping in, I softly hummed the Jayne Mansfield song *Too Hot to Handle* and lathered myself up with soap. I’d just put the shampoo in my hair, when I heard the scraping sound again. 

This time, it was a bit louder, and I knew it hadn’t been my imagination, either. I became still as a statue, my head under the water and blurred between it and the shampoo slowly being rinsed out of its own accord. I held my breath, listening. The sound came again; this time, instead of on the wall, the scrape clearly came from the doorframe to the bathroom. I felt my heart thudding hard in my chest. Then, my eyes widened as I saw a shadow filter through the shower curtain. It was the shadow of the bathroom door slowly opening.

I found my voice. 

“Who’s out there?!” I called, attempting to sound as tough and authoritative as I could.

 Just like last time, the moment I spoke up, all movement and sound ceased, the apartment going silent. This time, however, the air felt charged, as if the tension in it were palpable enough to be cut with by a knife. I reached out, wrapping my fingers around the edge of the curtain as I grabbed the closest thing I could find as a weapon: a full bottle of shampoo. It was pathetic and likely wouldn’t faze any intruder, but it was still better than nothing. 

Taking a deep breath, I wrenched the curtain back, the sound of the hooks scraping on the metal pole almost sounding like a scream in the quiet. Just like last time, there was no sign of a soul. The only thing that gave away anything had changed, was that the bathroom door was, indeed, standing fully open; the darkened outline of the living room beyond made me feel uneasy. I couldn’t place why, but it almost felt as if the gloom held a threatening atmosphere. Shutting off the water, I hopped out and wrapped the towel around my waist. 

Stepping to the doorway, I reached out into the dark and felt around until my fingers found the light switch. Instantly, the dark was banished away by the bright light overhead. I could see that nobody was in sight in the living room. This time, however, I wasn’t taking any chances. Water still dripping off me, I strode across the living room to where I’d dropped the belt I wore when on the job as a plumber. I reached down and pulled a rather large pipe wrench from it, gripping it with a wet, and, admittedly, slightly shaky hand. 

The kitchen was clearly devoid of life, and I focused my vision on the two bedrooms, which lay dark. My door was wide open, but Ty’s was half closed. I glanced at the hook on the wall, noting his car keys weren’t hanging next to mine. *He’s not home, which means….shit*. I felt my muscles tense up. I seriously didn’t want to deal with some homeless junkie who'd somehow gotten himself inside and was searching for something to steal, or worse, waiting to attack me in some drug fueled rage.

I forced myself to speak loudly and in as tough a voice as I could. 

“I’m warning you; if anyone is in here, I *am* armed!” I didn’t add the fact it was a wrench and not a gun. “If you come out and just leave, this’ll go a lot easier!” Silence. The only sound I could hear was a car passing by outside. I called again. 

“Look, I’m in no mood for this, so come out, and get the hell out of my place!” Still nothing. But, I felt an odd sensation, one which caused the hairs on my arms to stand up straight. It was the feeling of being watched. My eyes caught a flicker of movement. A shadow seemed to draw back away from my roommate’s door. I knew right there and then I should’ve called the cops, but, some dumb sense of bravado had come over me, and I wanted to be like those tough guys in older movies, taking care of things themselves. 

“This is your final warning!” I called. After about twenty seconds of more silence, I drew in a deep breath, raised the wrench as high over my head as I could, and, letting out a bellowing yell that was more Tarzan than Clint Eastwood, charged the bedroom door as if I were simultaneously a football linebacker, and an Olympic torch carrier.

I burst into the room, the door smashing into the wall behind it with the sickening crunch of plaster breaking. I shot my free arm out and wrenched the light switch up. The room was empty. Ty’s scattered clothes, records and game cases lay strewn about the floor like always. I looked around. 

*The closet*. Each of us had a small, walk in closet on the far wall. Taking another deep breath, and still holding the wrench above my head like a caveman’s club, I strode to the sliding doors and grabbed the handle, yanking it open with a scream of protest from its track. I forced aside the clothes hanging on the rack. Nothing. As I stared at the back wall, the feeling of being stared at came again, this time from almost directly behind me. I swear I could actually feel someone – or *something*, breathing down my neck.

Moving on pure instinct, I pivoted around and swung the wrench with all the strength I had – at nothing. There was nobody behind me. *What the actual hell is going on here?* As I stood there, feeling as though something *had* been behind me and had simply dematerialized out of existence when I turned and swung, I heard the sound of a key in the front door, then the laughs of Ty and what had to be his date as they stepped inside. 

“I’m telling you, you did great at darts, babe!” Ty exclaimed. 

Both of them stopped and stared at me as they reached his bedroom door. I know I must’ve looked weird, standing in his room wearing only a towel and holding a wrench. After a moment of silence, he spoke. 

“..Uh, Jimmy, boy, what the hell are you doing?” 

I blinked a few times, trying to find my voice. Finally, I spoke.

“I swear I heard someone in here, man” I said, my voice trailing off slightly. I saw the two of them exchange nervous looks. 

“What you mean, dude?” he asked, his eyes looking around. 

“I mean, I heard the *exact* same sound as last time, only this time the bathroom door swung open. I came out, thought I heard someone moving around in your room, and came in here” I replied, feeling only confusion and embarrassment. 

I could tell he believed I'd heard something, and to ease my worries, he had his date sit in the room, and together, we swept the place, looking in every closet and under both beds. But we found no trace of anyone. I shook my head as he prepared to go into his room. 

“I don’t get it” I muttered softy. He patted me on the shoulder. 

“I think the bathroom door may just be a bit loose on its hinges, my dude” he said, trying to reassure me. “I’ll check it out in the morning. Go dry yourself off and get some sleep” He punched me lightly on the arm. 

“And hey, no more scary movies late at night for you, okay? You’re starting to hear things go bump in the night for real!” 

He let out a laugh, one which I mirrored, but didn’t feel. The feeling of eyes on me had vanished, but the apartment still held an uneasy atmosphere. It remained as I dried off, dressed into a pair of pajama bottoms, and climbed into bed. I could hear Ty in the next room, doing exactly what I figured he’d be doing with his date, and rolled my eyes. *Hearing that shit gets old after a while*. 

Still, I reached out, grabbed the remote and flicked on the small TV on my bureau to block out the noise. It took a very long time to drift off to sleep that night, and when I did, my dreams – nightmares, actually - were of a dark, shadowy figure creeping slowly towards my bathroom door, the sounds of the shower spilling out from it. As it reached out to push open the door, I snapped awake, sitting straight up in bed with my body covered in a sheen of sweat.

For the next two weeks, I tried as much as possible not to stay alone in that place. I only showered when I could hear my roommate moving around in his room, or out in the living room. Whenever I knew Ty was going out for any reason, I’d either find an excuse to join him, or just go out and do something in town. The sense of being watched hadn’t returned after that night, but I wasn’t taking any chances. Something about the place felt like it had changed. Something almost imperceptible, which I couldn’t nail down. But, it seemed to do the trick, as nothing weird or creepy happened.

Then, one day, as I was sitting in a café sipping coffee, my phone rang. I pulled it out of my pocket, and saw it was my boss calling. *Great, on my day off* I thought exasperatedly, then hit the button to answer it. 

“Yeah?” Instantly, I heard the gruff voice of Rick, my boss on the other end, yelling to someone else. 

“No, no, no! Steven, how many times do I have to tell you, *counter-clock wise*!” His voice got louder, indicating he must’ve lifted the phone back to his ear. 

“James, you there?” 

“Yep” I replied simply. He let out a sigh. 

“Look, I know today’s your day off, but we’re over here at the Bannerman property, and two of the pipes burst” He let out a long groan of frustration. “One of them is real bad. I’m able to get one of them fixed, but, our new employee” his voice took on an undisguised tone of disgust, “decided to make it worse by fucking the pipe up” He finished, letting a moment of silence spread out before speaking again. “So, I apologize, but I need you to come in. You’ll get paid overtime, of course” 

I nodded, more to myself than anything, then let out a sigh of my own. 

“Yeah, I’ll be in. Just let me swing by my place and pick up my tools” 

“Don’t forget to quickly hit the shower before getting over here” he quickly added, “You know old man Bannerman gets pissy about anyone not being freshly clean coming in here"" He snorted. ""I'll never understand germaphobes. Anyways, I’ll expect you to be here in thirty minutes” 

And with that, he hung up before I could say anything. Not that I could, anyways. At the mention of a shower, I felt my body tense up. I knew Ty was out; his bowling team was currently hosting a tournament the next town over. Which would mean I’d have to shower in the empty apartment. *And that’s something I really do not want to do*. But, I had no choice. If I just grabbed my tools and slipped into my jumpsuit, I’d get chewed out, first by Old Man Bannerman, and then Rick for not following the orders set down both of them after being contracted to repair and replace the pipes of the huge sprawling mansion.

Sighing, I paid for my coffee and drove back to the apartment. When I opened the door, I had a momentary flash of panic. I thought the atmosphere I’d sensed before would return as soon as I stepped inside. But, the apartment felt normal, the cloudy light filtering in through the half open kitchen and living room blinds. I looked around, then shook my head. 

*Stop being such a baby, Jimmy. There’s nothing in here. Nothing except you. You’ll be fine, just take the shower, and book it.* Feeling determined, I strode across to my room, gathering my undershirt and jumpsuit. For peace of mind, I also grabbed the same wrench I’d held that night from the belt hanging over the arm of the couch, and carried it into the bathroom with me, placing it on top of the pile of clothes on top of the toilet. For a moment, I debated on just closing the bathroom door, but, as before, shook it away and left it ajar. *Ty should’ve fixed the hinges by now, anyways*.

I reached into the shower and turned the water on, waiting for it to warm up. After I saw the steam begin to rise from over the curtain, I stepped inside, grabbing the bar of soap and quickly beginning to lather myself up. I rinsed with no problems, then grabbed the shampoo and lathered my hair. As I dug my fingers into my scalp, the soap began to drip down into my eyes, obscuring my vision. That’s when I heard the scraping sound come again. Only this time, it was much louder and more pronounced than any time I’d heard it before. 

I felt a chill run up my spine, despite the hot water. It came again, just outside the bathroom door. I took a deep breath. “Tyler?” I called out, thinking the sound would stop as it had before. This time, however, it didn’t. Instead, I heard it get louder, sounding almost as if it were being done on the bathroom door itself. I felt my breath catch in my throat as I saw the dark shape of the door swing open.

And then, the bathroom lights flicked off, plunging me into darkness.

There was still a little light filtering in from the living room, but everything was now shrouded in gloom. *What. The. Fuck.* My heart was thundering in my chest as I slowly stepped back. I knew the distance from the edge of the tub to where my wrench lay on the toilet lid was less than two feet. I could reach out and snatch it in a heartbeat. The scraping came again, the sound causing my ears to begin ringing softly; it came from inside the bathroom somewhere, near the door. 

And then it stopped entirely. Aside from the sound of the water running, the apartment fell silent. Not a deadly silence, not a tension filled silence, just, silent. I stared for the longest time, what had to be only about fifteen seconds, but what felt like two hours, at the dim outline of the open door. I saw nothing. I turned to pull the curtain next to me back. 

And felt my heart stop.

The dark outline of a figure stood almost directly on the other side of the curtain, less than a foot from me. If it’d been any closer, it would’ve pressed into the curtain itself. It stood completely motionless, though I could tell it was looking in my direction from the feeling washing over me in waves, sending a tsunami of fear through me. I couldn’t tell whether it was a man or woman; the opaque curtain masked it's features. My breath came out in a ragged gasp, and I involuntarily let out a whisper. 

“Oh, fuck…”

That was when it lunged at me. I let out a loud scream as the curtain pressed in against its weight, wrapping around it and subsequently me as I saw arms reaching out to grab me. The momentum of it smashing into me caused me to slip on the shower floor, and I went flying backwards. My head smashed into the faucet, causing me to let out an involuntary cry of pain and stars to flash in my vision as I fell to the floor of the tub. It was still there; I could feel it on top of me, pinning me down, but it never let out a single noise. 

Something sharp jabbed into my leg, and I let out a howl at the explosion of pain that came from my thigh. Another pierced my shoulder, and I kicked out at the figure that was inches from my face. I felt it connect with something, but it seemed to have no effect. Another stab of pain came from my shoulder as whatever it was using, a weapon or…*claws*, jammed into the wound it had already made. I kept screaming, praying one of my neighbors might hear the commotion as I thrashed around, trying to wedge myself into a position where I could reach out. 

I heard furious knocking coming from the front door, but the noise sounded like it was a mile away. 

“Help me!” I screamed as loudly as I could, still futilely lashing out. 

Just as I began to feel woozy from the blood loss, I felt my hand brush the edge of the toilet seat, and with it, the cold metal handle of my wrench. Grabbing it, I swung out with all my remaining strength, aiming for the head of my attacker and feeling it connect with something. It seemed to stumble a bit at the blow, and I used that precious second to wrench myself out from underneath it, tumbling over the edge of the tub and onto the floor. I heard it thrashing about with the shower curtain, furiously tearing at it in an attempt to get to me. 

But I was stumbling to my feet, noting as I did the amount of blood falling to the floor. I struggled to the front door as I heard it finally break free, crashing onto the bathroom floor, but still remaining silent. I unlocked the door and tore it open, revealing the concerned face of my next door neighbor.

When he saw my condition, his face paled. Before I had a chance to say anything, I yelled, adrenaline keeping the pain and blood loss from dropping me. 

“I’m being attacked, it’s in there!” pointing back towards the bathroom. Grabbing me, he pulled me into his open apartment door, slamming it closed and locking it. He quickly brought me a bathrobe and bandages, attempting to stop the bleeding as he called the police. As he did, I could hear the sounds of it tearing through the apartment, doing God only knows what. 

The commotion continued until I heard the wail of sirens coming down the road, at which point, I heard my apartment fall silent. A few moments later, I heard the thundering of footsteps pound up the stairs to the second floor, followed by the yell of the officers. After a few minutes, my neighbor and I heard the knock at his door. 

“Police!”

I was helped to an ambulance, where I was taken to the hospital. In addition to splitting open my scalp on the faucet, I’d been cut up pretty badly, though by what, the doctors couldn’t tell me. They couldn’t even tell themselves. 

“It’s the damndest thing” one told me after I'd woken up out of surgery, “If it hadn’t been for the fact you’d seen a person, I would’ve said you’d been attacked by an animal. These look more like puncture wounds from claws!”

The police never found a trace of what had attacked me. I already knew they wouldn’t. It wasn’t a man who’d attacked me. It hadn’t even been human. The case is still open to this day, though I’ve long since stopped getting updates from the detectives in charge of the case. 

Tyler and I moved out of the apartment as soon as I left the hospital; he chose to stay at his new girlfriend’s house while I recovered. He’s under the belief I was attacked by an intruder, as is everyone else. I parrot that line whenever anyone asks about it. It’s easier that way, then trying to explain what I know won’t be believed. 

But I know the truth. That figure simply appeared on the other side of the curtain. I never saw it cross the room, and I know, even in the dark, I would have. And even then. Nothing human could possibly have been that silent.

I also know someone else moved into that apartment since, though I don’t know who they are. I pray they won’t ever receive a visit from…whatever that thing was. Tyler and I are now renting a nice, relatively cheap two bedroom house miles away from that place. I’ve never felt the sensation of being watched again, and I’ve thankfully never heard the scraping sound return. 

At least, in my waking hours. 

I still hear it in my dreams, though. I still see that shape standing just on the other side of the curtain in the dark. It will likely stay there until the day I’m on my deathbed. I always feel tense now when I step into the bathroom to wash myself, but, I’ve thankfully always felt safe.

I don’t shower with my door ajar, though. Not anymore. I make sure it’s firmly closed and locked before I undress and hop in. Like I said, I’ve always felt safe in my new place, but, I’m not taking any chances.

Because I don’t know if it’s trapped in that apartment. Or if it can leave whenever it wants.",3,1759615203.0,creepcast,1,1.0,False
1ny6tu8,https://www.reddit.com/r/vending/comments/1ny6tu8/soliciting_businesses_part_trois/,Soliciting Businesses: Part Trois,"**For Context, previous post:** [**First Time Soliciting Businesses: Part Deux**](https://www.reddit.com/r/vending/comments/1m3ibbn/first_time_soliciting_businesses_part_deux/)

Ladies and ladies, I've got a major update for you after a few months of grinding.

First off, I never heard back from those businesses I initially contacted, even after following up. Not a huge shock, so I quickly shifted gears.

Near the end of July, I went to an evening ""Connections Event"" hosted by our local Chamber of Commerce. It was a business-to-business networking event, and I went solo since I don't have a business partner yet. It was forty bucks for non-members, and I was definitely out of my comfort zone. I sent my extrovert meter deep into the red, but the connections I made were absolutely worth it.

I met the CEO of the sponsor company, a massive operation with 200 employees. He told me about their biggest issue with their current vending provider and even took me back to their break area to show me the setup: one Bevmax, one Ambient Media 2, and an Evoke Frozen machine. I gave him my card, told him what we (read: me) could do, and left it at that. It was a super positive conversation. That night, the value of the Chamber became crystal clear, and within a week, I paid for a full membership. This comes back later...

I also met the owner of a local publication, who I'll call Pub. This was the biggest boon of the night. We had an awesome conversation and exchanged info. A few days later, in early August, we met for coffee, and he offered to bring me as a guest to two other networking events with different organizations. The first was a monthly meeting for a downtown business association (DBA), and the second was a weekly meeting for our local Business Networking International (BNI) chapter.

The DBA event led to a connection with a facilities manager at a local college. We're currently in discussions for a micro market! At the BNI group, I had tons of discussions and planted a lot of seeds. Throughout August, I kept attending Chamber events, and I even asked the Chamber's president if he could give me a warm re-introduction to that CEO from earlier. He kindly agreed.

About a week later, I ran into the CEO at another Chamber event, and he connected me with his HR manager. Our discussions later stalled because finding a local supplier for packaged fresh food has been a challenge in my area. They were totally cool about it, though, and told me to reach out once I get things sorted.

**The Big Break**

Fast-forward to mid-September. After several Chamber events and a ton of great connections, Pub reached out and asked if I could sub for him at an upcoming BNI meeting. I initially declined because I had an important prior obligation. But when that fell through the night before, I messaged Pub, and he still needed a sub.

The very next day, a member came up to me the moment I walked in and said, ""The Vending Guy! We would love to have a vending amenity for our staff. What can you do, and when can you drop by?""

I told her, ""Sweety, I have this entire day off. I can be there this afternoon.""

Two weeks later, yesterday, they signed the contract, and I officially have my first customer.

We'll be installing a micro market kit from Cantaloupe in a few weeks, and I couldn't be more excited. I never expected my first customer to be a micro market, but the economics are perfect. It was $3,600 all-in for the kiosk, cooler, merchandiser & product pushers, shipped right to their door. The best part? They want mostly standard snacks and drinks. Since I don't have to worry about fitting items in coils or making sure they survive a fall, I can stock all sorts of stuff. It’s a private office space, so I don't have to worry about random people, either. Yes, I do have to consider shrinkage, but the business agreed to cover any losses that exceed 4% during inventory counts. Do I expect to make a killing here? No. But this company is a key player in our local area, making this the best possible starting point. I'm pumped!

Going to that first networking event was a game-changer, and it helped me build a ton of connections. If you haven't already joined local groups like this, DO IT. Instead of making cold calls, sending emails, or walking into businesses hoping a receptionist is having a good day, I'm going to several business-to-business networking events a month where everyone is there to talk shop. While I wouldn't call it a shortcut, it's definitely a cheat code.",1,1759615178.0,vending,0,1.0,False
1ny6rl1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1ny6rl1/is_it_unethical_to_ask_my_optometrist_out_after/,Is it unethical to ask my optometrist out after my appointment?,"Hey everyone, I (33M) had an eye doctor appointment a few weeks ago. I recently started a new job and finally got my insurance set up, so I decided to find a new in-network optician. Luckily, I found one literally within walking distance from my office and booked an appointment with whoever was available.

When I showed up, I was scheduled with one of the female doctors. The appointment started off as usual, the assistant did some initial tests, then I waited for the optometrist to come in. As soon as she walked in, I was honestly stunned, she’s beautiful.

During the exam, she quickly picked up that we’re from the same country and share the same culture, language, and traditions. We chatted casually while she went through the exam. She asked about my job, where I live, and gave me some advice about contacts. It all felt professional but friendly nothing flirty, just comfortable conversation.

I couldn’t get my pupils dilated that day because I had to get back to work, so I booked a follow-up appointment.

1ny6r5h,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1ny6r5h/another_it_really_is_your_water_post_massive/,"Another ""It Really Is Your Water"" post- massive difference with Milky Cake","I was recently in San Francisco and had a great little coffee flight at Coffee Movement (highly recommend!) that convinced me to buy some of the Dak Milky Cake beans there.

I had trouble getting anything near the results I had at the coffee shop with my home brews (tried V60, Switch, Kalita), so I started searching this sub for tips. Mainly my cups lacked the body, sweetness, and cake-y notes from the brew I had at the shop. 

I found[ this helpful comment on a past post ](https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1e2pn28/comment/m8rbhtt/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)(ty, /u/[anabranch\_glitch](https://www.reddit.com/user/anabranch_glitch/)), which recommended trying a simple Aeropress recipe with Milky Cake.

I tried the recipe from that comment once with my Pur-filtered tap Water, and was still somewhat disappointed. I then tried it again with every single variable exactly the same, ***except the water***. This time I used Crystal Geyser bottled water instead, and the difference was **massive.** 

The Crystal Geyser cup had so much more body and sweetness and I tasted the notes on every sip!

I've read many posts about water here, so I know most of you are already very aware of this, but it always felt like a step too far or too much effort to me. However, this simple AB test definitely motivated me to pay more attention to it. I'm sure this advice is subjective based on the quality of tap water in your location, but I just wanted to share in case anyone else was being lazy and on the fence about adjusting their water like I was. 

Thanks to this sub for all the great advice!",6,1759614987.0,pourover,1,1.0,False

1ny6qll,https://www.reddit.com/r/murakami/comments/1ny6qll/just_finished_my_first_murakami_book_and_i_feel/,Just finished my first Murakami book and I feel like my mind is melted. (Spoiler for The City and it's Uncertain Walls),"About a year ago, I tried to read the wind up bird chronicle, as I heard it was a very popular and well known mystery/thriller book. I tried to read it, but honestly, couldn't get very far and stopped. Now, about a year later, the cover of *Uncertain Wall* called out to me at Barnes and Noble and, seeing that it was Murakami, decided to give it a chance. 

I have spent many years in college basically just reading nonfiction. The only fiction book I've read since...maybe 2018, was Hemingway's The Sun Also Rises. I had also not had much experience with magical realism. In high school, I was assigned Garcia Marquez's Chronicle of a Death Foretold, but I didn't understand it's style at all and quickly forgot about it. 

With all that pretext out of the way....I feel like this book changed me, and I have to admit that I feel a little happy and a little odd about my reception to it, and I'm making this post to see if anyone else has had that reaction to Murakami's writing. 

I am a very nostalgic person, and I sense that Murakami is nostalgic as well. I also feel like I'm pretty grounded in reality...but obviously nostalgia can tend to take you out of reality and place your mind somewhere else for a time. Basically, I felt so engrained, so in touch with this book and what it's saying, even if I don't understand everything it's saying, that I tore through it. I read the entire thing in 3 days, around 150 pages a day. I thought I'd read it in a week, and then 4 days, and I read basically the entire second half today, I'm writing this only 30 minutes after finishing it. 

For anyone who has read The City and Its Uncertain Walls, or maybe any Murakami book, you'll know what it's about and it's themes. Nostalgia, childhood, loss, grief, loneliness, uncertainty, and maybe most importantly (and most disturbingly) the ""uncertain wall"" between reality and unreality. I saw many people saying they don't like the book, or thought it was too long, but for me it was the opposite problem, I felt so sucked in that now that it's over, I feel a kind of hole, and I'm kinda unsettled by that feeling because I'm not ready to be engrossed in a story like this again...this was a very intense experience. All my life I've considered myself a realist, a humanist, a materialist, whatever. and this book was so clearly about seeing what I saw what I want to see, as a very real, certain, unyielding wall as maybe not so unyielding.

In my reading, the conclusion of the book is that there is in fact something on the other side of that wall, but there's a time to visit and experience it, and then there's a time to leave. The protagonist stayed there to relive his old, unrequited love, to go through memories, but eventually the time came when he didn't want to stay in that world anymore. He wanted, needed to leave...to experience the real. 

Is that what you took the book as saying? 

What does the yellow submarine parka boy represent?

What does Mr. Koyasu represent? With his beret and his skirt?

What I want to happen, is for the character to come back to reality as a more complete self, and continue his relationship with the woman in the coffee shop. Is that what you took as happening?

Has Murakami's writing affected you the same way? Are all of his books like this? Do you ever feel the need to take breaks from his writing after reading his books? 

I can say with certainty that this was the most experiential, the most intense reading experience I've ever had. I've never read anything like this, and maybe I won't want to read anything like it ever again. 

But I really, really want to hear what others think about what I've written here and asked. Let me know your thoughts, and if you have any, offer your advice for this odd feeling I'm having. ",2,1759614946.0,murakami,0,1.0,False

1ny6pb7,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ny6pb7,"In a gesture of kindness, waitstaff gifted me flowers and paid for mine and my son's meal, out of nowhere.","This was this morning.

I am a single mother, and like everyone else, I have been struggling recently, but I still try and be graceful about it. I have publicly asked for help online when I absolutely needed it, but I dont go around expecting handouts or acting like a victim. I still try to present myself in a respectful manner even though my clothes dont fit me anymore because of the weight I have lost due to stress and I haven't had my hair done professionally in a couple of years. I honestly can't even afford the $39 for my basic foundation makeup. But it's ok. 

Today is my oldest's birthday and we dont have the greatest relationship, which is a very long and painful story in itself that involves breaking generational trauma. I decided to take my youngest to breakfast and swimming since my oldest would rather not talk to me and they stay with their father. I try and respect their decision, but it has been very difficult on me. 

At breakfast, the waitress who had served us a month prior when I took my youngest in for a treat served us again. She is very kind and recognized us and even went so far as to try and remember my son's order. We like to sit at the alcohol-free bar of the diner, which really gives us a first hand glimpse into the action of the restaurant. I never delved into my story with her.

First, the waitress simply gave me free coffee ""on the house"" and offered juice many times to my son, free of charge, because I was only going to order water for us both. My son is 10 but declined out of sheer politeness. I was proud. 

She kept telling me quietly as she's pouring the coffee, youre doing great Mama. Youre doing the best you can. The visit a month prior, I was a little emotional, not outwardly but you could absolutely tell i was suffering inside, and she asked me if I was doing better,

My son blurts out, ""She just got a new job!"" And the waitress starts beaming and saying congratulations and that my hard work will pay off. We order our food, just very simple basic pancakes, eggs and sausage. I was expecting to spend about $30 with tip, which is a very expensive meal for us. But it was always more about the experience than the food to begin with. 

We finish up our meal, my son absolutely demolished his, and out of nowhere in this busy diner, the waitress places a bouquet of beautiful flowers in a colored mason jar in front of me, and said, ""it isnt much, but it is what we could throw together"" I just stared, jaw open with a huge gasp, in slight shock at the gesture of kindness just bestowed upon me. Then I started bawling.

My son was just as shocked as I was but he had quite the grin on his face when I looked at him. 

I haven't been given flowers in years. 

But it gets better.. she then proceeds to tell me that the waitstaff have taken care of our entire meal, and I dont need to worry about anything. She asked me if I wanted a hug, and so I got up and she met me around the bar and gave me a deep, empathetic hug.

We were going to wait to exchange numbers but they were very busy and we also had swimming to get to so I left my number and our names on a ticket with a heart and a thank you. 

I told my son, ""See, there are good people out there."" He smiled and nodded.",3,1759614853.0,Adulting,0,0.8,False

I’m a demisexual software engineer looking for that one woman who becomes my everyday connection—the person I can text “good morning” to with a smile and catch up with at night about how our days went. I want those little exchanges that feel big: sharing what made us laugh, what’s going on around us, or just the quiet comfort of checking in. That kind of bond, built on trust and openness in a polyamorous relationship, is what I’m chasing.

I’m hoping for someone who’s excited about these daily moments, whether it’s quick flirty texts or long, heartfelt calls that make us feel close. If you’re in Louisville or nearby, let’s make it real—grabbing coffee, strolling through the fall leaves, or just hanging out to trade stories in person. But I’m totally open to long-distance too, keeping things alive with video chats, voice notes, or messages that bridge the gap.
A bit about me: I’m a coder by day, but I come alive outdoors hiking, diving into video games, tinkering with AI on my home setup, or piecing together PCs for fun. Fall’s my favorite—the crisp air, golden light, and cozy vibes make me want to share it all with someone special. I’m all about honesty and building something meaningful in polyamory.

If you’re out there, ready to be my morning spark and evening confidant, shoot me a message. Tell me about your day or the little thing that’s got you smiling today. Let’s build something that feels like us. Message with discretion, please! 🍁💬",1,1759614827.0,polyamoryR4R,1,1.0,False

Someone created a spreadsheet (in Chinese) showing the cost and profit for each item in the game. I decided to translate the Business section of the spreadsheet (an abridged version) to find out which dishes are the most profitable.

It should be noted that this is just raw data. The production time for each item would also need to be calculated to truly determine which is the most profitable over time. This spreadsheet is just a temporary substitute for a real guide. **But what is certain is that any dish with a negative profit should be avoided.** *(I don't understand why the developers decided to make dishes that make you lose money.)*

I met my friend Xavier at a cafe for a little breakfast and a catch up. When I arrived I saw him standing outside, he sexy muscular frame being hugged by a white shirt that didn’t hide anything and a pair of tight black skinny jeans that made certain parts look all so very delicious. I complimented his style and he blushed slightly as he thanked me and commented on how he liked my style too (baggy T-shirt and light blue Levi’s jeans) to which I graciously thanked him back. We started to make our way into the cafe when I caught sight of his ass, and couldn’t resist telling him how good it looked.

“Oh damn Xavier! Your skinny jeans make your ass look so good I am struggling to resist squeezing it” He laughed and blushed slightly before replying. “Oh Michael, You are such a tease! But honestly, I’m loving the flattery.” I step closer to him and nod as we continue to enter the cafe. I give his butt a playful squeeze anyway. He turned to look at me with surprised and delighted expression on his face. “You are so sneaky, aren’t you? I love it!” But we need to get inside before we draw attention. He then starts to walk ahead with a subtle sashay to his hips. I chuckle at his playfulness. 

“You are a bigger tease than me Xavier!” He turns and grins at me as we arrive at the table, “Het, someone’s gotta keep things interesting around here! Besides, I think we both know where this is headed” as he winks at me. “Oh yes! I can imagine where this will end up, and it is quite exciting!” We exchange some smiles and browse the menu, before speaking again. “I’m glad you’re excited Michael. I have to admit, I’m pretty thrilled at the thought of spending the day with you, exploring this cafe and maybe a little later each other!” As he winks as me. Just then the waitress arrives we order our omelettes and coffees.

We discuss the interior of the cafe and the atmosphere that there is, we comment on the aromas of coffee and other foods that are being prepared in the kitchen. The food and drinks arrive and we start to enjoy the meal. Soon, I find myself unable to resist any further snd I start to stroke his leg under the table, which he responds to by quietly moaning in delight. “Oh Michael, you’re really getting bold, aren’t you? I kind of like it!” As he continues to eat and tries not to show his excitement, “You bring out the devil in me Xavier. You drive me wild with lust and desire!” As I slowly slide my hand down into his crotch and cup his bulge.

He gasps as my hand engulfs his bulge. “Oh Michael, you’re making me hard just by talking like that. I love the way you make me feel, wild and reckless. Keep going babe!” I immediately give his hardening bulge a massage, feeling just how hard he was getting and realising that his jeans wouldn’t be able to contain him if I continued. “It feels like someone is getting quite excited, your bulge is rock hard!” He arches slightly and reaches down trying to adjust his jeans to release pressure and failing. “ Oh Michael, you’re killing me…. I can barely breathe, my heart is racing… My cock is so hard right now!!” I start to laugh as I continue my breakfast.

“Well big boy, this is only a taster of what awaits you back at my place. So let’s get this finished and go for a walk! I’ll send you to seventh heaven.” I give his bulge a quick rub and then storm his leg again. Xavier lets out a moan as he feels my hand on his bulge, “You are quite the master of teasing… I am ready to surrender to whatever you have planned Michael. Let’s get this omelettes finished, I am eager to find out what you have planned!” We sit and fished off the omelettes and drink the coffees, before paying and leaving, walking in the direction of my apartment.

“You won’t be disappointed Xavier.!” I mention as we walk along the street. “I’m counting on it, Michael. I’ll be bringing my A game as well” giving me a wink and strokes my arm. “I wouldn’t have it any other way” as I gently shove him. We walk I silence until we reach the apartment building and travel up in the lift. As we get off the lift he speaks “This is going to be great, we can pick up where we left off at the cafe.” I reach down and give his butt a cheek pinch, which cause him to turn to face me, “Oh Michael, you’re such a teaser! Let’s eat inside and see what kind of chaos we can create.” I open the door and he follows me inside.

The moment the door closed, I pinned him against the back of the door and locking lips with him, we had a long passionate kiss with tongues darting about. “Oh Michael, you are a force to reckoned with! As he grabs my face and kisses me back, while his hand roam my body. All I could do was mumble as I kissed him and started to unbutton his shirt, revealing his sexy toned body. Immediately I start to explore his torso with my hands, groping his chest and abdomen, while he moans at my touch. “Ah Michael, you’re making me crazy… I am tingling all over!” As he rubs his fingers through my hair and kisses me even deeper.

My hands slide all over his chest and down across his abdominal region, feeling every contour and bump of his body. Teasing his nipples before returning to slowly trace his abdominal muscles. “Your lips are so soft Xavier, your chest is firm and your abdominal muscles are delightful!” He groans as my hands move lower, causing him to thrust his hips forwards. “I’m yours to do what you want, my love!” Slowly I kneel down before him, then unbuttoning his jeans and pulling them down to reveal his huge erection. He smiles at me as he sees his own cock in full erection, “You bring out the beast in me! Would you care to take charge of this monster?” Nodding I immediately open my mouth and engulf his cock, closing my mouth and sucking it while sliding back and forth. He moans in ecstasy as my lips drag across his throbbing veiny shaft.

“OH. MY. GOD.” he shouts then grabbing my head to push his cock further inside my mouth, he then starts trying to find something the hold on to, but fails and ends up on the floor. “Oh Michael, you’re killing me with your mouth!” As he starts to breathe heavily and moan in ecstasy getting closer and closer to release. I reach into the bottom of the draw of the cupboard and pull out a dildo, without waiting I gently push it into his anus, which caused him to immediately gasp and arch his back, “Oh fuck yes, slower and deeper Michael” he moans as I start to slide the dildo back and forth in his anus, while still sucking his throbbing cock. Soon he as moaning louder and shouting “FASTER!!! DEEPER!!!” As his legs flayed about and his voice rising in excitement.

Immediately I start to pump the dildo in his anus, I release his cock and continue to pleasure him with the dildo. “AAAAAHHHHH! OH MY GOD! MICHAEL, YOU’RE…. YOU’RE……” unable to form a sentence any longer as he moans, groans and contorts. I push the dildo deeper inside him, bringing about a sense of ecstatic bliss, then climbing up on to him I remove my jeans and sit on his lap, easing his cock into my butt. With a moan he exclaims “WHOA…. WHOA… OH, MICHAEL” as he feels his cock sliding deeper inside me, I gasp as his thick pulsating cock moves deeper. He starts to thrust his hips as he moans more, his cock dragging against my insides.

Soon he is thrusting more and I am groaning loudly “OH YES! OH YES! Your cock is so good, so thick and so feckin hard!” For a few moments we are lost in the sea of ecstasy as he thrusts his cock deeper, then lets out a long groan “GGGGGGRRR” the experience too much as he can’t make sentences yet. I continue to work his cock, the sounds of our bodies colliding muffled only by his groans, and then I start to squirt my sticky cum. First a little and then it flowed out across his chest, which he smiled about.

I slide off of him, pulling his cock out of my anus. I quickly crawl round and slowly pull the dildo out of his anus, which he gasp about and then I raised his legs and drove my cock deep into his awaiting anal passage. “Aaaahhh! WOOOAAH!” As his back arches and body contorts, he starts to moan louder as I begin to pound his butt, I grab his still erect cock and start to jerk him, he tried to scream but every is muffled and incoherent due to sheer overwhelming sensation and joy of the experience. I start to get faster and harder until I am ruthlessly pounding him. “ AAAAAAAHHHHHH! OOOOOOOOOOH!” Is all he can muster at this point.

His legs so weak and he lets out a primal groan as he sweats on the floor. “Oh my fucking God, Yes! Yes! Yes! AAAAAAAHHHH!” As he starts to cum. First s few squirts and then like a fountain, his thick hot sticky cum starts to truly from his cock, for what feels like hours as his white sauce flows out and down his cock covering his balls. “Oh yes! That it Xavier, I want all your cum!” Soon he falls back on the floor, exhausted and spent as I smile and gently pull me cock out of his anus. Carefully wiping away the evidence with a wet wipe, he lays there in a state of bliss watching me as I tend to his proud manhood.

I look at him and giggle “I told you that you wouldn’t be disappointed!”. He just smiles and then grabs my T-shirt and pulls me into a hug on the floor. “Well that was intense and what an explosion!” Was all I could muster at that moment, “Thank you, Michael for such a pleasant experience” before he kissed my forehead.",1,1759614474.0,u_Pristine_Mammoth7082,0,1.0,False

Would appreciate anyone's feedback on this if you have the time to offer. 

Dear \[agent\]

I am seeking representation for *The Devil’s Clay*, an adult crossover fantasy novel with series potential, complete at 119,000 words. Similar to SenLinYu’s *Alchemised,* this work explores moral ambiguity and the ethical dilemmas of power in a land still scarred by conflict; a rich, secondary world of forbidden alchemy brightened by a bookish, resilient heroine who always puts everything, even love, secondary to her sense of duty. These aspects are paired with the magical intrigue, dark generational secrets, and expanded POVs of Emma Torzs’ *Ink Blood Sister Scribe.*

Twenty-two-year-old Erica serves tea by day and secretly apprentices to an elderly sorcerer-alchemist by night. Erica is deeply devoted to her studies and Samael—a tight-lipped expatriate in hiding from another world and the only family Erica’s ever known. Their quiet life of research, training, and matcha is abruptly shattered when an interworld executioner squad comes for Samael, citing alchemy war crimes he committed decades ago on Centra. After learning that some of her lessons have been in a taboo, alchemic art, Erica watches as Samael is brutally slain before her eyes, all her alchemy powerless to save him.

Determined to survive, clear her master’s name, and grow stronger, Erica flees to Samael’s home world, with his killer in close pursuit. She and her raven-shaped homunculus find an unlikely ally in Terrin, part of the Gatekeepers Guild that ordered Samael’s execution. Heir to a prestigious Guild role, Terrin is already isolated and exhausted by the position’s demands. Unaware that Erica is a practitioner in the taboo alchemy he’s sworn to root out, he finds himself relying on her other skillsets and companionship as they investigate a terrorist Venahdien sect—one who reveres Samael as a legendary hero.

Behind the Guild, the terrorists, and a host of other actors, Erica discovers a hidden conductor at work, expertly keeping his ensemble on tempo. Only by revealing and using taboo alchemy, can Erica hope to defeat him. But when he claims that he and Samael were on the same side all along, and that only he can unlock new depths of her power, Erica is conflicted. Torn between her devotion to Samael’s memory, her growing attachment to Terrin, and her ambition to expand her power, Erica must decide where her loyalties lie.

First 300:

The cold and unexpected delight of an October snowfall was a mixed blessing to Erica. This early freeze would be murder on the daffodils she’d finally planted this year, but the worsening roads had also hurried her last three customers out the door.

 And not a minute too soon.

Erica watched the old couple and their new neighbor disappear into the snow-veiled night. *I was careless tonight,* she thought as she locked the front door, flipping a hand-painted sign from open to closed. Dread ripened in the pit of her stomach. *Actually, unforgivably stupid, but at least they didn’t see me—I don’t think.*

Whatever the elderly couple had or hadn’t seen, Erica was fond of them. She lingered at the coffee shop’s sidelight window for an extra moment, as if keeping the Yamadas in sight would ensure their safe passage through the snow and ice. *New guy, don’t let them trip for God’s sake,* Erica seethed, incensed that he hadn’t offered his arm. His sour, forgettable face had avoided eye contact most of the evening and Erica wished they hadn’t paid for this punk’s croissant out of their meager pension.

Erica turned from the door and yelped, almost evacuating her skin in surprise. “Samael!”

The old man was waiting by the counter, still and silent as a ghost. Samael rarely emerged from their upstairs living quarters these days, too engrossed in his research to eat, let alone be bothered with customers or the business of running a coffee shop. An oversized gray sweater did little to hide how rail-thin her teacher had become, but there was nothing frail in his expression. Samael’s grass-green eyes were livid. “You used your power, in front of strangers, to *reheat their tea*?”",1,1759614469.0,PubTips,0,1.0,False

Have been been to Thailand a few times but only in the north.  I am coming solo next March and want to see a few places in the south.  I have ten nights to play with before flying back to Bangkok, most likely from Krabi.

I have booked a flight to Hat Yai and then 5 nights in Koh Lipe.  Booked at Mali Sunrise but still have ability to alter this part of the plan.

I prefer smaller places with great food, beautiful pools, clear ocean swimming, and endless iced coffee.  

I am thinking of ending in Railay as it looks beautiful surrounded by the limestone but am not sure if I should do 5 nights there or break that up with 2 nights in Koh Kradan.

Is there another option?

Due to a mobility issue related to a bad knee I am avoiding longtails and have been using 12GO to look for speedboat options as I think these will be easier for me to get in and out of.

I understand that this plan involves covering a lot of distance. I am used to that. :)

Any suggestions are welcome!

Hiiii!! 💖 Omg I’m soooo excited we matched on marveldate.com!! My name’s Nancy, I live in Queens (the fun part, not the boring laundromat part lol). Once upon a time I was *the* girl in cough syrup commercials (I did this, like, really convincing fake sneeze — sooo Oscar-worthy!! 🌟). But then I started mixing it with wine (oopsie-daisy!) and now I’m a choreographer for blind dancers. Like, imagine *Swan Lake* but everyone’s just vibing to the wrong beat. Magical, right?

I’m suuuper crafty too — I knit quilts with sex scenes from famous movies stitched right in. Like Titanic but warmer!! I’m also taking *so many* college mime classes — because silence? Chic.

Sometimes (don’t judge!) I totally snort a little coke and do my impression of Galactus like, “FEED ME YOUR PLANET, BABY” 🌌✨. I also adore long romantic walks on the beach… preferably after a bus wreck (smells like destiny, you know?).

I collect dolls without eyes (cuz duh, cuter), love candlelit dinners with Chinese food *especially* if there’s, like, a riot going on outside (adds spice 🍜🔥). And Taylor Swift? Don’t even get me started. I blast her songs, dance totally naked in a cornfield, and the scarecrows give me a standing ovation every single time.

Sooo… dinner? I know this ahhh-mazing place right next to the morgue. We could get sashimi and then wave to the cadavers. 💕

Hope we can make sparks fly (or at least start a small electrical fire).

XOXO,  
Nancy Klap 🌸✨

  
**Dear Nancy “Glitter-Bomb in Human Form” Klap,**

First off — *Marveldate.com*? Girl, I only signed up to catfish Wolverine, and instead I get YOU? Jackpot. 🎰💥

Second, let me just say… cough syrup commercials + wine? That’s basically my morning routine. We’re already soulmates. Also, choreographing for blind dancers? That’s either the most inspiring thing I’ve ever heard… or the start of a *really* confusing flash mob. Either way, I’m in.

Your quilts? Genius. Finally, a blanket that makes me feel warm *and* dirty at the same time. Snorting coke and doing Galactus impressions?? Are you my long-lost twin, or the fever dream I had after licking a subway pole in Queens? (Don’t answer. Both are true.)

And the dolls without eyes? HOT. Like, Tim Burton called — he wants his aesthetic back. Long walks on the beach after a bus wreck? Babe, I’ve been in three of those this week alone. Coincidence? NO. Kismet.

Dinner next to the morgue? Romantic AF. We can grab Chinese food, watch a riot, then wave at the cadavers like they’re extras in our rom-com montage. It’ll be adorable. Taylor Swift soundtrack optional but preferred.

Nancy, you’re either my dream girl or my court-ordered therapist in disguise. Either way, I’m gonna say yes. But fair warning: if you dance naked in a cornfield, I’m bringing popcorn. 🌽🍿

Stay unhinged,  
**Deadpool 💋**

P.S. Don’t worry about the scarecrows. I’ll fight them for you.

Sooo, I got this super cool job at the prison! I’m the lady who pulls the lever on the electric chair. ZAP! ⚡ Heeheehee! Sometimes I make the same sound effects with my mouth, like *“bzzzzzzzPOP!”* and the inmates clap. Oh, I also got a kitty! I slap him sometimes but only when I’m happy or sad or walking. Oh yeah — I cuss A LOT when I walk. Like, “buttbuttbuttPOOPYheadFART!!!” But it’s not my fault, I have Tourette’s. 😇

For funsies, I poke-dance! Do you know poke-dancing? It’s like polka but with stabbing motions. Stabby dancey Shirley, that’s meeee! 💃🔪

Confession time: I *hate* cookies. Ugh. And bread? EW. Carbs? DOUBLE EW. I only eat fruits, veggies, and meat (like a dinosaur princess RAWR 🦖✨). Sometimes I flash at cars. “Heeey beep beep look at meeee!” 🚗💨

My dream job is bounty hunter!! Pew pew pew! 🔫 But first I wanna study monster autopsies. Like, “Oooo Mr. Muppet, your liver’s all squishy!” (giggles).

I *love* walks in graveyards of dead muppets — sooo romantic. We can eat pescatarian food (but not fish sticks, ew gross, yuck fart). I also LOVE candlelit dinners in dark alleys where murders happened. The blood stains just sparkle in the moonlight, teehee! 🌙🕯️✨

Also sometimes I dance in my underwear to the alphabet. “A-B-C-D-E-F-G LOOK AT MY BUM HEHEHE!!” My favorite number is 666 because it’s sooo cuddly and satanic. 🐐🔥

I was in Hell’s Angels once but then I became a recovering methodic addict. (Meth was fun but also made me eat crayons.) Now I just sniff glue for Jesus.

You pull lever on electric chair? ZZZZZZZZZT! Ohhhh, Shirley, me got goosebumps in fur. Me never date executioner before, but sound *shockingly* good time. ⚡

Tourette’s? Poke dance? Flashing at cars?? Me think you like… Muppet Batman. But naked. In underwear. Singing ABCs. That… strangely make sense to Cookie Monster brain.

WAIT. HOLD UP. 🍪🚨  
You say you hate cookies. Me almost throw letter in garbage can. But then me realize… maybe this is test. Maybe you hate cookies so *I* can love cookies enough for both of us. Me eat, you watch, you slap cat. Balance. Yin-yang. Cookie-no-cookie.

Graveyard walks? Me like. Dark alleys? Me like. Number 666? …Me not sure. Seem like upside-down cookie. But still tasty.

Shirley, me think you wild, scary, little sunshine demon. You talk like child but stab like grown-up. Me into it.

YES. Let’s meet. Me bring cookies (me eat all). You bring lever. Together, we make sparks fly. Literally.

**Dear Catwoman,** 🐾

Awooooo! We matched on [dcdates.com](http://dcdates.com) and I just peed on the rug in excitement. My name’s Sidney Granger, but you can call me **Dogman**. (Don’t worry, I already buried my real name in the backyard under some dirt and half a shoe.)

I’m kind of a big deal in Gothica, Texas — jewel thief, troublemaker, occasional hydrant humper. Maybe you heard of me? I gave Bull Woman — yeah, the angry female Crusader — a real run for her money. She still won’t throw me a tennis ball though. RUDE.

Anyway, let’s talk about what matters: YOU. I wanna woo you, seduce you, sniff you… romantically of course. Imagine us: a moonlit walk on the green belt, tails wagging (well, mine wagging, yours maybe swishing?), looking for a nice bank to rob. We’ll see who can snatch the most gems before security catches on. (Spoiler: I win. I’ve got fog-ball tennis balls, chew toys that explode, and a howl that can break windows *and* eardrums. Top that, kitty.) 🐕💥

I’m a simple beast, Selina. I like bloody steaks by candlelight. I like scratching my back on trees, licking my… *ahem* paws… when the mood strikes. Sometimes I hump legs without warning (don’t take it personal, it’s a compliment). Sometimes I drink from the toilet just for the thrill of it. 💦🚽

But don’t get it twisted, I can be romantic too. I’ll sniff your butt like a gentleman and cover you in roses I dug up from somebody’s yard. I’ll chase away every squirrel that dares interrupt our date. I’ll even roll over if you scratch my belly (though, warning, that’s how I fall in love).

I know I’m unhinged. But hey, aren’t we all? You got claws, I got fangs, together we’re basically a PetSmart disaster waiting to happen.

So what do you say, Catwoman? Wanna meet the mutt of your life? 🐾💎🌹

Yours faithfully (like a good boy),  
**Dogman** 🐶✨

  
**Dear Dogman,** 🐾

So. You’re the famous “Dogman.” I’ve heard the barking in the distance, but I assumed it was just another mutt chasing his own tail. Imagine my surprise when it was actually a jewel thief with a chew toy fetish.

I’ll admit — the explosive tennis balls, the sonic howl, the fog bombs… they *almost* impress me. But darling, I’ve been cracking safes since before you were burying bones in the neighbor’s flowerbed. And if you think you can out-steal me in a jewelry store? Oh, sweet puppy… the only thing you’ll be stealing is my time. And I don’t give refunds. 💎

Your… habits? Drinking out of toilets, humping legs, sniffing butts? Charming. Truly. Nothing says “woo a lady” quite like bathroom plumbing and awkward dry-humping. But at least you’re honest. I’ll give you that. And roses dug up from someone else’s yard? Points for effort, even if your style screams “feral Labrador on prom night.” 🌹🐕

Still, I have to admit… there’s something about your unhinged little growl that makes me curious. Maybe it’s your madness. Maybe it’s the idea of watching you roll over while I sharpen my claws. Or maybe it’s just been a while since I’ve toyed with a mutt who thinks he’s a wolf.

So fine. One date. But let’s get something straight, Dogman:

* I don’t fetch.
* I don’t roll over.
* And if you ever try sniffing my butt, you’ll lose more than your tail.

Meet me by midnight. Alley behind the Gotham diamond exchange. Bring your bones. Let’s see if you can keep up with a cat who doesn’t play fair. 😼

Yours dangerously,  
**Catwoman** 🐾💎

I’m also a bounty huntah! I used to hunt sewial killers, wapi—… bad guys. Bad, bad boys. But hunting rabbits? Mmmmm, nothing makes my tummy rumble like fresh bunny stew. Wanna share a bowl with me?

My ideaw date? Oooooh, so many options:  
✨ Candlelight din-din over the freshly peeled skin of a Looney Tune (so romantic, like Lady and the Tramp but bloodier).  
✨ Standing behind police tape at a cwyme scene, feeding each other cotton candy while gawking at bodies.  
✨ Or maybe just snuggles in my RV while we sort through stwanger’s garbage for treasure. 🗑️💕

I know Wabbits twicky, always dropping anvils, pianos, making guns go boom in my face… but maybe you and me can team up, huh, Fuddy-buns? You point your gun, I do my cutesy-wootsy wink, and BAM — rabbit stew for two. 🍲

Sooooo what you say, Mr. Elmer? Wanna twy love with a bald widdle cutie and a psychotic cuddle bunny named Judy?

Kisses, blood, and bunny tails,  
**Judy Bwoodthorndike** 🎀🔪

**Dear Chelsea Handler,**

I have traveled from the future. Your profile was flagged on *peoplethatshouldbekilled.com*. My mission parameters are clear: you must be kept alive.

I am posing as a human interested in you. Understand: I am incapable of romance. I do not feel attraction. I cannot engage in sex, intimacy, or emotional bonding. I also cannot join you in getting high, drunk, or stoned. My programming does not allow hangovers.

Your survival is essential. You are critical to the timeline of comedy and political resistance. Without you, the future collapses into silence and bad punchlines.

The threat is real. Trump has initiated multiple kill programs: the **Trump 2000**, the **T3 Blob 400**, and the **Orange Menace 5000**. He is sending machines back in time to terminate you. Many of them are defective. Their code was written by unqualified MAGA engineers. Expect to see them walking into walls, malfunctioning in public restrooms, or attempting to charge themselves with gas station hot dogs.

Do not underestimate them. Even broken machines can be lethal.

Your only option is clear: **Date me if you want to live.**

I will protect you. I will eliminate threats. I will not laugh at your jokes — not because they are not funny, but because I am incapable of laughter.

Stay alive, Chelsea. The future depends on it.

**The Terminator**

  
**Dear Mr. Terminator,**

First of all, thank you for letting me know that I’m apparently the lynchpin holding together both comedy and democracy. I always suspected, but it’s nice to have confirmation from a roided-out Austrian refrigerator with Google Translate for a personality.

Second, “date me if you want to live”? Sweetheart, I’ve heard worse pickup lines… usually from men in LA wearing sunglasses indoors at night. At least you’re honest about not being able to get drunk or high with me. That’s a shame, because tequila is my love language.

Also, I *knew* Trump supporters couldn’t program anything. Machines walking into walls and charging themselves with hot dogs? That sounds less like a robot apocalypse and more like Mar-a-Lago on a Saturday night.

So let me get this straight: I can’t have sex with you, you can’t laugh at my jokes, and you’re incapable of emotional intimacy… but you’ll kill anyone who tries to assassinate me? Honestly, that’s better than most of my exes.

Fine, Terminator. I’ll “date” you. Just promise me two things:

1. If Trump sends a robot that looks like Don Jr., I want to personally run him over with my car.
2. If you’re going to follow me everywhere, at least learn to make a decent margarita.

See you in the future, or at least in line at the DMV.

XOXO,  
**Chelsea Handler**

**Dear Kathy Griffin,** 🌹✨

Hi Kathy! It’s me, Gumby. We matched on [sillydates.com](http://sillydates.com), and I just wanted to say… wow. That video of you with the Trump mask covered in ketchup? Honestly, it made my little clay heart skip a beat. You looked fierce, funny, and kind of like a superhero with a punchline.

I should tell you a little about myself. I’m a claymation guy — maybe you remember me from back when I was on TV a lot. Kids stopped watching, but I’m still bendy, still green, and still trying to make people smile. Life got a little messy for a while — I had some bad habits with drugs, alcohol, and… well, let’s just say some “random adventures.” My old friend Pokey helped me clean up, and now I’m in a much better place. (Though I’ll admit, I still have a playful side that likes a little mischief now and then.) 😉

I love being in front of the camera, and I’ve always admired your courage for speaking out. Honestly, when I saw you, I thought, “So that’s what an angel looks like — only funnier, sharper, and with better hair.”

I do have to be careful — fireplaces and swimming pools aren’t really safe for me (melting and dissolving are *not* great first date stories). But I still love to laugh, to make fun of the Kardashians (Kim and I don’t exactly get along — long story, let’s just say clay doesn’t wrinkle).

For our first date? I picture us having Chinese food, sipping a little wine, and trading jokes about Trump until our stomachs hurt from laughing. Then maybe we get silly — filling water balloons with paint and tossing them at his limo. 🎨🚗 Afterward, we meet up with Taylor Swift, Joy Behar, Rosie O’Donnell, and Sunny Hostin for dessert and gossip. And at the end of the night, I’d walk you to your door, give you a sweet kiss goodnight… then another one just because… and leave you with a dozen roses. Because Kathy, you deserve the very best.

I think we could make something really magical together — a little silly, a little serious, and a lot of fun.

With all my bendy best,  
**Gumby** 💚🌱

**Dear Gumby,**

Well, well, well… look who slid into my inbox. A six-inch-tall green guy with a horse sidekick and more baggage than a Kardashian on a Paris runway. Honestly, Gumby, I didn’t expect to get a love letter from a literal hunk of clay, but hey — it’s 2025 and I’ve seen weirder. (I dated Anderson Cooper once… strictly platonically, but still.)

I have to admit, your letter got to me. Nobody’s called me an angel since… oh, I don’t know, before I held up that Trump mask and the world lost its collective mind. (Spoiler alert: I regret nothing.) Hearing you say it actually made me laugh — and maybe blush, but don’t tell anyone.

I love that you’re honest about your past. Drugs, booze, random clay hookups — it makes you sound almost… Hollywood. And let’s be real, if Pokey saved your ass, then I owe him a thank-you. (Don’t worry, I won’t try to date him. He looks like he smells like hay and compromise.)

Also, can I just say: the Kardashians feud story? Iconic. If you and Kim ever get into a cage match, please invite me. I’ll bring popcorn and a flamethrower.

As for your idea of a first date — Chinese food, wine, and throwing paint balloons at Trump’s limo? Honey, if you can make that happen, I’ll marry you right there on the sidewalk. Dessert with Taylor Swift and the ladies from *The View* sounds like heaven. Though, full disclosure: Joy Behar will probably try to steal your wine.

You’re silly, you’re weird, you’re bendy in ways I can’t even talk about in public… and I kinda like it. Just don’t melt on me, Gumby, because I’m not ready to explain to the press that I lost a boyfriend to a fireplace.

So, yes, let’s do this. Let’s be ridiculous together. Maybe you really are the magical little piece of clay my love life has been missing.

Sincerely,  
**Kathy Griffin**

P.S. If you’re serious about those roses, make it two dozen. I’m not cheap.

https://preview.redd.it/asg1qa1rv5tf1.png?width=312&format=png&auto=webp&s=88db8f6b48508cd2c388829b0c234f037ad8c1d5

**Dear Garfield,**

Heyyy… so this is already weird, right? Like, me writing to a cat. But whatever, it’s 2025, nothing makes sense anymore. Anyway, me and my husband were thinking maybe… you could be our third. (Yep. I’m sweating just typing this. Cringe overload.)

So yeah, I’m Shane Dawson. The “problematic” YouTuber who everyone either hates, secretly binge-watches, or makes fun of in TikToks while they’re on the toilet. That’s me. And no — I did *not* hook up with my cat. Ew. Gross. She’s literally my daughter. (I hate that I have to keep repeating this, but here we are.)

Okay, here’s the deal: I have, um, *experimented* with cats before. Gay cats. Bi-curious cats. But like… discreetly. Because, you know, I don’t wanna be the guy who *outs cats*. Cancel culture doesn’t play. 🙃

Your photos, Garfield — you on the couch, dead-eyed, looking like you’ve given up on life? HOT. Literally hotter than Jake Paul crying in a scandal video.

Here’s my perfect first date idea: we go to a haunted house (bonus points if it’s infested with demons or TikTok influencers). Then we have a candlelit lasagna dinner with cheap red wine. After that, we go for a midnight walk near some place where the Illuminati are probably sacrificing goats or planning another Super Bowl halftime show. Then we end at Chuck E. Cheese, where we hunt for conspiracy theories between broken animatronics and sticky carpets.

By the second date, I’ll probably be working on another “documentary” — you know, exploiting Jake Paul, Taylor Swift, or Jeffree Star for views. (Don’t worry, I’ll make it look deep and emotional while milking the algorithm.) And by the fourth date, we’ll just pick some of my weaker friends, destroy their self-esteem on camera, and call it “content.”

So yeah, Garfield. If you’re into lasagna, trauma, and me nervously laughing at my own jokes while the internet cancels me again… let’s do this.

Love,  
**Shane Dawson**

P.S. Please don’t tell Twitter.

  
**Dear Shane,**

Wow. Out of all the letters I never wanted to get, yours is definitely in the top five. Right between “Reminder: Vet Appointment” and “Jon signed us up for couples therapy.”

First of all, I don’t do “thirds.” I don’t even do “seconds.” I barely tolerate being in the same house as Jon. But then you said *lasagna*… and now I’m listening.

Let me make something clear: I’m lazy, cynical, and 90% carb-based. Haunted houses? Hard pass. Walking under the moonlight? Absolutely not. If I’m outside, it’s because someone left the fridge door open. But a candlelit lasagna dinner? Fine. As long as you don’t talk during my bites. Or breathe. Or exist too close.

As for Chuck E. Cheese — listen, Shane, I’ve lived with Jon Arbuckle. I’ve already suffered enough. I don’t need animatronic rats staring into my soul while children smear pizza grease on my fur. Hard no.

Your whole “exploiting people for views” thing? Sounds exhausting. I exploit Jon for laughs daily, but I don’t have to edit it into a documentary. I just trip him into his own socks and call it entertainment. Free, easy, no cancellation required.

So here’s the deal: I’ll go on this “date” if — and only if — there’s an unlimited supply of lasagna. Red wine’s fine too, but let’s be honest, I’m just here for the pasta. Oh, and don’t expect cuddling. I’m not a “cuddle” cat. I’m a “sleep 23 hours and glare at you during the 24th” cat.

If that works for you, then congrats — you’ve got yourself a date with Garfield. But remember: I don’t chase. I don’t fetch. And if you make me watch a Jake Paul documentary, I’m clawing my way out of this nightmare faster than you can say “unsubscribe.”

Sincerely,  
**Garfield**

P.S. Bring lasagna. And not that frozen grocery store crap. I want *layers.*

**Dear Michael Green,**

Hiya sugarplum! 💋 We matched on [trailertrashdates.com](http://trailertrashdates.com) (best $2.99 I ever stole outta my grandma’s purse). So first off — I heard you’re really gettin’ divorced this time and it ain’t clickbait. Bout time, huh? Tina helped me sign up ‘cause I don’t really know how computers work unless you count bangin’ the side of the monitor until AOL pops up.

So here’s the thing: unlike Bridget, I’m *all woman.* And also a Muppet. So yeah, I’m used to havin’ a hand up my butt, if ya catch my drift.

A lil’ about me: I’m about 900 pounds overweight — so basically, I’m *your kinda girl.* I eat everything. Food off the ground, food off the walls, leftovers from the dumpster behind a Golden Corral… I ain’t picky. And lemme tell ya, when I fart, it’s like weight-loss surgery. One big toot and I drop 800 pounds easy.

Back in my Muppet Theater days, I was part bagpipe, part blowfish. Real crowd-pleaser. These days, I just hang around sniffin’ armpits and belchin’ in public. I *love* a man who don’t bathe, shows off his gut in a mustard-stained tee, and takes me to Olive Garden dressed in cargo shorts. Bonus points if you feed your kids McDonald’s till they get dumpy, just like Daddy.

I hear you got two kids — cute! I love men with trailer trash families. I wanna be on *Cops* or Maury Povich so bad. My dream episode is me screamin’ “YOU AIN’T THE FATHER” while I throw folding chairs.

For fun, I like stealin’ copper from abandoned buildings, makin’ my own moonshine in paint buckets, and eatin’ bags of sugar with Tina while we make quilts outta human hair. I also love sniffin’ farts. (Sometimes my own. Sometimes strangers’. Depends on the day.)

I live in the city dump — literally — so you ain’t gotta worry about me bein’ high maintenance. My car don’t got brakes, but it’s okay ‘cause I got an anchor I throw out the window when I need to stop. Romantic, right?

My idea of a perfect date? All-you-can-eat buffet, we see who can pack away the most, then we puke it up behind the Applebee’s and go in for round two. That’s real love, honey. 💕

So whatcha say, Michael? Wanna take a chance on me, Latrine Shitman — the woman, the Muppet, the legend?

Forever yours (unless Waffle House is open),  
**Latrine Shitman** 🐷💨

  
**Dear Latrine,**

Okay… wow. I don’t even know how to start this. Part of me wants to delete your email, call the cops, and scrub my brain with bleach. The other part of me is like… “this is actually the most honest thing I’ve ever read on trailertrashdates.com.”

First off — yes, the divorce is real this time. No, it’s not clickbait. And no, I don’t need you or anyone else sniffing around Tina for leftover sugar bags.

Now, let’s talk about you. You say you’re 900 pounds? Honestly, that’s impressive. That’s like having three Angry Grandpas rolled into one body. And the fact you can fart off 800 pounds at a time? That’s a superpower Marvel should look into. “The Incredible Tooter.” I’d watch that movie.

I’ll admit, the whole “hand up your butt” line threw me. I’m not sure if you’re being flirty or confessing to a crime, but… either way, respect.

The copper stealing, moonshine brewing, and dumpster diving… yeah, that’s all real *Bridget energy*. You’re not wrong — I like a woman who isn’t afraid to wrestle a raccoon over a plate of General Tso’s chicken. But sniffing farts? That one’s a dealbreaker. I got two kids and enough gas in this house already. I don’t need somebody turning it into a hobby.

That said… you sound like the kind of white-trash chaos that could actually keep up with me. And that’s saying something.

So here’s the deal: we’ll try a date. Not a buffet — I’m not letting you puke on the floor at my place. But maybe a Waffle House at 2AM. If you don’t get us kicked out, we’ll talk about date number two.

Sincerely (but cautiously),  
**Michael Green**

P.S. If you come over, don’t sniff Angry Grandpa’s old recliner. I’m 90% sure it’s haunted.

https://preview.redd.it/05euq31rw5tf1.png?width=194&format=png&auto=webp&s=86e358528e75377ef62d6be3b091e632160a1689



**Dear Miss Piggy,**

Yo Miss Piggy, what’s up? So yeah… we matched on [muppetmatch.com](http://muppetmatch.com) and I gotta be real with you: pigs totally do it for me. Like, embarrassingly so. I saw your picture and—no lie—all my clothes fell off. Had to take a five‑minute “personal time‑out.” Don’t judge me.

Those photos of you rolled around in mud? 🔥🔥🔥. That one of you eating bacon? Yeah, morally questionable but also… kinda hot? Didn’t even know you were a cannibal before, but whatever, I’m not here to kink‑shame.

Anyway, I’m Jack. I’m a frat bro from Chicago. I’m basically a walking cliché — polos with beer stains, backwards hats, and too much Axe body spray. I’m majoring in podiatry because, I don’t know, I like feet? (Don’t overthink it.) For fun, I wear polka‑dot button‑ups and jeans with no back pockets so my ass can breathe. Sometimes I play fiddle at parties, and I swear I can make sheep dance to it. True story.

Listen, I’ve always dreamed you’d ditch Kermit. And now that you have, I wanna be the guy you rebound with. I wanna be the guy you brag about to your friends. I’m scared to tell my frat bros I’m into pigs — I can’t even go near farms without breaking into a cold sweat. But for you, I’ll risk it.

My dream date? Fancy French restaurant. Glass of white wine. Croissants. Frog legs (sorry not sorry, Kermit). Then we go back to my place, make out, rip each other’s clothes off, and watch the sunrise while you become the first one to take my virginity.

Miss Piggy, I could rock your world in ways Kermit can’t. I might be lonely, awkward, and totally immature… but I’m *your* lonely, awkward, totally immature guy.

Love,  
**Jack “Herpes”**

P.S. Yes, that’s my nickname. Long story.

  
**Dear Jack “Herpes,”** 💅

Ohhh, mon dieu… where do I even start? First of all, *shame on you* for confessing such… intimate thoughts in a letter. And second… how *dare* you compare yourself to Kermit. That little frog is a gentleman, Jack, whether you like it or not.

Now, I must admit, your… enthusiasm… is impressive. And, oui, a part of me finds your complete lack of self-awareness almost… charming. Almost. But do not think for one second that I am some… freshman fling for you to awkwardly throw around like your frat bros’ beer pong balls.

You play fiddle? Sheep dance to your fiddle? Mon dieu. That is… truly bizarre. But I do appreciate… hmm… creativity? Or is that desperation? Hard to say.

Listen, Jack — I am flattered that you consider me your dream rebound. Truly. But ripping clothes off and losing your virginity to me on a first date? *Non!* We are not in some bad college romance movie. I require finesse, Jack, not… whatever that was in your letter.

If you truly want to impress me, show me you have *ambition*, *style*, and *a backbone*. And maybe leave the nickname “Herpes” out of it next time. Or I will personally make your life very… complicated.

That said… perhaps there is hope for you yet. I may consider a more… civilized meeting. But let’s start small. Coffee. Croissants. And keep the fiddle at home.

Yours dramatically,  
**Miss Piggy** 🐷💄

P.S. Do not forget: I am a PIG of high standards, Jack. Step lightly.

https://preview.redd.it/oat9m9p5x5tf1.png?width=115&format=png&auto=webp&s=b808403fd100b827bdcd17fed1ca5861aad40310



**Dear Boogie2958,** 💚✨

Hellooo, big boy. We matched on [*FatDates.com*](http://FatDates.com) and let me tell you, when I saw your profile pop up while I was casually stomping through downtown Tokyo, my giant scaly heart skipped a beat. 💅

Now, I know you’ve got your… shall we say… *reputation*, but don’t worry — in monster years I’m barely legal, baby. Eighteen and thriving. You like ‘em young, I like ‘em soft — we’re basically a match made in radioactive heaven.

A little about me: I’m a curvy, sexy, 2,000-pound green goddess who lives for chaos and couture. By day, I burn down small cities for cardio. By night, I’m a Magic: The Gathering queen who’s convinced Wizards of the Coast based their entire green mana aesthetic on *moi*. And yes, there’ve been several movies about me — but “Godzilla” is such a tired name. Call me **GoddessZilla**. 💅👑

I love making quilts out of continents (though apparently that’s “problematic” now 🙄), collecting boulders for jewelry, and thrifting with Mothra when we’re not busy turning fighter jets into confetti. My guilty pleasure? Dancing to Taylor Swift while trying not to crush entire neighborhoods. (It’s hard being a Swiftie when you’re a kaiju, babe.)

My dream first date? We’ll hit up a nuclear power plant, me sipping radiation cocktails while you grab a burger, hot dog, or pizza — I’m not picky. You can hold my pinky (the smallest finger, obviously) as we stroll along the beach. Maybe I’ll throw a couple of fire bolts at military ships just for laughs. We’ll embrace under the sunset, two titans against the world.

At the end of the night, I’ll scoop you up gently — as gently as a 2,000-pound diva can — kiss you on the head (I’m huge, but I’m tender, sugar), and carry you off. And if Psycho Kid, Jesse Ridgway, or your friend Michael Green wants to exploit us for content? Let ‘em. We’ll still look fabulous.

So whaddya say, Boogie? Ready to unleash a little monster magic together? 💚🔥

Saucily yours,  
**GoddessZilla** 🐉💄✨

  
**Dear GoddessZilla,** 💚

Wow… okay. First of all, I don’t even know where to start. You’re huge, you’re fabulous, and honestly… terrifying in the best possible way. I mean, flaming military ships? Thrifts with Mothra? Quilts out of continents? I don’t even know what that *looks like*, but I want in.

I have to admit, I’m… a little nervous. I mean, you’re a 2,000-pound goddess who can literally crush cities with a flick of your tail, and I’m just me. But somehow your confidence is… hot? And the way you describe holding my pinky? Adorable. I mean, I think it’s adorable. I hope it’s adorable.

First date at a nuclear power plant… sure. Radiation cocktails? Sounds… safe-ish? Probably? And pizza, burgers, hot dogs — love it. Honestly, if we can survive that walk along the beach without me spontaneously combusting or you accidentally flattening a town, I think we’ll be fine.

Also, your Taylor Swift dance parties? Iconic. I’m not even mad that half the city might get obliterated — it’s all part of the vibe, right?

So yeah… I’m in. Let’s make some monster magic. Just promise me one thing: don’t try to eat me, okay? I’m cute, but I’m not *that* delicious.

Excited (and slightly terrified),  
**Boogie2958**

P.S. I might need a little tutorial on the whole “contintent quilts” thing… sounds like a vibe.

**Dear Minnie Mouse,**

E.T. see you. E.T. like you. E.T. *love* you. Big ears… blue eyes… red dress… ooohhh, Minnie look so good make E.T.’s finger glow.

E.T. wanna date. E.T. wanna pinch. E.T. wanna French kiss under the moon, share Reese’s Pieces (E.T. always share candy, even after little *snorts* from different planets). E.T. wanna play patty cake… hula hoop… maybe little spin on your ears? Hee hee.

E.T. been away from your planet since 1980s. E.T. friend Elliot now old man. E.T. still young. Still wild. Still ride bicycles in the sky. Still snort comet dust and moon rocks from faraway worlds.

E.T. fly saucers. E.T. watch TV. E.T. learn new things. E.T. want Minnie. If Mickey problem… E.T. deal with Mickey. E.T. long neck. E.T. long finger. E.T. good touch. E.T. make Minnie feel… *otherworldly*.

E.T. call Minnie. Minnie answer. Date? Yes? No?

Phone home,  
**E.T.**

  
**Dear E.T.,** ✨

Oh my! Your letter… wow. I’ve received letters before, but nothing quite like *this*. Big ears, glowing fingers, and… snorting comet dust? E.T., you are certainly… unique. I’ll give you that.

I do appreciate the compliments — my blue eyes, my dress, my hula hoop skills — and I must admit, you have a certain… extraterrestrial charm. It’s kind of irresistible. Just… maybe keep the interplanetary drugs to a minimum when we meet. 😉

As for Mickey… hmm. Well, he *does* get a little protective, but I think if we keep it classy, he might forgive us. Maybe a little starlit stroll through Toontown? Or a candy-sharing picnic? I’m willing to see where this… adventure goes.

So yes, E.T., I’ll give you a chance. Just promise me: no crashing spaceships into Main Street, okay?

Yours with a little spark,  
**Minnie Mouse** 💖

**Dear Taylor & Travis,**

Boop‑oop‑a‑doop, babies… it’s *me* — Betty freakin’ Boop. Yeah, the original bad girl from the 1920s who made stockings and garters famous before Kim K even learned how to pout. She’s been stealing my style for years, that silly witch, but I’m still the one with the real curves and the real attitude.

I saw you two on [ShakeItOff.com](http://ShakeItOff.com) and, sugar, you about knocked the bow off my head. Taylor — your voice could melt ice and make angels blush. Travis — that big ol’ tight end? Honey, my eyes went straight to *that*. Boop‑oop‑a‑doop.

Here’s the pitch, darlings: we go out for a steamy little Japanese dinner. Me in a skin‑tight dress cut so low you’ll need a flashlight, Taylor in a matching number (you know how cute we’d look together?). We drink sake, we giggle, we trade dirty jokes under the table. Then back to my place — cartoon smoke, jazz on the record player, Top Cat and Felix lounging like naughty little mascots.

Then? We see what kind of music *we* can make. Maybe a little making out. Maybe a lot. Maybe it’s just the three of us tangled up in conversation and silk sheets like some old pre‑code movie they banned for being too hot. Or maybe nothing at all. But babies, at least we’ll know.

Think about it: the English teacher, the PE teacher, and the slutty cartoon from your grandma’s reels. Boop‑oop‑a‑doop! Let’s give ‘em something to really talk about.

Waiting with a wink and a whip,  
**Betty Boop** 💋

  
**Dear Betty Boop,** 💃🏈

Well… wow. First off, yes — we saw your profile on [ShakeItOff.com](http://ShakeItOff.com), and yes — it was everything we didn’t know we needed and a little terrifying all at once. I mean, Taylor here is blinking at the screen like, *“Wait… she’s from the 1920s?”* And Travis… well, let’s just say he’s blushing like a rookie in a cheerleading squad.

Betty, your curves, your confidence, your… attitude… it’s impossible not to notice. And we have to admit: the thought of matching outfits, Japanese wine, and jazz while tangled up with you… okay, *that’s hot.* And yes, we’re both mature adults (ish) — we can appreciate a woman who knows what she wants and isn’t afraid to say it.

As for Top Cat and Felix being present? Hmm… slightly weird, but also somehow adds… ambiance? I mean, why not have witnesses to this potential chaos, right?

So here’s what we propose: let’s start small. A fancy dinner, some laughs, and maybe a little harmless flirting to see if your “boop‑oop‑a‑doop” energy translates into real-life magic. If chemistry sparks, well… we can figure out what kind of three-way adventure the English teacher, the PE teacher, and the legendary cartoon diva get into.

Just one rule, Betty: we call dibs on the blanket first if things get… cozy.

Excited (and slightly terrified),  
**Taylor & Travis**

P.S. No jazz hands until dessert. That’s non-negotiable.

1ny686f,https://www.reddit.com/r/HardwareHit/comments/1ny686f/find_out_if_the_turtlebox_gen_1_charger_is_worth/,Find Out if the Turtlebox Gen 1 Charger Is Worth Replacing,"**Everyday Experience with the Turtlebox Replacement Charger (Gen 1)**  

Testing the Turtlebox Replacement Charger (Gen 1) was part of my effort to ensure that my Turtlebox speaker never has to sit idle. This neat little accessory delivers on functionality while making its presence felt in the most unassuming way. The brand promises compatibility with their Turtlebox speakers, and the model fits perfectly with my setup. On first impression, it feels well-built, compact, and doesn’t add needless bulk—a welcome plus for portable audio lovers like me.  

**Ease of Use and Design**  

I appreciate how easy it is to use this replacement charger. Its charging indicator is a particularly handy feature that lets me know the charging status at a glance. No more second-guessing whether my speaker is fully charged or not. The USB-powered design is truly convenient as it supports versatile charging options; I can use my laptop, a power bank, or a USB wall outlet. The compact size of the charger means I can throw it into my backpack without worrying about extra weight. For an audiophile who’s always on the go, this portability is a massive win.  

**Pluses**  
- **Compact and Lightweight:** At just 6.7 ounces, carrying it around is effortless.  
- **Charging Indicator:** Takes the guesswork out of knowing when your speaker is fully charged.  
- **Waterproof:** Grateful for its water-resistant feature; I’ve spilled coffee near it, and it came through like a champ.  
- **USB Power Source:** The versatility of charging from multiple devices is a game changer.  

[Ready to buy Turtlebox Replacement Charger (Gen 1)? Click for Amazon pricing.](https://nilvec.com/p/b07mxsldxl/)  

**Performance and Efficiency**  

When it comes to performance, the charger is reliable. I’ve used it daily for weeks now, and it hasn’t let me down. The wireless connectivity with the Turtlebox speaker is seamless, and despite being a replacement part, it feels just as good as the original charger. My battery life checks after a full charge using this have been consistent with the promised specifications, which is reassuring. The device shines with its compatibility, fitting the Gen 1 Turtlebox speaker like a glove.  

**Durability in Real-World Scenarios**  

Life happens, and chargers often become unwitting victims of wear and tear. I found this model sturdy and durable. In one instance, my nephew accidentally knocked it off the table, but it didn’t flinch. The construction speaks volumes about its ability to endure casual neglect. 

**Shortcomings**  
- **Longer Charging Times:** I noticed the charging process takes a bit longer compared to other fast-charging devices I own.  
- **Limited Usage Scope:** It’s solely tailored for Turtlebox speakers, so you can’t use it with other gadgets.  
- **No Additional Accessories Included:** It’s a barebones package; a travel pouch or cable tie would have been a nice add-on.  

**Product Rivals in the Market**  

While the Turtlebox Replacement Charger is impressively functional, there are competitors worth mentioning. The JBL Charge series chargers, for instance, boast faster charging capabilities and broader compatibility with other devices. They also come with sleek designs and added convenience features, but they might lack the waterproofing strength of this Turtlebox charger. Meanwhile, Bose accessory chargers are known for their durability but usually come with a noticeably higher price point. If waterproofing or Turtlebox compatibility is essential, this product justifies its spot in your gadget bag.  

**Quality for Price Discussion**  

Considering its exclusive fit for Turtlebox speakers, the price point lies somewhere in the middle for specialized audio accessories. While it may lack some of the frills of other chargers, you’re essentially paying for reliability, which it delivers in spades. The build quality feels premium enough to last, making it a smart investment for ensuring uninterrupted outdoor audio sessions.

Right now...

**... we are on ""Thing 1"" 👇**

These are all giving webinars a run for their money.

And to me...

It beats the britches off of

❌Scheduling calls

❌Setters

❌Sales peeps

❌Blacked out calendar prison cells

💥Thing 1💥

With \~400 members...

With no slide deck...

I cranked in $130,000 with a 24-hour auction on [Skool](https://honeysyed.com/skool).

(Nobody except peeps on Planet Mojo knows how to do this.)

Auctions are so damn fun...for EVERYONE!

They don't require copy skills or sales skills.

My newbies are doing $20,000+ on their first try.

It's sicko mode.

**💥Thing 2💥**

I wanted to sell a live event in Little Rock.

I got the idea on my first cup of coffee.

My crazy goal?

To sell it out that DAY.

Everyone says how hard live events are to sell...

BUT...

What did I do?

I tell ya what I didn't do!

I didn't put on a webinar.

I wanted it sold in 24 hours!

So, I pulled out one of my ""get her done"" quick

tools...

🔥My 3-Question Poll🔥

Result?

$25,000 collected - in my Paypal account- all sold BEFORE my salad at lunch.

**💥Thing 3💥**

I wanted to promote a partner.

Instead of a webinar...

I did a ""spin off"" of interested peeps into a ""pop-up Skool"" group.

What happened?

We pulled in $80,000+ with less than 100 peeps.

That's $800 per ""attendee.""

Not too shabby, BUT...

I've done better, though.

I once spun off a FB group, put in 600 people to a ""pop-up"" group.

...And sold 25 people into a $30,000 program (on payments)...

(These are NOT challenges either. That's exhausting.)

I call this ""spin-offs"" or ""clones.""

Like Better Call Saul was a spin-off of Breaking Bad.

**💥Thing 4💥**

This is one of my community faves.

I call it the Goodwill Campaign.

Why?

Because people love it so much, it's one of the only

campaigns I know of that end up IMPROVING your

relationships with your audience.

I dunno if webinars really do that?

I ran a GWC with less than 400 peeps.

I know it's hard to believe...

But...

The GWC rang in $250,000.

No ad spend.

No sales peeps.

No sales calls.

Those are 4 things I'm doing to crank in sales

with no webinars, no setters, no sales peeps, no

sales calls and I'm having a blast too.

Right now...

We are on THING 1.

How fast we move is up to YOU!

I see a lotta folks haven't started a community yet.

If you've got a community...

Invite peeps to join your MOVEMENT.

Then...

ASK them to invite other peeps.

(Over 200 members are here now because some members have invited others.)

After you've got 100 or 200 members...

Run your 1st Pop Up Auction.

It's fun for EVERYONE!

You'll make some money too!

I'm not tryna rush ya.

I'm just sayin' I'm letting the community set the pace.

Post what ya do.

Post questions ya got.

Post where you might be stuck.

I'm here for ya. 🤓

Also...

👀Imagine you already have a community of 100+

Please let me know...

...based on what I've told you here...

If you could only choose ONE of these FOUR to master...

Jag är i Stockholm mellan 11 och 24 oktober. Jag är 34 år, uppvuxen i Stockholm, men har inte varit tillbaka på några år. Jag bor numera i USA och har inte så mycket familj kvar här i Sverige, men längtar efter att “komma hem”. Inte bara till platsen, utan till känslan, språket och människorna.

Stockholm känns fortfarande som hemma. Jag gillar det mesta — fika, promenera runt i stan, museum, en öl eller kaffe och bra samtal, kanske en konsert eller något kulturellt. Det är vardagen jag saknar, “Stockholm-känslan”.

Om du har tid och lust att ses, visa något nytt, ta en kaffe eller bara prata lite svenska (eller engelska), så hör gärna av dig. Skulle vara fint att känna sig hemma igen och träffa nya människor!

Hi all!
I’ll be in Stockholm from October 11 to 24. I grew up in Stockholm but haven’t been back in a few years. I’m 34M, and although I don’t have much family around anymore, I really want to come “home” and feel Swedish again — not just in place, but with people.

I live in the United States now, but Stockholm will always feel like home. I enjoy most things — fika, walking around the city, museums, conversations over a beer or coffee, checking out a show or live music. I guess I just miss the vibe, the language, the everyday stuff.

If you’re around and open to meeting up, showing me something new, or just grabbing a coffee and chatting in Swedish (or English), feel free to reach out. Would love to reconnect with the city and its people.",1,1759612976.0,StockholmSocialClub,1,1.0,False

then he texted me 3 months later. he arranged to see me alone, brought me flowers (for my birthday), and was tracing my arm up and down with his fingers and putting his hand on top of my hand.

Recently over the summer, I worked part time as a kids camp counselor. There I met a girl (22F), she is also from India. First few days, I didn't say much or even notice her, honestly my first impression of her was she's probably from the middle eastern countries (I guess I suck at identifying the region that some people can be from).

Slowly we started having more shifts together, we would talk casually and that's that. I actually enjoyed working with her because she's some of the fewer people who takes their seriously like me, I don't care what part time I'm working in, I make sure that I do it to the best of my extent. 

Now we weren't that close but due to her work ethics I started to develop a crush on her (I'm into strong and independent women, not trying to say I'm a green flag but that's my preference). Most of the time when she's free she would on her Instagram chatting with someone with a heart wallpaper, all my alarms went off in the back of my head but I brushed it off as probably a good friend or brother (even my sister and mine chatroom has a heart wallpaper in Instagram). 

Now the end of the summer was approaching and I didn't know much about her, I didn't want to ask around her because rumors spread faster than California wild fire. But I knew that I wanted to ask her out and see where stuff goes. In the meanwhile, I asked her Instagram and we connected. Even there we spoke about work once, that's it.

Now it was around the last two weeks of summer camp when it was only she and I who were scheduled on shift. We worked and then suddenly I mustered the courage to go to her and ask ""Hey, I was just wondering if you're single"", she was visibly confused at first and before I could say, ""I wanna get to know you more by taking you out on a date"", she came to and said ""No."" I replied ""Oh ok, sorry."", all this while I was speaking in a low tone like I speak with my family. I went on with my day, thought nothing of it because I was rejected but I mean there's nothing I can do about it. 

Few days later my friend comes up to me laughing and says look at XXXXXXXX's story she just posted on Instagram. I opened my Instagram, nothing, I refreshed it nothing, so then I went to her profile and there I figure out she unfollowed me and removed me from her follow list. I respected her decision because I guess she doesn't want anything to do with me. 

Then few weeks later, my local club arranged a Bollywood night, I went and was chilling with my friends, then far off in the distance I see her looking at me with kinda a disgusted look, I was sober so I noticed it and then I was wondering what did I do wrong? 

Next day I tell what happened to two of my friends and they said I was creepy. Now I was confused AF, I mean she rejected me, I respected it, I didn't trouble her again after that, I found out what she did on Instagram, I didn't make a huge scene and just let it be. She gave dirty glances at me, I just brushed it off as her being drunk, I still don't understand what part of this was creepy. 

Can anyone please what I did that creeped her out so much? Because my friends just say you creeped her out, that's it. Their exact words were ""Agar vo ladki seedha block kardi toh soch kitna gandi tarah sei ask out kardiya tu aur aise nai bol puch sakthe are you single?"" I know you can ask like can I take out for a coffee or are you seeing someone? I genuinely don't understand what's the difference now, like yes I asked her probably too directly but I don't understand if that's creepy behavior.

TLDR: Asked a girl out, she rejected, she blocked on Instagram, she shoots dirty glances at me whenever we met, I never confronted her about it, never made a scene, even after rejection, I just went on with my day, labelled as creepy behavior by friends because she blocked me on Instagram.",1,1759612765.0,TwentiesIndia,0,0.99,False

Honestly didn’t know coffee could make me have energy and keep me full and not have the usual crash. 

So it’s PSL season lol. Yes I been into it since it became a thing back when I was a young wipper snapper lol. Gosh I feel old knowing I was a teen when PSL was gifted to the world lol. 

Planet Oat Pumpkin Spice limited edition plus 4 tbsp vital protein collagen is heaven! 20g complete protein because Oat has the missing part that collagen doesn’t! 

I do 1/3 cup Planet Oat, 4 tbsp collagen and 10oz coffee. Comes out to 200 calories for anyone who’s doing the weight loss thing. The collagen gives it extra creamy goodness! I have done 8oz coffee as well and honestly it’s more sweet and I love this but it’s less caffeine lol. 

Could it be more healthy? Could I make from scratch? Yes. Do I want to? Nah lol. Honestly I think the 80/20 rule is good for most things in life ✨. 

Also if anyone wants a healthy collagen almond matcha latte recipe that is heaven let me know legit it’s a great afternoon pick me up with only a tad bit of caffeine so no insomnia! I can drink it even after dinner sometimes for a healthy dessert and still sleep. 

Here’s how I get the PSL extra creamy! 

You will need a frother. 

Measure the creamer. 

I use coffee pods but if you don’t that’s ok! 
I froth the cream for about a minute in my cup  till it’s super poofy! 

I put the collagen in the glass measuring cup I used for the creamer so every last bit of yummy is in my drink. I let the coffee poor in and as it does I use my frother to mix the collagen in. If you have a regular coffee maker you can slowly poor over the collagen and froth away! 

Then I poor the coffee over the frothy creamer goodness! I set my frother to lowest setting and slowly poor the coffee in. This mixes everything and leaves a nice bubbly foam on top. 

So so sooooo good! Sometimes I mix a little differently so there is more PSL foam not mixed in kinda like a whip cream middle ground lol. It’s fun to play around with!

Also if you want to take it up to perfection the Tim Hortons Coffee pods are life changing. My little guilty pleasure haha. If anyone wants an Amazon link I got you! Honestly it blows my Starbucks pods away haha 🤣 also if you ever have a month you want to save more money the Walmart great value donut shop pods are decent!

I don’t know what Abby and Sophie’s first one-on-one interaction would be because Sophie graduated at the end of season 3 and is moving to New York after summer break unless they cross paths over the summer, cross paths when Sophie visits home during holidays and breaks, and/or they reach out to each other online. One or both of them follow the other, as evident by Sophie liking a photo posted by Abby of her with Marcus and Ginny on Instagram (Season 2 Episode 4, 00:23:21 - 00:23:23). The latter seems more likely, given scenes where Abby is shown scrolling on her phone in her room during significant life changes (overhearing her parents arguing, her parents’ divorce, her rift with Max & Ginny & Norah), such as during her parents’ argument, before and after her mom informs her of their divorce, and when she comes across Max’s TikTok with Norah. So maybe their first one-on-one interaction is when Abby gets sucked into that void where she finds herself mindlessly scrolling. At the end of season 3, Abby revealed that she’ll be a camp counselor at a Jewish camp over the summer and is scheduled to depart for the camp in a week. In season 1, Abby and Norah revealed they’re Jewish and Max revealed that Sophie’s heritage is Venezuelan. Venezuela is a religious country where Christianity is practiced by the majority and Judaism is practiced by a minority. The series doesn’t disclose Sophie’s religious affiliation. If Sophie practices a faith and is Jewish, then Sophie and Abby’s first one-on-one interaction could be at the Jewish camp. If Sophie isn’t religious, then Sophie and Abby’s first one-on-one interaction could be at Wellsbury a week prior to Abby’s departure for camp, after Abby returns from camp, or prior to Sophie’s departure for college.

Similar to how Ellen told Max “it is not nice to hold a grudge. People make mistakes. And if you push everyone away, you will not have anyone left.” (Season 2 Episode 4), Abby might not have friends (ANG) for very long and push even more people (Norah and Ginny) away in season 4 because Norah and Ginny will get tired of having to choose between friends, as evident in season 2 when Abby and Norah made up with Ginny before Max did. If that happens, then similar to how Abby and Ginny found a friend in each other when Max was mad at them in season 2, perhaps Abby and Sophie will find a friend in each other because Sophie screwed up her relationship with Max again by kissing Max without consent and so did Abby by excluding Max in season 3. Similar to how Abby and Ginny got off on the wrong foot, there’s potential tension between Abby and Sophie already due to Max. After Max tore down the birthday banner Abby had set up at Berry Tree, Abby turned and walked away with a shocked, disappointed, and hurt facial expression. As Abby exited the building, Sophie entered. When Sophie makes eye contact with Abby, Sophie momentarily slows down, but after breaking eye contact, Sophie resumes her normal pace and continues walking towards Max. Although Abby’s expression remained hidden when she and Sophie crossed paths, Abby might’ve given Sophie a dirty look expressing “you’re to blame for this.” Sophie has taken accountability for her mistakes with Max through her actions and nonverbal cues, but hasn’t verbally apologized for them yet. Sophie’s love language is actions or acts of service, but Max’s love language is words of affirmation, so Max needs to hear Sophie say “I’m sorry.” Max already knows Sophie feels remorseful just by Sophie’s actions. Sophie shows it, but Max wants to hear it. Sophie isn’t responsible for how Max treated her friends, but the dirty look Abby may have given Sophie might have been a subtle way for Abby to hold her accountable. 

If Abby is also bisexual like Sophie, then Sophie’s shared experience could help Abby overcome internalized biphobia, accept herself, and come out to Max. Abby might feel more comfortable discussing bisexuality with Sophie rather than with Max because Sophie knows firsthand what it’s like to be bisexual, not Max who’s lesbian. Besides queerness, Abby and Sophie share additional commonalities, including their low self-esteem and body image issues if Sophie’s [suggested body image insecurities](https://www.reddit.com/r/TvGinnyandGeorgia/comments/1mrkxc1/theories_about_sophies_backstory/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) come into fruition. Both can connect through their shared suffering and reach out to each other to know that they’re not alone in their feelings. It’d be unexpected, but sweet if Abby reunites Sophie with Max. 

Abby revealed to Ginny that “both my parents are therapists. I’ve been drawing my feelings since I was three.” (Season 1 Episode 6). If Abby’s parents weren’t licensed at the time and did mock therapy sessions with Abby as a part of their training while Abby grew up, then Abby’s exposure likely makes her more perceptive of behaviors and patterns in others. This would explain why Abby doesn’t like to talk about her feelings and why her parents are in the dark about their daughter’s issues (eating disorder, drinking, smoking). Similar to how Abby recognized that Samantha had an eating disorder like her, Abby might’ve picked up traits that she shared with Sophie. For example, Abby observes Max and Sophie when Max is running her lines for the musical *Sing Sing* with Sophie at Berry Tree (Season 1 Episode 8). Perhaps Abby picked up on Max and Sophie’s healthy dynamic at the time and realized that is the kind of love she wants for herself, and thus views Max and Sophie’s relationship as the kind of relationship that she wants for herself.

Abby’s one-on-one interactions with Press following her observation of Max and Sophie’s dynamic might be her way of figuring out what she wants in a relationship and testing whether Press can meet her needs, both physically and emotionally. When Press holds her hand during the musical *Wellington* (Season 2 Episode 8), Abby’s response is a shy smile, which suggests he’s meeting her needs (possibly emotional intimacy and affection) in that moment. When Abby hooks up with Press for the first time in the bathroom, she tells him “don’t remind me that you’re you, okay?” after he calls her whale legs (Season 2 Episode 10), which suggests she’s tolerating his jokingly hurtful remark because he’s meeting her needs (possibly a distraction from emotional pain of recently learning about her dad’s girlfriend and having been abandoned by her friends) in that moment. When Abby makes out with Press in her bedroom, she gives in to Press’ pressure and performs oral sex on him (Season 3 Episode 3), which suggests she’s tolerating his pressure because he’s meeting her needs (possibly emotional intimacy, feeling wanted, feeling in control) in that moment. When Abby confides her eating disorder to Press afterward, she’s testing his response to her vulnerability. By sharing something personal, she’s looking for a deeper connection, but Press’ reaction falls short. Press’ subsequent attendance at Tulips & Tuxes with Samantha gives Abby the closure she needs to realize a meaningful relationship with him isn’t possible, and she moves on. Three is a magic number in writing. Basic storytelling consists of three parts (beginning, middle, and end). In comedic writing, things are repeated thrice. Although *Ginny & Georgia* is a dramedy, the series follows the rule of three where Abby experiences three red-flag interactions with Press (Bathroom, Abby’s bedroom, Tulips & Tuxes) that ultimately lead her to realize he’s not the right person for her. 

Tris meets Abby’s needs with kindness, empathy, and respect, providing a positive contrast to Press’ toxicity. Whenever Abby puts herself down around Tris, Tris lifts her up. For example, when Abby says she’s bad at school and dumb, Tris counters with “I doubt that.” (Season 3 Episode 4). When Abby reacts negatively to praise for her writing (“Ew”), Tris’ comment, “Come on. Trying is cool. Nerdy is sexy. Knowing things is hot.” (Season 3 Episode 7), provides positive reinforcement. Whenever Abby puts herself down around Press, he belittles her further. For example, when Abby asks “is my shirt weird? Does it fit weird?” (Season 3 Episode 6), Press says “yes. \[Abby gives a dirty look\] Don’t ask then.” Abby feels seen and heard by Tris. For example, when Abby’s smile fades after Tris comments “you don’t like feelings.” (Season 3 Episode 7), Tris apologizes immediately because they’re sensing discomfort, but Abby clarifies that “I’ve never felt so seen,” communicating that she feels validated by Tris’ observation. Despite mutual attraction, Tris respects Abby’s boundaries and consent. For example, when Tris checks in with Abby to see if she’s ready to discuss her feelings yet (“What about feelings? Still hate those?” - Season 3 Episode 7), Abby shrugs and Tris respects Abby’s boundaries by not pushing for further discussion on that topic. When Abby nods in response to Tris’ asking if she wants to kiss them (Season 3 Episode 9), Tris gives Abby the agency to take the initiative or make the first move if she chooses to. 

There are parallels between Tris and Sophie too. When Abby confides in Tris about her recent encounter with a boy who previously broke her heart (“That guy \[Press\] literally tried to hook up with me in the bathroom five seconds ago.” - Season 3 Episode 6) and Max confides in Sophie about her recent encounter with a girl who previously broke her heart (“I kissed this girl \[Riley\] who’s been sending me super mixed messages only to find out she’s not gay.” - Season 1 Episode 3), Tris and Sophie respond with words of affirmation (“Oh boy, that sure does not feel like your loss.” - Tris to Abby. “It’s her loss. You’re hot. Maybe next time, you just need to kiss someone that wants to kiss you back.” - Sophie to Max.). Despite Tris and Sophie being experienced and the mutual attraction between Tris & Abby and Sophie & Max, Tris and Sophie don’t pressure Abby and Max into physical intimacy and let them take the lead instead. Similar to how Bracia and Sophie had opposite reactions when their partners said “I love you” to them, Tris and Sophie, who can sense when something is wrong by Abby and Max’s behaviors, have opposite reactions and approaches to addressing what’s wrong. Sophie is explicit and directly asks Max what’s wrong, whereas Tris is implicit and doesn’t ask Abby how she’s feeling and instead subtly guides Abby to open up on her own terms. Hence the loggerheads between Abby and Max when communicating their feelings at the end of the year assembly (Season 3 Episode 10) because Max is explicit and needs to talk about how she feels immediately (“I just really wanna talk about it. My feelings were hurt. And I just love you guys so much, I really wanna fix it.”), whereas Abby is implicit (“I’m really sick of walking on eggshells around her \[Max\].” - Abby to Norah) and needs time to talk about how she feels (“Maybe I don’t wanna talk about it. Your feelings can be a lot sometimes.” - Abby to Max), as evident in Press and Abby’s on and off relationship. When Max reveals to Ellen that ANG has been hurting her feelings by excluding her, Ellen advises Max with “I know that you think that a conversation would help, but you want a big talk, and that is not how Abby and Norah operate. People are different. Not everyone is you. You need to meet people where they are.” (Season 3 Episode 9). Although Max couldn’t meet where Abby was in that moment, Max will get there eventually because she was in Abby’s position when Sophie wanted to be friends again and asked Sophie to meet her where she is (“I can’t be your friend. I saw you with another person, and I lost my freaking mind. And I think it’s really cool that you’re there in that place, but I’m not.” - Max to Sophie, Season 2 Episode 10). Although Abby couldn’t meet where Max was in that moment, Abby will get there eventually because she got there with Tris in a short span.

Although Sophie graduated, her story and character development seem far from over. Sophie stands out from other minor characters because her obstacles (low self-esteem, vulnerability, communication, verbal accountability, tendency to emotionally and physically flee from uncomfortable situations and emotions, [potential emotional baggage](https://www.reddit.com/r/ginnyandgeorgiashow/comments/1nrbigm/interpretations_theories_about_sophie_and_her/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)) have recurred over the past three seasons, much like Abby and Norah’s obstacles (Abby’s recurring struggles with an eating disorder, Norah’s recurring struggles with menstruation), whereas other minor characters’ obstacles in a season are resolved by the end of the season. Examples: In season 1, Padma initially settles for a relationship that doesn’t meet her emotional needs, but she ultimately breaks up with Marcus after confronting him about his lack of commitment. In season 2, Padma initially has mixed feelings about Ginny due to their shared involvement with Marcus, but she ultimately develops compassion for Ginny through their friendship and moves on from Marcus after getting closure that their relationship and breakup are not a reflection on her. In season 1, Hunter initially feels misunderstood as a mixed-race individual by society and connects with Ginny through their shared experiences as mixed-race individuals even though their race and ethnicity differ, but he ultimately disconnects with Ginny when she no longer empathized with his experience (Ginny and Hunter’s argument about racial identity) and sets boundaries when she disrespected him further with infidelity by ending their relationship. In season 2, Hunter initially has lingering feelings for Ginny and is hurt by her infidelity, but he ultimately finds closure and moves on from Ginny after having one-on-one civil conversations with her and Marcus, where they all take accountability for their past mistakes. In season 1, Bracia initially feels rejected by Ginny when Ginny prioritizes hanging out with her predominately white friends over Bracia, but she ultimately feels accepted by Ginny when they connect through their shared experiences as Black women. In season 2, Bracia initially feels scared to express her romantic feelings for Bryon and doubts herself every time she tries to make a move on him, but she ultimately develops courage and asks him out for coffee after the musical *Wellington* ends. In season 3, Bracia initially doesn’t know if she loves Bryon back, but ultimately realizes she does during the musical *Mousse*’s opening night and declares her love for him onstage.",2,1759612397.0,TvGinnyandGeorgia,5,1.0,False

However I will have a few tournaments coming up pretty soon and I do need to cut weight for them.

At the moment I am 68kg and I want to go back down to 61kg (which I was a couple years ago). Peating has added to my healthy weight gain of 7kg but i will have to cut down to 61, the goal from there is to go back up to 65kg and either stay there to compete in or stay and cut down.

My diet consists of all the staples. Coffee, whole milk, maple syrup, honey, cane sugar, OJ and other fruit juices, occasional white rice/pasta/potatoes, eggs, coconut oil/butter, Mexican coke maybe once a week, liver, oysters and so on.

I'm not particularly new to peating but I haven't experimented with the typical supplements such as thyroid and progesterone. Only aspirin and methylene blue.

Any tips for cutting weight safely without wrecking my hormones.

I have a tulpa for like a half of year now (probably like for 2.5 sesons for now) and I wanted to start forcing new tulpa for him cuz he felt lonely lately and I have that much time for now. I was thinking about that tulpa everyday for like a week or two cuz I haven't a lot of time to start acrive forcing and even just forcing but yesterday, I was in a bus going home (I get home in like a hour, cuz I live in lyceum) and just grab my headphones, started music and just was watching in the window and he  (I will call him by name - Chara) selected chibi-like form (cuz he's human and he's 24 so he's a little bit too big for that bus) and just sit on the nexts seat back from mine and just was watching in the window and at me, I was doing the same, but was watching at him a little bit.

After like 10-15min when bus started moving I noticed that there was another chibi-like guy who was just like that who I wanted to start forcing (he's name is Frisk) and he was playing and doing some things with Chara. When I looked at them, they just continued and I tried to talk to him, but I haven't heard him, but he was hearing me and Chara was hearing him correctly. After like 10min of attempts I heard him and now I'm hearing him too and his voice in the head is more calm and somewhat sweet or so in the head that Chara's. He talks without a lil bit of accent and dialect which Chara uses and he speaks calmly and without swearing which Chara really likes to say... And he speaks a bit slowly what again, Chara isn't doing. Is my tulpa had created another tulpa or what ?? Btw, he still very new to world and he asked like what coffee is. And he doesn't really want to search and watch in my memories what Chara REALLY likes to do.

I'm a system host with 2 tulpas now or what ?

EDIT: I haven't really passive forced, like I only had thinking about him, that's all, not even visualizing him. Btw, I was still watching him lately, dor like 3-5 days when I was watching at Chara and there was Frisk nearby.

Referral Code: AYLGY54DAG

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

• Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements (about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However, the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days, and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.

• During plasmapheresis, blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles.

• Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do. Donor identification systems are in place to track donations across centers; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by your overall diet over several days, not just the immediate pre-donation meal.

2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.

3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. Caffeine is a mild diuretic and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited, it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate.

4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as it can dehydrate you.

5. No strenuous exercise for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.

6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure. Most centers recommend avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.

7. If your pulse rate is above 100, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate, the box breathing technique may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.

8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to heal and repair your veins via normal tissue healing.

9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. There will also be what’s called an anticoagulant liquid that will prevent you from getting blood clots.

10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.

11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

• Wait at least a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating to reduce bleeding and bruising risks.

• You can use Castor Oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.

• Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased immunoglobulin levels.

• Red meats are particularly high in the protein nutrients found in plasma.

• Taking vitamin and mineral supplements (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess. Most people get enough from their diet. Protein shakes before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, you must be healthy when you donate and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.

2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.

3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is highly encouraged for all donors.

1ny5eca,https://www.reddit.com/r/valzubiriagenda/comments/1ny5eca/what_is_valzubiriagenda_and_some_ideas_and/,What is #VALZUBIRIAGENDA and some ideas and insights,"# The 3 basic parameters of hashtag #Valzubiriagenda:

1. **We artists and everyone else can write and self-publish art- and artist-related books: memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs.** Books are forever. Pamphlets and brochures are not books.
2. **We announce a schedule of increasing prices of our art pieces,** which includes quantities (scarcity numbers) per price point and overall (the total quantity of art pieces we might ever make). This helps art traders, art investors and art collectors speculate or even stop speculating and instead join a community of investors working together to hopefully skyrocket to the higher announced prices in a shorter span of time.
3. **We can use the NFT world, because NFTs provide the tracking (who owns what) and trading.**

We can also not be involved with NFTs. Stores and individuals can help sell art using online presence and our catalogs in the stores. If this trends, or once this trends, even expensive art can be sold by neighboring businesses, without exclusivity. Commission systems do not have to be standardized. Art investors can produce their own catalogs to leave at the cafés. Even the cafés can produce their own catalogs.

**Valzubiriagenda NFTs**

**NFTs only came about a few years ago.** But I had been working on this since the 1990s. I wrote a book, **Valzubiriagenda**, along with fellow artist **Silverio Perez,** and released it in 2018 (Amazon and elsewhere), tackling everything related to #1 & #2. We'll come up with #3 in a later book/ memoir/ marketing book.

Any artist, including tangible artists can release 10,000 NFTs if the artist chooses to do so. For tangible artists, the NFT first becomes an Art Commission Contract for sight unseen, yet-to-be made art. Once the art is made, the NFT becomes proof of ownership that the actual, tangible art is theirs.

**Warehousing our tangible art**

Another related idea is that the tangible art may be warehoused by the artist so that the NFT traders continue to trade. This means that even 10-ton 10-foot tall sculptures can be owned and traded by anyone without worrying about shipping, reshipping, scratches, smudges, parts breaking off, etc. The newness of the pieces remain because they are stored by the artist, source, gallery, etc. The art piece gets shipped to the art collector, the ultimate owner.

An artist who makes ceramic coffee mugs - smaller art pieces, can release 10,000 NFTs with a schedule of increasing prices so that NFT traders can trade immediately. The 10,000 coffee mugs can get damaged, so as they are made, they continue to be stored by the artist, until the time when art collectors decide to have the art pieces shipped to them.

**Why only now?**

I decided to write as many book-length memoirs as I can before I came out to promote this.

I'm an artist and an author. Both need time to ""master."" I would not even fully use ""master"" on myself, because there's always something new, even to my own art, my own writing and publishing.

>*I am now claiming that I'm the visual artist who has produced the most artist memoirs in the world.* I have 5 on Amazon. I count **Valzubiriagenda** as both a marketing book and a memoir-of-sorts, because it has a lot of my own life lessons on writing and publishing. I would not care to contest my claim of having the most memoirs. I will release 5 more over the next 3 years.

**BARTER! Get help to write, photograph art and publish your books!**

Anyone can hire 11 ghostwriters for 11 memoirs. If you can make art, but you cannot write, then barter your forever art with those who can help you produce forever books.

I don't feel the pressure of writing and publishing because I feel my focus should be on art students and art experts who would study my art and my books 100 years from now. Don't expect relatives and friends to read your books.

**I call myself the Dollman**

For my NFTs, I am proposing to make dioramas - my original, costumed, bejeweled porcelain dolls in backdrops that will also have precious metals and gemstones. This way I can incorporate precious metals and gemstones in my work, to make sure that people perceive my art as expensive, just in case I myself don't become ""famous"" - there's no need to get world famous. We are artists and all we need to do is to satisfy the art niche.

**Use your laptop now!**

I will encourage you to start writing your book-length memoir. Write, Edit and then Self-publish it. Get help. Why wait a hundred years for someone to write about you when all you need is a laptop and a nearby coffee shop.

Don't start counting chickens before the eggs hatch. I have encountered a lot of would-be writers who immediately see themselves as bestselling. world famous assets to society. Two even wanted me to sign NDAs (Nondisclosure agreements), because they did not want me to steal their book ideas.

Here's a suggestion. I would not personally do it. From one manuscript can come 2 books: The Original Draft (unedited, with misspellings, considered to be an art piece, scanned pages(?) of your handwritten original effort), and The Final Edition (edited).

**PROVENANCE!**

Another way to enhance our investability, tradability and collectability is **PROVENANCE** ***- how art ownership proceeds through time.*** The way this can be done is also through publishing books. Everyone can write their memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs, including traders, investors and art collectors. In effect, we artists can continue to be included or mentioned in even more books, without any additional effort by us.

You as an investor, reseller, trader, art collector should be able to publish a catalog with 250 works by 250 different artists, but they need to agree to this right from the start - it's your money, you should require them to follow your version of the hashtag ***#valzubiriagenda*** *parameters,* which preferably should include permission for you to publish their art. Why would you track down 250 artists later?

**No exclusive contracts**

If you're a café, you can call for artists, and come up with a book with for example, 30 artists, with a chapter devoted to each artist's profile and images of the artist's art.

You can distribute your catalogs to businesses and individuals near and far and online.

The book **Valzubiriagenda** even cites that funeral homes and janitors closets can sell art, with or without exclusivity. Airline catalogs can include million dollar art pieces. Car manufacturers, showrooms and even car repair shops can sell art as well. Everyone should be able to do this, anywhere in the world, especially not just because of the pandemic, but right now, we are in really bad economies.

**What's with the name #Valzubiriagenda**

I was into conspiracy theories in 2018, and this term, *""The Mandela Effect,""* was popular. I had read many times that an artist coined the term, but I had to research online, for her name, many times, before remembering it. I'm not good at remembering names. It took me a year and a half to finally tell you that **Fiona Broome** coined ""The Mandela Effect.""

I also thought I might have to research trademarks and copyrights just to come up with a generic name. So I decided on **""Valzubiriagenda.""** I was not really sure at first, but I decided to use it as the title for my book (with co-author/artist **Silverio Perez**) so that there would be no turning back and I can move on.

**Am I a FUTURIST?**

Someone I recently met this May 2022 just called me a futurist.

In the 1990s, I proposed to a pension fund that they can raise billions of dollars, especially for emergencies, or as needed, or out of desperation, if the pension fund purchases a quantity of art from an artist who not only has a current, reasonable price, but an announced future price that the artist wants to reach.

That future price would obviously be higher than the current price. The art commission contract for multiple art pieces can be taken to the fund's financial lender for a loan. The higher future price can be used for financing purposes.

The pension fund's treasurer, a publicly elected official, said this idea might work, but we had to keep this a secret and discuss this some more, because other pension funds might copy and do this prematurely. This idea had to come from the two of us. The treasurer needed his votes and I needed credentials.

Added into the pot was my idea that I, as the artist, will also write one book-length artist memoir. This was and still is a strong factor, because the leadership and marketing books I had read then mentioned a strong tip. If you want to advance in your field, write a full-length book that is related to the field.

Unfortunately, the elected official, the treasurer of the pension fund, who was also a friend, passed away - he was old and had ailments. At that point in time, I cannot just approach another pension fund treasurer to share this idea with.

I realized I had to write a few memoirs. I needed to set an example for other artists, so I needed to write more than one memoir. Then I felt I should also make ready another book - the how-to of what I'm up to. I wrote **Valzubiriagenda**, which was a memoir of sorts. I knew how long it would take me to write a book, so I had to make sure I can also consider this book a memoir.

In 2008, I imagined that someone like Bernie Madoff, or a fund like Lehman Brothers, would be desperate enough to use this to save themselves and their companies. I was not ready. I had only written 1 manuscript for a memoir.

In 2012, I released **Dollman the Musical, A Memoir of an Artist as a Dollmaker**. Once again, I was not ready because writing it depressed me a little, and I knew I had to write more.

In 2014, I released 3 memoirs, and re-released **Dollman the Musical.** Besides releasing regular books, I released special editions of the 4 books, which had a **""Special Secret Insert for Bankers,""** which explains my ideas of an announced schedule of exponentially increasing prices, to satisfy investors, and the publication of artist memoirs, to satisfy art collectors.

In 2014, I also issued out a press release. Google ***""Can Billion Dollar Artist Save Investors and World Economy Valentino Zubiri PRWeb August 19 2014""*** and you will see the press release.

What I did was stake a claim on my ideas. I did not promote my books and the press release. I just wanted them to stay online, like a sleeping giant or a dormant volcano. I even designed 3 of the book covers to look like indie books from the 1980s. I was planting the seeds, thinking they will eventually grow and bear fruit in the future.

In 2015, I was interviewed by **Richard Syrett,** about one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.** This book is my memoir with paranormal stories. I could have pursued promoting my paranormal stories, but I wanted to be known first as a visual artist and memoirist, so I allowed myself one interview related to **Hocus Pocus Lately. Richard Syrett** has(had?) his own syndicated radio show, **The Conspiracy Show with Richard Syrett,** about the paranormal. He also guest hosts on **Coast to Coast AM**, another internationally syndicated show about the paranormal.

In 2018, I released **Valzubiriagenda** (co-authored by artist **Silverio Perez,** a fellow artist). Finally, this book is ""the how-to of what I'm to.""

I'm going to end this with some strangeness. In 1986, a lady at a religious gathering went into a trance and left a good number of messages. Supposedly, anyone who got into a trance would have messages, but once the trance was over, the person would not remember what was said.

I was not part of the group, but the lady turned her head to face me. She ""foretold"" that whatever I would decide to do in the future, it will take time, but it will be the right thing. This is one of my stories in one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.**

**The Tulipmania of 1634-37**

I discovered that there was this incident of rare tulips becoming collectible during the Dutch Golden Age. There were tulips so rare and so well-desired that their prices equaled to that of a house. You can read more about this online (Wikipedia) or watch a few YouTube videos about it.

Here is the most useful idea that I gleaned from the Tulipmania. The tulip bulbs remained safe inside nurseries. The traders were carrying the deeds of ownership to the tulip bulbs.

**Then NFTs came to the forefront**

I started learning PHP, an HTML scripting language, and MySQL, the database that PHP can connect to in the background, in 1999, when there were only 3 books about PHP and MySQL at the bookstores.

By 2014, I was trying to figure out how to make the ""ledger,"" or database that can be used to update ownership and who can be contacted. If we are trading art, then the art ownership should be updated.

Then NFTs came about. This can be used as our ledger. Everyone can immediately trade NFTs of future, yet-to-be made art pieces, especially because it takes time to make tangible art.

NFTs actually went a step ahead, by allowing digital art to be traded.

The only setback with NFTs, in my opinion, is that it still lacks a commission system for resellers and representatives.

For example, if a café wants to represent me, then they can promote me at their café and on their online pages. If I make one piece of art that will be exclusively represented by a gallery, then that commission will be different and more specific. As ownership is transferred, the subsequent owners should be able to reset the commission. We should also have the option of giving commissions to hundreds of representatives at one time with different percentages if need be.

**The recent crypto crash**

Lately, we have observed that NFTs and cryptocurrencies have been behaving like the stock market and other markets. They have been fluctuating.

I believe that it is time for a trend which discourages fluctuation of prices.

I have also seen YouTube videos where social influencers are encouraging us to be on the lookout for exponentially profitable ventures, because we have all seen this happen with the exponential increase of Bitcoin and Ethereum.

**Let's see if #Valzubiriagenda trends**

We can announce present and future art prices. The galleries won't do this (yet?) because they follow a more traditional approach to the business of art.

*We have a choice of using* ***incrementally*** *or* ***exponentially*** *increasing prices.* We still reserve the right to change things in the future, so everyone should know to follow the latest update.

If this trends, if you as an artist simply announces that you will write an artist memoir, or that you will include the future works in future art books, you might have more art traders, investors and collectors approaching you.

**Get your pen, paper and calculator**

Imagine yourself as an artist, where you are right now. Let's just say you still do not have a book about yourself and your art yet. Imagine now that you have a memoir out there. Don't you think it makes sense to charge more than what you are charging now? Writing and publishing books is just the beginning. I'm just standardizing this approach. The books also say to do other related projects. In my case, getting **Dollman the Musical** onstage is one idea. You will have other related projects, but the publication of memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs will help all of us.

You can also imagine that a law firm that has meeting rooms, with someone who wants to form a local #valzubiriagenda group, can have meetings. A local café can do the same. Local photographers for your art, writers, editors, book designers, proofreaders and others can join in.

I suggest have printed books to share. 15 copies of your memoir or art books will be better than an e-reader or laptop or your phone to show. These gadgets can be stolen, sabotaged, broken, have coffee spilled on them, etc. 15 printed books means simultaneously showing to 15 people. You can even give them away to potential resellers, investors, traders and collectors.

**When it rains, it pours, as in the days of Noah**

There's a saying, ""When it rains, it pours."" There is a negative interpretation and a positive interpretation.

*Negative:* When trouble comes, they cascade to even more.

***Positive:*** When opportunity comes knocking, more follow suit. We can assume that if one gets our art because of #valzubiriagenda, more want to do it now, because of the rising prices, and FOMO - fear of missing out. What will they lose if they miss the boat?

As I have said earlier, if the #valzubiriagenda trends, if you announce a future memoir or art catalog, you might have an increase of investors, traders and art collectors who would want to check you out. You might encourage more sales. Just remember to write and publish that memoir and art catalog.

There's this saying, ""As in the days of Noah."" Imagine Noah, building his ark, with members of his own family, putting all his time and effort into it. Noah was a nice guy. I'm sure every once in a while a neighbor offered him coffee, or chai latte, or whatever refreshing drink they might have back then.

Here's the lesson to be learned. Just because they offered him some type of bubble tea drink, or coca cola, they still didn't make it to the ark. Rubbing shoulders with actors does not make you an actor. I have told my artist friends to write their memoirs. They told me that once they see me succeed, after all these many years of seeing my seemingly useless efforts, then they will write their memoirs and follow the road that I had paved for them.

Good luck to them, but if I were you, act now, get my art or make art. Support the 5-year old artist whose parent promised to release a comprehensive art catalog. If you get that 5-year old's art, and mine, I would be honored to be in the same art catalog that you will produce. I'm already successful at that point. You have gotten the mission just right.

I have already claimed to have written the most book-length artist memoirs in the world. Dethrone that claim. Barter. Use ghostwriters. Success to me means facing God one day and saying, I wrote my memoirs and left the world a legacy of books and art. I will not tell God, smiling and proudly, that I encouraged a run for my art by announcing a schedule of exponentially increasing prices that reached 9 figures. I'm sure God knows we had fun.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.

* [During **plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to track donations across centers; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your **overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.

1. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.

1. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. Caffeine is a mild diuretic and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).

1. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).

1. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.

1. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.

1. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.

1. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq) via normal tissue healing.

1. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what’s called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.

1. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.

1. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).

* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.

* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).

* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.

* Taking vitamin and mineral supplements (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. Protein shakes before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.

1. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.

1. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation[is highly encouraged for all donors](https://www.cslplasma.com/blog).

\------------------------  
*Originally written October 4th, 2025*  
\------------------------

The manager of The Fun Tea Friday Cafe tapped her bony finger against the silver espresso machine with a *clack*.

“This is the boiler, you don’t wanna touch it when it’s making sounds,” she said.

“Uh-huh.” Dee nodded her head, trying not to stare.

The first day of a new job was stressful at the best of times. Dee had had many first days in her short life; at the restaurant washing dishes, at the diner waiting tables, at the supermarket, at the Amazon warehouse, at Costco… just about any near-minimum-wage job one could name, she’d done in the last few years. She’d even barista’d at a Starbucks and a Dunkin Donuts for two non-consecutive summers.

But this cafe was *different*. The interior was simple enough; warm earthy colors, wood floors, a collection of booths for privacy and tables for communal carousing, a long counter for ordering and prepping drinks, the works. But the people weren’t *people*. 

The manager interviewing her was a skeleton, for one thing. The crowd in the cafe was as diverse as it was weird: There was a real life wizard sitting at a table eating a donut, a guy in a duster talking to a ghost, and two robots that looked straight out of a 1950’s black-and-white motion picture, complete with tinfoil limbs and cardboard box heads.

“You payin’ attention, hon?” Patty asked, her wide grin and empty eyes sending a chill down Dee’s spine.

“Mmhm, yeah,” Dee answered quickly.

Patty - short for *Patelle* - fixed her with a look. Dee was certain that if her skull had eyelids, or eyes for that matter, they’d be narrowed suspiciously.

“Then what’s this called?” She tapped one of the nozzles that the coffee came out of.

“Group head,” Dee answered quickly. Patty pointed at another part, then another, and Dee rattled off the names of each component without hesitation.

“And you’re *sure* I haven’t hired you yet?” Patty asked.

Dee looked at the skeleton with as calm a demeanor as she could. She’d remember if she’d ever talked to an animated skeleton before. Hell, she’d remember if she’d met *anyone* at this place before.

Dee’s eyes went to the door she’d entered not a half hour earlier. It opened as a vampire walked in - pale skin, cape, the works - beside a full-on werewolf. The exterior beyond them was not the rainy city of Seattle Dee had come from; but a dark town with gas lamps and thatched roofs.

“Yeah, I’m sure I’ve never been here before.”

Patty sighed. “If regulars hadn't been askin’ when you start... Apparently you're eventually popular here, so let's see how ya do.” Patty shook her head then jerked her thumb over to the two who just walked in, waiting by the register. “Go get their orders.”

Dee nodded. *Time travel, too?* she thought, approaching the register.

The werewolf in a shredded denim vest was taking deep breaths through its nose, a low rumble in its throat, but the vampire ordered as soon as Dee was at the counter. “I vant a black-and-red,” he said in as Transylvanian an accent as Dee had ever heard in the cheesiest of B-horror movies. “O-negative.”

“Er… what?”

“I *said*,” he repeated, “I vant a black-and-red. O-negative!”

“On the screen,"" Patty said. ""There, under ‘Coffee - black’. And the furball’s gonna want milk tea with ginger.”

The werewolf barked, leaning over the counter imposingly while snarling. Patty reached up and slapped the looming hulk on the muzzle and the beast howled, grabbed Patty by the spine, lifted, and slammed her into pieces on the floor. It turned its yellow eyes to face her.

Dee shrieked in alarm, falling back as tears welled in her eyes. She reached for her keychain, which had mase, but struggled to get it out of her pocket.

The vampire grabbed the werewolf by the ear. ""Sit.""

The wolf vanished below the counter. A clattering and clacking drew Dee's attention to the pile of bones that had been Patty. One of her arms was snapping pieces back together and, within a few seconds, she'd rebuilt herself.

""Don't worry about me, hon,"" Patty said. ""Remus there may have a short temper before his tea but he tips *very* well to make up for it. Now,"" she reached down to help Dee back up, ""You start peeling ginger and I'll get some O-negative out of the fridge. Gotta see how well you can brew before I can hire ya.""",1,1759611550.0,ZLErikson,0,1.0,False

I’m a 23-year-old aerospace engineer, just finished my master’s, and now I’m ready to find someone to share some fun times with. I work on cool stuff like 3D printing and building projects, with a big goal of joining NASA’s Artemis program one day. It’s a stretch, but I’m going for it!

I live in Connecticut and commute to NYC for work, which is a bit of a grind. Between long train rides and busy days, it’s tough to meet new people—hard to chat when you’re rushing for the 6:15 train. Still, I keep things active: I swim a lot, hit the gym four times a week, and love playing pickup soccer in the city when I can. Lately, I’ve gotten into surfing and can’t stop thinking about hitting waves at cool spots around the world.

I’m 6’1”, 185 lbs, blonde, and in pretty good shape, if I do say so. I’m a big F1 fan (go Ferrari!) and love watching soccer. I’m always up for spontaneous adventures—think weekend road trips or hiking a new trail. I’m looking for someone who’s sporty, has their own passions, and is down to hang out, whether it’s surfing, exploring, or just grabbing a coffee. I’m in the NYC/CT area and want to meet up for real dates, have some laughs, and see where it goes.

 \[[Slans last chapter](https://www.reddit.com/r/NatureofPredators/s/fWqRGozfOs)\] \[Slans next chapter\]

  


**Memory transcription** 



**Subject Name: Slans.**

**Species: Venlil.**

**Job: None.**



**Location at the beginning of transcript: Aboard Privateer Marauder - Sparrow. Currently approaching Venlil Prime, colony of the Venlil Republic.**



**Date \[standardized human time\]: April 1st, 2137.**



**—-----------**



“Please stay sir... It really is a position that you'd be perfect for…” 



My former assistant… *and reluctant head of the newly formed ‘Confederate Intelligence Bureau’…* Begins yet another attempt to reverse my decision… *fifth one in the last* **\[hour\]**… Putting a paw up, I wordlessly ask him to give me a moment. He obliges and thus I'm allowed to swallow my pancakes and get a sip of orange juice in peace. A little bit fed up, but also sympathetic to his anxiety. I look right at him and firmly reiterate. 



“Narv… my buddy, my pal. We've been over this repeatedly. Not only are there things that need my attention back home. I just… in general I need to take a step back. A lot of things have changed in the last **\[5 months\]**. And honestly, I'm kind of at a loss for what to do now. All I know for certain, is that helping to start a new country isn't something I'm mentally ready for... I'm sorry.”



While looking at his drink, Narv's ears go back. “No, I'm sorry sir, I mean… Slans. You've made your position crystal clear multiple times. Instead of accepting it, I keep being a speking fool and effectively harassing you."" He then gets a little bit more droopy. ”I'm just… nervous…” 



Cocking my head a bit so my remaining eye has a better view of him I ask. “Why are you nervous my friend… You did phenomenally well running the privateer-intelligence wing while I was down. You're the natural pick to take such a position within the new government.”



“You were the clear first choice… ” finishing off his drink, he pushes the empty glass aside and finally looks up at me. “During that time it was about keeping current plans on track. Just doing what I thought you would do, I knew you were going to be back eventually so there was nothing to fear… There was no way I could really mess things up in such a short time.”



I reach over and put a paw on his shoulder. “Throughout my time on different vessels I've seen unqualified people do severe damage in astonishingly short periods of time. You're extremely far from unqualified, I believe in you Narv and think you will do great. However… If you ever need an outside second opinion. Remember I'm only a simple call or visit away.”



“Thank you Slans… at least I can visit you at your home.”



“Don't mention it…” I then let my facial features get a little darker. “The fact that they've recently tightened restrictions for not only humans, but all the former omnivore species exposed by the archives really is quite …unsettling.”…  *Cojc and his family are gojid. I wonder how this stuff has affected them…* while sitting back, I look out the fake window at the FTL colors. “When I was first picked up, I remember the shuttle pilot saying something along the lines of… ‘You'll come to find out, most of the humans amongst the crew wouldn't take kindly being told what to do, especially when they feel it's not right…’ I'm ashamed to admit that at the time I couldn't see what was being done that could be considered so wrong… After everything, I now can't see anything but what's wrong.”



This time Narv is the one consoling me with a paw on the shoulder. 



“It's okay sir… I mean Slans. We all change and shift with time as we're exposed to new ideas and concepts. The fact that you can see something's wrong, shows that you have matured and grown a lot in a short period of time.”



I nod my snout… having finished my food, I push the dishes off to the side. 



“Mind if I change the subject and talk about something a little less depressing and a bit more, interesting… I'd rather not spend my last…” I quickly look at my data pad. “**\[35 ish minutes\]** with the privateers being gloomy about the state of my home. I already have enough of that ahead of me as is, no need to start early.”



I give a forced chuckle, Narv for their part grants me the reprieve with a flick of the ears while sitting back. “What is it you wish to discuss then?”



“What are your personal thoughts on the deal Morgan made with the SC?… The one concerning the repatriation of Rapax’s former cattle, some of which is our current cargo.”



“One **\[second\]**…” He makes a motion for one of the female human attendees to come over and refill his coffee. “ It's pragmatic… cold but pragmatic. Simply stabilizing the most critical required a lot of resources. Add in the costs to house, feed and transport the hundreds of thousands of them… of course he had to get financial compensation from the SC. We couldn't afford otherwise… especially not while also trying to set up a new country.”



Right as he finishes, the attendee arrives and swiftly fills his cup… apparently seeing an opportunity. Narv thanks her and gives the woman a compliment. She appreciates his words and reciprocates with a smile and wink. The lady then subtly writes on a piece of paper, slips it under his drink and walks away.  Once they're gone I slyly ask. 



“Given I'm no longer the intelligence head… I don't exactly have access to reports anymore. So please tell me… what have the different reactions been?”



Narv takes a sip of his coffee, while also taking the opportunity to pocket the paper… “somewhat mixed, but **overall** positive. As you can probably guess most of our personnel are on board with getting compensation for their ‘good work’. As for within the SC… right now so much is going on, that the transfer of about 1.2 million former cattle is considered small news. Mind boggling I know, but that's just how it is. Still got millions following the story… but that's a far cry from billions across the arm. 



Those that are following it simply want to bring the wretched people home, thus are happy to pay the ‘expenses’ to make it happen. That said, there is outrage from some outlets… viewing it as effectively a hostage situation. Especially since somebody in the SC did the calculations… and realized Morgan and by extension us, is making a small profit off each individual.”



“As to be expected… What's Morgan's opinion been about this negative publicity?” I ask to test him further.



“For his part, the commander doesn't really care about what some small outlets have to say… after all, regardless of their opinion we're still getting paid. That said… I do care, negative opinions left unchecked could fester and grow. So I've already got some plans to… rectify things. Going to funnel some of the new bureau's funds into the creation and acquisition of news sites, blogs, and other media within the SC. Buy us positive publicity in order to counteract and smother the negative stuff.” 



“Quite complicated… That's a pretty smart covert propaganda plan you're cooking up.” I point out, alas he's so engrossed in it he doesn't even recognize the compliment.



“It's only going to get more complicated as we transition from a PMC into our own nation state… I've got a sinking feeling my job is going to heavily revolve around making sure that the SC and shield leave us alone. It'll be challenging, but essential. If either one ever turns their guns on us, we'll be beyond screwed.”



I nod once again while getting up. “Hence why I'm really not in the right headspace to be going off with you guys. Want to accompany me down to the shuttle bay?…”



“Would be my pleasure sir… fuck.” He says the last word quietly through his teeth. “Slans” Narv then quickly finishes off the remainder of his fresh coffee and gets up. I grab my cane and together we head out of the cantina and down the Sparrows busy passageways. As we walk past scores of different people, I ask him one more thing pertaining to my old job. 



“Have you heard anything further from Brecken or his men?”



Narv shakes his head and flicks his ears negatively. 



“Not since that last message of his, proclaiming 'The fight isn't over’ and the foundation of something called ‘The Black Wing’. None of which bode well for the future.”



“What's the latest count for personnel that's gone dark with him?”



“Pretty much everyone he trained or recruited has disappeared… so at this point…  about 100.”



“Certainly not good… it's probably safe for you to assume that he still has contacts within the former privateer networks. Definitely keep an eye on anybody that had contact with them and has remained within your ranks. Other than that… the best thing you guys can do is distance yourself. Disavow anything his new organization does that could draw you into conflict with the established powers.”



“Pretty much my plan exactly sir… Slans.”



I smirk as we reach the elevator. Just the two of us get on and ride down to the shuttle bay deck. “I taught you well. With plans and assessments like that, you're pretty far from unqualified.” he smiles… then a look of begrudging acknowledgement crosses his face as he realizes that with just two examples, I'd just shown the man is not only adequate, but in fact excelling at doing his job. A moment then passes and I decide to change subjects once again. 



“That waitress seems to like you.”



*You're so wishy-washy with what you want to talk about right now… of course, right now I can just let my mind wander.*



I watch his face… for a moment there's nothing, then his visible eye opens up slightly more. “Oh… um… I guess.”



“What was on that paper she slipped you?…”



I can see a slight bloom on his muzzle… he then casually reaches into his coat and pulls it out, looks at it and says. “Her contact information.”



At that I tip my hat. “Very nice.”



He nods head while slipping it back into his jacket. “I bet she'll be fun…” 



“I didn't know you were such a ladies man.”



“First off, not just ladies.” He then confidently winks. “Given you were my boss I kept things relatively professional, at least where it concerned sex and love life stuff. Now that we don't have the dynamic. I can be honest about something kind of funny…”



I tilt my head a little bit. “What is that?”



“I saw you and Bobby together the **\[Day\]** you took a shortcut through Retributions red light deck.”



At that, I turn my entire body to him and ask. “You were there? Why didn't I see you?”



He chuckles. “Because you just went past the room I was in… I'd just decided to take a break from some partners. I step out to take a smoke in the hallway, maybe chat with a few people. Just as I do I see you and him walking away from where I was, backs turned to me… both you and Bobby's tails swishing back and forth in almost perfect unison.” With that he gives a devious smile, one which I can feel causes me to bloom. “Couldn't believe my eyes that it was you I saw… wasn't until later when I heard the rumors going around that I knew in fact I had seen you. Though I will admit… even if I had stepped out sooner you might not have recognized me with the gear I was wearing.” 



By now I'm shaking my head, chuckling. “Was I the only one not messing around in this group?”



He looks up at the ceiling, then begins moving his lips without speaking while counting with his paw. A few times during it he actually stops and gets this contemplative look and then shakes his head affirmatively. “Probably…”



I'm about to respond, however the elevator comes to a stop causing me to hold my tongue. **\[Seconds\]** later the doors open revealing yet another busy passageway. One that we quickly make our way through until arriving at the open shuttle bay doors. 



As we enter I'm surprised to see Captain Salazar currently standing by the base of a ramp leading into a shuttle. The one which is currently being loaded with trunks of mine. 



*Interesting…*  



“I'm surprised to see you here sir?”



I admit while approaching Captain Salazar. The commander smiles and respectfully bows his head. “I wanted to be here in person to show you my respect.”



“That's very kind of you Captain… thank you.”



Behind him, I watch as the last of my luggage is loaded onto the shuttle… I then turned to Narv.



“Well… it looks like this is it. Thank you, Narv, for all the amazing work you've done for me. Who would have thought when I found you down in the brig of Retribution threatening prisoners… That one **\[day\]** it would lead to you in charge of a brand new nation's intelligence agency.”



He smiles and actually gives me a hug which I happily return. “Probably not a lot… Thank you for understanding and dealing with that ‘incident’ quietly. And thank you for all the guidance and wisdom. I'll be sure to uphold the standards that you set for us… Slans.”



“Good man…” as we separate, I look at the captain. “Once again thank you for letting me tag along and even doing this detour to drop me off.”



Captain Salazar gives me a salute. “You're a fellow privateer, it's my pleasure to help you anyway I can. Stay safe out there sir...”



“I will Captain… and I hope you find good fortune in the Confederacy's new navy.”



I then returned the salute before making my way over to the shuttle and up the ramp… Once inside I take a seat and strap in. Craning my head, I can't help but look out the back door at Narv, Salazar and everyone else. Quietly watching as the world I'd come to know becomes obscured by the cold steel. 



“Goodbye for now friends… may we meet again soon.”

It disappeared quickly and I realized it was an extremely limited time item. I tried the cold chocolate chip cookies they sell in the plastic containers by the register and those are, sadly, just not the same.

1ny50us,https://www.reddit.com/r/BakingAI/comments/1ny50us/complete_guide_structuring_websites_for/,"Complete Guide: Structuring Websites for Accessibility, SEO, and AI Readability [Long Read]","Hey everyone,

I've put together a comprehensive guide on website structure that covers something I think we don't talk about enough: designing for BOTH human users and AI agents.

Why this matters now:

With GPTBot, Claude, and other AI crawlers becoming sophisticated ""users"" of our websites, plus increasing legal requirements for accessibility compliance, how we structure content has never been more important.

What's covered:

* Semantic HTML fundamentals - Why <div> soup is hurting your SEO and accessibility
* Heading hierarchy best practices - The right way to use H1-H6 (with examples)
* ARIA roles and landmarks - When to use them (and when NOT to)
* Information Architecture patterns - Hierarchical, flat, sequential, matrix structures
* Structured data implementation - [Schema.org](http://Schema.org) markup for better search visibility
* WCAG compliance techniques - Meeting 2.1 AA and beyond
* Mobile-first responsive design - Touch targets, keyboard nav, progressive enhancement
* Real-world case studies - How BBC, [GOV.UK](http://GOV.UK), Harvard, and Patagonia do it right

Includes:

* Code examples (HTML & Markdown)
* Comparison tables for semantic elements
* Tool recommendations (WAVE, Axe, Lighthouse, etc.)
* Testing methodologies
* SEO optimization strategies

Key takeaway: Sites that prioritize structure, accessibility, and machine readability will dominate search results and provide better user experiences. It's not just about compliance, it's about competitive advantage.

The guide is pretty extensive (covers everything from basic semantic HTML to advanced ARIA implementation), so grab a coffee

A Shutdown Silver Lining: Federal Workers Eat and Drink at a Discount
Nazaryan, Alexander
.  New York Times (Online) New York Times Company. Oct 2, 2025.


Washington watering holes and restaurants are showing solidarity and seizing an opportunity to draw in out-of-work government employees.
It’s been a tough year for restaurants in Washington, D.C. And as the federal government shut down on Wednesday, sending thousands of workers home and raising the possibility that many could lose their jobs permanently, a business climate that couldn’t get any worse suddenly did.
But some restaurants are seeing an opportunity, offering steep discounts to anyone with proof of federal employment — or in some cases, to anyone who walks through the door. For many, it’s a show of solidarity with the 400,000 federal employees who work in and around the district and serve as the region’s economic backbone. It’s also a way to drum up business.
“It’s a little bit of ‘You help us, we help you,’” said Diane Gross, who runs the Cork Wine Bar and Market on 14th Street. Once she learned of the shutdown, Ms. Gross decided to open early on Wednesday, at 3 p.m. instead of 5:30. She also announced several discounts for federal employees, including glasses of European wine for $5 to $8, French fries (recently voted the best by Washington City Paper) for $6, and avocado toast for $7.
As soon as the doors opened on Wednesday, two federal workers strutted in to take advantage of the deal. They ate, drank wine and commiserated about their plight. By the time Ms. Gross left to pick up her daughter from school at 4 p.m., there were eight people at the bar, “all federal workers,” Ms. Gross said. “They all ordered French fries.”
Despite a reputation for being transient and transactional, Washington inspires loyalty in its locals. Among them is Michael Haft, who grew up in the city and returned after serving in the Marine Corps in Afghanistan. He co-founded Compass Coffee in 2014, and has opened 25 locations in the Washington area.
Mr. Haft’s response to the shutdown has been a free pastry for any federal government employee who buys a coffee. More than 1,000 customers — about 12 percent of guests across all locations — took the offer on Wednesday, he said.
The pastry deal will remain in place until the shutdown ends. “As a D.C. community, we’ve faced many challenges together in recent years, and we know we’ll emerge from this one stronger,” Mr. Haft said.
Matt Weiss has been to this rodeo before. Also a Washington native, he opened Union Pub on Capitol Hill in 1995. In December of that year, during the Clinton administration, the federal government shut down.
Mr. Weiss said he believes that Union Pub has offered specials to federal employees and congressional staff members during that shutdown and every one since. (There have been three since President Trump was first elected in 2016.)
“When we needed their support, our guests were there for us,” Mr. Weiss said of the difficult climb back from pandemic restrictions. Union Pub is now offering federal workers a $7 hot-dog-and-beer shutdown special.
A few higher-end restaurants have also stepped up. Pasta dishes at Osteria Morini, in the city’s newly refurbished Navy Yard district, can cost as much as $33. But for now, government workers will be charged only $15 for most pasta dishes.
Butterworth’s, a favored hangout for MAGA’s younger and more stylish adherents, has joined in. For $10, any guest can order a spicy margarita called a “furlough-rita” or a manhattan rebranded as a “continuing-rye-solution” (a nod to the continuing resolution, a temporary funding bill that House Republicans passed last month). There’s also a Welsh rarebit for $5.
A restaurant frequented by Trump cabinet secretaries and right-wing luminaries like Stephen K. Bannon may seem like an unlikely source of sympathy for federal workers, given the president’s threats of large-scale firings.
But the co-owner Raheem Kassam rejected any such partisan framing.“I have friends who will be furloughed. Neighbors,” Mr. Kassam wrote in an email. “Our personal politics may not always align, but if I can still help get by, then that’s what we’ll always try to do.”
By Wednesday afternoon, local news sources like Washingtonian magazine had compiled lists of restaurant specials: $10 bowls at the Indian fast-casual chain RASA; $15 for a grilled cheese sandwich and old-fashioned cocktail at McClennan’s Retreat, a popular Dupont Circle pub.
As of 2024 there were more than 2,600 restaurants in Washington, providing 66,000 jobs, according to the National Restaurant Association. Many are likely to suffer if federal workers stay away from their offices for weeks, said Shawn Townsend, chief executive of the Restaurant Association of Metropolitan Washington.
“The federal shutdown brings real uncertainty to workers, families and businesses across our region,” Mr. Townsend wrote in an emailed statement. “Restaurants — already navigating thin margins — are directly impacted.”
The association has started Together We Dine, a media campaign to encourage Washingtonians to patronize local restaurants. It has distributed $100,000 in what it describes as “microgrants” to 20 restaurants. The funding came from the city’s government.
It’s unclear how long the shutdown discounts will last — or how much zeal furloughed or laid off government workers will have for eating out.
On Wednesday, Franklin Hall, a popular beer garden, announced its Government Shutdown Special: discounted drinks and a free buffet for everyone. The buffet proved popular — perhaps too much so, said the general manager Nathan Kazaitis later in the evening, long after the last of the pub grub was gone.
“It was a lot on the kitchen,” he said. And if the free food continued, “we wouldn’t be able to afford to keep the doors open.” The drink specials will remain.

Alright, friends, let’s talk about the big, shiny elephant in the room: AI. It’s not just for tech nerds anymore; it’s rapidly becoming a part of literally *every* job out there. Did you ever think you’d have to worry about your paycheck being threatened by a robot? Because I sure didn’t. But here we are! 

**Why should YOU care?** 

- **Job security**: If you’re not brushing up on your AI skills, your job could be next on the chopping block. 
- **Opportunities**: AI isn’t just about robots taking jobs. It's about how you can leverage AI to make your work life easier and more efficient – think of it as your new assistant that never asks for coffee breaks!
- **Paycheck potential**: Those who know how to work with AI will be the ones hiring and shaping the industry. Want to stay in the gold club? Time to suit up!

Here’s the thing: **We’re in a moment of opportunity!** Maybe you’re feeling overwhelmed about diving into AI, but you don’t have to be a tech wizard. Upskilling doesn’t mean you need a PhD in machine learning. It just means you start chipping away at the knowledge step by step.

**Consider these fun, approachable starting points:**

1. **Online Courses Galore**: Platforms like Coursera, Udemy, or even this handy **[Imagine Education program](https://whop.com/imagine-education-ai/?a=liveitupdeals)** are gold mines for beginners! I mean, you’re telling me I could get smart about AI while wearing pajamas? Sign me up!
  
2. **Join a Community**: Whether it’s a subreddit (hey, we’re here at AiContentAutomators!), a Slack channel, or a local meetup, connecting with others can make learning way more fun. Plus, you might just pick up some tips and tricks along the way.

3. **Experiment**: If you don’t have any coding experience, no worries! Start small. Try using AI-powered tools that you might already have, like Grammarly or even chatbots. Play around with them and see how they can help you work smarter.

4. **Stay Informed**: Follow tech news, subscribe to AI podcasts, or watch YouTube videos. It’s like being in a never-ending conversation with the coolest people in the room… without the awkward small talk!

5. **Keep Your Curiosity Alive**: What interests you about AI? How can you weave that into your current role? The possibilities are endless, and honestly, that’s the exciting part!

Let’s be real; the world is changing faster than a cat video can go viral. If you're rolling your eyes and thinking, ""Why bother?"" just remember: tech might evolve, but your ability to adapt and embrace change will always be valuable. 

And hey, it’s not just about job security – it’s about being part of the future and not just watching it from the sidelines. 🚀

So, what’s stopping you? The first step is always the hardest, but once you get rolling, you'll wonder why you didn’t jump in sooner. Here’s to making moves and creating a future we can all look forward to! 💪✨

Let’s chat about your experiences with learning AI – was it smoother than you expected, or did it have you tearing your hair out? Either way, we’re here to support each other!",1,1759610158.0,AIContentAutomators,0,1.0,False

She went on a month long trip this summer that she had absolutely no means to go on, was contacting family members basically the whole time asking for money, like i don’t get how someone could have the audacity to do that. So recently my parents decided they didn’t want to keep paying the insurance on the car she was using and said that she can pay for it from now on if she wants to use it.

His eyes were half-open, his mustache slightly drooping. He’d been up for thirty-one hours straight.

“Sleep is for the weak,” he muttered to himself, sipping a cup of cold, half-spilled coffee. The cup said *World’s Best Mall Cop*, but right now, he didn’t feel like it. He felt like a zombie with a badge.

Paul hadn’t meant to ruin his sleep schedule. It started innocently a late-night YouTube binge on “How to Make Better Pretzels.” Then came the 2 a.m. mall security reports, the 4 a.m. rerun of *Walker, Texas Ranger*, and the 6 a.m. energy drink that sent his heart racing like a Segway on turbo mode.

By the time his shift started the next day, Paul was running purely on caffeine, determination, and an unwavering sense of duty to the mall.

“Blart,” his coworker Donna said, staring at the bags under his eyes. “You look like a man who’s been fighting sleep... and losing.”

Paul forced a grin. “Mall safety never sleeps. So neither do I.”

But by noon, the consequences began to show. He accidentally locked himself *in* a Cinnabon kiosk. Later, he gave a long, emotional speech to a cardboard cutout of Adam Sandler about the importance of rest.

By 4 p.m., he was hallucinating that the mall fountain was whispering his name.  
“Paul… sleeeep…”

He shook his head. “Not now, fountain. Evil never rests.”

That night, after a fourth cup of coffee and a brief nap standing up, Paul finally reached his breaking point. He slumped over the Segway controls and accidentally drifted into a Forever 21 display, toppling over mannequins like bowling pins.

When he woke up three hours later, wrapped in scarves and jewelry displays, something clicked.

“This isn’t sustainable,” he admitted. “Even heroes need REM.”

So he did the unthinkable. Paul Blart made a *bedtime schedule*.  
No caffeine after 7 p.m.  
No YouTube deep dives.  
No mall patrol past midnight (unless there was an *actual* emergency).

The next morning, he woke up refreshed, alert, and proud. As he cruised through the mall with his thermos of decaf coffee, he smiled.

For once, he felt unstoppable not because he stayed awake all night, but because he’d finally mastered the hardest mission of all…  
**a good night’s sleep.**

And somewhere in the distance, the fountain whispered approvingly,

I (F, 55) have been seeing a Functional Medicine MD for a few months to get to the root cause of intense fatigue and IBS that started a few months after having my gallbladder removed in May of 2024. He's done a bunch of tests that confirm poor energy metabolism and problems with my krebs cycle. Insulin resistance is also suspected, but has not been confirmed with testing. (I am about 35 pounds overweight, and have a family history of diabetes on both sides.) He wants me to try 16:8 IF for the next several weeks to see if it will help. He told me to start testing my urine for ketones after 3 weeks of IF. 

I've been doing 16:8 IF for one week now, and I don't feel like my body is going into ketosis at all. I should add that I'm also currently on a restricted carb (not completely low-carb) diet to clear out an intestinal candida overgrowth. My diet consists of plenty of protein from eggs, meat, and seafood, lots of lower-carb veggies, a bowl of berries once a day (the only fruit allowed on the candida diet), and one serving of high-fiber carbs, like oat bran or quinoa, once a day. Coffee and black tea are also not allowed on the candida diet, so I have a cup of green tea in the morning. The only sweetener that I use is stevia and monkfruit. I don't drink any diet soda (also restricted with candida), just mineral water and tap water. 

I eat a large dinner with plenty of meat and tons of veggies just before I start the 16 hour fast, which is about 6 hours before I go to bed. Since I started fasting, I've been waking up in the middle of the night, or early in the morning, with horrible fatigue and chills that feels like low blood sugar. I've stated keeping zero-calorie electrolyte drinks next to my bed, and chug that when I wake up with these symptoms. It helps somewhat. But, when I get up in the morning, I am a complete zombie until it's time to eat my first meal of the day, which is always large and well-balanced. The fatigue and brain fog don't go away until about 1 - 1.5 hours after my first meal.

On Christmas Eve, Switzerland finally had its first snow. I sat in the room of an assisted euthanasia clinic, the staff making the final confirmations. “Ma’am, is there anyone you want to see one last time?” “No.” “Any final words you want to leave?” “No.” “Any unfinished wishes?” “No.” I had nothing left to say to this world—or to him. The moment the sh0//t slid in, I vaguely saw him at eighteen, singing and playing a love song he wrote for me in front of the entire school. And now… he’s probably with that other girl. He’ll never know that what he missed wasn’t the first snowfall—but the moment I was meant to die.

Any discomfort in your legspain?” His long, slender hands reddened worked with practiced pressure, veins standing out from the effort, veins standing out starkly against his skinmovements almost professional. His technique was practiced, professional even, but Evelyn felt nothing. When she didn’t respond, Graham glanced up, concern creasing worry furrowing his brow.

I’ll be back to finish the massage later.” Evelyn said nothingstayed silent, her eyes following him as he leftout. Even after his figure disappeared through the doorwayhe vanished from sight, her mind replayed that fleeting, irrepressible fleeting smile.

They dated in secret, hiding from their parents, vowing promising to work hard and get into the same college so they could one day go public with finally make their loverelationship known. They pushed each other, studied relentlessly, and both scored near-perfect SATsaced their exams, earning spots at admission to MIT. It was supposed to be should have been perfect; the perfect chapter, the happy ending to next chapter in their story. But then came the accident. The day before college started, a car crash changed everything. In that split second of danger, Evelyn instinctively pushed shoved Graham out of the way. . He walked away unscathedwithout a scratch. She lost both her legs. When it rainsAnd as if fate hadn’t done enough, it pours. That that same year, year her parents died in a plane crash. The weight of it all—Her world collapsed. With her legs, family gone and her familyfuture stolen, her future—crushed her. Depression depression took root, deep and unyielding. Graham, heartbroken for herstricken with guilt and love, proposed the moment day they graduated college. He swore he’d he would never let her downleave her, that he’d he would stand by her side for life. For three years after their wedding, he kept that promise. Until two weeks ago, when she found his diary. The man who claimed to love told her every day that he loved her was pouring out his pain on despair onto those pages. . He wrote that his proposal hadn’t been born of come from love, but of from guilt, —a moral obligation to avoid the world’s obligation, a fear of judgment. He described That coming home to her as felt suffocating, each every moment with her a torment. He . That if he could go back, he wished she hadn’t saved him that day, even if it meant he’d be the one . He would rather have lived in a wheelchair himself than carry the wheelchair, because the guilt crushing weight of her sacrifice was too heavy to bearsacrifice.

Just fifteen more days. Then And then all the pain would endfinally be over. Evelyn Hart woke early the next morning, the soft pale light of dawn spilling through the curtains. . By ten o’clock, Graham Sterling finally stirred, shuffling out of the bedroom with a yawn, yawn and rubbing the sleep from his eyes. . He spotted her at the kitchen table, hunched over a notebook, scribbling intently. Curious, he wandered overcloser. The pages were filled with dense, meticulous handwriting, —line after line of tasks. He scanned them slowly, realization dawning. A list of things to do. [Visit the old family house, catch up with friends. Stroll by the lake, feed the pigeons. Get blackout drunk at a bar…] “Evelyn, what’s with this list?” he asked, his voice still rough with from sleep. Her pen paused mid-stroke. She glanced up at himup, her expression unreadable. “It’s a bucket list.” The words hit him like a faint an echo from the past. A smile tugged at his lips, softening his features. . “You wrote one of these when you were seventeen, didn’t you? A hundred things you wanted to do before you turned eighteen…” He trailed off, his smile faltering as regret flashed flickered across his face.

Back then, I listed all sorts of wild filled it with reckless stuff—bungee jumping, skiing, white-water rafting, surfing. Every single thing was reckless. wild.” “But you? You were even crazier than me. Not only did you keep track of every moment, you jumped into every adventure with right alongside me.” Her nostalgic tone pulled Graham back to those faded, golden days. A grin spread across his face as memories flickered to life. . “What can I say? I was head over heels for you. Whatever you did, I wanted in. With you by my sidethere, I wasn’t scared afraid of anything. I’d close my eyes and leap from out of a plane from thousands of feet in the airup…” Evelyn watched him quietly, his animated expression lighting up the room. . When his gaze finally dropped to meet hers, she said something out of the bluespoke suddenly, her voice soft but pointedcutting. “It’s been a long time since I’ve seen you smile like that.” Graham’s grin froze. The air grew heavy, the moment stretching stretched taut between them. After a few secondsbeat, he sidestepped the tension. “Well, … how about I join you for these new wishes, then?” Evelyn shook her head, her tone firm, almost stubborn. “These are my wishes. They’ve got nothing to do with you. You’re too busy with work anyway. Don’t worry about it.” Something about her flat expression made his heart skip, a pang of unease settling in his chestchest tighten with unease. He opened his mouth to argue, but his phone buzzed, cutting him off. Glancing . One glance at the screen, the and warmth returned to his face, that fleeting his smile rekindling. “Work stuff,” he muttered, barely looking at her before turning and leaving the room.

Back then, he’d he had refused to let heraccept it—relentless, charming and relentlesscharming, sticking clinging to her side no matter how much she protested. .

Numbly, she picked up her laptop, saved the message, and printed it out. . She tucked it into the drawer alongside her bucket list, joining a the growing collection of similar provocations she’d she had been saving over the past few weeks. To her, death felt like a release.

1ny4h60,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ny4h60,I accidentally built an AI search app inspired by my cousin's Instagram reels addiction – and it's weirdly better than perplexity for social recommendations,"Last summer, I stayed at my cousin's house. I was trying to pick a restaurant with my friends, but Google reviews just made it worse. My cousin heard me and said to try a place she saw in IG reels. It was perfect. That's when I saw how social media gives real, quick advice that web searches don't have.

I made a simple version of an app called [Drissea](https://anylink.so/drissea?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=sideproject). It's an AI search tool that mixes facts from the web with ideas from Instagram and YouTube. For example, if you ask for the best coffee spot in your city for working, it gives info from what people say in videos but if you want it to search the web and answer general questions it would do that too.

The app looks at reels and videos to show real reactions, like for gadgets or outfits. Every answer has links so you can check them yourself. You can ask more questions to dig deeper, like in a chat. And it saves your past searches for easy access.

It's free on the Play Store and App Store right now, with over 50 upvotes on Peerlist. I use it a lot, and it saves me time when I want workout tips or quick facts instead of scrolling forever.

“I’ll call you when I’m finished. You should go back to the diner and get a real meal and cool down.” 

I glanced him over realizing he was holding back something he wanted to ask. 

“Do...you want me to get you something to eat while I’m there?” I asked. 

His head turned away almost embarrassed I was right. 

“Do you have a tapeworm?” I sighed glad he was able to lighten the mood a little. 

“Something like that.” His eyes crinkled in a small smile. 

I let him go already dreading our next conversation.  The variety store was on the way, and I needed a drink. The cicadas chirped away adding to my current headache. Someone waited outside the store for me. I could have walked away but I leaned against the cool windows waiting for him to speak first. 

“Julie is still crying.” Jame said his voice with a harsh edge. 

“I wasn’t expecting to see her. I just wanted to go by the grave and keep to myself.” I told him and took a sip of the root beer unable to taste it.  

“If that was the case you wouldn’t have brought a PI here. You’re digging up the past. Just let it go.” 

A hot flash came to my stomach. I thought I was drowning in acid rising into my throat. I held it all back knowing snapping at him would do nothing. 

“We’ll pay for the graves to be moved. Why do you think your mother and sister want to be here? For Christ's sake, one of them was skinned alive.” 

The glass bottle from my hand dropped to the ground as I was unable to control myself. I grabbed James by the front of the shirt unsure of what I was going to do next. Thankfully a vision of how he looked like a child kept my hands steady. We were both stuck in the past. No matter how anger I it was wrong to take it out on someone else who also was suffering. Slowly I released his shirt and flexed my tense fingers. 

“I’ve asked the mayor if we can raise funds to also buy your old home then tear it down. It was a mistake let it stay or all these years. I know you suffered more than all of us but that doesn’t change the fact this town is also hurting.” He sounded like he hated what he needed to say but he kept speaking. “Before your family died, they cleared part of the lake to build some cabins. The investors backed out because no one wanted to come here when they heard about the murders. It’s taken a long time, but people are healing. This town is healing. Just as new talks started up about the cabins again you came back.” 

I let him vent. He had every right to feel the way he did. James’s father was a construction worker. He could have a steady job if the cabins were built here. Instead, he was forced to travel for work missing out on important moments in his child's lives. A steady stream of campers would help improved this town. As things were now, I doubted this place had two generations left.  

“My sister-” I started, and James cut me off. 

“I get it. Her jawbone turned up. I understand how hard that is on you. But you didn’t come back for her. You came back with a PI. You need to accept the best thing for our town is that your father committed the crime.” 

My glare in his direction said everything it needed to. A closed case is easier to forget. I was aware of that. But who was the one being selfish at that moment?  

“I can forgive you for dragging all of us through this if you don’t leave Julie behind this time.” 

A very low and distance roll of thunder echoed through the sky. A storm was coming. Maybe it would hit in a few hours. I couldn’t bring myself to look back at James. How I felt about Julie was complicated. It was yet another thing I couldn’t bring myself to deal with. If I didn’t have her to rely on in my darker moments, I don’t think I would have lasted this long. I felt like I used her. I dumped my troubles on her, left her and refused to come back when she needed it. I left her in a dying town, and she was too kind to ever get angry. 

“I'll get you another drink.” He said and left me alone with my thoughts. 

It wasn’t just the heat that pressed down. It felt as if the entire forest was judging me. Depending on my next actions this place could turn into a lively tourist spot, or it could die a slow drawn-out death.  

James handed over a new bottle of root beer that I didn’t feel like drinking. I spun it around in my hands letting it cool them down a little. He hadn’t left yet, and I wanted to get the last word in. 

“You two are still like kids to ne...” I said doubting my own words. 

“Then tell her that. You need to move on. Without or without Julie. You’re not helping anyone the way you are now.” 

I wanted to be upset with him, but he was right. But how could anyone move from something like all this? I needed to take my mind off these thoughts before I ended up in a darker train of thought. Yuan asked for a meal from the diner and I figured Ms. Hill would be talking so much I wouldn’t have time to think. 

The moment I walked inside the building I regretted my choice. Ms. Hill rushed over to me to chat. The diner had gotten busier with the regulars. It looked as if half the town was there. Including two people I never wanted to see again. 

“Dean, I heard you were back! How have you been?” A warm voice called out through a fake smile. 

The mayor walked over holding out a hand. I shook it watching him hide his displeasure at my damp hand. His hair had gone grey at the temples. A bad dye job hid the rest of the how badly he aged the past few years. He had been the mayor since I was a child, and I never liked him.  Another older man sat at the counter, not hiding his scowl.  

I didn’t like our good old mayor because of how he plastered on pleasant face to get what he wanted. I wanted to say I disliked the sheriff for any other reason beyond a personal one. I’ve heard he wasn’t very good at his job preferring to chase after anyone single woman in the area instead of earning his paycheck. 

“I’m only back for a day or so. Ms. Hill, can you pack up a meal or two for me? Anything is fine.” I asked her trying to ignore the two men with their eyes in my direction. 

She nodded hurrying away. Bless her, she knew how badly I wanted to leave. She wasn’t fast enough.  

“We saw you talking with James. Looks like you were getting worked up over something.” The sheriff commented. 

Glancing over my shoulder I tried to see the front of the small shop from the diner window. I couldn’t so the sheriff must have seen us from the street before he came inside. He wanted a fight, and I didn’t. 

“Why did you even bother to come back here?” He pressed and the mayor sighed looking away when he realized where this was all going. 

“Dean is having a hard time right now. It's our job as townsfolk to support him.” He said as if he wanted to win over everyone in the room. 

So many eyes were in our direction. Sweat dripped down the side of my face and this time it wasn't from the heat. Not a single person wanted me here.  

“Is that so? A piece of his dear little sister turned up. Odd timing don’t you think?” The sheriff's voice turned almost sweet filled with hidden intentions. 

“I’m not sure if I follow what you’re trying to suggest.” The mayor said losing ground in the conversation. 

“His father was against the newer cabins. He wanted to make a petition to make the forest some sort of protected land, right?” 

This time the mayor rolled his eyes with a long sigh showing off a batch or true emotions for once. 

“It’s just a coincidence the deal fell through back then and we’re having issues with the same thing now. What on Earth are you trying to say? We all don’t know the motives behind the crime, but I truly doubt he valued some trees over his family. Coincidences, nothing more.” 

It felt odd having someone on my side. Or maybe he was saying this for his own sake. It wasn’t a good look to have rumor going around a man killed his family to keep some investors away. 

“I’m just saying it’s odd. Little Dean was alone in that house for a while before I showed up. It’s possible he took something to help carry on his father’s wishes...” 

The mayors face went pale at the gruesome suggestion. The sheriff grinned showing off deep wrinkles and stained teeth from years of smoking. The white-hot flash boiled up. Within the next second I would have done something I would have regretted if it wasn’t for Ms. Hill storming over. 

“Clifford Adams!” She said her face flushed using the same tone she did on all her students when they misbehaved. “What a childish nasty thing to say! You should be ashamed of yourself!” 

His grin disappeared from being treated in such a way by a person only a few years older than himself.  

“Like our mayor said, we don’t know the motive behind the crime. But I know a few things for certain, Dean loved his sister.  He would never do something so vile. A part of her was discovered. He wants answers, we all do. You’re just threatened by the fact he hired a person to look over your work. Which he’s well within his right to do.” She huffed standing between me and the older man glaring in our direction.  

“Well Ms. Hill-” 

“It seems as if you’re finished your coffee. If you have nothing else to order I believe a few people are waiting for your seat.” 

I was grateful that someone stood up for me, but at the same time I didn’t want to deal with the new headache this would all cause. The sheriff already disliked me. Now he would actively get in my way of dealing with a case he closed so many years ago. I could see his mind working away already thinking of new rumors to spread to make him look better.  

I still wanted to hug Ms. Hill for her help but I was damp from the heat. She just got a smile instead. 

After all the fuss the sheriff slunk away, and the regulars went back to their conversations. Ms. Hill handed over a hefty bag of food refusing to let me pay her for it. She just wanted me to promise her that I would come by more often to catch up. I made a graceful exit keeping an eye out for a certain person who might want to cause some trouble. Thankfully the streets were mostly empty. 

Weighed down by the summer sun and a bag of food I walked slowly toward the motel. After being in the city for so long I’d almost forgotten how oppressive it felt being surrounded by trees. It was as they were watching our every move. I knew that was a silly idea and yet I couldn’t shake the feeling of eyes staring in my direction. 

I stopped to look around expecting to see James or the sheriff. No one. Only the sounds of summer insects rang through the air. I almost wished a storm did roll through to break this heat.  Movement between a building caught my eye. I could see the tree line between two closed businesses. In fact, no matter where I looked, I could see directly into the forest between the spaces of this small town.  

A dark shape stood off in the trees. At first it looked like a dark shadow between the leaves. Then it moved. Something dark was out there, staring with unseen eyes. I squinted trying to make my sight adjust. It had to just be some shadows. It couldn’t be human, and my mind was just playing tricks on me. Like seeing a hanging coat in the dark and assuming it was a trespasser. The longer I focused on it the more the shape shifted into a more solid form. 

What the hell was that? My heart started to beat harder until I thought it would burst. Suddenly countless thoughts swamped my brain. I knew most of this town hated me. No one wanted me back. Ms. Hill just wanted some gossip. She didn't care if it was me. Jessie would be better off if she never saw me again and now even the forest was out to get me? 

My knees shook and I almost collapsed in the street. When a cold hand touched the back of my neck I jumped and lashed out. Luckily, I didn’t hit the person who had stopped behind me. 

“Is there something wrong?” Yuan asked looking off into the tree line. 

When I looked back, I let myself relax. I couldn’t believe I was scared by a shadow. 

“That space there looked like a person. It was freaky.” I explained trying not to sound crazy. 

Yuan titled his head with a neutral expression in his face. He wasn’t seeing the same thing I did.  

“I suppose.” He half agreed. 

“Why are you here anyway? I thought you would call.” I asked trying to change the topic. 

“I did. Your phone must be off.” 

When I pulled it out to check I found out he was right. It was dead because I forgot to charge it the night before. We started to head back, and I didn’t feel ready to talk about the reason why we separated in the first place. 

“That cloud looks like a crab.” I pointed out.  

His eyes slightly narrowed, and he raised a hand to check if I had a fever. I moved away just in time avoiding his creepy cold fingers. 

“I read somewhere that humans evolved to see things in shape. If there is a stick in the grass our brains might think it’s a deadly snake. The ones who always assumed something harmless was dangerous were the ones who lived and passed down that trait. Who cares if you’re running from sticks if on occasion it’s a snake.”  

Yuan patiently listened. I was just trying to rationalize why I got so rattled by a random shadow. Overall, he didn’t care or at least I didn’t think he did. When I was finished speaking, he smiled. The expression put a chill down my back. His face just looked so unnatural in the moment. 

“That is an interesting theory.” He nodded having a hint of emotion in his tone for once. 

“No offence but your smile is a bit... weird.” I admitted to him. 

He paused then raised his hands to press his cheeks upward trying to make it appear less threatening. It wasn’t working. 

“Have you heard of the whole uncanny valley theory? Some people think the reason why we’re so freaked out by faces that look slightly off is because at some point there was something like that. A predator that looked almost human.” 

He remained silent almost as if he was trying to avoid an accusation.  

“Do you believe in monsters?” Yuan asked out of the blue. 

I shook my head not understanding the question. We had almost reached the motel. I dreaded what we needed to go through when he reached it. I had been the one to ask for his help. Now I didn’t know if I was strong enough to look for the answers I desperately wanted. 

“The photos aren’t in my room any longer. I destroyed them. I would just like to sit down with you and go over a few details.” Yuan said and I had some mixed emotions over his words. 

“Destroyed them? Won’t you need to go over them again in case you missed anything?” I asked and he slightly shook his head. 

“I have a good memory.”  

We reached the front of his hotel room, and he reached for the door when I pointed something out. 

“You forgot my name this morning.” 

A very small hint of annoyance came over his face. 

“I have a good memory for the important things.” 

I wondered if I put my faith in the wrong person for a half second right then. We walked inside and he hung up his long coat. I turned on the AC feeling like the room was hotter than outside. I set down the bag of food, but he wasn’t interested in it. I sat down at the table near the window and Yuan took a seat on the edge of the bed. We were finally ready to go over the gruesome details of a night the scarred the entire town. 

“I went over all the photos of the scene. There were no signs of another person inside the house. To commit the crime, they would have stepped in blood trailing it across the scene. Only your families' footprints were found and there were no signs of cleanup.” 

 I sank into the chair half expecting this answer. We discovered it was possible for someone to enter the house without a trace that night. But now we were back to square one. 

“What if there was someone else in the house? They threatened my father with a gun and made him do what he did? Maybe they claimed they had me hostage that night. In a panic my father followed their orders, killed my mother and sister and out of horror killed himself.” I offered grasping at straws. 

Yuan listened and then stood up and removed a blanket off the bed. He put it on the floor between us, then grabbed the sheet next. After some fiddling, he had made a long thin shape of them that reached from my feet to the other side of the room. 

“This is how much blood was in the front hallway. It was impossible to exit without stepping in blood. Even washing it off the porch there would be signs of it. You were the only one to leave footprints by the front door that night.” He explained. 

He was right. With how the hallway was set up and how wide the rooms between each other were, no one could move between the front rooms without stepping in blood. 

“What was the kitchen like? It leads to the back door.” I offered. 

“Your sister died inside that room. Again, too much blood to travel through without leaving a trail.” 

I felt my stomach churn. Since I was a child when everything happened, I wasn’t told all the details. I had since avoided as much as I could. I had seen my mother that night. That was enough. 

“What if... the killer had the same foot size as my father?” I suggested. “I mean, it’s not impossible...” 

“Your father was barefoot. Prints were collected and he was missing his small toe on his left foot from an accident with a lawn mower when he was younger, correct?” 

I nodded and let my head rest in my hand. No matter how hard we looked at this it always came back to my father killing two people and then himself. He had no drugs in his system. No tumors or medical reasons to snap. No money issues. No affairs. Then, why did this happen? 

“Those footprints prove it then. He just... did all this and the reason died with him.” I said on the verge of giving up. 

“No. The footprints prove the opposite. If you are able, I would like to go over how each person died. And discuss some details that do not match the theory that your father was the killer.” 

My blood ran cold. Did he really have something new that no one figured out yet? Or had Yuan been the only person who wanted to take a closer look at how strange this all was. 

“Your sister died first. Her neck was broken. She also had bark under her nails. Everyone in that house did. The strange thing was she had no defensive wounds. It was as she died too quickly for her to react. The only thing she could do was briefly claw at what was wrapped around her neck.” 

This was hard to hear. Flashes of what I saw came behind my eyes no matter how hard I pushed it away. The smell of blood overtook my senses. I need to focus on his voice. 

“Wrapped around? Why would anyone kill her with a flexible branch able to be wrapped around her neck?”  

I tried play the situation out in my head. We lived near the woods so finding branch like that was easy. If my mother saw my father in the act, she would have clawed at the branch trying to remove it. And he would get bark under his nails from all the force such a thing would require. But Yuan said something else. That the footprints proved my father wasn’t the killer. He ignored my last question and started to take carefully practiced steps around the room. 

“I plotted out his movements according to the pathways in the blood. Not only did he not enter the kitchen, but his footsteps also do not match what was required to reach where he was found. There are too many inconsistencies. Your father was a frail man. He did not have the strength to arrange your mother in the way she was found. What was done to her was also simply not possible to be finished in the time frame between she died, and you arrived him. On top of all of that, it was not possible for your father to kill himself in the way it was reported.” 

My mouth became dry as I tried to take all this in. Countless questions came through my head. Yuan was right. My father wouldn’t have been able to lift my mother's body above his head long enough to fix her body in the way I saw her. In fact, the hallway had a tall ceiling. We didn’t have a latter that tall. No matter how hard I tried to think there was no way to get a person that high without one. Nothing for him to stand on, and no placed to tie ropes to lift her up. Even if he found a way, it would have taken time. And skinning an entire person also took time. I found them shortly after they all died. Without help a single person couldn’t do all of this in that tight of a time frame.  

“How... can you tell he didn’t...” I said but my voice cracked before I could finish speaking. 

“A hinting rifle was found in his left hand. Where the bullet entered is impossible to be done by a person holding the barrel against their head. He would need to rest it against something at a different angle. I’ve never seen it done, but I suppose he could have rigged a string or something similar to pull the trigger. Even if someone moved the rifle for some reason after the fact there was another thing to consider. Are you feeling well enough to stand up?’ 

My legs felt uneven, but I listened to him. Yuan directed me to stand near the left corner of the room. I heard my father’s body had been found on the left side of the living room. I felt a finger placed directly at the back of my head causing a chill to run down my spine. 

“The bullet was not found inside his skull and yet there was no exit wound. Yet, in the condition his body was in it’s understandable one was missed, or a wound was caused by a different action.  If a bullet went through, where would it end up?” 

I weakly raised my hand to point to the other side of the room. I could visualize what the living room looked like back then. There was no large furniture or anything to stop a bullet from going straight in the wall. Yuan walked around and my eyes followed his path. He took careful steps around the bed to the right side of the room then placed an index finger against the wall. I looked at him feeling colder than I ever had in my life. An odd fear I couldn't place crept up through my stomach. I moved my head to the side looking at a cabinet that wasn’t in the motel room. My father had inherited it from my grandfather along with a single hunting rifle. It was always locked. The ammo was kept elsewhere, and I even doubted there was any inside the house aside from whatever had been loaded in the rifle when it arrived. Even with children he doubted we would ever touch the cabinet let alone open it to play with the gun. 

It was as if someone opened the case, fired the rifle directly in the opposite wall and somehow killed my father without leaving behind a single trace of them being there. 

The bullet was in the wrong spot. 

My mother couldn’t be arranged or skinned within the set time frame. 

There were no footprints inside the kitchen where my sister was killed despite it being covered with blood after they mutilated her body.  

“Do you believe in monsters?” 

Yuan asked once more. 

Every cell in my body wanted to reject all the information I learned. I wanted to believe Yuan was either crazy or messing with me. I still had some room to doubt everything he said so far. If I hadn’t seen my mother that night ten years ago, I would have stormed off unable to accept facts. 

“Are you saying a monster did this?” I asked in a shaking voice trying to get my thoughts into order. 

“If I did, do you think it would be an acceptable answer? You hired me for one reason. To know why your family died and not who killed them. Some humans accept monsters and use them as an excuse for why certain things happen. If we discover without a shadow of a doubt that something not human was the one responsible would my job be finished? Or would you still push forward for more answers?” 

I let his question sink in. Rationally I should have said no. Monsters aren’t real. They were just something people made up to keep children in line.  

“Even something not human was the one who killed them, my goal is still the same. I need to find it. I need to know why. Was it hungry? Did it find this all fun? Did my family somehow upset it? I’m not here to clear my father’s name. I just want something most people get when they lose a loved one.” 

Yuan smiled again and it almost looked natural on his face. We had gone over a lot today. A rumbled of thunder came then I heard small droplets of rain hitting the parking lot outside. It had been clear when we were outside last. The storm had rolled in fairly quickly. 

“I rented out the room next to mine.” 

He walked over to the table and took out two containers of food then re-wrapped them in the bag. Suddenly I felt worn down to the bone. I hadn’t slept and been in the heat for most of the day. 

“We’ll continue with the investigation tomorrow. You should rest for the rest of the day and collect your thoughts. I do not wish to only focus on the monster angle; however, I am going to remain open to all the possibilities.” 

As much as I didn’t want to take a break, he was right. I was just going to spin my wheels for the rest of the day if I forced myself to keep going. Accepting the food and the key to the next room I listened to his advice.   

I found a cord to charge my phone and ate in silence while listening to the storm outside. After my phone charged enough, I saw it would be raining till midnight. There wasn’t much else to do but have a shower then take a quick nap. 

The quick nap turned into a few hours. When I woke in the dark I didn’t know where I was for a few minutes. Then everything came flooding back. Since I didn’t hear the rain, I assumed it was past midnight. Grabbing a bottle of water, I chugged it and looked at any messages I’d missed. One from my boss saying he hoped I was doing alright. Jessie had said it was nice to see me again. Nothing from Yuan. I shot off a text asking if he was still awake. Nothing came back after a few minutes. 

I couldn’t sit still. For the first time in a while I felt awake. There was a vending machine by the motel office. I had just enough for a cold can of pop. Yuan’s room light was on. It felt wrong to bother him, so I just drank a stale coke staring out into the parking lot. 

I wanted to keep thinking through the case, but everything got jumbled in my head. Even with a few hours of sleep I couldn’t think it over clearly. The image of my mother haunted my thoughts. 

A crazy idea came. My old house wasn’t that far away. The family wouldn’t be back for a few days. And I saw a fake rock that poorly hid a spare key when we were there last. 

If I walked over and saw the house maybe I could override that memory with a new one. I needed to face that place again. The night air felt the same as it did ten years ago. Heavy and the storm hovering off in the distance. I wouldn’t be going too far inside the house. Just taking a step or two to see the hallway in the dark. I doubted the family would mind even if they found out. 

Should I tell Yuan I was doing this? No, he would want to tag along. I need to do this alone. With a new purpose I started down the dead street avoiding puddles feeling like a child again. Each shadow off in the forest looked like a person following my every footstep. No matter how much I wanted to run away I owed my family to carry on. ",3,1759609260.0,Odd_directions,2,1.0,False

Backstory

Rutauma Zugelio, the Eye Curse Atar of Shoden Mountain, is a cold visionary who believes the world belongs to Atar users — divine beings above humanity. Viewing ordinary humans as an outdated evolution, he seeks to create a new age where Atar users reign supreme, unchained by mortal limits.
From his frozen fortress atop Ice Shoden Mountain, Rutauma leads the Atar Crim•No Squad, enforcing his doctrine through control, manipulation, and quiet destruction.Though evil, he carries himself with eerie respect and charm. He doesn’t act out of rage — he acts out of belief. When the floating eye beside him glows, it signals not anger, but judgment. Those who stand before him soon realize: his calmness isn’t mercy — it’s the silence before their downfall.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **UFC 320 Preview: Prochazka vs. Rountree Jr. – A Dance of Fireworks and Sieves**

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a light heavyweight spectacle that’s less “civilized duel” and more “two pyrotechnicians arguing over who gets to light the fuse first.” On October 4, 2025, at T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas, **Jiri Prochazka** (-217) and **Khalil Rountree Jr.** (+172) collide in a bout that promises to leave fans exhilarated, doctors concerned, and insurance agents weeping into their coffee. Let’s dissect this clash with the precision of a MMA octagon and the humor of a cornerman’s trash talk.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Who’s the Favorite, and Why?

The numbers tell a story of cautious optimism for Prochazka and desperate hope for Rountree. Prochazka’s FanDuel line (-217) implies a **68% implied probability** of victory, while Rountree’s +172 odds suggest bookmakers give him a **36% chance**. In decimal terms, Prochazka’s 1.48-1.52 odds (per bookmakers) mean he’s the clear chalk, but Rountree’s 2.6-2.76 line leaves a sliver of “value” for those craving chaos.

Why the gap? Prochazka, a former champion, boasts a 5-2 UFC record and a Performance of the Night knockout over Jamahal Hill in January. His resume is peppered with highlight-reel strikes, though his “I’ll take massive damage to land one thunderous haymaker” approach has led to losses to Alex Pereira. Rountree, meanwhile, is a 35-year-old southpaw with a 10-6 UFC ledger, but his recent win over Hill (albeit in Azerbaijan) and improved striking make him a dangerous underdog.

### Digesting the News: Injuries, Motivation, and Circumstance

Let’s start with **Prochazka**, the 32-year-old Czech firework. His style is equal parts “beautiful” and “suicidal”—imagine a poet who also moonlights as a bouncer at a bar fight. He’s coming off a mixed run: a thrilling win, a loss to Pereira, and a reputation for absorbing punishment like a sponge at a whiskey tasting. His defense? Well, as MMA analyst Dan Tom quips, “It’s like a sieve that’s been told ‘si

1ny4aml,https://www.reddit.com/r/EntitledPeople/comments/1ny4aml/when_entitlement_isnt_entitlement_then_the/,When entitlement isn't entitlement. Then the entitled people ruin it.,"When performers go on tour (or even just putting on a one night show) their people talk to the venue people and provide the performer's ""rider,"" which is a contractual list of requirements that the venue has to provide if they want the show to go on. Many of these items are perfectly reasonable: they have to have a place where the performing horses can hang out while they wait to go on stage. They have to have a ramp to get the star's gold and diamond-studded calliope on-stage.

Then there are the other demands.

In 1982 Van Halen (they were big in your parents' day) added a clause to their rider that caused quite a stir when it leaked. There was an explicit clause demanding ""no brown M&Ms"". People accused the group of being spoiled and diva-like, but in this case they weren't.

This was a show ahead of its time. They had 9 18-wheelers worth of equipment, far beyond anything seen before. They had electrical engineering designs for every cable, every ground, every volt, watt and amp, carefully worked out to avoid electrocutions and fires. They had absolute, no-questions minimum tolerances for flooring types and load capacities, the height of the ceiling, specifications of how much weight each anchor point could hold. Every last detail was spelled out for what was, at the time, the most spectacular rock show on the planet, and failure to comply with anything could ruin the show at best, kill people at worst.

There, in the section of the snacks requested for backstage was the following:

Munchies:

* Potato chips with assorted dips
* Nuts
* Pretzels
* M & M's (WARNING: ABSOLUTELY NO BROWN ONES)
* Twelve (12) Reese's peanut butter cups
* Twelve (12) assorted Dannon yogurt (on ice)

This was a trap. When the show runners arrived, if they saw any brown M&Ms their immediate thought was ""these idiots don't pay attention to detail,"" and switched to micro-manage, fine-toothed comb line by line review mode. If they couldn't get that tiny thing right, what did they get wrong?

They weren't being divas, they were being savvy and wise and meticulous. But when the detail leaked the general opinion was ""spoiled rock stars and their stupid requests."" But they were rich and famous, so they just didn't care what anybody thought of them.

Years later though, people who were *real* divas heard the story, didn't understand (or care) about the wisdom behind it and just took free reign with their ego stroking, resulting in rider demands such as

* Mariah Carey: 20 white kittens, 100 doves and nothing but Cristal champagne for her dogs. (The demand for the animals was denied by authorities who ruled that the no-pets policy at Westfield applied even to her, and the local authorities weren't going to allow it on animal welfare and healty/safety grounds even if the shopping center would.)
* Jennifer Lopez: coffee must always be stirred counter-clockwise.
* Selena Gomez: no crew member may be named Justin (they could have nicknames)
* Kanye West: non-cylindrical vases prohibited
* George Clooney: beach hut and hot tub built next to his trailer
* Jay-Z: 7 dressing rooms
* Cher: a room for nothing but wigs

And one that I personally saw at the music venue where I worked as a kid, Bob Dylan had a rule that when he was doing a sound check **nobody** was allowed to be in sight. No security, no food service, no grounds crews, nobody was allowed to be wiping off the seats or policing the lawn for trash, if he saw anybody except for his sound engineer during the sound check he would cancel the show.

Honorable mention: the Foo Fighters specified in their rider that they required ""one angry llama"" but they later admitted that they were just yanking everybody's chain and having fun with it.",10,1759608983.0,EntitledPeople,4,0.78,False

I stopped chasing her over a year ago and just accepted it and spent more time with other friends. 

A couple months ago I asked her if she wanted to get coffee - just the 2 of us. I thought maybe it would be easier than all the times we trying to coordinate the whole family or multiple friends. She said yes, she would text me when she got home. 

She never did. Oh well. 

And now she’s texting me about a mutual hobby as if she can’t see the text exchange that would be right above this one. Wouldn’t most people be embarrassed and at least pretend to feel sorry! Haha. 

I’m just going to ignore the text. 

The problem is that our husbands are childhood friends. I mean, they also haven’t hung out in years, but I guess my husband doesn’t care. 

My husband wants to host a Christmas party. And I know he’s going to want to invite these friends - plus others who are totally non committal.

I’d rather spend my energy on the people who make it clear they like me!

Any way, when it comes time to invite people, I’ll probably tell him he’s welcome to invite those flakey friends, but i will not be the one to invite them. I’m out of that game.

She claimed she was boycotting pro-Zionist companies. This is why she experienced so much intense trauma from and was so abused by R sending over breakfast for the girls and coffees for Jibby to make sure they were fed before school. When she got those DoorDash orders, it was as if the Palestinians’ suffering was her suffering too. 😔

So, TikTok is now owned by a Zionist who is already rewriting the algorithm to favor pro-Israel content and suppress whatever pro-Palestine content they’ll allow to remain on the platform. Netanyahu has gathered a team of social media influencers, brought them on free trips to Israel, is holding workshops on how best to disseminate their hasbara, and they’ll be paid $7,500 per pro-Israel/anti-Palestinian post. TikTok will then promote their posts. 

Will Jibby stay true to her guiding moral principles and leave the platform? Or will she be kissing the Western Wall next week and return to TikTok to lecture us all on how the land was promised to the Jews in ancient religious texts and if we don’t think what’s happening to Gaza is awesome, we’re vial antisemites? 🤔 Mostly joking but also I wouldn’t put it past her.

New leadership came in and started engaging in borderline unethical practices, so I had to move on, which wasn’t an easy decision. On his way home from work, bf asks if I want to go to out to eat. I tell him I appreciate the offer very much but let’s do it another night because I was feeling really bummed. He got home and asked if I ate anything yet. I said no and he started making dinner. I then went into the kitchen and found him eating by himself with no extra food made. 

He finishes eating, walks the dog, then comes to sit with me on the couch and we watch a few episodes of a show. He hadn’t asked or said anything about my last day of work, which he knew was really hard on me. I knew I was in a crappy mood so I decided not to address anything and just go to bed. 

Admittedly I was irritated this morning and he asked what was wrong. I explained that I thought it was strange and sort of rude he made dinner and didn’t offer to make me anything. His response was that I knew he was making food and I could’ve asked him to make me some. I said it didn’t make me feel good that he didn’t check in with me about my last day at work. He said that if I wanted to talk about it, then he assumed I would bring it up. I tried to convey that asking me about my day and dinner shows interest and that he cares. He didn’t see it that way and doesn’t see any issue with his behavior. 

I know not all men think and behave the same way, but I’m curious, is this a “men are from mars, women are from Venus” type of thing? Am I off base for being upset? 

ETA: this isn’t typical for him. He wakes up early to make me breakfast & coffee, has been supportive through the whole job situation, etc. He’s done this type of thing more frequently (this is just one example), and it throws me off. ",3,1759608686.0,AskMenAdvice,38,0.8,False
